Multicellular organisms are composed of diverse cell types that must coordinate their behaviors through communication. Cell–cell
communication (CCC) is essential for growth, development, differentiation, tissue and organ formation, maintenance, and
physiological regulation. Cells communicate through direct contact or at a distance using ligand–receptor interactions. So cellular
communication encompasses two essential processes: cell signal conduction for generation and intercellular transmission of
signals, and cell signal transduction for reception and procession of signals. Deciphering intercellular communication networks is
critical for understanding cell differentiation, development, and metabolism. First, we comprehensively review the historical
milestones in CCC studies, followed by a detailed description of the mechanisms of signal molecule transmission and the
importance of the main signaling pathways they mediate in maintaining biological functions. Then we systematically introduce a
series of human diseases caused by abnormalities in cell communication and their progress in clinical applications. Finally, we
summarize various methods for monitoring cell interactions, including cell imaging, proximity-based chemical labeling, mechanical
force analysis, downstream analysis strategies, and single-cell technologies. These methods aim to illustrate how biological
functions depend on these interactions and the complexity of their regulatory signaling pathways to regulate crucial physiological
processes, including tissue homeostasis, cell development, and immune responses in diseases. In addition, this review enhances our
understanding of the biological processes that occur after cell–cell binding, highlighting its application in discovering new
therapeutic targets and biomarkers related to precision medicine. This collective understanding provides a foundation for
developing new targeted drugs and personalized treatments.

INTRODUCTION
The coordination of cellular activities, essential for multicellular
existence, is contingent upon cell–cell interactions (CCIs) among a
variety of cell types and tissues throughout an organism.1–3
Cell–cell communication (CCC) is an essential process that
profoundly inﬂuences an organism’s homeostasis, development,
and disease processes.4 Typically, CCC involves interactions with
secreted ligands and plasma membrane receptors, yet it also
includes secretases, extracellular matrix proteins, transporters, and
direct cell-to-cell contact mechanisms.5 Different cells employ
different CCCs to ensure biological development, homeostasis,
and tissue repair.
Essentially, CCC is a fundamental characteristic of multicellular
organisms.6 The dynamic communication network established
between cells through collaboration plays a pivotal role in various
biological
processes.6–8
This
interaction
is
integral
to
the
functioning of living organisms, inﬂuencing cellular metabolism,
energy transformation, maintenance of physiological functions,
regulation of growth, development, immune responses, single-cell
functions, and other critical life processes.9 For example, during
immune responses, CCCs enable immune cells to recognize and
combat pathogens. In growth and development, CCCs regulate
cell proliferation and differentiation, facilitating the normal
development of organs and tissues. Diseases typically manifest
when cells fail to interact correctly or misinterpret molecular
information.5
CCCs reﬂect the fundamental level of physiological commu-
nication, triggering responses to internal or external environments
essential for survival. When cells communicate with each other,
extracellular signals typically induce intracellular signal transduc-
tion cascades, leading to cellular responses such as changes in the
cytoskeleton, metabolism, or gene expression.10 The regulation
and feedback mechanisms at various levels of these transduction
cascades modulate the pathway’s activity over time.11 Signal
pathways are the basis of internal communication and response to
the external environment in organisms. They are responsible for
converting
extracellular
signals
into
intracellular
responses,
thereby regulating cell behavior and function. These pathways
involve a series of precise molecular events, including the
reception of signals, ampliﬁcation, distribution, and the triggering
of speciﬁc cellular responses.12,13 Critical cellular determinations,
such as cytoskeletal reorganization, cell cycle checkpoints, and

programmed cell death, are contingent upon the stringent
temporal regulation and the speciﬁc spatial distribution of
activated signal transducers.14 Understanding how these path-
ways are disrupted in diseases offers the possibility for developing
new therapeutic approaches.15–17
The complexity of CCC has been recognized as part of the
molecular mechanisms of developmental biology, carcinogenesis,
and organ dysfunction.18 Exploring CCC dynamic changes under
different conditions provides deeper insights into the underlying
mechanisms of diverse biological processes and helps elucidate
the mechanisms behind the onset and progression of diseases.
Over the decade, single-cell RNA sequencing has gained wide-
spread use across multiple research ﬁelds to investigate the critical
role of ligand–receptor dynamics in intercellular communication.19
Technologies
like
single-cell
RNA
sequencing
(scRNA-Seq)
empower researchers to explore the intricate communication
patterns between different cell types within multicellular organ-
isms, offering fresh perspectives on cell communication mechan-
isms, cell functions, and the organization of cell populations. The
analysis of intercellular communication assists in understanding
the interplay between cells, dissecting communication networks,
uncovering various cell interactions in the developmental process,
exploring the tumor immune microenvironment, and identifying
potential therapeutic targets for diseases.20 Therefore, identifying
and quantifying intercellular signaling pathways have become
standard practices across diverse disciplines.
Activating
speciﬁc
cell
signaling
pathways
through
ligand–receptor interactions (LRIs) constitutes a fundamental
mode of cell communication and is intricately linked to various
degenerative processes and diseases. Different cell types share
common
biological
elements
facilitating
these
interactions,
encompassing ligands, surface receptors, adhesion proteins,
intracellular adaptors, as well as glycans, lipids, cytoskeletons,
and scaffolding proteins.21 Comprehending the orchestration of
biophysical, genetic, and biochemical events in CCCs by these
shared components across various cell types is crucial for
developing clinical therapies based on proteins and cells that
either modulate or utilize intercellular communication.22,23 The
analysis of LRIs provides the foundation for comprehending cell
behavior and responses to neighboring cells.24
Historically, CCC research has primarily been conﬁned to
experiments conducted in vitro involving one or two types of
cells and a limited set of genes. With advancements in science and
technology, data acquisition at the single-cell level enables the
detection of low-abundance genes and provides a robust
foundation for cell communication study. In recent years, multiple
research efforts have concentrated on intercellular signaling by
employing either the co-expression of all genes or particular cell
markers,25,26 the resemblance in expression patterns.27 or the
characteristics of regulatory networks.28 Understanding LRIs is an
effective approach to understand cellular communication at the
single-cell level, and a multitude of research endeavors are
dedicated to formulating strategies to construct cellular commu-
nication networks based on these interactions. Harnessing these
technologies, many laboratories have developed various algo-
rithms and softwares for cell communication research.
The review comprehensively outlines the experimental and
computational CCC methods rooted in chemistry and biology to
decode the complexities of CCCs. It extensively examines how
biological functions rely on CCCs to regulate crucial physiological
process, including tissue homeostasis, cell development as well as
immune responses.5,24 Furthermore, this review sheds light on the
role of CCC mechanisms in regulating various diseases, which
have not only expanded our understanding of CCC but also paved
the way for innovative clinical treatments.
RESEARCH HISTORY AND MILESTONE EVENTS OF CCC
In multicellular organisms, cells have evolved different intercellular
communication modes to develop and regulate their coordinated
functions.29 At the macroscopic level, direct physical contacts
between adjacent cells lead to the formation of tissues and barrier
structures, while at the microscopic scale, they drive changes in
cellular signaling pathways and activation states.24 Comprehend-
ing how biological components synergize to orchestrate biochem-
ical, genetic, and biophysically mediated cell interaction events
among diverse cell types constitutes the essence of enhancing our
understanding of the biology underlying CCCs (Fig. 1).
Identifying cell surface receptors and their ligands, such as
growth factors, is crucial for understanding how cells perceive and
respond to external signals. During a research endeavor exploring
the speciﬁc growth-stimulating impacts of mouse sarcoma on the
sensory and sympathetic nervous systems of chick embryos, it was
unveiled that mouse sarcoma had the ability to generate a speciﬁc
factor to speciﬁcally promote the growth and development of
nerve cells.30 Later, this factor is well-known as nerve growth
factor (NGF) and stands as the inaugural growth factor to be
discovered, unveiling the pivotal role of extracellular factors in
modulating cell growth and differentiation. This revelation has
exerted a profound impact on the evolution of neuroscience and
cellular biology. With a deepening understanding of cellular
signaling molecules, researchers have begun to investigate how
signal transduction pathways alter in human diseases. Disrupting
and/or altering these cell interaction events can lead to severe
downstream
pathophysiological
effects.
Research
on
obese
hyperglycemic mouse models has revealed that insulin resistance
is associated with dysfunction of insulin receptors.31 Insulin exerts
its effects by binding to its receptors on the cell surface. Insulin
resistance may be caused by a reduction of insulin receptors or
receptor dysfunction, leading to decreased efﬁciency of insulin

signal transduction. Even if insulin successfully binds to its
receptor, certain components of the signaling pathway may be
impaired, affecting the biological effects of insulin. The studies of
the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance enhance our
understanding of how cell function and disease states can be
inﬂuenced at the single-cell level by regulating the interactions
between signaling molecules and receptors, offering potential
new targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Communica-
tion errors can lead to diseases such as cancer metastasis, motor
neuron diseases, virus-host interactions, and diabetes. Therefore,
research into CCCs can enhance understanding of disease
mechanisms
and
facilitate
the
development
of
pharmaceuticals.32–35
Optical microscopy has been widely used as a powerful means
for over a century to visualize the sites of CCCs and understand
the spatial or organizational structures underlying these interac-
tions. Early examples of studying cell contact interfaces based on
microscopy include the direct observation of cell dissociation in
sponges and the aggregation of cells into tissue-like structures in
higher animals using optical microscopy.36,37 With the improve-
ment of ﬂuorescent dyes and optical systems, scientists began to
utilize ﬂuorescent materials to study cells and tissues. An early
study ﬁrst reported the primary structure of the green ﬂuorescent
protein (GFP) from the jellyﬁsh Aequorea victoria.38 It not only
identiﬁed the amino acid sequence of GFP but also laid the
foundation for subsequent research utilizing GFP as a reporter
gene to visualize and track speciﬁc proteins, organelles, and
intercellular communication within cells. GFP not only enables the
direct observation of gene expression in living cells but also allows
for the tracking of speciﬁc processes within cells through GFP-
tagged proteins. Without affecting the growth and development
of the host cell, the ﬂuorescence can be stably inherited by
offspring, making it an ideal tool for tracking and studying the
dynamics of gene expression.39
Super-resolution methodologies have made signiﬁcant strides,
transcending this limitation through techniques such as near-
ﬁeld,40 stimulated emission depletion,41 structured illumina-
tion,42,43 and reversible saturable optical ﬂuorescence transitions
microscopy.44 Yet, the objective remains to achieve a ﬂuorescence
technology
capable
of
attaining
resolutions
closer
to
the
molecular scale. A technique known as GFP reconstitution across
synaptic partners (GRASP) employs the fusion of two nonﬂuor-
escent split GFP fragments onto interacting partners on opposing
cells to detect CCCs.45 Upon close contact between cells, the split
proteins associate, reconstituting the GFP. This method has been
expanded to include other split ﬂuorescent protein fragments, YFP
(yellow) and CFP (cyan), for the simultaneous imaging of multiple
synaptic interaction factors.46 An advanced imaging technique
known as optical super-resolution microscopy, speciﬁcally photo-
activated localization microscopy, enables the observation of
ﬂuorescent proteins within cells at nanometer resolution.47
On the other hand, high-throughput technologies are powerful
and economical tools for ultra-high-throughput transcription and
protein analysis,48–52 which have greatly accelerated our under-
standing
of
the
gene
expression,
regulation
and
network
complexity of mammalian cells.53–59 For example, the develop-
ment of Drop-Seq.60 and inDrop.61 has enabled simultaneous
analysis of a large number of single cells, signiﬁcantly improving
sequencing efﬁciency and enhancing our understanding of
complex tissues and cellular biology. Understanding the spatial
organization of cells within tissues and how they communicate is
essential for deciphering the principles of tissue architecture and
organ
function.62,63
Thus,
spatial
transcriptome
technology,
namely multiplexed error-robust ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization
(MERFISH), was developed to simultaneously measure the copy
numbers and spatial distribution of hundreds to thousands of RNA
species in individual cells by using single-molecule FISH ﬂuor-
escent probes that bind with high speciﬁcity to the desired RNA
targets.64 Due to its high speciﬁcity, sensitivity, and spatial
resolution, MERFISH has a wide range of applications in basic
biology and medical ﬁelds.65,66
Meanwhile,
spatial
proteome
approaches
are
emerging
research ﬁelds focusing on understanding the qualitative and
quantitative aspects of protein composition within single cells.
Immunohistochemistry
and
immunoﬂuorescence
techniques,
combined with microscopic imaging technology, can display the
distribution and density of cells in tumor tissue samples, as well as
the physiological and biochemical activities involved by different
cells.67,68 For example, CODEX (CO-Detection by indEXing)62 and
Cell DIVE69 are cutting-edge high-dimensional imaging technol-
ogies that have revolutionized the study of cell communication
and tissue analysis. The core design principle of CODEX is to label
each antibody with a speciﬁc oligonucleotide “barcode”, of which
the complementary sequence is bound with the ﬂuorescent dyes
used for subsequent imaging.62,70 In contrast, each antibody used
in Cell DIVE is directly labeled with ﬂuorescent dyes, followed by
multiple rounds of staining, imaging and ﬂuorescence quenching.
Therefore, both CODEX and Cell DIVE offer high-dimensional
imaging of dozens of proteins within individual cells, enabling
researchers to analyze the spatial organization of cells, their
interactions, and signaling states within tissues. Furthermore,
novel single-cell spatial in situ imaging technologies, such as
GeoMx DSP spatial multi-omics technology, break through the
limitations of the number of detected proteins and enable
spatially proﬁling 570+ protein targets and the whole transcrip-
tome
separately
or
simultaneously.63,71
Collectively,
these
advanced spatial single-cell imaging technologies will drive
deeper insights for cell typing, tissue phenotyping, cell–cell
interactions, cellular processes, and biomarker discovery.
MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF CCC
Cell signaling, which involves transmitting information between
cells or subcellular components, is an inherent characteristic of
living organisms. In diverse tissues and organs, cell signaling
facilitates communication and homeostasis, which are vital for
cellular interactions within their local environment. Signals can
propagate through various mechanisms, including chemical
alterations, mechanical forces, or their synergistic effects. A
multitude of extracellular signals and cellular membrane proteins
trigger selective intracellular pathways, inﬂuencing crucial cellular
outcomes such as survival, apoptosis, growth, motility, differentia-
tion, and speciﬁc functions like muscular contraction, synaptic
activity, or thrombocyte activation.72 Typical examples are the
triggering of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling
pathway in the context of tissue ﬁbrosis.73 and the excessive
activation of the Ras signaling pathway in numerous cancer
types.74 Over the last decades, extensive research into cell
signaling pathways has culminated in the creation of therapeutics
rooted in biological science, and the complexity revealed by drugs
currently in clinical use continues to uncover further insights into
the extent of interactions between signaling networks.75 Cellular
communication encompasses two essential processes: cell signal
conduction, focusing on the generation and intercellular transmis-
sion of signals, and cell signal transduction, which emphasizes the
reception of signals and how signals are converted and processed
upon receipt (Fig. 2).
Mechanisms of CCC in physiological homeostasis
Cellular communication involves cells recognizing, receiving, and
responding to external signal molecules, which can be light,
electricity, or chemical molecules. Finally, the interaction of
receptors can activate a series of downstream physiological and
biochemical processes, which play an important role in coordinat-
ing cell function. Cellular communication involves the transmis-
sion of signals from signal generation to signal transduction. Cell

signal transduction is the process through which biological
information (excitation or inhibition) is transformed and trans-
mitted between cells or within cells, leading to various biological
effects. This typically refers to transmembrane signal transduction,
wherein bioactive substances activate or inhibit cell function
through receptors or ion channels. Generally, the chemical
substances involved in intercellular signal communication or
intracellular signal transduction are known as signal molecules,
while small molecules specialized in carrying biological informa-
tion are called messenger molecules. The chains of signal
molecules that complete the conversion and transmission of
biological information within or between cells are referred to as
signal transduction pathways. Therefore, the essence of cell signal
transduction lies in the intracellular transformation and transmis-
sion of biological information through speciﬁc signal transduction
pathways, which may involve regulating the gene expression
processes of related functional proteins.
The steps of cell signal conduction
Production and release of signaling molecules:
Certain cells,
such as neurons or endocrine cells, react to external stimuli or
internal needs by creating and releasing signaling molecules like
neurotransmitters, hormones, or chemokines. These molecules
serve as messengers to communicate messages to neighboring
cells.
Neurons, as the primary cells that participate in information
processing, come in a myriad of distinct cell types differentiated
by morphology, location, connectivity, and chemical properties.76
The various chemicals that transmit information between neurons
are known as neurotransmitters. Owing to the central role of
neurotransmitters in cerebral function, neurotransmitter receptors
along
with
other
proteins
engaged
in
the
synthesis
and
deactivation of neurotransmitters emerge as critical targets in
the development of curative medications for mental and nerve
disorders,
ache
and
many
other
conditions.77
As
gaseous
neurotransmitters, such as nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide
(CO), play a regulatory role in vasodilation and neural transmis-
sion.78,79 The nervous system typically enables information to be
transmitted rapidly between different regions of the body.
In contrast, hormonal communication is predicated on the
synthesis and dissemination of a plethora of glandular hormones,
coupled with their transportation via the bloodstream, making it
more suited to situations requiring broader and more sustained
regulatory actions. These two systems of communication are
mutually complementary, with neural stimuli capable of affecting
the secretion of certain hormones, and conversely.80 Certain
hormones are tailored to interact exclusively with a limited array
of target cells, whereas others exert inﬂuence across a broad
spectrum of cell types throughout the organism. To preserve
homeostasis and adapt effectively to environmental alterations,
the biosynthesis and release of hormones are subject to rigorous
regulation. This regulatory mechanism is achieved through a
complex interplay among multiple hormones, which reciprocally
regulate one another, rather than being governed by a solitary
hormone. Hormones play a pivotal role in orchestrating a
multitude of bodily functions, encompassing growth and devel-
opment, metabolic processes, electrolyte equilibrium, and repro-
ductive functions.
Cytokines are produced by speciﬁc cells (such as immune cells,
endothelial cells, etc.) in response to speciﬁc stimuli, such as
infection, injury, inﬂammatory responses, or the action of other
cytokines, and are released into the extracellular environment.
Fig. 2
Representative signal pathways of CCC. Cellular communication is the process of signal construction to signal transduction. The
interactions of ligands and receptors usually affect cell metabolism and energy transformation of different cell types to maintain the normal
function of organisms. Ligands are active substances capable of speciﬁcally binding to receptors. Receptors speciﬁcally recognize and bind to
signaling molecules, converting them into intracellular signals to perform speciﬁc physiological functions. One of the major signaling
pathways within the signal transduction pathway are GPCRs pathways, including PKA and PKC systems. The others are enzyme-coupled
receptor pathways, including PKG and MAPK systems. AC adenylate cyclase, cAMP cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cGMP cyclic guanosine

Cytokines are capable of activating a variety of cell types within a
speciﬁc tissue or initiating diversiﬁed signaling pathways within a
speciﬁc cell type, exempliﬁed by interleukins and interferons,
regulating various physiological processes, encompassing immu-
nity, development, growth, and tissue repair.81,82 Serving as
pivotal mediators of intercellular communication within the
immune system, dysregulation in cytokine expression or their
intracellular signaling pathways disrupts immune homeostasis,
precipitating the onset of pathologies such as chronic inﬂamma-
tion, autoimmune syndromes, and malignant tumors.83
The production of signaling molecules initiates with gene
expression. Speciﬁc stimuli, such as extracellular signals or
changes in internal states, trigger the transcription and translation
of speciﬁc genes, leading to the production of proteins or small
molecules as signaling molecules. Prior to maturation and
activation, these protein signaling molecules typically go through
a sequence of post-transcriptional modiﬁcations (such as splicing)
and posttranslational modiﬁcations (such as phosphorylation and
glycosylation). Meanwhile, some small-molecule signaling sub-
stances are synthesized within the cell through speciﬁc biochem-
ical
pathways.
Before
their
release,
signaling
molecules
accumulate and are stored in speciﬁc organelles within the cell.
For instance, neurotransmitters are usually stored in synaptic
vesicles of presynaptic neurons.84
When cells receive stimuli to release signaling molecules, such
as electrical, chemical, or mechanical signals, the vesicles storing
these signaling molecules move to the vicinity of the cell
membrane and fuse with it. Through exocytosis, the signaling
molecules are released outside the cell, a process that is
particularly important for proteins and certain large molecular
signaling molecules. On the other hand, some small molecules
and lipophilic signaling molecules directly pass through the cell
membrane to enter or exit the cell without vesicle-mediated
processes. Besides NO and CO, hydrogen sulﬁde is another well-
recognized gaseous signaling molecule.85 These gaseous mole-
cules are unique in their mode of action as they can freely diffuse
across cell membranes, enabling rapid signaling without the need
for speciﬁc receptors or transport mechanisms for their release
and action.
Transmission of signaling molecules:
Signaling molecules can
reach target cells via diffusion, blood circulation, direct contact, or
intercellular junctions. In the context of multicellular organisms,
four fundamental forms of intercellular signaling exist: autocrine
signaling, paracrine signaling, signaling through gap junctions,
and endocrine signaling. Autocrine signaling is prevalent in tumor
cells, wherein cells secrete ligands to induce responses via
homologous receptors expressed on the same cell. Paracrine
signaling
affects
nearby
cells
by
secreting
local
chemical
mediators into the extracellular ﬂuid, which act on adjacent target
cells through local diffusion. Signal transmission across gap
junctions involves molecules passing directly between cells.
Endocrine signaling occurs when endocrine cells secrete sub-
stances into the bloodstream, distributing them to various body
parts via circulation.
For long-distance signals, the bloodstream is the primary mode
of transmission. Endocrine cells regulate the production and
release of hormones by monitoring the concentration of speciﬁc
substances in the blood, such as glucose, electrolytes, and other
hormones. These hormones are then transported to various parts
of the body through the bloodstream, exerting regulatory effects
on distant target cells, thereby maintaining physiological equili-
brium and adapting to changes in the external environment.86 For
local signals, transmission through intercellular spaces or direct
cell contact is more common. Neurotransmitters primarily transmit
information through paracrine signaling. They are produced and
released by neurons at the presynaptic end, and transmitted
across the synaptic gap to the adjacent postsynaptic neuron or
effector cell. Once released, neurotransmitters diffuse across
synapses. In conjunction with the primarily chemical synapses,
electrical synapses also exist, facilitating the intercellular ﬂow of
ions via gap junctions. Electrical synapses enable the transmission
of simple electrical signals among neurons, while chemical
synapses allow excitation, inhibition, and complexity of biochem-
ical information to be passed among cells.77 Cytokines typically act
on neighboring cells through paracrine signaling, especially
during immune responses and inﬂammation. However, in some
cases, they can also be released into the bloodstream to regulate
systemic immune responses and inﬂammation. Certain cytokines
that exist in a membrane-bound form require direct contact with
receptors on adjacent cells to transmit signals.87,88
Binding of signaling molecules to receptors:
Signaling molecules
bind speciﬁcally to receptors on the surface or inside the target
cell, forming receptor-ligand complexes that activate the receptor.
Receptors are proteins or glycoproteins designed to recognize and
bind speciﬁc signaling molecules, converting external signals into
internal ones. Hormones travel to target cells via the bloodstream
and bind to speciﬁc receptors located on the cell surface or within
the cell. These receptors have binding sites that are highly
complementary to the hormone molecules, allowing hormones to
speciﬁcally recognize and bind to their receptors. Upon binding to
its receptor, the hormone typically induces a conformational
change in the receptor, thereby activating it. For cell surface
receptors,
this
conformational
change
can
directly
trigger
intracellular signaling pathways. For intracellular receptors such
as steroid hormone receptors, the hormone–receptor complex
often translocates to the nucleus, interacts with DNA, and
inﬂuences the expression of speciﬁc genes.
Neurotransmitter molecules, liberated from presynaptic vesicles,
traverse
the
synaptic
cleft
and
bind
to
proteins
on
the
postsynaptic neuron’s surface membrane known as neurotrans-
mitter receptors, altering the function of the postsynaptic neuron.
There are two types of neurotransmitter receptors: ligand-gated
ion channel receptors (LGICs) and G-protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs). LGIC receptors are proteins speciﬁcally designed to
rapidly transduce chemical signals of neurotransmitters directly
into electrical responses.89,90 A part of the protein is dedicated to
binding with neurotransmitter molecules on the extracellular side
of the protein. The portion of the protein embedded within the
cell membrane acts as an ion channel, creating a ﬂuid-ﬁlled
passage in the membrane for the transit of charged ions, but ions
are unable to pass across lipid or other solid membrane
constituents. This synaptic transmission modality allows for the
direct ﬂow of ions across the outer cell membrane rapidly. When a
neurotransmitter binds to the receptor, the exchange of nucleo-
tide guanosine-5’-diphosphate (GDP) and guanosine triphosphate
(GTP) on the protein’s intracellular side is expedited, culminating
in the split of the G protein into α- and β/γ-subunits, both two
types of subunits can act upon “effector” proteins, altering cellular
biochemistry, physiology, and gene expression, initiating intracel-
lular chemical signaling events.84,89,90
Cytokines are classiﬁed as secreted growth factors that instigate
signal transduction within target cells through binding with the
extracellular domains of cell surface receptors, forcing receptor
dimerization.91 Most cytokines contain binding sites for both high-
afﬁnity and low-afﬁnity receptors.92,93 Typically, the high-afﬁnity
receptor subunit acts as a cytokine-speciﬁc, private receptor that
determines
cell
speciﬁcity
as
well
as
the
cytokine’s
dose
sensitivity.94 In contrast, the low-afﬁnity receptor subunits are
common to be shared among various cytokines and mainly have
an impact on the efﬁciency of complex assembly, thereby
affecting the maximum strength and duration of receptor
signaling.92,95

The steps of cell signal transduction
Signal transduction and ampliﬁcation:
The activation of recep-
tors sets off a cascade of cellular responses internally. Signals are
transduced and ampliﬁed within the cell through mechanisms like
second messengers, switch proteins, enzyme cascades, etc.
Second messengers are small molecular compounds that carry
information within the cell. The second messengers play a crucial
role in cell signaling, capable of transforming the activation of a
cell surface receptor into the activation of multiple molecules
within
the
cell,
thereby
amplifying
and
conveying
signals
internally. This process activates or inhibits speciﬁc target proteins
and enzymes, triggering a cascade of downstream reactions.
Through these reactions, second messengers are instrumental in
regulating a myriad of cellular functions. The discovery of this
signal transduction pathway has laid the foundational framework
for understanding how cells communicate via chemical signals.
An early study elucidated for the ﬁrst time the role of cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as a second messenger within
the cell, demonstrating its capacity to translate the cell surface
receptor’s response to hormones and neurotransmitters into
intracellular biochemical activities.96 When external signaling
molecules such as adrenaline bind to GPCRs, the associated G
proteins are activated. The α subunit of the G protein activates
adenylate cyclase (AC), converting ATP into cAMP. cAMP, serving
as a second messenger, activates protein kinase A (PKA). In cardiac
cells, the increase in cAMP leads to the activation of PKA, which
phosphorylates L-type calcium channels, increasing the inﬂux of
calcium ions, thereby enhancing the contractile force of the
heart.97–99
Calcium ions (Ca2+) are important second messengers involved
in various signaling pathways. When external signals such as
neurotransmitters or hormones act on cells, the opening of
calcium channels or the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic
reticulum can cause an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentra-
tion. Subsequently, Ca2+ binds to calmodulin and then activates
downstream
enzymes
like
Ca/calmodulin-dependent
protein
kinase II (CaMKII), affecting various processes within the cell.
During neurotransmission, the release of neurotransmitters causes
the opening of calcium channels on the postsynaptic membrane,
allowing Ca2+ to ﬂow into the cell, activating signaling pathways
related to learning and memory, such as the activation of CaMKII,
which promotes the strengthening of synapses.100–102
Switch proteins, like G proteins and Ras, regulate the opening
and closing of signaling pathways. Ras protein is a small GTPase
involved in regulating signaling pathways for cell proliferation and
differentiation. When growth factors such as epidermal growth
factor (EGF) bind to their receptor epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), EGFR activates Ras, causing Ras to switch from a
GDP-bound state to a GTP-bound activated state.103,104 The
activation of Ras promotes the activation of the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) pathway, affecting the expression of cell cycle regulatory
proteins such as cyclin D, and facilitating the cell to enter a
proliferative state.
Enzyme cascades involve a series of enzymes that activate or
inhibit each other, amplifying and regulating signals (e.g., PKA,
MAPK). In the MAPK pathway, Raf (MAPKKK) activates MEK
(MAPKK), which in turn activates ERK (MAPK). Each step of
activation can lead to the phosphorylation of multiple down-
stream proteins. In response to cellular stress, the p38 MAPK
pathway is activated, leading to an increase in the expression of
inﬂammatory response proteins such as tumor necrosis factor α
(TNF-α),
participating
in
the
cell’s
response
to
stress
and
inﬂammation.105
Cell response:
Signal transduction ultimately inﬂuences the cell’s
physiological functions, including changes in metabolic activity,
regulation of gene expression, alterations in shape, or movement.
Different cell types and states may exhibit varying responses to
the same signaling molecule. Insulin activates the phosphoinosi-
tide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (also known as Protein Kinase B, PKB)
signaling pathway through the insulin receptor. Then, PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway can promote the surface expression of the
glucose transporter GLUT4 and increase cellular glucose uptake,
supporting energy production, and muscle contraction.106–108
Similarly, in liver cells, insulin also enables the activation of the
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and thus promotes the activation of
glycogen synthase, increasing glycogen synthesis, and lowering
blood glucose levels.109 In contrast, TNF-α can activate the nuclear
factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)
signaling pathway through its receptor and then promote the
expression of inﬂammatory response proteins, participating in
immune responses and cell repair processes.110 However, in some
cancer cells, the same signaling pathway may promote the
survival and proliferation of cancer cells because these cells may
have acquired resistance to apoptosis signals induced by TNF-α.111
Termination or reduction of signaling response:
To maintain the
cell’s sensitivity and adaptability to external stimuli, responses to
signaling molecules must be terminated or reduced. This can be
achieved through receptor desensitization, receptor downregula-
tion, degradation, hydrolysis of second messengers or switch
proteins, and negative feedback regulation, which involves
downstream effector molecules inhibiting upstream signaling
molecules, forming a closed loop. Prolonged exposure to high
concentrations of agonists (such as adrenaline) leads to desensi-
tization and downregulation of the corresponding GPCRs. The
desensitization
process
often
involves
phosphorylation
of
the receptor, which attracts β-arrestin proteins to bind with the
receptor, preventing further activation of G proteins while
promoting receptor internalization.112,113 The internalized recep-
tors may be transported to lysosomes for degradation (down-
regulation), or be dephosphorylated and recycled back to the cell
surface. This process leads to the decrease of receptors on the cell
surface, reducing the cell’s sensitivity to the agonist.
The rise and fall of cAMP levels are crucial for signal
transmission. The degradation of cAMP is catalyzed by cAMP
phosphodiesterase,
which
converts
cAMP
to
AMP,
thereby
terminating the signal transmission mediated by cAMP.114,115
The
MAPK/ERK
signaling
pathway
acts
importantly
in
cell
proliferation and differentiation. Activation of this pathway
promotes the phosphorylation of a sequence of downstream
effector
molecules,
consisting
of
transcription
factors,
thus
affecting gene expression. Meanwhile, the MAPK pathway also
activates certain phosphatases, such as DUSP (dual-speciﬁcity
phosphatases), which can dephosphorylate and inhibit compo-
nents of the MAPK pathway, such as ERK, forming a negative
feedback loop to set limits on signal strength and duration,
preventing overreaction.116 These mechanisms together ensure a
dynamic balance of signal transduction, allowing cells to make
adaptive adjustments to continuous or excessive stimuli, main-
taining the normal functioning of physiological functions.
Major signaling pathway
Within the signal transduction pathway, a receptor is a protein
within a cell responsible for receiving and transducing informa-
tion. Receptors in the cell membrane are termed membrane
receptors, while those in the cytoplasm and nucleus are known as
cytoplasmic and nuclear receptors, respectively. Ligands are active
substances capable of speciﬁcally binding to receptors. Receptors
speciﬁcally recognize and bind to signaling molecules, converting
them into intracellular signals to perform speciﬁc physiological
functions. Cell signals typically begin with primary messengers like
growth factors, hormones, and ions instigate a sequence of signal
transduction processes via membrane-bound or intracellular
receptors.

systems and many intracellular chemicals classiﬁed as second
messengers, consisting of cAMP, cyclic guanosine monopho-
sphate (cGMP), calcium ions, etc.117
The conjunction of a ligand with its speciﬁc receptor triggers a
distinct cellular signaling route.118 There are two types of signal
transduction pathways based on the nature of the ligand and
receptor. One is the nuclear receptor-mediated signal transduc-
tion, wherein lipid-soluble ligands enter the cell through simple
diffusion and directly bind to cytoplasmic or nuclear receptors,
typically inﬂuencing gene expression. Another type involves
water-soluble ligands or physical signals, which initially act on
the membrane receptor and produce effects through transmem-
brane and intracellular signal transduction mechanisms. These
signal transduction receptors include various types, including
GPCRs, enzyme-coupled receptors and ion channel-linked recep-
tors. It should be noted that most membrane receptor-mediated
signal transduction pathways can also alter transcription factor
activity and affect gene expression.
GPCRs pathway.
GPCRs constitute the most extensive and varied
type of membrane receptors in eukaryotic system. G proteins
composed of three subunits separately: alpha (α), beta (β), and
gamma (γ) are unique proteins that bind to nucleotides like GTP
and GDP. The α and γ subunits are tethered to the cell membrane
via lipid links. Upon ligands attachment to a GPCR, ligands change
the GPCR conformation, leading to the activation of the G protein.
The active G-protein disassociates from the receptor, splitting into
α and β/γ subunits. These subunits then stimulate speciﬁc
effectors, leading to the generation of second messengers, which
are detected by various protein kinases, ultimately triggering a
cascade of signaling events that drive cellular responses.
GPCRs play a critical role in cellular detection of external stimuli,
including odorants, taste compounds, photons, metals, neuro-
transmitters, biogenic amines, fatty acids, amino acids, peptides,
proteins, steroids, and lipids. The vast array of potential ligands
and receptors links GPCRs to numerous physiological and
pathological states, including pain, asthma, cancer, cardiovascular,
gastrointestinal, and neurological disorders. This signiﬁcance
renders GPCRs as prime targets for pharmaceutical interven-
tion.119 For instance, the identiﬁcation of spontaneous GPCR
mutations in individuals with various endocrine disorders high-
lights their importance in endocrinology.120
The GPCR pathway regulates multiple signaling cascades,
notably involving the PKA system, inositol trisphosphate (IP3)
pathway, and the calcineurin-dependent protein kinase (Ca/CaM)
pathway. These three pathways together constitute the main
framework of GPCRs signal transduction. Through different second
messengers and effector proteins, GPCRs participate in adjusting
numerous physiological functions of the cell.
The PKA system operates within the cyclic nucleotide system,
where extracellular signals bind to corresponding receptors. This
activates a signaling pathway that elicits a response by regulating
the
level
of
cAMP.
Typically,
the
signaling
molecules
are
hormones, and the cAMP levels are regulated by adenylate
cyclase. Following the action of the signaling molecule on the
membrane receptor, the G-protein-coupling system is activated.
Once cAMP is generated, it will activate PKA to amplify the signal.
This PKA signal transduction pathway regulates membrane
protein activity, gene expression, and hormone synthesis as well
as hormone secretion.121
IP3 pathway involves inositol trisphosphate as a second
messenger in G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated signal trans-
duction. In the IP3 pathway, extracellular signaling molecules bind
to corresponding GPCRs, activating the Gq protein on the
membrane. Subsequently, the Gq protein activates Cβ which is
the one kind of the isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) and can
dissolve phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two
second messengers. The second messenger IP3 binds to its
receptor,
promoting
the
release
of
Ca2+.
Another
second
messenger, diacylglycerol (DAG), synergistically activates PKC
along with Ca2+ and phosphoacylserine, culminating in a cascade
reaction that drives cellular responses.122 PKC enzymes take a
signiﬁcant part in the process of cell proliferation, differentiation,
and apoptosis. Ca2+ plays an important role in neuronal cells,
mediating essential physiological processes.123 Thus, this pathway
contributes to the regulation of cell proliferation, metabolism, and
growth, making it a potential target for tumor inhibition and
myocardial protection.
Ca/CaM pathway is activated through a series of interactions
involving calcium ions, calmodulin, and the phosphatase activity
of calcineurin itself. This pathway involves the release of calcium
ions from the endoplasmic reticulum or the opening of calcium
ion channels on the cell membrane, resulting in an increase in the
concentration of calcium ions in the cytoplasm. The calcium ions
then bind to calmodulin, thereby activating the phosphorylation
activity
of
protein
kinases.
This
activation
can
affect
the
physiological functions of the cell by regulating the phosphoryla-
tion state of substrates.124,125
Enzyme-coupled
receptor
pathway.
Enzyme-linked
receptors,
commonly single-pass transmembrane proteins, have enzymatic
activity within their intracellular regions or directly interact with
proteins that have enzymatic activity. The activity of enzyme-
linked receptors is strictly regulated, including ligand-binding-
induced receptor dimerization, phosphorylation, and negative
feedback mechanisms. Ligands, such as growth factors, coupling
with the extracellular domain of the receptor, inducing receptor
dimerization or oligomerization, thereby activating its intracellular
enzymatic activity. Following receptor dimerization, the intracel-
lular enzymatic domains phosphorylate each other, activating the
receptor’s enzymatic activity.126–128 The activated receptor trans-
mits signals by phosphorylating downstream proteins (such as
protein kinases and transcription factors), triggering a series of
signal cascade reactions that ultimately lead to changes in the
expression of speciﬁc genes and regulation of cell behavior. The
termination of signal transduction is usually achieved through
mechanisms such as receptor dephosphorylation, endocytosis,
and degradation, ensuring the precision and timeliness of signal
transmission. By activating a variety of downstream signaling
molecules and pathways, enzyme-linked receptors participate in
the widespread regulation of physiological functions, including
cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, metabolism, and
survival.
Enzyme-coupled receptors possess distinct molecular structures
and properties compared to GPCRs. For instance, tyrosine kinase
receptors possess protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity. When a
hormone binds to the receptor, the PTK segment in the
membrane is activated. This activation initiates a series of
intracellular information transmission cascade reactions with
phosphorylation of peptide chains and tyrosine residues in the
membrane protein substrate.129 Ultimately, gene transcription
processes change within the nucleus and result in corresponding
biological effects within the cell. Most growth factors, insulin, and
some peptide hormones are transmitted through this receptor
type. It has been reported that PTK is pivotal in initiating
multicellular
responses
related
to
DNA
synthesis
and
cell
proliferation. The proteins encoded by many retrovirus oncogenes
and the intracellular regions of several growth factor transmem-
brane receptors exhibit PTK activity. The receptor PTK not only
plays a role in transmitting extracellular information, such as
hormones and growth factors, but is also involved in the
malignant transformation and proliferation of cells. PTK has been
identiﬁed and characterized as a selective, potent, and well-
tolerated kinase inhibitor suitable for cancer therapy.130 As PTK
takes a critical part in the development and progression of
tumors, it serves as a promising therapeutic target in cancer cells.

Gene-targeting medications available commercially can effectively
reach therapeutic objectives by suppressing its function.
There are many other types of enzyme-linked receptors, among
which the more important ones include receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) and guanylate cyclase (GC) receptors. RTKs refer to
receptors
whose
intracellular
part
of
the
membrane
itself
possesses tyrosine kinase activity. The extracellular signaling
molecules that can bind to these receptors and complete signal
transduction are mainly various growth factors, such as epidermal
growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, ﬁbroblast growth
factor, and insulin. When the extracellular part of the receptor
binds to a ligand, the activation of the tyrosine kinase in the
cytoplasmic part of the receptor molecule occurs, thereby
triggering various signaling proteins to transmit signals along
different pathways reviewed below.
The Ras-MAPK is an important signaling pathway mediated by
RTKs, mainly composed of three key kinases: Ras, Raf, and MAPK.
When cells are stimulated by growth factors such as EGF, PDGF,
the growth factor receptors (e.g., EGFR, PDGFR) are activated,
leading to the accumulation of GTP-bound Ras (Ras-GTP).
Downstream Raf kinase is then activated by Ras-GTP on the
cell membrane, phosphorylating and activating MAPKK (MEK),
which in turn phosphorylates and activates MAPK (ERK).131
MAPK is able to phosphorylate downstream substrates, which
are often transcription factors (such as Elk1, Fos, Jun) or other
proteins that change cell behavior. The aberrant activation of
the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway has a bearing on many
diseases,
including
cancer
and
neurodegenerative
dis-
eases.132,133 Moreover, this pathway also interacts with other
signaling pathways such as PI3K–Akt, Janus kinase (JAK)-signal
transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), etc., jointly
regulating processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and
differentiation.
Another pathway activated by RTKs is the PI3K–Akt signaling
pathway. When ligands such as growth factors bind to RTKs, the
RTKs undergo autophosphorylation and activation, which prompts
the recruitment and activation of PI3K near the receptor. The
activated PI3K converts the membrane lipid PIP2 into phospha-
tidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3, acting as a second
messenger, activates Akt, thereby initiating a series of down-
stream reactions that affect cell survival, proliferation, growth, and
metabolism.134,135
GC receptors have a single transmembrane α-helix, with the
N-terminal ligand-binding site located on the extracellular side
and the C-terminal GC domain located on the intracellular side.
Once the receptor binds with a ligand, GC activity is activated.
Unlike the activation of AC, this process does not require the
involvement of G proteins. Once activated, GC catalyzes the
conversion of GTP to cGMP within the cytoplasm, which then bind
and activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG). Similar to
PKA and PKC, PKG is a serine/threonine protein kinase that
mediates signal transduction through the phosphorylation of
substrate proteins. Upon activation by NO and CO, GC augments
the production of cGMP. The cGMP binds and activates PKG,
which phosphorylates substrate proteins, activating downstream
signaling pathways to regulate cell growth and renewal.136 The
PKG signal transduction system regulates smooth muscle relaxa-
tion, nervous system function, and physiological processes such as
intestinal secretion, renin release, bone growth, and visual signal
transduction.137,138 Besides, there are signal transduction path-
ways directly initiated or propagated by intracellular functional
compartments. For instance, the receptor for NO is a type of GC
located within the cytoplasm, known as soluble GC. When NO acts
on soluble GC, it increases the concentration of cGMP and the
activity of PKG within the cytoplasm, leading to responses such as
the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle.139,140 These pathways
are essential for coordinating the activities of each organelle with
other cellular components.
In addition to the signaling pathways mentioned above,
enzyme-linked receptors also mediate the JAK/STAT pathway
and the TGF-β-Smad pathway. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is
typically activated by cytokine receptors, which lacks intrinsic
tyrosine kinase activity, but interacts with members of the
intracellular tyrosine kinase family JAKs. When cytokines (such as
interferons and interleukins) bind to their speciﬁc receptors, they
promote the activation of JAKs. The activated JAKs phosphorylate
the receptors, providing docking sites for STATs to bind and
become activated. The activated STATs dimerize and then
translocate to the nucleus, where they directly regulate the
expression of target genes.141 Besides, the TGF-β signaling
pathway is primarily mediated by a class of receptors known as
Serine/Threonine Kinase Receptors, which possess serine/threo-
nine kinase activity in their intracellular region. When ligands of
the TGF-β family, such as TGF-β, bone morphogenetic proteins
(BMPs), activins, etc., bind to these receptors, they prompt the
receptor kinases to phosphorylate Smad proteins. The phosphory-
lated Smad proteins further interact with other Smad proteins or
DNA-binding proteins, transmitting the signal from the cell
membrane to the nucleus, thereby regulating the expression of
speciﬁc genes.142,143
Other pathways.
External signaling molecules trigger the pro-
teolytic cleavage of a potential gene regulatory protein. Controlled
proteolysis modulates the expression of target genes. Signal
transduction pathways relying on regulated proteolysis encom-
pass Notch pathway, Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, Wnt pathway and
NF-κB pathway.
The Notch signaling pathway is a highly conserved intercellular
communication mechanism that is extensively involved in various
biological processes, including cell fate determination, embryonic
development, and tissue regeneration.144–146 A distinguishing trait
of this signaling pathway is its reliance on direct cell–cell contact,
obviating the requirement for signal molecules to travel long
distances between cells. The Notch signaling pathway is initiated
by the direct binding of the Notch receptor located on the surface
of the signal-receiving cell to its ligand situated on the surface of
neighboring cells. Notch receptors and ligands are both trans-
membrane proteins, with typical ligands belonging to the Jagged
and Delta families. After ligand–receptor binding, the Notch
receptor undergoes a series of cleavage processes. First, the ADAM
(a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family member metallopro-
teases cleave the Notch receptor in the extracellular region,
followed
by
cleavage
by
the
γ-secretase
complex
in
the
transmembrane region, leading to the release of the Notch
intracellular domain (NICD).147 The released NICD then enters the
nucleus, where it binds to the CSL (CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1) family of
DNA-binding proteins and other co-activators to form a transcrip-
tional activation complex, directly regulating the expression of
downstream genes.148,149
The
Hh
signaling
pathway
is
a
key
intercellular
signal
transduction mechanism, extensively involved in the development
of animal embryos and the maintenance of adult tissues. This
pathway plays a crucial role in the growth and proliferation of cells
during embryonic development and after embryo formation.
Aberrant activation of the Hh signaling pathway is associated with
various cancers and developmental abnormalities.150 Before being
secreted outside the cell, Hh proteins undergo a series of
posttranslational modiﬁcations, including autocleavage and cova-
lent attachment to cholesterol.151 In the absence of Hh ligands,
the Patched (Ptch) receptor inhibits the activity of Smoothened
(Smo). When a Hh ligand binds to Ptch, this inhibition is lifted,
allowing Smo to be activated. The activation of Smo triggers a
series of intracellular signaling events, ultimately affecting the
activity of glioma-associated oncogene homolog (Gli) transcription
factors. In the absence of signaling, Gli factors are partially
degraded into a repressor form. When the Hh signal is activated,

the inhibition of Gli is removed, allowing its full-length form to
enter the nucleus. The activated Gli transcription factor enters the
nucleus and promotes the expression of downstream target genes
which take part in processes such as cell proliferation, differentia-
tion, and survival.
The Wnt signaling pathway is a complex cell signaling system,
extensively involved in the embryonic development, cell pro-
liferation, migration, differentiation, and maintenance of adult
tissue homeostasis in animals. The name of this pathway
originates from a gene discovered in fruit ﬂies called “wingless”
and its mouse homolog “Int-1”, collectively known as Wnt.152 The
Wnt signaling pathway is primarily divided into two pathways: the
β-catenin-dependent
canonical
pathway
and
the
β-catenin-
independent noncanonical pathways. In the absence of Wnt
ligands, β-catenin is captured in the cytoplasm by a complex
(including proteins such as Axin and GSK-3β) and phosphorylated
by GSK-3β, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation. When
Wnt signals are present, Wnt ligands bind to the Frizzled receptor
and LRP5/6 co-receptor, inhibiting the β-catenin degradation
complex, preventing the phosphorylation and subsequent degra-
dation of β-catenin. The stabilized β-catenin accumulates and
translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to transcription factors
of the TCF/LEF family, activating the expression of downstream
target genes.153 The noncanonical pathways do not rely on
β-catenin but are mediated by other signaling molecules such as
Ca²+, JNK, Rho GTPase, etc., inducing various cellular responses,
including cell polarity, movement, and tissue morphogenesis.153
The NF-κB signaling pathway is a key cellular signal transduc-
tion mechanism, extensively involved in regulating immune
responses, inﬂammatory reactions, cell survival, proliferation, and
differentiation among various biological processes.154–156 Serving
as an immediate response mechanism, it can rapidly respond to a
wide range of external stimuli, such as cytokines, pathogens, free
radicals, and other stress signals. The NF-κB pathway can be
activated by multiple signals, including TNF-α, interleukin 1 (IL-1),
lipopolysaccharides
(LPS),
viral
infections,
and
other
stress
conditions. When inactive, NF-κB is bound to its inhibitory protein
IκB in the cytoplasm. Upon activation by the aforementioned
signals, the IκB kinase (IKK) complex is activated, leading to the
phosphorylation of IκB and its subsequent degradation via the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The degradation of IκB releases
NF-κB, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus, bind to κB sites on
DNA, and activate the transcription of speciﬁc genes.157 The
termination of the NF-κB signal involves newly synthesized IκBα,
which can enter the nucleus, bind to NF-κB, and export it back to
the cytoplasm, thereby returning NF-κB to an inactive state.
Accurate control of the NF-κB signaling pathway is crucial for
maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing the devel-
opment of disorders, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and
chronic inﬂammatory diseases.158,159 This underscores its signiﬁ-
cance as a prime target for pharmaceutical interventions.
Multi-level regulation of CCC and its implications
Upregulation and downregulation.
The activity of CCC signal
transduction can be modulated through upregulation (enhancing
signal
transmission)
and
downregulation
(weakening
signal
transmission). This regulation can be achieved by altering the
expression level of receptors, modulating receptor activity, or
changing the availability of signaling molecules. In certain
inﬂammatory responses, cytokines such as TNF-α induce the
upregulation of adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion
molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1
(VCAM-1), which are located on the surface of endothelial
cells.160–162 This upregulation enhances the interaction between
white blood cells and endothelial cells, promoting the migration
of white blood cells and inﬂammatory responses.163–165 The
prolonged or excessive use of β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)
agonists for asthma treatment leads to a reduction in the quantity
of β-ARs on cardiac and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), achieved
through mechanisms of receptor internalization and degrada-
tion.166–168 GPCRs after being activated over a long period can be
internalized through a β-arrestin-mediated pathway. This process
gives rise to a decrease in the number of receptors on the cell
surface, leading to a dampened receptor activity and ultimately
impairing signal transmission.113,169–171 This phenomenon dimin-
ishing the cell responsiveness to the agonist commonly termed
receptor downregulation.172
Desensitization.
Long-term or excessive signal stimulation causes
cells to become desensitized to certain signals. Desensitization is a
protective mechanism to prevent overreaction, achieved by
reducing the surface expression of receptors or inhibiting the
activity of signal transduction components. In patients with type 2
diabetes, prolonged high levels of blood glucose and insulin can
lead to desensitization of insulin receptors, reducing their
sensitivity to insulin and further exacerbating insulin resistance.173
In addition, long-term alcohol consumption can increase the
nervous system’s tolerance to alcohol, achieved by regulating the
expression and sensitivity of neurotransmitter receptors such as
GABA receptors and glutamate receptors.174–177
Upstream regulators and downstream effectors.
The regulation of
signaling pathways involves multiple upstream regulators and
downstream effectors. Upstream regulators are responsible for
receiving and integrating external signals, while downstream
effectors execute the biological effects of these signals, such as
altering gene expression and regulating cell behavior. These
signaling pathways are key mechanisms for communication
between cells, regulating cell behavior and cell fate through the
reception and transmission of external signals. They play roles in a
variety
of
biological
processes,
including
cell
proliferation,
differentiation, migration, cell death, and the maintenance of
tissue
and
organ
homeostasis.
The
aberrant
activation
or
inhibition of these pathways is closely related to the development
of various diseases, especially cancer, inﬂammatory diseases,
neurodegenerative
diseases,
and
congenital
developmental
abnormalities. They demonstrate the diversity and complexity of
signal transduction, including LRIs, subsequent activation of
signaling molecules, intracellular signal transmission, and the
ultimate activation of effectors. There is also crosstalk and
interaction among these signaling pathways, allowing them to
inﬂuence and regulate each other, forming a complex network to
adapt to different physiological and pathological conditions.
Spatial distribution.
The spatial distribution of CCC components is
crucial for the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of signal transmission. Cells
achieve precise signal localization and transmission by restricting
the distribution of receptors, enzymes, and other signaling
molecules to speciﬁc regions within the cell. In many types of
cells, speciﬁc receptors are localized to particular microdomains of
the cell membrane, such as lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are cell
membrane regions rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, capable
of aggregating speciﬁc signaling proteins, including GPCRs and
RTKs.178,179 This localization enhances the interaction between
signaling molecules, improving the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of
signal transmission. Directed transport allows cells to regulate the
activity of signaling molecules within speciﬁc temporal and spatial
ranges. Certain signaling proteins are transported to the cell poles
during speciﬁc phases of cell division or concentrated in the
leading edge during cell migration, ensuring the correct execution
of cell functions. The transmission of signals within neurons
depends on the precise release and reception of neurotransmit-
ters, which occur in highly speciﬁc spatial locations. Neurotrans-
mitters are stored in synaptic vesicles at the axon terminals, and
upon signal arrival, these vesicles fuse with the presynaptic
membrane, releasing neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.
Cell–cell communication: new insights and clinical. . .
Su et al.
9
Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy   (2024) 9:196 


Receptors typically located on the postsynaptic membrane ensure
rapid and accurate signal transmission.
The spatial distribution of signaling molecules also involves the
localization and transfer of nuclear receptors. Steroid hormone
receptors, such as estrogen and androgen receptors, are usually
located in the cytoplasm in their inactive state. Upon hormone
binding, the receptor–hormone complex moves into the nucleus,
directly regulating the transcription of target genes. This transfer
from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is a key step in the signal
transmission process, affecting changes in gene expression.
Furthermore, the spatial distribution of CCC components affects
the assembly of signaling complexes. In the Wnt signaling
pathway, the stabilization and nuclear transfer of β-catenin
depend on the interaction of multiple signaling molecules in
speciﬁc cellular regions. In the absence of Wnt signals, β-catenin is
captured and degraded in the cytoplasm. When the Wnt signaling
pathway is activated, proteins such as Axin are recruited to the cell
membrane, where they impede the degradation of β-catenin. This
preservation enables β-catenin to amass and translocate to the
nucleus, inﬂuencing gene expression.
Other regulatory mechanisms.
In addition, CCC signal transduc-
tion is regulated by posttranslational modiﬁcations, synthesis and
degradation of signaling molecules, etc. Phosphorylation is a
common posttranslational modiﬁcation that is crucial for the
regulation of signaling pathways. For example, in the EGF
signaling pathway, the binding of EGF to its receptor EGFR
triggers autophosphorylation of the receptor. This process boosts
the receptor’s tyrosine kinase activity, leading to the activation of
downstream signaling pathways such as Ras/MAPK, which in turn
stimulates cell proliferation and differentiation. The dynamic
balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reg-
ulates the strength and duration of the signal, affecting the
determination of cell fate.
Moreover,
ubiquitination
is
another
key
posttranslational
modiﬁcation
that
regulates
signal
transduction
by
tagging
proteins for degradation, thereby modulating signaling. In the
NF-κB signaling pathway, the ubiquitination and subsequent
proteasome-dependent degradation of IκBα are critical steps for
activating NF-κB.180
Furthermore, the synthesis of signaling molecules such as
neurotransmitters is essential for the transmission of neural signals.
For instance, serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan catalyzed by
tryptophan hydroxylase. The amount of serotonin synthesized
directly affects the strength of neural signal transmission and
psychological states, such as mood and sleep.181 The timely
degradation of signaling molecules is also crucial to ensure the
temporariness of the signal and the restoration of the resting state.
For example, acetylcholine is rapidly degraded by acetylcholinester-
ase, ending its signal transmission at the neuromuscular junction.182
This process is vital for the proper relaxation of muscles and the
prevention of continuous contraction (spasm). These mechanisms
work
together
to ensure
the
dynamic
regulation
of signal
transmission and the cell’s adaptability to environmental changes.
THE CLINICAL APPLICATION AND RESEARCH PROGRESS OF
CCC
As the body adapts to internal and external environmental
changes, various systems and organs of the body need to
coordinate to complete the adaptive response, including nervous,
humoral, and self-regulatory systems. At the micro-level, these
three regulatory mechanisms rely on the coordinated activities of
various functional cells in the body, necessitating a complex signal
communication process between different cells, namely cell signal
transduction. CCC is so crucial in the development of tissues,
organs, and immune responses that diseases can emerge when
cells fail to interact correctly or misinterpret molecular information
(Fig. 3). Therefore, studying the mechanisms and regulation of cell
communication holds great scientiﬁc signiﬁcance for under-
standing the nature of biology and disease, and has practical
application value for clinical trials.
Some pathways may be abnormally activated or inhibited in
disease states, and drugs can act by targeting speciﬁc cell
signaling pathways.183,184 However, the use of drugs needs to be
strictly controlled to enhance the efﬁcacy of existing treatments
and reduce side effects. The United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) conducts rigorous reviews of medications,
and drugs approved by the FDA have passed a series of clinical
trials proving their efﬁcacy and safety in treating speciﬁc diseases
or conditions.185–188 Table 1 shows some FDA-approved drugs
taking effects through therapeutic CCC targets. In the following
sections of this chapter, we will introduce the role of CCC in
different human diseases, including disease diagnosis, prevention,
treatment, and prediction.
Cancers
Cancer is widely recognized as a cluster of disorders marked by
uncontrolled proliferation and dissemination of aberrant cells.189
Cancer remains a major global challenge even though signiﬁcant
efforts have been made to develop new cancer treatments. As a
result, the discovery of novel therapeutics speciﬁcally targeting
diverse cancer forms is imperative.190 Since various signal
transduction pathways regulate cell growth, abnormal activation
or suppression of these pathways drives tumorigenesis.121 One of
the principal pathways is the PI3K–AKT–mTOR signaling that
linked to drug resistance and the malignant tumor process in solid
cancer patients.191 It is vital to use cell signaling molecules to
recognize cancer cells to inhibit the expansion and proliferation of
cancer cells. Posttranslational protein modiﬁcation plays a vital
role in the control of cellular signaling. Diverse protein kinases and
phosphatases regulate the phosphorylation and dephosphoryla-
tion of proteins. Tumors frequently exhibit irregular or uncon-
trolled activation of such kinases and phosphatases, making them
as essential targets for targeted cancer therapies. To cite an
instance, Imatinib is a BCR–ABL fusion tyrosine kinase inhibitor
and represents the ﬁrst kinase inhibitor successfully applied in
treating chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).192 Subsequently, inhibi-
tors targeting protein kinases such as mTOR, VEGFR, MAPK, EGFR,
CDK12, and ERBB2 have been employed in treating various
common malignant tumors.193–197 Employing gene-editing tech-
nologies like CRISPR/Cas9 to intervene at the genetic level in
cancer cells, whether by knocking out or modifying speciﬁc genes,
holds the promise of hindering cancer cell proliferation and
metastasis.198,199
While genetic or epigenetic alterations are often cited as the
root cause of cancer, the progression of cancer is intricately linked
with crosstalk among tumor cells, surrounding stromal cells, and
the extracellular matrix (ECM).200 Tumor cells promote their own
growth and proliferation by communicating with surrounding
normal cells, immune cells, and other cell types within the tumor
microenvironment (TME), such as ﬁbroblasts and endothelial cells.
Cancer cells do not manifest the disease in isolation but rather
conscript and corrupt resident and recruited normal cell types.201
Cancer cells can select noncancerous cells to engage in extensive
chemical and physical interactions, with many types of cells being
recruited into solid tumors and participating in complex interac-
tions that enable cancer cells to invade.202 Tumor invasion is not a
simple autonomous process of cancer cells but relies on a
complex network of paracrine interactions.203 Moreover, this
network

progression and signiﬁcantly impacts the efﬁcacy of therapeutic
interventions.
The study of the TME involves cell communication analysis to
select the most interacting cell subsets and further investigate
their mechanisms. For example, by using receptor-ligand analysis
of different subpopulations in bladder cancer samples, one study
showed that inﬂammatory cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (iCAFs)
specially interact with endothelial cells to promote angiogenesis
and tumor proliferation, revealing the role of iCAFs in the immune
microenvironment of bladder cancer.205 In addition, researchers

found the speciﬁc expression of ACKR1 in tumor endothelial cells
is associated with unfavorable prognostic outcomes in a gastric
cancer cohort, providing a new target for treating gastric
cancer.206 Various characteristics of tumors are primarily regulated
by the TME, including dysregulated ECM, sustained activation of
proliferative signals, inhibition of suppressors and apoptosis,
activated invasion and metastasis, metabolic dysregulation, and
evasion of immune destruction. Furthermore, factors secreted by
the primary tumor can modify the microenvironment of distant
organs, rendering them conducive to subsequently colonized by
metastatic cancer cells.207 The growth and progression of tumors
depend on angiogenesis, with CAFs being a primary source of pro-
angiogenic factors such as VEGF or PDGF.208,209 Tumor cells
discharge pro-angiogenic factors into their surrounding environ-
ment, contributing to the secretion of PDGF by endothelial cells,
which attracts supporting cells to solidify the nascent blood
vessels.210 The PDGF released by tumor cells directly binds to
receptors on recruited bone marrow progenitor cells and induces
differentiation into endothelial cells or SMCs through signal
activation, promoting their growth and migration.211,212
Mutations in genes and their respective signaling pathways are
the primary consequences leading to cell apoptosis, proliferation,
cell survival, and differentiation.213,214 A signiﬁcant number of
genes frequently mutated in cancer are responsible for encoding
components or targets of the PI3K–Akt and Ras-ERK pathways.
Typically, these pathways are transiently activated in response to
signals from growth factors or cytokines and the occupancy of
ligands for integrin adhesion receptors. Subsequently, mutations
in the tumor suppressor genes TSC1 and TSC2 lead to the
overactivation of mTORC1 signaling, an important target of
PI3K–Akt signaling.215 The transcription factor Myc is a signiﬁcant
downstream target of the Ras-ERK signal as well as numerous
other pathways, and it is often ampliﬁed or overexpressed in
cancer. Furthermore, the tumor microbiome may also emerge as a
critical factor in shaping the local immune response in the TME.216
They can enhance anti-tumor immunity through mechanisms
such as stimulator of interferon genes signaling activation, T and
natural killer (NK) cell activation, tertiary lymphoid structure
production,
and
presentation
of
tumor
microbiome-derived
antigens. In addition, they can reduce anti-tumor immune
responses and promote cancer progression by increasing reactive
oxygen species (ROS) levels, fostering an anti-inﬂammatory milieu,
deactivating T cells, and inducing immunosuppression.217,218
Immune checkpoint blocking (ICB) is a revolutionary cancer
treatment that blocks the interaction of inhibitory molecules
expressed on malignant cells with T cells, rejuvenating T cells in
the early stages of dysfunction. The main types of ICB therapy
include PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and CTLA-4 inhibitors. PD-L1 (the
ligand of PD-1) is mainly expressed on tumor cells and tumor-
inﬁltrating immune cells, and it functions to inhibit T-cell activity
by binding to PD-1.219,220 The action of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors is to
block the binding between PD-1 and PD-L1, restoring the immune
cells’ ability to recognize and kill tumor cells.221 CTLA-4 inhibitors
work by blocking the binding of CTLA-4 to the B7 molecules (B7-1
and B7-2) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, thereby
relieving the inhibitory state of T cells. In addition, CTLA-4
inhibitors can also reduce the number of regulatory T cells (Tregs)
that highly express CTLA-4 in the tumor microenvironment by
blocking CTLA-4, thereby relieving the immunosuppressive effects
of Treg cells and promoting the activation and proliferation of
effector T cells.222–225 These two types of inhibitors target different
immune checkpoint proteins, but their mechanisms of action are
similar, both working by blocking immune checkpoint proteins to
activate the immune system. Recent studies have identiﬁed IGSF8
as an innate immune checkpoint and tumor immunotherapeutic
target.226 The newly developed IGSF8.06 antibody can block the
inhibitory effect of IGSF8 expressed on tumors on NK cell function,
thus stimulating NK cells to kill malignant cells with antigen
presentation defects and stress signals.226
Stem cells, a vital component of cell therapy, play a crucial role
in restoring organs and tissues, holding immense promise for
various applications. It should be noted that stem cells derived
from different sources exhibit varying capabilities in terms of
proliferation, migration, and differentiation. These differences
inﬂuence their suitability for deployment in anti-tumor therapy.
In detail, cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a small fraction of
cancerous cells characterized by their capacity for multifaceted
differentiation, high self-renewal, and tumorigenicity.227 The CSC
theory postulates the existence of a minor yet crucial cadre of self-
perpetuating cancer cells critical in tumor metastasis, recurrence,
and resistance to treatment.227 Nevertheless, the precision and
biological role of CSCs are still ambiguous, prompting some
researchers to exercise caution and regard the theory as
contentious.228,229 Despite the ongoing debate, research on CSCs
continues to evolve and uncover new insights.230 CSCs were
originally extracted from cases of acute myeloid leukemia,231,232
possibly emerging from regular tissue-speciﬁc stem cells or
differentiated cells at the onset of the tumor, triggering survival
pathways and perpetual proliferation.233 Mechanistic studies
suggest dysfunction in some developmental and homeostasis
signaling pathways could facilitate uncontrolled self-renewal and
differentiation essential for CSC functionality.234 Such molecular
signaling
pathways,
including
Notch,17
Hedgehog,235
Wnt/
β-catenin,236 PI3K/PTEN,237 JAK/STAT,238 and NF-κB,239 are known
to regulate normal stem cell proliferation. Further changes in
these signaling pathways will lead to the formation of CSCs and

Examples of some diseases caused by representative abnormal CCC. CCC is an essential process that profoundly inﬂuences an
organism’s homeostasis, development, and disease processes. When cells fail to interact correctly or misinterpret molecular information,
diseases typically manifest. a Tumor cells invade surrounding tissues and blood vessel walls, inﬁltrate into blood vessels and spread to other
parts of the body along the circulatory system, then interact with original tissue niche cells and migrate to distant tissues to colonize and
grow. b Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis: A pro-inﬂammatory environment initiates the production of ANCA
by plasma cells as well as the priming of neutrophils through cytokines. c Roles of astrocytes and microglia in neurodegeneration: Danger
signals or invading pathogens activate microglia to release pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, which act on astrocytes, which in turn are activated to
release pro-inﬂammatory cytokines. d Pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis II: The major cell types and cytokine pathways involved in joint
destruction. e The role of ILC2s in asthma pathogenesis: Allergens, viruses or helminths provoke the release of alarmins from the damaged
epithelium and stimulate the GATA3+/RORa+ ILC2s to express type 2 cytokines. Interleukins-4, -5, and -13 cause IgE increase from plasma cells,
eosinophil expansion, and airway hyper-responsiveness, respectively. f Mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry: SARS-CoV-2 uses its spike (S)
protein to adsorb and penetrate cells. S1 binds to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) on the cell membrane through its
receptor binding domain (RBD), and S2 mediates the fusion of the viral envelope with the host, allowing the viral nucleocapsid to enter the
cytoplasm. g Type I vs. type II diabetes: The destruction of the islet cells prevents them from producing insulin, preventing glucose from
entering the cells and leading to type 1 diabetes. The reduced responsiveness of the body’s cells to insulin leads to insulin resistance, and the
inability to properly use insulin to metabolize glucose results in type 2 diabetes. h Differential roles of microglia in the developing brain:
During healthy brain development, microglia in its homeostatic state mediates the maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into
myelinating mature oligodendrocytes

The FDA-approved drugs summarized from 2015 to the present day. These drugs are mainly used to treat cancers, cardiovascular diseases, central nervous system diseases, respiratory diseases, infectious
diseases, metabolic diseases, and developmental disorders

subsequent cancer cells. Given that, biomarkers of CSC are
instrumental in diagnosing cancer, guiding targeted treatments,
and forecasting disease progression since growing evidences
indicate CSCs may play pivotal roles in critical disease stages from
cancer initiation to metastatic spread.240
Cardiovascular diseases
Vital body functions such as heartbeat and blood pressure
maintenance are under the control of the autonomic nervous
system. The cardiovascular system respond to sympathetic
stimulation of hormones secreted from nerve terminals by
adrenergic receptors (ARs), which are the dominant GPCRs in
the heart. In vascular smooth muscle, catecholamine stimulation
causes vasoconstriction through α-ARs and causes vasodilation
through β2-ARs. In the heart, catecholamine stimulation causes
increased heart rate and myocardial contractility through β-AR.
The signaling pathway most extensively researched in cardiac
myocytes
is
activated
in
response
to
β-adrenergic
stimulation.241,242
The contraction of the heart is initiated by an elevation in
cytosolic Ca2+ concentration within cardiac myocytes following
their electrical activation. This process is regulated by a multitude
of signaling pathways, which involve cascades of signaling
molecules culminating in posttranslational modiﬁcation (PTM,
e.g., phosphorylation) of target proteins.243 For example, CaMKII is
a pivotal regulator of excitation-contraction coupling and Ca2+
cycling, in charge of numerous essential cardiac functions.
According to reports, the expression level and activity of the
main cardiac subtype CaMKIIδ are unregulated in human heart
failure.244,245 Chronic overactivation of CaMKII can lead to several
other pathological symptoms, including cardiac hypertrophy,246
diastolic and systolic dysfunction,247,248 arrhythmia,249,250, and
ischemia/reperfusion injury.251,252 Different PTMs of CaMKII lead
heart disease through different pathological mechanisms. In
details, oxidized CaMKII contributes to apoptosis post-myocardial
infarction and atrial ﬁbrillation,246 while O-GlcNAcylation con-
tributes to hyperglycemia-induced arrhythmia.253–256 Whereas,
nitrosylation of CaMKII confers a sex-dependent protective effect
against harm from ischemia/reperfusion in females.257
Cardiovascular disease encompasses a range of conditions
impacting the heart or circulatory system, including heart failure,
coronary
artery
disease,
stroke,
high
blood
pressure,
and
atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inﬂammatory disease
characterized by the formation of lipid-rich plaques on the walls of
blood vessels, which can lead to myocardial infarction, stroke,
unstable angina, and sudden cardiac death.258–260 Atherosclerosis
is not considered simply as a lipid storage disorder any more, as
research has reported the involvement of inﬂammatory mechan-
isms in the progression of the disease, such as the accumulation of
leukocytes at site of lesion.261,262 Leukocytes within the plaque
produce growth factors, inducing SMC proliferation in advanced
lesions.263 The ﬂow of atherosclerosis triggers NF-κB activation in
endothelial cells, leading to the production of inﬂammatory
cytokines, thereby establishing an environment conducive to
atherosclerosis.264 A typical atherosclerotic plaque contains a lipid
core, with apoptotic macrophages constituting a necrotic core.265
Macrophage activation triggers the release of various cytokines,
transformation into foam cells, and subsequent necrosis.266
In addition, coronary heart disease (CHD) accounts for 42.1% of
all cardiovascular disease deaths. High-density lipoprotein-asso-
ciated cholesterol (HDL-C) is linked to lower risk and enhanced
outcomes in CHD patients via CCC. Cholesterol is transported from
peripheral tissue cells such as macrophages or vascular SMCs to
the liver through HDL-C for recovery or excretion through bile or
feces.267–269 ApoA-1 is the major HDL structural protein, which has
been recognized as an anti-atherosclerotic marker for acquiring
cholesterol and phospholipids efﬂuxed by hepatocytes and
enterocytes.270 The deposition of cholesterol in arteries can
initiate the atherosclerotic process, giving rise to the inﬁltration
of multifarious cell types including macrophages, ﬁbroblasts, and
SMCs, all of which play a role in plaque formation.267
Studies have documented the presence of extracellular vesicles
(EVs) within developing plaques and intimal lesions of advanced
plaques, indicating their role at both the inception and culmina-
tion of plaque formation in humans.271–273 EVs originating from
foam cells have been identiﬁed as catalysts for SMC migration and
activation of the ERK pathway, thereby exacerbating lesion
progression.274 Research has shown that following exposure to
an atherogenic trigger like oxidized low-density lipoprotein,
macrophage EVs are enriched with numerous miRNAs, including
miR-146a, miR-128, and miR-185.275 Furthermore, miR-146a has
been
implicated
in
accelerating
atherosclerosis
progression
through the promotion of macrophage migration towards the
vascular wall.275 Intercellular communication between endothelial
cells and SMCs is crucial for maintaining vascular homeostasis. The
transfer of miR-155 mediated by EVs from SMCs to endothelial
cells, driven by KLF5, leads to the disruption of tight junctions and
endothelial barrier integrity, promoting atherosclerosis.276 The
transfer of miR-143 and miR-145 in endothelial cell EVs induced by
KLF2 blocks the transdifferentiation of SMCs, thereby mediating a
protective effect against atherosclerosis through endothelial cell-
SMC communication.277
In the heart, increasing evidence suggests the presence of CCC
among cardiomyocytes and non-myocyte cells such as ﬁbroblasts
and macrophages. Besides, cardiomyocytes and vascular endothe-
lial cells share numerous systems of CCC, including direct
communication and paracrine signals such as pansexins, hemi-
channels, and purinergic signals. It is reasonable to believe that
they can regulate each other’s behavior through CCC. For
example, vascular dysfunction is related to arrhythmia.278–280
With our increasing understanding of CCC, new opportunities will
emerge to promote the treatment of various cardiovascular
diseases.
Central nervous system diseases
Almost one-sixth of the people in the world suffer from central
nervous system (CNS) diseases, ranging from mild nerve injury to
coma and even brain death.281 The main cell type in neural tissue
is neurons. The primary function of neurons is to be capable of
communicating with each other and with other cell types. The
axons of neurons release contents to synaptic intervals through
exocytosis, transmitting these chemical neurotransmitters to
receptors on another postsynaptic cell.282
Exosomes are active participants in CCC, being released by a
variety of cell types within the body, including neurons. Present in
diverse body ﬂuids like blood, cerebrospinal ﬂuid, alveolar lavage
ﬂuid, ascites, and amniotic ﬂuid, exosomes inﬂuence other cells,
triggering a range of physiological or pathological responses.283 For
example, exosomes secreted by oligodendroglioma cells can
induce neuronal death. In conditions such as amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), FTD-ALS, tau protein
disease, Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
exosomes migrate through the blood and cerebrospinal ﬂuid,
carrying misfolded proteins or pro-inﬂammatory molecules.284–286
Exosomes released by neurons can be internalized by other
neurons, indicating a novel avenue for interneuronal communica-
tion.287 Neurons in the CNS secrete exosomes to orchestrate
intricate communication with astrocytes and microglia, facilitating
extensive
crosstalk
that
governs
neuronal regeneration
and
synaptic function throughout both developmental stages and adult
life.288,289 In their role of regulating microenvironment, astrocytes
and
oligodendrocytes
produce
EVs
to
enhance
intercellular
communication and the activity of target cells.290–292 The release
of exosomes is speculated as a critical process in neurogenesis,
essential for protein clearance, and is triggered by the fusion of late
endosomes and lysosomes during axonal elongation.293–295

In the CNS, exosomes potentially play a dual role: they are vital
components essential for the CNS development and protection
under
normal
conditions;
while
their
participation
in
the
pathogenesis might worsen the conditions of certain neurode-
generation and neuroinﬂammation.296–298 For instance, elevated
levels of microglial exosomes have been observed in Alzheimer’s
disease patients, and exosomes from oligodendrocytes have been
implicated in inducing neuronal death.299 The extensive interac-
tions between glial-derived exosomes and neurons also suggest
that these vesicles are instrumental in both the formation and
sustenance of neural circuits, evidenced by their promotion of
neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons and enhancement of
cortical neuron viability.292 Moreover, exosomes originating from
microglia are known to regulate the activity of neuron by
enhancing myelin metabolism.290 The ability of exosomes to
access the bloodstream and cerebrospinal ﬂuid renders these
vesicles potential means for remote communication and trans-
portation, facilitating the delivery of bioactive molecules to
speciﬁc targets.300 As exosomes are capable of traversing the
blood–brain barrier (BBB) and preserving the characteristics of
their originating cells, circulating exosomes can offer insights into
the condition of the originating tissue.301,302 This feature presents
a precise and minimally invasive approach (via peripheral blood
sampling) for the early diagnosis of neurological disorders.303–305.
In this chapter, we focus on the relationship between CNS and
exosomes, and review how exosomes affect CCC to lead to CNS
diseases.
Consequently,
various
strategies
are
outlined
for
diagnosing and treating CNS conditions by leveraging exosomes
in the realm of CCC.
Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) plays a central role in the pathogenesis
of PD, and its elevated levels are adequate to cause PD.306–309
Exosomes in the blood carry α-syn and intensiﬁes the accumula-
tion and aggregation of α-syn through various mechanisms such
as miRNAs, consequently triggering inﬂammation, inhibiting
autophagy, and contributing to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s
disease.306,308,310–317 Exosomes derived from glial cells transport α-
syn and inﬂammatory factors from glial cells to neurons,
exacerbating the progression of PD.318 Contents of exosomes
derived from various bodily ﬂuids can serve as biomarkers for
diagnosing PD. For example, exosomes in the plasma of PD
patients were found an elevation expression of α-syn and tau
proteins. The presence of α-syn includes additional characteristics
such as β-sheet-rich structures and a ﬁbrillary appearance,
indicating the pathological transformation of this protein.308,319,320
As for the miRNA, the expression of miR-128, miR-505, and miR-
19b is downregulated, while the expression of miR-331-5p, miR-
24, and miR-195 is increased in the patient’s blood exo-
somes.321–323 Elevated phosphorylation levels of leucine-rich
repeat kinase 2, as well as increased levels of synaptosome-
associated protein 23 and calbindin proteins linked to PD-related
damage, were identiﬁed in exosomes isolated from the urine of
individuals with PD.324,325 In addition, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2
and α-syn as a biomarker has entered the clinical stage.326
AD is the most common form of dementia, of which the
number will reach 130 million by 2050.327 Due to the accumula-
tion of exosomes proteins in amyloid plaques in the brain of AD
patients, exosomes are receiving increasing attention. Exosomes
derived from different cell types play different functions in AD.
High concentrations of microglial exosomes were found in AD
patients.299
Exosomes
derived
from
neuronal
cells
contain
precursors of amyloid protein and enzymes used for precursor
maturation. Plasma exosomes accumulate in amyloid plaques and
participate in plaque formation.328 Exosomes derived from M1
microglia stimulate activation of resting microglia and enhance
pro-angiogenic responses via Irf1/miR-155-5p/Socs1 axis in the
retina.329 Exosomes spring from M2 microglia mitigate neuronal
damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD through the PINK1/
Parkin pathway.330 MicroRNAs that affect the occurrence and
development of AD are present in exosomes derived from both
peripheral blood and cerebrospinal ﬂuid in patients with AD.331
For example, exosomes affect the progression of AD by blocking
the transcription of amyloid precursor protein (APP) through miR-
185-5p or exosome content miR-193b.332,333 In contrast, exosomes
come from human cerebral spinal ﬂuid or N2a cells enhance the
synaptic plasticity destruction activity of synthesis and AD brain-
derived amyloid-β (Aβ) in vivo.334 In addition, exosomes from
astrocytes with accumulated cholesterol signiﬁcantly contribute to
the transport of APP/Aβ peptides and the inﬂuence of neuronal
viability in the affected AD brain regions.335
The excessive
phosphorylation
of
tau
protein
is also
a
characteristic of AD. Exosomes secreted by microglia are involved
in the transport of tau protein. Inhibiting the synthesis or secretion
of exosomes prevents the aggregation of tau protein in the
brain.336–338 Inhibition of exosome biosynthesis by blocking the
activity of a key enzyme regulating ceramide biosynthesis, neutral
sphingomyelinase 2, reduced the proliferation of Aβ plaque and
tau in AD mouse model.339 Some enzymes carried in exosomes,
such
as
neprilysin
and
insulin-degrading
enzymes,
reduce
intracellular and extracellular Aβ levels.340 In summary, exosomes
participate in the pathogenesis of AD by transmitting different
substances or information. Therefore, exosomes serve as transmis-
sion factors and diagnostic biomarkers for AD.341,342
In the exploration of AD diagnosis, some scientists believe that
exosomes in the blood of AD patients are fewer and smaller.343
while there are also reports that exosomes in AD patients are
bigger.344 Brain-derived exosomes in AD patients exhibited
signiﬁcant alterations in glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid
levels, especially an elevated level of plasmalogen glyceropho-
sphoethanolamine and a reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acyl-
containing lipids.345 More than 20 exosomal miRNAs in AD
patients were found to be signiﬁcantly different from those in
control group by using next-generation sequencing (NGS).346–348
The contents of these exosomes may have high potential value in
the diagnosis of AD.
In recent years, the roles of mast and microglia in the nervous
system have also been discovered. After responding to environ-
mental signals, mast cells secrete different neurotransmitters or
neurotrophic factors. This paracrine secretion leads to acute
activation and/or long-lasting changes in excitability and pheno-
type, which is associated with neuroinﬂammation.349 Besides,
exosomes derived from glial cells bind to toll-like receptor 2 and
the toll-like receptor 4 of neurons, leading to neuroinﬂammation
and even neuronal apoptosis. Exosomes derived from glial cells
transport abnormally expressed miRNAs, triggering and spreading
neuroinﬂammation.311,315 Understanding neuroinﬂammation also
requires recognizing that the non-neuronal cell–cell interactions
between glial cells, mast cells, and the glial cells themselves are
integral components of the inﬂammatory process. In this context,
mast cells play a crucial role in orchestrating the inﬂammatory
process, from its initiation to prolonged neuroinﬂammation.350
BBB composed of endothelial cells connected by tight junctions
and
adherent
processes
protects
potential
intruders
under
physiological conditions. In the treatment of CNS diseases, BBB
is an obstacle for drug delivery.351–353 In the past few decades,
researchers have continuously explored methods for delivering
drugs to the brain through BBB. Exosomes have loading and
delivery functions, and their lipid bilayer can fuse with membrane-
like structures in the body such as the BBB. Being able to pass
through BBB and carry goods, exosomes have become a star
substance for treating CNS diseases. The ﬁrst treatment approach
involves utilizing exosomes released by specially treated cells,
such as exosomes obtained from cells treated with curcumin.
These exosomes have shown promise in preventing neuronal
death both in vitro and in vivo, alleviating Alzheimer’s disease
symptoms by inhibiting tau protein phosphorylation through the
activation of the AKT/GSK-3β pathway.354 The second treatment

avenue involves investigating therapies using exosomes sourced
from stem cells, such as exosomes released by human umbilical
cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and adipose-derived
mesenchymal stem cells. These exosomes are being explored for
their potential to address conditions like neuroinﬂammation,
Alzheimer’s disease, brain injury, and neurodegenerative disorders
by reducing Aβ aggregation.355–357 Exosomes derived from stem
cells sourced from the dental pulp of shed human deciduous
teeth exhibited a neuroprotective impact on dopaminergic
neurons. Through intranasal delivery, these exosomes demon-
strated an improvement in motor function and a reduction in
dopaminergic neuron loss in Parkinson’s disease.326,358 The third
approach involves utilizing exosomes as vehicles to transport
various therapeutic agents, including siRNA and other medicinal
RNAs, peptides, dopamine, synthetic drugs, bioactive compounds
from plants, enzymes, proteins, and antisense oligonucleotides
designed to target the human α-synuclein sequence with suitable
modiﬁcations. This strategy aims to treat central nervous system
diseases by leveraging exosomes as carriers for delivering these
therapeutic payloads.359–367
Autoimmune diseases
Autoimmune diseases result from an aberrant immune response
against the body’s own cells and tissues, impacting conditions like
inﬂammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. As soluble
messengers, cytokines facilitate communication among immune
cells, playing a key role in regulating the body’s response to
pathogens.368 Although these drugs often result in adverse
reactions, current treatments for autoimmune diseases typically
involve drugs with anti-inﬂammatory and immunosuppressive
properties. The development of drugs targeting cytokines or
receptors, commonly known as “biologics”, represents a signiﬁcant
advance in treating autoimmune and inﬂammatory diseases.
Nevertheless, while biologics have been therapeutically successful,
they may not completely eliminate rheumatic pathology in all
patients. Moreover, the efﬁcacy of numerous
such agents
diminishes gradually owing to their immunogenicity.369 By
modulating cell-to-cell signaling, it is feasible to suppress the
hyperactivation of the immune system and diminish inﬂammatory
reactions in autoimmune diseases. For example, introducing
molecules like “pseudochain” proteins on the surface of T cells
can disrupt signals between T cells and other cells, offering an
effective approach to treating autoimmune diseases. Many
cytokines hijack JAK and STATs for intracellular signaling in
autoimmune and inﬂammatory diseases.370 Genetic mutations in
JAK and STAT genes are linked to a range of immune deﬁciency
syndromes and are connected to the development of auto-
immune diseases. Given their roles in downstream signaling of
cytokine receptors and growth factors, JAK/STAT pathways are
considered as promising therapeutic targets for both cancer and
autoimmune conditions.371 The efﬁcacy of small-molecule JAK
inhibitors in treating rheumatologic conditions illustrates the
potential of targeting intracellular signaling pathways for auto-
immune disease therapy.372
NK cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that
make a rapid respond to diverse insults through cytokine
secretion and cytolytic activity.373–376 They not only bring cell-
mediated cytotoxicity to bear on tumor cells or infected cells but
also regulate the effect of other immune cells via the secretion of
cytokines and chemokines, thereby playing a regulatory role in the
immune response.377–379. However, hyperactivation or malfunc-
tion of NK cells might be implicated in the etiology of speciﬁc
diseases.380,381 In viral-induced models of autoimmune diabetes,
NK cells are likely to contribute pathogenically in the later phases
of autoimmunity.382 The presence of a large number of circulating
NK cells may also be a nonspeciﬁc but signiﬁcant characteristic of
a predisposition to miscarriage.380 It is clear that NK cells possess
dual roles, both protective and pathogenic, across various disease
models, and occasionally even within the same disease. The
cytokine environment and other stimuli acting upon various cell
surface receptors in target organs, such as KIR, may trigger NK cell
reactions distinctly and inﬂuence their contribution to various
autoimmune disorders.383
EVs can directly interact with immune cells, activating or
regulating their functions by carrying immune-activating mole-
cules (IL-12/15/18).384 Some EVs can carry immune-suppressive
molecules (TGF-β, PD-L1, etc.),385 exerting inhibitory effects on
immune
cells,

system
surveillance. By delivering speciﬁc signaling molecules, EVs can
promote the generation and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs),
thereby playing a role in maintaining immune tolerance and
preventing autoimmune responses. EVs can secrete soluble
mediators, bind to receptors, and activate intracellular signaling
pathways.386 while they can also act through direct membrane
contact. Ultimately, this interaction may lead to the activation of
membrane receptors on the target cells, thereby activating
different signal transduction pathways.387,388 EVs express both
self-antigens and peptide-MHC complexes. Therefore, EVs may
represent a source of self-antigens and could potentially activate
autoreactive T cells in the context of MHC.389 Exosomes are a
subtype of EVs that are known to play a signiﬁcant role in
intercellular communication and antigen presentation. Exosomes
secreted by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) theoretically possess
the components necessary for antigen presentation and the
activation of autoreactive T lymphocytes.390 Exosomes may act
indirectly through interactions with APCs,391–396 especially for the
initial activation of T cells.396,397 EVs can bind to APCs through
adhesion molecules exposed on their surface along with self-
antigen/MHC complexes, allowing the T-cell receptor to engage
with the APC.393 The co-stimulatory molecules expressed by APCs
provide the necessary second signal for the activation of T
lymphocytes. This explains their involvement in the pathophysiol-
ogy of autoimmune diseases through participation in phenomena
such as inﬂammation and thrombus formation, vascular dysfunc-
tion, and the maintenance of autoimmune responses.398
Respiratory diseases
Evidences suggest that multiple cell populations in the lungs work
together to regulate the response of lung inﬂammation to direct
and indirect stimuli.399 After infection or trauma, resident cells
such as alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells secrete
inﬂammatory cytokines into the alveoli, which induces a large
number of inﬂammatory cells to migrate to the alveolar space.
From these migrating inﬂammatory cells, inﬂammatory mediators
are released and further lead to tissue damage and the
development of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress
syndrome.400 The coordinated participation of neutrophils and
macrophages in antimicrobial immunity serves as both inducers
and effectors of adaptive immunity against extracellular and
intracellular microbial pathogens. Neutrophils and macrophages
play crucial roles in the innate immune response by phagocytos-
ing
pathogens
and
activating
adaptive
immune
responses
through
antigen
presentation
and
cytokine
secretion.
CCC
between lung epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages plays an
essential role in lung inﬂammation and injury.401–404 Polymorpho-
nuclear neutrophil (PMN) accumulation and rapid inﬁltration in
interstitial and alveolar spaces of the lungs is a hallmark of lung
inﬂammation.405 Interactions of PMN with lung vascular endothe-
lial cells contribute to the activation of speciﬁc endothelial cells
responses involved in innate immunity.406–408
Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disorder. CCC
is highly involved in the pathogenesis of asthma in which
epithelial-derived cytokines drive dendritic cell activation and
phenotypic changes in the airways. These activated dendritic cells
then migrate to secondary lymphoid tissues, where they present
allergens to naïve T cells, triggering and perpetuating the allergic

immune response in asthma.409–411 The above process is a typical
inﬂammatory response in asthma-type 2 inﬂammation. During this
process, interleukin (IL)-5 targeting eosinophils and IL-4 targeting
lymphocytes are released.412,413 In asthma, mast cells and
macrophages produce histamine, serotonin, and various inﬂam-
matory substances. These mediators promote smooth muscle
contraction, increase mucus production, and enhance vascular
permeability, ultimately leading to edema and contributing to the
characteristic symptoms of asthma.414 Exosomes secreted from
various cells, including respiratory epithelial cells, lymphocytes,
mast cells, eosinophils, respiratory syncytial virus-infected cells,
and lung epithelial cells, have the potential to contribute to or
exacerbate asthma. These exosomes can carry bioactive molecules
and signaling factors that may inﬂuence immune responses,
inﬂammation,
and

pathogenesis.415–426
Infectious diseases
Human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) causes a chronic
infection leading to AIDS via infecting CD4 receptor-expressing
(CD4+) immune cells. The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein mediates
two kinds of infection. One is called cell-free infection that
infected host cells release virions to infect non-adjacent unin-
fected target cells. The other one is called cell–cell infection that
infected host cells transmit HIV-1 to adjacent uninfected target
cells
via
direct
cell–cell
connections
called
virological
synapses.427–433 In addition to CD4+ immune cells, myeloid cells
such
as
macrophages,
dendritic
cells,
and
osteoclasts
are
increasingly recognized as important target cells for HIV-1. These
myeloid cells can play roles in various stages of the disease,
including sexual transmission and early virus dissemination in
both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. They can serve as
reservoirs for persistent viral infection, contributing to the
establishment of a persistent viral library within the host. At least
in vitro, these myeloid cells are rarely infected by cell-free
infection. On the contrary, virus transmission through cell–cell
infection may be the main mode of virus reproduction in vivo
through the formation of tunneling nanotubes, homotypic or
heterotypic cell–cell fusion and phagocytosis.434–438
The chronic infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) impacts
approximately 257 million individuals globally, leading to severe
liver diseases, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. The interaction
between healthy and HBV-infected cells, along with other cellular
players such as innate and adaptive immune cells, is mediated
through direct contacts and the exchange of diverse factors. This
intercellular communication can be facilitated through various
mechanisms, such as the release of metabolites, virions, protein
complexes, and exosomes. These elements play crucial roles in
modulating the immune response, viral replication, and the overall
pathogenesis of HBV infection. Changes associated with HBV
infection alter the CCC between hepatocytes and adaptive
immune cells, signiﬁcantly inﬂuencing the disease’s progres-
sion.439–442 Understanding these communication pathways is
critical for unraveling the complex interplay between the virus
and the host immune system, which can ultimately inform the
development of effective therapeutic interventions against HBV
infection.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread worldwide in a
short period, resulting in numerous cases and associated deaths. A
previous study revealed that monocytes in severe COVID-19 cases
have the capacity to engage with CD8+ T cells, B cells and CD4+
T cells, chemokine receptors were also enriched in monocytes
from severe patients.443 Chemokines interact with chemokine
receptors to exert their biological effects, suggesting that these
cytokines or their receptors could be potential treatments for
severe COVID-19 patients and may become therapeutic targets for
COVID-19
patients.

formation.444 Syncytia transmit viruses through CCC to immune
cells and protecting the virus from neutralizing antibodies,
thereby promoting infection. Rapid syncytial collapse trigger
inﬂammatory immune responses which in turn leads to viral
pathogenicity.445–457 CCC among myeloid, epithelial and T cells
can drive tissue damage.458 Heterogeneous CCC patterns exist
among moderate and severe patients across epithelial and
immune cells in lung tissues.459,460 Exosomes participate in viral
pathogenesis and spreading by CCC and induce cellular damage
and multiple organ dysfunction such as inﬂammation, comple-
ment pathway, immune modulation, and coagulation in COVID-19.
Moreover, the exosome-based vaccine that contains mRNA
encoding the proteins of immunogenic COVID-19 has been
developed. Furthermore, mesenchymal stem cell-derived exo-
somes and convalescent plasma-derived exosomes are new
promising therapeutic strategies in severely affected COVID-19
patients.461–467
Metabolic diseases
Metabolic dysfunction encompasses a spectrum of disease risk
factors, encompassing hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension,
obesity, and insulin resistance. The pathogenesis of metabolic
dysfunction is complex, involving a diverse range of cell types,
tissues, organs, inﬂammatory signaling pathways, and humoral
factors.468 EVs can carry substances of their parent cells (RNA,
DNA, and lipids) and may provide the value of diagnosis and
prognosis in metabolic dysfunction.469–479 They can mediate local
communication between homologous cells within tissues (such as
endothelial cells, hepatocytes, immune cells, or pancreatic cells)
and traverse organ systems by entering the peripheral blood-
stream.480,481 Therefore, EVs hold promise as biomarkers for
predicting and diagnosing metabolic diseases.475,477,482,483 Speci-
ﬁcally, platelet-derived EVs, marked by the presence of CD41,
CD42b, and phosphatidylserine, have been implicated in various
physiological and pathological processes, including exercise,484,485
acute injury,486 and diabetes.487
The highly complex pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is
driven by several immune cells with effective response and
regulatory characteristics, ultimately leading to the destruction of
insulin-producing β cells. The interactions between immune cell
groups and pancreatic islets are multifaceted. In both humans and
mice, mutations in the FOXP3 gene, a key regulator of T regulatory
(Treg) cell development, maintenance, and functionality, can
precipitate severe autoimmunity, including T1D.488,489 An expanding
corpus of research indicates that disruptions in Treg induction,
stability, and functionality are central to the onset of islet
autoimmunity and the clinical progression of T1D.490–492 Speciﬁcally,
in the context of islet autoimmunity pathogenesis, the population of
insulin-speciﬁc Tregs is markedly diminished, and both the induction
and stability of Tregs are compromised in humans and mice.493 The
pivotal function of Tregs in thwarting T1D aligns with the observed
rapid disease advancement in NOD mice devoid of Tregs,494 and it
has been found that Treg deﬁciency leads to heightened T-cell and
NK cell inﬁltration in the pancreas.495 Studies have shown that Tregs
from T1D patients exhibit dysfunctional IL-2 receptor signaling
pathways.496 Administering a low dose of IL-2 for ﬁve consecutive
days increased the number of pancreatic Tregs in NOD mice at the
prediabetes stage by 1.5 times. This intervention prevent the
progression of T1D in 60% of the treated animals and restored blood
glucose levels to normalcy.497 Consequently, the targeted enhance-
ment of Tregs through low-dose IL-2 administration emerges as a
viable therapeutic approach.

adipocytes
serve
as
mediators
linking
obesity
and
insulin
resistance in peripheral tissues (such as the liver).498,499 EVs
facilitate communication between adipocytes and various cells
within adipose tissue. To give an example, adipocyte-derived EVs
can chemotactically attract monocytes, potentially leading to
adipose tissue inﬂammation in obese insulin-resistant animals and
humans.500,501 The formation of obesity and insulin resistance
correlates with an increased inﬁltration of macrophages into
adipose tissue.502 A vast body
of literature describes the
detrimental role of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) in
regulating systemic metabolism through the overproduction of
inﬂammatory
cytokines
that
can
block
insulin
signaling.503
Exosomes released by ATMs play a pivotal role in modulating
the functionality of adipose tissue and insulin sensitivity.504
Patient plasma and urine enrich the sources of EVs, and studies
suggest that EV miRNAs can serve as diagnostic tools for patients
with metabolic.472,477–479 and cardiovascular diseases.505,506 The
miRNA-155 is one of the miRNAs overexpressed in exosomes
derived from obese ATMs. Studies indicate that miRNA-155
regulates adipose tissue homeostasis by directly inhibiting the
adipogenic transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β
(CEBPβ).507 These ﬁndings shed light on the intricate signaling
networks between adipocytes, stromal vascular cells, and distant
organs in health and metabolic diseases.
Developmental disorders
In developmental studies, different developmental time points
or subpopulations can be chosen to study the dynamic interplay
among diverse cellular varieties. For example, the receptor-
ligand interactions analysis used to ﬁne-map mouse hair follicle
development indicated strong interactions between different
subgroups at different developmental time points.508 The
enriched receptor-ligand pairs of the same cell subgroups
demonstrated strong autocrine signals, suggesting the involve-
ment of robust intercellular communication in early hair follicle
development.508
In
addition,
intercellular
signaling
across
various cell types is essential for nervous system development,
and ligand engagement plays a pivotal role in these develop-
mental dynamics. Dysfunction of prefrontal cortex attributes to
cognitive deﬁcits and most neurodevelopmental disorders, so
the intrinsic development-dependent signals that regulate
neuron generation and circuit formation was unveiled, which
gives a blueprint for comprehending the development of the
human prefrontal cortex during the early and mid-gestational
periods.509
A recent study revealed that ﬁve speciﬁc ligands (TGFβ2,
NLGN1, TSLP, DKK1, and BMP4) have synergistic contributions on
the progression of astrocytes in both human cerebral organoids
and primary fetal tissues.510 Moreover, the synergistic impact of
these ligands predominantly targets the mTORC1 signaling path-
way, leading to the transcriptomics and morphological character-
istics of astrocyte development. Furthermore, reciprocal signaling
interactions between fetal germ cells (FGCs) and their gonadal
niche cells were observed, showing that the cell proliferation of
FGCs was promoted through BMP signaling pathway. Then, BMP
signaling pathway regulates the Wnt signaling pathway by
coordinating the chromatin accessibility of its ligand genes,
providing a comprehensive roadmap for germ cell development
in vivo physiologically.511,512 In addition, the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway plays critical roles in embryonic development and adult
tissue homeostasis.513 Furthermore, BMP signaling pathway plays
a
role
in
developmental
stage
dependence
and
cell-type
speciﬁcity in male germ cells.514 On the other hand, analyses of
PI3K signaling pathway unmasked the occurrence of speciﬁc CCCs
during the kidney development of the human fetus, especially the
interactions between reciprocal mesenchyme and epithelium
cells, which may help the appropriate collecting duct epithelial
cell morphogenesis.515
Other applications
Biological transport system.
The biological transport system plays
a vital role in living organisms and enables the effective
transmission and transportation of nutrients, gases, and informa-
tion, thereby maintaining the normal operation of life. Molecular
transportation in cells is mainly facilitated by protein channels and
transporters. Regarding protein channels, their selectivity and
effects on molecules can be further understood through the study
of the structure and activity of proteins. As one kind of channel
proteins that can transport glucose and other monosaccharides,
SLC2A4 has been found to be signiﬁcantly downregulated in most
cancers and its high mRNA expression is signiﬁcantly related to
improved prognoses in patients with breast cancer.516
For transporters, the main purpose of most research is to study
their selectivity and activity. For instance, Glut1, the glucose
transporter found in the caterpillar in Namibian Canyon, has been
reported to increase due to gene expression or protein stabiliza-
tion.517,518 Because they can maintain the energy needs of various
biochemical procedures in tumor cells, it is important for us to
understand how glucose intake of speciﬁc cell types affects the
behavior of neighboring cells in the same microenvironment.519 In
addition to intracellular transportation, extracellular transportation
also plays a vital role. Extracellular transportation includes the
exchange of substances between the matrix and extracellular
ﬂuids, the formation of extracellular matrices such as collagen
ﬁbers, and their role in tissue structure and cell life activities. The
ECM is composed of a protein called collagen, which can support
and protect cells, and promote interaction between cells.520 At the
same time, the ECM can also regulate physiological processes such
as signal transmission and the release of mediated factors in
cellular activities.
Biological transport system technology leverages cell signaling
molecules to regulate the transport and release drugs or other
active substances. This approach can enhance the effectiveness
and bioavailability of drugs, offering signiﬁcant potential in
disease treatment. For instance, cell signaling molecules can be
harnessed to induce cancer cell death. In addition, ROS, produced
during oxidative metabolism, serve as cell signaling molecules and
are implicated in numerous human pathologies.521 They maintain
biological system homeostasis through redox reactions and drive
cellular regulatory pathways through subsequent signaling.522 But
accumulation of excessive ROS promotes cell proliferation by
triggering the pathological alteration of normal signaling pro-
cesses, leading to the malignant transformation from normal cells.
However, over-activated ROS levels could induce cell death by
inﬂicting damage on cellular structures.522 Consequently, ther-
apeutic approaches aimed at reducing excessive ROS to avert
early tumorigenesis or enhancing ROS to selectively kill cancer
cells show potential in cancer treatment.
Prediction of drug side effects.
The study of CCC networks can
assist in predicting the side effects of drugs. For instance, certain
drugs work by activating or inhibiting speciﬁc signaling pathways,
which may be involved in various physiological processes and result
in adverse drug reactions. Various hormones, growth factors, and
cytokines regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. These
molecules engage with cellular receptors and interface with the
cell nucleus through a series of intracellular signal transduction
pathways. So when key components of these pathways undergo
alterations due to oncogene mutation or over-expression, cancer
cells emerge with disrupted cell signaling and uncontrolled cellular
growth. These key components mutated in cancer cells present
viable
selective targets
for innovative anticancer
treatments,
characterized by their tumor speciﬁcity and tolerable toxicity.523

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS FOR STUDYING CCC
Visualizing CCC
Imaging methods
Electron microscopy:
In the 1930s, the German scientist Ernst
Ruska discovered that electrons could be focused under a
magnetic ﬁeld, leading to the invention of the world’s ﬁrst
transmission electron microscope (EM). Currently, scientists have
invented cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) on top of transmis-
sion EM, achieving “near-atomic resolution” of biological mole-
cules, ﬁnally allowing humanity to glimpse how biological
molecules execute their functions. The basic principle of cryo-EM
technology involves placing a solution of biological macromole-
cules on an EM grid to form a very thin layer of water ﬁlm, which is
then rapidly frozen to liquid nitrogen temperature using cryo-
techniques. The freezing speed is so fast that the water ﬁlm does
not form crystals but instead forms a vitreous ice layer. Biological
macromolecules are immobilized within this thin layer of ice.
Observing such frozen samples at low temperatures under a
transmission electron microscope allows us to obtain the structure
of biological macromolecules.
The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is a transmem-
brane protein that facilitates swift cellular communication under
the inﬂuence of acetylcholine, an endogenous neurotransmitter.
As a typical transmembrane macromolecule, it has extensive
interactions with the surrounding lipid microenvironment. Recent
cryo-EM studies have unveiled the presence of phospholipid and
cholesterol sites within the lipid-exposed regions of neuronal and
electric organ nAChRs.524 These ﬁndings are consistent with
previous
spectroscopy
and
afﬁnity
labeling
studies,
which
suggested that lipid molecules closely interact with the trans-
membrane segments of the receptor. For example, electron spin
resonance (ESR) studies provided preliminary evidence of motion-
restricted lipids in contact with nAChRs in native torpedo
membranes.525–527 In subsequent ESR experiments using recom-
binant nAChRs, direct contact between the receptor and adjacent
or boundary lipids was conﬁrmed.528 The emerging data offers
structural
evidence
supporting
the
proposed
“lipid
sensor”
function of the outer loop of the M4 transmembrane domain
and its regulatory impact on nAChR functionality.
For another example, the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1
(TRPV1) channel is a multimodal receptor that can respond to
various stimuli, such as heat, capsaicin, and protons, making it a
crucial pain sensor and an effective target for anesthetic
drugs.529,530 With the employment of cryo-EM, the channel
structure of the membrane protein TRPV1 was resolved at near-
atomic resolution, along with its structure in complex with
capsaicin.531 As an extracellular chemical signal, capsaicin binds
to the membrane protein TRPV1 located at the nerve endings on
the tongue, opening a channel on the membrane protein that
allows ions to ﬂow from outside the cell membrane to the inside.
This ion movement, albeit minor, generates a current that is
ultimately transmitted to our brain through nerve ﬁbers, enabling
us to experience the sensation of spiciness.
CCC plays a pivotal role in the structuring and functionality of
cellular networks and multicellular systems.532 This intricate
network is coordinated by signals emanating from the micro-
environment, such as paracrine or autocrine actions of soluble
factors or stimuli mediated by substrates from the ECM.533,534 In
addition, direct CCC happens through structures such as gap
junctions and tunneling nanotubes (TNTs),535–537 which are thin
bridges formed by the cytoskeletal actin ﬁlaments, capable of
transferring cytoplasm and organelles between connected cells.538
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a crucial tool for directly
observing cell-to-cell TNTs.539,540 To date, a signiﬁcant number of
TNTs have been observed in single cells or three-dimensional
tumor cell aggregates.537,541,542 Mesenchymal stem cells have
been extensively studied due to their accessibility, multipotency,
and potential for anti-inﬂammatory and pro-angiogenic effects.
SEM was ﬁrst employed to investigate a large population of MSC’s
spheroids and revealed the presence of TNTs within homotypic
three-dimensional
clusters
formed
by
human
MSCs.
These
observations were facilitated through direct visualization using
SEM and laser scanning confocal microscopy.543
Optical microscopy:
EM imaging requires ﬁxed cells and special
treatments such as dehydration and embedding, making it
unsuitable for live-cell imaging, and whether the images obtained
can truly reﬂect the structural information in living cells is also
uncertain. Optical microscopes, along with various ﬂuorescence
microscopy imaging techniques developed later in combination
with ﬂuorescent labeling, are one of the indispensable means for
studying life sciences and biomedical issues at the cellular level. In
wide-ﬁeld epiﬂuorescence microscopy, spatial resolution is easily
distorted due to defocus blur, especially when ﬂuorescent
molecules are distributed in three dimensions and form densely
packed structures, as is typical with biological samples. Confocal
microscopy uses a pinhole to completely eliminate out-of-focus
blur, achieving optical sectioning.544 Two-photon microscopy
utilizes the two-photon absorption process to excite ﬂuorescent
molecules, where ﬂuorescence occurs only at the focal point of
the objective, thus providing an optical sectioning effect.545
However, the spatial resolution of such microscopy techniques is
still limited by diffraction. Therefore, advancements in the life
sciences urgently call for innovations that can unveil nanoscale
molecular dynamics and structural intricacies within living cells,
surpassing the diffraction limit to enhance the resolution of optical
microscopes.
As the ﬁrst far-ﬁeld microscopy imaging technique to break the
optical diffraction limit, stimulated emission depletion (STED)
microscopy achieves a three-dimensional resolution of 30–50 nm
through the use of nonlinear effects.546–548 Due to its high
temporal resolution and three-dimensional tomographic capabil-
ity, it represents an important direction in the development of
optical super-resolution techniques. Pellett et al. ﬁrst achieved
live-cell dual-color STED imaging and used improved SNAPf and
CLIPf labeling techniques to label EGF and EGFR for observing
their interactions.549 Furthermore, the use of STED-FCS (ﬂuores-
cence correlation spectroscopy) combined techniques to study
the interactions between membrane proteins or lipid molecules
has also become a hot topic in modern biological research.550,551
Optical activation
techniques,
including stochastic optical
reconstruction microscopy (STORM), have signiﬁcantly improved
the spatial and temporal resolution available for examining the
physical interactions between cells.24 STORM selectively activates
multiple photo-switchable ﬂuorescent groups to determine the
lateral position of each ﬂuorescent source, enabling the recon-
struction of individual images with nanoscale resolution.552 The
three-dimensional extension of STORM, known as 3D-STORM,
integrates enhanced axial resolution, offering a valuable tool for
probing the organization of proteins at the cell–cell interface
within dense tissues or environments characterized by numerous
uniform cell interactions.553 In brain tissue, this technique
facilitates
the
detailed
observation
of
the
organization
of
scaffolding
proteins
and
neurotransmitter
receptors
within
synapses.554
STED and STORM imaging techniques achieve high resolution;
however, a drawback is the requirement for intense excitation
light for illumination. In addition, the ﬂuorescent groups in the
specimen are quickly bleached, and the generated free radicals
have the potential to cause damage to the specimen. Therefore,
these imaging modes are more suitable for ﬁxed specimens rather
than for observing and studying live biological samples. Conse-
quently, another mode of achieving super-resolution imaging
through altering illumination has emerged.
Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) applies patterned
illumination ﬁelds instead of conventional wide-ﬁeld illumination,

improving the spatial resolution of optical microscopy and
providing beneﬁts for observing live cells.42 In optical microscopy,
the objective lens has a limited ability to collect high-frequency
information from the sample, resulting in the loss of such details
during imaging. SIM technology addresses this limitation by using
Moiré fringes to transfer these high-frequency details, which
exceed the lens’s collection capacity, to the low-frequency range.
This enables the microscope to capture information that was
previously unattainable. By applying speciﬁc image algorithms to
process this combined low-frequency and high-frequency data,
SIM produces super-resolution images that are approximately
twice as detailed as those obtained through traditional optical
microscopy.42,43 Because of its quick imaging speed, minimal
phototoxicity, and broad dye compatibility, SIM is highly appro-
priate for prolonged monitoring of dynamic events in living cells.
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer.
Fluorescence resonance
energy
transfer
(FRET)
is
the
mechanism
used
to
detect
interactions between two biomolecules, allowing for the inference
of their spatial proximity. This process involves the transfer of
energy from an excited donor ﬂuorophore (D) to a compatible
acceptor (A) protein or ﬂuorophore through a non-radiative
means. The donor absorbs energy at shorter wavelengths, while
the acceptor absorbs energy at longer wavelengths.555,556 This
process only occurs when the two molecules are in very close
proximity, a distance that is associated with the formation of
complexes and conformational changes involving most biomole-
cules or their constituent domains.557 When the distance is less
than 1 nm, the donor and acceptor collide, and when the distance
is greater than 10 nm, the donor emits photons. Therefore, FRET
only occurs in the near ﬁeld, within a range of 1–10 nm.558,559
When two closely positioned molecules are ﬂuorescent sub-
stances, the observable effects of FRET will manifest in the spectral
properties of these ﬂuorescent dyes, including alterations in
ﬂuorescence intensity, ﬂuorescence lifetime, quantum efﬁciency,
and anisotropy.560,561
FRET is exceptionally well-suited for measuring a wide range of
dynamic molecular events, including the conformational altera-
tions of macromolecules, both cis and trans binding and/or
assembly of macromolecules, as well as the modulation of
physiological events across both in vitro and in vivo settings.556
Traditional optical microscopes are constrained by lateral diffrac-
tion to a spatial resolution of ~250 nm, a scale that exceeds the
average size of protein molecules by several orders of magnitude
within a range of a few nanometers.562 This makes it difﬁcult to
predict whether two molecules are interacting in an image
obtained by traditional microscopy. In contrast, utilizing FRET
increases the accuracy of molecular colocalization within the
diffraction limit. In principle, any instrument capable of recording
ﬂuorescence emission can be used to measure FRET, given the
presence of appropriate ﬂuorophores along with corresponding
ﬁlters and detectors. Therefore, early FRET experiments were
primarily
conducted
using
ﬂuorescence
spectroscopy,563–565
which gradually evolved to ﬂow cytometry564,566,567 and various
microscopes,564,568–571 and later developed into laser scanning
cytometry.572–574 FRET allows researchers to directly observe
interactions between speciﬁc proteins within living cells, which is
crucial for understanding intracellular signaling networks. FRET is
used to study single-molecule interactions,575 within living cells,576
and even across entire tissues.577
FRET probes have been developed to probe various processes
in cellular signal transduction.578,579 These powerful approaches
allow for in vivo imaging across systems ranging from Caenor-
habditis elegans to transgenic mouse models expressing FRET
probes.580–582 Imaging methods for measuring FRET encompass
epiﬂuorescence and confocal microscopy on ex vivo tissues, skin
samples, or isolated vessels and/or tissue specimens, extending to
multiphoton imaging within intact tissues.581–584 In addition,
lifetime FRET measurements were achieved based on multiphoton
imaging and ﬂuorescence through a cranial window in mouse
models of the nervous system.585 The potential of utilizing FRET-
based probes in combination with in vitro cell cultures, ex vivo
tissue preparations, and in vivo model systems for investigating
cellular signaling systems is highly compelling.
Cell surface detection methods.
In supported planar lipid bilayers
(SLBs), ﬂuorescently labeled proteins are incorporated into the
lipid bilayer to facilitate imaging of protein movement and
organization, thereby enabling tracking throughout the entire CCC
process.586 SLBs have evolved into a platform for studying
molecular patterns.587–589 Using SLB techniques, it is possible to
measure the two-dimensional afﬁnity and kinetic rates of contact
areas, thereby providing a quantitative basis for understanding
the interactions within contact zones.590 Besides, GRASP is a
protein complementation strategy that fuses two nonﬂuorescent
fragments of GFP to interacting partners on opposing cells to
detect CCCs. When cells are in close contact with each other, the
split protein fragments associate and reassemble into GFP.45
GRASP has been applied to study both pre- and postsynaptic
interactions, enabling the analysis of connectivity and the
distribution of inhibitory and excitatory synapses in mouse
hippocampal neurons.591 This approach has been expanded to
include other split ﬂuorescent protein fragments, such as YFP
(yellow) and CFP (cyan), allowing for simultaneous imaging of
multiple synaptic interaction factors.46
Another reported strategy for monitoring interacting cellular
partners involves a chemo-genetic system that utilizes ﬂuorogen-
activating protein (FAP) in combination with a dye activated by
proximal anchoring (DAPA), which is composed of malachite
green and chloroalkane.592 FAPs serve as a fusion protein tool that
acts as a ﬂuorescent marker by binding to nonﬂuorescent dyes
known as ﬂuorogens.593 Malachite green is displayed on cells
expressing HaloTag through attachment with chloroalkane, and
when it comes into contact with adjacent cells expressing FAP, the
contact between cells is reported through enhanced ﬂuorescence.
When ﬂuorogens bind to FAP, this ﬂuorescent readout can target
different subcellular locations.594 and be expressed in various
model species.595–598 Furthermore, enzyme-based ampliﬁcation
methods have also contributed to enhancing the visualization of
CCCs.599,600
Chemically tagging CCCs
Contact-dependent tagging.
Contact-dependent labeling techni-
ques necessitate the physical interaction between an enzyme
presented on the surface of one cell and a receptor substrate on a
neighboring cell to facilitate cell-to-cell proximity labeling.24 The
labeling immune partnerships by sortagging intercellular contacts
(LIPSTIC)
utilizes
a modiﬁed
sortase
enzyme
derived
from
Staphylococcus aureus (SrtA) that can be fused to a cell surface
ligand. This enzyme transfers a biotinylated substrate to a
pentaglycine receptor peptide present on a matching receptor
of adjacent cells, enabling the identiﬁcation of receptor-ligand
interactions within living animal cells. LIPSTIC has successfully
facilitated the direct biotinylation of various ligand–receptor pairs
(LRPs) by exploiting physical interactions.601 So LIPSTIC allows for
the direct measurement of dynamic CCCs both in vitro and in vivo.
Through the application of LIPSTIC, it has been shown that the
interactions between dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells during T-cell
priming in vivo through two distinct phases: an initial, cognate
stage marked by CD40–CD40L interactions unique to T cells and
antigen-presenting dendritic cells, and a subsequent, non-cognate
stage where these interactions no longer require prior activation
of the T-cell receptor.601
Another technique called enzyme-mediated cellular proximity
labeling (EXCELL), which is based on a similar sortase enzyme
mechanism, utilizes an enhanced form of the Staphylococcus

aureus transpeptidase sortase A enzyme (mgSrtA).602 This variant
has the ability to covalently tag a range of cell surface proteins
that contain a single glycine residue at their terminus. This
technique enables high-resolution imaging of CCCs, allowing for
in-depth examination of the molecular composition and structure
at the contact sites. It also minimizes perturbation to the natural
state of cells, ensuring that the observed interactions closely
resemble physiological conditions. By avoiding the need for pre-
installation of oligoglycine, EXCELL holds the potential to detect
novel cell interactions.602 In particular, it has been used to monitor
CCCs in living mice since the small pentapeptide “LPETG” can be
easily conjugated with other molecules.601 In short, EXCELL could
become a powerful tool for detecting and discovering CCCs in
more complex in vivo environments.
The necessity of genetically incorporating labeling enzymes
might pose a signiﬁcant obstacle to the widespread application of
these methodologies in the comprehensive study of CCCs.
Interaction-dependent fucosylation
(FucoID)
circumvents
this
challenge by autonomously anchoring the labeling enzyme
Helicobacter pylori α1,3-fucosyltransferase onto the cell surface.603
The efﬁcacy of immunotherapies aimed at bolstering endogenous
T-cell immunity hinges upon the T cells’ capacity to identify
tumor-speciﬁc antigens (TSAs).604 In the quest to expedite
advancements in cancer immunotherapy, the development of a
computation-free methodology that enables the swift identiﬁca-
tion of TSA-reactive T cells, and is straightforward to implement, is
highly desirable. FucoID emerges as a pivotal innovation, capable
of identifying endogenous tumor antigen-speciﬁc T cells through
interaction-dependent fucosylation without prior knowledge of
TSA identity. Employing this approach facilitates the isolation of
TSA-reactive CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and TSA-suppressive CD4+ T cells
within tumors.603 This technique exhibits wide-ranging utility
across multiple mouse tumor models characterized by observable
T-cell inﬁltration, underscoring its signiﬁcant testing prospects in
clinical scenarios.
Contact-independent tagging.
Non-contact techniques, in con-
trast to contact-dependent labeling methods, generate highly
reactive
labels
capable
of
diffusing
beyond
the
catalyst’s
immediate vicinity. Proximity labeling provides a method to
capture the immediate biochemical environment of proteins
in situ, thereby preserving key spatial and temporal contexts.605
When integrated with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics,
these approaches enable the elucidation of the proteomic
landscape of spatially restricted cell–cell interfaces. This integra-
tion provides critical insights into the manner in which the
structural organization of proteins affects the functional con-
sequences of CCCs.24
APEX has been used to capture the entire organellar proteome
with high temporal resolution and has become an important tool
for proximity labeling. In the presence of H2O2, APEX converts
biotin-phenol (BP) labels into short-lived (t1/2 ≈100 μs) reactive
phenoxy radicals, marking neighboring proteins on tyrosine and
other electron-rich amino acid side chains in the mitochondrial
matrix.606
For
example,
combining
proximity
labeling
with
quantitative proteomics can capture the location and timing of
GPCR function in living cells.606
The well-known proximity labeling method BioID utilizes a BirA
ligase mutant (BirA*) to biotinylate proximal proteins.607 In the
presence of ATP, BirA* catalyzes the conversion of biotin into
active biotin-AMP, which then reacts with nearby nucleophilic
lysine side chains. The BioID method is primarily used to identify
intracellular binding partners,605 including the cytoplasmic region
of cadherins.608–610 and other adhesion proteins.611 BioID fused to
the extracellular domain of N-cadherin (Ncad) has also identiﬁed
proteins secreted by rat neurons.612 By combining proximity
labeling with single-molecule binding analysis, previously undi-
sclosed direct connections have been unveiled between the
extracellular domains of numerous transmembrane proteins and
E-cadherin (an essential cell–cell adhesion protein).613 As the
labeling efﬁciency with BirA* was found to be slow (taking
18–24 h), a more rapid system called TurboID was created, capable
of completing labeling in a mere 10 min.614 The TurboID
technique has been employed to identify proteins at epithelial
cell junctions by fusing the enzyme with the extracellular domain
of E-cadherin.613
Mechanical force analysis
Although the shape of organisms is encoded in their genomes,
the information coded by DNA is not enough to rule the ultimate
architecture of tissues and organs, nor can the cell expression
proﬁles tell us how complex functions are achieved. The
developmental trajectories culminating in the deﬁnitive morphol-
ogy of vertebrates involve continuous feedback between dynamic
mechanical forces along with cell growth and movement.
Mechanical forces are ruled by cells and integrated into tissues
through mechanotransduction processes that affect cell shape,
proliferation, migration, and programmed cell death, collectively
sculpting the ﬁnal form of organism.615 The core of these
processes is primarily the myosin motors, and the quasi-stable
state of cell tension is maintained by these myosin contraction
force mechanosensors, allowing cells to deﬁne the shape and
tension of organs.615 The initial discovery that cancer cells can
grow in soft agar in an anchorage-independent manner,616,617
while most noncancer cells cannot, sparked interest in the role of
mechanotransduction at the cellular level. Red blood cells
exposed to anionic and cationic drugs undergo different changes
in intracellular and extracellular surface membrane tension,
resulting in modiﬁcations to cell morphology.618 This observation
implies the presence of a cellular mechanism capable of detecting
changes in membrane tension, which was subsequently demon-
strated to be crucial for cell spreading and migration.619
Cell migration plays a crucial role in many physiological and
pathological processes such as morphogenesis,620 wound heal-
ing,621 and tumor metastasis.622 In turn, migration involves a
coordinated
series
of
events,
including
the
protrusion
of
pseudopodia, formation of new adhesions, development of
traction forces, and release of old adhesions.623 To achieve
appropriate physiological outcomes, cell movement must main-
tain a certain direction and speed in response to environmental
stimuli. Traction force microscopy (TFM) is a technique used to
measure the forces exerted by cells on their substrate.624–626 It is
based on the principle that cells generate traction forces on their
attached substrate during migration, extension, or contraction.
One can infer the magnitude and direction of the forces exerted
by the cells by observing the minute deformations on the cell-
attached substrate. However, TFM is limited by poor resolution,
typically conﬁned to detecting forces on a micrometer scale.627,628
Therefore, a strategy has been proposed to enhance the output of
TFM by increasing the achievable head density and the accuracy
of head tracking.629–631 This involves combining an algorithm for
ﬂuctuation-based super-resolution (FBSR) imaging with software-
enabled super-resolution microscopy. Through the analysis of
ﬂuorescence group intensity ﬂuctuations, this approach allows for
the resolution of densely packed beads and signiﬁcantly improves
the traction force output.632
The arrangement of intermolecular forces in space dictates the
interplay among macromolecules, with both long-range and
short-range interactions playing pivotal roles in the dynamic
behavior of biological systems and their assemblies.633 Atomic
force microscopy (AFM) is a high-resolution scanning probe
microscope used to study the interaction forces between objects
at the nanoscale.625,626,634,635 AFM enables a direct measurement
of intercellular interactions by delicately contacting the probe with
the
cell
surface
and
subsequently
capturing
the
force-
displacement curve as the probe interacts with the cell surface.

The method for examining the spatial distribution of forces within
a volume using AFM involves collecting a series of force curves on
the surface and assembling them into a “force volume” (FV).633
Radmacher et al. used the Hertz model to analyze the FV images
of platelets and constructed the ﬁrst cell mechanical properties
map based on AFM.636 A similar methodology was employed to
investigate the contribution of the actin cytoskeleton to the local
mechanical characteristics of cardiomyocytes.637 and macro-
phages.638 However, achieving atomic resolution imaging has
long been challenging when nanoscale manipulation under
different environments becomes routine. The initial deﬁciency
was due to the contact with the sample dulling the atomic tip,
which is essential for successful atomic resolution imaging.639
With the introduction of non-contact atomic force microscopy
(NC-AFM), this issue was ﬁnally overcome. In NC-AFM, the
cantilever oscillates near the surface of the sample without
actually “touching” it, allowing the preservation of the tip’s atomic
sharpness while quantifying the tip-sample distance using the
changes in the cantilever’s resonance frequency caused by
interactions.639 The latest progress in high-speed atomic force
microscopy (HS-AFM) has enabled the examination of conforma-
tional dynamics in individual unlabeled transmembrane channels
and transporters. The progress in HS-AFM now allows not only for
the detection of faster dynamics but also provides sub-molecular
structural information in real space,640–643 signiﬁcantly improving
temporal resolution.644 The emergence of HS-AFM, characterized
by unprecedented scanning rates, results from a blend of diverse
technological advancements. These include enhancements in
cantilever
beams,
sample
stage
scanners,
cantilever
beam
deﬂection detection, and feedback systems.645 HS-AFM imaging
has succeeded in applying to various biological systems, such as
molecular motors,641 membrane-associated proteins,646 macro-
molecular systems,647 and protein–DNA complexes.648
DOWNSTREAM ANALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
Research on molecules in signaling pathways that play a key role
in regulating growth and development has revealed that the
response process is not the result of a single pathway’s action but
rather the result of crosstalk between different pathways.649
Accurate signal transduction requires crosstalk between various
pathways, further forming complex intracellular signaling net-
works. Cellular signal transduction begins at the cell membrane,
propagates through the cytoplasm, and ultimately regulates gene
expression patterns deep within the nucleus. This process is
mediated
by
a
series
of
typically
weak
and
transient
protein–protein interactions, enabling cells to rapidly adapt to
changing environmental conditions.650 To fulﬁll their critical roles
in cellular processes, these proteins interact with each other stably
or transiently, forming a vast network.651,652 The application of
proteomics and cell manipulation techniques in cell signal
transduction research provides important means for revealing
complex intracellular signaling networks and identifying signal
molecule
complexes.
They
also
enable
exploration
of
the
molecular basis of protein–protein interactions, discovery of new
partner molecules, and study of the crosstalk between known
pathways and the dynamic changes in cell signal transduction.
Co-immunoprecipitation
Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) is one of the strongest methods
for identifying physical interactions between two or more proteins
in vivo.653–655 It is a technique where antibodies are used to
precipitate
a
speciﬁc
molecule,
and
other
molecules
that
speciﬁcally bind to that molecule are co-precipitated along with
it. This technique is commonly used to verify the speciﬁc binding
between proteins.656 Co-IP is able to identify protein interactions
involved in the cell communication process, including interactions
between receptors and ligands, signal transduction molecules,
and the activation of effector proteins. These interactions form the
basis of how cells respond to external signals and trigger internal
responses. Protein interactions, forming complexes of varying
sizes, exhibit spatiotemporal dependency.657 The execution of
speciﬁc protein functions strongly relies on contact with the
surfaces of neighboring proteins. Most processes demand direct
contact between proteins, either in binary form or as part of large
complexes involving multiple proteins.658 Co-IP can identify
protein complexes formed under speciﬁc cellular states or
conditions, thereby revealing key participants in the cell commu-
nication process. In most cases, these in vitro binding assays are
combined with MS. A previous study utilized the Co-IP/MS method
to identify BMPR-1B protein–protein interactions (PPIs). In addi-
tion, the signal pathway of the target protein was analyzed, and
bioinformatics prediction indicated that BMPR-1B interacts with
ovulation-promoting proteins in ewe ovaries.659 As a transmem-
brane protein, BMPR-1B mediates signal transduction between the
intracellular and extracellular compartments by participating in
vital activities and substance exchange.660
In addition, Co-IP technology can be used to explore unknown
protein interactions, thereby discovering new signaling molecules
and pathways involved in cell communication. Through Co-IP and
GST pull-down assays, Angiogenin (ANG) was reported for the ﬁrst
time to interact with ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) both endogen-
ously and exogenously.661 Upregulating ANG, including the ANG
His37Ala mutant, signiﬁcantly decreased RI expression and
activated phosphorylation of key downstream target molecules
of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.661–663 This discovery led
to the promotion of tumor angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and
metastasis in vivo, highlighting a novel mechanism of ANG in
regulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway via RI. There-
fore, PPIs play a crucial role in almost every cellular process since
they dictate the speciﬁcity of signal transduction, control the
strength and duration of signals, and integrate various signaling
pathways to orchestrate intricate cellular responses.664. In turn,
understanding PPIs will help elucidate the pathophysiology and
progression of many diseases.665
Functional exploitation
Although the previously mentioned methods are adept at
identifying
proteins
in
close
proximity
and
potential
ligand–receptor pairs, further approaches are necessary to explore
and interfere protein functions at the cell–cell interface. Cell
manipulation techniques that induce the loss, obtainment, or
modiﬁcation of protein functionalities offer a direct avenue for
investigating ligand–receptor interactions or the ensuing signaling
pathways. This approach helps in gaining insights into the types of
cellular interactions that take place, the consequences of these
interactions,
and
how
to
leverage
them
by
manipulating
transcriptional programs.24 These methods, by altering cell
behavior, communication modes, or environmental response
capabilities, play a crucial role in both basic research and clinical
applications.
CRISPR-Cas9 screening has been employed to comprehend the
functional roles of proteins implicated in the evasion, recognition,
and clearance of cancer cells during the adaptive immune
system.24 Alterations in somatic genes can modify the suscept-
ibility of cancer cells to T-cell-based immunotherapy. To identify
proteins in tumor cells that regulate and/or are sensitive to T-cell
effector functions, a dual-cell-type CRISPR (2CT-CRISPR) screening
method was devised for conducting loss-of-function analyses.666
Interferon-gamma
(IFN-γ)
driven
phosphorylation
of
JAK1 stimulates the JAK-STAT signaling cascade to enhance
antigen processing and presentation in tumors, thereby enhan-
cing T-cell recognition and cytolysis.667 Utilizing a co-culture
system of IFN-γ signaling-deﬁcient tumor cells and T cells, CRISPR-
Cas9 screening identiﬁed several genes within the TNF signaling
pathway as critical to rendering tumor cells vulnerable to T-cell-

mediated eradication, thereby unveiling potential targets for
alternative immune therapeutic pathways.668
Activation of downstream biological processes mediated by the
cell surface can also be achieved through the engineering
expression of receptors and/or ligands on the cell surface.
Synthetic
Notch
(synNotch)
receptors
provide
extraordinary
ﬂexibility in engineered cells, allowing for the customization of
sensing/response behaviors based on user-speciﬁed extracellular
signals.669–671 SynNotch receptors are engineered to incorporate
the core regulatory domains of the Notch cell–cell signaling
receptor, but with synthetic extracellular recognition domains
(such as single-chain antibodies) and synthetic intracellular
transcriptional domains.669,672 This Notch intracellular domain
acts as a transcriptional regulator, operational only after its release
from the membrane and enable it to enter the cell nucleus to
activate genes pivotal for cell–cell signaling during developmental
processes.673 These synthetic Notch receptors are versatile,
functioning across various cell types, including immune cells
and neurons. The deployment of multiple synthetic Notch
pathways is allowed within the same cell and used to design
complex combinatorial sensing circuits. The ﬂexibility of synthetic
Notch receptors in engineering new cell behaviors makes them a
powerful tool for constructing therapeutic cells, driving the
formation of complex multicellular patterns, or regulating or
reporting cell behavior in complex in vivo environments.669
Natural T-cell response programs lack certain desirable character-
istics.674 To give an example, even when redirected to identify
tumors, T cells have limited ability to overcome the immunosup-
pressive microenvironment of tumors.675 But T cells engineered
with synthetic Notch receptors exhibit robust and ﬁnely tunable
customized functionalities. In addition, T cells equipped with
synthetic Notch circuits can precisely home in on solid tumors,
enabling the localized delivery of their tailored potent payloads
within the body.670 (Fig. 4).
COMPUTATIONAL METHODS FOR INFERRING CCC
Using single-cell omics data, various bioinformatics and computa-
tional methods have been developed to decipher biological
CCCs.676 (Table 2). Scientiﬁc research commonly adopts two
principal approaches: ligand–receptor (LR) signal-based algorithm
and physical location-oriented strategy.7 The availability of single-
cell data, particularly transcriptome data, has led to the develop-
ment of plenty of computational tools for deciphering CCC (Fig. 5).
These tools leverage diverse methods for predicting potential
intercellular communication events (CEs) based on prior knowl-
edge of CCCs.4 Various mediators facilitate the development of
tools for CCC analysis, including Ca2+,677 lipids,678 peptides,679
proteins,680 EVs,681 and electrical signals. These developed tools
for CCC analysis utilize different media, algorithms, and data types
to infer CCC, leading to the discovery of different types of CCCs
based on different principles and resulting in various visualizations
(Fig. 6).
Single-cell transcriptome-based tools
Single-cell transcriptome technology conducts large-scale detec-
tion of gene expression in a single cell and accurately reveals the
activity of transcription factors (TFs) of each cell, which provides
great support for an in-depth understanding of cell differentiation,
development, and metabolism. The rapid development of single-
cell transcriptomics technology, such as Drop-seq, inDrop,682,683
CITE-seq,684 10X Genomics,685 providing with a deeper and
comprehensive understanding in many ﬁelds of life sciences.
Several strategies have been employed to construct cellular
communication networks based on LRIs using single-cell tran-
scriptome data.7 Tools analyzing cellular communication based on
single-cell transcriptome data are primarily limited to intercellular
communication mediated by protein ligand–receptor complexes,
and
their
analysis
relies
on
gene
expression
level
and
ligand–receptor databases.9 This limitation signiﬁcantly increased
false-positive predictions of CCC.686 Absence of expression in any
subunit impedes the inference of interaction between ligand and
receptor and the subsequent communication.687 So currently
developed computational approaches can be classiﬁed into four
types, dependent on the mathematical frameworks for pinpoint-
ing LRIs, including (1) expression permutation-based tools, (2)
difference-assembly-based tools, (3) network-based tools, and (4)
tensor-based tools.5
Expression
permutation-based
tools.
Expression
permutation-
based tools employ various methods to calculate communication
scores for each LRP and evaluate the comparative signiﬁcance to a
null model using clustering label arrangement, non-parametric
testing, or empirical methods. Examples include CellPhoneDB,688
CellChat,686 ICELLNET,689 SingleCellSignalR,690 CellCall,691 and
NATMI.692 Notably, CellPhoneDB, CellChat, and ICELLNET consider
multisubunit complexes for ligands and receptors.5
CellPhoneDB is at the forefront of heteromer modeling,
recognizing
that
numerous
receptors
and
ligands
operate
exclusively as heteromers. It stands out for its comprehensive
cellular communication ligand–receptor database, which includes
receptors and ligands annotated by public sources and speciﬁc
families of hand-selected proteins involved in cell communication.
However, the database does not encompass all potential LRIs and
neglects other vital signaling cofactors which CellChat integrates,
such as soluble agonists, antagonists, and both stimulatory and
inhibitory membrane-bound co-receptors.693
CellChat facilitates the analysis of intercellular interactions and
communication networks by providing cell interaction network
diagrams and communication pathway analysis. It has expanded
its coverage to include 229 signaling pathways, classiﬁed into
three categories: contact between cells, receptors in the ECM, and
signaling via secretion,686 a notable expansion from the approx-
imate 900 LRPs featured in CellPhoneDB. CellPhoneDB infers the
enriched LR interplays among the two cellular groups rooted in
pronounced speciﬁcity, while CellChat emphasizes differential
overexpressed ligands and receptors to measure the association
between LRPs under the principle of mass action.
ICELLNET calculates an overall CCC score by summing all LRI
production scores across two clusters. Meanwhile, it determines
interactions through the multiplication of geometric averages
from expressions of both ligands and receptors.689 Notably, with
the exception in a singular research work,694 ICELLNET stands as
the sole database that classiﬁes predicted interactions into
biological families.689 Despite ICELLNET having fewer interactions
than its counterparts, it boasts precise and intricate cytokine
interactions, extending timely to all chemokines and checkpoint
interactions, thereby offering distinct resources for investigating
intercellular communication in the immune system. For example,
it contains 14 cytokine interactions not included in CellPhoneDB,
for instance, MIF/CXCR2 and MIF/CXCR4.695
Analogous to CellPhoneDB, SingleCellSignalR introduces a
notion of interaction score.696 that is deﬁned as the function of
the average expression of ligands in type A cells and receptors in
type B cells. SingleCellSignalR relies on a new curated LR database
and uses regularized expression products to deduce the under-
lying LRIs within cellular networks. Although the false-positive
results are able to be avoided through using the permutation test
that utilized in CellPhoneDB, highly representative communica-
tions in the dataset may not be statistically signiﬁcant. To solve it,
a
deﬁnitive
cut-off
value
for
scoring
score
is
offered
in
SingleCellSignalR, capable of attaining a suitable error discovery
rate grounded in empirical evidence.5
CellCall is a toolkit that can deduce both intercellular and
intracellular communication routes by amalgamating coupled LRIs
and TF activity. Distinguished from scoring method of cellular

interactions in SingleCellSignalR and CellPhoneDB, the algorithm
of CellCall uses the expression information of the RegB regulon
which are target genes activated by the co-expressed TF.696
Furthermore, CellCall utilizes an integrated pathway activity
analysis technique to pinpoint notably active pathways in
intercellular dialog among distinct cell types. However, CellCall
focuses exclusively on the downstream gene regulatory networks
(GRNs) related to LRIs. It primarily focuses on LRPs comprising
protein-based partners, thereby neglecting non-peptidic entities
like lipids, small molecules, nucleic acid ligands, and carbohy-
drates.691 In short, CellCall and SingleCellSignalR can detect a large
number of communications, including nonspeciﬁc communica-
tions, but may miss low-intensity communications.690
NATMI can be used to summarize the complete network of
communication
to
display
the
communication
intensity
or
speciﬁcity between each cell type and other cell type in complex
samples, so as to identify highly communicative cell pairs or
speciﬁc communities.692 It uses connectomeDB2020 or user-
deﬁned LRPs to forecast and visualize cell communication network
between cell types in datasets.
These
expression
permutation-based
tools,
as
mentioned
above, typically solve the limitation that most CCC tools do not
consider multisubunit protein complexes.
Difference-assembly-based
tools.
Several
difference-assembly-
based tools have been developed, including PyMINEr,697 iTALK,694
and CellTalker.698 PyMINEr and iTALK aimed to identify the
differential expression genes between cellular clusters and used
them as candidates for the ﬁnal LR pair interactions. PyMINEr
establishes gene co-expression networks ascertained through
Spearman correlation and integrates them with protein–protein
interaction networks.697 Unlike SingleCellSignalR, which depends
on genetic signatures for conducting cell-type identiﬁcation,690
PyMINEr’s characteristic gene signature is not provided. Instead, its
approach to delineating cell types hinges upon the enrichment of
subgroup-speciﬁc gene pathways. Actually, PyMINEr identiﬁes
altered signaling pathways based on differentially expressed pairs
of ligands and receptors. But iTALK categorizes LRPs into
cytokines, growth factors, immune checkpoints, and others,
focusing solely on communication between tumor cells and
normal
cells.694
In
contrast,
CellTalker
identiﬁes
unique
interactions between clusters by using differentially expressed
ligands and receptors within individual clusters.698 It assumes
cellular communication hinges on the uniform expression of
ligands and receptors among interacting cells. In short, CellTalker
and iTALK employ slightly different downstream analysis techni-
ques to assemble the deﬁnitive roster of pivotal interacting LRPs.
However, these methods may overlook common interactions
among all groups though they excel at identifying LRIs within the
dataset’s background.
Network-based analysis tools.
The network approach is utilized by
several tools, leveraging gene connectivity properties. Intercellular
communication encompasses intercellular signaling, intracellular
transmission, and signal ampliﬁcation through speciﬁc signaling
pathways. These pathways often result in activity changes of
downstream
TF
and
GRNs.699,700
Various
approaches
have
considered intracellular signaling to tackle these complexities,
including CCCExplorer,701 NicheNet,699 scMLnet,702 SoptSC,703
Scriabin,704 CytoTalk,705 RNA-Magnet,706 and ContactTracing.707
CCCExplorer builds a comprehensive graph depicting various
signaling pathways and computes a statistic akin to Fisher’s
method by employing the expression of ligands, receptors, and
downstream TFs to pinpoint key interactions.701 It incorporates
differentially expressed genes and PPI networks to analyze
downstream targets and TFs to determine signal events of cell
activation or inactivation. Because a functional understanding of
CCC requires knowledge about the effect of ligand on receptor’s
gene expression, the expression data of interacting cells is needed
to infer the effect of sender-cell ligands on the expression of
receptor cell.
To address this problem, a computational method called
NicheNet has been developed by integrating data from various
sources, including ligand–receptor relationships, signaling path-
ways, and transcriptional regulatory relationships. It can directly
output the inter-relationships among ligands, receptors, and
target genes.699 Since the prior model of ligand-target regulation
potential mainly relies on prior network information instead of
expression relationships in speciﬁc cells, the construction of
context-dependent multilayer, intercellular and intracellular sig-
naling networks is needed to deeply understand CCC through
single-cell gene expressions functionally.702

The availability of single-cell transcriptome data and single-cell spatial transcriptome data, have led to the development of plenty of computational tools for reasoning about CCC. These tools leverage diverse
methods for predicting potential intercellular communication events based on prior knowledge of ligand–receptor interactions

Thus, another tool named scMLnet has been developed using
speciﬁc type of cell gene expression, prior network information,
and statistical inference. This approach can not only model
communications and GRNs among cells, but also infer how
intracellular
gene
expression
is
affected
by
the
cellular
interactions.708
Different from most methods which have tried to predict CCC
between various cellular clusters, SoptSC enables to decipher the
interactions between individual cells.703 In SoptSC, individual cell
CCC probabilities are calculated using nonlinear functions invol-
ving the products of ligand and receptor expressions, where
target gene responses can be weighed. However, it could not
automatically detect disconnected lineages and infer bidirectional
arrows for certain cell state transitions.703
Similar to SoptSC, Scriabin is a ﬂexible and computationally
effective approach for analyzing communication pathways using
single-cell level information.704 It utilizes comprehensive data-
bases of curated LRIs,688,700,709 intracellular signaling and anchor
points to analyze gene networks.710 It should be noted that this
method assumes the consistent credibility of LRPs within expertly
curated protein–protein interaction repositories. Downstream
signaling analyses in Scriabin are dependent on NicheNet’s matrix
of ligand-target activities, potentially inﬂuenced by the speciﬁc
cell types and stimulation conditions employed in its creation. In
addition, NicheNet’s database lacks capabilities for analyzing
inhibitory signaling, leading Scriabin to primarily return CCC edges
that are anticipated to activate signals.704
In addition, CytoTalk initially builds a comprehensive network
containing both intracellular and intercellular communications.
Compared with NicheNet and SoptSC, the differential expression
of downstream pathway genes is more signiﬁcant from CytoTalk
prediction. Unlike the previous methods using known pathway
annotations,699,703 CytoTalk is able to construct signal transduc-
tion pathways from scratch and compare them in different tissues
or conditions, representing a signiﬁcant improvement over
existing algorithms.705
Moreover, RNA-Magnet utilizes fuzzy logic for the identiﬁcation
of active ligands and receptors in cellular communication.5 This
method forecasts potential physical interactions among individual
cells and chosen attractor groups by integrating the expression
patterns of cell surface receptors with their corresponding surface-
expressed mRNA.688,711,712 RNA-Magnet assigns scores to indicate
the degree of attraction for each cell, along with a direction
showing the attractor group to which the cell is primarily drawn. It
has been reported that the RNA-Magnet algorithm can accurately
infer the three-dimensional organization of bone marrow from the
expression data of single-cell genes.713 However, RNA-Magnet
may have limitations with only heterodimer receptor information
for integrins in early version and the installation process may
involve multiple dependencies which may be challenging for
some users.706
Furthermore, ContactTracing represents an innovative systemic
method to forecast the impact of condition-dependent cellular
interactions within TME.707 This method analyzes TME along with
varying levels of chromosomal instability by utilizing the inherent
variability
of
scRNA-seq
data
to
infer
cell
responses
to
ligand–receptor-mediated interactions, independent of previously
existing downstream target gene knowledge.707
The advantage of these network-based methods lies in their
utilization of ligand and receptor expression levels to calculate
interaction score and altered expression of downstream signaling
targets. However, such approaches have limitations in addressing
signal crosstalk, which may result in the occurrence of false-
positive
or
negative
outcomes,
especially
in
cases
where

intracellular pathways are modulated through posttranslational
modiﬁcations instead of transcriptional regulation, as observed in
certain cytokine signaling pathways.714
Tensor-based analysis tools.
Tools based on tensor analysis
constitute the group with the highest mathematical complexity.
For instance, scTensor is an innovative approach for deriving
representative triadic relationships, encompassing ligand expres-
sion, receptor expression, and associated LRPs. One of its
attractive features is that LR reference is available for many
organisms. This approach utilizes Tucker decomposition on a
third-order tensor to pinpoint key ligand–receptor interactions
(LRIs) that are speciﬁc to particular cell types.715 The scTensor
utilizes a potential LRP database automatically generated by
interactions
from
STRING
and
annotations
from
Swissprot
(secreted/membrance), and revealed a signiﬁcant quantity of
presumed LR pairs. The CCC network is constructed as a directed
hypergraph with multiple edge types representing different LRPs.
Tensor decomposition is used to model these interactions and
calculate their scores.715 Although these tools can capture
communication pathways involving all cell pairs simultaneously
and extract relationships between different CEs, interpreting
fractions from tensor decomposition might not be as straightfor-
ward as other tools.
Other principles and strategies.
Unlike tools that use LRPs as
mediators, MEBOCOST is an algorithm based on computational
methodology designed to infer the dynamics of metabolite-driven
intercellular
communications
quantitatively
using
scRNA-Seq
data.716 By considering the expression of enzyme production,
data regarding the secretion of metabolites has been incorporated
in the transmission study, and it’s possible to deduce the synthesis
of particular metabolites from transcriptome data.717–719 This
algorithm detects interactions between cells where sender cells
secrete metabolites like lipids, which then engage with the sensor
proteins in receiver cells. MEBOCOST identiﬁes cells emitting and
receiving an extracellular metabolite, contingent on their respec-
tive enzyme and sensor expression levels, thereby identifying
communications between cells involving metabolite sensors. The
MEBOCOST algorithm accounts for both the synthesis and
utilization reactions of metabolites. Its design ensures compat-
ibility with established algorithms that ascertain the existence of
single-cell metabolite via ﬂux balance analysis, such as scFEA and
COMPASS. Nevertheless, the frequently nonlinear correlation
between metabolite quantities and RNA contents of metabolic
enzymes poses a challenge that this algorithm cannot provide
quantitative calculations of metabolite abundance.716
While
high-throughput
scRNA-seq
methods

cell
populations heterogeneity,720 they lack the ability to offer
phenotypic information, such as cell surface protein levels.684
Meanwhile,
the

CCC networks inferred from single-cell omics. Intercellular communication networks can be inferred through various single-cell multi-
omics techniques and methods. (1) CCC of single-cell transcriptome: gene expression matrices of different cell types are obtained by
performing single-cell RNA-seq, and then clustering analysis is carried out to infer communication networks of various cell types. CCC of
single-cell proteomics: a single-cell suspension is made after collecting samples such as liver, pancreas, lung and mouse brain which labeling
with conjugated antibodies tagged with metal isotopes. Then cell–cell communication of different cell types is inferred through mass
spectrometry ﬂow cytometry and clustering analysis. (2) CCC of spatial proteomics: tissues are prepared on slides followed by labeling of
conjugated antibodies tagged with metal isotopes and laser ablation, then protein expression map and CCC network is obtained by analysis
of ion mass spectrometry. CCC of single-cell spatial transcriptome: by combining scRNA-seq with spatial localization, gene expression map of
various cell types is obtained to infer CCCs in different spatial locations

cell surface proteins serve as reliable indicators of cellular activity
and
function.723
The
method
known
as
CITE-seq
using
oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies through sequencing addresses
this
limitation
by
utilizing
sequencing-based
strategy
that
simultaneously quantifying transcriptome and cell surface protein
in single-cell
level. CITE-seq.684 not
only describes
cellular
transcriptomes and epitopes indexing but also is compatible with
existing single-cell analysis approaches. Compared to separate
transcriptome measurements, multimodal data analysis through
CITE-seq provides detailed cellular phenotype features.
It is noteworthy that since CCC serve as the downstream of all
data analyses,
setting thresholds
for LRIs can impact
the
interpretation and explanatory power of CCC results. A lower
threshold may lead to the identiﬁcation of more interactions,
including those with lower expression levels or frequencies, aiding
in the discovery of potential novel LRPs. However, this may also
introduce noise, including false-positive results.5,9 Conversely, a
higher threshold may reduce false positives but could also result
in missing some true LRIs. Therefore, when setting the threshold
for LRIs, a balance needs to be struck based on the speciﬁc
research objectives and characteristics of the data used to achieve
the most accurate and interpretable CCC results.
Spatial transcriptome-based tools
Typically, cellular interactions are conﬁned to restricted areas,
which is not captured by scRNA-seq.5 In order to minimize
incorrect exclusion in CCC analysis, integrating the cell’s medium
spatial position is essential.724 Spatial transcriptome technology
enables transcriptome proﬁling from cells in different locations on
tissue sections, facilitating the analysis of gene expression
characteristics at diverse spatial positions within tissues. mRNA
serves as the functional copy of active genes, and their localization
within living tissues is often related to the regulation of cell and
tissue growth and development. Previously, the analysis of
multiple mRNAs simultaneously required the crushing of cells,
making it impossible to understand the localization of mRNA
within cells. Fluorescent in situ RNA sequencing (FISSEQ) can
reveal environmentally speciﬁc transcripts while preserving the
tissue architecture necessary for RNA localization.725 This techni-
que is applicable to tissue sections and whole embryos, is not
overly limited by optical resolution, and can reduce noise signals
in single-molecule detection.726 In addition, it enables large-scale
parallel detection of genetic elements, assisting researchers in
analyzing cell phenotypes, gene regulation, and in situ environ-
ments. Currently, the 10X Genomics Visium.727,728 technology
stands as a mainstream commercial spatial transcription technol-
ogy; however, its detection resolution remains below the true
single-cell
level.
Conversely,
the
10X
Genomics
Xenium.729
technology signiﬁcantly enhances spatial resolution by in situ
ﬂuorescent imaging, capturing RNA expressions at single-cell or
subcellular levels. This technology swiftly detects the in situ
expression level of numerous targets on fresh frozen (FF) or
formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedding (FFPE) tissue sections. By
employing existing or customized probe panels and targets, this
method achieves subcellular resolution, offering insights into cell
structure and function. As another image-based spatial approach,
MERFISH facilitates the detection and measurement of a multitude
of RNA types, ranging from hundreds to thousands, at the single-
cell level.730 It employs speciﬁc ﬂuorescent labeling strategies to
simultaneously detect multiple RNA molecules. Notably, MERFISH
demonstrates fault-tolerant capabilities, accurately identifying
RNA species despite minor ﬂuorescent labeling errors. Xiaowei
Zhuang’s team at Harvard University successfully employed
MERFISH technology to recognize over 100 neuronal and non-
neuronal cell populations in the human brain with high-resolution
images.731 Currently, fault-tolerant ﬂuorescence in situ hybridiza-
tion techniques like MERFISH730 and seqFISH+732 are primary
hybridization-based
in
situ
transcriptomic
methods.
ST
technologies can create “atlases” with spatial information, reveal-
ing which cells constitute each tissue and how they are organized
and communicate.733 However, the imbalance between resolu-
tion, gene capture, and ﬁeld of view in current methods hinders
the construction of atlases with “higher spatial resolution” and
“broader transcriptome coverage”.734 The Stereo-seq technique
actively addresses these challenges, and is capable of analyzing
genes and imaging simultaneously.735,736 This technology allows
for ultra-high precision analysis of gene and cell changes over
time and space during the developmental processes of life,
achieving a comprehensive spatiotemporal molecular atlas of life.
So
the
spatial
transcriptome
is
crucial
in
locating
and
distinguishing the active gene function expressed in distinct
tissue areas, offering key insights for diagnostic and therapeutic
purposes. Creating tools for single-cell ST analysis to clarify
regulatory processes controlling cell state changes hold great
signiﬁcance for research in ﬁelds such as cancer pathogenesis,
neuroscience, developmental biology, and others. Therefore,
many tools such as SpaOTsc,737 spaCI,738 stLearn,739 Giotto,740
MISTy,741 SVCA,742 SpaTalk,743 Tensor-Cell2Cell,744 HoloNet,745
COMMOT,746 and NeuronChat747 have been developed.
Non-spatial single-cell methods frequently yield considerable
false positives, as CCC occurs within conﬁned spatial ranges
unmeasured in such datasets. Thus, SpaOTsc was developed to
infer the spatial distance of two cells by contrasting their
predicted spatial distributions, then provide a useful linkage
between them and quantify the reliability of the estimated
distance.737 As a network approach, optimal transportation is used
in SpaOTsc to model intercellular communication. However,
computational challenges arise as datasets expand beyond
manageable sizes. In addition, this approach does not account
for potential time delays in CCC. Owing to frequent signal
dropouts and noise signals in single-cell ST data, another network-
based tool spaCI has been proposed using an adaptive graph
model
with
attention-based
mechanisms.
It
combines
the
neighboring cells’ spatial position and expression proﬁles to
determine the active LR signaling axis. More importantly, spaCI
allows detection of upstream TFs that mediates the LR signaling
axis, and enhances comprehension of the potential molecular
mechanism of intercellular crosstalk which network-based meth-
ods in single-cell transcriptome are blind to.
Methods such as SpaOTsc and spaCI have not combined spatial
cell-type distribution and LR interaction to ﬁnd hotspots that may
have high CCC activities. So, a tool based on expression
permutation, called stLearn, was developed to automatically scan
areas with high cell-type densities and co-expressed LRPs,
suggesting a highly interactive area.732,748,749 Similarly, Giotto,
MISTy and SVCA can infer the interaction in the local cell niche by
establishing the statistical signiﬁcance of the automatically
recognized cell-type distribution in neighborhood.62,740,749–752
Giotto incorporates spatial expression information with the
possibility of cell interactions by creating a null distribution of
LRI scores to recognize key interactions. It analyzes and isolates
interactions between nearby cell clusters based on the construc-
tion of spatial networks from spatial transcriptomics. In contrast,
MISTy is an explainable framework for analyzing highly multi-
plexed spatial data without requiring cell-type annotation. This
method identiﬁes crucial marker genes in particular regions
through random forest algorithms and calculate interactions by
applying weights to gene expressions in local cellular environ-
ments. Similar to Giotto and MISTy, another computational
framework SVCA was developed to quantify spatial variation in
different dimensions by analyzing the interactions between
markers within different spatial contexts.
However, Giotto and SpaOTsc are limited to inferring CCC
between single-cell ST data rather than the spot-based ST data
and between paired cell types rather than paired cells.743 It still
lacks methods capable of inferring and visualizing spatially

resolved CCC at single-cell resolution through ST data. The
emergence of SpaTalk enables statistical analysis and visualiza-
tion of spatially proximal LRIs, forming a dynamic CCC net-
work.753 By incorporating spatial information, SpaTalk displays
enriched LRIs among spatially proximal co-expressed cell pairs
at single-cell resolution, providing an informative method for
analyzing and visualizing LRIs and their mediated CCC from
different
perspectives.743
This
offers
a
powerful
tool
for
resolving key CCCs in normal physiology and pathological
processes at spatial single-cell resolution. In addition, Tensor-
Cell2Cell is an unsupervised approach based on tensor decom-
position and unravels context-speciﬁc CCC by analyzing various
cell stages, states, or locations concurrently.744 In short, these
methods facilitates the integration of spatial location, structural
characteristics, and expression patterns to address signiﬁcant
biological
questions
including
cell-type
identiﬁcation
and
intercellular communications.739
Although SVCA and Tensor-Cell2Cell was built to characterize
the dependencies of sender-receiver cell as well as the related
phenotypes, a method for systematically decoding functional CEs
was still lacking. Considering only functional but not irrelevant CEs
involving speciﬁc biological processes can help to better under-
stand the role of intercellular communication in shaping certain
cell phenotypes and formulate possible disease interventions.745
Then HoloNet was developed to characterize communication
landscape and identify both cell types serving as main sender and
LRPs serving as core mediators of the speciﬁc downstream gene in
functional CEs.745
Multiple ligands can bind to multiple receptors, thereby
generating competition, a ubiquitous and crucial biophysical
process among multiple molecular species.746 However, current
methods examine CCC on local and independent cell pairs,
focusing on information between cells or near individual cells.
Thus, collective or global information in CCC, such as competition
between cells, is overlooked. To address this issue, COMMOT was
developed by taking into account the competition between
different ligand and receptor species as well as the spatial distance
between cells.746 Besides, brain function depends on signal
transmission between a vast number of neurons and non-
neuronal cells. The connectome—the connective tissue of neural
connections—is subject to transcriptional regulation.754,755 Emer-
ging spatial transcriptomics methods,66,732 besides measuring
gene expression within cells, also measure the spatial location of
neuronal cells, providing a rich resource for dissecting neuronal
heterogeneity. However, these methods are not suitable for
characterizing communication between neurons, as neurons can
extend axons and dendrites over long distances to form synapses
and
primarily
communicate
through
neurotransmitter
sig-
nals.756–758 The development of NeuronChat took into account
neurotransmitter signaling and system-level neuron-speciﬁc cell-
to-cell communication networks, incorporating the process of
neural signal transmission to infer intercellular communication.
This makes NeuronChat distinct from existing methods for
inferring intercellular communication that do not account for
neuronal activity.747
However, the limited ability of in situ hybridization technology
and the applicability of NGS solely to homogenized tissues fail to
fully capture the complexity of a human TME.759 To overcome this
challenge, GeoMx DSP spatial multi-omics technology71 and
CosMx SMI single-cell space in situ imaging technology.760 are
developed for spatial analysis of multiple targets, which realize
the direct evaluation of complete tissue microenvironment and
local drug effects in situ of patients’ tumor tissues.761 Further-
more, these methods capable of simultaneously detecting mRNA
and protein by binding oligomer antibodies,762 offer a compre-
hensive view of the full transcriptome, successfully applied in
spatial gene expression studies across various organs and
tissues.763
Single-cell proteomics and spatial proteomics
Focusing on understanding the qualitative and quantitative
aspects of protein composition within single cells, proteomic
analysis at the single-cell level and spatial proteomic studies are
emerging. This analysis unveils differences in the proteome
between individual cells, providing a detailed molecular map of
proteins. This information aids in comprehending cellular varia-
tions in phenotype and function. In the realm of cell communica-
tion, single-cell proteomics offers in-depth insights into how cells
interact through speciﬁc proteins and signaling pathways. These
interactions involve the “secret language” composed of signals
like cytokines and membrane proteins, which connect cells to
ensure the efﬁcient functioning of life, a core aspect of cell
communication research.
Single-cell proteomics technologies, such as mass cytometry,
enable the simultaneous analysis of 50 parameters at the single-
cell level, encompassing proteins, nucleic acids, and small
molecules, all achieved with a high signal-to-noise ratio. CyTOF,764
which stands for Cytometry by Time of Flight, employs mass
cytometry to quantify labeled targets on both the surface and
interior of individual cells. This technology enables the simulta-
neous quantiﬁcation of multiple cellular components by employ-
ing a detector based on inductively coupled plasma MS (ICP-MS).
The principal beneﬁt of CyTOF lies in its capacity to leverage
immunolabeling to quantify proteins, carbohydrates, or lipids
within a cell. This innovative technology has revolutionized
discovery and clinical
research
by allowing
researchers to
simultaneously interrogate over 50 markers on millions of
individual cells. Furthermore, CyTOF combines MS and ﬂow
cytometry principles, enabling single-cell protein expression
analysis, which is crucial for advancing studies in both steady-
state and pathological processes. Most importantly, MS ﬂow
cytometry allows high-throughput and high-resolution detection
of multiple parameters in a single cell, making it invaluable for
studying CCC. This technology can not only detect receptors and
ligands on the cell surface but also identify signaling molecules
within the cell. One signiﬁcant advantage is that it’s not
constrained by overlapping ﬂuorescence spectra, allowing the
simultaneous detection of more parameters. This comprehensive
information provides deeper insights into the mechanisms
underlying cell communication.
Spatial proteomics explores the spatial distribution and function
of proteins within cells, considering that eukaryotic cells are highly
compartmentalized, and different biological processes occur in
distinct cellular compartments. A protein’s function depends
closely on its sub-localization within the cell, as different
compartments provide varying chemical environments, such as
pH and redox conditions. Proteins are functional molecules of all
cellular functions and processes. Thus, the spatial expression of
proteins is essential for determining their precise locations and
roles in tissues. Proteins can change depending on cell-type, cycle
stage, disease state, and treatment methods. Consequently, spatial
proteomics serves as an effective approach for examining
alterations in spatial expression pattern of proteins associated
with diseases, offering new perspectives for biomarker discovery
and therapeutic development. Recently, the ﬁeld of spatial
proteomics has achieved signiﬁcant advancements in the aspects
of microenvironment and disease development, mechanisms and
drug targets, organ structural heterogeneity, and tissue or organ
spatial mapping.
Traditional proteomic techniques primarily focus on detecting
protein expression levels in cell or tissue lysates, lacking essential
spatial location information. Spatial proteomics technologies have
emerged to address the limitation. Nevertheless, these technol-
ogies form the groundwork for two essential spatial imaging
techniques, imaging MS cytography (IMC) and multiple ion beam
imaging (MIBI).763 IMC integrating immunocytochemistry and

ablation into CyTOF MS ﬂow cytometry.765 It complements
existing imaging methods, delineates cell subgroups and inter-
cellular
interactions,
and
accentuates
tumor
heterogeneity.
Similarly, MIBI employs secondary ion MS for imaging antibodies
tagged with metal isotopes and analyzes samples marked with as
many as 100 different metal isotope-labeled antibodies.766 This
technique is compatible with conventional FFPE tissue slices, a
prevalent specimen type in clinical repositories worldwide.767 The
emerging MS.768 technology for identifying and quantifying
proteins can not only measure the abundance of proteins and
PTMs in individual cells, but also measure their complexes and
subcellular localization.
However, these methods based on ion MS encounter limitations
concerning the availability of sufﬁcient pure metals. On the other
hand, traditional ﬂuorescence immunohistochemistry technology
faces limitations in achieving single-cell analysis due to optical
constraints and difﬁculty in imaging more than seven biomarkers
in a sample. In contrast, Cell DIVE circumvents this hurdle through
multiple rounds of staining, enabling the imaging detection of 60
biomarkers in a single sample by direct labeling with ﬂuorescent
dyes.69 Similarly, another single-cell proteomic analysis platform
CODEX enables to offer intricate details regarding protein
distribution in 2D space.62,769 The fundamental design principle
underlying CODEX involves marking speciﬁc oligonucleotide

on
individual
antibodies,770–772
instead
of
direct
labeling with ﬂuorescent dyes used in Cell DIVE.69 The ﬂuorescent
dye necessary for imaging selectively binds to the complementary
oligonucleotide sequence of the “Barcode”. In summary, these
innovative approaches allow us to surpass limitations associated
with
the
number
of
visible
spectral
ﬂuorescence
imaging
channels, facilitating the simultaneous detection and analysis of
50 or more protein indicators. Meanwhile, pathological analysis
software facilitates the semi-quantitative analysis of diverse
biomarker molecules in each cell.
Single-cell multiomic tools
The continuous advancement of single-cell omics technology has
equipped us with a potent tool to explore cell interaction and
communication. Techniques including single-cell transcriptomics
and proteomics, offer detailed observations of gene expression
and protein synthesis in single cells, respectively. These technol-
ogies have broad applications in biological and medical research,
offering fresh insights and possibilities for deepening our under-
standing of cell interaction and communication.
Single-cell sequencing is an advanced biotechnology that
facilitates detailed decoding of gene expression and genetic
alteration for each cell in a tissue sample. For example, single-
cell DNA sequencing permits accurate DNA mapping for each
unique cell. Going beyond this, the more intricate single-cell
multi-omics sequencing, this is to say single-cell multimodal
omics analysis, facilitates the simultaneous acquisition of various
dimensions of omics data from an individual cell. Practically,
single-cell multi-omics analysis efﬁciently records different
features of the identical cell in multiple tissue samples,
encompassing DNA, RNA, epigenetic regulations, and protein
patterns. This powerful approach has found extensive applica-
tion
in
systematically
unraveling
the
intricate
interaction
mechanisms of critical components and pathways within cells,
contributing signiﬁcantly to our understanding of complex
cellular processes.773
Single-cell multi-omics research integrates diverse techniques
from various disciplines to scrutinize the variability among
different cells. Simultaneously, this integration enables a compre-
hensive and quantitative analysis of the multi-dimensional data
associated with distinct cells, exploring their potential biological
signiﬁcance. Nonetheless, it confronts challenges such as intricate
technical complexities, substantial data volumes, and multiple
dimensions of data, necessitating ongoing development and
optimization of analytical methods and research models in the
realm of multi-omics technology.
Besides, the single-cell transcriptome offers the capacity for
large-scale simultaneous analysis of thousands of molecular
attributes within a single cell, uncovering pivotal genes associated
with distinct cell types and highlighting disparities among various
cell categories. However, the underlying mechanisms governing
these differential expressions remain largely unclear. In this
context, single-cell multi-omics emerges as a potent tool capable
of elucidating the internal interplay between gene expression and
epigenetic regulation within the same cell. It provides a means to
establish the direct connections between candidate regulatory
elements and their target genes, allowing for the deﬁnition of
regulatory elements and cell states speciﬁc to unique cell types.
This approach aids in elucidating the root causes of gene
expression disparities and unveils the regulatory network under-
pinning genes linked to tumors and diseases, along with the
mechanisms governing them.
Finally, considerable strides have been taken in reﬁning
methods and applying single-cell and spatial multi-omics tech-
nologies. Some tools have incorporated multi-omics information
in inferring CCC, precisely mapping single-cell data into spatial
transcriptomics data. For instance, the updated version of
CellPhoneDB v5 signiﬁcantly improves the database and compu-
tational methods to infer, prioritize, and visualize CCC, utilizing
other single-cell modalities such as spatial information or TF
activity.774 Apart from this, CellChat v2 now enables the inference
of CCC from multiple spatially resolved transcriptomics datasets as
well. By optimizing the CCC algorithm through the integration of
multi-omics data, the accuracy of cell-type classiﬁcation can be
improved, thereby enhancing the calculation results of cell
proportions and log2 values. These techniques empower the
exploration of the molecular hierarchy, bridging the gap from the
genome to the phenotype within a single cell. They offer insights
into the dynamic interplay between gene regulation from
epigenome and gene expression from transcriptome or proteome
across various biological processes, including development, aging,
and diseases. In addition, these technologies facilitate the study of
the impact of genetic variations acquired by individual cells on
their unique functional and phenotypic characteristics, along with
their
inﬂuence on surrounding
tissue functions
and other
factors.775 With ongoing advancements in single-cell technology,
we can look forward to deepening our understanding of the
intricate network of interactions between cells. In turn, this offers
novel strategies and pathways for disease prevention and
treatment. Since the method for inferring CCC possesses unique
advantages and constraints, the utilization of these methodolo-
gies necessitates awareness of their strengths and weaknesses,
and the careful choice of analytical parameters.5 While methodo-
logical and technical challenges persist, there are abundant
opportunities for enhancing our comprehension of cellular
interactions. Looking ahead, we can anticipate further break-
throughs in the realms of biology and medicine through
continued advancements in single-cell research.
Investigating mechanisms underlying CCC remains a prominent
area of exploration in physiology and the broader life sciences.
Although we have made remarkable progress, there are still many
challenges
in
understanding
single-cell
communication
and
interaction, which require further research and exploration to
better solve current problems in biomedical research. Research
has revealed that the intricacies of signal transduction pathways
are exceedingly complex, involving protein interactions and the
expression processes of associated genes. However, complex
interconnections exist among various signal transduction path-
ways, forming an intricate dialog between signals and even an
entire signal network system. Despite signiﬁcant progress in
recent years, facilitated by various “omics” approaches, exploring
signal transduction mechanisms requires further in-depth research

and examination. Therefore, developing cutting-edge tools for
deciphering cellular interactions and their integration with multi-
omics approaches is pivotal for advancing the treatment of
diverse diseases and the progress of the medical ﬁeld.
CHALLENGES AND PERSPECTIVES
CCC is a fundamental mechanism for multicellular organisms to
adapt to internal and external environmental ﬂuctuations, and to
preserve homeostasis. Through CCC, biochemical and physical
signals are dispatched and received between cells, inﬂuencing cell
phenotypes and functions.704 However, the present research
challenge is that current approaches for deciphering intercellular
communication from scRNA-seq data predominantly analyze at
the classiﬁcation of cell subtypes or cluster level, often overlooking
information in individual cells.
The challenges include:
(1)
Data parsing complexity: While scRNA-seq technology offers
the capability to dissect intricate multicellular niches at
single-cell resolution, it is essential to recognize that CCC
does not operate at a population level but transpires at
single-cell scale. Hence, the development of novel CCC
inference methods is imperative. These methods should
examine single-cell dynamics and their interplays, and
capitalize on the full spectrum of information encapsulated
within scRNA-seq data.704
(2)
Complex experimental design: Traditional approaches to
investigating intercellular interactions often involve expen-
sive equipment and intricate procedures. Moreover, these
methods exhibit limited ﬂexibility and are often incompa-
tible with other analytical processes.776
Besides this, the current applicability of CCC is more widespread
in the cell–cell
interactions
under
physiological
conditions.
However, during pathological or post-treatment processes, cell-
type transitions occur, impacting the accuracy of analysis. To
improve accuracy, the following methods can be considered:
(1)
Use
of
multi-omics
approaches:
Combining
single-cell
transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics can com-
prehensively
analyze
changes
in
cell–cell
interactions,
reducing analysis biases caused by cell-type transitions.
(2)
Development of precise cell markers: Developing new cell
markers that can more accurately distinguish different cell
types and monitor changes in cell states more ﬁnely.
(3)
Conducting validation experiments: Based on the analysis
results, perform validation experiments to conﬁrm the
impact of cell-type transitions on the results and further
validate the accuracy of the analysis.
(4)
Integration with clinical data: Integrating experimental data
with clinical data for analysis can better understand the role
of cell-type transitions in disease development and treat-
ment processes, improving the accuracy and credibility of
the analysis.
As
OMICS
technologies
undergo
rapid
advancement,
research into cellular communication networks has also made
substantial progress. This research unveils the foundational
structure and functions of cell communication networks and
lays the experimental groundwork for application in various
related ﬁelds.
In the future, research into cell communication networks is
poised to attain greater depth, with speciﬁc prospects including:
(1) Research based on multi-omics cell communication network.
(2) Exploration of the dynamic changes in the structure and
functionality
of
cell
communication
networks.
(3)
In-depth
investigation of pivotal components and interactions within
signaling pathways. (4) Research focused on drug-targeted
therapy and the prediction of side effects. (5) Utilization of
microﬂuidic systems has emerged as practical tools for research-
ing cell–cell and cell-ECM communications. Microﬂuidic systems
offer advantages such as low reagent consumption, precise
management
of
reagents,
high
throughput,
and
seamless
integration of functional components. They facilitate comprehen-
sive studies of cellular interactions at population and single-cell
levels.776 (6) The development of novel multi-omics analysis
methods for inferring CCC.
In summary, the structural analysis and application of CCC
networks have huge signiﬁcance, and its research holds sub-
stantial potential for addressing a multitude of challenges in life
sciences.
