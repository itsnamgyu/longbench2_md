# Question

In the context of the MVPF (Marginal Value of Public Funds) framework, which of the following is the primary reason that an MVPF value might exceed 1 for a government policy targeting in-kind transfers, despite behavioral responses that reduce labor supply?

# Choices

- A: The policy increases the recipients' willingness to pay due to consumption-smoothing benefits provided by the in-kind transfers, thereby enhancing their welfare more than the cost to the government.
- B: The policy generates substantial positive fiscal externalities, such as increased long-term tax revenues from individuals whose earnings were boosted by the in-kind transfers.
- C: The MVPF calculation reflects a situation where the marginal cost of the in-kind transfers is underestimated, leading to artificially high welfare estimates due to incomplete cost-benefit accounting.
- D: The marginal excess burden of taxation used to fund the policy is higher than the policyâ€™s actual implementation cost, which leads to an inflated MVPF value.

# Answer

A
