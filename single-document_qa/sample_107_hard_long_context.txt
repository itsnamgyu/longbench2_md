This document is important. If you are in any doubt as to the action you should take, you should consult your 
legal, ﬁ
 nancial, tax, or other professional adviser.
We have made an application to the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) for 
permission to deal in, and for quotation of, all the ordinary shares of US$0.16 each (the “Shares”) in the 
capital of Uni-Asia Finance Corporation (the “Company”) already issued, the new shares which are the subject 
of this Invitation (the “New Shares”), the new Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the options 
to be granted under the Uni-Asia Share Option Scheme (the “Option Shares”) and the new Shares which may 
be issued upon the exercise of the Over-allotment Option (as deﬁ
 ned below) (the “Additional Shares”). Such 
permission will be granted when we have been admitted to the Ofﬁ
 cial List of the SGX-ST. The dealing and 
quotation of the Shares will be in Singapore dollars.
Acceptance of applications will be conditional upon, inter alia, permission being granted by the SGX-ST 
to deal in, and for quotation of, all the existing issued Shares, the New Shares, the Option Shares and the 
Additional Shares. If the completion of the Invitation does not occur because the SGX-ST’s permission is not 
granted or for any other reasons, moneys paid in respect of any application accepted will be returned to you 
at your own risk, without interest or any share of revenue or other beneﬁ
 t arising therefrom and you will not 
have any claims against us or the Manager.
In connection with the Invitation, we have granted the Manager an over-allotment option (the “Over-allotment 
Option”) exercisable by the Manager during the period commencing on the date of commencement of trading 
of the Shares on the SGX-ST (the “Commencement Date”) and expiring on the date falling 30 days after 
the Commencement Date. The Manager may subscribe and/or procure subscribers for up to an aggregate 
of 9,810,000 Shares, representing 15 per cent. of the New Shares. The Manager may over-allot and effect 
transactions which stabilise or maintain the market price of the Shares, subject to compliance with the 
laws of Singapore. Such stabilisation, if commenced, may be discontinued by the Manager at any time at the 
Manager’s discretion in accordance with the laws of Singapore.
The SGX-ST assumes no responsibility for the correctness of any of the statements or opinions made or 
reports contained in this Prospectus. Admission to the Ofﬁ
 cial List of the SGX-ST is not to be taken as an 
indication of the merits of the Invitation, our Company, our subsidiaries, our Shares, the New Shares, the 
Option Shares or the Additional Shares.
A copy of this Prospectus has been lodged with and registered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the 
“Authority”) on 29 June 2007 and 8 August 2007 respectively. The Authority assumes no responsibility for the 
contents of this Prospectus. Registration of this Prospectus by the Authority does not imply that the Securities 
and Futures Act (Cap. 289), or any other legal or regulatory requirements, have been complied with. The 
Authority has not, in any way, considered the merits of the shares or units of shares, as the case may be, 
being offered or in respect of which an invitation is made, for investment.
Investing in our Shares involves risks which are described in the section entitled “RISK FACTORS” of this 
Prospectus.
No Shares will be allotted and/or allocated on the basis of this Prospectus later than six months after the 
date of registration of this Prospectus.

in partnership with other investors, three key Alternative 
Asset classes:  
Ship Investment

companies and investment funds

produce attractive investment returns due to the high expected 
demand for, or anticipated shortfall in the supply of these ships
> Since 2004, we have launched three private shipping 
investment funds – Searex Series I and II Funds, and the 
Akebono Fund

All statements contained in this Prospectus, statements made in press releases and oral statements that
may be made by us or our Directors, Executive Officers or employees acting on our behalf, that are not

forward-looking statements by terms such as “expects”, “believes”, “plans”, “intends”, “estimates”,

expected growth in demand;
(c) 
expected industry trends;
(d) 
anticipated expansion plans; and
(e) 
other matters discussed in this Prospectus regarding matters that are not historical fact,
are only predictions. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-
looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others:

those forward-looking statements to reflect future developments, events or circumstances. We are,
however, subject to the provisions of the SFA and the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST regarding corporate

before the close of the Invitation, we become aware of (a) a false or misleading statement or matter in
this Prospectus; (b) an omission from this Prospectus of any information that should have been included
in it under Section 243 of the SFA; or (c) a new circumstance that has arisen since this Prospectus was
lodged with the Authority and would have been required by Section 243 of the SFA to be included in this
Prospectus, if it had arisen before this Prospectus was lodged and that is materially adverse from the

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
17


Pursuant to Section 88 of the Cayman Companies Law, where a scheme or contract involving the transfer
of Shares or any class of shares in the Company to another company, whether a company (the
“transferee company”) has, within four months after the making of the offer in that behalf by the
transferee company, been approved by the holders of not less than 90 per cent. in value of the shares
affected, the transferee company may, at any time within two months after the expiration of the said four
months, give notice in the prescribed manner to any dissenting shareholder that it desires to acquire his
shares, and where such notice is given the transferee company shall, unless on an application made by
the dissenting shareholder within one month from the date on which the notice was given, unless the
court thinks fit to order otherwise, be entitled and bound to acquire those shares on the terms on which
under the scheme or contract the shares of the approving shareholders are to be transferred to the
transferee company.
Apart from Section 88 of the Cayman Companies Law, there are no other statutory requirements under
any Cayman Islands laws or regulations on take-over offers for our Shares which would be applicable to
us.
With effect from 15 October 2005 and following legislative amendments to the SFA, we are subject to
Sections 138, 139 and 140 of the SFA and the Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers
notwithstanding that we are a corporation incorporated in the Cayman Islands.
TAKE-OVERS
18


Under the laws of the Cayman Islands, a company may, if authorised by its articles of association,
purchase its own shares. Our Company has such power to purchase our own Shares pursuant to Article
14 of our Articles. Such power to purchase our own Shares shall, subject to the Cayman Companies Law
and our Articles (and if applicable, the rules and regulations of the SGX-ST and other regulatory
authorities), be exercisable by our Directors upon such terms and subject to such conditions as they think
fit, in accordance with Article 14.
Under the laws of the Cayman Islands, such purchases may be effected out of profits of our Company or
out of proceeds of a fresh issue of Shares made for that purpose or, in the manner authorised by our
Articles, by a payment out of capital. At no time may our Company purchase our Shares if, as a result of
the purchase, there would no longer be any member of our Company holding our Shares. Only fully paid
Shares may be purchased by our Company. A payment out of capital by our Company for the purchase of
our Shares is not lawful unless immediately following the date on which the payment out of capital is
proposed to be made, our Company shall be able to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course
of business. Shares purchased by our Company shall be treated as cancelled and our Company’s issued,
but not our authorised, capital will be diminished accordingly.
For further details on the constitution of our Company, please refer to Appendix D of this Prospectus.
Our Company presently has no intention of purchasing our own Shares after the listing. However, if we
decide to do so later, we will seek our Shareholders’ approval in accordance with our Articles and the
rules of the SGX-ST.
Our Company will make prompt public announcement of any such share purchase and has also given an
undertaking to the SGX-ST to comply with all requirements that the SGX-ST may impose in the event of
any such share purchase.
PURCHASE BY OUR COMPANY OF OUR OWN SHARES
19


Under the Cayman Companies Law, only those persons who agree to become shareholders of a Cayman
Islands company and whose names are entered on the register of members of such a company are
considered members, with rights to attend and vote at general meetings. Accordingly, Depositors holding
Shares through CDP would not be recognised as members of our Company, and would not have a right
to attend and to vote at general meetings of our Company. In the event that Depositors wish to attend
and vote at general meetings of our Company, CDP will have to appoint them as proxies, pursuant to the
Articles. In accordance with Article 63(b), unless CDP specifies otherwise in a written notice to our
Company, CDP shall be deemed to have appointed as CDP’s proxies each of the Depositors who are
individuals and whose names are shown in the records of CDP
, as at a time not earlier than forty-eight
(48) hours prior to the time of the relevant general meeting, supplied by CDP to our Company. Therefore,
Depositors who are individuals can attend and vote at the general meetings of our Company without the
lodgment of any proxy form. Depositors who cannot attend a meeting personally may enable their
nominees to attend as CDP’s proxies. Depositors who are not individuals can only be represented at a
general meeting of our Company if their nominees are appointed by CDP as CDP’s proxies. Proxy forms
appointing nominees of Depositors as proxies of CDP would need to be executed by CDP as members
and must be deposited at the specified place and within the specified time frame to enable the nominees
to attend and vote at the relevant general meeting of our Company.

Underwriter of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.
For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer to the public” in relation to any New Shares in
any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and any New Shares to be offered so as to enable an investor to
decide to purchase any New Shares, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure
implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State and the expression “Prospectus Directive”

State.

OVERVIEW
Introduction
Uni-Asia is an Asia-based structured finance arrangement and Alternative Assets direct investment firm.
Our principal activities are in: (1) structured finance – the finance arrangement of transport related assets
(such as ships and aircraft), and the provision of ship charter arrangement and agency services; and (2)
Alternative Assets investment/management – direct investments in and/or the arrangement and
administration of Alternative Assets investments such as ships, distressed assets and real estate. As at
the Latest Practicable Date, our Group has 32 staff in three offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore.
Uni-Asia was established in Hong Kong in 1997 by founders Motokuni Yamashiro, Kazuhiko Yoshida,
Michio Tanamoto and Takanobu Himori who were Japanese bankers. Each of the founders has over 25
years experience in the banking industry working in corporate loan syndication and structured finance
arrangement. Mr. Himori left our Company in March 2004. The other founders continue to lead the
business and as at the Latest Practicable Date, they own, directly and indirectly, a significant aggregate
equity interest in Uni-Asia of approximately 23.9%.
Activities
Uni-Asia was founded to arrange structured finance transactions for companies mainly in the shipping
and, to some extent, aviation industries. Our initial focus was on finance arrangement for companies in
the transport sector. Our business expanded to include investment in Alternative Assets such as NPLs
distressed debt, shipping assets and real estate assets in May 1998.
(1)
Structured Finance 
Our structured finance department provides an integrated service to our clients by offering financing
solutions together with charter arrangement services tailor-made to our clients’ needs. The solutions do
not normally involve the use of our balance sheet capital to make loans. We typically act only as the
arranger and agent for the structured financing provided by third party financial institutions. We arrange
financing for asset acquisitions by our clients and also offer tax-enhanced structured services and
products, including mortgage financing, tax-oriented leases such as UK tax leases and Japanese
operating leases, as well as ECA backed credit, ship charter arrangement, and balance sheet
management. We receive an arrangement fee on each completed transaction.
We have been active in the arrangement of structured finance since our founding in 1997. In this time, we
have built up a portfolio of clients and have identified potential clients to whom we market to directly or on
an opportunistic basis. We have also developed relationships with the key banks which provide
syndicated loan financing. Our clients include established international shipping and aviation companies
from Taiwan, Greece, Indonesia, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, the UK and Italy.
Some key products and services which we offer our clients include mortgage financing, tax-oriented
leases, ECA backed credit, ship charter arrangement and balance sheet management.
We acted as arranger for structured financing in the form of loans and leases in the aggregate amount of
approximately US$561.6 million, US$987.5 million and US$637.7 million in FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006
respectively.
Selected key transactions completed include:

UK Tax Lease for Hatsu Marine

Arrangement of a Japanese Operating Lease

Ship Charter Arrangement for Niki Shipping Company Inc

Mortgage Financing for CIDO Holding Co., Ltd.

JBIC Financing
PROSPECTUS SUMMARY

(2)
Alternative Assets Investment
Our Alternative Assets Investments division leverages on our specialist skills in structured finance
arrangement and credit analysis to invest in, either as the principal investor or in partnership with other
investors, three key Alternative Asset classes: (i) ship investment (such as bulk carriers, product tankers
and container vessels); (ii) distressed assets investment (including NPLs and other distressed assets in
Asia (excluding Japan)); and (iii) property investment (including hotel and property investment in Japan
and commercial property investment in the PRC).
We invest in the following three key alternative asset classes:
(i)
Ship Investment
As a progression from our structured finance business as an arranger of financing for transport related
assets, we branched out into direct investments in ships through equity investment in the ship owning
companies and also through subscription of Performance Notes issued by special investment fund
vehicles established by us.
Our asset finance department aims to invest in ships for commercial use that will produce attractive
investment returns because of factors such as high expected demand for, or anticipated shortfall in, the
supply of such ships.
Selected key transactions completed include:

Mortgage financing and equity syndication for Searex

Multiple roles as investor, administrator and fiscal agent of Searex

Multiple roles as administrator, registrar, fiscal agent and project manager to the Akebono Fund
(ii)
Distressed Assets Investment
We started to invest directly in distressed assets in 1998 to capitalise on opportunities for us to use our
own capital to purchase NPLs and other distressed assets in Asia (excluding Japan) including the PRC,
Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Korea. We usually invest in NPLs through
special investment fund vehicles established by us and which issue Performance Notes to Uni-Asia itself
and selected institutional co-investors to raise funding for distressed assets investments.
Our NPL investment strategy is to leverage on our network of industry contacts to find opportunities that
satisfy our criteria of high cashflow generation and a significant asset base on which we can get security.
Opportunities are sourced through a network of industry contacts which include financial institutions, such
as banks, and accounting firms active in NPL transactions. We aim to recover the NPLs and exit the
investments to realise a return through various debt recovery policies. Debt collection and monitoring of
individual NPL transactions are applied either through an agent bank, receiver or liquidator, or led by us if
the asset is located in the PRC, Taiwan or Hong Kong. We focus on the recovery of the debt repayments
under the NPLs. We do not actively engage in the secondary trading of NPLs with the specific purpose of
on-selling to another purchaser of NPLs.
A strong performance track record has been steadily built up since 1998 to 2004. We, as sole principal,
made six investments that included 24 NPL accounts with a value of approximately US$30.5 million and
realised a return of over eight times within the period of approximately six years.
AAA Series II Fund has made 19 NPL investments representing 58 NPL accounts since July 2003 to the
Latest Practicable Date. The two-year investment period ended in July 2005 and the recovery period will
end in July 2008.
PROSPECTUS SUMMARY
30


We also act as the administrator of the distressed assets investment funds providing administration
services such as monitoring, book-keeping and reporting services. We earn an administration fee on the
drawdown of funds (for investment into NPLs) and an incentive fee for investment out-performance
against a target hurdle rate. We also earn an agency fee for services to be provided in our capacity as
the registrar and the fiscal agent of the funds.
(iii)
Property Investment
Property Investment and Management – Japan
We invest into real estate in Japan through Capital Advisers. Capital Advisers focuses on investment in
and management of residential and hotel related real estate assets in Japan. It seeks investments across
a range of locations with a focus on balanced risk and return. Capital Advisers was established in 1998
as our wholly-owned subsidiary. In May 2003, Capital Advisers raised Yen 985 million (or approximately
US$8.2 million) in shareholders’ equity capital from a number of independent third party investors as part
of its strategic expansion. Our shareholding interest in Capital Advisers was diluted to 44.8% and as a
result, Capital Advisers became our associated company.
Capital Advisers, by itself or in cooperation with its business partners, looks for the appropriate property
projects to invest in. At the initial stage of an investment, it arranges the investment structure, establishes
a SPC which owns the property in the form of a trust, arranges equity contribution to the SPC, arranges
non-recourse loan, from financial institutions on behalf of the SPC. Capital Advisers itself may invest in
the SPC as a minority investor. Capital Advisers also acts as the asset manager of the assets owned by
the SPC and manages the SPC’s assets including the invested property on behalf of the SPC, eventually
on behalf of the investors. At the end of the investment period or sometimes during the investment period,
in order to maximise investors’ return, Capital Advisers also engages in a selling procedure as the asset
manager. Capital Advisers manages over Yen 58.5 billion (or approximately US$491.9 million) in assets
which includes a contribution of approximately Yen 2.0 billion (or approximately US$16.8 million) of its
own capital as at the end of 2006.

Property Investment – Japan
In 2000, we, through our then wholly-owned subsidiary Capital Advisers, established an investment
partnership with Grosvenor Asia to invest in residential properties in Tokyo.
The investment partnership was followed by the establishment of the GCAP Fund in 2004. The
GCAP Fund is jointly managed by Grosvenor Asia and Capital Advisers through Grosvenor Capital
Advisers Fund Management Co., Ltd. and is anticipated to grow to more than Yen 20 billion (or
approximately US$194.4 million) when fully invested based on its historical borrowing capability
and committed equity funds of Yen 6.3 billion (or approximately US$61.2 million).
The equity size of each investment fund ranged from US$1.4 million to US$38.5 million. The equity
investors to the funds are financial institutions, real estate companies and corporations mainly
based in Japan and Southeast Asia. Capital Advisers itself invested Yen 2.0 billion (or
approximately US$16.8 million) as a minority equity investor as at 31 December 2006.

Hotel Properties Investment – Japan
In 2001, Capital Advisers directed its attention to the asset investment/management business in
the hotel property sector. In the hotel property sector, Capital Advisers focuses mainly on
investment in limited-service hotels. Capital Advisers typically enters into hotel properties
investments as both the asset manager and a minority investor although there was one exception
in which Capital Advisers had become the majority investor as a result of an additional equity
injection. The number of hotels in which Capital Advisers has been engaged in as asset manager
and invested in as minority investor totalled 11 by the end of 2006. Capital Advisers, as the asset
manager in hotel property investments, employs a team which is experienced in the hotel sector
and not only manages the hotel assets but also monitors the hotel operation itself. The total asset
of the hotel investments was over Yen 16.9 billion (or approximately US$142.5 million) as at 31
PROSPECTUS SUMMARY
31


December 2006. The total equity invested was about Yen 5.4 billion (or approximately US$45.5
million), of which Capital Advisers had an interest of between 5.0% and 51.9%. In relation to the
hotel property investment, in 2004, Capital Advisers invested in another asset management
company which manages a Japanese real estate investment trust (J-REIT) specializing in hotel
properties. As at the Latest Practicable Date, Capital Advisers has a 5% shareholding interest in
this asset management company. The J-REIT was listed in Japan on 14 June 2006. In view of
Capital Advisers’ growth and expansion strategy, they may from time to time consider various fund
raising options, such as new equity injection. In the event of a new equity injection, our interest in
Capital Advisers may be diluted.

Residential Investment – Japan
Since February 2004, Capital Advisers has also been engaged in the investment in and asset
management of residential properties, with a focus on small-sized studio apartment buildings. The
number of these types of buildings managed and/or invested in by Capital Advisers reached 10 in
2004, 31 in 2005 and 50 in 2006. Between 2004 and 2006, the equity interests held by Capital
Advisers in its residential property investments were between 5.8% to 10% in equity and such
equity interests were redeemed through the sales of the relevant properties.
Capital Advisers earns an arrangement, asset management and administration fee for its services
as the asset manager of the property investment portfolio. It also participates in the return to
investors in the portfolio through its position as a minority equity investor in the property investment
funds.
Principal Investments in Properties – PRC
In January 2007, we established a wholly-owned property investment company, Uni-Asia Guangzhou, in
Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, the PRC, with a paid-in capital of US$3.0 million. Our Group will
continue to explore property investment opportunities in the PRC under new property guidelines
introduced by the PRC government in July 2006, and property investment opportunities in Southeast
Asia. At the end of June 2007, Uni-Asia Guangzhou completed the acquisition of 14 office units with
gross floor area of 1,304 sq m of the China Shine Plaza, a commercial development in the Tianhe
commercial district in Guangzhou. We intend to lease the office units to third parties.
Please refer to the section entitled “General Information on our Group” in this Prospectus for more details.
COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS 
We believe that our key competitive strengths are as follows:
Experienced Executive Directors and Management Team
Our Executive Directors and management team comprise experienced professionals in the structured
finance industry and alternative asset investments. Our co-founders and Executive Directors, Messrs
Motokuni Yamashiro, Kazuhiko Yoshida and Michio Tanamoto co-founded Uni-Asia in 1997. A summary
of their work experience may be found in the section entitled “Directors, Management and Staff” in this
Prospectus.
We believe that we have a clear understanding of our industry requirement and possess a client-driven
focus and an established investment strategy. Our staff is committed to provide value-added and
innovative services to our clients. Our Executive Directors, Executive Officers and employees of our
Company collectively own approximately 19.7% of our post-Invitation issued share capital. We believe
that this has helped align their interests with those of our Company and foster a sense of commitment. In
addition, we have in place an employee share option scheme to motivate and foster a stronger sense of
ownership amongst our staff. Please refer to the section entitled “Uni-Asia Share Option Scheme” in this
Prospectus for further details of our Scheme.

Japanese banks and ship finance in Asia financed by European financial institutions.
Please refer to the section entitled “General Information on our Group – Competitive Strengths” in this
Prospectus for more details.
PROSPECTS 
Shipping
Shipping is a global industry which is generally influenced by demand and supply dynamics such as the
demand for movement of cargoes, the resultant tonne-mile demand of vessels as well as the supply of
vessels tonnage capacity. Fuel cost, which typically makes up a significant portion of the operating cost of
ships, is also a factor affecting the performance of the shipping industry.
Shipping comprises different shipping sectors servicing different industries, governed under different
regulations and each having its own supply and demand dynamics. The major types of ships include dry
bulk ships, container vessels, product tankers and crude tankers. Dry bulk ships carry dry commodities
such as ore, coal, grains, fertiliser, bauxite, soy beans, cement, potash and salt. Container vessels carry
metal boxes containing cargoes such as cars and equipment. Product tankers carry mainly refined oil
products such as gasoline and diesel, and other non-refrigerated cargoes such as edible oils and
chemicals. Crude tankers carry crude oil and petroleum.
The dry bulk shipping trade is usually dependent on the demand for and price of commodities. Steel
production is a key driver of the dry bulk shipping trade through seaborne demand for coking coal and
iron ore. The container shipping trade is usually dependent on the global economic growth, trade growth,
industrial production and consumer consumption. The product and oil tanker industry is usually
dependent on global industrial production, refinery throughput, utilisation rate in refineries, global crude
oil inventory levels and the weather season.
PROSPECTUS SUMMARY
33


We believe that the demand for maritime vessels will be driven largely by the continued growth in the
world economy and seaborne trade. Such demand will provide us with opportunities to leverage on our
track record and experience in structured finance and ship charter arrangements to establish new client
relationships and to offer our existing clients innovative and customised structured finance solutions as
well as ship charter arrangement services.
Structured finance focusing on the shipping industry is dominated mainly by financial institutions. We
believe that we are able to compete effectively with them by leveraging on our track record, our wide
network and our strong relationships with our business partners and customers, which include
established shipping banks and shipowners.
Whilst the shipping industry may be cyclical, we believe that our structured finance operations are not
significantly subject to such cycles as we believe that there continues to be opportunities for us to provide
structured financing solutions as ship renewal is an ongoing process. In a shipping down-cycle, we
generally observe the trend of older ships being scrapped and new ones being built given the lower cost
of new builds. In the shipping up-cycle, we generally observe that there will be an increase in demand for
ships as ship owners seek to increase their fleet to capitalise on the favourable freight rates. We believe
that there continues to be opportunities for us to provide structured finance solutions and ancillary ship
brokerage services at different stages of the shipping cycle. We further believe that the shipyards’ order
books in the coming years will continue to be sustained and thus present opportunities for us to provide
more structured finance solutions to shipowners and operators.
Alternative Assets Investment
The Alternative Assets investment class includes investments in ships, distressed assets and real estate.
Distressed assets typically include debt obligations such as junk bonds, corporate bonds, commercial and
industrial loans, credit card receivables and auto loans. Investors in distressed assets purchase debt
obligations of companies that are financially troubled and are struggling or are unable to service their
debt obligations and they earn a return through recovery of distressed debt, through appreciation in the
value of the distressed debt investment, or through leveraged buyouts.
Our investments in ships are usually made through equity interests in ship owning companies or through
Performance Notes held in ship investment funds. Our direct and indirect investments in the different
types of ships are made after careful consideration and due diligence and based on our Directors’ outlook
of the various shipping sectors. We believe that we can leverage on our expertise knowledge in the
shipping sector to tap on the opportunities to source for new ship investments and/or to buy or sell
maritime vessels.
Our investments in distressed assets are mainly made through NPLs and we are also seeking
opportunities in the distressed real estate market in Asia (excluding Japan). Such opportunities will be
dependent on factors such as the respective countries’ macroeconomic environment and policies,
performance in key industry sectors, access to capital and liquidity, competition and prevailing market
conditions. We believe that we will be able to leverage on our well-established network and familiarity with
the distressed asset markets in the region to identify and invest in suitable distressed assets.
The performance of Alternative Assets investments are dependent on the unique characteristics of each
type of alternative asset and the country of origin of these assets. These investments are therefore
relatively opportunistic in nature. We believe that such non-mainstream opportunities are available in Asia
and we intend to seek new ship investments, real estate investments and distressed asset investments in
Asia. We also believe that our experience in Alternative Assets investments, our capabilities in deal-
making, due diligence, valuation, structuring and financing, together with our well-established network of
contacts in Asia will enable us to effectively identify and evaluate opportunities for cross-border
investments in these assets.
Please refer to the section entitled “General Information on our Group – Prospects” in this Prospectus for
more details.

Investors should consider carefully the following risk factors (which are not intended to be exhaustive) and
all other information contained in this Prospectus, before deciding to invest in our Shares. You should also
note that certain of the statements set forth below constitute “forward-looking statements” that involve
risks and uncertainties.
If any of the following risk factors and uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial
condition or results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected. In such circumstances, the
trading price of our Shares could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment. To the
best of our Directors’ belief and knowledge, all the risk factors that are material to investors in making an
informed judgement have been set out below.
RISKS RELATING TO OUR GROUP 
We are dependent on the services of key management personnel.
Our Directors believe that the reason for our continued success is, to a certain extent, attributable to the
expertise and experience of our three Executive Directors, namely Mr. Motokuni Yamashiro, Mr. Kazuhiko
Yoshida and Mr. Michio Tanamoto. Our management personnel make key decisions to maximise our
revenue and earnings in a cyclical and highly volatile environment. Please refer to the section entitled
“Directors, Management and Staff” in this Prospectus for more details. Our success will depend, in part,
on our ability to hire and retain key members of our management team. If any of our Executive Directors
ceases to be involved in our Group’s management in the future and we fail to find any suitable personnel
to replace any one or all of them, our operations, profitability and prospects may be adversely affected.
Our financial performance is unpredictable and dependent on prevailing market conditions.
Our overall revenue and profits tend to be difficult to predict. Our financial performance is dependent on
prevailing market conditions and we cannot predict with certainty our future revenue or profitability. The
majority of our income is earned mainly from our transaction-based business which depends on gaining
and executing finance arrangement mandates, or identifying and executing direct investments into
Alternative Assets. We also have some recurrent income from management fees, administration fees and
interest from Performance Notes from our direct investment business. Future revenue and profitability is
dependent on our consistently gaining business from our customers for finance arrangement and making
successful direct investments that would exceed our target investment hurdle rate.
Our Directors believe that our direct investment business performance depends on our ability to (i) source
for investment opportunities; (ii) negotiate investment terms that provide us with a positive investment
return that satisfy our investment criteria and exit relatively illiquid investment assets to realise our target
investment return rate; and (iii) continue to raise further funds from co-investors for new investments
when necessary.
As Alternative Assets are generally not traded over the counter or on any recognised stock
exchanges, it may be difficult to sell or realise the value of these investments and recover the
amounts we originally paid for them.
We invest in three key Alternative Asset classes, namely (i) ship investment consisting primarily of bulk
carriers, product tankers and container vessels mainly manufactured by Japanese shipyards; (ii)
distressed assets (including NPLs and other distressed assets in Asia (excluding Japan)); and (iii)
property investment (including hotel and property investment in Japan and commercial property
development in the PRC). As Alternative Assets are not traded over the counter or in any recognised
stock exchanges, their liquidity is subject to market conditions. Should market conditions deteriorate, it
may be difficult to sell or realise the value of these investments and recover the amounts we originally
paid for them. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
RISK FACTORS
40


We face the risk of not being able to earn the income we would have earned from our investment
in the NPL if the debtor is not able to service the loan and interest and we may be unable to
recover the original amount we had paid for the NPL.
Our investments in NPLs are dependent on the underlying distressed debtor’s ability to service its debt
and the anticipated cashflow return from recovering the NPL. There is a risk that the distressed debtor
might not be able to service its loan and the interest payable on the loan. In such circumstances, we face
the prospect of losing the income we could have earned from our investment in the NPL, had the debtor
been able to service the loan and interest in excess of the original amount we paid for the NPL. This
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our
Company does not currently participate directly in any NPLs. Our investments in NPLs are made through
investments in distressed assets investment funds such as the AAA Series I and II Funds. In the event
that a distressed debtor is unable to service its loans and interest to the relevant funds, the risk faced by
our Company is that we may receive lower or no distributions in respect of our investments in such funds.
We may be indirectly adversely affected by the risks involved in the business of our associated
company, Capital Advisers, in Japan.
Our associated company, Capital Advisers, is a company incorporated in Japan engaged in the
investments in and management of real estate assets, including hotel and residential properties, in
Japan. As at the Latest Practicable Date, Capital Advisers is engaged in investments in respect of 13
hotels, three of which are under construction. Apart from the fluctuations of market values of properties
directly or indirectly invested in by Capital Advisers, its business involves several substantial risks,
including the risks of insufficient funding for its projects, inability to comply with changing laws or
regulations governing its securitisation business, and having only minority control in projects where it is
not the majority investor. We can neither enumerate all such risks nor specify the probability of any loss
due to such events.
A significant portion of our revenue is derived from the Asia-Pacific region and adverse economic
conditions in these markets would adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
For FY2006, a significant portion of our revenue was derived from the Asia-Pacific region. Economic
development has a significant impact on the activities of industries in which most of our customers
operate. Economic conditions in the Asia-Pacific region can be unstable, and other factors such as war,
acts of terrorism, political instability or disease may harm or halt economic growth in the region. For
example, the Asian financial crisis of 2001 created a significant downturn in economic growth which
affected the entire region. Similarly, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome that affected Hong
Kong, the PRC, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam, amongst others, severely impacted the economies of
the affected areas. If a similar wide-ranging health scare, such as a spread of avian influenza or “bird-flu”
or another financial crisis or a large-scale act of terrorism, or any other adverse social or political incident
should occur, the economic conditions in the affected markets would likely be severely harmed. Any
deterioration in economic condition in these regions may result in a decline in demand for financing
arrangements or cause companies to halt their expansion plans. In such cases, our business, financial
condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.
An adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any claim against us could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Our business involves arranging financing transactions for third parties. Although the contracts we enter
into may contain disclaimer provisions against certain potential liabilities, we may still be subject to claims
by clients and could be held liable for our clients’ role in certain circumstances such as disagreement over
the performance of a contract. If this happens, we could be required to pay substantial damages to the
successful claimants. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations.
RISK FACTORS
41


Our business is heavily dependent on our reputation and any adverse publicity could have an
adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
Our business relies to a large extent on relationships and a reputation for delivering quality service to
gain new clients and maintain existing ones. Should we provide a level of service that a client is not
satisfied with or becomes involved with any disputes in respect of a transaction involving us, then we may
suffer damage to our reputation and receive adverse publicity, either of which or together could have an
adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
We may not be able to obtain the financing required to fund our transactions.
In order to finance transactions in which we are involved as either principal investor or finance arranger,
our Group raises financing from various financial institutions with which we have enjoyed positive
relationships. Should such financing not be available in future, our business and financial performance
could be adversely affected.
Our ship investment funds/companies may not be able to purchase or acquire new vessels
meeting our requirements at prices or delivery times acceptable to us.
The ship investment funds/companies that we establish and/or invest in may be required to make down
payments and progress payments during the construction of new vessels, but do not derive any revenue
from these vessels until after their delivery. There can be no assurance that such new vessels will be
completed on schedule or at all. While the ship investment funds/companies may receive penalty
payments from the shipbuilder, experience delays in the delivery of, or failure to deliver, one or more of
the new vessels could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of
operations of the ship investment funds/companies and, in turn, the return on the ship investment
funds/companies that we invest in.
We may be subject to other third-party obligations and contingent liabilities which may affect our
financial performance.
We commonly invest alongside third parties in our direct investment transactions. Our Directors believe
that the inability of co-investors to fulfil their obligations may result in us being required to contribute
additional capital that we did not initially intend to contribute or not completing transactions that we
otherwise might have. It is possible that if the co-investors fail to raise enough funds, we may have to
contribute more capital to achieve our target level of fund raising, and as a result, adversely affect our
cash flow.
We depend on our ability to raise third party funds from time to time to finance direct investment
opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such funds on acceptable terms,
or at all.
In addition, we have provided a guarantee in favour of Xing Long Maritime S.A. (“Xing Long”) to
guarantee the performance by Panmax Tanker S.A. (“Panmax”) of its obligations under a contract
between Xing Long and Panmax for the construction and sale of a 50,000 DWT product tanker (the
“Tanker”) for approximately Yen 4.69 billion (or approximately US$39.5 million) (the “Shipsales
Contract”). Panmax is an SPC established for the purposes of acquiring the Tanker and has been
acquired by the Akebono Fund on 19 June 2007. For further details, please refer to the section entitled
“Business Overview – Alternative Assets Investment – Ship investment” in this Prospectus. As such, we
may be subject to claims by Xing Long in respect of their losses arising from any default by Panmax of its
obligations under the Shipsales Contract. In the event of such claims being made, our financial
performance may be adversely affected. In the event of a default by Panmax of its payment obligations
under the Shipsales Contract, our Company may enforce a share charge provided by Infinite Asset and
acquire Panmax in accordance with the terms thereof. Depending on market conditions, our Company
may either sell the shipbuilding contract or continue the shipbuilding contract and take delivery of the
vessel. If we take delivery of the vessel, we would then have the option to charter it out to third party or
sell it in the open market. If our Company is unable to sell the shipbuilding contract or the vessel (after it
has taken delivery of the vessel) at favourable prices, our financial performance may be significantly
affected.
RISK FACTORS
42


We are exposed to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
We are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and foreign exchange risks.
The invoicing currency of our income is mainly US$. Our operating expenses are mainly denominated in
HK$, US$, Yen and S$, which are the local currencies of the countries in which we currently operate.
Our foreign exchange risk arises mainly from a mismatch between our income and expenses. To the
extent that our income and expenses are not naturally matched in the same currency and to the extent
that there are timing differences in the collections and payments, we may be susceptible to foreign
exchange exposure. Any significant fluctuation in the foreign exchange rates of the principal invoicing
currency of our income against the principal currencies for our operating costs could result in us incurring
net foreign exchange losses and will have an adverse impact on our financial results.
We may enter into hedging arrangements to manage our foreign exchange risks. For further details,
please refer to the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and
Results of Operations – Foreign Exchange Exposure”. However, there is no assurance that such efforts
and our use of hedging arrangements will successfully hedge against all foreign currency fluctuations.
Our consolidated financial statements are presented in US$. Foreign currency transactions are translated
in US$. Such translation can result in foreign currency translation losses which may adversely affect our
financial position.
The Hong Kong dollar has been pegged to the US dollar at the rate of HK$7.80 to US$1.00 since 17
October 1983. In the event that this pegged exchange rate were to be changed or there were to be a
revaluation of the Hong Kong dollar, it could adversely affect our financial results.
The investment in ships is a leveraged investment, therefore, significant rises in the borrowing rate can
adversely affect cash flow and profitability of each ship investment project as charter hire is normally fixed
for the period of charter.
Changes in the accounting, legal and tax regimes could limit the functionality of the financing
structures that we have developed and lessen demand from our clients.
We operate in and across a variety of accounting, legal and tax regimes. Change in these regimes, whilst
providing opportunities, could also limit the functionality of the financing structures that we have
developed for our clients, a large number of which are based on optimising tax efficiency, which could
adversely affect our finance arrangement business. Changes may reduce the efficiency of structures and
hence lessen demand from our clients for these products.
We are subject to claims arising from disputes over the interpretation or enforceability of our
documentation.
We enter into a number of highly structured transactions that require detailed documentation. As a result,
the risk of dispute over interpretation or enforceability of the documentation, or errors in the preparation of
the documentation may be higher than for other investments. As a result, we may be subject to claims
arising from such disputes by our clients or other counterparts. If these claims are successful, we may be
required to compensate the claimant and our financial condition and results of operations may be
adversely affected.
We may not be able to manage our expansion activities effectively.
With respect to our Company’s expansion into new geographic regions, our current approach is to
consider only new geographic and industry sectors that have synergistic potential with our existing
business. Expansion of our operations, including potential expansion into new geographic markets and
products, although undertaken within a strategy of keeping risks low and seeking synergistic benefits,
may result in loss of initial investment costs such as initial capital outlay if not managed effectively. If we
are unable to manage our expansion activities effectively, our financial condition and results of operations
may be adversely affected.
RISK FACTORS
43


We may be affected by terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war.
Terrorist attacks such as those that occurred in the USA on 11 September 2001, and armed conflict such
as the war in Iraq, may negatively affect our business. Political and economic instability in some regions
of the world may also result from such terrorist attacks and armed conflicts and could negatively impact
our financial condition. We are unable to predict the consequences of any of these terrorist attacks or
armed conflicts and we are unable to foresee events that could have a material adverse impact on our
business. In the event of such attacks or conflicts, our business, financial condition and results of
operations may be adversely affected.
RISKS RELATING TO THE INDUSTRIES WHICH WE OPERATE IN 
The financial services industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to keep up with the
competition.
The financial services industry is highly competitive and it is expected to remain so. We compete on the
basis of a number of factors including customer relationships, quality of service, innovation,
responsiveness to customer needs, flexibility, reputation and price. Many competitors have greater
financial and marketing resources and larger customer bases than us. An increase in competition and our
failure to keep up with the intense competition may have a material and adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.
The financial services industry is highly regulated and our business operations may be affected
by future changes in applicable laws and regulations.
As the financial services industry is a highly regulated industry, many aspects of our business, such as
the financing structures adopted, are subject to approvals and exemptions by the relevant authorities.
Changes in such laws and regulations or their interpretation or enforcement may result in us being
required to obtain or not getting the requisite approvals or exemptions required for our business
operations and a consequent increase in our costs of compliance. There can be no assurance that
changes in such laws and regulations or in their interpretation or enforcement, will not have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can also
be no assurance that all regulatory bodies or authorities will take the same view as us with regard to the
interpretation or application of such laws and regulations.
We are subject to the cyclical upturns and downturns in the shipping industry.
We believe that the shipping industry (in particular, the dry bulk, product tanker and container segments)
may undergo a cyclical downturn in business cycle. Factors which may have an adverse effect on the
shipping industry business cycle include a deterioration in the condition of the global economy, a
reduction in the volume of international trade and excess supply of or insufficient demand for maritime
vessels. While a cyclical downturn would directly affect our Company’s direct ship investment through
lower charter income, cyclical upturns may also affect our Company by slowing down our ship acquiring
activities due to high vessel prices. Our financial performance is dependent on the cyclical upturns and
downturns in the shipping industry, and there may be material and adverse impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
The shipping industry is highly competitive, which may result in volatile charter rates and which
may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
The shipping industry is highly fragmented with many owners of vessels and is characterised by intense
competition. The industry is affected by developments in the major world economies that influence trade
patterns and is fragmented among many global, regional and local carriers.
Many of the factors
influencing the supply of and demand for shipping capacity are outside our control and the nature, timing
and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable. Charter rates are based in part on supply
and demand of vessels and are extremely competitive. Over the last decade, charter rates have been
volatile. Our operating results are dependent on, amongst other things, performance of our direct ship
investments, which are, in turn, dependent on the prevailing charter rates in a given time period.
Fluctuations in charter rates may also have an impact on our Company’s investments in ship investment
funds, particularly where the underlying vessels are chartered on a short-term basis. In such cases, the
distributions of interest under the Performance Notes held by us in respect of our investments in such
RISK FACTORS
44


ship investment funds may be lower in the event of lower prevailing charter rates of the vessels under
management by the relevant ship investment funds. This is because such distributions of interest are
generally derived from the charter income of the ship investment funds, less the operating and other
expenses (such as interest expenses) incurred in relation to the relevant vessels. There can be no
assurance that charter rates will be stable or increase over time. In the event that the shipping industry
experiences a downturn, the performance of our direct ship investments as well as investments in ship
investment funds and, in turn, our operating results and overall performance, may be materially and
adversely affected.
Our insurance policies may not provide us with adequate coverage against all risks.
Standard Protection & Indemnity insurance has been arranged for vessels owned by the ship investment
funds/companies that we invest in. However there can be no assurance that all risks are adequately
insured against, that any particular claim will be paid or that adequate insurance coverage can be
obtained at commercially reasonable rates in the future.
The shipping industry is highly regulated and we, or the ship investment funds that we invest in,
may incur additional costs in meeting new regulations or limit our ability to do business.
The shipping industry is highly regulated, and operations of shipowners, including the ship investment
funds which we invest in, are affected by extensive and changing environmental protection laws and other
regulations in the form of numerous international conventions, national, state and local laws and national
and international regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate, as well as in the
country or countries in which such vessels are registered. Compliance with such laws and regulations
may entail significant expenses for shipowners, including the funds/companies which we invest in,
including expenses for ship modifications and changes in operating procedures. In the event that such
additional costs are incurred, the performance of our investment in such funds/companies and, in turn,
our overall performance, may be materially and adversely affected.
We may also incur substantial costs in order to comply with existing and future environmental and health
and human safety requirements, including, among others, obligations relating to air emissions,
maintenance and inspection, development and implementation of emergency procedures and insurance
coverage. Shipowners, including the ship investment funds/companies which we invest in, could also face
substantial liability for penalties, fines, damages and remediation costs associated with hazardous
substance spills or other discharges into the environment involving operations of shipowners, including
the ship investment funds/companies which we invest in, under environmental laws and regulations. Such
costs could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations
of ship owners and in turn, the performance of the ship investment funds/companies we invest in. This
may materially and adversely affect our overall performance.
The operating certificates and licenses of vessels are renewed periodically during each vessel’s required
annual survey. However, government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and
environmental impact may change in the future and require shipowners to incur significant capital
expenditure on their ships to keep them in compliance. In addition, shipowners are required by various
governmental bodies to obtain permits and licenses required for the operation of their shipping business.
These permits may become costly or impossible to obtain or renew. In the event that such additional
costs are incurred, the performance of our investment in such funds/companies and, in turn, our overall
performance, may be materially and adversely affected.
Governments could requisition vessels during a period of war or emergency without adequate
compensation, resulting in loss of earnings.
Governments could requisition or seize vessels for title or for hire. Requisition for title occurs when a
government takes control of a vessel and becomes her owner. Also, a government could requisition
vessels for hire which occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes her
charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war and emergency.
Government requisition of one or more of the vessels owned by the ship investment funds/companies that
we invest in may adversely impact their business, financial condition and operating results. This could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
RISK FACTORS
45


We are subject to the cyclical upturns and downturns in the property industry in the countries
where we have property investments and this may affect the rental yield and capital value of such
properties.
The property industry is affected by cyclical upturns and downturns in its business cycle. Factors which
may have an adverse effect on the property industry business cycle include a deterioration in the
condition of the domestic or global economy, an increase in interest rates, a reduction in business
confidence, an increase in the opportunity cost to investors of investing in real estate relative to other
assets and negative changes to fundamental or speculative demand for real estate. A cyclical upturn may
affect our Company as high property prices may have the effect of lowering our Company’s ability to grow
our property portfolio. Our financial performance is dependent on the cyclical upturns and downturns in
the property industry, and there may be material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.
Our historical financial performance may not be indicative of our future financial performance.
As our revenue and profits may be adversely affected by external factors beyond our control, investors
should be aware that there is no guarantee that we will increase or maintain our historical profit levels
and therefore investors should not take our historical profit levels as an indication of our future financial
performance. Factors which may affect our performance include general economic conditions including
business confidence, inflation rates, interest rates and levels of international trade; government policy,
legislation and/or regulation; and levels of competition within the industries that we operate in.
RISKS RELATING TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR SHARES
Investors in our Shares will face immediate and substantial dilution in the net asset value per
Share and may experience future dilution.
Our Invitation Price is substantially higher than our NAV per Share of 51.7 cents as at 31 December 2006
(adjusted for net proceeds from the Invitation and based on our post-Invitation issued share capital).
Thus, there is an immediate and substantial dilution in the NAV per Share for investors who subscribe for
our Shares pursuant to the Invitation. If we were liquidated for NAV immediately following the Invitation,
each shareholder subscribing to the Invitation would receive less than the price they paid for their Shares.
In addition, if and when we issue new Shares, you may not be able to or may choose not to participate in
an offering of these newly issued Shares, and as a result, you may experience significant dilution in
future. Details of the immediate dilution of our Shares incurred by new investors are described under the
section entitled “Dilution” in this Prospectus.
We may require additional funding for our future growth.
Although we have identified our future growth plans set out in the section entitled “General Information on
our Group – Future Plans” in this Prospectus as the avenues to pursue growth in our business, the
proceeds from the Invitation will not be sufficient to fully cover the estimated costs of implementing all
these plans. We may also find opportunities to grow through acquisitions which cannot be predicted at
this juncture. Under such circumstances, secondary issue(s) of securities after the Invitation may be
necessary to raise the required capital to develop these growth opportunities. If new Shares placed to
new and/or existing Shareholders are issued after the Invitation, they may be priced at a discount to the
then prevailing market price of our Shares trading on the SGX-ST, in which case, existing Shareholders’
equity interest may be diluted. If we fail to utilise the new equity to generate a commensurate increase in
earnings, our EPS will be diluted, and this could lead to a decline in our Share price. Any additional debt
financing may, apart from increasing interest expense and gearing, contain restrictive covenants with
respect to dividends, future fund raising exercises and other financial and operational matters. If we are
unable to procure the additional funding that may be required, our growth or financial performance will be
adversely affected.

You may not be able to attend general meetings of our Company.
Under the Cayman Companies Law, only those persons who agree to become shareholders of a Cayman
Islands company and whose names are entered on the register of members of such a company are
considered members, with rights to attend and vote at general meetings. Depositors holding Shares
through CDP will not be recognised as members of our Company, and will not have a right to attend and
to vote at general meetings of our Company. In the event that Depositors wish to attend and vote at
general meetings of our Company, CDP will have to appoint them as proxies, pursuant to the Articles. For
further details, please refer to the section entitled “Attendance at General Meetings” in this Prospectus.
We are a Cayman Islands incorporated company and the rights and protection accorded to our
Shareholders may not be the same as those applicable to shareholders of a Singapore
incorporated company.
We are incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability under the
Cayman Companies Law. The Companies Act may provide shareholders of Singapore-incorporated
companies with certain rights and protection of which there may be no corresponding or similar
provisions under the Cayman Companies Law. As such, if you invest in our Shares, you may or may not
be accorded the same level of shareholder rights and protection that a shareholder of a Singapore-
incorporated company would be accorded under the Companies Act.
We have set out in Appendix D and Appendix E a summary of the Memorandum of Association and
selected Articles of our Company and a summary of certain provisions under the Cayman Companies
Law. Explanatory statements on specific issues in relation to Cayman Companies Law have been set out
in pages E-1 to E-5 of this Prospectus. Each of the summaries and explanatory statements is not
intended to be and does not constitute legal advice and any person wishing to have advice on the
differences between the Cayman Companies Law and the Companies Act and/or the laws of any
jurisdiction with which he is not familiar is recommended to seek independent legal advice. Copies of the
Memorandum of Association and the Articles of our Company are available for inspection at such place
and time as set out in the section entitled “General and Statutory Information – Documents Available For
Inspection” in this Prospectus.
Singapore law contains provisions that could discourage a takeover of our Company.
The Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers contains certain provisions that may delay, deter or
prevent a future takeover or change in control of our Company. Any person acquiring an interest, either
on his own or together with parties acting in concert with him, in 30.0 per cent. or more of our voting
shares may be required to extend a takeover offer for our remaining voting shares. A takeover offer is also
required to be made if a person holding between 30.0 per cent. and 50.0 per cent. (both inclusive) of the
voting rights in our Company (either on his own or together with parties acting in concert with him)
acquires more than 1.0 per cent. of our voting shares in any six-month period.
These provisions may discourage or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or
threatened change of control of our Company. Some of our Shareholders, who may include you, may
therefore be disadvantaged as a transaction of that kind might have allowed the sale of Shares at a price
above the prevailing market price.
The Invitation may not result in an active or liquid market for our Shares.
Prior to the Invitation, there has not been a public market for the Shares. We cannot predict the extent to
which a trading market will develop or how liquid the market might become. The Invitation Price for the
Shares will be determined by a book-building process by agreement between our Company and the
Manager, Underwriter and Placement Agent, after taking into consideration, inter alia, prevailing market
conditions and estimated market demand for the Shares and may not be indicative of the market price at
which our Shares will trade after the Invitation. You may not be able to resell your Shares at a price that is
attractive to you.
RISK FACTORS
47


Future sales of Shares could adversely affect the prevailing market price of Shares.
The trading prices of our Shares could be subject to fluctuations in response to variations in our results of
operations, changes in general economic conditions, changes in accounting principles, or other
developments affecting us, our customers or our competitors, changes in financial estimates by securities
analysts, the operating and stock price performance of other companies and other events or factors,
many of which are beyond our control. Although it is currently intended that our Shares will remain listed
on the SGX-ST, there is no guarantee of the continued listing of our Shares.
The Singapore securities market is relatively small, which may cause the market price of our
Shares to be more volatile.
The SGX-ST is relatively small and may be more volatile than stock exchanges in the United States and
certain other countries. The relatively small market capitalisation of, and trading volume on, the SGX-ST,
compared to certain other global stock exchanges, may cause the market price of securities listed on the
SGX-ST, including our Shares, to fluctuate more than those listed on larger global stock exchanges.
It may not be possible for Shareholders to effect service of process within Singapore or to enforce
in Singapore any judgment obtained in Singapore or in the Singapore courts upon us or certain
Directors. Judgments of the Singapore courts may also not be enforceable in the Cayman Islands
courts.
We are a company incorporated with limited liability and of unlimited duration under the laws of the
Cayman Islands. Save for Mr. Michio Tanamoto, Mr. Ang Miah Khiang and Mr. Ronnie Teo Heng Hock, all
of our Directors reside outside Singapore. Substantially all of our assets and the assets of such persons
are located outside Singapore. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process
within Singapore upon us or such persons or to enforce in Singapore a judgment obtained in courts
against us or such persons. Judgments of the Singapore courts may not be enforceable in the Cayman
Islands courts.

The above Invitation statistics have been computed on the assumption that the Over-allotment Option is not exercised.
INVITATION STATISTICS
49


Based on the Invitation Price, we estimate that the aggregate net proceeds attributable to us from the
issue of the New Shares in the Invitation (assuming the Over-allotment Option is not exercised) will be
approximately S$32.2 million, after deducting underwriting commissions and other estimated expenses in
relation to the Invitation of approximately S$3.8 million, out of which S$1.3 million was incurred in 2006
and S$2.5 million is estimated to be incurred in 2007.
We intend to use the net proceeds received by us primarily for the following purposes:
(i)
approximately US$12.2 million for investment in the Akebono Fund;
(ii)
approximately US$2.6 million to further finance our investment in Rich Containership S.A., which
will acquire a new container vessel (4,300 TEU) with delivery expected in September 2008; and
(iii)
approximately US$2.4 million for investment in another new container vessel (4,300 TEU) with
delivery targeted for 2008.
The remaining proceeds will be used for other ship investments, distressed assets investments and/or
investments in real estate assets.
To the extent that the net proceeds from the Invitation are not immediately applied for the above
purposes, it is the present intention of our Directors to place such net proceeds on short-term deposits
with licenced banks and/or financial institutions or used for investment in short-term money market or
debt instruments.
For further details on our plans above, please refer to the sections entitled “General Information on our
Group – Prospects” and “General Information on our Group – Business Strategy and Future Plans” in this
Prospectus.
As the Invitation is underwritten on a firm commitment basis, there is no minimum amount which must be
raised from the Invitation.
For each Singapore dollar of the proceeds from the Invitation (assuming that the Over-allotment Option is
not exercised in full):
(i)
approximately 51.4 cents will be used to pay for investment in the Akebono Fund;
(ii)
approximately 11.1 cents will be used to further finance our investment in Rich Containership S.A.,
which will acquire a new container vessel (4,300 TEU) with delivery expected in September 2008;
(iii)
approximately 10.0 cents will be used to pay for investment in another new container vessel (4,300
TEU) with delivery targeted for 2008;
(iv)
approximately 7.0 cents will be used to pay for expenses incurred in connection with the Invitation;
and
(v)
approximately 20.5 cents will be used for other ship investments, distressed assets investments
and/or investments in real estate assets.
If the Over-allotment Option is exercised in full, the additional net proceeds (after the payment of the fees,
commissions and other expenses related to the subscription of the Additional Shares pursuant to the
exercise of the Over-allotment Option) which we will receive is approximately US$3.4 million. Such net
proceeds will be used for the purposes stipulated above, as our Directors may deem appropriate.
USE OF PROCEEDS

In determining our dividends in respect of FY2007, we will take into account factors including the
prevailing state of financial and foreign exchange markets and interest rate levels. Subject to the factors
stated herein, our Directors intend to recommend and distribute up to 50% of our consolidated profits
available for distribution for FY2007.
The amount of our past dividends is not indicative of the amount that we will pay in the future. Future
dividends will be paid by us as and when approved by our Shareholders and Directors. Our Directors may
declare an interim dividend without seeking our Shareholders’ approval. Any such dividend payments will
be subject to the level of our future earnings, cash flow, financial condition, working capital needs,
investment plans and other factors deemed relevant by our Directors, including such legal or contractual
restrictions as may apply from time to time. There can be no assurance that dividends will be paid in the
future or as to the timing of any dividends that are to be paid in the future.
Payments of cash dividends and distributions, if any, will be made in US$ to the CDP on behalf of
Shareholders who maintain, either directly or through depository agents, Securities Accounts with the
CDP
. Except for Shareholders who have elected to receive cash dividends and distributions in US$, the
CDP will convert such proceeds into S$ and cause such S$ to be delivered to the relevant Shareholders’
respective direct Securities Accounts with the CDP or to depository agents for distribution to
Shareholders who maintain securities sub-accounts with such depository agents, as the case may be.
The amount of S$ payable to Shareholders upon conversion of any such cash dividends or distributions
will be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between S$ and US$. Neither we nor the CDP shall
be liable to any Shareholder for any currency exchange loss in respect of any such conversion.
You should note that all the foregoing statements are merely statements of our present intention and shall
not constitute legally binding statements in respect of our future dividends which may be subject to
modification (including reduction or non-declaration thereof) in our Directors’ sole and absolute discretion.
For information relating to taxes payable on dividends, please refer to the section entitled “Taxation” of
this Prospectus.
Our foreign subsidiaries may declare and pay cash dividends to our Company, if any, in the currencies of
their respective countries of incorporation, which may be converted into US$.

At a general meeting held on 26 June 2007, our Shareholders approved, inter alia, the following:
(a)
the adoption of a new set of Memorandum and Articles of Association;
(b)
the increase in our authorised share capital from US$60,000,000, divided into 60,000,000 ordinary
shares of US$1.00 each to US$120,000,000 divided into 120,000,000 ordinary shares of US$1.00

CAPITALISATION AND INDEBTEDNESS
58


Dilution is the amount by which the Invitation Price paid by the subscribers of our Shares in this Invitation
exceeds the NAV per Share after the Invitation. Our NAV per Share as at 31 December 2006 and based
on our pre-Invitation share capital of 175,000,000 Shares, was 51.9 cents per Share.
Based on the issue of 65,400,000 New Shares at the Invitation Price for each New Share pursuant to the
Invitation and after deducting the estimated issue expenses, the adjusted NAV of our Company as at 31
December 2006 would have been 51.7 cents per Share based on the post-Invitation issued and paid-up
share capital of 240,400,000 Shares. This represents an immediate decrease in NAV of 0.2 cents per
Share to our existing Shareholders and an immediate dilution of 3.3 cents per Share to our new investors
pursuant to the Invitation (“New Investors”).
The following table illustrates such dilution per Share:

immediately after the Invitation would be 51.8 cents per Share.
(3)
The computed NAV per Share does not take into account the actual financial performance from 1 January 2007 up to the
Latest Practicable Date. Depending on the actual financial results and the net gain or loss from translation of the financial
statements of our subsidiaries, the NAV per Share may be higher or lower than the computed NAV per Share.

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006
On 17 April 2007, we launched the Akebono Fund in order to take advantage of the Singapore Maritime
Port Authority’s Maritime Finance Incentive (“MFI”) schemes. On 13 September 2006, our wholly-owned
subsidiary, Uni-Asia Capital (Singapore) Limited, was designated as an Approved Shipping Investment
Manager (“ASIM”) under the Income Tax Act, Chapter 134 of Singapore (the “SITA”) by the Singapore
Maritime Port Authority (“MPA”). At the same time, the MPA had also granted a designation of Approved
Shipping Investment Enterprise (“ASIE”), for the Akebono Fund. Our Company has committed to invest in
the Akebono Fund, together with other investors, by way of subscription for a principal amount of
US$42.9 million Performance Notes issued or to be issued by the Akebono Fund pursuant to the terms of
a subscription agreement dated 17 April 2007.
Paragraph 23 of Part IX of the Fifth Schedule to the Securities and Futures (Offer of Investments)
(Shares and Debentures) Regulations 2005 (“SFR”) requires the Prospectus to include pro forma
financial statements for the most recent completed financial year where our Company has, inter alia,
acquired any asset or any entity, or entered into any agreement, to acquire any asset or entity, during the
period between the beginning of the most recent completed financial year and the date of registration of
the Prospectus with the Authority and the net book value of that asset would have accounted for 10% or
more of the net assets of our Group in respect of our most recent completed financial year.
As our total committed investment amount in the Akebono Fund exceeds 10% of the net assets of our
Group for FY2006, we are, accordingly, required under paragraph 23 of Part IX of the Fifth Schedule to
the SFR, to include pro forma financial information in this Prospectus.
In this regard, we have applied to the Authority and the Authority has granted us a waiver from
compliance with the requirement under paragraph 23 of Part IX of the Fifth Schedule to the SFR to
include pro forma financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2006, on the bases set
out below.
We do not have available all financial information on the Akebono Fund’s ship investments from which
such pro forma financial statements can be prepared. Although our Company has identified certain
vessels, consisting of existing vessels and/or newbuilds that were or may be proposed to be acquired by
the Akebono Fund, the actual decision to acquire such vessels may be subject to change. In the event
that the Akebono Fund decides to acquire existing vessels from the funds that our Company currently
invests in, our Company may have access to the financial information relating to the historical
performance of the vessels.
Even if financial information on the potential vessels to be acquired by the Akebono Fund is available, we
believe that it would not be advisable for our Company to rely on such financial information as a basis for
preparing any pro forma financial statements for inclusion in this Prospectus, for the following reasons:
(i)
the historical financial performance of the vessel would not be relevant as the future performance
of the vessel would be dependent on various factors, including deployment and tenure of the
charters and charter rates. Charter rates are dictated by global trends and may differ from year to
year. Given that the factors contributing to the financial performance of the vessel in the current
year may differ from those of previous years, should our Company prepare the pro forma accounts
based on the historical financial information of the vessel, it may be misleading to investors who
may rely on the pro forma accounts in this Prospectus to make an investment decision, as such pro
forma financial information may not be indicative of the future performance of the vessel and,
consequently, our Company; and 
(ii)
our Company may not be in a position to verify the accuracy and validity of such underlying
financial information.
SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA
64


The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements
together with the related notes thereto, all of which are included elsewhere in this Prospectus. This
discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results
may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause
future results to differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are
not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Prospectus, particularly in the section entitled
“Risk Factors”.
OVERVIEW
Uni-Asia is an Asia-based structured finance arrangement and Alternative Assets direct investment firm.
Our principal activities are in: (1) structured finance – the finance arrangement of transport related assets
(such as ships and aircraft), and the provision of ship charter arrangement and agency services; and (2)
Alternative Assets investment/management – direct investments in and/or the arrangement and
administration of Alternative Assets investments such as ships, distressed assets and real estate.
We have an established base of clients that include Evergreen Group, CIDO Shipping Group and
Dainichi-Invest Corporation.
Income
Our income comprises primarily of: (i) fee income; (ii) investment returns; (iii) income from defaulted
loans; (iv) interest income; and (v) other income. Our investment returns comprise mainly realised gain on
investments, return on Performance Notes and fair value adjustments on Performance Notes. Return on
Performance Notes comprises interest income from Performance Notes.
We derive income primarily from four main business segments, namely: (i) structured finance; (ii) ship
investment/management;
(iii) distressed assets investment/management;
and (iv) property
investment/management.
(1)
Structured finance 
This business segment relates to the finance arrangement of transport related assets (such as ships and
aircrafts) and ship charter arrangement and agency services. We act as agent of and participate in the
arrangement of syndicated commercial loans, tax oriented leases, and charter brokerage and we
specialise mainly in shipping in Asia. Our income from structured finance accounted for 18.0%, 39.2%
and 30.8% of our total income in FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006, respectively. In our structured finance
business, our Company will mainly act as finance arranger. As at 31 December 2003, our Company had
been contracted to arrange financing for 10 containerships, for which we would collect a fee of US$0.69
million in respect of each ship (totalling US$6.9 million for all 10 ships), including completion fees of
US$0.55 million per ship (totalling US$5.5 million for all 10 ships). As at 31 December 2006, a total of six
containerships have been delivered and the fees received in respect of these containerships have been
recognised as income for FY2005 or, as the case may be, FY2006. The remaining fees will be recognised
as income in the year of the delivery of the relevant vessels. As at the Latest Practicable Date, two
additional containerships had already been delivered in the first half of FY2007. The third containership is
expected to be delivered in the 3rd quarter of FY2007 and the last containership is expected to be
delivered in the 1st quarter of FY2008.
Although our Company has, historically, participated in syndicated loans, we do not, moving forward,
expect that participation in syndicated loans to be a material component of our income. As such, our
Company does not regard itself to be exposed to any material credit and interest rate risks arising from
participation in syndicated loans. The income received from participation in syndicated loans in FY2004,
FY2005 and FY2006 were not significant, and are set out as follows:

FY2004: US$12,000 (representing 0.08% of the total income for that year)

FY2005: US$10,000 (representing 0.05% of the total income for that year)

FY2006: US$8,000 (representing 0.04% of the total income for that year)
65
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


In this regard, the reference to the line item “Interest income – participation in syndicated loans” in Note 7
to the audited consolidated financial statements of our Company for FY2006 (on page C-24 of this
Prospectus) should be construed as interest income derived from our Company’s participation in the two
bridging loans provided by our Company to Harmonic Shipping S.A. (in respect of US$0.2 million) and
Sunrise Shipping S.A. (in respect of US$0.1 million) and a syndicated loan to Evergreen Marine (UK)
Limited, formerly known as Hatsu Marine Limited (in respect of which our Company’s income from
participation was US$8,000). As at the Latest Practicable Date, the syndicated loan to Evergreen Marine
(UK) Limited has been repaid in full.
Our income from structured finance includes (a) arrangement fee; (b) brokerage fee; and (c) agency fee.
(2)
Alternative Assets investment/management
(i)
Ship investment/management
Our ship investment activities comprise mainly direct and indirect ship investments. Our ship management
activities comprise mainly the arrangement and administration of ships/ship investments held by us
and/or third-parties. Our income from ship investment/management accounted for 64.8%, 49.3% and
56.6% of our total income in FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006, respectively.
Our indirect ship investments include investments made in funds such as the Searex Series I Fund and
the Searex Series II Fund in FY2004. We also act as the administrator and agent of the Searex Series I
Fund and the Searex Series II Fund responsible for managing and arranging debt finance for the funds.
Our income from ship investment/management activities include (a) arrangement fee for arranging
financing for our ship investments made in partnership with other investors as well as, if any, ship
investments by us in principal; (b) administration fee and incentive fee; (c) project management fee; (d)
agency fee; (e) ship charter brokerage fee; and (f) investment returns from our direct investments and our
investments made through investment funds, including fair value adjustments on the Performance Notes
as well as the vessels in which we may have an investment.
(ii)
Distressed assets investment/management
Our distressed assets investment/management activities comprise mainly the investment in and disposal
of distressed assets in Asia (excluding Japan) and/or administration of distressed assets held by us
and/or directly by third-parties. Our income from distressed assets investment/management accounted for
15.8%, 5.6% and 6.0% of our total income in FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006, respectively.
Our income from distressed assets investment/management activities include fees for the provision of
agency, advisory and administration services, incentive fees and investment returns from the recovery of
investments in NPLs including fair value adjustments on the Performance Notes.
(iii)
Property investment/management 
Our property investment in Japan is held through Capital Advisers. Capital Advisers was our wholly-
owned subsidiary before it became our associated company in May 2003 when Capital Advisers raised
new equity capital from a number of independent third-party investors. Prior to May 2003, property
income from Capital Advisers was consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. From May 2003,
equity accounting was applied on property income from Capital Advisers after Capital Advisers became
our associated company.
In 2004, we held a 5.3% interest in AP Real Estate Ltd. (“AP”) and a 10% interest in RS Property
Investment (“RS”). AP and RS are principally engaged in the investment and management of properties
in Japan. As at 31 December 2006, we held Performance Notes of Yen 10,000 (or approximately US$84)
in AP and we no longer have any interest in RS.
66
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Factors affecting our income
The key factors affecting our income include the following:
(a)
the performance of the shipping industry;
(b)
the opportunities in the real estate market in the PRC and other parts of Asia;
(c)
the opportunities available in the distressed assets markets in Asia;
(d)
the fair value of our investments;
(e)
the macroeconomic policies of countries in Asia such as the PRC and Japan; and
(f)
the economic environment in Asia.
Income recognition
Our arrangement fees are recognised on delivery of the asset and upon completion of the transaction
when all obligations associated with the transaction are completed and when the amount of income can
be measured reliably.
Our agency fees and commissions are recognised when pre-agreed duties and functions of acting as an
agent have been rendered.
Our project management fees are recognised on an accrual basis.
Our administration fee, agency fee and incentive fee from distressed loans are recognised as they
crystallise according to the pre-agreed terms of contract.
Our interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective yield basis.
Fair value adjustments on financial assets through profit or loss
Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”). Pursuant to the IFRS, certain financial assets are measured at their fair values. Performance
Notes are investments with income and maturity values which fluctuate based on the distributions
received from underlying assets, which are generally investments in property development companies,
defaulted loans or shipping companies. Fair values of Performance Notes are determined by our interest
in the fair values of each scheme’s underlying assets. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair
value of all securities are recognised in the consolidated income statement as they arise. We recognised
a net gain on fair value adjustments on Performance Notes and other investments of US$1.4 million,
US$1.8 million and US$3.3 million in FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006, respectively.
Employee benefits expense
Our employee benefits expense includes salaries (including Director’s remuneration), pension costs for
defined contribution plans, staff residencies cost and other welfare cost and allowances. Employee
benefits expense accounted for 75.5%, 61.6% and 64.1% of our total operating expenses in FY2004,
FY2005 and FY2006, respectively.
Depreciation expense
Our depreciation expense include depreciation expense for leasehold improvements, depreciation
expense for office equipment, depreciation expense for furniture and fixtures and depreciation expense
for motor vehicles. Depreciation expense accounted for 1.1%, 1.2% and 2.9% of our total operating
expenses in FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006, respectively.
67
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Other expenses
Our other expenses include rental expenses under operating leases for office premises, auditors’
remuneration, travelling and entertainment expense, net foreign exchange loss, professional services fees
and miscellaneous expenses. Other expenses accounted for 27.0%, 37.3% and 32.8% of our total
operating expenses in FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006, respectively.
Operating profit margin
Our operating profit margins for FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006 are 54.5%, 51.3% and 51.3%,
respectively.
Finance cost
Our finance cost comprise of interest expense to financial institutions (non-related companies) being
mainly interest on our bank loans and overdrafts.
Share of profit from associates after tax
Our Group’s share of profit from associates after tax represents our Group’s share of profit in Capital
Advisers and Uni-Ships and Management Limited, and it amounted to US$0.1 million, US$0.6 million and
US$1.9 million for FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006, respectively.
Our Group’s share of profit from associates after tax increased to US$1.9 million in FY2006 from US$0.6
million in FY2005 mainly due to an increase in profit of Capital Advisers in FY2006. Capital Advisers
realised a gain on disposal of its investment in three hotels in FY2006.
Capital Advisers was our wholly-owned subsidiary prior to 2 May 2003 and became our associated
company on 2 May 2003. We currently hold an equity interest of 44.8% in Capital Advisers. Uni-Ships and
Management Limited became our associated company on 25 January 2005 and we maintain an equity
interest of 30.0% of Uni-Ships and Management Limited.
As at 31 December 2006, Capital Advisers invested in and acted as the asset manager of eleven hotels
in Japan. The size of assets under management by Capital Advisers as at the end of FY2006 was Yen
58.5 billion (or approximately US$491.9 million).
Taxation
Our tax on profits has been calculated at rates of taxation prevailing in the jurisdictions in which our
Group operates. As at the Latest Practicable Date, the prevailing corporate tax rates for the various
jurisdictions in which our Group operates are as follows: 17.5% for Hong Kong, 18% for Singapore, 33%
for the PRC and 40.65% for Japan.
Our Company was incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability
under the Cayman Companies Law and, accordingly, is exempted from payment of Cayman Islands
income tax. Apart from Uni-Asia Services and Agency Limited which was incorporated in Hong Kong, our
Company’s other subsidiaries were incorporated in Singapore, Hong Kong, the PRC, British Virgin Islands
and Japan. Offshore Property Investment Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was
incorporated in the British Virgin Islands under the International Business Companies Act of the British
Virgin Islands and was subsequently reregistered under the BVI Business Companies Act, and is
accordingly exempted from payment of the British Virgin Islands income tax.
Our Company conducts our business mainly in Asia and we have accumulated tax losses of
approximately US$6.7 million from Hong Kong as at the end of FY2006. These tax losses will be carried
forward against our future profits which are taxable in Hong Kong.
No deferred income tax asset has been recognised by us in respect of these un-utilised tax losses during
FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward
only to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the future taxable profits is
probable in future, in accordance with our accounting policy.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


FY2005 vs FY2004
Income
Our income in FY2005 increased by 23.4% from US$14.8 million in FY2004 to US$18.3 million in
FY2005 mainly due to an increase in income from structured finance by US$4.5 million and an increase
in interest income from cash and cash equivalents of US$0.6 million, offset by a decrease in distressed
assets income of US$1.3 million.
Structured finance 
Our income from structured finance increased by 168.5% from US$2.7 million in FY2004 to US$7.2
million in FY2005 mainly due to an increase in the value of syndicated loans arranged in FY2005.
We arranged 12 syndicated loans and ship charter arrangement transactions totalling approximately
US$930.2 million and generating US$7.1 million in arrangement, brokerage and agency fees in FY2005,
as compared to five syndicated loans and tax leases totalling approximately US$417.3 million and
generating US$2.6 million in arrangement and agency fees in FY2004.
Ship investment/management 
Our income from ship investment/management in FY2005 was US$9.0 million compared to US$9.6
million in FY2004.
Our income from ship investment/management in FY2005 include fee income comprising arrangement
fees and agency fees of US$1.0 million, administration fees and incentive fees of US$2.5 million primarily
due to the higher level of administration fees received as a result of the launch of the Searex Series I and
Series II Funds, project management fees of US$0.8 million, as well as investment returns comprising
interest on Performance Notes of US$2.5 million and fair value adjustment on Performance Notes of
US$2.4 million.
Our income from ship investment/management in FY2004 include fee income comprising arrangement
fees and agency fees of US$1.3 million, administration fees and incentive fees of US$1.4 million,
investment returns comprising interest on ship investments and Performance Notes of US$2.5 million and
US$2.6 million respectively, fair value adjustment on Performance Notes of US$1.6 million and others of
US$0.2 million.
A second shipping fund Searex Series II Fund with an asset size of approximately US$100 million was
successfully launched in December 2004. This fund contributed a total US$0.4 million fee income and
investment return to us in FY2005. During the year, the Searex Series I Fund sold a small handy size
bulk carrier, Ocean Time, in FY2005.
As at 31 December 2005, our total ship investments through equity shares and Performance Notes
amounted to US$3.7 million and US$9.7 million respectively.
Distressed assets investment/management
Our income from distressed assets investment/management decreased by 56.4% from US$2.3 million in
FY2004 to US$1.0 million in FY2005.
The decrease in income was mainly due to the full recovery in FY2004 of one distressed asset which we
directly invested in which contributed US$1.9 million of income in FY2004. We recorded fee income
comprising agency, advisory, administration and incentive fees of US$0.3 million and investment return
comprising return on Performance Notes of US$0.1 million in FY2004 from AAA Series I Fund and AAA
Series II Fund.
70
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


We recorded fee income comprising agency, advisory, administration and incentive fees of US$0.7 million
and investment return comprising return on Performance Notes of US$0.3 million in FY2005 from AAA
Series I Fund and AAA Series II Funds. As at 31 December 2005, the nominal value of the Performance
Notes outstanding on the balance sheets of AAA Series I Fund and AAA Series II Fund was US$5.3
million (2004: US$5.6 million) of which our share of interest was US$1.7 million (2004: US$1.8 million).
Property investment/management
We recorded interest return on Performance Notes issued by AP and RS of US$0.1 million and fair
valuation gain from our investments in AP and RS of US$0.1 million.
As at 31 December 2005, we held Performance Notes on AP and RS of Yen 10,000 (or approximately
US$84) and Yen 23.2 million (or approximately US$0.2 million) respectively.
Operating expenses
Our operating expenses increased by 32.2% from US$6.7 million in FY2004 to US$8.9 million in FY2005
mainly due to an increase in rental of US$0.2 million following the relocation of our office in Hong Kong,
an increase in employee benefits expense of US$0.4 million due to an increase in our headcount and
salary adjustments, an increase in professional fees of US$0.5 million and an increase in net foreign
exchange loss of US$0.4 million arising from translation losses mainly from our investments in Japan.
Operating profit and operating profit margin
Our operating profit increased by 16.1% from US$8.1 million in FY2004 to US$9.4 million in FY2005. Our
operating profit margin decreased slightly from 54.5% in FY2004 to 51.3% in FY2005. The decrease in
our operating profit margin is mainly due to the increase in our operating expenses relating to an increase
in professional fees by US$0.5 million and office rental expenses by US$0.2 million.
Taxation
Our tax expense increased from US$0.2 million in FY2004 to US$0.5 million in FY2005 mainly due to
higher taxable income recorded in FY2005.
Profit for the year
Based on the foregoing, our profit for the year increased by 18.9% from US$7.9 million in FY2004 to
US$9.4 million in FY2005 mainly due to an increase in structured finance income in FY2005.
FY2006 vs FY2005
Income
Our income increased by 6.6% from US$18.3 million in FY2005 to US$19.5 million in FY2006 due
primarily to a US$2.0 million increase in income from ship investment/management, a US$0.2 million
increase in income from our distressed assets investment/management activities and a US$0.3 million
increase in interest income, offset by a US$1.2 million decrease in income from structured finance and a
US$0.1 million decrease in income from property investment/management.
Structured finance 
Our income from structured finance decreased by 16.3% from US$7.2 million in FY2005 to US$6.0
million in FY2006 mainly due to a decrease in the number and total volume of syndicated transactions
arranged in FY2006.
We arranged six syndicated loans and ship charter arrangement transactions totalling approximately
US$459.9 million and generating US$6.0 million in arrangement, brokerage and agency fees in FY2006
as compared to 12 syndicated loans and ship charter arrangement transactions totalling approximately
US$930.2 million and generating US$7.1 million in arrangement, brokerage and agency fees in FY2005.

Ship investment/management 
Our income from ship investment/management in FY2006 totalled US$11.0 million as compared to
US$9.0 million in FY2005. This increase of US$2.0 million was mainly due to (a) increase of US$1.8
million in investment return in respect of our Performance Notes in Searex I; and (b) an increase of
US$1.3 million in the fair valuation gain due to the improvement of the shipping market, offset by a
reduction of approximately US$1.0 million in fee income derived from ship investment/management.
Our income from ship investment/management in FY2006 include fee income comprising arrangement
and agency fees of US$1.4 million, administration fees and incentive fees of US$1.9 million, as well as
investment returns comprising interest in Performance Notes of US$4.3 million, fair value adjustment on
Performance Notes of US$1.2 million and fair value adjustments on ship investments of US$1.9 million.
As at 31 December 2006, our total ship investments through equity shares and Performance Notes
amounted to US$8.3 million and US$9.7 million respectively.
Distressed assets investment/management 
Our income from distressed assets investment/management increased by 15.5% from US$1.0 million in
FY2005 to US$1.2 million in FY2006.
In FY2006, we recorded fee income comprising agency, advisory, administration and incentive fees of
US$0.7 million and investment return comprising return on Performance Notes of US$0.4 million and fair
value adjustment on performance notes from AAA Series I and Series II Funds of US$0.1 million. AAA
Series I Fund expired in FY2006. As at 31 December 2006, the aggregate nominal value of the
Performance Notes outstanding on the balance sheet of AAA Series II Fund totalled US$2.7 million (the
aggregate nominal value of the Performance Notes outstanding on the balance sheets of AAA Series I
and II Funds totalled US$5.3 million as at 31 December 2005) of which our share of interest was US$0.9
million (our share of interest of AAA Series I and Series II Funds totalled US$1.7 million as at 31
December 2005). Drawdown of AAA Series II Performance Notes took place on 21 December 2006 and
AAA Series I Performance Notes were fully redeemed on 22 December 2006.
Property investment/management 
We recorded fair value adjustment on our investment in Performance Notes in RS of approximately
US$50,000 in FY2006. These Performance Notes on RS were fully redeemed in March 2006. As at 31
December 2006, we held Performance Notes on AP of Yen 10,000 (or approximately US$84).
Operating expenses 
Our operating expenses increased by 6.6% from US$8.9 million in FY2005 to US$9.5 million in FY2006
due primarily to an increase in our rental expenses of US$0.2 million following the relocation of our office
in Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan and an increase of US$0.6 million in employee benefits expense
due to an increase in our headcount and salary adjustments. There was a reduction of foreign exchange
loss of US$0.3 million in FY2006 as compared to FY2005.
Operating profit and operating profit margin
Our operating profit increased by 6.6% from US$9.4 million in FY2005 to US$10.0 million in FY2006. Our
operating profit margin remained consistent at 51.3% for FY2005 and FY2006.
Taxation
Our tax expense was US$0.4 million in FY2006 as compared to US$0.5 million in FY2005. Our tax
expense in FY2006 was mainly attributable to taxable income earned in Singapore and an increase in
deferred tax liability provision made in relation to the withholding tax of 20% that had been withheld in
accordance with Japanese tax laws, in respect of the profits arising from our Company’s investment in
Capital Advisers.

Advisers, our associated company.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our operations have been funded through a combination of cash generated from our operating activities
and external cash reserves. The principal uses of these funds are to meet working capital requirements
and operating costs, and for capital expenditure, repayment of borrowings and investments. We anticipate
that cash generated from our operating and investing activities, together with our cash and cash
equivalents, will be sufficient to fund the operations of our business and meet our current working capital
requirements for the next 12 months.

US$0.6 million, an increase in accounts payable of US$1.9 million and an increase in accrued expenses
of US$1.3 million.

payable of US$2.0 million.
In FY2006, the working capital outflows were mainly the result of an increase in accounts receivable of

FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE
Our foreign exchange exposures give rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements
against the US$, our functional and reporting currency.
As a result of our global operations, we conduct our business in various foreign currencies, principally
US$, HK$, S$ and Yen. Our income is denominated mainly in US$ while our operating expenses are
mainly denominated in HK$, US$, S$ and Yen. Our investments are mainly denominated in US$ and Yen
and our cash and cash equivalents are mainly denominated in US$.
Our foreign exchange risk arises mainly from a currency mismatch between our income and expenses. To
the extent that our income and expenses are not naturally matched in the same currency and to the
extent that there are timing differences in the collections and payments, we may be susceptible to foreign
exchange exposure.
Our net foreign exchange losses are as follows:

During the past three financial years, we have had no significant exposure to foreign currency risk from
our investments. Our exposure to foreign exchange was mainly due to fluctuations between Yen and US$
investments in Japan, including our investment in Capital Advisers, as well as our operations in Japan
and Singapore where our operating expenses are mainly denominated in Yen and S$.
We seek to minimise our exposure to foreign currency movements on certain significant Yen denominated
assets by borrowing a comparable amount of Yen. Our borrowings as at 31 December 2004, 2005 and
2006 amounted to Yen 1.2 billion, Yen 1.1 billion and Yen 0.5 billion respectively (or approximately
US$11.6 million, US$9.3 million and US$4.2 million respectively), hedging against Yen denominated
equity investments in, and shareholder’s loans extended to, Capital Advisers of Yen 1.2 billion, Yen 0.84
billion and Yen 1.0 billion as at 31 December 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively (or approximately
US$11.6 million, US$7.1 million and US$8.4 million respectively).
79
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Moving forward, our Company intends to hedge all ship investments that are not denominated in US$. All
future hedging transactions would be subject to an approval process, including the review of our
Company’s terms by our Management Committee as stated in our Company’s standard operating
procedure (“SOP”) for investments, which sets out certain requirements in respect of such derivatives
transactions:
(a)
A back-to-back guarantee for the forward contract should be arranged with the bank and the
relevant SPC;
(b)
For each forward contract provided to an SPC, the forward contract should be completed within a
maximum period of 6 months;
(c)
For each forward contract entered into by our Company on behalf of the SPC, the contract amount
should not exceed a maximum amount of US$10 million, and the total value of forward contracts
entered into by our Company on behalf of our SPCs should not, at any time, exceed the maximum
amount of US$20 million in aggregate;
(d)
A certain margin on the contract amount should be charged by our Company to that SPC for
providing the financial arrangement;
(e)
The purpose of entering into foreign exchange contracts is limited for hedging purposes only.
Foreign exchange contracts shall not be entered into for the purposes of speculation; and
(f)
The forward contract arrangement should be approved by one of our Executive Directors and our
Company’s head of our finance department, provided that no outstanding contract is expected at
year end.
If one or more of the above criteria is not met, our Company may seek the approval of our Executive
Directors by consulting the Review Committee (in accordance with the procedure as discussed under the
section entitled “Internal Investment Approval Process” on page 125 of this Prospectus). We intend to
minimise our exposure to foreign currency movements on Yen denominated transactions by entering into
forward foreign exchange contracts. As at the end of FY2004 and FY2005, we had no outstanding foreign
exchange contracts. As at the end of 2006, there was a Yen 1 billion (or approximately US$8.6 million)
US$ forward contract outstanding which was guaranteed by a back-to-back arrangement with a shipping
SPC for the equivalent amount in Yen upon maturity of that contract. Moving forward, we may enter into
similar arrangements to hedge future transactions on behalf of our shipping SPCs. As at the Latest
Practicable Date, we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts.
The foreign exchange gain/(losses) on Yen borrowings in FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006 that were offset
against exchange movements on the net investment in Capital Advisers were US$262,000, US$(879,000)
and US$(61,000), respectively.
In FY2006, we continued to undertake the net investment hedge against our investment in Capital
Advisers. We continue to monitor the level of hedging amounts on an ongoing basis.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS, which requires us to
make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect (1) the reported amounts of our assets and
liabilities; (2) the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each fiscal period; and (3)
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each fiscal period. We continually evaluate these
estimates based on our own historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and
other conditions, our expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable
assumptions, which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily
apparent from other sources.
Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial
reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies
require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application.
80
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


When reviewing our financial statements, investors should consider (1) our selection of critical accounting
policies; (2) the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of those policies; and (3) the
sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions.
We believe the following
accounting policies involve the most significant judgment and estimates used in the preparation of our
financial statements.
Financial Assets
We classify our financial assets in the following categories: (a) at fair value through profit or loss; and (b)
loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were
acquired. Management determines the classification of our assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates
this designation at every reporting date.
(a)
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
This category has two sub-categories: ‘financial assets held for trading’ and those designated at fair
value through profit and loss at inception. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated by management.
Derivatives are also categorised as ‘held for trading’ unless they are designated as hedges. Assets
in this category are classified as current assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to
be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
(b)
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that
are not quoted in an active market. These are included in current assets, except for maturities
greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets.
Loans are classified as “Loans Receivable” in the balance sheet.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised at trade date – the date on which we commit to buy
or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial
assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. In the income statement, investments are initially
recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed. Investments are derecognised when the
rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and we have
transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial assets at fair value through
profit and loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Fair values for unquoted securities are estimated by our relevant project team and approved by our
Executive Directors. In determining fair valuation, our project team makes use of market-based
information and fair valuation models such as discounted cash flow models. In many instances, our
project team also relies on financial data of investees and on estimates provided by the management of
the investee companies as to the effect of future developments.
Performance Notes are investments with income and maturity values which fluctuate based on the
distributions received from underlying assets, which are generally investments in property development
companies, defaulted loans or shipping companies. Fair values of Performance Notes or other collective
investment schemes are determined by our Group’s interest in the fair values of each scheme’s
underlying assets. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of all securities are recognised
in the consolidated income statement as they arise.

Fair valuation methodology
Following the admission of our Company to the Official List of the SGX-ST, we will adopt the following fair
valuation methodology for the three categories of investments by our Company:
(i)
Fair valuation on vessels:
Our investments into ships are conducted through our SPCs. There are two components to the fair
valuation exercise involved. There can be a valuation of the underlying vessel or there can be a valuation
on the SPC holding the vessel. The valuation of the underlying vessel would be conducted by an
independent valuer while the fair valuation of the SPC would be to recognise a fair valuation of the net
assets held by the SPC. We have adopted the following process for the internal approval of the fair
valuation of our vessels:
(1)
the valuation of the underlying vessel is first conducted by an independent professional appraiser
such as Marine-Net Co., Ltd.;
(2)
the valuation of the SPCs would be conducted by our relevant asset finance team responsible for
our investment in the relevant SPC. The asset finance team would propose a fair value that would
be submitted to our overall finance department (the “Finance Department”) for their review and
approval;
(3)
our Finance Department would review the fair value proposed by the relevant asset finance team. If
our Finance Department does not agree with the proposed fair value, they will discuss their
concerns with the relevant asset finance team and, if necessary, obtain a second valuation of the
underlying vessel or vessels from another independent professional appraiser. When the proposed
fair value is agreed between our Finance Department and the relevant asset finance team, the
proposed fair value would be submitted to the Audit Committee for their review and approval; and
(4)
the Audit Committee would review the fair value proposed by the Finance Department. If the Audit
Committee does not agree with the proposed fair value, they will discuss their concerns with our
Finance Department and, if necessary, obtain a further valuation of the underlying vessel or
vessels from another independent professional appraiser. The proposed fair valuation is adopted
only after the approval of the Audit Committee has been obtained.
Our fair valuation methodology is as follows: fair valuation exercise at the SPC level would include the
charter income or excess cash which have not been declared or paid to investors. According to IAS 39,
the financial asset that recorded in the balance sheet of an entity shall be measured at fair market value
(“FMV”) through profit or loss at each financial reporting date. Therefore, our Company’s investments in
investee companies that engaged in the business of vessel investments and vessel chartering shall be
measured at FMV at each financial reporting date in accordance with the methodology as described
below:

Using the method of equity pick up, the FMV measurement of investment in each investee
company is the aggregate of:
1)
FMV (See Note 1 below) of vessel owned by the investee company held by our Company;
and
2)
Net Asset Value (“NAV”) (See Note 2 below) of the investee company held by our Company.

Any gain or loss on FMV of investments in investee companies between the current and prior
financial reporting date shall be charged to the profit and loss account for the current financial
reporting period as fair market value gain or loss, provided however that the management
considers no pick-up of FMV gains on the vessel which is under construction. In any event, the
management will not pickup FMV gains on vessels under construction and FMV loss will be
charged to the profit and loss accounts where the vessel has been acquired but not delivered.
82
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



Note 1:
The valuation report is prepared by the independent professional appraiser, currently
Marine-Net Co., Ltd. based on discounted cash flow models. Such valuation would be carried out
particularly in the case where the investee company accounts for its vessels at book cost or market
value.

Note 2:
NAV is determined based on the management account of the investee company as at
each financial reporting date.
(ii)
Fair valuation on distressed assets investments:
As our Company has no direct investments into NPLs, any fair valuations on NPLs would be done at
funds level. In the case of AAA Series I and II funds, AAA Strategic Investment Limited (“AAA”) would
conduct a fair valuation of its NPL investment portfolio at half yearly interval. With regards to its
methodology, AAA would combine the discounted future streams of projected cash recovery of its NPL,
and each NPL
’s future steam of projected cash recovery is in fact assessed independently. Since the
circumstance of each NPL varies, there is no standard benchmark for the discount rate to apply.
Determination of the appropriate discount rate to apply to each NPL
’s future cash flow is subjective and
will depend on the prevailing condition of that particular NPL. However subjective it may be, AAA has
been conservative in its application and mostly takes into consideration future cash recovery streams with
degree of certainty. AAA also applies discount rates as much as 40% to 50% to minimise any possible
over-estimation of the recoverable amount.
(iii)
Fair valuation on property investments:
Our investment in properties would be classified into investments with either long term or short to
medium term investment purposes. For long term investment projects (which are principally investment
assets with the intention to hold the property on a long-term investment purposes for at least three
years), our Company will adopt the net assets valuation methodology by discounting the expected
cashflow from the investment project. For short to medium term property projects (which are principally
investment assets for trading purposes and which are held for one to two years), a fair valuation may be
conducted by an external valuer.
General internal approval procedure
The internal approval process for making fair value adjustments involves the submission of each
department’s separate fair valuation for each reporting period to our Company’s Finance Department. In
evaluating the fair value adjustments proposed by each department, the Finance Department would
consider, among other things, whether it agrees with the assumptions as reported by each department.
The fair value adjustments approved by the Finance Department will be subject to the final approval of
our Company’s Audit Committee’s approval. If our Audit Committee disagrees with any of the proposed
fair valuation adjustments, our Audit Committee may require the Finance Department and/or the relevant
departments proposing the fair value adjustments, to re-evaluate the fair value adjustments.
Although our Directors use their best judgement in estimating the fair value of investments, there are
inherent limitations in any estimation techniques. Future confirming events will also affect the estimates of
fair value and the effect of such events on the estimates of fair value, including the ultimate liquidation of
investments, could be material to these consolidated financial statements.

POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
In FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006, we prepared our financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The
new/revised IFRS became effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and we had
earlier adopted the following standards in FY2004:

IAS 28 (revised 2003) ‘Investments in Associates’

IAS 31 (revised 2003) ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’

IAS 32 (revised 2003) ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’

IAS 39 (revised 2003) ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’
In particular, the early adoption of these standards resulted in a change as to how we accounted for
certain investments. Previously we had equity accounted for certain investments which were classified as
our associates. Under the revised scope of IAS 28, these associates are required to be remeasured at
fair value through profit or loss.
Where applicable, the FY2003 comparative figures were amended to
take into account of the remeasurement of associates in accordance with the transitional provisions of the
revised standard.
In FY2005, we adopted all applicable new/revised standards under the IFRS. The adoption of these
new/revised standards resulted in some changes to the accounting policies of our Group. Please refer to
Appendix B – “Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2005”
of this Prospectus for details of our Group’s accounting policies.
IAS 39 (Amendment) The Fair Value Option came into effect from 1 January 2006. This amendment
changes the definition of financial instruments classified at fair value through profit or loss and restricts
the ability to designate financial instruments as part for this category. We believe that this amendment
should not have a significant impact on the classification of financial instruments, as we should be able to
comply with the amended criteria for the designation of financial instruments at fair value through profit
and loss. We have applied this amendment from annual periods beginning 1 January 2006.
IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and a complementary Amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of
Financial Statements – Capital Disclosures (effective from 1 January 2007). IFRS 7 introduces new
disclosures to improve the information about financial instruments. It requires the disclosure of qualitative
and quantitative information about exposure to risks arising from financial instruments, including specified
minimum disclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including sensitivity analysis to
market risk. It replaces IAS 30, Disclosures in the Financial Statements of Banks and Similar Financial
Institutions, and disclosure requirements in IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation. It
is applicable to all entities that report under IFRS. The amendment to IAS 1 introduces disclosures about
the level of an entity’s capital and how it manages capital. We assessed the impact of IFRS 7 and the
amendment to IAS 1 and concluded that the main additional disclosures will be the sensitivity analysis to
market risk and the capital disclosures required by the amendment of IAS 1. We will apply IFRS 7 and
the amendment to IAS 1 from annual periods beginning 1 January 2007.

GROUP STRUCTURE

CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT 
We were established as an exempted company with limited liability in the Cayman Islands under the
Cayman Companies Law on 17 March 1997 by founders Motokuni Yamashiro, Kazuhiko Yoshida, Michio
Tanamoto and Takanobu Himori who were Japanese bankers. Each of the founders has over 25 years
experience in the banking industry working in corporate loan syndication and structured finance
arrangement. Mr. Himori left our Company in March 2004. The other founders continue to lead the
business and as at the Latest Practicable Date, they own, directly and indirectly, a significant aggregate
equity interest in Uni-Asia of approximately 23.9%.
Our Company was founded to arrange structured finance transactions for companies mainly in the
shipping and, to some extent, aviation industries. Our initial focus was on finance arrangement for
companies in the transport sector. Our business expanded to include investment in alternative assets
such as NPLs, distressed assets, shipping assets and real estate assets in May 1998.
We provide a range of customised structured finance solutions and services such as the arrangement of
ship and aircraft leases, mortgage financing, charter arrangements for vessels, tax-enhanced leases and
loans and balance sheet management for clients. Since our establishment up to the end of 2006, we have
arranged financing for transactions in the form of loans and/or leases transactions worth approximately
US$5.6 billion. In FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006, we arranged structured finance transactions totalling
US$561.6 million, US$987.5 million and US$637.7 million respectively.
In May 1998, we entered the distressed assets market in the aftermath of the Asia economic crisis when
local governments and banks in Asia were seeking to dispose of their non-performing loan assets or
NPLs. Initially, we focused on acquiring NPL accounts represented by PRC-based borrowers from
Japanese banks with whom our management had established relationships, either as Uni-Asia’s client or
industry contact. We expanded our NPL investments over time by carefully identifying, selecting and
negotiating the purchase of distressed assets with attractive financial returns. Most of these NPLs were
sourced through our client network or through brokers.
We also invested in NPLs through AAA, a private investment company, held by a charitable trust but
administered by us, which invested in NPLs in Asia. We, along with a Japanese financial institution,
subscribed to Performance Notes issued by AAA in August 2001, up to a maximum face value of US$5
million.
In August 2001, we invested US$1.0 million in, and acted as the administrator and agent of, our first
Asian distressed assets investment fund known as AAA Series I Fund with a size of US$5.0 million. As at
31 December 2006, this fund’s net IRR was approximately 156.6%. In July 2003, we launched a second
US$15 million Asian distressed assets investment fund, called AAA Series II Fund which is also held
through AAA. As at the Latest Practicable Date, this fund’s net IRR was approximately 20.44% assuming
that the value of AAA Series II Fund is realised as at the Latest Practicable Date. We are also the
administrator and agent of AAA Series II Fund, bringing the total funds under management within this
division to US$20 million. We together with the same Japanese financial institution in AAA Series I Fund
invested US$5 million and US$10 million respectively in AAA Series II Fund. Both investment facilities
focus on distressed asset investment opportunities in Asia, excluding Japan. (Please refer to the section
entitled “General Information on our Group – Business Overview – Distressed assets investment” below
for further details of the AAA Series I Fund and AAA Series II Fund.) As at the Latest Practicable Date,
the AAA Series I Fund has expired and the Performance Notes have been fully redeemed.
In 2002, we set up an asset finance department to focus on asset-backed financing in the maritime
transport sector. This division gradually diversified into making direct investments in shipping assets.
Building on our experience in investing in maritime vessels, our first shipping investment fund Searex
Series I Fund with an asset size of up to US$117.5 million was launched in January 2004 through private
investment company Searex which is held by a charitable trust. We subscribed for Performance Notes of
US$5 million in the fund along with five other investors based in Asia. By 2004, this fund had invested in
six vessels. We arranged a non-recourse loan of US$100.5 million for the ship portfolio.
GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP
87


A second shipping investment fund Searex Series II Fund which is also held through Searex and with an
asset size of up to US$100 million was successfully closed in December 2004. By 2005, this fund
acquired five vessels. Like Searex Series I Fund, we subscribed for US$5 million of Performance Notes in
Searex Series II Fund along with other institutional investors in Asia. We arranged financing of around
US$77 million for the ship portfolio.
We are the administrator and agent of both Searex Series I Fund and Searex Series II Fund, responsible
for managing and arranging debt finance for the funds.
As part of our continued growth, Uni-Ships and Management Limited was incorporated in January 2005
in Hong Kong to provide accounting and administration services for the fund vehicles and act as the
project manager for the Searex Series II Fund. Uni-Ships and Management Limited is a joint venture
between Maritime 24 (Pte) Ltd, Uni-Asia, Uni-Fast Limited and Wealth Ocean with each having a
shareholding of 30%, 30%, 30% and 10% respectively.
In April 2005, the number of investors in the Searex Series II Fund increased to 10 through the
introduction of another institutional investor which acquired US$0.5 million in Performance Notes at par
from us. In August 2006, we redeemed US$1.3 million Performance Notes and we acquired an additional
US$1.4 million Performance Notes from Uni-Fast Limited in September 2006. Following such redemption
and acquisition, we held a total of US$4.7 million Performance Notes in the Searex Series II Fund. As at
the Latest Practicable Date, the Performance Notes of Searex Series II Fund have been fully redeemed.
In July 2005, the aggregate principal of the Searex Series I Fund was increased from US$17 million to up
to US$19.4 million. We subscribed for an additional US$705,882 in Performance Notes issued by the
Searex Series I Fund.
A third private shipping joint venture, the container vessel fund, was launched in 2005, specialising in
investment in container vessels. We, together with three partners, invested in three panamax 3,500 TEU
container vessels for US$56.3 million each, or an aggregate of US$168.9 million. The vessels will be built
by Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co Ltd, Korea with delivery in 2007. Our Company, with 38% equity interest in
the shipping joint venture, arranged financing for the three vessels. The container vessels have been
chartered out to Italia Marittima of the Evergreen Group under an eight-year bareboat charter agreement,
commencing on delivery of the vessels in 2007.
On 13 September 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Uni-Asia Capital (Singapore) Limited, was
designated as an ASIM under the SITA by the MPA. At the same time, the MPA had also granted the
Akebono Fund a designation of ASIE.
Our ASIM designation is for an initial period of 10 years commencing on the subscription date of the
Singapore fund by investors, subject to a review by MPA at the end of the fifth year. Pursuant to our ASIM
designation, we are eligible for a concessionary tax rate of 10% for income derived from managing an
ASIE such as the Akebono Fund. In the event that we no longer qualify for the ASIM designation, the
prevailing corporate tax rate of 18% will apply.
The ASIE designation for the Akebono Fund is for an initial period of up to 10 years commencing from
the date of its establishment, subject to a review by MPA at the end of the fifth year. Pursuant to its ASIE
designation, the Akebono Fund is eligible for a tax exemption on income derived from the chartering or
finance leasing of (a) any sea-going ship to (i) a person who is neither resident in nor a permanent
establishment in Singapore; or (ii) an approved international shipping enterprise; or (b) any sea-going
Singapore ship to persons described in (a) (i) and (ii) above or a shipping enterprise within the meaning
of Section 13A of the SITA. The tax exemption will be valid for the life of vessels acquired by ASIE during
the incentive period of up to 10 years. For instance, if an ASIE acquires a vessel during the 10-year
incentive period, charters it for 20 years and disposes of it thereafter, lease income on the charter will
enjoy tax exemption for the entire 20 years. The qualifying income of the Akebono Fund under the tax
exemption shall also include hedging gains derived in connection with the management of its portfolio of
vessels, and share of profits or dividends remittances from shipholding special purpose vehicles owned
by the Akebono Fund that are declared out of qualifying activities.
GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP
88


On 17 April 2007, we launched our first Singapore fund, the Akebono Fund, in order to take advantage of
the MPA’s MFI schemes. Our Company has invested in the Akebono Fund, together with other investors,
by way of subscription for a principal amount of US$42.9 million Performance Notes issued by the
Akebono Fund.
Going forward, our ship investment division is expected to continue to look for joint venture investments in
shipping assets.
In addition to our investments in shipping assets, we have also invested in real estate assets.
In June 1998, we commenced investments in real estate in Japan. In February 2000, Capital Advisers
was established as our wholly-owned subsidiary engaged in investment in and management of real
estate assets in the hotel and residential sector. The equity size of each investment ranged from US$1.4
million to US$38.5 million.
In 2000, our Company and Grosvenor Asia jointly established an investment partnership with another
investor to invest in residential properties in Tokyo. Grosvenor is an international property development
and investment group. It has regional operating companies covering Australia, Asia Pacific, US, UK and
Europe and an international fund management business which operates across all these markets. The
investment started in 2000 and was followed in 2004 with the establishment of the GCAP Fund. The
GCAP Fund is jointly managed by Grosvenor Asia and Capital Advisers through Grosvenor Capital
Advisers Fund Management Co., Ltd.
In the residential sector, Capital Advisers has also been engaged in asset management with a focus on
small-size studio apartment buildings since February 2004. The number of the buildings of this investment
reached 10 in 2004, 31 in 2005 and 50 in 2006. The investor to this investment is one of the largest
financial institutions in Japan. Capital Advisers sometimes joins in this investment as a developer of the
buildings in order to enjoy additional return.
In 2001, Capital Advisers directed its attention to the asset management business in the hotel property
investment. In the hotel sector, Capital Advisers mainly focuses on the investment in limited-service
hotels. Since 2001, the number of hotels which Capital Advisers has engaged in as the asset manager
and invested in as a minority investor has increased to 11 in 2006. The characteristics of Capital Advisers
as the asset manager in hotel property investments is its capability to not only manage the assets but
also monitor the hotel operation itself by keeping the staff who have sufficient work experience in hotel
business within Capital Advisers. Capital Advisers invested in another asset management company which
manages a Japanese real estate investment trust (J-REIT) specializing in hotel properties. The J-REIT
was listed in Japan on 14 June 2006. As at 31 December 2006, the total asset of the hotel investments
was over Yen 16.9 billion (or approximately US$142.5 million). The total equity invested was about Yen 5.4
billion (or approximately US$45.5 million), out of which Capital Advisers had an interest of between 5.0%
and 51.9%.
On 2 May 2003, the equity base of Capital Advisers increased to Yen 892.5 million (or approximately
US$7.4 million) as a result of an issue of 9,850 new shares to a number of institutional investors, venture
capital firms, corporations etc. The total funds raised amounted to Yen 985 million (or approximately
US$8.2 million). The subscription price of Yen 100,000 (or approximately US$832) per share was
determined with reference to a valuation conducted by Partners C.P
.A. Office, an independent certified
public accountant. As a result, our equity interest in Capital Advisers was diluted to 44.8% with Capital
Advisers becoming our associated company.
In January 2007, we made a direct investment into office units in Guangzhou, the PRC, through our
wholly-owned property investment company, Uni-Asia Guangzhou. Going forward, we will continue to look
for investment opportunities in distressed properties and/or other properties in the PRC and other parts of
Asia.
GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP
89


BUSINESS OVERVIEW
We are an Asia-based structured finance arrangement and Alternative Assets direct investment firm. Our
principal activities are in: (1) structured finance – the finance arrangement of transport related assets
(largely ships and, to some extent, aircraft), and the provision of ship charter arrangement and agency
services; and (2) Alternative Assets investment/management – direct investments in and/or the
arrangement and administration of Alternative Assets investments such as ships, distressed assets and
real estate. As at the Latest Practicable Date, we have 32 staff in three offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and
Singapore.
Structured Finance 
Our structured finance department provides an integrated service to our clients by offering financing
solutions together with charter arrangement services tailor-made to our clients’ needs. The solutions do
not normally involve the use of our balance sheet capital to make loans. We typically act only as the
arranger and agent for the structured financing provided by third-party financial institutions. We arrange
financing for asset acquisitions by our clients and also offers tax-enhanced structured services and
products, including mortgage financing, tax-oriented leases such as UK tax leases and Japanese

syndicated loan financing. Our clients include established international shipping and aviation companies
from Taiwan, Greece, Indonesia, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, the UK and Italy.
Some key products and services which we offer our clients include mortgage financing, tax-oriented
leases, ECA backed credit, ship charter arrangement and balance sheet management.
The following table provides a brief description of our key products:
Product
Description
Mortgage financing
A type of finance arrangement where the borrower will mortgage the asset as a
collateral for the loan
Tax-oriented lease
A financing structure which takes advantage of tax incentives and benefits within
a jurisdiction in order to minimise cost of capital for investors or to maximise tax
savings for investors. The economic benefits are eventually shared between the
investors and the lessee. The cost savings stem from fixed asset depreciation
and tax allowances. Types of tax-oriented leases include UK tax leases and
Japanese operating leases 
ECA backed credit
Co-financing with export credit agencies including the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation (“JBIC”)
Ship charter arrangement
The arrangement of charters for ship owners that want to charter out their
vessels to third-parties or the arrangement of vessels for potential charterers
who are looking for ships to charter. Types of charter arrangement include
bareboat charter, being the charter of bare ship; or time charter, being the
charter under which owner charters out vessel to charterer together with ship
management including crew, insurance and technical management, for a fixed
period of time
Balance sheet management
The service of reviewing and analyzing the balance sheet of a client and
structuring and tailoring financing alternatives that would best suit the financial
position of our client

We acted as arranger for structured financing in the form of loans and leases in the aggregate amount of
approximately US$561.6 million, US$987.5 million and US$637.7 million in FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006
respectively.
The type of structured finance arrangement we are engaged in is tailor-made to the specific requirements
of our clients and the asset to be acquired. Typically, potential projects usually commence with a detailed
due diligence review of the risks and return in relation to the clients. During the due diligence, we
investigate the asset to be acquired, examining among other things its specifications, condition and legal
title of the asset to be acquired. Our client’s financial condition and ability to repay the debt are also
assessed. Factors such as the intended use of the asset and the market demand for driving the asset’s
intended utilisation all factor into the assessment of the viability of the project. The findings and
conclusions of the due diligence and analysis are then submitted to our Management Committee which is
responsible for approving the proposal to engage our clients. Upon approval and engagement, we will
assist our clients in the preparation of an information memorandum. This information memorandum
contains a detailed summary of the asset, the acquirer, the industry or sector, the proposed terms of the
financing, and financial analysis of the project. The information memorandum is then presented to
targeted institutions. Those institutions which express interest in providing finance are then given the
opportunity to perform their own independent due diligence and eventually one or more institutions are
selected which best matches the terms requested by our clients. Throughout the entire process, we act
as a co-ordinator between our clients and the lender to manage the process and help the counterparties
agree on the terms of finance.
Following the execution of a loan agreement and related documents between our clients and the
syndication group, we would usually also act as the facility agent responsible for the administration of the
syndicated loan during the life of the loan, for which we receive agency fees.
Selected key transactions completed include:
UK Tax Lease for Hatsu Marine: Uni-Asia arranged two UK tax leases for Hatsu Marine, a part of the
Evergreen Group, in 2002 to acquire two 6,332 TEU E-type container vessels manufactured by Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries, Ltd. Under these transactions, two European banks financed the acquisition of two
US$71.5 million container vessels which were delivered in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Upon delivery,
the vessels were leased to Hatsu Marine under a finance lease agreement on terms satisfactory to all
parties.
Arrangement of a Japanese Operating Lease: Uni-Asia arranged a Japanese Operating Lease for a
Japanese leasing company in March 2002 to acquire a 1,618 TEU container vessel for US$29 million and
delivery by the end of March 2002. Under this structure, the lessor, the Japanese investors introduced by
Uni-Asia and a Japanese leasing company, entered into a Tokumei Kumiai agreement to own and charter
ships, whereby the Japanese investors invested 30% of the purchase price of the vessel in the TK and
the remaining 70% financing was in the form of debt. Upon delivery, the vessel was chartered to a third-
party shipping company for a period of 11.5 years by way of a Bareboat Charter.
Ship Charter Arrangement for Niki Shipping Company Inc: Niki Shipping Company Inc, a private company
incorporated in Greece and which is an independent third-party, entered into shipbuilding contracts in
September 2004 for four 5,060 TEU container vessels to be built by Hanjin Heavy Industries in Korea.
Uni-Asia arranged a 15-year Bareboat Charter between Niki Shipping Company Inc and Italia Marittima,
part of the Evergreen Group, for the four container carriers.
Mortgage Financing for CIDO Holding Co., Ltd.: Uni-Asia and HSH Nordbank, an independent third-party
financial institution which is also a shareholder in Uni-Asia, jointly arranged a US$127.8 million
syndicated loan in March 2005 for CIDO Holding Co., Ltd which is an independent third-party
incorporated in the Cayman Islands, to acquire four 4,075 unit type pure car carriers, with delivery from
March 2006 to September 2007. The loan was successfully syndicated out to third-party lending
institutions.

JBIC Financing: Uni-Asia arranged a US$113.8 million financing for Evergreen in the acquisition of two
6,724 TEU container vessels using a buyer’s credit provided by JBIC and Nippon Export and Investment
Insurance in the first half of 2006. The two container vessels, manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd., will be delivered in October and December 2007, respectively. In this financing structure,
JBIC will fund 40% of the facility amount and the remaining 60% will be funded by a consortium of
lenders. The facility agreement was signed in July 2006.
Alternative Assets Investment 
Our Alternative Assets Investments division leverages on our specialist skills in structured finance
arrangement and credit analysis to invest in, either as the principal investor or in partnership with other
investors, three key Alternative Asset classes: (i) ship investment (such as bulk carriers, product tankers
and container vessels); (ii) distressed assets investment (including NPLs and other distressed assets in
Asia (excluding Japan)); and (iii) property investment (including hotel and property investment in Japan
and commercial property investment in the PRC).
Ship investment 
As a progression from our structured finance business as an arranger of financing for transport related
assets, we branched out into direct investments in ships through equity investment in the ship owning
companies and also through subscription of Performance Notes issued by special investment fund
vehicles established by us.
Our asset finance department aims to invest in ships for commercial use that will produce attractive
investment returns because of factors such as high expected demand for, or anticipated shortfall in, the
supply of such ships.
In order to further facilitate our Group’s investments in ships and leverage on this area of our expertise,
our Group established two closed-end investment funds in 2004, Searex Series I Fund and Searex Series
II Fund, with an investment term of five years each. The equity of the investment funds is held through
Searex which, in turn, is held by a charitable trust to ensure the funds function as a whole as an
independent entity in accordance with recognised corporate principles. Investors participate in the ship
investments by subscribing for Performance Notes issued by the ship investment fund. Performance
Notes obligate the holder to provide the committed investment amount to the fund over a two-year
drawdown period as the fund calls for funds to invest. Profits from the sale of the ships are distributed on
a pro-forma basis to Performance Note holders semi-annually at the discretion of the fund. By
establishing these ship investment funds, we benefit not only from the larger capital pool available for
investment, providing risk diversification; we also earn administration fees and incentive fees based on
the performance of such funds.
In 2002, we participated in two bulk carriers’ new building projects, namely, EuroAsia II, Inc. and EuroAsia
III, Inc., in Japan. The total investment cost or acquisition price of each vessel was US$16.8 million. Our
Group made an investment of US$0.6 million in EuroAsia II, Inc. and US$0.5 million in EuroAsia III, Inc.,
representing a 15% equity interest in EuroAsia II, Inc. and EuroAsia III, Inc. The outstanding balance was
financed by debt from independent financial institutions. Our Group’s investment into EuroAsia II, Inc. and
Euroasia III, Inc. was made in the form of share capital and shareholder’s loan. In addition to share capital
of US$1,500 each into the two projects, we made shareholders’ loan of US$0.6 million to EuroAsia II, Inc.
and US$0.5 million to EuroAsia III, Inc. Our Company’s investment in EuroAsia III, Inc. was completed
and disposed of in October 2004 resulting in a capital gain of approximately US$1.5 million. Our
Company’s investment in EuroAsia II, Inc. was disposed of in April 2007, resulting in a capital gain of
approximately US$2.8 million. Our net investment return after factoring in fair value adjustment was
US$1.3 million.

In 2006, we invested in the equity of two SPCs each holding a bulk carrier, namely, Harmonic Shipping
S.A. (“Harmonic”) and Sunrise Shipping S.A. (“Sunrise”). The total investment made by our Group into
Harmonic totaled US$2.1 million comprising share capital of US$4,040 and shareholders’ loan of US$2.1
million. In addition, we also provided a bridging loan of US$3.0 million to Harmonic as at 31 December
2006. The investment made by our Group into Sunrise totaled US$2.7 million comprising share capital of
US$4,600 and shareholders’ loan of US$2.7 million. In addition, we provided a bridging loan of US$2.22
million to Sunrise which was repaid and renewed to US$2.5 million as at 31 December 2006. Our
Company’s investment in Harmonic was disposed of in April 2007, resulting in a capital gain of
approximately US$2.8 million. Our net investment return after factoring in fair value adjustment was
US$2.4 million. The bulk carrier held by Sunrise is chartered to a third party for a period of five years
commencing in September 2006.

We also act as the administrator, registrar and fiscal agent of the Searex Series I Fund and the Searex
Series II Fund (collectively, the “Searex Funds”), for which we charge a monthly fee for each ship held by
the Searex Funds. We are also engaged under a number of management agreements with individual
special purpose vehicles, each of which directly hold the shipping assets, to arrange financing for the
acquisition of a ship by the special purpose vehicle, for which we charge a financing arrangement fee and
may also receive an incentive fee, subject to the financial return of the ship upon disposal. Each acquired
ship is held by a special purpose vehicle established by each of the Searex Funds. The individual special
purpose vehicles also appoint a project manager, which is responsible for sourcing and negotiating
employment of vessels held by the special purpose vehicle and remarketing of ships for disposal. The
project manager of the Searex Series I Fund is Exeno Yamamizu and the project manager of the Searex
Series II Fund is Uni-Ships and Management Limited. Exeno Yamamizu is one of the largest shipping
brokers in Asia and their client network covers major shipping companies. Uni-Ships and Management
Limited is a joint venture between Maritime 24 (Pte) Ltd, Uni-Asia, Uni-Fast Limited and Wealth Ocean
where each has a shareholding of 30%, 30%, 30% and 10%, respectively.
 
Searex Series I Fund
In January 2004, the ship investment fund Searex Series I Fund was established with funding
raised by an issue of Performance Notes totalling US$17.0 million by Searex. We subscribed for
US$5.0 million of the Performance Notes and five co-investors subscribed for the remaining
US$12.0 million of the Performance Notes. We arranged a non-recourse loan for the fund in the
amount of US$100.5 million. There are a total of six investors in Searex Series I Fund, including
Uni-Asia, which are companies engaged in shipping related businesses.
As at the Latest Practicable Date, the Searex Series I Fund held one ship and had disposed of five
ships. The return on investment on the five disposed ships was approximately 3.7 times our
investment and distributions paid out in 2004, 2005 and 2006 have amounted in aggregate to
approximately US$14.5 million in principal and US$30.5 million in profit in relation to these five
ships. The one ship currently held by Searex Series I Fund is chartered out. This ship is proposed
to be acquired by the Akebono Fund in the second half of 2007 or early 2008, following which the
Searex Series I Fund will be terminated.

Searex Series II Fund
In December 2004, we established a second ship investment fund following the success of Searex
Series I Fund. The principal investment amount of the Searex Series II Fund was US$23.0 million
of Performance Notes. The investors of the Searex Series II Fund comprised all the investors of the
Searex Series I Fund, which includes our Company, and three new investors. The other investors in
the Searex Series II Fund are independent parties. We subscribed for US$5.0 million of the
Performance Notes and eight co-investors subscribed for the remaining US$18 million of the
Performance Notes. The number of investors in the Searex Series II Fund was increased to 10 in
April 2005 when another investor acquired US$0.5 million of Performance Notes from us at par
value. Our total commitment to the fund was reduced to US$4.5 million. In August 2006, we
redeemed US$1.3 million of Performance Notes and we acquired an additional US$1.4 million of
Performance Notes from Uni-Fast Limited in September 2006. Following such acquisition, we held
a total of US$4.7 million Performance Notes in the Searex Series II Fund. On 9 May 2007, our
Performance Notes in the Searex Series II Fund were redeemed in full, following which we no
longer hold any outstanding Performance Notes in the Searex Series II Fund. We arranged
financing of around US$77 million, giving the Searex Series II Fund a total investment capability of
up to US$100.0 million.
Searex Series II Fund has disposed of five ships. The return on investment on the five disposed
ships was approximately 1.4 times our investment. No distributions were paid out under the fund for
2004 and 2005 and distributions paid out in 2006 amounted in aggregate to approximately US$0.6
million. Following such disposals, the Searex Series II Fund is intended to be terminated.

Recent ship investments
On 2 May 2007, we made an investment in a Panama-incorporated company, Rich Containership
S.A. (“Rich Containership”), through a joint venture with Wisdom Marine Lines S.A. (“Wisdom”).
Wisdom is not related to our Company, the Directors or the Substantial Shareholders of our
Company. Pursuant to the joint venture, we have subscribed for a 50% equity interest in Rich
Containership for a total consideration of US$5,000. The remaining 50% equity interest in Rich
Containership is held by Wisdom. On 6 September 2006, Rich Containership entered into a
contract with, inter alia, Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co., Ltd. in respect of the purchase option of a
4,300 TEU container vessel, which is due for delivery in September 2008. On 3 May 2007, we
made a shareholder’s loan of approximately US$1.0 million to Rich Containership.
On 28 May 2007, we made another investment in a Hong Kong-incorporated company, Matin
Shipping Limited (“Matin”), through a joint venture with Uni-Fast Limited (“Uni-Fast”). Uni-Fast is
not related to our Company, the Directors or the Substantial Shareholders of our Company.
Pursuant to the joint venture, we have subscribed for a 40% equity interest in Matin for a total
consideration of US$400. The remaining 60% equity interest in Matin is held by Uni-Fast. As at the
Latest Practicable Date, Matin is in the process of entering into a contract with, inter alia, Imabari
Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. to acquire a 37,300 DWT bulk carrier, which is expected to be delivered in
2011. On 31 May 2007, we made a shareholder’s loan of approximately US$1.2 million to Matin.
As the vessels to be acquired by Matin and Rich Containership are in the process of being built
and will only be delivered in 2011 and 2008 respectively, the Auditors of our Company have
confirmed that the investments by our Company in Matin and Rich Containership will have no
impact on the profit and loss statement for FY2006 as set out in Appendix C of this Prospectus,
had they been made at the beginning of FY2006. In addition, the Auditors have also confirmed that
had these investments been made at the end of FY2006, they would also have no significant
impact on the balance sheet as set out in Appendix C of this Prospectus, other than the
reclassification of the cash amount of US$2,203,162 (being the aggregate amount for the
subscription for shares and provision of shareholder loans in Matin and Rich Containership), to
“Investments” under the said balance sheet.

Ship Investment Portfolio
As at the end of FY2004, the total value* of our ship investment portfolio (comprising vessels
owned by ship-owning companies in which we have an interest and vessels owned by investment
funds in which we have an interest) was approximately US$149.4 million. Through various
acquisitions and disposals of vessels since the end of FY2004, the total value* of our ship
investment portfolio has increased to approximately US$403.0 million as at the Latest Practicable
Date. Please refer to the section entitled “Alternative Assets Investments – Ship investment” at
page 92 of this Prospectus for more information.
The following table sets out the value* of vessels in our ship investment portfolio, with a breakdown
of the value* of vessels owned by ship-owning companies in which we have an interest and
vessels owned by investment funds in which we have an interest, as at the end of each of FY2004,
FY2005, FY2006 and as at the Latest Practicable Date.
Notes:
(1)
The decrease in portfolio size was due to disposal of vessels in FY2006. The value* of vessels disposed during the
period totalled US$37.8 million in 2004, US$71.0 million in 2005, US$89.6 million in 2006 and US$78.8 million from 1
January 2007 up to the Latest Practicable Date.
(2)
The increase in the value of the vessels owned by investment funds in which our Company has an interest, from
US$66 million as at 31 December 2006 to US$105 million as at the Latest Practicable Date, is due primarily to the
launch of the Akebono Fund in April 2007. As at the Latest Practicable Date, the Akebono Fund held two ship
investments - Sentic Limited (where the acquisition price of the underlying vessel is US$26.4 million) and Panmax
Tanker S.A. (where the acquisition price of the underlying vessel is US$46.7 million). The increase in the value of the
vessels in which our Company has an interest, from US$236 million as at 31 December 2006 to US$298 million as at
the Latest Practicable Date, is due primarily to our Company’s investments in Rich Containership S.A. (where the
acquisition price of the underlying vessel is US$71 million) and Matin Shipping (where the acquisition price of the
underlying vessel is US$31 million).

Selected key transactions completed:
Mortgage Financing and Equity Syndication for Searex: Uni-Asia acted as the finance arranger for
Searex for a US$100.5 million non-recourse loan in January 2004. The proceeds were used by
Searex to acquire six vessels in 2004. Searex issued US$17.0 million of Performance Notes to
investors out of which we subscribed for US$5.0 million, representing 29.4% of the total issued
Performance Notes. The remaining 70.6% of the Performance Notes were issued to third-party
investors. This deal demonstrates our track record as finance arranger and alternative investment
administrator.
Multiple roles as investor, administrator and fiscal agent of Searex: In addition to being an equity
investor, we also acted as administrator and fiscal agent for Searex. For Searex Series I Fund, six
vessels comprising bulk carriers and tankers were acquired in 2004 and 2005. As at the Latest
Practicable Date, the fund disposed of five vessels and the remaining vessel is currently chartered
out to third-party operators. As the investor of the fund, we were able to share in the investment
returns of the fund. As the fund administrator and fiscal agent, we received performance bonus
along with annual administration fees.
Container vessel joint venture: A third private shipping joint venture between us and three other
partners was launched in 2005 specializing in investment in container vessels. This joint venture
invested US$56.3 million each in three panamax 3,500 TEU container vessels, or US$168.8 million
in total. The vessels are being built by Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co Ltd, Korea with delivery in 2007.
Uni-Asia, with a 38% equity interest in the shipping joint venture, arranged financing for the three
vessels. The 38% equity interest of our Company in the shipping joint venture comprises (i)
US$380 paid in capital; and (ii) up to US$0.9 million in a shareholder’s loan. The container vessels
have been chartered out to Italia Marittima of the Evergreen Group under an eight-year bareboat
charter agreement, which has commenced following delivery of two vessels in April 2007 and June
2007.
We have established a special purpose company in Panama, Panmax Tanker S.A. (“Panmax”),
which entered into a contract with Xing Long Maritime S.A. (“Xing Long”) on 28 November 2006
for the construction and sale of a 50,000 DWT product tanker for approximately Yen 4.69 billion (or
approximately US$39.5 million) (the “Shipsales Contract”). We provided a guarantee to Xing Long
to guarantee the performance by Panmax of its obligations under the Shipsales Contract, including
the obligation to pay for the price of the vessel. The guarantee will remain effective until the
fulfillment of all obligations of Panmax under the Shipsales Contract. The following table sets out

shareholder for the due performance of the contractual obligations of Xing Long. We also provided
a bridging loan of 10% of the contract price to Panmax for payment of the first 10% of the contract
price. Such bridging loan is targeted to be repaid around May 2008, or earlier if Panmax refinances
the bridging loan with a third-party financial institution. Upon such refinancing, the bridging loan
provided by our Company would be discharged and we would be paid in full. On 19 June 2007, the
entire issued share capital of Panmax, comprising 100 nil-paid shares of par value US$100 each,
was transferred to Infinite Asset from the nominee company then holding such shares. With the
completion of the transfer, Panmax became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Infinite Asset.
Subsequently, Infinite Asset paid an aggregate amount of US$10,000 in respect of the then-unpaid
amounts on the shares, upon which the shares became fully-paid shares in the capital of Panmax.
Upon transfer of Panmax to the Akebono Fund, Infinite Asset has undertaken to indemnify us from
all claims which may arise from any default by Panmax of its obligations under the Shipsales
Contract. Such indemnity is supported by a share charge given by Infinite Asset in favour of our
Company over the entire share capital of Panmax. In the event of any default by Infinite Asset on
its obligations under its indemnity to us, the share charge allows us to take over the ownership of
the shares of Panmax on the tenth day after any such default by Infinite Asset. Our Directors
believe that the exposure of our Company in giving the guarantee to Xing Long would be mitigated
since we would, in the event of any default by Infinite Asset under its indemnity, be entitled to take
possession of Panmax, which we may subsequently sell to other third-parties. It is the commercial
intention of our Company that such sale would only take place if a replacement guarantee is
obtained from the buyer of the vessel, to replace the guarantee given by our Company to Xing
Long (subject to the credit standing of the replacement guarantor being acceptable to Xing Long).
In addition, our Directors believe that the likelihood of a default by Panmax is mitigated by the fact
that a material portion of the additional funds required by Panmax to fulfil its payment obligations
under the Shipsales Contract would be provided by further issuances of Performance Notes by the
Akebono Fund to investors who have already committed to subscribe for a total of US$42.9 million
principal amount of Performance Notes, from time to time up to April 2010, of which US$11.5
million is intended to be utilised towards funding the payment obligations of Panmax. Nonetheless,
in the event of a default by Panmax of its payment obligations under the Shipsales Contract, the
GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP
98


commercial intention of our Company is to enforce the share charge and acquire Panmax in
accordance with the terms thereof. Depending on market conditions, our Company may either sell
the shipbuilding contract or continue the shipbuilding contract and take delivery of the vessel. If we
acquire Panmax and take delivery of the vessel, we would then have the option to charter it out to
third-party or sell it in the open market. These would, again, depend on the prevailing market
conditions at the time. As at the Latest Practicable Date, the net asset value of Infinite Asset was
US$7.7 million. Infinite Asset is a shipholding SPC and its only material assets are currently
Panmax Tanker S.A. (which will own a product tanker) and Sentic Limited (which owns a bulk
carrier).
Distressed Assets Investment 
We started to invest directly in distressed assets in 1998 to capitalise on opportunities for us to use
our own capital to purchase NPLs and other distressed assets in Asia (excluding Japan) including
the PRC, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Korea. We usually invest
in NPLs through special investment fund vehicles established by us and which issue Performance
Notes to Uni-Asia itself and selected institutional co-investors to raise funding for distressed assets
investments.
Our NPL investment strategy is to leverage on our network of industry contacts to find opportunities
that satisfy our criteria of high cashflow generation and a significant asset base on which we can
get security. Opportunities are sourced through a network of industry contacts which include
financial institutions, such as banks, and accounting firms active in NPL transactions. We aim to
recover the NPLs and exit the investments to realise a return through various debt recovery
policies. Debt collection and monitoring of individual NPL transactions are applied either through an
agent bank, receiver or liquidator, or led by us if the asset is located in the PRC, Taiwan or Hong
Kong. We focus on the recovery of the debt repayments under the NPLs. We do not actively
engage in the secondary trading of NPLs in which we buy distressed assets with the specific
purpose of on-selling to another purchaser of NPLs.
Between 1998 and 2004, we made six direct investments that included 24 NPL accounts with a
value of approximately US$30.5 million and realised a return of over eight times our investment
within the period of approximately six years.
We also invest in distressed assets through AAA, a Cayman Islands incorporated investment
vehicle that is held by a charitable trust. AAA functions independently from Uni-Asia in accordance
with recognised corporate principles. AAA was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on 26 July
2001, and registered in Hong Kong on 14 August 2001. It has two distressed assets investment
funds, AAA Series I Fund and AAA Series II Fund, funded by the issuance of Performance Notes
to us and a third-party independent Japanese financial institution. AAA Series I Fund and AAA
Series II Fund were established in August 2001 and July 2003 respectively.
The Performance Notes under the AAA Series I Fund and the AAA Series II Fund obligate the
holder to provide the committed investment amount to the fund over a two-year drawdown period
as the fund calls for funds to invest. Proceeds from the recovery of NPLs are distributed to
performance noteholders semi-annually at the discretion of the fund.

AAA Series I Fund 
AAA Series I Fund is a distressed assets investment fund with the financial capability to invest up
to US$5.0 million with a five-year term and two-year drawdown period. This fund has closed and
the Performance Notes have been fully redeemed. We committed US$1.0 million as principal when
the AAA Series I Fund was started in August 2001. AAA Series I Fund had an internal rate of
return of approximately 156.6% from its inception in 2001 to 31 December 2006 based on 22 NPL
investments, each representing an NPL account. The AAA Series I Fund has expired as at the
Latest Practicable Date.
GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP
99



AAA Series II Fund
AAA Series II Fund is a distressed assets investment fund with the financial capability to invest up
to US$15.0 million with a five-year term and two-year drawdown period due to expire in September
2008. We committed US$5.0 million as principal when the AAA Series II Fund was formed in July
2003.
AAA Series II Fund has made 19 NPL investments representing 58 NPL accounts since July 2003
to the Latest Practicable Date. The two-year drawdown period ended in July 2005 and the recovery
period will end in July 2008.
The AAA Series I and AAA Series II Funds target distressed or non-performing loan opportunities in Asia
(excluding Japan) in the manufacturing, leasing, finance and hotel property sectors. The aim is to realise
an investment return of over 20% within a 1-5 year time horizon. As at 31 December 2006, the PRC and
Hong Kong accounted for approximately 80.2% of the total nominal value of AAA’s NPL investments of
US$70.3 million and the rest are located in Thailand, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines.
We also act as the administrator of the distressed assets investment funds providing administration
services such as monitoring, book-keeping and reporting services. We earn an administration fee on the
drawdown of funds (for investment into NPLs) and an incentive fee for investment out-performance
against a target hurdle rate. We also earn an agency fee for services to be provided in our capacity as
the registrar and the fiscal agent of the funds.
We have made arrangements with an administrative services provider in the PRC to carry out
administrative and clerical services (such as appointment booking and minute taking), including any
administrative work or liaison work with our PRC contacts. Other than the registration with the
Administration for Industry and Commerce of Guangzhou (as stated in the section entitled “General
Information on our Group – Regulations governing our Group’s activities in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore
and the PRC – Scope of our activities in the PRC” in this Prospectus), we do not require any registration
or licensing under PRC law for our activities in the PRC that arise only from the management and
administration of the debtors of our NPLs who are located in the PRC.
Selected key transactions completed include:
Restructuring and recovery of a leasing company in the PRC: We acquired a 40% equity interest in a joint
venture leasing company in the PRC in 1998 and took over the management of the restructuring and
recovery exercise of the joint venture’s non-performing assets. The joint venture leasing company was
sold to a third-party in 2004.
Liquidation of Pacific Leasing: We acquired the NPLs of Pacific Leasing, a sino-foreign joint venture
leasing company in Shanghai, in 1999. Pacific Leasing was an independent third-party company
incorporated in the PRC. In 2000, Pacific Leasing’s license expired and it entered into a period of
voluntary liquidation. We became the largest creditor with a 31.1% exposure to Pacific Leasing’s total
debt. The recovery measures and efforts taken by us were successful and highlighted our strong workout
techniques and strategies. Pacific Leasing set a precedent in Shanghai as:

the first bankruptcy case applied by overseas creditors

the first bankruptcy case against a sino-foreign joint venture leasing company in the PRC

the first bankruptcy case against non-bank financial institutions licensed by MOFTEC
The case was accepted by the court, and Uni-Asia and related parties finalised the lawsuit successfully in
December 2002. Our Company has recovered 22.59% out of the total registered debt owed to us by
Pacific Leasing. Following the liquidation of Pacific Leasing, there were no further outstanding amounts
that remained recoverable.

Property Investment
Property Investment and Management - Japan
We invest in real estate in Japan through Capital Advisers. Capital Advisers focuses on investment in and
management of residential and hotel related real estate assets in Japan. It seeks investments across a
range of locations with a focus on balanced risk and return. Capital Advisers was established in 1998 as
our wholly-owned subsidiary. In May 2003, Capital Advisers raised Yen 985 million (or approximately
US$8.2 million) in shareholders’ equity capital from a number of independent third-party investors as part
of its strategic expansion. Our shareholding interest in Capital Advisers was diluted to 44.8% and as a
result, Capital Advisers became our associated company.
Capital Advisers, by itself or in cooperation with its business partners, looks for the appropriate property
to invest in. At the initial stage of the investment, it arranges the investment structure, establishes a SPC
which owns the property in the form of a trust, arranges equity contribution to the SPC, arranges non-
recourse loan from financial institutions on behalf of the SPC. Capital Advisers itself may invest in the
SPC as a minority investor. Capital Advisers also acts as the asset manager of the assets owned by the
SPC and manages the SPC’s assets including the invested property on behalf of the SPC, eventually on
behalf of the investors. At the end of the investment period or sometimes during the investment period, in
order to maximise investors’ return, Capital Advisers also engages in a selling procedure as the asset
manager. Capital Advisers manages over Yen 58.5 billion (or approximately US$491.9 million) in assets
which includes a contribution of approximately Yen 2.0 billion (or approximately US$16.8 million) of its
own capital as at the end of 2006.

Property Investment - Japan
In 2000, we, through our then wholly-owned subsidiary Capital Advisers, established an investment
partnership with Grosvenor Asia to invest in residential properties in Tokyo.
The Grosvenor Group is an international property development and investment group. It has
regional operating companies covering Australia, Asia Pacific, the Americas, Britain and Ireland
and Continental Europe and an international fund management business which operates across all
these markets.
The investment partnership was followed by the establishment of the GCAP Fund in 2004. The
GCAP Fund is jointly managed by Grosvenor Asia and Capital Advisers through Grosvenor Capital
Advisers Fund Management Co., Ltd. and is anticipated to grow to more than Yen 20 billion (or
approximately US$194.4 million) when fully invested based on its historical borrowing capability
and committed equity funds of Yen 6.3 billion (or approximately US$61.2 million).
The equity size of each investment fund ranged from US$1.4 million to US$38.5 million. The equity
investors to the funds are financial institutions, real estate companies and corporations mainly
based in Japan and Southeast Asia. Capital Advisers itself invested Yen 2.0 billion (or
approximately US$16.8 million) as a minority equity investor as at 31 December 2006.

Hotel Properties Investment - Japan
In 2001, Capital Advisers directed its attention to the asset investment/management business in
the hotel property sector. In the hotel property sector, Capital Advisers focuses mainly on
investment in limited-service hotels. The number of hotels in which Capital Advisers has been
engaged in as asset manager and invested in as minority investor totalled 11 by the end of 2006.
Capital Advisers, as the asset manager in hotel property investments, employs a team which is
experienced in the hotel sector and not only manages the hotel assets but also monitors the hotel
operation itself. The total asset of the hotel investments was over Yen 16.9 billion (or approximately
US$142.5 million) as at 31 December 2006. The total equity invested was about Yen 5.4 billion (or
approximately US$45.5 million), of which Capital Advisers’ interest ranged from 5.0% to 51.9%. In
GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP 
101


relation to the hotel property investment, in 2004, Capital Advisers invested in another asset
management company engaged in Japanese real estate investment trust which specialises in hotel
properties and which was listed in Japan on 14 June 2006. In view of Capital Advisers’ growth and
expansion strategy, they may from time to time consider various fund raising options, such as new
equity injection. In the event of a new equity injection, our interest in Capital Advisers may be
diluted.

Residential Investment - Japan
Since February 2004, Capital Advisers has also been engaged in the investment in and asset
management of residential properties, with a focus on small-size studio apartment buildings. The
number of these type of buildings managed and/or invested in by Capital Advisers reached 10 in
2004, 31 in 2005 and 50 in 2006.
Capital Advisers earns an arrangement, asset management and administration fee for its services
as the asset manager of the property investment portfolio. It also participates in the return to
investors in the portfolio as a minority equity investor in the property investment funds.
Principal Investments in Properties - PRC
In January 2007, we established a wholly-owned property investment company, Uni-Asia Guangzhou, in
Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, the PRC, with a paid-in capital of US$3.0 million. Our Group will
continue to explore property investment opportunities in the PRC under new property guidelines
introduced by the PRC government in July 2006, and property investment opportunities in Southeast
Asia. At the end of June 2007, Uni-Asia Guangzhou completed the acquisition of 14 office units with
gross floor area of 1,304 sq m of the China Shine Plaza, a commercial development in the Tianhe
commercial district in Guangzhou. We intend to lease the office units to third-parties.
SALES AND MARKETING
We conduct sales and marketing activities out of our three offices in Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.
We use our network of industry contacts and existing client base, built up from over nine years of
establishing the business to source for investment opportunities. Most marketing activities in structured
finance advisory are done directly where senior professionals meet existing and potential clients to
provide proposals for transactions or advice on existing deals. We also receive referrals from our existing
clients and business partners with whom we have developed relationships.
Co-investors of the direct investment funds we invested in are sourced primarily through our broad
network base and client relationships. Our Directors believe that we have repeatedly demonstrated an
ability to secure ties with strategic partners and co-investors in each of our Alternative Assets investment
funds due to our extensive contact base. Likewise, deals are also sourced through our internal contact
base along with sourcing agents and industry referrals.
MAJOR CLIENTS 
For FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006, we generated total fee income from our five largest clients of
approximately US$5.0 million, US$9.9 million and US$8.8 million, respectively, representing 90.2%,
80.8% and 89.2% of our total fee income during the corresponding period. The aggregate fee income
received from our clients as a proportion of our total income was approximately 34.1%, 54.1% and 45.4%
for FY2004, FY2005 and FY2006 respectively.

BUSINESS PARTNERS 
Relationship with HSH Nordbank
We have a close working relationship with HSH Nordbank, one of our shareholders and the largest
shipping bank in the world focusing on container vessels, tankers, bulk carriers and roll-on-roll-off ships.
HSH Nordbank has a strong presence in Germany, Scandinavia, Greece, and the United States, although
clients from across Europe and Asia represent a significant portion of their credit portfolio. We act as a
marketing intermediary for HSH Nordbank in Asia in sourcing maritime transactions and also partner
HSH Nordbank in arranging debt syndication.
A recent example where we and HSH Nordbank worked in partnership was in arranging the US$127.8
million term loan facilities for CIDO Holding Co., Ltd. to finance the purchase of ships. We and HSH
Nordbank as joint coordinating arrangers, project-managed the transaction and marketed the transaction
to debt syndicate lenders. HSH Nordbank was also the senior lender being the underwriter to the loan.
In addition, HSH Nordbank was a co-lender in the Searex Series I Fund.

we have acted as administrator, registrar, fiscal agent and sometimes finance arranger for transactions
and Exeno Yamamizu has been overall project manager. Exeno Yamamizu is one of the largest shipping
brokers in Asia and their client network covers major shipping companies. This cooperation has brought
us a broader market coverage in terms of chartering and sale and purchase of vessels. A new joint
venture company, Uni-Ships and Management Limited, was established in 2005 to carry out the
responsibilities of project manager for Searex Series II Fund.
Relationship with Grosvenor Asia 
Grosvenor is an international property development and investment group. It has regional operating
companies covering Australia, Asia Pacific, the United States, Britain and Ireland and Continental Europe

its ownership and management of the Mayfair and Belgravia estates in Central London, Grosvenor is one
of the largest, private real estate companies in the UK and has been operating in Asia for over 10 years.
In 2000, we and Grosvenor Asia jointly established an investment partnership with another investor to
invest in residential properties in Tokyo. This was followed in 2004 with the establishment of the GCAP
Fund. The fund is jointly managed by Grosvenor Asia and Capital Advisers through Grosvenor Capital
Advisers Fund Management Co., Ltd.
Relationship with CMTB
CMTB is one of the largest trust banks in Japan and our 10.7% Shareholder. We collaborated with CMTB
through Capital Advisers, our then wholly-owned subsidiary, to invest in property projects in Japan and in

REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR GROUP’S ACTIVITIES IN HONG KONG, JAPAN, SINGAPORE
AND THE PRC
Overview
Scope of our activities in Hong Kong 
Our operations are principally conducted from Hong Kong, although the activities which we carry on in
Hong Kong do not comprise activities that require our Company or any of our subsidiaries to be licenced
in Hong Kong.
Structured Finance 
In relation to our structured finance business, we act as an arranger of financing, but do not ourselves
lend money to third-parties. We are accordingly not required to be regulated under the Banking
Ordinance (Cap. 155 of the Laws of Hong Kong) nor do we require a licence for the purposes of the
Money Lenders Ordinance (Cap. 163 of the Laws of Hong Kong).
In relation to the advice which we impart to third-parties in relation to our structured financing activities,
such advice does not constitute advising in relation to securities for the purposes of the SFO as the
relevant products arranged for third-parties comprise bank loans, finance leases or other banking-specific
products. Moreover, such advice does not amount to corporate finance advice for the purposes of the
SFO, again because the relevant products do not constitute securities as defined in that Ordinance.
Alternative Assets Investment 
In relation to the fund structures which we have devised and established for the purposes of effecting
investment by us, as principal, and by co-investors, in both ships and NPLs (and other distressed assets),
the various roles performed by us do not fall to be regulated under the SFO.
We act as administrator, registrar and fiscal agent of the two funds, the Searex Series I Fund and the
Searex Series II Fund, dedicated to investment in ships, and the two funds, the AAA Series I Fund and
the AAA Series II Fund, dedicated to investment in distressed debt assets, being typically NPLs.
Each of the fund vehicles, namely Searex and AAA, is a limited liability company, in each case, managed
by the board of directors of the relevant company. It is the responsibility of each such board to originate
and implement all transactions relevant to the fund, including acquisitions and disposals of the underlying
investments. In this regard, prior to implementing any such transaction, the relevant fund vehicle reports
to a monitoring committee that represents the parties who have invested in the underlying notes (namely,
the Searex Series I Notes and the Searex Series II Notes, or the AAA Series I Notes and the AAA Series
II Notes, as the case may be).
The composition of the monitoring committee of the Searex Series I Fund comprises five individuals, two
of whom are our representatives (the other three being the representatives of other investors in the
Searex Series I Notes). The composition of the monitoring committee of the Searex Series II Fund
comprises seven individuals, one of whom is our representative (the other six being the representatives of
other investors in the Searex Series II Notes). In cases where the relevant fund (Searex Series I Fund
and Searex Series II Fund) proposes to implement any investment related matter, such as acquiring or
disposing the shares of a single purpose vehicle, itself owning a ship, Searex prepares a report for the
monitoring committee which, having raised any queries, has the right to issue, or not issue, a “notice of
GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP
106


awareness”. Should such a notice be issued, Searex may, but is not obliged to, proceed with the
transaction. If such a notice is not issued, Searex would internally consider suitable modifications be
made to the proposal such that it might become acceptable to the investors. The monitoring committee for
the Searex Series I Fund and the Searex Series II Fund acts on the basis of a simple majority of its
monitoring committee members, and is therefore not under our control.
In the case of the AAA Series I Fund and the AAA Series II Fund, each is operated along lines similar to
those described above. Accordingly, management of both such funds resides in the board of directors of
AAA itself. The monitoring committee applicable to both the AAA Series I Fund and the AAA Series II
Fund comprises three individuals, two of whom are our representatives. All decisions of the monitoring
committee concerning the issue, or not, of a “notice of awareness” require the unanimous consent of the
committee’s members, meaning that the monitoring committee is not under our control.
Our Directors have given due consideration to the question of whether or not any of the activities of our
Company fall under the regulation of SFO and are aware, in particular, that the following constitute
“regulated activities”:

dealing in securities (requiring a type 1 licence);

advising on securities (requiring a type 4 licence);

asset management (requiring a type 9 licence).
Our Directors are satisfied that we do not perform any activity that is regulated under the SFO, in which
regard, our Directors confirm that Uni-Asia does not deal in or manage assets for and on behalf of the
relevant funds, either in our capacity as administrator or as one of the parties represented on the various
monitoring committees. Moreover, our Company does not provide any form of investment advice to the
funds in relation to their respective investment decisions.
Finally, our Directors have noted that, in any event, the underlying assets of both the Searex Series I
Fund and the Searex Series II Fund and both the AAA Series I Fund and the AAA Series II Fund would
not, generally, be considered as “securities” for the purposes of the SFO. In the case of the Searex Series
I Fund and the Searex Series II Fund, the underlying investments are made through special purpose
vehicles, each a private company (within the meaning of section 29 of the Companies Ordinance) which,
in turn, owns the underlying ship. Securities in such private companies are expressly exempted from the
definition of securities in the SFO. Moreover, the underlying assets of the AAA Series I Fund and the AAA
Series II Fund generally comprise NPLs, being assets that would not ordinarily be considered as
securities for the purposes of the SFO.
In relation to our Company’s role as subscriber to the Funds, a money lender’s licence is not considered
by our Directors to be necessary as our Company’s ordinary business does not primarily or mainly
involve the lending of money, in the ordinary course of that business.
Scope of our activities in Japan 
We have one subsidiary in Japan, Uni-Asia Finance Corporation (Japan), involved in finance arrangement
in Japan and the provision of related advisory services.
Uni-Asia Finance Corporation (Japan) has obtained a registration from the Governor of Tokyo Prefecture
to carry on the business of money lending (the registration being transliterated as a “Kashikingyo
Touroku”). The registration which expired on 26 December 2006 was renewed and extended to 26
December 2009 and remains in full force and effect. So far as our Directors are aware, no other licences
or registrations are necessary for Uni-Asia Finance Corporation (Japan) to carry on its business in
accordance with its current scope and practice.
However, Uni-Asia Finance Corporation (Japan) will have to apply for newly created registration under the
new Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the “Law”) (presently the Securities and Exchange Law) if
it will be engaged in the solicitation to potential clients to acquire interest in general or limited partnership
or Tokumei Kumiai. The new Law extends the coverage of the regulation to such interest which has not
been regulated. The major part of the Law, including the registration regulation will enter into force on
such date on or before 13 December 2007 as will be designated by the Cabinet Order.
GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP
107


In addition, we have a 44.8% interest in Capital Advisers Co., Ltd., a company which invests in and
manages certain real estate assets, including hotel and residential properties.
Capital Advisers has obtained:
(i)
a registration from the Governor of Tokyo Prefecture to carry on the business of money lending (the
registration being transliterated as a “Kashikingyo Touroku”). The current registration expires on 17
September 2007 and remains in full force and effect;
(ii)
a Housing and Property Dealer Licence (transliterated as a “Takuchi Tatemono Torihikigyo
Menkyo”) which expires on 30 August 2007 and remains in full force and effect; and
(iii)
a registration from the Prime Minister to carry on the business of selling interest in the various trust
funds (such registration being transliterated as “Shintaku-Juekiken Hanbaigyo Touroku”) which
expires on 17 May 2008.
However, Capital Advisers will in the future have to apply for newly created registration under the new
Financial Instruments and Exchange Law mentioned above, unless it changes the modes of transactions
it structures. The new Law extends the coverage of regulation to such products as have not been under
any regulation. Also, the above “Shintaku-Juekiken Hanbaigyo Touroku” will be abolished and uniformly
regulated with other business of financial products under the new Law. We understand that Capital
Advisers intends to seek registration under the new Law. When such registration is granted under the new
Law, its existing registration from the Prime Minister to carry on the business of selling interest in the
various trust funds (“Shintaku-Juekiken Hanbaigyo Touroku”) will be superseded and will automatically
expire. As such, Capital Advisers will not maintain their current registration alongside the new registration
under the new Law (when granted).
We also understand that Capital Advisers intends to renew the registration from the Governor of Tokyo
Prefecture to carry on the business of money lending, as well as the Housing and Property Dealer
Licence upon their expiry.
So far as our Directors are aware, no other consents, licences, registrations or the like are necessary or
required for Capital Advisers to carry on its business in accordance with its current scope and practice. In
any event, Capital Advisers is no longer our wholly-owned subsidiary and is only our associated
company.
Scope of our activities in Singapore 
We have one subsidiary in Singapore, Uni-Asia Capital (Singapore) Limited, whose principal businesses
are:
(i)
to provide loans to shipping clients, typically secured by vessel mortgages;
(ii)
to arrange ship chartering; and
(iii)
to provide project management.
Uni-Asia Capital (Singapore) Limited acts as administrator, registrar, fiscal agent and project manager to
Akebono Capital Limited, which is the issuer of the Performance Notes in relation to the Akebono Fund.
Akebono Capital Limited is a limited liability company, managed by its board of directors. It is the
responsibility of the board to originate and implement all transactions relevant to the fund, including
acquisitions and disposals of the underlying investments. Prior to implementing any such transaction, the
board will consult the monitoring committee that represents the parties who have invested in the
underlying notes. The board of Akebono Capital Limited prepares a report for the monitoring committee
which, having raised any queries, has the right to issue, or not issue, a “notice of awareness”. Should
such a notice be issued, Akebono Capital Limited may, but is not obliged to, proceed with the transaction.
If such a notice is not issued, Akebono Capital Limited would internally consider suitable modifications be
made to the proposal such that it might become acceptable to the investors.
GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP
108


The composition of the monitoring committee comprises four individuals, one of whom is our
representative (the other three being the representatives of other investors in the Akebono Fund),
meaning that the monitoring committee is not under our control. The monitoring committee for the
Akebono Fund acts on the basis of a simple majority of its monitoring committee members, except where
unanimous approval of all the representatives of the monitoring committee is required in relation to
certain cases such as the proposal by the issuer of the Performance Notes for any modification of any
provision of the administration and project management agreement or any arrangement in respect of the
obligations of the issuer thereunder.
In the case of a transaction with an affiliate of any sponsor of the Akebono Fund, namely Mitsui & Co.,
Ltd, Exeno Yamamizu and our Company, a valuation of the relevant asset from a professional valuer
(other than the sponsor) or from other persons (if approved by the representatives of the monitoring
committee (other than those nominated by the sponsor whose affiliate will be involved in the transaction))
shall be obtained, unless such requirement is waived by representatives of the monitoring committee
(other than those nominated by the Sponsor whose affiliate will be involved in the transaction).
With regard to the business of providing loans to shipping clients, Uni-Asia Capital (Singapore) Limited
has obtained a renewal of its Certificate of Exemption under Section 36 No. 1752 dated 4 November
2004, issued by the Government of Singapore pursuant to the Moneylenders Act, Chapter 188 of
Singapore (the “Moneylenders Act”).
Uni-Asia Capital (Singapore) Limited first obtained a Certificate of Exemption dated 14 January 2002 and
which was effective from 4 January 2002 and expiring on 3 January 2008. The Certificate of Exemption
provides an exemption to Uni-Asia Capital (Singapore) Limited from compliance with the provisions of the
Moneylenders Act in respect of loans granted to finance or re-finance the purchase of a vessel(s),
vessel’s engines, vessel’s parts and related equipment and components, for commercial or industrial
purposes and/or for working capital in connection with which the vessel is inter-alia granted as security
for the loan and/or generally in connection with ship finance. Uni-Asia Capital (Singapore) Limited did not
provide any loans in Singapore prior to obtaining the Certificate of Exemption.
So far as our Directors are aware, apart from the exemption referred to above, no other consents,
licences, registrations or the like are necessary or required for Uni-Asia Capital (Singapore) Limited to
carry on its business in accordance with its current scope and practice.
Scope of our activities in the PRC
We have one subsidiary in the PRC, Uni-Asia Guangzhou, involved in property investment and
management.
Uni-Asia Guangzhou has earlier obtained approval for the establishment of the company from the Bureau
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation of Tianhe District, Guangzhou Municipality and was duly
registered with the Administration for Industry and Commence of Guangzhou. Uni-Asia Guangzhou can
carry on the business of leasing, operating and management of its owned properties according to the
requirements under the business licence issued by the Administration for Industry and Commence of
Guangzhou (which will expire on 9 January 2037) and within the approved scope of business.
So far as our Directors are aware, no other consents, licences, registrations or the like are necessary or
required for Uni-Asia Guangzhou to carry on its business in accordance with its current scope and
practice.
SEASONALITY
There is no apparent seasonality observed within the industries in which we operate. However, we
experience some seasonality in the recognition of profits. We concentrate on marketing and sales
activities in the first half of each financial year and typically only complete our transactions and profits
from such transactions are only realised and recorded in the second half of the financial year.
GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP
109


COMPETITION
Our Directors believe that competition in our industry is intense and we have to compete with companies
that may have wider name recognition, more resources, a broader range of services including the ability
to provide debt directly, as well as arranging it, and a longer operating history than us.
Our Directors believe we face competition from the finance arrangement departments of commercial
banks and investment banks, funds that make direct investments into Alternative Assets and property
companies that make secondary acquisitions of property.
The market in Asia for finance arrangement and direct investments is very competitive and many financial
institutions operate in our key geographical markets of Hong Kong, the PRC, Japan and Singapore. Our
Directors do not believe any of our competitors have the exact same mix and focus of business as us,
however each of our competitors tends to compete with us on a particular type of activity, such as only in
finance arrangement or only in direct investment into ships, NPLs or property.
Our Directors believe that we are able to effectively compete with our competitors based on our focus on
our strengths (as stated in the section entitled “General Information on our Group – Competitive
Strengths” of this Prospectus) and by providing our customers with a level of service that meets or
exceeds their expectations, hence leading to repeat business from satisfied customers, as well as
referrals from them for new business opportunities.
Our Directors have identified the following competitors in each area of our business:

Competitors
Structured finance
Banks, financial advisory and consulting firms, hedge funds, leasing

COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS 
We believe that our key competitive strengths are as follows:
Experienced Executive Directors and Management Team
Our Executive Directors and management team are experienced professionals in the structured finance
industry and alternative asset investments. Our co-founders and Executive Directors, Messrs Motokuni
Yamashiro, Kazuhiko Yoshida and Michio Tanamoto co-founded Uni-Asia in 1997. A summary of their
work experience is set out below and further details may be found in the section entitled “Directors,
Management and Staff” in this Prospectus:

Mr. Motokuni Yamashiro is our Chairman and Executive Director. Mr. Yamashiro has over 40 years
of experience in the banking sector. Prior to founding our Company, he was with The Hokkaido


Mr. Kazuhiko Yoshida is our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director. He has over 27 years of
experience in banking and credit analysis, specialising in structured finance of maritime vessels


Mr. Michio Tanamoto is our Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director. Mr. Tanamoto has over
26 years of experience in banking based in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Prior to founding
Uni-Asia in 1997, he joined The Hokkaido Takushoku Bank in 1980 and was the senior manager of
Takugin International (Asia) Limited, the offshore merchant banking arm of The Hokkaido
Takushoku Bank between 1988 and 1993. Following which, he was the deputy general manager of
the Singapore Branch of The Hokkaido Takushoku Bank from 1995 to 1997.
We believe that we have a clear understanding of our industry requirement and possess a client-driven
focus and an established investment strategy. Our staff is committed to provide value-added and
innovative services to our clients. Our Executive Directors, Executive Officers and employees collectively
own approximately 19.7% of our post-Invitation issued share capital. We believe that this has helped align
their interests with those of our Company and foster a sense of commitment. In addition, we have in place
an employee share option scheme to motivate and foster a stronger sense of ownership amongst our
staff. Please refer to the section entitled “Uni-Asia Share Option Scheme” in this Prospectus for further
details of our Scheme.
We have a successful track record of integrated capabilities in our specialist fields
We have a strong background and experience in finance arrangement and investment in Alternative
Assets. Based on our track record, we have been able to successfully identify opportunities, formulate
structures and execute them effectively. By leveraging on this strength, we focus on activities where our
experience and established relationships provide a competitive advantage. Further details of selected key
transactions may be found in the section entitled “General Information on our Group – Business
Overview” in this Prospectus.
As transport-related finance arrangement and alternative asset investments are specialised fields, we
believe that we are able to achieve the following competitive advantages:

Comprehensive range of value-added and innovative structures
We offer a comprehensive range of services that helps our clients achieve their business and/or
financing objectives. We provide a range of customised structured finance products and services
such as the arrangement of ship and aircraft leases, mortgage financing, charter arrangements for
vessels, tax-enhanced leases and loans and balance sheet management. The availability of such a
broad and comprehensive product range enables us to offer our clients integrated and innovative
solutions. It also allows us to cater to any periodic change in requirements in any of our target
industries.

Scalable execution capabilities
Our business allows us to explore multiple opportunities based on common product requirements
across geographic markets. We are able to leverage on our existing competencies, resources and
network to execute our expansion initiatives into new sectors and across geographical locations.
We believe that we are one of the few industry participants who have in-house capabilities for both
structured finance and Alternative Assets investment. This combination has also allowed us to
develop long-term relationships with and meet the needs of our existing and new clients through
our comprehensive range of services.

Effective internal processes and practices
We have developed internal business processes and practices to enable us to function efficiently
and effectively in our dealings with clients and our approach to other relationships. We believe that
our intimate knowledge of global transport and Alternative Assets markets and trends provides us
with an advantage over our competitors in structuring and investments. We believe that this focus
has allowed us to structure customised solutions to our clients’ requirements. In addition, with our
“boutique” size and lean organisational structure, we are able to function with greater flexibility and
speed in comparison to some of our larger competitors.
GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP
111


We are able to leverage on our relationships with our well-established network
We have a well-established and strong network of contacts. The engagement of clients and provision of
services are carried out with the objective of creating and maintaining long-term relationships. In addition
to our client relationships, we have also been able to build other long-term business relationships through
our investments, partners, corporate shareholders and brokers. We have been able, and will continue, to
leverage on these relationships and network to support us in identifying new business opportunities and
in assisting us to formulate new and innovative structures to address the requirements of our business
associates. This has resulted in us obtaining repeat businesses from our existing clients as well as new
referrals from our existing network. The strengths and geographical spread of these relationships enable
us to provide cross-border services to our clients such as the recovery of PRC NPLs acquired from
Japanese banks and ship finance in Asia financed by European financial institutions.
EXCHANGE CONTROLS
Our operations are largely located in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and the PRC.
Hong Kong
Pursuant to Article 112 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s
Republic of China (Cap 2101), there are no foreign exchange control policies in Hong Kong. The Hong
Kong dollar is freely convertible. Profits, royalties, interest and capital can also be freely converted and
repatriated.
Japan
Foreign exchange matters are regulated by the Law on the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade (“FEFT
Law”), and cabinet orders and ministerial ordinances thereunder. Under the FEFT Law, capital
transactions as defined by the FEFT Law including investment from and to Japan as well as trans-border
payments may be freely conducted except for certain extraordinary cases such as transaction with certain
countries or for certain business where permit or notification for review prior to the transaction is required.
Neither our Company nor our Shares fall under such exception. Nevertheless, a report after the
transaction is normally required for a capital transaction exceeding Yen 100 million (or Yen 1 billion for
some transactions) and for a trans-border payment exceeding Yen 30 million except in case of settlement
of international trade. Also, notification prior to the transaction is required for physical import and export of
cash or negotiable instruments exceeding Yen 1 million or of gold exceeding 1 kilogramme.
Singapore
There are currently no exchange controls in Singapore.
PRC
In 1994, the PRC reformed the foreign exchange system, combined the RMB exchange rates, adopted
the bank exchange settlement system and set up a unified inter-bank foreign exchange market.
Since 1 December 1996, the PRC has introduced a new system of foreign exchange control under which
RMB is convertible on current accounts, but strict administrative measures are still in place for capital
account. Foreign exchange is not allowed to circulate or to be used in lieu in the settlement of accounts
except in free trade zones. Any organisation or individual with international balance of payment (including
overseas-invested businesses, foreign financial institutions and the resident PRC offices of foreign legal
persons except for those of international organisations and foreign embassies or consulates) should
declare for statistical purposes their international balances and go through the foreign exchange
settlement and sales procedure when collecting foreign exchange in export and paying foreign exchange
in import. The control over the confirmation of foreign exchange payment to banks in Mainland China and
the control over export tax refund are closely linked.

PROSPECTS 
Shipping
Shipping is a global industry which is generally influenced by demand and supply dynamics such as the
demand for movements of cargos, the resultant tonne-mile demand of vessels as well as the supply of
vessels tonnage capacity. Fuel cost, which typically makes up a significant portion of the operating cost of
ships, is also a factor affecting the performance of the shipping industry.
Shipping comprises different shipping sectors servicing different industries, governed under different
regulations and each having its own supply and demand dynamics. The major types of ships include dry
bulk ships, container vessels, product tankers and crude tankers. Dry bulk ships carry dry commodities
such as ore, coal, grains, fertiliser, bauxite, soy beans, cement, potash and salt. Container vessels carry
metal boxes containing cargoes such as cars and equipment. Product tankers carry mainly refined oil
products such as gasoline, diesel and other non-refrigerated cargos such as edible oils and chemicals.
Crude tankers carry crude oil and petroleum.
GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP
115


The dry bulk shipping trade is usually dependent on the demand for and price of commodities. Steel
production is a key driver of the dry bulk shipping trade through seabourne demand for coking coal and
iron ore. The container shipping trade is usually dependent on the global economic growth, trade growth,
industrial production and consumer consumption. The product and oil tanker industry is usually
dependent on global industrial production, refinery throughput, utilisation rate in refineries, global crude
oil inventory levels and the weather season.
We believe that the demand for maritime vessels will be driven largely by the continued growth in the
world economy and seaborne trade. Such demand will provide us with opportunities to leverage on our
track record and experience in structured finance and ship charter arrangements to establish new client
relationships and to offer our existing clients innovative and customised structured finance solutions as
well as ship charter arrangement services.
Structured finance focusing on the shipping industry is dominated mainly by financial institutions. We
believe that we are able to compete effectively with them by leveraging on our track record, our wide
network and our strong relationships with our business partners and customers, which include
established shipping banks and shipowners.
Whilst the shipping industry may be cyclical, we believe that our structured finance operations are not
significantly subject to such cycles as we believe that there continues to be opportunities for us to provide
structured financing solutions as ship renewal is an ongoing process. In a shipping down-cycle, we
generally observe the trend of older ships being scrapped and new ones being built given the lower cost
of new builds. In the shipping up-cycle, we generally observe that there will be an increase in demand for
ships as ship owners seek to increase their fleet to capitalise on the favourable freight rates. We believe
that there continues to be opportunities for us to provide structured finance solutions and ancillary ship
brokerage services at different stages of the shipping cycle. We further believe that the shipyards’ order
books in the coming years will continue to be sustained and thus present opportunities for us to provide
more structured finance solutions to shipowners and operators.
Alternative Assets Investment
The Alternative Assets investments class includes investments in ships, distressed assets and real
estate. Distressed assets typically include debt obligations such as junk bonds, corporate bonds,
commercial and industrial loans, credit card receivables and auto loans. Investors in distressed assets
purchase debt obligations of companies that are financially troubled and are struggling or are unable to
service their debt obligations and they earn a return through recovery of distressed debt, through
appreciation in the value of the distressed debt investment, or through leveraged buyouts.
Our investments in ships are usually made through equity interests in ship owning companies or through
Performance Notes held in ship investment funds. Our direct and indirect investments in the different
types of ships are made after careful consideration and due diligence and based on our Directors’ outlook
of the various shipping sectors. We believe that we can leverage on our expertise knowledge in the
shipping sector to tap on the opportunities to source for new ship investments and/or to buy or sell
maritime vessels.
Our investments in distressed assets are mainly made through NPLs and we are also seeking
opportunities in the distressed real estate market in Asia (excluding Japan). Such opportunities will be
dependent on factors such as the respective countries’ macroeconomic environment and policies,
performance in key industry sectors, access to capital and liquidity, competition and prevailing market
conditions. We believe that we will be able to leverage on our well-established network and familiarity with
the distressed asset markets in the region to identify and invest in suitable distressed assets.
GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP
116


The performance of Alternative Assets investments are dependent on the unique characteristics of each
type of alternative asset and the country of origin of these assets. These investments are therefore
relatively opportunistic in nature. We believe that such non-mainstream opportunities are available in Asia
and we intend to seek new ship investments, real estate investments and distressed asset investments in
Asia. We also believe that our experience in Alternative Assets investments, our capabilities in deal-
making, due diligence, valuation, structuring and financing, together with our well-established network of
contacts in Asia will enable us to effectively identify and evaluate opportunities for cross-border
investments in these assets.
ORDER BOOK
Due to the nature of our business, we do not maintain an order book. Our revenue stream includes
revenue from fee income, investment returns, and other income. Based on our mandates secured as at
the Latest Practicable Date, we expect to recognise fee income including arrangement, agency and
charter brokerage fees and administration fees, of approximately US$10.5 million in FY2007. We will
continue to receive administration fees from the fleet of vessels held under the funds administered by us.
We also expect to receive fee income as well as investment returns in respect of new investment funds
including the Akebono Fund referred to in the section entitled “General Information on our Group –
Business Strategy and Future Plans” below.
BUSINESS STRATEGY AND FUTURE PLANS
We aim to be a leading Asia-based structured finance arrangement and Alternative Assets direct
investment firm. Our primary business strategy is to build on our existing strengths in structured finance
and Alternative Assets investments to provide one-stop and innovative financing solutions to our clients
as well as to explore and develop Alternative Assets investment opportunities by leveraging on our
expertise and relationships.
We intend to continue to look for new market opportunities by leveraging on our core capabilities within
our specialist fields. Globalisation and economic growth also offer us opportunities in terms of cross-
border financing and investments and allow us to build a wider presence and network within the region.
The principal elements of our strategy for growth and expansion of our business are described below.
Continue to focus and leverage on our integrated capabilities and well-established relationships
We intend to continue to focus on our specialist fields in structured finance arrangements and Alternative
Assets investments and to build on our well-established relationships with clients.
We aim to build on our well-established relationships with our structured finance clients by offering
customised products to meet their specific requirements. We are sensitive to our clients’ needs and we
believe that such client-driven product customisation strategy applied through our comprehensive range
of innovative financial products and services will strengthen our future growth.
We also intend to focus on investments in Alternative Assets through our various credit and risk
assessments, sound management, industry and geographical diversification as well as strong internal
processes and practices. While our associated company, Capital Advisers, will continue to play an integral
role in our property investment in Japan, we also plan to look for opportunities in property investment in
other parts of Asia.
Structured Finance: Expand and diversify our client portfolio and broaden our geographic
coverage within Asia
We have been growing our revenues since our establishment in 1997. We believe that a key factor to this
growth has been the introduction of new and innovative financial products to our clients. We are focused
on the acquisition of new clients as well as developing existing client relationships. We believe that there
are opportunities in the area of structured finance arrangement, particularly in the shipping sector. We
intend to concentrate on building new relationships with regional shipping companies by offering tax-

driven leasing and bareboat and time charter opportunities tailor-made specifically to clients’
requirements and investment appetite. In such transactions, our Company will act as finance arranger
and will not participate as a lender. Through our role as finance arranger, we intend to secure up-front
fees via structured finance arrangements and to receive brokerage commission through the arrangements
of charter including bareboat and time charters.
Alternative Assets Investment: Expand and diversify our investment portfolio and broaden our
geographic coverage within Asia
We intend to continue to search for suitable Alternative Assets investments that will meet our stringent
criteria to expand and diversify our Alternative Assets investment portfolio. At the same time, we are
continuously working on recovering our NPL portfolio to maximise our returns on our investments. We
intend to leverage on our expertise and network in distressed asset investments in the Asian region to
further explore and develop investment opportunities in other parts of Asia such as the PRC and
Thailand. We will continue to identify investment opportunities and intend to utilise our capital to directly
invest in distressed assets and/or real estate assets in the PRC and other parts of Asia.
For example, we intend to invest directly into new sectors such as distressed real estate in Asia
(excluding Japan), hotels and residential and other commercial properties to make use of our synergy
and the capabilities of Capital Advisers and our Alternative Assets investment.
New ship investment funds
As part of our principal business to invest in shipping assets either directly or through specialised fund
vehicles, we directly invested in three container vessels in 2005.
We intend to continue to seek opportunities to invest in and/or launch new joint ventures in ship
investments. As such, we have on 17 April 2007 launched a new fund in Singapore, the Akebono Fund,
to take advantage of the Maritime Port Authority’s Maritime Finance Incentive Scheme. The Akebono
Fund, which will have an initial size of approximately US$300 million, has acquired a product tanker and a
bulk carrier and will invest in container vessels and another product tanker. Our committed investment
portion in this fund is US$15.0 million, which payment obligation will crystallise upon the acquisition of the
vessels by the fund. On 13 September 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Uni-Asia Capital (Singapore)
Limited, was designated as an ASIM under the Singapore Income Tax Act by the MPA. At the same time,
the MPA also granted a designation of ASIE for the Akebono Fund.
Our ASIM designation is for an initial period of 10 years commencing on the subscription date of the
Akebono Fund by investors, subject to a review by MPA at the end of the fifth year. Pursuant to our ASIM
designation, we are eligible for a concessionary tax rate of 10% for income derived from managing an
ASIE, such as the Akebono Fund.
The ASIE designation for the Akebono Fund is for an initial period of up to 10 years commencing from
the date of its establishment, subject to a review by MPA at the end of the fifth year. Pursuant to its ASIE
designation, the Akebono Fund is eligible for tax exemption on income derived from the chartering or
finance leasing of (a) any sea-going ship to (i) a person who is neither resident in nor a permanent
establishment in Singapore; (ii) an approved international shipping enterprise; or (b) any sea-going
Singapore ship to persons described in (a)(i) and (a)(ii) above or a shipping enterprise within the meaning
of Section 13A of the SITA. The tax exemption will be valid for the life of vessels acquired by ASIE during
the incentive period of up to 10 years. For instance, if an ASIE acquires a vessel during the 10-year
incentive period, charters it for 20 years and disposes of it thereafter, lease income on the charter will
enjoy tax exemption for the entire 20 years. The qualifying income of the Akebono Fund shall also
include hedging gains derived in connection with the management of its portfolio of vessels, and share of
profits or dividends remittances from shipholding special purpose vehicles owned by the Akebono Fund
that are declared out of qualifying activities.
In addition to the launch of the Akebono Fund and our investment in Rich Containership, we also intend
to directly invest in one additional container vessel, due for delivery in 2008.
Please refer to the section entitled “Use of Proceeds” in this Prospectus for further details.

MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE 
The Management Committee has the responsibility to maintain oversight of our Group’s business as a
whole. Its authority includes each division’s business targets, budgets, new clients/transactions and
human resources related policies.
The Management Committee oversees and monitors the activities of the Structured Finance, Distressed
Assets Investment and Ship Investment departments and meets regularly once each month or when
needed. Members of the Management Committee include Mr. Yamashiro, Mr. Yoshida and Mr. Tanamoto.
Mr. Yoshida is the Chairman of the Management Committee and is responsible for the Distressed
Assets/Properties Investment Department and Mr. Tanamoto is responsible for the Structured Finance
and Asset Finance (Ship Investment) Departments. Each Executive Director is responsible for the
execution of the relevant department’s budget, strategy and internal organisation, such as headcount
remuneration, staff reporting lines, business targets and departmental procedures.
The Management Committee has the authority to approve transactions with a net value of up to 10% of
our Group’s net worth at the last audited balance sheet date, except for loans to or investment in Capital
Advisers, where the authority to approve relates to transactions of up to a total value of US$12 million.
Any transaction exceeding the Management Committee’s authority of approval would be subject to Board
approval.
Proposed finance arrangement transactions are screened by the Management Committee, based on
factors such as potential return, risks, market conditions and testing the assumptions which underlie the
proposed transaction. Approval is granted to deals that have a reasonable likelihood of success and meet
our Group’s risk/return criteria.


Internal Investment Approval Process
Each department is expected to seek internal approval before making an investment. Proposed
investments need to go through a three-stage approval process depicted in the chart above.
In the first stage a report would need to be prepared for approval and review by the Review Committee
comprising the Management Committee and various department heads. The Chairman of the Review
Committee and Management Committee will give approval or authorisation for the project team to
proceed with the next stage of application. In the second stage, a detailed report and analysis would be
prepared to be reviewed and approved by the Review Committee. Should the project meet our Group’s
investment criteria, the Chairman will recommend the investment for final approval. In the final stage, a
detailed final report is submitted to Management Committee for their final approval. The Management
Committee will give the final approval for any investment project.
Transactions are monitored on a continuous basis. A key person from the project team will be designated
to monitor each investment. The Management Committee maintains oversight through direct contact with
executives, a monthly status report from each department of its activities and latest results and a monthly
and six-monthly budget from each department.
Risk management policy
Our Group’s principal risks are market risk, credit risk and foreign exchange risk. The following sets out a
description of our Group’s risk management policy:
(i) 
Market risk and credit risk
Our Group seeks to minimise these risks by performing detailed reviews of loan counterparties or asset
issuers prior to purchase approval, and by either selling on participated loans to other parties or entering
into offsetting loans payable when Directors wish to preserve our Group’s liquidity. Our Group seeks to
minimise adverse movements in market price of financial instruments by extensive due diligence
procedures to ensure acquisition at prices below their perceived fair value.

(ii) 
Foreign exchange and interest rate risk
Our Directors review the currency exposures and enter into foreign currency forward contracts when
considered necessary to hedge against adverse currency movements. Our Group uses the following
derivative instruments for both hedging purposes: Forward rate agreements are individually negotiated
interest rate futures that call for a cash settlement at a future date for the difference between a contracted
rate of interest and the current market rate, based on a notional principal amount.
Currency and interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange one set of cashflows for another. Swaps
result in an economic exchange of currencies or interest rates (for example, fixed rate for floating rate) or
a combination of all these (i.e. cross-currency interest rate swaps). No exchange of principal takes place,
except for certain currency swaps. Our Group’s credit risk represents the potential cost to replace the
swap contracts if counterparties fail to perform their obligation. This risk is monitored on an ongoing basis
with reference to the current fair value, a proportion of the notional amount of the contracts and the
liquidity of the market. To control the level of credit risk taken, our Group assesses counterparties using
the same techniques as for its lending activities.
(iii)
Liquidity risk
Our Group will maintain sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an
adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Our risk management policy with respect to market and credit risks in loans, ship investments and other
matters related to the shipping industry, is administered by our relevant/respective departments, who
report to the Management Committee on a monthly basis. In this regard, our asset finance department
will be responsible for market and credit risks in loans and ship investments, and our structured finance
department will be responsible to monitor the credit worthiness of our shipping clients for finance
arrangement. Our risk management policy with respect to foreign exchange, interest rate and liquidity
risks, is administered by our overall finance department, who reports to the Management Committee on a
monthly basis. Our risk management policy with respect to our direct investments in distressed assets
and property is administered by our distressed assets/investment department, who is responsible to
monitor, among other things, the risks and issues relating to our distressed assets investments and the
economic and market conditions of the property market in the areas in which we have invested in or are
considering to invest in. The distressed assets/investment department reports to the Management
Committee on a monthly basis.

to a maximum contribution of HK$1,000. Such contribution is not required for staff with a monthly relevant
income of less than HK$4,000. In addition to the mandatory contributions, we make a voluntary
contribution to top up the total contributions to a maximum of 10% of our staff’s monthly relevant income
to the MPF scheme, depending on seniority of our staff.
Our staff in Hong Kong are required to contribute 5% of their monthly relevant income or HK$1,000 to the
scheme, whichever is lower and they may make additional voluntary contributions to the MPF scheme in
any amount.
For staff joining before 1 July 1997, contributions from us and the staff are 100% vested in the staff as
soon as they are paid to the MPF schemes but all benefits derived from the mandatory contributions
must be preserved until the staff reach the retirement age of 65 (subject to exceptions such as early
retirement between the ages of 60 to 64, death, total incapacity and permanent departure from Hong
Kong). For staff joining after 1 July 1997, the employer’s contribution under the MPF scheme will be
vested in the staff according to a vesting schedule. Our contributions to the MPF schemes can be used to
offset any long service payments or severance payments payable and it is deductible against profits tax.
Singapore 
Under the CPF scheme, we and our staff in Singapore have to contribute a total amount equal to 33% of
the total ordinary wages of local staff (below the age of 50) to the CPF scheme, subject to a maximum
level of monthly relevant income of S$4,500 for the current year. Ordinary wage refers to monthly salary,
overtime, monthly allowances etc.
CPF deduction is also applicable on the bonus portion of staff’s income, known as the Additional wage.
The Additional wage subject to CPF deduction is the difference between S$76,500 and the total ordinary
wages subject to CPF contributions for the current year. This total amount (i.e. S$76,500) is currently
pegged at a level equivalent to 17 times the maximum level of monthly income which is subject to CPF
deduction.
Both the employer and its foreign employees are not required to contribute to the CPF scheme in respect
of a foreign staff hired on an employment pass, work permit or professional visit pass.
The employer and its foreign employees are required to contribute to the CPF scheme in respect of
foreign employees who are Singapore permanent residents. The mandatory CPF contribution in respect
of Singapore permanent residents are at reduced rates of 9% in the first year following the time
permanent resident status is granted to the foreign staff (4% from the employer and 5% from the


employee), 24% in the second year (9% from the employer and 15% from the employee), and thereafter
at the full rate. The employer and employee may however, jointly apply to the CPF for either the employer
or both the employer and employee to contribute to the CPF scheme at the full rate prescribed for
Singapore citizens. Such application, once approved, is irrevocable, unless the contract of employment is
terminated. The levels of contribution to the CPF by us and the aforementioned employees and our Group
all assume that the employee’s salary is above S$750. Reduced contributions are applicable for salaries
below this amount.
The maximum level of monthly income subject to CPF deductions for 2006 is S$4,500.
For staff below the age of 50, the total CPF contribution rate of 33% for year 2006 is made up of 20%
from the staff and 13% from our Group.
For staff between the age of 50 to 55, the current total CPF contribution rate is 27% (18% from staff and
9% from our Group) in 2006.
Contributions from us and the staff are 100% vested in the staff as soon as they are paid into the CPF
schemes but all benefits derived from the mandatory contributions will be retained in each respective
staff’s account (subject to deduction for any amount that has been utilised under the approved withdrawal
scheme for purchase of housing accommodation, etc.) until the staff reaches the retirement age of 62 or
earlier.
Contributions paid by the staff and us (i.e. 20% and 13%) are expenses deductible against staff income
for personal income tax and profits for company corporate tax.
Japan 
We provide our employees with the health, pension insurance, workmen’s accident compensation and
unemployment insurance schemes.
Employees who are permanent staff are covered by a health insurance scheme. We and our employees
share equally in the cost of the premium. The cost of the premium is paid monthly and the general
premium rate was 8.2% of the respective salaries for each employee of the age of 40 or less and 9.45%
for employees of over 40 years in age. Under the scheme, 70% of medical costs is covered including
high-cost medical benefits, transportation expenses, disability benefits, lump-sum allowance for childcare
and nursing, maternity allowance and funeral expenses.
Ordinary employees participate in the employees’ pension plan. Both the employer and the employee
bear the insurance premium payment equally. We deduct the insurance premium from the employee’s
monthly salary. The premium rate was 13.934%.
The workmen’s Accident Compensation Insurance covers the expenses to compensate an employee for
injuries or diseases sustained or incurred during work or commuting to work. The insurance premium is
paid by us. The premium was 0.5%. Benefits from this insurance cover includes the expenses of medical
treatment, absence from work for four days or more, compensation for any irrecoverable physical
functional impediment or disability, compensation for the bereaved family in the case of an employee
passing away and funeral costs of an employee who has passed away.
Unemployment Insurance provides benefits to employees if they are made redundant. The premium is
shared between us and our employee 1.05% and 0.7% respectively. The insurance premium is deducted
from the employee’s monthly salary. This insurance provides benefits to job-seeking people who left
usand have the will and the ability to work. To receive such benefits, the job-seeking person must have
worked for the same employer as an insured employee for six months or longer and that person must
have worked for at least 14 days or longer during the past one year period prior to the date of
unemployment.

PRC
Under PRC laws and regulations, a PRC-incorporated company must contribute to social welfare plans
(including retirement insurance, unemployment insurance, medical insurance, and workmen’s accident
compensation insurance) for each of its employees.
As at the Latest Practicable Date, we do not have any direct employees in the PRC and therefore do not
contribute to the social welfare plans under PRC laws and regulations. In the event that we have any
employees in the PRC in the future, we will comply with such PRC laws and regulations as may be
necessary.

SERVICE AGREEMENTS
Particulars of Directors’ service contracts 
Executive Directors
Mr. Motokuni Yamashiro has entered into a service agreement with our Company pursuant to which he
has agreed to act as an Executive Director for an initial term of one year with effect from 7 August 2007.
Each of  Mr. Kazuhiko Yoshida and Mr. Michio Tanamoto has entered into a service agreement with our
Company pursuant to which each has agreed to act as an Executive Director for an initial term of three
years with effect from 7 August 2007. The term of service shall be renewed and extended automatically
on the expiry of such initial term for an indefinite term, unless and until either party has given at least six
months’ written notice of termination or unless the employment is summarily terminated upon any breach
by the employee.
Separately from the above, Mr. Motokuni Yamashiro, Mr. Kazuhiko Yoshida and Mr. Michio Tanamoto have
each given an undertaking to our Company as follows:

Mr. Yamashiro has undertaken that he will not resign as an Executive Director of our Company and
he will not exercise any right to terminate any service agreement that he may enter into with our
Company within the period of one year commencing from the date of listing of our Company on the
SGX-ST, and after such one-year period, within a period of one year commencing from the date of
resignation of any other Executive Director, save that the foregoing undertaking shall terminate in
the event that a take-over offer has been made in accordance with the Singapore Code on Take-
overs and Mergers or any other applicable law or regulation (including Cayman Islands law) by a
person (whether individually or together with parties acting in concert with him) and subsequent to
such take-over offer, more than 50% of the issued share capital of our Company is acquired or
otherwise controlled by that person (whether individually or together with parties acting in concert
with him); and

each of Mr. Yoshida and Mr. Tanamoto has undertaken that he will not resign as an Executive
Director of our Company and he will not exercise any right to terminate any service agreement that
he may enter into with our Company within the period of three years commencing from the date of
listing of our Company on the SGX-ST, and after such three-year period, within a period of one
year commencing from the date of resignation of any other Executive Director, save that the
foregoing undertaking shall terminate in the event that a take-over offer has been made in
accordance with the Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers or any other applicable law or
regulation (including Cayman Islands law) by a person (whether individually or together with parties
acting in concert with him) and subsequent to such take-over offer, more than 50% of the issued
share capital of our Company is acquired or otherwise controlled by that person (whether
individually or together with parties acting in concert with him).
Each of these Executive Directors is entitled to the respective basic salary and housing allowance set out
below (after the first year of appointment, annual reviews of the housing allowance shall be made and
decided at the discretion of our Directors payable monthly in arrears). In addition, each of the Executive
Directors is also entitled to a discretionary performance bonus to be determined in the following manner:
Consolidated Profit Before Tax (“CPBT”)
Performance Bonus, as a percentage of CPBT
Less than US$8.0 million
–
US$8.0 million or more but not more than 
7.50%
US$12.0 million
More than US$12.0 million
The aggregate of (i) 7.50% of the first US$12.0 million 
and (ii) 10.0% of the remaining amount of CPBT
Consolidated Profit Before Tax means, in respect of a financial year of our Company, the audited
consolidated profit before tax of our Company, our subsidiaries and our associated companies and before
payment of the respective performance bonus to the Executive Directors for that financial year, but
excluding any extraordinary profit. The performance bonus will be payable in respect of the financial year
ended 31 December 2007 and in respect of each financial year thereafter.
DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT AND STAFF
130


An Executive Director may not vote on any resolution of the Directors regarding the amount of
remuneration (including housing allowance and bonuses payable to him). The current basic annual
salaries and housing allowance of our Executive Directors are as follows:
Name
Annual Salary
Housing Allowance
(US$)
(US$)
Mr. Motokuni Yamashiro
180,000
111,075
Mr. Kazuhiko Yoshida
180,000
104,412 
Mr. Michio Tanamoto
180,000
79,245
Our Executive Directors’ salaries are paid net of any tax payable by the relevant Director in respect of any
remuneration payable to the Director under the Service Agreements with our Company.
Under the Service Agreement, each of the Executive Directors has agreed that during the course of his
employment with our Company, he will not engage in the conduct of any other business and will not use,
divulge or communicate to any person any trade secrets or other confidential information of our Company.
In addition, each Executive Director has agreed that he will not, for 12 months after the termination of his
employment under his respective Service Agreement: (i) carry on for his own account any business
carried on by our Company, subsidiaries and associates within Hong Kong and Singapore; (ii) assist, with
technical advice, any party engaged in the business of our Company, subsidiaries and associates within
Hong Kong and Singapore; (iii) solicit any party who at any time during the last 12 months of his
employment with our Company was a customer of our Company or any of our subsidiaries; and (iv) offer
employment by himself or solicit or arrange for employment by any other person of any of the employees
of our Company or any of our subsidiaries.
We may terminate the Service Agreement by giving not less than six months’ notice to any Executive
Director. Following such termination, we shall pay to such Executive Director an amount of up to 70% of
his basic salary per month for 12 months following the date on which the Service Agreement has been
terminated by us, provided that the Service Agreement is not terminated due to any breach committed by
such Executive Director, and we have not waived the non-competition provisions described above.
Our Company believes that such termination fees are fair and reasonable in view of the specialised
nature of our Company’s business, together with the fact that the Executive Directors are subject to non-
competition obligations (as described above) for a period of 12 months following the termination of their
employment under their respective Service Agreements. Given that the Executive Directors are precluded
from seeking alternative employment during such 12-month restriction period, our Company believes that
it is only fair and reasonable that the Executive Directors are compensated for agreeing to such
restrictions. In the event that the amount of termination fees payable is lower than 5% of the NTA of our
Company (based on the most recent audited financial statements of our Company at the time of the
payment of the termination fees), the payment of such termination fees shall be subject to the approval of
our Audit Committee. In the event that the amount of termination fees payable is equal to or exceeds 5%
of the NTA of our Company (based on the most recent audited financial statements of our Company at
the time of the payment of the termination fees), the payment of such termination fees shall be subject to
the requirements of Chapter 9 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual in relation to interested person transactions,
as the same may be amended or modified from time to time.
Save as disclosed in the section entitled “Service Agreements – Particulars of Directors’ Service
Contracts”, none of our Directors has or is proposed to have a service contract with us other than
contracts expiring or determinable by the employer within one year without the payment of compensation
(other than statutory compensation).
Save for the above, there are no other existing or proposed service agreements entered into or to be
entered into by our Directors or Executive Officers.
Had the Service Agreements been in existence for FY2006, the aggregate remuneration paid to the
Executive Directors in FY2006 would have been approximately US$2.42 million instead of US$2.43
million and the Profit Before Tax of our Group for FY2006 would have been US$11.84 million instead of
US$11.83 million.
DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT AND STAFF

BOARD PRACTICE
Our Articles provide that our Board of Directors shall consist of between one and nine Directors. Save as
disclosed in the section entitled “Service Agreements – Particulars of Directors’ Service Contracts”, our
Directors do not have fixed terms of office. At each annual general meeting, one-third of the Directors for
the time being shall retire from office by rotation, provided that no Director holding office as Executive
Director whose term of office under a service contract with the Company is a fixed term that is unexpired
and continuing as at the time of the relevant annual general meeting, shall be subject to retirement by
rotation or be taken into account in determining the number of Directors to retire. The Directors to retire in
every year shall be those who have been longest in office since their last re-election or appointment. A
retiring Director shall be eligible for re-election.


UNI-ASIA SHARE OPTION SCHEME
134
On 26 June 2007, our Shareholders approved a share option scheme known as the Uni-Asia Share
Option Scheme, the rules of which are set out in Appendix F of this Prospectus. The Scheme complies
with the relevant rules of Chapter 8 of the Listing Manual. The Scheme will provide eligible participants
with an opportunity to participate in the equity of our Company as well as to motivate them to perform
better through increased loyalty and dedication to our Company. The Scheme, which forms an integral
and important component of a remuneration and compensation plan, is designed to primarily reward and
retain Executive Directors and employees whose services are crucial to our Group’s well being,
development and success.
As at the Latest Practicable Date, no Options (as defined in Rule 2 of the Scheme) have been granted
under the Scheme.
A summary of the Rules of the Scheme is set out as follows:
1.
Objectives
The objectives of the Scheme are as follows:
(a)
to motivate each participant to optimise his performance standards and efficiency and to
maintain a high level of contribution to our Group;
(b)
to retain key employees and Directors whose contributions are essential to the long-term
growth and profitability of our Group;
(c)
to instil loyalty to, and a stronger identification by the participants with the long-term
prosperity of, our Group;
(d)
to attract potential employees with relevant skills to contribute to our Group and to create
value for our Shareholders; and
(e)
to align the interests of the participants with the interests of our Shareholders.
2.
Participants
Under the rules of the Scheme, Executive, Non-Executive and Independent Directors and full-time
employees of our Group are eligible to participate in the Scheme. Directors who are Controlling
Shareholders of our Company and their Associates are not eligible to participate in the Scheme.
To be eligible to participate in the Scheme, a participant (“Participant”) must:
(i)
be confirmed in his/her employment with our Company or our Subsidiaries and not be on
probation and have been in the full-time service of our Company or any of our Subsidiaries
for at least 12 months on or prior to the date of the grant of the Option (the “Date of Grant”);
(ii)
have attained the age of 21 years on or before the Date of Grant; and
(iii)
not be an undischarged bankrupt and must not have entered into a composition with his
creditors.
3.
Scheme administration
The Scheme shall be administered by a committee comprising Directors (including Directors who
may be participants of the Scheme) (“Committee”), with powers to determine, inter alia, the
following:
(a)
persons to be granted Options;
(b)
number of Options to be offered; and
(c)
recommendations for modifications to the Scheme.


UNI-ASIA SHARE OPTION SCHEME
135
The Committee comprises members of the Remuneration Committee. A member of the Committee
who is also a Participant of the Scheme must not be involved in its deliberation in respect of
Options granted or to be granted to him.
4.
Size of the Scheme
The nominal amount of the aggregate number of Shares over which the Committee may grant
Options on any date, when aggregated with the nominal amount of the number of Shares issued
and issuable in respect all Options granted under the Scheme and any other share option schemes
of our Company, shall not exceed 15 per cent. of the issued share capital of our Company on the
day preceding the date of the relevant grant.
Our Company believes that this 15 per cent. limit set by the SGX-ST gives our Company sufficient
flexibility to decide upon the number of Option Shares to offer to our existing and new employees.
15 per cent. of our post-Invitation issued share capital constitutes approximately 36,060,000
Shares. As it is intended that the Scheme shall last for 10 years, assuming that there is no change
in the total issued share capital of our Company, the number of Option Shares in respect of which
Options may be granted in a year will average approximately 3,606,000. The number of eligible
participants is expected to grow over the years. Our Company, in line with its goals of ensuring
sustainable growth, is constantly reviewing our position and considering the expansion of our talent
pool which may involve employing new employees. The employee base, and therefore the number
of eligible participants will increase as a consequence. If the number of Options available under the
Scheme is limited, we may only be able to grant a small number of Options to each eligible
participant which may not be a sufficiently attractive incentive. Our Company is of the opinion that it
should have sufficient number of Options to offer to new employees as well as to existing
employees. The number of Options offered must also be significant enough to constitute a
meaningful reward for contribution to our Group. However, this does not mean that the Committee
will issue Option Shares up to the prescribed limit. The Committee shall exercise its discretion in
deciding the number of Option Shares to be granted to each employee, which will depend on, inter
alia, the employee’s performance and value to our Group.
5.
Entitlement
Subject to such adjustments as may be made under the Rules, the number of Options to be
offered to a Participant of the Scheme shall be determined at the absolute discretion of the
Committee, who shall take into account criteria such as the rank, performance, years of service
and potential for future development of that Participant.
6.
Participants in other schemes
Participants who participate in the Scheme are eligible to participate in other schemes
implemented by other companies, if approved by the Committee.
7.
Grant of Options
Subject to the Rules, the Committee may make offers of grant of Options (“Offers”) to such eligible
Participants as it may in its sole and absolute discretion select at any time during the period when
the Scheme is in force, except that no Offers shall be made during the period of 30 days
immediately preceding the date our Company announces its interim and/or final results (whichever
the case may be). In the event of our Company announcing any matter of an exceptional nature
involving unpublished price sensitive information (“Exceptional Announcements”), Offers may
only be made on or after the third Market Day on which such Exceptional Announcement is
released.


8.
Acceptance of Offer
The Offer to a Participant, if not accepted by the Participant before 5.00 p.m. on the 30th day from
the date of such Offer, will lapse. Upon acceptance of the Offer, the Participant to whom the Option
is granted will pay to our Company a consideration of US$1.00 or such other amount and deliver
such other documentation as the Committee may require.
9.
Exercise price and exercise period
Subject to any adjustment to be made pursuant to the Rules, the exercise price for each Share in
respect of which an Option is exercisable shall be determined by the Committee at its absolute
discretion and fixed by the Committee at:
(a)
a price equal to the average of the last dealt prices for a Share on the SGX-ST for the period
of three consecutive Market Days immediately prior to the relevant Date of Grant (“Market
Price”) but in no event shall the exercise price per Share be less than its par value (“Market
Price Options”); or
(b)
a price which is set at a discount to the Market Price, provided that the maximum discount
shall not exceed 20 per cent. of the Market Price but in no event shall the exercise price per
Share be less than its par value (“Incentive Options”).
Each eligible Participant who has been granted Market Price Options shall be entitled to exercise
at any time after the first anniversary of the Date of Grant of that Option, Provided always that the
Options granted to employees shall be exercised before the tenth anniversary of the relevant Date
of Grant and Options granted to Non-Executive Directors and Independent Directors shall be
exercised before the fifth anniversary of the relevant Date of Grant, or such earlier date as may be
determined by the Committee, failing which all unexercised Options shall immediately lapse and
become null and void and a Participant shall have no claims against our Company.
Each eligible Participant who has been granted Incentive Options shall be entitled to exercise at
any time after the second anniversary of the Date of Grant of that Option, Provided always that the
Options granted to employees shall be exercised before the tenth anniversary of the relevant Date
of Grant and Options granted to Non-Executive Directors and Independent Directors shall be
exercised before the fifth anniversary of the relevant Date of Grant, or such earlier date as may be
determined by the Committee, failing which all unexercised Options shall immediately lapse and
become null and void and a Participant shall have no claims against our Company.
10.
Variation of share capital
If a variation in our issued share capital occurs (whether by way of capitalisation or rights issue,
reduction of capital, sub-division or consolidation of Shares or distribution), the exercise price, the
nominal value, class and/or number of Shares comprised in an Option or over which Options may
be granted will be adjusted in such manner as the Committee may determine to be appropriate
and upon the written confirmation of our auditors (acting only as experts and not as arbitrators) that
in their opinion, such adjustment is fair and reasonable. The issue of Shares as consideration for
an acquisition by us or a private placement of Shares will not be regarded as a circumstance
requiring adjustment. An increase in the number of issued Shares as a consequence of the
exercise of Options or other convertibles issued by us will also not be a circumstance requiring
adjustment.
11.
Exercise of Options
Options which are accepted by the Participants may be exercised during the periods and at the
relevant exercise prices. All Options must be exercised before the expiry of 10 years from the Date
of Grant in the case of employees and before the expiry of five years in the case of Non-Executive
Directors and Independent Directors, or such earlier date as may be determined by the Committee,
failing which the Options shall be deemed to have expired and shall cease to be valid.
UNI-ASIA SHARE OPTION SCHEME
136


Special provisions dealing with the lapsing or permitting the earlier exercise of Options under
certain circumstances include:
(a)
the termination of the Participant’s employment or appointment in our Group, as the case
may be;
(b)
the bankruptcy of the Participant;
(c)
the death of the Participant;
(d)
a take-over of our Company; and
(e)
the winding-up of our Company (voluntary or otherwise).

Shares arising from the exercise of the Options shall be subject to the provisions of the
Memorandum of Association and Articles of our Company. The Shares so allotted will upon issue
rank pari passu in all respects with the then existing issued Shares for any dividends, rights,
allotments or distributions the record date (“Record Date”) of which falls after the relevant date of
exercise of the Option. “Record Date” means the date fixed by our Company for the purposes of
determining entitlements of Shareholders to dividends, rights, allotments or other distributions.
13.
Changes in the Scheme
Subject to the prior approval of the SGX-ST or any other stock exchange on which the Shares are
listed or quoted and other regulatory authorities as may be necessary, the Scheme may be altered
from time to time by a resolution of the Committee. However, no alteration shall be made which
would adversely affect the rights attached to Options granted prior to such alteration except with
the prior consent in writing of such number of Participants who, if they exercised their Options in
full, would thereby become entitled to not less than ¾ in nominal amount of all Shares which would
be allotted and issued upon exercise in full of all outstanding Options. Also, no alteration shall be
made to certain rules of the Scheme to the advantage of Participants except with the prior approval
of our Shareholders in general meeting.
14.
Duration of the scheme
The Scheme shall continue in operation for a maximum period of ten years commencing on the
Adoption Date. “Adoption Date” means the date upon which the Scheme is adopted by our
Shareholders which is 26 June 2007. The Scheme may be continued for any further period
thereafter with the approval of our Shareholders in general meeting and of any relevant authorities
which may then be required.
Grant of Options at Discounted Exercise Price
The Scheme which forms an integral component of our remuneration and compensation plan, is designed
to reward and retain eligible Participants whose services are crucial to our well-being and success. The
ability to grant Options with exercise prices set at a discount to the prevailing Market Prices of our
Shares, is intended, inter alia, to operate as a means to recognise Participants for their outstanding
performance as well as to motivate them to continue to excel while encouraging them to focus more on
improving our profitability and return above a certain level which will benefit all Shareholders when these
are eventually reflected through share price appreciation. The flexibility in determining the quantum of
discount would enable the Committee to tailor the incentives in the grant of Options to commensurate
with the performance and contribution of each individual Participant.
The flexibility of granting Options with discounted prices is also intended to cater for situations where the
market conditions are bullish and the market price of our Shares are traded at high premiums. In such
events, we may grant Options to our employees at a discount to the Market Price.
UNI-ASIA SHARE OPTION SCHEME
137


UNI-ASIA SHARE OPTION SCHEME
138
In deciding whether to give a discount and the quantum of such discount, the Committee shall be at
liberty to take into consideration factors including performance of our Company, the years of service and
individual performance of the Participant concerned, the contribution of the Participant to our success and
development, and the prevailing market conditions. All Participants, regardless of their rank, shall be
eligible to a discount of up to 20 per cent.
It is envisaged that we may consider granting the Options with Exercise Prices set at a discount to the
Market Price of our Shares prevailing at the time of grant under circumstances including (but not limited
to) to the following:
(a)
where, due to speculative forces in the stock market resulting in an overrun of the market, the
market price of our Shares at the time of the grant of Options is not a true reflection of our financial
performance;
(b)
to enable us to offer competitive remuneration packages in the event that the practice of granting
Options with exercise prices that have a discount element becomes a general market norm. As
share options become more significant components of executive remuneration packages, a
discretion to grant Options with discounted prices will provide us with a means to maintain the
competitiveness of our remuneration and compensation strategy; and/or
(c)
where we need to provide more compelling motivation for specific business units to improve their
performance, grants of share options with discounted exercise prices will help to align the interests
of employees to those of our Shareholders by encouraging them to focus more on improving our
profitability and returns above a certain level which will benefit all Shareholders when these are
eventually reflected through share price appreciation. Options granted at a discount are perceived
more positively by the employees who receive such Options.
The Committee will determine on a case-by-case basis whether a discount will be given, and if so, the
quantum of the discount, taking into account the objective that is desired to be achieved by us and the
prevailing market conditions. As the actual discount given will depend on the relevant circumstances, the
extent of the discount may vary from one case to another, subject to a maximum discount of 20 per cent.
of the Market Price of the Share, as described above.
The discretion to grant Options to subscribe for Shares at an exercise price set at a discount to the
Market Price will, however, be used judiciously. The amount of the discount may vary from one offer to
another, and from time to time, subject to a limit of 20 per cent. on the quantum of discount in respect of
Options granted under the Scheme.
In respect of our Independent Directors, we have presently not made any decision on the terms of the
grant of Options and on whether Options will be granted at a discount to the Market Price. However,
should we decide in the future to grant Options to them at a discount, such decision will be based on
factors such as the individual performance of the Participant and the contribution of the Participant to our
success and development.
We may also grant Options without any discount to the Market Price. Additionally, we may, if we deem fit,
impose conditions on the exercise of the Options (whether such Options are granted at the Market Price
or at a discount to the Market Price), such as restricting the number of Shares for which the Option may
be exercised during the initial years following its vesting.

Participants in the Scheme
Participation of our Group Employees
The extension of the Scheme to Group employees allows us to have a fair and equitable system to
reward Directors and employees who have made and who continue to make significant contributions to
our Group’s long-term growth.
We believe the Scheme will enable us to attract, retain and provide incentives to its Participants to
produce higher standards of performance as well as encourage greater dedication and loyalty by enabling
us to give recognition to past contributions and services as well as motivating Participants generally to
contribute towards our long-term growth.
Participation of our Non-Executive Director and Independent Directors
The Scheme contemplates the participation by any person who is or may become our Non-Executive
Directors. Our Non-Executive Directors and Independent Directors, although not involved in the day-to-
day running of our operations, play an invaluable role in furthering the business interests of our Group by
contributing their experience and expertise. We believe that by allowing our Non-Executive Directors and
Independent Directors to participate in the Scheme, we will be able to provide them with an opportunity to
participate in our equity. Our Non-Executive Directors and Independent Directors are closely associated
with our business operations even though they do not hold office in an executive capacity. To allow them
to participate in the Scheme will instil in them a greater sense of involvement and belonging in our Group,
thereby enhancing our working relationship with them.
In addition, our Independent Directors are also members of our Audit Committee. They therefore
undertake a major role in our corporate governance. It is therefore in our long-term interest that we
acknowledge the services of these Directors who are members of our Audit Committee by allowing them
to participate in the Scheme. Their participation in the Scheme will also attract future suitable and more
qualified persons to sit on our Audit Committee. This will help to ensure the continuity of good corporate
governance in our Company in the long term.
To reflect our recognition of the valuable contributions and efforts of our Non-Executive Directors and
Independent Directors, the Scheme will allow us flexibility in providing reward to these Directors in a
combination of Director’s fees and Options as it may not always be possible to compensate them fully or
appropriately by increasing the Directors’ fees or other forms of cash payment. We also hope that by
being able to offer share options, it will be able to attract more well-qualified persons to act as Non-
Executive Directors and Independent Directors of our Company.
We believe that the grant of Options to our Independent Directors will not give rise to any conflict of
interests. In any event, to minimise any potential conflict of interests and not to compromise the
independence of our Independent Directors, we intend to grant only a nominal number of Options under
the Scheme to such Independent Directors. In addition, in the event that any conflict of interests arises in
any matter to be decided by our Board, we shall procure that the relevant Independent Director abstain
from voting on such matter at our Board meeting.
Disclosures in Annual Reports
Details of the number of Options granted, the number of Options exercised and the subscription price (as
well as the discounts involved, if any) will be disclosed in our annual report.
Financial Effects of The Scheme
International Financial Reporting Standard 2 on Share-based Payment (“IFRS 2”) is effective for financial
statements covering periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, and was in force at the date the
Scheme was approved. IFRS 2 requires the fair value of employee services received in exchange for the
grant of options to be recognised as an expense. For equity-settled share-based payment transactions,
the total amount to be expensed in the income statement over the vesting period is determined by
reference to the fair value of each option granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting
conditions.


At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are
expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in
the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Share options are treated as potential ordinary shares in calculating dilutive earnings per share.
Employee share options with fixed or determinable terms and non-vested ordinary share are treated as
options in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, even though they are contingent on vesting. They
are treated as outstanding on the grant date.
During the vesting period, the consolidated earnings per Share would be reduced by both the expense
recognised and the potential ordinary shares to be issued under the Scheme. When the options are
exercised, the consolidated net tangible assets will be increased by the amount of cash received in
subscription for the Option Shares. On a per Share basis, the effect is accretive if the subscription price is
above the net tangible assets per Share but dilutive otherwise.
We have made an application to the SGX-ST for permission to deal in, and for quotation of, our Shares
which may be issued upon the exercise of the Options to be granted under the Scheme. The approval of
the SGX-ST is not to be taken as an indication of the merits of our Company, our subsidiaries, our
Shares, the New Shares, the Option Shares or the Additional Shares.

INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS 
OF INTEREST
INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS
In general, transactions between our Group and any of our interested persons (namely, our Directors,
Chief Executive Officer or Controlling Shareholders or the Associates of such Directors, Chief Executive
Officer or Controlling Shareholders) would constitute “Interested Person Transactions” for the purposes of
Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual.
Our interested persons include Mr. Motokuni Yamashiro, Mr. Kazuhiko Yoshida, Mr. Michio Tanamoto, Mr.
Robert Van Jin Nien, Mr. Jörg Wilhem Schelp, Mr. Hamilton Jian-Ren Chueh, Mr. V-Nee Yeh, Mr. Ang Miah
Khiang and Mr. Ronnie Teo Heng Hock who are our Directors and the Evergreen Group. Save as
disclosed below, none of our Controlling Shareholders, Directors, Executive Officers, or their respective
Associates, has any interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction undertaken by our Group within the past
three years ended 31 December 2006 and from 1 January 2007 up to the Latest Practicable Date.
Past, Present and Ongoing Transactions
Transactions with the Evergreen Group 
Historically, part of our loan syndication business has involved Uni-Asia arranging loan facilities, operating
leases and, or finance leases for the Evergreen Group.
Evergreen International S.A. is a private, Panamanian company controlled as to 100% by Dr. Chang and
his associates, Mr. Chang Kuo Hua, Mr. Chang Kuo Ming and Mr. Chang Kuo Cheng. It is a holding
company with direct and indirect interests in a number of companies engaged in the ownership and
operation of shipping and aircraft fleets, including various major members of the Evergreen Group.
Although no member of our Group is in the business of lending money to Evergreen or any other
company of the Evergreen Group, Uni-Asia has earned and continues to earn fees from these companies
as a result of arranging loans or other financing transactions, such as operating leases and finance
leases, for these companies, the lenders or financiers of which are syndicates of banks or other lending
institutions whose participants are independent of and not interested persons of our Company.
The fees which Uni-Asia earns from these transactions comprise arrangement fees, paid at the outset,
typically on or around drawdown of a loan facility or on the initial leasing of the asset, i.e. the ship or
aircraft, in relation to an operating lease or finance lease. In addition, Uni-Asia earns ongoing annual
agency fees, over the tenor of the facilities, in relation to its role as agent of the syndicate members. The
annual agency fees earned are minimal in comparison to the arrangement fees in respect of any loan or
financing transaction.
In the normal course of business, we arrange loans or other financial transactions for the Evergreen
Group. Such transactions are of an ad-hoc nature and have been carried out on an arm’s length basis.
We also act as facility agent for these loans and financial transactions.
The aggregate fees, including arrangement fees, agency fees and interest income, received from the
Evergreen Group in each of the past three years ended 31 December 2006 and from 1 January 2007 up
to the Latest Practicable Date are as follows:
From 
1 January 2007

The fees received from Evergreen are based on our normal rates charged to our other customers at the
relevant time. Such transactions, if continued after our listing on the SGX-ST, will be subject to the review
procedures described in “Guidelines For Future Interested Person Transactions” below, to ensure that
they are continued on an arm’s length basis.


Guidelines For Future Interested Person Transactions
In the event that we enter into certain transactions with interested persons in the future, such future
transactions with interested persons must comply with the requirements of the Listing Manual. As
required by the Listing Manual, our Articles of Association require a Director to abstain from voting in any
contract or arrangement in which he has a personal material interest. Our internal control procedures will
be designed to ensure that all Interested Person Transactions are conducted at arm’s length and on
normal commercial terms.
Any interested person transaction will be properly documented and submitted semi-annually to our Audit
Committee for its review to ensure that all Interested Person Transactions are conducted at arm’s length
and on normal commercial terms. In the event that a member of our Audit Committee is interested in any
Interested Person Transaction, he will abstain from reviewing that particular transaction. Our Audit
Committee will include the review of all such Interested Person Transaction as part of the standard
procedures while examining the adequacy of our internal controls.
Our Audit Committee will ensure that all provisions and disclosure requirements on all such Interested
Person Transactions, including those required by prevailing legislation, the Listing Manual and accounting
standards, as the case may be, are complied with.
Our Directors will ensure that all disclosure requirements on Interested Person Transactions, including
those required by prevailing legislation, will be subject to shareholders’ approval if deemed necessary by
the Listing Manual. We will disclose in our annual report the aggregate value of Interested Person
Transactions conducted during the financial year.
Review Procedures for Future Interested Person Transactions
Our Audit Committee will review and approve Interested Person Transactions, to ensure that they are on
an arm’s length basis, that is, that the transactions are transacted on terms and prices not more
favourable to the interested person than if they were transacted with a third-party and we and our
shareholders have not been disadvantaged in accordance with the following review procedures:
(i)
all Interested Person Transactions (either individually or as part of a series or if aggregated with
other transactions involving the same Interested Person during the same financial year) below
S$100,000 will not require the approval of the Audit Committee;
(ii)
all Interested Person Transactions (either individually or as part of a series or if aggregated with
other transactions involving the same Interested Person during the same financial year) below or
equal to 3% of the last audited NTA of our Group will not require approval of the Audit Committee
prior to such transactions being entered into, but will require approval by a Director who shall not
be an Interested Person in respect of the particular transaction. Any contracts to be made with an
Interested Person shall not be approved unless the pricing is determined in accordance with our
usual business practices and policies, consistent with the usual profit margin built-in or discount
given or price received by us for the same or substantially similar type of transactions between us
and unrelated parties and the terms are no more favourable to the interested person than those
extended to or received from unrelated parties; and
(iii)
all Interested Person Transactions (either individually or as part of a series or if aggregated with
other transactions involving the same Interested Person during the same financial year) in excess
of 3% of the last audited NTA of our Group will be reviewed by and will require approval by the
Audit Committee prior to such transactions being entered into.
We intend to prepare relevant information (such as pricing guidelines, pricing for similar existing
customers and quotations obtained from third-parties) to assist our Audit Committee in its review of all
Interested Person Transactions.
142
INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS 
OF INTEREST


Before any agreement or arrangement that is not in our ordinary course of business is transacted, prior
approval must be obtained from our Audit Committee. In the event that a member of the Audit Committee
is interested in any of the Interested Person Transaction, he will abstain from reviewing that particular
transaction. Any decision to proceed with such an agreement or arrangement would be recorded for
review by the Audit Committee.
We also intend to comply with the provisions in Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual in respect of all future
Interested Person Transactions, and if required under the Listing Manual, we will seek our Shareholders’
approval for such transactions.
Other Review Procedures
In view that part of our loan syndication business has historically involved the arrangement of loan
facilities, operating leases and/or finance leases for the Evergreen Group, we will, in the interests of good
corporate governance, apply the same review and approval procedures as those applicable to future
Interested Person Transactions, to all our future transactions with the Evergreen Group, for so long as
Evergreen holds a direct and/or indirect shareholding interest of five per cent. or more in our Company.
However, as Evergreen is not an interested person for the purposes of Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual,
our transactions with Evergreen Group will not be subject to the disclosure requirements under Chapter 9
of the Listing Manual. The requirements under Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual will only apply to
transactions with the Evergreen Group in the event of Evergreen becoming an interested person in the
future.
POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS
Our non-Executive Director, Mr. Robert Van Jin Nien, has a 0.08% shareholding interest in and is also a
director of Hopewell Holdings Limited (“Hopewell”), a company in the principal business of property
development. Hopewell is our substantial shareholder, and is currently publicly listed in Hong Kong. Our
Board believes that Mr. Nien’s interests in Hopewell does not give rise to a material conflict of interests,
given that he does not have a material shareholding interest in Hopewell. In the event that Mr. Nien or the
Board is of the view that any material conflict of interests should arise, Mr. Nien will abstain from
deliberating and participating in the decision-making process of our Board, in relation to any such matter
in question.
Our Independent Director, Mr. V-Nee Yeh, is a director and non-executive chairman of Argyle Street
Management Limited (“ASM”), a fund management company that manages other funds investing in
distressed assets, including the ASM Asia Recovery Fund. Mr. Yeh holds units in the ASM Asia Recovery
Fund and also has a 33.33% shareholding interest in Argyle Street Management (Holdings) Limited
(“ASMH”), which in turn owns 100% of ASM. As Mr. Yeh does not have majority control over ASM, he
does not control the decision-making of the board or investment committee of ASM. Our Board believes
that potential conflicts of interests would be minimised by the fact that Mr. Yeh is an independent non-
executive director of our Company and is not involved in the day-to-day business of our Group. In
addition, as a Director of our Company, Mr. Yeh will also have a duty to disclose any conflicts of interest,
as soon as he becomes aware of the same. He will also abstain from voting in respect of any matter
where a conflict of interests arises and is required to act in the interests of our Company and our
shareholders as a whole when performing his duties as an Independent Director of our Company. Our
Board believes that his professional background in distressed assets fund management is beneficial to us
as he would have a better understanding of our business. In connection with Mr. Yeh’s appointment as our
Independent Director, we will, prior to the registration of this Prospectus with the MAS, enter into a
confidentiality agreement with Mr. Yeh, pursuant to which Mr. Yeh will be required to keep confidential and
not use, divulge, disclose or deliver to any person (except as authorised or required by his duties or by
law) any information acquired by him in the course of his role as director of the Company and which (i) is
a trade secret or know-how of our  Company or is otherwise the confidential property of our Company or
any of its related corporations; or (ii) was acquired by the director under a duty of confidentiality. Mr. Yeh
will also be required to use his best endeavours to prevent the publication or disclosure of any trade
143
INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS 
OF INTEREST


secret or know-how of our Company, or confidential information concerning the business or the finance of
our Company or any of our related companies or of any person or company with whom our Company
deals. The above confidentiality requirements shall continue to apply after the termination of Mr. Yeh’s
appointment without limit in time, but shall cease to apply to information or knowledge which may come
into the public domain other than by breach of these provisions.
Each of our Executive Directors, Mr. Motokuni Yamashiro, Mr. Kazuhiko Yoshida and Mr. Michio Tanamoto,
has an option to subscribe for new shares in our associated company, Capital Advisers. Mr. Yoshida and
Mr. Tanamoto are also directors of Capital Advisers. None of their options, if fully exercised, would each
amount to more than 1.63% of the enlarged share capital of Capital Advisers. They do not currently hold
any shares directly in Capital Advisers. In order to minimise any potential conflicts of interests, each of
Mr. Motokuni Yamashiro, Mr. Kazuhiko Yoshida and Mr. Michio Tanamoto will abstain from deliberating and
participating in the decision-making process of our Board, in relation to any issues concerning our
transactions with Capital Advisers. In addition, as our Directors each of Mr. Motokuni Yamashiro, Mr.
Kazuhiko Yoshida and Mr. Michio Tanamoto will also have a duty to disclose any conflicts of interest, as
soon as he becomes aware of the same. They will also be required to act in the interests of our
Company and our Shareholders as a whole when performing their duties as our Directors.
Save as disclosed above and in the section entitled “Interested Person Transactions” in this Prospectus:-
(a)
none of our Directors, Executive Officers, Controlling Shareholders or any of their Associates has
had any interest, direct or indirect, in any transactions to which our Company was or is to be a
party;
(b)
none of our Directors, Executive Officers, Controlling Shareholders or any of their Associates has
any interest, direct or indirect, in any company carrying on the same business or a similar trade
which competes materially and directly with the existing business of our Group; and
(c)
none of our Directors, Executive Officers, Controlling Shareholders or any of their Associates has
any interest, direct or indirect, in any company that is our customer or supplier of goods and
services.
Mitigation
Upon completion of the Invitation, there is no single Controlling Shareholder of our Group.
We believe that any potential conflicts of interest are addressed as follows:

We have established policies and procedures, including internal audit controls, to ensure that our
transactions with our Controlling Shareholders and their affiliates are entered into on arm’s length
and normal commercial terms. In this regard, our Company has appointed an internal auditor (the
“Internal Auditor”) to undertake the role of the internal audit function. The Internal Auditor will be
responsible for assessing the internal auditing and reporting controls and procedures within our
Group and to make recommendations, as appropriate, to the Audit Committee.

Upon our listing on the SGX-ST, we will be subject to the SGX-ST rules on Interested Person
Transactions. The objective of these rules is to ensure that our Interested Person Transactions do
not prejudice the interests of our Shareholders as a whole. These rules require us to make prompt
announcements, disclosures in our annual reports and/or seek Shareholders’ approval for certain
material Interested Person Transactions. Further, our Audit Committee may have to, and we may
have to appoint independent financial advisers to, review such Interested Person Transactions and
state whether or not it is, or they are, of the view that such transactions are on normal commercial
terms and are not prejudicial to our interests and our minority Shareholders.
144
INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS 
OF INTEREST



Our Audit Committee will review Interested Person Transactions on a periodic basis to ensure
compliance with our policies and procedures, including internal audit controls, and with the relevant
provisions of the SGX-ST rules. The review will include an examination of the nature of the
transactions and such relevant supporting data as the Audit Committee may deem necessary. If a
member of our Audit Committee has an interest in a transaction, he will abstain from participating
in the review and approval process of the Audit Committee in relation to that transaction. Our Audit
Committee will also review the policies and procedures to ensure that they are adequate to achieve
the objectives of ensuring that our Interested Person Transactions are entered into on arm’s length
and normal commercial terms.

Our Directors owe fiduciary duties to us, including the duty to act in good faith and in our best
interests. Our Directors have a duty to disclose any conflict of interest, as soon as they become
aware of any conflict, including a conflict that arises from a directorship in a competing company or
from a personal investment in a competing company and, in such event, such Director may only
vote in respect of any such decision if his fiduciary duties so allow and only in accordance with
such duties. Our Directors are also subject to a duty of confidentiality, which precludes a Director
from disclosing to any third-party information that is confidential to us.

Our Audit Committee will review any conflicts of interest disclosed to our Board and the exercise of
Directors’ fiduciary duties in this respect. Upon disclosure of an actual or potential conflict of
interest by a Director, our Audit Committee will consider whether a conflict of interest does in fact
exist and whether it is appropriate that such Director abstain from voting in respect of a matter
where the conflict of interest arises. The review will include an examination of the nature of the
conflict and such relevant supporting data as our Audit Committee may deem reasonably
necessary. If any member of our Audit Committee has a conflict of interest which is brought before
our Audit Committee, such member shall not participate in any proceedings of our Audit Committee
in relation to such conflict of interest.

TAXATION
148
The following is a discussion of certain tax matters arising under the current tax laws of the Cayman
Islands, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and the PRC and is not intended to be and does not constitute
legal or tax advice. While this discussion is considered to be a correct interpretation of existing laws in
force, no assurance can be given that courts or fiscal authorities responsible for the administration of
such laws will agree with this interpretation or that changes in such laws will not occur. The discussion is
limited to a general description of certain tax consequences in the respective countries with respect to
ownership of our Shares by investors in those respective countries, and does not purport to be a
comprehensive nor exhaustive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a
decision to purchase our Shares. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding tax
and other tax consequences of owning and disposing our Shares. It is emphasised that neither our
Company, our Directors nor any other persons involved in the Invitation accepts responsibility for any tax
effects or liabilities resulting from the subscription for, purchase, holding or disposal of our Shares.
CAYMAN ISLANDS TAXATION
Pursuant to section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (1999 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, our Company
has obtained an undertaking from the Governor in Cabinet:
(a)
that no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any taxes to be levied on profits or
income or gains or appreciation shall apply to the Company or its operations; and
(b)
in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income gains or appreciations or which is in the
nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable by the Company:
(i)
on or in respect of the shares, debentures or other obligations of the Company; or
(ii)
by way of withholding in whole or in part of any relevant payment as defined in Section 6(3)
of the Tax Concession Law (1999 Revision).
The undertaking is for a period of twenty years, commencing 8 April 1997.
The Cayman Islands currently levy no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income,
gains or appreciations and there is not taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are
no other taxes likely to be material to our Company levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands
save certain stamp duties which may be applicable, from time to time, on certain instruments executed in
or brought within the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands are not party to any double
tax treaties.
SINGAPORE TAXATION 
Individual Income Tax
An individual is a tax resident in Singapore in a year of assessment if, in the preceding year, he was
physically present in Singapore or exercised an employment in Singapore (other than as a director of a
company) for 183 days or more, or if he resides in Singapore.
The following income received in Singapore by non-resident individuals is exempt from Singapore income
tax:
(a)
all foreign sourced income; and
(b)
Singapore-sourced investment income from financial instruments.
For individual tax residents of Singapore, the income specified in (a) and (b) above is exempt from tax
except where such income is derived through a partnership in Singapore or is derived through carrying
on of a trade, business or profession.


Thus, an individual taxpayer is only subject to Singapore income tax on income (other than certain
investment income and one-tier dividends which are exempt from tax) accrued in or derived from
Singapore, irrespective of whether that person is a resident or non-resident of Singapore.
The tax rate for a resident individual varies according to the individual’s circumstances, but is subject to
the current maximum rate of 20% for the year of assessment 2007 (i.e. calendar year 2006). A non-
resident individual is normally taxed at the corporate tax rate, except that Singapore employment income
is taxed at a flat rate of 15% or at resident rates, whichever yields a higher tax.
Corporate Income Tax
A corporate taxpayer is regarded as resident for Singapore tax purposes if its business is controlled and
managed in Singapore.
A Singapore resident corporate taxpayer is subject to Singapore income tax on income accrued in or
derived from Singapore, and on foreign sourced income received in Singapore.
However, foreign
dividends, branch profits and foreign sourced service income received in Singapore by a Singapore
resident company are exempt from Singapore tax if certain conditions are met. In addition, one-tier
dividends received by a resident company are also exempt from Singapore income tax.
A non-resident corporate taxpayer, with certain exceptions, is subject to income tax only on income that is
accrued in or derived from Singapore, and on foreign sourced income received in Singapore, subject to
certain exceptions. One-tier dividends received by a non-resident Singapore company are also exempt
from Singapore income tax. There is no withholding tax on dividends paid by a Singapore resident
company to non-resident shareholders.
The corporate tax rate is presently 18%. In calculating a company’s chargeable income, 75% of up to the
first S$10,000 of chargeable income and 50% of up to the next S$290,000 are exempt from corporate tax
with effect from year of assessment 2008. The remaining chargeable income will be fully taxable at the
corporate tax rate of 18%. The tax exemptions referred to above do not apply to Singapore dividend
income.
Dividend Distributions
Singapore moved to the one-tier corporate tax system with effect from 1 January 2003. Under this
system, the tax collected from corporate profits is final and all Singapore dividends paid by Singapore tax
resident companies to their shareholders are exempt from tax (“one-tier tax exempt dividends”).
If the company is a Singapore tax resident company under the one-tier corporate tax system, it can
distribute one-tier tax exempt dividends to its shareholders. Such dividends are exempt from Singapore
income tax in the hands of its shareholders.
Gains on Disposal of our Shares
Singapore does not impose tax on capital gains. However, there are no specific laws or regulations which
deal with the characterisation of gains. In general, gains may be construed to be of an income nature and
subject to Singapore income tax if they arise from activities which the Inland Revenue Authority of
Singapore regards as the carrying on of a trade or business in Singapore.
Any profits from the disposal of our Shares are not taxable in Singapore unless the seller is regarded as
having derived gains of an income nature, in which case, the disposal profit would be taxable.
Stamp Duty
There is no stamp duty payable on the subscription of our Shares.
Stamp duty is payable in Singapore on an instrument of transfer of our Shares at the rate of S$0.20 for
every S$100.00 or any part thereof, computed based on the consideration for or market value of our
Shares, whichever is higher.
TAXATION
149


The purchaser is liable for stamp duty, unless there is an agreement to the contrary. No stamp duty is
payable if no instrument of transfer is executed or the instrument of transfer is executed outside
Singapore. However, stamp duty may be payable if the instrument of transfer which is executed outside
Singapore is received in Singapore.
The above stamp duty is not applicable to electronic transfers of shares effected through the Central
Depository system.
Estate Duty
Singapore estate duty is imposed on the value of immovable property situated in Singapore owned by
individuals who are not domiciled in Singapore, subject to specific exemption limits. Movable assets of
non-domiciles will be exempt from estate duty with respect to deaths occurring on or after 1 January
2002. Singapore estate duty is imposed on the value of most immovable property situated in Singapore
and on most movable property, wherever it may be, owned by individuals who are domiciled in Singapore,
subject to specific exemption limits.
Accordingly, our Shares held by an individual domiciled in Singapore are subject to Singapore estate duty
upon such individual’s death. Singapore estate duty is payable to the extent that the value of our Shares
aggregated with any other assets subject to Singapore estate duty exceeds S$600,000. Unless other
exemptions apply to the other assets, for example, the separate exemption limit for residential properties,
any excess beyond S$600,000 will be taxed at 5 per cent. of the first S$12,000,000 of the individual’s
Singapore chargeable assets and thereafter at 10 per cent. Individuals, whether or not domiciled in
Singapore should consult their own tax advisors regarding the Singapore estate duty consequences of
their ownership of our Shares.
Goods and Services Tax (“GST”)
The sale of shares is considered a supply of services for GST purposes. Generally, a supply of services
made by a GST-registered person is subject to GST at the current rate of 7% unless the supply of
services can qualify for zero-rating (i.e. charge GST at 0%) under Section 21(3) of the Goods and
Services Tax Act (Cap. 117A) (“GST Act”) or can qualify for exemption under the Fourth Schedule to the
GST Act.
The sale of shares by a GST-registered investor in the course of or furtherance of a business carried on
by him through the Singapore Exchange or to another person belonging in Singapore qualifies for
exemption under the Fourth Schedule to the GST Act. However, any input GST which is incurred by the
investor in making exempt supplies is not recoverable from the Comptroller of GST.
If the sale of shares by a GST-registered investor is made to another person belonging outside
Singapore, and that person is outside Singapore when the sale is executed, the sale would qualify for
zero-rating under Section 21(3)(j) of the GST Act. Input GST which is incurred by the investor in making
zero-rated supplies is fully recoverable from the Comptroller of GST.
Brokerage, handling and clearing fees in connection with the sale or acquisition of shares charged by a
GST-registered person (e.g. broker) to an investor belonging to Singapore is subject to GST at the current
rate of 7%. Similar services rendered to an investor belonging outside Singapore should qualify for zero-
rating provided that the investor is outside Singapore when the services are performed and the services
provided do not benefit any Singapore persons.

HONG KONG TAXATION
Profits Tax
Hong Kong profits tax is chargeable on every person, including corporations, partnerships, trustees and
bodies of persons carrying on any trade, profession or business in Hong Kong in respect of his/its
assessable profits (excluding profits arising from the sale of capital assets) arising in or derived from
Hong Kong from the conduct of such trade, profession or business. Non-residents in receipt of such
profits are also subject to profit tax. The current profits tax rate is 17.5% for corporations while sole
proprietorships, partnerships and other unincorporated businesses are taxed at a rate of 16%.
Stamp Duty
Stamp duty is payable on contract note for sale or purchase of any Hong Kong stock (i.e. stock the
transfer of which is required to be registered in Hong Kong) at the rate of 0.2% of the consideration or, if
higher, the value of the Hong Kong stock being sold or transferred. This is payable half by the vendor and
half by the purchaser.
Other Taxes
Currently, there is no capital gains tax or turnover or sales taxes in Hong Kong.
Professional Tax Advice Recommended
If you are unsure about the taxation implications of subscribing for, purchasing, holding, disposing of,
dealing in, or the exercise of any rights in relation to the New Shares, you should consult an expert. Our
Company, our Directors or any person involved in the Invitation do not accept responsibility for any tax
effects on or liabilities resulting from the subscription for, purchase, holding, disposing of, dealing in, or
the exercise of any rights in relation to the New Shares.
JAPAN TAXATION 
General
Individual income taxes in Japan consist of national income tax and local inhabitant tax. An individual with
a domicile or residence in Japan for a period of one year or longer (“resident”) is subject to national and
local income taxes on worldwide income, while an individual other than a resident (“non-resident”)
having no permanent facility in Japan is subject to only national income tax solely upon income from
sources within Japan. A resident who does not possess Japanese nationality and has maintained a
residence or domicile in Japan over a period of no more than five years in the last ten years, is treated as
“a non-permanent resident”. A non-permanent resident taxpayer is subject to national and local income
taxes solely on income derived from sources within Japan and income derived from foreign sources paid
in Japan or remitted to Japan.
National income tax rates are progressive, ranging from 5% to 40% in 2007. Local inhabitant tax rate is
10% in 2007. However, interest income, capital gains from transfer of stocks etc. are taxed separately
from other income at special rates specified in the Special Taxation Measures Law.
Japanese corporate taxes consist of corporate income tax (national tax), income tax and enterprise tax
(local tax) and other local taxes.
Domestic corporations, including subsidiaries and joint ventures established under the Japanese law by
foreign enterprises are subject to corporate income tax on their worldwide income and other corporate
taxes.
Foreign corporations operating in Japan through branches are liable for the corporate income tax on the
entire income from sources within Japan and other corporate taxes.
TAXATION
151


Dividends
With respect to individual taxpayers, dividend income may be taxed as aggregate income or separately
from other income at their choice. Withholding income tax will be imposed on dividends if dividends be
paid through a paying agent in Japan. The withholding tax rate for dividends from shares listed in Japan
and overseas is 10%, comprising national tax of 7% and local tax of 3% until 31 March 2009, and 20%
thereafter, comprising national tax of 15% and local tax of 5%.
Corporate taxpayers enjoy a benefit of deduction from gross income a certain portion of dividend.
Capital Gain
With respect to individual taxpayers, capital gains derived from the transfer of stocks are taxed separately
from other income by filing a return. The current tax rate applied to these capital gains is 20%, comprising
national tax of 15% and local tax of 5% (10% for listed stocks, comprising national tax of 7% and local tax
of 3% until 31 December 2008).
As for corporate taxpayers, capital gains from the sale of securities are subject to ordinary corporate
income taxes in the same manner as ordinary income.
Inheritance Tax
Inheritance tax is imposed on the total value of all properties acquired through inheritance or bequest,
less liabilities and funeral expenses. Properties are appraised based on current prices or values at the
time of acquisition. Our Shares held by an individual domiciled in Japan are generally subject to
Japanese Inheritance Tax upon such individual’s death.

TAXATION
153


According to the Applicable Foreign Enterprises Tax Law, before the Enterprise Income Tax Law of
the PRC 
comes into effect, a foreign investment enterprise is
required to pay a national income tax at a rate of 30% of their taxable income and a local income
tax at a rate of 3% of their taxable income. The main tax preference is as follow:
(i)
A foreign investment enterprise engaged in production having a period of operation of not
less than 10 years shall be exempted from income tax for the first two profit making years
and a 50% reduction in the income tax payable for the next three years. The income tax
concession for foreign investment enterprises engaged in the exploitation of resources such
as petroleum, natural gas, rare metals and precious metals are regulated separately by the
State Council.
(ii)
Foreign investment enterprises established in special economic zones, foreign enterprises
having an establishment in special economic zones engaged in production or business
operations and foreign investment enterprises engaged in production in economic and
technological zones may pay income tax at a reduced rate of 15%. Foreign investment
enterprises engaged in production established in coastal economic open zones or in the old
urban districts of cities where the special economic zones or the economic and technological
development zones are located may pay income tax at a reduced rate of 24%.
The Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC 
sets a new income tax
rate of 25% for all resident enterprises. The main tax rates are as follows:
(i)
A preferential rate of 20% to eligible small low-profit enterprises and a preferential rate of
15% to hi-tech enterprises receiving priority support from the State (Article 28)
(ii)
More tax preferential treatment to venture investment enterprises (Article 31) and to
enterprises investing in environmental protection, energy and water conservation, work
safety, etc. (Article 34).
(iii)
Preferential tax policy on investment in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries and
infrastructure construction, income from environmental protection projects and eligible
technology transfer (Article 27).
(iv)
Direct tax reduction or exemption with a substitute preferential policy for labor service
enterprises, welfare enterprises and enterprises making comprehensive use of resources
(Articles 30 and 33).
(v)
Transitional measures for enterprises enjoying the existing statutory tax preferential
treatment: old enterprises established before the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC
becomes effective, who were entitled to enjoy an income tax rate of 15% or 24% under the
current tax laws may, pursuant to the regulations of the State Council, continue to enjoy a
gradually increasing transitional income tax rate within five years after the new Enterprise
Income Tax Law becomes effective. Old enterprises entitled to enjoy regular tax reduction
and exemption treatment under the current income tax laws may continue to enjoy remaining
incentives in accordance with the requirements and period specified by the current income
tax laws. However, for enterprises that have not made any profits and thus not enjoyed such
preferential treatment, the period for enjoying preferential treatment shall be calculated from
the year in which the new Enterprise Income Tax Law becomes effective. The State Council
shall develop measures for implementing such transitional incentives (Article 57).
(b)
Value-Added Tax
All units and individuals which and who, in the territory of the PRC, sell goods, render services
such as processing, repair and spare parts replacement, or import goods, shall be the taxpayers of
value-added tax.

to 20% (recreation industry).
(d)
Consumption Tax
Consumption tax has, in all, 11 tax items and 25 tax rates (tax volumes), from the lowest 3% to the
highest 45%. The tax rate is generally decided by prices in the production process, however, the
tax rate for yellow rice wine, beer, petrol and diesel oil is determined by the quantity in production.
The taxable export consumer goods, except those subject to special State provisions, should be
exempt from consumption tax.
(e)
Land Value-Added Tax
There are four categories of tax rates applicable under Land Value-Added Tax:
(i)
For the part of increased value that does not surpass 50% of the deduction of fixed items,

of fixed items, the tax rate is 40%.
(iii)
For the part of increased value that surpasses 100% but no more than 200% of the
deduction of fixed items, the tax rate is 50%.
(iv)

rate is 60%.

One of our Independent Directors, Mr. V-Nee Yeh, was a non-executive director and member of the
audit committee of Ocean Grand Chemicals Holdings Limited (“OGC”). OGC is a company
incorporated in Bermuda with limited liability and is currently listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong Limited (“HKSE”).
GENERAL AND STATUTORY INFORMATION
166


In early July 2006, OGC’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, alerted the OGC audit committee of
potential accounting irregularities. OGC audit committee then instructed Deloitte & Touche Forensic
Services Limited (“DTFS”) to enquire into certain accounting issues relating to certain of its
subsidiaries. In the course of its investigations, DTFS found material discrepancies in the actual
cash and bank balances of one of OGC’s subsidiaries as compared to the management accounts
of that subsidiary previously provided by that subsidiary to OGC. DTFS also noted that a
substantial amount of money was transferred out from the bank accounts of one of OGC’s
subsidiaries on 17 July 2006 to payees that were not companies within the OGC group of
companies. Trading of OGC shares on the HKSE was suspended on 17 July 2006 and remains
suspended as at the Latest Practicable Date.
The OGC board of directors resolved to apply to the Hong Kong and Bermuda courts for the
appointment of provisional liquidators in order to protect the assets of OGC and safeguard the
interests of the creditors and shareholders of OGC. Pursuant to the Order of the High Court dated
24 July 2006, Messrs Lai Kar Yan and Joseph Kin Ching Lo, both of Messrs Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu, have been appointed jointly and severally as the provisional liquidators of OGC. Taking
into account the appointment of provisional liquidators to protect the interests of OGC, Mr. Yeh,
together with both independent non-executive directors, resigned from the OGC board of directors
on 26 July 2006. An enquiry was commenced by the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong
Kong into the affairs of OGC and Ocean Grand Holdings Limited (the parent company of OGC also
listed on the HKSE). As far as Mr. Yeh is aware, as at the Latest Practicable Date, the investigations
by DTFS and SFC on the aforesaid matters are still ongoing.
According to the latest announcement of OGC dated 27 December 2006, the hearing of the
petitions to wind up OGC was adjourned to 16 April 2007 and the provisional liquidators
investigations into OGC are continuing.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS 
OF UNI-ASIA FINANCE CORPORATION
The directors submit their report together with the audited consolidated financial statements of Uni-Asia
Finance Corporation (the “Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2004.
General information
The principal activities of the Group continue to be in finance arrangement and investment management.
The Group acted in the capacity of principal investor, finance arranger and fund administrator for the
various classes of investments mentioned below. At the end of December 2003, a new investment line in
shipping was launched within the asset finance division and subsequently became a major business
segment within the Group.
The four major operation areas are described hereunder.
–
Structured Finance – Finance arrangement, acting as agent of and participating in syndicated
commercial loans and tax oriented leases; mainly in shipping in Asia.
–
Ship Investment/Management – Acquisition and disposal of ships and the investment management
of assets held by the Group and on behalf of third parties.
–
Distressed Assets Investment/Management – Acquisition and disposal of distressed Asian assets
and the investment management of assets held by the Group and on behalf of third parties.
–
Property Investment/Management – Arrangement of investments and co-investments in the
development and trading of Japanese hotels, commercial and residential properties and the
investment management of the properties held by the Group and on behalf of third parties.
The Group also retains working capital for the purpose of investment in additional projects or businesses
where the directors deem there to be short-term or long-term opportunities in niche areas where the
Group is able to extend its relevant expertise.
Operating and Financial Review
1.
Structured Finance
The Group undertakes structured finance activities under its Hong Kong and Tokyo operations.
The Group arranged 6 syndicated loans and tax leases totalling US$402 million during 2004 (2003:
8 loans/leases totalling US$404.9 million), generating US$2,383,000 (2003: US$3,060,000) in
management fees and US$251,000 (2003: US$283,000) in agency fees.
As at 31 December 2004, the outstanding loans the Group had participating in totalled
US$250,000 generating US$12,000 in interest income during the year (2003: total outstanding was
US$767,000 generating US$30,000 in interest income).
The directors view that the general business circumstances in this area in 2005 would continue to
remain robust due to the strong demand of shipping transportation brought about by the economic
growth in China and the rebound of Asian economies.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

2.
Ship Investment/Management
The Ship Investment/Management division undertakes to carry out shipping investment
management for the Group and for third parties. In December 2003, the Group ventured into
shipping investment and acted as the investor and administrator of a US$17 million fund, Searex
Asset Management Limited. The Group participated in the fund by the way of subscribing to a
29.4% interest in the outstanding performance notes.
From these shipping investment
management activities including the role as debt arranger and administrator of the fund, the Group
earned a total of US$9,594,000 (2003: US$1,136,000) including US$1,157,000 as upfront fee from
arrangement of 7 syndicated/bilateral loans totalling US$109 million, US$63,000 as agency fee,
US$184,000 as brokerage commission, US$1,415,000 as fund management fee and
US$6,682,000 as investment return.
As at 31 December 2004, the total outstanding amount
invested in the ships/shipping fund was US$4,247,000.
The directors view the business circumstances in this area would remain positive in the near term
but would exercise caution in its longer term strategies as this buoyant shipping cycle has persisted
for more than 18 months. The business outlook envisaged in asset finance is expected to remain
strong for reasons already mentioned.
3.
Distressed Assets Investment/Management
The Distressed Assets Investment/Management division carries out Non-Performing Loans (NPLs)
acquisitions and disposal for the Group and for the managed funds.
A total of US$1,862,000 was recovered in 2004 from distressed assets directly invested by the
Group (2003: US$1,245,000).
AAA Strategic Investment Limited (AAA) is a co-investment fund administrated by the Group in
participation with a Japanese financial institution. Direct and indirect total contribution from AAA to
the Group amounted to US$436,000 in 2004 (2003: US$1,014,000). As at 31 December 2004, the
nominal value of the notes issued by AAA was US$5,644,000 (2003: US$3,776,000) of which the
Group’s participation reached US$1,793,000 (2003: US$926,000).
The directors anticipate changes and a higher degree of competition in the distressed assets
market in 2005. The Group will not only focus on new NPL investment opportunities for AAA but
also, future expansion and investments in the PRC distressed assets market in partnership with
international players and local professional institutions.

4.
Property Investment Management
The Group’s property investment in Japan has been conducted mainly through Capital Advisers
Co., Limited (CA). Since 1 May 2003, CA has become an associated company in which the Group
maintains an equity interest of 44.8%.
As at 31 December 2004, the Group’s outstanding
investment in CA totalled US$7,836,000 including US$3,082,000 as ordinary capital and
US$4,754,000 as shareholders’ loan. Contribution from CA to the Group in 2004 was US$242,000
(2003: US$601,000).
CA focuses on investment in residential projects and limited service hotels through the
arrangement of new property funds or existing property funds advised, administrated and managed
by the company. The company would take minority equity participations in the projects. During the
year, CA launched a new fund structure with the participation of a Japanese financial institution
specialising in the investment of medium/small sized residential properties. As at 31 December
2004, CA had invested JPY1,209 million (2003: JPY1,400 million) direct or indirectly in Japanese
properties generating JPY478 million (2003: JPY652 million) as the total income during the year.
Profit before taxation was JPY58 million (2003: JPY140 million).
The main reason for the
significant reduction in profit was due to its corporate re-structuring and management reshuffling
exercise.
The directors view CA’s performance in 2005 would rebound in view of the new arrangement
team’s broadened investment perspective and wider deal sourcing capabilities in spite of the still
competitive and challenging market conditions.
5.
Non-core business
Non-core business conducted during the year comprises direct investment in non-core assets of
US$451,000 (2003: US$905,000).
The Group earned a pre-tax profit of US$8,114,000 (2003: US$3,442,000). The administrative
expenses totalled US$6,985,000 (2003: US$6,352,000).

General
The Company is an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on 17 March 1997
with limited liability. The principal activities of the Group are the arrangement of, acting as agent of
and participation in syndicated commercial loans, arrangement, management and co-investment in
development and trading of Japanese property assets and the acquisition, management and
disposal of distressed Asian assets and shipping business.

Accounting policies 
(a)
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements (the “Financial Statements”) are prepared under the
historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investments, defaulted loans and other
financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group in arriving at these Financial Statements
are set out below. The Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with and comply with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
In 2004, the Group has early adopted the following revised IFRS issued up to and including 31
March 2004. The 2003 comparative figures have been amended as required, in accordance with
the requirements of the following relevant standards:
IAS 28 (revised 2003)
Investments in Associates
IAS 31 (revised 2003)
Interests in Joint Ventures
IAS 32 (revised 2003)
Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation
IAS 39 (revised 2003)
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement
The early adoption of these standards has resulted in the reclassification of certain associates and
a joint venture to investments. Due to the reclassified assets having the same equity pick-up value
and fair value, there was no change to net profit or shareholders’ equity arising from the
reclassification.
In 2005, the Group will adopt the IFRS below, which are relevant to its operations:
IAS 1 (revised 2003)
Presentation of Financial Statements
IAS 8 (revised 2003)
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and
Errors
IAS 10 (revised 2003)
Events after the Balance Sheet Date
IAS 16 (revised 2003)
Property, Plant and Equipment
IAS 17 (revised 2003)

Accounting policies (Continued)
(b)
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiary undertakings, which are those companies in which the Group, directly or indirectly, has
an interest of more than one half of the voting rights or otherwise has power to exercise control
over the operations, have been consolidated. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which
effective control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date of
disposal.
All inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised surpluses and deficits on
transactions between Group companies have been eliminated. Where necessary, accounting
policies for subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the
Group.
(c)
Associates 
Associates are all entities, other than those investments where IAS 28 does not apply, over which
the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the
equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investments in
associates are detailed in Note 18.
The Group’s share of its associates post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income
statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. The
cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the
investment.
When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate
the Group does not recognise any further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made
payments on behalf of the associate.
(d)
Income recognition 
Income constitutes fee income, investment returns, fair value adjustments and interest income.
Fee income is recorded when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable
that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. Interest income is
recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective yield basis.
All other revenue is
recognized on an accruals basis.
(e)
Fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the remaining period of the lease while all other
fixed assets are depreciated at the following rates on a straight-line basis, which is deemed
sufficient to write off their costs to their residual values over their estimated useful lives: Office
equipment 33 1/3 percent per annum and other fixed assets 25 percent per annum.
Gain and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts and
are included in the consolidated income statement.

Accounting policies (Continued) 
(f)
Loans receivable
Loans originated by the Group comprise of participations in syndicated loans and are stated at
amortised cost less any impairment losses. Impairment losses are dealt with in the consolidated
income statement.
Defaulted loans are classified and measured at their fair value. Fair value is determined using a
discounted cash flow valuation technique that takes into consideration the probability weighted
expected cash recoveries on a loan-by-loan basis and the estimated costs anticipated in the
collection of loan repayments, including staff costs, legal fees, loan recovery commission or taxes
payable. Changes in fair values are dealt with in the consolidated income statement.
(g)
Investments
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or
loss and loans receivable. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets
were acquired. Management determines the classification of its assets at initial recognition and re-
evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
a)
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
This category has two sub-categories: ‘financial assets held for trading’ and those designated
at fair value through profit and loss at inception. A financial asset is classified in this category
if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated by
management. Derivatives are also categorised as ‘held for trading’ unless they are
designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they are
either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet
date.
b)
Loans receivable
Loans receivable are non-derivative financial assets which are not quoted in an active
market. These are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised at trade date - the date on which the group
commits to sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for
all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair
value through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed
in the income statement. Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cashflows from
the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially
all the risks and rewards of ownership. Available for sale financial assets and financial assets at fair
value through profit and loss are subsequently carried at fair value.

Accounting policies (Continued) 
(g)
Investments (Continued)
Fair values for unquoted securities are estimated by the directors. In determining fair valuation, the
directors make use of market-based information and fair valuation models such as discounted cash
flow models. In many instances the directors also rely on financial data of investees and on
estimates provided by the management of the investee companies as to the effect of future
developments.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, which is the date that the
Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising
from changes in the fair value of investments are included in the consolidated income statement in
the period in which they arise.
Performance notes are investments, which do not classify as jointly controlled entities, with income
and maturity values which fluctuate based on the distributions received from underlying assets,
which are generally shares in property development companies, defaulted loans or shipping
companies.
Fair values of performance notes or other collective investment schemes are
determined by the Group’s interest in the fair values of each scheme’s underlying assets. Gains
and losses arising from changes in the fair value of all securities are recognized in the consolidated
income statement as they arise.
Although the directors use their best judgement in estimating the fair value of investments, there
are inherent limitations in any estimation techniques. Future confirming events will also affect the
estimates of fair value and the effect of such events on the estimates of fair value, including the
ultimate liquidation of investments, could be material to these consolidated financial statements.
(h)
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and comprise of
cash and bank balances with an original maturity of less than three months.

Borrowings
Borrowings are recognized initially at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In
subsequent periods, fixed term borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective yield
method; any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognized in the consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowings.

(j)
Deferred taxation 
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, for all temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting
purposes. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rate currently enacted, or substantially enacted,
at the balance sheet date.
The principal temporary differences arise from depreciation on fixed assets. Deferred tax assets
relating to the carry forward of unused tax losses are recognized to the extent that it is probable
that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilized.
(k)
Employee benefits 
Pension obligations
Group companies have various defined contribution pension schemes in accordance with the local
conditions and practices in the countries in which they operate. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) and will
have no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold
sufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee services in the current and prior
periods.
For defined contribution plans, the company pays contributions to publicly or privately administered
pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
Once the contributions have been paid, the company has no further payment obligations. The
regular contributions constitute net periodic costs for the year in which they are due and as such
are included in staff costs.
(l)
Financial instruments
Financial instruments carried on the consolidated balance sheet include cash and bank balances,
loans, investments, receivables, payables and borrowings. The particular recognition methods
adopted are disclosed in the individual policy statements associate with each item.
The Group’s principal foreign exchange hedging is conducted by funding a major portion of
Japanese operations using Yen borrowings secured by US$ deposits, which are stated gross on
the consolidated balance sheet.
Disclosures in respect of financial risks to which the Group is exposed are shown in Note 27.

Accounting policies (Continued) 
(l)
Financial instruments (Continued)
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and
are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or
loss depends on whether the derivative is designated a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of
the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (1) hedges of the fair
value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge); (2) hedges of
highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges); or (3) hedges of net investments in
foreign operations.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for
undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions
are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
(a)
Fair value hedge 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges
are recorded in the consolidated income statement, together with any changes in the fair
value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
(b)
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and
qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when
the hedged item will affect profit or loss (for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged
takes place).
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the
recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in
equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the
asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or it sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria
for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in
equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income
statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain
or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the consolidated income
statements.

(c)
Net investment hedge 
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow
hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the
hedge is recognised in equity; the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised
immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the
foreign operation is disposed of.
(d)
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value
of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised
immediately in the consolidated income statement.
(m)
Foreign currency translation 
(a)
Measurement currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each entity within the Group are measured
using the currency that best reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and
circumstances relevant to that entity (“the measurement currency”).
The consolidated
financial statements are presented in United States dollars, which is the measurement
currency of the parent.
(b)
Transactions and balances 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at exchange rates ruling at the transaction
dates. Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies at the consolidated
balance sheet date are translated at rates of exchange ruling at the consolidated balance
sheet date. All exchange differences are dealt with in the consolidated income statement,
except for exchange differences arising from the Group’s net investment in foreign entities,
and from monetary liabilities that are effective hedges of the Group’s net investment in
foreign entities.
(c)
Group companies 
Income statements and cash flows of foreign entities are translated into the Group’s
reporting currency at average exchange rates for the year and their balance sheets are
translated at the exchange rates ruling on 31 December.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities and
borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments are
taken directly to equity.
When a foreign entity is sold, such exchange differences are
recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.

At 31 December 2003, the Company had been contracted to arrange finance for 10 container
ships, for which the Company will collect a US$685,000 fee in respect of each ship. Front-end fees
of US$137,000 per ship totalling US$1,137,000, to which the Company had received or were
entitled at the balance sheet date, have been booked as income for the year ended 31 December
2003. Completion fees of US$548,000 per ship totalling US$5,548,000 were to be received on
delivery and financing of each ship.
Under the commission agreement, further services are
required to be delivered by the Company and significant contingencies exist such that the directors
are not certain that the completion fees will be received for the year ended 31 December 2003 and
consequently only front-end fees have been booked as income for the year ended 2003. The
contingent asset of US$5,548,000 at 31 December 2003 was recognised as income during 2004
when circumstances were no longer contingent.
At 31 December 2004, the Company had no such outstanding contracts.

Financial instruments
(a)
Risks
The Group holds monetary assets and liabilities, transacts in foreign exchange transactions with
third parties and has mismatched Yen denominated assets and liabilities. All these operations give
rise to risk exposures.
Financial instruments traded or held include cash and cash equivalents, investments, loans
receivable and borrowings.
Off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments are contracts whose value is derived from one or
more underlying financial instruments or indices defined in the contract, which include forward rate
agreements.
Forward rate agreements are used to manage the Group’s own exposures to foreign exchange risk
as part of its asset and liability management process. The principal derivative instruments used by
the Group are foreign exchange rate related contracts. Most of the Group’s derivative positions
have been entered into to hedge investments in subsidiaries.
(i)
Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of
changes in market prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the
individual financial instrument or by factors affecting all financial instruments traded in or
indexed to a market. The Group is exposed to market risk on financial instruments that are
valued at market prices and primarily consist of investments, loans, property development
projects and marketable securities.
(ii)
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments and other assets and
liabilities will fluctuate as a result of changes in foreign exchanges rates. The Group is
exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily from the net position of Yen denominated cash
and cash equivalents, investments and borrowings.
(iii)
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of
changes in market interest rates and the cash flow risks associated with the variability of
cash flows from floating rate financial instruments. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk
primarily from interest rate re-pricing differences between customers’ loans, borrowings, cash
and cash equivalents and shareholders’ capital.
(iv)
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the failure of counterparties to meet the terms of
their obligations. The Group is exposed to credit risk through loans and investments, and
through counterparty default risk on transactions, including foreign exchange transactions in
the process of settlement.

Financial instruments (Continued)
(a)
Risks (Continued)
(v)
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk of loss resulting from the failure of the Group to meet its funding
requirements or to execute a transaction at a reasonable price. The Group is exposed to
liquidity risk relating to the gaps between the maturity of assets held against the maturity of
the funding of the Group’s activities.
(b)
Risk management
The Group’s principal risks are market risk, credit risk and foreign exchange risk. The directors
consider the interest rate risk and liquidity risk of the Group to be immaterial.
Market risk and credit risk
The Group seeks to minimise these risks by performing detailed reviews of loan counterparties or
asset issuers prior to purchase approval, and by either selling on participated loans to other parties
or entering into offsetting loans payable when the directors wish to preserve the Group’s liquidity.
The Group seeks to minimize adverse movements in market price of financial instruments by
extensive due diligence procedures to ensure acquisition at prices below their perceived fair value.
Foreign exchange risk
The directors review their currency exposures and enter into foreign currency forward contracts
when considered necessary to hedge against adverse currency movements.
The Group uses the following derivative instruments for both hedging purposes:
Forward rate agreements are individually negotiated interest rate futures that call for a cash
settlement at a future date for the difference between a contracted rate of interest and the current
market rate, based on a notional principal amount.
Currency and interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another.
Swaps result in an economic exchange of currencies or interest rates (for example, fixed rate for
floating rate) or a combination of all these (ie, cross-currency interest rate swaps). No exchange of
principal takes place, except for certain currency swaps. The Group’s credit risk represents the
potential cost to replace the swap contracts if counterparties fail to perform their obligation. This
risk is monitored on an ongoing basis with reference to the current fair value, a proportion of the
notional amount of the contracts and the liquidity of the market. To control the level of credit risk
taken, the Group assesses counterparties using the same techniques as for its lending activities.
(c)
Fair value
The directors consider the carrying amount of all financial assets and liabilities included in the
consolidated balance sheet are a reasonable estimate of their fair values.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS 
OF UNI-ASIA FINANCE CORPORATION
The directors submit their report together with the audited consolidated financial statements of Uni-Asia
Finance Corporation (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) for the year ended 31st
December 2005.
General Information 
The principal activities of the Group remained substantially the same as the previous year- finance
arrangement and investment management. The Group acted in the capacities of principal investor,
finance arranger and fund administrator for various classes of alternative investments in ships, distressed
assets and real estate. The main sources of income for the Group include fee income, investment returns,
interest income and other income generated from the four departments listed below.
-
Structured Finance department focuses on finance arrangement in the shipping sector in Asia.
The Group acts as the arranger, packager and agent and participates in syndicated commercial
loans and tax oriented leases.
-
Asset Finance department focuses on investment and management of ships including the
acquisition and disposal of ships and the investment management of assets held by the Group
and on behalf of third parties.
-
Distressed Assets Investment department focuses on investment and management activities in
Asia including the acquisition and disposal of distressed Asian assets and the investment
management of assets held by the Group and on behalf of third parties.
-
Japan real estate department focuses on the investment and management of real estate
projects in Japan including the arrangement of investment and co-investment in the
development and trading of Japanese hotels, commercial and residential properties and the
investment management of the properties held by the Group and on behalf of third parties.
The Group is also seeking investment opportunities in new areas, projects or business where it will be
able to capitalize on its finance packaging expertise.
The directors would like to report that the Group’s listing application in April 2005 to the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange was rejected. The directors would like to continue to explore the possibility of bringing the
Company public.
Operating and Financial Review
1.
Structured Finance
Structured finance activities are conducted mainly out of the Hong Kong and Tokyo offices. During
the year, the Group arranged syndicated transactions totalling US$930m (2004: US$546m).
The structured finance department generated arrangement and brokerage fee income of
US$3,494k (2004: US$2,383k) and agency fees of US$289k (2004: US$251k).
The directors are of the view that the business of finance arrangement will remain competitive.

2.
Asset Finance
The asset finance department carries out the business of shipping investment management for the
Group and for third parties. In December 2003, the Group ventured into shipping investment and
acted as the investor and administrator of two investment facilities held under Searex Asset
Management Limited. The Group participated in the fund by way of subscribing to a 29.4% and
19.57% interest in the outstanding performance notes. In 2005, the Group invested into 3 container
vessel projects namely Falcon, Fortitude and Union.
Through shipping investment management, debt arrangement and fund administration, the
department recorded total income of US$8,997k (2004: US$9,594k). A detailed breakdown of the
major income is as follows: US$1,785k as arrangement and project management fees (2004:
US$1,344k), US$65k as agency fee (2004: US$63k), US$2,552k as fund management fee (2004:
US$1,415k) and US$4,500k as investment return (2004: US$6,682k). As at 31st December 2005,
the total outstanding investment in the ships/shipping fund was US$9.7m (2004: US$4,247k).
The directors are of the view that the shipping market would remain opportunistic in the short term
driven by China’s continued economic prosperity. The anticipated increase in vessel supply is
expected to put pressure on capital values and freight rates. In the medium term, the Group will
exercise greater degree of caution in future investments and dispositions.
3.
Distressed Assets Investment 
The distressed assets investment department carries out the acquisition and disposition of non-
performing loans (NPLs) for the Group and for the managed funds.
There was no recovery in 2005 from NPLs invested directly by the Group (2004: US$1,862k). Only
moderate NPL investments were made in 2005 due primarily to a change in market dynamics and
increased investment risk.
AAA Strategic Investment Limited (AAA) is a co-investment fund administrated by the Group in
participation with a Japanese financial institution. Contribution from AAA to the Group amounted to
US$1,019k in 2005 (2004: US$405k). As at 31st December 2005, the nominal value of the notes
issued by AAA was US$5,293k (2004: US$5,644k) of which the Group’s participation reached
US$1,746k (2004: US$1,793k).
The directors are of the view that investing into NPLs has become less attractive. As a result, the
Group has extended from investment in NPLs to distressed real estate projects. The Group is
currently conducting investment and due diligence on real estate projects in Asia.
4.
Real Estate Investment Management in Japan
The Group’s property investment in Japan is conducted through Capital Advisers Co., Limited (CA),
an associated company in which the Group maintains an equity interest of 44.8%. As at 31st
December 2005, the Group’s outstanding investment in CA totaled US$6,585k (2004: US$6,928k)
including US$756k as shareholders’ loan (2004: US$4,781k). Net Contribution from CA to the
Group in 2005 was US$570k (2004: US$96k).

Real Estate Investment Management in Japan (continued)
CA focuses on investment in residential projects and limited service hotels through the
arrangement of new property funds or existing property funds advised, administrated and managed
by the company. The company would take minority equity participations in the projects. As at 31st
December 2005, CA had invested JPY1,533m (2004: JPY1,209m) direct or indirectly in Japanese
properties generating JPY949m (2004: JPY478m) in total income during the year. Profit before
taxation was JPY276m (2004: JPY58m).
In 2005, the property funds under CA’s management reached JPY43.7 billion with an increase of
JPY23.6 billion from the previous year. Also, CA has entered into the hotel operation business in
August, 2005 by purchasing all the shares of the hotel operating company, Sun–Vista.
The directors are of view that the Japan real estate market will continue to improve. CA will
continue to expand its real estate fund business and the hotel operation business in 2006 targeting
sales of JPY2,293m and ordinary income of JPY554m.
The Group reported a net profit before tax of US$9,918k (2004: US$8,114k) after factoring in total
expenses of US$8,903k (2004: US$6,985k) of which US$575k (2004: US$103k) was attributable to
the listing exercise in Hong Kong in 2005.

Summary of significant accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial
statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years
presented, unless otherwise stated.
(a)
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Uni-Asia Finance Corporation have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The consolidated financial
statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation
of financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through
profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. The areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the
consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 4.
Interpretations and amendments to published standards effective in 2005
The following amendments and interpretations to standards are mandatory for the Group’s
accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January 2005:
- IFRIC 2, Members’ Shares in Co-operative Entities and Similar Instruments (effective from 1st
January 2005);
- SIC 12 (Amendment), Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities (effective 1st January 2005); and
- IAS 39 (Amendment), Transition and Initial Recognition of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities (effective from 1 January 2005).
Management assessed the relevance of these amendments and interpretations with respect to the
Group’s operations and concluded that they are not relevant to the Group.
Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published
that are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January 2006 or
later periods but which the Group has not early adopted, as follows:

Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)
(a)
Basis of preparation (Continued)
IAS 39 (Amendment) The Fair Value Option (effective from 1 January 2006). This amendment
changes the definition of financial instruments classified at fair value through profit or loss and
restricts the ability to designate financial instruments as part of this category. The Group believes
that this amendment should not have a significant impact on the classification of financial
instruments, as the Group should be able to comply with the amended criteria for the designation
of financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss. The Group will apply this amendment
from annual periods beginning 1 January 2006
IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and a complementary Amendment to IAS 1,
Presentation of Financial Statements - Capital Disclosures (effective from 1 January 2007). IFRS 7
introduces new disclosures to improve the information about financial instruments. It requires the
disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information about exposure to risks arising from financial
instruments, including specified minimum disclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and market
risk, including sensitivity analysis to market risk. It replaces IAS 30, Disclosures in the Financial
Statements of Banks and Similar Financial Institutions, and disclosure requirements in IAS 32,
Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation. It is applicable to all entities that report under
IFRS. The amendment to IAS 1 introduces disclosures about the level of an entity’s capital and how
it manages capital. The Group assessed the impact of IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 and
concluded that the main additional disclosures will be the sensitivity analysis to market risk and the
capital disclosures required by the amendment of IAS 1. The Group will apply IFRS 7 and the
amendment to IAS 1 from annual periods beginning 1 January 2007.
(b)
Consolidation 
(i) 
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power
to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than
one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently
exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another
entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the
Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the
Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity
instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly
attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition
date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over
the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If
the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the
difference is recognized directly in the consolidated income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group
companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment
indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)
(b) 
Consolidation (Continued)
(ii) 
Associates 
Associates are all entities, other than those investment where IAS 28 does not apply, over which
the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of
between 20% to 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the
equity method of accounting and are initially recognized at cost. The Group’s investments in
associates are detailed in Note 20.
The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in the income
statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognized in reserves. The
cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the
investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the
associates, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognize further
losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent
of the Group’s interest in the associates. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of
associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted
by the Group.
Investments held by venture capital or similar entities are excluded from the scope of IAS 28 where
those investments are designated, upon initial recognition, as at fair value through profit or loss and
are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39. Certain investments of the Group have applied this
scope exemption with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss in the period of change. The
directors have determined that the Group does not carry on its business through these associates.
(c)
Revenue and other income recognition 
Arrangement fees are recognized on delivery and upon completion of the transaction when all
obligations associated with the transaction are completed and when the amount of revenue can be
measured reliably.
Agency fees and commissions are recognized when pre-agreed duties and functions of acting as
an agent has been rendered.
Project management fees are recognized on an accruals basis.
Administration / Agency Fee / Incentive fee from distressed Loans are recognized as they
crystallize according to the pre-agreed terms of contract.
Interest Income is recognized on a time-proportion basis using the effective yield basis.

Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) 
(d)
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the remaining period of the lease while all other
fixed assets are depreciated at the following rates on a straight-line basis, which is deemed
sufficient to write off their costs to their residual values over their estimated useful lives: office
equipment at 33 1/3% per annum and other fixed assets at 25% per annum.
Gain and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts and
are included in the consolidated income statement.
(e)
Financial Assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or
loss and loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial
assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its assets at initial recognition
and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
a)
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
This category has two sub-categories: ‘financial assets held for trading’ and those designated
at fair value through profit and loss at inception. A financial asset is classified in this category
if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated by
management. Derivatives are also categorised as ‘held for trading’ unless they are
designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they are
either held for trading or are expected to be realized within 12 months of the balance sheet
date.
b)
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
payments that are not quoted in an active market. These are included in current assets,
except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are
classified as non-current assets. Loans are classified as “Loans Receivable” in the balance
sheet.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised at trade date - the date on which the Group
commits to sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for
all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair
value through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed
in the income statement. Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from
the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially
all the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are
subsequently carried at fair value.

Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) 
(e)
Financial assets (Continued) 
Fair values for unquoted securities are estimated by the directors. In determining fair valuation, the
directors make use of market-based information and fair valuation models such as discounted cash
flow models. In many instances the directors also rely on financial data of investees and on
estimates provided by the management of the investee companies as to the effect of future
developments.
Performance notes are investments with income and maturity values which fluctuate based on the
distributions received from underlying assets, which are generally investments in property
development companies, defaulted loans or shipping companies. Fair values of performance notes
or other collective investment schemes are determined by the Group’s interest in the fair values of
each scheme’s underlying assets. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of all
securities are recognized in the consolidated income statement as they arise.
Although the directors use their best judgement in estimating the fair value of investments, there
are inherent limitations in any estimation techniques. Future confirming events will also affect the
estimates of fair value and the effect of such events on the estimates of fair value, including the
ultimate liquidation of investments, could be material to these consolidated financial statements.
(f)
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, bank balances and short term bank deposits with
an original maturity of less than three months.
(g)
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are
subsequently stated at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction
costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the
borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
(h)
Deferred taxation 
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated
financial statements. However, the deferred income tax, if it is not accounted for, arises from initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the
time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is
determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is
realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)
(h)
Deferred taxation (Continued) 
Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit
will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries
and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by
the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
(i)
Employee benefits 
Pension obligations
Group companies have various defined contribution pension schemes in accordance with the local
conditions and practices in the countries in which they operate. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) and will
have no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold
sufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee services in the current and prior
periods.
For defined contribution plans, the Company pays contributions to publicly or privately administered
pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
Once the contributions have been paid, the Company has no further payment obligations. The
regular contributions constitute net periodic costs for the year in which they are due and as such
are included in staff costs.
(j)
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and
are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or
loss depends on whether the derivative is designated a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of
the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of net investments in
foreign operations.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for
undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions
are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.

(j)
Derivative financial instruments  and hedging activities (Continued)
(a)
Net investment hedge  
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and
qualify as Net Investment hedge are recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the consolidated income statement
when the foreign operation is disposed of.
(b)
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value
of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised
immediately in the consolidated income statement.
(k)
Foreign currency translation 
(a)
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using
the currency of the primary economic environment in which   the entity operates (‘the
functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in United States
Dollars, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
(b) 
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting
from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the
income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and
qualifying net investment hedges.
(c)
Group companies
The results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the currency of
a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation
currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

Foreign currency translation (Continued)
(c)
Group companies
(i)
assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at
the date of that balance sheet;
income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates
(unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the
dates of the transactions); and
(ii)
all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity. On
consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in
foreign operations, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges
of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ equity. When a foreign operation is sold,
exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement
as part of the gain or loss on sale.
(iii)
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated
as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
(l)
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the
lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any
incentives received form the lessor) are charged to the consolidated income statement on a
straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
(m)
Dividend distributions 
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s
financial statements in the period in which dividends are approved.
(n)
Segment reporting 
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services
that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments. A
geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic
environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments
operating in other economic environments.

Critical accounting estimates
Estimates are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors,
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities are discussed below.
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined by
using valuation techniques. The Group uses its judgment in selecting  methods and makes
assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. The Group
has used discounted cash flow analysis to value investments which were not traded in an active
market. Management has used discount rates which it believes would be able to reasonably
capture the expected recovery from the underlying projects.

UNI-ASIA FINANCE CORPORATION
(Incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability)

Financial risk management 
(a)
Financial risk factors 
The Group holds monetary assets and liabilities, transacts in foreign exchange transactions with
third parties and has mismatched Yen denominated assets and liabilities. All these operations give
rise to risk exposures.
Financial instruments traded or held include cash and cash equivalents, investments, loans and
receivables and borrowings.
Forward rate agreements are used to manage the Group’s own exposures to foreign exchange risk
as part of its asset and liability management process. The principal derivative instruments used by
the Group are foreign exchange rate related contracts. Most of the Group’s derivative positions
have been entered into to hedge investments in subsidiaries.
(i)
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in
market prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial
instrument or by factors affecting all financial instruments traded in or indexed to a market. The
Group is exposed to market risk on financial instruments that are valued at market prices and
primarily consist of investments, loans, property development projects and marketable securities.
(ii)
Foreign exchange risk
The Group has certain investments in Japan, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency
translation risk. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations is
managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
(iii)
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of
changes in market interest rates and the cash flow risks associated with the variability of cash
flows from floating rate financial instruments. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily
from interest rate re-pricing differences between customers’ loans, borrowings, cash and cash
equivalents and shareholders’ capital.
(iv) 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the failure of counterparties to meet the terms of their
obligations. The Group is exposed to credit risk through loans and investments, and through
counterparty default risk on transactions, including foreign exchange transactions in the process of
settlement.

Financial Risk Management (Continued)
(v) 
Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities,
the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability
to close out market positions.
(b)
Risk management
The Group’s principal risks are market risk, credit risk and foreign exchange risk. The directors
consider the interest rate risk and liquidity risk of the Group to be immaterial.
Market risk and credit risk
The Group seeks to minimise these risks by performing detailed reviews of loan counterparties or
asset issuers prior to purchase approval, and by either selling on participated loans to other parties
or entering into offsetting loans payable when the directors wish to preserve the Group’s liquidity.
The Group seeks to minimize adverse movements in market price of financial instruments by
extensive due diligence procedures to ensure acquisition at prices below their perceived fair value.
Foreign exchange and interest rate risk
The directors review their currency exposures and enter into foreign currency forward contracts
when considered necessary to hedge against adverse currency movements.
The Group uses the following derivative instruments for both hedging purposes:
Forward rate agreements are individually negotiated interest rate futures that call for a cash
settlement at a future date for the difference between a contracted rate of interest and the current
market rate, based on a notional principal amount.
Currency and interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another.
Swaps result in an economic exchange of currencies or interest rates (for example, fixed rate for
floating rate) or a combination of all these (i.e. cross-currency interest rate swaps). No exchange of
principal takes place, except for certain currency swaps. The Group’s credit risk represents the
potential cost to replace the swap contracts if counterparties fail to perform their obligation. This
risk is monitored on an ongoing basis with reference to the current fair value, a proportion of the
notional amount of the contracts and the liquidity of the market. To control the level of credit risk
taken, the Group assesses counterparties using the same techniques as for its lending activities.
Liquidity risk 
The Group will maintain sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding
through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market
positions.

Financial Risk Management (Continued)
(c)
Fair value estimation 
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active is based on quoted market prices at the
balance sheet date. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the
current bid price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-
the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses a variety of
methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance
sheet date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term
debt. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value
for the remaining financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the
present value of the estimated future cash flows. The fair value of forward foreign exchange
contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The nominal value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to
approximate their fair values.

Asset Finance
The asset finance department is engaged in shipping investment management for the Group and
for third parties. In December 2003, the Group ventured into shipping investment and acted as the
investor and administrator of two investment facilities held under Searex Asset Management
Limited. As at December 2006, the Group participated in the fund by way of subscribing to a
29.39% and 28.26% interest in the outstanding performance notes. In 2006, the Group also
invested 46% in Sunrise Shipping S.A and 40.4% in Harmonic Shipping S.A.
Through shipping investment management, debt arrangement and fund administration, the
department recorded total income of US$11,013k (2005: US$8,997k). A detailed breakdown of the
major income is as follows: US$1,289k as arrangement and project management fees (2005:
US$1,785k), US$63k as agency fee (2005: US$65k), US$1,939k as fund management fee (2005:
US$2,552k) and US$7,403k as investment return (2005: US$4,500k). As at 31st December 2006,
the total outstanding investment in the ships/shipping fund was US$18m (2005: US$13.4m).
The directors are of the view that the shipping market would remain opportunistic. The Group is
expected to launch a new shipping fund in Singapore in the near term and to launch new shipping
joint ventures to grow the size of the funds under management.
3.
Distressed Assets Investment 
The distressed assets investment department carries out the acquisition and disposition of non-
performing loans (NPLs) for the Group and for the managed funds.
AAA Strategic Investment Limited (AAA) is a co-investment fund administrated by the Group in
participation with a Japanese financial institution. Contribution from AAA to the Group amounted to
US$1,177k in 2006 (2005: US$1,019k). As at 31st December 2006, the nominal value of the notes
issued by AAA was US$2,674k (2005: US$5,294k) of which the Group’s participation reached
US$891k (2005: US$1,746k).
The directors are of the view that investing into NPLs has become less attractive. As a result, the
Group has extended from investment in NPLs to distressed and/or real estate projects. The Group
is currently conducting investment and due diligence on real estate investments in Asia; in
particular, China.

Real Estate Investment Management in Japan
The Group’s property investment in Japan is conducted through Capital Advisers Co., Limited (CA),
an associated company in which the Group maintains an equity interest of 44.8%. As at 31st
December 2006, the Group’s outstanding investment in CA totaled US$8,397k (2005: US$6,585k).
Net Contribution from CA to the Group in 2006 was US$1,918k (2005: US$570k).
CA focuses on investment in residential projects and limited service hotels through the
arrangement of new property funds or existing property funds advised, administrated and managed
by the company. The company would take minority equity participations in the projects. As at 31st
December 2006, CA had invested JPY1,324m (2005: JPY1,534m) directly or indirectly in Japanese
properties along with property of sales of generating JPY3,419m (2005: JPY1,262m) in total
income during the year. Profit before taxation was JPY970m (2005: JPY279m).
In 2006, the property funds under CA’s management reached JPY58.4 billion with an increase of
JPY14.7 billion from the previous year.
The directors are of view that the Japan real estate market will continue to improve. CA will
continue to expand its real estate fund business and the hotel operation business in 2007.
The Group reported a net profit before tax of US$11,831k (2005: US$9,918k) after factoring in total
expenses of US$9,485k (2005: US$8,901k).

AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF
UNI-ASIA FINANCE CORPORATION
(Incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability)
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Uni-Asia Finance Corporation
(the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, the “Group”) which comprise the consolidated balance
sheet as of 31 December 2006 and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of
changes in shareholders’ equity and consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended and a
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
Directors’ responsibility for the financial statements 
Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. This responsibility includes:
designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting
and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the
circumstances.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit.
Opinion
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the
financial position of the Group as of 31 December 2006, and of its financial performance and its cash
flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

Summary of significant accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial
statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years
presented, unless otherwise stated.
(a)
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Uni-Asia Finance Corporation have been prepared
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The consolidated
financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by
the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at
fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. The areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to
the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in note 4.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory
for financial year ending 31 December 2006.
Amendment to IAS 39, Amendment to ‘The fair value option’, effective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2006. This amendment does not have any impact on the
classification and valuation of the Group’s financial instruments which were classified at fair
value through profit or loss prior to 1 January 2006 as the Group was able to comply with the
amended criteria for the designation of financial instruments at fair value through profit or
loss;
Amendment to IAS 21, Amendment ‘Net investment in a foreign operation’, effective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006. This amendment is not relevant for the
Group;
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been
issued but are not effective for 2006 and have not been early adopted:
IFRIC 8, ‘Scope of IFRS 2’, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006.
Management is currently assessing the impact of IFRIC 8 on the Group’s operations;

Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)
(a)
Basis of preparation (Continued)
IFRIC 9, ‘Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives’, effective for annual periods beginning on
or after 1 June 2006.
Management believes that this interpretation should not have a
significant impact on the reassessment of embedded derivatives as the Group already
assess if embedded derivative should be separated using principles consistent with IFRIC 9;
and
IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’, effective for annual periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2007.
IAS 1, ‘Amendments to capital disclosures’, effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007. The Group assessed the impact of IFRS 7
and the amendment to IAS 1 and concluded that the main additional disclosures will be the
sensitivity analysis to market risk and capital disclosures required by the amendment of IAS
1. The Group will apply IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 from annual periods beginning
1 January 2007.
IFRS 8, ‘Operating Segments’ effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 January
2009.
Other standards, amendments, and interpretations mandatory for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2006 are not relevant to the Group’s operation.
(b)
Consolidation 
(i)
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group
has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a
shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered
when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-
consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of
subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of
the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the
date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination
are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the
extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value
of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If
the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary
acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between
group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated but considered
an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted
by the Group.

Consolidation (Continued)
(ii)
Associates 
Associates are all entities, over which the Group has significant influence but not
control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% to 50% of the voting
rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting and are initially recognized at cost. The Group’s investments in associates
are detailed in Note 19.
The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in
the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is
recognized in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted
against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in
an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associates, including any other
unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has
incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated
to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates. Unrealized losses are also
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset
transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Investments held by venture capital or similar entities are excluded from the scope of
IAS 28 where those investments are designated, upon initial recognition, as at fair
value through profit or loss and are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39. Certain
investments of the Group have applied this scope exemption with changes in fair value
recognised in profit or loss in the period of change. The directors have determined that
the Group does not carry on its business through these associates.
(c)
Revenue and other income recognition 
Arrangement fees are recognized on delivery and upon completion of the transaction/
service when all obligations associated with the transaction are completed and when the
amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Agency fees and commissions are recognized when pre-agreed duties and functions of
acting as an agent has been rendered.
Project management fees are recognized on an accrual basis.
Administration / Agency Fee / Incentive fee from distressed Loans are recognized as they
crystallize according to the pre-agreed terms of contract.
Interest Income is recognized on a time-proportion basis using the effective yield basis.

Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) 
(d)
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the remaining period of the lease while all
other fixed assets are depreciated at the following rates on a straight-line basis, which is
deemed sufficient to write off their costs to their residual values over their estimated useful
lives: office equipment at 33 1/3% per annum and other fixed assets at 25% per annum.
Gain and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts
and are included in the consolidated income statement.
(e)
Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through
profit or loss and loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which
the financial assets were acquired.
a)
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
This category has two sub-categories: ‘financial assets held for trading’ and those
designated at fair value through profit and loss at inception. A financial asset is
classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short
term or if so designated by management. Derivatives are also categorised as ‘held for
trading’ unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified
as current assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized
within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
b)
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
payments that are not quoted in an active market. These are included in current
assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classified as non-current assets. Loans are classified as “Loans
Receivable” in the balance sheet.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised at trade date - the date on which the
Group commits to sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus
transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair
value and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. On initial recognition the
Group designates financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss where a
group of financial assets, financial liabilities or both is managed and its performance is
evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the Group investment strategy.

Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) 
(e)
Financial assets (Continued) 
Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments
have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership. Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are
subsequently carried at fair value.
Fair values for unquoted securities are estimated by the directors. In determining fair
valuation, the directors make use of market-based information and fair valuation models
such as discounted cash flow models. In many instances the directors also rely on financial
data of investees and on estimates provided by the management of the investee companies
as to the effect of future developments.
Performance notes are investments with income and maturity values which fluctuate based
on the distributions received from underlying assets, which are generally investments in
property development companies, defaulted loans or shipping companies. Fair values of
performance notes or other collective investment schemes are determined by the Group’s
interest in the fair values of each scheme’s underlying assets.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of all securities are recognized in the
consolidated income statement as they arise.
Although the directors use their best judgement in estimating the fair value of investments,
there are inherent limitations in any estimation techniques. Future confirming events will also
affect the estimates of fair value and the effect of such events on the estimates of fair value,
including the ultimate liquidation of investments, could be material to these consolidated
financial statements.
(f)
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, bank balances and short term bank
deposits with an original maturity of less than three months.
(g)
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings
are subsequently stated at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of
transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the
period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to
defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

(h)
Deferred taxation 
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the
consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax, if it is not accounted
for, arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or
loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted
or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the
related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in
subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary
difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.
(i)
Employee benefits 
Pension obligations
Group companies have various defined contribution pension schemes in accordance with the
local conditions and practices in the countries in which they operate. A defined contribution
plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity
(a fund) and will have no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the
fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee
services in the current and prior periods.
For defined contribution plans, the Company pays contributions to publicly or privately
administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
Once the contributions have been paid, the Company has no further payment obligations.
The regular contributions constitute net periodic costs for the year in which they are due and
as such are included in staff costs.
Bonus scheme
The Company pays out bonus to employees based on the overall corporate performance, the
department being able to achieve the annual budget and the employee’s performance and
contribution to the Company.

(j)
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered
into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the
resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated a hedging instrument,
and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as
hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for
undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at
hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of
hedged items.
(a)
Net investment hedge  
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and
qualify as net investment hedge are recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to
the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income
statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the consolidated income
statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
(b)
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair
value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
(k)
Foreign currency translation 
(a)
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are
measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity
operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are
presented in United States Dollars, which is the Company’s functional and
presentation currency.
(b) 
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains
and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation
at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are recognized in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as
qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.

Foreign currency translation (Continued)
(c) 
Group companies
The results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the
currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from
the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing
rate at the date of that balance sheet.
Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange
rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect
of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses
are translated at the dates of the transactions).
All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net
investment in foreign operations, and of borrowings and other currency instruments
designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ equity. When a
foreign operation is sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are
recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
(l)
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by
the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of
any incentives received form the lessor) are charged to the consolidated income statement
on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
(m)
Dividend distributions 
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the
Group’s financial statements in the period in which dividends are approved.
(n)
Segment reporting 
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or
services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business
segments. A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a
particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from
those of segments operating in other economic environments.

Critical accounting estimates
Estimates are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors,
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities are discussed below.
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined by
using valuation techniques. The Group uses its judgment in selecting methods and makes
assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. The Group
has used discounted cash flow analysis or other similar methodologies to value investments which
were not traded in an active market.

Financial risk management 
(a)
Financial risk factors 
The Group holds financial assets and liabilities, transacts in foreign exchange transactions
with third parties and has mismatched Yen denominated assets and liabilities. All these
operations give rise to risk exposures.
Financial instruments traded or held include cash and cash equivalents, investments, loans
and receivables and borrowings.
Forward rate agreements are used to manage the Group’s own exposures to foreign
exchange risk as part of its asset and liability management process. The principal derivative
instruments used by the Group are foreign exchange rate related contracts. Most of the
Group’s derivative positions have been entered into to hedge investments in subsidiaries.
(i)
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result
of changes in market prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to
the individual financial instrument or by factors affecting all financial instruments
traded in or indexed to a market. The Group is exposed to market risk on financial
instruments that are valued at market prices and primarily consist of investments,
loans, property development projects and marketable securities.
(ii)
Foreign exchange risk
The Group has certain investments in Japan, whose net assets are exposed to foreign
currency translation risk. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s
foreign operations is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the
relevant foreign currencies.

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a
result of changes in market interest rates and the cash flow risks associated with the
variability of cash flows from floating rate financial instruments. The Group is exposed
to interest rate risk primarily from interest rate re-pricing differences between
customers’ loans, borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and shareholders’ capital.

Financial risk management (Continued)
(iv) 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the failure of counterparties to meet the
terms of their obligations. The Group is exposed to credit risk through loans and
investments, and through counterparty default risk on transactions, including foreign
exchange transactions in the process of settlement.
(v) 
Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable
securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit
facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
(b)
Risk management
The Group’s principal risks are market risk, credit risk and foreign exchange risk. The
directors consider the interest rate risk and liquidity risk of the Group to be immaterial.
Market risk and credit risk
The Group seeks to minimise these risks by performing detailed reviews of loan
counterparties or asset issuers prior to purchase approval, and by either selling on
participated loans to other parties or entering into offsetting loans payable when the directors
wish to preserve the Group’s liquidity. The Group seeks to minimize adverse movements in
market price of financial instruments by extensive due diligence procedures to ensure
acquisitions at prices below their perceived market value.
Foreign exchange and interest rate risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from
various currency exposures in particular Japanese Yen. Foreign exchange risk arises from
future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in
foreign operations. To manage their foreign exchange risk the Group may use forward foreign
exchange contracts. Foreign exchange risk arises when the future commercial transaction or
recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s
functional currency.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, which are exposed to foreign
currency translation risk. Currency exposure arising from these investments of the Group’s
foreign operations is managed through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign
currencies.
The Group may also manage exposure to interest rate risk through the use of interest rate
swaps. These are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another. Swaps result
in an economic exchange of currencies or interest rates (for example, fixed rate for floating
rate) or a combination of all these (i.e. cross-currency interest rate swaps). No exchange of
principal takes place, except for certain currency swaps. The Group’s credit risk represents
the potential cost to replace the swap contracts if counterparties fail to perform their
obligation. This risk is monitored on an ongoing basis with reference to the current fair value,
a proportion of the notional amount of the contracts and the liquidity of the market. To
control the level of credit risk taken, the Group assesses counterparties using the same
techniques as for its lending activities.

Financial Risk Management (Continued)
Liquidity risk 
The Group will maintain sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding
through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market
positions.
(c)
Fair value estimation 
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example,
over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses a
variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at
each balance sheet date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are
used for long-term debt. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are
used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments. The fair value of interest
rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The fair
value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange
rates at the balance sheet date.
The nominal value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed
to approximate their fair values.

shares of that class, provided always that where the necessary majority for such a Special
Resolution is not obtained at such general meeting, consent in writing  if obtained from the holders
of three-fourths of the issued shares of the class concerned within two months of such general
meeting shall be as valid and effectual as a Special Resolution carried at such general meeting.
The provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall apply to every such general
meeting of the holders of one class of shares except that the necessary quorum shall be one
person holding or representing by proxy at least one-third of the issued shares of the class and that
any holder of shares of the class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll.
The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with preferred or other
rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that
class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu
therewith.
2.4
Alteration of Capital 
(a)
Subject to and in so far as permitted by the provisions of the Cayman Companies Law, the
Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution (which is defined in the Articles of
Association of the Company to be a resolution passed by a simply majority of Members
present in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the Company or approved in writing by
all the Members entitled to vote at a general meeting) alter or amend its Memorandum
otherwise than with respect to its name and objects and may, without restricting the
generality of the foregoing:
(i)
increase the share capital by such sum to be divided into shares of such amount or
without nominal or par value as the resolution shall prescribe and with such rights,
priorities and privileges annexed thereto, as the Company in general meeting may
determine;
(ii)
consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of larger amount than
its existing shares;
(iii)
by subdivision of its existing shares or any of them divide the whole or any part of its
share capital into shares of smaller amount than is fixed by the Memorandum or into
shares without nominal or par value; and
(iv)
cancel any shares which at the date of the passing of the resolution have not been
taken or agreed to be taken by any person.
APPENDIX D – SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF OUR COMPANY
D-2


(b)
All new shares created hereunder shall be subject to the same provisions with reference to
the payment of calls, lien, transfer, transmission, forfeiture and otherwise as the shares in the
original share capital.
(c)
Without prejudice to Article 14 of the Articles of Association and subject to the provisions of
the Cayman Companies Law, the Company may by Special Resolution reduce its share
capital and any capital redemption reserve fund.
2.5 
Rights, preferences and restrictions attaching to each class of shares
Subject to the provisions, if any, in that behalf in the Memorandum and to any direction that may be
given by the Company in general meeting and without prejudice to any special rights previously
conferred on the holders of existing shares, the Directors may allot, issue, grant options over or
otherwise dispose of shares of the Company (including fractions of a share) with or without
preferred, deferred or other special rights or restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting,
return of capital or otherwise and to such persons, at such times and on such other terms as they
think proper. The Company shall not issue shares in bearer form.
Subject to any special rights conferred on the holders of any shares or class of shares, any share
in the Company may be issued with or have attached thereto such preferred, deferred, qualified or
other special rights or restrictions, whether with regard to dividend, voting, return of capital or
otherwise, as the Company may be ordinary resolution determine or, if there has not been any
such determination or so far as the same shall not make specific provision, as the Board may
determine.
Except as permitted under the rules or regulations of the SGX-ST or any direction given by the
Company in general meeting, all new shares shall before issue be offered to such persons who as
at the date of the offer are entitled to receive notices from the Company of general meetings in
proportion, as far as the circumstances admit, to the amount of the existing shares to which they
are entitled. The offer shall be made by notice specifying the number of shares offered, and limiting
a time within which the offer, if not accepted, will be deemed to be declined. After the expiration of
that time, or on the receipt of an intimation from the person to whom the offer is made that he
declines to accept the shares offered or any part thereof, the Directors may dispose of those
shares in such manner as they think most beneficial to the Company. The Directors may likewise
so dispose of any new shares which (by reason of the ratio which the new shares bear to shares
held by persons entitled to an offer of new shares) cannot, in the opinion of the Directors, be
conveniently offered.
Subject to the provisions of the Cayman Companies Law and the Memorandum, shares may be
issued on the terms that they are, or at the option of the Company of the holder are, to be
redeemed on such terms and in such manner as the Company, before the issue of the shares, may
by Special Resolution determine.
Subject to the provisions of the Cayman Companies Law and the Memorandum, the Company may
purchase its own shares, including any redeemable shares, in any manner provided that such
manner of purchase has first been authorised by the Company in general meeting and may take
payment therefor in any manner authorised by the Cayman Companies Law, including out of
capital.
2.6
Time limit for lapse of dividend entitlement
There is no time limit imposed under the Articles of Association of the Company for lapse of
dividend entitlements of Shareholders.
2.7
Restrictions on ownership of shares
There are no limitations on the right to own shares.
APPENDIX D – SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF OUR COMPANY
D-3


1.
Introduction 
The Cayman Companies Law is derived, to a large extent, from the older Companies Acts of
England, although there are significant differences between the Cayman Companies Law and the
current Companies Act of England. Set out below is a summary of certain provisions of the
Cayman Companies Law, although this does not purport to contain all applicable qualifications and
exceptions or to be a complete review of all matters of corporate law and taxation which may differ
from equivalent provisions in jurisdictions with which interested parties may be more familiar.
2.
Incorporation 
The Company was incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited
liability on 17 March 1997 under the Cayman Companies Law (1995 Revision). As such, its
operations must be conducted mainly outside the Cayman Islands. The Company is required to file
an annual return each year with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands and pay a fee
which is based on the size of its authorised share capital.
3.
Share capital 
The Cayman Companies Law permits a company to issue ordinary shares, preference shares,
redeemable shares or any combination thereof. Investors should note that the position under
Cayman Companies Law is different from that under Singapore law, which provides that shares of
a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands shall have a par value.
The Cayman Companies Law provides that where a company issues shares at a premium,
whether for cash or otherwise, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of the value of the premia on
those shares shall be transferred to an account called the “share premium account”. At the option
of a company, these provisions may not apply to premia on shares of that company allotted
pursuant to any arrangement in consideration of the acquisition or cancellation of shares in any
other company and issued at a premium. The Cayman Companies Law provides that the share
premium account may be applied by a company, subject to the provisions, if any, of its
memorandum and articles of association, in such manner as the company may from time to time
determine including, but without limitation:
(a)
paying distributions or dividends to members;
(b) 
paying up unissued shares of the company to be issued to members as fully paid bonus
shares;
(c) 
in the redemption and repurchase of shares (subject to the provisions of section 37 of the
Cayman Companies Law);
(d) 
writing-off the preliminary expenses of the company;
(e)
writing-off the expenses of, or the commission paid or discount allowed on, any issue of
shares or debentures of the company; and 
(f) 
providing for the premium payable on redemption or purchase of any shares or debentures
of the company.
No distribution or dividend may be paid to members out of the share premium account unless
immediately following the date on which the distribution or dividend is proposed to be paid the
company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business.
The Cayman Companies Law provides that, subject to confirmation by the Grand Court of the
Cayman Islands, a company limited by shares or a company limited by guarantee and having a
share capital may, if so authorised by its articles of association, by special resolution reduce its
share capital in any way.
APPENDIX E – SUMMARY OF CAYMAN ISLANDS COMPANY LAW
E-1


Subject to the detailed provisions of the Cayman Companies Law, a company limited by shares or
a company limited by guarantee and having a share capital may, if so authorised by its articles of
association, issue shares which are to be redeemed or are liable to be redeemed at the option of
the company or a shareholder. In addition, such a company may, if authorised to do so by its
articles of association, purchase its own shares, including any redeemable shares. However, if the
articles of association do not authorise the manner of purchase, a company cannot purchase any
of its own shares unless the manner of purchase has first been authorised by an ordinary
resolution of the company. At no time may a company redeem or purchase its shares unless they
are fully paid. A company may not redeem or purchase any of its shares if, as a result of the
redemption or purchase, there would no longer be any member of the company holding shares. A
payment out of capital by a company for the redemption or purchase of its own shares is not lawful
unless immediately following the date on which the payment is proposed to be made, the company
shall be able to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business.
There is no statutory restriction in the Cayman Islands on the provision of financial assistance by a
company for the purchase of, or subscription for, its own or its holding company’s shares.
Accordingly, a company may provide financial assistance if the directors of the company consider,
in discharging their duties of care and to act in good faith, for a proper purpose and in the interests
of the company, that such assistance can properly be given. Such assistance should be on an
arm’s-length basis.
Investors should note that the position under Cayman Companies Law is different from that under
Singapore law, which provides statutory restrictions against a company giving financial assistance
to any person directly or indirectly for the purpose of, or in connection with, the acquisition of that
company’s shares or shares of its holding company. Financial assistance includes the making of a
loan, the giving of a guarantee, the provision of security, and the release of a debt or obligation.
4.
Dividends and distributions 
With the exception of section 34 of the Cayman Companies Law, there are no statutory provisions
relating to the payment of dividends. Based upon English case law which is likely to be persuasive
in the Cayman Islands in this area, dividends may be paid only out of profits. In addition, section 34
of the Cayman Companies Law permits, subject to a solvency test and the provisions, if any, of the
company’s memorandum and articles of association, the payment of dividends and distributions out
of the share premium account (see paragraph 3 above for further details).
5.
Shareholders’ suits 
The Cayman Islands courts can be expected to follow English case law precedents. The rule in
Foss v. Harbottle (and the exceptions thereto which permit a minority shareholder to commence a
class action against or derivative actions in the name of the company to challenge (a) an act which
is ultra vires the company or illegal, (b) an act which constitutes a fraud against the minority where
the wrongdoers are themselves in control of the company, and (c) an action which requires a
resolution with a qualified (or special) majority which has not been obtained) has been applied and
followed by the courts in the Cayman Islands.
6.
Protection of minorities
In the case of a company (not being a bank) having a share capital divided into shares, the Grand
Court of the Cayman Islands may, on the application of members holding not less than one fifth of
the shares of the company in issue, appoint an inspector to examine into the affairs of the company
and to report thereon in such manner as the Grand Court shall direct.
Any shareholder of a company may petition the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands which may
make a winding up order if the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable that the company
should be wound up.
APPENDIX E – SUMMARY OF CAYMAN ISLANDS COMPANY LAW
E-2


Claims against a company by its shareholders must, as a general rule, be based on the general
laws of contract or tort applicable in the Cayman Islands or their individual rights as shareholders
as established by the company’s memorandum and articles of association.
The English common law rule that the majority will not be permitted to commit a fraud on the
minority has been applied and followed by the courts of the Cayman Islands.
Investors should note that the position under Cayman Companies Law is different from that under
Singapore law, which provides that the rights of minority shareholders are entrenched in the
Companies Act, which provides that shareholders may apply to the Singapore courts for an order
to remedy situations where (i) a company’s affairs are being conducted or the powers of the
company’s directors are being exercised in a manner oppressive to, or in disregard of the interests
of one or more of the company’s shareholders as shareholders of the company; or (ii) a company
has done an act, or threatens to do an act, or the members or holders of debentures have passed
or propose to pass some resolution, which unfairly discriminates against, or is otherwise prejudicial
to, one or more of the company’s shareholders.
7.
Disposal of assets
The Cayman Companies Law contains no specific restrictions on the powers of directors to
dispose of assets of a company. As a matter of general law, in the exercise of those powers, the
directors must discharge their duties of care and to act in good faith, for a proper purpose and in
the interests of the company.
Investors should note that the position under Cayman Companies Law is different from that under
Singapore law, which provides that prior approval of the company at a general meeting is required
before the directors can carry into effect any proposals for disposing of the whole or substantially
the whole of the company’s undertaking or property, notwithstanding anything in a company’s
memorandum or articles of association.
8.
Accounting and auditing requirements
The Cayman Companies Law requires that a company shall cause to be kept proper books of
account with respect to:
(a)
all sums of money received and expended by the company and the matters in respect of
which the receipt and expenditure takes place;
(b) 
all sales and purchases of goods by the company; and 
(c) 
the assets and liabilities of the company.
Proper books of account shall not be deemed to be kept if there are not kept such books as are
necessary to give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs and to explain its
transactions.
9.
Register of members 
An exempted company may, subject to the provisions of its articles of association, maintain its
principal register of members and any branch registers at such locations, whether within or without
the Cayman Islands, as its directors may, from time to time, think fit. There is no requirement under
the Cayman Companies Law for an exempted company to make any returns of members to the
Registrar of Companies in the Cayman Islands. The names and addresses of the members are,
accordingly, not a matter of public record and are not available for public inspection.
APPENDIX E – SUMMARY OF CAYMAN ISLANDS COMPANY LAW
E-3


10.
Inspection of books and records 
Members of a company will have no general right under the Cayman Companies Law to inspect or
obtain copies of the register of members or corporate records of the company. They will, however,
have such rights as may be set out in the company’s articles of association.
11.
Special resolutions 
The Cayman Companies Law provides that a resolution is a special resolution when it has been
passed by a majority of not less than two-thirds (or such greater number as may be specified in the
articles of association of the company) of such members as, being entitled to do so, vote in person
or, where proxies are allowed, by proxy at a general meeting of which notice specifying the
intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been duly given. Written resolutions
signed by all the members entitled to vote for the time being of the company may take effect as
special resolutions if this is authorised by the articles of association of the company.
Investors should note that the position under Cayman Companies Law is different from that under
Singapore law, which provides that a special resolution must be passed by at least three-fourths of
members voting (in person or by proxy) at a general meeting of which not less than 21 days’
written notice has been duly given.
12.
Subsidiary owning shares in parent 
The Cayman Companies Law does not prohibit a Cayman Islands company acquiring and holding
shares in its parent company provided its objects so permit. The directors of any subsidiary making
such acquisition must discharge their duties of care and to act in good faith, for a proper purpose
and in the interests of the subsidiary.
Investors should note that the position under Cayman Companies Law is different from that under
Singapore law, which prohibits a company from being a member of a company which is its holding
company, and any allotment or transfer of shares in a company to its subsidiary is deemed to be
void.
13.
Reconstructions 
There are statutory provisions which facilitate reconstructions and amalgamations approved by a
majority in number representing 75 per cent. in value of shareholders or creditors, depending on
the circumstances, as are present at a meeting called for such purpose and thereafter sanctioned
by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. Whilst a dissenting shareholder would have the right to
express to the Grand Court his view that the transaction for which approval is sought would not
provide the shareholders with a fair value for their shares, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands
is unlikely to disapprove the transaction on that ground alone in the absence of evidence of fraud
or bad faith on behalf of management and if the transaction were approved and consummated the
dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to the appraisal rights (i.e. the right to
receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of his shares) ordinarily available, for
example, to dissenting shareholders of United States corporations.
14.
Take-overs 
Where an offer is made by a company for the shares of another company and, within four months
of the offer, the holders of not less than 90 per cent. of the shares which are the subject of the offer
accept, the offeror may at any time within two months after the expiration of the said four months,
by notice require the dissenting shareholders to transfer their shares on the terms of the offer. A
dissenting shareholder may apply to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands within one month of
the notice objecting to the transfer. The burden is on the dissenting shareholder to show that the
Grand Court should exercise its discretion, which it will be unlikely to do unless there is evidence of
fraud or bad faith or collusion as between the offeror and the holders of the shares who have
accepted the offer as a means of unfairly forcing out minority shareholders.
APPENDIX E – SUMMARY OF CAYMAN ISLANDS COMPANY LAW
E-4


15.
Indemnification 
Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may
provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be
held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy (e.g. for purporting to provide
indemnification against the consequences of committing a crime).
16.
Liquidation 
A company is placed in liquidation either by an order of the court or by a special resolution (or, in
certain circumstances, an ordinary resolution) of its members. A liquidator is appointed whose
duties are to collect the assets of the company (including the amount (if any) due from the
contributories (shareholders)), settle the list of creditors and discharge the company’s liability to
them, rateably if insufficient assets exist to discharge the liabilities in full, and to settle the list of
contributories and divide the surplus assets (if any) amongst them in accordance with the rights
attaching to the shares.
17.
Stamp duty on transfers 
No stamp duty is payable in the Cayman Islands on transfers of shares of Cayman Islands
companies except those which hold interests in land in the Cayman Islands.
18.
Exchange control
There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands.

OBJECTIVES OF THE SCHEME
The Scheme is a share incentive plan. The Scheme is proposed on the basis that it is important to
retain staff whose contributions are essential to the well-being and prosperity of the Group and to
give recognition to outstanding Employees and Non-Executive Directors who have contributed to
the growth of the Group. The Scheme will give Participants an opportunity to have a personal
equity interest in the Company at no direct cost to its profitability and will help to achieve the
following positive objectives:
(a)
to motivate each Participant to optimise his performance standards and efficiency and to
maintain a high level of contribution to the Group;
(b)
to retain key employees and Directors of the Group whose contributions are essential to the
long-term growth and profitability of the Group;
(c)
to instil loyalty to, and a stronger identification by the Participants with the long-term
prosperity of, the Company;
(d)
to attract potential employees with relevant skills to contribute to the Group and to create
value for the Shareholders of the Company; and
(e)
to align the interests of the Participants with the interests of the Shareholders.

implemented by other companies, if approved by the Committee.

Subject to Rule 4 and Rule 11, the aggregate number of Shares in respect of which Options may
be offered to a Grantee for subscription in accordance with the Scheme shall be determined at the
discretion of the Committee, which would be exercised judiciously, who shall take into account
criteria such as the rank within the Group, performance, years of service and potential for future
development of the Grantee.

Subject as provided in Rule 11, the Committee may grant Options at any time during the period
when the Scheme is in force, except that no Options may be offered and/or granted during the
period of 30 days immediately preceding the date the Company announces its interim and/or final
results (whichever the case may be). In the event that an announcement on any matter of an
exceptional nature involving unpublished price sensitive information is made, Options may only be

than to a Participant’s personal representative on the death of that Participant), charged, assigned,
pledged or otherwise disposed of, in whole or in part, except with the prior approval of the
Committee.
6.4
The grant of an Option under this Rule 6 shall be accepted by the Grantee within thirty (30) days

the making of offers and grants of Options under the Scheme at a discount not
exceeding the maximum discount as aforesaid.

TAKE-OVER AND WINDING-UP OF THE COMPANY
9.1
Notwithstanding Rule 8 but subject to Rule 9.5, in the event of a take-over being made for the
Shares, a Participant shall be entitled to exercise any Option held by him and as yet unexercised,
in respect of such number of Shares comprised in that Option as may be determined by the
Committee in its absolute discretion, in the period commencing on the date on which such offer is
made or, if such offer is conditional, the date on which such offer becomes or is declared
unconditional, as the case may be, and ending on the earlier of:
(a)
the expiry of six (6) months thereafter, unless prior to the expiry of such six-month period, at
the recommendation of the officer and with the approvals of the Committee and the Stock
Exchange, such expiry date is extended to a later date (in either case, being a date falling
not later than the expiry of the Exercise Period relating thereto); or
(b)
the date of expiry of the Exercise Period relating thereto, 
whereupon the Option then remaining unexercised shall lapse.
Provided that if during such period, the offeror becomes entitled or bound to exercise rights of
compulsory acquisition under the provisions of the Act and, being entitled to do so, gives notice to
the Participants that it intends to exercise such rights on a specified date, the Option shall remain
exercisable by the Participant until the expiry of such specified date or the expiry of the Exercise
Period relating thereto, whichever is earlier. Any Option not so exercised shall lapse provided that
the rights of acquisition or obligations to acquire shall have been exercised or performed, as the
case may be. If such rights or obligations have not been exercised or performed, the Option shall,
notwithstanding Rule 8, remain exercisable until the expiry of the Exercise Period relating thereto.
APPENDIX F – RULES OF THE UNI-ASIA SHARE OPTION SCHEME
F-7


9.2
If under any applicable laws, the court sanctions a compromise or arrangement proposed for the
purposes of, or in connection with, a scheme for the reconstruction of the Company or its
amalgamation with another company or companies, each Participant shall be entitled,
notwithstanding Rule 8 but subject to Rule 9.5, to exercise any Option then held by him, in respect
of such number of Shares comprised in that Option as may be determined by the Committee in its
absolute discretion, during the period commencing on the date upon which the compromise or
arrangement is sanctioned by the court and ending either on the expiry of 60 days thereafter or the
date upon which the compromise or arrangement becomes effective, whichever is later (but not
after the expiry of the Exercise Period relating thereto), whereupon the Option shall lapse and
become null and void.
9.3
If an order is made for the winding-up of the Company on the basis of its insolvency, all Options, to
the extent unexercised, shall lapse and become null and void.
9.4
In the event a notice is given by the Company to its members to convene a general meeting for the
purposes of considering and, if thought fit, approving a resolution to voluntarily wind-up the
Company, the Company shall on the same date as or soon after it dispatches such notice to each
member of the Company give notice thereof to all Participants (together with a notice of the
existence of the provision of this Rule 9.4) and thereupon, each Participant (or his personal
representative) shall be entitled to exercise all or any of his Options at any time not later than two
(2) Business Days prior to the proposed general meeting of the Company by giving notice in writing
to the Company, accompanied by a remittance for the Aggregate Subscription Cost whereupon the
Company shall as soon as possible and in any event, no later than the Business Day immediately
prior to the date of the proposed general meeting referred to above, allot the relevant Shares to the
Participant credited as fully paid.
9.5
If in connection with the making of a general offer referred to in Rule 9.1 or the scheme referred to
in Rule 9.2 or the winding-up referred to in Rule 9.4, arrangements are made (which are confirmed
in writing by the Auditors, acting only as experts and not as arbitrators, to be fair and reasonable)
for the compensation of Participants, whether by the continuation of their Options or the payment of
cash or the grant of other options or otherwise, a Participant holding an Option, as yet not
exercised, may not, at the discretion of the Committee, be permitted to exercise that Option as
provided for in this Rule 9.
9.6
To the extent that an Option is not exercised within the periods referred to in this Rule 9, it shall
lapse and become null and void.

EXERCISE OF OPTIONS, ALLOTMENT AND LISTING OF SHARES

Subject to Rules 8.1, an Option may be exercised, in whole or in part, by a Participant giving notice
in writing to the Company in or substantially in the form set out in Schedule C, subject to such
modification as the Committee may from time to time determine.
Such notice must be
accompanied by payment in cash for the Aggregate Subscription Cost in respect of the Shares for
which that Option is exercised and any other documentation the Committee may require. An
Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company of the said notice, duly
completed, and the Aggregate Subscription Cost. All payments made shall be made by cheque,
cashiers’ order, banker’s draft or postal order made out in favour of the Company or such other
mode of payment as may be acceptable to the Company.
10.2
Subject to such consents or other required action of any competent authority under any regulations
or enactment for the time being in force as may be necessary and subject to the compliance with
the terms of the Scheme and the Memorandum of Association and Articles of the Company, the
Company shall, within ten (10) Market Days after the exercise of an Option, allot the relevant
Shares and despatch to CDP the relevant share certificates by ordinary post or such other mode
as the Committee may deem fit.
The Company shall, as soon as practicable after such allotment, apply to the Stock Exchange for
permission to deal in and for quotation of such Shares, if necessary.
APPENDIX F – RULES OF THE UNI-ASIA SHARE OPTION SCHEME
F-8


10.3
Shares which are allotted on the exercise of an Option by a Participant shall be issued in the name
of CDP to the credit of the securities account of that Participant maintained with CDP
, the securities
sub-account of that Participant maintained with a Depository Agent or (where applicable) the CPF
investment account maintained with a CPF agent bank.
10.4
Shares allotted and issued on exercise of an Option shall:
(a)
be subject to all the provisions of the Memorandum of Association and Articles of the
Company; and
(b)
rank in full for all entitlements, including dividends or other distributions declared or
recommended in respect of the then existing Shares, the Record Date for which is on or
after the relevant date upon which such exercise occurred, and shall in all other respects
rank pari passu with other existing Shares then in issue.
“Record Date” means the date fixed by the Company for the purposes of determining entitlements
to dividends or other distributions to or rights of holders of Shares.
10.5
The Company shall keep available sufficient unissued Shares to satisfy the full exercise of all
Options for the time being remaining capable of being exercised.
11.
LIMITATION ON THE SIZE OF THE SCHEME
The aggregate nominal amount of new Shares over which the Committee may grant Options on
any date, when added to the nominal amount of new Shares issued and issuable in respect of (a)
all Options granted under the Scheme, and (b) all awards granted under any other share option,
share incentive, performance share or restricted share plan implemented by the Company and for
the time being in force, shall not exceed fifteen (15) per cent. of the issued share capital of the
Company on the day preceding that date.
12.
ADJUSTMENT EVENTS 
12.1
If a variation in the issued ordinary share capital of the Company (whether by way of a
capitalisation of profits or reserves or rights issue, reduction, subdivision, consolidation, distribution
or otherwise) shall take place, then:
(a)
the Exercise Price of the Shares, the nominal amount, class and/or number of Shares
comprised in an Option to the extent unexercised; and/or
(b)
the nominal amount, class and/or number of Shares over which Options may be granted
under the Scheme,
shall be adjusted in such manner as the Committee may determine to be appropriate.
12.2
Unless the Committee considers an adjustment to be appropriate, the following (whether singly or
in combination) shall not be regarded as events requiring adjustment:
(a)
any issue of securities as consideration for an acquisition or a private placement of securities
or pursuant to any initial public offering of the Shares on the SGX-ST;
(b)
any increase in the number of issued Shares as a consequence of the exercise of options or
other convertibles issued from time to time by the Company entitling the holders thereof to
acquire new Shares in the capital of the Company (including the exercise of any Options
granted pursuant to the Scheme and any previous or future employee share option
scheme(s));
APPENDIX F – RULES OF THE UNI-ASIA SHARE OPTION SCHEME
F-9


(c)
any issue of Shares pursuant to any scrip dividend scheme for the time being of the
Company; and

Shares purchased by the Company by way of market purchase(s) effected on the SGX-ST
on which the Company is listed pursuant to a share purchase mandate (or any renewal
thereof) given by the Shareholders of the Company in general meeting and for the time
being in force.
12.3
Notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 12.1:
(a)
no such adjustment shall be made if as a result:
(i)
the Exercise Price shall fall below the nominal amount of a Share and if such
adjustment would, but for this paragraph (a), result in the Exercise Price being less
than the nominal amount of a Share, the Exercise Price payable shall be the nominal
amount of a Share; or
(ii)
the Participant receives a benefit that a Shareholder does not receive; and
(b)
any adjustment (except in relation to a capitalisation issue) must be confirmed in writing by
the Auditors (acting only as experts and not as arbitrators) to be in their opinion, fair and
reasonable.
12.4
Upon any adjustment required to be made pursuant to this Rule 12, the Company shall notify the
Participant (or his duly appointed personal representatives where applicable) in writing and deliver
to him (or his duly appointed personal representatives where applicable) a statement setting forth
the Exercise Price thereafter in effect and the nominal value, class and/or number of Shares
thereafter to be issued on the exercise of the Option. Any adjustment shall take effect upon such
written notification being given.

This right applies to applications made by way of Application Forms and by way of Electronic

desirability of allotting the New Shares to a reasonable number of applicants with a view to
establishing an adequate market for the Shares.

monies received and is not an acknowledgement by our Company. You irrevocably authorise CDP
to complete and sign on your behalf as transferee or renounce any instrument of transfer and/or
other documents required for the issue or transfer of the New Shares allotted to you. This
authorisation applies to applications made by way of printed Application Forms, or such other

The procedures for Electronic Applications are set out on the ATM screens (in the case of ATM Electronic
Applications) and in the case of Internet Electronic Applications on the IB website screens of the relevant
Participating Banks and the website screen of DBS Vickers Online (the “Steps”). Currently, DBS Bank and
UOB Group are the only Participating Banks through which the Internet Electronic Applications through
the IB websites may be made.
For illustration purposes, the procedures for Electronic Applications through ATMs, the IB website of DBS
Bank and the website of DBS Vickers Online are set out in the paragraphs “Steps for ATM Electronic
Applications for Offer Shares through ATMs of DBS Bank (including POSB ATMs)” and the “Steps
for Internet Electronic Applications for Offer Shares through the IB website of DBS Bank” and the
“Steps for Internet Electronic Applications for Placement Shares through the website of DBS
Vickers Online” appearing on pages G-16 to G-20 of this Prospectus.
Please read carefully the terms of this Prospectus, the Steps and the terms and conditions for Electronic
Applications set out below before making an Electronic Application. Any reference to “you” or the
“Applicant” in the “Additional Terms and Conditions for Electronic Applications”, and the Steps shall refer
to you making an application for Offer Shares through an ATM or the IB website of a relevant Participating
Bank, or an application for Internet Placement Shares through the website of DBS Vickers Online.
The Steps set out the actions that you must take at ATMs or the IB website of DBS Bank or the website
of DBS Vickers Online to complete an Electronic Application. The actions that you must take at the ATMs
or the IB websites of the other Participating Banks are set out on the ATM screens or the IB website
screens of the relevant Participating Banks.
You must have an existing bank account with and be an ATM cardholder of the relevant Participating
Banks before you can make an Electronic Application at the ATMs of the relevant Participating Banks. An
ATM card issued by one Participating Bank cannot be used to apply for the Offer Shares at an ATM

transaction, you will receive an ATM transaction slip (“Transaction Record”), confirming the details of your
ATM Electronic Application. The Transaction Record is for your retention and should not be submitted with

Securities Account number, your application will be rejected. If you operate a joint bank account
with any of the Participating Banks, you must ensure that you enter your own Securities Account
number when using the ATM card issued to you in your own name. Using your own Securities
Account number with an ATM card which is not issued to you in your own name will render your
Electronic Application liable to be rejected.
For an Internet Electronic Application, you must have a bank account with and/or a User Identification
(“User ID”) and a Personal Identification Number (“PIN”) given by the relevant participating Banks or DBS
Vickers Online, in the case of you applying for Internet Placement Shares through the website of DBS

there will be an on-screen confirmation (“Confirmation Screen”) of the application which can be printed
