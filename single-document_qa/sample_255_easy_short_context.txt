Noting the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including in forests, 
the ocean, mountains and the cryosphere, and the protection of biodiversity, recognized by 
some cultures as Mother Earth, and also noting the importance of ‘climate justice’, when 
taking action to address climate change, 
 
Underlining the urgent need to address, in a comprehensive and synergetic manner, 
the interlinked global crises of climate change and biodiversity loss in the broader context of 
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as the vital importance of protecting, 
conserving, restoring and sustainably using nature and ecosystems for effective and 
sustainable climate action, 
I. Context and cross-cutting considerations 
1. 
Welcomes that the Paris Agreement has driven near-universal climate action by setting 
goals and sending signals to the world regarding the urgency of responding to the climate 
crisis; 
2. 
Underlines that, despite overall progress on mitigation, adaptation and means of 
implementation and support, Parties are not yet collectively on track towards achieving the 
purpose of the Paris Agreement and its long-term goals;  
 
3. 
Reaffirms the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global 
average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to 
limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this 
would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change;  
4. 
Underscores that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the temperature 
increase of 1.5 °C compared with 2 °C and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature 
increase to 1.5 °C;  
5. 
Expresses serious concern that 2023 is set to be the warmest year on record and that 
impacts from climate change are rapidly accelerating, and emphasizes the need for urgent 
action and support to keep the 1.5 °C goal within reach and to address the climate crisis in 
this critical decade; 
6. 
Commits to accelerate action in this critical decade on the basis of the best available 
science, reflecting equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and 
respective capabilities in the light of different national circumstances and in the context of 
sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty; 
7. 
Underscores Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement, which stipulates that the 
Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but 
differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national 
circumstances; 
8. 
Emphasizes that finance, capacity-building and technology transfer are critical 
enablers of climate action; 
9. 
Reaffirms that sustainable and just solutions to the climate crisis must be founded on 
meaningful and effective social dialogue and participation of all stakeholders, including 
Indigenous Peoples, local communities and governments, women, and youth and children, 
and notes that the global transition to low emissions and climate-resilient development 
provides opportunities and challenges for sustainable development and poverty eradication;  
10. 
Underlines that just transitions can support more robust and equitable mitigation 
outcomes, with tailored approaches addressing different contexts;

11. 
Recognizes the specific needs and special circumstances of developing country 
Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate 
change, as provided for in the Convention and the Paris Agreement;  
12. 
Welcomes the conclusion of the first global stocktake and expresses appreciation and 
gratitude to those involved in the technical dialogue thereunder, and to the co-facilitators for 
preparing the synthesis report1 and other outputs of the technical assessment component; 
13. 
Welcomes the high-level events convened under the first global stocktake and takes 
note of the summary thereof; 
14. 
Welcomes the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change and expresses appreciation and gratitude to those involved in preparing the reports 
in the sixth assessment cycle for their excellent work and dedication to continuing their work 
during the extraordinary circumstances of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic;  
15. 
Notes with alarm and serious concern the following findings of the Sixth Assessment 
Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change:  
(a) 
That human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, 
have unequivocally caused global warming of about 1.1 °C;  
(b) 
That human-caused climate change impacts are already being felt in every 
region across the globe, with those who have contributed the least to climate change being 
most vulnerable to the impacts, and, together with losses and damages, will increase with 
every increment of warming; 
(c) 
That most observed adaptation responses are fragmented, incremental, sector-
specific and unequally distributed across regions, and that, despite the progress made, 
significant adaptation gaps still exist across sectors and regions and will continue to grow 
under current levels of implementation; 
16. 
Notes the following findings of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change:  
(d) 
That mitigation efforts embedded within the wider development context can 
increase the pace, depth and breadth of emissions reductions, as well as that policies that shift 
development pathways towards sustainability can broaden the portfolio of available 
mitigation responses and enable the pursuit of synergies with development objectives; 
(e) 
That both adaptation and mitigation financing would need to increase 
manyfold, and that there is sufficient global capital to close the global investment gap but 
there are barriers to redirecting capital to climate action, and that Governments through public 
funding and clear signals to investors are key in reducing these barriers and investors, central 
banks and financial regulators can also play their part; 
(f) 
That feasible, effective and low-cost mitigation options are already available 
in all sectors to keep 1.5 °C within reach in this critical decade with the necessary cooperation 
on technologies and support; 
17. 
Notes with concern the pre-2020 gaps in both mitigation ambition and implementation 
by developed country Parties and that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had 
earlier indicated that developed countries must reduce emissions by 25–40 per cent below 
1990 levels by 2020, which was not achieved;

II. Collective progress towards achieving the purpose and long-
term goals of the Paris Agreement, including under Article 2, 
paragraph 1(a–c), in the light of equity and the best available 
science, and informing Parties in updating and enhancing, in 
a nationally determined manner, action and support 
A. 
Mitigation 
18. 
Acknowledges that significant collective progress towards the Paris Agreement 
temperature goal has been made, from an expected global temperature increase of 4 °C 
according to some projections prior to the adoption of the Agreement to an increase in the 
range of 2.1–2.8 °C with the full implementation of the latest nationally determined 
contributions;  
19. 
Expresses appreciation that all Parties have communicated nationally determined 
contributions that demonstrate progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement temperature 
goal, most of which provided the information necessary to facilitate their clarity, transparency 
and understanding;  
20. 
Commends the 68 Parties that have communicated long-term low greenhouse gas 
emission development strategies and notes that 87 per cent of the global economy in terms 
of share of gross domestic product is covered by targets for climate neutrality, carbon 
neutrality, greenhouse gas neutrality or net zero emissions, which provides the possibility of 
achieving a temperature increase below 2 °C when taking into account the full 
implementation of those strategies;  
21. 
Notes with concern the findings in the latest version of the synthesis report on 
nationally determined contributions that implementation of current nationally determined 
contributions would reduce emissions on average by 2 per cent compared with the 2019 level 
by 2030 and that significantly greater emission reductions are required to align with global 
greenhouse gas emission trajectories in line with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement 
and recognizes the urgent need to address this gap;  
22. 
Notes the findings in the synthesis report on nationally determined contributions that 
greenhouse gas emission levels in 2030 are projected to be 5.3 per cent lower than in 2019 if 
all nationally determined contributions, including all conditional elements, are fully 
implemented and that enhanced financial resources, technology transfer and technical 
cooperation, and capacity-building support are needed to achieve this; 
23. 
Notes with concern the findings of the Sixth Assessment Report of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that policies implemented by the end of 2020 
are projected to result in higher global greenhouse gas emissions than those implied by the 
nationally determined contributions, indicating an implementation gap, and resolves to take 
action to urgently address this gap; 
24. 
Notes with significant concern that, despite progress, global greenhouse gas emissions 
trajectories are not yet in line with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, and that there 
is a rapidly narrowing window for raising ambition and implementing existing commitments 
in order to achieve it;  
25. 
Expresses concern that the carbon budget consistent with achieving the Paris 
Agreement temperature goal is now small and being rapidly depleted and acknowledges that 
historical cumulative net carbon dioxide emissions already account for about four fifths of 
the total carbon budget for a 50 per cent probability of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C;  


Advance unedited version

26. 
Recognizes the finding in the Synthesis Report of the Sixth Assessment Report of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,2 based on global modelled pathways and 
assumptions, that global greenhouse gas emissions are projected to peak between 2020 and 
at the latest before 2025 in global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5 °C with no 
or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to 2 °C and assume immediate action, 
and notes that this does not imply peaking in all countries within this time frame, and that 
time frames for peaking may be shaped by sustainable development, poverty eradication 
needs and equity and be in line with different national circumstances, and recognizes that 
technology development and transfer on voluntary and mutually agreed terms, as well as 
capacity-building and financing, can support countries in this regard; 
27. 
Also recognizes that limiting global warming to 1.5 °C with no or limited overshoot 
requires deep, rapid and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions of 43 per 
cent by 2030 and 60 per cent by 2035 relative to the 2019 level and reaching net zero carbon 
dioxide emissions by 2050; 
28. 
Further recognizes the need for deep, rapid and sustained reductions in greenhouse 
gas emissions in line with 1.5 °C pathways and calls on Parties to contribute to the following 
global efforts, in a nationally determined manner, taking into account the Paris Agreement 
and their different national circumstances, pathways and approaches:  
(a) 
Tripling renewable energy capacity globally and doubling the global average 
annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030; 
(b) 
Accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power;  
(c) 
Accelerating efforts globally towards net zero emission energy systems, 
utilizing zero- and low-carbon fuels well before or by around mid-century; 
(d) 
Transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and 
equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050 
in keeping with the science; 
(e) 
Accelerating zero- and low-emission technologies, including, inter alia, 
renewables, nuclear, abatement and removal technologies such as carbon capture and 
utilization and storage, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors, and low-carbon hydrogen 
production; 
(f) 
Accelerating and substantially reducing non-carbon-dioxide emissions 
globally, including in particular methane emissions by 2030; 
(g) 
Accelerating the reduction of emissions from road transport on a range of 
pathways, including through development of infrastructure and rapid deployment of zero-
and low-emission vehicles; 
(h) 
Phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that do not address energy poverty 
or just transitions, as soon as possible; 
29. 
Recognizes that transitional fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy transition 
while ensuring energy security; 
30. 
Welcomes that over the past decade mitigation technologies have become increasingly 
available, and that the unit costs of several low-emission technologies have fallen 
continuously, notably wind power and solar power and storage, thanks to technological

processes, while recognizing the need to increase the affordability and accessibility of such 
technologies;  
31. 
Emphasizes the urgent need for accelerated implementation of domestic mitigation 
measures in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement, as well as the 
use of voluntary cooperation, referred to in Article 6, paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement;  
32. 
Also emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen integrated, holistic and balanced non-
market approaches in accordance with Article 6, paragraph 8, of the Paris Agreement, in the 
context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, in a coordinated and effective 
manner, including through mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity-
building, as appropriate; 
33. 
Further emphasizes the importance of conserving, protecting and restoring nature and 
ecosystems towards achieving the Paris Agreement temperature goal, including through 
enhanced efforts towards halting and reversing deforestation and forest degradation by 2030, 
and other terrestrial and marine ecosystems acting as sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases 
and by conserving biodiversity, while ensuring social and environmental safeguards, in line 
with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework; 
34. 
Notes the need for enhanced support and investment, including through financial 
resources, technology transfer and capacity-building, for efforts towards halting and 
reversing deforestation and forest degradation by 2030 in the context of sustainable 
development and poverty eradication, in accordance with Article 5 of the Paris Agreement, 
including through results-based payments for policy approaches and positive incentives for 
activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the 
role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon 
stocks in developing countries; and alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation 
and adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, while 
reaffirming the importance of incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated 
with such approaches; 
35. 
Invites Parties to preserve and restore oceans and coastal ecosystems and scale up, as 
appropriate, ocean-based mitigation action; 
36. 
Notes the importance of transitioning to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns 
of consumption and production in efforts to address climate change, including through 
circular economy approaches, and encourages efforts in this regard;  
37. 
Recalls Article 3 and Article 4, paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 11, of the Paris Agreement and 
requests Parties that have not yet done so to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their 
nationally determined contributions as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement 
temperature goal by the end of 2024, taking into account different national circumstances;  
38. 
Recalls Article 4, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement, which provides that developed 
country Parties should continue taking the lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute 
emission reduction targets, and that developing country Parties should continue enhancing 
their mitigation efforts and are encouraged to move over time towards economy-wide 
emission reduction or limitation targets in the light of different national circumstances; 
39. 
Reaffirms the nationally determined nature of nationally determined contributions and 
Article 4, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement and encourages Parties to come forward in 
their next nationally determined contributions with ambitious, economy-wide emission 
reduction targets, covering all greenhouse gases, sectors and categories and aligned with 
limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, as informed by the latest science, in the light of different 
national circumstances;

Notes the importance of aligning nationally determined contributions with long-term 
low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, and encourages Parties to align their 
next nationally determined contributions with long-term low greenhouse gas emission 
development strategies; 
41. 
Notes the capacity challenges of the least developed countries and small island 
developing States related to preparing and communicating nationally determined 
contributions; 
42. 
Urges Parties that have not yet done so and invites all other Parties to communicate 
or revise, by the sixth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Paris Agreement (November 2024), their long-term low greenhouse gas 
emission development strategies referred to in Article 4, paragraph 19, of the Paris Agreement 
towards just transitions to net zero emissions by or around mid-century, taking into account 
different national circumstances; 
B. 
Adaptation 
43. 
Emphasizes the importance of the global goal on adaptation of enhancing adaptive 
capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change with a view 
to contributing to sustainable development and ensuring an adequate adaptation response in 
the context of the temperature goal referred to in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement; 
44. 
Recognizes the increasing adaptation planning and implementation efforts being 
undertaken by Parties towards enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and 
reducing vulnerability, as set out in national adaptation plans, adaptation communications 
and nationally determined contributions, as appropriate, and welcomes that 51 Parties have 
submitted national adaptation plans and 62 Parties have submitted adaptation 
communications to date; 
45. 
Recognizes the significant efforts of developing country Parties in formulating and 
implementing national adaptation plans, adaptation communications and nationally 
determined contributions, as appropriate, including through their domestic expenditure, as 
well as their increased efforts to align their national development plans; 
46. 
Also recognizes the significant challenges developing country Parties face in 
accessing finance for implementing their national adaptation plans;  
47. 
Notes with appreciation the contribution of relevant UNFCCC constituted bodies and 
institutional arrangements, including the Adaptation Committee, the Least Developed 
Countries Expert Group and the Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability and 
adaptation to climate change, to the efforts referred to in paragraph 45 above; 
48. 
Notes that there are gaps in implementation of, support for and collective assessment 
of the adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation, and that monitoring and evaluation of 
outcomes is critical for tracking the progress and improving the quality and awareness of 
adaptation action; 
49. 
Acknowledges that establishing and improving national inventories of climate impacts 
over time and building accessible, user-driven climate services systems, including early 
warning systems, can strengthen the implementation of adaptation actions, and recognizes 
that one third of the world does not have access to early warning and climate information 
services, as well as the need to enhance coordination of activities by the systematic 
observation community;

warning systems against extreme weather and climate change by 2027 and invites 
development partners, international financial institutions and the operating entities of the 
Financial Mechanism to provide support for implementation of the Early Warnings for All 
initiative; 
51. 
Calls for urgent, incremental, transformational and country-driven adaptation action 
based on different national circumstances; 
52. 
Recognizes that climate change impacts are often transboundary in nature and may 
involve complex, cascading risks that require knowledge-sharing and international 
cooperation for addressing them; 
53. 
Emphasizes that the magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend 
strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions, that long-term planning for and 
accelerated implementation of adaptation, particularly in this decade, are critical to closing 
adaptation gaps and create many opportunities, and that accelerated financial support for 
developing countries from developed countries and other sources is a critical enabler;  
54. 
Recognizes the importance of the iterative adaptation cycle for building adaptive 
capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability and notes that the adaptation 
cycle is an iterative process, consisting of risk and impact assessment; planning; 
implementation; and monitoring, evaluation and learning, recognizing the importance of 
means of implementation and support for developing country Parties at each stage of the 
cycle; 
55. 
Encourages the implementation of integrated, multi-sectoral solutions, such as land-
use management, sustainable agriculture, resilient food systems, nature-based solutions and 
ecosystem-based approaches, and protecting, conserving and restoring nature and 
ecosystems, including forests, mountains and other terrestrial and marine and coastal 
ecosystems, which may offer economic, social and environmental benefits such as improved 
resilience and well-being, and that adaptation can contribute to mitigating impacts and losses, 
as part of a country-driven gender-responsive and participatory approach, building on the 
best available science as well as Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge and local knowledge 
systems; 
56. 
Notes that ecosystem-based approaches, including ocean-based adaptation and 
resilience measures, as well as in mountain regions, can reduce a range of climate change 
risks and provide multiple co-benefits; 
57. 
Recalls that, as provided in Article 7, paragraphs 10–11, of the Paris Agreement, each 
Party should, as appropriate, submit and update an adaptation communication, and that the 
adaptation communication shall be, as appropriate, submitted and updated periodically, as a 
component of or in conjunction with other communications or documents, including a 
national adaptation plan, a nationally determined contribution as referred to in Article 4, 
paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement and/or a national communication, and that Parties may, 
as appropriate, also submit and update their adaptation communication as a component of or 
in conjunction with the reports on impacts and adaptation as stipulated in Article 13, 
paragraph 8, of the Paris Agreement; 
58. 
Also recalls that the guidance on adaptation communications is to be reviewed in 
2025;

Stresses the importance of global solidarity in undertaking adaptation efforts, 
including long-term transformational and incremental adaptation, towards reducing 
vulnerability and enhancing adaptive capacity and resilience, as well as the collective well-
being of all people, the protection of livelihoods and economies, and the preservation and 
regeneration of nature, for current and future generations, in the context of the temperature 
goal referred to in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement, and that such efforts should be inclusive 
in terms of adaptation approaches and taking into account the best available science and the 
worldviews and values of Indigenous Peoples, to support achievement of the global goal on 
adaptation; 
62. 
Calls on Parties to enhance their adaptation efforts in line with what is needed to 
achieve the goal in Article 2, paragraph 1(b), of the Paris Agreement and the global goal on 
adaptation, taking into account the framework for the global goal on adaptation referred to in 
decision -/CMA.5;3 
63.

designing climate-resilient infrastructure, guided by traditional knowledge, Indigenous 
Peoples’ knowledge and local knowledge systems; 
64. 
Affirms that the framework for the global goal on adaptation includes the following 
targets in relation to the dimensions of the iterative adaptation cycle, recognizing the need to 
enhance adaptation action and support: 
(a) 
Impact, vulnerability and risk assessment: by 2030 all Parties have conducted 
up-to-date assessments of climate hazards, climate change impacts and exposure to risks and 
vulnerabilities and have used the outcomes of these assessments to inform their formulation 
of national adaptation plans, policy instruments, and planning processes and/or strategies, 
and by 2027 all Parties have established multi-hazard early warning systems, climate 
information services for risk reduction and systematic observation to support improved 
climate-related data, information and services; 
(b) 
Planning: by 2030 all Parties have in place country-driven, gender-responsive, 
participatory and fully transparent national adaptation plans, policy instruments, and 
planning processes and/or strategies, covering, as appropriate, ecosystems, sectors, people 
and vulnerable communities, and have mainstreamed adaptation in all relevant strategies and 
plans; 
(c) 
Implementation: by 2030 all Parties have progressed in implementing their 
national adaptation plans, policies and strategies and, as a result, have reduced the social and 
economic impacts of the key climate hazards identified in the assessments referred to in 
paragraph 6 (a) above; 
(d) 
Monitoring, evaluation and learning: by 2030 all Parties have designed, 
established and operationalized a system for monitoring, evaluation and learning for their 
national adaptation efforts and have built the required institutional capacity to fully 
implement the system; 
65. 
Also affirms that efforts in relation to the targets referred to in paragraphs 63–64 above 
shall be made in a manner that is country-driven, voluntary and in accordance with national 
circumstances, take into account sustainable development and poverty eradication, and do 
not constitute a basis for comparison between Parties;
