Taking of oral fluid sample 
 
(1) 
If the drug testing of a sample of a person’s oral fluid under 
section 66D(4)(b) indicates, in the opinion of the authorised 
drug tester who conducted the drug testing, that the person’s 
oral fluid contains a prescribed illicit drug, the sample must be 
divided into 2 parts, each of which must be deemed to be a 
sample of the person’s oral fluid for the purposes of this Act. 
 
(2) 
The authorised drug tester must ensure that both samples are 
delivered to a police officer. 
 
(3) 
One of the samples must be delivered, on behalf of the person 
who provided the samples, to the Chemistry Centre (WA) by a 
police officer or a person appointed or engaged for that purpose. 
 
(4) 
Subject to subsection (5), if the approved device does not 
indicate a result in the prescribed manner at the conclusion of 
the analysis, a police officer may again require the person to 
provide a sample of oral fluid for drug testing under 
section 66D(1). 
 
(5) 
If the person has provided 2 samples of oral fluid for analysis 
under section 66D(1) and the analysis of each sample has failed, 
the person must not be required to provide another sample of 
oral fluid for analysis under section 66D(1). 
 
(6) 
For the purposes of subsection (5) an analysis of a sample of 
oral fluid will be regarded as having failed only if the analysis is 
made by an approved device and —  
 
(a) 
the device is determined not to be in proper working 
order; or 
 
(b) 
the device does not indicate a positive or negative result.

Impounding offence (driving), police powers to impound 
vehicle used in 
 (1A) 
In this section — 
 
previous offender means a person — 
 
(a) 
who has previously been convicted of an impounding 
offence (driving); or 
 
(b) 
against whom a charge of an impounding offence 
(driving) is pending; 
 
surrender notice has the meaning given in section 79BA. 
 
(1) 
If a police officer reasonably suspects that, while driving a 
vehicle, the driver has committed an impounding offence 
(driving), the police officer must, unless in the circumstances it 
is impracticable to do so, seize and impound the vehicle within 
a period of 28 days after the day of the offence. 
 
(2) 
The period for which the vehicle is impounded ends —  
 
(a) 
unless the police officer specifies a longer period under 
paragraph (b) or the Commissioner extends the period 
under subsection (3), on the 28th day after the day on 
which the vehicle is impounded; 
 
(b) 
if, under subsection (3A), the police officer specifies 
that the length of the impounding period is to be 
3 months, on the last day of the period of 3 months 
commencing on the day after the day on which the 
vehicle was impounded; 
 
(c) 
if the Commissioner extends the period under 
subsection (3), on the last day of the period of 3 months 
commencing on the day after the day on which the

 (3A) 
If, at the time of impounding the vehicle, the police officer 
reasonably believes that the driver of the vehicle is a previous 
offender, the police officer must specify that the length of the 
impounding period is to be 3 months. 
 (3B) 
An impounding period the length of which is specified as 
28 days or 3 months under this section, or in a surrender notice 
for which subsection (1) is the impounding provision, includes 
the part of the day on which the vehicle is impounded that is 
after the impounding occurred even though including that part 
of the day makes the period more than 28 days or 3 months, as 
the case requires. 
 
(3) 
If the driver of the vehicle is a previous offender but the police 
officer does not specify under subsection (3A) that the length of 
the impounding period is to be 3 months, the Commissioner 
must, on being satisfied that the driver is a previous offender, 
extend the impounding period to end on the last day of the 
period of 3 months commencing on the day after the day on 
which the vehicle was impounded. 
 
(4) 
The giving of a notice under section 79B(1) does not prevent the 
Commissioner from, under subsection (3), extending the period 
for which the vehicle is impounded. 
 
(5) 
An extension under subsection (3) is of no effect unless, not less 
than 24 hours before the end of the initial period, notice of the 
extension is given under section 79B(3) to a responsible person.

(i) 
would have been required by section 79(1) or 
79A(1) (the impounding provision) to impound

because it was impracticable, the vehicle was not 
impounded; or 
 
(ii) 
is required by section 79(1) or 79A(1) (the 
impounding provision) to impound the vehicle 
but by the time the police officer forms the

Procedure and grounds for making orders under s. 80A to 
80CB 
 
(1) 
In this section — 
 
Commissioner includes a person for the time being authorised 
by the Commissioner in writing to perform functions of the 
Commissioner under this section; 
 
order means an order under section 80A, 80B(1), 80C(1), 
80CA(1) or 80CB(1). 
 
(2) 
An application for an order — 
 
(a) 
can only be made by the Commissioner; and 
 
(b) 
is to be heard — 
 
(i) 
as part of the proceedings in which the person is 
convicted of the offence because of which the 
order is sought; or 
 
(ii) 
in subsequent proceedings commenced no later 
than 3 months after the proceedings in respect of 
the conviction. 
 
(3) 
A person is to be regarded as having sufficient notice of the 
Commissioner’s intention to make an application for an order in 
respect of a particular vehicle if —  
 
(a) 
the Commissioner gives the person written notice of that 
intention at least 14 days before the application is made 
and the person is —  
 
(i) 
the driver of the vehicle; or

(ii) 
a responsible person; or 
 
(iii) 
any other person who the Commissioner is aware 
has or may have an interest in the vehicle; 
 
 
or 
 
(b) 
in the case of a person not referred to in paragraph (a), 
the Commissioner publishes notice of that intention at 
least 14 days before the application is made in a 
newspaper having State-wide circulation. 
 (3A) 
Despite subsections (2) and (3), the court may make an order on 
its own initiative in proceedings referred to in subsection (2)(b), 
in which case subsection (3) applies as if —  
 
(a) 
references to the Commissioner were references to the 
court; and 
 
(b) 
references to an intention to make an application were 
references to an intention to make an order. 
 
(4) 
Before a court makes an order it has to give a reasonable 
opportunity to show cause why the order should not be made 
to —  
 
(a) 
the driver of the vehicle; and 
 
(b) 
if a person other than the driver is a responsible person 
for the vehicle, each responsible person; and 
 
(c) 
each other person, if any, who has an interest in the 
vehicle. 
 
(5) 
In determining whether or not to make an order other than an 
order under section 80A(3) or (4), the court may have regard 
to — 
 
(a) 
whether the offence because of which the order is sought 
was committed with the knowledge and acquiescence of 
a person who has an interest in the vehicle; and 
 
(b) 
whether making the order will cause severe financial or 
physical hardship to a person who has an interest in the 
vehicle or the usual driver of the vehicle; and

(c) 
any other relevant matter. 
 (6A) 
The court is required to make an order that may be made under 
section 80A(3) or (4) unless it is satisfied that the order would 
cause severe financial or physical hardship to a person, other 
than the driver of the vehicle, who has an interest in the vehicle 
or is the usual driver of the vehicle. 
 
(6) 
A person — 
 
(a) 
who is given notice under subsection (3)(a); or 
 
(b) 
who has satisfied the court that the person has an interest 
in the vehicle, 
 
 
must not do a restricted act in respect of the vehicle unless a 
court has made an order approving of the proposed act. 
 
Penalty for this subsection: a fine of 50 PU. 
 (7A) 
A person does a restricted act in respect of the vehicle if the 
person — 
 
(a) 
disposes of any interest that the person has in the 
vehicle; or 
 
(b) 
does anything, or causes or permits another person to do 
anything, that results or will result in a reduction in the 
value of the vehicle. 
 
(7) 
If the Commissioner advises the CEO in writing that the 
Commissioner intends to apply for an order in respect of a 
particular vehicle, the CEO must not, before the application is 
decided, transfer the licence of the vehicle if the vehicle is 
licensed.

Release of vehicle after impounding period 
 
(1) 
When a vehicle has been impounded under Subdivision 2 or on 
an impounding order and the impounding period ends, the 
Commissioner is to ensure that the vehicle is released if a 
responsible person applies in an approved manner for its 
release. 
 
(2) 
Subsection (1) does not prevent the Commissioner from 
refusing under subsection (3) or section 80IB or 80I(1) to 
release the vehicle. 
 
(3) 
The Commissioner may refuse to release the vehicle until the 
place where it is stored is open to the public.

the Commissioner in impounding the vehicle. 
 (2A) 
If the vehicle impounded under Subdivision 2 is a substitute 
vehicle impounded under section 79BCB, the expenses referred

impounding the substitute vehicle and any unpaid expenses 
incurred in impounding the initially impounded vehicle (as 
defined in section 79BCA(1)). 
 
(2) 
Subsection (1) applies even if the person seeking the release of 
the vehicle is not the person suspected of having committed, or 
found to have committed, the offence for which the vehicle was 
impounded. 
 
(3) 
The Commissioner may release the vehicle without requiring 
payment of the amount described in subsection (1) if the 
Commissioner considers it appropriate in the circumstances to 
do so. 
 
(4) 
If payment of the amount described in subsection (1) is made 
for the release of the vehicle, that payment extinguishes any 
liability under section 79E or 80H, as the case requires, to pay 
the Commissioner for expenses of the impounding even though 
the payment may not have been made by the person who was 
liable under that section. 
 
(5) 
In the case of a vehicle impounded under Subdivision 2 the 
Commissioner has to refund, to the person who made the 
payment, an amount described in subsection (1) that was paid to 
the Commissioner for the release of the vehicle if —  
 
(a) 
no charge of committing the offence for which the 
vehicle was impounded is laid during the period of 
one year after the day on which the offence is suspected 
to have been committed; or 
 
(b) 
during the period described in paragraph (a) a person is 
charged with committing the offence but the person is 
acquitted of that offence, or the charge is withdrawn or 
dismissed.

which the vehicle was impounded, that person is liable to pay to 
the Commissioner an amount specified by the Commissioner as

under Subdivision 2 or on an impounding order until the 
Commissioner is paid the post-impoundment expenses for the 
vehicle.
