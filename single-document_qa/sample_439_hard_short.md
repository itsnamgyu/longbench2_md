# Question

Which of the following statements is incorrect?

# Choices

- A: Even under extreme noise conditions, SDDPM still can recover most of the high frequency information of the original picture
- B: The denoising ability of the baseline convolution structure decreases exponentially with the increase of noise
- C: SwinIR's structure contains 3 convolutional layers and a sequence of residual swin transformer blocks (RSTB)
- D: One of the reason that SDDPM can be used for denoising images obtained from the wild is it  is able to map the noisy image to one of the noise levels it has been trained with and thereafter generate the denoised image

# Answer

B
