To get to it from downtown, you had to leave the pretty shops and the creaking seaside piers and drive a road that wound upward, toward the cliffs. You passed the heart of Claire Lake, the part of town where the locals lived and the tourists didn\u2019t usually go. You passed a grid of shops and low apartment blocks, local diners and hair salons. On the outskirts of town, you passed newer developments, built between the foot of the cliffs and the flat land on the edge of the inland lake that gave the town its name. The land was too wet and rocky to keep building, so the newer developments tapered off into woods and two-lane roads. Along the west edge of the lake were homes built in the seventies, squat shapes in brown brick and cream siding, the gardens neatly kept for over forty years by people who had never moved away. Past those houses, around the other edges of the lake, there was nothing but back roads, used only by hikers, hunters, fishermen, and teenage kids looking for trouble. In the seventies, the houses along the lake were for the up-and-coming ones, the people with good jobs. Everyone else lived in town. And if you were rich, you lived on the hill. The road climbed on the north side of the lake. The houses were set far apart here for privacy, and the roads were kept narrow and uneven, as if trying to keep outsiders away. The wealthy had come to Claire Lake in the twenties, when the town was first created, looking for a place that was scenic, secluded, and cheap to build big houses. They brought their money from Portland and California and settled in. Some of the houses sat empty after the stock market crash, but they filled up again during the boom after World War II. The people who lived here called the neighborhood Arlen Heights. The Greer mansion was one of the original houses in Arlen Heights. It was an ugly Frankenstein of a house even when it was built\u2014a pseudo-Victorian style of slanted roofs and spires, though the walls were of butter yellow brick. And when Julian Greer bought it in 1950 with his newly inherited pharmaceutical fortune, he made it worse. He remodeled the lower floor to be more modern, with straight lines and dark brown wood. He also put in a bank of windows along the back wall to open up the house\u2019s dark, gloomy interior. The windows looked out to the house\u2019s back lawn and its drop-off to the ocean beyond. The effect was supposed to be sweeping, breathtaking, but like most of Julian\u2019s life, it didn\u2019t work out as planned. The windows fogged, and the view was bleak. The lawn was flat and dead, and the ocean beyond the cliff was choppy and cold. Julian had done the renovations in hopes of pleasing his new wife, Mariana, but instead the relentless view from the windows unsettled her, and she kept the curtains closed. She decorated the rest of the house dutifully but listlessly, which was a harbinger of their marriage. Something about the Greer mansion stifled laughter and killed happiness. It might sound dramatic, but anyone who had lived there knew it was true. By 1975, both Julian and Mariana were dead, Julian with his blood all over the kitchen floor, Mariana in the twisted wreck of a car crash. The house watched all of it happen, indifferent. Tonight it was raining, a cold, hard downpour that came in from the ocean. Arlen Heights was quiet, and the Greer mansion was dark. The rain spattered hard on the panes of glass, tracing lines down the large windows overlooking the lawn. The dark skeletons of the trees on either side of the house bowed back and forth in the wind, the branches scraping the roof. Drops pocked the empty driveway. The house was still and silent, stoic under the wind and the water. On the lawn, something moved across the surface of the grass. The touch of a footprint. Inside the house, one of the cupboard doors opened in the dark kitchen, groaning softly into the silence. In a bedroom window a shape appeared, shadowy and indistinct. The blur, perhaps, of a face. A handprint touched the bedroom window, the palm pressing into the glass. For a second, it was there, pale and white, though there was no one to see. The wind groaned in the eaves. The handprint faded. The figure moved back into the darkness. And the house was still once more. \n CHAPTER TWO September 2017 SHEA The day before I met Beth Greer was a Tuesday, with a gray sky overhead and a thin drizzle that wet my face and beaded in my hair as I waited at the bus stop. It was unseasonably warm, and the concrete gave off that rainy scent it sometimes has, rising up from beneath my ballet flats. There was a man standing next to me, wearing an overcoat and scrolling through his phone with an exhausted look on his face. On my other side was a worried-looking woman who was frantically texting. I closed my eyes, inhaling the scent of the rain laced with a thread of cologne from the man next to me, overlaid with gasoline and diesel fumes from the street. This was my life. It wasn\u2019t a bad one. I was twenty-nine and divorced. I lived in a small complex of low-rise condos on a tangle of curved streets with the aspirational name of Saddle Estates. In my mind I called it Singles Estates, because it was almost exclusively populated with romantic failures like me, people who needed somewhere to live when they sold off their married house and took their half of the money. The man in the overcoat was divorced, guaranteed, and I\u2019d bet money the woman was texting a kid who was in school while spending a court-designated week with his father. My divorce was still new. I had no kids. My place was small, smelled of paint, and only contained the bare necessities of furniture. But it wasn\u2019t the worst life I could have. I\u2019d known since I was nine that I was lucky to have any life at all. On the bus, I pulled out my phone, put my earbuds in my ears, and played the audiobook I was in the middle of listening to. A thriller: a woman in danger, most of the characters possibly lying, everything not quite as it seemed. A twist somewhere near the end that would either shock me or wouldn\u2019t. There were dozens of books just like it, hundreds maybe, and they were the soundtrack of my life. The woman\u2019s voice in my earbuds told me about death, murder, deep family secrets, people who shouldn\u2019t be trusted, lies that cost lives. But a novel always ends, the lies come to the surface, and the deaths are explained. Maybe one of the bad characters gets away with something\u2014that\u2019s fashionable right now\u2014but you are still left with a sense that things are balanced, that dark things come to light, and that the bad person will, at least, most likely be miserable. It was dark comfort, but it was still comfort. I knew my own tally by heart: My would-be killer had been in prison for nineteen years, seven months, and twenty-six days. His parole hearing was in six months. Work was a doctor\u2019s office in downtown Claire Lake. I was a receptionist, taking calls, filing charts, making appointments. As I came through the door, I pulled the earbuds from my ears and gave my coworkers a smile, shaking off all of the darkness and death. \u201cBusy day,\u201d Karen, the other receptionist, said, glancing at me, then away again. \u201cWe open in twenty.\u201d We weren\u2019t bosom friends, my coworkers and I, even though I had worked here for five years. The other women here were married with kids, which meant we had nothing much in common since my divorce. I hadn\u2019t talked to any of them about the divorce, except to say it had happened. And I couldn\u2019t add to the conversations about daycares and swimming programs. The doctors didn\u2019t socialize with any of us\u2014they came and went, expecting the mechanism of the office to work without much of their input. I took off my jacket and put on my navy blue scrub top, shoving my phone and purse under the desk. I could probably make friends here if I tried. I was attractive enough, with long dark hair that I kept tied back, an oval face, and dark eyes. At the same time, I didn\u2019t have the kind of good looks that threaten other women. I was standoffish\u2014I knew that. It was an inescapable part of my personality, a tendency I couldn\u2019t turn off no matter how much therapy I did. I didn\u2019t like people too close, and I was terrible at small talk. My therapists called it a defense mechanism; I only knew it was me, like my height or the shape of my chin. But my lack of gregariousness wasn\u2019t the only reason my coworkers gave me a wide berth. Though they didn\u2019t say anything to me, a rumor had gotten out in my first week; they all knew who I was, what I had escaped. And they all knew what I did in the evenings, the side project that consumed all of my off-hours. My obsession, really. They probably all thought it wasn\u2019t healthy. But I\u2019ve always believed that murder is the healthiest obsession of all. \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d my sister, Esther, said on the phone. \u201cYou\u2019re hibernating again.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said. It was after work, and I was at my local grocery store, the Safeway in the plaza within walking distance to Singles Estates. I put cereal in my cart as I shoulder-pinned the phone to my ear. \u201cI\u2019m grabbing some groceries and going home.\u201d \u201cI told you to come over for dinner. Will and I want to see you.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s raining.\u201d \u201cThis is Claire Lake. It\u2019s always raining.\u201d I looked at a carton of almond milk, wondering what it tasted like. \u201cI know you worry about me, but I\u2019m fine. I just have work to do.\u201d \u201cYou already have a job. The website isn\u2019t paid work.\u201d \u201cIt pays enough.\u201d My big sister sighed, and the sound gave me a twinge of sadness. I really did want to see her, along with her husband, Will, a lawyer who I liked quite a lot. Esther was one of the only people who really mattered to me, and even though she gave me grief, I knew she tried hard to understand me. She\u2019d had her own guilt and trauma over what had happened to me. She had her own reasons to be paranoid\u2014to hibernate, as she put it. The difference was, Esther didn\u2019t hibernate. She had a husband and a house and a good job, a career. \u201cJust tell me you\u2019re trying,\u201d Esther said. \u201cTrying to get out, trying to do something, trying to meet new people.\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cToday I met a man who has a hernia and a woman who would only say she has a \u2018uterus problem.\u2019 \u201d I put the almond milk down. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what a \u2018uterus problem\u2019 is, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m curious.\u201d \u201cIf you wanted to know, you could look in her file and find out.\u201d \u201cI never look in patients\u2019 files,\u201d I told her. \u201cYou know that. I answer phones and deal with appointment times, not diagnoses. Looking in a patient file could get me fired.\u201d \u201cYou make no sense, Shea. You won\u2019t look at patients\u2019 medical files, but you\u2019ll talk about murders and dead bodies on the internet.\u201d I paused, unpinning my phone from my shoulder. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s actually a good point. I get that. But does it mean that in order to be consistent, I should be more nosy or less?\u201d \u201cIt means you live too much inside your own head, overthinking everything,\u201d Esther said. \u201cIt means you need to meet people who aren\u2019t patients, real people who aren\u2019t murder victims on a page. Make friends. Find a man to date.\u201d \u201cNot yet for the dating thing,\u201d I told her. \u201cMaybe soon.\u201d \u201cThe divorce was a year ago.\u201d \u201cEleven months.\u201d I dodged a woman coming the opposite way up my aisle, then moved around a couple pondering the cracker selection. \u201cI\u2019m not opposed to finding someone. It\u2019s dating itself that freaks me out. I mean, you meet a stranger, and that\u2019s it? He could be anyone, hiding anything.\u201d \u201cShea.\u201d \u201cDo you know how many serial killers dated lonely women in their everyday lives? Some divorc\u00e9e who just wants companionship from a nice man? She thinks she\u2019s won the dating lottery, and meanwhile he\u2019s out there on a Sunday afternoon, dumping bodies. And now we\u2019re supposed to use internet apps, where someone\u2019s picture might not even be real. People are lying about their faces.\u201d \u201cOkay, okay. No dating apps. No dating at all yet. I get it. But make some friends, Shea. Join a book club or a bowling league or something.\u201d My cart was full. I paused by the plate glass windows at the front of the store, letting my gaze travel over the parking lot. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d \u201cThat means no,\u201d Esther said. \u201cIt means I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d The parking lot looked like any normal parking lot during after-work hours, with cars pulling in and out. I watched for a moment, letting my eyes scan the cars and the people. An old habit. I couldn\u2019t have told you what I was looking for, only that I\u2019d know it when I saw it. \u201cThanks, sis. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d I bought my groceries and put them in the cloth bags I\u2019d brought with me. I slung the bags over my shoulders and started the walk home in the rain, my coat hood pulled up over my head, my feet trying to avoid the puddles. The walk toward Singles Estates took me down a busy road, with cars rushing by me, splashing water and giving me a face full of fumes. Not the most pleasant walk in the world, but I put my earbuds in and put one foot in front of the other. Esther had long ago given up on telling me to get a car. It would never happen. Besides, I got home before nightfall, so I didn\u2019t have to walk alone in the dark. I called that a win. \n CHAPTER THREE September 2017 SHEA At home in my little condo, I changed into dry clothes, made myself a tuna salad sandwich, and powered up my laptop. Despite the stress, the gnawing uncertainty, the expense, and\u2014yes\u2014the heartbreak, this was the upside of getting divorced: I had the freedom to sit in my underfurnished living room in pajama pants and a T-shirt, eating mayonnaise-drenched tuna and working uninterrupted for the rest of my evening. The project I was working on, the obsession of my off-hours, was my website, the Book of Cold Cases. It wasn\u2019t an actual book. It was a collection of posts and articles written by me about unsolved crimes, the famous and the not so famous. The site included a private message board where people as obsessed as I was could post their theories or the new facts they\u2019d found. I\u2019d started the site nearly a decade ago as a personal blog, a place where I could post in near obscurity about the things that fascinated me. But over the years, it had started to take on a life of its own, and now the site had nearly two thousand members, all of whom paid a small yearly fee. I sold ads on the site sometimes, too. The money wasn\u2019t nearly enough to live on, but it was enough for me to pay for upgraded servers, occasional professional webmaster work, and\u2014most importantly\u2014research help. I logged on and scrolled through the new messages on the message board. There was a lively conversation going on about the disappearance of a little girl in Tennessee, and another one about a woman in Michigan who claimed she was abducted but could provide no evidence of it. Someone had revived an old thread about the Zodiac Killer because of a recent podcast they\u2019d heard, and someone else had posted a link to a new theory about the JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey case. I read through everything and added my own comments, looking out for messages that were inflammatory or insulting. Even in a closed group, the internet was the perfect place for people who wanted to call each other names, and it required constant moderation. People could get as angry about a twenty-year-old murder as they could about modern-day politics. When I was finished, I clicked over to the article I was currently working on, about a woman in Connecticut who had left her house and disappeared, leaving her two-year-old daughter alone in her playpen. Security footage showed her walking past a mall three miles away, but how had she gotten there, and why? She\u2019d left her car in the driveway. Cell phone records showed a single phone call from the woman\u2019s phone to 911 four hours after she disappeared. The call had disconnected as soon as the operator answered. Did that mean the woman was still alive then, trying to call for help? Or had someone else used her phone? These were the kinds of questions that could send me straight down the rabbit hole for days on end. I picked up my phone and called Michael De Vos, the private detective who worked for me sometimes. Being a layperson had its limits when you wrote crime stories, and Michael was a help when I needed expert analysis. He used to be a cop in the Claire Lake PD. He picked up right away. \u201cShea. You\u2019re home?\u201d he said. Michael knew a lot about my paranoia, though he didn\u2019t know the reason. He didn\u2019t seem to find it strange; he often checked that I was home safe when we talked. \u201cI made it,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d Michael was usually somewhere interesting. As a private detective, he lived the kind of life that would be way too much for my anxiety to handle. \u201cRight now I\u2019m in a parked car,\u201d he said, \u201cwaiting for someone. Where I\u2019ve been since noon.\u201d He did, in fact, sound bored. \u201cWaiting for who?\u201d \u201cYou know that\u2019s classified.\u201d I felt myself smiling. Everything Michael did was classified, according to him. At least the interesting stuff was. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing a boring stakeout,\u201d I said, \u201cthen you had time to read the article I sent.\u201d \u201cI did.\u201d I heard him sip something. I pictured him in a car parked at the side of a road somewhere, the misty rain dripping down the windows. Maybe he was waiting for a cheating spouse or an embezzler. In my mind, the car was a big, boxy seventies thing, even though it was 2017. Michael gave off that old-school vibe. Not that he was old. As far as I knew, he was somewhere in the second half of his thirties, with dark brown hair and brown eyes. Good-looking, most women would think. Women who weren\u2019t closed off like me. I\u2019d only ever seen a photograph of him, which he\u2019d sent me early on; we\u2019d never met in person. I wasn\u2019t very good with meeting strange men in person. \u201cWhat did you think?\u201d I asked him. \u201cIf you want to know what I think about the article, it was excellent. If you want to know what I think about the case, then the husband did it. With the father\u2019s help.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen they find her, there will be. Because she\u2019s definitely dead.\u201d Something inside me that had been coiled tight loosened for the first time all day. I loved Esther, but she didn\u2019t really get me. Our parents lived in Florida, and they definitely didn\u2019t get me. My coworkers didn\u2019t get me. My ex-husband didn\u2019t get me. Michael got me. I didn\u2019t know how or why. He just did. No one in my life wanted to talk about this stuff except him. \u201cWhat about the mall footage?\u201d I asked him. \u201cInconclusive. My guess is it isn\u2019t her. The killers caught a lucky break with that.\u201d \u201cThe husband and the father working together is unusual.\u201d \u201cUnusual, but not unheard of. It\u2019s going to be difficult for them to maintain. One of them will probably make a deal, giving up the other one.\u201d \u201cBut the husband, really? Everyone says they were a loving couple.\u201d \u201cEveryone always says that, and everyone is always wrong.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a cynic,\u201d I said, scrolling through the article again, looking for typos. \u201cThat\u2019s a good quality to have.\u201d \u201cMy ex-wife would not agree.\u201d I paused. He hadn\u2019t mentioned an ex-wife before; we didn\u2019t usually get personal. \u201cThen she can call my ex-husband,\u201d I said, trying it out. \u201cIt sounds like they have a lot in common.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019d probably get along just fine.\u201d He paused. \u201cI think I see some movement. I have to go. Put the article up. It\u2019s good.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d I said. \u201cGood luck.\u201d When we hung up, I put my phone down and did a circuit of my place, checking that the doors were locked, the windows fastened. Singles Estates had a security guard at the entrance to the complex, but that didn\u2019t mean much to me. Anyone on foot who was determined to get in could find a way. I was on the third floor\u2014no way was I taking a ground-floor apartment\u2014and I had a security system just in case. Locks on the windows, no fire escape, no easy-to-pop screens. One of the few things I missed about marriage was the everyday presence of a man in the house, keeping the bad things away without even knowing it. But I didn\u2019t have that anymore, so I had to be careful. Everything was in place. When I was finished, I sat down in front of my computer again. I tapped it awake and logged in to the Book of Cold Cases. And I started tonight\u2019s journey into the darkness. \n CHAPTER FOUR September 2017 SHEA I was tired at work the next day, because I\u2019d stayed up later than I should have, working on the Book of Cold Cases. The bus had been ten minutes late, I\u2019d dropped my bus pass, and I\u2019d gotten to work out of sorts. I was on autopilot. Our office was in downtown Claire Lake, and our patients were mostly rich, or at least well-to-do\u2014Claire Lake on the whole was well-to-do, a town of chic kitchen specialty stores and French bistros laid out along the ocean shore. The spectacle I saw from the safety behind my Plexiglas was never that of people digging their nails in for survival, doing their best to get through every day. Instead it was often the foibles of the rich, the ones who had the money to make their aches and pains go away. For a few minutes, I thought the woman who walked in might be someone famous. Her face was familiar in a way I couldn\u2019t quite place. She was an actress, maybe, one who had been on TV several decades ago. She was tall and stately, likely over sixty. Her skin was nearly flawless, with creases around the eyes and the mouth to give her character. Her hair was fashionably cut, with long bangs sweeping to her eyebrows and layers falling to her shoulders in light and dark shades of gray. She wore a black turtleneck sweater and sleek black pants under a trench coat. To me, the glamour wafting off her was worthy of Isabella Rossellini or Helen Mirren, though the woman seemed unaware of it. She looked distracted, and after slipping her ID beneath the Plexiglas to Karen, she took a seat, pulled out a pair of stylish reading glasses, and started reading a dog-eared novel. \u201cWhat?\u201d Karen said to me as she wheeled her office chair back to the shelf and looked for the woman\u2019s file. \u201cI know her from somewhere,\u201d I said. There was a brief lull in which the phone wasn\u2019t ringing, and I sipped my coffee and tried to be discreet as I looked at the woman again. She flipped a page in her book, oblivious. I couldn\u2019t read the title from here, but I could see a cover of deep blue with slashes of jarring yellow lettering, which meant a thriller like the ones I read. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look familiar to me,\u201d Karen said. \u201cMaybe she was a teacher of yours? A neighbor?\u201d I shook my head, studying the woman\u2019s face, still trying to place it. There was something about her cheekbones, the line of her mouth. She was beautiful, for sure, and had likely been even more so when young. I\u2019d never had a teacher who looked like that. She had to be an actress, yet that didn\u2019t seem right. \u201cA singer?\u201d I said, trying to jar my memory. \u201cA politician?\u201d Karen shrugged, uninterested. \u201cI don\u2019t follow music or politics. If it bothers you, Google her.\u201d She glanced down at the file she was holding. \u201cElizabeth Greer.\u201d I went still, the breath going out of me. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s her name, Elizabeth Greer.\u201d Karen squinted at me, frowning. \u201cWhat? Is she famous? Should I try and get an autograph?\u201d I put my hands on the desk. My fingers were tingling, my cheeks going numb. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t want her autograph.\u201d \u201cWhatever,\u201d Karen said. The phone rang, and she turned away to answer it. Elizabeth Greer, I thought, glancing at the woman again. Beth Greer. She sat reading her book, unaware I was staring. Of course I knew her face. I\u2019d seen dozens of photos of her, news footage. I\u2019d put photos of her on my own website. I hadn\u2019t recognized her because the photos on my site were from forty years ago, and no one had a photo of what she looked like now. The woman sitting twenty feet away from me, reading a book, was Beth Greer. And in 1977, she\u2019d been Claire Lake\u2019s most famous murderer. \u2014 In October of 1977, a man named Thomas Armstrong left work at six o\u2019clock at night and got in his car. He left downtown Claire Lake and drove toward his house at the edge of the lake, taking the smaller roads out of town. He never got home. At seven thirty, his car was found, the lights on and the engine still running as Armstrong lay dead on the side of the road. Armstrong was a family man, with a wife, two children, no criminal ties, and no debts. It appeared that he\u2019d pulled over on his way home, possibly to help someone who needed aid. He was shot twice in the face, one bullet piercing his brain and killing him instantly. Next to him was left a note written in a woman\u2019s hand that said: Am I bitter or am I sweet? Ladies can be either. Publish this or there will be more. Murders were rare in Claire Lake, so there was no question the case would receive front-page press. But the note put the local police in a quandary. Keep the note quiet and don\u2019t encourage a possible copycat? Or give the killer what she wanted? There didn\u2019t seem to be a right answer. Finally, they handed the note to the press, who immediately dubbed the murderer the Lady Killer. No one could understand it. Had a woman really shot a strange man point-blank in the face, like the Zodiac Killer or the Son of Sam? Thomas Armstrong had no enemies. No one could think of anyone who would have wanted to murder him; he seemed to be an everyday husband and father on his way home from work. No one could see a reason why he was targeted. But there he was, dead by the side of the road, the lenses of his glasses smashed and a note in a woman\u2019s hand left by his body. And then things got worse. Four days after Armstrong\u2019s murder, family man Paul Veerhoever left work to go home. He, too, pulled over to the side of the road on the outskirts of town, where he was shot twice\u2014one bullet hitting his jaw and one his right temple. This time a witness walking his dog heard the shot and came out of the trees to find a woman get in a car and drive away. She had red hair and she was wearing a trench coat. Next to Veerhoever\u2019s body was a note in the same hand as the first one: Catch me! The town panicked. No one in Claire Lake had ever seen crimes so violent, so brutal, so random. who is the lady killer? was the headline from the Claire Lake Daily. The next day, in the Claire Lake Free Press: police warn claire lake residents to \u201cstay safe after dark.\u201d People\u2014men especially\u2014were warned not to pull over and help anyone on the road. The news wires picked it up, and within days the case had gone statewide, with reporters from Portland and Eugene coming to town to cover it. It was a great story: two innocent, upstanding husbands and fathers, gunned down execution-style in cold blood. A dark predator on the streets of a quiet seaside town, apparently hunting for victims. The victims, in this case, were men, and the cold-blooded killer was quite possibly a woman. The witness to the second murder identified the woman he saw as Beth Greer. In 1977, Beth was twenty-three, beautiful, and rich. Her family lived in a mansion in the city\u2019s wealthiest neighborhood, Arlen Heights. Her father had died in 1973, shot during a home invasion that was never solved, and her mother had died in a car accident two years later, leaving Beth alone in the house with an inheritance of millions. Beth had red hair, and she owned a trench coat. She also owned a car like the one the witness had seen. She said she\u2019d been home at the time of both murders, drinking alone. Beth was photographed coming out of the Claire Lake police station after an interview, looking beautiful and cold and carefree. No one liked her; her neighbors said she was standoffish, and she tended to have unsavory people at her house. Her car was seized and her mansion searched, but no evidence was found. No one could come up with a reason for a rich girl with no problems to start killing random men. But someone had. And Beth Greer sold papers. The Portland papers ran a story with a photo of Beth Greer laughing, looking beautiful and sexy. It was a photo from a year before, but no one cared. They ran it with the headline is she the female zodiac killer? Then the New York Times picked up the story, though the photo it ran was more recent and the headline was subdued: murders by apparent female killer baffle oregon police. The article said: \u201clocal socialite Beth Greer has been identified as a person of interest,\u201d and Beth Greer became the most famous murder suspect in America. The woman who had sold all of those papers was sitting in my waiting room right now, quietly reading a book. I remembered the photos of her from 1977\u2014Beth was sleek and gorgeous, her body in tight-fitting seventies tops and high-waisted pants, her long red hair cascading over her shoulders and down her back. She had big, dark, perfectly even eyes that were hypnotic and somehow sexual. Even as she was being led from jail to the courthouse and back, wearing an ill-fitting jumpsuit, she looked like a movie star. My fingertips were numb as I moved files around, as I typed patient information on my computer and answered emails. Beth Greer glanced at her watch briefly, then turned another page. They had arrested her as the Lady Killer and taken her to trial, which had been covered in a nationwide spectacle. She was acquitted, but that didn\u2019t stop the headlines: has a deadly female killer gone free? No one knew the answer. I\u2019d written an article about the Lady Killer case for the Book of Cold Cases, and all I\u2019d found was an endless spiral of speculation. There were so many details, so many what-ifs. So many questions. Why those two men? Had they known Beth? Was she a young woman grieving her parents\u2019 tragic deaths or a seething psychopath with a sexy body? Did the notes even mean anything, and if so, what? Why had the state gone to trial with no murder weapon and no forensic evidence? If the killer wasn\u2019t Beth Greer, why had the killings stopped when she was arrested? The killer had written Catch me! Had they caught her? Was Beth an innocent victim or a femme fatale? I\u2019d spent five weeks writing the article for my website, and three times I\u2019d taken the bus to Arlen Heights so I could walk past the Greer mansion. I\u2019d found Beth\u2019s birth certificate, her DMV records, her property taxes. I\u2019d read the local newspaper coverage and compared it with the national coverage, including articles in Newsweek. I\u2019d read every rumor\u2014there were hundreds\u2014and every wild conspiracy theory. I\u2019d looked at every photo of her, including the baby and childhood pictures I could find. I\u2019d even tracked down a pirated copy of the 1981 TV movie made about the case, starring Jaclyn Smith, and bought a ripped DVD that cost me $300 because the movie wasn\u2019t available digitally. I\u2019d dug up every scrap, searching for answers, just like so many others before me. I\u2019d been obsessed. I still was. And Beth Greer was at the center of it, in all her unreadable complexity. I glanced up through the Plexiglas and watched her absently scratch her temple. She was still beautiful, there was no doubt of that. Still fascinating, at least to me. No one else in the room noticed her. For most people, the Lady Killer murders were ancient history, a curious footnote, if they had heard of them at all. The frightened fall of 1977 was a long-ago memory or a rumor of a time before you were born. After the trial and the sensational acquittal, Beth had dropped out of the public eye. Information about her over the past forty years was thin, though I knew she hadn\u2019t married or had kids, that she still lived in the mansion, presumably all alone. Whether she was innocent or guilty, there were no more Lady Killer murders. The story seemed to be over. Beth crossed one leg over the other, turning the pages of her novel. I wondered if the book was about murder. \u201cMiss Greer?\u201d One of the nurses poked her head out the door from the exam rooms. Beth put her book away and stood. I looked at her and saw the young woman who had been photographed being led to and from the courthouse, the acquitted prisoner standing next to her attorney, wearing a red shawl and red lipstick. I saw a woman, and I also saw the biggest mystery in the history of Claire Lake. No one watched as she crossed the waiting room. No one except me. \n CHAPTER FIVE September 2017 SHEA \u201cI\u2019m taking my lunch break,\u201d I said. It was early for lunch, but Karen shrugged. I was entitled, and the sooner I went, the sooner I could come back and relieve her. I pulled my purse from under the desk and grabbed my coat. Beth Greer had taken forty-five minutes for her appointment. Then she\u2019d walked through the waiting room, disappearing into the elevator without a backward glance. I couldn\u2019t have said what possessed me to follow her, but I had the impulse not to let her out of my sight. The rain had let up today, the sky a chalky gray-blue, the wind carrying the scent of ocean. On the street, people sat at the outdoor caf\u00e9s or window-shopped, taking pictures of the houseboats on the water. Claire Lake had a neighborhood of citizens who lived on their boats, docked in the marina. They had walkways and window planters, garden gnomes and pinwheel birds, like any other home. In some past decade, the city had made the houseboats legal residences, and subsequent attempts to change the zoning had failed. Now it was one of Claire Lake\u2019s tourist attractions, a pretty spot for people to stroll and enjoy their fancy take-out coffee. People came here to stay in the B&Bs, stroll the tidy, cobblestoned streets, and get away from the bigger, more crowded cities. Beth didn\u2019t head toward the marina. Instead she turned a corner down a side street. I followed at a safe distance, under cover of the downtown crowd. Beth turned another corner, then another. Then I lost her. I stood next to a small, shaded park and turned in a circle, wondering which way she\u2019d gone. Then a voice came from the park: \u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d It was Beth. She was sitting on a park bench under the canopy of trees, watching me. She wore sunglasses, the big kind that covered half her face, even though it was a cloudy day. Behind her was a statue of a man getting out of a boat\u2014some Oregon explorer. Beth\u2019s purse was on the bench next to her, and she had one knee crossed over the other. She watched me, waiting politely for an answer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI know who you are.\u201d That sounded vaguely threatening, so I hurried to add, \u201cI\u2019m a crime writer.\u201d Beth looked me up and down, taking in my scrub top. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like a crime writer.\u201d \u201cI do it in my off-hours. I run a website.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. My name is Shea Collins.\u201d Beth Greer tilted her head, watching me. When I was researching my article on the Lady Killer case, I\u2019d found a video on YouTube of Beth right before her arrest. She was getting out of her car and walking up the lane to the Greer mansion. The reporter\u2014a man in a belted trench coat and plaid wide-legged pants, straight from 1977 central casting\u2014had caught Beth as she pulled up and opened the car door. The reporter must have gotten a scoop, because there were no other reporters there. It was raining, and Beth was wearing a trench coat, too. It was an uncanny image, that of a woman in red hair and a trench coat, just like the witness to the second murder had reported seeing. Beth Greer looked like she could have been walking the Paris runway any time in the twenty-first century. \u201cMiss Greer!\u201d the reporter had shouted as he followed her, waving his wired microphone. \u201cMiss Greer! Do you have anything to say about the murder accusations against you? Are you the Lady Killer?\u201d Beth slammed her car door and put her hands in her pockets. She looked at the reporter and leaned toward the microphone. \u201cI\u2019m just a girl who minds her own business,\u201d she said. Her tone was cold and without inflection, almost robotic. In 1977, everyone thought that Beth Greer\u2019s lack of emotion about being put on trial for murder made her unfeeling, almost unnatural, like a witch. Watching the clip in 2017, I heard in her voice a woman who was sick to death of everything, a woman who had lived through the trauma of her parents\u2019 deaths and was living through a media frenzy, a woman who knew that nothing she said or did would ever matter. It wasn\u2019t that she was unfeeling. It was that she\u2019d stopped caring, stopped being afraid. I\u2019m just a girl who minds her own business. That woman was looking at me now. The same woman who had possibly shot two men in cold blood and left taunting notes for the police. \u201cSo you want to write about me. Is that it?\u201d Now that I heard her voice, it was unmistakable. It was the same voice from the video. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first person to ask.\u201d \u201cI already wrote about you.\u201d People were passing me on the sidewalk, so I stepped forward, toward Beth, hoping I wasn\u2019t spooking her. Or spooking her more than I already had. \u201cThen what do you want?\u201d Beth asked me. Not a hostile question. A curious one. What did I want? I knew the answer to that. I could feel the blood pulsing in my veins, and my thoughts were mercury-quick, as if I were high. \u201cI want to interview you,\u201d I said. I had one shot at Beth Greer\u2014maybe the only shot in my life. \u201cI want to hear what really happened. I want to hear it from you.\u201d I paused. \u201cI want to know what it was like to be you. Back then. And what it\u2019s like to be you now.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re asking a lot,\u201d Beth said. \u201cI know.\u201d I supposed I wasn\u2019t a girl who minded her own business. I dug in my purse, looking for a business card\u2014I\u2019d had some printed once, when I had felt the urge to be more official. Now I couldn\u2019t find any. I found a flyer instead\u2014one I had found shoved in my condo mailbox, that I\u2019d put in my purse and forgotten. It advertised a local Thai place. I found a pen and wrote the URL of my website on it. Beneath that, I wrote my phone number. I handed Beth the Thai menu, my cheeks heating. \u201cI swear I\u2019m a professional,\u201d I said. Beth didn\u2019t look convinced, but she took the menu. She didn\u2019t throw it in my face or tell me to mind my own business. She read what I had written, then folded the flyer and tucked it in her own purse. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you.\u201d She waited a second, then waved a hand. \u201cGo back to work, Shea.\u201d I stood rooted. I couldn\u2019t move until I knew. \u201cAre you going to think about it, or are you going to throw it away?\u201d I asked her. \u201cJust tell me, so I\u2019m not jumping every time the phone rings. This is the biggest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. It\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d She took her sunglasses off. She had aged forty years, but she still had the eyes of the woman in the YouTube video. \u201cYou\u2019re really serious, aren\u2019t you? Are you writing a book or something?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said, because I wasn\u2019t. I had no idea how to write a book or get it published. It wasn\u2019t something that had even crossed my mind. \u201cBut, yes, I\u2019m serious.\u201d \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll be honest,\u201d Beth said. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked for a lot of interviews. I\u2019ve been offered money. I\u2019ve never been interested. But you\u2019re not like anyone who has ever asked me.\u201d I was silent. Was that good or bad? Did it matter? \u201cSo, yes, I\u2019ll consider it,\u201d Beth continued. \u201cDespite how gauche your pitch was\u2014or perhaps because of it\u2014I\u2019ll think it over. Does that satisfy you?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cThank you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Go back before they fire you.\u201d I turned and walked back to the office, my mind racing. I didn\u2019t see a single thing in front of me. I forgot that I hadn\u2019t actually had lunch. I\u2019d have to eat the crackers and cheese I\u2019d stuffed in my purse this morning. At my desk, my gaze moved to the stack of patient files on the trolley that had been wheeled between me and Karen. One of those files was Beth Greer\u2019s. Was she ill? Was that why she was considering my offer? A sort of deathbed confession? I could find out. It would be easy. My gaze traveled up to the sign on the wall above the locked filing cabinets. a reminder to every employee: patient files are confidential! If I were caught reading Beth\u2019s file, I\u2019d be fired. For a second, I was still tempted. But I\u2019d never broken a rule like that. I stood up, picked up the stack of files, and began to put them away. \n CHAPTER SIX September 2017 SHEA \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t get served with a restraining order,\u201d Michael said over the phone. \u201cThat\u2019s something, at least.\u201d I was at home, putting my single-serve piece of lasagna in the oven, the phone crooked between my ear and my shoulder. \u201cI talked to an older lady in a public park,\u201d I protested. \u201cIt was perfectly innocent.\u201d \u201c \u2018Innocent\u2019 is a curious choice of words when you\u2019re talking about Beth Greer.\u201d I closed the oven door and straightened, catching the tone in his voice. \u201cYou think she did it? Are you familiar with the case?\u201d \u201cEveryone in Claire Lake is familiar with the Lady Killer case. And I spent five years in the Claire Lake PD. Cops are especially opinionated when it comes to that case. Her acquittal left egg on their faces and two unsolved murders that have never been closed.\u201d The fact that Michael was a former cop was one of the reasons I\u2019d hired him. I\u2019d wondered why he wasn\u2019t a cop anymore, but it seemed like a personal thing to ask. \u201cSo you think she did it,\u201d I said. \u201cI think that Beth Greer was indicted for murder,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, yes, sometimes indictments are wrong. But most of the time, they happen for a reason.\u201d \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any forensic evidence.\u201d This was my favorite topic; I could talk about it for hours. \u201cAs in literally none. No hairs, no fibers, no blood, no DNA.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re forgetting that the bullets matched the gun that killed Beth\u2019s father.\u201d \u201cBut they never found that gun. And Beth was nineteen when her father was killed. You think a nineteen-year-old girl shot her father and made it look like a robbery?\u201d \u201cShea, there was a witness to Veerhoever\u2019s murder.\u201d \u201cOne who only briefly saw her in the dark, and admitted on the stand that he\u2019d been drinking that night. The handwriting on the notes didn\u2019t match Beth\u2019s. And no matter how many times they interviewed Beth, they never got a confession or a single slipup in her story.\u201d \u201cWhich just means she was very, very good.\u201d \u201cOh, come on. Cops do the best they can\u2014I know that. But they aren\u2019t infallible.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll admit that the evidence at trial wasn\u2019t as strong as it could have been. And Beth Greer had the best lawyer money could buy. But, Shea, I\u2019ve met sociopaths in my line of work. The smart ones are experts at deception. They can make people believe anything; it\u2019s what they do. Manipulation is how they get through life, because they don\u2019t know any other way. They can lie as easy as breathing, and they\u2019re convincing because they almost believe it themselves. People like that can trap you, and they\u2019re dangerous. You read and write about these cases, but I\u2019ve seen them firsthand.\u201d I thought about my would-be killer, who was sitting in a cell somewhere, likely counting down the days to his parole hearing. I had received a letter from the Department of Corrections, inviting me to come to the hearing and give a victim impact statement. I had buried the letter under a pile of mail, unable to even look at it. \u201cI\u2019ve met terrible people firsthand, too,\u201d I said. \u201cI may not have been a cop like you, but I\u2019ve met them.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Michael said. \u201cI\u2019m just asking you to be careful. In every interaction, Beth Greer is going to try and keep the upper hand. She\u2019s already got you breathless in anticipation, waiting for her to decide. She\u2019s been asked for interviews dozens of times, maybe even hundreds, in the past forty years. Why do you think she chose you?\u201d That stung, but he was right. I wasn\u2019t an author or a reporter or an investigator. I was no one. Why would Beth Greer choose no one? \u201cI guess if she agrees, I\u2019ll ask her,\u201d I said. \u201cShe knows you want information, so she\u2019s going to give some things and withhold others. She\u2019s going to meet with you on her terms. She\u2019s going to lead you where she wants you to go.\u201d Logically, I knew he had a point. I wrote about sociopaths and psychopaths almost every night; I had a layman\u2019s understanding of how they worked, like any normal woman who had a first edition of Small Sacrifices on her bookshelf. I knew that even though Beth was a woman over sixty, there was no guarantee that she wasn\u2019t dangerous. The problem was that I wasn\u2019t completely convinced she was a killer in the first place. \u201cIf Beth were a man,\u201d Michael said, \u201cyou would never have approached her.\u201d I laughed, even though his insight was as sharp as always. \u201cI can\u2019t even approach you, and I\u2019ve been working with you for over a year.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a serial killer,\u201d he said. \u201cSee, that\u2019s exactly what a serial killer would say.\u201d \u201cA fair point. Do you want to run my fingerprints and DNA? I can probably arrange something.\u201d The oven timer beeped, and I turned it off. \u201cThat\u2019s what a serial killer would say, too,\u201d I said. \u201cMake a grandiose promise he can\u2019t keep, because it sounds so convincing.\u201d \u201cAll right. I\u2019m offended, but at least you\u2019re thinking the way I want you to think when it comes to Beth Greer.\u201d I promised him I would be careful, and I hung up. But as I pulled my lonely dinner out of the oven, listening to the wind splatter rain against my windows\u2014as I prepared for yet another lonely night in the darkness\u2014I admitted to myself that anywhere Beth Greer led me, I was more than willing to go. \u2014 The call came at one in the morning. I had just drifted off when the phone rang on my nightstand. It was a number I didn\u2019t recognize. My heart in my throat\u2014a one a.m. call had to mean Esther or my parents were dead\u2014I answered it. I recognized the voice on the other end immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s Beth.\u201d I sat up. \u201cBeth?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been reading your website,\u201d she said, ignoring the fact that she\u2019d woken me up. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading what you wrote about me.\u201d I rubbed my face in the darkness. When I wrote the article, I\u2019d never imagined it being read by the real Beth Greer. \u201cWhat did you think?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou got some things right and some things wrong. You didn\u2019t talk to Detective Black. Or to Ransom.\u201d Detective Joshua Black had worked the Lady Killer case. Ransom Wells had been Beth\u2019s attorney. Both were still alive, and both were still in Claire Lake. \u201cI tried. Neither of them would talk to me.\u201d \u201cThey will when I tell them to,\u201d Beth said. Her voice carried the perfect confidence of a woman born rich and beautiful, who even now was used to people doing what she wanted. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you telling me you\u2019ll get me access to both of them?\u201d \u201cYes, because I\u2019m going to grant your interview,\u201d Beth said. \u201cWe\u2019ll start on Sunday. Be at the mansion at ten. I don\u2019t cook, I don\u2019t make coffee, and I don\u2019t have servants, so bring your own shit.\u201d There was a click. She had hung up. I stared into the darkness, the dead phone against my ear. It was happening. I was going to talk to Beth Greer. \n CHAPTER SEVEN September 2017 BETH Beth Greer hung up the phone and put it on the bed next to her. Then she stared into the darkness. She was in the master bedroom of the Greer mansion. Forty-five years ago, this had been her parents\u2019 bedroom. This very bed had been their actual bed. Beth had never replaced it. That was strange, she knew. The bed was old now, with a musty smell. The blankets were gray from hundreds of washes. On the nightstand was her father\u2019s ashtray, huge and heavy glass, and on the dresser was a jar of her mother\u2019s cold cream, nearly fifty years old now, long dried out and desiccated. At least Beth\u2019s pajamas were her own, fine silk ones that were the best money could buy. They were kept in a dresser drawer atop her mother\u2019s old nightgowns. Beth drew her knees up to her chest, hugged them. She hadn\u2019t taken a sleeping pill tonight; she\u2019d been on the internet on her laptop, reading Shea Collins\u2019s article about her, and she\u2019d lost track of time. Now it was late, too late. She could take a pill now, but she\u2019d still hear the noises before she dropped to sleep. It was best to take the pill before the noises started, so you didn\u2019t hear them at all. Something moved in the hallway outside. It was a soft sound, and Beth\u2019s fingers squeezed the blanket, a reflex. She was used to the fear\u2014she\u2019d been living with it for so long. Decade after decade. For as long as she could remember, really. All the way back. She didn\u2019t know what a life without fear would look like. Beth knew the contours of fear intimately, its shifting shapes, its taste and its smell. You\u2019re not leaving. You\u2019re not talking. Those were the rules. But she was about to break the second one, wasn\u2019t she? She was going to talk\u2014to Shea Collins, who had read so much about her. Who knew everything and nothing at all. There was a footstep in the hall outside the room, and a dragging sound. Beth closed her eyes, even though it made no difference in the pitch-blackness. She had turned the lock on the bedroom door. She had. She remembered doing it, remembered the cool feel of the latch against her fingers. Or was she remembering last night? Or the night before? The pills were on the nightstand, but she couldn\u2019t take one now. Not until she was sure about the door. Because if the door was unlocked, she didn\u2019t want to be asleep when the thing outside came in. So she waited, listening. The dragging sound came again, and then there was the soft click of a doorknob, followed by the creak of a door. That was the bathroom down the hall. The dragging again, the click, the creak. That was Beth\u2019s teenage bedroom. One by one, each door was being tried, opened. Then the next. Then the next. Until it came to the door of the master bedroom, at the very end of the hall. Beth knew she should get up, run to the door, and make sure it was locked. But it was too late now. She couldn\u2019t make herself move. The dragging sound came closer now. Then the click. The doorknob to the master bedroom, being tried. Moving one way, then the other. Beth closed her eyes. You\u2019re not leaving. You\u2019re not talking. But things were changing. The fever of madness was about to break after all this time, and it was going to be messy. People would get hurt. That was what happened when you were touched by madness. You got hurt. Beth knew all about madness. Click. Click. The doorknob turned one way, then the other. Then one way again. Then the other. It didn\u2019t open, because the door was locked. Beth lunged for the bottle of pills on the nightstand as a voice rose in the hallway. A wail of despair, rising up and up. Then weeping. \u201cPlease,\u201d the voice said. \u201cPlease.\u201d It isn\u2019t real, Beth told herself as she dry-swallowed the pill. She\u2019s been dead for so long. It isn\u2019t real. \u201cPlease,\u201d the voice wailed in the hall. Something jerked the doorknob hard, the click loud, but the lock held. Beth Greer pushed the covers down and slid under them. None of this was real. The pill would kick in, and all of this would be gone in the morning, like a dream. She closed her eyes and waited for sleep as outside in the hall, her mother wept and wept. \n CHAPTER EIGHT October 1977 BETH The man sitting across from her put a cassette in the tape recorder on the desk and pressed the button. \u201cIt\u2019s the twentieth of October, 1977,\u201d he said as the tape turned. \u201cMy name is Detective Joshua Black, Claire Lake Police. Present are Detective Melvin Washington of the Oregon State Police and Elizabeth Greer. We are in the Claire Lake Police Department interview room. Miss Greer, do you agree to this interview being recorded?\u201d Beth kept her hands still in her lap. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d \u201cPlease state your age for the record.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m twenty-three.\u201d \u201cAnd you are here voluntarily and are not under arrest. Is that correct?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d Detective Black paused for a second, then nodded. He was in his early thirties, with thick brown hair worn just long enough to curl. She recognized him from the newspapers, especially the photo in the paper the morning after the first murder. It was taken from across the road from the murder scene and showed a car parked at the side of the road, a body under a sheet on the ground near it. Standing next to the car, wearing a dark coat, frowning at the ground, had been this man, who was sitting across from her now. She\u2019d recognized him when he came to the door with his partner and asked her to come to the station. He was good-looking and clean-shaven, unlike his partner, Detective Washington, who stood leaning against the wall behind him, glaring at her from behind his heavy mustache. Beth crossed her arms over the buttons of her blouse. It was cold in here, and she\u2019d already noticed Washington giving her the once-over. \u201cOkay,\u201d Detective Black said. \u201cMiss Greer\u2014\u201d \u201cMy name is Beth.\u201d He blinked, then said, \u201cOkay, then, let\u2019s get started. Can you tell us your whereabouts on the evening of October fifteenth, five days ago?\u201d \u201cI was home.\u201d \u201cTake your time and think. Are you certain?\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019m certain.\u201d \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d This was Washington, his gaze fixed on her. His fingers drummed impatiently on the leg of his pants for a second, then stopped. \u201cWhat were you doing, exactly?\u201d Beth tried not to flinch. \u201cI was drinking,\u201d she said. \u201cAlone?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She was messing this up, her nerves scrambling her thoughts, making her doubt herself. \u201cYes, I was alone. I was drinking.\u201d Washington\u2019s eyes narrowed in disapproval. Beth was used to that look. Everyone gave it to her\u2014strangers, grocery store clerks, the neighbors in Arlen Heights that she had the misfortune to cross paths with. It was a look that said, You\u2019re twenty-three and one of the wealthiest people in town, you have everything, and all you do is drink and party. You ought to be ashamed. No one cared that her parents were dead, that rich didn\u2019t mean happy. No one cared that she lay awake nights, alone in the Greer mansion, imagining noises in the hallway and wondering what was real. The alcohol made all of those feelings go away, at least for a while. Beth was numb to that look, just like she was numb to everything else in her life. \u201cMiss Greer,\u201d the handsome cop said, and even though his voice was gentle and understanding, the numbness fell away for a second. It was replaced with fear, toxic and wrenching, so consuming that Beth felt like screaming. This wasn\u2019t a nightmare she was going to wake up from. These were the police, and this was real. She was here all alone. She looked at Detective Black, waiting for him to say something, unable to speak while she wrestled with the fear. \u201cYou need to think very carefully,\u201d Detective Black said. \u201cI know you say you had a few drinks, that things are fuzzy.\u201d He ignored the derisive snort from his partner. \u201cBut you need to think back very carefully to where you were that night, whether you were with anyone. Whether anyone saw you. Think hard.\u201d Suddenly she could see the whole scene like a photograph: Black sitting at the table wearing a dark brown suit and navy tie, Washington standing against the wall in his shirtsleeves, his striped tie loosened half an inch. It smelled like cigarette smoke in here, though no one was smoking right now. She saw the tape recorder, the bleached lighting, the scratched table. The pen that Black held in his hand, hovering over the notepad on the table as he waited for her to speak. And her, sitting with her arms crossed. She was wearing a deep green blouse and high-waisted jeans, high-heeled zip-up ankle boots on her feet. She had her red hair in a ponytail and gold hoops in her ears. Every cop had watched her as she followed Black and Washington through the station to the interview room. The place had gone silent, conversations hushing in waves. Beth looked like a rich girl, she knew. She was a rich girl. Not the kind of girl who gets hauled into a police station. Rich didn\u2019t mean happy, but no one cared about that, least of all the cops who looked at her and saw the girl who would turn them down if they talked to her in a bar. The girl who would laugh at them if they tried to sleep with her. The girl who might have shot two good family men in the face just for something to do. If she\u2019d done that, she must be crazy. Did they all think she was crazy? \u201cWhat about last night?\u201d Detective Black asked, polite and persistent. \u201cDo you remember where you were last night?\u201d Yes, this was real. Definitely real. She felt the same squeeze of panic she\u2019d felt when she\u2019d seen the aftermath of her father\u2019s dead body on the kitchen floor, the blood everywhere. He\u2019d been taken away by then, but she\u2019d had the feeling that this was really happening, that it wasn\u2019t going to stop, that she couldn\u2019t just close the book or turn off the TV and walk away. That this was the beginning of something bad. \u201cI was home last night,\u201d she said, because it was important. She had to be clear. She couldn\u2019t tell the truth. She couldn\u2019t. Another man had been murdered last night. It was all over the papers. Detective Washington stood forward from the wall he was leaning on. His hand slipped into his pocket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes. \u201cDo you own a black 1966 Buick?\u201d he asked, his voice harsh. They knew the answer already. They must have known before they came to her door. \u201cYes, it\u2019s one of my cars.\u201d She had three. That was how rich she was. It was enraging. She could see it in his eyes. \u201cDid you drive it on October fifteenth?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cYou just said you were drinking and you don\u2019t remember.\u201d \u201cI would know if I drove it.\u201d She\u2019d remember getting in the car, turning the key in the ignition, even if she was drunk. She\u2019d done drunken joyrides before, and she never completely forgot them, no matter how much she\u2019d had. Besides, the morning after the murder the Buick had been parked neatly in the garage alongside the other cars. No way she\u2019d be able to do that while so drunk she had no memory. It was the same this morning. She\u2019d parked the Buick like she always did last night. She definitely remembered that. \u201cPerhaps you wouldn\u2019t know. Perhaps you drove it and don\u2019t remember,\u201d Detective Black said. He really sounded quite sorry that she was here at all, that he was bothering her with this. Along with his good looks, this was probably a tactic that worked on every female murder suspect. She had the thought before she remembered that Claire Lake didn\u2019t have any other murders she could think of, let alone any female suspects. Just these murders. And her. Washington flipped the cigarette pack open, and Black looked at his partner. Just a brief, dark glance, and Washington put the cigarettes away again. There was a mottled flush on his face as he did it\u2014but he did it. Black turned back to Beth and waited for an answer. \u201cI was home,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you know Thomas Armstrong?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cDid you know Paul Veerhoever?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Washington took another step forward. Now he was standing next to his partner, looming over Beth, still angry because his partner had forbidden him to smoke. \u201cDo you own a gun?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cA man walking his dog heard the shots,\u201d Detective Washington said. \u201cHe saw a car that resembled a Buick driving down Claire Lake Road away from the murder. There was a woman driving.\u201d Icy sweat was trickling down her back. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t me,\u201d she said. \u201cClaire Lake Road doesn\u2019t get much traffic,\u201d Detective Black said. \u201cThe woman had long hair and a trench coat. He believes her hair was red. He identified a photo of you.\u201d The fear broke then, like a fever. It reached a certain pressure point, and then it just stopped. It was replaced by anger, the cold rage that seemed too big for her body to contain, too big for her mind. She\u2019d always had a temper, though she rarely let it off its leash. She said the words again, trying not to spit them at him: \u201cThat wasn\u2019t me.\u201d \u201cExcept you don\u2019t know that, because you claim you can\u2019t remember.\u201d Detective Washington\u2019s tone was tight and harsh. \u201cYou were too drunk, or so you say. So how do you know it wasn\u2019t you?\u201d She looked up at him and met his eyes. The anger broke loose, and for a second she thought about how stupid he was. How he had no idea what he was dealing with, and now he was in the way. The words came out of her, cold with fury: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, you idiot. I wasn\u2019t in that fucking car.\u201d There was a second of stunned silence from both men. Panic, they could deal with; trembling fear, they were used to. They even expected lying and clumsy attempts to dodge questions. But anger was something they didn\u2019t expect. It burned pure inside her, like fire fed with oxygen. She knew she should put it out, but instead she held Detective Washington\u2019s gaze and she let it burn. He looked back at her with shocked disgust, as if she were a zoo animal who had pissed on the floor. Anger and profanity. She should have stayed quiet. But the anger was loose now, and she couldn\u2019t find it in herself to be sorry. Detective Black cleared his throat and took over again. \u201cMr. Armstrong and Mr. Veerhoever were shot with .22-caliber bullets. And I know this is confusing to you, because normally we wouldn\u2019t question a nice young lady like yourself about something like this. Normally, you\u2019d be the last person we\u2019d think of.\u201d Beth held still, waiting. In the silence of the room, she could hear the whirring of the tape recorder. Detective Black continued. \u201cYour father died in 1973 in a home invasion. He was shot in the kitchen of your house while he was home alone. He was killed with a .22-caliber weapon. We\u2019re going to pull the ballistics report from those bullets and compare it to these bullets. Do you understand?\u201d This wasn\u2019t happening. Oh, yes, it was. \u201cPerhaps there\u2019s something you\u2019d like to tell us,\u201d Detective Black said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I want to tell you,\u201d she said. A lie, maybe. Part of her wanted to tell him what her life was like. That being drunk kept the ghosts away most of the time, but not all of the time. That the fear ate away at her sometimes, and so did the anger. That she had moments when she wasn\u2019t sure what was real and what wasn\u2019t. But she wasn\u2019t going to talk. Not about her father\u2019s death. Not about anything. Some things needed to stay buried. Some things had to stay buried. \u201cDid you know Thomas Armstrong?\u201d Washington asked her again. \u201cNo,\u201d she said through numb lips. \u201cDid you know Paul Veerhoever?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWere you seeing either of them?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWere the notes from you?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Now the anger had drained, and she was exhausted. She needed a drink. She stood up. \u201cI\u2019m not answering any more questions. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d They let her go\u2014Washington with anger, Black with resignation. She felt the eyes on her as she walked through the station. The conversations quieted again. One cop gave a low whistle. She was almost at the front doors when someone said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be back, sweetheart. Next time will be worse.\u201d She walked outside and paused on the station steps, inhaling the air infused with the smell of the ocean. Getting her equilibrium back now that she wasn\u2019t in that stuffy room anymore, looking at those two men. It was starting. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t survive it. Maybe she deserved it. She headed toward her car to go home. \n CHAPTER NINE September 2017 SHEA There was a photo taken of Beth on October 20, 1977, the day after Paul Veerhoever\u2019s murder. Beth was exiting the Claire Lake police station after being interviewed by the cops. They hadn\u2019t arrested her yet\u2014that would come later, when the police were more certain they had a case they could win. Beth was wearing a dark green blouse tied in a knot at her waist and high-waisted jeans, her hair tied back in a ponytail, gold hoop earrings in her ears. She was alone. Beth\u2019s face was turned as she caught sight of the camera, and in that fleeting moment her eyes were narrowed, the top lids drooping down over the irises, the pupils inky black. She looked beautiful and sexy, and at the same time she looked hard. She looked like a murderess. Beth wasn\u2019t arrested that day, but when that photo ran in the Claire Lake Daily, the town made up its mind. That woman\u2014that uncaring, unfeeling woman\u2014was guilty. Everywhere Beth went between the murders and the arrest, she was photographed. That first photo was the one I pulled up on Saturday morning as I drank my coffee and got out the notes I\u2019d kept from my research on the Lady Killer case. I looked at Beth\u2019s face again, comparing it to the woman I\u2019d talked to in the park. There was no doubt that even though she was beautiful, Beth Greer was not a sweet, innocent victim. There was a steeliness to her that people had found hard to reconcile in a twenty-three-year-old, and that steeliness was still there today. The woman I\u2019d met in the park hadn\u2019t been flustered or even angry to find me following her. She\u2019d simply turned the tables on me until I answered her questions. I\u2019ve met sociopaths in my line of work, Michael had said. The smart ones are experts at deception. Beth Greer, as far as I knew, had never been diagnosed as a sociopath. She had never been examined by a psychiatrist at all. Sociopaths were good liars because they were empty of true human emotion. They knew how to mimic it, but they did so because they never felt it. Anger, grief, fear, empathy\u2014the research suggested that a true sociopath couldn\u2019t feel any of them. When Ransom Wells, Beth\u2019s lawyer, was asked about Beth in an interview in 1989, his only comment was, \u201cI know pure evil when I see it.\u201d I clicked open my browser and played the video clip of Beth getting out of her car in the rain. For the hundredth time, the reporter in the plaid pants and trench coat pursued her, microphone in hand. For the hundredth time, Beth put her hands in the pockets of her coat and faced him. \u201cI\u2019m just a girl who minds her own business,\u201d she said. Was she just tired? Or deep down, was she trying not to smile? \u2014 When I looked out my window after my morning of research, there was a man I didn\u2019t recognize reading in a car in the parking lot. The weather was unsettled, the last of summer giving in to the chill of fall, and clouds moved quickly past the sun, making its dim light dapple on and off. The man was in the small lot nearest my building, sitting in a black Jeep SUV. His face was obscured by a baseball cap. The car was off, and he was reading a book. I wanted to mind my own business, but who sits and reads a book in a parked car? Parents waiting to pick their kids up from school, maybe. That was all I could think of. If he just wanted to read his book, there was a clearing with a park bench twenty feet away. I waited a minute, then two, then five, but the man didn\u2019t leave. Jesus, Shea. I heard my sister Esther\u2019s voice in my head. You just answered your own question. He\u2019s waiting to pick someone up. It\u2019s Saturday morning, and people are living their lives. Mind your own business. I knew I should. But in my mind\u2019s eye, I still saw a car pull up next to me as I walked home from school, the tires crunching gently in the snow as the window rolled down. I heard a voice say, Hi there, are you cold? I heard my mother\u2019s voice say, Always be polite to grown-ups, Shea. That had been a lie\u2014the worst lie I\u2019d ever been told, that children should always be polite to adults. It was a lie that haunted me to this day. I picked up my phone and raised it, thinking to take a picture of the man, his car, and his license plate. Just in case. As my finger hovered over the button, I heard Esther\u2019s voice again, so calm and rational. Shea, have you seen your therapist lately? I hadn\u2019t. The last time was just before the divorce, over a year ago. Despite the fact that I had \u201clingering trauma issues,\u201d as my therapist called them, she felt that I\u2019d made tremendous progress. I was off the medication\u2014her idea. At the time I quit, I had a stable career and a stable marriage, and was living a productive life. You can put this in the past, Shea, my therapist had said. You\u2019re already doing it. It isn\u2019t easy, but people do it all the time. So I stopped going. A month later, my husband, Van, moved out. He had a new girlfriend now. The thought of that made me feel nothing. Hi there, are you cold? Now I lived alone, and a woman alone could never be too careful. I snapped the photo and put my phone away. \u2014 When I left to pick up food for lunch, I smelled smoke. I opened the door of the stairwell to find a woman quickly putting a cigarette out. She was my neighbor from across the hall. We\u2019d met once, briefly, on the day she moved in. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said sheepishly. \u201cI\u2019m trying to quit. I felt like if I snuck one in the stairwell it wouldn\u2019t count, you know?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said, though it wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t have the heart to give her any grief. She was wearing stretched-out yoga pants and a tee, her graying brown hair scraped back into a ponytail. It was the uniform of the recently broken up, yet for some reason she had taken the trouble to put on mascara and line her eyes with dark, precise eyeliner. I\u2019d been in that place, spinning hopelessly between I should do something and I don\u2019t care. \u201cIt\u2019s Alison, right?\u201d I said. She nodded. \u201cAnd you\u2019re Shea.\u201d We both smiled. \u201cI won\u2019t smoke anymore, I promise. It\u2019s just been a hard week.\u201d \u201cI get it.\u201d I took a chance. \u201cYour hard week doesn\u2019t have to do with the man sitting in his car in the parking lot, does it?\u201d She looked surprised, then dismayed. \u201cIs he still there?\u201d She dropped her gaze to the floor. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s my ex. We made plans, but then we had a fight and I changed my mind. Now he\u2019s here and he says he\u2019s waiting for me to come to my senses.\u201d She looked back up at me. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re divorced, too.\u201d \u201cI am.\u201d She gave an awkward laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re too pretty to be divorced.\u201d It was an odd comment, but again, I understood. She was feeling self-conscious about her yoga pants, her messy hair. I wasn\u2019t looking very glamorous myself\u2014I had on jeans, a tee, a fitted cargo jacket, my long hair in its ponytail, almost no makeup\u2014but I was further along this rough road than she was. \u201cMy ex thinks his new girlfriend is prettier,\u201d I said, even though I had no resentment that Van had moved on. I watched Alison\u2019s shoulders relax a little, the crinkles around her eyes ease as she nodded. \u201cFuck him, then,\u201d she said. I nodded. What was the difference, I wondered, between a sociopath and someone who does everyday lying to make other people feel better? \u201cDefinitely,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t come to your senses.\u201d She looked surprised. \u201cYou think?\u201d \u201cI think.\u201d \u201cHe says he misses me, but when we were together I annoyed him like crazy. He never wanted me around. He practically packed my things. So why does he miss me now?\u201d Van had tried a let\u2019s-try-again line two weeks after he left. I was surprised at first, but then I remembered how much he hated shopping and cooking, which he\u2019d left to me. He had probably starved for those first two weeks. \u201cSplitting up is hard,\u201d I said to Alison, \u201cbut if it\u2019s the right thing to do, then it\u2019s worth it.\u201d She stared at the extinguished cigarette in her hand, as if wishing she could relight it. \u201cHe says he wants the cat. He barely noticed we had a cat, so I took it with me when I left, because he wouldn\u2019t get fed otherwise. The cat, I mean.\u201d She frowned. \u201cNow he says he wants to discuss the cat. What does that mean? Who wants to talk to someone so badly that they discuss a cat they don\u2019t care about? Still, I could just give him the cat and he might go away. What do you think I should do?\u201d I thought it over. I thought about what it would be like to be married to someone who sat in a parking lot, reading a book, waiting for you to come to your senses, and give him what he wanted, whether he\u2019d ever said he wanted it or not. I\u2019d rather be single until I died. I shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t go back,\u201d I said, \u201cand don\u2019t give him the cat, either. That\u2019s my advice. But then again, I haven\u2019t seen my therapist in a long time.\u201d She looked shocked at that, and then she nodded. By the time I got in the elevator, I heard her door close without another word. \n CHAPTER TEN September 2017 SHEA On Sunday, the sky was dark and lowering, the air damp. The salt smell blowing in from the ocean was getting stronger as I took the bus to Beth Greer\u2019s neighborhood. Arlen Heights was built on a slope that rose above the marina downtown, ending on a bluff overlooking the water. The wind was sharper here, but the view was beautiful, a vista of the town below and the vast and empty Pacific. My parents had never been rich; my father worked for an auto parts company, and my mother was a substitute teacher. During my childhood, we lived in one of the small houses in Claire Lake, away from the piers and the tourists. As a child, I walked every day through my quiet neighborhood to my school, past well-tended shrubbery and a park with a baseball diamond. Lots of people think that nothing bad ever happens in a place like that, but it isn\u2019t true. Arlen Heights was different. The houses were spread out, set far back from the winding streets, which were kept narrow and rough on purpose, as if that made the place more real. I saw one elderly man with a dog, a woman doing a brisk walk, and no one else as the bus pulled up to the stop. As it drove away, the silence descended. I shifted my messenger bag and walked down the street toward the Greer mansion. I pulled my phone out and texted Michael. I\u2019m on my way to the interview. She isn\u2019t going to kill me, right? Unlikely, he replied. But I can track your phone if it makes you feel better. I thought about it. I had a lot of rules about meeting strangers, but this was Beth Greer. It\u2019s fine, I texted back. She isn\u2019t Ted Bundy. I think. Besides, I have a confession. If Beth Greer murders me, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the worst way to go. His humor, as always, was equally grim. At least you\u2019ll make the history books. I\u2019ll make sure of it. My fingers hovered over the screen. I had something else to say, but I wasn\u2019t sure what it was. Did I want him to tell me I wasn\u2019t crazy? I already knew there was plenty wrong with me. Maybe I wanted to tell him the truth about me. Maybe I just longed to hear someone say, You\u2019re trying. You\u2019re doing the best you can. Or maybe I really did want him to reassure me that Beth wasn\u2019t going to kill me. She\u2019d been acquitted, after all. But her own lawyer had said of her: I know pure evil when I see it. I was breaking every one of my careful rules. I was going to an accused murderer\u2019s house alone. For someone who lived like I did, this was the height of insanity. And I was looking to Michael, a complete stranger, for reassurance. Statistically, it was Michael who was more likely to be Ted Bundy, not Beth. This is why you don\u2019t have any friends, I thought. Or any actual dates. I had Xanax in my purse, but I didn\u2019t take it. I wanted to be sharp. The Xanax was a gesture from my doctor when I had a series of anxiety attacks after the divorce. Sometimes just knowing you have it lowers the anxiety, she\u2019d said. Just knowing I had pills did not, in fact, lower my anxiety, but I carried them with me anyway, in case the theory started working. I turned up the drive to the Greer mansion, taking in the sight. Something about this house always fascinated me. It was half pseudo-Victorian, half midcentury, an unlikely mix of peaked gables with yellow brick, brown wood, and glass. It was ugly\u2014very, very ugly\u2014but it drew the eye, moving your gaze over one line and then another, as if every time you looked it created itself anew. Julian Greer, Beth\u2019s father, had bought this house and remodeled it. He\u2019d also died in the kitchen, shot by an unknown robber in his home. The lawn was slightly unkempt, as if it hadn\u2019t been tended in a while. Shading the house was a heavy overhang of mature trees, their branches brushing the rooftop and the windows. There was a single car in the driveway\u2014an expensive Lexus\u2014and no other sign of life. The silence seemed to envelop me as I knocked on the front door. Beth answered immediately. She was wearing cream linen pants and a dark brown blouse that was tailored at her narrow waist. For a second, her slim figure and the seventies color combination threw me back in time, until I saw her gray hair with her reading glasses pushed back into it. She looked me up and down. \u201cCome in,\u201d she said. I followed her inside. We walked through a tidy foyer to a living room, an open space that took up much of the lower level of the house. I paused, taking in the decor in surprise. I felt like I\u2019d stepped into an old photo album. The room was large, with floor-to-ceiling windows\u2014now covered with curtains\u2014lining the back wall. A sectional sofa in burnt orange and two matching chairs were arranged around a coffee table. The entire room was a throwback from forty years ago: an olive green knotted rug on the hardwood floor, the sectional low and flat with overstuffed arms, the coffee table made of heavy wood with angled legs. A bookshelf lined one wall, and I glimpsed vintage author names: Leon Uris, Sidney Sheldon, Alex Haley, Jacqueline Susann. There were ashtrays on the end tables, though they had no ashes in them and the room didn\u2019t smell of smoke. The lamps had ceramic bases and triangular shades that were genteelly yellow with age. On a shelf behind the sofa was a ceramic mermaid with red lips and blue eyeshadow, her nipples coyly hidden by seashells. Next to her was a ceramic shepherdess with a crinolined dress and a crook in her hand, her bonnet flopping over her forehead. There were people right this minute who would pay thousands of dollars to get a vintage look like this; the Greer mansion was the real thing. It was clean and tidy, but nothing here had been replaced since before I was born. \u201cI suppose we need some light,\u201d Beth said, walking to the back wall. The curtains were cream with a dark brown diamond pattern, another vintage look that exactly matched Beth\u2019s outfit. For a moment, it was a weird portrait of a midcentury Miss Havisham. I looked down to see a stack of magazines on the credenza next to the door. The top one was an issue of Life from October 1977. The month of the Lady Killer murders. There was the swish of curtains, light filled the room, and I caught my breath. The windows looked over a vista of flat lawn, slightly overgrown like out front. It was an empty square, framed on either side by dark trees, and past the end of the yard the land dropped away sharply, leaving only the dark, bruised sky and emptiness. It looked like a cliff over the edge of the world. \u201cI hate the view,\u201d Beth said matter-of-factly, \u201cbut it\u2019s better than the darkness with the curtains closed. If you want a drink, you can go find something in the kitchen.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I managed, pulling my gaze away from the view. If you walked out onto that lawn, I guessed, you\u2019d be able to see over the edge to the ocean, but you couldn\u2019t see that far from here. Just lawn and sky. I watched Beth pick up a glass of something with clinking ice cubes and take a sip. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a car,\u201d she said as she took a seat on the sofa. She must have seen that I hadn\u2019t parked in the driveway. \u201cI don\u2019t drive,\u201d I said. She narrowed her eyes a little\u2014my tone was harsher than I\u2019d intended\u2014but she let it slide. \u201cLet\u2019s do this,\u201d she said, picking up the glass again. \u201cHow do we start?\u201d I sat in one of the chairs, a little far from her. Neither of us was ready to get close yet. \u201cIs that alcohol?\u201d I asked, maybe because the car question had cut close to the bone. Most people assumed I didn\u2019t drive because I had DUIs that had led to my license being revoked, which wasn\u2019t true. It had happened so often it made me angry. I wanted Beth to be as unnerved as I was. Beth\u2019s smile had very little humor as she answered my question. \u201cNot today. Not for eight years now. If you\u2019d asked me in \u201909, you would have a different answer. And in \u201997 and \u201984. That\u2019s the first scoop for your article, I suppose: Beth Greer has been an on-and-off drunk since 1974 or so. She keeps kicking it, then backsliding, then kicking it again.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s tough,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThird time\u2019s a charm. Before we start, I should tell you that I looked you up.\u201d I was opening my messenger bag, but I stopped. \u201cPardon?\u201d \u201cI had to know that you\u2019re who you say you are. Which, it seems, you are. The name you gave me is real, and you\u2019ve worked for that doctor\u2019s office for five years. I had to make sure you were legitimate before I let you into my house.\u201d It was almost funny. I was worried about being alone with Beth, but it had never occurred to me that she\u2019d worry about being alone with me. \u201cWhat else did you find?\u201d I asked, thinking about what had happened when I was nine. The Incident, I called it. My name hadn\u2019t made the news, as far as I knew. Beth put her drink down. \u201cNot very much. I let you in. If I\u2019m never seen again, then I guess I took my chances.\u201d She looked at my face. \u201cThat\u2019s what you were thinking about me, wasn\u2019t it? That I might kill you?\u201d \u201cYou were acquitted,\u201d I said. To my surprise, she laughed. Her laugh had bitterness in it, but it also had real humor, and for a second I saw the young woman who had captivated the media for a few months in 1977. Whether she was a killer or not, Beth Greer had charisma that was hypnotic to experience in person. \u201cYou don\u2019t quite think I\u2019m innocent, do you?\u201d Beth said. What was I supposed to say? I had to tell her the truth. Our entire interview was about the truth. \u201cI have a lot of questions,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve read so much about this case, and I keep feeling like I can only see a piece of it.\u201d \u201cThen you\u2019re as perceptive as I thought you were,\u201d Beth said. \u201cThe first thing you need to remember is that if there was anything true spoken at that trial, I can\u2019t think of what it is. That trial was all rumors and lies. Did you know they thought I was sleeping with Ransom?\u201d \u201cI read that,\u201d I said. Ransom Wells, Beth\u2019s lawyer, was older than her and a married man, but that didn\u2019t mean much. \u201cI never believed it.\u201d Beth leaned back on the sofa. She was in control of her emotions, but her expression was hard. \u201cThere were rumors I was fucking everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cIn 1977, if you had tits and an ass, you were a piece of meat. And if you got mad about it, everyone thought it was funny. I was a dirty joke\u2014to the cops, to the media, to the judge. The only time they took me seriously was when they thought I might blow their brains out. That was the only time I had them scared.\u201d I stared at her. I couldn\u2019t summon a single word. My blood hummed in my veins, and sweat prickled the back of my neck, harsh yet somehow pleasant. Beth Greer was telling me the truth. It was amazing, and it was terrifying. This\u2014this was what I wanted. This was what made the rest of my life pale into nothingness. This was a high I didn\u2019t think any drug could match. \u201cTell me more,\u201d I said. Beth picked up her drink, the ice cubes clinking some more. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you drive?\u201d she asked instead of answering. \u201cYou\u2019re not a drunk like me, so that\u2019s not the reason. Tell me the real one.\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to tell her. It was my automatic reaction to never tell anyone. Esther knew; so did my parents. My therapists, of course. My ex-husband had only heard the story once after we\u2019d dated six months, and then never again. No one else had heard it, at least from me. So when the words came, I surprised myself. \u201cI was nine,\u201d I said. \u201cI was walking home from school. A man pulled up in his car and asked if I was cold. He said I needed to get in. He said my parents were waiting for me.\u201d I kept my eyes on Beth, watching me. \u201cI got in. After a few minutes, I realized something was wrong. I asked to get out, and when he said no, I begged. He hit me. I started struggling, screaming. He tried to pin me down and make me be quiet, but he was driving at the same time. When he was distracted and the car slowed, I opened the door and jumped out and ran. I told my parents, and eventually the police found him and arrested him. He went to prison.\u201d I took a breath. \u201cHe\u2019s been put away, but it doesn\u2019t matter. He gets out in a few months, and I don\u2019t drive. I don\u2019t feel safe in cars since that day. I hate them.\u201d There was a roaring inside my skull, like someone had opened the hatch of a spaceship. A presence and an absence at the same time. Everything and nothing at once. It was my biggest secret, the thing I never talked about. Ever. I had just told my biggest secret to Beth Greer. I couldn\u2019t read her expression. It didn\u2019t crumple into pity, which was what I\u2019d dreaded. If anything, she looked thoughtful, with no emotion at all. In that moment, she had the face of a woman who just minded her own business, and I had the crazy thought that sometimes it was a relief to be friends with someone who didn\u2019t have any emotions. \u201cIs that the end of the story?\u201d she asked. Cold sweat broke out on my hands, and my stomach turned. For a second, I thought I might throw up. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s the end of the story.\u201d I wondered if she knew I was lying. Who was I kidding? Of course she knew. \n CHAPTER ELEVEN September 2017 SHEA \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, pulling out my cell phone and turning on the recorder. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the Lady Killer murders.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s,\u201d Beth said, her tone dry. I looked at her. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s any point in me asking you if you committed them or not?\u201d She didn\u2019t blink. In the merciless light from the windows, her high cheekbones and large eyes were especially striking. \u201cYou\u2019ll form your own conclusions,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone does.\u201d I looked around at the old-fashioned figurines, the expensive dark wood paneling, the now-vintage print of a racing horse on the wall. \u201cYou were living in this house when it happened,\u201d I said. \u201cAlone.\u201d Beth waited. She had a talent for stillness. \u201cYour parents had died, and you\u2019d been on your own for two years,\u201d I said. \u201cIs there a question in there?\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t you hate it?\u201d I asked. \u201cLiving in this house?\u201d It was oppressive in here. Beautiful in a way, but oppressive. Like the house of someone who\u2019s died. Everywhere you turned, you could see the windows with their cold, bleak view, and even with the light coming in I found myself wishing Beth would close the curtains again. \u201cYour mother must have decorated this place,\u201d I reasoned. \u201cYou were living with your mother\u2019s decorations after she died. You\u2019re still living with them.\u201d I looked back to Beth to see her watching me from her seat on the sofa, her expression unreadable. \u201cNo one has ever asked me that before,\u201d she said. \u201cDid I do it? That\u2019s all anyone wants to know.\u201d \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine it,\u201d I said. \u201cLiving in my parents\u2019 house after they were gone. After all that tragedy. Why didn\u2019t you move?\u201d Her gaze shifted to the windows. \u201cIt\u2019s such an easy thing to say. Just pack up and leave. I\u2019ve said it to myself a thousand times. But some places hold you so that you can\u2019t get free. They squeeze you like a fist.\u201d She turned back to me, something quietly stark behind her eyes. \u201cSometimes you just get stuck. For years, even. Like you and your silly car phobia.\u201d I opened my mouth to get defensive: My phobia isn\u2019t silly. But I stopped myself, sensing a trap. Was this misdirection? If so, from what? I cleared my throat. \u201cI suppose it would be hard to leave the house your parents lived in.\u201d Beth seemed almost amused at that, though I didn\u2019t know why. \u201cAre your parents dead?\u201d she asked. I shook my head. \u201cNo, they\u2019re in Florida.\u201d The ghost of a smile touched the corner of her mouth. \u201cShould I bother making a joke about how that\u2019s the same thing?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think you need to.\u201d \u201cThen I\u2019ll refrain.\u201d She was charming. Really charming. According to everything I\u2019d read, sociopaths often were. I had to remember that. \u201cWhat was it like for you at that time?\u201d I asked her. \u201cAfter your parents\u2019 deaths, and before the murders?\u201d \u201cI was numb,\u201d Beth said. \u201cI was nineteen when my father died, twenty-one when my mother died. In 1977, you didn\u2019t go to therapy or grief counseling. I was a legal adult and I\u2019d inherited a lot of money, so everyone assumed I must be just fine. There was no one to look out for me, and I didn\u2019t know how to look out for myself. There were some people my age that I knew, people my parents would have hated. They started showing up, or maybe I invited them\u2014I don\u2019t remember. They\u2019d come here, and we\u2019d drink. Or I\u2019d go to a party and we\u2019d drink. There was no one to stop me, and it never crossed my mind to stop myself. I just knew I didn\u2019t want to be sober.\u201d \u201cThe papers portrayed it like you were partying without any guilt,\u201d I said. \u201cOf course they did. I told you, I had tits and an ass, so I wasn\u2019t a real person. A girl who had lost her parents couldn\u2019t possibly be spiraling, unable to cope. Easier to write that she\u2019s a slut. It sells more papers. The cops, too\u2014they all thought the fact that I drank and partied meant I was evil. If I were a man, they would have had sympathy. They probably would have joined me.\u201d \u201cEven Detective Black?\u201d I asked. Detective Joshua Black had been one of the two main investigators on the Lady Killer case, and he\u2019d gone on to be a detective for thirty more years. I\u2019d seen dozens of photos of him from that time: young, dark-haired, suits with wide lapels and wide striped ties, a serious frown on his face every time he saw a camera. Frankly, he had been kind of hot. I knew he still lived in Claire Lake, though he was now retired. His partner on the Lady Killer case, Detective Melvin Washington, had died in 1980. I\u2019d never had any luck getting an interview with Detective Black or getting any copies of the Lady Killer case file. According to the Claire Lake PD, the case was still open, which meant the files weren\u2019t public. \u201cBlack was a cop,\u201d Beth said. \u201cHe still is, even though he pretends he\u2019s retired. He\u2019s always been too nosy for his own good.\u201d \u201cI think cops are supposed to be nosy,\u201d I said, thinking of Michael. \u201cIt\u2019s different when it\u2019s directed at you,\u201d Beth said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re sitting in a cold room in a police station with a bunch of men asking you about your sex life. I didn\u2019t even have a sex life to speak of, as a matter of fact. I know the story goes that everyone was screwing like crazy in the seventies, but I had to be careful. I was terrified of ending up like my mother.\u201d \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I asked. I knew almost nothing about Beth\u2019s mother. \u201cWhy were you scared of ending up like your mother?\u201d Beth raised her glass and drained it. Maybe I was imagining things, but I thought she was stalling for time, maybe because she regretted she\u2019d said that. \u201cMy mother never wanted to get married,\u201d she said at last. \u201cBut it was the fifties, and my grandparents were rich. They expected her to marry well. She met my father, and that was that. More of a business deal than anything else. And a year later, she had me. She was trapped.\u201d I watched Beth\u2019s face. The pain etched on it was buried deep, but I thought it was real. I also thought she didn\u2019t want to talk about this anymore. \u201cWhere\u2019s your bathroom?\u201d I asked, just to get a breather for both of us. \u201cDown the hall to the right.\u201d Beth looked up, and her gaze moved past me, to something over my shoulder. Her eyes were unbearably bleak for a moment, and I wondered what she was thinking. Then she broke the gaze, looked at me, and held up her glass. \u201cGet me a drink in the kitchen while you\u2019re up, if you don\u2019t mind. Grapefruit juice and soda, with ice.\u201d That voice\u2014her I\u2019m-rich, people-do-what-I-say voice\u2014it should have annoyed me. But instead it didn\u2019t occur to me to question her. I took the glass from her hand and stood. Beth\u2019s gaze moved past me again, and I had the uncanny feeling that someone was behind me. But I turned and no one was there. There was just the heavy furniture, the cold light from the windows, the old print on the wall next to the doorway to the corridor. I walked down the hall. The bathroom had a beige tile floor and a heavy sink, the taps inlaid with turquoise. It was spotlessly clean, not a hint of clutter. I glanced at myself in the mirror, also framed with turquoise. I didn\u2019t look any different than I normally did. I was tempted to open the medicine cabinet behind the mirror and snoop through it, but I didn\u2019t. I dried my hands and left the bathroom, wandering to the kitchen. This was also unchanged from the late seventies, though like the bathroom it was perfectly clean. The cupboards were pale blue, and the counters were dark brown. The laminate floor was cream. The windows over the sink looked to the side of the house, which was crowded with trees. From here you couldn\u2019t see that end-of-the-world view, or the ocean, or the road. Just thick trees, as if you were isolated in the woods somewhere. I put the glass down on the counter and realized that this was where Beth\u2019s father had been murdered, where a maid had found his body when she came to clean the house. My spine went cold, and behind me I heard a noise. A squeak, and then rushing. Water. Someone had turned on a tap. Maybe Beth was in the bathroom, though I hadn\u2019t heard her get up and follow me. I stepped back to the kitchen entrance and looked down the hall. The bathroom door was open, the sound of the running water coming from inside. I walked into the hall and looked. The water was running in the bathroom sink, both taps turned on. But there was no one there. \u201cBeth?\u201d I said. \u201cAre you getting my drink?\u201d Beth\u2019s voice came from the living room. I hadn\u2019t turned those taps on, and neither had she. Steeling myself, I walked briskly into the bathroom, turned the taps off, and went back to the kitchen. I opened the fridge, poured Beth\u2019s grapefruit juice. Added soda, then opened the freezer and added ice. There was almost no food in the fridge except for a few take-out containers and premade meals. No wine or other alcohol, either. The fridge must have been on some ultrahigh setting, because I was struck with an icy blast that I imagined I could even feel on my back. My fingers were so cold they were clumsy, though I moved as fast as I could, my stomach turning uneasily as I put everything in Beth\u2019s glass. I finished with the drink, closed the freezer, picked up the glass, and turned around. Then I stood still, my breath in my throat. All of the cupboards behind my back were open. Four doors above the kitchen counter that hadn\u2019t been open when I walked in. Four more doors on the lower level beneath the counter. They had all swung open to the same precise degree, the doors aligned like soldiers. The entire room was silent, and nothing moved. It wasn\u2019t Beth. It wasn\u2019t me. It wasn\u2019t anyone. A cold draft hit me again, this time a breeze. As if a window had been left open somewhere. But why would the air be so cold? It wasn\u2019t that cold outside. And yet the wind was so distinct I felt it lift the tendrils of hair that weren\u2019t tied back in my ponytail. In the bathroom, the taps turned on again. I stood frozen, holding the drink forgotten in my hand, listening to that sound as my heart hammered in my chest. For a second, I felt like I had gone back in time to the seventies, to the house\u2019s heyday. I would walk out of this kitchen and find a different world, one filled with Jell-O salads and The Waltons on TV. Except the Greer mansion wasn\u2019t a house of rosy brown and orange nostalgia. A man had been murdered here. Right where I was standing. I put the drink on the counter and walked to the bathroom again, my feet moving mechanically. I almost expected to see Beth in there\u2014except a teenage Beth, slim and youthful, wearing a T-shirt and jeans with embroidery on the pockets, her hair long down her back. But just like before, there was no one there. I put my hand on the tap, and blood splashed into the bowl of the sink. It mixed with the water, red and rancid, swirling down the drain. I jerked my hand away. I wasn\u2019t bleeding. Yet the blood still ran, as if someone were dumping it into the water, or rinsing bloody hands. The cold air hit the back of my neck, along with a rotten metallic smell, and I nearly gagged. In one quick motion, I twisted the taps off. Then I went back to the kitchen, grabbed the drink with a numb hand, and walked back to the living room. Beth was still on the sofa, waiting. She looked at me curiously. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d I said, trying not to think about what I\u2019d just seen. The living room was stuffy, with no sign of a breeze. I handed Beth her drink. \u201cThis house . . .\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s horrible, I know.\u201d Beth took the glass and put it next to her. \u201cLet\u2019s continue. What else did you want to ask me?\u201d My phone was still sitting on the table. I hadn\u2019t stopped the recording when I left the room. I picked it up and saw that it was paused. \u201cDid you stop this?\u201d I asked her. \u201cNo,\u201d Beth said. Her expression was calm as she looked at me. \u201cYou look pale, Shea. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d \n CHAPTER TWELVE October 1977 BETH The Greer mansion, Beth thought, must be worth a lot of money. Her father had spared no expense when he\u2019d renovated the place. Her mother had bought expensive furniture and decor. It was supposed to be the nicest, most beautiful house in the city. Beth figured she should probably burn it down. All of Arlen Heights was oppressive and gloomy this morning, the rain coming down on the carefully untended streets. The interview with the police detectives had been the day before. Since then, Beth had been driving, spending endless hours behind the wheel of her car. Searching, searching. She\u2019d barely slept, and even though she was sober, she still had a headache behind her eyes that felt a lot like a hangover. She didn\u2019t want to go home. Just keep control, Beth. You can handle this. Just keep control. She\u2019d finally decided to come home and try to sleep. She felt jumpy and wild, unable to sit still, but when the Greer mansion came in sight, a chill descended. There was a car in her driveway, a big sixties Chevy, floating like a freighter. She\u2019d know that car anywhere. And parked on the street in front of the house was a van she didn\u2019t recognize. As she pulled into the driveway behind the Chevy, a man got out of the van, carrying a microphone. He was followed by another man with a camera on his shoulder. Now she wasn\u2019t jumpy anymore. Now she was just angry. It was cold, her anger. Her parents\u2019 anger had always burned hot, especially when they shouted at each other. Then they\u2019d both storm out of the house, leaving Beth alone, and everything would go cold and silent. Beth had learned early which one she preferred. Which one kept her calm and served her purposes when she needed it instead of making her surrender control. \u201cMiss Greer!\u201d The reporter was coming up the drive as she opened her car door and got out. The cameraman hurried behind him, only able to go so far before he ran out of cable. \u201cMiss Greer!\u201d the reporter shouted. \u201cDo you have anything to say about the murder accusations against you? Are you the Lady Killer?\u201d Beth closed the car door behind her. She shoved her hands in her pockets, because she couldn\u2019t think of anything else to do with them. Part of her thought that if she left her hands free, she\u2019d slap the man across the face, right there on camera. It was the same anger she\u2019d felt during the police interview, but this time she kept her foot on its neck by sheer force of will as it struggled to get free. The camera was pointed at her, a large bulky thing that was snarled with cables and a huge lens. The reporter had his microphone pointed at her face. Beth savored the feeling of her anger, the cold in her bones. She leaned toward the microphone and said, \u201cI\u2019m just a girl who minds her own business.\u201d Then she turned away and walked up the drive where the camera couldn\u2019t follow her. She circled the house to the backyard, where she knew Ransom would be. \u2014 He wouldn\u2019t be in the house. He had never said as much, but Ransom Wells hated this house as much as Beth did. Beth walked past the dripping trees to the open lawn that led to the cliff over the sea. It was a view of flat green grass and churning, dark blue ocean far away off the shore, birds wheeling in the sky overhead. She shivered. The rain was letting up, but it was always cold back here, no matter what time of year it was. Standing on the lawn was a man well over six feet tall, with big shoulders and a big body to match his height. His hair and beard were salt-and-pepper, though he was only in his thirties. He was wearing a suit and an overcoat. He seemed oblivious to the rain, like most of the lifetime residents of Claire Lake. He looked exactly the same as the last time she saw him, after her mother died two years ago. At that time, he\u2019d told her she was hiring him whether she wanted to or not. I don\u2019t need a lawyer, she\u2019d replied. And he\u2019d said: You\u2019re young, you\u2019re beautiful, and as of now you\u2019re alone and very rich. My dear, you need a lawyer more than anything. \u201cRansom,\u201d she said now, approaching him across the grass. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He didn\u2019t reply until she was standing next to him. \u201cThis is a beautiful view,\u201d he said. \u201cYour father always loved it.\u201d Beth waited. Ransom had a newspaper, now damp, folded under one arm. She tucked a windblown lock of hair behind her ear as the anger she\u2019d felt for the reporter drained away. When Ransom had something to say, there was no power on earth that would make him say it faster. Finally, Ransom spoke again. \u201cI first met your father when he called me up to make an impaired driving charge go away. Did you know that? Not the most illustrious meeting.\u201d His brows drew together as he looked at the ocean. He wasn\u2019t a handsome man, exactly, but he was hard to look away from. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d like him, but I did. I got him off the drunk driving charge, because I\u2019m good and that\u2019s the way the world works. I\u2019ve been sorry for his loss every day since he died. Literally every day. I\u2019m as puzzled by that as you are.\u201d Beth swallowed and looked at the trees. Her father had been complicated\u2014unhappy, sometimes angry. In his own way, as trapped as her mother was. For a long time, during the years of alcohol-fueled fights and lonely Christmases, she had hated him. Part of her still did. But she had loved him, too. She had wished, with the stupid wistfulness of a daughter, that she could have been the one to make him happy. But she wasn\u2019t. She could never be. Fixing her father hadn\u2019t been possible. She turned back to see Ransom looking at her. He\u2019d been her father\u2019s lawyer, and then her mother\u2019s, and now hers. He was as familiar to her as a tool she used every day. She knew he had a wife who left him frequently\u2014he always got her back\u2014and three kids. He liked steak and loathed cigarettes, claiming the smell made him sick. She hadn\u2019t seen him in two years, but she knew all of those things were still true. \u201cYou need a lawyer,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d He took the newspaper from under his arm and handed it to her. Reluctantly, Beth took it and opened it. It was this morning\u2019s Claire Lake Daily, spattered with rain and hot off the press, and the headline read do police have a suspect in the \u201clady killer\u201d murders? Beneath it was a photo of Beth leaving the police station after the interview yesterday. She\u2019d been surprised by the man standing outside with a camera, and he\u2019d caught her looking pale and hard, hostility in her eyes. Even Beth looked at that photo and could easily see a murderer. A trick of the light, the random angle of her face, the surprise and anger mixed in her features, and she looked guilty as hell. She\u2019d probably looked guilty as hell on camera just now, too. It all added more fuel to the fire. Beth stared at the words in the headline again. They threatened to blur and jumble in front of her face. Things were moving now, going faster, as if sliding downhill. None of it was under her control. \u201cDo you have anything to say to me, Beth?\u201d Ransom asked, cutting through her haze of anger and panic. \u201cThey think I did it,\u201d Beth said, because she couldn\u2019t tell Ransom the truth. He already knew some of it; he\u2019d been the family lawyer for too long not to know the buried secrets. But there were other secrets that were too dangerous for even Ransom to know. \u201cThe police, I mean. They think I killed those men.\u201d \u201cAnd yet they didn\u2019t arrest you,\u201d Ransom pointed out calmly. \u201cThat means they\u2019re still fishing. They\u2019ll pressure you as much as they can while they build their case. They\u2019re hoping you give in, get scared, start weeping or cracking. They\u2019re looking for vulnerable spots. Something tells me they\u2019re looking in vain.\u201d Beth folded the paper, unable to stare at the words anymore, the photo of her murderous face. Everyone thought she had it together. Well, she may as well play the part. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell them anything because I don\u2019t know anything.\u201d Ransom tutted. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have talked to them without me. Always call your lawyer first, Beth. But it\u2019s no matter. I\u2019ll have whatever you said discredited so thoroughly no one will even be sure you said it in the first place. What can you tell me about the cops? Are we dealing with any level of competence?\u201d It hadn\u2019t occurred to Beth that she would gain her own information from that interview. Maybe she should start thinking like a criminal. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re both competent. Black is younger, but he has more authority somehow. He wouldn\u2019t let the other one smoke during the interview.\u201d \u201cCompetent and righteous. A deadly combination. I\u2019ll keep it in mind.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t need you.\u201d She didn\u2019t need anyone. She couldn\u2019t. Even now, with everything going to hell. Ransom was unfazed. \u201cYes, you do. Where were you on the nights of the murders?\u201d \u201cHome.\u201d \u201cWas anyone with you?\u201d Beth shook her head. \u201cYou were out just now, when I got here.\u201d \u201cI was driving around.\u201d \u201cAlone?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d She\u2019d been searching. But she wasn\u2019t going to tell Ransom that. \u201cWe\u2019ll work on it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat to tell them. What to say. When to shut up, which is most of the time. Tell me everything they asked you, everything you said. Everything they told you.\u201d She did. She remembered every word so easily. It was the only thing she had thought about since she walked out of the police station. Ransom listened, then gave his judgment: \u201cIt could be worse, and it could be better. You have me now. How much money do you have left of your parents\u2019 inheritance?\u201d \u201cJust about all of it.\u201d \u201cGood, because I\u2019ll need a retainer.\u201d As if there was never a question of hiring anyone other than him. Because in all honesty, there wasn\u2019t. \u201cYou can swim through this, Beth. But it\u2019s a sensational case, and like it or not, you\u2019re a sensational young woman. This is going to get ugly.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d Two years. Two years she\u2019d been doing\u2014what? Drinking, spending time with the wrong people. Sleeping with her eyes open, thinking that after her mother\u2019s death nothing in her life could get worse. Thinking that the worst of it was over. All of this was her fault. Her life, as she knew it, was over. There was some relief in that, because she hadn\u2019t liked her life much. But what was waiting for her was not going to be any better. \u201cDid you tell the police about your mother?\u201d Ransom asked. \u201cAbout her history?\u201d The words gave her chills. It had been years since this topic had come up. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d \u201cI thought things were settled,\u201d Ransom said, looking out over the ocean, \u201cbut perhaps I was wrong. I can make some inquiries.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d Beth said. Ransom looked pained, but he nodded. Years of history passed between them, unspoken. Do you think I\u2019m a murderer? Beth wanted to ask him. A moment of weakness. Just one moment. Say it. Say that you don\u2019t think I killed those men. Please. But he didn\u2019t say that, and instead of asking, she said, \u201cI can handle it.\u201d Ransom took the newspaper from her and put it back under his arm. \u201cI\u2019ll never understand why Mariana made the choices she did. They must have seemed like the only choices possible to her, I suppose. Still, now she\u2019s gone, and we have to deal with the fallout.\u201d He glanced at Beth. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest. Because of all the times in your life, now is the time for honesty. Could I believe that you did it? That you killed those men, just by looking at you? Yes, I can believe it. Easily. It\u2019s a good thing I can believe it, because I\u2019m going to look at all the same angles as someone who thinks you\u2019re guilty. And you\u2019re going to get a fair trial.\u201d The wind stung Beth\u2019s face, crawled down her neck. She looked at the ocean. \u201cJulian died in that house,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cThere are times I look at it and I can still see him, standing in a hallway or coming out the front door. I can still see Mariana, too. If I believed in ghosts, which I don\u2019t, I\u2019d believe that those two are still in that house, which is why I can\u2019t bear to go in there. I\u2019d rather stand out here in the rain. But it doesn\u2019t change the fact that they\u2019re dead and their daughter is still alive. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m not going to let the jackals eat you, Beth.\u201d Beth swallowed. \u201cGet me out of this,\u201d she told him. \u201cNot just for me. Get me out of this so I can lay the ghosts to rest.\u201d Ransom paused, and then he nodded. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cI intend to try.\u201d \n CHAPTER THIRTEEN September 2017 SHEA \u201cTelekinesis,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat?\u201d Michael\u2019s tone was thick with disbelief. \u201cTelekinesis,\u201d I said again. \u201cThe ability of a person to move physical objects with their mind. According to the research, it can sometimes be deliberate and sometimes subconscious, brought on by extreme emotion or stress. Some people have even reported telekinetic powers during sleep, when they\u2019re completely unaware of it. The person is asleep, and they\u2019re still making things move.\u201d Michael cleared his throat. I was on the bus, but it was nearly empty and I was sitting at the back, where no one could hear my crazy ranting. \u201cShea, you\u2019re trying to tell me that Beth Greer isn\u2019t only a serial murderer, she\u2019s also a psychic?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m saying it\u2019s a possibility,\u201d I replied. \u201cThat\u2019s all. I looked up the research, and\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat research? The entire theory is a load of bullshit.\u201d Of course that\u2019s what Michael would think. He was a cop. Deep down, I thought it was bullshit, too\u2014I\u2019d never believed in psychics, ghosts, demonic possessions, or any of it. But still. \u201cI saw what I saw,\u201d I said. \u201cThe taps turned on by themselves, and the cupboard doors opened.\u201d Telekinesis wouldn\u2019t explain the blood I\u2019d seen in the sink, which I hadn\u2019t told Michael about. But there had to be an explanation for that. There had to be. \u201cIt\u2019s an old house,\u201d Michael said. \u201cThe pipes in my apartment make weird moaning noises at night, but that\u2019s all it is. Pipes.\u201d So Michael lived in an apartment. I hadn\u2019t known that. Ever since he\u2019d mentioned a divorce, I\u2019d wondered if he lived in an apartment or if he still lived in their house, if they had one. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t pipes,\u201d I said. \u201cThis was taps being turned on.\u201d \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t telekinesis, either,\u201d Michael said. \u201cMaybe Beth was trying to distract you.\u201d I blinked in shock as the bus turned a corner, heading for downtown. \u201cYou think Beth rigged some kind of deliberate setup?\u201d \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s her house. She\u2019s had forty years to put in any switches or levers that she wants. You\u2019re dealing with a liar, Shea. Please remember that.\u201d I closed my eyes, feeling two distinct sides of myself at war. On the one hand, I absolutely did not believe in ghosts or the supernatural. It was regular, everyday earthly evil that kept me up at night. But on the other hand, to believe it was a fun-house trick was to believe that Beth Greer had some strange, psychopathic wish to deceive me. And\u2014I could admit it to myself\u2014I didn\u2019t want to believe that. I didn\u2019t want to believe she was a liar, and I didn\u2019t want to believe she was a serial killer. Which was exactly what Beth wanted. \u201cI can go over there and check it out, if you like,\u201d Michael said. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cAre you saying no because you don\u2019t want to ask for help from a man?\u201d \u201cThat isn\u2019t it.\u201d That was kind of it. \u201cBeth and I have only just started talking. If I bring someone over to dismantle her house, looking for levers, she\u2019ll stop talking to me.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d Michael said. \u201cThe carrot and the stick. That works entirely in her favor.\u201d Once again, I pictured Michael as an old-school gumshoe, sitting on a park bench somewhere, trying to look casual as he followed a subject. He was holding a newspaper in front of his face, watching from behind it. A turtleneck\u2014I definitely pictured him in a turtleneck. Dark brown, with a blazer over it. The picture was so vivid it felt real. \u201cBeth has held up her end of the bargain so far,\u201d I argued. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to interview Detective Joshua Black right now.\u201d \u201cAt least I don\u2019t have to worry about you when you\u2019re with him,\u201d Michael said. \u201cI envy you, to be honest. Black is a legend in the Claire Lake PD. He\u2019s been retired for years, but they still talk about him. He\u2019s put countless thieves and rapists away, worked every big murder Claire Lake has ever seen. His work on the Sherry Haines murder was practically a textbook on how to catch a killer.\u201d My body went cold and my head went light. There was a thready pulsing sound in my ears. I held the phone, silent. \u201cShea?\u201d Michael said. \u201cAre you there?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I managed. \u201cHe worked . . . He worked that case? I didn\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cSure, he worked it,\u201d Michael said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a big detective force in Claire Lake, and we don\u2019t have that many murders. Especially child murders. You sound strange. Are you all right?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I looked out the window, saw the piers and the water. \u201cThis is my stop. I have to go.\u201d I screwed that up, I thought as I got off the bus and inhaled the cold, salty smell of the ocean. Michael probably thought I was crazy. Then again, he thought that already. I had to forget about it and get a grip for this interview with Joshua Black. Black\u2019s address was one of the houseboats on the downtown piers. I walked along the grid of wooden slats, following the signs with twee names like Ocean Lane and Saltwater Avenue. Black\u2019s boat was trim and tidily kept, though the decorations weren\u2019t overly fussy. A single man\u2019s dwelling. I knocked on the door, and he answered right away. Though Black was over seventy now, he looked a lot like the handsome man I\u2019d seen in photos. He had the same cheekbones and dark eyes, but his hair was white. Still, his face had changed somewhat. It was thinner, the roundness of his young man\u2019s features gone. The effect was just as pleasing, but in a different way. I looked at him and tried to remember if I recognized him, if Detective Black\u2019s was one of the many faces I\u2019d seen after I\u2019d escaped the car when I was nine. If he\u2019d worked the case, been the lead, then I must have been brought to talk to him at some point. But everything was a terrified blur, and there were so many strangers\u2019 faces in the days and weeks that followed the abduction\u2014police, doctors, psychologists, social workers. I\u2019d sat numbly and told my story over and over, gotten in the car with my parents and gone to office after office. I hadn\u2019t known who anyone was, and I hadn\u2019t asked many questions. I had only wanted all of it to be over. But it was almost certain that Detective Black and I had met twenty years ago, that he\u2019d been one of the people to interview me and have me tell my story. It was certain that he knew my name, because I hadn\u2019t changed it. Maybe he\u2019d forgotten; it was a long time ago. But when I looked in his eyes, I knew he hadn\u2019t forgotten at all. \u201cShea Collins?\u201d He held out his hand, and I shook it. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again.\u201d My throat was tight, my tongue clumsy and dry in my mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you,\u201d I said, the words spilling out of me. \u201cNot specifically.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would,\u201d he said. Then he stepped back. \u201cCome in.\u201d The inside of the houseboat was small and neat, a bachelor\u2019s space. There was a sofa and a TV, a coffee table that likely served as a dining table. There was a galley kitchen to the left and a partition with, presumably, a bedroom behind it. From the window over the kitchen sink, I could see nothing but water. \u201cHave a seat,\u201d Black said, indicating the sofa. I sat down, realizing that I was obeying because I thought of him as a cop. The cop who had worked\u2014had solved\u2014the Sherry Haines case. The man who, at some point, had interviewed me. I pressed my palms together between my knees. \u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d Black asked, walking to the galley kitchen. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll get something out of the way first,\u201d he said in the easy manner of a man who has conducted hundreds of interviews with strangers, most of them hostile, as he poured water into his glass. \u201cI remember you from the Sherry Haines case, but we\u2019re not here to talk about that today.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I managed. \u201cI understand. You want to talk about the Lady Killer case. You asked for an interview before, I think. A year or so ago.\u201d I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m a blogger. Not as my day job. As my hobby.\u201d I stopped talking, realizing that for once I was with someone who didn\u2019t need an explanation about why I liked true crime. If anyone would understand, it was Detective Joshua Black. Black turned around, the glass in his hand. \u201cI recognized your name when you made the first request,\u201d he said frankly, \u201cbut I make it a policy never to talk about that case with anyone. This time, though, I got a personal request from Beth to meet with you, and I was too curious to turn it down.\u201d This part had me completely baffled. \u201cYou have a relationship with Beth,\u201d I said, and it didn\u2019t come out as a question. Detective Black leaned against his tiny kitchen counter. \u201cWe live in the same town,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve both lived here all our lives. Claire Lake isn\u2019t a very big place.\u201d \u201cSo even though you investigated her and testified at her murder trial, the two of you are friends.\u201d He laughed, though the sound had little humor in it. Instead I heard layers of complexity I didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWe aren\u2019t friends.\u201d He gestured at the view out the kitchen window. \u201cDid you know that these houseboats were originally put here by Claire Lake\u2019s homeless people?\u201d I blinked. \u201cPardon?\u201d \u201cHard to believe, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He smiled. \u201cIn the early 1960s, the city wanted to put up single-family houses by the lake. They were going to tear down public housing in order to do it, and evict everyone in the neighborhood. No one stopped them, so the city evicted over two hundred people, all of whom had to find somewhere else to live. Some wise soul realized that he could buy a boat that was headed for the junkyard for much cheaper than a house, and also that the city\u2019s zoning laws technically allowed for residential boats off the piers. So a lot of the evicted people, who were now homeless, bought up old boats, anchored them, and lived in them instead.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll bet the city was pleased,\u201d I said. Black smiled again. \u201cThe city was livid, but there was nothing they could do. The zoning laws were on the books. Since then, this area has gentrified so much that only artsy types and retirees like me live here. But the first boats were owned by the poor rabble, the people who had nowhere else to go.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI guess you\u2019re not interested in my Claire Lake history lesson.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s interesting,\u201d I said, which was true. I pulled out my phone. \u201cIs it okay if I record this conversation?\u201d Detective Black looked amused. \u201cSo I\u2019m on the other side of the recording this time. Okay, I give my permission.\u201d I put the phone down, hoping it would pick up the conversation with Black, standing a few feet away. I didn\u2019t want to ask him to sit down in his own house, and I didn\u2019t want to stand up and crowd him. But Black had been a cop for thirty-five years, and I realized his position was deliberate. The thought made me salty, so I said, \u201cI\u2019d love access to the original Lady Killer interview tapes, if you\u2019re feeling generous.\u201d \u201cThe transcripts were leaked online.\u201d Nice try. \u201cOnly sections were leaked. Not the entire tapes.\u201d \u201cTrue, but the leaked sections were pretty relevant.\u201d \u201cAccording to you,\u201d I countered. \u201cThe entire tapes would give a better idea of your interview technique.\u201d \u201cYou mean mine and Detective Washington\u2019s.\u201d I nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad I\u2019m too late to interview him, too.\u201d He gave me a wry look. \u201cYou\u2019d have to time-travel to early 1980 to do that.\u201d His tone said that he hadn\u2019t liked Washington very much. \u201cTell me how you two started working together,\u201d I said. Black\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cYou\u2019re warming me up,\u201d he stated. \u201cGetting me talking before asking what you really want to know. It\u2019s a time-honored technique. You forget you\u2019re dealing with someone who has done this a lot.\u201d For God\u2019s sake, was every single person involved in this case going to be difficult? \u201cI can sit here all day,\u201d I said. That caught me a ghost of a smile. \u201cNow I can see why Beth likes you. Okay. I met Washington for the first time the day after Thomas Armstrong got two bullets to the face. I was one of the only detectives on the Claire Lake force, and I\u2019d never worked a homicide before. We didn\u2019t have many murders. Mostly I worked assaults, robberies, and rapes. I was only thirty-one.\u201d \u201cSo the Claire Lake PD brought in the state police,\u201d I said. Black nodded. \u201cWashington was a state detective. He\u2019d never seen anything quite like the Armstrong case, either, even though he had more experience than me. The murder seemed random, but random murders had been done before. It was the note that threw us.\u201d I nodded. Am I bitter or am I sweet? Ladies can be either. Publish this or there will be more. Everyone who was obsessed with this case knew that note by heart. \u201cWhat did you and Washington think the note meant?\u201d Black\u2019s eyes were looking at something far away now, and the words came easily as he remembered. \u201cWell, the Zodiac had done his business down in San Francisco,\u201d he said, \u201ckilling people at random and mailing notes to the newspapers. So we\u2019d seen a similar MO before. But the Lady Killer note was in a woman\u2019s hand, a rounded cursive with flourishes that the handwriting experts said a man wouldn\u2019t make. The Armstrong murder was heartless and cruel, particularly brutal. Whoever had killed him had looked him in the eye as they shot him in the face. That isn\u2019t a woman\u2019s method.\u201d \u201cAre you going to tell me that poison is a woman\u2019s weapon?\u201d I asked, stating the clich\u00e9. \u201cDiane Downs shot her three kids point-blank, then drove slowly to the hospital, hoping they\u2019d bleed out.\u201d \u201cThat was a few years later,\u201d Black said. \u201cUp in Washington, they had Bundy killing college coeds, and down in California they had Ed Kemper doing the same thing. Monsters, both of them, but they were men. We\u2019d never seen anything like this.\u201d I nodded. As every true-crime lover knows, the seventies were a banquet of particularly brutal serial killers. If you read enough true crime, you started to think that being a young woman back then was a pretty dangerous business. And it was amazing that anyone survived hitchhiking at all. \u201cSo what happened?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe gave the note to the press,\u201d Black said. \u201cWe had to take the chance. It hadn\u2019t worked with the Zodiac\u2014they printed everything he told them to, but he kept killing anyway. But our hands were tied. There was a lot of arguing behind the scenes. Half the cops thought the note was a red herring and we were dealing with a man. The other half thought that the killer was probably a mistress of Armstrong\u2019s, though we couldn\u2019t find evidence of one. No one thought it was actually what it was.\u201d \u201cWhich was?\u201d \u201cA true, bona fide female serial killer.\u201d Black put his glass of water on the counter and stared at it, unseeing. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain how hard that was to process for us in 1977. It\u2019s still hard now. We had no context, no idea what we were dealing with, no idea what to expect. None of us had the slightest bit of training or education in serial murder, let alone female serial murder. It was so unusual that we haven\u2019t had another case like the Lady Killer in forty years. A woman driving around shooting people for fun. We live in a very different society than we did in 1977, but that part hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d \u201cAnd then Paul Veerhoever was killed,\u201d I said. Black nodded, seeming to remember I was there. \u201cVeerhoever had two kids,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019d served six years in the military before an honorable discharge. His wife had had three miscarriages, and he\u2019d been by her side for all of them. The first bullet didn\u2019t kill him\u2014only hit him in the jaw. He was in unimaginable agony until the Lady Killer put a second bullet in his temple and left him by the side of the road.\u201d My mouth was dry. This was what they thought Beth had done. It was this murder that a witness had said he\u2019d seen Beth drive away from. Detective Black walked to the only chair, on the other side of the coffee table, and sat down. Outside, I could hear birds calling over the ocean. The boat rocked gently, and I felt like I was a little drunk. I couldn\u2019t see how anyone could live here\u2014too many ways for someone to break in, too many strangers walking by, no alarm system that I could see\u2014but I had to assume he liked it. Cops, even former cops, could live in places I couldn\u2019t and not worry about it. \u201cThe first time I met Beth was at our first interview,\u201d he said, though I hadn\u2019t asked a question. \u201cThe day after Veerhoever was killed. We had a witness identification by then. I knew who Beth Greer was, though I\u2019d never met her. I knew who her parents were. I knew she lived in Arlen Heights. It seemed unlikely that she was a killer, but, like I say, we had no idea what we were looking for. We didn\u2019t know what a female Zodiac was supposed to look like. And Beth wasn\u2019t like any woman any of us had met.\u201d \u201cShe was young and sexy and smart,\u201d I said. \u201cRich. So that made her a murderer?\u201d Detective Black leaned forward, put his elbows on his knees. \u201cAside from the witness identification, think about this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis killer, whoever they are, can get away scot-free. There\u2019s no connection to the victim, no fingerprints, no hair or fiber evidence, no blood or DNA. No witnesses. This person has just literally gotten away with murder. And she decides to leave a note with her handwriting on it. Paper that could be traced, handwriting that could be analyzed, possibly even fingerprints. Who would do that? Someone with an ego. Someone who thinks she\u2019s smarter than the cops. Someone who thinks she\u2019ll never be caught.\u201d \u201cSomeone who wants to be caught,\u201d I countered. \u201cDeep down, even if she can\u2019t admit it. She wants to be stopped.\u201d \u201cPsychopaths don\u2019t want to be stopped,\u201d Black said. \u201cThey want to keep doing what they\u2019re doing for as long as it gets them off. But they want to laugh at everyone at the same time. They can\u2019t help it. They\u2019re certain that no one will catch them, and a lot of times, they\u2019re right.\u201d \u201cThe second note said \u2018Catch me.\u2019 \u201d \u201cThe second note wasn\u2019t a plea; it was a taunt. Because the writer didn\u2019t believe we could do it. Her ego didn\u2019t let her think it.\u201d I thought of Beth\u2019s commanding rich-girl voice, the way she gave orders like someone who has had money and confidence all her life, and I didn\u2019t answer. \u201cBeth was like an unknown species of bird,\u201d Black said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a wife or a mother or a daughter, or even a true wild child, despite what the rumors said. She wasn\u2019t anything, which meant she could be anything. She wasn\u2019t man-hungry or money-hungry or any other kind of hungry. She drank too much, but she wasn\u2019t on drugs and she didn\u2019t gamble. She was beautiful, she was smart, and she was cold. Self-contained, impossible to crack, at only twenty-three. She had the means and the opportunity. A car and no alibi. And then we ran the ballistics.\u201d The ballistics tests had showed that the gun used to kill Armstrong and Veerhoever had also been used in the home invasion that killed Beth\u2019s father, Julian, when Beth was nineteen. The only time they took me seriously was when they thought I might blow their brains out, Beth had told me. That was the only time I had them scared. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have a motive for any of it,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t always get a motive,\u201d Black replied. \u201cThat\u2019s something you learn in police work. You don\u2019t always get the why, especially with stranger killings. I had a long career after the Lady Killer case, and I worked a lot of cases I didn\u2019t fully understand. But I still closed them.\u201d I thought of the fact that he had worked the Sherry Haines case, and I dropped my gaze to the coffee table. Black had a cop\u2019s knack for reading people, and I didn\u2019t want him to read me. Then I went over what he\u2019d said, ran through the words in my mind. Detective Black had been very careful. He\u2019d talked about the Lady Killer and he\u2019d talked about Beth. But he hadn\u2019t put the two of them into the same sentence. \u201cYou don\u2019t think she did it,\u201d I said, realizing as I spoke that it was true. I looked up to see those cop\u2019s eyes watching me, and I had the feeling they missed nothing. \u201cI was a detective,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw things that no one ever wants to see. I was there that first night, when we were called to Thomas Armstrong\u2019s body at the side of the road. I dedicated my career to fighting evil. Do you honestly think I would take Beth Greer\u2019s phone calls, her requests, if I thought she had killed those men? Do you think I would have any kind of relationship with a serial killer?\u201d He had such conviction, even now, all these years later. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI spent months investigating Beth,\u201d Black said. \u201cI dug up every part of her life, because someone shot Julian Greer, then used the same gun to commit two more murders. After the ballistics report came back, Washington and I found everything we could find on Julian Greer, looking for the connection. Greer\u2019s murder had looked like a straightforward home invasion\u2014the back door of the house was broken open and Greer was shot in the kitchen, his wallet and cash stolen. It was eleven o\u2019clock on a Saturday morning. Mariana was with her bridge club, and Beth said she was out shopping. No one even double-checked her alibi.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI tried every way possible to believe that a nineteen-year-old girl shot her own father, then made it look like a break-in. That would have taken planning, cold blood, and the kind of hate that burns for years.\u201d \u201cMaybe her father was abusive,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s just it. Washington and I went over everything about the man. He was clean. His marriage was unhappy, by all accounts, but that was all we could find. He didn\u2019t have any enemies, personal or professional. His former secretary sobbed when we interviewed her. She still wasn\u2019t over his death. She said that Julian was a wonderful man, but she hated Mariana. She said Mariana had ruined Julian\u2019s life.\u201d I thought that over. I knew almost nothing about Beth\u2019s parents, except that both had had their lives cut short. Beth had told me she didn\u2019t want to end up like her mother\u2014no, she\u2019d said she was terrified of ending up like her mother. She\u2019d said that Mariana was trapped. That sounded pitiful, and it didn\u2019t line up with the secretary\u2019s description. \u201cSo you never figured it out,\u201d I said. \u201cSome detective I am, right?\u201d He actually sounded regretful, as if he hadn\u2019t solved cases and saved people\u2019s lives for thirty-five years. \u201cThe only connection I ever found between the two cases was Beth. Beth lived in that house, and a witness said he saw Beth at Veerhoever\u2019s crime scene. This case outsmarted me in the end. Or maybe Beth did.\u201d \u201cAnd yet you don\u2019t think she\u2019s a serial killer.\u201d My mind was spinning. \u201cMy head hurts.\u201d \u201cWelcome to the Lady Killer case,\u201d Black said wryly. There was a moment of quiet as I rubbed my eyes and thought things over. Black was right\u2014the ballistics match meant that Julian Greer was a part of this somehow. He was, in a way, the first Lady Killer victim. \u201cIs the secretary still alive?\u201d I asked, my eyes still closed. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d Black said. \u201cShe was a young woman then.\u201d \u201cWhat was her name?\u201d \u201cSylvia Bledsoe.\u201d Of course he remembered a name from forty years ago off the top of his head. He was that kind of cop. I dropped my hands and opened my eyes again to find him looking at me. The expression on his face was quietly happy, paternal. My own father had never looked at me like that. When my father looked at me, his expression was either bewildered or tensely pained. \u201cYou\u2019re going to interview her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he said. \u201cIf she\u2019s still alive, I may as well try.\u201d He turned to a kitchen drawer, riffled through it for a notepad and a pen. He wrote something down and handed it to me. It was his phone number. \u201cI can\u2019t give you the case file, because that would be breaking the rules,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you have questions, or you need me, then call me anytime. I\u2019ll tell you everything I can.\u201d I took the number. \u201cWhy are you helping me? Is it because of Beth?\u201d I didn\u2019t like that idea\u2014that Beth was hovering over every aspect of what I was doing, jerking all of the strings. For the first time, Black\u2019s expression went a little hard, and I glimpsed the man who had faced down some of the worst of humanity without fear. \u201cI agreed to this meeting because I wanted to meet the only person my top suspect has ever called me about,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not why I\u2019m helping you. I\u2019m helping you because you\u2019re Girl A.\u201d My heart hammered in my chest. \u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d \u201cWe couldn\u2019t identify you by name in our analysis of the Sherry Haines case,\u201d Black said. \u201cYou were too young, and your identity was protected. But the murder file, the file I worked on, contained your name. I knew your name because I met you. I\u2019m giving you the best chance to finally solve this case because you\u2019re Girl A. Because in forty years, you\u2019re the only one Beth has decided to talk to. If anyone can find what the truth is, I think it\u2019s you.\u201d \n CHAPTER FOURTEEN September 2017 SHEA All that week, I had strange dreams. I\u2019d see the Greer mansion sitting in the rainy gloom, dark and silent, framed by the black-branched trees. I\u2019d see the bleak view out the back windows, looking over the edge of the rise to the ocean, and I\u2019d see the imprints of footprints in the grass. As if someone wanted in\u2014or could already come and go at will\u2014and nothing I could do would stop them. I\u2019d see someone falling over that cliff. A pair of feet leaving the edge, sailing into the cold air above the ocean. I\u2019d feel a cold gust of air from a broken-in door, and I\u2019d see blood spiraling in that sink, red turning pinkish in the water. I\u2019d wake up certain that the taps in my bathroom were turned on, that the curtains on my window had changed position. Then I\u2019d lie awake, alone in the dark, listening for sounds. Was that a footstep? A tap on the roof, as if someone were walking there? Was there someone in my living room right now, prowling quietly? If there was, how stupid was I to get out of bed and go look? By day, I\u2019d sit at the reception desk and wonder if the file cabinets behind me were opening while my back was turned, if the papers were moving from one side of the desk to the other. By night, I waded into the Book of Cold Cases and used my online searching skills to find Sylvia Bledsoe, the woman who had once worked as Julian Greer\u2019s secretary. Because there had to be answers out there somewhere. Anywhere. \u201cCome to dinner,\u201d Esther said to me on the phone one night after work. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of busy.\u201d \u201cDoing what?\u201d I hadn\u2019t told Esther about my meetings with Beth Greer. She wouldn\u2019t know who Beth was, and once I told her, she would probably have an anxiety attack. \u201cMy usual stuff.\u201d \u201cShea, I\u2019m playing my sister card. You know I don\u2019t do it often. Come to dinner.\u201d I caved. I really was tired of sitting here alone, wondering what those sounds were. \u201cOkay. Tomorrow. I\u2019ll come after work.\u201d \u201cYay!\u201d She actually said that, unironically, as a thirty-three-year-old woman. \u201cI\u2019ll make chicken tetrazzini.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d She knew that was my favorite meal, but it wasn\u2019t simple to make. Esther made the sauce from scratch, which immediately made me feel bad. \u201cWe\u2019ll order in. You don\u2019t have to cook. It\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to do it. Besides, we eat out all the time anyway. Will is going to be overjoyed.\u201d I sighed. They were going to make a fuss, or at least Esther was. \u201cYou know, Will has a cute coworker,\u201d Esther was saying. \u201cHe\u2019s single. Maybe I\u2019ll invite him, too.\u201d Oh God. \u201cPlease don\u2019t. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d \u201cI just think\u2014\u201d \u201cEsther, I don\u2019t want to be set up.\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t a setup exactly. It\u2019s just dinner. You can\u2019t be single forever.\u201d \u201cI can. I literally can. That\u2019s a thing.\u201d No one understood single people. If you didn\u2019t have a partner and babies, how were you spending your time? I\u2019d tried the marriage thing, and I\u2019d still been me. Except an unhappy version of me. \u201cOkay,\u201d Esther said, \u201cbut being a spinster isn\u2019t healthy. This guy is a junior lawyer. He\u2019s really nice.\u201d \u201cDid you know that Ted Bundy was executed in 1989, but they didn\u2019t type his DNA until 2011?\u201d I said. Esther paused. I\u2019d surprised her. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cNo one actually knows how many women he murdered,\u201d I said. \u201cWith DNA, they can try and close old cold cases. But it\u2019s taking them years. We could find out about Bundy victims we didn\u2019t even know about.\u201d \u201cShea,\u201d my sister said. \u201cDid you know that Gary Ridgway\u2019s coworkers called him Green River Gary?\u201d I said. \u201cThey teased him about secretly being the Green River Killer. None of them knew that he actually was. He killed almost fifty women. That must have been pretty weird for those guys, reading in the paper that he was arrested, don\u2019t you think?\u201d \u201cShea.\u201d \u201cEsther, if you bring a date to this dinner, I swear I will say those exact things as dinner conversation. Is that what you want?\u201d \u201cOkay, okay, I surrender. You win. It will be just us and the tetrazzini, okay? Come tomorrow.\u201d I opened my mouth to agree, but there was a thump in the hallway outside my door, the sound of something shifting. Then the sound of the stairwell door opening and closing. I wasn\u2019t imagining it this time. \u201cI have to go,\u201d I said to Esther. \u201cSomeone\u2019s at the door.\u201d \u201cOh, good. Maybe it\u2019s a neighbor coming to say hi. Maybe he\u2019s single and good-looking.\u201d \u201cMaybe it\u2019s someone here to murder me. If it is, I leave you my worldly possessions.\u201d \u201cShea.\u201d \u201cTalk soon, sis,\u201d I said, and hung up. I let the joke fall away as I sat in silence, listening. Nothing for a long minute, and then a faint shifting sound, as if someone really was outside the door. I thought I could hear breathing. I stood up, keeping the phone awake in my hand, ready to dial 911. I walked softly to the door, moving quietly so whoever it was wouldn\u2019t hear me approach. I looked out my peephole but saw only the wall across the hallway. Packages were left in the mail room, so it wasn\u2019t UPS or FedEx. Who had a code to the front door of my building? I heard another soft sound. Someone was definitely there. \u201cI\u2019m calling the police,\u201d I said loudly. \u201cYou need to go away now.\u201d Silence. \u201cI\u2019m not opening this door,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get in here. The police will be on their way in thirty seconds. Leave.\u201d Still silence, but I knew there was a presence in the hallway. I dialed nine, waited a beat, then dialed one. Finally, there was a sound. Whiny and growly, rather pissed-off. A cat\u2019s meow. I blinked. Canceled the call. Then I opened the door. In front of my door was a plastic pet carrier and two large shopping bags. As I watched, the cat carrier shifted, as if the cat inside was turning in circles, tired of being trapped. Taped to the top of one of the bags was a note: You were right. I decided not to come to my senses. I\u2019m going to live with my mother for a while. I agree he shouldn\u2019t get the cat. Mom is allergic, so the cat is yours now. Sorry to do this to you, but he\u2019s fixed and he doesn\u2019t bite. I guess you can drop him at a shelter if you have to, but I couldn\u2019t do it. If you keep him, let him sleep on the bed, because he loves it. He\u2019ll do anything you want for tuna treats. Sorry again, Alison P.S. His name is Winston Purrchill. \u2014 He was a gray tabby. Big and sleek, his markings dark, with a white expanse on his throat and chest. His face wasn\u2019t pretty, and one of his ears was slightly bent near the top. When I opened his carrier in my condo, he walked out slowly, looking at me disdainfully from his muddy green eyes. The shopping bags contained food, a litter box, a container of litter, and three packets of the promised tuna treats. I\u2019d never owned a cat before, never had a pet of any kind. I\u2019d never asked for this. What the hell was I supposed to do? For the first time, I called Michael about something that wasn\u2019t murder-related. I\u2019d already had a lecture from Esther, and I didn\u2019t know who else to call. \u201cWhat do you know about cats?\u201d I asked when he answered. \u201cI like them, even though most of them are assholes,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhy? Does this have to do with something you\u2019re working on?\u201d \u201cNo. It has to do with a cat.\u201d I explained what had happened. As I talked, Winston Purrchill sauntered around the perimeter of my condo like he was inspecting it, his gait unconcerned. Then he hopped up to my kitchen table and sat, placing himself directly on top of the file I\u2019d made of the Lady Killer case, where it rested in its permanent place on the table. From there, he regarded me silently, his tail wrapped just so around his feet. \u201cHold on. I\u2019m getting a beer from the fridge,\u201d Michael said. I heard the sound of a fridge door opening, and the hiss of a beer cap being removed. The sound made me think he was wearing flannel. Plaid flannel. And the thought came into my head, as clear as if someone had spoken it: I really need to meet this guy in person, because I think I like him. Michael came back on the line while I was still thinking that over. \u201cAre you going to take this cat to a shelter?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I looked into Winston\u2019s unblinking eyes, lined precisely with black. He seemed to be waiting for an answer, like Michael was. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s too cruel. I\u2019ll keep him for a while.\u201d \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be good for you,\u201d Michael said. \u201cI\u2019d like a pet, but I\u2019m away from the house too much.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just for a while,\u201d I told Winston, so we were both clear. \u201cIf I had a pet, I\u2019d rather have a dog. A dog can ward off intruders.\u201d Winston blinked at me in disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s easy, Shea,\u201d Michael said. \u201cJust feed him and give him somewhere to sleep. A window to look out of. Cats don\u2019t ask for much.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d I reached a hand out. Winston sniffed it, running his nose along my skin. I relaxed my fingers and tried stroking his cheek, then the top of his head. He didn\u2019t object, so I kept going, curling my fingers into a scratching position. Winston tilted his head so my fingers were behind his ear, so I obediently moved them. He closed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting on my file,\u201d I told him. \u201cMe, or the cat?\u201d Michael said. \u201cThe cat. He\u2019s parked himself on my Greer file, and now I don\u2019t want to shoo him off.\u201d \u201cWelcome to pet ownership. And I don\u2019t think you need to go through it again anyway. You know it by heart.\u201d I did. Since my interview with Detective Black, I\u2019d gone over my Greer papers again and again. The last time through, I\u2019d read over the newspaper clippings that were the only public record of Beth Greer\u2019s young life: her parents\u2019 wedding announcement, her own birth announcement, and the brief and respectful notices of her parents\u2019 deaths. Based on the wedding photo, Julian Greer had been tall and handsome, while Mariana was petite and blond, her face much like Beth\u2019s except for a devastating sweetness in her features. They both looked so formal in their wedding photo, and neither of them looked happy. It was unsettling to look at their faces and think of the fact that their marriage would be unhappy and then their lives would end, the groom killed in a home invasion, the bride dead in a car accident two years later. \u201cHave you talked to Beth again?\u201d Michael asked me. \u201cNo.\u201d The interview with Detective Black had left my head spinning, and I wasn\u2019t in a hurry to go back to the Greer mansion after what I\u2019d seen\u2014or what I thought I\u2019d seen there. Aside from that, I wasn\u2019t ready to be in Beth\u2019s orbit again. When I saw her next, I wanted to be ready. \u201cI think I want to find Sylvia Bledsoe first.\u201d \u201cYou mean Sylvia O\u2019Hare, or Sylvia Simpson.\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d Sylvia Bledsoe, the weeping secretary Detective Black had interviewed about Beth\u2019s father, had been married three times. Mr. Bledsoe, her husband when Julian died, was only husband number one. It had taken Michael and me a bit of digging to track her last names through husbands number two and number three. We\u2019d found several Sylvia Simpsons, and I\u2019d either phoned them\u2014when I could find a number\u2014or messaged them through Facebook, hoping to get an interview with the right one. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m spending so much time on this,\u201d I said, scratching Winston behind his other ear as his eyes drifted closed in bliss. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a dead end. What do I think I\u2019m going to learn from her?\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t know until you talk to her,\u201d Michael said. \u201cI\u2019m here to help, Shea. Just say the word and I\u2019ll come to the meeting with you.\u201d Meet Michael in person, face-to-face? Panic twisted through my stomach. The stupid reaction I always had. Now, on top of my usual day-to-day paranoia, I had the fear that Michael in person wouldn\u2019t live up to my imagination of him\u2014and that I would disappoint him, too. Yet part of me wanted to see him at last, and part of me really did want his help. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d I looked Winston in the eyes as I said it, getting confidence from the calm way he watched me. Of course you can do it, his expression said to me. What\u2019s the big deal? \u201cYou think about it, Shea,\u201d Michael said. \u201cIn the meantime, I\u2019ll get back to work.\u201d \n CHAPTER FIFTEEN September 2017 BETH Sometimes, even now, Beth got the idea that she could leave. Why not? She had money, a car. There was nothing stopping her. She could simply go. So she would get in her car and drive. She\u2019d put her foot on the gas and form a plan in her mind, and yet somehow, no matter where she thought she was going, she always ended up at the lake. She\u2019d find herself standing next to her parked car, looking out over the still water. Not many people went to the lake. There were only a few spots where cars could park and people could come to enjoy the water. A sparse group of residents lived at the west end of the lake, but the east end, farther inland, was still thick and wild, the land cut only by small back roads. Beth would find herself in a stand of brush, her skin scratched and mosquitoes attacking her as she stared at the water, with no clear memory of exactly how she\u2019d gotten here. She only knew that she\u2019d simply showed up. The fact that she couldn\u2019t remember always made her queasy, so she\u2019d get back in her car and go home. And it was comforting, in a way. She had been honest when she\u2019d told Shea about some places holding you like a fist. What she hadn\u2019t said was that sometimes, when that fist was the only thing you knew, you didn\u2019t really want it to let you go. This time, it was raining. She hadn\u2019t slept again, and she wanted a drink badly, and she was tired, so tired. She\u2019d taken a garbage bag and thrown her parents\u2019 belongings into it\u2014her mother\u2019s cold cream, the ashtray she hated so much, her father\u2019s ties, the stack of magazines on the living room credenza. She\u2019d put the trash at the curb and driven off in the rain. She\u2019d ended up at the lake, as always. But something was changing. The last time she\u2019d come here, she\u2019d felt it, and now she felt it again. It wasn\u2019t something she could grasp, but it was like a scent in the air or a breeze on the back of her neck. She wasn\u2019t imagining it. Not this time. Change was coming, and she couldn\u2019t stop it. You\u2019re not leaving. You\u2019re not talking. She needed to talk to Shea again. She got back into her car and drove home. At first, when she turned off the ignition in the driveway and stared at the curb where the garbage bag had vanished, she sagged in defeat. Then she got angry\u2014that old ice-cold anger she\u2019d had all her life, that had gotten her in so much trouble and still made her feel alive. She got out of the car and started toward the house in the rain. She stared at the house as she walked, letting it see her gaze roaming over all of its ugly lines, hating it. She nearly snarled as she and the house stared each other down. Then she walked through the front door, which was open, and into the hushed darkness inside. The first thing she saw was the magazines stacked on the credenza again. She knew that when she went upstairs, she\u2019d see her mother\u2019s cold cream and her father\u2019s ties exactly where they\u2019d been, as if she\u2019d never put them in the trash. And the ashtray . . . that damned ashtray would be on the bedside table. How many times over the years had she tried to throw that fucking cold cream out? Too many to remember. So Beth and the house would go another round, then. She\u2019d expected it. But this wasn\u2019t going to go on forever. She knew that now. She\u2019d almost let her anger drain\u2014almost\u2014when she saw the wine bottle on the coffee table. Red wine, her favorite. Though, of course, any wine would do. Beth would drink anything at all, given the chance. And the house knew it. She stared at that bottle, gleaming in the half-light of the drawn curtains, and for a minute she wanted that wine so badly she would have done anything for it. She could practically taste it on her tongue, could feel the slide of it down her throat. She would have sold her soul for that bottle. She closed her eyes. Things are changing, she told herself. She walked to the table and grabbed the bottle, willing her hand not to shake. In the kitchen, she ignored the blood on the floor, tracking through it in her nice shoes. She ignored the breeze from the broken door and the huddled shape that she knew was her father\u2019s body against the lower cupboards. She flinched away from it and stood at the sink, yanking the cork from the bottle and upending it over the drain. The wine gurgled down the sink. It looked like blood. From the corner of her eye, Beth saw that her father\u2019s body was gone. \u201cFuck you,\u201d she said to the house, to her memories, to all of it. She stood there until all of the wine had been drained from the bottle. Until the blood was gone from the floor, her tracks vanished like they\u2019d never been. Until the door shut and the breeze stopped. Until it was over. Then she put the bottle down and put her head in her hands, because she was alone all over again. \n CHAPTER SIXTEEN October 1977 BETH The cops didn\u2019t like that she had a lawyer with her this time. Ransom seemed to fill the tiny interview room, his big frame taking up all the space. Detective Black looked uncomfortable, and Detective Washington looked furious. Beth sat silent, letting the men go at each other\u2019s throats. \u201cWe want a handwriting sample,\u201d Washington said. \u201cNo,\u201d Ransom replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a warrant.\u201d \u201cWhen you have one, please present it. Until then, we decline.\u201d Washington looked at her. This was the tactic, Ransom had warned her: address her directly, bypassing her lawyer, and get her to react. \u201cWe can get your handwriting, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cYour checks at the bank, any letter you\u2019ve written to a boyfriend. Your lawyer is just delaying.\u201d \u201cI defer to him,\u201d Beth said. \u201cHe\u2019s so very wise.\u201d Washington looked like she\u2019d cussed at him, and even Ransom glanced at her, his eyes narrowed. \u201cWe\u2019ve already searched the house,\u201d Washington said. \u201cWe\u2019re processing everything we found. We\u2019re going over the car inch by inch, too. Whatever we find there will indict you. Do you understand?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t answer that,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cDon\u2019t answer anything.\u201d Beth stayed still. She couldn\u2019t think of anything they would find in the house, aside from her mother\u2019s family china and her father\u2019s old papers, which she had never had the guts to read or throw out. Still, it had been a violation, the cops emptying drawers and flipping mattresses. They\u2019d bagged and cleared her empty wine bottles as if they were evidence of something. Evidence that she drank too much. Was that going to be used against her, too? Probably. Detective Black cleared his throat. He was wearing navy blue today, a suit that wasn\u2019t new but looked well taken care of. Beth wondered if he pressed his own suits, since he didn\u2019t wear a wedding ring. Or maybe he had a girlfriend who did it for him. If she was pressing his suits, he should definitely marry her. There was something wrong with her, thinking these thoughts while she was being questioned for murder. Then again, the fact that there was something wrong with her wasn\u2019t news. \u201cI think we should back up,\u201d Detective Black said reasonably. \u201cWe\u2019re all here for a discussion. To clear some things up. Arguing won\u2019t get us anywhere.\u201d \u201cThis entire discussion is egregious,\u201d Ransom said, bringing out his big lawyer words. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing connecting my client to this crime, or to the previous murder, or to either of these victims. You\u2019re wasting everyone\u2019s time when you should be finding a killer.\u201d \u201cWe have the notes,\u201d Washington said, his gaze hostile on Ransom. If it were possible, or legal, for Washington to throw Beth\u2019s lawyer out the window, it was clear he would gladly do it. \u201cWe could easily eliminate your client as a suspect if she gave a voluntary handwriting sample. And we\u2019d like a psychological analysis.\u201d They went back and forth, playing their masculine game of one-upmanship as Beth tuned out. She looked at Black, and his eyes caught hers. He sighed a little, letting her see it, waiting for his partner to run low on steam. In return, she shrugged: There\u2019s nothing we can do about either of them. She liked that he didn\u2019t fidget, didn\u2019t smoke or pace; he had no theater about him. His gaze didn\u2019t travel down her body, but it stayed on her long enough that she felt the urge to twitch. Was it lascivious? She couldn\u2019t tell. Maybe, faced with the option of looking at either her or Washington and Ransom, he\u2019d decided that she was the one in the room he\u2019d rather look at. When there was a break in Washington and Ransom\u2019s arguing, Black leaned toward Beth and said, \u201cTell me about your father\u2019s death.\u201d Her world tilted. For a second it was tempting, even easy, to pretend it was just the two of them, talking privately with no one else around. Just her and this sympathetic man, asking her about the day her father died. She could open her mouth and tell him everything that was inside her, all the bad things that she kept locked away. Then she glanced at the tape recorder, whirring quietly on the table. She looked at Washington, standing with his arms crossed, and Ransom, sitting in the folding chair next to hers. She could smell old coffee and stale cigarette smoke and something stuffy and rancid, like bad breath. And she remembered that day. She remembered the feeling of drowning, of sinking deeper and looking up, knowing she would never swim to the surface. She turned back to Detective Black, her voice mechanical. \u201cSomeone robbed my father and killed him.\u201d Black was still leaning forward, his upper body angled toward her, as if they were alone. \u201cWhoever did it used the same gun for these murders,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ballistics will prove it.\u201d Beth held still, not looking away. This was another game. They didn\u2019t have the ballistics report, not yet. \u201cBeth, tell the truth,\u201d Black said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to help you.\u201d That was where he made a mistake, because she knew he was lying. She looked him in the eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to help me,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one wants to help me. No one ever has.\u201d There was a second of quiet, the tape recorder the only sound. Detective Black actually looked surprised. He\u2019d had a good life, she realized. Parents, maybe even grandparents, who loved him. A sibling or two. She could see it all: track team, stern but loving teachers, kisses behind the bleachers with a pretty girl. A few silly drunken experiences that were written off to high spirits, then losing his virginity to another pretty girl. Eventually, the police academy and making detective when he was barely thirty. He had the lean physique of a man who exercised instead of growing a paunch, and he didn\u2019t smoke. He saw bad things, sure, but he was saving people and putting the bad guys away. Saving the world. This case was a problem for him, but it was one he would solve. Because in the end, the world always turned out the way he wanted it to. Beth thought of her empty house, quiet now that her parents weren\u2019t screaming at each other anymore. She thought of the hours sitting alone in her room as a child, her hands over her ears, trying to make it all go away inside her head. She thought of her father\u2019s blood all over the kitchen floor. A lake of blood, deep and red, because it had gurgled out of him as he died. It had taken a cleaning crew three days to remove it. Ransom had made the arrangements while Beth and her mother stayed at a hotel. And when it was cleaned up, Beth and her mother moved back in. She always thought the house smelled coppery after that. She saw shadows in the kitchen, smelled her father\u2019s cologne mixed with blood. She was thought to be an improper young lady, because she couldn\u2019t cook, could barely make toast that she washed down with wine. No one had considered that she simply hated the kitchen at the Greer mansion and couldn\u2019t stand to be inside it. Tell the truth. We\u2019re trying to help you. Detective Black had never been as angry as Beth was right now. \u201cDo you own a gun?\u201d Detective Washington asked for the hundredth time. He hated her, but at least his anger was something she understood. When she didn\u2019t answer, he said, \u201cWe know your father owned one.\u201d Under the table, Ransom touched Beth\u2019s knee. Just the side of his pinky finger tapping her once\u2014his keep-quiet signal. Beth looked at Washington. \u201cFuck you,\u201d she said, her voice icy-calm. Washington looked like she\u2019d slapped him, and Ransom sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis interview is over.\u201d \u2014 Outside the police station, there were two photographers this time, plus a reporter shouting questions. Ransom looked unimpressed as he took Beth\u2019s elbow and led her to his car. \u201cDamn the papers,\u201d he said. \u201cSome hack is writing a line about a \u2018lady killer\u2019 right this minute. I swear to God I\u2019d like the world to surprise me, just once.\u201d Beth got in the passenger seat. \u201cYou have nothing to say about what I said back there?\u201d Ransom got in, the car bouncing with his weight. His seat was set as far back as it would go to accommodate his long legs. \u201cIt would have been better if you were a little more ingratiating, I admit,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that was a low blow, so I\u2019m not one to lecture.\u201d That was almost amusing. Ransom was very much one to lecture. \u201cThey\u2019re going to hate me no matter what I do,\u201d Beth said. \u201cDon\u2019t you see that? I could be sweet, and those \u2018lady killer\u2019 articles are still going to get written.\u201d Ransom looked thoughtful as he pulled out of the lot, narrowly missing one of the photographers. Beth thought it was probably an intentional near miss. \u201cI do see that,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need someone to take their problems out on. You see that a lot when you\u2019re a lawyer. Since you\u2019re young and rich and lovely, you\u2019re as good a target as any. It\u2019s only going to get worse from here.\u201d He signaled and made a turn, heading up the hill to Arlen Heights. \u201cAll I ask is that you don\u2019t employ your sailor mouth when talking to the media, and definitely not if you ever talk to a judge.\u201d \u201cYou think they\u2019re going to arrest me,\u201d Beth said. \u201cThey very much want to arrest you. Two men are dead, and you\u2019re their only lead. The ballistics report might convince a judge to sign a warrant, and it might not. That\u2019s the gamble they have to take.\u201d Beth pressed her lips together, looking out the window. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get my handwriting,\u201d she said. \u201cSure, but not today. Just stay home, Beth, and don\u2019t let this make you crazy. That\u2019s all you have to do.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t stay home,\u201d Beth snapped. \u201cI have things to do.\u201d \u201cAll of that driving around you do? Going nowhere? It needs to stop. Unless you want the press following you.\u201d Don\u2019t let this make you crazy. Easy for him to say. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re right?\u201d she asked, Ransom\u2019s holier-than-thou wisdom getting on her nerves. \u201cWhat if I really shot those men, and by defending me you\u2019re setting me loose to do it again?\u201d Ransom didn\u2019t even blink. \u201cIf you did it, they can damn well prove it, and not by getting you in an interview room and throwing Julian\u2019s murder in your face, trying to make you cry. That was pure bullying back there, so I\u2019m going to remind you, Beth\u2014don\u2019t ever talk to the police without me. That goes for reporters, too, but it goes ten times over for cops. If you talk to them alone, even your money won\u2019t save you.\u201d There was more lecturing as Ransom drove her home, his version of fatherly advice: Don\u2019t date. Don\u2019t talk to strangers of any kind, because strangers will repeat everything you say to the nearest reporter. Don\u2019t write letters, because they could be intercepted. Be careful what you say on the phone. Beth listened in silence, watching out the window. The words flowed over her, because she was stuck on one thing he\u2019d already said. In the interview room, they\u2019d been trying to make her cry about her father\u2019s murder. But she hadn\u2019t felt like crying at all. \n CHAPTER SEVENTEEN September 2017 SHEA Sylvia Simpson worked at a law firm in downtown Claire Lake. Even though she was past retirement age by now, she was listed on the firm\u2019s website as the assistant to one of the senior partners. But I definitely had the right Sylvia, which she confirmed when she replied to my Facebook message. We met on a weekday afternoon. Our offices were only a few blocks apart, and I managed to take a break and slip from behind my desk. \u201cTen minutes,\u201d Sylvia had written to me on Facebook. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ll give you. Meet me outside my office at three.\u201d Her firm was one of the nicest in town, the offices in a restored two-story Victorian house close to the ocean. At three o\u2019clock, I stood on the front walk in my scrub top, wondering if I should go inside, when the front door opened and a woman of possibly seventy came out. She was wide and hard as a block of concrete, her white hair pulled back and her eyebrows drawn on in dramatic arches. She wore a gray wool skirt and jacket that were likely very expensive and still managed to look unflattering. She took a pack of cigarettes from her purse and motioned me around the corner of the house without a word. \u201cSurprised?\u201d she asked me as she pulled out a chair on a small patio. She lowered herself into the chair and pulled out a cigarette and a pack of matches. Her voice was husky and low, intimidating. \u201cAn old woman like me, working. Caught you off guard.\u201d She hadn\u2019t offered an introduction or a handshake. I pulled out a chair for myself and sat, feeling the cool, damp breeze from the ocean breathe past us. \u201cNot really,\u201d I said. \u201cHuh.\u201d Sylvia lit a cigarette, inhaled, then exhaled, not bothering to blow the smoke away from me. \u201cYou\u2019re bluffing, but it\u2019s fine. If you think I\u2019m old, you should see my boss. He\u2019s even older than I am. I\u2019ve been his assistant for thirty-five years, and when he goes, I go. I\u2019m the only person he trusts.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d I said, pulling my phone from my bag. \u201cDo you mind\u2014\u201d \u201cPut that thing away.\u201d Her voice was flat, hostile. I put the phone back. \u201cHow old are you, anyway?\u201d \u201cTwenty-nine.\u201d \u201cA baby,\u201d she said, almost angrily. \u201cJulian Greer was already dead by the time I was twenty-nine, and I was looking for a new job. I was looking for a new husband, too, because the first one had pushed me down the stairs one too many times.\u201d She gestured at me with the lit end of her cigarette to make her point. \u201cRecord that, why don\u2019t you?\u201d This was going to be a fun ten minutes, I could tell. \u201cI want to ask you about Julian,\u201d I said. \u201cSuch a nice man. Handsome, too.\u201d Sylvia took another drag on her cigarette and shook her head. \u201cI worked for him for four years. I saw everything\u2014everything. You\u2019re lucky, because you\u2019re talking to the only person who knew what was really going on. Even those police who came to me after Mr. Greer died didn\u2019t know their asses from a hole in the wall, and they didn\u2019t bother to ask. Because who cares what the secretary knows, right? Well, let me tell you, we know everything. So listen up, Miss Twenty-Nine.\u201d \u201cMy name is Shea,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you going to listen, or are you going to talk?\u201d I sighed. \u201cListen. I\u2019m going to listen.\u201d \u201cGood. The first thing you need to know is that nothing was Mr. Greer\u2019s fault. It was all because of that woman he married.\u201d I blinked. \u201cMariana Greer?\u201d \u201cShe was the worst thing that ever happened to him. Everyone knew it. Sure, she had money, and I suppose she was beautiful, but she didn\u2019t have class. He used to come to work exhausted because they\u2019d had a fight and he didn\u2019t get any sleep. I\u2019d put calls through from her, and she would be in tears, yelling at him about something. At work. It was a damned disgrace.\u201d I watched her. Beneath her gruff exterior, Sylvia was lit up and righteous. This was her cause, the thing she\u2019d waited decades to talk about. I decided to play into it. \u201cWhat was the wife\u2019s problem?\u201d I said. It was exactly the right question. Sylvia glanced at me and took another drag of her cigarette, drawing out the drama. When she spoke, she relished the words. \u201cOh, she had problems, all right. When Mrs. Greer\u2019s mother died, she didn\u2019t leave her fortune to her daughter. She left it to Mr. Greer, her daughter\u2019s husband. What does that tell you?\u201d To me it sounded sad, but I kept my face blank with confusion. Sylvia scoffed at me and tapped her temple with her fingertip. \u201cMariana Greer was crazy?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy else would her own mother leave her inheritance to her husband instead of her? She wasn\u2019t competent. Mr. Greer had a file of papers the mother had left to him. I didn\u2019t see all of it, but some of the papers had to do with his wife being sent away somewhere when she was eighteen.\u201d Sylvia made air quotes with her fingers at the words \u201csent away somewhere,\u201d her cigarette waggling in the air. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know about that before the wedding\u2014I can guarantee it. It was only after they were married and her mother died that he learned his wife had been a mental patient. A damned mental patient\u2014can you imagine? I felt sorry for that man.\u201d I itched to go home to my laptop, or to call Michael. I\u2019d never seen evidence that Mariana Greer had been mentally ill. \u201cWhat happened to those papers?\u201d I asked. \u201cMr. Greer got rid of them sometime before he died. Burned them probably. The shame.\u201d \u201cWhat about the daughter? Did you ever meet her?\u201d \u201cNo. But we all know what happened with her, don\u2019t we?\u201d Sylvia said smugly. \u201cAnd we all know why.\u201d \u201cYou think she committed those murders.\u201d Sylvia stubbed out her cigarette in the plastic ashtray on the table. \u201cWith bad blood like hers, who else do you think did it? Santa Claus?\u201d I couldn\u2019t say why she made me angry exactly. Certainly, I was no defender of Beth, and Beth didn\u2019t need or want my help. For all I knew, Sylvia Simpson was absolutely right. Still, I said, \u201cYou went through his papers, didn\u2019t you? Julian Greer\u2019s private file from his mother-in-law. He never showed that to you. You snooped.\u201d Sylvia didn\u2019t even blink. \u201cAnd you should thank me for it, because now you know the truth.\u201d Her voice was calm, but her cheeks were flushed and the chair made a loud noise as she pushed it back. \u201cI know I\u2019m an old battle-axe, but I was a good secretary to Mr. Greer. They say his own daughter shot him in cold blood. She\u2019s just as crazy as her mother was. She should have gotten the death penalty as far as I\u2019m concerned. Now I\u2019m going back to work.\u201d \u201cWhich mental hospital was it?\u201d I called to her retreating back as I stood. \u201cI\u2019d like to go through the records.\u201d Sylvia was done with me, but she couldn\u2019t resist one parting shot. \u201cDo you think her rich family would send her to one of the public ones?\u201d she said scornfully over her shoulder. \u201cOf course they didn\u2019t. It was a private place. I don\u2019t remember the name of it, but it was on Linwood Street. I don\u2019t know why she matters, but good luck.\u201d Fifteen minutes later, I was back behind the reception desk at work, feeling strangely exhausted. Sylvia\u2019s grievances, held for decade after decade, were heavy. I couldn\u2019t imagine carrying that weight all the time. Still, when no one was looking, I took a second to pull out my phone and text Michael: I\u2019m going to need some help pulling property records for Linwood Street. Specifically from the 1950s. This was my only bit of luck: Linwood Street was one of the now-gentrified streets downtown, and it wasn\u2019t very long. It definitely didn\u2019t have a hospital building on it. My recall of it was that it was mostly stately homes. One of those homes might, in the fifties, have been the discreet kind of place where a rich family could send their teenage daughter to have a mental breakdown. I don\u2019t know why she matters, Sylvia had said. I didn\u2019t, either. I wasn\u2019t sure why I was doing this. It was some kind of instinct. Beth\u2019s father had been murdered by the Lady Killer; Beth\u2019s mother was possibly mentally ill. All of this was part of the woman who fascinated me, the woman who\u2014I could admit it\u2014scared me, not least because some cold part of me actually liked her. What that said about me, I didn\u2019t even want to think about. \u2014 I split the property records on Linwood Street with Michael\u2014he took half and I took half. I spent most of that evening sorting through online records while lying in bed with my laptop, Winston by my side. By one in the morning, I hadn\u2019t found what I wanted and my eyes could barely focus, but I wasn\u2019t ready to sleep. I clicked open the digital file I had of the 1981 TV movie made about the Lady Killer case. It was called Deadly Woman, and I watched Jaclyn Smith, as Beth, face off against a soap actor who looked at least forty-five and was supposed to be playing Detective Black. \u201cI\u2019m telling the truth,\u201d Jaclyn said. Her hair had been dyed red for the role, and her eye makeup was frosty, her lashes clumped and dark. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that, Beth,\u201d the soap actor said as dramatic music soared behind his lines. Jaclyn leaned forward, the camera going into dewy soft focus on her beautiful face, the music swelling higher. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to believe me!\u201d she cried. She was wearing a cream blouse with ruffles at the neck and the cuffs; red blush had been dabbed on her cheekbones. Her voice went up a notch as she shouted: \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to!\u201d \u201cListen, Beth,\u201d said the soap actor. \u201cI\u2019d like to believe you, but nothing you say adds up. You wrote those notes. You know you did. You\u2019re lying so much you don\u2019t even know what\u2019s the truth anymore. But I do. And the truth is, you shot those men!\u201d I sighed and paused it, freezing on a frame of Jaclyn Smith\u2019s face right before she got angry. In Deadly Woman, Beth was a manipulator, a heartless killer, a siren, trying to work her wiles on poor Detective Black and failing in the face of his moral superiority. It was all right there in the title. I smoothed my fingertips over the top of Winston\u2019s head, then rolled over in bed and picked up my other early-eighties artifact, a book called Who Was the Female Zodiac? It was written in 1984 by a journalist named Henderson Metterick, and it was the only book ever written about the Lady Killer case. It had been out of print for decades, but I\u2019d found a hardcover copy on eBay a year ago, the pages yellowed and fragrant with over thirty years of age. The book was a hack job of useless speculation, overwriting, and almost comically offensive misogyny, filled with words like she-devil and phrases like Beth Greer\u2019s exotic, overpowering allure. This, I realized, was where it got tricky. Because the Beth I knew was possibly a murderer, a liar, a sociopath. But there was no other way to put it\u2014everything that had been written about Beth for the last forty years was infuriating. I wasn\u2019t an angry person, but Who Was the Female Zodiac? made me want to kick Henderson Metterick in the balls, even though he\u2019d been dead since 1991. \u201cFuck you, Henderson,\u201d I said out loud, because it felt good. On the bed next to me, Winston Purrchill\u2019s ears swiveled toward me, but he was too lazy to open his eyes. With the laptop still frozen on Jaclyn\u2019s face, I flipped through the book again, opening the photo section in the middle. Henderson might be a terrible writer and a woman hater, but he\u2019d somehow gotten hold of good photographs. There was Beth as a little girl, posed on a chair, wearing her school uniform. The caption said she was age six. I turned the pages, looking at more photographs. There was a photo of the Greer mansion, with a predictable caption about how rich and miserable the Greers were. Here was the first victim, Thomas Armstrong, posing with his family, dressed in a suit with a wide collar, sideburns on his cheeks. Then the second victim, Paul Veerhoever, a man with a round face and pale blond hair. He was standing next to his wife, a beautiful woman with curly brown hair tumbling past her shoulders. They were at a party somewhere, each of them holding a glass of wine and smiling awkwardly. I wondered what had happened to the wives of those men, what kind of lives they\u2019d gone on to have. Both of them had left town, I knew. I hadn\u2019t been able to track down either of them. And here, again, was Beth. This picture was taken the day she was arrested in December 1977; it was a shot of Beth being led down the front steps of the Greer mansion, her hands cuffed behind her back. Detective Washington, frowning through his mustache, had her by one arm, while Detective Black, looking serious and troubled, walked at her other shoulder. His posture was almost protective, like he was shielding Beth from everything around her. Beth was wearing a belted trench coat that ended at midthigh, her red hair down, hoops in her ears. She had a solemn expression on her face, but there was no other way to describe her but radiant. Her skin was pale and flawless, her eyes large and dark, her mouth slashed with a shock of sexy red lipstick, her hair in a sensual cloud around her face. She looked like a goddess, and she was utterly, almost unnaturally calm. I could see Beth\u2019s resemblance to Mariana in that photo. Mariana, who Sylvia Simpson said had been crazy. I stared at the photo for a long time, taking in the faces. I felt like I\u2019d been there that day, like I could smell the cold damp of the winter air and see the flashing of the police lights. Behind Beth and the two detectives were uniformed officers, young men who looked stern and excited. That must have been quite a day. I reached to my bedside table and picked up my phone. I hadn\u2019t relistened to the recording of my interview with Beth. If I couldn\u2019t sleep, I may as well transcribe it. I pulled up the recording app, found the recording, and played it. MY VOICE: Okay. Let\u2019s talk about the Lady Killer murders. BETH\u2019S VOICE: Let\u2019s. ME: I don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s any point in me asking you if you committed them or not? BETH: You\u2019ll form your own conclusions. Everyone does. Winston lifted his head, his ears swiveling and his eyes blinking open. \u201cSorry, buddy,\u201d I said as the voices kept talking. \u201cI know it\u2019s late.\u201d But the cat wasn\u2019t just annoyed. He tensed, got his feet under him, and crouched low, his sleek body pressed down in terror. His tail bloomed wide as the fur on it stood up. He hissed, gave a low growl, and bolted off the bed and out of the room. \u201cWinston?\u201d I said, and then I heard it. Something on the recording. I picked my phone up and put it closer to my ear. Beth and I were talking\u2014about my parents, about her parents. But in the background was a shushing sound. I turned up the volume and pressed the phone to my ear, wondering if the recording had picked up wind, or had created noise because of a technical problem. But it wasn\u2019t the wind, or white noise on the recording. It was a whisper. With an ice-cold finger, I rewound. My mother never wanted to get married, Beth\u2019s voice said. But it was the fifties, and my grandparents were rich. They expected her to marry well. She met my father, and that was that. More of a business deal than anything else. And a year later, she had me. She was trapped. There was a pause, and then I heard it clearly. A woman\u2019s voice as if whispered into the phone\u2019s speaker. I\u2019m still here. I dropped the phone. It landed on the bed without a sound. From the recording playback came my voice: Where\u2019s your bathroom? I took a breath, picked the phone up again. Played it again. Heard it again. I\u2019m still here. I remembered what came next: the bathroom taps turning on, the kitchen cupboards opening, the blood. But at that moment, the phone had been on the table between Beth and me, in plain sight of both of us. Whatever had been in the house that day had been waiting, watching, while we talked. Waiting to be heard. I rewound the clip again, thinking to save it off my phone. Make copies. Send one to Michael, with his theories of levers and pulleys. Play it for Detective Black. Play it for Beth and see what her reaction was. But while my finger was still on the slider, my phone went blank. It had turned itself off, the battery suddenly empty, even though I had charged it an hour ago. I scrambled to find my charger, plug the phone in, and power it up again. When I finally did, the entire interview was gone. Deleted from the phone, from the cloud, everywhere, as if it had never been. Whatever it was, whoever it was, it had said what it wanted to say. And now it had gone quiet again. \n CHAPTER EIGHTEEN October 2017 SHEA I was sitting behind the Plexiglas at work, hanging up the phone, when I heard a familiar voice: \u201cI\u2019m here to see Shea.\u201d I looked up to see Beth Greer standing at the counter, looking past Karen to me. She was wearing a dark gray wool wrap wound stylishly over her shoulders and neck. Beneath it, she wore elegant black pants. Her reading glasses were perched on top of her head. She looked amazing, as usual. \u201cYou are?\u201d I asked her, surprised. We didn\u2019t have an agreement to meet. I hadn\u2019t heard from her since before I\u2019d met with Detective Black. She gave me one of her subtle smiles, the one that barely brushed her lips. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to lunch,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d I blinked and glanced at Karen. She had a surprised frown on her face. Doubtless, she was remembering our conversation, when I\u2019d wondered whether Beth was famous. She probably wasn\u2019t sure whether to risk being impolite to a famous person. Beth raised a finger and pointed with understated command to the hinged door that would let me out of my cubicle. \u201cShea, I\u2019m waiting.\u201d I reached down and grabbed my purse from under the desk before I formed a conscious thought. I pushed back my chair and said to Karen, \u201cSee you later.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll be back in an hour,\u201d Beth said, and Karen nodded as she turned away. \u201cDoes that always work for you?\u201d I asked her as we got in the elevator, my purse tucked under my arm. \u201cDoes what always work for me?\u201d \u201cOrdering people around.\u201d One of Beth\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cShea, is it lunchtime?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d \u201cI guess.\u201d \u201cThen we\u2019ll have lunch. I don\u2019t see where the confusion is.\u201d The elevator doors slid open on the ground floor. \u201cYou don\u2019t have very many friends, do you?\u201d I asked her. \u201cI don\u2019t have any friends,\u201d Beth said, her tone blunt. \u201cYou know the reason.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been forty years.\u201d \u201cNot in this town, it hasn\u2019t.\u201d I followed her out onto the street, then down toward the piers. Beth led me into one of the high-end caf\u00e9s that the tourists frequented. \u201cI\u2019m wearing scrubs,\u201d I said self-consciously as we stepped inside. Beth swept her gaze down me and up again, assessing. \u201cI don\u2019t see a problem.\u201d There wasn\u2019t. We were seated immediately in a corner booth and given glasses of water in seconds. I couldn\u2019t tell whether we were favored because Beth was infamous or because she was obviously rich. It certainly wasn\u2019t because of me. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked me, looking at me from above the rims of her reading glasses as she perused the menu. \u201cI can\u2019t figure out whether to like you, to feel sorry for you, or be annoyed by you,\u201d I replied. \u201cTry all three,\u201d she said, as if the answer were simple. Then she looked at her menu again. \u201cI think you\u2019d like the lobster bisque.\u201d Of course she\u2019d order for me. \u201cOkay.\u201d I closed my menu. Beth closed her menu, too, and pushed back her reading glasses again. \u201cYou haven\u2019t called me.\u201d No, I hadn\u2019t called her. After the interview with the whisper was deleted from my phone, I\u2019d plunged back into real-world research, the kind that was based on verifiable facts. And I had no desire to go back to that house. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d \u201cI thought you wanted to interview me.\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cWell, here I am.\u201d She took a sip of her water. \u201cI suppose Joshua told you a few things about me.\u201d She was fishing, I realized. Even though Beth was the one who had set up the interview, she wasn\u2019t entirely sure what Detective Black had told me. I hadn\u2019t called her to fill her in, and she wanted to know. The idea was surprising. I hadn\u2019t thought Beth had any weaknesses. I thought of Black\u2019s bitter voice as he said, We aren\u2019t friends, and I wondered if he was one of them. I also wondered why she called him Joshua. \u201cIt was a good meeting, I guess,\u201d I said lamely. Beth\u2019s gaze narrowed at me across the table. The waitress appeared, and Beth gave our order. I wasn\u2019t ready for this. I wasn\u2019t prepared to fence with Beth Greer in the middle of my workday. When I\u2019d gone to the Greer mansion, I\u2019d built up to it, gone in prepared. This time, she\u2019d ambushed me. My instincts told me that if I thought that wasn\u2019t deliberate, I was probably a fool. But I\u2019d lost our first interview without the chance to transcribe it, and now I had another opportunity. I wanted to know about Mariana. About Julian\u2019s murder. About the Lady Killer murders. The source of all of those answers was sitting across from me. I figured I may as well not let it go to waste. As the waitress walked away, I pulled my cell phone from my purse and put it on the table between us. \u201cI\u2019m going to record this,\u201d I said. Beth said nothing as I tapped the screen. When it was recording, I said, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about your childhood.\u201d She looked at the red light on my recording app for a moment, then shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d \u201cYou were an only child, and your parents didn\u2019t have a happy marriage. I think that must have been lonely.\u201d Beth\u2019s voice was cool. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying Mount Everest is tall, but yes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m curious about your parents. Tell me about them.\u201d Beth looked down at my phone again, and when she looked up she had a coldness in her expression that was as blank as stone. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to ask old people about their childhoods, Shea. Our buried things have been buried for a long time.\u201d I met her eyes, and then the waitress came back with two bowls of lobster bisque. When she had gone away again, Beth said to me, \u201cI\u2019ve never asked. Are you married? My background check didn\u2019t cover your love life.\u201d I picked up my spoon, trying to shake off the cold feeling from a minute before. \u201cDivorced.\u201d \u201cSmart girl,\u201d Beth said. \u201cIf my parents had had the guts to get divorced, everything would be different.\u201d \u201cYou said your mother was trapped.\u201d \u201cShe was, and so was my father. Men can get trapped in their own ways.\u201d \u201cDid your mother have mental-illness issues?\u201d Beth frowned. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s something I heard. That your mother may have spent time in a private hospital when she was a teenager.\u201d Beth blinked and put down her spoon. \u201cShea, please elaborate.\u201d They were simple words, polite even, but my stomach went cold. Beth\u2019s inflection was lifeless, dead, her expression blank. She was waiting for an answer, and I had the feeling that if I didn\u2019t provide it, I would be very, very sorry. Which was crazy, because she was an over-sixty woman having lunch in a trendy restaurant. I cleared my throat. \u201cI found a source who said\u2014\u201d \u201cWho? Who said that?\u201d For a second, I didn\u2019t want to tell her. Then again, why was I protecting Sylvia Simpson and her forty years of judgment? \u201cShe was your father\u2019s secretary,\u201d I said. \u201cMy father\u2019s secretary told you that my mother was insane?\u201d Now her tone was incredulous. \u201cWell, she said\u2014\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. My mother wasn\u2019t crazy. My mother was a victim. She lived her entire life in shame.\u201d \u201cWho was she a victim of? Your father?\u201d \u201cMy parents fought, but my father was never abusive. He was good, in his way.\u201d Beth leaned back in her chair and picked up her spoon, stirring her bisque as if she had just remembered it was there. \u201cI would have loved my father more if he had noticed me. But we never had much to say to each other. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been very good with men.\u201d I gaped at her. She\u2019d been accused of murdering two men in cold blood, so no, maybe she wasn\u2019t very good with men. \u201cWell,\u201d I managed, \u201cI guess I know the feeling.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not the type that\u2019s very good with men, either,\u201d Beth said, letting her judgment drop without a second\u2019s concern for my feelings. \u201cYou\u2019re attractive enough, but I\u2019m going to guess you don\u2019t have a boyfriend.\u201d She pondered me. \u201cDoes your family try to set you up with dates? I bet they do. And because of what happened when you were a child, you\u2019re too messed-up to say yes.\u201d My blood pounded in my ears. How did she know everything? How did she see me so clearly when no one else did? \u201cThere\u2019s only one man I\u2019m actually interested in,\u201d I said, \u201cand I\u2019ve never met him in person.\u201d She raised her eyebrows at that, the topic of her parents forgotten. \u201cI\u2019m intrigued. Tell me.\u201d And for some reason, I did. I told her about Michael, about our strange setup. Beth listened carefully, as if this was of keen interest to her. God knew why. But she narrowed her eyes as I talked, paying close attention. Like the last time I\u2019d confessed to Beth, it was intrusive and freeing at the same time. When I\u2019d finished, she spoke. \u201cYour problem is a simple power imbalance,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d \u201cIt means this man knows everything about you, and you know nothing about him. He knows where you live, where you work, the fact that you\u2019re single. Has he told you if he\u2019s married?\u201d \u201cHe says he\u2019s divorced.\u201d \u201cWhich could be a lie.\u201d She paused. \u201cIf he\u2019s a former cop, he might know about what happened to you as a child. Or he can easily find out.\u201d The thought gave me chills. \u201cI\u2019ve never told him about that.\u201d Beth shrugged. \u201cIn return, all you know is what he\u2019s told you over the phone. You have to believe what he says, because you don\u2019t know anything else. That\u2019s a power imbalance, and you know it.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cMichael\u2019s personal life is none of my business. We have a professional relationship.\u201d \u201cExcept for the fact that you\u2019d like to screw him.\u201d \u201cBeth, I pay him.\u201d \u201cObviously, you wouldn\u2019t pay him for that part,\u201d she said. \u201cThat part would be volunteer.\u201d With horror, I realized that my cell phone was still recording. I reached out and stabbed the recording off. Beth watched me do it. \u201cApparently, you don\u2019t want to talk about sex,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to talk about your sex life,\u201d I shot back. \u201cWe\u2019re not at that part of the interview yet,\u201d she replied, unfazed. \u201cMaybe later. In the meantime, we\u2019re talking about you.\u201d \u201cI really wish we weren\u2019t.\u201d She looked at me. Her eyes were mesmerizing, so large and deep, easy to get lost in, even now. She must have been impossible to resist when she was twenty-three. \u201cFor the record, I think this detective is probably exactly what he says he is,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s probably even nice. And actually single. But you\u2019re never going to know if you let him stay a mystery because it\u2019s more comfortable that way. That\u2019s my advice.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s your call. Make it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until hours later, when the lobster bisque was finished, the bill paid, and I was sitting at my desk at the end of the day, that I realized four things about that lunch with Beth: One, she really had come to find out what had happened in the interview with Detective Black. And because I hadn\u2019t called her. So she had at least one weakness. Two, she\u2019d said her mother had lived her whole life in shame. Why? Three, she had deftly turned the subject away from her childhood, then made me turn the recorder off by embarrassing me. And four, when I\u2019d mentioned Mariana\u2019s possible mental illness, Beth had been angry. That was what that cold expression of hers was, the dead voice that gave me the chills. Beth hadn\u2019t been bemused or dismissive at the suggestion that her mother had been crazy. She\u2019d been suddenly, icily angry. When Beth was that angry, she was terrifying. I was on the right track, which meant the answers were there. I just had to figure out where they were. \n CHAPTER NINETEEN October 2017 SHEA My sister was the executive assistant to a bank CEO, which was where she met her husband, one of the bank\u2019s lawyers. She and Will lived in one of the new low-rise condo buildings downtown, not far from the waterfront, in a neighborhood that had been built for well-to-do people like them. When I arrived for dinner, Esther answered the door in linen pants and a blouse that would have cost a month of our father\u2019s salary growing up. By contrast, I was wearing dark jeans, a black tee, sneakers, and a stretched-out black hoodie, my hair in a ponytail. I looked like I\u2019d just finished prowling the neighborhood, staring into everyone\u2019s windows, but Esther made no comment. We probably shouldn\u2019t have liked each other, Esther and me. We were so different, even though we had the same black hair and dark eyes. Esther wore her hair in a fashionable layered cut that ended at her chin and looked amazing on her, and I left mine long and usually tied back. We probably should have hated each other, but we\u2019d never quite managed it. We\u2019d been through too much together. Will gave me a hug in greeting. He smelled like aftershave and men\u2019s deodorant, scents I wasn\u2019t familiar with anymore. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you,\u201d he said. I handed him the bottle of wine I\u2019d brought, warm from my lap, where I\u2019d held it on the bus. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, too.\u201d In her early twenties, before Will, Esther had dated a man who hit her. I\u2019d helped her leave him, packing a U-Haul in the middle of the day while her boyfriend was at work, shoving garbage bags of her belongings into the trailer as fast as we could. We may be very different now, years later\u2014Esther successful and put-together, me a divorced wreck\u2014but we still had the experience of the garbage bags in the U-Haul, of me sleeping with her those first nights in her rented apartment, eating Pringles out of a tube for dinner. When you share something like that with your sister, it never leaves you, for better or for worse. Will went to the dining room to set the table, and I followed Esther into the kitchen, where she put my bottle of wine in her fridge and pulled an already-chilled bottle from an ice bucket. \u201cThank you for actually coming,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you for not setting me up with Will\u2019s coworker.\u201d She gave me a tight smile. \u201cYou scared me off that one,\u201d she said. \u201cWell done. How was your day?\u201d I had gone to lunch with an infamous possible serial killer, but I looked at my sister and I couldn\u2019t bring that up. For once, I didn\u2019t want to talk about murder. \u201cIt was fine,\u201d I said. \u201cSame old, really.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cYou should get a promotion in that job. You\u2019ve been there long enough. Supervisor or manager of the office. Or better yet, get out of there entirely. It\u2019s a dead end. You don\u2019t need some high-powered career, but you could definitely do better than that place.\u201d Extra money would be nice, I agreed, but the thought of moving up and managing other people gave me hives. \u201cIf something promising comes up, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re humoring me.\u201d Esther scooped tetrazzini into bowls and chopped a garnish to put on top of it. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to argue, so you\u2019re saying what I want to hear.\u201d I was doing exactly that, but I didn\u2019t want to fight. \u201cHave you heard from Mom and Dad?\u201d \u201cI talked to them yesterday. You should visit them. It\u2019s nice in Florida this time of year.\u201d \u201cEsther, it\u2019s literally hurricane season.\u201d I got another tight smile, because despite her lecturing, my sister had a sense of humor. \u201cOkay, then, you could call them more often. Or ever.\u201d I took a deep sip of wine. She was exactly right\u2014I could call my parents more often. The Incident, when I was nine, had affected my relationship with my parents, even though none of us wanted it to. My parents had felt guilty that they hadn\u2019t somehow protected me from my abductor, though logically they had done nothing wrong. Their guilt, in turn, made nine-year-old me feel guilty for causing trouble and making my parents feel bad. Esther felt both guilty for not being there to protect me and resentful that for a long time I got more attention than she did, followed by guilt about the resentment. And the cycle went round and round, among four loving, well-meaning people who had no idea what else to do, and it was still going round twenty years later. Sometimes, I thought I might like the cycle to stop. But my parents were in Florida now, and things were bumbling along well enough. There was no reason to dig up old bodies. I watched Esther sprinkle garnish on our dinners with her beautiful, manicured hands as we stood in her beautiful kitchen. I shouldn\u2019t be here, in my circle of darkness, making things harder for her. She should probably have a better sister. But she was stuck with me. Will appeared in the kitchen doorway and leaned on the doorframe. \u201cI waited long enough,\u201d he said to Esther. \u201cDid you tell her?\u201d I went still, my glass in my hand. \u201cTell me what?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m working up to it,\u201d Esther said, still looking at her garnishes and not at me. \u201cYou said you\u2019d tell her,\u201d Will said. I looked at my sister, at the tense lines at the corners of her eyes, and my stomach turned. Was something wrong? \u201cTell me what?\u201d I said again. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a big deal,\u201d Esther said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Will replied, his voice calm. \u201cIt\u2019s been a big deal for two years.\u201d \u201cTell me,\u201d I said, trying not to panic. \u201cPlease tell me.\u201d Esther sighed, the breath coming out of her from so deep that it changed the shape of her shoulders. Emotions flitted across her expression one by one: fear, stress, tense excitement, a hollow sort of sadness. She stopped fidgeting with the garnishes and turned to look at me. \u201cWe\u2019re starting IVF next week,\u201d she said. I tried to compute this. \u201cIVF? As in having a baby?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d I looked back and forth from Esther to Will, trying to read their expressions. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cWhy IVF? Is there some kind of complication?\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Will said. He looked tense, too, though he didn\u2019t look as tense as my sister, who was practically vibrating like a piano wire. \u201cWe just know we haven\u2019t been able to get pregnant. We\u2019ve been trying for two years.\u201d I put my wineglass down on the counter. \u201cTwo years?\u201d I looked at Esther. She was leaning against the counter, staring down at her hands. I noticed for the first time that she hadn\u2019t poured herself any wine. \u201cYou\u2019ve been trying to have a baby for two years, and you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d I said. \u201cShe wanted to tell you,\u201d Will explained. \u201cI\u2019ve been begging her to do it. It\u2019s just been difficult for us. We actually conceived twice but lost the baby very early.\u201d I rubbed my cheek, feeling my numb skin. Pregnant? Esther had been pregnant twice, and she hadn\u2019t told me anything? \u201cEsther?\u201d I said. My sister stared at her palms. \u201cYou\u2019ve been going through a tough time,\u201d she said. \u201cYour marriage wasn\u2019t working, and then you were going through the divorce. I didn\u2019t feel like I could burden you with it. And I didn\u2019t think I could talk to you about it. All of this murder stuff . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re so far away.\u201d If she had shoved a knife in my gut, I couldn\u2019t have been more hurt. Or more surprised. I\u2019d always thought I was close to Esther. No, I was close to Esther. We lived in the same town, and we talked every other day. We saw each other at Christmas. We did Sunday breakfast every other month. I\u2019d had dinner here at least a dozen times in the last two years. We had shoved garbage bags into that U-Haul together, stayed awake until it felt like our eyes were filled with sand. When Esther had called me and asked me to pack that truck, I\u2019d dropped everything. And before that . . . before that, she\u2019d been my big sister when I\u2019d been through the worst thing that had ever happened to me. You\u2019re so far away. Will stepped into our pained silence, as he was so good at doing. \u201cWe\u2019ve told you now,\u201d he said gently to me. \u201cIt\u2019s gone on long enough. Now you know. Let\u2019s have dinner, okay?\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d I said stupidly. \u201cSure.\u201d I looked at Esther. \u201cI hope it works for you.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d she said, and we took our bowls and went into the dining room. \u2014 \u201cI think that went pretty well,\u201d Will said. The awkward night was over, and he was walking me to the bus stop in the dark. He would have gladly driven me home, but he knew better than to offer, because there was no way I would say yes. I knew the stats\u2014bus stops weren\u2019t any safer than cars. But I rarely took the bus at night, and I kept to populated, well-lit areas. Walking through a dark parking lot or parking garage wouldn\u2019t have been any safer. And besides, I\u2019d never claimed that my hang-ups made any sense. I huddled deeper into my hoodie in the cool, damp air. Esther\u2019s neighborhood was quiet, all of the families curled into sleep. There was no one on the street but us. \u201cSure,\u201d I said. Will sighed as he walked beside me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry she didn\u2019t tell you, but you know how Esther is. She has to be handling everything, and she has to be the best at it. If she isn\u2019t pulling something off, she\u2019s so damn hard on herself. And part of her feels like she should be taking care of you, too.\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to take care of me.\u201d The protest was automatic. \u201cWell, she kind of does,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cAnd that isn\u2019t an insult, Shea. It isn\u2019t shameful to need someone to take care of you. You take care of her, too.\u201d \u201cShe has you for that,\u201d I said. \u201cAt least, now she does.\u201d \u201cAnd you\u2019d like to hate me for it, but you don\u2019t,\u201d he replied. \u201cBesides, she still needs you. You know she does. And if we have a baby, she\u2019ll need you even more.\u201d It would have been nice to hate Will\u2014it really would have. But the truth was, he honestly was the best of men. Esther had won the marriage lottery, and she deserved it. But tonight I felt the gulf between us as a large black hole. I\u2019d been meeting for weeks with an acquitted murderer, and I hadn\u2019t told my sister about it. She thought I was already too far into the darkness, and she had no idea how much further I\u2019d gone. How far I was willing to go. Just as I\u2019d had no idea when she\u2019d lost a baby, twice. She had hurt, really hurt, when that happened. I knew my sister. She put on a competent show, but underneath she could hurt, and deeply. This had hurt most of all, which was why she hadn\u2019t told me about it. You\u2019re so far away. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of my own life,\u201d I said to Will. \u201cI promise.\u201d \u201cShea, that isn\u2019t what this is about.\u201d But it was. It was about the fact that my brother-in-law had to walk me to the bus stop because I couldn\u2019t accept a ride. It was about the fact that when I got home, I would yet again check my locks and my security before turning on my laptop and delving into the Book of Cold Cases. Same as ever. The only difference was that tonight I would have the company of Winston Purrchill. Will waited with me as I got on the bus. Just in case. And I knew he was standing there for a long moment as it pulled away, disappearing down the street and into the darkness. When I had turned the corner and could no longer see him, I pulled out my phone and called Michael. \u201cWhere are you right now?\u201d I asked when he answered. \u201cAt home, going through property records until my eyes cross,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy?\u201d I looked out the window at the city going by. \u201cAre you really divorced?\u201d \u201cConsidering how bad my marriage was, I sure as hell hope so. What is this about, Shea?\u201d I read the street signs as they passed. I could see the ocean from here, inky black in the darkness beyond the lights of Claire Lake. \u201cI\u2019m on the bus,\u201d I said. \u201cI just passed Sixth Avenue and Harbor Street. If I get off at the next stop, will you come and have a drink with me?\u201d There was a brief pause of surprise. \u201cGive me fifteen minutes,\u201d Michael said. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll have a drink with you. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d \n CHAPTER TWENTY October 1977 BETH The bar was called Watertown\u2019s, a big, high-ceilinged room with dim lighting and loud music coming from a jukebox. It was twenty-five miles outside the Claire Lake city limits, which was why Beth went there to drink. They hadn\u2019t arrested her yet. It was going to happen; she could feel it the way you can feel electricity in the air when a thunderstorm is coming, when you see the lowering clouds on the horizon and feel the wind kick up. She didn\u2019t sleep much. Her life as she knew it would be over soon. The Claire Lake papers had already convicted her: local heiress suspected of murders and did she kill them? No one came forward to say they didn\u2019t believe it, that Beth would never do something like that. Except for Ransom\u2014who was paid to defend her. Other than maybe her father, who was dead, Beth couldn\u2019t think of anyone else who would say that. Instead there was a long line of people\u2014the neighbors, girls Beth had gone to school with, grocery clerks, a few of the people who had gotten drunk at Beth\u2019s parties\u2014who wanted to tell the press that Beth was strange, that she was frightening, that she had fits of anger. Stories were surfacing about noises at the Greer mansion while her parents were alive\u2014shouting, furniture overturned, china broken. And of course they all said that Beth lived alone now, that she had no friends or husband, that she spent most of her time as a hermit except when she was partying. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to like people,\u201d a girl who had known Beth briefly in seventh grade told the press. \u201cI think she hates everyone.\u201d Hating people in seventh grade made her a killer. Living alone because both of her parents were dead made her a killer. The pieces fit so nicely together. Beth had gone driving a few more times, but when she noticed a car following her, she turned around and went home. Was it the press? The police? It didn\u2019t matter. Now Beth stayed home like Ransom had told her to, the curtains on the floor-to-ceiling windows closed, the TV on. She lay on her sofa and drank and thought about what had happened to her and why. About how neat it all was. About how angry she was. People were right about that, at least. She was sick of drinking alone on the sofa, so tonight she broke Ransom\u2019s commandment. She got dressed, got in her car\u2014a Cadillac, because the police had impounded the Buick\u2014and drove to a bar to drink. It was second nature. Both of her parents had drunk from morning to night, and Beth had snuck her first drink at eleven. Now she sat at the dim bar, wearing a ringer T-shirt and high-waisted jeans, her hair twisted back. She started with vodka and stuck with it. Men came on to her, which she\u2019d expected. She turned them down. All she cared about was that no one recognized her, or at least that none of them would let on. She wanted to get blind drunk, but three-quarters of the way there an alarm went off deep in her belly, warning her to stop. She couldn\u2019t afford to lose control around strangers, couldn\u2019t afford to end up crawling all over a man in the back seat of his car and telling him everything. No mistakes, at least not big ones. At one o\u2019clock, she paid her tab and walked outside to the parking lot, trying to keep her steps in a convincingly steady line. There was a figure leaning against her car, waiting for her. Beth stopped, her heart hammering in her chest. Some of the drunkenness drained away, absorbed by adrenaline. Then she recognized him. \u201cYou have got to be kidding me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not driving home,\u201d Detective Black said. Beth closed her fingers around the keys in her hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the police,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you get in an accident.\u201d Incredibly, he was wearing a suit, or parts of one. He had no jacket, and his tie was loosened past his clavicle, his shirt unbuttoned at the top. But his dress pants were barely wrinkled and his shoes were shiny. His face was tired and his hair was slightly mussed, but he watched her with cop\u2019s eyes. \u201cFuck off,\u201d Beth said, because she was tired and drunk and couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say. \u201cGo away and leave me alone.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to do that,\u201d he said stoically. \u201cMy car is just over there. I\u2019ll drive you home.\u201d \u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d He didn\u2019t answer, but she knew. With the suspicious instincts of the drunk, she knew. \u201cYou were following me,\u201d she said. Black didn\u2019t answer. He looked away, unable to meet her gaze. Even in a parking lot at one in the morning, he was handsome. \u201cWell, screw it,\u201d Beth said. He was leaning against the driver\u2019s door, blocking her way, so she walked around the car to the passenger side. She\u2019d climb over the gearshift and drive off, leaving his nice-looking ass to fall to the concrete. But Black rounded the car the other way and blocked her again, putting his hand over hers as she reached out with her key. \u201cNice Cadillac,\u201d he said. It was. It was big and black. It was a nice car if you were a man, a big stupid man who cared about idiotic cars. It had been her father\u2019s\u2014he had bought it because a man as rich as he was, as high up in the world as he was, should own a Cadillac. But he\u2019d never loved this car, just like he never loved his expensive house or his expensive wife. His expensive daughter, even. This big, shiny car hadn\u2019t prevented her father from ending up dead on the kitchen floor. Beth pushed the words out at Detective Black like venom. \u201cI have to drive it because I don\u2019t have my other car. You do.\u201d Ransom had said that meant the cops were going to look for fingerprints, blood, hair. It was a waste of time. Beth wondered if they\u2019d find her father\u2019s fingerprints in that car, a shadow of him left over from when he was alive. \u201cYou\u2019ll get it back,\u201d Detective Black said. \u201cDon\u2019t bother.\u201d \u201cBeth, get in my car. I\u2019m not letting you drive.\u201d \u201cWho shines your shoes?\u201d He looked surprised. \u201cPardon?\u201d \u201cYour shoes are shiny,\u201d Beth said. \u201cYour clothes are pressed. You don\u2019t wear a wedding ring. So who does it?\u201d The detective blinked. \u201cI do it myself.\u201d \u201cThe shining and the pressing?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Beth had never known a man who did that. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a girlfriend?\u201d \u201cActually, yes, I do. I\u2019m engaged.\u201d \u201cThen why doesn\u2019t she press your shirts?\u201d \u201cIf you were engaged, would you press your fianc\u00e9\u2019s shirts?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d rather die, but I\u2019m never going to be engaged.\u201d \u201cOkay, then, we have that settled. Get in my car.\u201d She let him lead her to his car and let her into the passenger side. She was so tired, and she probably was too drunk to drive. Especially with a cop watching. She had enough trouble with the police as it was. \u201cWhat does she do?\u201d she asked Black as he got in the driver\u2019s side and slammed the door. \u201cWhat does who do?\u201d \u201cYour fianc\u00e9e.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d He turned the key in the ignition. \u201cShe\u2019s a teacher.\u201d Beth leaned back in her seat and watched him. It was fun to interrogate him for once, instead of the other way around. \u201cWhat does she teach?\u201d \u201cKindergarten.\u201d Beth laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re dating a kindergarten teacher?\u201d He stiffened as he pulled out of the parking lot. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d \u201cDo you actually think that\u2019s going to work?\u201d \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it work? We love each other.\u201d Beth wasn\u2019t convinced, but then again, she knew absolutely nothing about what love looked like. She only had her parents\u2019 example. \u201cShe\u2019s a teacher, and you\u2019re a detective,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe we\u2019ve established that.\u201d \u201cYou work long hours. Your business is dead people. You can\u2019t even tell her about anything you do. Did you see those dead men?\u201d Black stiffened, and she knew he had, both at the crime scenes and later, when the bodies were on slabs in a cold room somewhere. \u201cJesus, Beth, you\u2019re something else,\u201d he said, and it wasn\u2019t a compliment. Beth licked her lips, tasting the last of the vodka on them. No one liked her. She was used to that. She had beauty and money and sex appeal, and she slept alone every night while everyone she\u2019d ever met told the press she was likely a murderer. \u201cDo you drink?\u201d she asked him. \u201cI have the occasional beer.\u201d \u201cA glass of wine at Christmas,\u201d she said, thinking of her parents\u2019 liquor cabinet, which was stocked from floor to ceiling. All those bottles had seemed rich to her as a child, their deep blacks and browns and greens, their jewel-colored labels. Her mother had always liked to drink, but the drinking had been out of control after Julian died\u2014she\u2019d started every morning and she never stopped. She\u2019d made a run at emptying that cabinet, and Beth had done the same. And the pills . . . Her mother had been taking those pills. Black made a turn, heading up the hill to Arlen Heights in the darkness. Here, outside the city, there were no streetlights, no headlights behind them, barely any light at all. \u201cYou know,\u201d Detective Black said, his voice calm, \u201cwe\u2019re alone together in this car, and anything you say is off the record. Is there anything you\u2019d like to tell me?\u201d Suddenly, she was enraged. Absolutely enraged. That he thought she would fall for all of this: his handsomeness, his offer of a ride, his white-knight act when she was alone in the middle of the night. How stupid he thought she was. And then she realized. \u201cYou weren\u2019t following me at all,\u201d she said, rage making her voice tight. \u201cSomeone else was following me\u2014one of the lesser cops. And when he saw me go into that bar, he called you.\u201d Detective Black was silent. \u201cYou came out and took over and told him to go home,\u201d Beth said, \u201cbecause you wanted to talk to me alone. You thought it was a good opportunity, because I\u2019m drunk and lonely. You could charm me, make me feel special. Make me feel like we\u2019re friends. Get me to talk to you.\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t what you think,\u201d Black said. \u201cIt is,\u201d Beth said, still angry at him, but also at herself for falling for it, even for a minute. Ransom would kill her if he could see her right now. He\u2019d told her a hundred times never to talk to cops alone, that they were dangerous. He was right. Why was she too stupid to listen? \u201cLet me out of the car,\u201d she said. Detective Black\u2019s voice was tight. \u201cBeth, I\u2019m not letting you out of the car.\u201d \u201cDo it!\u201d she shouted, grabbing the door handle. She wasn\u2019t going to jump out of a moving car\u2014at least, she didn\u2019t think she was. But she was just drunk enough that her emotions were out of control, ping-ponging through her head, making her crazy. \u201cIt\u2019s pitch-black out there and dangerous.\u201d Black\u2019s jaw was tight; he was angry now, too, though he didn\u2019t even slow his driving. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of nowhere. I\u2019m not pulling over and letting you out. I\u2019m taking you home.\u201d \u201cFuck,\u201d Beth said, just to shock him. Then she said it a dozen more times, filling the car with the word. Men hated it when she said \u201cfuck.\u201d Women hated it, too, but it was more fun to shock men, watch the expressions on their faces as their opinion of her changed. And it always changed. Even the good-looking ones, the ones who\u2019d started out looking at her with appreciation\u2014their opinions changed just like everyone else\u2019s did. Detective Black waited it out, grimly driving the car as Beth finished her tantrum. When she finally slumped silent into her seat, he said, \u201cI told you, it isn\u2019t what you think. I didn\u2019t do this to entrap you. I did it to warn you.\u201d Beth didn\u2019t feel drunk anymore. She felt painfully sober, her head throbbing, her throat sore from all of the shouting she\u2019d done. She wanted to be drunk again. She was drained and tired and she didn\u2019t want to look at him anymore, because the more she looked at him, the more she was tempted to ask him to come inside the house with her, just to see if he\u2019d say yes. She could feel the thin thread of possibility, the razor\u2019s edge that she could ask him and he\u2019d come, even though everything about it was wrong, even though he had his kindergarten teacher. Maybe, just maybe, he\u2019d ruin himself for her. She could taste that on her tongue, and she wanted to spit it out. \u201cListen,\u201d he said when she didn\u2019t speak, oblivious to the turmoil in her exhausted brain. \u201cIt looks bad for you. I\u2019m telling you this in my professional capacity. Do you understand?\u201d She tried to bring her mind around. \u201cThey\u2019re going to arrest me.\u201d \u201cIt looks likely. You\u2019re their only suspect, and they have to arrest someone. The public has to see someone blamed for this.\u201d That made Beth angry again, because she saw the meaning of what he was saying. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe I did it.\u201d He was silent for a second. \u201cI\u2019ve lain awake every night for a week, trying to figure it out.\u201d He sounded almost as if he were talking to himself instead of her. They were in Arlen Heights now, winding through her darkened neighborhood. \u201cI can\u2019t understand why you would suddenly kill two random people. Why it feels wrong to me, yet it feels right at the same time. When I look at you, I see a dangerous killer, and I also see a girl who was left alone to wander lost after her parents died. I see both of those things at the same time, and it drives me crazy.\u201d Beth sat silent, her eyes burning. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d cried. \u201cThen I finally got it,\u201d Black said. There was quiet wonder in his voice. \u201cDamn it, the answer finally came to me, and it\u2019s worse than I thought. You\u2019re very clever, Beth, and I hate to say it, but you\u2019re also goddamned brave. What I still don\u2019t know is why you would do it.\u201d He pulled into her driveway now, his headlights illuminating the mansion that she hated so much. \u201cWhy I would do what?\u201d she asked, her voice dull, her stomach turning. Maybe whatever he thought he knew was wrong, but hope was dying in her by the minute. It had been dying since she got in the car. \u201cWhy you\u2019d cover for someone else\u2019s murders,\u201d he said. That did it. Beth pushed the car door open, leaned out, and threw up onto the driveway. \n CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE October 2017 SHEA It had started to rain as I sat in the corner bar. I could see the drops rolling down the windows. It wasn\u2019t even late; I\u2019d left Esther\u2019s right after dinner. Then I\u2019d sent myself straight from that awkward evening into this one. My hands were clammy where they curled around my glass of soda with lemon, but otherwise I was surprisingly calm. Even though I\u2019d only seen one photograph of him, I was sure I\u2019d recognize Michael De Vos when I saw him. And I did. He was wearing jeans, a white shirt, and a dark brown blazer that matched the dark brown of his hair. His brows were furrowed as he came through the door and scanned the dim room, and then he saw me. We stared at each other. Michael came toward me. His brows were still furrowed, like he was trying to figure something out, which he probably was. As he got closer, I realized he was bigger than I\u2019d thought\u2014over six feet tall. He looked nothing like my ex-husband, Van, who had his name because his parents were Van Morrison fans. Van was slender and occasionally grew a patchy beard. He was the kind of guy who looked ridiculous in baseball caps. Michael\u2019s shoulders filled out his jacket, and even though he was clean-shaven and clean-cut\u2014except for the fact that his hair was an inch too long\u2014he had shadows under his eyes. Still, the photo I\u2019d seen hadn\u2019t done justice to what he was like in person. He pulled out the chair across from me at my little table and sat on it. \u201cThis is a surprise,\u201d he said. It was his voice, the voice I knew so well from the phone. \u201cThanks for meeting me,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d His eyebrows rose. \u201cYou\u2019re my most mysterious client by far. I couldn\u2019t pass up the chance to finally meet you in person.\u201d I wondered if he was teasing me, but he wasn\u2019t. He actually thought I was mysterious. I glanced down at my jeans and hoodie, thought about my dark hair in its ponytail and my lack of makeup except for a few swipes of mascara. I didn\u2019t look anything like Beth, with her expensive slacks and beautiful turtlenecks. She was the epitome of the mysterious woman, the siren who walks into the detective\u2019s office and begs him to take the case of protecting her, sending him straight into trouble. That wasn\u2019t me. Still, I could channel a little of Beth right now. What would she do in this situation? Your problem is a simple power imbalance. It\u2019s your call. Make it. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you a cop anymore?\u201d I asked him. The waitress drifted by, and Michael ordered a beer. Then he turned back to me. \u201cI joined for the most clich\u00e9 of reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cTo please my father and my uncle, who were both cops. To get their approval. That was important to me, and I tried. I really did.\u201d \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t like it?\u201d I asked. \u201cI hated it. It took years for me to admit it. Being a beat cop was absolutely the wrong job for me. I\u2019m not the guy who can haul a two-hundred-pound drunk out of a bar or pull a child\u2019s corpse out of a wrecked car. I\u2019m not knocking it. It just wasn\u2019t me.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of guy are you, then?\u201d I asked him. \u201cI\u2019m a desk guy, a research guy. A puzzle guy.\u201d It should be incongruous for a man over six feet tall, but when I looked at Michael, somehow it fit. He had depths of intelligence behind his expression, and I knew he was adept at researching, writing, theorizing. Despite his size and muscle, deep down he was a nerd like me. \u201cYou have to do a lot of years and be really good to make detective, if they\u2019ll even take you,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the patience or the talent. So I weathered the disappointment from my family and my then wife, who thought she was marrying a cop, and I quit. Now I do this instead.\u201d \u201cYou do stakeouts and follow mysterious people,\u201d I said. He smiled a little. \u201cIt was fun making you curious about my cases, but the fact is that I mostly do insurance work, taking pictures of people who claim they\u2019re in chronic pain while they lift furniture or go waterskiing. It isn\u2019t very glamorous. That\u2019s why I like taking your assignments\u2014because it feels the most like real detective work. And working on the Lady Killer case is a dream for me. Does that answer your question?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cYou put up with a lot from me. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so weird.\u201d Michael shrugged as the waitress put his pint of beer in front of him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You probably have your reasons.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to talk about my reasons. Not tonight. \u201cWere your father and uncle cops in Claire Lake?\u201d \u201cYes, they were. If you\u2019re asking if they worked the Lady Killer case, my father was in uniform at the time. He did things like canvassing neighborhoods looking for witnesses, that sort of thing.\u201d \u201cYour father worked the Lady Killer case, and you didn\u2019t think to tell me?\u201d I said, incredulous. I thought of the photo of Beth\u2019s arrest, the uniformed cops in the background. \u201cWas he there the day Beth Greer was arrested?\u201d Michael\u2019s voice was tight. \u201cMost of the Claire Lake PD was there that day. And, yes, my father was there as well.\u201d \u201cAre you kidding me? Can I interview him? I think his memories would be valuable.\u201d His expression had gone carefully blank, though his posture stayed casual. \u201cYou can\u2019t interview my father, since he was an alcoholic who died at age forty-eight.\u201d I was such an idiot. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Even if my father was still alive, you wouldn\u2019t find it very pleasant to interview him. Not about this.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d I read his expression. \u201cYour father thought Beth Greer was guilty.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s one way of phrasing it. To the day he died, he referred to Beth Greer as \u2018a murdering whore.\u2019 \u201d I blinked. The words shouldn\u2019t have shocked me, but they did. \u201cWhat about your uncle?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat did he think?\u201d \u201cMy uncle Mike, who I\u2019m named after, fell off a ladder in 1977 and needed back surgery. He was off the job for six months, then confined to a desk for eight months after that. So he didn\u2019t work the Lady Killer case at the height of it. That always bothered him, because when the murders were happening, everyone in Claire Lake was afraid and it was all hands on deck. He hated that he wasn\u2019t part of the hunt. He died last year.\u201d I glanced at my drink, which was warm now, the ice in it melting to slivers. \u201cDid your uncle think Beth was a lying whore?\u201d \u201cMike was more soft-spoken than my father, but he thought Beth Greer was guilty. He thought she got away with murder.\u201d Michael frowned, thinking back. \u201cHe always said that it was difficult to understand unless you were in her presence, but Beth was hard. She didn\u2019t care about any of the victims, any of the deaths. She wasn\u2019t even surprised when they arrested her. And through the arrest, the trial, all of it, she always knew more than she let on. Mike said that if Beth Greer didn\u2019t do it, she sure as hell knew who did.\u201d I thought about that. About Beth coming to my office to buy me lunch unexpectedly, assuming I would go with her. About how she had wanted something, and how she\u2019d shaped the conversation to avoid the pitfalls she didn\u2019t want to get into. About how she had never once mentioned the Lady Killer victims in any of our conversations, as if they didn\u2019t matter to her. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting theory,\u201d I said, \u201cand Beth gives me the chills sometimes. But hard people, who don\u2019t care about others, don\u2019t cover for other people\u2019s crimes. They don\u2019t go to trial in a capital case for someone else. That doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d \u201cI agree, but Uncle Mike wasn\u2019t stupid. He had good cop\u2019s instincts. So does Joshua Black.\u201d \u201cBlack doesn\u2019t think Beth is the Lady Killer. He told me so.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s completely innocent, either.\u201d Michael smiled. \u201cAnd so we come around to the beginning again. Over and over.\u201d \u201cHow far did you get in the Linwood Street property records?\u201d I asked him. He took a deep sip of his beer. \u201cYou don\u2019t give out easy assignments, do you? Trying to figure out what was in every building on Linwood in 1951, when Mariana Greer was nineteen, looking for something that could have been a private mental hospital\u2014it\u2019s a challenge, even for a research geek like me.\u201d I slumped in my chair. \u201cI\u2019m wasting your time, aren\u2019t I? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He had other jobs, other clients, and I was asking him to work on this because of something a bitter old woman had told me. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m pursuing this. I\u2019m not a cop, or a journalist, or an investigator.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve read the Book of Cold Cases.\u201d Michael\u2019s voice was quiet. \u201cYou\u2019re a writer, Shea. Haven\u2019t you figured that out yet?\u201d I swallowed hard, my cheeks heating. I\u2019d never thought of myself as a writer\u2014just as a blogger with a strange hobby. But Michael thought I could do this. Detective Black thought I could do this. Maybe the only person who needed convincing was me. \u201cAt least send me an invoice,\u201d I said. Michael shook his head. \u201cI told you, the chance to crack the Lady Killer case after forty years is payment enough for me.\u201d He paused, and there was that moment\u2014that one moment, perfect and still, when I could have told him everything. Michael had told me so much, given me so much. I could tell him about me. The reason I had so many hang-ups that he didn\u2019t understand. The reason I\u2019d been afraid to meet him. The reason I was alone. I could tell Michael that I was Girl A. Hi there. Are you cold? The blood in my mouth when the man hit me that day, my hands scrabbling on the car door handle as I tried to jump out into the snow. The shocking impact when I hit the snowy pavement and the dry crunch as I got my boots beneath me and started to run. The plumes of my breath in the air as I ran and hid, certain that the man was circling the block, getting out of his car, coming after me. The creeping cold as I ran into a garden shed and stayed still, trying not to make a sound. I could tell Michael all of that, because for better or for worse, it was the truth about me. But we were sitting here face-to-face at last. He was handsome, and he understood me\u2014at least part of me\u2014and we were trying something new. It wasn\u2019t the time to tell him. It didn\u2019t escape me that I could talk about any number of gruesome murders, but I couldn\u2019t talk about the murder that had almost been mine. Actually, I could talk about those other murders because I couldn\u2019t talk about the one that had almost been mine. Besides, Michael wasn\u2019t telling me everything about himself, either. No one did. Everyone kept secrets, at least for a little while. \n CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO October 2017 SHEA \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the evidence,\u201d I said, turning on the recorder on my phone. It was Saturday, we were at the Greer mansion, and Beth was sitting on the sofa. She was wearing black full-length yoga pants and a black tee, her feet bare. She was lithe and elegant, ageless. She looked like a movie star\u2014Meryl Streep, perhaps\u2014graciously submitting to an interview. \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked me. \u201cI think you\u2019ve read the trial transcripts.\u201d \u201cMore than once,\u201d I said. The house was silent around us\u2014no pipes or electric hums, no far-off barking dogs. Except for the sound of a clock ticking on the wall, the Greer mansion was the quietest place I had ever been. My eyes kept traveling to the shadows in the corners, and my ears kept straining for any kind of sound. I hadn\u2019t wanted to come back here; I\u2019d dreaded it. But after seeking me out for lunch, Beth wouldn\u2019t meet me anywhere else. It was either come, or give up the chance to talk to her. In the end, I couldn\u2019t stay away. At least I was rested. I had started to sleep properly for the first time in ages\u2014Winston Purrchill liked to take half the bed, and I spent every night with his warm, solid presence beside me. I woke every morning with his calm face looking into mine as he pawed my cheek, insisting on breakfast. I\u2019d never been as comfortable sleeping beside my own husband as I was sleeping beside that cat. I had no idea what that said about me. \u201cThen you know what the evidence was,\u201d Beth said. \u201cThere was enough evidence to bring an indictment,\u201d I said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t nothing.\u201d Beth shrugged. I glanced down at my notes, though I didn\u2019t need to. I knew everything by heart. \u201cThere was the handwriting analysis. Comparing your handwriting to the Lady Killer notes.\u201d \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a match,\u201d Beth said. \u201cActually, the results were inconclusive.\u201d She jangled the ice in her glass. \u201cWhich isn\u2019t a match.\u201d I nodded. Handwriting analysis had been seen as gospel in 1977, but these days it had come under a lot of scientific fire. \u201cWhat if I offered to pay for a new analysis?\u201d \u201cIt still wouldn\u2019t be a match,\u201d Beth said. She was unreadable. I was far out of my league, dealing with someone who had been believed a killer for forty years. Still, I said, \u201cThe witness, Alan Parks, saw you leaving the second scene.\u201d Parks lived in Alaska now, and he\u2019d refused every one of my attempts to talk to him. \u201cHe saw the back of a head with red hair,\u201d Beth said. \u201cFor all we know, it was Ransom in a wig. And Alan Parks was drunk.\u201d \u201cBut he identified your photo. He admitted that he\u2019d had two whiskey sours before leaving the house to walk his dog. It wasn\u2019t exactly the kind of intoxication that would make someone hallucinate.\u201d \u201cAs an alcoholic myself, I think I can give expert testimony on this one. Two whiskey sours isn\u2019t sober.\u201d \u201cSo if he didn\u2019t see you that night, then what did he see?\u201d \u201cI have no idea what he saw. It was forty years ago.\u201d Beth\u2019s voice went softer as she watched me. \u201cDo you think you\u2019re scaring me with this line of questioning, Shea? I don\u2019t scare easily.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not trying to scare you.\u201d \u201cThen what are you trying to do?\u201d \u201cGet your perspective on things. Like I said when we first met, I want to know what it\u2019s like to be you.\u201d \u201cAll right, then. Do you want to know the most exciting day of my life? It was the day they arrested me.\u201d She looked at my expression and said, \u201cI\u2019m being serious. I didn\u2019t say it was a good day. I said it was exciting. You can\u2019t read an accurate account of that day in any of the newspapers of the time, because none of them printed the real story. They only said I\u2019d been arrested, and they ran that photo, the one with my tits in it.\u201d Her description was crude, but not entirely off base. She was talking about the photo of her in front of this very mansion, being led down the driveway with Detective Black on one arm and Detective Washington on the other. The photo in Who Was the Female Zodiac? in which she leaned toward the camera, her lips parted as if she were speaking. The pose and the angle, with her hands bound so tightly behind her, outlined the curves of her body, even beneath the trench coat. If she was a killer, she was the most sexual killer anyone had ever seen. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a famous photo,\u201d I said. \u201cNothing about that photo is as it seems,\u201d Beth said. \u201cBut then again, it made me look like a bitch. It played into the narrative that I was a serial killer. And it sold papers.\u201d \u201cThe gun,\u201d I said, trying to stick to the topic of evidence. \u201cThere was the ballistics report that said the same gun killed your father and the two Lady Killer victims. How do you explain that?\u201d Beth looked at me evenly. \u201cDo you think I killed my father?\u201d I stared back at her. \u201cThe truth?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d I bit my lip, thinking. \u201cI think it\u2019s unlikely. You were nineteen, and it was a very violent crime. You didn\u2019t need his money\u2014you were already his heiress, and you had all the money you wanted. You told me Julian wasn\u2019t abusive.\u201d Beth took a sip of her drink, listening. She looked tense, but if I had to guess, I thought part of her was enjoying this. \u201cThe thing is, though, it\u2019s possible,\u201d I went on. \u201cYour childhood wasn\u2019t happy\u2014you admit that. You were left alone a lot. You had no close friends. Most serial killers who have been studied can trace their tendencies back to childhood, and yours was definitely isolated. You\u2019ve never been psychologically examined by court order, so no one knows if you\u2019re a sociopath or not.\u201d \u201cGosh, you\u2019re a charming date,\u201d Beth said dryly. I gave her a shrug that was pure Beth, the one that said, Maybe you have a point, but probably not. \u201cYou asked. What I come back to when I think about it is that if it was you, then it was almost the perfect crime. Because who was going to suspect the grieving teenage daughter?\u201d There was a moment of silence, both of us watching each other in the silent living room. \u201cThe person who committed those murders,\u201d Beth said, her voice low and calm, \u201cwas dangerous. Someone with no conscience and no fear. Someone who wanted to see people die. Someone who wouldn\u2019t have stopped.\u201d Her eyes met mine. \u201cYou\u2019ve been asking about my parents, my childhood. Why don\u2019t you go upstairs and see my childhood for yourself?\u201d \u201cUpstairs?\u201d \u201cYes. The second door on the left was my childhood room. It\u2019s been left as it was, so you can see what I saw as a little girl. My father\u2019s study is up there\u2014his papers are still there if you want to read them. My parents\u2019 bedroom\u2014now my bedroom\u2014is at the end of the hall. My mother\u2019s clothes are still in the closet. Look at anything you like.\u201d Sick dread settled in my stomach. \u201cYou still have your mother\u2019s clothes?\u201d \u201cI can never quite seem to get rid of them,\u201d Beth said. \u201cI get so far, and then . . . well. Not all of the answers you want so desperately are going to come from me. Some of them are going to come from this house.\u201d The air was still, as if the house were listening, waiting. I didn\u2019t want to go upstairs, but I\u2019d made a decision when I came here in the first place. I\u2019d decided that despite whatever I\u2019d seen the last time, despite the voice I\u2019d heard on my phone, I wanted to risk it. I was tired of being so safe all the time. I was tired of being so afraid that I never lived my life. I wanted to see what was upstairs. I picked up my phone from the coffee table and turned off the recording. I was going to bring it with me and take pictures. I didn\u2019t ask Beth\u2019s permission. I stood and walked to the stairs. They were worn hardwood, with a runner placed down the middle that was well cared for but obviously as old as the rest of the house. I put my hand on the hardwood banister and climbed. The Greer mansion looked large from the outside, but the upstairs was a single hallway with a row of doorways on each side. The air was still, and there was carpet, a thin nap of dusty roses. There was no artwork on the walls, no family photos lining the hall. The boards beneath the flowers creaked softly under my feet. The doors lining the corridor were all closed. I opened the second door on the left. It was a small room, tidy, with a single twin bed made up with a gray blanket. An ornate desk sat against the other wall, the kind of desk a young girl might use. Next to it were bookshelves, empty. There was a rug in the middle of the floor. A wooden clock ticked on the wall. Beth Greer had been born in 1954. Which meant this room, her little-girl room, had sat here unchanged for some sixty years. Some families didn\u2019t change their children\u2019s rooms. They kept their kids\u2019 beds, their bookshelves, long after the child in question had grown up and moved out. My own mother had kept my and Esther\u2019s room intact until my parents moved to Florida. But that was a pattern born of love, of nostalgia, and the thought that maybe grandchildren would want to use the room someday. That wasn\u2019t what this was. This little girl\u2019s room had never been changed because the space wasn\u2019t needed in a house with so many rooms and only three people. It was unchanged because Mariana Greer couldn\u2019t be bothered. And then it stayed unchanged because both Julian and Mariana were dead, and Beth had let it sit for another forty years. What the hell was wrong with this place? I moved past the bedroom and farther down the hall. The air was still, even stuffier than it was downstairs. Like fresh air was alien to this place. The next door I tried opened to a bathroom, but the one after that was a room with a heavy wood desk with a blotter on it and a leather chair. Julian Greer\u2019s study. I stepped inside. I felt like an intruder in this room, as if the man who owned it would walk back in at any minute. He\u2019s been dead for over forty years, I reminded myself as I approached the desk and put my hand on one of the drawer handles. After a brief pause to inhale a breath, I yanked the drawer open. Inside was a pack of cigarettes. Winstons, in the distinctive red and white package. Next to it was a heavy metal lighter. There was an empty ashtray on the desk. I pushed aside the cigarettes, left here by a man dead for decades, and picked up a piece of paper from the stack beneath it. It was a phone bill dated January 3, 1972, listing the calls in and out of the house. My God. Had Beth thrown nothing away in all these years? This was some kind of mental illness, maybe even a psychosis. How was it possible that she looked so modern and fashionable when she lived in this museum? How could she be mentally stable when for forty years her life had been lived in a shrine to her parents? Beneath the phone bill was another, and another. On the third bill, I thought I saw the ghost of dark handwriting on the back of the paper. I turned it over and saw three words scrawled in ink: I\u2019m still here The breath left my throat. Those were the words I\u2019d heard whispered into my phone. I turned over the other two phone bills and saw the same three words written on the back. Suddenly, I\u2019d hazard a guess that I\u2019d see those words written on every piece of paper in this desk. I grabbed my phone out of my back pocket with numb fingers and snapped photos of the scrawled words. Thinking of the way the last interview had vanished from my phone, I immediately texted the pictures to Michael. I didn\u2019t even bother with a message. He knew I was at the Greer mansion right now. I hit send, and then I noticed that the air was cold. And there was the soft sound of someone breathing right outside the open door of the study. \u201cBeth?\u201d I called out. The air grew colder, and there was a soft shh. I looked down and saw that all of the desk drawers were open. I took a clumsy step back, then rounded the desk to bolt for the door. It slammed closed, and I saw the shadow of something moving in the crack beneath the bottom of the door and the floor. Not feet\u2014something sliding smoothly across the door, from one side to the other and back. I lifted my hand to the doorknob, and something pounded on the other side of the door. Bang. Bang. I stumbled back in shock, and my phone fell from my hand, spinning across the floor and under the desk. I dropped to my knees as the banging continued, heavy and rhythmic, almost a human sound but not quite. Flinching with each bang, I groped under the desk until my fingers found my phone. I glanced back over my shoulder and saw the smooth shadow still moving back and forth. It definitely wasn\u2019t human feet. I pulled my phone toward me. There was a crack across the screen. The banging stopped, and the room rang with silence. I rose to my knees and glanced beneath the door again. The shadow was gone. In my hand, my phone lit up, and a voice came from the recorder. A harsh whisper, like I\u2019d heard before. \u201cI\u2019m still here,\u201d the voice said. That was when I got to my feet and ran. \u2014 Beth wasn\u2019t downstairs. She wasn\u2019t in the living room. Her empty glass with its melting ice was sitting on the table. \u201cBeth!\u201d I shouted. Upstairs, I heard footsteps in the hallway, heading for the stairs. I grabbed my bag from the sofa and put it under my arm. The curtains in the living room were drawn, but I could see a shadow of something beyond them, out there on the grass. In my hand, my phone lit up again. The recorder played, and this time it sounded like an old recording, or maybe an old answering machine. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d a woman said through my cracked screen. \u201cIs she bitter, or is she sweet? I could never decide. Sometimes she was so sweet, but other times . . . Well, I don\u2019t like to think about it.\u201d I wanted to run, but something drew me to the window instead. I stepped forward and yanked the curtain open. There was the dead expanse of lawn outside, the empty ocean. A girl stood at the edge of the drop, her back to me. She was blond, slender, and young\u2014a teenager, wearing jeans and a flowered blouse. Her feet were bare. Her hair lifted in the wind. She stood for a moment, and then she tipped forward and vanished over the edge in a whisper of fabric. I shouted and pounded the glass. \u201cShe can get so angry,\u201d the voice on my dead phone said. \u201cShe loses control. But I think you should look behind you. She\u2019s coming down the stairs.\u201d There were footsteps behind me. I turned from the window and bolted from the house, down the front steps to the driveway. The cool, damp air hit my face like a slap. I was almost at the sidewalk when I sank to the ground, frozen in panic, my breath heaving and my stomach turning. I stared at the grass as the moisture soaked through the knees of my jeans and a bird called overhead. In the distance, a car went by. The world going about its business. Footsteps came toward me on the sidewalk. It was Beth. She had put on ballet flats and a trench coat\u2014not the old coat from the seventies, but a newer one, dark blue, expensive Burberry. It was belted at the waist, and the hem fell past her knees. In the cloudy light, she looked like the woman in the YouTube videos and the photographs, and also like the woman I knew. Her eyes were unreadable. When she came to my side, she lowered herself down to a crouch. She touched my cheek with her fingertip, dragging it lightly across my skin, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. \u201cFor someone so paranoid, you should choose your friends more carefully,\u201d she said. I was starting to breathe again. The fear was still there, but my stomach had slowed its nauseated turning. \u201cWho is she?\u201d I asked Beth. \u201cYou\u2019re so close,\u201d Beth said. \u201cYou have so many questions, so many things you want to know. You\u2019ve come closer than anyone else ever has. You\u2019ve almost finished the game, Shea. You\u2019ve almost won. Just use your brain and figure out the last part.\u201d Then she stood and walked to the Greer mansion. When she got to the steps, the front door swung open. Then Beth went inside, and the door closed behind her with a click. And she was gone. \n PART II \n CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE December 1977 BETH She tried going out at night. She crept out of her own house like a criminal, getting in her car and driving around Claire Lake as it slept. But even at night she was noticeable, her big Cadillac gliding through the silent streets. Ever since the night with Detective Black, the police had almost always been on her tail, and even during her night drives, she\u2019d see headlights behind her. So she gave up and went home. She\u2019d gone last night, not getting home until almost four. The tension was going to kill her; alcohol was the only thing that killed it. She was lying on the sofa, halfway through a bottle of wine and blearily watching TV with all of the curtains closed at two in the afternoon when the phone rang. She reached a hand to the end table and picked it up. \u201cHello?\u201d There was the sound of breathing on the other end of the line. In the background, wind and traffic, as if the call was coming from a roadside phone booth. And just like that, she knew who it was. She knew what voice would be on the other end, even though she hadn\u2019t heard it in two years. The voice she\u2019d been searching for. The voice she hated. The haziness of the wine started to drain away. \u201cLily,\u201d Beth said. The voice on the other end was beloved and terrifying, strange and also as familiar as her own. \u201cThey\u2019re coming for you,\u201d Lily said. The police. She was talking about the police. \u201cThey\u2019re coming now?\u201d \u201cYes, they are.\u201d \u201cHow do you know?\u201d \u201cThey think they\u2019re so discreet.\u201d The voice was disgusted. \u201cHonestly. I could see them from the road.\u201d Beth sat up. If Lily was talking about the road, then she was near the house. No, she couldn\u2019t be. But she\u2019d driven past. While Beth had been sitting on this sofa, drinking and waiting, Lily had driven past before finding a phone booth. How many times had she done that, when Beth had been looking for her for so many days? \u201cYou bitch,\u201d Beth said. \u201cMaybe, but I\u2019m sitting here while you\u2019re about to be arrested. This is all your fault, Beth. You could have stopped it.\u201d She wasn\u2019t drunk now, not at all. Panic tried to climb up her throat. \u201cI didn\u2019t do all of this. You did.\u201d \u201cOnly because you made me.\u201d Lily sighed into the phone. \u201cI even left a note. Did you read it?\u201d Of course she had. The note had been in all the papers. Am I bitter or am I sweet? Ladies can be either. Which one are you today? Mariana would say when they were little girls. Are you bitter, or are you sweet? And the girls would have to choose. Lily always chose bitter, which would make Mariana laugh and shake her head. Beth would say she was sweet. Mariana never laughed at that. She\u2019d just nod and say, \u201cHow nice.\u201d \u201cWhy are you calling?\u201d Beth asked Lily now, listening to her breathe on the other end of the line. \u201cI want to know what you\u2019ll do,\u201d Lily said. \u201cWhether you\u2019ll run. Whether you\u2019ll break. Whether you\u2019ll talk.\u201d \u201cI could tell them everything.\u201d \u201cWill you tell them how you could have stopped it?\u201d Lily asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve been looking for me, haven\u2019t you? Driving the streets, searching. Too bad you didn\u2019t find me. You should have looked harder.\u201d She should have. She knew that now. She\u2019d been panicked and half-drunk, and for some reason she\u2019d thought she\u2019d have more time. But now she was out of time. Was that the crunch of gravel, the low hum of a motor? More than one? There wasn\u2019t a lot of traffic in Arlen Heights, especially in the middle of the day. The police were coming, and Beth\u2019s time was up. Lily\u2019s voice was clear, unhurried, as if she knew Beth would obey even as the police closed in. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving, Beth,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not talking.\u201d \u201cI hate you,\u201d Beth said, her throat choking and her eyes burning with unshed tears. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Lily said. \u201cYou really don\u2019t.\u201d Beth put down the phone, her breath sawing in her throat. Her palms tingled with sweat. She needed to call Ransom. There was the sound of another car outside. Lily was a liar, but she wasn\u2019t lying about this. Beth was about to be arrested for murder. This is all your fault, Beth. You\u2019re not leaving. You\u2019re not talking. And just like it had during the police interview, the fear snapped and the anger took over. That cold, comforting rage. Beth went upstairs, changed her clothes. Put on dark high-waisted jeans, a cream blouse with a pattern of brown diamonds on it, her favorite shirt. Red lipstick. Hoops in her ears. There were more sounds now, low voices at the side of the house. Did they think they were being stealthy? Lily was right; it was ridiculous. Did they think she would run? Where did they think she would go? Beth put on heeled boots, and then as a final gesture she put on her trench coat, belting it at the waist. She picked up her purse. She walked to the windows in the living room and dragged open the curtains. There were men outside. Uniformed cops, bracing in position. They looked startled at the sight of her. Beth gave them a wave. She walked calmly to the front door and opened it. There were cops here, too, on the lawn. A brown Pontiac at the end of the driveway, pulled up behind her Cadillac. Marked cruisers parked farther down the street. A crowd of neighbors was gathering, and the press was already here, two reporters and two photographers flashing pictures of Beth standing in her doorway. As she watched, a van pulled up two doors down and a female reporter got out, followed by a TV cameraman. The woman left the cameraman behind with his heavy equipment and jogged up the street in her high heels when she saw Beth. Beth watched the chaos building in front of her house, feeling oddly calm. She wondered if Lily would drive by again, just to see the scene she\u2019d created. It would be a crazy move, but you never knew what Lily would do. The doors of the brown Pontiac opened, and Detectives Black and Washington got out. They were wearing suits, and both of them looked unhappy. This circus wasn\u2019t what they\u2019d wanted; someone somewhere must have leaked information to the press. Beth took a grim satisfaction in the frowns on their faces, the angry displeasure in Washington\u2019s eyes. What did Beth care about a few photographs if this mess embarrassed them? As the detectives came up the driveway, yet another car pulled up to the curb. Ransom got out, his hair a little disheveled and his tie askew. He saw her on the front porch and pointed at her. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything, Beth!\u201d he shouted. \u201cNot a word!\u201d \u201cMiss Greer!\u201d the female reporter called to her, jogging up the driveway behind the detectives, flanking them. A flashbulb went off. \u201cMiss Greer, do you have anything to say on the day of your arrest for the Lady Killer murders?\u201d \u201cGet out of here,\u201d Detective Washington growled. The reporter fell back a step but didn\u2019t leave. Beth put her hands in the pockets of her trench coat and watched. Ransom started across her lawn toward her, his expensive shoes sinking into the damp grass. \u201cDetective Black!\u201d one of the other reporters shouted. \u201cWhat evidence do you have that Beth Greer is the Lady Killer? Was she having an affair with the victims?\u201d \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d shouted the man who lived two doors down, his face going red as he stood in the street. \u201cThis is a good neighborhood!\u201d As if in response, another police cruiser came around the corner, this one flashing its lights and blaring its siren. Someone in Arlen Heights had called the police\u2014on the police. The uniformed cops on the lawn shouted, and Black and Washington turned and waved their arms at the cruiser, signaling it to shut up. It, too, pulled over, and the siren went quiet, though the lights still flashed, flickering over the sunny day. Another reporter showed up, and another camera flashed. The TV cameraman had gotten his bulky equipment up and running and was now shooting the whole scene. Washington gestured to one of the uniforms. \u201cHelp us out over here.\u201d The uniform hurried over, and Washington said, \u201cWe need you to handcuff her.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t need handcuffs, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Detective Black said. \u201cIt\u2019s a goddamned murder arrest!\u201d Washington barked at him. \u201cI don\u2019t care what she looks like, we\u2019re handcuffing her!\u201d \u201cYou will not!\u201d Ransom was climbing the front porch steps now. He was out of breath and his shoes were wet, but Beth could see instantly that he was in his element, that this kind of moment was the thing he lived for. He elevated his voice to a theatrical boom so the reporters could hear it. \u201cThe police will not mistreat my client!\u201d \u201cGet out of the way, Wells!\u201d Washington shouted. \u201cAnd someone turn those fucking cherry lights off!\u201d Beth looked at the reporters\u2019 faces and knew they\u2019d all heard the profanity, that it had been caught on record on the TV camera. \u201cNo handcuffs,\u201d Black said as the uniformed cop took his handcuffs out. Beth kept her hands in the pockets of her trench coat. Ransom was standing beside her now. Flashbulbs were going off, mixing with the lights from the police car, and more reporters were shouting questions. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this,\u201d Washington said. He grabbed the cuffs from the uniform and strode up the porch steps, reaching out to grasp Beth\u2019s arm. His grip was hard and painful as he jerked her hand from her pocket. \u201cElizabeth Greer, you\u2019re under arrest,\u201d he said, beginning to drone on about courts of law and rights to remain silent. \u201cHands off my client!\u201d Ransom shouted. \u201cShe is offering no resistance! Are you getting this on the tape? Did you get that?\u201d Beth let Washington spin her, yank her other hand out of her pocket. She let herself go limp, like a doll, as his grip bruised her. He cuffed one wrist, then pulled the other behind her back. Beth caught the wince of shocked disgust on Detective Black\u2019s face and realized Washington was going far off the script. He wasn\u2019t supposed to use handcuffs, and if he used them he was probably supposed to cuff her hands in front. With her hands cuffed in the back, she looked like a common criminal, like someone caught breaking windows or fondling children. Even though she was accused of two murders, Black didn\u2019t think Beth was a common criminal. She could see it on his face. The cuffs were cold, and they bit into her wrists. Beth didn\u2019t wince. She rolled her shoulders, shifted her weight so the cuffs didn\u2019t pull as hard. This is all your fault, Beth. You could have stopped it. \u201cI want the record to show that my client is cooperating,\u201d Ransom was bellowing. \u201cWe have here on the footage that the police are assaulting her. My client may file charges.\u201d Washington was pulling Beth down the steps now, and Black quickly took her other side as reporters crowded in. There were more flashes mixing with the police lights, microphones shoved in her face. \u201cBeth!\u201d one reporter shouted. \u201cBeth, do you have anything to say? Anything at all?\u201d She could feel Ransom\u2019s wrath from three feet away, could feel Detective Black stiffen against her right side. Telegraphing to her to be quiet. This was the moment, she realized. She wasn\u2019t just a rumor anymore. She wasn\u2019t just a headline. Now she was a murderer. Lily had made her a murderer. Beth leaned away from Washington, angling her body toward the microphone. The pose, with her hands behind her back, outlined her figure for the cameras, even with the trench coat on. She knew it as well as she knew her own body in the mirror. She kept her voice calm, as if she were talking to someone boring at a cocktail party. \u201cThe police can manhandle me all they want, but it still doesn\u2019t make me guilty,\u201d she said. There was a murmur of reaction, more shouted questions, and then Washington was putting her into the back seat of the brown Pontiac, his hand on her head. \u201cWatch it,\u201d she heard Black say to him. \u201cBeth, I\u2019ll follow you,\u201d Ransom shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything.\u201d He turned and hurried back to his car, shaking his head as reporters followed him, trying to get him to comment. It was awkward sitting in the car with her hands cuffed behind her back. Beth shifted on the seat, trying to brace herself without pinning her arms and twisting her shoulders as the detectives got in front and Washington put the car into gear. \u201cWe need to switch her cuffs,\u201d Black said as the car inched down the driveway, crowded with people. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d Washington shot back. \u201cShe\u2019ll live. We\u2019re not getting her back out of the car now.\u201d Black was silent as they finally pulled free of the crowd of people, which was starting to disperse. From the window, Beth could see reporters running back to their cars, the TV cameraman getting a last shot of the car backing out before lowering his camera and turning back to his van. \u201cBeth, are you all right?\u201d Detective Black asked her. She ignored him. The neighbors were talking, and thanks to the reporters her arrest would be all over the news by six o\u2019clock. She had been arrested for murder, a catastrophe that meant life as she knew it was over. Everyone thought she was the Lady Killer. She was on her way to jail, and then to a trial, which she could very well lose. She had just been publicly humiliated, dragged from her front porch and pushed into a police car in a spectacle of an arrest. It was all because of Lily, who by now was probably on the road out of town, the pay phone she\u2019d called from sitting empty. And still, as Arlen Heights receded in the background, Beth could only think one thing: That was goddamned fun. \n CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR October 2017 SHEA In the first days after my last visit to the Greer mansion, I was afraid. I kept my cracked phone in the bottom of my purse, unable to look at it. I went to work and back in silence, sitting alone on the bus with my bag in my lap. I stopped listening to audiobooks, because I didn\u2019t want to hear about death anymore. Instead I sat with a roaring in my ears, as if something were going to happen any second and I had to be ready. I forced myself to concentrate at work. I never went out after dark. I checked my security system multiple times before going to bed. And when I finally slept, my dreams were full of blood and a familiar voice, saying: Hi there. Are you cold? No matter how many times I awoke thrashing and sweating, Winston Purrchill was always on the bed next to me, regarding me with his sleepy eyes, drowsily wondering what was wrong. I fell asleep over and over with my hand on his soft fur or my face next to the solid curve of his back, watching the rise and fall of his breathing, listening as the low, uncouth rumble of his purr drifted off into sleep. I would have lost my sanity without my cat that week. If Alison or her ex-husband ever showed up to take him back, they would do it over my dead body. And then something changed. Maybe I got tired of the fear; maybe it just lost its grip. But instead of being afraid, I got mad. I thought about those blows against the door of Julian\u2019s study, and instead of terror I only felt anger. I couldn\u2019t explain it, and I couldn\u2019t even trace it to a source\u2014I was suddenly furious at everything. At Beth. At the man who had tried to abduct me when I was a child. At whoever had killed Thomas Armstrong and Paul Veerhoever and left them by the side of the road like trash. At all of the murderers\u2014so many of them\u2014who got away with it and left the victims to end up on the Book of Cold Cases, one after another. It all tumbled together in my mind. I\u2019d never been this angry, and now I started to see what I\u2019d been missing. After I got home from work one day, I got a text from Michael. I had to pull my cracked phone from the bottom of my bag to read it. There\u2019s some missing information in the online property records. We\u2019ll have to try the records office downtown to see if they have the archive. Okay, I texted back. Sending you an email now, he wrote. There are two addresses that are missing records prior to 1960. I\u2019m sending you everything I have. Okay, I wrote again. His next text came back right away: Are you all right? Of course Michael knew something was wrong. I stared at the words, wondering what the answer was. Based on what was going on in my head, I seemed to be going crazy. But to tell the truth, I wasn\u2019t so sure. I looked at the crack on my phone screen. I\u2019d dropped my phone when something\u2014maybe something dead\u2014had banged on the door of Julian\u2019s study. I\u2019d thought about getting my phone fixed or replaced, but I hadn\u2019t done it yet. Suddenly I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to. I opened a drawer in my desk, pulled out the number Detective Joshua Black had given me, and dialed it before I could lose my nerve. \u201cIt\u2019s Shea Collins,\u201d I said when he answered. \u201cShea.\u201d His voice sounded pleased. \u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d There were a hundred questions I could have asked him, but that wasn\u2019t why I called. Instead I said, \u201cHave you ever hated Beth?\u201d \u201cOn and off for forty years.\u201d He said it without missing a beat, and I immediately knew I had called the right person. \u201cAre you in that phase right now?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so angry,\u201d I admitted as I gripped my cracked phone. \u201cI can\u2019t stop. I don\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d Detective Black was quiet for a long minute, his breaths somehow soothing on the other end of the line. Then he said, \u201cShea, I\u2019m going to say something, and you\u2019re not going to like it. But it\u2019s my job to tell the truth.\u201d I swallowed. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d \u201cAnton Anders has a parole hearing coming up.\u201d It was my turn to be silent, the emotions churning in my gut robbing me of words. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go,\u201d Black said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it so many times with victims. And for some of them, it\u2019s the wrong thing to go. But you need to go to that hearing.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d The word was automatic. The letter from the parole board was still buried in a pile of mail. I hadn\u2019t touched it. I also hadn\u2019t thrown it out. \u201cThink about it,\u201d Detective Black said. \u201cBecause the truth is, you don\u2019t have to sit home, afraid. And you can hate Beth\u2014God knows, I have. But even if you hate her, you have to keep going. Because the truth is going to come out.\u201d I thanked him and hung up a few moments later. I was calmer now. I woke up my laptop and checked my email. The first email that came up was a Google alert. I had a few alerts set up for various true-crime cases I\u2019d written about, in case there were any updates. This one was my alert for crimes in Claire Lake. I would read that one later. The second email that came in was from Michael\u2014the property records on Linwood Street. All I had to do was open the email and start the work of filling in the missing parts. Instead of being angry or afraid, I could get to work. I looked again at Michael\u2019s text on my phone: Are you all right? I let out a breath and texted back: I am now. \u2014 The next day, I left work an hour early. Still wearing my scrub top and jeans, my purse over my shoulder, I hurried four blocks from the office to the city courthouse, getting to the records office half an hour before it closed. The records office sent me to the archives office\u2014apparently a different thing entirely\u2014so I lost an extra five minutes wandering the basement hallways, looking for the right sign. I finally found the archives office and stepped inside. Except for the clerk, I was the only one there. \u201cI\u2019m looking for the records for these two addresses,\u201d I said, sliding a piece of paper with the Linwood Street addresses on it. \u201cI need the pre-1960 records, and they aren\u2019t online.\u201d The clerk behind the counter, a fortyish woman with bobbed hair, slid on her reading glasses and scanned it. \u201cThat\u2019s over forty years ago. Anything over forty years is kept in a different room. That takes longer.\u201d That would be my third room in a row. \u201cYou can\u2019t get them now?\u201d She glanced at the clock, not bothering to hide it. \u201cSubmit a request form, and someone will contact you in the next few days.\u201d She was trying to be firm, but I sensed an opening. \u201cWe can do this in the next ten minutes,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you, read the files, and you\u2019ll still go home on time. I promise.\u201d \u201cTen minutes?\u201d She looked at the clock again, then looked at me, this time curiously. \u201cWhy do you need this so urgently, anyway?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a writer.\u201d When she looked at my scrub top, I added, \u201cIn the evenings. I\u2019m writing a book.\u201d Her eyes went wide. \u201cOh. A mystery?\u201d \u201cYes, a mystery.\u201d \u201cI love Lee Child.\u201d \u201cSo do I,\u201d I said, which was actually true. \u201cI\u2019m writing something a little like that, and I have a great story idea. I just want to have a quick look at the file to settle a research point.\u201d To juice the story up, I added, \u201cI think one of these buildings might have been a private psychiatric hospital.\u201d \u201cAn old psychiatric hospital, huh? That\u2019s a pretty good setting.\u201d Her expression softened. There was no one in line behind me, no one else in the room. \u201cOkay, put the \u2018Closed\u2019 sign on the door behind you and we\u2019ll go quick. I want to be out of here at five minutes to five.\u201d Thank you, Lee Child, I thought as she let me behind the counter and admitted me to the file room. It was a dim, dry place, windowless and claustrophobic, lit with fluorescent light and lined with file boxes. The clerk, who now told me her name was Carole, pulled two boxes and opened them. \u201cThere won\u2019t be much,\u201d she warned, \u201cfor buildings that old.\u201d I flipped through the file for the first address, scanning as fast as I could. Normally I would have taken Carole\u2019s advice, filled out the form, and taken my time researching what I needed, but my gut told me I was running low on time. Either there was something here, or there wasn\u2019t. I needed to know. I didn\u2019t find anything interesting in the first building\u2019s history, and with five minutes to go, I went to the second box. While Carole gave me an impatient sigh in warning, I flipped back in time for the building at 120 Linwood. And there it was: The original building was built in 1940, and ownership was transferred to something called the Elizabeth Trevor House for Women in 1949. I had never heard of the Elizabeth Trevor House for Women, but I sensed that it could be a lead. I pulled out my phone and took a photo of the records page, then another of a property tax report. There was a record of sale back to a private family in 1956, and I photographed that, too. \u201cHey,\u201d Carole said. \u201cNo photos allowed.\u201d \u201cJust one more minute.\u201d I tried to text the photos to Michael, but there was no signal inside the records room. I tried pulling up my phone\u2019s browser to search the Elizabeth Trevor House for Women, but nothing would load. \u201cOkay, I have to go home,\u201d Carole said. She was exasperated with me. I didn\u2019t blame her. \u201cDid you find what you were looking for?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I looked for anything else in the file that would give me a clue; there was nothing. I put the file back in the box and helped Carole put the boxes back, feeling foolish. I\u2019d barged in and derailed the last fifteen minutes of her day like I was doing something important, but it was probably a dead end. I bet this never happened to Lee Child. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t a psychiatric hospital?\u201d Carole asked as we walked back out of the archives room and she locked the door with a key from the ring in her hand. I tried my phone again, but there was still no signal. We were too deep in the basement. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It was something called the Elizabeth Trevor House for Women. There\u2019s no signal down here, so I can\u2019t tell you what that was.\u201d Carole had paused and was looking at me with a bemused look on her face. \u201cThe Elizabeth Trevor House? I\u2019ve never heard of it, but that wouldn\u2019t have been a psychiatric institution. You\u2019re barking up the wrong tree.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cElizabeth Trevor wasn\u2019t crazy, at least that I know of, so they wouldn\u2019t have put her name on a mental hospital.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I blinked at her. \u201cWho was Elizabeth Trevor?\u201d Carole tutted at me with the pleasure of someone who knows an obscure piece of trivia that has finally become useful. \u201cYou should brush up on your Claire Lake history,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially your feminist history. Elizabeth Trevor was a factory worker who got fired because she got pregnant when she wasn\u2019t married. She campaigned for rights for unwed mothers. In those days, single mothers were discriminated against by employers, landlords, doctors, everyone. Elizabeth Trevor tried to change all that. She was a badass.\u201d Carole nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re not looking for a psychiatric hospital; you\u2019re looking for a home for unwed mothers. Are we done here? I\u2019m going home.\u201d \n CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE October 2017 SHEA \u201cJesus, Shea, what is it? I got here as fast as I could.\u201d Michael slid into the booth opposite me, brushing his hair back from his forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard you sound like that.\u201d Panicked\u2014that was how I must have sounded. Excited. Alive. I cupped my hands around my hot coffee cup. We were in a diner around the corner from the courthouse. People were coming to grab takeout on their way home from work. I was still in my scrub top under my jacket and was finding it hard to keep warm. The shock was starting to get to me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said to Michael. \u201cI know you were probably busy.\u201d He shrugged and motioned to the waitress for a coffee. He was wearing a gray T-shirt under a dark brown blazer, a look that was just formal enough that I knew he had been working when I called. \u201cIt sounded important. I wanted to hear what it is.\u201d I let out a breath. \u201cThis is going to sound insane,\u201d I said. \u201cCompletely insane.\u201d \u201cOkay. I\u2019m ready.\u201d \u201cI may have just cracked the Lady Killer case.\u201d The waitress brought Michael\u2019s coffee, and I watched her give him a once-over before she walked away. Michael didn\u2019t notice. He also didn\u2019t touch the cup. \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d he asked, his gaze fixed on me. \u201cBeth\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t mentally ill,\u201d I said. \u201cSylvia got it wrong. The place Mariana went before she was married, the papers Julian had\u2014she wasn\u2019t admitted to a mental hospital. She was in a home for unwed mothers.\u201d I watched it hit him, the way it had hit me. The way it was still hitting me, almost an hour later. \u201cI found it in the file for 120 Linwood,\u201d I said, pulling out my phone and calling up the photos I\u2019d taken of the file. I turned the phone so he could see the photos on my cracked screen. \u201cFrom 1949 to 1956, it was the Elizabeth Trevor House for Women. There are no records of the place online, but there are articles about Elizabeth herself. She was an activist for the rights of unwed mothers.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d Michael peered closer at my photo, trying to read. \u201cI\u2019m going to send myself this,\u201d he said. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d I watched as he texted himself the photos. \u201cThe timeline adds up,\u201d I said. \u201cMariana is at the Elizabeth Trevor House before her wedding to Julian. It\u2019s kept a secret. After they\u2019re married, Julian and Mariana have Beth. Then, a few years later, Mariana\u2019s mother dies, and her will leaves everything to Julian instead of Mariana. Including her secret papers.\u201d \u201cJulian would learn of the secret for the first time,\u201d Michael said. \u201cWe have to assume the premarital baby wasn\u2019t Julian\u2019s, then.\u201d \u201cProbably not, but who knows?\u201d I took my phone back. \u201cEither way, he\u2019d be angry, but especially if the baby wasn\u2019t his.\u201d \u201cSo Beth Greer has a half sibling.\u201d Michael picked up his forgotten coffee and sipped it, thinking. \u201cA half sister,\u201d I said. His eyebrows rose. \u201cHow do you know the baby was a girl?\u201d Because I saw her standing at the edge of the drop behind the Greer mansion, her blond hair blowing in the wind. I saw her go over. I\u2019ve heard her voice on my phone, telling me she\u2019s still here. \u201cThink about it,\u201d I said. \u201cThe woman\u2019s handwriting on the murder notes. The woman seen at the crime scene who resembles Beth. The fact that no physical evidence ever tied Beth to the crimes. Because it wasn\u2019t her, but it was the next best thing. It was her sister.\u201d \u201cWe need documents.\u201d Michael rubbed his temple. \u201cA birth certificate. Patient records from the unwed mothers\u2019 home. Some type of ID so we can track this woman and find out where she is, what her life has been, if she\u2019s still alive.\u201d \u201cShe isn\u2019t still alive,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d I did. There were some things I knew better than Michael did. The woman who had pounded on the door of Julian\u2019s study had definitely not been alive. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on the handwriting samples you sent me,\u201d Michael was saying, making rapid notes on his phone. \u201cThe Claire Lake PD never released a photo of the original notes, but I\u2019m sure I can find something. A photo we can compare to the handwriting you saw in Julian Greer\u2019s study.\u201d He continued typing, his coffee forgotten again. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that Mariana\u2019s first baby died and we\u2019re completely off track, which is why we need records. But to track down this lead\u2014Jesus, Shea, we have so much work to do.\u201d He was right. We had a lot of work to do, and all of it was important. And it was possible I was wrong. But I wasn\u2019t wrong. I had heard Mariana\u2019s voice. Is she bitter, or is she sweet? Sometimes she was so sweet, but other times . . . Well, I don\u2019t like to think about it. \u2014 When my phone rang hours later, at one o\u2019clock in the morning, I wasn\u2019t sleeping. I knew who was calling. I picked up the receiver and said, \u201cBeth?\u201d \u201cI can never sleep,\u201d Beth said. \u201cCan you?\u201d I sat up, wide awake. \u201cI won the game,\u201d I said. \u201cDid you?\u201d Her voice didn\u2019t have its usual fight. She sounded tired, so tired. Still, I pushed on. \u201cYour mother had a child before she married your father. You have a sister. I\u2019m going to find her.\u201d Beth sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to regret that. But, then, it\u2019s too late. You\u2019ve already met Lily.\u201d Lily. \u201cIs that her real name?\u201d \u201cWhat a curious question,\u201d Beth said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only name I\u2019ve ever known her by. And I\u2019ve known her a long, long time.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t she?\u201d \u201cIf you already know the answer, why are you asking the question?\u201d My spine tensed. Next to me on the bed, Winston Purrchill gave me a look of displeasure as I disturbed his sleep. \u201cI saw her,\u201d I said. \u201cStanding behind the house. She was blond. Pretty, I think. She went over the edge. Is that what happened, Beth? Did she jump?\u201d There was a short, bitter laugh on the other end of the line. \u201cLily would never have killed herself. That would have been too easy. She was showing off, trying to scare you. You\u2019re lucky. You should see what she does to the people she doesn\u2019t like.\u201d And there it was\u2014the crux of everything. When you looked beneath the files and the records and the search for proof, this meant that the pretty girl I\u2019d seen with her blond hair blowing in the wind had been the deadliest serial killer in Claire Lake history. She had shot two men point-blank in the face. She had killed Julian Greer and left him to bleed on the floor. \u201cWho was she?\u201d I asked Beth. \u201cThere are so many answers to that question.\u201d Beth\u2019s voice was slurring a little. She sounded drunk, but she didn\u2019t drink. She must have taken a pill. \u201cShe was the shame of my mother\u2019s life. She was the person who ruined mine.\u201d \u201cAnd yet you covered for her crimes. You went to trial for her. You nearly went to death row.\u201d \u201cI had my reasons,\u201d Beth said. \u201cIf you knew Lily, you\u2019d understand.\u201d She paused, and then her voice lowered to a slurred hush. \u201cI think I hear her now.\u201d \u201cBeth?\u201d There was quiet on the line, rustling. Then Beth said, \u201cCome tomorrow, and I\u2019ll tell you. It\u2019s time. This is all going to be over soon, and I\u2019m so damned tired.\u201d I felt a bolt of alarm at the idea. \u201cBeth, I don\u2019t want to come to that house.\u201d \u201cNo, but you will.\u201d Despite the drugged tone of her voice, she still had that imperious way of talking. \u201cYou will. Here she comes.\u201d She hung up. I stared into the darkness, thinking about Beth spending the night alone in that house, with whatever lived there. About spending every night there for forty years. Tomorrow\u2014today, technically\u2014was Saturday. I could get up in a few hours, get on the bus, and go to the Greer mansion to hear everything. Or I could stay home, and avoid whatever waited in that house for me. I lay back on the bed, stared at the ceiling, and wondered which one I would do. \n CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX November 1960 BETH At age six, they told Beth she was lucky. She was living in a big house high above the ocean, with a backyard that looked over the water. She had a room all to herself and no siblings to argue with. She had all of her parents\u2019 attention and never had to share it. She went to private school, where she wore a uniform of a navy blue skirt and a dark green sweater that was very becoming against her red hair. Beth is pretty and extremely bright, her teachers told her parents, though it puzzles us why she doesn\u2019t talk much in school. Oh, don\u2019t worry about that, her mother told the teachers. Beth is just lonely. It\u2019s how she\u2019s always been. In the evenings after school, Beth would sit in her room and study a little\u2014everything was so easy\u2014but mostly she\u2019d look out the window. Her parents didn\u2019t want her company; children were to be seen, not heard or really spoken to. Her parents didn\u2019t want each other\u2019s company, either, and most nights one or the other of them was out. That didn\u2019t bother Beth, because she believed that was the way everyone\u2019s parents were. So Beth would sit alone in her window seat, looking over the darkened back lawn, which sloped down to the ocean. The lawn was vast and green and empty. It did not have a swing set or even a patio. The house ended, and there was just green and then endless water, as if the world were waiting to swallow the house whole. Beth did not play on the lawn. She didn\u2019t practice cartwheels on the grass or go down to the ocean and put her toes in the cold water, balancing in her bare feet on the wet rocks. She didn\u2019t take her dolls out there to have tea or pretend she was an explorer with her stuffed animals as her assistants. She wasn\u2019t expressly forbidden to do those things\u2014her parents paid little attention to what she did, even when they were home\u2014but the fact was, she didn\u2019t want to. The lawn wasn\u2019t a good place. There was no part of this house that was a good place, really. But still, people said she was lucky. She was. The house so beautiful, so big. The fact that it wasn\u2019t good didn\u2019t seem to matter to the people who told her she was lucky. Those people didn\u2019t have to live here. If someone had asked her\u2014which no one did\u2014what exactly was wrong about the house, she couldn\u2019t have said. There weren\u2019t creaks or cobwebs or groaning ghosts. It was something about the high ceilings, the elaborate moldings, the slightly off angles of the rooms when you walked down the corridors. There was an older house that had been partly torn down and remodeled into a newer one, and the old house didn\u2019t like it. It was still in pain. It was a silly, childish thing to believe, and yet when she lay in bed at night, she imagined it was true. Her father, in some before-Beth-was-born renovation, had had plate glass windows put in the living room, overlooking the lawn, and then had floor-to-ceiling curtains installed over them, as if he found that he couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to look out the windows he\u2019d bought. Beth never asked him why, because she didn\u2019t like looking out those windows, either. When she peeked behind the curtains during the rain\u2014and it rained much of the time\u2014the water flattened on the glass and made shapes in the wind, reminding her of palms and fingers running down the glass. The lawn beyond was as empty as if all of humanity had vanished, and the dark gray ocean in the distance looked angry. There was something about the view that made it feel like the house was a ship sailing over the edge of the world. In the living room the sofa, low and squat and square, didn\u2019t match the intricately carved fireplace mantel that looked like it was from a century ago. None of the art\u2014modern splashes of paint on canvas that were expensive and were supposed to represent something or other\u2014looked right on the walls. The house was her father\u2019s; the attempt at decorating was her mother\u2019s. Much like her parents\u2019 marriage, none of it went together. And none of it was Beth\u2019s. Her room was girlish, but it was subdued. There were no play areas or places for a little girl to run around in the Greer mansion. Another thing Beth assumed was normal. From her bedroom window upstairs, she could see trees at the edges of the lawn and the roofs of the houses on either side. Upstairs felt less like drowning, and her room was her own. With no one to talk to but her dolls, she had no idea she was lonely, because she had never known anything else. Until the day she saw the footprints. It was an early morning, sometime around Thanksgiving. Beth woke early; maybe she\u2019d heard a sound, unusual in the silent house. The sky was chalky gray, and for once it wasn\u2019t raining. Pulling herself out of bed, Beth went to her bedroom window. The lawn was laced with dew, wet and silver. Marring the dew, a set of footprints crossed the grass. The prints were made by small feet, maybe a little larger than her own. Barefoot. A child not much older than herself had come from the left side of the lawn, approached the plate glass windows. Walked along them, as if looking in. And then, as if frustrated by the curtains, the prints circled back the way they had come and vanished. Beth stared at the footprints in silence. Against the carpet of her bedroom, her bare toes curled. The dew would be cold this time of year, just barely liquid, almost icy frost. It would be numbing on bare feet. There were no children in the neighboring houses on either side. Where had a child come from? She left her room and went downstairs, moving quietly through the silent house. Her father had left last night, but her mother was home. Her mother was an insomniac who regularly slept until eleven o\u2019clock or noon, and the house had no servants. In her pink and white nightgown, her hair down her back, Beth walked through the gloom to the plate glass windows in the living room. She pulled back the edge of the heavy curtains. The footprints were still there in the dew, just outside the glass. And at eye level, as if the child who made the prints had blown hot breath on the glass and written in the fog, were the words: I WAS HERE It took Beth a moment to realize that for the words to be readable, the child outside would have had to write them backward. Which she had done, flawlessly. How she knew the other child was a girl, she couldn\u2019t have said. She just knew. A pulse began to beat in Beth\u2019s neck. The house around her was dark and silent, her mother still asleep. There was no one around, no one to talk to, probably for hours. Just Beth and her dolls. She leaned forward and blew on the glass until a patch of fog came up. Then, writing carefully backward herself, she wrote her own message: COME IN. \n CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN December 1960 BETH Christmas, for the other kids on the school bus, was exciting. It meant presents and sweets and, most importantly, school break. Today was the last day before the Christmas holiday, and they were on their way home. Beth sat alone, looking out the window and listening to the boisterous shouts and laughter of the other children. Though she had a thick wool coat and an expensive pair of shoes, a fine wool scarf wound around her neck and matching mittens, she was cold. The damp chill seeped up from her feet and shivered through her body. Her fingertips were numb. There was no snow outside, but it was still Christmassy. Downtown, the stores were lit up with shopping displays, and the school was decorated with the kids\u2019 drawings. In January, the damp paint-soaked papers would be drooping from the walls, and they\u2019d be sent home with the kids for their parents to put away. Beth would throw hers in the garbage. But today, on the last day of school before Christmas, even the cold chill of the school had felt almost festive. The dark was setting in, clouds covering what little light the sun gave off before it quickly set. The houses in the neighborhood had their Christmas lights up, the red, green, and blue winking as the bus passed by. Beth sat in silence, watching. None of the other kids spoke to her, which was how she liked it. At the beginning of the school year, two of the older girls had bullied her, calling her \u201crich girl\u201d\u2014a stupid insult, since there were no poor children at their school. But the older girls were determined to pick on Beth, and eventually there was a fight, and Beth got a bloody nose. The school called her mother, who took over an hour to come and take Beth home. She had smelled like she did after her \u201cday drinks,\u201d as she called them, and she shouted slurred abuse at the teachers, the principal, and the girls in the yard, calling them profane words. No one bullied Beth after that. No one wanted to be her friend, either. Today there were no Christmas lights on the Greer house, but the windows were lit up, which was a surprise. Often Beth got off the bus to an empty house, which she entered using the key on a chain around her neck. Sometimes one parent or the other was home\u2014rarely both. But it looked like they were both home today, early for them on a Friday afternoon, and even as Beth got off the bus and approached the house, she could tell that something was going on. The thought didn\u2019t give her any feeling of anticipation. She didn\u2019t expect a party or any holiday cheer. There had been something wrong over the past week. Her grandmother had died, and Beth had heard her parents arguing downstairs late into the night, their voices tight and angry. She\u2019d heard her mother crying, and her father saying, Jesus Christ, Mariana, what a goddamned mess you\u2019ve made. Her mother\u2019s teary, furious answer was: I want to see her. Just once. I want to see her. Beth didn\u2019t know what that meant. The housekeepers came once a week and the house was as neat as ever, so there was no mess. And her mother could see Beth anytime she wanted. Looking at the lit-up windows in the lowering dark, she had the feeling she was about to learn what the goddamned mess was. She walked into the front hall on cold, numb feet. In the living room, the lights and the lamps were on. The curtains were closed. Beth unwound her scarf and walked into the room. Her mother was sitting in one of the orange-upholstered chairs, while her father stood by the window, a drink in his hand, his back to the curtains. As Beth walked into the room, neither parent looked at her. In the corner of the room was a Christmas tree, a real one, giving off a cold, pungent pine scent. It had been delivered today, set up by someone hired to do so, and it wasn\u2019t yet decorated. There were no gifts beneath it. The tree sat in shadow, out of place and a little sinister. Sitting on the sofa, the one that matched her mother\u2019s chair, was a girl. She was a year or two older than Beth, perhaps. She had blond hair, long and straight, combed neatly down her back. She wore a navy blue skirt and a blue and white checked blouse, dark knee socks, black oxfords on her feet. Her hands were folded politely in her lap. She looked at Beth and smiled. \u201cHi there,\u201d the girl said. \u201cBeth.\u201d Her mother turned in her chair, smiling, as if she\u2019d just realized Beth was there. The smile was tenuous, mostly sober but not quite. Mariana had put her hair up, and she wore a string of pearls around her neck. Beth had not seen that string of pearls since the last time her mother had tried to go to church, at Easter. She had put them on with her dress and then gone back to bed and fallen asleep when whatever pill she\u2019d taken that morning kicked in. \u201cHi there, honey. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home. This is your cousin Lillian.\u201d Beth stared in shock. She didn\u2019t have a cousin Lillian; she didn\u2019t have any cousins at all. Her father was an only child\u2014hence the large inheritance\u2014and her mother had a sister who was dead. Lillian was Beth\u2019s middle name. But she could see no hint of a lie in her mother\u2019s fragile smile, her father\u2019s blank face. She looked back at the girl. \u201cHello,\u201d she said obediently. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cShe\u2019s come to stay for Christmas.\u201d This was her mother again, her fingertips rubbing the pearls around her neck. \u201cIsn\u2019t that nice? You\u2019ll have a little playmate. Two sweet, matching girls. The two of you can be friends.\u201d By the window, her father made a disgusted sound and took a sip of his drink. \u201cI like dolls,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cDo you like dolls?\u201d Beth looked at her, and for a long moment nothing else existed. Her parents, with all of their terrible grown-up problems and confusing undercurrents, were gone. The half-lit room in this uneasy house was gone. Even the chill in her feet, in her bones, was gone. There was only her and Lillian. \u201cI like dolls,\u201d she said. Lillian slid off the sofa, as if she agreed that the two adults in the room didn\u2019t exist. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s play.\u201d \u2014 \u201cHow old are you?\u201d Beth asked Lillian when they were in her room. Now that they were alone, surrounded by Beth\u2019s actual dolls, the new girl seemed to have lost interest in playing. Instead she looked around Beth\u2019s room, touching the bed and the pillow, looking in her drawers. Beth sat on the edge of the bed, watching in fascination. \u201cEight,\u201d Lillian said. Her blond hair was so perfect it shimmered in the gloomy light. She picked up one of Beth\u2019s books\u2014an old Dick and Jane from when she was learning to read, which suddenly made her feel like a baby\u2014and flipped through the pages. \u201cAre all of these things yours?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhy are you here by yourself?\u201d Lillian put the book back and picked up a teddy bear, turning it over, pressing her fingers into its neck as if she thought something might be inside. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any friends?\u201d Beth blinked. She watched Lillian\u2019s pale, elegant hands pressing into her teddy bear\u2019s fur. She couldn\u2019t even be offended at the intrusion; she felt, as Lillian obviously did, like Lillian had a right to be here. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have any friends.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cI got beat up at school by bigger girls, and my mother came.\u201d She didn\u2019t explain the rest of the story, and it seemed that she didn\u2019t need to. Lillian nodded as if she knew what the rest of the story was already. \u201cThat\u2019s because you didn\u2019t take care of it yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cHow?\u201d Beth asked. \u201cYou make them afraid of you.\u201d Lillian squeezed the teddy bear\u2019s neck briefly, then put it down. \u201cThen they won\u2019t pick on you anymore. It\u2019s easy. I\u2019ll show you how.\u201d \u201cNo one is afraid of me,\u201d Beth said. \u201cThey will be.\u201d Lillian picked up Beth\u2019s most precious ornament, a jewelry box with a ballerina on the top. \u201cI\u2019m going to help you,\u201d she said matter-of-factly, looking closely at the ballerina. \u201cYou\u2019re very lucky.\u201d Beth swallowed. She had the sudden feeling that Lillian was going to throw the jewelry box to the floor, smash it just because she could. She could almost picture it, the shards of pretty china, the broken ballerina skidding in pieces beneath the bed. She thought it might have something to do with the lesson of making people afraid. But still she didn\u2019t stand up and grab the box away. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d Beth asked. \u201cNowhere,\u201d Lillian said, still holding the box. \u201cI live with some people who don\u2019t care about me. I don\u2019t live in a nice house like this.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound happy about it. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Lillian looked at her. Her eyes, Beth noticed, were gray-green, her lashes dark. \u201cI wanted to come here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here before.\u201d And suddenly Beth remembered. The footprints in the dew, the words on the window: I WAS HERE. She hadn\u2019t seen the girl who\u2019d made those words, but suddenly she was sure. \u201cThat was you?\u201d she asked, her voice a whisper. Lillian frowned, for the first time looking a little uncertain. \u201cI knew about this house,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to come here. And one night, I thought about it as I went to sleep, and . . . I think I dreamed it.\u201d Beth was excited now. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw you. Your footprints.\u201d \u201cMy feet were so cold,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a way in. I couldn\u2019t see in the windows. I had to give up and go back to the trees. And then I saw you.\u201d She looked at Beth. \u201cSometimes I imagine things that aren\u2019t real. But you saw me that night, and I saw you. You told me to come in.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAnd here I am. Now we can be sisters.\u201d Beth\u2019s heart was pumping hard in her chest. This was wonderful and terrible at the same time. It was going to be a nightmare, and it was also going to be the best thing that ever happened to her. She knew that already. Her life was starting. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked the strange girl. \u201cI\u2019m Lillian,\u201d the girl replied. \u201cThat\u2019s your name, too, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my middle name,\u201d Beth said. She was Elizabeth Lillian Greer. \u201cLike you were named after me,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cI think that\u2019s nice, but no one ever calls me Lillian. Everyone calls me Lily.\u201d \n CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT December 1960 BETH That first year, when Lily came to stay, there was no real Christmas. Beth\u2019s parents usually made an attempt at the holidays, with a lot of spiked eggnog, a few expensive presents for Beth, and a meal cooked on the twenty-fourth by the housekeeping staff and eaten the next day. It wasn\u2019t fun, but it was something. But that year, the tree sat in its shadowy corner, pungent and undecorated. No presents ever appeared. The girls played in Beth\u2019s room while Beth\u2019s parents had some kind of awful fight downstairs, carried out in angry, snarled tones. Sometime in the middle of the night two days before Christmas, her father left the house, the door slamming behind him. Lying in her bed, squeezed next to Lily, Beth listened to his car start up and drive away. In the silent dark, Lily spoke. \u201cWe don\u2019t need him,\u201d she said. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d The next morning, Beth\u2019s mother found them in the kitchen. Her hair was done, and she had makeup on, though her eyes were red. She was wearing a red sweater and a plaid skirt that fell below the knee, as if she thought she might go to a Christmas party. \u201cI\u2019m going shopping,\u201d she said, her voice dull. She put on her coat, picked up her purse, and left the house. She was gone for three days. No one had told the housekeeping staff to cook a Christmas meal, so there wasn\u2019t one. The girls were left alone in the house as the wet snow fell outside and melted on the cold grass. The first day, they raided the kitchen, eating cookies and drinking chocolate milk. They watched TV until late and went to bed after midnight. Beth jumped at every sound, expecting one or both of her parents back any minute to shout at them for being bad, but they never came. On Christmas morning, the girls ate more chocolate and played dolls and dress-up. They raced each other around the yard, churning up the wet snow as the ocean roared at the bottom of the cliff. Beth thought of the other kids from school, and she knew that she wasn\u2019t having the right kind of Christmas, a normal kind of Christmas. She didn\u2019t unwrap gifts or leave cookies for Santa. She didn\u2019t have turkey. It felt sad, but then she and Lily popped popcorn six times, smothering it with butter and eating it all day until they went to bed. I should miss them, she thought as she and Lily jumped from the coffee table with their arms outstretched, seeing which one of them could touch the ceiling first. And she did miss her parents, a little. But she didn\u2019t miss the watchfulness, the waiting for the moment when her parents started politely snapping at each other, forgetting that she was in the room. She didn\u2019t miss having to tiptoe everywhere, remembering never to touch anything or ask for anything or make any noise, because she was supposed to be seen and not heard. She didn\u2019t miss lying alone in bed in this strange house, wondering why she was so afraid of it, of beams and roofs and windows, as if she and the house hated each other. \u201cYou\u2019re not really my cousin, are you?\u201d Beth asked that night as they wound the bedcovers around themselves and ate the last of the candy they\u2019d found in the pantry. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d Lily\u2019s profile was perfect as she snapped off a small bite of chocolate. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a cousin.\u201d \u201cThen who are your parents?\u201d \u201cI live with foster parents,\u201d Lily said. \u201cThis is the second family I\u2019ve lived with. I\u2019ll probably live with a different one next year.\u201d Beth had never imagined meeting a real-life orphan instead of reading about them in books. \u201cWhere are your real parents?\u201d she asked. Lily thought this over. \u201cMy mother is alive,\u201d she said. \u201cMy father, I don\u2019t know. Maybe he\u2019s dead. If he isn\u2019t, I plan to find him someday.\u201d \u201cWhat about your mother? Do you plan to find her?\u201d Lily thought about this again. \u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t want me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut maybe she has no choice.\u201d The next day, they ran out of cookies, so they tried baking cookies themselves from a recipe book that was stacked under the sink, the pages stuck together with disuse. Beth singed a finger when she opened the hot oven, so the girls turned the oven off and ate the uncooked batter instead. There was a brief fight that day, when Lily took a doll Beth wanted to play with. Lily won. Beth\u2019s mother came home, still wearing the red sweater and the plaid skirt. Her hair had been taken down and put up again, and her mascara had dribbled into raccoon bruises beneath her eyes. She looked around the mess of the house, at the two girls sitting on the living room sofa, surrounded by blankets they\u2019d pulled off the bed. \u201cHow sweet,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks like you two had fun. I\u2019m sorry . . . I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t home for Christmas.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Beth said. Her mother had been so sad ever since Beth\u2019s grandmother died. She\u2019d probably just gone off to be sad somewhere, Beth decided, since Lily was here to keep her company. It wouldn\u2019t be much of a Christmas if your mother had just died. Beth had explained this to Lily, who had given her a blank look. Beth had to remember that Lily didn\u2019t understand anything about mothers. Her mother looked past Beth at Lily and said her name, the word seeming to twist in her throat. \u201cLillian . . .\u201d \u201cYes, Mrs. Greer?\u201d Lillian asked sweetly. Mariana just looked at her. Beth noticed that Lily and her mother had the same color hair, the same pretty blond. \u201cNothing,\u201d Mariana said after a moment. \u201cYou two sweet girls have fun.\u201d She went upstairs, and Beth heard her parents\u2019 bedroom door click shut. Beth\u2019s father came home the next day, ragged, tired. He looked at Beth and said, \u201cHousekeeping will be here in an hour. Have them clean up this mess.\u201d Then he turned to Lily. \u201cPack your bags. You\u2019re going home.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Beth cried. \u201cShut up,\u201d her father said, and even though he wasn\u2019t a very warm father, even though he expected her to be neat and quiet and never play, he\u2019d never said those words to her before. He turned to Lily again and said, \u201cYou have five minutes. I\u2019ll have a taxi at the door to take you to wherever you\u2019re going.\u201d Lily looked up at him with wide, sweet eyes. \u201cYes, Mr. Greer,\u201d she said. Beth followed Lily upstairs to pack. She felt like crying, but Lily was unperturbed. She didn\u2019t even seem concerned that she was being sent out into the world, into a taxi, alone, at age eight. Beth didn\u2019t want to cry in front of her, didn\u2019t want to seem like a baby. \u201cWill you come back?\u201d she asked as Lily slung her single cloth bag, filled with only a few clothes and a toothbrush, over her shoulder. \u201cYes,\u201d Lily said. \u201cThey can\u2019t keep me from this house. No one can.\u201d \u2014 Over dinner one night a week later, Beth asked her mother and father who Lily\u2019s parents were. Mariana glanced at Julian, then looked back at Beth. \u201cI\u2019m glad you two are such good friends,\u201d she said, touching Beth\u2019s hair. \u201cAnd Lily doesn\u2019t have parents. Isn\u2019t that sad?\u201d \u201cEveryone has parents,\u201d Beth said. \u201cKids don\u2019t come from storks. I know that now.\u201d \u201cWell, no, she didn\u2019t come from a stork,\u201d Mariana said, picking up her fork and studying the silver tines. \u201cGoodness. I don\u2019t know who you\u2019ve been talking to about babies. I\u2019ll have to call the school and ask what they\u2019re teaching these days. I meant that Lillian\u2019s parents are dead.\u201d \u201cBut who are they?\u201d Beth said. \u201cDid you know them? Is that why she came to visit?\u201d Mariana looked uncertain. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew them. Lillian\u2019s mother was a friend of mine, but she\u2019s dead now, and I feel bad for that little girl. She\u2019s practically your cousin. Okay?\u201d At the other side of the table, Beth\u2019s father put his fork down and pushed his chair back. He walked out of the dining room without a word. Beth knew her mother was lying to her, because Lily had said that her mother wasn\u2019t dead at all. Her father knew she was lying, too. But Mariana pretended that nothing was wrong, even though everything was wrong, just like she always did. \u201cHe\u2019s just angry,\u201d she said of Julian, smiling and touching Beth\u2019s hair again. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like little girls the way I do.\u201d \n CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE December 1961 BETH Lily was as good as her word. She came back to the Greer mansion the next Christmas. And the next. At first, every year for months and months, life went on as usual and Lily wasn\u2019t mentioned. Then, as the darkness of winter set in, Mariana\u2019s mood would begin to spiral down and she\u2019d drink more. There would be more day drinks, which would start earlier and earlier, more arguments that Beth could hear as she lay in bed at night, because her parents thought that if they argued after she went to bed, she wouldn\u2019t hear them. As if they could fool her into thinking they had a happy family if they only argued after she was supposedly asleep. Then, like clockwork, Mariana would get excited about Christmas. She\u2019d decide that Christmas was going to be wonderful this year and it was going to solve all of her problems. She\u2019d go shopping and buy stacks of decorations that she never put up. She\u2019d go looking for the biggest, most expensive Christmas tree. And she\u2019d invite Lily to visit. If Lily\u2019s foster family had any objections\u2014which was unlikely\u2014their objections would vanish at Mariana\u2019s influence and her money. Mostly her money. Lily always came, sleek and beautiful as a cat, her blond hair brushed soft and shining. She\u2019d be polite and talk about how grateful she was, but as she spoke she\u2019d lock eyes with Julian, and the two of them would stare each other down. Then Julian would pack a bag, say he was going to visit friends, and he\u2019d leave the house. Beth learned early that Lily and Julian hated each other. She had to learn it. The undercurrents in the house at Christmas were too deep, too important, and she needed both Julian and Lily for survival. She couldn\u2019t afford to lose either one, so she made strategies to appease both of them. She didn\u2019t talk about Lily in Julian\u2019s presence, because if she did he\u2019d simply get up and leave the room. She made one attempt to win Lily over to Julian\u2019s side by telling her that her father was actually very nice, that once you got to know him he was kind. Lily only looked at Beth with dead, flat eyes. \u201cYour father would let me die in the street like a stray dog,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he can\u2019t, so that\u2019s too bad for him.\u201d Beth didn\u2019t talk to her about Julian after that. Some Christmases, Mariana left the house after her husband did, and the two girls played alone. A TV was installed in the living room one year, and that Christmas, Beth and Lily watched My Three Sons and Bonanza and Bewitched. There were cartwheel competitions on the back lawn, but Lily always got closer to the edge of the drop than Beth did. No matter how close Beth got\u2014it was part of the competition\u2014Lily always got so close it was scary, her sneakers sliding almost over the precipice when she landed. Every competition they had went the same way, with Lily pushing and Beth sick with fear, until Beth learned, over and over, not to let the fear bother her. Other years, Mariana stayed home at Christmas. She tried playing board games and baking cookies with them, things she never did when Beth was here alone. She pretended that Christmas was cheerful and that everything was fun. She read them stories, most of which were for little girls, younger than Beth and Lily, but they listened anyway. She played made-up games with them. \u201cOnce upon a time, there were two little girls,\u201d she\u2019d say. \u201cThey were kidnapped by an evil witch who wanted to eat them, but one of them was bitter and one of them was sweet. Which girl is which, do you think?\u201d Beth always wanted to be the sweet girl, of course. But no matter how sweet she was, Mariana never played these games when Lily wasn\u2019t here. Besides, even though Mariana never told the end of the story, Beth knew the sweet girl was the one who got eaten. The bitter girl was the one who survived. \u2014 Lily was Beth\u2019s best friend. Her only friend, really. Beth didn\u2019t need anyone else, because Lily knew everything. Lily knew what sex was before Beth did; she knew what death was; she knew which adults were stupid and which were even remotely worth listening to. She knew how to handle the other kids at school. She taught Beth when to fight, when to suck up, and when to flirt, even with other girls. \u201cShe\u2019s easy,\u201d Lily said when Beth described one particular classmate. \u201cPretend you like her, and you\u2019ll get what you want.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like her,\u201d Beth said. \u201cFor thirty seconds, you do. Smile at her like you would a boy.\u201d Lily snapped her fingers. \u201cNow she\u2019ll do what you say.\u201d It worked. Everything Lily told Beth to do worked. When Beth was ten, a group of boys in her class noticed her. Beth was tall by then, with long red hair and wide eyes. The boys would corner her in the playground, pinch her and poke her, call her names. Try to push her down. \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re pretty,\u201d Lily, who was twelve, said when Beth complained about this problem. \u201cGet used to it.\u201d \u201cI hate being a girl,\u201d Beth said, throwing her favorite doll across her bedroom. She\u2019d boxed up most of her dolls the year before but had kept this one out because she loved it so much. Now she\u2019d get rid of it. \u201cI hate it. Being a girl is awful.\u201d Lily only looked at her with that flat, dead expression she sometimes had in her eyes, as if she felt absolutely nothing\u2014good, bad, nothing at all. \u201cBeing a girl is the best,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause no one ever believes you\u2019d do something bad. People think you\u2019ll do nothing, which means you can do anything. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d That night, they snuck out at midnight and went to the school, their boots crunching in the snow. With Beth\u2019s hopscotch chalk, they wrote bad words on the wall of the school\u2014words that Beth knew in theory but had never said aloud. They wrote them in blocky letters that didn\u2019t look like loopy, girlish letters. When Beth got back to school after the break, she found that the boys had been questioned about the swear words, and two of them had gotten in trouble for it. No one ever asked questions of the girls. Beth felt a little bit bad about that. But she knew what Lily would say: that the boys shouldn\u2019t have bullied her in the first place. And really, Lily was right. Beth was a fast learner. \u2014 The Christmas Beth was twelve and Lily was fourteen, Mariana stayed home. They played Snakes and Ladders, which the girls were too old for, and Mariana drank through the entire game. By the end, she was slurring her words, tilted over on the sofa, drunk. The girls helped her upstairs to her bed, where she promptly fell asleep. In the dim light of the bedroom, as half-frozen rain pelted the window, Lily looked down at Mariana, sprawled on the pillow. Beth watched Lily\u2019s face, her eyes, as Lily watched the woman on the bed. Beth stared at the shape of Lily\u2019s nose and chin, which were so like Mariana\u2019s. She had always known, deep down. Even when she didn\u2019t understand how babies were made, when she didn\u2019t understand anything about her own mother or her parents\u2019 angry and complicated relationship, she had known. She still didn\u2019t understand everything, but she\u2019d guessed enough. \u201cYour parents aren\u2019t dead, are they?\u201d she asked Lily, her voice soft, so as not to wake Mariana. \u201cNo,\u201d Lily said, still looking down. \u201cThey\u2019re not. That\u2019s just a lie your mother told you.\u201d \u201cOur mother.\u201d The words hung there, meaning everything, changing everything. Beth\u2019s feelings were enormous, too big for her to contain: excitement, dread, guilt, shame. But when Lily looked up at her, she saw no answering emotions in Lily\u2019s eyes. She simply looked blank again. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want you to know,\u201d Lily said. \u201cShe brings me here every Christmas because she feels bad for abandoning me. It\u2019s always too much for her. Then she does it all over again.\u201d Beth made the words come out, the ones that were harder to say. \u201cAnd my father?\u201d \u201cHe isn\u2019t my father,\u201d Lily said bluntly. \u201cI don\u2019t know who my father is. I don\u2019t know where he is. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s dead. I don\u2019t know what happened between them or why. I plan to find out.\u201d \u201cMaybe she\u2019ll tell us someday,\u201d Beth said. But they both looked down at the sleeping woman, her sprayed hair stiff on the pillow, and they knew it wouldn\u2019t happen. Whatever had occurred was so deep inside Mariana that maybe she\u2019d made herself forget it was there. \u201cShe isn\u2019t his,\u201d Lily said, talking about Julian and Mariana. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d No, she\u2019s mine, Beth thought. I\u2019m the real daughter, the one she had after she was married, the good girl. The sweet one. But she already knew she had lost that battle. There was no question about Mariana belonging to Beth. She belonged to the bitter girl, the one who wouldn\u2019t be eaten. \u201cSo what do we do?\u201d she asked Lily\u2014who was her half sister, and not her cousin or a distant family friend, which was how Mariana referred to her whenever she spoke about her to other adults. If any of the other adults suspected the truth, they were too polite to say anything. \u201cDo we just keep pretending we don\u2019t know?\u201d Lily reached out and traced a finger down the side of Mariana\u2019s face. Beth fought off the instinct to punch her hand away, to prevent Lily from ever touching her mother. \u201cFor now,\u201d she said, answering Beth\u2019s question. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, really. I\u2019m going to get what I want. Everything I want.\u201d \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Was it to live here? To be a real daughter? Beth didn\u2019t know if that was possible, or if Lily even would. Living here would mean living with Julian. \u201cI want lots of things,\u201d Lily said. She looked around. \u201cThis house, for one.\u201d Beth had no idea how fourteen-year-old Lily would get this house, but she said, \u201cI hate this house.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t understand it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s ugly.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an abomination that shouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d Lily said, \u201cand it knows it. That\u2019s why I like it. It\u2019s exactly like me.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t own a house,\u201d Beth said, tentative because she didn\u2019t want Lily to get angry. \u201cYou\u2019re too young.\u201d \u201cNot for long.\u201d Lily looked at Beth, really looked at her for the first time in a long time. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I want you to get away from my mother, she thought. I want you to leave and never come back. But, no, she didn\u2019t mean that. Beth was just afraid. She\u2019d be lonely and desolate if she didn\u2019t have Lily. She needed Lily. Just like she needed Julian and Mariana. Beth had to get through another day, and another year, and she needed all three of them to get there. But she needed Lily most of all. So she said the one thing she knew would work, the one thing that Lily was susceptible to. The one thing that would keep Lily on her side. \u201cI want to be like you,\u201d she said. There was a moment when she wasn\u2019t quite sure Lily believed it. And then her sister smiled. \n CHAPTER THIRTY December 1968 BETH The Christmas Beth was fourteen, Lily came to the Greer house with a bruise on her temple and faded yellowy green marks under the skin of her cheekbone. Mariana pretended not to notice, but later that night both of the girls could hear her sobbing in her bedroom as Julian told her to stop, please stop. It\u2019s my fault, Mariana said. All my fault. Lily didn\u2019t want to talk about it, but Beth knew that something had happened at her foster home. Lily wasn\u2019t above faking bruises to get sympathy, but she wasn\u2019t faking this. That year, she was quieter than usual and her eyes were hollow, her mouth set tight. Surprisingly, Julian stayed home that year, the first Christmas he\u2019d done so since Lily had first visited. Something about seeing Lily bruised and angry must have made him feel more comfortable having her around, as if she\u2019d lost a round in their endless contest. They avoided each other and barely spoke, but Beth saw Lily\u2019s gaze follow Julian whenever she saw him, and she didn\u2019t like the look in Lily\u2019s eyes. That was the year David disappeared. David was a groundskeeper. In the summer, there was a small crew of men who came to maintain the lawns and the gardens, but in the winter there was only David. He came at the end of every month and spent a few hours cutting out dead annuals, removing any snow and ice on the ground, and raking old leaves. He was supposed to come the day after Christmas, but he never showed. As days passed, it became clear that he was gone, and no one knew what had happened to him. Maybe he had suddenly left town. He was just a groundskeeper, though, so it was considered a minor mystery, shrugged off by Julian and Mariana and never spoken of again. Lily went home on the twenty-eighth, and for once Beth was glad to see her go, glad to be free of the flat look in Lily\u2019s eyes. They didn\u2019t find David until late April, his broken body on the rocks below the cliff. They couldn\u2019t pinpoint how long he\u2019d been there, but it had been months. It was declared a suicide, but Beth had an uneasy feeling in her stomach. Lily . . . But she had never seen Lily anywhere near David, never seen her look at him or talk to him. So, no, it wasn\u2019t possible. What would be the reason? There wasn\u2019t one. Beth put her suspicions away and didn\u2019t think about them anymore. The next year, Lily\u2019s bruises were gone and she was thinner, her cheekbones sharper, her hipbones as hard as diamonds. She was seventeen, a year from aging out of the foster system. \u201cMy new family barely pays any attention to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey let me do whatever I want.\u201d \u201cWhat happened to your old family?\u201d Beth asked. \u201cBad things,\u201d Lily said, and for the first time in months, Beth thought of David again. \u201cWhat bad things?\u201d she asked as fear curled into the pit of her stomach. Lily only shook her head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. People do bad things to themselves. It\u2019s their own fault. Let\u2019s go do a cartwheel race on the lawn.\u201d They hadn\u2019t done cartwheel races for a few years, and Beth didn\u2019t really want to go near the edge of the drop right now, when she was thinking of David down there, his bones broken. But she went, and she cartwheeled close to the edge, the cold air and the excitement making her breath come short. After a while, she forgot about David again. That night, the half sisters sat in Beth\u2019s new room\u2014she\u2019d graduated a few years ago from her little-girl room to a teenager\u2019s room down the hall, though the little-girl room was still intact\u2014and listened to records on Beth\u2019s record player. Lily sat cross-legged on Beth\u2019s newer, bigger bed, her legs slim and flawless in her tight jeans, her breasts obvious beneath the fabric of her striped turtleneck, making the black and blue stripes bend into wonky shapes. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you,\u201d she said. Beth looked up from the Neil Diamond record she was putting on the player\u2014Lily said she had atrocious taste in music, but Beth disagreed\u2014and saw that Lily was holding her hand out, and there was a small white pill in her palm. \u201cTake it,\u201d she said. Beth looked at it warily. She and Lily regularly stole from Julian and Mariana\u2019s well-stocked liquor cabinet, and had for years, but Beth had no experience with pills. \u201cWhat does it do?\u201d \u201cIt makes you high, silly,\u201d Lily said. \u201cLike really high. It\u2019s better than anything else I\u2019ve tried.\u201d Beth didn\u2019t want to get high. She wanted to play records and get drunk when her parents weren\u2019t guarding the liquor cabinet. Being high with Lily sounded like something that wasn\u2019t terribly fun. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Lily\u2019s gaze went darker, flatter. \u201cTake it.\u201d Saying no to Lily was always a tricky proposition. You had to do it the right way. \u201cIt would probably destroy me,\u201d Beth said. \u201cObliterate me completely. You know what a lightweight I am.\u201d Lily laughed\u2014she was susceptible to compliments, but you had to use the right tone so she didn\u2019t suspect you were lying. \u201cYou are,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019d probably be halfway to California before you came down.\u201d She put the pill away, and Beth breathed a silent sigh of relief. She didn\u2019t think Lily should be taking the pills, either, whatever they were. But she wasn\u2019t going to start nagging her half sister. That would be pushing things too far. With Lily, it was all about balance. A few hours later, they took Beth\u2019s bicycle out of the garage in the middle of the night. They went to a neighbor\u2019s house, where the girl who lived there had just left for college, and broke into the unlocked garage. Lily took the absent girl\u2019s bicycle, and they went for a ride, pumping up the hills and coasting down in the wet, freezing-cold neighborhood, flying by the dark houses while the rich people inside slept. Each girl had brought a bottle of wine\u2014Lily red, Beth white. \u201cWhich girl is bitter, and which girl is sweet?\u201d Lily said, mimicking Mariana\u2019s old game when she saw the wine Beth had picked. \u201cLittle girls can\u2019t be both, you know. They have to be one or the other.\u201d \u201cWe also have to be eaten, apparently,\u201d Beth said. \u201cIt\u2019s all we\u2019re good for.\u201d The wind was cold on Beth\u2019s cheeks as they rode, cold enough to hurt and make her eyes water, but she loved it. She loved that the drizzle soaked her wool hat and the ends of her hair, and that her fingers went numb on the handlebars right through her mittens. In those hours in the middle of the night at Christmas, the girls had the world to themselves. They could be anything, do anything, and there was no one to stop them. \u201cWhat do you want to be?\u201d Lily asked her when they paused, leaning their bikes on a wet park bench so they could take swigs of wine. \u201cAn actress? A singer? What?\u201d Beth shrugged. Her future was a blank. She was pretty enough, but she had no particular talent in one thing or another. She couldn\u2019t sing or dance or write. Hollywood had exploded with movies like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Easy Rider, but those movies were about men. She\u2019d read a copy of On the Road that she\u2019d swiped from the library, looking for the glamour and forbidden excitement, but all she could see in it was a bunch of boys driving around, showing up at their girlfriends\u2019 when they needed a place to stay. Beth didn\u2019t want to be a girlfriend who took in a broke boy and fed him, gave him money, and had sex with him before he went off to other adventures and other women. That didn\u2019t sound like freedom, like free love. It sounded like a bore. \u201cYou need to be something,\u201d Lily said. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause otherwise your parents are going to marry you off by the time you\u2019re nineteen, and you\u2019ll have a baby by twenty. And that will be it.\u201d She gave Beth a flat stare. \u201cThen again, maybe that\u2019s what you want.\u201d That made Beth briefly furious, a flash of anger that made her see red. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t end up like our mother. And I won\u2019t get pregnant like she did, either.\u201d \u201cYes, you will. You\u2019ll even get a husband, a man who makes a lot of money and will take your virginity for you, though I guarantee you won\u2019t enjoy it. It won\u2019t be any fun at all.\u201d There were no words to describe how terrifying that thought was, how it made a black hole of panic open up in the pit of her stomach. She had so many feelings for Mariana\u2014love, desperation, disdain, anger\u2014but she did not want to end up like her. Repeating Mariana\u2019s life was the worst thing that could happen. But Lily wasn\u2019t completely wrong. Beth took a long swig of wine, hoping it would dampen the terror. \u201cWe need to talk about money,\u201d Lily said. Beth frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cMoney,\u201d Lily said again. She took a sip of her wine, but she didn\u2019t seem drunk, while Beth felt her head start to spin. \u201cI\u2019ll be eighteen soon, and I\u2019ll be out of the foster system. How much money will Mariana give me, do you think?\u201d Beth wasn\u2019t following. \u201cMariana is going to give you money?\u201d \u201cOf course she is,\u201d Beth said. \u201cShe has to. She feels bad about me, remember? I\u2019ll have to figure out how much I\u2019ll need. She has plenty.\u201d \u201cMariana doesn\u2019t have money,\u201d Beth said. \u201cSure, she does. She goes shopping all the time and her wallet is always full of cash.\u201d That was true. They\u2019d seen the money come out of the wallet plenty of times. \u201cThat\u2019s my father\u2019s money,\u201d Beth said. \u201cHe gives her an allowance.\u201d For the first time in a long time, Lily actually looked surprised, and the surprise wasn\u2019t pleasant. \u201cBeth, what are you talking about? Mariana\u2019s family is just as rich as Julian\u2019s.\u201d Beth took another drink of wine. \u201cThat\u2019s true, but Mariana is the only one left. And her mother left all of her money to Julian.\u201d \u201cTo Julian?\u201d Beth nodded. \u201cI heard them talking about it. Our grandmother thought it was best that her husband look after all of it because our mother doesn\u2019t know how to handle money. So he got all the money, and he gives Mariana an allowance.\u201d She had never really thought about this before; her parents had never argued about it, both of them accepting it as the natural order of things. But she could tell by Lily\u2019s face that something was wrong. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lily looked off into the darkness, her breath pluming, her skin pale against the night. \u201cDamn it,\u201d she said softly to herself. \u201cI\u2019d laugh if it wasn\u2019t so fucking tragic.\u201d Beth felt her jaw drop at the word. Lily had no problem swearing, but even she rarely used the f-word. \u201cLily?\u201d \u201cGod damn it,\u201d Lily said. Beth was starting to get scared\u2014drunk and scared\u2014so she said, \u201cCan we talk about something else now?\u201d Lily\u2019s eyes had that cold look that made Beth want to get back on her bike and flee. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t want to talk about money,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have all the money. From Julian, from Mariana. I bet you have a trust fund, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cNot until I\u2019m twenty-one,\u201d Beth said. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t a lot. I still have to get an allowance from my father.\u201d \u201cAn allowance,\u201d Lily said. She took a step toward Beth, pulled a glove off. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get an allowance and marry a rich man, and someday when Julian is dead you\u2019ll get that, too. And me? I\u2019ll just disappear.\u201d Beth watched Lily\u2019s bare hand. Something about it disturbed her. She was so drunk, and she knew now that she shouldn\u2019t have talked about this, shouldn\u2019t have told Lily those things, but she couldn\u2019t say why. \u201cYou won\u2019t disappear,\u201d Beth argued. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay here. You\u2019ll have Mariana and me.\u201d \u201cWill you let me visit at Christmas?\u201d Lily asked. Her hand touched Beth\u2019s hair where it came out from beneath her wool hat, stroked down the silky red strands. \u201cWill I be allowed to sit on a chair in the living room if I stay quiet and wear my best dress?\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d She didn\u2019t like Lily touching her hair. Lily wasn\u2019t a toucher; she didn\u2019t like to be hugged, held, or even to hold hands. She found the touch of other people repugnant, but now she was running her fingertips down Beth\u2019s hair. \u201cDo you know what I think?\u201d Lily said. \u201cI think you\u2019ll marry some rich, boring man and decide you feel guilty about me. And you\u2019ll invite me over for Christmas, and when I get there you won\u2019t be able to think of a single thing to say.\u201d Tears stung Beth\u2019s eyes, because that hurt. \u201cYou know that isn\u2019t true. I don\u2019t want to marry anyone.\u201d \u201cYou will, though, and I\u2019ll be no one. I\u2019ll take more pills, and then I\u2019ll take the wrong pill and I won\u2019t be able to stop, and one day I\u2019ll take enough of them that I\u2019ll never wake up again. Because no one is coming to save us, Beth. We aren\u2019t little girls anymore, and it\u2019s time to face the fact that no one is coming to figure things out for us and make them better. We have to decide for ourselves or disappear into nothingness. Sometimes I think the only way to be someone is to do something bad.\u201d Her fingers were still touching Beth\u2019s hair. Beth\u2019s hands were numb inside her gloves, and she didn\u2019t want the wine anymore. In this moment\u2014despite the absurdity of it, despite the fact that there was no evidence and no reason\u2014she could see Lily pushing David off that edge. In this mood, Lily was capable of anything. When she\u2019d been home last year, when David disappeared, Lily had been seething with anger. And this year was worse. \u201cLily, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d \u201cWomen don\u2019t even get to do that, do we?\u201d Lily said. \u201cThe really bad things. We get to be the girlfriend.\u201d Her voice rose, shrill. \u201c \u2018Oh, he seemed so nice. He seemed so charming. I never believed he could hurt anyone.\u2019 Why don\u2019t you ever hear of a woman in a clock tower?\u201d Beth was confused now. \u201cWhy would you want to go into a clock tower?\u201d The fingers stopped their stroking, and Lily put her hand back into her glove. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d have no reason. Why don\u2019t we go home now? I think you\u2019re tired.\u201d Beth was tired. And after Lily was gone yet again, that entire night, that strange conversation, seemed like a dream. Lily was a teenage girl, not a\u2014whatever Beth had thought she was. It was ridiculous, really. No one would believe a pretty blond teenage girl was capable of truly bad things. No one would believe that at all. \n CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE December 1970 BETH The Christmas Beth was sixteen, Lily didn\u2019t visit. Mariana said that Lily was \u201cbusy,\u201d but Beth knew the truth: Lily wasn\u2019t invited. This year, Julian and Mariana took Beth to a Christmas party instead. Mariana bought Beth a dress to wear. It was high-necked, sleeveless, dark green, belted at the waist, the hem falling to the floor. When Beth put it on, she looked like what she was: the daughter of Claire Lake\u2019s richest and most prestigious couple, a debutante with all the money in the world. She felt like a fraud, and she snuck a bottle of schnapps from her father\u2019s liquor cabinet and drank as much of it as she could before they left for the party. She was worried sick about Lily. Lily had turned eighteen\u2014a legal adult who didn\u2019t live with foster parents anymore. Had she moved out already? Where was she living? Beth would sneak Lily money if she knew where she was, how to reach her. But in the periods between Christmases, the girls had never had any contact. Part of this was Julian\u2019s rule, because he hated Lily and didn\u2019t want Beth to talk to her. But part of it was Lily herself. \u201cYou don\u2019t want anything to do with those people,\u201d she\u2019d say about whatever foster family she was living with. \u201cI don\u2019t want them talking to you on the phone or reading my letters. It\u2019s better for me that way.\u201d Beth had respected that, even though she longed to talk to Lily sometimes. But now Lily was gone, and no one knew where. She hadn\u2019t even left a forwarding address. It hurt. Julian drove to the party. He was wearing a tuxedo, his longish hair neatly combed, his face freshly shaved. Beth\u2019s father was handsome, but the creases around his eyes and the soft sag beginning in his jaw hinted at the truth: Life wasn\u2019t always easy on him. He spent more and more time at work, or golfing in summer, or \u201cmeeting with clients.\u201d Beth was old enough to wonder now if he had a girlfriend, or more than one. She was old enough to wonder where he went when he\u2019d \u201cvisited friends\u201d every Christmas of her childhood. She was old enough to wonder where her mother went, too, since she had no family to stay with, only \u201cbridge friends,\u201d who didn\u2019t seem very friendly. She was also old enough to know that neither of them would ever tell her. Silence was a great talent of the Greer family. Mariana had ironed her blond hair smooth and sprayed it into a perfect formation, rising from her hairline and sweeping back and down to her shoulders. Her dress was gold lam\u00e9; her coat, mink. Her eyes were made up so heavily she looked like she was in disguise, though the effect was also strangely sexual. Her elegant, narrow hands fidgeted in her lap, grasping for a cigarette as she stared silently out the passenger window. Beth wished, for the first time, that she had one of Lily\u2019s little white pills. Maybe that would make her forget whatever was about to happen tonight. \u201cRemember your manners,\u201d Mariana said into the silence of the car, as if a conversation had just been happening. \u201cThese are people from your father\u2019s company. You have our reputation to maintain.\u201d At the wheel, Julian snorted. Beth agreed with him. She couldn\u2019t imagine what kind of reputation Mariana thought they had. \u201cJust be nice,\u201d Mariana said, her voice thin with exasperation, like she was on the edge of tears. \u201cBe nice. For once. That\u2019s all I ask.\u201d In the back seat, Beth stared out the window, unable to look at her mother anymore. She\u2019d skipped school for two weeks before the school finally called her mother and reported it. She hadn\u2019t had any reason to do it, except that school was boring and she was curious how long it would take for the school to get up its courage and call home. The result was predictable: Mariana showed up at the school, wearing her mink at eleven o\u2019clock in the morning, demanding answers about where her daughter was. Claire Lake didn\u2019t have any private high schools, so Beth went to the public school, which made the scene even more exciting. Beth knew that she should probably be embarrassed, but instead she\u2019d felt a detached curiosity, because the whole thing was theater. No one, including Mariana, actually cared where Beth was. The school cared about pleasing the wealthiest family in town, and Mariana cared that Beth wasn\u2019t nice. It was all a drama, like on TV. Lily was the only one who really cared about Beth, about whether Beth was happy, about whether she would get what she wanted. And now Lily wasn\u2019t coming. Most likely, now that she was an adult and not a helpless little girl, she would never be invited over again. Beth wondered where Lily was right now. The party was at another house in Arlen Heights, this one a large old-fashioned mansion with a circular drive. The house was lit from every window, and Beth could hear classical music as they pulled up. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d Mariana said as they got out of the car, an automatic compliment. Julian snorted and said nothing. Beth agreed with her father again. \u201cTom Fenegan will be here,\u201d Julian said. \u201cI need to talk to him about a few things. I expect we\u2019ll spend part of the night in the study.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d Mariana said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Helen in a long time. We\u2019ll need to catch up.\u201d This was her parents\u2019 code: I won\u2019t be spending the evening anywhere near you. Fine with me. Beth blinked hard and followed her parents up the drive, trying not to wobble drunkenly on her high heels. The air inside at the party was stiff, as if everyone had dressed up but no one actually wanted to be there. Beth spent half an hour with a glass of champagne in her hand, painfully drunk, sweating in her green dress, and wondering why she was here before the answer to the puzzle presented itself in front of her. He looked about nineteen, he was handsome, he was wearing a tux, and he was the son of the house. He introduced himself as Gray. Beth shook his hand, aware that hers was ice-cold. \u201cI\u2019ve been told to introduce myself,\u201d Gray admitted amiably as he stood next to her. \u201cI can\u2019t say I mind, because you\u2019re pretty. Also, we\u2019re the youngest people here. Pretty boring, huh?\u201d He had the easy manner of a boy who had known from birth that he\u2019d own everything\u2014knowledge that flowed in his blood. No one had ever told him no. No one had ever wanted to. Just like me, Beth thought. Beth knew he was the reason she\u2019d been brought here, because she wasn\u2019t supposed to say no to him, either. She knew that they looked very nice together, him in his tux and her in her green dress, and that the older adults were watching them. She thought of Lily saying, Your parents are going to marry you off by the time you\u2019re nineteen, and you\u2019ll have a baby by twenty. She already wanted another drink as the schnapps wore off. Beth listened to Gray\u2019s relaxed chatter as he filled in the gaps of her silence. He probably thought she was so quiet because she was shy. The truth was that her stomach was turning and she was sick with horror, with realization: I\u2019m sixteen, and this is the map of the rest of my life. This is all of it. Unless I do something. She wondered if she could find Lily. She could tell Lily this was happening to her . . . And then what? What did she think Lily would do? Swoop in and save her? She glanced at Gray, who was shaking the hand of an older man. She glanced around at the house\u2014big, ugly, ostentatious, down the street from her parents. No one is coming, she reminded herself. No one is coming. She had looked up clock towers after Lily had mentioned them that night on the park bench. That comment had made no sense, and Lily always made sense. Lily didn\u2019t ramble about things she didn\u2019t mean. It had taken an actual trip to the library, a place Beth never went, and after wandering helplessly and feeling like an idiot she\u2019d broken down and told the librarian that she was doing a school paper, and was there anything about people in clock towers? The librarian had looked bemused. \u201cClock towers? Do you mean Charles Whitman? What a strange thing to be doing a paper on.\u201d But she showed Beth a few newspaper clippings and magazine articles about the man who had taken guns into a clock tower in Texas in 1966 and started shooting people. There wasn\u2019t a lot to read, but it was still too much. Beth was shaking when she left the library. Lily had known about that. She\u2019d thought about it. Why don\u2019t you ever hear of a woman in a clock tower? Beth drank more champagne, then excused herself to one of the huge marble bathrooms to throw up. \u201cYou could have been nicer to him,\u201d Mariana said to her when they left, as they were getting in the car and her father was starting it. \u201cYou could have laughed more. You can be charming when you want to be.\u201d Beth sat in the back seat, feeling the welcome cold air on her overheated skin. She wasn\u2019t drunk anymore, and she found herself wondering how she could steal the bottle of red wine from the liquor cabinet. \u201cLily should be here,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time for little girls to play together,\u201d Mariana said sharply. \u201cYou have more important things to do.\u201d \u201cLike what? Get married? I\u2019m sixteen.\u201d \u201cYou need to be seen by important people,\u201d Mariana said. \u201cYou\u2019re old enough now. You can start planning your future.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable,\u201d Julian said to his wife. \u201cYou\u2019re setting her up to be you, aren\u2019t you? Is that what you want? Did you start at sixteen?\u201d \u201cStop it!\u201d Mariana\u2019s voice was cracked and shrill. \u201cStop it!\u201d The car was silent, the cold night gliding by outside. \u201cI want to talk to Lily,\u201d Beth said. \u201cI want to talk to her on the phone or send her a letter. I want to tell her that she should have been here.\u201d \u201cYou have no need to do that,\u201d Mariana said. Beth felt her jaw flex. She was grown-up enough to be introduced to boys named Gray, but not grown-up enough to send her own letters. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d she insisted. \u201cWhere did she go?\u201d \u201cShe moved out of her foster parents\u2019 house,\u201d Mariana said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t leave an address that I know of.\u201d \u201cWe have to find her!\u201d Beth felt panic rise in her throat. Julian chimed in as he pulled into the driveway of the Greer mansion. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, what for? I\u2019m sure she\u2019s fine.\u201d Beth stared at the back of his head. There was something about the confident tone of his voice\u2014for a second, she was certain that Julian knew where Lily was, even if Mariana didn\u2019t. Lily was Julian\u2019s enemy, and Julian was far from stupid. He wouldn\u2019t let Lily drop out of his sight. Even so, he didn\u2019t get it. Julian had thought Lily would ask for money or something. But no one knew how David the groundskeeper had gone over the edge or what had happened to the foster family that gave her bruises. Lily was an adult now, wandering somewhere alone. She looked like a pretty blond eighteen-year-old, but she was actually a loaded gun. No one understood that except Beth. Everyone assumed Lily was just another girl who would disappear into obscurity. Why don\u2019t you ever hear of a woman in a clock tower? No one would ever think it was possible. Beth herself hadn\u2019t thought it possible\u2014she hadn\u2019t wanted to. But really she knew. She\u2019d send a letter. She didn\u2019t need her parents for that. Late that night, when they were asleep, Beth went into her father\u2019s study and rifled through his desk. She found a piece of paper in his handwriting with Lily\u2019s address on it, a house in Portland that was likely a boardinghouse, because her hunch had been right\u2014Julian did know where Lily was. Beth wrote Lily a letter in her neat, well-schooled handwriting, a letter that was full of panicked pleas: I wanted you here this Christmas. It wasn\u2019t my idea not to invite you. They made me go to a party and meet a man named Gray, because everything you said is true. Help me. Write me and I\u2019ll find a way to give you money. I\u2019ll do anything. Just please write me, and come visit, and don\u2019t do anything stupid. Please, please. She mailed the letter and waited. She never got a reply. But she never got the letter back, either, so she knew it had been delivered. Maybe Lily didn\u2019t write because she was angry. Maybe she wasn\u2019t talking to Beth anymore. Maybe she was finished with the Greers and starting a new life. Or maybe everything Beth wrote in her letter, Lily already knew. \n CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO October 2017 SHEA \u201cStop,\u201d I said. \u201cStop.\u201d Beth stopped talking, and silence fell. We were in the living room of the Greer mansion, surrounded by its musty vintage furniture. Outside the curtains, darkness had fallen. The dinner hour was long over, but neither of us had eaten. Beth had been talking for hours. The house was still, as if the entire place was listening to Beth. There was no movement past the curtains on the lawn outside. The ceramic mermaid and shepherdess sat unseeing on the shelf behind the sofa, their glassy eyes blank. On the coffee table next to Beth\u2019s elbow was a glass ashtray the size of a baby\u2019s head. I hadn\u2019t noticed it before. It likely hadn\u2019t been used in decades, and yet it was still there, gleaming in the dim light. \u201cYes, Shea?\u201d Beth said. \u201cDid you get all of that?\u201d I grabbed my phone, which was still recording, and jabbed it with my thumb. Then I picked up my papers, though I knew all of the dates by heart. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about Christmas 1970,\u201d I said. \u201cYour father died in March 1973.\u201d Beth\u2019s face was still, pale and beautiful. \u201cYes,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWhat happened in those two years? Where was Lily?\u201d \u201cSeattle for a while,\u201d Beth said. \u201cSalt Lake City. There were a few months in San Francisco, then Arizona. Those are the places I know of because those are the places I sent money when she eventually wrote me and asked.\u201d \u201cYou sent her money?\u201d Beth\u2019s smile was bitter. \u201cI didn\u2019t have much money of my own at sixteen, but I sent her whatever I could beg, borrow, or steal. I thought I was helping my poor half sister who had been treated so badly. I was stupid in those days. All I can say for myself is that it was the last time she fooled me.\u201d \u201cHow did she fool you?\u201d \u201cBecause my father was sending her money, too. She\u2019d blackmailed him with threats that she\u2019d start telling the truth about whose daughter she was. My father hated Lily, but it was easier to shut her up than to fight her. At least at first. I think he figured if he just paid her, she\u2019d stay away forever. But I didn\u2019t know about that until after he died. I just stupidly thought the money I sent her was the only money she had.\u201d Beth looked away from me, at the windows, seeing nothing as she spoke. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t understand, Shea, is that everything is my fault. All of it. I didn\u2019t pull the trigger, but I might as well have. Everything is on me.\u201d The air in the room was cold now, oppressive, hard to breathe. I felt beads of sweat start along my hairline. \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause I could have stopped her,\u201d Beth said, still not looking at me. \u201cI knew what she was, even then. I didn\u2019t want to admit it to anyone, but I knew. I was the only one who suspected about David. But Lily left town, and I chose to believe it was over. I finished high school and stopped thinking about it, except when I sent her money. I made the same mistake Julian did, but the difference was that I knew better. I knew Lily, and he didn\u2019t. So while I was worried about math tests and the fact that my parents wanted me to marry Gray, Lily was . . .\u201d I was leaning forward, entranced despite the cold sweat running down my skin. \u201cLily was what?\u201d \u201cShe never told me,\u201d Beth said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll bet there are deaths in those cities, when Lily was there, that no one could ever explain. Unsolved murders, even. They\u2019d be buried under decades of other murders by now, forgotten. But they\u2019re there, like David\u2019s death. Like whatever happened to her foster family.\u201d The silence was a heavy weight in the room. This was the crux of it, then; this was what Beth wanted me to believe. She wanted me to believe that at eighteen, her sister had become a serial killer. It wasn\u2019t so strange, was it? After all, I\u2019d been willing to believe that Beth was one herself. \u201cI should have looked for her,\u201d Beth said. \u201cI should have found a way. She\u2019d given me addresses to send money to. She was using assumed names\u2014Veronica Jenshak, one or two others. I should have taken my money, gotten in my car, and gone to find her. Tried to stop her. Done whatever it took. I think part of her wanted me to do it\u2014to defy my parents, leave town, and go look for her, even if it was only to have her locked up. Part of her wanted me to care. She called me and begged me once. It was the only time in my life I ever heard her distressed.\u201d My mouth was dry. I was on the knife-edge, listening to her words. \u201cWhat did she beg you for?\u201d But Beth shook her head. \u201cThat was later\u2014years later. I\u2019d stopped giving her money by then. But before my father died, I was young and scared and stupid. I thought maybe Lily would just behave, be nice, if I gave her the money she wanted. I stayed home, and people died because of it. I don\u2019t have to know who they were to know they died. I just know.\u201d I wondered if it was possible to find any murders that might be Lily\u2019s. Without an exact timeline, it was nearly impossible. \u201cAnd then what?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd then two things happened.\u201d Beth ran a hand through her hair and turned back to me. \u201cThe first is that I finished high school. It was understood by everyone that I would marry Gray, but I had to finish high school first. After that, it was simply a matter of waiting for him to propose. That was all I was good for\u2014marrying rich. College was out of the question; my parents would never have sent me, I didn\u2019t have my own money, and my grades weren\u2019t good enough for even a small scholarship. So that was that. I was going to be a wife.\u201d It sounded terrible. \u201cAnd the second thing?\u201d \u201cThe second thing that happened was that Julian decided that with Lily gone so long and my future all but settled, he was done paying Lily her blackmail money. And he stopped.\u201d My muscles were tense, aching, my mind racing. \u201cMarch 1973,\u201d I said. Down the hall, there was the shush of a tap being turned on in the bathroom. \u201cI had written to Lily about Gray over the years,\u201d Beth said. \u201cI told her I didn\u2019t want to marry him, to marry anyone. She never answered me about that. Her letters were always short and to the point: how much money she needed and where I should send it. She never even signed her real name. She\u2019d only sign her letters with \u2018See you soon.\u2019 \u201d She glanced at me. \u201cBefore you ask, I burned every letter after I got it, so, no, you can\u2019t see them.\u201d I sagged in my seat. She knew me so well. Beth swallowed, her jaw tight. \u201cEven though Lily never said anything, I knew she was reading my letters. I was selfish. I wouldn\u2019t go find her, but in a way I wanted her to come back and find me. Then one Saturday, I went shopping and my mother went to her bridge club and my father got shot in the face, right in the kitchen over there.\u201d She motioned toward the hall, toward the sound of the taps. I felt queasy, wondering if there was blood running in that sink right now. What I would see if I went in there. \u201cLily,\u201d I said. \u201cI got what I wanted, didn\u2019t I? Lily came back. It changed everything,\u201d Beth said. \u201cEverything. My mother fell apart. Gray\u2019s family got cold feet, because my father was the prestigious one in our family, the CEO. Without him, we were just a silly girl with nice tits and her sad, broken mother. We were an embarrassment, as if murder was contagious. It was easy for Gray and me to break it off\u2014Mariana was so drunk she didn\u2019t even notice. And as an added benefit, all of Julian\u2019s money came to Mariana. And to me.\u201d \u201cBeth, you don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t Lily. Maybe\u2014\u201d \u201cIt was Lily,\u201d Beth said. \u201cI knew she had killed my father, and I never said anything, because I was nineteen and no one would have believed me. I never said anything because I was afraid of her. I never said anything because it was my fault. I\u2019d told Lily about the way the inheritance worked, about Gray. I\u2019d set everything in motion.\u201d \u201cThis is insane,\u201d I said. \u201cAll of this is insane.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s true,\u201d Beth said. \u201cI caused everything. I knew what my sister was and I didn\u2019t stop it. And six weeks after Julian died, Lily came home.\u201d \u2014 An hour later, I stumbled out of the Greer mansion and down the front walk. I was sweaty, gasping for air, as dizzy as if I were sick. I dropped my messenger bag on the sidewalk and stood for a minute with my hands on my knees. It was full dark now. I hadn\u2019t intended to stay this late; I never stayed out after dark unless it was with my sister and Will. Now I was stranded in Arlen Heights in the dark, alone. I closed my eyes and tried to catch my breath. That house. How did Beth live in that house? Something had been in the kitchen right before I left\u2014something that thumped heavily as it moved around, something that hit the floor hard enough to feel it. I hadn\u2019t had the guts to go look at whatever it was, whatever Beth had awakened by telling the story of Lily. Whatever she had perhaps made angry. \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked no one, letting the word whisper out into the dark air. Why was Beth telling me this after all these years? Why me? It wasn\u2019t a whim, I knew that. Beth Greer didn\u2019t have whims. She did things according to plan. Maybe her plan was to drive me over the edge, give me a nervous breakdown. If so, it was working. I pulled out my phone. My pulse was pounding in my throat. I was alone at night, far from home. I could call a taxi or an Uber. I could call Michael to come get me. I could call Esther and Will. I could go to the nearest bus stop and wait in the darkness, alone. My thumb hovered over Michael\u2019s number. He\u2019d come for me, I knew. If I called, he\u2019d come. I took another breath, and another. I didn\u2019t dial his number. Face your fears, Shea. It\u2019s time. Was that Beth\u2019s voice I heard in my head? I wiped my forehead, stood up straight. I looked up and down the quiet street. There were no cars, no one walking at this hour. The bus into Arlen Heights didn\u2019t run this late. I\u2019d have to walk to the bottom of the road, over a mile downhill, to catch the bus downtown. Somewhere far off, a door slammed. The wind rustled in the trees. Behind me, the lights went off in the Greer mansion, leaving me in even deeper darkness. I turned and looked back at the house, my sneakers crunching against the gravel of the sidewalk. The Greer mansion was still and silent. In an upstairs window was a foggy handprint, as if someone had just pressed their palm against the glass. While watching me. I took a step back, and then another. Then I put my phone in my pocket and started the long walk down the hill. \n CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE October 2017 SHEA The ocean was tame at the piers, where the houseboats bobbed in the water, but it was still the ocean. When the wind kicked up and the weather got stormy on the horizon, the boats shifted and clanked, groaning as the water tried to pull them free of their moorings. Spray slapped up on the edges of the old boards that made up the piers, and the smell was deep and fishy, salty and a little rotten. On the park bench where I sat at seven thirty in the morning, I could see the houseboats rocking, the last remnants of their flower boxes moving in the wind. Some of the boats had lights on, yellow in the dark as their occupants started their mornings. I wrapped my coat and my sweater more tightly around me. \u201cIt isn\u2019t going to storm,\u201d the man next to me on the bench said. \u201cIt looks like it is, but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s going to blow over.\u201d The man next to me was in his late seventies, but he looked much older. He was tall and too thin, his clothes hanging off him. His skin was splotchy, his eyes sunken. He looked very unwell, and he was well aware of it. A cane leaned against the bench next to him. But a few feet away, in the tiny parking lot, a sleek Mercedes waited for the man, with a hired driver inside. The man was Ransom Wells. He had phoned me over an hour ago as I lay sleepless in bed. \u201cThis is Ransom Wells,\u201d he said when I answered, as if it weren\u2019t six o\u2019clock in the morning. \u201cBeth Greer wishes for me to speak to you, and I happen to agree. I understand you work downtown, and I don\u2019t wish to interrupt your schedule. If you meet me at the bench in Langland Park, near the piers, I will be there at seven thirty, and I\u2019ll say all I wish to say.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, and hung up. Then I got up, got dressed, and took the bus to the piers. Ransom, I knew, had been a big man, florid and exciting, his presence electric. The Lady Killer case was only one of the many cases in his legendary career; he had gone on to defend celebrity clients in other high-profile cases, always making a splash in the press. But the Lady Killer case, his brilliant victory defending Beth Greer, was the one that launched him. He had retired only ten years ago, and those years had not been kind. He had lost most of his famous bulk, as if something was eating him from the inside. He looked tired. But his posture was upright as he sat on the bench next to me, and his hands, though the veins were blue and the knuckles prominent, were large and strong, the last vital thing about him. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ve shocked you with my appearance,\u201d he said. \u201cA little,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d \u201cThen that makes one of us.\u201d He sighed. \u201cShea Collins. You are a blogger, I understand, and you work at a doctor\u2019s office. Where you need to be in just over an hour.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d I had my scrub top on under my sweater and my coat. \u201cYou are also Girl A.\u201d A few weeks ago, I would have been beside myself with excitement to get an interview with Ransom Wells; he was my version of a rock star. Now, I only felt tired and a little sad. \u201cSo much for my hidden identity,\u201d I said. \u201cIt seems everyone knows.\u201d \u201cActually, the secrecy was taken very seriously at the time,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cYou were only a little girl, and no one wanted the publicity to ruin your life. I just happen to know everything and everyone. I always have.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cThough you no doubt know, I did not defend Anton Anders. I didn\u2019t work that case at all.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d I said. If he had, I wouldn\u2019t be talking to him now. I would never have come. \u201cThe Anton Anders case was a very big deal in this town,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cI realize you can turn on the TV or surf the internet and read about murders that were even more horrible, killers that killed a hundred people. But in Claire Lake, especially among the police and the investigators, the Anders case was a lightning rod. It shaped how the police do business. As tragic as it was, it\u2019s seen as a model of perfect police work, how an investigation can remove evil from society when it\u2019s done right from beginning to end. It\u2019s still discussed, still taught twenty years later. And Girl A is a part of that. That\u2019s your legacy, like it or not.\u201d I thought about how scared I had been, at twenty-nine, when I\u2019d realized I was alone in the dark outside the Greer mansion. How the simple idea of getting home had seemed insurmountable. I shook my head. I didn\u2019t really care about police training. \u201cI never chose that legacy. I never chose any legacy.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s because we don\u2019t always get to choose. In fact, we rarely do.\u201d I looked at the houseboats, moving in the gray light. I wondered if Detective Joshua Black was in his boat right now, getting up. The man who had caught my would-be killer, living the later part of his life alone. \u201cI take it you\u2019ve met him,\u201d Ransom said, watching my gaze and reading my mind. \u201cJoshua.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHow happy he must have been,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cTo see you, alive and well and so lovely, twenty years later. He wouldn\u2019t have let on, of course. But that meeting would have warmed his heart. He\u2019s that kind of man.\u201d \u201cWhy is he alone?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe was married for fifteen years or so, but it didn\u2019t work out. It never does with cops. They\u2019re an ornery bunch, married to work, and most of them are uncouth and hard to stomach for long periods of time. Joshua was the exception, but even he couldn\u2019t make it work. Dealing with death for a living is lonely. And there were no children.\u201d \u201cHe has some kind of friendship with Beth,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s because he never truly believed she killed those men. And he was right.\u201d I looked away from the houseboats and at Ransom, taking in his sallow profile. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t know who really did it,\u201d I said. \u201cBeth has never told him. And neither have you.\u201d Ransom was silent, looking out at the water. \u201cIs that why she called you now?\u201d I asked him. \u201cBecause I learned about Lily? I wonder how much you knew about her.\u201d I watched his profile. \u201cYou knew everything, didn\u2019t you? And you didn\u2019t tell Detective Black, or anyone.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cWe let it dangle as a mystery for forty years now. We didn\u2019t do it to be cruel. We did it because when a man like Joshua Black is given too much of the correct information, he\u2019ll run himself into the ground chasing it down. And then he\u2019ll find things that he doesn\u2019t want to know. There was no good in giving Joshua the answers, Shea. It would only have caused him pain, and it didn\u2019t matter anyway. Because everything was already over.\u201d \u201cThat is cruel,\u201d I said. Ransom nodded. \u201cYes, it is. But everything about this story is cruel. The beginning, the middle, the end. All of it.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI was the Greer family lawyer in the years before I went into defense work full time. Julian came to me the year I took over my father\u2019s practice. Lily had been coming to the house for some years by then. Mariana always passed her off as a distant relative, but of course Julian knew the truth. He found out about Lily when Mariana\u2019s mother died and left him all of her papers. When the secret came out, Mariana wanted the little girl to visit for Christmas. It destroyed the marriage for him. He never forgave her.\u201d \u201cI guess it\u2019s unsettling, to learn that your wife had a child before you met her,\u201d I said. Ransom gave me a disgusted look. \u201cAn eighteen-year-old girl from a good family, completely sheltered from the facts of life, doesn\u2019t get pregnant because she decides to,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you ever felt shame?\u201d The question was so startling that I could think of nothing to say. Ransom\u2019s watery, intelligent gaze was fixed on me. \u201cYou have,\u201d he said, reading my face. \u201cWe all have. Shame is corrosive and draining, and it never lets go. Mariana\u2019s father was gone\u2014he walked out on the family shortly after he came home from the war. Her sister died in a drowning accident. Mariana was taken advantage of, pure and simple. She was practically a child. And then she was ashamed, and she paid with that shame for her entire life. Over and over, every day, she paid.\u201d I was watching his face as he spoke, and I could see it. It was so easy to see when you knew what you were looking for. \u201cYou loved her,\u201d I said. The wind blew and lifted his thinning white hair. \u201cI suppose it doesn\u2019t matter now,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s been dead for over forty years. But, yes, if Mariana had even lifted a finger at me, I would have left my wife for her. But she never did. Don\u2019t worry, there is no torrid affair you need to write about after all this time. Mariana had no idea how I felt, and I never told her. It was strangely innocent, in its way.\u201d Innocent, and sad. I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say but \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Ransom shrugged. \u201cTime passes, and these things cease to matter. They\u2019re just thoughts that float away on the wind. I don\u2019t need you to pass on my silly emotions to the next generation. I have information I need you to pass on instead.\u201d I felt my spine stiffen, some of the old excitement moving into my veins. It was a part of me, that excitement, and it always would be. \u201cWhat information?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll give it to you in my own good time. You\u2019re here at my invitation, and I\u2019ll do this the way I want to. What I was trying to say was that Julian came to me about his wife\u2019s illegitimate child. He wanted to know if the girl had a legal claim on his money. The answer was no, and I told him so. We both laughed at that idea. I remember it very clearly.\u201d He tapped his fingers on his cane, then stilled them again. \u201cLily was an embarrassment, but she was just a little girl. Frankly, I put her out of my mind. I barely thought about her again until she found me in the law library six weeks after Julian died. She just walked in and sat down opposite me at the table I was reading at.\u201d \u201cLily came to find you?\u201d I said. \u201cOh, yes. God knew how she knew where I was, but she did. She was lovely by then, and very sensual in a strange way. But when I saw her face-to-face for the first time in my life, she wasn\u2019t lovely at all. She radiated something . . . repellent. A coldness. It\u2019s hard to explain when you haven\u2019t been in its presence. I know that Beth loved Lily, that they were sisters, but I have loved Beth for nearly fifty years, and Lily made me want to crawl out of my skin. She made me check the room, looking for the exits, wondering how quickly I could get to one. She made me want to call my children, make sure I knew where they were. She could fool a lot of people with her pretty, young exterior. But she couldn\u2019t fool me.\u201d \u201c \u2018I know pure evil when I see it,\u2019 \u201d I said, quoting what Ransom had said in that interview all those years ago. \u201cThat was a slip,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cThe reporter was asking me about the Lady Killer. I was thinking about Lily when I said that. The reporter assumed I was talking about Beth. And of course, once it ran I couldn\u2019t correct him, so that quote went down in history.\u201d \u201cWas Beth angry about it?\u201d \u201cNo. \u2018At least it\u2019s dramatic,\u2019 she said. \u2018You always had a flair for drama, Ransom.\u2019 \u201d He glanced at me. \u201cBeth has a great many flaws, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed. She has her own coldness and selfishness, which come from the terrible conditions she grew up in. She can be egotistical and secretive, argumentative, blunt. I understand all of those things, and I will still defend Beth Greer until I shuffle off this mortal coil. Which won\u2019t be a long wait now.\u201d \u201cWhat did Lily want?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhen she came to you in the law library?\u201d \u201cShe wanted money. She\u2019d had both Beth and Julian sending her money for a while, but Julian had cut her off, and Lily wanted more. Now Julian was dead, so she knew the money should be Mariana\u2019s. Lily wanted to know if she could get Mariana to sign something to access it. Not just guilt money\u2014something permanent. \u2018You know who I am,\u2019 she said, and I had to admit that yes, I knew. She said she\u2019d go to the press, tell them who she was. She wanted money for the promise to stay quiet. Just like she\u2019d done with Julian.\u201d I tried to imagine myself at twenty-one cornering Ransom Wells, ordering him to set me up for life. Lily may have been a psychopath, but she was also pretty ballsy. \u201cWhat did you tell her?\u201d I asked. \u201cI told her to go to hell,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cIncidentally, I hope she\u2019s there now. Because I meant it. I told her that some silly blond chit wasn\u2019t going to scare me. She said, \u2018That\u2019s what Julian thought until I shot him in the face.\u2019 \u201d Jesus. \u201cDid you believe her?\u201d \u201cDid I?\u201d Ransom thought about it. \u201cI had to do a quick recalculation when she said that. Because if she\u2019d done it, then I was in danger. And, yes, I believed her. I had the same preconceptions and prejudices of any man my age in 1973, but I\u2019ve always been more willing to face the truth than other people are. And the truth was, this girl had killed my client, my friend, for his money, and it was nothing to her. She let me see the truth of herself in that moment. I don\u2019t think she did that very often.\u201d I was engrossed now. The sun was up, and I didn\u2019t know if I would be late for work, but I didn\u2019t care. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d \u201cI told her I didn\u2019t believe her. I told her that Julian had been murdered by a robber in a random home invasion. I told her that if she had killed Julian in hopes of getting his money, it would have been an awfully foolish move. Mariana had a nervous breakdown after Julian\u2019s death and signed all of her affairs over to me. And I had no intention of submitting to blackmail, so Julian\u2019s death would be for nothing\u2014if, of course, she had actually killed him. Which, I said, I doubted.\u201d He folded his hands over his cane. \u201cIt was a risky move, talking to her like that, but I\u2019ve made risky moves all my life. I insulted her, but at the same time I gave her an out. She took it. She left, and I never saw her in person again.\u201d \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t the last you heard of her.\u201d \u201cNo. But I don\u2019t want to think about Lily anymore. She\u2019s your problem now.\u201d He pulled a sealed envelope from his leather satchel and handed it to me. \u201cHere are some papers, the few that are left. Julian destroyed most of them. There are also some other things of my own that you need to read. Ask yourself why Beth has decided to tell everything now, after all of these years.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, taking the envelope. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason behind everything Beth does,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t told me what the reason is, but I know there is one. I haven\u2019t asked her about it. There are a lot of things I haven\u2019t asked Beth about. I\u2019ve survived this long and I\u2019ve been as successful as I have, because I don\u2019t ask about things I\u2019d rather not know.\u201d I looked down at the envelope in my hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have that talent. Maybe I\u2019d be better off if I did.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for it all to come out, I think,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the time is now, but it is. Whatever you find, Shea, do me a favor and don\u2019t tell me a damn thing.\u201d \n CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR May 1973 BETH Six weeks after Julian died, Beth did something she\u2019d almost never done: She spent the day shopping with her mother. Mariana had always been a shopper. It was her job: Buy nice things, then buy more nice things. Sometimes, like at Christmas, she\u2019d be briefly excited about what she bought, but the rest of the time she shopped with a curious blankness, often forgetting about her purchases and leaving them piled in a corner, still in the shopping bags. Shopping certainly wasn\u2019t a joyous mother-daughter activity, and as soon as Beth could drive she would take one of the family cars and go shopping for herself. Since Julian\u2019s death, things had spun out of control. Mariana drank nonstop; Beth drank almost as much. The two women wandered the house like ghosts, sometimes sleeping until noon, sometimes awake at four in the morning. Beth alternated between telling herself Lily hadn\u2019t really killed Julian and freezing, mind-numbing fear. She wanted so badly to fix things for her mother, to make things right again. But already Beth knew that she wasn\u2019t the one who made things right in bad situations; she was the one who somehow made things worse. She had finished high school, which was meaningless. Why had she bothered? She wasn\u2019t going to college. She wasn\u2019t going to be a teacher or a nurse or a normal person. Her father\u2019s business partners would take over his company, Greer Pharmaceuticals, though Beth would get a share of the profits for life. She was supposed to marry Gray and be a society wife, but that was over, too. For six weeks, Beth stared at the nothingness of her future with helpless numbness, tempered with flashes of anger that only eased when she raided Mariana\u2019s liquor cabinet again. I should do something, Beth thought to herself over and over. But she couldn\u2019t make herself do anything. And then one day in May, the sun was shining and Mariana was temporarily sober. She put her hair up, put her makeup on, and said to Beth, \u201cLet\u2019s go shopping!\u201d Beth said yes. They drove to the Edengate Plaza, a brand-new shopping center on the outskirts of Claire Lake. Mariana wore a long, draped dress and had tied a paisley scarf into her blond hair. Beth wore a ringer tee and high-waisted jeans, flip-flops, her hair down. The air was tinged with the first promise of summer, warmth edging into the cool dampness, almost hot under the direct sun and in the enclosed car. Beth felt her hangover drain away in the sunshine. Neil Diamond played on the radio as they drove. \u201cThis is going to be so fun!\u201d Mariana said, her voice bright. Beth smiled tentatively at her mother, and she thought maybe it would be fun. The Edengate Plaza was new, still an exciting place to go. It was a long building of dusty brown brick, with a colonnade along one side roofed by dark brown siding. It was built for Claire Lake\u2019s richer clientele, with fashion shoe stores, dress stores, and jewelry stores lining the colonnade. The sign in front showed a drawing of three hourglass women, in Chanel dresses and pillbox hats, strolling the colonnade in high heels, with the slogan the only shopping experience you need! \u201cLook, honey,\u201d Mariana said, pointing at the sign as they parked. \u201cIt\u2019s the only shopping experience we need!\u201d Beth laughed, more excited that Mariana had used the term of endearment than about the joke. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time Mariana had called her that. They joined the shoppers on the colonnade. They tried on shoes, dresses. Mariana bought a lipstick in deep, vibrant red, the kind of color you\u2019d see on Marilyn Monroe or Hedy Lamarr. When Beth found a silk shawl that was the same red, Mariana cried out in excitement. \u201cYou should buy that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for you.\u201d \u201cDo you think?\u201d Beth asked. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d Mariana took the shawl, wound it over Beth\u2019s shoulders, and stood back. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. You look like a woman who can conquer anything.\u201d Beth didn\u2019t feel like a woman who could conquer anything, but in that moment it didn\u2019t matter. That was what Mariana saw when she looked at her, and it made her feel better than she had in weeks, maybe ever. She bought the shawl. The few men at the Edengate Plaza looked at them that day. They looked at Mariana, beautiful and blond and pale, the scarf wound in her hair. They looked at Beth, nineteen and sultry without even trying. For once, Beth didn\u2019t mind. It was nice to be looked at, to be admired. They ate hamburgers at the nearby burger place, and they shopped some more before finally going home. And then, as they pulled into the driveway, Mariana cried out in joy: \u201cLily!\u201d Beth looked, and the coldness came back, the darkness starting to lower again. Because Lily was sitting on the front steps of the Greer mansion, wearing jeans and a poncho, waiting for them to come home. And Mariana\u2019s joy wasn\u2019t forced or false anymore. It was genuine. Lily stood as Mariana got out of the car, closing the door behind her, forgetting her packages, forgetting Beth. She nearly ran toward her first daughter, and her expression lit up. She stopped a few feet short of Lily, unwilling to hug her, though clearly wishing to. Hugs repulsed Lily, so Mariana touched her lightly instead, brushing her fingertips over Lily\u2019s shoulders, her face. \u201cYou\u2019re so thin,\u201d Mariana said as Beth slowly got out of the car. Lily had lost weight. Her face was thin, and she wasn\u2019t wearing any makeup. The poncho was worn and had holes at the seams, and Beth knew that part wasn\u2019t a put-on; Lily must be broke. She herself hadn\u2019t sent Lily any money in months. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d Mariana was asking, too excited to wait for an answer. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell me everything. Are you okay? I\u2019ve been so worried about you. When did you get back?\u201d \u201cThis morning.\u201d As Lily spoke, she looked past their mother at Beth, a smile in her eyes. We know a secret, that smile said. She was ruining everything, everything. She was a monster. \u201cMother,\u201d Beth said, holding Lily\u2019s gaze. \u201cBeth, please.\u201d Mariana barely glanced at her. To Lily she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in? I\u2019ll make you a lemonade.\u201d \u201cMother,\u201d Beth said, louder. Mariana turned and snapped at her, her good mood from their outing gone. \u201cBeth, you\u2019re being rude.\u201d \u201cNo, please,\u201d Lily said. She put her hand on Mariana\u2019s arm, and Mariana stared at the contact, stunned. \u201cI want to hear what she has to say. What is it you\u2019d like to tell us, Beth?\u201d Beth stared at them. At Lily, so thin and waifish under her poncho after years on the road. At Mariana, beaming at this one small touch from her daughter, her firstborn. The bitter girl, not the sweet. She killed Julian. Beth was supposed to say the words. She broke into the house and shot him in the face. She shot your husband and left him dead on the kitchen floor. Don\u2019t you care? Doesn\u2019t anyone care? No one would believe her. And if she could ever prove it was true, it would kill Mariana. It would crush her forever. It was over. This nice day, her mother\u2019s attention, the possibility that anything good could start to happen. Beth had been a fool to enjoy herself, even for a few hours, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to regret it. She could still feel the warming sun in her hair, still hear Neil Diamond on the radio, still hear Mariana say \u201choney.\u201d She could still feel that echo of the moment when she looked like she could conquer anything. She still liked the illusion, even though she knew the truth. She couldn\u2019t conquer anything at all. \u201cWelcome back, Lily,\u201d she said. \u201cHow long will you stay?\u201d \n CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE December 1977 BETH Jail wasn\u2019t as bad as Beth had thought it would be. She didn\u2019t have to talk to people, for one. She didn\u2019t have to argue or justify herself or make good impressions on people. She didn\u2019t even have to make decisions anymore\u2014Ransom, out there somewhere in the freedom of the real world, made most of her decisions for her. She didn\u2019t have to plan a schedule or decide what to wear or what to eat. She didn\u2019t have to wake up every day in the Greer mansion, breathing its stuffy air and looking at the reminders of her parents in every room. She didn\u2019t have to see the kitchen floor, picture the way the blood had looked pooled on it. She didn\u2019t have to see Mariana\u2019s beautiful clothes in her closet, never to be worn again. She didn\u2019t have to think about anything at all. Not that Beth wasn\u2019t thinking\u2014she was. Her memories were sharp and detailed, tormenting in their precision. It should have been an overwhelming blur, too much to take in, but for once Beth\u2019s brain wouldn\u2019t shut down, wouldn\u2019t disappear into panic or numbness. She was awake now, maybe for the first time in her life. Ransom told her the arrest had happened because of the gun. The ballistics had matched the gun from Julian\u2019s murder to the two Lady Killer murders. They didn\u2019t have the gun itself, but they had someone who had seen Beth at the second murder scene. So they\u2019d taken their gamble. Beth was angry\u2014she knew that. Buried deep down, somewhere beneath the endless buzzing and thinking in her brain, were the hot coals of fury, powering everything. It was sobriety that made things clearer\u2014the forced sobriety of being incarcerated with no access to alcohol. It wasn\u2019t until a few days had passed in her cell that Beth realized her hangover had completely cleared up, that for once she wasn\u2019t a little bit drunk or a lot drunk or living the aftereffects of being drunk. She slept deeply despite her surroundings, and she ate every bite of jail food. She could think for the first time in years. It wasn\u2019t pleasant\u2014if someone had handed her a bottle of wine, she would have upended it and drunk the whole thing, no questions asked\u2014but it was unavoidable. If Beth was going to be forced to think clearly, she may as well try to come up with a plan. Besides, while she was in the depths of this jail cell, she was safe from Lily. Beth knew she wasn\u2019t acting the way a terrified, wrongly accused woman was supposed to act\u2014eating, sleeping, not weeping or falling apart. She knew that every guard who saw into her cell, every person she spoke to, was making and spreading a scathing impression of her. She\u2019s cold. She doesn\u2019t talk, doesn\u2019t cry. She doesn\u2019t even look worried. She isn\u2019t sorry those men are dead. Detective Washington hated Beth, especially after the circus of the arrest. He was furious, as if the whole thing were Beth\u2019s fault. Ransom was high on a wave of outrage, working at his most expansive decibel level. The uniformed cops treated her with a mix of salaciousness and callousness, like she wasn\u2019t a person at all but a pinup photo in a magazine. And Detective Black was miserable, painfully unhappy about the indignities Beth was subjected to, uncomfortable around his partner and the other cops, unable to do anything about it. He was so twisted up Beth almost felt bad for him. Almost. She couldn\u2019t afford to feel bad for anyone right now. Not even herself. Her refusal to talk galled Detective Black, she knew. He thought that now that the worst had happened\u2014now that Beth was sitting in a jail cell wearing an oversized jumpsuit\u2014she should finally be a proper woman and fold under pressure. Beth sat in her cell and knew that Detective Black was bound to be disappointed in her. Being behind bars, eating crappy food, being called a murdering cunt\u2014these weren\u2019t the worst things that could happen. The worst things had already happened years ago. She looked up one day to see Black being let through the door of her cell, the uniformed female guard closing the door behind him. Beth had been given no notice he was coming. He was wearing a dark blue suit. She wondered if his kindergarten-teacher girlfriend had helped him pick it out. He was clean-shaven, his hair neatly combed, though he wore it a little long for a cop. Beth had caught the faintest whiff of aftershave when he\u2019d walked next to her during the arrest, and she knew that if she could lean in and smell his neck, the scent would be pungent and male. Aftershave, Beth thought, was one of the most important scents in any girl\u2019s world. It was the smell of fathers, or uncles, or teachers, or priests, or husbands. Beth\u2019s own father had worn aftershave, but the smell would be different on Detective Black, because sometimes aftershave was the smell of a man who wasn\u2019t, and would never be, yours. He looked at her for a long moment as she sat on the edge of the cot in her cell, wearing her denim blue jail jumpsuit. It was cold in here, but Beth didn\u2019t cross her arms. She kept her hands at the edge of the bed, beside her hips, holding on as she looked him in the eye. \u201cWhere\u2019s the gun?\u201d he asked her. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Beth said. The truth, for once. \u201cWhy were you at the second murder scene?\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d So much for the truth, then. Ransom would have a panic attack if he could hear her right now. Detective Black scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cYou\u2019re covering for someone,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know I know it. You know it\u2019s the only answer that makes sense. The question is who. And why.\u201d Beth said nothing. \u201cI\u2019ll find the answer, you know. I\u2019ll find who you\u2019re covering for.\u201d She\u2019ll kill you if you do. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have much faith in me. I\u2019m very good at my job.\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m convicted, you won\u2019t have to bother.\u201d Was she going to be convicted? Ransom was her only hope. She had told him to get her out of this, and she knew he was going to use every trick in his book. He did it because she paid him, so she had no sentimental attachment to Ransom. But still, right now he was all she had. \u201cYou have to tell me,\u201d Detective Black said, still a few moves behind. \u201cBeth, you\u2019re not stupid. You know how serious this is. Everyone, and I mean everyone, believes this was you. I\u2019m the only one who sees what\u2019s really happening. You\u2019re going to be convicted, do you understand? You\u2019re going to spend the rest of your life in prison. I\u2019m the only one who can help you.\u201d It was a good speech, but Lily had taught Beth well. Everyone wants what they want: That was one of Lily\u2019s lessons. Detective Black wanted to help her, yes. But he also wanted to solve this case. He wanted to be the one to uncover the truth. He wanted justice. He wanted Lily. No. No one got to have Lily. No one except Beth. \u201cThe Hamlet act is getting old,\u201d Beth told Detective Black. \u201cYou\u2019re so torn, aren\u2019t you? You think I didn\u2019t do it, but you also think I\u2019m a lying bitch.\u201d He looked like she\u2019d suddenly spit on him. \u201cI don\u2019t think that.\u201d \u201cYes, you do. I didn\u2019t kill those men, but I could have. I could have shot them while I looked in their faces, watched them die, and felt nothing. That\u2019s what you think, yet you know I didn\u2019t actually do it. It\u2019s driving you crazy, and it\u2019s so boring.\u201d Black shook his head. There were splotches of red on his cheekbones. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to piss me off. But, Beth, I\u2019m trying to help you.\u201d \u201cNo one,\u201d Beth said clearly, slowly, letting the words ring through the cold cell, \u201cno one is trying to help me. No one is coming for me.\u201d Black opened his mouth, but Beth talked over him. She was so sick of people talking over her, of men interrupting her and speaking on her behalf. As if they knew even a fraction of what went on in her mind, as if they knew what it was like to be her, for a day, for an hour. Sometimes she was so angry she wished she\u2019d shot those men herself, which was exactly what Lily understood about her. \u201cI can help myself,\u201d Beth told him. \u201cI don\u2019t need you. Go home to your kindergarten teacher. Go marry her and make your conventional little life. And don\u2019t ever come back here.\u201d Now Black had his own flare of anger, rare and welcome, at least to Beth. \u201cYou\u2019re being a fucking idiot. I\u2019m the only one who wants to get you out of this\u2014not because you\u2019re paying me a fee, but because I actually want to. If you\u2019re convicted, your life is over.\u201d \u201cSo what? I\u2019m nothing to you. Get out.\u201d He held steady. \u201cI\u2019m not giving up. If you didn\u2019t do this, then whoever did goes free to do it again. Whoever has that gun. Whoever wrote those notes and shot those men. It\u2019s a woman, isn\u2019t it? You know it is. If she isn\u2019t you, Beth, then she\u2019s going to kill more people until she\u2019s stopped. Are you going to be a part of that?\u201d \u201cGet out,\u201d Beth said. \u201cBeth\u2014\u201d \u201cGet out.\u201d He left. Beth watched him go as a door closed inside her and another part of her died. She gripped the cold, thin mattress of her jail-cell cot, and she thought, I am not going to live the rest of my life in here. He\u2019s wrong about that. And Lily isn\u2019t going to kill anyone else, either, ever again. Beth would make sure of it. She was in jail, arrested for two murders, her lawyer home with his wife and kids. She was alone, at the bottom of a life that had had a lot of bottoms, looking at the rest of her life in prison. It was, by any measure, the worst moment of her life. And for the first time, Beth Greer finally knew exactly what to do. \u2014 Six days later, Beth was taken from her cell to a room lined with folding tables, each framed with dirty glass. On each table was a phone, large and black, screwed to the table, the cord contained under a plastic shield so it couldn\u2019t be used as a weapon. A few of the other booths had women in them, wearing inmate clothes and hunched over their phones, talking to lawyers or husbands or children. The voices in the room were low, sharp, and tense, and the air\u2014like the air everywhere in here\u2014smelled like sweat. Everyone expected life in jail would break her. Even Ransom, who knew her so well, had his doubts. When he\u2019d finished blustering, he\u2019d asked if he could bring her anything: books, a pillow, an extra blanket. \u201cDon\u2019t let this get to you,\u201d he\u2019d said, worried. \u201cPeople are watching. That\u2019s what they want. And for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t talk to your fellow inmates.\u201d There was no chance of that. Beth had asked Ransom for a sweater and the copy of Moby-Dick she\u2019d always meant to read. The book had always seemed too dense and boring for her, which made it the perfect jail-time read. She spent days in her cell trying to decode the impenetrable prose about whales, ignoring everything around her. The only thing she missed, hard and long like other women missed their babies, was alcohol. There were few phone calls for Beth in jail. Ransom always came in person, and she had no one else in the world except for Lily. She\u2019d had two calls before this one, both of them hang-ups as soon as she came to the phone, so she knew Lily was afoot. She was playing her game. This time, when Beth answered, Lily\u2019s familiar voice was on the other end, though she sounded muffled and far away, as if they were talking through a two-way radio. \u201cI bet you\u2019re not sweet anymore,\u201d she said. Beth had thought she was ready for this\u2014she knew that Lily wouldn\u2019t be able to resist calling. But the first thing she thought of when she heard her sister\u2019s voice was that last day with Mariana, the day they went shopping at the Edengate Plaza. Beth had been alive for twenty-three years, but that was the only day in any one of them that she would get back if she could. The thought choked her, made pain and anger rise up from her stomach into her throat. It was the first time she\u2019d let herself feel furiously angry since the arrest. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d Lily asked. She sounded cheerful, unconcerned. \u201cI admit I\u2019m curious about prison. It\u2019s probably not so bad. Is it full of dykes?\u201d \u201cTurn yourself in and find out,\u201d Beth said. Lily laughed. \u201cAre you scared in there? You always were such a coward, Beth.\u201d Once, before so many people had died, those words coming from Lily would have been hurtful. But Beth wasn\u2019t six years old anymore. She didn\u2019t feel stung. She only felt icy calm, and the certainty that Lily was underestimating her. Lily\u2019s weakness\u2014maybe her only one\u2014was that she thought she was smarter than everyone. Especially Beth. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of time to think,\u201d Beth said. As if they were having a normal conversation. Because in Lily\u2019s world, everything was just fine. \u201cDo tell,\u201d Lily said. \u201cI\u2019ve been remembering the night our mother died.\u201d There was silence on the other end of the line. \u201cWhich one of us killed her, do you think?\u201d Beth asked her half sister. \u201cYou, or me?\u201d More silence. They had never talked about this. There had never been time. After that day when Lily came home, she had stayed at the Greer mansion on and off for two years. She\u2019d show up when she needed money, stay until she and Mariana had a fight, and then she\u2019d take off again. Over and over. When Lily was gone, Mariana would be sick with worry. When Lily came home, Mariana always welcomed her back. Beth watched all of it, helpless. Mariana never wanted to hear the truth about Lily: that she was a user, a manipulator. That she didn\u2019t love Mariana the way Beth did. That in the stretches when she was away, out of sight, Beth was certain that people were dying. She could never prove it, could never find Lily when she truly wanted to be lost. But Beth knew her half sister, and she knew that when Lily was in one of her cold, angry moods, someone somewhere was going to die. \u201cShe\u2019s just lonely,\u201d Mariana would say in Lily\u2019s defense, over and over. \u201cAll those foster homes. She\u2019s starved for a mother\u2019s love.\u201d I\u2019m starved for a mother\u2019s love, Beth wanted to shout, her inner six-year-old still in pain. But it would have made no difference; Mariana wouldn\u2019t hear it. She had only now edged into the territory in which she could admit, even obliquely, that she was Lily\u2019s mother. She was too fragile for anything more. Beth stayed silent to keep her mother safe. But when Lily was home, she always hurt her mother, cutting her with words, punching her with accusations: Look at you. What\u2019s wrong with you? You don\u2019t care about me. You never cared. That\u2019s why you sent me away every year. One night, Lily and Mariana screamed at each other, Mariana with tears streaming down her face. You failed me, Lily shouted while Beth stood in the living room doorway, unable to stop either of them. You never loved me. I hate you. Everything that\u2019s happened to me is your fault. And Mariana: I didn\u2019t know what else to do. I loved you so much, Lily. I loved you more than anything. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. It ended, as it always did, with Lily leaving, slamming the door behind her. Mariana, already half-drunk, drank more. But Mariana was on those pills: What were they? Uppers? Downers? Where had she gotten them? She was always so secretive, especially with Beth. Maybe Beth could have stopped her mother from drinking so much and taking pills. Maybe she should have. But she looked at Mariana\u2019s bleary eyes and her tearstained face, and the words rang in her head: I loved you more than anything. And Beth went to bed. When she heard her mother leave her bedroom in the middle of the night, mumbling to herself as she walked down the corridor to the stairs, Beth got up and followed her. She watched as Mariana, clutched in some paranoid delusion that only she could see, went out the front door and got into her car. Beth listened to the car drive away, and she did nothing. I loved you more than anything. The words went around in Beth\u2019s head as she stood there. Within an hour, Mariana was dead. Lily didn\u2019t call or come home, and Beth was completely alone. \u201cSometimes I think it was me who killed her,\u201d Beth said now, twisting the knife into her half sister. \u201cBut then, she wouldn\u2019t have mixed the pills with the alcohol if you hadn\u2019t told her she failed you. That you hated her.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a lie,\u201d Lily said. \u201cTell yourself that if you want.\u201d Beth\u2019s hand on the receiver was slick with cold sweat. \u201cYou\u2019re the crazy one, not me.\u201d \u201cDoes it make you feel better to think of me as crazy?\u201d Lily\u2019s voice was sharp. \u201cDoes it make you feel smug? Are you sure you\u2019re the sane one, Beth?\u201d It was so hypnotic, that voice. So convincing. Beth rubbed her forehead. Yes, she was the sane one. She had never killed anyone. Except Mariana, that night she stood and watched her leave. Except everyone who came after, because she didn\u2019t stop Lily when she\u2019d had the chance. \u201cHow long was it before you knew she was dead?\u201d Beth asked. \u201cYou were gone. When did you finally know?\u201d There was another brief pause, and then Lily gave her the truth for once. \u201cThree months. But part of me knew. I\u2019d been living like she was already dead. Then I looked for her obituary in old copies of the paper, and I found it. I knew. That\u2019s why I\u2019d started looking at obituaries.\u201d For one moment, crackling over the phone line from jail, Beth felt her own pain and her sister\u2019s pain mix together. It was still so raw, even now. Mariana, for all her faults, had been the only thing that both of them had ever wanted. Had they loved her? Did either of them even know what love was? For that matter, had Mariana ever known? Yes, Mariana had known what love was. I loved you more than anything. Did Beth love Lily? Maybe. But her feelings for Lily were too much like her feelings toward herself. Hate, pity, fear\u2014and anger. So much anger. And Lily . . . She wasn\u2019t sure Lily knew how to love anyone. Still, she opened her mouth to speak. Our mother is still in the house, she wanted to tell her sister. I hear her sometimes. She wants to open the bedroom door. Maybe Beth was the crazy one. Still, it was possible Lily would understand. But Lily spoke first. \u201cIt\u2019s your fault,\u201d she said, and the moment of shared grief was over as she brought out her old weapons, anger and blame. \u201cYou let her die that night. You know you did.\u201d Beth went cold, and she put her confession away. \u201cI\u2019m going to get out of here. You know that, right?\u201d \u201cYou probably will. You weasel out of everything bad. You always have. I suppose I should say sorry that they arrested you instead of me, but I\u2019m not sorry at all. It\u2019s nice to see you suffer for once.\u201d Beth knew that tone. Lily was feeling victorious, untouchable. This was when she was at her weakest. \u201cWhen I get out, I\u2019m giving you enough money to go away forever. And then we\u2019re never seeing each other again.\u201d Now Lily sounded interested. \u201cI\u2019m finally getting my half?\u201d \u201cAnything,\u201d Beth said, a note of desperation in her voice. \u201cAnything you want. Anything to end this.\u201d \u201cThen get out quick, dummy. I\u2019m waiting.\u201d \u201cWhen I get out, how do I find you?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Lily said. \u201cI\u2019ll find you.\u201d When Beth stood to go back to her cell, she knew her expression was hard. She knew the guard was watching her, that she\u2019d go home and tell her husband that Beth Greer, the infamous Lady Killer, was the coldest woman she\u2019d ever seen. She knew that in some ways, even if she won this game with Lily, she was damaged forever. But it didn\u2019t matter now, if it ever had. Since that November morning so long ago when she\u2019d seen the writing on the window, this was always going to happen. She could see that now. They had been locked in this together, she and Lily, for all these years. And now they were coming to the end. At last. Beth went back to her cell in silence and started reading Moby-Dick again. \n CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX October 2017 SHEA The envelope from Ransom Wells was a treasure trove of information. Michael and I couldn\u2019t process it all sitting at the table at the diner where I\u2019d met him after work. \u201cI need my laptop,\u201d Michael had said. \u201cI have to verify this.\u201d That was how we ended up here, at his apartment. Just the two of us, alone. I was breaking another one of my rules, but it didn\u2019t matter. I had to be here, going through this file. Everything about Michael\u2019s apartment said divorced guy who moved out in a hurry. The sofa was secondhand, definitely bought after the move, but the TV was big and new\u2014he\u2019d brought that with him. His fridge was full, but he didn\u2019t have very many dishes. There were unopened boxes stacked against one wall, but there was artwork that he\u2019d chosen over the sofa, a large framed print of the ocean taken from the top of the bluffs, the seabirds wheeling in the sky, the whitecaps breaking in an endless beautiful pattern. On one of the end tables was a framed photo of Michael in police uniform, standing with two men who looked almost exactly like him, obviously his father and his uncle. \u201cIgnore the mess,\u201d he said sheepishly when he saw me looking around. He walked to a crowded, well-used desk in the corner\u2014Ikea, likely bought and put together in haste\u2014and picked up a laptop, bringing it over to the sofa. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I said, meaning it. \u201cI\u2019ve lived this mess.\u201d His eyebrows rose. \u201cMeaning?\u201d \u201cYou brought your favorite things when you moved out,\u201d I said. I pointed. \u201cThe family photos, the TV, the ocean print. Your work computer. You left everything else.\u201d \u201cShe picked out our sofa, and I always hated it,\u201d he said, speaking my language. \u201cSo now I have this. The ocean print is a photo I took myself. I\u2019m no photographer, and I don\u2019t even have the best camera, but I lucked out that day. I\u2019ve always just really liked that picture. My ex never understood why I spent the money getting it enlarged and framed. So, yeah, I took it with me.\u201d I got that. There was a lot of talk about the psychological effects of divorce, about the emotions and the heartbreak, but no one ever talked about the things. How you had to go through every item you owned, even in your head, and figure out whether it was really something that was yours or not. How you had to pack your things, move your things, haul your things. Throw out your things. Van and I had sold our house, which meant we\u2019d had to empty every closet, every room, one by one, decide what was going to happen to every potted plant and picture frame. It had been excruciating, so exquisitely painful and drawn-out that I never wanted to do it again. I was living with Winston Purrchill, and that was enough for me. Still, I was very aware that I was alone with Michael. He was wearing dark jeans, a T-shirt that had a faded Rolling Stones logo on it, and a long leather jacket in a style that at one time had been referred to as a car coat. I\u2019d always pictured him in my mind with a retro look, and it turned out he really had it. And\u2014I had to admit it\u2014I liked it. \u201cDo you want a drink?\u201d he asked, oblivious to how tongue-tied I was. He put his laptop on the coffee table and took his coat off. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d I sat on the sofa, next to him but with a few feet of space between us. I was still wearing my scrub top and my sweater, though I slid my coat off. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the birth certificate,\u201d I said. That was the first gift Ransom Wells had given us: Lily\u2019s birth certificate. According to the certificate, Lily\u2019s name was Lillian Knowles, and she was born in January of 1952. Her mother was Mariana Pattinson, age nineteen. Her father was unknown. \u201cKnowles,\u201d Michael said, waking up his laptop and beginning to work. \u201cThat\u2019s the name they gave Mariana\u2019s baby. They didn\u2019t give Lily Mariana\u2019s maiden name, likely because they didn\u2019t want her publicly connected to the family. But where did Knowles come from?\u201d We found the name further back in the family tree; it was Mariana\u2019s grandmother\u2019s maiden name. So Lily started life without being given her mother\u2019s name, or her father\u2019s, either. Lily had spent her life in foster care. The records were sealed\u2014even to Ransom Wells\u2014but there was a one-page summary from a report made in 1969, when Lily was moved from one family to another. Hostile behavior, the report listed laconically under the heading \u201cNotes.\u201d The reason for the transfer was only listed as suicide of family member. I wanted to shake the truth out of whoever had written those four words and nothing else. Suicide of family member? Lily would have been seventeen in 1969\u2014the year after she\u2019d come to visit Beth with bruises on her face. The next year, when Beth had asked what happened to her foster family, Lily had said, Bad things. Maybe those bad things had really been suicide. Maybe they had been murder. If murder, was this unnamed family member Lily\u2019s first victim? Or was the first victim David, the groundskeeper? \u201cI have more questions than answers,\u201d I said to Michael as I handed him the paper. \u201cThis is going to drive me crazy.\u201d \u201cTell me about it,\u201d Michael said. \u201cRead this.\u201d It was a newspaper clipping from 1975. A man named Lawrence Gage had been shot in his bedroom in Phoenix, Arizona, in an apparent home invasion. Gage was divorced, and he was in bed alone. The intruder came through a screen door, killed Gage, and took some cash and valuables. No one could think of any enemies Gage, a retiree, could have had. The crime was especially distressing because Gage was shot in the face. \u201cAnother victim,\u201d I said. \u201cRead the last part,\u201d Michael said. The final paragraph stated that Gage had lived in Phoenix for four years, ever since he retired. He had moved from Claire Lake, Oregon, where he had spent all of his career running a department store. If Gage was from Claire Lake, and Lily had killed him in Phoenix\u2014if she was his killer, which Ransom seemed to think\u2014then it wasn\u2019t random. Lily had tracked Gage to a different city. She had targeted him. Why? Ransom Wells had kept this article in his file all these years. Why? I looked up. My eyes locked with Michael\u2019s, and we asked each other the question silently before I said it aloud. \u201cLily\u2019s father?\u201d \u201cI checked the dates,\u201d Michael said. \u201cMariana was nineteen when Lily was born. Lawrence Gage lived in Arlen Heights then. He would have been forty-three.\u201d I thought of Ransom saying, Mariana was taken advantage of, pure and simple. She was practically a child. And then she was ashamed. \u201cHe could have known Mariana\u2019s family,\u201d Michael said. \u201cHe was wealthy and ran a department store. They would have moved in the same circles.\u201d He could have been a friend of the family, which meant he could have met teenage Mariana. Perhaps he had assaulted her; perhaps he had only fooled her. The result was the same either way. Lawrence Gage went on with his life as if nothing had happened, and Mariana was sent to the Elizabeth Trevor House for Women to have her baby in secret. A little girl. And then, years later, had he woken to see that little girl grown into a woman, standing over him in bed with a gun to his face? What had driven Lily to the extremes she\u2019d gone to? It was convenient, and so modern, to simply say that mental illness had been the reason. When mental illness was combined with a neglectful and possibly abusive childhood, you had a recipe for a serial killer, or so the research said. You had someone you could put in a box, someone you could point to and say: See? Look at that person. That person isn\u2019t me. But there was nothing in these papers that said Lily had ever been diagnosed by a professional. There was nothing to say she\u2019d seen a psychiatrist at all. For all her love for Lily, Mariana had never taken her to a doctor or a social worker. There was nothing to show that either Mariana or Beth had ever tried to help her. There was nothing that spoke to how much Lily might have suffered. There was nothing to show that, after being born in secret to the wrong woman at the wrong time, Lily had had any chance at all. \u201cLily\u2019s father isn\u2019t named on the birth certificate,\u201d I said. \u201cIf Lily found out who he was, it must have been from Mariana.\u201d Michael looked at the date in the newspaper clipping. \u201cLawrence Gage was murdered three months after Mariana Greer died. If Mariana had told Lily that Gage was her father, Lily had known it for three months by then. I wonder what took her so long?\u201d I rubbed my forehead, trying to process everything. I was tired. There were too many gaps in the timeline\u2014too many months and years when Lily had just dropped off the map in a way you could still do in the midseventies, when there was no internet and there were no cell phones. In 1975, a simple fake ID and a crossing of state lines would allow you to start a new, anonymous life. Michael, who was following my train of thought without realizing it, kept talking as he shuffled through the papers. \u201cBetween Gage\u2019s murder in 1975 and Thomas Armstrong\u2019s murder in 1977 is a complete blank. Where was Lily? What set her off to start the Lady Killer murders? And where is she now?\u201d \u201cI told you, she\u2019s dead,\u201d I said. Michael narrowed his eyes at me. If he suspected it was Lily I\u2019d seen at the Greer mansion, the presence I had felt, he decided not to ask. Instead he said, \u201cI\u2019d like to see some proof of that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to see a lot of things,\u201d I replied. \u201cLet\u2019s add it to the list.\u201d \u2014 The last pages Ransom Wells had given me were records of charitable trusts. One was a charity for orphaned girls; another was to support single mothers in poverty. Another was a charity to provide mental health services \u201cfor teenage girls at risk.\u201d Another was for victims of violence. All of the charities were run by numbered companies. And, according to Ransom\u2019s paperwork, all of the numbered companies were owned by Beth Greer. I had wondered more than once what Beth had done with her time over the past forty years, since she\u2019d never married or had children and she had no need to work. This was the answer. \u201cWhy did he give us this, do you think?\u201d Michael asked, reading over the papers. His laptop was sitting on the coffee table, and outside it had long ago gone dark. \u201cThis is the story,\u201d I said, feeling bitterness as I looked at the records. I pointed to the newspaper article about Lawrence Gage. \u201cLily is the villain.\u201d I pointed to the charity records. \u201cBut not Beth. He wants us to see Beth as the heroine, the one who selflessly saves orphans and single mothers. She\u2019s the sweet one, not a killer like her sister.\u201d I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Ransom had told me he\u2019d be loyal to Beth to the end. Michael put the file down. \u201cIt\u2019s late.\u201d I looked at the clock on my phone. It was nearly ten thirty. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, getting up and grabbing my coat, my cheeks burning. \u201cI\u2019ve overstayed my welcome.\u201d \u201cOf course you haven\u2019t,\u201d Michael said, standing up. \u201cI\u2019m a night owl. I just don\u2019t want you to miss the last bus.\u201d I zipped my coat, busily grabbed my bag, and started to put the papers in it. \u201cBecause you\u2019re going to take the bus, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Michael said into the silence. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to take me up on my offer of a ride.\u201d \u201cI know it\u2019s weird,\u201d I said. \u201cI just . . .\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d He put his car coat back on. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u201cWalking you to the bus stop.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d He looked amused. \u201cYou, of all people, are going to tell me that?\u201d It was cold out, the air full of the promise of oncoming winter, but for once it wasn\u2019t raining. I zipped my collar all the way up as we walked. There was no one else at the bus stop. The lights of the houses and apartment buildings glowed yellow in the night, a reminder that although this was a lonely spot, there were people nearby. I had no desire to live outside the city, in the unbroken darkness, where there was no one around. I needed the lights and noise of people, even if I wasn\u2019t talking to them. I turned to find Michael looking at me. How was he this handsome? Even his jawline was nice. Since when did I ogle men\u2019s jawlines? That wasn\u2019t like me. Then again, maybe it was. I didn\u2019t think. For once, I didn\u2019t drive myself crazy. I just leaned up, put my hands on his shoulders, and kissed him. His lips were soft, his skin faintly rough with stubble. He kissed me back, not even hesitating, before he put his arms around my waist and pulled me closer. He deepened the kiss, running his hands up my back, and my body started to hum in a way I hadn\u2019t felt in years, or maybe ever. Everything got warm, even in the damp cold of a fall night in Oregon. I was pressed up against him like it was the most natural thing in the world. Then, as we heard the bus pull up, he broke the kiss and stroked his fingers gently through my hair. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said. \u201cBe safe.\u201d I nodded, pulled reluctantly away, and got on the bus. My skin was prickling, and my lips were still warm. I sat down and stared ahead, my bag in my lap. I could still taste him. Slowly I came back to myself. I watched Claire Lake out the window, the lights going by, and my phone pinged with a text. It was from Beth Greer. It was a photo. An old one, black and white, a picture of two teenage girls sitting on the sofa in the Greer mansion\u2014the exact same sofa where Beth had sat every time I interviewed her. One of the girls was Beth, aged around thirteen. The other girl was Lily. Both girls were wearing sweaters and wool skirts. There was a Christmas tree out of focus behind them. Beth was easily recognizable, even though this photo was from so long ago\u2014her cheekbones, her lips, her large dark eyes. She was leaned in toward her sister, a smile on her face that was tentative and yet so hopeful it was a little heartbreaking. This was Beth when she still thought that things might work out somehow. Beth when she still had two living\u2014if unhappy\u2014parents. Beth who was in the middle of the much-looked-forward-to yearly visit from her sister, who was obediently posing for a Christmas photo taken\u2014obviously\u2014by Mariana. Lily, two years older, was blond. She sat upright, her hands folded on her lap, her shoulders straight, her chin angled just so. She looked straight at the camera with eyes that were dark like Mariana\u2019s. Her face was narrower than Beth\u2019s, her lips thinner, but the girls were so clearly related\u2014it was in the set of their bodies, their cheekbones, their identical hands. But Lily sat more confidently, and her smile only played at the corners of her mouth. It didn\u2019t reach her eyes, which were curiously flat as she looked at the photographer\u2014her mother. Another text came after the photo. I thought you might like this, Beth wrote. It\u2019s Christmas 1967. Sweet and bitter, I thought, looking at Lily and remembering the article about Lawrence Gage, shot in the face in his own home. Remembering that Julian Greer was about to die the same way a few years later. I wanted to reach back through the doorway of this photo and\u2014what? Stop Lily? Change everything? Save Julian\u2019s and maybe Mariana\u2019s lives? I put my phone away. I didn\u2019t answer Beth. I didn\u2019t have to. She knew I\u2019d seen the picture, and she\u2019d probably guessed every thought that went through my head as I stared at it. She knew she had me as obsessed as ever. Be careful, Michael had said. Be safe. The sweet girl in that photo had stood by and done nothing after her father was killed, after her mother somehow died in the fallout, after two men were shot point-blank on their way home from work. She had known who the killer was, and she had done nothing about it. She had even gone to trial for capital murder to cover her sister\u2019s crimes. Why? I wondered. What was so compelling about Lily Knowles that would make Beth go to such lengths to protect her? What if I found out Esther was a murderer? What would I do? The right thing, of course. I\u2019d do the right thing. But I didn\u2019t know what that was anymore. Maybe I had never known. \n CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN Excerpt from trial transcript, People v. Elizabeth Greer, February 1978 Prosecution examination of Dr. Oliver Da Sousa, psychiatrist CHARLES MANKOWSKI (prosecuting attorney): Dr. Da Sousa, did you examine the defendant, Miss Greer? OLIVER DA SOUSA: I did not. MANKOWSKI: But you have given advice on other cases similar to this one? DA SOUSA: Yes, I have worked extensively with the criminally insane, including women who are criminally insane. MANKOWSKI: What were your conclusions when presented with the facts of this case? DA SOUSA: In my opinion, these murders were committed by a woman who is mentally ill, possibly delusional, and has a pathological hatred of men. RANSOM WELLS (defense attorney): Objection. JUDGE HEIDNIK: Overruled. I\u2019ll allow it for now. Dr. Da Sousa, please continue. MANKOWSKI: Thank you, Your Honor. Dr. Da Sousa, you were saying that the murderer in this case is mentally ill. DA SOUSA: Yes. It is my assessment that this person, this woman, has violent tendencies brought on by fantasies in her mind. She is dissociative, sociopathic, and possibly psychotic. MANKOWSKI: How would such a person appear to the people around her? Would she appear as normal? WELLS: Objection. [Disruption in courtroom] JUDGE HEIDNIK: Order. WELLS: Objection. [Disruption ceases] JUDGE HEIDNIK: I will allow the question since it calls on the doctor\u2019s expertise. Dr. Da Sousa, please continue again. DA SOUSA: Okay. Thank you. Yes, such a person can appear as normal to the people in their lives. They can even appear to be successful and charming when they choose to. It\u2019s a form of camouflage for them. But underneath the surface, this woman would be very angry, would feel out of control. MANKOWSKI: Have you studied Miss Greer, and this case, even though you haven\u2019t examined her directly? DA SOUSA: Yes, I have. MANKOWSKI: And what is your conclusion? DA SOUSA: Given that both of her parents died violently, Miss Greer, or such a person like her, could be dissociative. Possibly even sociopathic. It could have started from an early age. WELLS: Objection. JUDGE HEIDNIK: Sustained. The jury is asked to disregard that question and answer. MANKOWSKI: Okay, we\u2019ll return to the woman who committed these murders. Dr. Da Sousa, you have said that it\u2019s your professional opinion that this murderer, whoever she is, could appear normal? DA SOUSA: Yes. In fact, it\u2019s likely, since both of her victims found her harmless enough to approach her. MANKOWSKI: Does such a woman feel remorse for what she\u2019s done? DA SOUSA: No, she does not. MANKOWSKI: So she may not stop killing, then. She may be dangerous to others. DA SOUSA: It is very likely that she will continue to kill more people, yes. Such a woman is very dangerous. Excerpt from cross-examination the following day: RANSOM WELLS (defense attorney): Dr. Da Sousa, do you have an explanation for the fact that the notes found with the victims have been compared to Beth Greer\u2019s handwriting and have been found not to be a match? DA SOUSA: I do not. WELLS: Do you have an explanation for the fact that no physical evidence has been found to connect either of these crimes to Miss Greer? DA SOUSA: I do not. WELLS: Do you have an explanation for the fact that you told your colleague Dr. Anderson Jermyn that Beth Greer was, and I quote, \u201csexy as hell and probably a slut\u201d? [Disruption in courtroom] JUDGE HEIDNIK: Order. Order. MANKOWSKI: Your honor, I object and ask that that last question be struck from the record. JUDGE HEIDNIK: Overruled. Order. [Disruption ceases] WELLS: I apologize for the crude language, Doctor, but it was a direct quote. Do you need me to repeat the question? DA SOUSA: That was spoken in confidence. WELLS: Please answer the question. Do you have an explanation? DA SOUSA: No, I do not. Prosecution examination of Detective Joshua Black, Claire Lake Police Department CHARLES MANKOWSKI (prosecuting attorney): Detective Black, what would you say Miss Greer\u2019s demeanor was when you and Detective Washington first interviewed her? BLACK: I\u2019m not sure what you mean. MANKOWSKI: For example, would you describe her as hysterical? BLACK: No, I would not. MANKOWSKI: Would you describe her as calm? BLACK: I think that would describe it, yes. She was calm. MANKOWSKI: When you and Detective Washington came to her door to request an interview, was Miss Greer surprised to see you? RANSOM WELLS: Objection. The witness cannot judge the defendant\u2019s state of mind. MANKOWSKI: It\u2019s a valid question, Your Honor. I am asking an experienced detective to give his expert impression of events. JUDGE HEIDNIK: I\u2019ll allow it this once, but please stick to factual questions going forward, Mr. Mankowski. MANKOWSKI: Thank you, Your Honor. Detective Black, please answer the question. Was Miss Greer surprised that the police had come to interview her? BLACK: I don\u2019t know. MANKOWSKI: You don\u2019t know what surprise looks like? BLACK: I didn\u2019t ask her if she was surprised, so I can\u2019t answer that question. MANKOWSKI: I see. I\u2019ll stick to factual observations, then. When you came to her door with Detective Washington and during that first interview, did Miss Greer weep? BLACK: No, she did not. MANKOWSKI: Did she struggle or act hysterical? BLACK: No. MANKOWSKI: Did she ask what this was about, what was going on? BLACK: I think it was pretty clear what was going on. The police were asking to speak with her. MANKOWSKI: Please answer the question. Did Beth Greer ask what was going on? BLACK: No, she did not ask us that. MANKOWSKI: Did she request a lawyer? BLACK: In that first interview, no, she did not. MANKOWSKI: Did Beth Greer comply and answer your questions in that first interview? BLACK: Yes, for the first part. MANKOWSKI: And what happened after the first part? BLACK: It\u2019s in the recording and the transcript. She got up and left. MANKOWSKI: Did Beth Greer seem like she was taking this seriously? BLACK: I have no idea if she was taking it seriously. I assume she was. RANSOM WELLS: Objection, Your Honor. JUDGE HEIDNIK: Sustained. The jury is asked to disregard that question and answer. MANKOWSKI: I\u2019ll ask one more factual question. Did Beth Greer use angry profanity in that first interview? BLACK: It was a stressful situation. MANKOWSKI: Please answer the question. BLACK: I don\u2019t\u2014 RANSOM WELLS: Objection, Your Honor. JUDGE HEIDNIK: This is factual, so I\u2019ll allow it. MANKOWSKI: Please answer the question, Detective. We can all hear the recording and read the transcript, but I\u2019d like your answer. Did Beth Greer use profanity when you interviewed her? BLACK: Yes, she did. MANKOWSKI: Can you please read this line from the interview transcript? Right there. BLACK: Here? MANKOWSKI: Yes, you can see it clearly. This line here. BLACK: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, you idiot. I wasn\u2019t in that fucking car.\u201d \n CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT February 1978 BETH Beth sat in the courtroom for the whole thing, watching. By then, she was so numb that it didn\u2019t seem real. This was happening to someone else, on TV or in the movies. Ransom brought her clothes\u2014blouses, skirts hemmed below the knee, pumps\u2014and Beth wore them. She tied her hair at the back of her neck and wore makeup, but not too much. Her job was to sit in silence and not speak. Ransom didn\u2019t put her on the stand. No offense, he\u2019d said, but that would be the height of idiocy. So no goddamned way are you getting up there. Ransom rarely swore. There was a motion from the press to have the trial televised. Ransom fought it and won. Beth was relieved, though not because she wanted privacy or had any fear of a media circus. Nothing could be said about her that was worse than what had been said already. No, what she was afraid of was Lily watching the entire thing on TV. She\u2019d absorb every word, every gesture, just like everyone else would. She would relish the chaos she\u2019d caused. She\u2019d make fun of Beth\u2019s outfits, laugh in front of the TV. Beth didn\u2019t want Lily to know exactly how confused everyone was, how incredibly wrong they had it. She didn\u2019t want to give Lily the satisfaction. She didn\u2019t want Lily to see the testimony about the dangerous, psychotic woman who had done this, and possibly get angry. And she didn\u2019t want Lily to see Detective Black. He looked as handsome as ever on the stand, wearing a dark blue suit and a wide blue tie. He\u2019d had a haircut, and she missed the slightly too-long look he usually had. With his hair cut short, he looked more like a cop, though there were faint lines around the edges of his eyes and he looked painfully uncomfortable. He kept his gaze trained on the prosecutor, Charles Mankowski, and never looked at her, but she could feel his awareness of her all the same. Halfway through his testimony, Ransom shifted in his seat and wrote something on his notepad, angling it so she could see. Hostile, the note said. Black was supposed to be a witness for the prosecution, but he was deflecting Mankowski, not following the script. Beth had listened to enough of Ransom\u2019s wisdom by now to know that this was a problem for Mankowski, to have one of his own witnesses disagreeing with him. Sure enough, the next thing Ransom wrote was: This is good. Beth raised her gaze back to the witness stand again. Black was answering about whether she had taken it seriously when she was questioned, and Ransom stood to object. The judge answered, and for a second Black turned her way and their eyes met. He looked and sounded cool when he answered questions, but in that brief look Beth could see that he was miserable and torn. I have to say all of this, that look told her. I can\u2019t say anything else, because you didn\u2019t give me anything. He knew she hadn\u2019t murdered anyone. He knew that whoever had shot those men in the face was still out there, maybe about to shoot someone else. But he had no proof, no evidence, no trail to follow, and it was killing him. Mankowski went back to murdering Beth\u2019s character, asking whether she\u2019d used profanity. It was so stupid she would have laughed if her life weren\u2019t on the line. Black answered, though he didn\u2019t want to. It\u2019s okay, she telegraphed to him, even though he wasn\u2019t looking at her. I\u2019m not mad. She realized for the first time, watching him, that she was looking at probably the only good person she\u2019d ever met in her life. A person who got up every morning actually wanting to right wrongs, a person who wasn\u2019t out to serve himself or get rich or check out with alcohol and drugs when things got too hard. Someone who was going to marry a kindergarten teacher and have nice kids and actually be a good father. The only person in her life who hadn\u2019t lied when he\u2019d told her he was trying to help her. He really had tried. If she\u2019d given him Lily, handed her over to him, it would have been the best gift he\u2019d ever been given. It would have put all of his questions and doubts to rest, and he would have known he was bringing a true murderer to justice. But if they had no evidence against Beth, then they had no evidence against Lily, either. No gun, no fingerprints, no way to prove she was there or even in town. If Beth could slip away from this, slide her neck out of the noose, then so could Lily. The difference was that once Lily was free again, she\u2019d start to think about killing. She\u2019d start planning something bad. And if Beth made Detective Black Lily\u2019s enemy, he\u2019d be dead before he could see what was coming. Even if she warned him. No one would listen to her warnings about Lily. That, she already knew. Black\u2019s testimony ended. Ransom declined to cross-examine him, not wanting to trample on Mankowski\u2019s disaster, wanting to leave the memory of that hostile witness in the jury\u2019s minds. Black was dismissed and left the stand as well as the courtroom. Everyone was watching. Beth kept her gaze ahead of her, on nothing, her expression blank and slightly bored, as if Detective Black meant nothing to her. She didn\u2019t have to watch him to know that he didn\u2019t look at her, either. There was nothing for anyone to see. Even Ransom was making quick notes to himself, not looking at Black leaving the room. Without anyone seeing, her knight had tilted at windmills for her as much as he could, and now it was over. She was alone. Beth looked at nothing as the courtroom buzzed quietly around her, and thought, What will I do if I get out of here? Two weeks later, she was acquitted. The jury had deliberated for four days. They gave her her things back, had her sign papers. Made her wait in one room, then another. She knew this was a monumental moment, that everything was changing yet again, but all she could think was that she was incredibly hungry and she wanted a drink. She wondered if Ransom would give her money for a hamburger, or whether she had her own money again. She wondered where Lily was. There was no way her sister was missing this. She probably wasn\u2019t far. Ransom eventually came to get her. This was a triumphant day for him. \u201cThere\u2019s a sea of media outside,\u201d he warned her. He looked her over. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing that?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Beth said, adjusting the red shawl around her shoulders that she\u2019d bought at the Edengate Mall. She\u2019d had Ransom bring it to her in a suitcase, along with a list of other clothes. It was over. She never had to go back to her jail cell, never had to eat that food or talk on that awful phone. There was a liquor cabinet at the Greer mansion that had been fully stocked the day she\u2019d been arrested. She knew it wasn\u2019t possible, but if she inhaled the scent of the red shawl, if she concentrated on it, she thought she could smell her mother. She put on Mariana\u2019s red lipstick, too. Then she left to face the reporters. \n CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE October 2017 SHEA \u201cThe question is,\u201d the voice in my ear asked, \u201cwhat makes a killer? Are killers born, or are they made? Can they be stopped, or are they simply a human anomaly, a genetic gamble? Maybe the killing itself is buried deep in his psyche, waiting for the chance to come out. Or maybe the would-be murderer can be saved, the course of his life changed. Maybe it\u2019s happened a million times, and because he never killed anyone, we never knew it was possible.\u201d I pulled my earbuds out. I was listening to a podcast this time instead of an audiobook as I sat in the break room at work. The half-eaten remains of my sandwich sat on the table in front of me. Karen poked her head around the door, an annoyed look on her face. \u201cLunch break is over, Shea.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d I said, pushing my chair back. I was lost in a fog today, forgetting details, not listening. I had to keep it together, come out of the dark into my real life. I needed this job. I had bills to pay. I couldn\u2019t think about murder all the time. I dumped my food into the garbage and came back out to the front of the doctor\u2019s office, taking my seat behind the Plexiglas. There were six people in the waiting room, reading or talking softly or, in one case, napping. It was quiet and stuffy. For the first time, I realized that Esther was right about this job: I was literally spending all of my life in a waiting room. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet,\u201d Karen said. \u201cThe doctor was reviewing patient files this morning. You can put them away while I take my lunch.\u201d She nodded to a cart, then turned to grab her lunch bag and leave. As she did, the cart jostled and a stack of files fell to the ground. I got off my chair and squatted, picking up the files as Karen walked away. I had one in my hand when I realized it was Beth\u2019s. Karen had left, and there was no one who could see me. I was crouched on the floor behind the desk, out of sight of everyone, out of sight of the security cameras that kept watch on the waiting room. I had maybe ten seconds. It was like the kiss with Michael\u2014I didn\u2019t even think. I flipped open the file and looked at the top page, scanning it. I read the diagnosis, the notes from the doctor. The analysis of the test results. Oh, Beth, I thought. There\u2019s a reason behind everything Beth does, Ransom Wells had said. Ask yourself why Beth has decided to tell everything now, after all of these years. I closed the file, stacked it with the others, and put them away, my mind circling over what I\u2019d just read. When Karen came back from her lunch break, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t feel well.\u201d She looked me over. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good.\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019m feverish.\u201d I gathered my things, put on my sweater. This was a doctor\u2019s office; the last thing we were supposed to do was spread illness to the patients. \u201cI\u2019ll go home and go to bed.\u201d She shrugged and turned away as a patient came to the window. I left the office and stood on the sidewalk. What I\u2019d just read in the file was still going around in my mind, but it also seemed off. It had something to do with why Beth had agreed to talk to me, but it wasn\u2019t the only reason. There had to be something else. I pulled out my phone and opened my email, scrolling back for the message from Michael about the Linwood Street property records. I had a gut feeling I was missing something, a detail that was an important piece of the puzzle. Maybe it was buried in the past, in the property records. I stopped scrolling when I saw the Google alert that had come into my inbox days ago. It was an alert I\u2019d had for years, set to deliver me anything to do with crime in Claire Lake, in case there was a juicy story I could use for the Book of Cold Cases. There was so little crime here that I didn\u2019t get an alert very often. I\u2019d forgotten about this one almost as soon as it came in, and it was still unopened. Feeling something strange in the pit of my gut, I opened it. It was a news article scraped from the Claire Lake Weekly Press, one of the few newspapers\u2014if you could call it that\u2014left after the gutting of local media over the past twenty years. It usually focused on upcoming street festivals and farmers\u2019 markets, mixed with laconic paragraphs about the occasional break-in and bicycle theft. Any darker crimes that happened in Claire Lake\u2014domestic violence, drug overdoses\u2014were ignored, as if they never happened at all. The Weekly Press had reported this story because its air of mystery was of the safe, cozy kind that wouldn\u2019t upset the tourists too much. The underpaid stringer who wrote it had done the usual bare minimum for his tiny fee: UNIDENTIFIED REMAINS WILL UNDERGO DNA TESTING Human remains, possibly several decades old, were found near the east shore of Claire Lake by two children playing in the woods last month, according to the Claire Lake Police Department. The remains were found on the uninhabited side of the lake in early September. They were in a state of advanced decomposition, and only a few parts were recovered. \u201cWe do not yet know who this person is,\u201d said Officer Martin Furlong of the Claire Lake PD in a statement. \u201cThere are no residences near where the body was found. It appears to be a hiker who possibly got lost, or it is a body that was left there by someone unknown.\u201d Asked if the body could be the victim of a crime, Officer Furlong replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet, and given the state of the remains, we may never know. That\u2019s up to the coroner.\u201d County coroner Tamara Li has stated that the remains are those of a Caucasian woman who has been dead anywhere from 25 to 45 years. She was in her mid-20s when she died. The coroner\u2019s office is not releasing any other details, but they have confirmed that the remains are being tested for DNA to help narrow down who the woman might be. Asked for a cause of death for the unknown woman, the coroner\u2019s office declined to comment. It\u2019s possible that no cause of death is able to be determined with remains that old. Police are trying to match the body to missing persons reports, and anyone who may have information on the unidentified woman is asked to call the Claire Lake Police Department. It was right there, in my inbox: the reason Beth Greer had agreed to talk to me, to have the entire story come out right now. Lily had been found. I knew it as surely as I knew my own name. That was Lily, out there in the woods at the edge of the lake. They would run the DNA, and then\u2014what? There had been no DNA testing in 1977, but Beth\u2019s blood and saliva could have been taken when she was arrested. Or maybe they\u2019d find another connection through her family tree. They might not connect the body to Beth tomorrow, or next week, or next month, but they would connect it sooner or later. And Beth knew it. I sent the article to Michael with the message: I want to know everything about this. I started for the bus stop, my feet moving slowly at first, then faster. It was starting to make sense now, this crazy story. But there were still pieces missing. Pieces I had no choice but to find. I\u2019d gone this far; it was time to go the rest of the way. Before the bus arrived, I did one last thing: I called Esther\u2019s cell phone. She answered on the second ring. \u201cShea? Is everything okay?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you,\u201d I said. \u201cI know you\u2019re working.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d Because she knew something was the matter. She always knew. \u201cI just wanted to tell you,\u201d I said to my sister, \u201cI met this woman. She was acquitted of murder forty years ago. No one has ever been sure if she\u2019s innocent. She agreed to do an interview with me. I\u2019ve been talking to her for weeks now.\u201d \u201cAlone?\u201d Esther sounded alarmed. \u201cYes. I thought it would be fine. She\u2019s been telling me things. Some of it might be lies, but I think most of it is the truth. I don\u2019t think she did the murders, but I think what really happened might be worse. There are ghosts in her house that terrify me. And I met Michael, my private detective, face-to-face for the first time, and I kissed him. The second time, not the first time. And I got a cat by accident. His name is Winston Purrchill.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Esther said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve had a lot going on, too,\u201d I said. \u201cThings I haven\u2019t been telling you. You said I\u2019ve been so far away, and I know that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t want to be far away anymore. I want to tell you everything. If you have a baby, I want to be part of it, as much as you\u2019ll let me. You\u2019re my best friend. If you called me and told me to get you a U-Haul and some garbage bags again, I\u2019d do it. I\u2019d do it as many times as you asked me to.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d There was a pause, and I knew Esther was crying. \u201cOh, Shea. Of course you\u2019ll be part of it. You\u2019re my best friend, too. But I worry about you. This thing you\u2019re involved with sounds dangerous. You need to walk away from it. You need to let it go.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d People were passing me on the sidewalk, ignoring me. The bus was coming. \u201cI have to see it to the end.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t. I don\u2019t like the sound of it. I can rescue you this time, Shea. Let me do it.\u201d I shook my head, even though she couldn\u2019t see me. \u201cI can finish this. I have to. And then I\u2019m going to change things, Esther. I promise.\u201d I hung up before I could change my mind and beg my big sister to come get me and fix everything. Right away, my phone rang. Michael. I answered it. \u201cDid you get my message?\u201d \u201cIs this what I think it is?\u201d He sounded excited. \u201cIf you mean Lily, then yes. It\u2019s her.\u201d The bus pulled up, and the doors opened. I got on, my phone still to my ear. \u201cI\u2019ll call my contacts,\u201d Michael said. \u201cOne of them will know something. The coroner likely has a theory about cause of death. She just didn\u2019t share it with the press.\u201d \u201cI want to know if Beth\u2019s blood or saliva was taken in 1977. If it wasn\u2019t, I can get you a sample.\u201d I thought about the glass Beth drank from, her grapefruit juice and soda. Maybe it was still sitting on the table. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d Michael said. \u201cWhere are you right now?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to the Greer mansion.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to talk to her?\u201d \u201cNo. She isn\u2019t there.\u201d That had been in the file I\u2019d read. \u201cShe\u2019s in Portland for a medical test. She won\u2019t be back until tomorrow.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019re going to\u2014what? Break in? That isn\u2019t a good idea, Shea.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to get answers. I\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t call the police. I don\u2019t plan to steal anything, I promise.\u201d \u201cJesus, Shea\u2014\u201d \u201cShe has an aneurysm,\u201d I said. I could lose my job for telling him, but I didn\u2019t care anymore. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, and it\u2019s inoperable. If it bursts, she dies. She could die tomorrow, or she could live another decade. There\u2019s no way to know.\u201d \u201cMy God. So that\u2019s part of the reason she decided to talk now.\u201d \u201cBut not why she chose me.\u201d I stared out the window of the bus as Claire Lake went by. \u201cI still don\u2019t know why she chose me. I\u2019ll be fine, Michael. I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m out of there.\u201d I didn\u2019t give him a chance to answer. I hung up the phone, turned it off, and watched Claire Lake recede beneath me as the bus climbed to Arlen Heights. \n CHAPTER FORTY October 1977 BETH She was looking for Lily. It wasn\u2019t the first time. Over the years, during the periods Lily had vanished, Beth had sometimes hired a private detective to look for her. She\u2019d paid out of the money left to her after Julian died. But it was always fruitless, because when Lily wanted to vanish, she\u2019d simply vanished. Still, Beth had looked. When Lily vanished again after Mariana died, she\u2019d looked. And when she felt that her sister was close\u2014with the same dreamlike certainty she\u2019d had years ago, looking at Lily\u2019s footprints in the dewy grass\u2014she\u2019d even get in her car and drive around Claire Lake, wondering if she\u2019d see Lily at the next stoplight, around the next corner. Lily was close now. Beth could feel it, but that wasn\u2019t why she was driving tonight. She was driving because Lily had killed a man. He\u2019d been left on the side of the road. Shot in the face, like Julian. But this man wasn\u2019t someone Lily knew. She\u2019d chosen someone random, and she\u2019d left a note: Am I bitter or am I sweet? Ladies can be either. Lily had gone into her clock tower at last. Beth had gotten a phone call four months ago, after Lily had been gone for well over a year. I\u2019m in a hospital, Lily had said, the line crackling. They don\u2019t know my real name. I don\u2019t have any identification. I want to get out of here, Beth. I need you to come and get me. Please. Please. Was it the truth? There was always that question with Lily, but Beth hadn\u2019t cared. She\u2019d felt numb at the sound of Lily\u2019s voice, followed by scathing relief that wherever Lily was, she might be locked up in a hospital. Thank God someone is looking after her so I don\u2019t have to, Beth had thought. Someone is keeping her from hurting people. It could have been a lie to get Beth\u2019s sympathy and, more importantly, her money, but something in Lily\u2019s voice told Beth it might not be. For the first time in Beth\u2019s life, Lily actually sounded worried about something. In fact, by the end of the call, as she heard the hopelessness in Beth\u2019s voice, she\u2019d begged. Get me out of here. Please, Beth. Please. \u2014 Beth drove downtown. Lily wouldn\u2019t have much money, so she would have to find a cheap room to rent. Beth started with Claire Lake\u2019s cheapest motels, then the YWCA. Have you seen this woman? She used one of the only photos she had of Lily, from their last Christmas together. It was ridiculously out-of-date, but Lily hated to have her picture taken, and Beth didn\u2019t have anything more recent. Lily Knowles? she asked at place after place. Veronica Jenshak? Amy McMaster? She tried the aliases she knew, but no one recognized them, or the photo. So Beth got back into her father\u2019s Buick and thought again. Lily was here; she was sure of it. She also knew that Lily expected Beth to be looking for her. The note left with that man\u2019s body had been so clear. Lily wanted Beth to panic, to find her, to stop her. To Lily, it was a game. Get me out of here. Please, Beth. Please, Lily had said in that phone call four months ago. And Beth had said, No. She didn\u2019t know what had landed Lily in a mental hospital, and she hadn\u2019t asked. What had mattered was that Lily was locked up, looked after, unable to hurt anyone. Beth had hung up the phone with a sense of relief. Lily wasn\u2019t her problem anymore. And for a while, she wasn\u2019t. But now this. Wherever she\u2019d been, Lily was free. Beth rubbed the hangover from behind her eyes and tried to make herself think, but she was so tired. This was her fault. She should have found out what hospital Lily was in, made sure she stayed there forever so that no one else would die. She should have done . . . something. Anything. Think, Beth, think. Where else would someone go when they had no money? Then she knew. The houseboats on the piers\u2014the eyesore of Claire Lake. If there was a room to rent on one of those ratty old boats, it would be the perfect spot. Beth drove the Buick to the piers and got out, tying her trench coat more tightly in the chill wind. The third boat was the winner. Lily had used her Veronica Jenshak name and rented a room, an impossibly small sliver of space, for cash. She\u2019d packed her bag and left only an hour ago. Beth searched the empty room, flipping the mattress on the bunk and looking in the meager cupboard, swearing to herself because she already knew she\u2019d find nothing. The landlady could describe her sister\u2019s car, though: a blue Pinto with rust on the back bumper. I\u2019m coming for you, Lily, Beth thought as she got into her father\u2019s expensive Buick and started it again. Drive fast, because I\u2019m coming. She knew her sister. Lily had left the houseboat for good\u2014stiffing the landlady on part of the rent\u2014and wasn\u2019t coming back to the piers. She was out cruising, hunting somewhere, but Beth didn\u2019t think Lily had left town yet. She bought a bottle of wine and kept driving. The sun was setting. The dead man had been shot after leaving work. Would Lily try the same tactic again? Beth scanned the slowly emptying streets of downtown. She saw a blue Pinto and followed it for half a mile before she could catch a glimpse of the driver, who wasn\u2019t Lily. Then she circled back to downtown. The first bottle of wine was almost finished, so she bought a second one. She ended up on the edge of Claire Lake, on a side road no one used. She got out of the car, listening to the silence over the water. Lily was here somewhere. Beth was half-drunk, and the wine flushed her with grief and anger, sadness and an almost unbearable ache. She was all-powerful, and she was a speck of insignificance. She knew everything and nothing at once. Alcohol always did this to her in the beginning\u2014it was why she loved it so much. There was a flash of headlights at the other end of the lake, through the trees. Beth had gotten back into the car and was about to slam the door when she heard a crack echoing across the dark, empty water, like a firework. Or a gunshot. She put the car into gear and reversed up the path to the main road. She drove fast, the Buick slicing up and down over ruts. Did I really hear that? Her thoughts spun wildly. Did I? She thought she heard another crack\u2014or was that the car? She careened around one turn, then another, coming out onto Claire Lake Road. There was a car pulled over ahead, the engine running, the headlights on. A second car was pulling away as Beth turned the corner. It was a blue Pinto. She made a snap decision and stopped next to the car that was pulled over. She opened her door and put one foot out to get out, to help whoever it was. She froze. It was already over. A man was dead on the ground. And his face . . . his face . . . Beth went cold. I\u2019m too late. I need to run. I need to catch her. Beth got back in the Buick and put it into gear, speeding up onto the road, looking for the fading taillights of the Pinto. And behind her, a man walking his dog came out of the trees and watched her go before he ran for the nearest phone. \n CHAPTER FORTY-ONE October 2017 SHEA The Greer mansion stood in shades of gray and white, like a tinted photograph. The wind had kicked up, cold and wet, though the rain hadn\u2019t started yet. There was no one around as I got off the bus and walked up the street, no cars going by, no one walking their dog. Arlen Heights was hushed and quiet. There was no car in the driveway. I stood facing the house, still wearing my work clothes and coat, my messenger bag strapped over my shoulder and across my chest. I took a minute to take in the swirling ugliness of the house, its pretension and clumsy lines and misery. An awful thing that was tolerated because it was made with money and pretended to have class. It\u2019s an abomination that shouldn\u2019t exist, Lily had said, according to Beth. That\u2019s why I like it. I pulled out my phone and turned it on. I ignored all of the missed texts and messages from Michael, from my sister. I called Beth. \u201cI\u2019m at your house,\u201d I said when she answered. \u201cI know,\u201d Beth said. \u201cHow do you know when you\u2019re in Portland?\u201d \u201cSo you looked at my file,\u201d Beth said. \u201cI wondered if you would. I admire you for it. It\u2019s what I would have done if I were you.\u201d \u201cHow did you know I\u2019m at your house?\u201d \u201cI have a motion sensor that triggers whenever someone comes up the driveway. I\u2019d like to know if someone is going to burn the house down. That way I can cheer them on.\u201d I scanned the front of the house. \u201cAre there cameras?\u201d \u201cLily smashed all the cameras a long time ago. I never tried again.\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like her picture taken,\u201d I said. \u201cShe never did. That photo I sent you is one of the only ones I have of her. Lily didn\u2019t like to see herself on camera.\u201d \u201cMaybe they can do a computer reconstruction of her face,\u201d I said. \u201cThat is, if they found her skull.\u201d There was a long moment of silence on the other end of the line. \u201cOh, Shea,\u201d Beth said, and her voice was impossible to interpret. \u201cI see you\u2019ve been paying attention.\u201d \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I shouted into the phone. \u201cI stopped her.\u201d In front of me, a light went on in the upstairs of the Greer mansion, where no one was home. \u201cYou stopped her?\u201d I said. \u201cYes. No police with their burden of proof. No trials and no lawyers. No more hospitals that didn\u2019t fix her, then let her out again. I stopped her. Me. Because I was responsible, and I always had been. I was responsible for every single death, just like you\u2019ve felt responsible ever since you escaped your abductor\u2019s car.\u201d That was an unexpected punch to the gut. Because she was right\u2014I did feel responsible. It made no sense, but guilt doesn\u2019t have to. It simply exists, weighing you down and choking you until you can\u2019t breathe anymore. Another light went on in the house, this one on the other side, the light beaming out of the window and glowing on the leaves of the trees. It should have been a comforting sight, but it wasn\u2019t. I watched the light go on downstairs in the living room. The lights in the house were getting brighter, the white glow blasting through the windows and into the lowering gloom. My cheeks were numb now, and so were my hands, the hand holding my phone so cold I couldn\u2019t feel where my fingertips touched the plastic. The wind grew sharper, and the first splatter of rain hit my skin, harsh and cold. \u201cHow did you do it, Beth?\u201d I asked. \u201cHow did you kill her?\u201d \u201cYou have so many questions,\u201d Beth said. \u201cGo ask her. She\u2019ll tell you.\u201d Lily was in there, lighting up the windows and wandering the halls. If I went in, it would just be her and me. Then again, maybe that was what I\u2019d come here for. To talk to Lily alone. As if someone knew what I was thinking, the front door of the Greer mansion opened with a click. It swung wide, the light spilling onto the front porch. She was inviting me in. I knew I shouldn\u2019t go. I wondered if she\u2019d kill me. I wondered if she\u2019d try. I wouldn\u2019t let her. Lily didn\u2019t get to kill everyone. \u201cYou may as well do it,\u201d Beth Greer said in my ear. \u201cShe wants you to, and you know you aren\u2019t going to say no.\u201d \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat I want is for this to be over. I want to stop doing penance. It\u2019s time for the real story to come out, and you\u2019re the one to tell it. If you have the guts.\u201d I looked at the house. What was I going to do? Go home? Lock my doors and hide, like I\u2019d been doing for twenty years? Spend the rest of my life in hiding? If I did that, what would I have to live for? What kind of life had I chosen since that cold winter day when I was nine? \u201cScrew it,\u201d I said to Beth, and I hung up the phone. I dropped it in my bag and walked to the front door, not giving myself time to think. I\u2019d been thinking too long, too hard. I\u2019d done nothing but think. Where had it gotten me? I stepped through the door expecting to be blinded by the bright light inside, but the Greer mansion looked the same as always. It was dim and clean, untouched and faintly musty. I stepped into the corridor as the front door slammed shut behind me. \u201cLily?\u201d I said. There was no answer. I walked into the living room, taking in the burnt orange sofa, the squat coffee table with its angled legs, the shelf of awful figurines on the wall. The curtains on the windows were closed. The silence was oppressive, like someone was watching me. I turned toward the corridor, the stairs. I could go into the kitchen, but I didn\u2019t want to. There was a bad, coppery smell coming from there, and it made my stomach turn. I had the feeling that if I went into the kitchen, I\u2019d see something I didn\u2019t want to see. How had Beth ever come back into this house? Why didn\u2019t she tear it down, brick by brick? The stairs creaked under the soles of my sneakers as I climbed. I reached the landing and looked down the corridor. The upstairs hall was dim and silent, the doors closed. The quiet was so heavy it was a living thing, pressing into my skin and trying to push down my throat. I walked to the end of the hall to the last door\u2014the master bedroom. I pushed open the door and saw a king-sized oak bed, matching nightstands, large dressers, a wardrobe. There were ashtrays on the nightstands, a yellowed book next to one of them, and through the half-open closet door I could see the sleeve of a red dress. Beth sleeps here, I thought in horror. It was like a museum for a bygone era, for people who were long dead. The only sign that Beth lived in this room was the unmade bed and a tube of Sephora hand cream, the modern label jarring, like something in a dream. I walked to the closet and opened it. I recognized some of the clothes as Beth\u2019s, but there were polyester dresses in here, leopard-print blouses and cork-soled shoes. Mariana\u2019s clothes. Beth Greer lived like this, buried in her parents\u2019 belongings. She\u2019d lived like this all these years. This place was suffocating and dead. I could barely breathe in this closet; I had no idea why Beth had lived like this for so long. Why she\u2019d wanted to. Maybe she hadn\u2019t wanted to. I grabbed a handful of hangers from the closet, then another, then another. I dumped a pile of dresses on the bed\u2014silk, rayon, polyester. Gold, powder blue, fire-engine red. I opened a drawer in the dresser and found Mariana\u2019s old girdles and bras, her high-waisted underwear. I threw all of those on the bed, too. If Beth couldn\u2019t get rid of all of these things, then I would. I left the master bedroom and walked into the next room\u2014Beth\u2019s teenage room. It had a narrow bed with a checkered blanket. There was an expensive 1970s stereo in a cabinet with glass doors, a record player on top of it and a stack of records leaning against it on the floor, as if someone had just been riffling through them, choosing what to play. Gritting my teeth, I grabbed the records and threw them out into the hall, letting them crash to the floor. Peter Frampton, Neil Diamond, Fleetwood Mac. I opened the closet and found Beth\u2019s teenage clothes in here, jeans and wraparound flowered tops. I threw those into the hall with the records, letting them crumple off the hangers. It felt good to destroy this place, to rip open its wounds. It felt good to make the dust billow. If I could have drawn a deep breath, I would have screamed into the silence. I finished wrecking Beth\u2019s teenage room and walked back out into the hall. The door to the master bedroom was open. I walked to it and looked in. Everything I\u2019d torn out of the closet was back in its place. The room looked like I\u2019d never touched it. Fear clenched my stomach, and I understood. This wasn\u2019t Beth\u2019s house; it was Lily\u2019s. There was a cold breath on the back of my neck, and something smashed me into the wall. I hit the wall hard, the breath rushing out of me in surprise, and icy hands wound into my hair, pulling my head back. I did scream then, the sound ripping out of me. I was staring at the ceiling, my head pulled back by a hand I couldn\u2019t see. Something was breathing on me, its breath so cold I shuddered in repulsion. Look, it said. Still gripping my hair, the hands pushed me down the hall. The door on my right flew open. The door to Beth\u2019s childhood room. I struggled and screamed again, trying to twist out of the thing\u2019s grip, but it was impossible. I was shoved to the doorway, then through it. And as I stepped over the threshold, I wasn\u2019t in the Greer mansion anymore. \u2014 It was freezing. I was standing at the side of a road, looking around in the dark. Gravel crunched under my feet and the wind crept down my collar onto my neck. I could see the road, trees, and between the trees, the distant dark surface of a lake. I was at the edge of Claire Lake. A few feet from me, a car was pulled over\u2014a blue Pinto. The hood was popped open, and a woman stood in front of it, staring down into the guts of the car. Her blond hair obscured her face. Her hands were in the pockets of her wool coat. And then I knew: It was the night of October 15, 1977, and Lily Knowles was about to kill someone. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, but no one heard me. I wasn\u2019t here; I was in Beth\u2019s old bedroom. But then why could I taste the lake in the air, and why did I know exactly what was about to happen? There was the sound of a motor, the sweep of headlights, and the crunch of gravel. A man\u2019s voice called out: \u201cNeed some help?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said again, but even though I saw my breath plume into the night air, no one heard me. Lily looked up, and a smile flashed across her face as she saw the man. She was the girl from the Christmas photo, only now she was a grown woman, her face filled out and her body curved beneath her coat. Her blond hair was soft and gleaming, and her smile was on the edge of flirtatious. She was irresistible. Ransom Wells had said Lily made him want to crawl out of his skin, and right now, I could see it. There was nothing behind Lily\u2019s eyes\u2014nothing at all. \u201cSure,\u201d Lily said. \u201cI\u2019d love some help.\u201d I screamed, though still no one heard me. I lurched forward, trying to stop what was going to happen, but my hands hit glass. I banged on it, kicked it. Thomas Armstrong got out of his car and closed the door behind him, smiling at Lily. \u201cLet me help,\u201d he said. I screamed and screamed, banging on the glass. Lily turned toward him, her hands still in the pockets of her coat. She took a step on the roadside gravel in her black pumps. I could hear everything\u2014the slam of his car door, the gravel under their feet, the drone of a far-off car on the two-lane highway that crossed several hundred feet away. I could see Lily\u2019s hair lift from her neck in the damp wind, could see the thick mascara on her lashes and the dusting of light blue eyeshadow. She had pinkish gloss on her lips and blush on her cheekbones. Above her smile, her eyes were dark and cold as she took another step toward Armstrong, who was walking forward. Then she took her gloved hand out of her pocket. There were tears running down my face now. I banged my fists on the glass over and over, shouting \u201cNo,\u201d but I knew it would make no difference. It was October 15, 1977, and what was going to happen was going to happen. It was already done. I was still screaming when the gun went off twice. Still screaming and banging on the glass when Lily stepped over the body and dropped a note on it. Still screaming as she slammed the hood of her car, got in, and drove away. I leaned against the glass, my throat ragged. I was crying; I couldn\u2019t say why. Thomas Armstrong had been dead for forty years, and this was some kind of sick movie, a replay so Lily could torture me. I had to get out of here. I didn\u2019t want to be in this place, in this time. I took a step back, and I was standing in Beth\u2019s old bedroom, my hands on the glass of the window that looked out over the yard. My skin was cold and clammy, and my face was wet. I blinked my burning eyes and lifted my hands off the glass. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d I shouted into the silence. \u201cWhy did you show me that? I already know the ending.\u201d Behind me, footsteps came down the hall from the master bedroom, nearly at a run. A figure flashed past the doorway, and I glimpsed blond hair, much like Lily\u2019s. Except that wasn\u2019t Lily. I stepped out the door as the footsteps rushed down the stairs. \u201cNo,\u201d a voice said in soft panic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lily. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \u201cMariana?\u201d I called. I hurried down the stairs, following her. I didn\u2019t care that she\u2019d been dead for decades, that I was chasing a ghost. Her voice sounded terrified, almost ragged with pain. I caught sight of her in the front hallway, which was ice-cold. I descended the last step with my breath pluming from my mouth. Mariana Greer\u2014it was definitely Mariana, the woman I recognized from her wedding photograph\u2014was standing at the front door. She was in a silk negligee under a white bathrobe, her feet bare. Her hair was tied back with a headscarf, the kind women used to wear to bed to preserve their hairstyles, with her blond hair spilling out the back. In that moment, even though she had died in 1975, she was as real as I was. I could see the tears tracking down her face as she fumbled clumsily at the door. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere did you go, baby? Please don\u2019t leave. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d What had happened? An argument? Had Lily left? Why was no one trying to stop Mariana from leaving in her nightgown in the state she was in? \u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d I said, but she had figured out the lock now, and she was turning the knob. I lunged forward, thinking to hold the door closed, but nothing I did mattered. Mariana Greer opened the door and ran outside, heading for her car, trying to find her daughter. Heading for the accident that would kill her. I ran out the front door after her, but Mariana was gone. The cold, wet air hit me in the face. The sky was bleak and gray, as if someone had bleached it; the clouds were inky black. What time was it? What day was it? How long had I been in the house? I had to get out of here. I took a shaky breath and stepped onto the porch, and then I looked down. There were wet footprints here, the impressions of rubber sneakers. Had Mariana been wearing sneakers, or had her feet been bare? Who had been standing on the porch with wet shoes? The tracks led into the grass, which was tamped down where someone had walked on it. The droplets of rain were disturbed in a path leading toward the trees and around the house. Everything had been too strange for too long, and nothing mattered anymore. I stepped off the porch and walked onto the lawn, following the footprints through the trees. In a moment, the wet, stark, black trees thinned and the vista behind the house opened up in front of me, the bare grass, the drop, the gray sky. It had the same effect it always had: It was awful and hypnotic at the same time, like the view looking down from a great height. I wanted to walk toward it; I felt the draw. I made my feet stay still, and I locked my gaze with Lily Knowles\u2019s at last. She was standing in the middle of the lawn, her sneakered feet in the cold grass. She looked to be in her twenties; she had the narrow face I\u2019d seen in the Christmas photo with a few more years passed, though in person\u2014was this in person?\u2014she was more beautiful. She was wearing jeans and a coat of army green, and both items hung off her frame, as if she\u2019d either borrowed them from someone bigger or lost weight. Her blond hair was down around her shoulders, and it lifted in the wind as if she were really here. \u201cYou\u2019re finally here,\u201d Lily said. Her voice was unreal, an echo. And yet I knew it was her real voice, coming from wherever she was. And for a minute, I wasn\u2019t terrified. I was just standing on the lawn, looking at Lily Knowles, who was the reason I\u2019d come. She was the reason I\u2019d come from the beginning, though I hadn\u2019t known she existed at the time. \u201cYou died,\u201d I said to her. Lily, who wasn\u2019t real, who wasn\u2019t alive, shrugged in that way I instantly recognized from her half sister. It was the way I\u2019d learned to shrug, too: Maybe what you say is interesting, and maybe it isn\u2019t. \u201cEveryone dies,\u201d she said, her voice echoing. \u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m waiting for Beth, and she knows it.\u201d \u201cTell me why,\u201d I said, because I was looking at a serial killer, and I had no idea how much time I had. \u201cPlease, just tell me why.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no why,\u201d Lily said. \u201cThere\u2019s only what happened. There\u2019s only what I did.\u201d I shook my head. There had to be more. There had to be. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d The wind gusted up, hard and cold, and Lily held out her hand. She was standing a few feet away, out of reach, but I still felt the fear begin to grip me again as I looked at that hand. There was no way I was going to take it. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked her. \u201cYou came back here for a reason,\u201d Lily said. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cYes, you did.\u201d Her hand was still held out, and it held the same fascination and repulsion that the view over the drop had. I had the impulse to step toward it, and yet that was the last thing I wanted to do. \u201cCome with me,\u201d Lily said. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s too late. You\u2019re already here.\u201d I knew I should run, but I couldn\u2019t. I moaned in terror as I tried to make my legs move, but they wouldn\u2019t obey me. \u201cNo,\u201d I said again. \u201cCome with me.\u201d It was a hiss this time, harsh and furious, and then Lily\u2019s hand grabbed mine. I hadn\u2019t moved; I hadn\u2019t seen her move. But she had me, and her grip was icy and so hard, like concrete or bone. Her fingers crushed mine. \u201cPlease,\u201d I begged her, wild with fear as she began to pull me slowly across the grass. \u201cPlease, Lily. Where are we going?\u201d \u201cThis is what you came for.\u201d I couldn\u2019t get free of her; she was holding me too hard, pulling me toward the drop to the ocean. \u201cI\u2019m going over, and you\u2019re going with me.\u201d I started to scream, or at least I tried to. I didn\u2019t know if any sound came out of my throat or if it was all in my head. But I opened my mouth and tried, with everything I had, to scream as she yanked me forward. I fought her. I really did. But I finally learned what Beth always knew about Lily: There was nothing to stop her when she wanted something. She took what she wanted. And now she was taking me. She brought me to the edge. The toes of my sneakers went over, and I looked down. It wasn\u2019t a perfectly sheer drop; there were ledges, and brush, and rocks. And far below, the rocky shore and the ocean, the waves crawling up to the foot of the cliffs as the tide came in. \u201cBeautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lily said. I screamed. But she had me in her grip, her icy chill moving all the way through me. My struggles were hopeless. I tried to beg Lily for my life, but my breath was gone. Her voice was in my ear, as intimate as a lover\u2019s. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she said. And she pulled me down. \n CHAPTER FORTY-TWO March 1978 BETH Snow had fallen the night before, and there were wet crystals on the ground, melting into the lawn. Beth\u2019s sneakers were damp, her feet icy as she turned the key in the door of the Greer mansion and stepped inside. It was three o\u2019clock in the morning. Since the day of her acquittal, Beth had been hiding in a motel for nearly a week while reporters camped on the street in front of her house. Courtesy of Ransom, she\u2019d sat alone in a run-down room, sleeping and sometimes watching television. Thinking. Eventually, her posh neighbors had had enough; they\u2019d called the police, and now the press was gone. There had been nothing to see, anyway\u2014no dramatic homecoming to report on. Just the same old headlines, day after day: POSSIBLE \u201cLADY KILLER\u201d GOES FREE. BETH GREER UNREPENTANT. NOT GUILTY VERDICT ROCKS OREGON TOWN. Whether Beth Greer killed those men in cold blood or someone else did, one of the newspaper editorials said, the result is still the same: A killer is walking our streets right now, free. Tonight, with Arlen Heights quiet again, Beth had Ransom drop her off down the street so no one would see her come home. She was wearing jeans, an old dark sweater, a wool coat. Her hair was in a ponytail, and she wore no makeup. She had a single bag of belongings over her shoulder. The red shawl and the red lipstick were long gone. She slipped silently into the house and locked the door behind her. It was cold in here. Musty. Beth walked to the living room, and the first thing her gaze went to\u2014even before she dropped her bag\u2014was the liquor cabinet. She stared at the gleaming bottles, lined up just so. At the small fridge that contained chilled wine and ice. She could taste it, the cold vodka sliding down her throat, the decadent flavor of red wine. She could taste all of it. She was out of jail now. She could drink. She could quit drinking forever and start a new life. She could do anything. From upstairs came the sound of water running from a tap, and a footstep. Beth closed her eyes. She had expected this. Those days sitting in the motel, waiting, she had known this would happen. It was time. The cold air grew sharper, as if a door were open or a window broken somewhere, letting in a draft. Ignoring the running tap upstairs, Beth opened her eyes again and walked to the kitchen. She stood in the doorway, looking dully at the scene in front of her. The blood. The body. Julian. She hadn\u2019t been home the day he died, so she hadn\u2019t seen it, really. She hadn\u2019t felt the cold air or seen the blood, so this wasn\u2019t a memory. She and Mariana had come home after the cleaning crew that Ransom hired had left, though she imagined the kitchen always had a strange smell after that. Still, she\u2019d never seen it. She didn\u2019t know if she was seeing it now, whether this was real or she was losing her mind. She wasn\u2019t sure she cared. After a while, she turned away from the kitchen and walked upstairs. The door to the master bedroom was open. Standing in front of Mariana\u2019s open closet, her back to Beth as she looked through the clothes, was Lily. Beth was definitely seeing this. She knew that. Lily was wearing a silk kimono that fell to her knees, the fabric covered in gaudy pink and purple flowers. Her blond hair flowed down her back. Her legs beneath the hem of the kimono were bare, and Beth could tell she was naked underneath it. In the en suite bathroom, the water ran in the tub. The kimono was one of Mariana\u2019s. \u201cOur mother had such beautiful clothes,\u201d Lily said to Beth without turning. \u201cMost of them fit me, you know. I think I\u2019m going to wear them.\u201d \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Beth choked out. Even though she had known this would happen, had expected it\u2014she\u2019d baited Lily to come find her\u2014it was still shocking to see Lily in this bedroom, wearing Mariana\u2019s clothes. She really doesn\u2019t care, Beth thought. She really doesn\u2019t think I\u2019ll do anything. \u201cI\u2019m taking a bath.\u201d Lily turned and looked at her. Her face had that curious blank look that Beth had long ago learned to be afraid of. \u201cI live in this house now.\u201d The sight of Lily after all this time was hard to take. She looked like Mariana, like Beth, like herself. Beth knew every line of that face, from childhood to adulthood. She had loved that face and been terrified of it. She\u2019d had nightmares over the years that Lily was dead, her body unidentified in a hospital somewhere. She\u2019d also had nightmares about Lily coming home. She didn\u2019t know which was more frightening. And now Lily was standing here, naked in Mariana\u2019s robe, and part of Beth wanted to scream and run, to forget everything she\u2019d planned. Another part felt like all of her pieces were falling into place at last, like for the past months she\u2019d been a doll who wasn\u2019t put together properly. She knew Lily like she knew her own heart. There was only one way out of this. Only one way forward. She\u2019d known it since she\u2019d sat in a cell, watching Detective Black walk away. \u201cYou can\u2019t live in my house,\u201d she said through numb lips. \u201cIt\u2019ll be my house,\u201d Lily said. \u201cYou\u2019re out of prison now. You\u2019ll sign this place over to me, and it\u2019ll be mine.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Lily\u2019s voice was flat. \u201cYou have no choice, Beth.\u201d Just do what she says. The instinct was so old it was automatic. Do what Lily says, and she won\u2019t get mad. But this time Beth fought it. \u201cAnd where am I supposed to go?\u201d She had a flash of leaving here, walking out the door. She could go anywhere, and she would be free. She could pretend, as she had so many times, that Lily didn\u2019t exist anymore. And in the meantime, Lily would go back to killing. She always did. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d Lily said. \u201cYou stay here with me. That murder trial bullshit is over\u2014it was fun for a while, but now we can move on. You and me, in this house. Kind of like that first Christmas.\u201d She took a step toward Beth, and even though she was almost naked, it seemed threatening. Beth tried not to flinch. \u201cWe\u2019re sisters,\u201d Lily said. \u201cTwo halves of the same person.\u201d We\u2019re not, Beth wanted to say, furious that what she\u2019d just been through had been reduced to \u201cmurder trial bullshit.\u201d But the old instincts bubbled up again, persistent. When Lily was in this mood\u2014when Lily was in most moods, honestly\u2014it was best to placate her. But you had to do it so she wouldn\u2019t see through it. \u201cI just got out,\u201d Beth said, putting a note of weakness in her voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I haven\u2019t thought about it.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll do what I tell you,\u201d Lily said. \u201cI\u2019m done being half a person. I\u2019m done being the girl who doesn\u2019t exist. This house is mine. And if you want to stay out of trouble, then you\u2019re mine, too.\u201d Beth pictured spending the rest of her life here, doing whatever Lily wanted her to do. There would be blood on her hands sooner or later. Lily wouldn\u2019t want to keep doing her killings alone. \u201cI know what you did,\u201d she said, trying not to panic. \u201cThose two men. And before that\u2014Lawrence Gage, was that his name? He was your father, and you killed him, too.\u201d There was a quick second in which Lily was surprised, that unpleasant surprise that Beth had seen on her face only once before. Then she figured it out. \u201cThe lawyer,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knows who your father was. Lawrence Gage\u2019s murder was in the papers, and Ransom showed me.\u201d She took a step closer to her sister, the words pouring out. \u201cYou broke in and shot him, just like you did to my father. To Julian.\u201d It was hard to say her father\u2019s name, and she shuddered, thinking of what she\u2019d just seen in the kitchen. She made herself say it again. \u201cYou killed Julian.\u201d Lily was utterly calm, watching her. \u201cYou wanted me to,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was going to make you marry that boy. He didn\u2019t love you like you wanted. When it was over, Beth, you never said a word. Not to Mariana, not even to your precious cop. You didn\u2019t tell anyone. Just like you did nothing that night when you watched Mariana get into her car.\u201d Those words sliced her, the injury that went deepest and wouldn\u2019t heal. Lily had already stormed off that night. Yet she knew that Beth had stood there, watching their mother leave. Maybe they really were two halves of the same person, like Lily had said. If Lily was a killer, then so was Beth. If they stayed here together, it was a matter of time before Lily made Beth do the next murder herself. And if Beth tried to go to the police, the first man on Lily\u2019s list would be Detective Black. The second one might be Ransom. \u201cWhy?\u201d Beth asked her sister. \u201cWhy do you do these things? Can you at least tell me why?\u201d Lily looked at her curiously. \u201cDo you want a reason? I can pretend there is one, if you like. I can tell you it\u2019s because of my childhood, or the fact that my father raped my mother. I can tell you it\u2019s because of the foster homes. Or I can tell you I\u2019m simply bad. Take your pick, Beth. I can tell you whatever you want.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Beth cried. \u201cAfter everything, that\u2019s all you can say? Did you do it all just because you wanted to?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Lily said. \u201cI did want to. It was easy, you know. I thought it might be hard.\u201d She shook her head, frowning. \u201cIt\u2019s a high, killing someone. But sometimes . . . sometimes there\u2019s a moment where you have the power of life and death, and then you realize it doesn\u2019t make you any different than you were before.\u201d She rubbed her temple. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a bath. I don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore.\u201d She turned her back, and just like that, everything died in Beth. Love, loyalty, even fear. She saw Mariana\u2019s face that last day they went shopping, the scarf in her blond hair. She saw Julian\u2019s face in the rearview mirror as they drove to the Christmas party when Beth was sixteen, the crinkles at the edges of his unhappy eyes. She saw Paul Veerhoever crumpled at the side of the road, his face a bloody pulp in the darkness. I loved you more than anything, she heard her mother say. She felt nothing. Nothing. No one is coming to save us. We\u2019re two halves of the same person. No one is coming. She had known she would have to do this, no matter how hard it was. It was time. She did it quickly. As the water ran in the bathtub, as Lily turned away, Beth grabbed her father\u2019s ashtray from the nightstand. The housekeepers had emptied the ashtray some long-ago day, but it still smelled like ashes, the smell that was Julian and Mariana. It was big and extremely heavy, made of solid thick glass. She swung it with every ounce of her strength at the back of Lily\u2019s head. It was hard. Hard. Lily stumbled forward, but she didn\u2019t quite fall, and Beth had to hit her again. Again. Her hands were icy and numb. Her arm ached. Her brain had gone somewhere else, somewhere this wasn\u2019t happening, where time had no meaning. Maybe it had taken a few seconds to hit Lily with the ashtray; maybe it had taken hours. Beth would never know. There was blood, and Lily was on the floor, but she wasn\u2019t dead. She twisted onto her back and hit Beth in the face, her fist smashing into Beth\u2019s cheek, and this time Beth had to hit Lily in the forehead. She thought she might be screaming. When Lily went quiet, bleeding and moaning softly, Beth dragged her into the bathroom. The bathtub had started to overflow, water running onto the tiled floor. Beth pulled Lily\u2019s body to the tub and shoved her under the water, holding the back of her bloody head until her sister finally went still. It was easy, you know, Lily said. I thought it might be hard. There\u2019s a moment where you have the power of life and death, and then you realize it doesn\u2019t make you any different than you were before. Beth wasn\u2019t crying now. She wasn\u2019t screaming. She wasn\u2019t making any sound at all. She couldn\u2019t feel her hands in the warm water. Her knees were soaked. Her arms ached, and her stomach was hot and liquid. For a humiliating second, she thought she might shit herself, but somehow she didn\u2019t. Somehow she turned the water off and sat back, gasping breath after breath as if she\u2019d been running. The house was quiet, so quiet. If Beth had been screaming\u2014she thought she might have been screaming\u2014none of the neighbors would hear. She was alone. No one was coming. She breathed for a while, and then she thought about it, feeling strangely calm. There was the ashtray. Blood on the bedroom floor. The crumbs of old ashes. The water sloshing on the bathroom tile. The body. She would need to clean up all of it. She would need to put Lily somewhere no one could find her. She would have to do that alone. But she thought maybe she could do it. She looked at Lily\u2019s slumped body, still in the kimono, and she thought about crying. She thought about taking her sister\u2019s cold hand in hers, telling Lily she was sorry. She didn\u2019t do any of those things, because Lily would have hated it. She reached out and touched her fingertips to the small of Lily\u2019s back, leaving them there for only a second before pulling them away again. Lily had always hated to be touched. Beth got to her feet and got to work. \n CHAPTER FORTY-THREE October 2017 SHEA I was drowning. I opened my mouth, and salt water rushed in, pushing its way down my throat. I couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t open my eyes. Every part of my body was in pain. I thrashed, and my hands scrabbled against rocks under the water, cold and slick. I clawed at them, trying to get my head above water. My head throbbed like it was going to explode. I was so disoriented I didn\u2019t know which way was up until the soles of my feet hit rock and I pushed off, screaming. I broke the surface and screamed out loud into the air. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2014pain was radiating from my knee up and down my leg, throbbing as my feet pressed against the rocks. The water was only waist-deep, but my legs wouldn\u2019t hold me. I sank again, resting on my good knee as I tried to wipe my hair out of my face and open my stinging eyes. I could only use my right arm; the left was useless, dangling in the water in a dead mass of agony. I pushed my hair back, gasping and sputtering, blinking the salt into my eyes. I was at the bottom of the cliff, below the Greer mansion. I had fallen to the rocks where the tide was coming in. The freezing waves shoved at me, jerking at my useless arm and trying to unbalance me on my one good leg. I remembered Lily\u2019s hand gripping mine, the way she\u2019d pulled me. Let\u2019s go, she\u2019d said. But I didn\u2019t remember the fall itself. Was that a protective instinct in my brain, blocking out the fall? Or was that Lily? Because as I\u2019d fallen, she\u2019d showed me everything. The last night in the mansion. The confrontation with Beth. The ashtray. The bathtub. How long had I fallen? Three seconds? Five? I\u2019d seen all of it, the way you can dream a year\u2019s worth of dreams in a twenty-minute nap. Instead of seeing the rocks and the ocean rushing up at me, I\u2019d seen Lily die. The waves pushed harder at me as the tide continued to come in, and I tried to move myself toward the rocky shore. My knee and my arm screamed at me, even though both were under icy water. I glanced down and saw that my left arm was hanging at a crazy angle below the elbow, the elbow itself the wrong shape. I forced myself to look away as my teeth chattered. I must have hit the rocks at the bottom of the water when I landed, though I didn\u2019t remember it. I was probably lucky the tide was coming in, because if I\u2019d hit the rocks without any water to break my fall, I\u2019d be dead. I moved my good leg and my good arm, pulling myself forward. I slipped and fell, then got purchase again. The pain was so bad I screamed, over and over, as I inched another step, and then another. Did something touch the back of my neck? I crawled faster, letting the pain wash over me. This is it, I thought grimly. Drowning or hypothermia\u2014that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to go. Or maybe Lily will just grab me and finish me off. She could push my head under the water, kill me the way Beth had killed her. If she bothered, I wouldn\u2019t be able to put up much resistance. My body was shaking\u2014adrenaline, fear, pain, shock, and cold taking over. My vision was blurred. I thought I saw a shape moving from the corner of my eye, but I couldn\u2019t be sure. I lurched to the left as my damaged knee buckled again, and reached out with my good hand to break my fall. I was emerging slowly out of the water now, into the shallower depths on the rocky shore, beating the incoming tide. My elbow was broken. I knew it; the pain was too much, and I could feel bone grind against bone as I limped over the rocks. I blinked and realized that there was something red in my eyes. I touched my forehead and found a gash, open and salty and bleeding. I pressed my fingers to it, remembering some long-ago first-aid tip about stanching a wound. My neck was wrenched, and even my teeth hurt. Where was I going to go from here? Where was the nearest house? My bag and my phone were long gone, vanished into the ocean, and, despite my situation, I mourned all of those interviews, all of my notes, drifting away on the current somewhere. I managed to get into knee-deep water, and then I turned course along the shore, parallel to the cliffs. With the blood slowing its flow into my eyes, I could see that I was heading in the direction of Claire Lake proper, away from Arlen Heights. Far in the distance, the cliffs tapered down, toward the inland lake that gave the town its name. To my right were the cliffs, and to my left was the ocean. The only way to go was forward. I didn\u2019t know how long it would take me, and I didn\u2019t know if I would make it before the tide came all the way in. My feet had long ago gone numb in their sneakers. But I sloshed one foot in front of the other, and I started to walk. \u2014 I didn\u2019t know how long I walked\u2014it felt like hours. I was limping harder, barely able to put weight on my bad knee, and now that my arms were out of the water my left elbow was starting to swell. The sleeve of my shirt was tight and getting tighter, and the rising tide was up to my thighs. I realized sluggishly that the wall of cliffs to my right had diminished. There was a path leading up the rise, and then a low wrought iron fence. I could glimpse something bright blue and bright yellow past the fence\u2014a children\u2019s slide, I realized. It was a playground. The sky was getting dark, though I still had no idea what time it was. I changed course, leaving the water and pulling myself painfully up the path. There was no one on the playground. I limped to the swing set and lowered myself to one of the swings, shaking with cold. There was a creak, and then movement at the corner of my eye, and a little boy appeared. He was seven or eight years old, maybe, wearing rubber boots and a thick wool coat, a wool cap on his head. He had come around the corner from the monkey bars and stood looking at me with his big brown eyes, keeping a wary distance away. \u201cHi,\u201d I managed to say, wondering how to sound unthreatening when sitting on a child\u2019s swing, shaking and shivering and bleeding, my arm twisted at the wrong angle. \u201cI\u2019m hurt. Can you help me?\u201d The boy rubbed his fingers together in a nervous gesture, watching me but not coming any closer. He didn\u2019t speak. \u201cWhere\u2019s your mother?\u201d I asked him. He pointed behind him, though I could only see the monkey bars and the other side of the fence. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked him as pain throbbed in my feet, which were no longer as numb as they had been in the ocean. My knee was seizing up, too; there was no way I was ever getting off this swing. The boy spoke softly at first, and then he repeated himself: \u201cToby.\u201d \u201cToby,\u201d I said. And then it hit me\u2014this lonely place, this little boy, the absence of any other kids or parents. \u201cAre you real?\u201d His eyes went wide. \u201cAre you?\u201d Would a ghost ask me that? I didn\u2019t know. Maybe not. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m real, and my name is Shea. I need help. Can you find your mother for me?\u201d Toby took a step back, but he was still staring at me. \u201cPlease,\u201d I said to him, my voice thin with pain. \u201cToby!\u201d A woman came through the gate, running. She was wearing jeans, a thick sweater, and a thick coat. She resembled her son, her hair in short twists, and she looked alarmed. \u201cToby, I told you not to go to the monkey bars! Get away from that lady!\u201d She stopped when she got to the boy and looked at me. \u201cOh my God.\u201d The world faded out for a second, then came back into focus. \u201cI had an accident,\u201d I managed as the woman pulled her cell phone from her back pocket. \u201cCan you call an ambulance, please?\u201d Stay awake, I thought as the woman dialed 911. Another half-forgotten piece of wisdom\u2014weren\u2019t you supposed to avoid passing out? Was that for a concussion or hypothermia? I couldn\u2019t remember. I gripped the cold chain of the swing and tried to stay upright. I looked at Toby, whose back was pressed into his mother\u2019s legs now. He was still watching me. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask the lady?\u201d he said as his mother spoke into the phone. \u201cWhat?\u201d I said. \u201cThe lady behind you. Why didn\u2019t you ask her? Didn\u2019t she want to help?\u201d I stared at him. I didn\u2019t want to turn around. I couldn\u2019t. \u201cThere\u2019s a lady behind me?\u201d I asked the boy, my voice almost a whisper. He shook his head. \u201cNot now. Before.\u201d He pointed to a spot right behind the swing set. \u201cShe was right there.\u201d I could hear a siren, far away now but getting closer. Toby\u2019s mother held the phone to her ear with one hand, and she dropped her other absently to her son\u2019s shoulder, keeping him close. Everything spun, and I gripped the swing chain tighter. \u201cToby,\u201d I said, \u201cI want you to promise me something. If you ever see that lady again, don\u2019t talk to her. Run.\u201d I thought maybe he nodded. But I couldn\u2019t be sure, because the world faded and I closed my eyes. \n CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR October 2017 SHEA When I awoke, the first thing I saw was Michael. He was sitting next to my hospital bed, absorbed in reading something I couldn\u2019t see. He was wearing a black zip-up hoodie, and he had several days\u2019 worth of dark stubble on his jaw. He had a frown of concentration between his eyebrows, but when he heard me move it disappeared as he looked at me. \u201cThe drugs are wearing off,\u201d he said in a gentle voice. They\u2019d been wearing off for a while. I\u2019d opened my eyes once before, though I had no idea how long ago. That time, no one had been in the room. I saw the empty coffee cup next to Michael and guessed why he\u2019d been gone last time. \u201cI can\u2019t move,\u201d I said, my voice a croak. Michael reached to a table out of my line of sight and brought a cup of water with a straw, putting the straw to my lips. \u201cYour elbow is broken,\u201d he said as I drank. \u201cSo is your knee. Two fractured ribs, the gash on your forehead got ten stitches, and you were halfway to hypothermia. Still you walked three miles. No one knows how you did it.\u201d Lily, I thought as I let the straw go. But no, that wasn\u2019t right. Lily had been there somewhere as I walked, but she hadn\u2019t done it for me. I\u2019d done it myself. Lily might have pushed me over the edge, but everything after that had been me. \u201cYour sister was here,\u201d Michael said as he put the cup of water away. \u201cShe wanted to take leave from work, but I told her to go and I\u2019d call her if you woke up. Which I\u2019m going to do shortly.\u201d Esther would be worried. Really, really worried. What she wouldn\u2019t know yet was that now, at what looked like my lowest point, it was finally time for her to stop worrying about me. \u201cI have to tell you something,\u201d I said to Michael. \u201cYes, you do,\u201d he said. He was calm, confident, and sure, concerned without being rattled, and I knew to my bones that I\u2019d picked the right man. That he\u2019d be what I needed him to be. \u201cI hope it\u2019s a story about how you fell over the cliff behind the Greer mansion and ended up in the ocean.\u201d \u201cHow did you know that\u2019s where I went over?\u201d \u201cBecause Beth Greer says her motion sensors went off and you told her you were at her house.\u201d I felt my first pulse of trepidation. \u201cBeth is here?\u201d Michael gave me a look. \u201cOf course not. She called someone, though it wasn\u2019t me, and told them. I heard it through official channels.\u201d That sounded like Beth: manipulating as much as she could without getting directly involved. I felt the fire of something burn deep in my belly. Revenge, maybe. \u201cListen,\u201d I said to Michael. He turned his dark eyes to me. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d I took a breath, organizing my thoughts, and then I started. \u201cWhen I was nine, I was walking home from school. A man pulled up beside me in his car.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the story he was expecting. I saw a flicker of recognition cross his eyes, but he didn\u2019t interrupt. \u201cHe asked if I was cold, and then he told me my parents were waiting for me and he had to take me to them. He told me to get into his car, and I did.\u201d I lay back against the pillows. The painkillers were definitely wearing off, and everything was starting to hurt, but I was used to pain now. I had to get this out before they gave me pills that put me to sleep again. \u201cI knew something was wrong almost right away,\u201d I told Michael. \u201cIt was a gut feeling, even though I was only a kid. We weren\u2019t heading in the direction of my house. I asked if I could get out, and the man said no. Then he put his hand on my leg, trying to push it under my uniform skirt.\u201d There was silence in the room except for the busy murmur of the hospital outside. Michael looked tense, but still he didn\u2019t interrupt, and again I knew I\u2019d picked the right man. \u201cI won\u2019t go into details,\u201d I said. \u201cWe struggled. He didn\u2019t manage to sexually assault me, because he was still driving the car. He did hit me hard enough to make me bleed. The car slowed down and I got the door open. I jumped out and ran.\u201d Michael closed his eyes. His breathing was a little harsh. \u201cI was sure the man was chasing me,\u201d I said. \u201cI thought he would get out of the car and run after me, or that he\u2019d circle the block, looking to grab me again. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d just let me run.\u201d Pain throbbed up from my broken elbow, and I tried not to wince. \u201cI ran into a stranger\u2019s backyard and hid in the garden shed. I crouched in there, barely daring to breathe, jumping at every sound. I had no idea how long I stayed in there, but I found out later it was three hours. It was winter, and by the time I got home it was fully dark and I couldn\u2019t feel my hands or my feet.\u201d Michael opened his eyes again, his jaw working as he bit back whatever he wanted to say. \u201cMy parents were frantic,\u201d I said. \u201cThere were police at my house. My father was crying. I\u2019d never seen my father cry. I didn\u2019t think it was possible. They were in a panic because I hadn\u2019t come home from school, and when my parents called the police about it, the police had showed up in minutes. They were alarmed because a girl had been found dead fifteen miles away, and they wanted to be sure it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d Finally, Michael spoke, and though his voice was tense, he kept it low. \u201cAnton Anders,\u201d he said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t chase me,\u201d I said. The words were harder to get out, because I was gritting my teeth through the growing pain. \u201cHe didn\u2019t come after me at all. When I ran, he drove to a different neighborhood and waited near a schoolyard. He picked up a girl named Sherry Haines. She was nine, just like I was. He raped and murdered her and dumped her body by the side of a two-lane highway. He did all that in the three hours while I was hiding in the shed.\u201d I looked at Michael. \u201cYou know the Anton Anders case, I assume, since you were a cop, and so were your father and uncle.\u201d When he nodded, I said, \u201cI was Girl A. I am Girl A. She\u2019s me.\u201d \u201cI wondered about it,\u201d Michael admitted. \u201cThe way you reacted when I said that Joshua Black solved the Sherry Haines case. It seemed personal somehow. You\u2019re the right age to be Girl A. I could have gotten access to the files, found your name for myself. But I didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be nosy,\u201d I said. He looked at me and saw that I was trying, however weakly, for humor. A smile touched the corners of his handsome mouth. \u201cProfessionally nosy,\u201d he corrected me. \u201cIf you wanted to tell me, I figured you would.\u201d He was right. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t hidden in the shed,\u201d I said, \u201cif I\u2019d gone straight home and my parents had called the police, maybe Sherry Haines would still be alive.\u201d \u201cOr maybe not,\u201d Michael said. \u201cMaybe he would have found a different victim on a different day. They\u2019ve never been able to tie Anton Anders to any other cases, but no one who looks at the Sherry Haines case believes she was his first victim. He was too practiced. You were a terrified nine-year-old girl who had just been assaulted, Shea. Nothing was your fault. Nothing at all.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about every angle for the past twenty years. I know I\u2019m not to blame. But I\u2019m not a little girl this time around.\u201d I shifted in the bed as the pain got fiercer. \u201cDon\u2019t call a nurse yet,\u201d I said when Michael reached for the call button. \u201cJust listen. Beth Greer murdered her half sister, Lily, in 1978. She hit Lily over the head with an ashtray in the master bedroom of the Greer mansion, then drowned her in the bathtub. Then she dumped Lily\u2019s body in the thick of the woods at the end of Claire Lake. Lily has been there all this time, until her remains were found a few weeks ago.\u201d \u201cJesus Christ, Shea,\u201d Michael said, shocked. \u201cDid Beth confess?\u201d \u201cOf course not.\u201d \u201cThen how do you know this?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Behind Michael, the door opened and a nurse came in. She pulled a wheeled tray with her: a blood pressure cuff, pills in a small paper cup. I ignored her and put my good hand on Michael\u2019s arm. \u201cCall your cop friends,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd call Joshua Black. Tell all of them that Beth killed Lily Knowles because Lily was the Lady Killer. It\u2019s her remains that were found, that I messaged you about. DNA will prove it if they do a test. For all I know, Beth is going to try and find some way to stop all of this from happening. Call them now.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d the nurse said, coming along the other side of my bed. \u201cWe need a moment, please,\u201d she said to Michael. \u201cShea, this is crazy. If Beth didn\u2019t confess, there\u2019s no way you can know this.\u201d \u201cLily killed all of them, including Julian,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll give them everything Ransom gave us. We have to re-create the timeline and look for murders we didn\u2019t know about before. Mariana was an accident. She drank too much, or maybe took medication, after a fight with Lily. She thought she was going to find Lily, to apologize to her, when she got in that car.\u201d \u201cUm,\u201d the nurse said, probably shocked. But I wasn\u2019t looking at her. I was looking at Michael. His gaze held mine. He guessed how I knew, maybe. I had too many details. I had seen it. But like he\u2019d said before, if I wanted to tell him, I would. \u201cThis is it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the end after all these years.\u201d \u201cThis is the beginning,\u201d I said as the nurse lifted my arm. \u201cCall them. Now.\u201d \n CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE From the Claire Lake News Online, October 2017: POLICE INVESTIGATION IN ARLEN HEIGHTS SPARKS QUESTIONS Police were recently seen entering the Arlen Heights home of Beth Greer, who was acquitted of a series of murders in 1978. They were inside the home for several hours, apparently with the authority of a warrant. Carl Contreras, chief of police with the Claire Lake Police Department, declined to give a statement except to say, \u201cI cannot comment on any ongoing investigation.\u201d Greer was arrested and tried for the murders of Thomas Armstrong, 31, and Paul Veerhoever, 36, in 1977. She was found not guilty. The murders have never been solved. \u201cShe\u2019s quiet,\u201d a neighbor, Winifred Platts, said of Greer, who has lived in her childhood home since the acquittal. \u201cThe press used to hang around after the trial, but they went away and it\u2019s been quiet ever since. We don\u2019t see her much, just at the store or whatnot. She doesn\u2019t seem to have any friends. We\u2019re not happy to have a murderer in the neighborhood, but she had her day in court. If she didn\u2019t do it, then I guess she didn\u2019t. But I don\u2019t like this police search at all.\u201d Claire Lake Police will not comment on whether the warrant is connected to the so-called Lady Killer murders. Because of double jeopardy laws, Greer cannot be charged with those murders a second time. \u201cSo what does it mean, then?\u201d asks Timothy Garge, another neighbor who was busy raking his lawn. \u201cDid she kill someone else? That\u2019s just great. If she doesn\u2019t sell, we might have to.\u201d \u2014 From the Oregon News, October 2017: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to find at my house,\u201d Beth Greer said. . . . The law of double jeopardy would apply to the murders of Armstrong and Veerhoever, though it would not apply to any other crimes Miss Greer might be accused of that arise from the investigation at her home. Miss Greer issued a statement through the office of her attorney, Ransom Wells: \u201cThe search of my home was legal persecution, pure and simple.\u201d The statement was not given personally by Wells, who his staff say is in declining health, but sent by email to local media outlets. \u201cI have lived a quiet life for forty years, ever since my acquittal at trial. I have harmed no one. This has been brought on by a blogger named Shea Collins, who is seeking fame based on lies about crimes she claims I\u2019ve committed. All of it is categorically false, and I\u2019m considering legal action to protect myself.\u201d Collins apparently runs a website called the Book of Cold Cases, which contains several articles about the Lady Killer murders along with articles about other famous unsolved crimes. Collins appears to be a Claire Lake resident, though attempts to reach her for comment were met with silence . . . \u2014 \u201cShe\u2019s messing with me,\u201d I said. I was fully dressed in my hospital room, sitting in a wheelchair, talking on the phone as the nurse put my bag in my lap. I was being discharged after a monthlong stay that included surgeries on both my elbow and my knee. My arm was in a sling and I\u2019d be on crutches for a few months at least, but I was finally going home. It should have been an exciting moment, but I was too busy talking to Joshua Black to notice. \u201cMessing with you?\u201d he said. \u201cShe just seems angry to me.\u201d Of course Beth was angry. The full force of the Claire Lake PD had come down on her. What Joshua Black had to do with any of it, I could only guess; for a man who had been retired for a decade, he seemed to be central. No one in the department held more respect or more sway. \u201cShe\u2019s screwing with my head,\u201d I said as the nurse started pushing my chair down the hallway. \u201cShe\u2019s gone to the media to tell everyone who I am, and that she\u2019s planning to sue me. She\u2019s sent so much traffic to my website that the server crashed. I have over two hundred emails in my inbox, and my phone won\u2019t stop ringing with requests for interviews. She\u2019s just made me famous.\u201d \u201cSounds terrible to me,\u201d Black said. \u201cIt is terrible. I haven\u2019t talked to my bosses yet, but I could easily get fired over the publicity. And I\u2019ve never wanted to be in the public eye.\u201d Even now, all I wanted was to go home to my condo and get Winston Purrchill back from Esther, who had taken him in while I\u2019d been in the hospital. I wanted one of my quiet nights with my laptop, my cat, and my familiar anxieties, and I had the feeling I was never going to have one of those nights again. \u201cAnd at the same time,\u201d I said to Joshua, \u201cI called my health insurance company this morning. I assumed I was going to be in debt for the rest of my life, but guess what? I\u2019m not. Everything is paid for.\u201d \u201cWow,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cAnd you think that was Beth?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s the only rich person I know.\u201d I\u2019d had two surgeries, including titanium pieces inserted into my crushed left elbow. I\u2019d had drugs and antibiotics and physical therapy, which I was going to continue for months as an outpatient. Even with the insurance from my job, I\u2019d thought I\u2019d be underwater forever. The bill for the deductibles alone was probably more than my annual salary. And yet I didn\u2019t owe a penny. I could practically hear Beth\u2019s voice, dry and a little impatient: Well, my dead sister did try to kill you. I suppose I\u2019m somewhat responsible. She\u2019d paid my hospital bill, and then she\u2019d made a statement that threatened to sue me, and threw me to the publicity wolves. Game on, Beth. \u201cGod only knows what she\u2019s thinking,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cI\u2019ve never known.\u201d He was angry, too. Since my accident, he\u2019d visited me in the hospital a few times and we\u2019d talked on the phone. I liked him so much it was a little scary, and I felt for him. He\u2019d spent forty years believing that Beth wasn\u2019t a murderer, and now he wasn\u2019t so sure. I knew that his original intuition was right\u2014Beth wasn\u2019t a murderer, at least while she was accused and on trial. The murder had come after. But I couldn\u2019t explain to him how I knew that, because Joshua Black didn\u2019t seem like the type to believe in ghosts. What I had given him was everything I knew about the existence of Lily Knowles, starting with her birth certificate. Lily Knowles, who had left no legal trace behind since aging out of the foster system at eighteen. It had taken Black maybe half a minute to ask himself if Beth\u2019s missing half sister was connected to the remains found by the lake. Now he and the Claire Lake PD had taken over. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking, either,\u201d I said, though that was a lie. I knew exactly what Beth was thinking. She wanted me off-balance, wondering what she was going to do next. She wanted me to understand how much power she had. And she wanted a fight. \u201cAre you going to tell me what they found in the master bedroom?\u201d I asked him. \u201cThe police will only say that any evidence they find will be sent for testing. It\u2019s frustratingly vague.\u201d \u201cYou know I can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d he said, though I had no doubt that Joshua knew every detail of the investigation. \u201cI will ask you again, though, how you knew exactly where to look and what we might find. You seem to know a lot about something that happened before you were born.\u201d \u201cBeth told me,\u201d I said. The nurse had pushed me into the elevator, and we were descending. \u201cShe told me about Lily Knowles in our interviews, and Ransom Wells gave me the documentation, including the birth certificate. According to Beth, Lily is responsible for the murders of Julian Greer, Thomas Armstrong, Paul Veerhoever, and Lawrence Gage. And there are likely others, too, including a groundskeeper. We just have to find the others.\u201d There was a moment of silence on the other end of the line. Joshua was playing it close to the vest, which he was so good at. How he\u2019d felt when he\u2019d learned, after forty years, that Beth had a half sister, he hadn\u2019t told me. He was all business when he talked to me about the case. I suspected that maybe, for the first time in a long time, the legendary Detective Black was mad. Really mad. \u201cSo you went to the Greer mansion alone,\u201d he said to me on the phone now as the elevator doors opened and the nurse pushed me down the busy hallway. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd you fell over the cliff.\u201d We\u2019d gone over this before, more than once, but a cop is always a cop. \u201cYes. I fell.\u201d \u201cAnd Beth wasn\u2019t home at the time.\u201d \u201cYou know she wasn\u2019t. She was getting a medical scan done. It\u2019s an ironclad alibi. Beth didn\u2019t push me, I swear.\u201d \u201cIt just seems odd that you would fall over a dangerous cliff on your own. You\u2019re certain you weren\u2019t intoxicated?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m certain. It was an accident, okay? I stood in the wrong place and leaned the wrong way, and over I went. They really should put a fence up there. It\u2019s dangerous. Now, how about you tell me what the lab is testing and how long it will take?\u201d The change of subject worked. \u201cI never said there was any lab testing.\u201d \u201cIt was in the statement in the news.\u201d \u201cNo, it said that anything that was collected would be sent for lab testing. You\u2019re as bad as those reporters. There\u2019s nothing to report.\u201d \u201cNo? Then why am I hearing that the DNA tests on the body that was found by the lake are being expedited?\u201d \u201cWhere are you hearing that?\u201d \u201cSome of those emails in my inbox are from people who hear things. Is it true?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hanging up now. Please be careful, Shea. That\u2019s all I ask.\u201d I thanked him and hung up, thinking Of course I\u2019ll be careful, but I\u2019ve already survived Anton Anders and Lily Knowles, two of Claire Lake\u2019s worst murderers. I can survive Beth Greer. The nurse pushed me through the front doors of the hospital, and I inhaled the fresh air, taking it in deep even though it was cloudy and cold. The bite of fall felt good in my throat and my lungs. An SUV had pulled up to the curb, and a familiar figure got out. I thanked the nurse as Michael De Vos took the crutches from her and helped me out of the wheelchair. He was bundled in a wool coat against the chill, and he\u2019d left the stubble on his jaw at my request. He looked woodsy and masculine and all-over good. He smiled at me and kissed me sweetly as I leaned on the crutches. \u201cReady?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. He opened the passenger door of the SUV. I hesitated for a moment, my gaze on the darkness of the passenger seat. I glanced at Michael to see him watching me. He looked like he wasn\u2019t in a hurry, as if he could wait all day. \u201cYou can do this,\u201d he said. \u201cI know,\u201d I replied. I limped to the passenger seat and got in. I handed Michael the crutches as I swung my bad leg into the SUV. Then I took a breath and closed the door, ready to go home. \n CHAPTER FORTY-SIX Five Months Later April 2018 From the popular podcast Listening to True Crime, episode 109, released April 13, 2018: PAULA WATTS (LTC host): I\u2019ve done a deep dive into this. The Lady Killer case has been an obsession of mine for years\u2014I know I\u2019m not the only one. There are a million details, a million theories. And I mean, Beth Greer! You just look at her, and it\u2019s like, \u201cCould she have done it? Maybe she could. Maybe she shot two random men just because she was rich and bored and crazy.\u201d You can see it, in a way. And then you wonder, am I thinking that because that\u2019s what society has programmed me to think? That any woman who doesn\u2019t fit inside a neat little box, any woman who has sexuality as blatant and unapologetic as Beth Greer\u2019s, maybe that woman is dangerous. Maybe she should be shunned and put in a jail cell. For us as women, I think, we look at that case and it brings up so many questions. SHEA COLLINS: I know. I agree. I\u2019ve been obsessed with the case myself for a long time, which you can see from the articles on my site. PAULA: But this is crazy, isn\u2019t it? This is nuts. I read that they reopened the Julian Greer case. Jesus, they reopened it! Because now we know that Beth Greer\u2019s mother had a baby out of wedlock, and Lily Knowles existed, and she, at the very least\u2014 We don\u2019t know much, but we know she was a foster child in the system and that as an adult she was a psychiatric patient. And I\u2019m not saying anything about people with mental illness, because they can\u2019t help that, but this was the seventies, and the treatment Lily probably got was to get thrown in a room somewhere with some screwed-up antipsychotic drugs, and that\u2019s it. She was a mess. SHEA: They\u2019ve found some of her psychiatric records and released them, though not all of them. They\u2019ve also reopened the Lawrence Gage case in Arizona. Did you know they lost the bullet in that case? It\u2019s just gone. Apparently there was a fire in one of their evidence storage spaces and some evidence was lost, including that bullet. So we\u2019ll never know if the ballistics match the other murders. But I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re pursuing the case with DNA. PAULA: There was DNA left at that crime scene? SHEA: They found a couple of hairs, I think. And if they can get the DNA from the hairs, they can match it to\u2014 PAULA: They might match it to Beth Greer, right? Because Lily was Beth\u2019s sister. SHEA: Yeah, I think that could happen. Or they can match it to the DNA from the body they found, which we think is Lily\u2019s body. PAULA: So have they matched the DNA from that body to Beth\u2019s? SHEA: I don\u2019t know. No one will tell me. PAULA: Come on! You\u2019re the expert on this case. You know everything! SHEA: There are lots of things the cops won\u2019t tell me, though believe me, I ask. I\u2019m a big pain in their asses. They pretty much hate me, but that\u2019s fine. PAULA: You\u2019re so freaking brave it blows me away. Beth Greer must hate you, too. And maybe she isn\u2019t the Lady Killer, but she\u2019s a pretty intimidating person, even now. SHEA: I don\u2019t think she hates me. She agreed to have me interview her in the first place, and she told me about Lily. No one knew about Lily until she pointed me in the right direction. PAULA: But because of you, she could be looking at new murder charges. Aren\u2019t you a bit scared of her? SHEA: I\u2019ve been researching this case. I\u2019ve seen some things. I had an accident it took months to recover from. Honestly, not much scares me anymore. I want the truth to come out. PAULA: Does Beth Greer ever call you? Do you guys, like, hang out? Be honest. What\u2019s she like? SHEA: We don\u2019t hang out. We have talked\u2014I\u2019ll say that she knows my number, and I know hers. We don\u2019t shoot the shit or anything. As for what she\u2019s like, I don\u2019t really know how to describe it. I think the Beth you see in the media, in the photos, a lot of that is the real Beth. It isn\u2019t like she\u2019s at home baking cookies or something. She\u2019s hard to figure out, and she likes it that way. PAULA: If you guys have wine parties or start a book club or something, call me. I\u2019ll move to Oregon for that. SHEA: If we do that, I\u2019ll definitely call. \u2014 The doctor\u2019s office fired me. I couldn\u2019t blame them. I\u2019d left work one day a nobody, and then I\u2019d been in the hospital for a month and I\u2019d come back famous\u2014or maybe I was infamous. I never really knew which it was. It didn\u2019t matter. I was busy. Traffic and memberships on the Book of Cold Cases skyrocketed. I got a lot of interview requests, though I didn\u2019t accept many of them. I started work on an article about my interviews with Beth, the amazing story she\u2019d spun. The article was long, and it was by far the best thing I\u2019d ever written, and, to my amazement, Rolling Stone bought it. After that came more requests\u2014for more articles about the Lady Killer case, and for articles about the other cases I\u2019d researched. I was a guest on a few podcasts, and then, with Michael\u2019s help, I tried the unthinkable: I started a podcast myself. The numbers started out good, and then they got better. I\u2019d never planned to be this person, talking all the time in the spotlight. I\u2019d never chased fame, and I wouldn\u2019t have chased it now except for the fact that my fame served one important purpose: It kept the spotlight on Beth. Michael\u2019s private detective business started to climb, too, and he took on better and better cases. Our relationship was serious, and it was the best thing in my life\u2014I was crazy about him, and I thought he felt the same about me. We worked together on a lot of projects, both mine and his, and we spent a lot of nights at either his place or mine. But we mutually agreed that we weren\u2019t living together yet, and we made no mention of marriage. We were both too burned. It was one of the things we understood instinctively about each other without having to talk it to death. There were a lot of things like that with me and Michael. \u201cI like him,\u201d Esther said when we had lunch together one Saturday in a diner in downtown Claire Lake. \u201cHe\u2019s ultraserious, like you are. He\u2019s smart. He likes you. And as the girls say today, he\u2019s a snack.\u201d I flinched. \u201cPlease don\u2019t say things like that. You\u2019re an embarrassing mom already, and the baby isn\u2019t even here yet.\u201d My sister smiled and sipped her sparkling water with a twist of lime. She and Will had been scheduled for their first round of IVF when they found out she was already pregnant. Now she was quietly happy in a way I\u2019d never seen her, though of course she was still Esther the overachiever. Everything about this baby was being organized to the smallest detail. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it had a 401(k) already. \u201cYou can be the cool aunt,\u201d Esther said. \u201cI\u2019ll be the awkward mom. It works for me. How is the physio going?\u201d I shrugged and speared a piece of roasted potato\u2014using my right hand, because my left elbow ached almost constantly. \u201cI go as often as I can.\u201d \u201cShea. You\u2019re working too much. You had a terrible trauma. You have to take care of yourself.\u201d \u201cI am,\u201d I argued. \u201cI will. Just as soon as all of this is over.\u201d Esther frowned. \u201cI know that Beth is over sixty, but she looks pretty healthy to me. You\u2019re exposing her as a murderer. Maybe you should be careful in dark parking lots.\u201d \u201cI never go into dark parking lots,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd Beth talks a big game about suing me, but that\u2019s bluster. She doesn\u2019t actually care about murder charges. If she did, she would never have agreed to talk to me at all.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t get this,\u201d Esther said. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as someone who doesn\u2019t care about murder charges.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s because you haven\u2019t met Beth.\u201d I didn\u2019t tell her about Beth\u2019s aneurysm. Beth thought her time was limited, and she didn\u2019t care about how the last part\u2014whether weeks or months or possibly years\u2014played out. She\u2019d been tied to that house, to Lily and Mariana and Julian, for forty years. She was done. At one in the morning that night, my cell phone rang. I was alone in bed\u2014Michael had an early flight to San Francisco in the morning\u2014and I was halfway between waking and sleeping. Winston was curled against my chest, kneading imaginary biscuits on my T-shirt, and he flattened his ears in annoyance when I reached over him and answered the phone. \u201cHi, Beth,\u201d I said. She only ever called me at one in the morning. \u201c \u2018An anonymous source\u2019?\u201d she said, not bothering with hello. \u201cDid they actually buy that? I don\u2019t know whether to be insulted or amused.\u201d \u201cTry both,\u201d I said, using one of Beth\u2019s own lines. She was talking about an article that had just run on CNN\u2019s website, in which I said that \u201can anonymous source\u201d had tipped me off to the possibility of Beth murdering her half sister in 1978. \u201cWhatever,\u201d Beth said, sounding more like the twenty-three-year-old she\u2019d been in the seventies instead of a woman who was over sixty. \u201cI also saw the 60 Minutes thing. Were you trying to pull at my heartstrings?\u201d The 60 Minutes piece was an interview with the wives and grown children of Thomas Armstrong and Paul Veerhoever about the devastation the murders had left in their lives. \u201cNo, that was all Michael,\u201d I said to Beth. \u201cI know better. You don\u2019t have a heart.\u201d \u201cNeither do you.\u201d I smiled, stroking Winston Purrchill\u2019s grumpy head. \u201cI have a heart, Beth. I just don\u2019t let you see it. How\u2019s Lily? I haven\u2019t seen her since she pushed me off a cliff.\u201d \u201cWhat a bitch you are,\u201d Beth said mildly. \u201cI knew it when I first saw you in that park, thinking you could follow me. I knew you\u2019d be a pain in my elderly ass.\u201d I leaned back against my pillows. \u201cIf I\u2019m such a pain in your ass, then why are you calling me?\u201d \u201cBecause Ransom is dead.\u201d I went quiet, staring into the darkness. I wondered what to feel. Sadness, anger, pity? Try all of them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, the phrase we all use when we can\u2019t think of what to say, one that provides no comfort at all. Beth was quiet for a long moment, and I realized she was collecting herself. I\u2019d never known her to have any kind of strong emotion, let alone one that made her speechless. I was witnessing it now. I waited. \u201cWell,\u201d Beth said at last, her voice tight. \u201cDon\u2019t think this means anything. There are other lawyers. He left me in the hands of his successor, in fact. I\u2019ve still got some fight in me. So what\u2019s your next move?\u201d \u201cYour DNA,\u201d I said. \u201cYou must have been so disappointed to find out they didn\u2019t take samples in 1977,\u201d Beth said. \u201cIt was blood type they looked at back then, not DNA. But they never even asked for my blood, because they had nothing to compare it to.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ll get it now,\u201d I said. \u201cMy lawyer is fighting that.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll lose.\u201d The first time we\u2019d had one of these middle-of-the night conversations, it had felt utterly strange. Beth and I were supposed to be enemies. I was trying to get her put away for murdering Lily. But she\u2019d call me, and we\u2019d spar like we had in her living room in the Greer mansion. I didn\u2019t know why we did this. I just knew it was instinctive for me. Beth understood my obsession with this case because she was the center of it and was as obsessed as I was. And, of course, there was Lily. No one knew Lily the way Beth and I did. No one had seen her, felt her presence, the way we had. It was impossible to explain, which made it so simple when I talked to someone I didn\u2019t have to explain it to. \u201cIs Joshua talking to you?\u201d I asked her. \u201cJoshua will never talk to me again,\u201d Beth said, \u201cbut you knew that already. How is he, by the way?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d I said. \u201cAngry and determined, but fine. He doesn\u2019t act like he\u2019s retired.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s because he isn\u2019t. On paper, yes, but otherwise, no. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve given him a new cause so he can do his white-knight act again. He was always happiest when he had a crusade.\u201d \u201cWhat did you do with the ashtray?\u201d I asked her. \u201cIt\u2019s still in the house. I\u2019ve tried to throw it away a dozen times, but Lily won\u2019t let me. It always comes back, and she moves it around the house. It was in the living room one day when you were here. You saw it.\u201d I remembered the ashtray I\u2019d seen, big and heavy. I\u2019d thought at the time it was the size of a child\u2019s head. Strange, because Beth didn\u2019t smoke. She had hit Lily with it so hard\u2014so hard. They must have found the marks on Lily\u2019s skull. \u201cYou never left town in all this time,\u201d I said. \u201cYou think I didn\u2019t try?\u201d Beth laughed without humor. \u201cI\u2019d pack my suitcase, and she would unpack it. I\u2019d throw things out, and she\u2019d bring them back. I got in the car a dozen times without any belongings except the clothes on my back, trying to run. I always ended up back at this house. You can believe me or not, but it\u2019s true.\u201d She paused. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do any of this, Shea. I know I\u2019m the villain here, and I accept that. But I\u2019ve paid and paid and paid. Prison might even be refreshing at this point. Do you know why I call you at one in the morning? Because despite everything, you\u2019re the only person I can talk to.\u201d I had just been thinking the same thing about her, but I wasn\u2019t about to admit it. \u201cGiving my name to the press was a nice touch,\u201d I said. \u201cHave I mentioned that you got me fired?\u201d \u201cBeing fired isn\u2019t the only thing you should thank me for.\u201d I sat up against my pillows. \u201cThank you? For what?\u201d \u201cFor waking you up\u2014all the way up. It\u2019s amazing what you can do when you stop sleepwalking through your own life, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I thought about my life now\u2014my writing career, my relationship with Michael, my new relationship with Esther. I was starting the process of getting my driver\u2019s license, and I had stopped hiding in my condo all the time. Still, I couldn\u2019t let Beth Greer take all the credit. \u201cYou didn\u2019t change my life, Beth. I did.\u201d \u201cDo you know what\u2019s interesting?\u201d Beth said, her tone imperious again, as if I hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cJoshua Black won\u2019t speak to me, but I saved his life. To this day, I think Lily would have killed him if she got the chance. Because Lily disappeared, he got to spend thirty years on the job catching criminals. Catching murderers. Like the man who tried to murder you.\u201d There was silence on the line. I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say. \u201cGood night, Shea,\u201d Beth said, and then the line went dead. \n CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN Eight Months Later Christmas Eve 2018 SHEA The day the story ended, I was standing in line at CVS, waiting to buy aspirin. It was raining. They said it was a winter storm, the rain ice-cold, the streets dangerous. The advice on the news was to stay home for Christmas, tuck in with your family, and don\u2019t leave the house. I had planned to do that\u2014I was about to spend the next two days with Michael, sipping wine and watching TV with Winston Purrchill on my lap. I\u2019d only leave to visit Esther and Will and my new nephew, Zach. It had been a wild, stressful, wonderful year, and I was going to unwind. I just needed some aspirin first, because no matter how much time passed, my knee and my elbow still ached. The line was six people deep, and I stared at nothing as I waited, thinking about the book I was writing. An agent had contacted me after the Rolling Stone article ran, and we\u2019d shopped a proposal to publishers. Four months later we had a deal, and now I had to write the rest of the book. Once this book about the Lady Killer case was finished, the publisher was already interested in hearing a pitch from me for another book, about a different case. Apparently, I was a true-crime writer and podcaster now instead of a doctor\u2019s receptionist. I still wasn\u2019t sure how that had happened. Everyone in line moved up, and my phone started buzzing silently in my purse. Whoever it was, I didn\u2019t feel like talking right now. My knee and my elbow were throbbing, and I wanted to go home. But my phone buzzed, then buzzed again. On the TV mounted on the wall, the man talking about the terrible weather was interrupted, and I heard the words \u201cBeth Greer.\u201d I looked up at the screen. A news anchor was talking. Beneath him was the headline: beth greer dead. \u201c. . . died suddenly and shockingly,\u201d the anchor said. \u201cMiss Greer\u2019s car was seen driving erratically on Claire Lake Road. When the car stopped and medics arrived, Miss Greer had already passed away. It\u2019s thought she had some kind of medical emergency, possibly a heart attack or a stroke, while driving. Beth Greer first came to fame here in Claire Lake when she was accused of being the so-called Lady Killer\u2014\u201d Everything went cold. My head spun. In my purse, my phone buzzed and buzzed. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d said the woman behind me in line. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d I walked to the counter. I put the box of aspirin down. Then I turned and left. Damn it, Beth, I thought as I walked unseeingly out of the store and into the parking lot. You and your goddamned aneurysm. I got soaked as I walked to my car, a sensible little Honda I\u2019d bought when I got my driver\u2019s license. The safest car I could buy, because no matter how much I vanquished her, deep down, part of me was still that terrified nine-year-old girl. Only yesterday I\u2019d gotten the news: The DNA from the body found at Claire Lake was a familial match to Beth. The woman\u2019s body, with violent blows to its skull, was Beth\u2019s relative. Beth had used every delay tactic her lawyer could come up with to put off giving a sample of her blood, but in the end she\u2019d given it. She had been buying time. The noose had been closing in on Beth. It was almost completely closed, in fact. But in the last moment, she\u2019d slipped away, this time for good. I got soaked by the rain as I fumbled for my keys. I dropped them, and I bent to the concrete, feeling for them with numb fingers. My hair was wet in my eyes, water dripping into my coat down the back of my neck. My broken elbow and my broken knee pulsed with old, unhealed pain. A headache pounded in my temples. I picked up the keys and mopped the water off my face as the rain came down harder and my teeth started to chatter. I finally opened the car and got in, slamming the door and sitting in silence as the rain pounded the roof. Where had Beth been going when it happened? The news said she\u2019d been on Claire Lake Road, which wound inland by the lake at the base of the cliffs. What was she doing there? Was she going to the place where she had left Lily\u2019s body? Had she been trying to escape again? I got in the car a dozen times without any belongings except the clothes on my back, trying to run. Had she known when it started happening, or had it all been too fast? Had there been pain? On the passenger seat next to me, my phone buzzed and buzzed. I could see the display where the phone had half slid from my purse: Michael. Esther. Joshua Black. Michael again. Beth Greer was dead. Months ago, I\u2019d gone to Anton Anders\u2019s parole hearing. Michael had gone with me. I didn\u2019t have to face Anders himself, but I\u2019d read my prepared statement to the parole board. I\u2019d told them that Anton Anders was a rapist and a murderer who had tried to kill me. The fact that it was over twenty years ago now didn\u2019t matter; what mattered was that I\u2019d almost died. What mattered was that if he went free now, I would never feel safe. I would go back to hiding in my condo, back to taking the bus. I\u2019d go back to living half a life, when the only thing I\u2019d done \u201cwrong\u201d was walk home from school. I\u2019d told them I didn\u2019t think that was justice. I\u2019d said that true fairness in the world wasn\u2019t possible, but letting Anton Anders have his freedom wasn\u2019t even close. I\u2019d said that it was a pretty simple decision to at least be more fair than that. They\u2019d denied his parole. The first person I wanted to call when I heard the news was Beth. It didn\u2019t make any sense, but there it was. I didn\u2019t call her, but she heard the news anyway. The next week, I got a package in the mail: a red shawl, old and well cared for, folded neatly in tissue paper. It took me a minute to realize it was the shawl Beth had worn the day she was acquitted, when she stood next to Ransom in front of all those reporters. The shawl from the photo that had gone on the cover of Life. Beth hadn\u2019t put a note with the shawl, but she didn\u2019t have to. She was telling me that she knew what victory felt like, especially when it was hard-won. I put the shawl in the closet, neatly tucked into its tissue paper, and I didn\u2019t tell anyone about it. Beth Greer was dead. She was a murderer. A bitch. A cipher. A lonely girl raised by a broken family. She was brave and manipulative and selfish, and I owed her. I hated that, but I did. I wondered if she\u2019d seen Lily at the end. Because when I drifted off to sleep at night, I still felt Lily\u2019s hands on me, and I still heard her voice, icy with death, in my ear: Let\u2019s go. I pushed my wet hair out of my eyes, started the car, and headed home. \n CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT February 2019 Someone new had bought the Greer mansion. Why not? It was a beautiful structure on a piece of Arlen Heights\u2019 prime real estate. It was a piece of Claire Lake history, now that Beth Greer was dead. The rumors that it was haunted only added to the mystique, and no one really believed that, anyway. It was true that Julian Greer had been murdered in the house, but that was in 1973\u2014too far back to seem real to the family that was moving in. It was rumored that Beth Greer had killed her own sister in the master bedroom, and she\u2019d died before they could prove it. But it didn\u2019t matter much. The couple who bought the place were in their thirties, their kids eight and ten. The seventies were a bygone era to them. The family had money\u2014lots of it. They had plans. All of Beth\u2019s dusty midcentury furniture was cleared out, sent to high-end consignment services to be sold to collectors. The old magazines and old ashtrays, Mariana\u2019s jar of cold cream and Julian\u2019s ties, were disposed of. Walls were going to be knocked out, and the living room and kitchen would become an open space. The old kitchen cupboards would come down, and stainless-steel appliances would make an appearance. A fence went up along the cliff to the ocean, and in spring a landscaping company would start digging to make a sleek stone patio for entertaining, with a retractable roof to keep out the rain. People would sip drinks and look out over the ocean in summer, making boisterous conversation as the kids ran in the yard. For a while, there were only workers coming and going in the house, handling everything: paint, pot lights, hardwood flooring. But once the house was livable\u2014and once the all-important fence went up\u2014the family moved in. For the first time in decades, the Greer mansion had life in it. Cars came and went. The kids went to school; the parents went to work. Friends and family visited. Weekends were nonstop, as the kids went to their friends\u2019 homes or had them over, and the adults ran errands. There were dinner parties and birthday parties and outings with grandparents. But at night, after the exhausted kids were asleep and the parents were drifting off, thinking about tomorrow\u2019s to-do list, there was a light in the window of a room upstairs. A soft light that moved, as if someone were pacing. Watching. Someone who never slept. Sometimes, there were two lights. The family never talked about the cold spots in the hallways, or the strange dreams they sometimes had about someone walking through the house. They never talked about the doors left open, or the feeling you often got, especially when you were home alone, that someone was just behind you. The little girl never told anyone about the footprints she saw in the dewy grass some mornings, as if someone had come to the living room windows and looked in. The little boy never told anyone about the time he woke up to find someone\u2014something\u2014holding his hand, holding it in an icy grip as he lay paralyzed on the bed. He always told himself he\u2019d dreamed that hand, though he never quite believed it. No one ever talked about why they never went near the cliffs, even when there was a fence protecting them, or why they preferred to keep the curtains over the floor-to-ceiling windows closed. They went about their lives without talking about the unnerving things, the dark things, about the house. And at night, while they slept, two strange lights burned in the darkness. \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS With every book, I owe thanks to my editor, Danielle Perez. With this book, gratitude doesn\u2019t cover it. She worked tirelessly to make this book the best it could be. It\u2019s possible she has read it as many times as I have by now, which is an incredible feat. I owe her an unending debt for her patience, expertise, and willingness to always dig a little deeper. Thank you so much, Danielle. Thanks to my agent, Pam Hopkins, who as always is a voice of reason in a crazy business. She is my rock. Thanks to my husband, Adam, who helps me with plot problems, makes sure I always have the time and space to write, and does a million small things for me. I would never have written my first book, or any book after it, without your partnership and support. Thanks to my sister, Nicole, and my brother, David. We had to lean on each other this year. I would be a wreck without both of you. Thanks to the marketing and publicity team at Berkley, including Fareeda Bullert, Jin Yu, Danielle Keir, Tara O\u2019Connor, and many others who do so much hard work putting my books into people\u2019s hands (or in front of their eyeballs). I appreciate everything you do. Thanks to the art department at Berkley, who go above and beyond to give me amazing covers. Thanks to the librarians and booksellers who recommend my books\u2014you are magic. Thanks to the bloggers and everyday readers who tell a friend, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta read this.\u201d Thanks to the readers who write me nice notes, which always tend to hit my inbox on my lowest days. Thanks to Molly and Stephanie, who talk me off the ledge over and over again, with every book. I\u2019m always happy when I can return the favor. Lastly, thank you to my mother, Suellen, who made me the woman I am and who passed in November 2020. I gave her an early copy of each of my books, but on release day she\u2019d still go to her local bookstore, buy a copy, and tell the sales clerk excitedly that she was buying her daughter\u2019s book. I was beyond lucky to have a mother so brilliant, brave, and loving. Thank you for everything, Mom. Rest well. \n Contents Cover Titles by Simone St. James Title Page Copyright Contents Dedication Part I Chapter One Chapter Two Chapter Three Chapter Four Chapter Five Chapter Six Chapter Seven Chapter Eight Chapter Nine Chapter Ten Chapter Eleven Chapter Twelve Chapter Thirteen Chapter Fourteen Chapter Fifteen Chapter Sixteen Chapter Seventeen Chapter Eighteen Chapter Nineteen Chapter Twenty Chapter Twenty-one Chapter Twenty-two Part II Chapter Twenty-three Chapter Twenty-four Chapter Twenty-five Chapter Twenty-six Chapter Twenty-seven Chapter Twenty-eight Chapter Twenty-nine Chapter Thirty Chapter Thirty-one Chapter Thirty-two Chapter Thirty-three Chapter Thirty-four Chapter Thirty-five Chapter Thirty-six Chapter Thirty-seven Chapter Thirty-eight Chapter Thirty-nine Chapter Forty Chapter Forty-one Chapter Forty-two Chapter Forty-three Chapter Forty-four Chapter Forty-five Chapter Forty-six Chapter Forty-seven Chapter Forty-eight Acknowledgments Readers Guide About the Author Landmarks Cover Cover Title Page Start Copyright Table of Contents Print Page List i ii iii iv v vi 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR Simone St. James is the New York Times bestselling author of The Sun Down Motel and The Broken Girls.
