The genomic landscape of 2,023 colorectal 
cancers
Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a common cause of mortality1, but a comprehensive 
description of its genomic landscape is lacking2–9. Here we perform whole-genome 
sequencing of 2,023 CRC samples from participants in the UK 100,000 Genomes 
Project, thereby providing a highly detailed somatic mutational landscape of  
this cancer. Integrated analyses identify more than 250 putative CRC driver genes, 
many not previously implicated in CRC or other cancers, including several 
recurrent changes outside the coding genome. We extend the molecular  
pathways involved in CRC development, define four new common subgroups of 
microsatellite-stable CRC based on genomic features and show that these groups 
have independent prognostic associations. We also characterize several rare 
molecular CRC subgroups, some with potential clinical relevance, including 
cancers with both microsatellite and chromosomal instability. We demonstrate a 
spectrum of mutational profiles across the colorectum, which reflect aetiological 
differences. These include the role of Escherichia colipks+ colibactin in rectal 
cancers10 and the importance of the SBS93 signature11–13, which suggests that diet 
or smoking is a risk factor. Immune-escape driver mutations14 are near-ubiquitous 
in hypermutant tumours and occur in about half of microsatellite-stable CRCs, 
often in the form of HLA copy number changes. Many driver mutations are 
actionable, including those associated with rare subgroups (for example, BRCA1 
and IDH1), highlighting the role of whole-genome sequencing in optimizing 
patient care.
CRC is the third most common malignancy worldwide1. CRC sequenc-
ing projects have been limited to a few hundred cases and/or based 
on whole exome or gene panel sequencing2–9. The full complement 
of genomic lesions and associations with clinical features have not 
been fully established. Patients with CRC (median age of 69 years at 
sampling, range 23–94 years, 59% male) were recruited by the Genom-
ics England 100,000 Genomes Project (100kGP) as detailed in the 
 
Methods. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on DNA 
from 2,023 flash-frozen tumour samples (100× depth) and paired blood 
samples (33× depth) (Methods and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). 
Sequenced cancer samples were primary carcinomas (n = 1,898), CRC 
metastases (n = 122) or recurrences (n = 3). The clinicopathological 
and molecular features of each cancer are available in a Genomic Data 
Table accessible in the 100kGP Research Environment (https://www.
genomicsengland.co.uk/research/research-environment).
 
Mutational processes and driver genes
We initially classified CRCs into the three established subtypes: 
MSI (microsatellite instability-positive, mismatch repair deficient; 
n = 364); POL (DNA polymerase ε proofreading-deficient; n =18); and 
MSS (microsatellite-stable; n = 1,641). All except three of the metas-
tasis samples were MSS (Methods). MSS cancers showed highly vari-
able ploidy, whereas most MSI and POL cancers were near-diploid. 
Single-base substitution (SBS), doublet-base substitution (DBS) and 
small insertion–deletion (indel) mutational signature activities were 
broadly concordant with published work12,15,16, albeit with some impor-
tant differences (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 3).
We identified a potentially important role in CRC for SBS93 (mostly 
TTA>TCA and T>G), the fourth most common SBS signature (around 
40% frequency in MSS primary tumours, but almost absent in MSI;

mean activity 29%, range 13–82%). SBS93 has been associated with 
oesophageal and gastric cancers (https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signa-
tures/sbs/sbs93/). Its presence in CRC has previously been noted11–13, 
but not accorded any significance. SBS93 showed transcriptional strand 
bias in our tumour samples (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon test), as it does in 
other cancers12, consistent with the action of transcription-coupled 
nucleotide excision repair on bulky DNA adducts caused by exogenous 
mutagens17. In MSS primary tumours, SBS93 co-occurred in a cluster 
with the signatures indel 14 (ID14; mostly insT in longer homopoly-
mers and insC; PBonferroni = 1.6 × 10–150), SBS2 (TCN>TTN, APOBEC), SBS13 
(TCN>TGN, APOBEC), SBS18 (C>A, oxidative damage), DBS2 (CC>AA, 
tobacco and aldehydes) and DBS4 (GC>AA, TC>AA) (Supplementary 
Table 3 and Extended Data Fig. 1c). Co-occurrence relationships for 
other signatures are described in Supplementary Result 1.
Driver gene identification at the base-pair level18 was performed 
separately in MSS primary, MSI (all primary), POL (all primary) and MSS 
metastasis CRCs to account for different background mutation rates 
(Methods). Overall, 193 putative CRC driver genes were detected using 
this strategy (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 4 
and 5), with totals of 89, 96, 49 and 39, respectively in the four groups. 
In total, 57 drivers were identified in more than one group, leaving 136 
present in a single group (44, 57, 27 and 8, respectively). Many of the 
candidate driver genes had not previously been reported in any cancer 
and others were new to CRC2–9.
Known CRC driver genes were generally mutated at reported frequen-
cies. As expected given previous exome sequencing studies, all new 
MSS-specific coding drivers were low frequency (0.9–3.9%) and often 
with hotspot mutations (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary 
Result 2). By contrast, several of the new MSI drivers were relatively 
common, and were detectable in up to 50% of MSI tumours. Their iden-
tification was probably a reflection, in part, of the large sample size, 
but also of improved indel mutation calling compared with previous 
studies7. A prime example is the BAX tumour suppressor gene (TSG) 
(Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 and Supplementary Result 2).
Biological mechanisms highlighted by new drivers (Supplementary 
Table 4) included existing pathways, such as WNT and TGFβ–BMP, and 
less expected functions, such as RNA regulation (ZC3H13 and ZC3H4) 
and transcriptional control (for example, the transcription factors 
GTF2IRD2, MITF, MLF1, NCOA1, OLIG2, PRDM16, RUNX1, RUNX1T1, TCF12 
and TCF3). Multiple members of the same family or pathway were fre-
quently mutated. For example, several RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK and other 
MAP kinase pathway genes were MSS tumour drivers, including not 
only established ‘major drivers’ (KRAS, NRAS or BRAF) but also several 
‘minor drivers’, including five MAP2 or MAP3 kinase genes, mostly 
involved in JUN kinase activation and signalling to MEK19 (Fig. 1a and 
Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). Other minor RAS pathway drivers included 
the RAS activator RASGRF1 (RhoGEF domain mutations), RAF1 (hotspot 
p.Ser257Leu) and the RAS suppressor RASA1, and an exemplar new MSI 
driver, the GTPase RGS12 (Supplementary Result 3 and Supplementary 
Table 7). None of the minor RAS or MAP kinase drivers (Supplementary 
Table 4) was mutually exclusive with an established major RAS driver. 
Moreover, there was no association between the presence of major 
and minor RAS pathway drivers (odds ratio (OR) = 1.07, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) = 0.79–1.45, P = 0.73, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test, n = 1,521 
MSS primary tumours). Finally, there was no evidence that minor RAS 
drivers could substitute for a major driver (mean minor RAS driver 
frequency of 0.12 in tumours with a major RAS driver compared with 
0.13 without a major RAS driver, P = 0.58, two-tailed t-test, n = 1,521 MSS 
primary tumours). These data therefore suggest that the minor RAS 
and MAP kinase drivers act as modifiers of major RAS drivers and/or 
in a different branch of the MAP kinase pathway.
MSS tumours typically had four pathogenic driver mutations, 
whereas primary MSI and POL tumours had 23 and 30, respectively 
(P = 2.6 × 10−198, two-sided Kruskal–Wallis test; Extended Data Fig. 2a and 
Supplementary Table 8). Thirty genes were drivers in both MSS and MSI 
cancers, which emphasized the shared roles of WNT, RAS–RAF–MEK–
ERK, PI3K, TGFβ–BMP, TP53 and chromatin remodelling across CRC 
subtypes (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Other drivers were subtype-specific, 
yet indicated functional defects shared between MSS and MSI tumours, 
including genes that provided alternative ways of dysregulating the 
same pathways (Supplementary Tables 4–7). For example, TGFβ–BMP 
signalling was mostly inactivated by co-SMAD SMAD4 mutations in 
MSS cancers, but by one or more indel receptor mutations (TGFBR2, 
ACVR2A, BMPR2 and ACVR1B) in MSI cancers. Similarly, BAX mutations 
provided a biological alternative to TP53 mutations in MSI tumours. 
Marked functional dissimilarities between MSS and MSI tumours were 
also found. For example, 12 MSI-specific drivers were annotated to 
immune functions compared with just 1 MSS-specific driver (detailed 
below). With the caveats of different sample sizes and mutational pro-
cesses, the principal factors that underlie differences between MSS 
and MSI drivers were that the latter are subject to stronger selection 
for immune escape and can tolerate multiple and/or non-canonical 
changes in driver pathways (Supplementary Tables 4–6).
The identification of driver mutations remains subject to uncertainty, 
especially in hypermutant cancers and poor-quality samples. Of nearly 
1,000 CRC drivers reported by other studies of primary CRC2–9,20, we 
only replicated 68 (7%) (Supplementary Table 9). Careful validation 
and functional assessment of our new putative drivers by other studies 
are similarly essential.
Structural and copy number variants
Simple structural variants (SVs), inter-chromosomal transloca-
tions and complex SVs were identified using a consensus approach16  
(Methods). Nine SV signatures were extracted across the cohort 
(Fig. 1b). SV8 (unbalanced inversions) and SV9 (unbalanced translo-
cations) had not previously been identified in CRC.
Using simulation, 45 non-fragile SV hotspots (regarded as candi-
date driver changes) were found in MSS primary tumours and 3 in 
MSI tumours (Q < 0.05, one-sided permutation test; Fig. 1c, Extended 
Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 10). Previously reported SV hot-
spots in MSS primary cancers included deletions (for example, APC, 
PTEN, SMAD4 and TP53), amplifications (for example, IGF2, MYC and 
RASL11A regulatory element) and fusions (for example, EIF3E–RSPO2 
and PTPRK–RSPO3)4,7,8,21. Fusions involving the kinase domain of pre-
viously reported partner genes were identified in 0.4% and 4.1% of 
MSS and MSI cancers, respectively22 (8 NTRK1, 6 BRAF, 2 ALK, 1 NTRK3 
and 1 RET; Supplementary Table 11). Focal TP53 deletions previously 
observed in osteosarcoma and prostate carcinoma16 were found in 
2.4% of MSS primary tumours. A region on 17q23.1 containing VMP1, 
previously reported in breast cancer and pancreatic cancer23,24, was 
deleted in 1.2% of MSS primary tumours. Recurrent intronic deletions 
at 19p13.12 included a regulatory element interacting with the BRD4 
promoter25. TET2 (0.8%) was a potential target of previously unknown 
4q24 rearrangements, given its driver status in our POL cancers and 
a role in haematological malignancies26. EZH2 was a credible target of 
a newly identified 7q31.2 deletion, given that low EZH2 expression is 
associated with poor CRC prognosis27. In MSI cancers, we confirmed 
recurrent 11p15.1 deletions that encompass the MSI driver CDKN1C28, 
and six new SV hotspots. In MSS primary cancers, there was enrichment 
of complex SVs at locations with arm-level copy number alterations 
(CNAs), which indicated a common causal origin (Supplementary 
 
Table 12).
We analysed extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA)29 to distinguish as far 
as possible truly circular ecDNA molecules from those characterized by 
breakage–fusion–bridge (BFB) cycles. ecDNA content differed by CRC 
type, with 28% (380 out of 1,354) of MSS primary tumours containing 
≥1 predicted circular ecDNA compared with 1.4% (4 out of 292) MSI, 
0% (0 out of 10) POL and 36% (38 out of 105) metastatic MSS tumours 
(P < 0.001, MSS primary compared with MSI, two-sided Kruskal–Wallis

test; Extended Data Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 13). MSS pri-
mary tumours with ecDNA were more likely to exhibit chromothrip-
sis (P = 1.09 × 10–12, OR = 2.43, two-sided Fisher’s exact test), a result 
consistent with previous reports30. In MSS primary tumours, only 5% 
(34 out of 665) of oncogene amplifications (total copy number ≥ 5 in 
diploid tumours, ≥10 in tetraploid tumours) mapped to circular ecDNA. 
However, circular DNA was implicated in 14 out of 74 amplifications 
at MYC and 8 out of 15 at ERBB2. Our findings suggest that oncogene 
amplification through circularized ecDNA in CRC has only a modest 
role compared with other cancer types.

Fig. 1 | Driver genes and structural variants in CRC. a, The most commonly 
mutated driver genes based on separate analyses of SNVs, small indels and 
other base-level changes in the MSS primary, MSI, POL and MSS metastasis 
sets. Genes with the highest oncogenic mutation frequencies across the entire 
cohort are shown in rank order (most frequent on the right). For driver gene 
discovery, CRC drivers had previously been identified in any CRC cohort  
(or cohorts)18, whereas other cancer drivers had previously been identified only  
in non-CRC or multicancer cancer cohorts2,18. The remaining drivers were 
considered new. Mutation role (loss of function (LOF), activating, unknown or 
ambiguous) was assigned considering previous curation18 and predictions by 
this study. Conflicts or uncertainty were termed ambiguous. The percentage  
of tumours with a pathogenic mutation in the MSS primary (n = 1,521), MSI 
(n = 360) and POL (n = 16) cohorts are shown. Drivers identified in a specific 
cohort are in cells with a black border. Number mutated represents all tumours 
with a pathogenic mutation across all three cohorts. Also shown are: the 
percentage of tumours with biallelic mutations including LOH; status as a 
putative SV and/or focal CNA driver; and discriminant genes in the MSS primary 
cluster analysis. See also Extended Data Fig. 2. b, Nine SV signatures by 
underlying SV type in MSS primary, MSI and POL CRCs (n = 1,898). Horizontal 
coloured bars represent the contribution of each SV type to each signature.  
c, Significant simple SV hotspots identified in MSS primary CRCs (n = 1,354). 
Numbers of tumours with a SV at each genomic location (1 Mb regions) are 
coloured by the underlying type. Hotspots (excluding fragile sites) identified 
at Q < 0.05 (one-sided permutation test) are annotated with cytoband, the 
number of genes contained (in parentheses) and any candidate gene 
(Supplementary Table 10). Simple SVs comprise ≤2 individual rearrangements. 
Unclassified SVs could not be identified clearly as a deletion, tandem duplication, 
inversion or translocation.

Overall, 1,765 (87%) CRC samples passed quality control filters for 
CNA analysis (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 4a–d). The median CNA 
burden was 36 (range of 0–378) and the median estimated ploidy was 
2.26 (range of 1.43–6.41). CNAs were uncommon in MSI and POL can-
cers, as expected. Whole-genome duplication (WGD)31 was identified 
in 45.0%, 5.8% and 10.0% of MSS primary, MSI and POL cancers, respec-
tively. Within the MSS primary group, WGD most strongly co-occurred 
with TP53 mutation32 and chromosome 13q gain, and with the absence 
of KRAS and PIK3CA mutations (P < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test). We found 
six CNA signatures (Supplementary Table 14), of which CN17 (n = 260, 
tandem duplication and HRD))33 had not previously been reported in 
CRC. All the identified signatures, except CN1 (diploidy), were enriched 
in MSS tumours. We found all previously reported, recurrent arm-level 
CNAs and whole chromosome changes (that is, events >50% of the 
total arm size)7,31 (Supplementary Table 15). Arm-level increased copy 
number typically involved single-copy or double-copy gains, with the 
exception of 20q, which gained four or more copies in 18% of MSS pri-
mary cancers (Extended Data Fig. 4d).
In total, 16 arm-level gains and 13 deletions were above background 
frequencies in MSS primary cancers, and we regarded these as candi-
date driver changes (Supplementary Table 15). Although MSI and POL 
cancers were mostly near-diploid, 17 arm-level CNAs (for example, 
gains of 7, 9, 12q and 14q and losses of 21q) were present in MSI cancers 
at levels above background. We identified a set of focal CNAs ≤3 Mb 
(Supplementary Table 16), and mapped minimal common regions 
shared between larger CNAs34. Previously reported focal CNAs in MSS 
primary cancers included single-copy and double-copy gains involving 
CCND1, ERBB2, MYC and KLF5, and deletions of ARID1A, SMAD4 and 
APC7,31 (Supplementary Table 17). Although 5p15.33 (TERT) amplification 
was detected in 13 MSS cancers, we found no association with telomere 
length (TelomereHunter P = 0.78, Telomerecat P = 0.51, two-sided 
Kruskal–Wallis test)35. The following new focal CNAs were identified: 
5q13.1 deletions (29%; PIK3R1); 15q11.2 deletions (42%; containing the 
lncRNA PWRN1, a tumour suppressor in gastric cancer2); and amplifi-
cation at 6p21.1 (28%) and 6p25.3 (25%), which may target CCND3 and 
NEDD9, respectively, genes that we also identified as putative drivers 
(Supplementary Table 4). There was shared causal overlap between 
CNAs and SVs, especially on chromosomes 8, 17, 18 and 20 (Extended 
Data Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Result 4).
Combined analysis of putative drivers
By combining small substitutions and indels, SVs and focal CNAs, we 
identified 201 putative driver genes (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Most 
candidate SV target genes were annotated to the locations of drivers 
found in the small-scale mutation analysis. About 7% of driver genes 
principally affected by indels and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) 
were also mutated by SVs, the latter typically constituting 1–4% of all 
mutations. The overlap between the sets of drivers affected by both 
small-scale mutations and CNAs was also strong, in part owing to second 
hits at TSGs. Evidence of two hits (Supplementary Table 18) was found 
for up to 90% of ‘classical’ tumour suppressor mutations (for example, 
APC, SMAD4 and TP53), 75% of immune-escape drivers and 50% of the 
new RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK–MAP kinase drivers. However, the median 
second-hit rate across drivers was only 10%, and most new drivers did 
not adhere to a classical two-hit TSG model (albeit some were prob-
ably oncogenes). Almost no known or putative oncogenes showed 
clear evidence of second hits by amplification.
Pathway analysis of the putative CRC drivers using EnrichR36 identi-
fied many gene sets strongly associated with tumorigenesis and/or CRC 
pathogenesis (Supplementary Table 19). Almost all CRCs had changes 
in WNT, and most had changes in TGFβ–BMP, ERRB–RAS–RAF–MEK–
ERK and p53 (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 4f). Other pathways involved 
less common drivers, including wider MAP kinase, NOTCH, chromatin 
 
regulation and transcriptional control (Supplementary Table 19). 
 
We found only limited evidence of new driver genes directly involved 
in DNA repair or hypermutation. Many tumour drivers or other molec-
ular features were potentially clinically actionable (Supplementary 
Result 5 and Supplementary Tables 20–22).
Several signatures co-occurred with specific driver mutations 
(Extended Data Fig. 2b). In some cases, shared over-representation 
in MSS, MSI or POL cancers was the probable cause. Other pairwise 
relationships probably causally linked to each other included those 
between TP53 and multiple copy number signatures, and between 
ATM and SV1.
Finding common and rare CRC subgroups
To search for molecular subgroups of CRC based on genomic features, 
hierarchical clustering was performed using 304 molecular and clini-
cal variables (Methods). Based on cancers with available CNA data, we 
found six stable clusters of 1,000 primary, treatment-naive tumours: 
MSI; POL; and four MSS clusters. We denoted the MSS clusters as WGD-A 
(24% of primary treatment-naive MSS), WGD-B (40%), genome sta-
ble (GS; 21%) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH; 15%). WGD frequencies 
in the MSS clusters were 97%, 99%, 14% and 0%, respectively (Figs. 1a  
and 2, Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 23). SNV and indel 
burdens of all MSS clusters were distinct from MSI and POL tumours. 
Both WGD clusters showed hallmarks of chromosomal instability (CIN). 
Specifically, they showed higher numbers of SV and CNA events, higher 
LOH and increased numbers of events attributed to copy number 
 
signatures CN6 (chromothripsis) and CN17 (arm-level LOH followed 
by two genome doubling events). Large fractions of these tumours 
had whole chromosome or arm-level losses (mean number of arms 
lost per tumour of 9.8).
MSS-WGD-A tumours had higher SNV and indel burdens and mark-
edly higher numbers of events attributed to SBS93, ID14, DBS7 and SV 
signatures 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 9 (Supplementary Table 23). They also had 
increased frequencies of BRAF mutations, which were also strongly 
associated with MSI cancers. The second WGD cluster (MSS-WGD-B) 
was the largest, and might be regarded as ‘canonical’ MSS cancers. It 
was enriched relative to other cancers for distal location, SBS18 and 
the E. colipks+ signatures SBS88 and ID18, although not for any specific 
driver mutation (except the rare driver MITF).
MSS-GS cancers showed few events associated with CIN (that is, 
predicted near-diploid karyotype, low levels of LOH, SVs, CNAs and 
arm-level losses (mean number of arms lost per tumour of 2.3). This 
cluster had the fewest TP53 mutations (6%), a result consistent with a 
role for p53 in preventing multiple types of CIN, but the largest frac-
tions of KRAS mutations (83%) and SBS18 activity (97%). The remaining 
cluster, MSS-LOH, showed an unusual form of CIN characterized by 
focal and arm-level LOH (and hence high CN9 activity), with interme-
diate SV, CNA and LOH burdens, and low SNV and indel burdens. In 
some respects, MSS-GS cancers resembled MSI cancers with respect to 
proximal location, near-diploid genomes and shared driver genes such 
as TGFBR2, ACVR2A and ARID1A (Fig. 2a), but there was no increased 
mutation burden (Extended Data Fig. 5). Patients with MSS-GS cancer 
had longer overall survival than other MSS cancers, and this cluster was 
an independent better prognostic factor, alongside worse prognosis 
associated with higher stage, greater age and proximal location in 
multivariable survival analysis of the entire patient set (Extended Data 
Fig. 5e and Supplementary Result 6).
Rare cancer subgroups can also provide important insights into 
tumorigenesis, as exemplified by POLE driver mutations7. These 
occur in only 1–2% of CRCs but are associated with an exceptionally 
high mutational burden and good prognosis37. Our patient sample 
size provided an opportunity to identify or characterize other less 
common molecular subgroups of CRC (Extended Data Fig. 6 and 
Supplementary Result 7). We focused on five such rare subgroups: 
(1) subclonal driver mutations, notably parallel evolution of SMAD4

mutations and 18q deletions (Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary 
 
Table 24); (2) activating CTNNB1 driver mutations that show complex 
co-occurrence relationships with other WNT drivers and almost all 
undergo loss of the wild-type allele, despite being dominant oncogenec 
alleles (Extended Data Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 18); (3) MSI 
cancers with highly chromosomally unstable genomes (Extended Data 
Fig. 6c); (4) BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutant cancers and their associated, 
potentially targetable HRD (Extended Data Fig. 6d); and (5) patients who 
had received previous radiotherapy for prostate cancer, a risk factor for 
CRC38, showing the absence in most cases of radiotherapy-associated 
signature ID8 (Extended Data Fig. 6e).

Fig. 2 | Identification of MSS primary CRC molecular subgroups by cluster 
analysis. a, Heatmap of the six clusters identified by consensus clustering for  
a subset of variables that showed a significant difference (false discovery rate 
(FDR) < 0.05) between the MSS clusters. The single cluster analysis is split into 
two parts for better visualization. Top, subtype (MSS primary, MSI and POL), 
WGD status, age at sampling, sex, Dukes stage, site, immune-escape status, 
genes, mutation burdens and signatures. Bottom, subtype, WGD status, purity, 
ploidy, fraction LOH and copy number states. Values for mutation burdens 
(SNV, indel, SV, CNA) and signatures (SBS, DBS, ID, SV and CN) are ranked and 
scaled to lie between 0 and 1. Driver gene mutations are shown by gene name. 
Chromosome arm-level changes are shown by 1–22 and X. b, Summary of 
significant and other selected associations between molecular features and 
MSS primary clusters relative to the entire MSS primary group. Circle size 
shows FDR, diamonds indicate non-significance (FDR > 0.05). For categorical 
variables measured as the proportion of tumours (for example, signature 
presence, immune escape), a heatmap scale between 0 and 1 is used. 
Quantitative variables each have a bespoke scale, as shown. Full data are  
shown in Supplementary Table 23. No significant difference between clusters 
(FDR > 0.05) was found for many variables, mostly those with a low frequency  
in MSS primary tumours. Notable moderate-frequency molecular variables 
without a significant association with cluster group included signatures DBS6 
and SV5 and driver mutations in FBXW7, SMAD4 and PTEN. There was also no 
significant association with microbiome diversity or prevalence of the top 20 
bacterial genera.

depending on the HLA haplotype of the patient (Methods). We con-

(Fig. 3b–d). Indeed, driver mutations were enriched in patients in whom 
they had a low immunogenic potential. Moreover, loss of HLA allele 
function through mutation or LOH reduced the immunogenicity of 
driver mutations (Fig. 3e). Differential immunogenicity analysis (that 
is, comparing the predicted immunogenicity of driver gene mutations 
in cancers with those mutations versus those without those mutations) 
identified five driver genes (BRAF, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS) that 
had significantly higher mutation frequencies (PBonferroni < 0.1; Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test) in patients in whom their immunogenicity was predicted 
to be lower (Fig. 3f). Collectively, these observations are consistent 
with the idea that immune editing influences the driver landscape. 
However, the finding that the most common KRAS mutations are also 
more antigenic (Extended Data Fig. 7a) suggests that in some cases, 
direct positive selection can outweigh immunogenicity.
Several driver genes, especially in MSI and POL tumours, had a puta-
tive role in immunity and inflammation (Supplementary Table 4), spe-
cifically immune escape. As per other studies, patterns and prevalence 
of immune escape differed by CRC subtype4,14,41,42 (Fig. 3g). We sepa-
rately evaluated allelic imbalance, LOH and protein-altering mutations 
in the HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C (MHC type I) genes and somatic muta-
tions in a core set of other antigen-presenting or antigen-processing 
genes (APGs: PSME3, PSME1, ERAP2, TAP2, ERAP1, HSPBP1, PDIA3, 
CALR, B2M, PSME2, PSMA7, IRF1, CANX, TAP1 and CIITA). Of these 
genes, TAP2, B2M, IRF1, TAP1, HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C were formally 
and independently classed as CRC drivers, with strongest signals in 
MSI cancers, but also discovered in MSS cancers (for example, HLA-A 
and B2M) (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Table 4). Multivariate regression 
analysis that accounted for clinical characteristics and TMB revealed 
that in MSS cancers, tumours with immune-escape mutations had a 
higher predicted neoantigen burden (P < 0.001; Fig. 3h). This associa-
tion was present across all mechanisms of immune escape, but the 
HLA (type I) mutation had the strongest effect (associated with 21% 
increase in burden compared with HLA wild-type; P = 0.001). Con-
versely, in MSI cancers, only protein-altering mutations of HLA and 
other APGs were associated with higher neoantigen burden (P = 0.002 
and P =1 × 10−5 respectively, Wilcoxon test), with an APG mutation 
corresponding to a 35% increase in the neoantigen burden. Immune 
escape from any mechanism remained significantly associated with 
neoantigen burden in multivariate regression (P = 0.012; Extended 
Data Fig. 7b). In MSI cancers, previous treatment (n = 34) was asso-
ciated with an increased neoantigen burden independent of overall 
TMB (P = 0.006), a finding potentially linked to the genetic immune 
escape detected in 33 out of 34 treated MSI cancers.
Beyond the coding nuclear genome
To illustrate the utility of WGS in analysing features outside coding 
regions of the cancer genome, we performed five exemplar studies 
(details in Supplementary Result 8): (1) an exploration of driver muta-
tions in regulatory noncoding elements (Supplementary Table 25); 
 
(2) recurrent, focal copy number changes and SVs outside fragile sites 
and gene bodies (Extended Data Fig. 6f and Supplementary Tables 12 
and 16); (3) splice site driver mutations in APC and SMAD4 (Supple-
mentary Table 26); (4) the mitochondrial genome (Supplementary 
Table 27); and (5) the CRC-associated microbiome (Extended Data 
Fig. 8, Supplementary Tables 28–30 and Supplementary Result 9). 
A particularly promising finding in the noncoding human genome 
comprised recurrent, focal copy number deletions (chromosome 17: 
72429007–72450223) in MSI tumours, involving the lincRNA 
LINC00673 (also known as LINC00511), a transcript that interacts 
with the CRC driver genes EZH2 and PTPN11 (Supplementary Table 16). 
This region overlapped with a SV deletion hotspot (chromosome 17: 
72228421–72770582) in MSS primary tumours that includes a noncod-
ing regulatory element that interacts with the promoter of the nearby 
CRC driver SOX9 (Extended Data Fig. 6f and Supplementary Table 10).
MSS CRC genomes by anatomical location
CRC is often said to comprise several different diseases depending 
on the tumour location43. As location co-varies with MSI status, we 
assessed the genomic features of MSS primary CRCs from different 
sites in the bowel. Tumours from distal locations had greater num-
bers of SVs and CNAs but fewer SNVs and indels (Fig. 4 and Supple-
mentary Tables 31 and 32). Higher SBS8 and lower SBS1, SBS5, SBS18, 
ID1 and ID2 activities were also observed in cancers from distal sites44 
(PBonferroni < 0.05, linear regression; Fig. 4, Extended Data Fig. 9a,c and 
Supplementary Table 32). The burden of E. colipks+ and colibactin sig-
nature ID18 (but not SBS88) was higher in distal CRCs (P = 4 × 10–10, 
two-sided Wilcoxon test), a result consistent with healthy colon10  
(Methods).
Distal MSS cancers were typified by higher frequencies of TP53 muta-
tions and lower frequencies of AMER1, BRAF, KRAS and PIK3CA muta-
tions9 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 33). Arm-level deletions of 14q, 
18p and 18q also occurred more frequently in distal cancers (Fig. 4 and 
Supplementary Table 34), as did focal deletions of 1p36.11, 18q21.2, 
18q22.3 and 20q13.33 gain. In part reflecting these specific changes, 
MSS cluster subgroups also showed associations with anatomical loca-
tion (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 23). The 
overall proportions of MSS-WGD-A, MSS-WGD-B and MSS-LOH tumours 
increased from the caecum to the rectum, whereas MSS-GS tumours 
were relatively common in the proximal colon.
Alongside the trend in indels, there was a decreasing trend in neoan-
tigen burden from the caecum to the rectum (Extended Data Fig. 7b–e). 
There was no significant site-specific difference in the overall preva-
lence of immune-escape mutations (43% rectum, 39% distal colon, 38% 
proximal colon, P = 0.20, two-sided Kruskal–Wallis test, n = 1,019 MSS 
primary tumours). However, in rectal cancers, there was a higher preva-
lence of HLA LOH (P = 0.04, χ2). In a multivariate regression analysis 
including TMB and other patient co-variables, the distal colorectum 
was independently associated with lower neoantigen burden (Extended 
Data Fig. 7b), which suggested a higher level of immunoediting 
 
(Pdistal colon = 9 × 10–7, Prectum = 2 × 10–4; two-sided test).
Driver gene discovery in CRC subgroups
As driver mutation frequencies varied along the bowel, we searched for 
location-specific driver genes based on a set of developmentally or clini-
cally based anatomical subdivisions of the large bowel. We identified 
48 drivers not found by our main analysis, most of which were detected 
in only a single location (Extended Data Fig. 2c and Supplementary 
Table 35). Nine of these drivers were previously unknown to any cancer 
and 35 were new drivers in CRC. These genes included ETV1, detected 
in the distal colon and previously proposed as a target of enhancer 
mutations in CRC25; the WNT transcription factor LEF1 (proximal colon); 
NOTCH2, long proposed to have a role in CRC pathogenesis (distal 
colorectum)45; the oncogene SRC (distal colorectum); the PI3K–mTOR 
signalling molecule TFEB (rectum); and the EGFR signalling component 
DDR2 (proximal colon).
Because the frequencies of some driver genes varied significantly 
among MSS clusters, we reasoned that cluster-specific drivers might 
exist. Exploratory driver discovery in each of the 4 cluster subgroups 
identified 35 additional candidate drivers (Supplementary Table 36). 
These included four genes detected in two subgroups (BRCA2, COL1A1, 
PTPRT and SMARCA4) and other strong candidates such as ACVR1, 
NOTCH1 and POT1.
Molecular correlates of early-onset CRC
Recent reports of an increase in early-onset CRCs46,47 are currently 
unexplained. We found that individuals with Mendelian syndromes 
or somatic POLE mutations presented earlier in life (median age of

60 years at sampling, range 34–79 years, P = 0.0015, Wilcoxon test), 
as expected37. SNV and SV burden were not correlated with age, but 
in MSS cancers, indel burden was highest in the youngest and oldest 
patients (<45 years old, mean = 13,428; 45–75 years old, mean = 12,328; 
>75 years old, mean = 13,906; P < 0.05, pair-wise Wilcoxon tests against 
the 45–75-year-old group) (Fig. 4, Extended Data Fig. 9b,c and Sup-
plementary Table 32). Younger patient age was associated with lower 
activities of SBS1, SBS5 and ID1 (clock-like signatures) and SBS18 
(reactive oxygen species)15,48. By contrast, SBS89, SBS93 and ID14 
activities were higher in younger patients. The association between 
SBS93 and earlier age was strong (multiple regression, P = 3.3 × 10–7, 
two-sided test), and accounted for a younger presentation of about 
5 years. Similar to SBS93, SBS89 has unknown aetiology, although it 
has been reported to occur in healthy colon tissue during the first dec-
ade of life44. Younger age also correlated with lower SOX9 pathogenic 
mutation frequency in MSS primary cancers. In primary MSI cancers, 
frequencies of BRAF and RNF43 mutations were lower in younger 
patients, with correspondingly higher APC frequency (P < 0.05, 
two-sided Wilcoxon test; Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 33).

providing a comprehensive set of mutations of all types, a principal 
strength of our study is the ability to detect uncommon features, as 
evidenced by the discovery of many new driver genes, including SNVs, 
small indels, SVs and CNAs. Although some rare driver mutations might 
have uncertain driver status or weakly promote tumorigenesis, others 
may have considerable relevance, especially if they are known drivers in 
other cancer types or overlap functionally with other rare drivers that 
 
collectively form a higher frequency group.
In addition to the discovery of driver genes, several new insights into 
CRC genomics and biology were obtained (Supplementary Note). We 
showed that the large MSS group of CRCs is not a homogenous entity 
by clustering it into four common subgroups with distinct molecu-
lar and clinicopathological features. We also discovered and better 
characterized rare CRC subgroups, including MSI CIN CRCs, cancers 
with parallel evolution of copy number and SNV driver mutations, 
and tumours with putative noncoding driver mutations. We found 
new mutational signatures in CRC and molecular features associated 
with early-onset disease or tumour location in the large bowel, the 
latter showing that proximal MSS CRCs share some features with MSI 
tumours. We showed evidence of immune editing of driver mutations 
and frequent immune-escape mutations, especially in MSI and POL 
hypermutant cancers. All these results have potential clinical impli-
cations or utility. We anticipate that our work will fuel future studies, 
including efforts to characterize putative driver genes, translational 
analyses and multidisciplinary experiments to address specific ques-
tions in a focused fashion.

Methods
Sample collection
The following steps were taken for sample collection. (1) Ethics 
approval was provided to the 100kGP by the HRA Committee East of 
England–Cambridge South research ethics committee (REC refer-
ence 14/EE/1112). Samples were obtained as part of the 100kGP cancer 
programme, an initiative for high-throughput tumour sequencing for 
NHS patients with cancer49,50. (2) Thirteen Genomic Medicine Centres 
(GMCs) were established by the NHS and 100kGP, each with multiple 
affiliated hospitals across in the same region of the UK. (3) Patients 
undergoing resection for CRC were identified by specialist nurses 
and other staff. (4) All patients provided written informed consent, 
and blood samples were taken. (5) Tumour samples were assessed in 
histopathology cut-ups. Associated clinicopathological data were 
obtained from health records. (7) Frozen tumour sub-samples were 
taken and frozen. Haematoxylin and eosin sections were assessed for 
purity and other histological features of note. (8) Blood and tumour 
samples that passed quality control were sent for DNA extraction in 
regional genetics laboratories. (9) DNA was transferred to the 100kGP 
central national biorepositry. (10) WGS of paired tumour-constitutional 
(whole blood-derived) DNA was performed by Illumina. (11) Processed 
BAM files were transferred to Genomics England for additional pro-
cessing, quality checking and data storage. (12) All sequencing and 
clinicopathological data were transferred to Colorectal Cancer Domain 
(GECIP) for further quality control and data analysis.
WGS and SV calling
Sequencing, mapping and variant calling were generally performed as 
previously described51, although we used a less stringent variant allele 
frequency (VAF) to enable analyses of subclonal mutations.
Sequencing and alignment. Samples were prepared using an Illu-
mina TruSeq DNA PCR-free library preparation kit and sequenced on 
a HiSeq X, generating 150 bp paired-end reads. Tumour and consti-
tutional DNAs were sequenced to average depths of 100× and 33×, 
respectively. Poor sequencing quality outliers were identified using 
principal component analysis and removed on the basis of the following 
quality metrics: percentage of mapped reads; percentage of chimeric 
DNA fragments; average insert size; AT/CG dropout; and unevenness 
of local coverage. Illumina’s North Star pipeline (v.2.6.53.23) was used 
for the primary WGS analysis. Sequence reads were aligned to the Homo 
sapiens GRCh38Decoy assembly using Isaac (v.03.16.02.19)52. Overall, 
PCR-free tumour and germline sequencing data for 2,492 fresh-frozen 
CRC samples were obtained from the 100kGP main program (v.8) 
 
release and used in our analysis.
Single-nucleotide variant and indel calling. Single-nucleotide variant 
and small indel calling was performed using Strelka (v2.4.7). In addi-
tion to the default Strelka filters, we applied the following exclusion 
 
filters:
•	Variants with a germline allele frequency > 1% in the full Genomics 
England dataset.
•	Variants with a population germline allele frequency > 1% in the 
 
gnomAD database53.
•	Somatic variants with frequency > 5% in the Genomics England cancer 
dataset. A 5% cut-off was chosen based on the frequency of recurrent 
non-synonymous variants in Cancer Gene Census genes54.
•	Variants overlapping simple repeats as defined by Tandem Repeats 
Finder55.
•	Indels in regions with high levels of sequencing noise where >10% 
of the base calls in a window extending 50 bp either side of the indel 
were filtered out by Strelka owing to the poor quality.
•	Indels within 10 bp of 100kGP or gnomAD (v.3) germline indel with 
allele frequency > 1%.
•	Variants in regions of poor mappability where the majority of over-
lapping 150 bp reads do not map uniquely to the variant position.
•	SNVs resulting from systematic mapping and calling artefacts pre-
sent in both tumour and control 100kGP sample sets. We tested 
whether the ratio of tumour allele depths at each somatic SNV site 
was significantly different to the ratio of allele depths at this site 
in a panel of control samples using Fisher’s exact test. The panel of 
control was composed of a cohort of 7,000 non-tumour genomes 
from the Genomics England dataset. At each genomic site, only indi-
viduals not carrying the relevant alternative allele were included in 
the count of allele depths. The mpileup function in bcftools (v.1.9) 
was used to count allele depths in the PoN. To replicate Strelka fil-
ters, duplicate reads were removed and quality thresholds set at 
mapping quality ≥ 5 and base quality ≥ 5. All somatic SNVs with a 
Fisher’s exact test phred score < 80 were filtered, with the threshold 
determined by optimizing precision and recall calculated from a 
TRACERx truth set56.
Removing alignment bias introduced by soft clipping of semi- 
aligned reads. The Isaac --clip-semialigned parameter invokes the 
soft clipping of read ends until five consecutive bases are matched 
with the reference genome. This soft clipping therefore results in the 
loss of support for alternative alleles occurring within 5 bp of each 
read end, which leads to artefactually low VAFs. To address allelic bias 
introduced by this clipping, we introduced FixVAF to soft clip all reads 
by 5 bp at each end, regardless of whether any of the bases are variant 
sites or whether the reads support reference or alternate alleles57. 
Reads containing small indels at variant positions were ignored (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1).
Identifying MSI. Tumours with MSI were identified using MSINGS58 
following the previously described procedure for background model 
generation (https://github.com/sheenamt/msings/blob/master/ 
Recommendations_for_custom_assays). A set of 132 tumours with 
known MSI status (106 MSS, 26 MSI) was randomized into test and 
training sets of 53 MSS and 13 MSI cases (that is, 2 sets of 66 cases). 
Microsatellite sites were generated using MISA59. Only sites overlap-
ping regions of good mappability were considered. Sites measured as 
unstable in >5 MSS test tumours and sites not unstable in >1 test MSI 
tumours were removed. The background model produced using the 
training set was able to perfectly distinguish between MSI and MSS 
samples in the test set using default MSINGs settings and was then 
applied to the full CRC cohort.
Identifying pathogenic POL variants. Tumours with pathogenic 
somatic or germline variants in POLE or POLD1 were identified con-
sidering the 22 known pathogenic variants a previously reported60. 
 
In total, 18 tumours (17 MSS, 1 MSI) had a pathogenic germline (n = 1) or 
somatic (n = 17) POLE variant and these were considered as a separate 
POL group in all subsequent analyses. All of the highest mutational 
burden tumours were either MSI or had a known pathogenic POLE 
variant, which indicated that no pathogenic polymerase proofread-
ing domain mutations were missed. Tumours with pathogenic POLE 
variants also exhibited high SBS10a and SBS10b activity, which are 
established indicators of POLE exonuclease domain mutations11.
CNA calling. Somatic CNAs were called using a framework implement-
ed in the R package CleanCNA (Supplementary Fig. 2). Genome-wide 
subclonal CNAs were first called using Battenberg (v.2.2.8)61. To check 
the quality of these CNA calls, we applied DPClust61 and CNAqc62 to the 
CNA profiles and SNV VAFs. DPClust clusters variants by their cancer 
cell fraction (CCF), whereas CNAqc compares observed and expected 
peaks in SNV VAF distributions to assess CNA calling accuracy. A sample 
was classified as ‘pass’ if it met both of the following criteria, and ‘fail’ 
otherwise as follows:


Article
1.	 A clonal cluster of SNVs (0.95 ≤ CCF ≤ 1.05) was identified by DPClust. 
This clonal cluster was required to have either the highest CCF of all 
SNV clusters or contain the largest number of SNVs. SNV clusters 
containing <1% of all sample SNVs were removed before assessment.
2.	The difference in purity estimates from Battenberg and CNAqc was 
<5%. CNAqc estimates sample purity considering peaks in SNV VAF 
distributions in genome regions with one of five copy number states 
(1:0, 1:1, 2:0, 2:1, 2:2).
CNAs were profiled a maximum of four times per sample and the 
procedure was stopped if both criteria were met. After a failure, CNA 
were re-called using Battenberg with re-estimated sample purity and 
tumour ploidy. After the first fail, purity and ploidy were re-estimated 
using information from DPClust, where CCFtop is the CCF of the SNV 
cluster with the greatest CCF:

After the second fail, purity and ploidy were re-estimated using 
Ccube63, and after the third and fourth fails, purity and ploidy were 
re-estimated using CNAqc. If a sample failed after four re-runs, then 
it was removed from downstream analyses reliant on CNAs. Pass CNA 
profiles were produced for 1,765 out of 2,023 samples.
SV calling. SVs (also referred to as chromosomal rearrangements) 
represent two reference positions (referred to as rearrangement break-
points) that are non-adjacent in the reference genome and juxtaposed 
in a specific orientation. We identified somatic rearrangements using 
a graph-based consensus approach comprising Delly64, Lumpy65 and 
Manta66 while also considering support from CNAs (Supplementary 
Fig. 3). Rearrangements were first called using the three individual 
callers with default parameters. Delly was run with post-filtering of 
somatic SVs using all normal samples, as described in the Delly docu-
mentation. Rearrangements from the three individual callers were 
further filtered if any reads supporting the variant were identified in 
the matched normal, if <2% of tumour reads supported the variant or 
if either variant breakpoint was in a telomeric or centromeric region 
or on a non-standard reference contig (that is, not chromosomes 1–22, 
 
X or Y). Remaining rearrangements were merged with a modified ver-
sion of PCAWG Merge SV, which uses a graph-based approach to identify 
and merge rearrangements identified by multiple callers, allowing a 
maximum 400 bp difference in breakpoint position to account for 
variant calling ambiguity16. Rearrangements were included in the final 
dataset if they were identified by at least two callers, or by a single caller 
but with a breakpoint within 3 kb of a CNA segment boundary. SVs were 
only called in the 1,765 out of 2,023 samples with CNA profiles passing 
quality control criteria.
Retrotransposition events are mechanistically distinct from other 
SV-generating events. We searched for retrotransposition events using 
xTea for LINE-1 elements67–69, as other retrotransposition categories 
(Alu elements, SINE-VNTR-Alu elements and processed pseudogenes, 
among others) collectively constitute ≤3% of retrotransposition events 
across human cancers66. We subsequently decided to exclude retro-
transpositions from our current SV analysis report, to await later sepa-
rate publication.
Putative kinase gene fusions were identified considering the follow-
ing genes: ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, KIT, 
MET, NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1 and RET22. Fusions were required 
to involve the kinase domain of the 3′ gene and to have correct strand 
orientation.
Clinical data
Clinical data were obtained from the GMCs, NHS Digital (NHSD) and 
Public Health England’s National Cancer Registration and Analysis 
Service (PHE-NCRAS) through the Genomics England Research Envi-
ronment as part the 100kGP main program v.10 release. Survival data 
were obtained from the 100kGP main program v.13 release. Tumour 
samples sequenced by Genomics England were matched to their respec-
tive PHE-NCRAS records using the date of tumour sampling reported 
by Genomics England and dates of biopsy or treatment reported by 
PHE-NCRAS, allowing a maximum discrepancy of 7 days.
Clinical data included sex, age at tumour sampling, date of cancer 
diagnosis, date of last reported follow-up and date of death, tumour 
histology, tumour type (primary, recurrence of primary or metastases), 
anatomical site sampled, anatomical site of primary tumour, Dukes 
stage, and tumour grade (differentiation). For some variables, data were 
obtained from multiple sources (GMC, NHSD, PHE-NCRAS), and any 
conflicts between these sources were resolved by individual inspection. 
If Dukes staging was not available, it was inferred from TNM staging if 
reported. Anatomical site of primary tumour was reported at different 
resolutions by the different data sources (for example, one source may 
report site as proximal colon, whereas another may report it as cae-
cum). To resolve and standardize the site, we therefore constructed an 
anatomical ontology based on ICD-10-CM codes and assigned sample 
terms to this ontology. This enabled us to consider anatomical site at 
two main levels of resolution: less specific (proximal colon, distal colon 
and rectum) and more specific (caecum, ascending colon, hepatic 
flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid 
colon, rectosigmoid colon and rectum). Certain analyses were also 
performed on the basis of a combined analysis of proximal and distal 
colon (colon). The proximal colon comprised the caecum, ascending 
colon, hepatic flexure and transverse colon, whereas the distal colon 
comprised the splenic flexure, descending colon and sigmoid colon. 
The rectosigmoid junction was considered part of the rectum. All asso-
ciations between clinical and molecular data, and between different 
molecular data, are reported based on tests unless otherwise stated.
Germline mutations in the Mendelian CRC predisposition genes (APC, 
MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, MUTYH, SMAD4, BMPR1A, GREM1, STK11, NTHL1, 
MBD4, POLE and POLD1) were explored in the sequenced constitu-
tional DNA. Disease-causing changes were identified based on ClinVar 
annotation as ‘pathogenic’ or ‘likely pathogenic’, with the exception 
of POLE and POLD1, which used the method described in the section 
‘Identifying pathogenic POL variants’. Evidence of pathogenic biallelic 
changes was required to diagnose the recessive conditions (MUTYH, 
NTHL1 and MBD4) and no such cases were found. Twenty patients (aged 
30–79 years) were identified as having a previously unreported CRC 
predisposition caused by germline mutations in Lynch syndrome or 
polymerase proofreading polyposis genes (seven MSH2, five MLH1, 
six MSH6, one POLE, one POLD1).
Based on principal component analysis of germline genotypes, 
 
90.2% (n = 1,819) patients were of European ancestry, with 2.6% (n = 52) 
African, 0.7 (n = 15) East Asian, 3.2% (n = 64) South Asian and 3.3% (n = 67) 
mixed ancestry (Supplementary Fig. 4). There was strong agreement 
between 16 self-reported ancestry groups and principal component 
analysis classification.
Sample selection
Because tumour sample purity and sequencing data quality affect the 
sensitivity and precision of variant calling70, we excluded samples using 
the following quality control procedures (Supplementary Table 2).
•	Tumour samples were excluded if cross-contamination of the tumour 
sample was >1%, as estimated by VerifyBamID71.
•	Tumour samples were excluded if cross-contamination of the matched 
germline sample was >1%, as estimated by VerifyBamID.
•	Estimating tumour sample purity is particularly difficult when purity 
is low. We therefore used the distribution of single-nucleotide variant 
VAFs to identify low purity samples, as a low average SNV VAF can be 
indicative of low sample purity72. Tumour samples with a median SNV 
VAF < 0.1 were excluded, with this threshold chosen based on the 


smaller numbers of potential driver variants observed in MSS CRC 
samples when compared with all MSS CRC samples (Supplementary 
Fig. 5). Here driver mutations were defined as any potentially patho-
genic coding variant called in 63 driver genes previously identified 
in MSS CRC3,4,7,8.
•	Tumour samples were excluded if <100 SNVs were called, as this num-
ber is below the smallest number of SNVs previously reported in CRC 
whole genomes2–9 and therefore suggestive of low sample purity or 
sequencing data quality.
•	Tumour samples were excluded if many mutations were associated 
with a probable artefactual mutational signature15.
In total 286 out of 2,492 (11.5%) tumour samples were excluded based 
on the above criteria.
Tumour samples were also excluded if essential clinical data were 
missing or there were unresolvable conflicts between the sources 
from which clinical data were obtained (GMCs, NHSD, PHE-NCRAS) 
(Supplementary Table 2). In total, 183 out of 2,206 (8.3%) of tumour 
samples that passed tumour sample purity and sequencing data qual-
ity control were excluded based on clinical data, using the following 
criteria:
•	GMC, NHSD and PHE-NCRAS reported conflicting years of birth.
•	Sex reported by GMC, NHSD and/or PHE-NCRAS did not match the 
sex inferred from sequencing data.
•	GMC, NHSD and PHE-NCRAS did not report tumour histology or 
reported conflicting histology.
•	Tumour was not classified as a colorectal adenocarcinoma.
•	Missing or conflicting data meant it was unclear whether the primary 
tumour or a metastasis was sampled.
•	If multiple primary tumours or multiple metastases from a single 
individual were sequenced, the primary tumour or metastasis 
sample with the highest purity was included, and all other primary 
tumour or metastasis samples were excluded. This procedure was 
completed after all other exclusion criteria had been applied. Pri-
mary tumours and metastases were considered separately for this 
procedure.
Based on these criteria, 2,023 colorectal adenocarcinoma samples 
were suitable for analysis (Supplementary Table 2). This cohort com-
prised 1,898 primary tumours, 122 metastases and 3 recurrences of 
primary tumours from 2,017 patients. Six patients (all MSS) had both a 
primary tumour and a metastasis sample sequenced and each tumour 
was included. One hundred and nineteen metastases were MSS, the 
other three comprising two MSI and one POL cancer. Some subsequent 
analyses excluded the MSI and POL metastases (details in Supplemen-
tary Tables). The three recurrences were MSS (n = 1) and MSI (n = 2), and 
these were included in the appropriate primary cancer group for further 
analyses. A single cancer was POL and MSI, and this was included in the 
POL group for further analyses. Clinical data completeness is detailed 
in Supplementary Table 31.
Single-nucleotide variant and indel drivers
Mutation annotation. Somatic mutations were annotated to Ensembl 
(v.101, GRCh38) using Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)73. The following 
parameters were used: vep -i <input_vcf> --assembly GRCh38 –no_stats 
–cache –offline –symbol –protein -o <output> --vcf –canonical –dir 
<ref_dir> --hgvs –hgvsg –fasta <GRCh38_fasta> --plugin CADD,<CADD_
score_file> --plugin UTRannotator,<GRCh38_uORF_reference>.
The CADD score file was obtained using CADD (v.1.6)74–76, with scores 
attained for all SNV and indel mutations using the CADD software avail-
able from GitHub (https://github.com/kircherlab/CADD-scripts) before 
being utilized by the VEP CADD plugin.
Protein-coding driver identification. Protein-coding driver genes 
were identified using the IntOGen pipeline (v.2020, downloaded 
February 2021)18. Identification was performed separately in MSS pri-
mary, MSI (all primary), POL (all primary) and MSS metastasis sample 
sets, with the aim of optimizing correction for varying background 
mutation rates and spectra among these four groups. Subsequent 
analyses restricted discovery to specific anatomical locations or cluster 
groups in MSS primary tumours.
Pre-processing of input mutations. Somatic mutations passing the 
filtering criteria described above were subject to initial sample and 
mutation pre-processing. In the case of multiple tumours from the 
same patient, the primary tumour was used. Within each cohort (that 
is, MSS primary, primary MSI, primary POL, MSS metastasis), tumours 
were flagged for exclusion from downstream driver gene identifica-
tion if they contained >10,000 mutations and had an outlier mutation 
count, defined as upper quartile + (1.5 × interquartile range). Muta-
tions present in a Hartwig Consortium panel of control set were also 
excluded77. Unless otherwise specified, mutations were mapped to 
canonical protein-coding transcripts from Ensembl (v.101, GRCh38).
Driver identification methods. Seven driver gene identification 
methods were run through the IntOGen pipeline (Supplementary 
Fig. 6):
1.	 dNdSCV (v.0.1.0)6 is designed to detect genes under positive selec-
tion that show an excess of non-synonymous (missense, nonsense, 
essential splice) mutations after correction for local trinucleotide 
context. In the primary POL cohort the parameter ‘max_coding_
muts_per_sample = Inf’ was used because of the high proportion of 
hypermutated tumours.
2.	OncodriveFML (v.2.4.0)78 aims to detect driver genes that show an 
enrichment of mutations with high functional impact. CADD scores 
were used as measure of functional impact74–76.
3.	OncodriveCLUSTL (v.1.1.3)79 is a method designed to detect driver 
genes that are enriched for linear mutation clusters. In the primary 
POL cohort, pentamer signatures were used rather than trinu-
cleotide signatures because of the improved performance of the 
pentanucleotide-based background models compared with that of 
trinucleotides in these tumours.
4.	cBaSE (v.1.1.3)18,80 aims to detect driver genes under positive selec-
tion that exhibit a significant mutation count bias after correction 
by trinucleotide context.
5.	MutPanning (v.2)81 is designed to detect driver genes that exhibit 
 
enrichment of mutations with unusual nucleotide contexts com-
pared with a background model.
6.	HotMaps3D (v.1.1.3)18,82 detects driver genes containing missense 
 
mutations that are spatially clustered together in the three- 
dimensional structure of the protein. Protein structures were down-
loaded from The Protein Data Bank83 in March 2020.
7.	smRegions (v.1)84 detects genes containing an enrichment of 
non-synonymous mutations in regions of interest, such as protein 
domains, after correcting for trinucleotide context. This analysis 
utilized information from protein family (Pfam) domains that were 
mapped to Ensembl (v.101) canonical transcripts.
Combination of driver identification methods. The results of the 
seven driver identification methods were combined in similar manner 
as previously described18. In brief, the driver combination procedure 
considered the top 100 ranked genes and their associated P and Q val-
ues in each of the seven driver identification methods. Somatically 
mutated genes assigned as tier 1 or tier 2 in the COSMIC Cancer Gene 
Census (CGC; v.92)54 were designated as the truth set of known drivers. 
Through comparison of the relative enrichment of CGC genes in the top 
ranked gene lists, a per-method weighting was obtained. Per-method 
ranked lists were combined using Schulze’s voting method to generate a 
consensus ranking, with combined P values estimated using a weighted 
Stouffer Z score method.


Article
Driver candidates were then classified into the following tiers:
•	Tier 1: candidates for which the consensus ranking was higher than 
the ranking of the first gene with Stouffer Q ≤ 0.05. These represent 
high-confidence drivers.
•	Tier 2: candidates not meeting the criteria for tier 1, but which are CGC 
genes and showed a combined Stouffer QCGC < 0.25. These represent 
a set of ‘rescued’ known cancer drivers.
•	Tier 3: candidates not meeting the criteria for tier 1 or tier 2 but with 
Stouffer Q < 0.05. These represent lower confidence drivers.
•	Tier 4: candidates not meeting criteria for tier 1 or tier 2 and with 
Stouffer Q > 0.05. These genes are not likely to be drivers.
Post-processing of candidate drivers. Candidate driver genes were 
filtered based on the following annotations:
1.	 Automatic fail: a candidate driver gene would be excluded from 
further consideration if annotated with at least one of the following:
a.	Tier 4: categorized as tier 4 by the combination procedure.
b.	Single method: only significant (Q < 0.1) in one of the seven meth-
ods (non-CGC genes).
c.	Expression: gene has very low or no expression in a relevant tumour 
type based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
d.	Olfactory receptor: gene is in list of olfactory receptor genes.
e.	Known artefact: gene is in a list of known artefacts or long genes 
(for example, TTN).
2.	Manual review: if a gene is not excluded based on any automatic fail 
filters, it is retained as a candidate driver:
a.	Germline: non-tier 1-CGC gene has ≥1 mutations per sample and 
oe_syn/ms/lof > 1.5 based on gnomAD (v.2.1) constraint metric 
estimates.
b.	Sample 3 Muts: non-CGC gene for which there are ≥3 mutations 
in ≥1 tumour.
c.	Literature: non-CGC gene for which there are no literature annota-
tions according to CancerMine85.
3.	Automatic pass: is not flagged by any automatic fail or manual review 
filters.
Candidate driver roles were assigned on the basis of dN/dS ratios for 
missense (wmis) and nonsense (wnon) mutations for the given gene 
derived from dNdSCV (https://bitbucket.org/intogen/intogen-plus/
src/master/core/intogen_core/postprocess/drivers/role.py):
•	A distance metric was calculated by distance = ((wmis – wnon))/√2
•	Candidate drivers with distance >0.1 represent those with an excess 
of missense to nonsense mutations and are therefore considered 
oncogenes.
•	Candidate drivers with distance <0.1 represent those with an excess 
of nonsense to missense mutations and are therefore considered 
TSGs.
•	Otherwise, the role of the candidate driver is unclear and considered 
ambiguous.
In the case of multiple cohorts being run representing subsets of 
a given tumour type, a consensus role was designated comparing 
between each subtype role:
•	Oncogene if assigned as oncogene in ≥1 cohort and as TSG in no other 
cohort.
•	TSG if assigned as TSG in ≥1 cohort and as oncogene in no other cohort.
•	Ambiguous otherwise.
Gene candidates were annotated by their overlap with any IntOGen 
cohorts from a previous IntOGen pan-cancer analysis (1 February 2020) 
as well as from a pan-cancer TCGA analysis2.
Noncoding driver identification
Defining sets of noncoding regions. Regions from candidate non-
coding elements overlapping coding sequence (CDS) or exon regions 
from canonical protein-coding transcripts were removed using bedops 
(v.2.4.39)86.
The following sets of noncoding regions were defined:
	 1.	Core promoters (n = 19,283). Defined based on the transcription 
start site (TSS) of canonical protein-coding transcripts: 200 bp < 
TSS < 50 bp. CDS regions were removed.
	 2.	Distal promoters (n = 19,296). Defined based on the TSS of canonical 
protein-coding transcripts: 2 kb < TSS. CDS regions were removed.
	 3.	5′ untranslated regions (UTRs; n = 18,613). Defined based on canoni-
cal protein-coding transcripts. CDS regions were removed.
	 4.	3′ UTRs (n = 18,806). Defined based on canonical protein-coding 
transcripts. CDS regions were removed.
	 5.	lincRNAs (n = 16,510). Based on exon regions from transcripts an-
notated as lincRNAs in Ensembl (v.101). Exon regions from canonical 
protein-coding transcripts were removed.
	 6.	miRNAs (n = 1,793). Based on regions from transcripts annotat-
ed as miRNAs in Ensembl (v.101). Exon regions from canonical 
protein-coding transcripts were removed.
	 7.	Non-canonical splice regions (n = 18,163). Defined from regions 
extending 30 bp into the intron from essential splice donor or 
 
acceptor sites in canonical protein-coding transcripts. Exon regions 
from canonical protein-coding transcripts were removed.
	 8.	Enhancers (n = 130,996). Defined from Ensembl (v.101) regulatory 
elements annotated as ‘enhancer’. Exon regions from canonical 
protein-coding transcripts were removed.
	 9.	Open chromatin regions (n = 95,344). Defined from Ensembl 
(v.101) regulatory elements annotated as ‘open chromatin’. 
Exon regions from canonical protein-coding transcripts were 
 
removed.
	
10.	CTCF sites (n = 173,711). Defined from Ensembl (v.101) regulatory 
elements annotated as ‘CTCF sites’. Exon regions from canonical 
protein-coding transcripts were removed.
	11.	Transcription factor-binding sites (n = 29,259). Defined from 
 
Ensembl (v.101) regulatory elements annotated as ‘TF binding 
sites’. Exon regions from canonical protein-coding transcripts were 
 
removed.
Detecting noncoding drivers. Potential noncoding driver muta-
tions were identified in non-hypermutated MSS primary tumours 
(n = 1,442). OncodriveFML (v.2.4.0) was run on sets of noncoding 
regions according to the following amended parameters from the 
protein-coding analysis: indel-max indels are treated as a set of sub-
stitutions, with the functional impact of the indel mutation being 
the maximum of all the substitutions, and the background simulated 
as substitutions. A Q < 0.01 threshold was considered as significant 
(Supplementary Fig. 7).
SNV mutations exhibiting extreme strand bias
SNV mutations that otherwise passed filtering criteria as previously 
detailed were further scrutinized for excessive strand bias (Strelka 
INFO field SNVSB > 10). This highlighted many missense mutations 
that cause a recurrent missense change in CACNA1E (p.Ile95Leu); 
these exhibited excessive strand bias and were therefore deemed 
 
false calls.
Driver mutation annotation
Non-synonymous mutations in the 682 gene transcripts considered 
by OncoKB (v.3.3) were annotated using the OncoKB API87. In the first 
instance, the HGVSg identifier was used; in the rare instances that this 
failed, a combination of gene symbol, consequence and HGVSp were 
used to map mutations to OncoKB annotations.
Annotation of oncogenic mutations
Non-synonymous mutations in candidate driver genes were annotated 
as pathogenic if any of the following criteria were met:


1.	 The mutation is annotated by OncoKB as ‘oncogenic, ‘likely onco-
genic’ or ‘predicted oncogenic’.
2.	The driver is classified as an oncogene, the mutation consequence 
is missense, and the mutation is recurrent (seen in ≥3 tumours in 
cohort).
3.	The driver is classified as a TSG or ambiguous and either:
a.	Consequence is protein-truncating (splice acceptor, splice donor, 
frameshift, stop lost, stop gained or start lost).
b.	Consequence is missense and mutation is recurrent (seen in ≥3 
tumours in cohort).
For POLE, oncogenic annotations were restricted to missense muta-
tions in the exonuclease domain (amino acid residues 268–471).
Non-synonymous mutations not meeting these criteria were 
 
considered as variants of uncertain significance.
Lollipop plots of driver gene mutations. Lollipop plots of driver 
gene mutations (Supplementary Result 2) were generated using 
the Rpackage trackViewer79. Pfam protein domains mapping to the 
 
Ensembl (v.101) canonical transcripts were plotted. The protein position 
was taken from the first position in the HGVSp annotation, apart from 
splice donor and acceptor mutations, for which the codon nearest to 
the HGVSc transcript position was assigned as the protein position.
Timing driver mutations. The relative evolutionary timings of can-
didate driver mutations were obtained using MutationTimeR31. Copy 
number input for MutationTimeR was prepared from Battenberg seg-
mentation files, with the clonal frequency of each segment taken as 
the tumour purity. In the case of subclonal calls, the clonal frequency 
was calculated by multiplying the tumour purity by the clonal fraction. 
The clusters input for MutationTimeR was prepared from DPClust 
cluster estimates. The VAF proportion was calculated by multiplying 
the estimated cluster CCF by the tumour purity. Superclonal clusters 
(CCF > 1.1) were removed. VCF input for MutationTimeR was obtained 
from the small somatic SNV/indel variant VCFs, which had been filtered 
as previously described. For SNVs, alt and ref depths were obtained 
using FixVAF. For indels, ref and alt depths were obtained from tier 2 
Strelka TAR and TIR fields, respectively. Only mutations within Bat-
tenberg copy-number segments were retained (note that for male XY 
tumours with only 1 copy of the X chromosome, copy number informa-
tion is restricted to the pseudoautosomal region and Battenberg was 
not run on the Y chromosome).
MutationTimeR was run with 1,000 bootstraps. For tumours previ-
ously defined as having undergone WGD, the parameter isWgd was set 
to true. Mutations were then classified into estimated simple clonal 
states (as per figure 1a of ref. 31): clonal (early), mutation on ≥ 2 copies 
per cell; clonal (late), mutation on 1 copy per cell, no retained allele; 
clonal (NA), mutation on 1 copy per cell, either on amplified or retained 
allele; subclonal, mutation on <1 copy per cell.
Mutational signature attribution. SeqInfo VCFs produced as part of 
SigProfilerMatrixGenerator17 were used to map somatic mutations 
from input VCFs to their SBS96, DBS78 or ID83 contexts and then to 
the final SigProfilerExtractor COSMIC (v.3.2) decomposed signature 
probabilities. For different purposes, mutational signatures were 
variously measured as follows: presence–absence, for example, when 
assessing shared aetiology; proportional activity (essentially propor-
tion of mutations fitted to any signature in that tumour), useful for 
comparing between signatures in the same sample; and number of 
mutations ascribed, estimated as (activity × burden of mutations of 
SBS, DBS or ID type fitted to any signature), approximating to burden 
of mutations from that signature in that tumour.
Annotation of DBS mutations. Per-tumour VCFs containing DBS 
 
mutations, either directly called originally by Strelka or originally called 
by Strelka as two adjacent SNVs and reconstructed as DBS mutations, 
were created and mutation consequences were re-calculated using 
VEP as above.
Patterns of somatic CNA
WGD classification. Tumours were classified as WGD considering the 
average genome copy number state (ψave) as follows:

Where S is the number of copy number genome segments, CiMaj and CiMin 
are the major and minor allele copy numbers, respectively, for genome 
segment i, and Li is the base pair length of genome segment i. If there 
was evidence of subclonal alteration, then the copy number states 
corresponding to the largest tumour cell fraction were considered. 
Tumours were classified as WGD if 2.9–2H < ψave and non-WGD other-
wise, where H is the fraction of the genome with a minor allele copy 
number of 0 (ref. 32).
Classification of CNAs. Individual CNAs were grouped into six cat-
egories: homozygous deletion (HD), LOH, including copy-neutral LOH, 
other loss (OLOSS), no change (NOC), gain (Gain) and amplification 
(AMP). The classification considers whether a tumour has undergone 
WGD (Supplementary Table 38).
For cases in which subclonal CNAs existed, the copy number state 
corresponding to the largest cell fraction was used. Classification into 
one of the six categories overlaps significantly between non-WGD and 
WGD tumours, with differences relating to total copy number. Differ-
ences include the following:
•	In non-WGD tumours, segments were classified as LOH if 1 allele had 
a copy number state of 0 and the total copy number (tCN) ≤2. In WGD 
tumours, segments were classified as LOH if 1 allele had a copy number 
state of 0 and tCN ≤4.
•	Non-WGD tumours do not have an OLOSS category.
•	NOC was defined as 1+1 in non-WGD tumours and 2+2 in WGD tumours.
•	In non-WGD tumours, segments were classified as Gain if 2 < tCN ≤ 5. 
 
In WGD tumours, segments were classified as Gain if 4 < tCN ≤10.
•	In non-WGD tumours, segments were classified as AMP if tCN > 5. 
 
In WGD tumours, segments were classified as AMP if tCN > 10.
Positional enrichment of CNAs
Preparing GISTIC input. Recurrent arm-level copy number events, 
as well as focal amplifications and deletions, were identified using 
 
GISTIC (v2.0.2.3)34. For all samples with CNA profiles passing qual-
ity criteria, a copy number segmentation file suitable for GISTIC 
input was generated using Battenberg output. Chromosomal 
 
coordinates and major (nMaj) and minor (nMin) copy number states 
were obtained for each copy number segment identified by Bat-
tenberg. In the case of subclonal copy number segments, nMaj and 
nMin values corresponding to the largest tumour cell fraction were 
 
considered.
Per-segment normalized copy number (SegCN) values were calcu-
lated differently for tumours with WGD (for which ploidy was assumed 
to be four) and without WGD (for which ploidy was assumed to be two). 
SegCN was thresholded to a minimum of –2 and maximum of 2.

Running GISTIC. GISTIC was run using the following parameters:

Prioritizing probable gene targets of focal amplifications and 
deletions. Candidate target genes at focal amplifications and dele-
tions were annotated using the following criteria:
1.	 Overlap with genes at focal amplifications and deletions reported 
in a previous pan-cancer study that used GISTIC88. Comparisons 
were made both with the overall pan-cancer GISTIC analysis, and 
GISTIC analysis was restricted to the given tumour type. Special 
consideration was given to genes specifically highlighted by the 
previous study88 as being candidates.
2.	Overlap with Cosmic Cancer Gene Census genes and whether their 
annotated role (oncogene (OG), TSG or ambiguous) is consistent 
with the copy number change (OG with amplifications and TSG with 
deletions)22.
3.	Overlap with driver genes identified in this study and whether their 
probable role (OG, TSG or ambiguous) is consistent with the copy 
number change (OG with amplifications and TSG with deletions).
Based on the above criteria, consensus driver genes were manually 
assigned to peaks. Comparisons were made with all potential gene 
synonyms as available from the HUGO gene nomenclature name com-
mittee (https://www.genenames.org/).
Defining copy number segments overlapping recurrent CNAs. 
Alterations from the broad analysis with Q < 0.05 were taken to indi-
cate recurrent arm-level events. Copy number segments constitut-
ing greater than half of the total chromosome arm size were taken to 
indicate arm-level events.
In the case of focal events identified by GISTIC, the ‘wide region’ 
was used to compare potential extent of overlap with copy number 
segments. Segments were defined as overlapping focal events if either 
the segment interval constituted greater than half of the focal region, 
or vice versa, using pybedtools and bedtools (v.2.3.0)89,90.
Tumours were considered to have specific arm-level or focal dele-
tions if an overlapping copy number segment was annotated as HD 
or LOH (as described above). Similarly, tumours were considered to 
have specific arm-level or focal amplifications if an overlapping copy 
number segment was annotated as Gain or AMP. In the case of subclonal 
CNAs, nMaj and nMin values corresponding to the largest cell fractions 
were considered.
ecDNA detection. With the caveat that that there is no definitive way to 
distinguish ecDNA and intrachromosomal amplification in heterogene-
ously staining regions, potential ecDNA molecules were detected from 
tumour bam files using AmpliconArchitect (v.1.2)29. In brief, per-tumour 
seed regions were prepared from Battenberg copy number segmenta-
tion output if a segment was >100 kb and the total copy number was 
>5. AmpliconArchitect was then run using these seed regions to extract 
overlapping sequence reads from the tumour BAM file and to construct 
candidate amplicons.
Candidate amplicons were classified using AmpliconClassifier 
(v.0.4.6) into the following categories: (1) cyclic (truly circularized 
ecDNA); (2) complex non-cyclic; (3) linear amplification; and (4) no 
amplification or invalid. Amplicons were highlighted if containing a 
known highly amplified oncogene (MDM2, MYC, EGFR, CDK4, ERBB2, 
SOX2, TERT, CCND1, E2F3, CCNE1, CDK6, MDM4, NEDD9, MCL1, AKT3, 
BCL2L1, ZNF217, KRAS, PDGFRA, AKT1, MYCL, NKX2-1, IGF1R and PAX8, 
as previously reported30).
Estimation of telomere content. Telomere content was estimated 
from tumour and germline BAM files using TelomereHunter (v.1.1.0)91 
and Telomerecat (v.3.3.0)92 with default parameters.
Telomere content was normalized by log2(tumour content/normal 
content).
Patterns of somatic structural variation
Classification of simple and complex SVs. Rearrangements identified 
by the graph-based consensus approach were grouped into footprints 
and clusters based on their proximity within the genome, the overall 
number of events in the genome and the size of these events using 
ClusterSV93. Rearrangement footprints represent sets of rearrangement 
breakpoints that are positionally associated, whereas rearrangement 
clusters represent sets of rearrangements that are mechanistically 
 
associated. Rearrangement footprints were described using the string 
approach as previously proposed93. Simple and complex events were 
defined as clusters comprising ≤2 or ≥3 individual rearrangements, 
respectively. Simple events were classified as deletions, tandem dupli-
cations, balanced inversions, balanced translocations or unbalanced 
translocations, whereas complex events were classified as chromo-
plexy or chromothripsis (detailed further below). Simple and complex 
events that did not meet the criteria of any of these classifications were 
described as simple unclassified or complex unclassified, respectively.
Chromothripsis events were inferred using established criteria93,94. 
A rearrangement cluster was defined as chromothripsis if it met all 
the following criteria:
•	A contiguous series of four genome segments oscillating between two 
copy number states, or five genome segments oscillating between 
three copy number states.
•	At least six interleaved intrachromosomal rearrangements, as per a 
previous study94.
•	No evidence (FDR > 0.2) that the distribution of intrachromosomal 
fragment join orientations diverge from a multinomial distribution 
with equal probabilities for each of the four orientation categories 
(duplication-like, deletion-like, head-to-head inversion and tail-to-tail 
inversion).
A rearrangement cluster was defined as chromoplexy if it met all 
the following criteria:
•	Contains a chain of rearrangements spanning at least three chromo-
somes95. SV chains were identified using a graph-based approach, in 
which nodes represent breakpoints, and are connected by an edge if 
they are not involved in the same rearrangement and fall within 1 Mb 
of each other. The graph-based approach was implemented using 
the R package igraph96.
•	At least 50% of rearrangement footprints in the cluster represent bal-
anced translocations, either with no observed copy number change 
or a deletion bridge between the break ends.
•	Consists of between 3 and 30 rearrangements.
Identification of simple structural variation hotspots. Rates of 
somatic structural variation differ throughout the genome and are 
influenced by local genomic features97. Genome regions enriched for 
simple SVs (Supplementary Table 10) were therefore identified using 
a permutation-based approach considering genomic features associ-
ated with structural variation occurrence. Deletions, tandem duplica-
tions, balanced inversions, balanced interchromosomal translocations 
and unclassified simple SVs were considered separately. Individual 


rearrangements forming parts of complex SVs were excluded from this 
analysis. MSS primary and MSI tumours were also analysed separately, 
whereas primary POL tumours and metastases were not considered 
owing to low sample numbers.
Evaluating relationships between genomic features and SV 
 
frequencies. Negative binomial regression was used to test associa-
tions between genomic features and numbers of SVs of each simple 
class97. The following features were included in the models: average 
total copy number across the bin in the CRC sample set, GC content, 
the presence of genes highly or lowly expressed in CRC, ALU repeats, 
other genomic repeats, segmental duplications, fragile sites, replica-
tion timing, and DNase, H3K36me3 and H3K9me3 peaks. Highly and 
lowly expressed genes were defined as those with mean RSEM value 
in the top 25% and bottom 75% of protein-coding genes in TCGA CRC 
samples with RNA sequencing7. ALU and other genomic repeats were 
obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser98. Segmental duplications 
were obtained for GRCh38 from the Segmental Duplication Database99. 
Fragile sites were obtained from a previous study66. Replication timing 
data from CRC epithelial cells (HCT116) were obtained from Replica-
tionDomain100. DNase-seq data (ENCFF443KCU) and ChIP–seq data for 
histones H3K36me3 (ENCFF553QXG) and H3K9me3 (ENCFF482DLD) 
were obtained for the large intestine from ENCODE101.
Permuting SVs. SVs were simulated to test whether the number of 
SVs observed in a region was greater than expected by chance given 
the local genomic features102. SVs were simulated for each simple SV 
class, preserving the number and length (distance between intra-
chromosomal SV break ends) of SVs observed in the CRC sample sets. 
 
To simulate SVs, the genome was divided into non-overlapping 1 Mb 
bins and the genomic features (listed above) of each bin summarized. 
All genomic features were normalized to a mean of 0 and standard 
deviation of 1 to aid comparisons. The number of break ends expected 
in each bin was then estimated using the effect estimates from the 
previously generated negative binomial regression model. For each 
observed SV, a SV was simulated by sampling a bin under probabilities 
proportional to the expected numbers of break ends in each bin. For 
intrachromosomal SVs, a partner break end was then simulated by 
selecting the position either upstream or downstream (with equal 
probability) equal in distance to the distance between the two break 
ends in the observed SV. For interchromosomal SVs, a partner break 
end was simulated by sampling a bin under probabilities proportional 
to the expected numbers of break ends in each bin, excluding bins 
on the same chromosome. SVs were re-simulated if either break end 
fell within an uncallable region (a telomere or centromere). SVs were 
simulated 1,000 times to generate a null distribution of expected SV 
numbers for the 1-Mb bins.
Identifying SV hotspots. Piece-wise constant fitting (PCF) was used 
to identify regions of the genome containing greater numbers of SV 
break ends than expected102. SV break ends were first sorted by position 
and the distance between successive break ends calculated. PCF was 
then applied to the log10 of these inter-mutational distances (IMDs). 
SV hotspots were identified by first computing the observed (dobs
i) 
and expected (dexp
i) number of breakends per base pair for each PCF 
segment (i):

Where ai is the number of break ends in the segment, si is the length 
of the segment in base pairs, n is the number of bins overlapping the 
segment, bj is the expected number of SVs in bin j, and sbin is the bin size 
(1 Mb). A simple SV enrichment factor βi
simple is then computed for each 
PCF segment as follows:

The PCF algorithm requires parameters γ (that controls the smooth-
ness of the segmentation) and kmin (the minimum number of mutations 
in a segment). FDRs at each βsimple value were estimated by applying 
PCF to both the observed and simulated SV sets and dividing the mean 
number of segments with a βsimple value at least as great in the simu-
lated SV sets by the number of segments with a βsimple value at least as 
great in the observed SV set. A maximum FDR of one was set and FDR 
values equal to zero were changed to the lowest non-zero FDR value 
observed. Optimal γ and kmin values were chosen by repeating this 
process for values of γ between 1 and 20, and values of kmin between 2 
and 20, and selecting values that maximized the number of hotspots 
identified while minimizing the FDR. In the final analysis, γ = 10 was 
used throughout, whereas kmin = 2 was used for translocations in MSS 
primary samples, kmin = 4 was used for unclassified simple variants in 
primary MSI samples, and kmin = 10 was used otherwise. SV hotspots 
for which no SVs were supported by CNAs were considered potential 
artefacts and removed. Overlapping SV hotspots identified in the same 
sample sets were collapsed.
Classification of SV hotspots as fragile sites. SV hotspots were clas-
sified as fragile sites if they satisfied at least three of the following six 
criteria (this threshold was chosen by assessing the co-occurrence of 
these criteria):
•	Were late replicating103. Replication timing data from CRC epi-
thelial cells (HCT116) were obtained from ReplicationDomain. 
Late-replicating regions were defined as those with mean Repli-Seq 
values ≤ 0.
•	Had low gene density104. A threshold of five genes per megabase was 
used.
•	Overlapped a gene greater than 300 kb in size. This threshold was 
chosen as fragile sites generally occur in chromosome regions con-
taining genes at least 300 kb in size105.
•	The overlapping gene of greatest size was the focus of the SV enrich-
ment. This was assessed by computing the ratio between SV break 
point densities in the overlapping gene of greatest size and intergenic 
regions flanking 1 Mb upstream and downstream. A threshold of five 
was used.
•	Overlapped a fragile site as previously reported66. These fragile sites 
were originally obtained from either the NCBI or literature cura-
tion and were mapped from NCRI36 to GRCh38 co-ordinates using 
LiftOver98.
•	Overlapped a fragile site identified in a pan-cancer analysis of 
whole-genome-sequenced tumours102 and mapped from GRCh37 
to GRCh38 co-ordinates using LiftOver98.
SV hotspots were not considered as potential fragile sites if they 
contained an identified CRC driver gene. SV hotspots at potential fragile 
sites likely occur for mechanistic rather than selective reasons and were 
therefore not considered further66.
Identification of candidate gene targets of recurrent SVs. Genes 
were reported as candidate targets of recurrent SVs if they had been 
identified as targets in previously analyses4,7,8,102, were known CRC driver 
genes overlapping an SV hotspot or were the sole expressed gene in the 
hotspot region. Numbers of samples with a focal change at a candidate 
gene were computed considering SVs <3 Mb in size106 at least partially 
overlapping the gene coding sequence.
Enrichment of complex structural variation. Genome regions 
 
enriched for complex SVs were identified using a permutation-based 


Article
approach, considering chromothripsis, chromoplexy and unclassified 
complex SVs separately. MSS primary and MSI tumours were also ana-
lysed separately, whereas POL tumours and were not considered owing 
to low sample numbers. The genome was first split into non-overlapping 
1 Mb bins and the observed number of tumour samples with complex SV 
footprints (gpbs
i) overlapping each bin (j) counted. Complex SV footprint 
positions were next permuted 100,000 times by randomly sampling 
genome regions equal in size to the footprints. The expected number 
of tumour samples with complex SV footprints (gexp
i) overlapping each 
100-kb bin was then estimated as the mean number of tumour samples 
with SV footprints overlapping the bin across all permutations. A com-
plex SV enrichment factor βi

FDRs at each βcomplex value were estimated by computing βcomplex for 
each bin in both the observed and permuted SV sets and dividing the 
mean number of bins with a βcomplex value at least as great in the per-
muted SV sets by the number of bins with a βcomplex value at least as great 
in the observed SV set. A maximum FDR of 1 was set and FDR values 
equal to zero were changed to the lowest non-zero FDR value.
Mutational processes
Characterizing SBS, DBS and indel signatures. SBS, DBS and indel 
signatures were extracted de novo and related to known COSMIC sig-
natures (v.3.2) using SigProfilerExtractor11. SBS, DBS and indel signa-
tures were extracted using random initialization, 500 NMF replicates, 
and between 10,000 and 1,000,000 NMF iterations. We assumed the 
presence of between 1 and 30 SBS signatures (minimum signatures 
and maximum signatures parameters, respectively), 1 and 15 DBS sig-
natures, and 1 and 10 indel signatures. Default settings were used for 
all other parameters. Investigation of the new DBS-A signature (Sup-
plementary Table 3) hinted towards the signature being a technical 
artefact of the high number of short indels at homopolymer regions 
occurring in MSI samples.
Characterizing SV signatures. SV signatures were extracted consid-
ering only simple SVs, specifically deletions, tandem duplications, 
balanced and unbalanced inversions, and balanced and unbalanced 
interchromosomal translocations. Deletion and tandem duplication 
size distributions are multimodal, and we therefore classified these 
variants as <10 kb, 10 kb to 1 Mb, and > 1Mb. Variant site replication 
timing is also multimodal and we therefore classified variants as late, 
mid or early replicating considering mean Repli-Seq thresholds of <–2, 
–2 to 2, and >2 using CRC epithelial cell data from ReplicationDomain 
(Supplementary Fig. 8).
Mechanisms of fragile site instability differ from other SVs, and 
deletions and tandem duplications at fragile sites were therefore con-
sidered separately91. Signatures were extracted using a hierarchical 
Dirichlet process (HDP) implemented in the R package hdp (v.0.1.5)91. 
The hierarchical Dirichlet process structure was initialized with one 
common grandparent node, a parent node for each of the MSS, MSI and 
POL tumour subtypes, and a child node for each of the 1,765 tumour 
samples in which SVs were called. Four separate Markov chain Monte 
Carlo posterior sampling chains were run with 5,000 burn-in itera-
tions, extracting 12 SV signatures. Extraction stability was assessed 
by splitting the cohort into halves, maintaining proportions of MSS, 
MSI and POL tumours, and re-extracting signatures from each half. 
Nine signatures extracted from the cohort halves showed high simi-
larity between halves (cosine similarity > 0.9) and high similarity with 
signatures extracted from the full cohort. These nine signatures were 
named SV1–SV9 and considered in subsequent analyses.
To investigate DNA repair mechanism perturbation, we correlated 
driver gene mutation with SV signature activity. A gene was considered 
mutated if it harboured a likely pathogenic germline SNP or indel 
(variants annotated as ‘pathogenic’ or ‘likely pathogenic’ in ClinVar107), 
a likely oncogenic somatic SNV or indel, or a homozygous deletion 
at a gene exon. Pairwise associations between gene mutation and SV 
signature activity were tested for using multiple linear regression, 
including gene mutation status, age at sampling, primary tumour site 
and tumour sample purity as independent variables. Genes were con-
sidered if they were mutated in at least 1% of tumours. TP53 mutation 
is associated with increased CIN, and TP53 was therefore included in 
all models. The Yeo–Johnson extension to the Box–Cox transforma-
tion was applied to mutation numbers to reduce heteroscedacity 
and to ensure distributions were approximately normal108. Samples 
with missing independent variable values were excluded. Owing to 
mutational burden heterogeneity, only MSS primary tumours were 
considered in this analysis. P values were adjusted for multiple testing 
using Bonferroni correction and a threshold of P = 0.05 considered 
significant.
Characterizing copy number signatures. SigProfilerExtractor was 
used to extract copy number (CN) signatures in the 1,765 tumours with 
profiled CNAs12. Where Battenberg identified a subclonal CNA, the 
copy number states corresponding to the largest tumour cell fraction 
were used, as SigProfilerExtractor cannot consider subclonal copy 
number states. Each copy number segment was assigned to 1 of 48 
categories using SigProfilerMatrixGenerator, considering heterozy-
gous or homozygous state, total copy number and segment length12,17. 
Combinations of 1–30 de novo signatures were extracted and the rec-
ommended solution was accepted, balancing cosine distance with aver-
age stability (Supplementary Fig. 9), with the selection plot showing 
the mean sample cosine difference and average stability for de novo 
extraction of 1–30 CN signature. The accepted solution contained 
four de novo signatures.
De novo CN signatures were then deconvolved into their matching 
component COSMIC CN signatures from COSMIC (v.3) to identify six 
contributing COSMIC signatures, as shown below (CN1 (near-diploid 
state); CN2 (genome doubling); CN6 (chromothripsis/amplification 
with WGD); CN9 (CIN without WGD); CN17 (chromosomal-scale LOH); 
and CN20 (unknown aetiology)). CNV48A is a heterogeneous sig-
nature, dominated by heterozygous segments of 3–8 copies. It is 
decomposed into three COSMIC signatures: CN17, associated with 
HRD and TD (42.18%); CN6, associated with chromothripsis (29/72%); 
and CN20, which has a currently unexplained aetiology (28.1%). 
CNV48B is comprised primarily of heterozygous segments of 3-4 
copies with a length of >40 Mb it is deconvoluted into a single cosmic 
signature CN2, associated with tetraploidy. CNV48C is dominated by 
heterozygous segments with a copy number of 2 and is decomposed 
to CN1, indicative of a diploid state. CNV48D is dominated by LOH 
segments with a copy number of 1 and heterozygous segments with a 
copy number of 2 and to a lesser extent 3–4, it deconvoluted into CN9, 
which has previously been associated with chromosomally unstable 
diploid tumours.
Each CN signature was assigned as being active or inactive in each 
sample. Associations with MSI status, ploidy and HRD status were cal-
culated using Fisher’s exact test, comparing samples with and without 
the phenotype with those that had or did not have the active signature.
Predicting HRD. Evidence of HRD was assessed using HRDetect109. 
HRDetect considers six genomic features predictive of HRD: (1) pro-
portion of deletions with microhomology, (2) SBS3 contribution, 
 
(3) SBS8 contribution, (4) rearrangement signature RS3 contribution, 
(5) rearrangement signature RS5 contribution and (6) HRD index. 
HRDetect requires CNA data and was therefore run only on the 1,765 
out of 2,023 tumours passing CNA calling. SBS3 and SBS8 contribu-
tion estimates were obtained from SigProfiler. Rearrangement signa-
tures RS3 and RS5 were computed using HRDetect, using a previously 
 
reported rearrangement signature73. Although HRDetect was trained 


on breast cancers, it has demonstrated high efficacy when applied 
 
to other cancer types109. It was not possible to retrain HRDetect using 
our CRC samples, as few tumours exhibited a pathogenic germline 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant with somatic loss of heterozygosity of the 
wild-type allele.
Pathway analysis
Analysis of disrupted pathways. Altered pathways were identified by 
integrating coding and noncoding mutations using ActivePathways110. 
MSS, MSI and POL cancers were considered separately. Six mutation 
features were used: coding driver P values from IntOGen18 and 3′ UTR, 
5′ UTR, core promoter, distal promoter and non-canonical splice site 
P values from OncodriveFML78. We tested Reactome pathways obtained 
from MSigDB111. All protein-coding genes included in at least one Reac-
tome pathway were considered as the background gene set.
Driver mutation co-occurrence. Simple methods such as Fisher’s exact 
test and multiple regression were used to assess pairwise co-occurrence 
of driver genes. As these methods assume a null in which the probability 
of a gene alteration is independent of another gene, we also investigated 
use of the DISCOVER algorithm112, which accounts for mutational het-
erogeneity at both the gene and tumour level. In practice, we reported 
simple association statistics, as we wished to include positively or nega-
tively co-occurring driver genes or mutations, irrespective of a shared 
aetiology (for example, both genes containing short repeats prone to 
small indels in MSI tumours).
Cluster analysis. To search for groups of tumours with similar fea-
tures, we used consensus clustering113,114. We clustered 1,471 primary, 
treatment-naive tumours with CNA data using the following 304 clinical 
and molecular features: SNV, indel, SV and CNA burdens; all SBS, DBS, 
ID, SV and CN signature burdens; binary presence of mutations in 196 
driver genes; ploidy; WGD status; fraction of the genome with LOH; 
mean ploidy across each chromosome arm divided by total ploidy 
(excluding the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes); age at sam-
pling; sex; and subtype.
The features were ranked and normalized such that the resulting val-
ues were between zero and one. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering 
was run on these features using the diceR R package with the following 
distance metrics and linkage criteria:
•	Distance metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, cosine, correlation, Jaccard, 
eJaccard and fJaccard (from the R package proxy).
•	Linkage criteria: average, complete, median, mcquitty, ward.D and 
ward.D2 (from R’s hclust function).
Each combination of distance metric and linkage criterion was run 
10 times on random samples of 80% of the tumours. The number of 
clusters was varied from two to ten. We looked for robust clustering 
using the following criteria:
•	The clustering must closely recapitulate the MSS, MSI, and POL sub-
types
•	High average clustering consensus114
•	Absence of tiny clusters (<5 samples)
The ward.D2 linkage115,116 consistently performed better than the 
other linkage criteria. With this linkage, Euclidean and Manhattan 
distances gave good clustering, but we chose Euclidean because the 
Manhattan distance failed to reproduce the POL subtype when the 
number of clusters was greater than six.
To increase the robustness of the clustering, we removed tumours 
that had an item consensus <0.7 and re-clustered using the resulting 
consensus matrix. This step removed 471 tumours that were difficult 
to cluster consistently and led to an increase in mean cluster consensus 
from 0.77 to 0.91. Following these steps, all samples had their subtype 
correctly classified, except for two MSI samples misclassified as MSS.
Immune profiling
HLA haplotyping. HLA typing of blood-derived normal samples was 
conducted using HLATyper, which is part of the Illumina Whole Genome 
Sequencing Service Informatic pipeline. The highest-ranking allele pair 
prediction for each type-I HLA allele (A, B and C) was taken to define a 
six-allele HLA set for each case.
Immune-escape prediction. We predicted three separate mecha-
nisms of immune escape: (1) HLA gene mutation; (2) HLA gene LOH; and 
 
(3) mutation and LOH of other APGs.
Somatic mutations in the HLA locus were predicted using POLY-
SOLVER117. First, alleles were converted to a POLYSOLVER-compatible 
format (lower case, digits separated by underscore) and outputted 
into a patient-specific winners.hla.txt file. Next, the POLYSOLVER 
mutation-detection script (shell_call_hla_mutations_from_type) was run 
on matched tumour–normal pairs to call tumour-specific alterations 
in HLA-aligned sequencing reads using MuTect118. Strelka (v.2.9.9)70 
was also run to detect short insertions and deletions in HLA-aligned 
reads, as it offers increased sensitivity over POLYSOLVER’s default caller. 
Finally, both SNVs and indels passing quality control were annotated 
with POLYSOLVER’s annotation script (shell_annotate_hla_mutations).
LOH at the HLA locus was predicted using LOHHLA119. The same win-
ners.hla.txt files were used as input, with POLYSOLVER’s comprehen-
sive deduplicated FASTA of HLA haplotype sequences as reference. 
 
A type-I allele of a patient was annotated as allelic imbalance (AI) if the 
P value corresponding to the difference in evidence for the two alleles 
was <0.01. Alleles with AI were further labelled as LOH if the following 
criteria held: (1) the predicted copy number of the lost allele was <0.50 
with CI < 0.70; (2) the copy number of the kept allele was >0.75; and 
 
(3) the number of mismatched sites between alleles was >10.
We also evaluated somatic mutations and copy number status of the 
following APGs120: B2M, CALR, CANX, CIITA, ERAP1, ERAP2, HSPBP1, IRF1, 
PDIA3, PSMA7, PSME1, PSME2, PSME3, TAP1 and TAP2. First, somatic 
mutations were annotated using ANNOVAR121. An APG was deemed 
mutated if it contained any non-synonymous, frameshift, stop-loss, 
or stop-gain mutation in its exons. The copy number status of each 
gene was evaluated using Battenberg output.
A sample was defined as immune escaped if it showed at least one of 
the following: (1) HLA mutation; (2) HLA LOH; or (3) APG mutation. HLA 
AI was not considered to provide immune escape as AI can arise from 
multiple sources (including subclonal LOH and unequal focal gains 
of the locus) and therefore the effect of AI on antigen presentation is 
uncertain. For cases when HLA alterations could not be fully evaluated 
(see ‘Sample subsetting and statistical analysis’ below), but no HLA or 
APG alteration was detected, the immune escape status was considered 
unknown as we could not eliminate the possibility of immune escape.
Neoantigen prediction. We predicted neoantigens using NeoPred-
Pipe, a Python-based pipeline combining ANNOVAR and netMHCpan 
(v.4.0)122–124. In brief, all somatic SNVs and indels were annotated using 
ANNOVAR and for all non-synonymous exonic mutations the mutated 
peptide sequence was predicted. We took any 9- and 10-mer spanning 
the mutated amino acid (or acids), resulting in either (1) a 19-amino acid 
window for SNVs or (2) a peptide until the next predicted stop codon 
for frameshift mutations. These peptides were evaluated according to 
their novelty and predicted binding strength to the patient’s six-allele 
HLA set comprised of the HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C genes. Peptides that 
were new compared with the healthy human proteome with binding 
rank of two or below (among the best 2% of binders compared with a set 
of random peptides) were reported as neoantigens. All patient-specific 
HLA alleles were used for neoantigen prediction, regardless of mutation 
or LOH status of the HLA locus.
We considered a mutation neoantigenic if at least one of its down-
stream mutated peptides was a neoantigen with respect to any of the 


Article
patient’s six HLA alleles. We defined neoantigen burden as the total 
number of neoantigenic mutations in the sample. We also evaluated 
the following alternative measures: (1) number of peptide–HLA binding 
pairs; (2) number of strong binder (best 0.5% of peptides) peptide–HLA 
binding pairs; (3) number of neoantigenic mutations in genes expressed 
in CRC (expression ≥10 TPM in ≥10% of TCGA CRCs)7. We found that 
all these measures were highly correlated with our definition of neo-
antigen burden: (1) R = 0.993, (2) R = 0.989, (3) 0.983; P < 10–16 for all 
(Supplementary Fig. 10).
Sample subsetting and statistical analysis. Eighty-five samples were 
excluded from neoantigen calling because netMHCpan was unable 
to predict at least one of their HLA haplotypes. Overall, 217 samples 
had 1 or more haplotypes incompatible with POLYSOLVER, for which 
HLA mutation and LOH calling was restricted to the compatible hap-
lotypes (1, 2 and 3 haplotypes were excluded in 171, 37 and 9 samples, 
respectively). In addition, LOH was not considered for 15 patients 
because they were homozygous for all type-I HLA genes. In total, 1,744 
out of 2,023 samples had complete neoantigen and HLA alteration 
information available.
As CRC subtypes (MSS, MSI and POL) have substantially different 
mutation and immune properties, all analyses were completed sepa-
rately for each subtype. Pairwise comparisons were conducted using 
Wilcoxon tests. Analysis of immune differences associated with tumour 
site was restricted to MSS primary samples, with samples that lacked 
specific information (site information missing or only specified as 
‘colon’) excluded, leaving n = 1,100 samples.
Multivariate regression between immune escape types and neoanti-
gen burden was performed using the lm function against the logarithm 
of neoantigen burden and therefore defined the fold change in burden 
associated with each escape type. Multivariate regression, including 
clinical characteristics, was carried out similarly, using the logarithm 
of total mutation burden as an additional independent variable. The 
number of POL samples was insufficient for statistical analysis and 
the regression analyses were therefore only conducted for MSS and 
MSI tumours.
PHBR analysis. We computed the immunogenicity of a given mutation 
in a given patient using PPHBR40, which takes into account all novel 
peptides produced by that mutation and all HLA alleles present in the 
patient. Low PHBR values correspond to mutations that are likely to 
be presented on the cell surface and hence with a high immunogenic 
potential, whereas high PHBR mutations are less immunogenic. The 
overall immunogenic potential of a mutation within a cohort is defined 
as the median of PHBR values within that cohort. For each mutation and 
HLA haplotype pair considered, we generated all 8–11-mers overlapping 
the mutation and evaluated their binding affinity to the HLA allele using 
the ‘all-predictions’ mode of NeoPredPipe. The best (lowest) rank was 
recorded. For a given patient, PHBR were computed as the harmonic 
mean of six best rank values corresponding to the patient’s six HLA 
haplotypes (homozygous alleles were counted twice). We computed 
PHBR values for all single nucleotide mutations located in driver genes 
that were present in at least four cancers in the cohort. The 85 samples 
with incompatible HLA alleles were excluded.
To evaluate the effect of HLA alterations on PHBR values, we repeated 
the same analysis for affected patients with a reduced set (<6) of HLA 
alleles that were unaltered. To measure the level of patient- (HLA-) 
dependent selection on driver genes, we compared PHBR values for 
mutations in these genes between patients that did not carry the muta-
tion and patients that did. Negative values indicate that mutations of 
the gene are enriched in patients for whom they have lower immuno-
genic potential. PHBR values between patients with no mutations and 
patients with mutations were compared using Wilcoxon rank-test, and 
P values were adjusted for multiple testing using Benjamini–Hochberg 
correction.
For comparisons such as those shown in Extended Data Fig. 7, 
the immunogenic potential of individual mutations was quantified 
using the median of PHBR values associated with that single nucleo-
tide change for each patient belonging to a specific cohort or sub-
cohort. Immunogenicity of groups of driver genes (for example, 
metastasis-specific drivers) was evaluated by considering all muta-
tions observed in the genes and median PHBR computed across the 
entire cohort of CRCs or MSS primary CRCs, as indicated. Values for 
an individual mutation across different cohorts were compared using 
paired Wilcoxon rank-tests.
Mitochondrial genome characterization
Calling mitochondrial somatic SNVs and indels. Somatic mitochon-
drial SNVs and indels were called using Mutect2 (v.4.1.4.1)125, with the 
light strand as reference based on the human mtDNA revised Cam-
bridge reference sequence (rCRS). Somatic mitochondrial variants were 
 
excluded if they had the following:
•	Low mapping quality score (<20).
•	Low base quality score (<20).
•	An alternative allele frequency <1%.
•	Missing alternative reads in any stand direction.
•	Location within hypermutated regions (302–316, 514–525 or 
 
3106–3109).
Mutational distributions of SNVs, categorized by the six possible 
pyrimidine substitution classes, were constructed to analyse muta-
tional processes. Distributions of substitutions on the D-loop, includ-
ing and excluding variants between the two origins of replication 
 
(OH and Ori-b, between sites 16,197 and 191) were also analysed by sub-
stitution class65. Pathogenic variants were identified using ClinVar107, 
considering annotations where at least one submitter provided an 
‘interpretation with assertion criteria and evidence’.
Mitochondrial copy number estimation. Autosomal and mitochon-
drial genome coverage was computed using fastMitoCalc126. Using 
estimated sample purity (ρ), tumour ploidy (φ) and mean coverage 
depth, tumour sample mitochondrial DNA copy number was esti-
mated as previously described31:
ρφ
ρ
Tumour sample mtDNA copy number
= (mtDNA mean coverage)/(autosomal DNA mean coverage)
(
+2(1−))
Mitochondrial copy number was estimated for only the 1,765 out of 
2,023 tumours that passed CNA calling and therefore had purity and 
tumour ploidy estimates.
Linear regression was used to correlate mtDNA copy number with 
age at sampling, tumour stage, site of primary tumour, sex and tumour 
purity. The Yeo–Johnson extension of the Box–Cox transformation 
was applied to mtDNA copy number. Linear regression was applied 
considering all tumours and segregating MSS and MSI tumours. Regres-
sion results were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini– 
Hochberg procedure.
Selection of mitochondrial mutation and POLG correlation. For 
the 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes, selective pressure was 
quantified by calculating the respective dN/dS values using the R pack-
age dNdScv, with non-mtDNA chromosomes removed from the refer-
ence genome6. A global mitochondrial dN/dS value was also estimated, 
 
excluding MT-ND6 due to a suspected replication bias. Results were 
 
adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. 
In addition, it was investigated whether POLG mutations resulted in 
altered mitochondria mutational burden compared to other tumours. 
Only the primary MSI cohort was analysed for this trait, as other sub-
cohorts had too few tumours with non-synonymous POLG mutations.


Genomic impact of previous treatments
Whether individuals had received systemic treatment or colorectum- 
targeting radiotherapy before sampling was based on data from NHSD 
and PHE-NCRAS. For NHSD, records related to systematic treatment 
were obtained from the Admitted Patient Care and Outpatients tables 
using associated Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS)-4 
codes. For PHE-NCRAS, records related to systemic treatment were 
obtained from the AV_TREATMENT table using the event description 
codes, and from the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) table. For 
PHE-NCRAS, records related to radiotherapy were obtained from the 
AV_TREATMENT table using the event description codes, and from 
the National Radiotherapy Dataset (RTDS) table considering records 
associated with a CRC diagnosis.
In total, 315 participants received systemic treatment or radiotherapy 
before tumour sampling. A total of 278 participants received systemic 
therapy before CRC sampling for sequencing, and information on the 
drugs administered was available for 182 of these participants. For 253 
participants, the systemic treatment was used to treat CRC, whereas 
for 25 participants, it was used previously to treat another cancer. 
Overall, 94 participants received capecitabine, 23 received cetuxi-
mab, 93 received fluorouracil, 39 received irinotecan, 109 received 
oxaliplatin, 46 received steroids and 28 received other drugs. In total, 
118 participants received colorectum-targeted radiotherapy before 
tumour sampling.
Associations between systemic treatment and colorectum-targeting 
radiotherapy before sampling with mutational signature activity were 
tested using multiple logistic regression. Previous treatment with radio-
therapy, capecitabine, cetuximab, fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin 
and steroids was included in the models as binary independent variants. 
Other treatments administered before sampling occurred in fewer than 
five individuals and were therefore not included in the models. One 
model was created for each of the identified SBS, ID, DBS and SV signa-
tures, with signature presence encoded as a binary dependent variable 
based on whether any evidence of the signature was identified in each 
sample. In total, 96 samples that received treatment before sampling, 
but for which the specific administered drugs were unknown, were not 
included. Both primary tumours and metastases were considered in 
these analyses. Treatment coefficient P values were adjusted for mul-
tiple testing using Bonferroni correction and a threshold of P = 0.05, 
considered significant. Treatment duration was measured as the time 
between the first and last treatment administration.
Metastasis-specific analyses
Tumours were split between primary (n = 1,354) and metastatic (n = 105) 
MSS samples. Only MSS samples were included as there was just one 
MSI metastasis and no POL metastasis. Five primary tumours were 
matched to metastasis samples in this cohort, but for the purposes 
of the analysis all samples were treated as unmatched. To determine 
mutational burden, VCF files were filtered for PASS variants and 
 
the number of SNVs and indels summed. These were then divided by 
the total genome length (3,088.27 Mb). For the binned copy number 
analysis, the genome was first partitioned into 2,766 1 Mb windows. For 
each sample, the absolute allele-specific copy number within each bin 
was recorded. If two copy number segments overlapped a bin, the copy 
number of the segment with the larger overlap was recorded. Copy 
numbers were then classified according to the section ‘Classification 
of CNAs’. For each aberration type (gain or deletion/LOH) the propor-
tion of primary tumours with that aberration was compared to the 
proportion of metastatic samples with two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. 
The difference between the proportions was then plotted as a trace 
along the genome with stars indicating significantly different bins. 
P values were corrected for multiple testing (FDR < 0.05). Absolute 
copy number calls were divided by mean integer ploidy to account 
for differences in ploidy between the two groups. The adjusted copy 
numbers for each bin were then compared between primaries and 
metastases using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests while correcting for mul-
tiple testing (FDR < 0.05). The difference in the mean (ploidy-adjusted) 
copy number was then plotted as a trace along the genome, with stars 
indicating significant bins.
Microbiome
Microbial identification. Microbial sequences126 were identified using 
GATK PathSeq127 aligned against the default PathSeq microbial genome 
bundles. A minimum clipped read length of 60 bp was used with all 
other parameters set to their defaults. Unambiguously assigned reads 
were used for the decontamination steps. Thereafter the adjusted 
score output was used, sharing ambiguous reads between species. 
Score output for each sample was converted to microbial cells per hu-
man cell for each taxon by adjusting for microbial and human average 
genome size (average human genome calculated from copy number 
and tumour cell percentage data).
Microbial cells per human cell
= (Microbial reads)/(Average microbial genome size)
(Human reads)/(Average human genome size)
This analysis showed that metastases had extremely low microbial 
content and therefore subsequent steps included only primary tumours 
unless otherwise stated. Reads passing PathSeq filters were realigned 
against the E. coli colibactin gene cluster128 using bwa102, and matching 
reads counted.
Contaminants. Potential contaminant species were identified using 
methods developed by The Cancer Microbiome Atlas129. In brief, the 
prevalence of species found in primary tumours and matched blood 
was compared (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Samples were called as positive 
for a species if two or more unambiguously aligned reads from the 
species was found. Species were deemed as probable tumour sample 
origin if a Fisher one-sided exact test found them to be more prevalent 
in the tumour sample than the blood sample (FDR < 0.05) and blood 
sample prevalence was <20% of samples. Genus level scores were recal-
culated from species scores by only including the species scores that 
survived this decontamination step. To mitigate the effects of species 
with mixed biological and contaminant components130, downstream 
steps were adjusted for NHS Hospital Trust where possible (see below) 
as the processing laboratory was a plausible source of contamination.
Identifying taxa associated with CRC. CRC-associated taxa were 
identified by pooling all species level read numbers from eight pub-
lished stool metagenomic studies2,131–134. Application of LEfSe to these 
data identified 73 species and 37 genera associated with CRC135. Bacte-
rial species were classified as oral microbes if they were identified as 
‘oral taxon’ or ‘oral species’ by PathSeq or if they were present in the 
expanded Human Oral Microbe Database136.
Comparing microbiome and clinicopathological data. Microbial 
relative abundances were compared to clinicopathological data using 
decontaminated PathSeq output. Only tumours with complete data for 
the relevant categories were included in each comparison. Genus and 
species level alpha diversity was measured using the Shannon index 
and beta diversity using Bray–Curtis dissimilarity of relative abun-
dance. Differences in beta diversity were measured by PERMANOVA 
using the adonis function137 in Vegan using default settings, with per-
mutations confined to within NHS Trusts using the ‘strata’ setting to 
minimize cross-site contamination differences. Taxa differing between 
clinicopathological categories were measured using MaAsLin2138, 
with minimum abundance of 0, minimum prevalence of 0.1, and NHS 
Trust added as a random effect to minimize cross-site contamination 
 
differences.


Article
Statistical analysis and clinicopathological correlates
Statistical tests were two-sided and unpaired unless otherwise stated. 
Fisher’s exact and χ2 tests were used for categorical variables. Wilcoxon 
(rank-sum) tests, t-tests and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used for quantita-
tive variables. Multivariable analyses are described below.
Correlating variables. Multiple linear regression was used to in-
vestigate the relationship between clinicopathological features and 
numbers of SNVs, indels, CNAs and SVs, and numbers of mutations 
attributed to SBS, ID, DBS and SV signatures. Number of CNAs was 
defined as the number of genome segments for which the clonal or 
subclonal copy number state was not 1:1 in non-WGD tumours or was 
not 2:2 in WGD tumours.
Multiple logistic regression was used to investigate the relation-
ship between the presence or absence of clinicopathological features 
and driver gene mutation, recurrent arm-level CNAs, recurrent focal 
CNAs, WGD and evidence of CN signatures. Unlike SBS, ID, DBS and SV 
signatures, the activities of CN signatures do not represent numbers of 
mutations attributed to the signature12. We primarily considered the 
presence or absence of CN signatures, but also assessed measures of 
activity or burdens where stated.
MSS primary and primary MSI tumours were considered separately. 
Signatures were tested if they were identified in at least 1% of the tumour 
set, driver genes were considered if they were mutated in at least 5% 
of the tumour set, and arm-level and focal copy number alterations 
were considered if identified as recurrent by GISTIC. TP53 mutation is 
associated with increased CIN, and TP53 somatic mutation status was 
therefore included in mutation number models. Considering multi-
ple variables together in a single model is essential given that many 
of these variables are correlated, including age, primary tumour site 
and stage. The Yeo–Johnson extension to the Box–Cox transforma-
tion was applied to mutation numbers to reduce heteroscedacity and 
to ensure distributions were approximately normal108. Samples with 
missing independent variable values were excluded. Primary tumour 
site and tumour stage were considered as ordinal variables. Primary 
tumour site was encoded as a single ordinal variable with the following 
values: caecum = 1; ascending colon = 2; hepatic flexure = 3; transverse 
colon = 4; splenic flexure = 5; descending colon = 6; sigmoid colon = 7, 
rectosigmoid junction = 8; rectum = 9. Exploratory analyses with loca-
tion as a binary variable (proximal versus distal colorectum) or ternary 
variable (proximal colon, distal colon, rectum) were also performed in 
some cases (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Tumour stage was also encoded 
a single ordinal variable with values corresponding to the four Dukes 
stages. Unless otherwise stated, for each individual variable, P values 
were adjusted for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction and a 
threshold of P = 0.05 considered significant.
Survival analysis. Correlation of clinicopathological and genomic 
variables with all-cause mortality (overall survival) was assessed 
 
using Cox proportional hazards models. Follow-up time was meas-
ured from the date that the tumour was sampled (as a proxy for date 
of presentation or diagnosis) to the corresponding patient’s most 
recent time of contact. The median follow-up time was 1,075 days. 
Only individuals for whom the primary tumour was sequenced were 
included. To avoid proportional hazards assumption violation, indi-
viduals with MSS and MSI tumours were considered separately. Indi-
viduals were excluded if tumour sampling occurred before 1 January 
2015 or the time between CRC diagnosis and tumour sampling was 
greater than 1 year. Hazard ratios were adjusted for sex, patient age at 
sampling, primary tumour location and Dukes stage. Owing to small 
numbers of deaths, Dukes stages A and B were combined. Analyses 
were performed regarding location as a binary variable (proximal 
versus distal colorectum) and as an ordinal variable (locations 1–9 
from caecum to rectum).
After excluding individuals with missing covariate data, the MSS and 
MSI cohorts comprised 836 (144 deaths) and 272 (48 deaths) individu-
als. The following variables were analysed:
•	Total mutational burden (SNVs and indels).
•	SBS, DBS and ID mutational signature activity as binary indicators. 
Signatures were analysed if they were identified in <50% of tumours 
in the respective cohort.
•	Immune escape status.
For analyses that required CNA profiles, smaller MSS and MSI cohorts 
comprising 810 (141 deaths) and 222 (40 deaths) individuals were used. 
The following variables were analysed using these smaller cohorts:
•	Driver gene mutation status. Driver genes were considered mutated 
in a tumour if: (1) they contained an oncogenic mutation as defined 
by OncoKB and dNdScv annotation, (2) were homozygously deleted, 
or (3) were affected by a large copy number gain (total copy number 
state >5 for non-WGD tumours and total copy number state >10 cop-
ies for WGD tumours).
•	WGD status.
•	Chromosome-arm-level gains and deletions.
•	Total SV number.
For each cohort, variables were only tested if at least 5% of deaths 
were present in each category. A variable was considered correlated 
with survival if it improved model fit using ANOVA and the z-test pro-
vided association evidence. The Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was 
used to determine FDR to adjust for multiple testing. Proportional 
hazards assumption violations were analysed for each test. In multiple 
Cox regression analysis, P = 0.05 was considered significant.
Normal colorectal epithelial cell signatures. Numbers and propor-
tions of SNVs associated with each SBS signature were obtained from 
a previous study44. For cases in which multiple crypts from the same 
colon region were sampled in a single individual, the median number 
and proportion of SNVs associated with each SBS signature was com-
puted across these samples. For cases in which multiple crypts from 
the same colon region had been sampled in a single participant, the 
median number and proportion of variants attributed to each signature 
was considered. Supplementary Fig. 11 shows data from ref. 44. IDA 
closely resembles ID18. P values were computed using Wilcoxon tests.

Extended Data Fig. 1 | SBS, DBS and ID mutational signatures in each 
tumour. (a) top-to-bottom: tumour mutation burden (TMB) per megabase (Mb) 
and mutational signature activity (% of mutations assigned) for SBS, DBS and ID 
mutations. Tumour subtypes are: MSS primary (n = 1641, orange), MSI (n = 364, 
green) and POL (n = 17, blue). Tumours are first grouped according to their 
subtype and then ordered within each group from the lowest to the highest 
TMB. Common signatures included clock-like processes (e.g. SBS1, SBS5) and 
effects of specific underlying aetiologies (e.g. oxidative damage, SBS18). 
Signatures previously unreported in CRC included SBS89 and SBS94 (29 and  
35 cancers, respectively; both unknown aetiology). Previously reported  
SBS30 (base excision repair), SBS40 (unknown aetiology) and ID7 (defective 
mismatch repair) were not found. (b) Ascribed mutation burdens for each 
detected signature in all CRCs. (c) Pairwise associations between mutational 
signatures. Clusters of co-occurrence, based on binary presence/absence, are 
highlighted by coloured triangles. Positive values (ochre) represent significant 
co-occurrence, whereas negative values (cyan) indicate relative exclusivity, 
with stronger associations in deeper shading (Bonferroni-corrected P values, 
Fisher’s exact test). Non-significant results are in white. Putative artefact 
signatures and signatures with no significant result (PBonf > 0.05) are not shown. 
Hierarchical clustering (Ward.D2, Euclidean distances) was performed on the 
rows and columns of the results matrix. Note negative associations between 
MSS- and MSI-specific signatures and positive associations between signatures 
with other likely shared aetiology (e.g. SBS17a/b). There were several novel 
associations of unknown origin. Notable relationships additional to those 
reported in the main article included an inverse association across all cancers 
between SBS44 (often MSI, dominated by C > T) and DBS2 (smoking, CC > NN) 
(PBonf = 1.4 x 10−173), DBS4 (GC > AA, TC > AA) (PBonf = 5.8 x 10−137) and SBS18 (C > A) 
(PBonf = 6.5 x1 0−139). A further cluster involved SBS10a/b, SBS28, DBS3 and 
DBS10 (driven by POLE). SBS3 tended to co-occur with ID6, ID8 and SBS88.  
(d) Selected signatures showing significant differences among MSS primary,  
MSI and POL cancers (upper) or anatomical locations (lower). Associations are 
assessed as in (c), although co-occurrence is shown by green hues and mutual 
exclusivity in blue. MSI tumours were principally characterised by SBS44, and 
POL by SBS10a/b and SBS28. MSS cancers were enriched for SBS2, SBS8, SBS13, 
SBS18 and SBS93. SBS88, pks+ pathogenic E. coli exposure, was present in  
115 (6%) cancers and ID18 (colibactin-derived) in 255 (13%). Note that these 
associations are uncorrected for covariables; multivariable analysis is shown in 
Supplementary Table 32. Further information is provided in Supplementary 
Result 1.

Extended Data Fig. 2 | Driver mutations. (a) Distribution of per-tumour driver 
mutation counts by CRC type. Predicted pathogenic mutations from 193 driver 
genes (Supplementary Table 4) were included in the analysis which showed  
a highly significant difference (P = 2.6 x 10−198, two-sided Kruskal-Wallis).  
n, numbers of tumours in each of the four groups. (b) Significant pairwise 
associations between the most frequently mutated driver genes and indel 
hotspot mutations, whole genome duplication, age, anatomical location and 
mutational signatures (Q<0.05). (c) Frequencies of 241 CRC SNV/indel driver gene 
mutations across all samples (including analysis of MSS primary cancers by 
anatomical location, Supplementary Table 35). The plot shows the sample sets 
in which the driver was discovered (colour of bar) and previous reports of the 
gene as a driver in CRC or other cancers (colour of gene name). The y-axis shows 
the proportion of cancers with a predicted pathogenic SNV or small indel 
mutation across the whole tumour set. In addition to these drivers, eight SV 
hotspots were denoted as likely drivers, involving genes CDKAL1, BRD4, EZH2, 
IGF2, KCNQ1, MYC, UBE3A and VMP1 (Supplementary Table 35). (d) Frequencies 
of putative driver mutations in four major signaling pathways, Wnt, Ras-Raf- 
Mek-Erk/MAP-kinase, Pi3 kinase and TGFβ/BMP. Pathway information obtained 
from KEGG and TCGA. Key pathway genes not identified as CRC drivers by 
IntOGen are included in grey. Colour code for driver status is as per Fig. 1. 
Numbers refer to mutation frequency in that CRC subgroup (left-right: MSS, 
MSI, POL), with increasingly red shading for higher frequencies). Subgroups  
in which the gene was identified as a driver are shown with bold outline as  
per Fig. 1.

Extended Data Fig. 3 | Somatic structural variation. (a) Hotspots of simple 
structural variants (SVs) identified in MSI tumours (n = 292). Coloured lines 
represent numbers of samples with a SV breakpoint of each class in 1Mb 
genome regions. Hotspots are annotated with their cytoband, the number  
of genes within their boundaries (in brackets) and any candidate gene. SVs at 
fragile sites are not included. (b, c) Numbers of MSS primary tumours with (b) 
chromothripsis events and (c) unclassified complex SVs. Regions enriched for 
chromothripsis and unclassified complex SV at a 5% FDR and greater than 5Mb 
in size are shaded. SVs at fragile sites are not included. (d) Extrachromosomal 
DNA (ecDNA) across CRC subtypes and its contribution to common oncogene 
amplification. The smaller chart shows the counts of tumours carrying at  
least one ecDNA amplicon across tumour subtypes (e.g. tumour counted as 
“Circular” if ≥ 1 circularised amplicon detected, otherwise “BFB” if ≥ 1 BFB 
amplicon detected until “No amp” where no valid amplicon detected). The 
larger chart shows ecDNA classification of commonly amplified oncogenes in 
MSS primary tumours. Classification was restricted to gene amplifications 
with a total copy number ≥ 5 in diploid tumours or ≥ 10 in tetraploid tumours 
(i.e. amplifications or “big gains”). See Supplementary Table 13.

Extended Data Fig. 4 | CNAs, SVs, WGD and pathways of tumorigenesis.  
(a) CNA summary in MSS primary and MSI tumours. Genome-wide frequencies  
of CNA in MSS primary (n = 1,354) and MSI (n = 292) tumours are shown. Focal 
amplifications and deletions reported by GISTIC analysis are shown as grey 
bars, and annotated with a cytoband and likely candidate gene where identified. 
Black dashed lines represent chromosome boundaries. (b) Classification of all 
tumours into diploid and tetraploid (genome-doubled). (c) Hierarchical clustering 
of all tumours based only on copy number states identifies WGD/non-WGD split 
(column 2). CNA-based clustering identified a division based on WGD, with 
features highly reminiscent of the iCMS2/3 division identified by Joanito et al139 
using single cell transcriptomics. (d) Frequency of copy number gain in MSS 
primary tumours by chromosome arm. (e) Numbers of driver genes identified in 
the three main classes (SNV/indel, SV and focal CNA). Putative SV and focal CNA 
drivers must be (i) at a site significantly over-represented above background 
levels, and (ii) annotated to either a known SNV/indel driver or a single gene  
(i.e. there is only a single coding gene in the SV hotspot or focal CNA region). 
SNV/indel drivers identified in MSS cancers in a specific anatomical region of 
the colorectum are not shown (see Supplementary Tables 35 & 36). SV and CNA 
changes at fragile sites are excluded. CNAs in particular and SVs are likely to 
include some second hits at tumour suppressor genes (Supplementary 
Table 18). The following genes are annotated as putative CNA drivers based  
on focal changes, including focal or minimal overlapping regions of change:

TCF3, TFRC, THEMIS, TPTE, USP36, ZBTB7A and ZC3H13. The following genes are 
annotated as putative SV drivers based on hotspots: ACVR2A, ANK1, ANKRD11, 
APC, AXIN2, B2M, BRD4, CD58, CDKAL1, CDKN1C, CTNNB1, EZH2, IGF2, KCNQ1,

TCF7L2, TET2, TP53, UBE3A and VMP1. (f) Molecular and functional connections 
between CRC driver genes from (e). Connections are derived from STRING. Gene 
annotation to the six pathways or “other pathway” was performed manually. 
Note that this analysis weights all driver genes equally.

Extended Data Fig. 5 | Clinicopathological and molecular features of the 
four MSS clusters in comparison with MSI and POL cancers. (a) Anatomical 
sub-divisions of the colorectum (see Fig. 4). Note that numbers of CRCs in the 
splenic flexure and descending colon are generally relatively low compared 
with other regions. (b) Copy number changes and LOH. (c) Ploidy. (d) SNV and 
indel burdens. Note the lack of obvious structure within the MSS sub-group 
centroid. (e) Survival. Left, Kaplan-Meier plot showing overall survival of patients 
with tumours in the four MSS clusters with unclustered MSS, MSI and POL also 
shown. Median follow-up was 755 days. The failure to show the established 
association between MSI and good prognosis could be accounted for by the 
higher age and stage of the MSI patients, together with the non-availability of 
cancer-specific measures of survival. In analysis uncorrected for stage, age, 
location and other clinicopathological variables, logrankP = 0.16. Centre, 
Kaplan-Meier plot showing overall survival of MSS-GS cancer patients versus 
all other MSS cancers. Median follow-up was 754 days. In analysis uncorrected 
for stage, age, location and other clinicopathological variables, logrankP = 
0.019. Right, multivariable analysis, showing that MSS-GS patients had 
significantly longer overall survival (HR = 0.43, P = 0.044) than the other MSS 
clusters in a CoxPH model including age, stage (C,D v A,B (reference)), and 
location (proximal colorectum v distal colorectum (reference)). Sex was not 
significantly associated with survival. In the forest plot, the boxes represent 
point estimates and the horizontal lines delimit 95% confidence intervals.  
No. at risk, number of patients entering the study at time 0, or for subsequent

Extended Data Fig. 6 | Rare molecular sub-groups and non-coding driver 
SVs. (a) Representative copy number analysis of a cancer with sub-clonal SMAD4 
(chr18q21.2) mutation. The Battenberg output shows copy number along the 
genome from chromosome 1 to 22. Red bars indicate total copy number, orange 
bars sub-clonal copy number states and blue bars minor allele copy number. 
Integrating these data with SNV data shows the most parsimonious explanation 
to be that chromosome 18 has sub-clonal (average copy number ~0.5) loss, by 
clonal deletion of one homologue and the co-existence of two sub-clones of 
similar prevalence, one with deletion of the other homologue and the other with 
a loss of function SMAD4 mutation. The presence of multiple other sub-clonal 
copy number changes in this tumour supports this view. (b) Co-occurrence of 
Wnt pathway driver mutations in MSS primary tumours. Pairwise comparison is 
by logistic regression, using co-variables of TMB, age, sex and location. The 
pairwise effect size β (co-occurrence >1 (blue), exclusivity <1 (red)) is shown  
in each square. Uncorrected two-sided P-values for the pairwise association  
are indicated as * <0.05, ** <0.01, *** <0.001. Note the co-occurrence of  
CTNNB1 and TCF7L2, which is also present in MSI tumours (β = 0.26, P<0.001).  
(c) Representative copy number analysis of an MSI cancer with WGD and 
chromosomal instability (CIN). The Battenberg output shows a grossly 
rearranged, polyploid genome, placing this cancer amongst the most altered 
of the MSS group. It contrasts sharply with the near-unaltered karyotypes of 
most other MSI cancers. (d) Mutation status of BRCA1/2 in tumours with and 
without predicted homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) based on 
HRDetect (probability threshold 0.7). Germline or somatic BRCA1/2 variants 
defined as moderate or high impact by Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) and/or 
reported as pathogenic or likely pathogenic by ClinVar (v1.20) were included in 
the analysis, together with CNAs. (e) Proportion of cancers showing ID8 activity 
in patients who had received radiotherapy for treatment of their CRC or a different 
cancer prior to the CRC. (f) Multiple simple structural variants (SVs) identified at 
17q24.3 overlapping lncRNAs and a regulatory element that interacts with the 
SOX9 promoter. Data from MSS primary cancers (n = 1,354) are shown. Top  
track arcs represent simple SVs; second track shows mean GC-corrected log 
ratio between tumour and normal read coverage (logRR) as computed by 
Battenberg – higher and lower values indicate tendencies for copy number 
gains and losses respectively amongst the included tumours; third track shows 
chromosomal interactions identified in HT29 cells using promoter capture 
Hi-C; fourth track shows histone mark signals; and bottom track shows the 
locations of coding genes in the region and lncRNA LINC00673/LINC00511.

Extended Data Fig. 7 | Driver mutation immunogenicity and immune 
escape. (a) Heatmap and frequency chart of the 20 most common antigenic  
SNV and frameshift mutations. Mutations are shown in order of decreasing 
frequency across the CRC set. Colours show antigenic mutations (dark blue), 
escaped antigenicity through HLA alteration (purple), or non-antigenic 
mutations (light blue). The molecular subtype of each cancer is shown above 
the heatmap (green: MSS, red: MSI, yellow: POL). Among recurrent 
non-synonymous mutations, KRAS G12V was most antigenic, predicted to bind 
patient-specific HLA molecules in 80% (146/181) of cancers. KRAS G12D and 
G13D were also frequently predicted to be antigenic, whereas the rarer KRAS 
mutations G12C, A146T and G12A were less so. BRAF V600E was predicted  
to be antigenic in only 36% (98/272) of cancers, as the HLA alleles binding the 
resulting epitope were either uncommon or, in 20% of cancers with predicted 
binding, underwent somatic loss. The most common peptide-changing 
frameshift mutations were principally found in MSI cancers, at a frequency of 
>40% (and are shown in these cancers only). Frameshift mutations produced a 
neoantigen in >95% of cases, although the most frequent frameshift in MSS 
cancers, APC E1309fs, had low predicted antigenicity (30%, 14/47 cases). For the 
20 most frequent non-synonymous changes, the observed mutation frequency 
and predicted antigenic frequency were inversely related (P = 0.042, two-sided 
Pearson correlation test). There was no equivalent association for the 20 most 
frequent frameshift changes (P = 0.32), plausibly reflecting their almost 
universally high immunogenicity. (b) Dependency of neoantigen burden on 
immune escape, TMB and other clincopathological and molecular variables 
separately in 1,450 MSS and 350 MSI cancers in multivariable regression models. 
Green circles and red squares represent odds ratios for each variable 
respectively, with whiskers showing 95% confidence intervals. Escape is defined 
as having HLA LOH or a mutation in HLA, B2M or other antigen presenting gene. 
Note that too few MSI metastases were present for associations to be calculated. 
The variables listed are tested relative to reference variables, which are 
(top-bottom, excluding quantitative and categorical variables): non-escaped; 
males; stage A/B; non-metastasis; and no prior non-surgical therapy. Purity, 
ploidy, age and TMB are quantitative variables; location (distal colon or 
rectum) is compared against proximal colon. (c) Immune features of tumours 
and driver genes from different anatomical locations. Top left: PHBR 
immunogenicity scores for 29 location-specific driver genes (11, 8 and 10 in 
proximal colon, distal colon and rectum respectively) in 1,049 MSS primary 
cancers. Top right: PHBR scores for subtype-specific driver genes (21 MSS 
primary, 5 MSS metastasis, 37 MSI, 16 POL) in 1,933 CRCs. Bottom left: 
frequencies of mutations in 18 driver genes common to different locations. 
Bottom right: PHBR of mutations in the 18 location-common driver mutations 
in each location. For box plots, centre line shows median, box limits show upper 
and lower quartiles, and whiskers show 1.5x inter-quartile range. Drivers specific 
to the distal colon had low overall immunogenic potential (median PHBR > 1) 
and lower immunogenicity (higher median PHBR) than proximal colon- and 
rectum-specific drivers (Pproximal v distal = 0.051; Prectum v distal = 0.043). This also 
suggests that there is a stronger immune selection acting on drivers in the distal 
colon. Recurrent mutations in MSS driver genes were less frequent in distal 
than proximal CRCs (P = 0.012). However, the immunogenic potential of these 
mutations was near-identical between locations, suggesting that the observed 
depletion was not a consequence of site-specific driver immunogenicity. For 
example, KRAS G12D was detected in 18%, 7% and 12% of proximal colonic, distal 
colonic and rectal tumours, respectively (median PHBRs of 3.7, 3.9 and 3.6). 
Overall, the data are consistent with stronger immune surveillance in the distal 
colorectum, which lowers the threshold for tolerated immunogenicity, so that 
mutations that would be tolerated in the proximal colon are pruned in the  
distal colorectum. (d) Immune escape mutations in MSS primary tumours from 
proximal colon, distal colon and rectum. Cause of immune escape is colour 
coded. (e) Neoantigen burdens in MSS primary tumours from proximal colon, 
distal colon and rectum. n, numbers of cancers in each location. (f) Neoantigen 
burdens in MSS primary tumours in regions 1-9 from caecum to rectum. P value 
(two-sided) and correlation R are from Spearman’s rank correlation analysis.  
n, numbers of cancers in each location. For all panels, box plots are drawn as  
per panel (c) and statistical analyses used two-sided Wilcoxon tests, unless 
otherwise stated.

Extended Data Fig. 8 | The CRC microbiome. (a) Microbiome decontamination 
process. Tumour and blood prevalence of all species are shown, according to 
methods based on The Cancer Microbiome Atlas. Orange points indicate  
taxa thought to be contaminants due to presence in both blood and tumour 
samples. Outlined points indicate species previously associated with CRC.  
(b) Mean relative abundance of microbial genera for the four main CRC subtypes. 
The most abundant 20 genera are shown. Other taxa are summed as “Others” 
for ease of visualisation. (c) Bacterial load and (d) Shannon diversity index for 
different CRC groupings. The 33 distal and rectal MSI cancers are not included, 
as the small cohort sizes do not allow meaningful comparisons. P-values for 
pairwise comparisons are displayed. (e) Adonis PERMANOVA results comparing 
Bray-Curtis distances against various clinical and genomic factors. R-squared is 
the percentage of diversity linked to each factor. Adonis P-value (two-sided) is 
indicated by symbol: * P < 0.05. ** P < 0.01. *** P < 0.001. (f, g) Examples of two 
taxa distributions significantly associated with anatomical location for 
Akkermansia and Fusobacterium respectively. Multivariate MaAslin2 P-values 
had been calculated from all samples and associations identified at P<0.05 
(two-sided). Univariable P-values are shown in the panel, as these plots do not 
include distal or rectal MSI tumours. (h) E. coli anatomical site distribution for 
pks-positive and -negative MSS CRCs. E.coli proportions in tumours with either 
ID18 or SBS88 contributing to 5% or more of the mutational burden, compared 
to tumours with no pks contribution, are shown by anatomical location.  
No MSI tumours were pks-positive by these thresholds. P-values comparing 
pks-positive and -negative tumours for each location are shown. For panels 
(b-g), numbers of cancers were: rectum MSS 350; distal colon MSS 382; proximal 
colon MSS 454; and proximal colon MSI 282. Where reported, 1,898 primary 
tumours and 122 metastases were analysed. For panel (h), numbers of cancers 
were: rectum pks+ 101; rectum pks- 249; distal colon pks+ 51; distal colon pks- 
331; proximal colon pks+ 28; and proximal colon pks- 426. For all box plots, the 
box is 25th to 75th percentile, the central bar is the median, and the whiskers are 
the largest/smallest values within 1.5 x interquartile range beyond the box. All  
P values are unadjusted from two-sided Wilcoxon tests unless otherwise stated.

Extended Data Fig. 9 | Further details of analyses by anatomical location 
and age. (a) Location of primary tumour and number of variants attributed to 
mutational signatures in microsatellite stable (MSS) primary tumours. Shown  
are mutational signatures associated with tumour location at a Bonferroni- 
corrected two-sided P-value of 0.05 using multiple linear regression considering 
age at sampling, sex, stage, grade and sample purity. n: number of tumour 
samples from location. (b) Age at sampling and number of variants attributed to 
mutational signatures in primary MSS tumours. Shown are mutational signatures 
associated with age at sampling (10 year bins) at a Bonferroni-corrected 
two-sided P-value of 0.05 using multiple linear regression considering sex, 
primary tumour location, stage, grade and sample purity. The Yeo-Johnson 
extension to the Box-Cox-transformation was applied to variant numbers.  
(c) Numbers of patients included in anatomical location or age analyses. Counts 
<5 are masked to prevent patient re-identification. In all panels, boxplots show 
the median value (thick black line), interquartile range (IQR; box bounds), and 
all outlying values (circles). Boxplot whiskers extend to the most extreme data 
point which are no more than 1.5 times the IQR from the box.

The standard Illumina sequencing pipeline (NorthStar v2.6.53.23) implemented in
in the 100,000 Genomes Project was used. Poor quality
sequenced samples were identified based on
on % mapped reads, % chimaeric DNA fragments, averae insert size, AT/CG dropout, and evenness
of
of local coverage.

This is stated in the manuscript. Genomics England permits access to data used for this study subject to the following conditions. Research on the de-identified
patient data used in this publication can be carried out in the Genomics England Research Environment subject to a collaborative agreement that adheres to patient
led governance. All interested readers will be able to access the data in the same manner that the authors accessed the data. For more information about accessing
the data, interested readers may contact research-network@genomicsengland.co.uk or access the relevant information on the Genomics England website: https://
www.genomicsengland.co.uk/research. In order to expedite follow-on analyses, we have made available in the Genomics England Research Environment a
‘Genomic Data Table’ that provides for each patient and their tumour, all the individual clinical and molecular variable data used in this manuscript (see
Supplementary Information Guide). It is recommended that those planning to access data consult the latest Genomics England regulations.
Patients were not recruited to the study according to any sex- or gender-based criteria. Since colorectal cancer is more
common in males, exploratory sex-specific analyses, or analyses using sex as a covariable, were performed throughout the
study. Very few differences between the sexes were found as regards molecular variables and most results were therefore
reported without respect to sex or gender. Some colorectal cancer driver genes are on the X chromosome and may in theory
act differently in male and female patients.
We report the proportions of individuals of different self-reported and genetic ancestries in the study. A detailed analysis of
differences with respect to ancestry is planned for a follow-up manuscript, but a preliminary assessment shows very few
major differences.
Any patient presenting with colorectal carcinoma to one of 13 Genomic Medicine Centres and their affiliated hospitals
throughout England with was eligible for the study, subject to tumour sampling for molecular analysis being possible. Data
are not available on the entire set of individuals invited to participate in the study. Participant characteristics are described in
the manuscript. Median age at cancer sampling was 69 (range 23-94). 41% participants were female. Samples comprised
1898 primary carcinomas, 122 metastases from primary colorectal cancers, and 3 recurrences. Nineteen individuals had an
unreported Mendelian cancer syndrome. We estimated that 90.2% patients were of European ancestry, 2.6%` African, 0.7%
East Asian, 3.2% South Asian and 3.3% mixed. Age, sex, treatment, germline genetics and the presence of co-morbidities or
family history were not factors listed as relevant in patient recruitment. Cancer patients treated successfully with

neoadjuvant therapy may be under-represented owing to a very small cancer or impure sample following that therapy.
Participant recruitment was by NHS staff. Recruitment was open to all patients with colorectal carcinoma who were able to
provide informed consent. Small biases are likely based on patient willingness to take part in research, and also clinical
features (e.g. patients presenting as emergencies were likely to be under-recruited).
Ethical approval was provided to the 100,000 Genomes Project by the HRA Committee East of England – Cambridge South
research ethics committee (REC Ref 14/EE/1112). Samples were obtained as part of the 100kGP cancer programme, an
initiative for high throughput tumour sequencing for NHS cancer patients. Patient recruitment was organised by 13 Genomic
Medicine Centres (GMCs) and their affiliated hospitals across England. All patients provided written informed consent. Study
oversight was subsequently undertaken by Genomics England through regular reporting updates to the GeCIP steering
committee and data Airlock committee.
Sample size was determined by the recruitment achieved by NHS staff, by availability of tumour and matched normal samples for DNA
extraction, and by quality control thereafter in terms of DNA extraction. In addition, some samples were excluded from copy number analysis
owing to failure to establish a fit to reported purity metrics.
Exclusions were based on low sample purity, standard sequencing quality metrics, and availability of clinicopathological data (for sub-studies).
Specific sequence data were excluded from regions of duplications or repeats, low mappability, or seuencing chemistry errors (e.g. strand
bias). All criteria were based on standards or norms in the field, although some additional exclusions were made ad hoc based on our own
findings.
Comparisons with previous work in the field were performed wherever possible. Almost all the common colorectal cancer driver mutations
and copy number alterations found by other studies were also found by us, and there was overlap with previously reported
mutational signatures. However, we only replicated ~7% of previously reported drivers and some signatures were present at much higher
frequencies or absent in our data compared with other data sets. We make relevant comparisons with previous data at various points in the
manuscript. Since some of our discoveries were of uncommon mutations or cancer sub-groups, we did not sub-divide our study into test and
validation patient sets. We did, however, test the stability of mutational signatures and derived clusters by analyses of random sub-sets of the
data.
This was not an intervention-based study and hence randomisation is inappropriate.
N/A. The study has no assessments or procedures that are appropriate for blinding.
