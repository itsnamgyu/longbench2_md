Louise Erdrich, Love Medicine \n one Malcolm Gephardt could tell the bar was busy even from a block away, even from behind the filthy windshield of his Honda. The night was damp, the sidewalks along the center of town laced with dirty snow that had been refusing to melt for near a week. Most businesses had heeded the weather forecast and closed in advance of the coming storm, but when Malcolm approached the traffic light and saw his own squat, brown-shingled building at the bottom of the hill, something lifted in his chest and he leaned over the steering wheel. \u201cOh,\u201d he said aloud to his empty car. Something was different about the place tonight. He felt a pull of energy, that singular happy chaos that can only be found inside a crowded bar when the music is good, people are running into friends, and the whole place is cozy despite the bone-cold world outside. He tried to imagine himself a stranger, tried to see his place as a stranger would. His place. His. Did it look welcoming? Was it just his imagination or did the light spilling onto the street give the whole fa\u00e7ade a faint glow? Yes, he decided as he slid neatly into his parking spot and felt a thrill of hope, of faith, shoot through him for the first time in weeks: in himself, in his town, in these people, in life, in destiny, in following one\u2019s intuition. It was a good town, a good bar, and he was okay, he said to himself silently, like a prayer. Half Moon the old wooden sign above the door read, punctuated by a carving of a crescent moon (people loved pointing out the mistake) that had gone black and moldy over the years, and which Malcolm had scrubbed and then retouched with bright white paint the day after the deal went through. Tonight, there were two people outside, smoking, and another woman just standing there, shivering. A positive sign. But it meant he couldn\u2019t go around to the side entrance because they\u2019d spotted him, were already lifting their chins to him, and now as he approached he had to say all the things: how\u2019s it goin how you feelin looking good yeah more snow coming what a winter I guess nobody\u2019s goin nowhere for the weekend hope to god we don\u2019t lose power what\u2019ll we do without the TV ha ha ha. He had to shake hands, kiss the women hello, pretend he didn\u2019t know what they were talking about when they asked how he was doing, and made serious faces. And when he told them he was good, he was fine, as if he didn\u2019t know what they could be referring to, he had to do a better job pretending when they asked him again not ten seconds later. All of this was far more difficult without a two-foot-wide bar sitting between him and the person asking. It was more difficult than it used to be, that was for sure. But why? Because he believed he knew himself, he supposed. Because he believed he knew Jess. He held fast to the good feeling from a moment earlier and told himself to keep going, to get through the night, and then maybe there\u2019d be another one just like it. Lately, he\u2019d been having thoughts. While at the stoplight on Wappinger a week ago, the sunset a purple bruise above Tallman Mountain and the wide Hudson hidden beyond, he thought, I could keep driving. I could turn right and head for Mexico. Turn left and make for Canada. All he had to do was keep filling the gas tank. He was handsome and charming and people liked him instantly. This was a fact he\u2019d known about himself his entire life, and it would give him an advantage if he were to turn up in some Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois village looking for work. His mind glanced at how much money was in the safe, how much room was left on the credit cards. He itemized everything in his house that he considered dear, but what was there that he truly loved? The coffeepot? His leather chair? Then the light turned, the thought evaporated without taking root, and he arrived at the bar feeling off-kilter, like he\u2019d been on the verge of saying something important, but he couldn\u2019t remember what. As he chatted with the people standing outside, he allowed himself to hope for twenty people inside. Twenty would be a decent night, and if there were twenty people in there, he told himself to not immediately wish there were forty. He refused to look through the window as if it might bring bad luck. Thirty maybe. There might be thirty. It was the coming snowstorm. Gallagher\u2019s and The Parlor hadn\u2019t even bothered to open. Primavera, next door, seated their last table at seven sharp. He wasn\u2019t sure about Tia Anna\u2019s or the new Thai place. If he had to close, he\u2019d close, but until then he\u2019d pull pints. \u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d Roddy said as soon as Malcolm stepped inside, and he felt his optimism wobble for a moment. As always, there was a note of urgency in Roddy\u2019s voice, something in the timbre finding a frequency above all the conversations and reaching Malcolm like a tug on his sleeve. Forty people. More. His friend Patrick was there. Siobh\u00e1n, too, and God love her she was bouncing a hip to the beat of whatever was coming out of the jukebox. His friends had been calling and dropping by his house a lot more often since Jess left, and even if their cheeriness was a performance, he appreciated it so much that one recent Saturday, when he woke up to Patrick and their friend Toby banging around his kitchen looking for coffee filters, he sat up in bed and felt pressure in his throat like he might cry. He and Patrick had been gently making fun of Toby for almost forty years, but there he was, sniffing the creamer he found in Malcolm\u2019s fridge and searching for an expiration date. Were they calling Jess, too? Siobh\u00e1n was, probably. Maybe some of the others. But no one raised the subject, no one wanted to talk about anything explicitly. If there were sides to be taken, they let him know in small ways which one they were on. \u201cMalcolm!\u201d Roddy called over. \u201cHey!\u201d Malcolm nodded at Patrick and Siobh\u00e1n and held up a finger to let them know he\u2019d be just a minute. Roddy had been getting on Malcolm\u2019s nerves from almost the first minute he started working at the Half Moon, but he seemed honest, his uncle had vouched for him, and Malcolm reminded himself that honesty was what he needed most after the disaster of the previous year, when he found out that John had been stealing money since probably the very first day Malcolm took over, just folding stacks of bills and shoving them into his pocket, running only the credit card tabs through the register. This, after all the times Malcolm had covered for him when they both answered to Hugh Lydon. All the coke John shoveled into his nose. His wife on the landline wondering where he was, though she already knew, and then turning her rage on Malcolm because he was stupid enough to have answered the phone. He hadn\u2019t thought twice about keeping John on when it went from Hugh\u2019s place to his place, and stealing was how John had thanked him. Emma, his best bartender, was the one who told Malcolm. It was eleven in the morning, and they had a hundred balloons to inflate for a private party. She took him by the arm and pulled him into the women\u2019s bathroom. For a second, when she put her warm hand on his tricep and locked the door, all his synapses fired. He didn\u2019t want to think about what his expression told her when she stood close to him, because whatever she saw there prompted her to raise her hands as if to tell him to relax, as if to tell him in his dreams, maybe, to get over himself, that she would shelve that conversation for another time, that first she needed to tell him something. She held a finger to her lips and listened, to make sure no one was passing in the hall, but the servers were busy with the helium tank, Andr\u00e9 was cutting long strands of ribbon, and the chairs were still upturned on the tables like a forest of mahogany legs. She told Malcolm that she didn\u2019t want to be a narc, but she started watching John because he wasn\u2019t putting his tips in the jar, and look at Andr\u00e9 working two jobs, and Scotty with a whole slew of kids, she could never remember how many. She certainly wasn\u2019t giving up every weekend of her youth just so this joker could take money out of her pocket. She told Malcolm that when she called John out, he offered her three hundred dollars on the spot. \u201cWas he pulling this when Hugh was here?\u201d Malcolm asked. \u201cI doubt it!\u201d Emma said. No one would have messed with Hugh Lydon. With Malcolm, however, the bad seeds saw an opening. John left without a fight, a sign of guilt, and Malcolm needed to fill his shifts. Roddy\u2019s uncle was a regular, a union boss, Cement and Concrete Workers. Huge guy, with a face the color of a raw porterhouse. Jess used to cross paths with him once in a while when she was newly out of law school and working for Laborers\u2019 International. Every time he saw her, he pointed finger guns and shouted, \u201cMalcolm\u2019s girl!\u201d Jess forgave him for never bothering to learn her name because she so enjoyed when the other attorneys looked at her as if to say, We can\u2019t believe you actually know this guy. Roddy was a good boy, the uncle told Malcolm, very smart when he applied himself, but he\u2019d dropped out of college after two semesters. He wasn\u2019t a drinker, the uncle said. He wasn\u2019t into drugs as far as the uncle knew. Get him away from the computer and he was fine! His dad had split years ago and he needed more male role models in his life. Would Malcolm do him a favor? \u201cMalcolm!\u201d Roddy called again. What Roddy\u2019s uncle failed to mention when he was talking the kid up was that Roddy was annoying. His whole vibe was nervous, and that feeling was contagious, coming from a bartender. It could infect the entire place. Malcolm thought he\u2019d lose that nervous energy once he learned his way around, but he hadn\u2019t, and lately it was worse than ever. That night, he was behind the stick wearing a ratty T-shirt that said \u201cByte Me\u201d and had a picture of an old 1980s floppy disk underneath. There was a dress code, Malcolm told him when he hired him. Wear dark colors. Shave. Comb your hair. Jesus. Malcolm wasn\u2019t ready to deal with Roddy yet, though he wondered for a moment if whatever Roddy wanted had to do with Jess. Maybe she\u2019d called the landline. Maybe she was still on the phone, holding until he showed up. But who called the landline anymore except Malcolm\u2019s mother, who had the number memorized since he started working there twenty-six years ago, or around the Super Bowl, the old-timers who were laid up after hip surgery but wanted to buy a box. Would Malcolm cover them? Of course he would. Of course. But try getting money out of them after they lost. Maybe she was there somewhere. He glanced around. No Jess at the bar. No Jess at the high-top she liked best. No Jess bullying people by the jukebox. She\u2019d memorized the codes for the songs she hated, and in the old days, before the updated system, she would sit there and make sure no one pressed the combination of numbers that would serve up \u201cPiano Man.\u201d But one look at Roddy\u2019s face and Malcolm could see it was a problem with a customer. He took a quick glance around at the various clusters of people. Most were laughing. There was a group playing darts. \u201cGephardt!\u201d someone called over, and he turned to find two of his buddies from the gym. He saw an old neighbor from his mother\u2019s block. A guy from the barbershop. He saw his friend from the deli with a new girlfriend. Cute. Everything seemed fine. Seemed better than fine, actually. He clapped a few backs on his way through the room, and felt his own back clapped in return. There was joy in the air. People making themselves at home. Did the group by the window seem too rowdy? He watched for a moment. They\u2019d hold for a few minutes while he collected himself. And then he saw Hugh\u2019s guy, Billy, sitting alone at a two-top, sipping a whiskey. They made eye contact, and Billy raised his glass as if to say cheers. Cheers to the crowd. To the money the night would no doubt bring in. Malcolm\u2019s stomach heaved. Ignore him, he told himself. Just keep going. He nodded hello to Emma as he tossed his keys in the usual drawer. Her hair was up in a high ponytail, and he really tried not to keep track of these things, but she had a beautiful neck, and in the one second he allowed himself to look, he followed a tendril of hair that had slipped loose. \u201cHow long has\u2014?\u201d Malcolm lifted his chin toward Billy\u2019s table. \u201cA while,\u201d Emma said. \u201cWaiting for you to show up, I think.\u201d He pulled on his tight shoulder to stretch it and then remembered Jess saying that was what he always did when he was worried. He hated getting to the bar so late, but his mother had come by with a meat loaf. She\u2019d looked in his fridge like he was twenty-two again, living in his first apartment. After they ate, as she wrapped the leftovers for him, Malcolm had a vision of Jess rolling her eyes. \u201cI gotta go, Ma,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cYou okay to get home?\u201d \u201cWhat the heck are you talking about am I okay to get home?\u201d she asked. In the old days, on Fridays, the construction workers would have started arriving by four. By six they\u2019d have moved on and the commuters getting off the train would take their places. Around seven he used to start looking for Jess, in case she wanted to have a beer and a sandwich at the bar before she kissed him good night and said she\u2019d see him later. Jess had warned him about making changes, but how could he have guessed the depth of love people had for broken-down, sticky barstools? Who would have believed they\u2019d want to keep listening to the same songs on the jukebox over and over and over, as if music stopped being made in 1996? And he didn\u2019t do even a fraction of what he dreamed of doing. He stuck to things that were relatively cheap and quick. But it turned out people didn\u2019t want things to be nice, they wanted them to be familiar. The only demographic that got stronger once Malcolm took ownership was the underage crowd. The moment he took over, they started trying to get in after ten o\u2019clock with their New York State dupes and their good friends from Ohio and Florida. But a bar full of kids didn\u2019t help the bottom line because they ordered straight sodas for a dollar and then brought their drinks to the bathroom, where they pulled nips out of their pockets and mixed their own. They worked on animal instinct, these kids. It was like a call went out the very hour the bar changed hands, and next thing they started showing up with little bottles clanking in their purses. \u201cI\u2019m sure every generation thinks they invented that move,\u201d Jess said, when he brought that detail home. Where is she right this second? Every time he thought about it and realized he didn\u2019t have the answer, he felt as if he\u2019d taken a flying leap off a ledge without having a clue where he\u2019d land. Up until that week she\u2019d been staying with her friend Cobie, who lived on West Twenty-Third Street with her wife and their two sons. Cobie made sense as a person to go to: a college friend, one of the few close friends who was entirely Jess\u2019s, without any connection to their hometown. But a few days earlier, he called Cobie because Jess wasn\u2019t answering his calls or responding to his texts, and Cobie told him that Jess was, in fact, back in Gillam. Look at that, Malcolm thought, she was inching her way home. To Malcolm\u2019s ear, Cobie pronounced Gillam like she was holding her nose. The one time aside from their wedding that she\u2019d come to Gillam was to meet Malcolm, fifteen years earlier, and she kept pointing out things that she found interesting. That there were seven Catholic churches within five miles was interesting to Cobie, and that so many business names were Irish. She found it interesting that so many cars had a union local displayed on the bumper, and as they walked through town she called out each one they passed\u2014carpenters, sandhogs, scaffolders, ironworkers, steamfitters\u2014as if she never knew these jobs existed. How much do jobs like that pay? she wanted to know. What were the benefits? How long could a person do a job like that? \u201cWhy?\u201d Malcolm asked. \u201cYou gonna start digging tunnels?\u201d Jess gave him a look that said, Watch it. He was sick of Cobie\u2019s observations. He thought she was a snob. But it was interesting that Jess was back in Gillam. She probably wanted to meet up, but she was so stubborn. Well, he had a few things to say now that he\u2019d had space to think. He wouldn\u2019t let her back in without a conversation, that was for sure. He had a memory of her in her twenties, just as they were getting together, how she used to stand with her friends but keep her eyes on him while he worked. How he felt electrified by that, astonished, really, given how brightly she shined and how proud everyone was of her going to that good school, her hair gleaming down her back, the breathtaking perfection of her profile when she turned to talk to the person next to her. Everything he did\u2014mixing, reaching, leaning over the bar\u2014he felt more acutely knowing she might glance over at him for a moment. Since Cobie told him Jess was in Gillam, he\u2019d been picturing her against the backdrop of her mother\u2019s floral wallpaper, the two of them settling in to watch Dateline. He imagined her mulling over how to approach him, how to apologize. He remembered the first time he drove her home. She was not quite twenty-four and he was twenty-eight. They hadn\u2019t done anything yet, though he decided at some point that night that he had to kiss her, and didn\u2019t understand why he hadn\u2019t already. They were four grades apart, just enough to have missed each other in high school. He\u2019d overlapped with her older brother, Mickey, but Mickey was two years younger than Malcolm and played soccer and took all honors classes. Only the name rang a bell. Jess was beautiful and funny and a little different from the other girls. When she stood near the bar, something inside of him wobbled; he became clumsy and self-conscious when normally he felt graceful and fluid, like his movements had been choreographed to precisely fit the narrow space of his workplace, his stage. He couldn\u2019t remember ever feeling self-conscious before meeting her. She told him she had an apartment in Manhattan but came to Gillam every few weeks, to see her parents and go out with her high school friends. On the night when he drove her home for the first time, she sat at the bar and they talked. When her group went to leave, he suggested she stay, keep him company. The thing he remembered most about dropping her off at her parents\u2019 at four in the morning was not the kiss, whatever that had been like, but that she hopped out of the car and ran to the front door like a little kid. She took the concrete steps two at a time, pumping her arms like a high hurdler. When she got to the door, she turned and waved at him before disappearing inside. Not a flirtatious wave. Not a demure Miss America wave. It was a dorky wave: palm wide, vigorous back and forth. Alone in his car, the stink of the bar on his skin as always, he laughed. What a weirdo. She\u2019d probably been driving by their house every day since she came back, looking for his car, trying to think of a way to approach him. Well, let her sweat, he thought. I\u2019m not going knocking. No way. The music was catchy. More people were starting to sway. He made his way over to Patrick and Siobh\u00e1n. \u201cLook at his place,\u201d Patrick said as Siobh\u00e1n gave Malcolm a long, tender hug, the kind he imagined she gave her children when they woke from bad dreams. \u201cPacked to the gills.\u201d Malcolm ignored that, hoping to imply that the bar was full all the time, but then remembered that Patrick knew, of course. His oldest friend, he could read Malcolm easily and knew almost from the start that things were not going as Malcolm expected them to. He and Siobh\u00e1n had their six-year-old\u2019s birthday party there a few months earlier, hired a magician, told Malcolm it was because Eamon loved the mozzarella sticks at the Half Moon and so would his little buddies. They invited parents, too, no doubt so the bar bill would be substantial. Malcolm wouldn\u2019t take Patrick\u2019s money, but then he found it in an envelope in his car, in the compartment where he kept his nicotine lozenges. He looked around at the table where Billy had been sitting, and noted it was empty. He just wanted to be seen, Malcolm knew. He just wanted Malcolm to know that he was keeping close tabs. \u201cDate night?\u201d Malcolm asked, flagging down Bridget, the waitress, to bring his friends another round. Siobh\u00e1n glanced at Patrick, and Malcolm caught a whiff of panic. \u201cYeah, sort of,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n said, but when Malcolm looked at Patrick, Patrick wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes. Malcolm gestured toward the empties in front of them. \u201cSorry about that,\u201d he said as he plucked them up, said he\u2019d send someone to wipe down the table. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n said. \u201cYeah, don\u2019t worry about it, Mal.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m usually here earlier. My mother came by with food.\u201d \u201cDo whatever you have to do,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cWe can hang out later. When you get a minute.\u201d \u201cYeah? Okay good.\u201d It had been over four months since Jess left. Seventeen weeks to be exact. Thanksgiving with his mother, his sister, his brother-in-law who was on the wagon, his three near-feral nephews. He got completely hammered, and his mother, who\u2019d normally give him a little reminder about genetics and his line of work, only guided him upstairs to his high school bed and tucked him in. She had a pot of coffee and a plate of eggs ready for him in the morning and didn\u2019t say a word. Christmas he spent with Patrick and Siobh\u00e1n because his mother went to his sister\u2019s in Boston. New Year\u2019s at the bar. In his own house, he kept the TV on nonstop for company. When his friends came by, they let themselves in through the back slider, something they would never do if Jess were around. It was a shock at first. With adulthood and marriage came a turning in toward one\u2019s own unit, but now, it seemed, he was everyone\u2019s worry, and part of him suspected these friends, grown men, all in their mid-forties, loved the excuse to leave their families on a Saturday afternoon and claim they were checking on Malcolm. \u201cMalcolm,\u201d Roddy said now as Malcolm approached the bar. \u201cHey.\u201d The whole place was full from end to end, and from one group came a sudden swell of people singing. Others joined in from all the way across the room, and it became a call-and-response, a song everyone knew. You might not know how you felt about the song if you were alone in your car, but sung in a local pub? With a drink in your hand? Alongside strangers? Pure magic. The problem was that if Malcolm wanted the same thing to happen the next night, and the next, just having the thought in his mind and looking for the right moment would make it impossible. The warmth, the feeling of camaraderie, even the night sky swollen with snow\u2014it was like chemistry between people\u2014surprising, impossible to predict\u2014but once the charge was in the air, there was no force more powerful. He wanted to take a video and text it to Jess. See? he\u2019d write. Didn\u2019t I tell you? Roddy\u2019s expression seemed worried, but Malcolm refused to let him ruin the moment. Back in January, someone unscrewed one of the urinals from its mount and tossed it out the kitchen exit, where it broke into a dozen pieces. In Malcolm\u2019s history tending bar, it was the third time someone had ripped a urinal out of a wall. This time, at least, the person had turned off the water. Malcolm still couldn\u2019t figure out who\u2019d done it. Someone who knew his way around a stop valve and who carried a wrench in his pocket. That night, when Roddy had come up behind him and told him the urinal was gone, just gone, he looked so upset that Malcolm knew if he said the wrong thing, Roddy would cry. He was certain of it. \u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d Roddy asked, following Malcolm to the men\u2019s room. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean? There\u2019s nothing to get,\u201d Malcolm said. He turned to study the kid. \u201cDrunk people do stupid shit. You need to calm down.\u201d But the urinal incident seemed to make Roddy even more anxious, more on edge during his shifts. Now, as Roddy tried again to flag him down, to get him to stop and listen, Malcolm turned and gave him a look of total faith, of confidence. \u201cThat guy is here. Was here.\u201d \u201cI saw him.\u201d \u201cAnd also\u2014\u201d \u201cRoddy, I need a minute,\u201d Malcolm said, and then he looked around as if to say, I don\u2019t see anything happening here that you can\u2019t handle for one minute. He opened the door to the basement storage room and felt his way down the stairs in the dark. It was musty down there, low ceilinged, a row of kegs on one side, towers of boxes screaming brand logos against the opposite wall. He pulled the string that turned on the light, and raised his hands to the crossbeam above his head. He listened and felt relief bloom and grow inside his body. It would all be fine, he told himself. Heels clicked on hardwood, chairs scraped the floor. He ran his hands over a stack of tablecloths enclosed in plastic, looked at the jars of cherries, olives, vac-sealed drums of mixed nuts that wouldn\u2019t expire for another two years. A full bar. He wanted one minute to soak it in, to remember. He\u2019d been working at the Half Moon for twenty-four years when he bought the place, knew it better than even his childhood home. He knew the smell of it, the way the light looked at different times of year, in different weather. It was at the Half Moon that he learned how to fix a running toilet, how to solder a pipe. He got strong at the bar, bringing case after case of Bud Light and Ultra up from the basement because Hugh wouldn\u2019t add a light beer to the draft options. He learned about cash there, how to accept it, how to turn it away. He learned how to handle the sales reps, which ones would fork over free branded glasses and napkins and throw a few packs of cocktail straws on top, just because they liked shooting the shit for ten minutes. He learned that though he could drink for free at any bar in town, he\u2019d drop more in tips in those places than he\u2019d ever have paid had he come in as a regular customer. He learned how to talk to anyone, how to find common ground. He learned how to be a vessel for people\u2019s worries, their complaints, and he learned that he\u2019d better not have any worries or complaints of his own. He learned how to be friendly to women without crossing a line, he knew how to make them feel beautiful without being a sleaze, and he learned how to walk those same women back when they crossed the line, without insulting them, without embarrassing them. He learned to hide his shock at some of the things they said to him, these perfectly normal-seeming women, these women in their nearly identical faux leather jackets and their wedges, their hair in banana curls like they were all heading to some pageant for middle-aged women, the things that came out of their mouths when they had too much to drink or if they\u2019d been wronged by their boyfriends or husbands. He learned it was possible to appear to the world as an average, ho-hum person but to actually harbor thoughts that human strangers didn\u2019t normally share with one another, until they sat at a bar for too long on a Friday night and encountered a bartender they considered attractive. \u201cI mean, these are mothers, most of them,\u201d he reported to Jess after. \u201cThey have little kids at home.\u201d He saved all his judgments for later, for her. But Jess never wanted him thinking badly of these women. She insisted that they shouldn\u2019t be judged for reaching back to their youth for a moment, chasing a temporary high. When she took this position, he felt baffled. Did she want to say these things to a near stranger? That wasn\u2019t the point, she said; the point was to try to understand wanting some of that intoxicating energy in their lives again for thirty seconds, what harm, because the truth was that most of them would wake up to a pile of dirty laundry and kids demanding a snack. Jess had seen it crush their female friends in a way that Malcolm had mostly been shielded from. She had a friend who, when Jess asked how she did it all\u2014the kids, the house, a job, the cloth napkins at holidays, and so on\u2014lifted a finger to her lips and pulled open a drawer in her bedroom dresser to show Jess where she\u2019d been stockpiling Percocet, collecting it from friends who\u2019d had C-sections but were afraid to finish their prescriptions. \u201cBut you still want a baby,\u201d Malcolm asked. \u201cEven knowing that.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she said, without hesitation. \u201cVery much so.\u201d What had he said in response? He couldn\u2019t remember. The snow was really coming. The air outside was heavy and still. He thought, she might text if she\u2019s worried. She didn\u2019t like weather. He heard the creak of the storeroom door opening, a hesitant step down. \u201cMalcolm?\u201d Emma\u2019s voice. He looked up at her from the bottom of the stairs. She was in her usual work uniform: black jeans, a black shirt, black boots that reached to mid-shin. \u201cYeah?\u201d he said. \u201cJust come,\u201d she said. Emma filled Malcolm in as they crossed the short distance between the storeroom door and the knot of energy by the window. \u201cIt\u2019s Tripp,\u201d Emma said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him like this.\u201d Tripp was around sixty, Malcolm guessed. He was on the short side but broad. He\u2019d been coming in for years, always paid cash, never ran a tab. He always sat by the window, put a few twenties on the bar, and left as soon as the twenties were gone. But tonight was different. Once he drank through his pile of cash, he added more. As they approached, he was waving his arms as he ranted about something, and Malcolm could see in the heaviness of his movements that he was very drunk. Emma told Malcolm that she overheard him asking Roddy how often the draft lines were cleaned. He asked what detergent they used on the glasses. He said to no one in particular that he might call the board of health, that he knew a guy, that it didn\u2019t take much to pull a liquor license. When Emma heard him ask Roddy for a Jameson, she put a pint glass of ice water in front of him instead. Then she sighed, and Malcolm knew they were about to arrive at the more immediate problem. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they were talking about, but next thing he called the tall guy over there a \u2018smug little shit.\u2019 \u201d Part of Malcolm wanted to laugh\u2014every twenty-five-year-old male was a smug little shit\u2014until the crowd parted and Malcolm saw how angry the guy was. \u201cGuys,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cHey.\u201d He made his way to the center of the knot. But it was too late. A surge of raw energy raced through the air. He could smell it as clear as the coming storm: someone was about to get punched. Malcolm put his hand on Tripp\u2019s arm to stay him. He was way too old for this nonsense. Tripp used to take a car service straight from work to the bar on Friday afternoons and as soon as he ordered, he\u2019d take off his tie and drape it over his knee. But it had been a while since he\u2019d come in, now that Malcolm thought about it. He was not usually one to pick fights. The worst he ever did when he had a few drinks was go on about how one day he was going to buy fifty acres in Peru and move there, land was cheap and beautiful. He was going to step out of his life and into another. He\u2019d be off the grid and closer to nature. He\u2019d get healthier, more balanced\u2014a state that was impossible to achieve in the New York metro area. He said most of the parcels near the Sacred Valley had mature fruit trees\u2014fig, guava, apple. The melt running off the Andes brought potable water. He\u2019d put up solar panels and get his exercise doing real work, on the earth. A lot of people had a go-to subject when drinking, a touchstone\u2014an ex-wife, a failed music career\u2014and moving off the grid was Tripp\u2019s. \u201cIf it were that easy, everyone would do it,\u201d Malcolm remembered saying one time, when Tripp had launched into his favorite topic. \u201cYou would do it?\u201d Malcolm laughed. \u201cNo, not me. What am I going to do with fifty acres of guava trees? I\u2019m just saying a lot of people feel exactly like you do.\u201d He couldn\u2019t remember what Tripp had said in reply. He glanced over at Patrick and Siobh\u00e1n, to see if they were watching. Just like that, the magical bubble had burst. The young guy widened his stance, screwed his face into a grimace, and drew his elbow back. \u201cHang on,\u201d Malcolm said, but then the kid released, and next came the unmistakable sound of meat on meat. The wave of energy surged forward, tickled the back of Malcolm\u2019s neck. Tripp slumped. Nick, the bouncer, caught the young man\u2019s second punch mid-flight, as Malcolm tried to get Tripp out of there. But Tripp wouldn\u2019t move. \u201cRoddy,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cHelp.\u201d Nick was dealing with the young people, telling them to gather their things and go. Together Malcolm and Roddy marched Tripp through the swinging door to the kitchen, where they sat him on a folding chair. Andr\u00e9 was lowering a fry basket into oil. Scotty was breaking down boxes in the corner. \u201cNo way,\u201d Andr\u00e9 said, taking one look. \u201cHave Nick toss him.\u201d Malcolm checked his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s only nine thirty. I\u2019ll get him a cab but I want him to sober up a bit. God, I hope no one calls the cops.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not babysitting,\u201d Scotty said. \u201cI need to get out of here before we\u2019re snowed in.\u201d \u201cMe too,\u201d Andr\u00e9 said. Emma, watching from the door, said nothing. \u201cHey, Tripp,\u201d Malcolm said loudly, right near the man\u2019s face. \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d He ran his own company, implied he had a lot of money. Malcolm was almost certain he lived in the big Victorian at the end of Acorn Drive, but he wanted Tripp to confirm before he packed him into a cab and sent him there. But Tripp only pressed his cheek against the cool stainless steel of the walk-in. He closed his eyes. \u201cRoddy,\u201d Malcolm said, feeling a headache coming on. \u201cYou see a guy getting this banged up, you can\u2019t just pour whatever he asks for.\u201d \u201cI was trying to tell you.\u201d \u201cTell me what? That there\u2019s a drunk guy at the bar? Dealing with the drunk people who come in here is the whole job.\u201d Malcolm sighed. \u201cWhat about his tab?\u201d \u201cCash as he went, like always.\u201d \u201cAnd the others? That younger group?\u201d He could tell by Roddy\u2019s face that they\u2019d not paid. He looked at Emma and didn\u2019t even need to say anything. She immediately pushed through the swinging door that led back to the bar to catch them before they left. Roddy was silent for a moment. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were going to kick them out.\u201d \u201cJust go,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cStart busing.\u201d Out front, the night\u2019s momentum had come to a halt. Some new faces had arrived, but it was as if they could sense they were out of the loop, and they didn\u2019t settle in like the earlier crowd had. People were closing tabs, shrugging on their coats. There\u2019d be no more singing. No more dancing. The night was skewed early. Everything that would have normally happened between 8:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. was being compressed into a much shorter period, because of the storm. After another forty-five minutes, the only patrons left were Patrick and Siobh\u00e1n. Malcolm turned the music way down. \u201cHey,\u201d he said as he made his way over to his friends. He saw that they\u2019d already settled their bill. \u201cThat guy almost got his ass kicked,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cHe owes you.\u201d Malcolm sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019ll be his first thought when he wakes up.\u201d He sat down with them. \u201cHaven\u2019t broken up a fight in a while.\u201d The bell chimed on the door, but Emma called out that they were closed. \u201cSo, Malcolm,\u201d Patrick said, with an expression like he was working up to something. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you two tonight?\u201d Patrick and Siobh\u00e1n had some sort of silent communication, and then Siobh\u00e1n turned her whole body toward him. He\u2019d known her since they were fifteen years old, when she started hanging around his group, crushing on Patrick. \u201cMal,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you talked to Jess?\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWe wanted to make sure you knew. Before you hear it around.\u201d Malcolm waited. He felt the blood coursing through his body slow down. He heard his heartbeat in his ears. Behind him, Emma was tipping everyone out. The new waitress left, shouted goodbye from the door. She\u2019d been there since Christmas, but Malcolm still found her crying in the walk-in every few days. He had to deal with Tripp. He had to clean up. And the snow was coming down harder now. He thought about what would be auto-deducted from his account over the next day or so, what sort of dancing he\u2019d have to do to get through another month. But as he sat there, watching his friends\u2019 faces as they worked out the best way to tell him something difficult, everything happening in the bar at that moment seemed to be taking place at a greater distance, and something blurry in his peripheral vision stepped into clear view. He felt his chest get hot. He felt every inch of his six-foot-three frame, the width of his shoulders. And then, not one second later, he was so exhausted that the idea of stretching out on the sticky floor and going to sleep appealed to him. \u201cYou and Jess,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n said, \u201cyou haven\u2019t been talking, have you?\u201d He didn\u2019t bother answering, since she clearly knew more than he did. He felt dead limbed, like he\u2019d just sprinted up several flights of stairs. \u201cYou know she\u2019s here? In Gillam?\u201d \u201cYeah I heard that,\u201d he said, realizing he\u2019d only assumed she was at her mother\u2019s house. Cobie had never actually said that. \u201cMeg Whelan saw her driving down Madison yesterday evening. As a passenger, I mean. Not her car.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d No one spoke for a beat. \u201cJust say it,\u201d Malcolm said. Patrick cleared his throat. \u201cYou know my friend from college? The one who moved here right around the time you bought this place?\u201d \u201cNeil,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cYes,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cBad divorce,\u201d Malcolm added. The floor beneath him felt less solid than it had a moment before. A standard guy in a golf shirt. Nothing special, as far as Malcolm could recall. He showed up at the Half Moon with Patrick one time, both of them already pretty loose. Toby was meeting up with them, too. They\u2019d been making the rounds to give Neil a sense of the town\u2019s offerings, and Patrick had saved the Half Moon for last, so they could really settle in. But Malcolm had been distracted that day, had argued with a vendor, and the feeling of being behind was becoming more and more familiar. After, he remembered thinking he should have been more welcoming. \u201cI knew it,\u201d he said, though he had not known it, not even close. What they\u2019d come to tell him\u2014it was obvious now that the visit had a purpose\u2014would have been anyone else\u2019s first suspicion, but not Malcolm\u2019s. He tried out the idea sometimes, but only to remind himself that he wasn\u2019t dumb, that he\u2019d considered all possibilities. But it just didn\u2019t compute. They were having trouble, but they were a pair. Jess\u2019s face, her body, her moods\u2014they were all as familiar to him as he was to himself. Malcolm tried to conjure up Neil\u2019s face so he could study it, this near stranger, but it was just too far-fetched, that a person he didn\u2019t know at all could have anything to do with the person he knew best. \u201cWho told you?\u201d \u201cHim. Neil.\u201d Patrick looked away. \u201cHe told you? Not her?\u201d Malcolm studied Siobh\u00e1n. \u201cDid she tell you?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not answering my texts.\u201d \u201cSo it might not be true.\u201d Neither Patrick nor Siobh\u00e1n could think of something to say to that. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Patrick said finally. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want you to feel stupid,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n said. \u201cWe thought best you hear it from us. But I think we should keep in mind what Jess has been through, and\u2014\u201d \u201cHow does she even know him?\u201d Siobh\u00e1n looked down at her hands. \u201cThey met at our house\u2014\u201d \u201cLike barbeques and things? I met him there, too. There must have been something else.\u201d \u201cYou know how it is. We get together on a Saturday and you\u2019re here at the bar. Jess always comes. And so would Neil this past year or so.\u201d All three of them looked around the bar as if seeing it for the first time. \u201cBut did they talk? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a lawyer, too,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cBig firm. Graduated law school around the same time Jess did. I guess they have mutual friends.\u201d \u201cI knew that,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cI remember that. Somebody from her old study group is at the same firm he\u2019s at now.\u201d He had little facts tucked away about everyone. Not gossip, he didn\u2019t like gossip, but conversation pieces should a person turn up at the Half Moon feeling low. \u201cAnd what? You\u2019re telling me it\u2019s serious?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n began, but Patrick shook his head almost imperceptibly, so she swallowed back whatever she was about to say. Malcolm was relieved. Which would be worse, that it was serious or that it wasn\u2019t? What an odd question. He didn\u2019t want details. He wouldn\u2019t be able to take them in. All these weeks he\u2019d been running through the things he\u2019d done, the ways he could have been better, but really Jess had been deep into a story that spun away from him entirely. He could feel his pulse as it pushed his blood through his body. \u201cShe\u2019s going through something,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n said in a near whisper. \u201cThat\u2019s what I keep telling myself. She\u2019s going through something that the rest of us can\u2019t understand.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t understand it? You\u2019re including me in that?\u201d Roddy was wiping down the bar. What a night it had been. If Malcolm could capture lightning in a bottle every time, he\u2019d be okay. But if he couldn\u2019t, what then? He couldn\u2019t operate a place that was only half-full three nights a week. He was forty-five years old and he\u2019d never had any other job. And he was good at this one. But middle age was looming and he could already see the headline that would arrive with it: that a person could be extraordinarily good at something and still fail at it. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like to think his girls wouldn\u2019t know anyone in school. So I always told Patrick to include him.\u201d Malcolm stood. \u201cYou know what? I can\u2019t do this right now.\u201d Last time he spoke to Jess was a full month earlier. He was carrying a bag of groceries into the house when he saw her name light up the screen of his phone, so he dropped the bag on the counter and two apples rolled out, bounced to the floor. He stabbed the button that would bring her voice to him. She asked how he was, how the bar was, his mother. His answers must have been brief and she must have heard frustration in his voice because she pulled up short of whatever she called to say, said she had to go. \u201cJess!\u201d he shouted into his phone, but she was already gone. When had she ever stopped herself from saying something? And then he understood she\u2019d been crying. In their whole relationship, he could count on one hand the number of times he\u2019d seen her cry, and each of those times had to do with their plot of garden remaining bare while everyone else\u2019s bloomed so large and wild that they had to work to keep it in check. Follicles too few. Numbers too low. Canceled cycles. Illogical insurance requirements. Waiting to zero out. Waiting longer. Failure to implant. Failure to thrive. Hoping her period would come soon. Hoping it would not come. From the very beginning he was afraid to be specific when they talked, in case he\u2019d get some detail wrong. Little pastel-colored boxes of medication and supplements on the counter, filling an entire shelf of the fridge. Jess on the phone with the insurance company, her color-coded folders spread across the kitchen table, insisting the clinic had already sent a letter, reciting the names of medications like she had a doctorate in pharmacology, like she was fluent in a language he didn\u2019t understand. Overhearing her every Saturday morning\u2014her paperwork time, as she called it\u2014saying, sure, she\u2019d be happy to hold, saying she\u2019d already been holding for an hour, and then lowering her head to rest in her arms. Jess telling Malcolm that she didn\u2019t fucking know what she wanted for dinner, because she\u2019d been on the phone all fucking day, and then saying sorry, she was sorry, she was just frustrated. Malcolm standing beside her chair with a feeling like he was apart from something. Like if he reached his hand out to touch her, there\u2019d be something in his way. When was the first time he had that feeling? The night at her friend Rachel\u2019s wedding, in the restroom of a yacht club in Hyannis. He thought about that night a lot since she left. She\u2019d asked him to come with her, to hold her dress. She unzipped and lifted the gown over her head, handed it to him, and then opened the little cooler bag she\u2019d stashed at the coat check. He folded her dress over his arm and could feel the warmth of her skin coming off the material. Once undressed she panicked. The sink edge was too narrow. The drain plug was missing. What if everything disappeared down the pipe? Before he could think of a solution she dropped to her knees, and unfolded a triple layer of paper towels on the tiled floor. When she was satisfied she placed her little bottles of saline and powder on top of the towels, her needle and plunger, too. \u201cCan I help?\u201d he asked as she mixed the contents of one tiny bottle with another. \u201cI got it,\u201d she said and smiled up at him, no doubt having the same memory he was having right then, of Malcolm sweating through his T-shirt the one and only time he\u2019d done an injection for her, a trigger shot that had to go into her back, which she couldn\u2019t reach. Once it was done, he remained seated on the closed seat of their upstairs toilet until his heart stopped racing while Jess pressed her open palm to her back and counted to thirty. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem like a doctor should be doing this?\u201d he asked that night. The wedding in Hyannis was the first time she had to give herself an injection outside of their home. They hadn\u2019t been through everything yet. It was still very much the beginning, though they didn\u2019t know it at the time. She\u2019d canceled dinners, wriggled out of business trips, but their friends\u2019 wedding date couldn\u2019t be changed and couldn\u2019t be skipped. When the save-the-date came, she thought she\u2019d be pregnant by the time the day arrived. Looking at her crouched on the floor, her expression so determined, he felt a swell of love for her, for what they were trying so hard for. He watched closely as she took hold of her belly, as she pushed the needle in. There was a nine-piece band in the other room. The walls thumped with sound. The swell of flesh above the elastic of her underwear looked vulnerable and pale. She was worried all the medications were making her chubby, but he thought she looked so pretty that night. \u201cI set a timer for the next one,\u201d she said without looking up. She\u2019d need three shots in all, spaced about an hour apart. \u201cBut I can handle it now that I have a system.\u201d She gathered up the paper towels and told him to go have fun. \u201cI can hold your dress again.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d she said, and rose onto her tiptoes to kiss him before stepping back into her heels. An hour later he was just leaning across the bar to order a drink when he looked over and saw her walking toward the bathroom with her little bag tucked discreetly at her side. That wedding was the first time he put a name to the worry he\u2019d been feeling, the vague sense of panic he had that he was forgetting something, that there was something he needed to do. But they\u2019d stopped all that. The bruises on her belly faded. The binder that sat on the windowsill for almost seven years was moved to a desk drawer. Malcolm would never again have to jerk off into a plastic cup in a fluorescent-lit room. He\u2019d never again have to walk down the hall to let the nurse (always young, always female) know his cup was labeled and waiting. He thought, at first, they\u2019d go right back to the way they were before. He thought she\u2019d start stopping by the bar again, to surprise him. He thought she\u2019d start grinning at him again, looking at him like she knew a juicy secret. It\u2019ll take a while, he told himself, have patience. But then she was gone. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mal,\u201d Patrick said at the Half Moon as Malcolm\u2019s wheels spun. \u201cI thought maybe you knew. And I\u2019m sorry we did this here. I thought telling you here at the bar would be better, but now I\u2019m thinking this was a bad idea.\u201d \u201cI told you,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n said. \u201cYeah, she did tell me. I thought you\u2019d feel sort of protected here\u2014your house is crazy lonely right now, buddy\u2014but Siobh\u00e1n disagreed. Anyway. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. You want help turning chairs or anything? The snow is picking up.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Malcolm said, but he didn\u2019t move. He had questions forming, but he didn\u2019t want to ask them. Despite how mixed up he felt, he also detected some calm at his center for the first time in many weeks, a pinhole of light that would help make everything easier to read once he had the energy to think about what his friends had said. He\u2019d learned over the seventeen weeks since Jess left that waiting for something to happen was exhausting, as if a door slammed four months earlier were still slamming, and he was still standing there, flinching, body tensed, waiting to find out what would come after. Now he knew, he supposed. In a tiny way, it was a relief. Siobh\u00e1n and Patrick were the last customers to go, and when they opened the door, the snow swept through the vestibule and into the bar. \u201cHow\u2019s our friend?\u201d Malcolm asked Roddy. \u201cHe left,\u201d Roddy said. \u201cMust have gone out the kitchen exit.\u201d \u201cReally? It\u2019s all ice back there.\u201d Malcolm walked through the kitchen, opened the door that led to the alley, and squinted into the dark to make sure Tripp wasn\u2019t splayed out with a broken leg. He turned on the flashlight on his phone and took a few careful steps out. He shined the light in every direction. Jess, he thought. Jess and Neil? Who started it? Did she place herself in just the right spot, give him a sign that she wouldn\u2019t object? Or had he caught her in a certain mood and then she hadn\u2019t known how to rewind? The motion sensor went on, and Malcolm watched the snow fall through the cone of light. For a moment he forgot why he was out there, what he was supposed to be doing. The alley was empty except for the dumpster, a few dozen boxes flattened and tied up with twine, a pile of broken packing crates that had been sitting there for at least a year. \u201cYou\u2019re still here,\u201d he said to Emma when he returned to the main room. It was an early night for all of them, but with the snow suddenly falling faster, he was starting to feel as if they should have closed hours ago. Emma had to drive to Yonkers. The bridge would be backed up. Roddy was counting his cash, and everyone else was gone. Malcolm sucked in a little, worried he was getting a belly. Jess said he\u2019d be able to carry it when the time came, he had that kind of frame. She said it like it was inevitable because his father had had a belly, his uncle, both dead now, struck down by heart attacks in their forties. He dropped his hands to the edge of the bar and held tight. Emma was looking at her phone, her fingers flying over the screen like she was playing an instrument. He could offer her a place to stay if she was worried about driving in a snowstorm. She knew his house was empty. No big deal. They\u2019d get home pretty early. They could watch a movie if she wanted. \u201cYou okay to drive in this? You\u2019re welcome to crash at my house.\u201d He tried to say it casually, as if the thought had just entered his mind. For a moment, when she looked up and locked eyes with him, a hundred and one calculations passed over her face, but in the end she said she\u2019d drive slowly, her tires were brand new. \u201cGreat,\u201d he said, not sure if he was disappointed or relieved. \u201cGood. Be careful.\u201d The plow passed as Emma left. Malcolm took one last look around. \u201cAll set?\u201d he said to Roddy as he put on his coat. He held the door for Roddy to step through first, and as he turned to lock it, it occurred to him that he should offer Roddy a lift home. \u201cGood night,\u201d he said instead. \u201cYeah good night,\u201d Roddy said, and then: \u201chey, I been meaning to say, you know, better late than never, sorry about Jess. That was her friend, right? The lady you were talking to?\u201d \u201cRoddy,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cYou and I aren\u2019t talking about Jess.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d Roddy said, his cheeks instantly flushing bright red. \u201cSorry.\u201d And then, watching the kid lope up the street in only his windbreaker, hunched against the storm, threadbare sneakers, he felt like a monster. Here was this boy, less than half Malcolm\u2019s age, who could not even choose a playlist when Malcolm asked him to last week. He had his life savings rolled up in his jeans pocket. His uncle claimed he was smart, that he was a whiz with computers, so what the heck was he doing with his life? Malcolm had promised to look out for him. A moment later, Malcolm pulled up beside him. \u201cWant a lift?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Roddy called over, without breaking stride. \u201cI prefer to walk.\u201d It was so unexpected that Malcolm laughed. I prefer to walk, Malcolm repeated to himself as he drove away. \n two In May of 2004, they were twenty-five and thirty, which meant they were not too young, not even close. The show Friends was about to air its final episode, and the characters\u2019 faces were on buses all over the city. The baby would be born when Jess was twenty-six, well into adulthood, a solid education under her belt. Cobie was having friends over and was distracted by assembling snacks and straightening up while Jess watched for Malcolm\u2019s car from her bedroom window. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a bit,\u201d she called out to Cobie when she spotted his black Nissan, and ran down the stairs and around the corner, where he always got lucky with parking. When he found a spot, they walked to Duane Reade and, shocked by the prices, picked the cheapest test. But then as they waited on line and Malcolm read the small print on the box, Jess knew that no matter what the result, she wouldn\u2019t trust it because it was half the price of the others, so she told him to hold their place while she went back and picked the most expensive. When she returned, he pulled her close and kissed the part in her hair. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t worry either,\u201d she said, circling both arms around his waist. Waiting ahead of them were ten other New Yorkers getting bits and pieces of daily life: mascara and Benadryl and condoms and greeting cards and toothpaste. It was a beautiful spring night. She didn\u2019t want to take the test at her apartment because Cobie was home and would have questions. Malcolm was surprised that she\u2019d said nothing of her suspicion to anyone else, not to Cobie, not to anyone, and felt moved by it, a secret that was entirely theirs alone. So they walked the city for over an hour, the box shoved into Jess\u2019s bag, until she couldn\u2019t take it anymore and suggested running into the bathroom of a Pizza Hut they\u2019d passed as they were walking through Times Square. \u201cI\u2019m coming, too,\u201d Malcolm said, following her. \u201cYou think I\u2019d wait outside for this?\u201d On the phone with him earlier that day she said on a scale of one to ten in terms of being sure she was at an eight, but now that she was about to actually pee on the thing, an eight felt overly dramatic. \u201cSo where are you now?\u201d he asked. \u201cA five?\u201d \u201cMore like a three,\u201d she said. She made him turn around and plug his ears because she didn\u2019t want him to see her pee but she also didn\u2019t want him to hear. He laughed, \u201cI\u2019ve seen you in more compromising positions.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d she said. She was two weeks late. She was unusually tired. Things smelled weird but this was Manhattan and there had been a stretch of hot days. \u201cWhat now?\u201d he asked as they huddled close together to look at the stick. \u201cThe directions say it can take up to two minutes.\u201d Out in the jam-packed restaurant, a song he loved was playing over the din. He hooked his fingers in her two front belt loops and pulled her close. He\u2019d once come out from behind the bar at the Half Moon to dance to this song. A woman made an offhand remark that there was nothing better than a big man who was light on his feet, and Malcolm asked if anyone would like to see what that looked like. He touched his tie, had a moment of stillness, and next thing he hunched his broad shoulders and took off. The crowd clapped to the beat and made a circle around him. He danced faster, better. I love this guy, Jess thought that night. After one chorus he went back behind the bar as if nothing had happened. Remembering that, Jess understood that before the song was over, they\u2019d know. Someone banged on the door, and Malcolm shouted that it would be a minute. She peeked early, showed him, but they held their reactions until they got outside, away from the long lines of tourists ordering stuffed crusts to-go. It had gotten dark in the short time they\u2019d been inside. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be upset, right?\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be upset. We\u2019re supposed to ask each other how this happened. Then I\u2019m supposed to say you don\u2019t have to feel obligated. Are you upset?\u201d She studied him under the bright lights of Times Square, a false daytime at night. He didn\u2019t seem upset. He was unflappable. She\u2019d seen it at the bar and she was witnessing it now. \u201cNope,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d He was built to take a blow, rock back on his heels for a moment, maybe, but never fall. We can do this, she thought, and knew he was thinking the same. She didn\u2019t know how, it would no doubt get complicated, but she knew in her heart that they could. The sidewalk was thick with people. Usher was on the ten-story screen above them, saying how much he loved New York while \u201cYeah!\u201d played in the background. There was no mystery; they both knew exactly how it happened. She forgot to renew her birth control prescription. To get a fresh pack of pills before heading to Gillam for the weekend she\u2019d have to wait at Health Services for probably over an hour since she didn\u2019t have an appointment. If she waited, she\u2019d miss the best train, and she wanted to get to Gillam as soon as possible, get to him. Hours later, when she told him, he said it was fine, he\u2019d pick up condoms, or they could skip it this time, it was up to her. But she didn\u2019t want to skip it. What could happen? One little time. But then it turned into several times, because she stayed the whole weekend and he never got around to buying condoms and she didn\u2019t make it to Health Services until Monday. \u201cI want to marry you, Jessie,\u201d he said. \u201cNot because of this. I wanted to anyway but I was thinking about how I\u2019d ask.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou are\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d She knew why she loved him, but she wasn\u2019t sure why he loved her. He appeared to be struggling with something, finding the right word, nailing down an exact thought, and even seeing him struggle opened something in her and she knew that his was the name written onto her soul, no matter what came next. \u201cYou\u2019re kind and funny but there are a million women like that. You\u2019re smart, obviously, but it\u2019s not that either. You\u2019re different. You see things differently. It\u2019s like I knew you right away. I\u2019m never more myself than I am when I\u2019m with you. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it.\u201d \u201cMalcolm,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d marry you tomorrow.\u201d \u201cSo let\u2019s,\u201d he said, sweeping her up roughly. \u201cCareful! The baby!\u201d She laughed, and he clutched his head as he stared at her midriff. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d \u201cI never wanted a wedding. Like in a hall with centerpieces and stuff. That\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve never once had a fantasy about a wedding dress.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cThe courthouse sounds perfect to me. Quick and easy. Walk to lunch after.\u201d \u201cWell, maybe a party at the bar, right? Something low-key?\u201d She laughed, \u201cOf course.\u201d And then her expression changed. \u201cOh God. You have to come with me to tell my parents.\u201d \u201cWill they want us to do it in a church? My mother will definitely say something about that but she won\u2019t really care.\u201d \u201cWell, yeah, but\u2014\u201d She laid a hand on her stomach. \u201cI think that ship has sailed.\u201d \u201cWhat about school? We have to find a place to live.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m done after finals. I\u2019m about to accept that position with Laborers\u2019 International. I take the bar in July. We have nine months to get ready. Well, eight I guess. I think my mother will help as long as we\u2019re close by. It can work.\u201d \u201cAnd Hugh has already said something about wanting to retire. He asked if I\u2019d be interested in buying the place.\u201d \u201cAnd you would be interested, right? You love that bar.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to be so good.\u201d Twelve years later, when Hugh finally announced that he was buying a house in South Carolina, that he couldn\u2019t take winters in New York anymore, not with his aching hip or his neuropathy, Malcolm figured that was it, he\u2019d forget about all the hints he\u2019d dropped over the years and give the Half Moon to one of his dipshit sons. Malcolm would have to find a job for the first time in twenty-four years. But one morning before opening, when Malcolm was going through receipts, Hugh came in, bypassed his usual chair, and sat on a stool like a regular. \u201cMalcolm,\u201d he said, laying his meaty hand on the bar, his wedding band so deeply embedded into the fat of his finger that Malcolm didn\u2019t know how it wasn\u2019t cutting off his circulation. \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019d like to see happen.\u201d His face was swollen and red, a drinker, though Malcolm had never once seen him drunk. He took a pen from his pocket and wrote two numbers on a napkin. The first was the price for the business alone, and the second was the price for the business with the building included. The building didn\u2019t look like much, and needed a lot of work, but a stone\u2019s throw from the city meant it had real value. Then he coughed into his fist for half a minute, hacked and growled and wheezed. When he stopped, he rested his hand on his enormous belly, and told Malcolm he\u2019d give him time to think about it. \u201cYou okay, Hugh? You good?\u201d Malcolm put a glass of water in front of him. \u201cFine, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Hugh wouldn\u2019t admit it even if he knew that very hour would be his last, but they had their lines to say. Hugh had known Malcolm since he was a kid, had known his father, though he never wanted to talk about Darren Gephardt when Malcolm brought him up. Hugh said if Malcolm didn\u2019t have the money, or if the bank wouldn\u2019t back him, they\u2019d work something out. Later, as he watched Hugh wedge himself into his Cadillac, the steering wheel toylike in his giant hands, Malcolm wondered what would have happened if his father had not died at forty-three. Would Malcolm have eventually managed Gephardt\u2019s, his father\u2019s bar? Would he have inherited it by now? It was a block from Penn Station, and Malcolm could still feel the energy of the place, the people and personalities that swept through. Cops and criminals drinking side by side, women who sat so primly at the bar but whom his father said to stay away from once he turned sixteen and they started eyeing him. When it wasn\u2019t too busy, his father used to take meetings at a two-top in the back and once, during a big renovation when the bar was closed for a few weeks, a man Malcolm had never seen before pulled aside the thick plastic dust flaps at the front and approached his father cautiously, as if he needed permission. It was the day after Malcolm\u2019s ninth birthday, and he\u2019d just gotten in trouble for firing a nail gun he found lying on a windowsill. When the adults were distracted, he pressed the trigger three times\u2014three loud cracks\u2014and like magic there were the nailheads, shining like jewels on a wall that had just been taped and mudded. His punishment was to sit in the corner and do nothing for one hour, but a guy called Truck who worked for his dad slipped him a jumbo bag of Lay\u2019s. From his angle on the floor he entertained himself by looking at everyone who walked by outside. \u201cLook at this kid,\u201d his father said to Truck, and shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s enjoying himself.\u201d The man who came in approached his father and Truck just like their old Jack Russell, Lucky, did when he wanted his belly rubbed but was afraid to come too close in case he got a kick instead. Malcolm couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying but his father\u2019s voice seemed different, cold. He felt worried enough to put down the bag of chips, rub his greasy fingers on his sweatpants, and glance down the street to see if he might spot his mother returning from her errands. Nothing bad would happen if his mother were there. The man hated his father, it was obvious. And he seemed more nervous than adults usually were. His dress shirt was untucked, his tie askew. His father made no effort to make him feel at home like he usually did when people came into his bar. Malcolm got a scared feeling in his belly. He should shout, he thought. He should do something. But next thing his father nodded toward Malcolm, all three men looked over at the small sawdust-covered boy in the corner, and without discussing it they stepped into his father\u2019s office and closed the door. They still hadn\u2019t come out when Malcolm\u2019s mother returned. \u201cDarren?\u201d Gail called, when Malcolm told her where they were. She tapped lightly on the office door with her fingernails, tilted her head to listen. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at home,\u201d Darren said, without opening the door. \u201cWhat were they doing?\u201d Malcolm asked his mother on the drive home. \u201cWhat were they saying?\u201d He tried to explain what he\u2019d seen, what a scary face his Dad made at the guy, scary mostly because Malcolm had never seen it before so it seemed like his own dad was a stranger for a second, but his mom said it was nothing, it was business, his dad was his dad and he loved him. Hugh had three sons, and not one of them had ever worked at the Half Moon. Not one of them had ever held a family party there or shown up half in the bag. They didn\u2019t ask their daughters to get up on the bar to dance a reel as Malcolm\u2019s sister, Mary, had been asked to do by their father many times when Gephardt\u2019s was booming, a success story right there in the shadow of the busiest train station in the world, so busy that Malcolm\u2019s mother learned how to drive on highways and parallel park so they could go to the city to see him. Otherwise they never would. \u201cWhere did all that money go?\u201d Malcolm asked over the years, tentatively at first but then more bluntly. He\u2019d seen the photos. He\u2019d heard the stories. Muhammad Ali had eaten a meal at Gephardt\u2019s within a week of returning from Ireland, where he barely beat Al Lewis in eleven rounds. A famous actor had come by and, sick of waiting, drank a warm beer a stranger left behind. Malcolm\u2019s mother had been living so carefully since Malcolm was eighteen that it was obvious there was no surplus, no retirement account, no special accommodation made for a career so precarious that one was always having to borrow from Peter to pay Paul. \u201cBut Muhammad Ali,\u201d Malcolm said to his mother once. \u201cThe place must have been pretty popular for him to go there.\u201d His mother scoffed. \u201cYour father knew his driver! They grew up together. Can\u2019t pay bills with stories.\u201d \u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd the rent was going sky high. We couldn\u2019t have held on to it if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking, there was no way. Not without your dad\u2026\u201d Her sentence petered out, as if she couldn\u2019t quite figure out how to phrase something. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWell, he was a bookmaker, of course.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d She looked at him. \u201cYou knew that.\u201d \u201cYou always said that bar was a mint.\u201d \u201cWell, it was. But that part of it?\u201d She passed her hand in front of her face as if waving away cigarette smoke. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep that up.\u201d Once in a while, Little Hughie came by the Half Moon at his father\u2019s bidding, but he walked through the place like a foreigner in an unfamiliar land. Malcolm would greet him warmly, ask how he was, but Hughie always seemed uncomfortable, so Malcolm didn\u2019t bother with him much beyond that. Would be nice if he stayed for a drink, remembered some funny things about high school, but Hughie always had to be somewhere. Rumor was when his boys turned eighteen, Big Hugh warned them to never let him catch them drinking there, embarrassing themselves. He wanted them to be businessmen, wear suits every day. But wasn\u2019t Hugh a businessman? Malcolm thought. Wasn\u2019t he in fact better off than those guys in suits because he didn\u2019t answer to anyone? In addition to the drinking, the nightly peeling of someone off a stool while that person either wept or cursed at you, Hugh said he didn\u2019t want his boys feeling the weight of a stack of cash at the end of a night. It was too tempting for a young person, and giving in to that temptation was shortsighted. Something about that nagged Malcolm, who was the same age as Little Hughie and sat next to him in American history their senior year. Malcolm remembered Hughie giving a two-minute speech on the wedding of the rails, and watching as the sweat beaded at his hairline, ran down by his ear. Malcolm went up there next and winged it, having completely forgotten he was supposed to present that day, and the podium was dotted with Hughie\u2019s sweat. Malcolm got a B and Hughie got a C. But Hughie did a summer enhancement program at Columbia when they graduated, the same summer Big Hugh taught Malcolm how to change a keg, how to free pour, how to make his own syrups if the bar ran out. \u201cSurprised your father never showed you,\u201d Hugh said once, and more than two decades later, Malcolm still thought about him saying that\u2014his exact expression and tone\u2014every time he changed a keg. \u201cHe was proud, your father,\u201d Hugh said another time, out of nowhere, or so it seemed, until Malcolm noticed a news story about a shooting outside Penn Station on the TV over the bar. \u201cSome people thought he was arrogant.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cProbably because he bought that bar in the city instead of up here. He didn\u2019t think much of this place, I don\u2019t think. I\u2019m sure he thought it was very small town compared to Gephardt\u2019s.\u201d Malcolm turned to look at him, but Hugh was still staring at the TV. \u201cHe had a steak on the menu for like thirty bucks at Gephardt\u2019s. Keep in mind this was in the seventies. You didn\u2019t hear of that kind of thing in an Irish pub.\u201d \u201cYou were there? You never said you went there.\u201d \u201cOh yeah, I was there a lot of times.\u201d \u201cSo you knew my dad pretty well?\u201d Hugh seemed to consider his words. \u201cI knew him.\u201d He turned to Malcolm. \u201cDid he ever say anything to you about me? Or about the Half Moon?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cReally? Nothing?\u201d Malcolm shrugged. \u201cNo.\u201d Hugh nodded, and Malcolm hoped his feelings weren\u2019t hurt. Maybe he should have told Hugh that his dad loved the Half Moon, but the truth was he never remembered his dad acknowledging its existence at all. He only had eyes for the city and often said if it weren\u2019t for Gail, who insisted on a yard as soon as Mary was born, they\u2019d be living somewhere downtown. \u201cSo you remember it? Your dad\u2019s place?\u201d \u201cYeah, of course I remember it. I was eighteen when he died.\u201d After Gephardt\u2019s it became a more generic sports bar called Over Time. They took down the photos of the Irish countryside and replaced them with signed posters of athletes. \u201cI was just wondering if you visited him there. If he let you and your sister there when you were growing up.\u201d \u201cYeah he did. Why?\u201d \u201cJeez, Mal, no reason. I\u2019m just asking.\u201d Once in a while, especially when Malcolm was younger, Hugh would comment that his own boys weren\u2019t as wise as Malcolm, and he\u2019d tap the side of his nose. It was a compliment, Malcolm always told himself after, and couldn\u2019t for the life of him figure out why it unsettled him. Everyone knew being wise was a good thing. Alone in the bar after Hugh made his offer, eleven thirty in the morning, a tower of receipts on the spike, Malcolm poured one small scotch and drank it slowly as he looked at the yellow sunlight pouring in through the windows, falling on the beat-up tables and chairs. The temperature was brisk but the forecast looked lovely for that whole week, and he thought about how nice it would be to sit outside. Then, with Hugh\u2019s words still echoing, he saw it right before him: everything the place could be. Stonework, string lights, umbrellas, patio heaters through November, blankets they could lend if people got chilly, like they did in Germany, according to Jess, who\u2019d been there. He\u2019d have half-moons stitched into the corners. Maybe on the umbrellas, too. He could have T-shirts available for sale like they did at bars down the shore. It was a risk that they could just barely take on. As manager he made a salary they could rely on. As owner he\u2019d have to look at the net profits each month, invest what he could back into the business, and take whatever was left as income. To do even that much, they\u2019d have to cash out another portion of Jess\u2019s retirement savings. \u201cIt\u2019s really just a question of money,\u201d Malcolm said. He\u2019d taken the night off and had dinner ready when she walked in from work. She was exhausted. She\u2019d been fantasizing about a cold glass of wine since three o\u2019clock. After running to catch the 5:46, the train ended up sitting in a tunnel just outside Hackensack because of system-wide signal problems. When the train lost power and went dark, the woman in the seat next to her started taking small sips of air like she couldn\u2019t breathe. Jess asked if she was claustrophobic, and offered the bottle of water she\u2019d been drinking from, assured the woman she wasn\u2019t sick or anything. The man across the aisle informed them that she was probably cleithrophobic, not claustrophobic\u2014a common mistake. When he turned away, Jess mimed gagging herself, and the woman almost smiled. By the time she got to Gillam, it was after seven. At first she thought Malcolm being home was just a nice surprise\u2014they rarely ate together on Friday nights\u2014but then she realized it was because the day he\u2019d been waiting for had finally arrived and he wanted to talk it out. \u201cJust money,\u201d Jess repeated. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d She didn\u2019t know what he meant\u2014money was the question. He\u2019d made pasta in a cream sauce. Hunks of chicken. The pots and pans he\u2019d used were washed and drying on the rack. As soon as she understood that he didn\u2019t simply have Andr\u00e9 pass two meals out the alley door of the Half Moon, she softened. Malcolm taking over the business felt inevitable, especially when Hugh said his sons had no interest, but he had to see that the building was way out of reach. She didn\u2019t have to sit down with the numbers to know that much. She understood the potential it had, yes, but a big renovation would require even more money. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Hugh said he\u2019d work something out with me if I wanted to buy both,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cA side deal.\u201d \u201cNo way,\u201d Jess said, incredulous. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to be tied to Hugh Lydon. Do you?\u201d \u201cWe go way back! It wouldn\u2019t be like that with me. It would be fine.\u201d Jess thought of the guys who worked for Hugh in varying capacities that no one ever discussed. Men twenty years older than Malcolm, or maybe the same age, it was impossible to tell. They were the type of men who barely spoke but cried at ballads on St. Patrick\u2019s Day. When they came into the bar, Malcolm served them, never charged them, never asked any questions. They ran errands for Hugh, collected rent on apartment buildings he owned in the Bronx that he never referenced but Andr\u00e9 knew about somehow, said the places were complete holes. The guys came in for extra security on big nights, and Jess had a memory of the one called the Grog hitting on her even though she was newly married to Malcolm, who was twenty feet away. Pleasantly buzzed, she was waiting for the bathroom, leaning against the wall. She closed her eyes for a moment, and when she opened them, he was standing in front of her. He put one hand on her hip as if to ask her a question, and she put her hand over his and gave it back to him like she was apologizing, like it was awfully tempting but she was a good girl. It was as if Malcolm didn\u2019t even hear her. \u201cThat second floor would pay for itself pretty quickly. I was thinking I could get an architect to see about getting the roof reinforced to bear weight. I could put up some sort of wood panel, something to block out that ugly section of the parking lot. There\u2019s a nice view up there if you don\u2019t look north. It would have a different vibe than downstairs.\u201d She put her fork down. \u201cYou want to hire an architect? With what? It\u2019s a stretch to buy the business alone and keep it exactly the way it is. And if you so much as change one tiny thing, that crew of old-timers you\u2019re counting on to buy twenty drinks a week will take it personally. Remember when the Brew Pub got new menus? People lost their minds. It was the exact same food, just printed in a different font. And even if everything stays exactly as is, Hugh\u2019s profit won\u2019t be your profit because you\u2019ll be mortgaged to the hilt.\u201d \u201cNo shit, Jess.\u201d Malcolm pushed back from the table. Why isn\u2019t there any money, the expression on his face asked. In the world of bad investments, wouldn\u2019t nearly seven years of fertility treatments be right at the top? At first they could keep up with whatever insurance didn\u2019t cover by going to his safe deposit box, handing over a brick of cash. But it didn\u2019t take that long for the box to empty. All that money\u2014just gone. He stopped himself from saying it aloud, but they knew each other so well that the air between them became legible, and she could read it anyway. He sat there with his arms crossed, his wide shoulders tensed, pretending he\u2019d forgotten what it was he was going to say, but her gimlet eye took it in, every last word. They didn\u2019t talk about it all weekend. Instead they talked around it, a half-moon-shaped sinkhole they were both careful to avoid. On the Sunday after Hugh raised all of this with Malcolm, and after Malcolm raised it at home, she went for a long run and left on the kitchen counter printouts of other bars being offered for sale, scattered around the county. They were all asking less than what Hugh was asking for the Half Moon, but when he looked closely at the thumbnail photos, he could tell they were either smaller or in bad locations or total dives that would need to be gutted. There was no energy in these places, he said. No magic. Plus it meant something that it was the Half Moon, the place he knew best. It meant something that Hugh had handpicked him. There\u2019d be a story to tell. \u201cWell?\u201d she asked on Sunday night. Something had to be decided. \u201cI want to do this,\u201d he said. He turned toward the window but it was dark out, so it was like standing at a mirror. \u201cI just feel like you had your shot and I\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t work but now it\u2019s my turn.\u201d \u201cWhat in the world does that mean?\u201d \u201cI mean\u2014\u201d But she knew what he meant, and she knew he wouldn\u2019t say it. \u201cMalcolm,\u201d she said, approaching him from behind and laying her cheek against the center of his back. \u201cYou deserve everything. Of course you do. But we just do not have the money right now. I know you think that\u2019s my fault\u2014\u201d He sighed. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your fault.\u201d \u201cWell, in any case, it\u2019s not there. We\u2019ve already drained everything we can drain. But we can swing the business. You deserve it and you\u2019ve earned it.\u201d \u201cFor now, yeah, okay,\u201d he said, turning to face her. \u201cMaybe we can strike a deal to buy the building down the road. Maybe he\u2019ll even write that in. The right of first refusal.\u201d She raised an eyebrow to say she was impressed, relieved that this particular argument was over for the moment. \u201cI\u2019ve been researching,\u201d he said. He hadn\u2019t planned on doing anything behind her back, but on the other hand he was certain she\u2019d eventually understand that in business there were moments when opportunities had to be seized. She complained of meetings all day, meetings about meetings, but his line of work was different. Information was packaged inside euphemisms, everything made pleasant and polite until it suddenly wasn\u2019t. Deals were made on handshakes. Oaths sworn over drinks. Shortly after he and Jess came to a grudging agreement, and Malcolm called Hugh to tell him that after giving it much thought he wanted to buy only the business, Hugh stopped by to clear out his personal items from the storeroom. It was ten days before the closing. They ended up talking about the building once again, all the potential it held. Hugh told Malcolm that he\u2019d hold on to it for a while, but then he\u2019d have to sell. And then what? Where would that leave Malcolm? Malcolm thought about his mother saying the rent on Gephardt\u2019s shot sky high after the lease was up. It was a point he\u2019d made to Jess but Jess wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever do anything with upstairs?\u201d Malcolm asked, and Hugh reminded Malcolm that the place was a broken-down diner when he bought it in 1973. He already brought it a long way. He thought about turning upstairs into an apartment, but his interest faded when they ran up against permit issues and, really, he didn\u2019t want to deal with anyone calling him in the middle of the night to say the music was too loud. The bar was packed four nights a week plus pretty much all day on Sundays. What more could he ask for? But a young man like Malcolm? There were a dozen ways a person with vision could make something fresh of the place. And then, running his massive thumb along one of his unruly eyebrows, he offered a private loan so that Malcolm could buy the building, too, without putting any additional money down. The underwriters at the bank would need to know the provenance of a sudden, large deposit, so they\u2019d call it a gift, but between Malcolm and Hugh, just the two of them, they\u2019d work it out. Large gifts were taxed pretty steeply, but Hugh said they\u2019d bundle all that in the repayment, not a big deal. Malcolm immediately understood that making the offer had been the whole point of dropping by. It was simple, really. \u201cI mean, can you think of it as yours if you don\u2019t own the building, Malcolm? That\u2019s what I\u2019d ask myself if I were you.\u201d \u201cJess isn\u2019t so keen on the idea. She\u2014\u201d \u201cJess? I thought you two might have\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Haven\u2019t seen her in a while. I didn\u2019t want to ask.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d Malcolm laughed, but felt a little shaken at the bottom of it. Him and Jess? \u201cShe\u2019s working a lot. Like everyone.\u201d \u201cI really think you should consider it.\u201d \u201cI will.\u201d Malcolm didn\u2019t get a lawyer for the closing, out of respect for Hugh. He couldn\u2019t ask Jess to come with him because she\u2019d find out about his side deal, and then what would he do? Stand there looking at his shoes while she asked Hugh a hundred questions? And also, there might not be any going back now, even if he changed his mind, even if Jess made him. As soon as he told Hugh that he wanted to buy the building after all, he set something in motion, and later that very afternoon Bronx Stevie dropped off a check. \u201cFrom the boss,\u201d he said simply, and then asked for a Guinness. When Malcolm opened the envelope, he found a check written for an amount far larger than the one he\u2019d written when he and Jess bought their house, wiping out all of their savings. Included also was a letter to the loan officer at the bank, explaining Hugh and Malcolm\u2019s long relationship, confirming the money was a gift, free and clear. \u201cThe letter is for show, of course,\u201d Bronx Stevie said, and Malcolm was surprised he\u2019d read it. The envelope had been sealed. He waited two days to deposit the money. Jess always looked at their month\u2019s-end balance, so he waited until the new month. Rumor was that Hugh bought each of his sons their first homes, and though Malcolm was not na\u00efve enough to think Hugh thought of him as a son, twenty-four years of working for him must mean something. After, they celebrated with a bottle of bourbon Hugh had been keeping for a special occasion. Hugh\u2019s lawyer whistled when he saw it, hung around for one, and when he left, Hugh went to his car for a box of cigars, which he offered around the bar. He and Malcolm sat on side-by-side stools, smoking, drinking, talking about the old days, the craziest nights. The time they found a gun on the floor, just lying there under a chair alongside a crumbled napkin. The time someone left an urn of ashes. The time a woman unzipped her dress and stepped out of it, her breasts absolute perfection where they sat in her bra, a silvered C-section scar above her panties, the inscrutable expression on Malcolm\u2019s face when he simply picked up the dress and handed it to her like it was nothing, no big deal, and told her the floor was filthy so she should probably just put it back on. And then, when she did put it back on, right there in front of them, how he\u2019d suggested gently, \u201cIs it time to call it a night?\u201d There were stories Malcolm had forgotten, but they rose up again unbidden like they\u2019d taken place the day before. He felt so full of joy that he wanted to call Jess, tell her to get down to the bar because there was finally something to celebrate. The bar was his! Officially. Not just in spirit but in name and deed. A place he loved. His. He wanted to ask her if she remembered the night she won the ladies\u2019 darts championship. He wanted to ask her if she remembered when that band called her up during their session, put her on the spot, and she surprised everyone with the most clear-throated rendition of \u201cThe Parting Glass.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you knew that song,\u201d Malcolm said at the time. \u201cEveryone knows that song,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone here, I mean.\u201d Her voice was strong and unwavering, and the whole place had hushed to listen. You are full of surprises, he thought that night, looking at her. She had something other women didn\u2019t. She was entirely herself, she never looked left or right to figure out how to be. She could be wild sometimes\u2014dancing and laughing like the rest of them, walking barefoot through town with her high heels hooked on her fingers. But she could be intensely quiet, too. If someone was telling her something important, or if she sensed something was troubling them. If she had something on her mind. He looked over to the corner where she stood to sing that night, but instead of a band set up there was a four-top, three seats taken. People still talked about their wedding party at the bar. How fun it was despite the short notice, Jess a sober bride. It started at two in the afternoon and by the time everyone left it was dawn the next day, Jess sleeping in a chair with Malcolm\u2019s suit jacket draped around her. Malcolm\u2019s roommate had moved out several months before, so Jess moved in with her overnight bag, said she\u2019d get the rest from Cobie\u2019s when they could borrow a truck. Hugh apologized that he couldn\u2019t be there, but he gave them the party as his gift\u2014a table spread with appetizers and a steep discount on the open bar. He had John hang a sign on the door that said the Half Moon was closed for a private event. Cobie had filled the place with flowers, mason jars full of daisies. Jess\u2019s high school friends had gone in on little bottles of champagne as favors, and Gail Gephardt made the cake. Jess\u2019s parents stayed for about two hours, sipping drinks, still shell-shocked, Malcolm supposed. He tried to put himself in their shoes and decided it was nothing to feel insulted about. Jess\u2019s mother was more disappointed than her father, for her girl to have all that promise and then get herself bogged down with a baby before she\u2019d had a chance to find her footing. To be tied to a local bartender for life. \u201cOuch,\u201d Malcolm said when Jess reported that, and she instantly went pale. \u201cOh my God, why did I tell you that?\u201d She hugged him. \u201cBecause it\u2019s insane and she doesn\u2019t mean it. When she\u2019s worried she lashes out.\u201d Gail Gephardt kept glancing over at the Ryans during the brief ceremony at the courthouse, making sure their faces didn\u2019t imply Jess could have done one bit better than her boy. After, the parents all agreed that it would be nice to get a priest to bless the union. Gail said a baby was always good news no matter what the circumstances, but Maureen Ryan didn\u2019t say a word about that. Everyone knew about the baby coming, though Jess\u2019s mother had cautioned her not to tell anyone until she was at least twelve weeks along. \u201cWhy not?\u201d Jess had asked. They were young and beautiful. Everything was ahead of them. Malcolm said he wished his father were still alive to celebrate, and Hugh put his drink down on the bar, as if hearing the thought said aloud took the wind out of him. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot like him,\u201d Hugh said after a moment. \u201cExcept\u2014\u201d \u201cExcept what?\u201d Sometimes Malcolm got the feeling they\u2019d known each other better than Hugh ever let on. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Did you like him? Malcolm wanted to ask, but it felt far too pathetic, hoping his long-dead father was a person people liked. When Hugh finally left, wishing him the best once more, Malcolm picked up his phone to call Jess but got a shock when he saw the time. The closing had wrapped up around two, Hugh\u2019s lawyer had left around four, and it was already eleven thirty. He texted instead. What are you doing? Half asleep. Signed and sealed? All good Heading home? In a bit Let\u2019s celebrate this wknd Yes definitely He picked up the near-empty bottle Hugh had left behind and looked at the label. \u201cSurprised he opened this one,\u201d Malcolm said to Emma, who was behind the bar. \u201cThe price of it.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t it yours now?\u201d she said. \u201cTechnically?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d Malcolm said, stunned. And everyone around them, everyone tuned in to the special thing that had happened that night, the meeting of a fate, the shaking of its hand, all laughed. What if they hadn\u2019t gotten married so quickly? What if that baby had been born? It was like those Choose Your Own Adventure books he used to love as a kid, where you could follow a dozen different paths to a different conclusion, each road forking again and again. The doctor said it was perfectly normal. It happened more than people knew. As many as fifty percent of pregnancies, often before the woman even knew she was pregnant. Between fifteen and twenty-five percent of recognized pregnancies. And it could be for no reason at all, or at least no reason a doctor could isolate. The important thing to know was that there was nothing to worry about. Jess was only twenty-five and the picture of health. When the time came and they wanted to try again, it would more than likely all be fine. Although they were knocked down, surprised by how sad they were, they agreed that good had come out of it. They were bound now. They loved each other and had no regrets. Jess recovered fairly quickly. She started the job with the union. She took the bar exam and passed with flying colors. She said she didn\u2019t know how much she was allowed to grieve, given that it wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d been trying for or even wanted, and that she\u2019d only been nine weeks along. Malcolm told her it wasn\u2019t a question of being allowed, she felt what she felt, there was no rule book. Mostly, he was surprised. They both felt sort of guilty, like maybe they\u2019d done something wrong\u2014stayed out too late or tried to do too much in such a short period\u2014but Jess said she felt better day by day, so Malcolm did, too. They agreed they had to get a bigger apartment and then, eventually, a house. Though they could have handled it, they were sure, now at least they could plan a little. Be ready. Now at least they knew what to expect. \n three Malcolm woke around noon on the Saturday after the storm to the sound of a loud crack, followed by a crash. His mind bleary, he thought for a moment that the noise came from inside the house, but then he heard another crack and looked over in time to glimpse a large, dark shape passing his bedroom window. The image of a body came to mind, someone jumping from the roof. It would be high enough to break a few bones, maybe, but not to die. Plus, no person could have gotten into the house without him hearing. Not Jess, in any case. If Jess so much as drove down their street, he\u2019d feel a chord struck deep in his chest and he\u2019d just know. And then he remembered what Patrick and Siobh\u00e1n had told him the night before. He tried to sit square to it, tried to take a good look, but it was as if what they said\u2014about Jess, about Patrick\u2019s friend Neil\u2014existed behind thick glass. In daylight, from the bed he considered more hers than his, since she used to always be in it when he came home at night, her long body turned toward his side, it felt absurd that she was sleeping, perhaps, at that very moment, in a place that was unfamiliar to him. That she was showering, or moving through rooms she felt at home in, while he, if he visited her, wouldn\u2019t know which door led where. For one second, he thought he might have dreamed it entirely, but then he noticed his clothes from the night before in a heap by the bathroom door, the topography of their bedroom so different without Jess\u2019s lotions and compacts and makeup brushes and multivitamins spread over the top of her dresser. Without six-and-a-half-years\u2019 worth of prescription bottles and hormone creams. Without her bangles and hoop earrings. He looked at his phone. No new texts. No missed calls. He googled her name as he did most days, and there she was, Jessica Gephardt, senior counsel, wearing a blazer, her hair neater than it was in real life. He looked back at the last text she sent, nearly a month earlier. Malcolm, I canceled Dr. Hanley going forward. He\u2019s charging us full price for the last two sessions because he held the hour but we didn\u2019t show. No abbreviations. Perfect punctuation. What about the therapy sessions before that? He wondered if she went alone, and whether that was ethical, talking about him in couples therapy when he wasn\u2019t there. She found Dr. Hanley because she thought he\u2019d help her remind Malcolm of what they were working so hard for. But instead Dr. Hanley wanted to start way back. \u201cThere isn\u2019t enough time for that,\u201d Jess blurted out during their third session. That she\u2019d used his full name bothered him\u2014not Mal, but Malcolm. Before last night Patrick had been suggesting Malcolm go to her, as if that didn\u2019t occur to him every single day. But when he pictured it\u2014pulling up to Cobie\u2019s building, waiting on the stoop like a delivery boy while Jess decided whether to come out or not: screw that. And what would he say? She left him. If anyone should be doing the seeking, it should be her. As he lay in bed, still looking at her LinkedIn photo, it dawned on him that the fact that no one had asked for her lately meant they probably all knew. No one asking for her was the best evidence that what Patrick and Siobh\u00e1n had told him was true. As soon as he got out of bed, he noticed the house was brutally cold, and when he went to the window, he saw two huge tree limbs on the ground below, just lying there in the snow, joint to joint, like a pair of lovers who\u2019d spent themselves and then fallen asleep. There were two matching blemishes left behind on the tree. He pulled the comforter off their bed, wrapped it around his bare shoulders, and walked down the hall to one of the front windows. The Bennetts\u2019 mailbox was gone. Gerry Kowalski\u2019s little two-door hatchback was just a lump. The Colemans\u2019 collie was outside, and all Malcolm could see of him was his head hopping above the surface of the snow now and again while Jon Coleman stood in his open garage door blowing into his cupped fists. There was not even a tire mark in the road, no sign that the town plow had passed. Everyone\u2019s winter-bald gardens were buried under a blanket so clean and new that even Mike Dunleavy\u2019s trash-heap yard looked as tidy as a postcard. The sky was blue, cloudless. The tops of the row of evergreens across the street leaned in the wind. The temperature was expected to drop into the teens by nightfall and stay there for several days. He wanted to call her right then and tell her it was time to come home. She was embarrassing herself, he would say, everyone knew what she\u2019d done, but there was still a chance to work it out. There\u2019d been a blizzard and enough was enough. He tried once again to picture Neil Bratton. Jess was sleeping with him? Malcolm made himself picture it. He felt absurdly na\u00efve, but was it possible they were just good friends, had a bunch in common, and people had drawn their own conclusions? He listed their shared interests on his fingers. They were both lawyers. That was one. He moved to his second finger but he couldn\u2019t think of anything else. He tried to decide whether it mattered. Malcolm had slept with what was probably considered a lot of people. God knew they didn\u2019t all mean something to him. And if he slept with someone new today, or ever, that person would never mean what Jess meant to him. It wouldn\u2019t mean that person really knew him, or would have any sort of say in his life. Jess was usually the one who told him how to think about things, how to see them, and he was trying to understand what she\u2019d done the way she would if she weren\u2019t Jess, and he wasn\u2019t Malcolm, and Neil Bratton was a stand-in for anyone, and the people they were thinking about weren\u2019t them. Maybe for Jess it was just mechanical, a joining of bodies without really knowing each other. If so, he could possibly get over that. But she would have confessed more easily, if this thing with Neil Bratton meant nothing. She was not a liar, so the seriousness of whatever was between her and this guy, this stranger, was the only thing that explained her silence. In a lineup of kneecaps or elbows, he could pick out Jess\u2019s from a group of a thousand. From fifty yards away he could tell her exact thought by the set of her shoulders. Or not, it occurred to him. Or not. A memory skittered through him, how he\u2019d been brushing his teeth with the bathroom door open one morning and in the mirror he\u2019d seen Jess lift his work shirt out of the hamper and press it to her face. He was about to ask what she was doing, when it hit him. He tried to never mention Emma at home, but maybe it was the omission of her name that pointed Jess to his interest. But interest wasn\u2019t a crime. Nor was the way his belly tightened when he passed close to her in the narrow space behind the bar. When Emma asked him a question, she didn\u2019t immediately doubt his answer, and that felt good. When she reported a problem, she looked at him with an expression of total faith that he would figure it out. One time, once, he stood so close to her as they were looking at an invoice that he could feel the light down on her arm brushing against him. She held perfectly still and so did he. Then Roddy came in and Malcolm shifted away. In the days since Cobie told him Jess was in Gillam, he\u2019d been tempted to drive by her mother\u2019s house, but he held strong. Every time he passed her block and didn\u2019t turn, he felt like he should be applauded for his self-restraint. How stupid he felt now. What a joke. He\u2019d have been out on the street imagining every lighted room had her in it, when she wasn\u2019t even there. The night his friends came by specifically to tell him that she was not, in fact, at her mother\u2019s house, was the night he chose to drive over there and see for himself. The roads were getting worse by the minute, but he put the windshield wipers on the highest setting, leaned over the wheel to glimpse between the strokes, and turned onto her old street. Normally, he loved the drive home from the bar late at night, the feeling of being up and out when everyone else was asleep. It was like time outside of time, whenever he cruised around after closing, looking at the quiet of everything. But on that night, the utter stillness felt like a warning. He reached the crest in the road where he could glimpse her childhood home, where the first time he slept over\u2014just a few hours after going down on her in her twin bed, an INXS poster taped to the wall\u2014he tried to leave through the kitchen with only a brief hello, but Mr. Ryan stopped him, told him to sit. He had meant to go home before Jess\u2019s parents woke up, but he must have fallen asleep because next thing the room was full of light and Jess\u2019s bedside clock read eight thirty. Eight thirty meant he\u2019d slept over. He was a guest of the whole house. As they talked, Mr. Ryan folded a crust of bread and pushed it into a soft-boiled egg. A yellow drip landed on his beard, and Malcolm tried not to gag. He sipped the orange juice Mrs. Ryan made out of a frozen cylinder of concentrate, and wondered if the conversation was just a ruse, whether Mr. and Mrs. Ryan were just acting nonchalant until Jess emerged, and then they\u2019d both get scolded. He was far too old for that, but he knew from his own house that girls were never too old to get scolded, and it would be wrong to leave now and have Jess take it alone. And then Jess walked into the kitchen, freshly showered, in sweats and a T-shirt, her skin rosy, her green eyes bright despite only four hours of sleep. He could see that she was surprised he was still there, nervous about what her father might be saying. \u201cHe didn\u2019t sleep in Mickey\u2019s bed,\u201d Mrs. Ryan said to her daughter, as if Malcolm couldn\u2019t hear them. Jess\u2019s father was pretty sick by then, though no one knew it. Malcolm remembered him running his fingertips across his chest that morning, back and forth, sort of absentmindedly, as if feeling for something. When Malcolm recollected that for Jess several years later, she said he made it up. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d Mr. Ryan asked Malcolm point-blank. Far too old to be sitting here, Malcolm thought. A four-and-a-half-year difference seemed greater in those years. At twenty-four, Jess still had one foot in childhood, despite two years of law school under her belt. Despite an apartment in the city. Jess\u2019s high school bedroom was downstairs and her parents\u2019 was on the second floor, but the house was not big. She\u2019d refused to go to his apartment because she thought his roommate was weird, and they\u2019d have to take a taxi from the bar because Malcolm\u2019s car was in the shop. Her house was walkable, she said, though it turned out to be a longer walk than he expected. \u201cYou said it was right up the road!\u201d he complained, but she just laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re sure your parents won\u2019t wake up?\u201d he asked when she opened the back door and paused to listen for a moment. The house was dark and silent. \u201cThey didn\u2019t wake up last night,\u201d she said. \u201cWait,\u201d he said, drawing up. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes. \u201cHe slept on the couch,\u201d Jess told her mother, by the sink. He\u2019d glimpsed an old sofa in the little nook off the hallway and figured that was the couch she meant. He got nervous for a moment, as if he might be asked to prove it\u2014what blanket did he use? what pillow?\u2014but Jess\u2019s mother nodded and accepted that explanation so readily that he understood she didn\u2019t care whether it was true or not. That was fifteen years ago, he realized as he rolled to a stop in front of the house. Her car wasn\u2019t there. He stared at the blank space in her mother\u2019s driveway as if waiting for something to appear, some bit of evidence that would prove Patrick and Siobh\u00e1n wrong, some sign that she was in there with her mother, thinking about how to come home to him. When he parked in his own driveway just three minutes later, the whole block, the whole town, felt lonelier than it ever did in daylight. He got out but when he turned toward the door, he found he couldn\u2019t go in, not yet. It was one thing to get home in the wee hours of the morning, collapse into bed, wake up, and rush out the door for another day. But it wasn\u2019t even midnight, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to fall asleep. He sat on his front step, the small awning over the door protecting him from the snow, and drew out the cigarette he\u2019d bummed from Scotty an hour earlier, with this exact scene in mind. The temperature wasn\u2019t that cold. There was no wind, though the news said that was coming. The snow made a whisper-soft crystalline sound as it fell. He hadn\u2019t smoked in years, but right then, his empty house waiting behind him, he wondered if it were possible to change, to end up in a life completely different from the one he thought he was in. He should have followed her that day. He should have stopped her from getting in her car and talked everything out with her, like Dr. Hanley said was important. But he\u2019d just let her go. Because he was shocked. Why else? Because his feelings were hurt. Why else? Because he didn\u2019t know what to say. He didn\u2019t know how much he depended on her habits to set the pattern for his days until they were gone. He never knew what he was supposed to do with himself when he was alone, and wondered what people did who lived by themselves their whole adult lives. He\u2019d not eaten a single meal inside his house since Jess left. Days off he texted his friends to see what they were up to, see if he could get himself invited over to their houses or else peel them away from their families for a few hours. If that didn\u2019t work, he knew at least one bartender in most of the local places, and could go from one to the next, never a shortage of available spots. He could eat a sandwich at the bar; he didn\u2019t even need to talk to anyone. The sound of people talking all around him was enough company, far better than ESPN droning on in his empty living room. On Halloween, the day that Jess left, he went to work as always. People filed into the Half Moon dressed as rock stars, as ghosts, as characters from TV shows everyone recognized, and there were moments when what had happened earlier that day was too surreal to be true. She\u2019d taken the day off to organize the closets, she said. And she really had organized. He went to the gym around noon, and when he came home, he threw his keys on the hall table and noticed her duffel bag by the door. But he was distracted. It had been a tough week at the bar. His food supplier had to float him for the second time in a month. He\u2019d already switched to a bar-food-only menu, no fresh vegetables, only stuff that could live in their walk-in until the apocalypse. The next step was scrapping food entirely and simply giving out bags of chips. More worrisome: he\u2019d missed a payment with the Guinness guy\u2014missed three payments, actually\u2014but the last time was the delivery guy\u2019s fault. He didn\u2019t grab the check even though Malcolm left it out for him. They reported him to the state liquor authority, the alert went out, and since then he had to pay cash on delivery with all the booze suppliers. He owed the guy who came around in his beat-up van to clean the draft lines. He owed the soda guy. He owed the trash removal guys. He was owed his cut from the ATM and the jukebox, but the guys who ran them were so young he felt cheap going after them for it. And then they ran out of vodka, a stupid miscalculation on his part, so he sent Roddy up to the liquor store to buy whatever vodka they had, full price. Instead of grabbing a variety, Roddy returned with six bottles of Absolut, and of course the next person who ordered asked for Ketel One and soda and the one after that asked for Stoli and anyone under forty-five wants Tito\u2019s and everyone acts as if everyone else\u2019s favorite vodka is garbage even though no human can actually tell one vodka from another. Did a feeling of dread come over him when he noticed her duffel in the hall? He could hear her moving around up in their bedroom. He flipped through the mail and then threw it on the table next to his keys. As soon as he climbed the stairs and walked into their room, he saw that she was packing her old roller suitcase, too. \u201cMalcolm,\u201d she said, as if she was surprised to see him. \u201cAre you going somewhere?\u201d he asked. But then it hit him, what was happening, and he did the thing she hated whenever he was reeling on the inside. He made his body a suit of stone. He crossed his arms and pulled on his tight shoulder as if he\u2019d not asked a question, as if he weren\u2019t waiting for an answer. She took a deep breath, and he felt the hairs at the back of his neck rise. \u201cJust for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cTo think. Mal, there\u2019s so much that we need to\u2014\u201d \u201cTo think,\u201d he repeated, and she nodded, looking up at him like she was making herself brave, like she was ready to answer anything he might ask her. He could see her pulse flickering in her slender throat, her long dark hair swept up as it always was when she was around the house. But he was too surprised to ask another question. \u201cI can\u2019t deal with this,\u201d he said. \u201cNot this week. Do you even know what\u2019s going on at the bar? I can\u2019t.\u201d He gestured at her little piles of clothes and shook his head as if to say this\u2014leaving\u2014was what they promised each other they\u2019d never do. They\u2019d never even joke about it. They were family, thick or thin. And yet. She turned back to the suitcase. The headache she\u2019d been nursing for days coalesced into a fine point behind her brow. If he\u2019d been paying attention, he would have figured it out the day before. She\u2019d cleaned out the drawers of the bathroom vanity. She got a giant black trash bag and threw out every half-empty hair product and lotion. She was about to throw out all the unopened pregnancy tests but something stopped her. Instead, she opened one, peed on it, examined her face in the bathroom mirror while she waited for the line to appear. It had been two years since her last pregnancy test. She tried to remember what she used to think about as she waited, whether sometimes she thought of errands she had to run and what she might eat for dinner, or whether she always, every time, imagined what it would feel like to push out a baby and hear her shocked wails, have her placed on her chest for the familiar smell of her body, the only home she\u2019d ever known. This is air, she\u2019d whisper to her baby. That\u2019s light. Those are people, like you. She opened another test and did it again, though there was barely enough left in her bladder to saturate the stick. She imagined what she\u2019d do if two lines appeared. She\u2019d read the stories, women conceiving when it made the least sense. A hundred thousand dollars spent on fertility but lo and behold one weekend in Puerto Rico when she was not even ovulating did the trick. If that stick displayed a second line, whose baby would it be? Cold shock rolled through her and she clutched the edge of the counter. She needed to tell him about Neil. She needed to tell him before he heard it from someone else. \u201cMalcolm,\u201d she said and stood up. \u201cI know it\u2019s not a good time, but I need to clear my head. I just don\u2019t think the way we are right now can go on any longer. Before I go, I need to tell you something that I should have\u2014\u201d \u201cThose are mine,\u201d he interrupted, looking at the set of earbuds in her hand. The rest of her sentence was cut off as if he\u2019d clapped a hand over her mouth. \u201cThese?\u201d she asked, holding up the earbuds. \u201cThey\u2019re mine,\u201d he repeated. He wasn\u2019t going to ask where she was going or why, but she could see in his stance that, by God, those earbuds would be the hill he chose to die on. \u201cI think they\u2019re mine,\u201d she said. \u201cSee?\u201d She showed him the dot of nail polish she\u2019d used to mark them, to differentiate them from his. Packing he could take. The fact that she was leaving he could take. But that little dot of nail polish sent him over. He pounded down the stairs, and when he slammed the door the whole house shook. Ten minutes later he was back, rooting around for something or maybe working himself up to a question. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know where I\u2019m going?\u201d she asked when he didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cNope,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to Cobie\u2019s,\u201d she said, her voice catching. \u201cGo to the fucking moon if you want,\u201d he said, and left the room again. He went downstairs and she imagined him pacing, cracking his knuckles, trying to decide what to do or say. She thought she\u2019d hear the sound of his car starting, him driving away, but he stayed. He\u2019s hurt, she told herself. He\u2019s angry and feels stupid. Just as she would feel if the tables were turned. Just as anyone would. They\u2019d talk, surely, after a cooling-off period. They\u2019d talk after they got used to having a little space from each other. Then she\u2019d tell him everything. As she finished packing, little kids started ringing the doorbell, crying out, \u201cTrick or treat.\u201d She listened to Malcolm make a big deal about costumes, imagined him waving to the parents standing at the curb. Amazing, the way he found a different thing to say to each kid. She alone knew how hard he must be working to sound friendly and normal. But why? Was it a positive attribute, or was it pathological, that desperation to shield the world from his personal business? Listening to him, no one would guess what was going on in his life, his house, at that very moment. Jess carried her suitcase down the long flight of stairs, and seeing the effort it took felt like a jolt through Malcolm\u2019s bones, that feeling like missing the last step. He watched her heave it into the trunk of her car, somehow, he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be able to do it, and then he just stood there while she went back for the duffel, also packed tight. The craziest thing, the thing he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about after she was gone, was that as he was driving home from the gym, he thought she might come over to the bar with him, help him judge the costumes and award prizes, throw a few darts if she was having fun. It had been such a long time since she went there just to hang out, and she loved Halloween. They\u2019d been moving around each other without seeing one another lately, but that week she\u2019d touched his arm as she passed behind him at the sink. She\u2019d reached for him in her sleep and fitted her body around his. He thought things were getting better, but actually, all that time, she was saying goodbye. What did he do in his house for two hours, alone, before he left for the bar? Aside from answer the door over and over and over again. It was lost time. The last thing she said to him was a warning not to leave the candy bowl outside because one bratty kid would just dump the whole thing in his bag. And then they looked at each other across a distance of maybe ten feet\u2014she on the front lawn, he at the door, and he thought, Jesus Christ, she\u2019s micromanaging the candy bowl even now. He almost never drank at work but once he got to the bar that Halloween night, he did two shots, quickly, before the party started, and then three more, spaced about thirty minutes apart so he was never drunk, exactly, just better able to contain thoughts of Jess in a corner of his mind. He gave out the prizes for best costumes, singles and groups. He thought he was being normal, being fun even, but then Emma\u2019s mouth was by his ear, asking if he wanted to take a break. \u201cI had a rough afternoon,\u201d he said, standing close to her as he took in the delicate frame her collarbones made for her shoulders, the way her shirt skimmed her body. He was about to tell her what happened, that he and Jess had separated, he guessed, if that was the right word, but they got interrupted by a group of women a little older than Malcolm who\u2019d come dressed as a nineties girl band and wanted a photo with him. So he smiled, and they leaned against him and cocked their hips, and then they huddled over phones and after a moment asked for another photo, just one more, a slightly different angle. He wondered how old their children were, if they had children. He wondered if they were divorced. He could tell which ones among them had once been hot, and which had blossomed later, after marriage, after motherhood, perhaps, a rare trajectory. He considered telling them that they had a few good years in them still, despite their age, and that\u2019s when he suspected he might be more drunk than he thought he was. Emma guided him to a stool, told him he could be the master of ceremonies from a seated position. And then she brought him a pint of water and a plate of fries. He half expected to arrive home hours later and find Jess there, waiting for him. \u201cSorry about before,\u201d she might say, her voice hoarse with sleep. \u201cCan we talk about it tomorrow?\u201d But inside, the house was as empty as it had been when he left, a dirty coffee mug in the sink. He thought, at first, that he might never have to tell her about his side deal with Hugh. One day, when business was booming and they were organizing their assets, he\u2019d present her with a nice surprise. But she wouldn\u2019t leave it alone. Hugh sent a fruit basket to the house along with a card that referenced the smart decision Malcolm had made, the good bones the place had. Jess kept leaning across the counter to take another look at the message, asking Malcolm what it meant. \u201cHe just means best of luck, I guess,\u201d Malcolm said, shrugging. But there was something in the construction of the message. She kept rereading it like she was dowsing for water, going around with her rod, poking surfaces. At first, he could see, she honestly didn\u2019t know. But then, two days after closing, while Malcolm was sleeping and she was getting ready for work, it dawned on her. \u201cDid you buy the building? Did we? The contract I saw only included the business.\u201d She never woke him before she left for work, but that morning she shook him until he opened his eyes. She asked him to please sit up. So he told her, and she went pale, stared at him for a long time. She asked if he\u2019d hired a lawyer, and when he said he had not, she went even more pale. He thought for a moment that she\u2019d hold back, that she\u2019d see that it wasn\u2019t all that different from what they agreed to except they\u2019d have to shoot some money over to Hugh, too. And for that they owned a building! A building with enormous potential! But after a moment of silence where it turned out she was only gathering her strength, she asked everything at once: the terms, the payout structure, what happens if he defaults. She asked to see what he signed. \u201cI didn\u2019t sign anything. We did it on a handshake.\u201d She pressed her palm to her forehead and stood there for a moment, staring at him. He\u2019d never known her to be at a loss for words before. \u201cYou left me out of things, too,\u201d he said, before she could start. \u201cWhat did I leave you out of? I never hid anything from you!\u201d \u201cGive me a break,\u201d he said. \u201cYou knew I didn\u2019t want to take everything so far. You knew I didn\u2019t, but you kept making appointments. Last time you had your baselines taken before I even knew we were doing it again. That was sneaky.\u201d \u201cSneaky! The window was so small, and getting smaller every single day. You want to think about everything for a month, but there was absolutely no time for that. I\u2019m not a mind reader, Malcolm. I thought we wanted the same thing. If you were that against it, you could have made yourself heard.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t against it. I just\u2014it was like a vacuum that sucked up everything.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re obsessed with how much it cost. To have a child. Ask anyone what they think their child is worth, and they\u2019ll tell you she\u2019s invaluable.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure they would! But we don\u2019t have a child, Jess. So this isn\u2019t the same. And anyway, what I meant was that it was sucking all the joy from our lives. It was all we ever thought about. But sure, money, too. You act like that\u2019s superficial or something but people like us\u2014people like you and me\u2014we can\u2019t afford multiple big dreams. We can only afford one. And I just wonder why it had to be that one. When it was very clear to everyone except you that it wouldn\u2019t work out.\u201d \u201cThen why did you go along for so long? If you were so sure it wouldn\u2019t work?\u201d \u201cBecause,\u201d he said, and looked at her like the answer was so obvious he\u2019d never bothered putting it into words. \u201cBecause?\u201d \u201cBecause it\u2019s what you wanted.\u201d The possibility that Jess loved this guy shifted something, and for the first time in seventeen weeks, for the first time since putting his head down and deciding he\u2019d just keep going until she came around, he looked up and noticed that he\u2019d long since wandered off the path he was on, that he didn\u2019t have any idea where he was. To distract himself he did his ritual calculations, his morning routine, like daily affirmations but with the opposite effect: What was left in the freezer? What was left in the storeroom? He was still standing at the window with the comforter around his shoulders, but in his mind he could see everything. The drop bag had some heft to it for the first time in ages, and of course it was the one day he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to get to the bank. First, he had to retrieve it from the safe at the bar. It had been a few years since he\u2019d skied, but his gear was still in the attic, unless Jess had tossed it in a purge. Would the bank even be open? Gas, electric, and cable for the bar were all scheduled to go through on Monday. Those same bills were due on the house the following week. The minimum payments were due on two credit cards. Jess\u2019s student loan would auto-deduct from their joint checking. He was behind with Hugh once again. The first time he fell behind, Hugh\u2019s guys had come by the bar, asked for Malcolm. Roddy fetched him from the back, but when Malcolm emerged, they nodded a greeting, nothing more, as if they just wanted to lay eyes on him and make sure he knew they were there. They sat at the bar, had a drink each without speaking to anyone, and then left without paying. It was fine, he figured, all good, at that point it had been not quite a year since he bought the place, and Hugh was like an uncle to him, and like an uncle he was probably just reminding him of what they\u2019d agreed upon. Malcolm decided to move money around and get square with Hugh, carry a balance elsewhere. He did inventory of their shed one morning and itemized everything worth anything. He had expensive saws, a nice road bike he hadn\u2019t used in years, a retro ceramic barbeque, a collection of power tools. He had a stack of expensive bluestone pieces under a tarp, leftovers from when he put in the walkway around front. Two hundred square feet of mahogany flooring, a kayak. He had two fifty-pound coils of bright copper wire that they found in the basement after they bought the house. He sold it all and arranged pickups while Jess was at work. But even as he was clearing things out, accepting cash, he knew he\u2019d have the same problem the following month, and the one after that. He couldn\u2019t ask his mother for help. He imagined her trying to comprehend the amount of money he owed. She didn\u2019t know anything about his deal with Hugh. All she knew was that he bought the place and she was thrilled for him. And then to that amount he added Jess\u2019s student loan debt, which never seemed to get any lower, and what they owed the third fertility clinic they\u2019d used. Their sessions with Dr. Hanley added up to a small fortune every month, and Jess\u2019s insurance covered only a quarter of what he charged. \u201cBut that\u2019s a necessity,\u201d Jess said, when they were trying to figure out what to cut, and Malcolm knew better than to ask if she was sure Dr. Hanley hadn\u2019t made things worse. The world was different now, he\u2019d tell his mother. But she wouldn\u2019t buy it. His sister had given her a set of expensive face creams years ago, and those creams had been in a position of pride in her salmon-tiled bathroom ever since, never used. One day, when she died and he was in charge of clearing the place out, he\u2019d probably throw them in a dumpster along with everything else she cherished. She worked in the kitchen at the local elementary school, and every Friday she brought home some of the food that was going to be discarded. She always had an assortment of little cling-wrapped bagels on her counter, boxed strawberry milks, and yogurt squeezes in her fridge. He imagined telling her the situation he was in while she arranged for him a mismatched sandwich: peanut butter and jelly on white bread to the left and bologna on a roll on the right. Do your best, she\u2019d say. But he was already doing his best. He was at the bar in person sixty hours a week. He booked live music. A DJ. Live music followed by a DJ. Eighties nights. Dance instruction. Ladies\u2019 nights. Paint and sip. Speed dating events. Trivia night. Guest bartenders. On and on and on. He took out ads in the local paper. He bought a sign that was hung on the fence of the Little League field, along with several other local businesses. He was cheerful. Welcoming. He never let on that things were tough because who wanted to hear that? No one. Not when they were out to forget troubles of their own. \u201cHow\u2019s it going at the Half Moon?\u201d his mother asked him from time to time. \u201cGetting a good crowd?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s spotty,\u201d he admitted about a year in. \u201cThe new place that opened on Oak didn\u2019t help. They pull the same crowd.\u201d Which was really surprising, he didn\u2019t add. The place on Oak was a brewery, gleaming stainless steel drums of their own lagers and witbiers. He predicted the guys in their thirties would go for that, but he didn\u2019t expect the other age groups to like it over there, too. It didn\u2019t make sense that the old-timers who were annoyed at him for updating a few things at the Half Moon were over there studying hops and unmalted wheat. It didn\u2019t make sense that the near-broke twenty-two-years-olds were forking over ten dollars for a pint. \u201cYeah? But you\u2019re okay?\u201d \u201cOh fine. Yeah. I\u2019m doing fine. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d Malcolm was eighteen when his father died, nearly an adult. Everyone seemed to have liked Darren, but Malcolm\u2019s clearest memory was of him getting pissed once when there was no milk in the house. He slammed the fridge so hard that the half-empty bottles of condiments stored on the door rattled. Malcolm also remembered his dad making fun of him for getting March and April mixed up on a test he took in\u2014what? Second grade? Charm was a performance for other people, Malcolm had learned. He came alive as soon as he stepped inside his bar every night. Malcolm fell behind with Hugh again, just a few months after the first time. He still didn\u2019t quite understand how; the money was there and then it just wasn\u2019t. The laws of simple addition and subtraction didn\u2019t seem to apply to the Half Moon\u2019s checking account. He\u2019d look at the balance, jot down the amount, run a few quick calculations. But then he\u2019d look again and there\u2019d be only a third of what had been there the day before. Hugh\u2019s guys came to his house. One of them knocked, though the doorbell was right there. His clothes and the stench of tobacco seemed totally out of place against Jess\u2019s hydrangea, the bold turquoise of their welcome mat. Jess came downstairs when she heard a voice she didn\u2019t recognize, took one look, and knew everything. She was quieter than normal, listening. The tall one\u2014Billy was his name\u2014smiled like it was a regular social visit, while the other one hung back. \u201cListen,\u201d Billy said. \u201cMalcolm.\u201d He tried to steer Malcolm outside to talk privately, but Malcolm shook him off. His house. Jess looking on. Their laundry tumbling in the dryer. He was livid. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Billy asked. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Malcolm said. Billy laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m working it out with Hugh.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re working it out with Hugh? I talked to him this morning.\u201d \u201cGreat.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d What would they do? Malcolm wondered. What would they really do? \u201cWhy did you ever agree to his terms?\u201d Jess asked at least one hundred times. She believed Hugh had tricked him. That Hugh had marked him and circled him and went in for the kill. That he\u2019d never liked Malcolm nearly as much as Malcolm believed he did. She had no evidence to point to, it was just her gut that told her. But why would he have tricked Malcolm when he could have easily gotten someone else to buy the place? And Jess always asked whether he was sure about that. It was true that no one knew the Half Moon like Malcolm did, but someone else would have done research about the rest of the market, what was changing, new places opening up. Someone else would have hired a lawyer, made sure there wasn\u2019t something big they were missing. Someone else might have gotten in touch with the various vendors to make sure that the contracts in place would carry over, and they would have found out that even if Hugh had stayed on, his contracts would have expired because one company buys another, which buys another, and next thing your supplier is not a buddy from the Bronx whom you\u2019ve known for forty years but a global conglomerate with satellite offices in your area. Surely, Malcolm insisted, Hugh had no idea about the new place opening on Oak, how successful it would be, how the local paper would say it was exactly what Gillam needed. Once Billy left, Malcolm called Hugh directly. He figured it would be best to face the music head-on, cut out all those middle guys. Maybe they could work out a plan, a different schedule. How many hours had they spent together at the bar, Hugh giving advice, Malcolm taking it. But the phone rang and rang. He tried Hugh\u2019s cell. He tried his house in Gillam, in case he was in New York for some reason. He sucked up his pride and called Little Hughie, left a voicemail to say he was looking for Big Hugh. Now, in the place where Billy had pulled his car up to the curb that day several months earlier, the snow looked to be waist high. He\u2019d pulled a rabbit out of a hat after that visit, but he was behind again, and it had taken far less time to get there. He should be doing something. He should be solving this puzzle, but instead he was stuck in his house. Where was the plow? Already the silence was suffocating. He looked at his phone: no texts. And come to think of it, the house was quieter than quiet: no hum from the heating vents, no ambient vibrations. He walked downstairs. The face of the cable box was blank. The clock on the microwave dead. He flicked the hall switch up and down and up and down as if he might get better news if he just tried one more time. The couch looked different in the silence. The chairs, too. He wondered if power was out all over town. His phone was at nineteen percent. He tried to remember how much gas he had in his car. He thought of the pipes snaking through the walls of the Half Moon, of the portable generator he\u2019d bought last winter but which was completely useless to him if he couldn\u2019t get there to set it up. He dressed in layers. An absurd amount of clothing. He didn\u2019t bother with a hat but as soon as he stepped outside, the rims of his ears stung like they\u2019d been pinched. He tromped across the yard to the shed and when he opened the door, he remembered that he left his snow shovel at the bar. He looked around for the garden spade. He found a rake. Tarps. Canisters of gasoline. His face was freezing. The Kowalski kid might shovel for twenty bucks. Mrs. Kowalski kind of liked him, Malcolm knew. She was cordial on their street when they met as neighbors, but when she came to the Half Moon, she always put her hand on his arm when she said hello. He swept enough snow off his car to be able to open the door, and then he turned on the engine and blasted the heat. The gas tank was half-full. He put his phone on the charger. He could walk to the bar, maybe. Would be good to get his heart pumping. Or he could walk to Siobh\u00e1n and Patrick\u2019s house. It was just two blocks over. But what would they be doing, trapped inside with their three kids, everyone in pajamas, giving him concerned looks? Siobh\u00e1n reminding him that Jess was still Jess, no matter what. He imagined cereal floating in milky bowls, trying to talk to them but a kid always interrupting. The car was so nice and warm. He stayed there with his eyes closed until his phone reached fifty percent. Back inside half an hour later, he sat on a kitchen stool and made columns. What he owed, what he had, what he needed. He heard a groaning sound from above and paused for a moment to listen. Ice in the gutters, maybe. Ice in the pipes. What could he do? He opened the cabinet doors under the sink. He went down to the basement and turned off the water main. When he got back upstairs, he turned on the water in the sink to drain the pipes. He filled every pot with water and set them on the stove. He went upstairs and filled the bathtub. Then he returned to his spot at the counter and made a list of dream projects, calculated what those projects would bring in. He did twenty push-ups. He backed up to a kitchen chair and did two sets of dips. He checked the junk drawer for matches to ignite the pilot on the stove, but there were no matches, only a half-empty box of trick birthday candles way in the back with the crumbs. He walked over to the bookcase and skimmed the titles for something he\u2019d never read, something Jess had left behind, but the silence was too distracting. He opened a box of granola bars and ate four in a row. He pounded a glass of water. He lay on his back in the living room for a while, deciding whether to text Emma. He could phrase it in a way that implied he was checking on the whole staff, not just her. He decided against it. He noticed dust under the TV cabinet and stood to get the vacuum before he remembered it wouldn\u2019t work. Sighing, annoyed with himself, he stepped into his boots once again and carved a path to the Colemans\u2019, to borrow a shovel. He spent an hour shoveling, sweat soaking the layers under his coat. When he was finished he made a bet with himself about whether the power was back on. He looked up at the heavy black lines strung overhead and decided, yes, he could sense current running there. To buy extra time he walked the shovel back to the Colemans\u2019 even though Jon said there was no rush. He hung around Jon\u2019s garage for a minute\u2014clearing his throat, stomping the snow off his boots\u2014in case Jon got the idea to invite him in for a drink. When he gave up and returned to his own door, he opened it slowly and felt genuinely surprised to be wrong, the lights still dead, the silence more silent than it ever was when there was electricity flowing through the wires. Okay, he said to himself. Something had to be done. He couldn\u2019t very well pace inside his house until the power returned. He went upstairs and pried open the door to the attic crawl space. He used the light from his phone to look for his skis, and as soon as the space lit up, he wanted to drag Jess back from wherever she was hiding to look at how cluttered it was up there, how she\u2019d just been shoving stuff in willy-nilly and now he couldn\u2019t find what he needed in an emergency. He wanted to call her to let her know that he didn\u2019t care whom she slept with, but what had she been thinking tossing their old camp chairs on top of chafing dishes on top of Christmas decorations. How dare she ever scold him for where he threw his keys. He started picking things up at random, throwing them to the side. The sound of things crashing felt good, so he threw harder. Boxes of papers, bags of shoes, appliances he couldn\u2019t even identify. There was baby stuff from her girlfriends that she\u2019d kept, oh my God, she\u2019d kept. Slowly, he drew from the gaping mouth of a shopping bag a knit blanket and then another, and then another, how many blankets could one baby possibly need. Another bag held tiny one-piece rompers with snaps that ran from toe to neck. A half dozen. More. The bag had no bottom. He went down on his knees among these soft things and looked through all of them for a second time. He pushed his face against a green towel that had a frog\u2019s head as a hood, and for a moment he saw a child wearing it, damp from the bath, hair dark like Jess\u2019s, like his, pale eyes and long lashes. All the adrenaline he\u2019d felt a moment before leaked out of him, and he dropped to both knees. He counted to ten. He saw there were two small swings, plus a thing with a sitting basket and spinny toys attached to the rim. She\u2019d pictured a child playing in these contraptions, he knew. He put that on one side of a scale and on the other side he put Neil Bratton, but he didn\u2019t want to think about it long enough to see which side weighed more. No skis. He closed the crawl space door and returned to his spot at the upstairs window. No one was out, not even little kids making snowmen. He texted a few friends. He typed in names like tossing a ring over a table of bottles, hoping one would land around a neck. But one by one they got back to say they couldn\u2019t get out, their street hadn\u2019t been plowed, it was so cold, nowhere was open anyway. He watched TV on his phone and tried not to think about the fortune it would cost in data. When the show ended he went over to the liquor cabinet because he had a flashback of his brother-in-law giving him a bottle of Macallan two Christmases ago. Then he remembered taking it to the bar. He did inventory of what was left, little half measures. No gin. Some rum. There was a bottle of sweet vermouth at the back of the fridge. He returned to the couch and stared into space. He got up again, went to the freezer, and found a near-empty bottle of vodka, what was left gone syrupy, so he passed the bottle between his hands for a minute. When the viscosity looked normal, he went back to the liquor cabinet and found an unopened jar of olives. He was too lazy to dig out a martini glass, or a shaker, so he mixed everything in a highball glass. He took it to the couch, and as soon as he sipped it, he wished he\u2019d done it right. He made himself drink exactly half and then he dumped it. He fell asleep on the couch with his coat on at 7:30 p.m. When he woke up around midnight, his shirt was still damp with the sweat he\u2019d worked up while shoveling. He climbed the stairs to his bedroom. And then, lying on his side of the bed in the complete dark\u2014no stars that night, no porch lights coming through the trees from neighboring houses, the streetlamps all dark\u2014he heard a voice calling his name over and over, so regularly, in fact, that it had become part of the background noise of his mind. He heard it only because of the darkness, the silence, because his mind was circling and circling, looking for a place to land. Once he tuned in, he saw Siobh\u00e1n, her face downcast at the bar, saying something about feeling bad. He saw the new guy, Neil, in her backyard, in the same golf shirt Malcolm always pictured, though that couldn\u2019t be right. Malcolm saw him leaning down to lift something. A child. Neil Bratton had three kids. And the youngest was only two. \u201cWait a second,\u201d he said aloud, and sat up. He checked his phone. No missed calls. No texts. \n four Just before Jess met Neil, before she found out the name of his street and typed it into the map on her phone, there was San Francisco. The route to Neil\u2019s house, when she eventually traced it with her finger, reminded her of a child\u2019s drawing of a staircase. Sitting in her silent bedroom, Malcolm at the bar, the novel she was trying to read winged over the arm of the chair, she thought how easy it would be to break off a little portion of herself and climb those crooked steps, see what might happen. It would only be a small detour from regular life. The thing between them, whatever it was, might be the kind of thing that vanished as soon as it was spoken aloud. But before Neil came San Francisco, which arrived at the worst possible time. The bar was newly theirs, two months since Malcolm signed a sheaf of papers without bothering to let her know the details, without really understanding them himself\u2014he was so goddamn cocky, everything he ever wanted in life he\u2019d always just smiled and gotten. If he were the one who wanted a baby as much as she did, then they would have one. She was sure of it. But what he wanted most in his life was to own a bar, to be able to say, I have a place of my own over in Gillam. And not just any bar. Other places had become available over the years, but there was always something wrong with them. The light, he said. The location. A feeling he got in his bones. Hugh had been dangling the promise of his eventual departure for years; all Malcolm had to do was wait. At some point after Hugh told him that the time had come and Malcolm was still pretending to be merely thinking about it, he started calling it a restaurant. \u201cWhat restaurant?\u201d Jess asked as she was filling the kettle. \u201cI thought we were talking about the Half Moon.\u201d Earlier that evening, when she was searching for dried oregano, she came across a half-empty bottle of FertilAid. It felt like running into an old friend with whom she had an unresolved disagreement. She went to throw it out but found she could not. Instead she fished out one pill, swallowed it, chugged a glass of water. And then she tucked the bottle way back in the cabinet where she found it. \u201cWe are,\u201d Malcolm said, and set his face in a way that told her he would not break, no matter what. Whether he was rebranding it for himself or for her, she couldn\u2019t tell. Beller\u2019s Steakhouse was a restaurant. The Half Moon was a bar that offered a glorified children\u2019s menu just so it could keep its liquor license. Calling it a restaurant should have been her first clue. Her second should have been that he wore a jacket and tie to the closing. She\u2019d just started a new position in the legal department of Bloom, a left-leaning media company that owned a suite of magazines and cable channels, totally opposite the conservative firm she\u2019d just left. There were meetings she couldn\u2019t miss, being so new, and as the mortgage loan officer from the bank pointed out, Malcolm could simply sign for her as proxy. She was just gathering her things for a lunch meeting when he sent a photo of himself standing in front of their bedroom mirror. Aren\u2019t you just meeting at the bar? she replied. Yeah, he wrote. Wanted to look nice. Big day! You look great, she wrote back and felt a sudden punch of guilt, considered coming down with a stomachache so she could hurry to Penn Station and make it to Gillam on time. He looked so happy. It was a big day for her, too, she supposed. Though everyone would describe the place as Malcolm\u2019s, it was equally hers. Jess preferred the work she\u2019d been doing at Laborers\u2019 International but switching to a private firm made more sense. The salary was better; she could keep up with her loan payments and save a little on top. In a few years she\u2019d likely make partner, as long as she paid her dues, and like most firms they needed more women. At thirty-two, on their seven-year wedding anniversary, she threw her dial of pills in the trash and told Malcolm she was ready. He\u2019d been saying all along that he was ready whenever she was, all she had to do was say the word. Six months later she went to see a fertility doctor her gynecologist recommended, because of her age. By then she was thirty-three. \u201cMy age?\u201d Jess had said at the time, sitting on an exam table and thinking her legs needed to be moisturized. \u201cI know,\u201d her doctor said. \u201cFertility has not quite caught up with modern life.\u201d At the first clinic, on the second page of the packet of paperwork they sent, was the usual trio of questions she dreaded: How many children did she have? Zero. How many times had she been pregnant? One. Age at the time of first pregnancy: twenty-five. That she\u2019d miscarried was not worrisome, every doctor always said. The important thing was knowing she could get pregnant. Jess\u2019s insurance required four IUI cycles before each IVF. She was game the first time\u2014who knew? She was willing to give it a whirl. She was far from panicked. A lot of women she knew had taken a while to get pregnant. But after the four IUIs failed, just as the fertility doctor said they would, and after the first failed IVF, the lead doctor at the clinic wrote letters to Jess\u2019s insurance carrier to explain why intrauterine insemination would never work for Jess\u2019s particular problem, that they had to go straight to in vitro fertilization next time. She had diminished ovarian reserve, only a fraction of the number of eggs left in her ovaries that she should have at her age. And on top of that, the quality of her eggs was not good. Poor egg quality, her doctor told her, was closely associated with chromosomal abnormalities in embryos, which usually resulted in miscarriage. He recommended genetic testing before any future transfer of an embryo to her uterus. Dr. Mann\u2019s mustache was so long that sometimes he chomped on it when he spoke. It was hard to decide whether a person like that was totally trustworthy. Could he say why she\u2019d miscarried her first pregnancy? No, definitely not, to even guess would be pointless. On the wall behind his desk were photos of him holding various babies, all success stories. \u201cBut I got pregnant without even trying,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were twenty-five,\u201d he said. Jess took the news as if from a distance, like maybe they\u2019d gotten her labs mixed up with someone else\u2019s. She\u2019d been getting annual pelvic exams for a decade. She was a normal weight. She ran four or five miles a day. She bought organic tomatoes and ketchup because she read an article once. She was never sick. And then, slowly, it sank in. Her body might not be what she thought it was. The best the insurance company would do was reduce the required number of IUIs to three. The only other option was to pay out of pocket, but the expense was absurd, so she went through the three cycles of IUI again, this time more impatient to get to IVF. Once they got there everything looked precarious but more or less normal until the transfer, which was canceled because of the four decent eggs they\u2019d retrieved and fertilized, none turned into blastocysts. That was year one. Every morning for the six and a half years they spent trying, Jess woke up and her first thought was of her ovaries\u2014what they were up to in there. Time seemed bent in all the wrong directions. A week felt like a month, a month felt like a year. The meditation instructor at the acupuncturist\u2019s office\u2014an elderly woman who wore sexy deep-cut blouses and tight jeans\u2014said to always begin the day with positive affirmations, but Jess couldn\u2019t stop herself from scrolling through regrets. She should have started earlier. That was always number one. Right after they lost that first pregnancy they should have tried again. She should never have smoked, not even at weddings, not even on big nights out. She shouldn\u2019t have had so many Diet Cokes. She once wrote out a rough estimate of how many she\u2019d had in her life, starting around eighth grade, right up until the present day, and the number made her weak. She should never have so much as tasted that no-frills powdered iced tea her mother used to buy in drums so big that their cat could climb inside when it was empty. She should have been the kind of woman who nursed a club soda and didn\u2019t in fact spend so many nights of her late twenties doing flaming shots at the Half Moon while she waited her turn at darts. Or maybe it was just the opposite. Maybe she could have used more fun and less studying, less worrying over that incomprehensible law school loan, which became real to her only after the first entire year of payments didn\u2019t change the balance whatsoever. Why had she stayed up so late working on papers, keeping herself awake with gallons of coffee when she could have been sleeping, making her body a safe haven? She never should have gotten into a hot tub, especially in rental houses down the shore. After two years, they switched to a clinic that struck better deals for people paying out of pocket. She had to wait six weeks to even get an appointment, and then figuring it all out\u2014the financials first, and then getting new baselines with new tests\u2014took another two months. And did it work? It did not, despite all their talk of new protocols, success rates. They switched to a third clinic in year five. Seeing the picture of Malcolm in his jacket and tie, getting ready for the day he\u2019d been looking forward to since he started working at the Half Moon, it hit her that despite recent tension between them, she should have planned a party. He was forty-three and she was nearly thirty-nine. After so many years of disappointment, they could have used a celebration. She\u2019d pressed snooze twice that morning, had struggled to get up and into the shower. Had she even wished him luck? She regretted not pausing for a moment to tell him that she was proud of him. But after it went through and she discovered the details, the swell of love she felt while sitting at her desk that morning of the closing drained away and was replaced with a rage so all-encompassing that sometimes it was only as she was falling asleep and felt her body relax that she noticed how tightly clenched her muscles were from jaw to shoulders, down the long plane of her back. Jess found herself at Bloom because she needed to get away from her own failure to thrive. Every day at the law firm after not making partner left her feeling more deeply embarrassed than the day before, like everyone in the entire building was talking about her. She lost weight because instead of gobbling a sandwich at her desk each day she started walking over to the park to sit on a bench and study the people who passed by. Of all things she kept remembering a moment in law school, a mock debate in front of the class, how easily and deftly she\u2019d won, how her professor had given her a nod to acknowledge she\u2019d done well, how she and her classmates had gotten drinks after and how smart and strong and beautiful she felt that afternoon. But there was something crucial about her life that she didn\u2019t know then, and the present-day Jess wanted to reach back and shake her. If it were possible to send that girl a message, what exactly would she say? She started doing strange things. One day she bought an ice cream cone from a truck parked on Eighth Avenue, but it was too sweet and after a few licks she didn\u2019t want it. Instead of walking it to the garbage bin on the corner, she simply dropped her arm and let it go. No pedestrian stopped or glared. No passerby expressed condolences\u2014what was worse than dropping a fresh ice cream cone? The taxis and buses and trucks and cars and bicycles and mopeds all continued along the avenue at the exact same frenzied rate. Only the machine-sharp edges of the swirls sagged until they disappeared. Another afternoon she walked all the way to the High Line and noticed a group of young people lying on a sliver of grass, their pant legs and sleeves hiked up to soak in the sun. It was spring, the first sunny day after a week of gloom, and she decided that she would also like some sun, so she took off her blouse, unbuttoned it top to bottom as if she were sitting on the edge of her bed, and stretched out in a pencil skirt and a navy bra that she told herself looked like a bikini top. She set a thirty-two-minute timer on her phone, and when the timer went off, she was surprised that she\u2019d fallen asleep, her purse tucked under her head as a pillow, her stomach itchy for the rest of the day because the skin there hadn\u2019t gotten sunlight in probably ten years. One afternoon a woman pushing a stroller sat on the other end of the bench where Jess was sitting, scooped up the baby inside, and placed the child on her chest. The baby stretched out an arm, a tiny fist, and then settled. From four feet away, Jess could feel the baby\u2019s warm weight, the sweet smell of her scalp, and felt the breath go from her body as if she\u2019d jumped into a lake of icy water. The mother turned to her for a moment\u2014not so young, Jess could see\u2014and smiled. When they told her she was not making partner, she knew she was supposed to be a good sport. It\u2019s better, actually, they all implied. Less face time with difficult clients, plus partners had to buy in, and this way she could keep her salary and not bother with that. They wanted her to stay, they made that clear. Not all firms were so generous. But to be passed over at almost the exact same time she and Malcolm reached the end of their fertility effort\u2014for Malcolm to have reached his end, more accurately\u2014seemed too coincidental to be unrelated. The powers that be would never say it, of course, but Jess knew the main reason she hadn\u2019t made partner was because she\u2019d taken herself off cases that required travel. She didn\u2019t want to deal with explaining her bag of medications to a TSA agent, and she didn\u2019t want to worry that they\u2019d keep her cooler bag open for so long that the meds would be ruined. She didn\u2019t want to go hunting for a monitoring facility in Savannah or Austin or Denver to have her follicles checked. Who knew if those clinics were even good? How many hours had she spent lying on an examining table with her knees pulled to her chin while back at the office her admin kept her calls at bay? After, she\u2019d close her eyes at her desk, will her mind empty, and then picture some wheel deep inside her body turning at exactly the correct rate. Maybe someone had looked in and seen her, assumed she was asleep. She knew what they were thinking: she doesn\u2019t even have kids. When she brought the news of not having made partner to Malcolm, he pointed out that it was just a title, and it meant something that they wanted her to stay. He said working at the firm was still better than the years she\u2019d spent working for the union when she was fresh out of law school, but what he meant, Jess knew, was that the money was better, and though he never said it, she also knew that Malcolm believed all lawyers did more or less the same thing. \u201cAre you friendly at work?\u201d Malcolm asked when she was trying to figure it out. \u201cPeople like you?\u201d Jess felt her face get very hot. \u201cI\u2019m just asking,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s the main thing, right? No matter what kind of job you\u2019re in.\u201d \u201cAnd here I thought the main thing was competence.\u201d \u201cYou did?\u201d Malcolm said, her tone completely lost on him. He was distracted, searching for a missing scratch-off in the basket where they threw the mail. \u201cI really don\u2019t think so.\u201d In nearly seven years of trying, she had two chemical pregnancies, eight months apart, that disappeared around week four. Where did they go? Vanished. Like the ribbon of a balloon that slipped out of her hand. She had one ectopic pregnancy in their third year. She went for a long run while it was still inside her, and she couldn\u2019t stop herself from hoping that if she ran hard enough she might shake it loose, send it to a place where it could live. She had one miscarriage of a baby that was in the right place, a robust seven weeks along, floating in there exactly as it should have been, but then its heart simply slowed to a stop, like it had shown up at the wrong house, the wrong party, and then turned around and left. After that one, they had to wait four months before even getting baselines for a new cycle because she was still showing positive for HCG. The next cycle was canceled at retrieval. The one after at the transfer. Eighteen months after losing that pregnancy, she was pregnant again. She didn\u2019t celebrate until she reached week ten, even in her own mind. Mostly she felt dread, like she\u2019d better move through her days with great tenderness. She stopped exercising. She stopped carrying the laundry basket up the stairs and asked Malcolm to do it. She left flats of water in the trunk of her car until he got home. She bought milk by the quart instead of by the gallon so it was lighter to carry. At eleven weeks she felt more confident and told her mother and Siobh\u00e1n. The baby forums she was on, the private Facebook groups, the Reddit threads\u2014all reiterated what her mother told her when she was twenty-five, that twelve weeks was the moment she could feel sure that the \u201cbaby dust\u201d they were always wishing upon one another, strangers in dark rooms, typing their dearest hopes into a box, had actually worked. And then, eleven weeks and five days, a dull ache across her abdomen. Livid spots on the toilet paper when she wiped. \u201cNo,\u201d she decided, closing her eyes and pulling up her underwear like she\u2019d seen nothing, knew nothing. Malcolm was sound asleep\u2014his wallet, keys, phone, and a small pile of coins on the bed table next to him, as always. But then she stood at the kitchen counter a few minutes later and felt a wet heat bloom between her legs. \u201cMalcolm!\u201d she shouted, dropping to a crouch. He came clambering down the stairs, fear on his face. He took one look and knew. \u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d he said, getting down on his knees to hold her, fumbling with her phone to get past the password and find the clinic\u2019s number. \u201cYou\u2019re okay, you\u2019re okay, you\u2019re okay.\u201d That time, Malcolm had gone so far as to say that he liked the name Nora for a girl. Dennis for a boy. Without telling her he was going to do it, he moved his childhood dresser from his mother\u2019s house to their house one morning while she was at work. The dresser was still covered with old Mets decals, baseball cards he\u2019d pasted so carefully when he was ten or eleven. Eleven weeks and five days, almost the moment it went from being an embryo to a fetus. The doctor shared a few theories and then repeated what they\u2019d heard before: it was a sign that a healthy pregnancy was possible. \u201cHow do you figure that?\u201d Malcolm asked, incredulous. This clinic was an hour-and-a-half drive from their house. The doctor said that with every setback they learned more, made an adjustment. \u201cOh sure,\u201d Malcolm said after, when they were on their way home. \u201cOf course he wants us to keep going.\u201d \u201cYou think he\u2019s lying to us?\u201d \u201cNot lying, exactly. But\u2014\u201d They crossed the Tappan Zee Bridge, and Malcolm took the first exit. He pulled into a park that overlooked the Hudson. \u201cWant some air?\u201d he asked, and then he got out of the car and walked toward the water. \u201cYou know when we were growing up, there were those couples who didn\u2019t have kids?\u201d he asked when she caught up to him. \u201cMy mom\u2019s friend Annie used to give us two-dollar bills when she visited. Mary and I used to always argue about whether a two-dollar bill was real money or not.\u201d \u201cMy aunt Linda, too,\u201d Jess said. \u201cExactly. So for them\u2014\u201d Malcolm seemed to be turning over what it was he wanted to say. \u201cI assume they wanted kids. Maybe that\u2019s wrong but I assume they did. So they did whatever you could do forty years ago, but then your options ran out pretty fast and you accepted it. It just wasn\u2019t possible. \u201cBut nowadays there\u2019s always going to be someone who\u2019ll say maybe you can, as long as you do x, y, and z and take this cocktail of drugs and do this and that. If you want a baby, even if you have less than a half-percent chance, there\u2019s a doctor who will come up with a protocol.\u201d \u201cAnd thank God, right?\u201d Jess asked, even though she knew that was not the answer he\u2019d come to. \u201cI guess,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cIn some ways, okay, thank God. But when does it end? There\u2019s you, and there\u2019s me. That\u2019s enough for me. I just want you to know that. I think we\u2019re going through a hard thing, but once we\u2019re past it, we can have a great life. We\u2019ve been doing this for a long time. I think you and I alone make a family. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d Part of her was glad he was as shaken as he was. Sometimes she wondered if she was grieving alone. \u201cOf course you\u2019re enough for me, Malcolm,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course we\u2019re a family. I\u2019ve loved you since the first second I saw you. This is just something I always expected for us. It\u2019s hard.\u201d \u201cI know it\u2019s hard,\u201d he said. They looked at the water for a moment longer, and then he turned to her and grinned. \u201cFrom the first second, huh? That\u2019s called lust, Jessica,\u201d he teased, and pulled her close. He believed they\u2019d resolved something, she knew. He believed they\u2019d come to some sort of agreement. Two weeks later, she pulled into their driveway after work to find his old dresser sitting there on the curb, in the dark, like a lonely child whose parents had forgotten about it. She parked and considered for a moment the fact that he was the person she knew better than anyone, but she had absolutely no inkling that this was the task he\u2019d set for himself that day. That this was the day he\u2019d settled on as the day all hope was lost. Nora with the scraped elbow. Dennis who liked to sing in the shower. Did he lay his hand on top of the dresser and bow his head for a moment, or did he bull forward as was his way? When she walked upstairs to look at the spot where it had been sitting, she saw that he\u2019d opened the window a few inches to let in the fresh air. Of course it made sense that Malcolm buy the bar. Long before Hugh told him that it was time, he often stayed up another hour after getting home from work, dawn nearly cracking the sky, just to jot down ideas, changes he\u2019d make to bring it up to date. Sometimes when Jess picked up the iPad they shared, there were tabs open to bars in Los Angeles, Reykjav\u00edk, Tel Aviv. Photos he took screenshots of and emailed to himself. Sleek wood, chrome, leather. Against these beautifully lit images Jess always placed a thought of Malcolm\u2019s car: balls of wax paper from deli sandwiches, wads of nicotine gum, empty soda bottles, and little threads of tobacco, like sand that gets everywhere after a day at the beach. When she made her pitch about donor eggs, he was taken aback. \u201cI told you, Jess. I\u2019m done. I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re done? That\u2019s not really something people say on this subject.\u201d \u201cWell I\u2019m saying it.\u201d \u201cA donor egg would still be your DNA. Is that the issue?\u201d Not that his DNA was all that award winning, she wanted to add. His father dead of a heart attack at forty-three, his mother\u2019s recycling bin always stuffed with empty jugs of Carlo Rossi. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d He held up his hands as if to say he was sorry. Sorry he felt that way. Sorry he couldn\u2019t explain why. \u201cAdoption then,\u201d she suggested, without adding that she\u2019d already done some research and learned it could take years. More years, Malcolm would say. She read an essay by a woman who fostered a child for eighteen months. He came to her as a five-month-old baby boy who lit up her life. After a few weeks with him, she submitted all the adoption paperwork and in the meantime fed him his first solid foods, watched him figure out how to crawl and then walk. It\u2019s happening, she was told. It just takes time. He called her Mama, and also said the words \u201chi,\u201d \u201cbye,\u201d \u201cdog,\u201d \u201cball.\u201d And then suddenly he was taken away. The birth mother wanted him back. The writer\u2019s heartache was raw, as was Jess\u2019s as she read it. She knew she\u2019d never survive that. \u201cNo, Jess,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cWe tried our best.\u201d \u201cBut we didn\u2019t try our best. Hello? I\u2019m literally listing all the other things we can do.\u201d She made an appointment with Dr. Ianucci and though she practiced how she\u2019d put it, what coded language she\u2019d use, when the time came, she was blunt. She wanted to know if there was any way to do it by herself. A donor egg, fertilized with Malcolm\u2019s sperm. \u201cWell, yes,\u201d the doctor said, slightly confused. \u201cA donor egg would be a very smart next step.\u201d \u201cNo. I mean, is there a way to do it so that Malcolm thinks it\u2019s ours. Both of ours. I mean can we go through the motions. You\u2019d just slip a different egg in there.\u201d She waited a moment. \u201cOr a donor embryo if that\u2019s easier. It must happen, right?\u201d There were shady dealings in every corner of business, why would fertility be any different? \u201cJessica,\u201d the doctor said kindly. \u201cJess.\u201d \u201cJess. If you were interested in having a child on your own, that\u2019s one thing. But no, we\u2019re not going to mislead Malcolm. Every couple goes through this, and you\u2019ve been through more than most.\u201d By San Francisco, she\u2019d already had a talk with herself about what exactly could be done about the deal Malcolm had made with Hugh, what could be done about them. She was so sick of every conversation finding each of them braced for the other\u2019s reaction. When she heard his car turn in to their driveway, she made sure she was folding clothes, peeling an orange, occupying her hands so she wouldn\u2019t have to greet him. Once, she held her phone to her ear, signaled to him to stay quiet, and then stepped into the front room and had a loud, one-sided phone conversation about liability and insurance with no one on the other end. She cut herself off mid-sentence, pretending to have been interrupted. She didn\u2019t come out until she heard him turn on the TV. When she organized her thoughts, the top bullet was the fact that they couldn\u2019t go on the way they were for much longer. Her new job required so little travel there was no way to wriggle out of the conference in San Francisco. Malcolm wanted to do a few tune-ups to the bar right away, and at the top of his fix list were tiny things that had driven him nuts for an entire decade. Light fixtures that didn\u2019t work. Certain floorboards that moved like seesaws when people walked across the ends. But one thing led to another, which led to another, as Jess knew it would, as it always did, a warning she spoke aloud and which Malcolm took as a sign of her enduring pessimism. The handyman couldn\u2019t fix the lights, so Malcolm called an electrician, whom Jess let in on her way to the train one morning. Later, the electrician called to say he needed to show them something, he\u2019d meet them there the next morning. Malcolm got up early, Jess called her office to tell her team she\u2019d be late. It was so hot out, one of those days when walking one city block meant her hair would stay damp all day. When they arrived at the bar, the electrician showed them a bundle of wires that Jess knew she was supposed to understand were dangerous, but he might as well have shown her a bunch of bananas for all she could intuit about them. \u201cIs it just this one spot?\u201d Malcolm asked. \u201cNo,\u201d the electrician said. \u201cCan we get away with it for a while longer?\u201d Jess asked, and he looked horrified, like she\u2019d asked him to murder someone. \u201cWhat about the panel?\u201d Malcolm asked. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty new. I remember when Hugh had that put in.\u201d \u201cMalcolm,\u201d the guy said, and Jess realized they knew each other, he was probably a regular. \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s old but it\u2019s way overloaded. AC alone and the thing is maxed. You need to update all of it if you don\u2019t want the whole place to go up one night.\u201d And Malcolm said, \u201cOkay, yeah, of course, go for it. What else can we do?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been this long,\u201d Jess said and turned to Malcolm. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t look into fixing those lights, we wouldn\u2019t even know about it.\u201d \u201cBut I did, and so we do know about it,\u201d Malcolm said, and then turned to his electrician friend. \u201cCan you work mornings? I can\u2019t close. Show me what you\u2019ll need to open up.\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d Jess said. \u201cHang on.\u201d But Malcolm looked at her as he rarely did, only two or three times in their whole relationship, a look that said he was one second away from losing his temper. And if she knew him at all, being that close to revealing some deep part of himself in front of an acquaintance, a customer, meant he was at the very, very end of his rope. A muscle in his cheek was fluttering. \u201cLet\u2019s talk later,\u201d he said to her. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a train to catch?\u201d \u201cLove that guy!\u201d people said when they found out Malcolm Gephardt was her husband, as if she were married to a celebrity, as if they knew him nearly as well as she did. Then they inevitably told some story about Malcolm that she\u2019d never heard, two o\u2019clock in the morning, a packed bar, someone jilted, someone wronged, Malcolm to the rescue. People couldn\u2019t imagine him at home, couldn\u2019t imagine him without a clean shave, a perfectly pressed shirt, sleeves rolled up. They couldn\u2019t imagine the damp towels he always left on the floor, the coins he left in little piles all over the house. They ended up in the dryer, in the vacuum. He used paper towels to blow his nose. When he went to the bathroom upstairs, he always called down to her to \u201cgive it a minute,\u201d as if she had any notion of going in after him. On the morning Jess had to leave for San Francisco, they were down to three digits in their joint checking account, and off the top of her head she could think of two fairly significant bills that still needed to be paid. Seeing that number sent a shock down her arms to the center of her palms. \u201cThere\u2019s a debit from the supply company,\u201d she said, scrolling through their transactions on her phone. She was standing by the front door with her suitcase, looking out for the corporate car service that was picking her up. \u201cWhich one?\u201d Malcolm asked, but with such perfect airiness that Jess knew he knew. \u201cThe one in Jersey,\u201d she said, making her voice even so he couldn\u2019t accuse her of picking a fight. She was merely stating a fact. She waited for him to say that he\u2019d been there, it was his charge, that he knew money was tight but there were things he needed. The bar came fully stocked, but he\u2019d always wanted those oversized wineglasses that looked like fishbowls on stems. Hugh would never agree to them, and Malcolm always said that when he had his own place the first thing he\u2019d do would be to upgrade the wine list and try to attract a clientele that appreciated it. All at once, she knew he bought those dumb glasses. They were the only ones at the supply store not sold by the case. \u201cOh. Yeah. That\u2019s right.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019d you get that could\u2019ve cost this much?\u201d Say it, she encouraged him in her mind. Say it\u2019s none of my business. Say it. \u201cBecause you know those wineglasses you like have no place in a bar like the Half Moon.\u201d She knew she sounded like the exact kind of wife she swore she\u2019d never be, speaking to him like she was his boss, or his mother. Did she want to speak to her husband like he was a child? Of course not. But when a person dreams of partnering with someone for life, no one ever considers the fact that there\u2019s no dependable way to communicate a thought except to say it. \u201cFive ounces will look like one sip in those things. Every bartender will overpour. Customers will complain because even a heavy pour will look short.\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop herself. \u201cPeople will wrap them in napkins and tuck them into purses. Fine to steal pint glasses if Smithwick\u2019s is supplying them, but these? Mal.\u201d \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he muttered, as if she\u2019d arrived at a party just to knock over the cake. \u201cWhat?\u201d Say it, she thought. He glared at her. \u201cTell me what I\u2019m supposed to do. Keep quiet? Even though we already talked about this? And agreed to the exact opposite of spending a few hundred bucks on glasses? The Half Moon isn\u2019t the Plaza. I\u2019m exhausted, Mal. I\u2019ve been working sixty-hour weeks for fifteen years. And at this moment we have\u2014\u201d She glanced down. \u201cNine hundred and twenty three dollars in checking.\u201d \u201cYeah I know it\u2019s not the Plaza, Jess. I\u2019m working hard, too. Always have. You think you\u2019re the only one who works hard around here?\u201d \u201cOh my God that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying and you know it.\u201d He was making the face that made him look like his mother. Whenever he made that face, she saw so clearly how he\u2019d look when he was old. Sometimes Gail claimed that Malcolm got his broadness from her, and then she\u2019d roll her shoulders like she was proud to have the build of a man. \u201cA lot of models have broad shoulders if you notice, makes clothes look nicer,\u201d Gail said to Jess once, and Jess almost choked on her sandwich. \u201cCan you return them?\u201d \u201cYou know, Jess? It\u2019s really none of your business. You mind your career and I\u2019ll mind mine.\u201d Boom, Jess thought. There we have it. She felt a rich, thick heat rush from her center to every part of her body. \u201cIt\u2019s not my business?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in me, in the bar, any of it. You\u2019ve made that clear.\u201d \u201cIf that\u2019s how you\u2019re taking this, then we have a serious problem,\u201d she said at the same moment the car pulled up. Instead of kissing her goodbye, he walked through the house and slammed the back door. Jess\u2019s only real job at the conference was to show her face at cocktail parties, sit along the back wall during panels. Arguing with Malcolm and then getting immediately into a car and brought to the airport left her feeling off-balance. She wasn\u2019t angry, exactly. Or even hurt. It was more like she felt dazed, like everything she was doing, every part of her life, existed at a greater distance from her real self than she\u2019d previously thought. Standing on the security line, lifting her bag onto the belt, her mind was a complete blank. At least I don\u2019t have to worry about fifteen hundred dollars\u2019 worth of fertility medications getting confiscated, she thought. At least there\u2019s that. She touched her back pocket to check for a hair elastic just as she stepped into the body scanner, so they flagged her, but she didn\u2019t quite tune in to the fact that she was being patted down until it was over, and she was swept up once again into the current of people rushing toward the gates. If she read a magazine or sipped a coffee while she waited to board, she couldn\u2019t remember. On the flight, she pulled up a playlist, put on her headphones, but didn\u2019t notice for a full hour that no music was coming through. When she stepped onto the sidewalk at SFO, she felt a relief that was different from her usual relief at having landed safely, more like a surprise pleasure in glimpsing the true size of the world. Thinking about the distance between where she was standing and home\u2014the fact that Malcolm, the Half Moon, the empty rooms in their house, her mother\u2019s comments, their friends, were all three thousand miles away\u2014felt like something heavy being lifted from her shoulders. She took a deep breath and hailed a cab. In her hotel lobby she noticed a group of men around her age, not affiliated with the conference. A bachelor party maybe, Jess figured, though they seemed a little too old. They drew her attention at check-in because there were seven of them, and though they weren\u2019t rowdy exactly, she noticed there were no women among them. They were attractive guys, early to mid-forties, all in relatively good shape, all well-dressed, clearly happy to be with each other. They weren\u2019t intimidating, like a group of men can be. She noticed them again when she went down to the hotel bar for a quick drink before the keynote dinner, a moment to gather her thoughts. They were at a table behind her, talking over each other. She eavesdropped and learned they were supposed to have spent the day golfing somewhere in the Presidio but changed plans because of the rain. Just as she was finishing her drink, one of them came up to the bar and stood next to her, waiting for the bartender. He was close enough for her to notice he smelled good. She was glad she put on a dress for the dinner instead of just changing her blouse. He nodded at her and put his credit card on the bar. He leaned forward on his elbows. He had nice hands. Where his cuff rode up she could see a scar, right above his wrist. She snuck a glance at his face. A nice face, too. There was no one aside from Jess at the bar, but he stood only two feet away. \u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cCould I ask you to\u2014?\u201d He nodded at his credit card and then pointed quickly at the bartender, who was all the way on the other side. \u201cYou want me to give it to her?\u201d she asked. She hadn\u2019t expected him to speak to her. \u201cYeah, I\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, got it. You\u2019re picking up the tab.\u201d \u201cIf one of my friends hasn\u2019t beaten me to it. In a second they\u2019ll notice I\u2019ve been gone too long.\u201d \u201cNo problem,\u201d she said, and slid the credit card toward her napkin. \u201cTell the bartender to keep it and I\u2019ll settle up later. They\u2019ll catch on if I get up again to sign.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll sign for you so she can close it out.\u201d He looked amused. \u201cYou will?\u201d \u201cSure. There\u2019s probably a new bartender coming on soon.\u201d \u201cShe won\u2019t care?\u201d \u201cNah, she\u2019d probably prefer to close,\u201d Jess said. He was studying her face as if he\u2019d noticed she was a woman and not just a person sitting in a convenient spot for his task. \u201cOkay, thanks. I\u2019m Fred.\u201d \u201cFrederick, actually,\u201d she said, tapping his credit card. He smiled, and she liked that his face was so open, that he wasn\u2019t trying to hide the fact that he was enjoying talking to her. Something about his appearance, his bearing, struck Jess as careful. He was not Southern, she decided. Definitely not from the Northeast. Beyond New York and New Jersey she wasn\u2019t good at identifying accents. \u201cWell, thanks,\u201d he said, and as he turned back to his table, Jess noticed the wide column behind them and realized that was the reason he was standing so close, so he could be a little hidden from his friends. Later, after the meet and greet, after the most boring dinner during which speaker after speaker made dark jokes about the end of print media, a bunch of people from the magazine went off to a dance place they heard about and invited her along. Jess had an immediate vision of Christopher from sales throwing his blazer over a chair, losing his mind when Flo Rida came on. She didn\u2019t know them well enough yet, and she was technically senior to all of them so she\u2019d have to buy rounds wherever they ended up. Buying rounds was not something she could do at the moment because even if Bloom reimbursed her, that reimbursement would take six weeks. When she got back to the hotel, it wasn\u2019t even ten o\u2019clock, so she figured one drink, she\u2019d charge it to her room. She checked her phone to see if Malcolm had texted, but all that popped up were photos of her friend Maria\u2019s daughters in the outfits Jess had given them for their birthdays. She chose a seat just a few down from where she\u2019d been sitting earlier. The bartender, a different one, had just placed a vodka soda in front of her when a man\u2019s voice said, \u201cYou tipped thirty percent.\u201d She startled, her hand shook, the liquid sloshed inside her glass and splashed her cuff. She lowered the drink to the coaster without sipping. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said, laying a hand on her shoulder. With his other hand he grabbed napkins, wiped the drops that landed on the bar. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d \u201cI thought thirty was only fair,\u201d she said, pressing a napkin to her wrist, \u201cconsidering the drama you made out of paying.\u201d She switched the way her legs were crossed. He leaned on the edge of a barstool, facing her. \u201cYou\u2019re with the magazine group? The conference?\u201d \u201cYes, but I\u2019m in legal. I\u2019m an attorney.\u201d \u201cNamed Jess,\u201d he said, and she remembered she was still wearing her badge. \u201cShort for Jessica?\u201d \u201cUgh. Yes. Awful.\u201d He made a wounded expression. \u201cMy mother\u2019s name is Jessica. And my grandmother\u2019s.\u201d Flirting was as she remembered, like smacking a beach ball back and forth, trying to keep it aloft. It came back like muscle memory, effortless, more fun the faster they played. \u201cThen they know,\u201d she said. He dropped his chin to his chest when he smiled, and as he did she had the strangest feeling, like the whole conversation was inevitable, like something had remained unspoken when they chatted earlier and the second part of that conversation was unfolding exactly as it was always going to unfold. He held out his hand for her to shake, and when she did, he shook it slowly, held on for longer than necessary. His group was there and seemed rowdier than they\u2019d been earlier in the evening. \u201cYour friends are having fun. Bachelor party?\u201d \u201cAhhh, sort of the opposite.\u201d He turned his back to them as if he were about to divulge a closely guarded secret. \u201cDivorce party. See the guy in the blue button-down?\u201d Jess craned her neck to see over his shoulder, as if it were important to her to know which one was divorcing, as if she hadn\u2019t just been making conversation. \u201cThree out of six are in blue button-downs.\u201d \u201cOkay, a beard.\u201d \u201cTwo of those have beards.\u201d \u201cThey do?\u201d he looked over. \u201cOkay, the one closest to us. The shorter one. His divorce just went through.\u201d \u201cSort of a sad thing to celebrate.\u201d \u201cThat depends.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s been bad for a long time.\u201d Jess considered that. \u201cOne kid. But he\u2019s almost eighteen.\u201d \u201cAh.\u201d \u201cWant to join us?\u201d he asked. He was wearing a wedding ring, she saw. Just being friendly. She was wearing a wedding ring, too. \u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m just finishing this and heading up. But thanks.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cAnd I\u2019m leaving tomorrow. Early flight.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d He paused. \u201cWell, thanks again, Jess.\u201d When he was a few feet away, he turned back. \u201cMy mother\u2019s name is Elise, by the way.\u201d \u201cLucky her,\u201d she said. She watched him in the mirror as he fell into whatever conversation his friends had been having without him. Light-headed, she pressed all of her fingertips to the bar as hard as she could. He was watching her, she was certain of it, and out of nowhere she had a thought of Malcolm and how they used to sleep facing each other in a tangle of arms and legs. Part of her was relieved she no longer woke up three times a night because a limb had fallen asleep under Malcolm\u2019s weight, but another part brimmed with sorrow that the period of their lives that burned brightest might be over. Last time they had sex she couldn\u2019t focus, so she asked him to stand up, to stand behind her, to hold her tighter. \u201cTighter,\u201d she kept saying that afternoon. \u201cI said tighter.\u201d But Malcolm only drew away, put his hands to his head, annoyed. \u201cPretend I\u2019m someone else,\u201d she said, hoping that would ignite something in him, throw him out of his routine. \u201cPretend I\u2019m Emma.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d he said, looking at her with shock, reaching for his boxers. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d But he didn\u2019t actually want her to repeat it. \u201cYou\u2019re really losing it, Jess.\u201d And then he got dressed, walked out of the room, and she was too embarrassed to go downstairs until she was sure he\u2019d left the house. Early on, when she was still in law school and he was the star of the Half Moon, the one everyone went there to see, she forced Cobie to come to Gillam for a weekend to meet him. They\u2019d gotten together a few times by then, nothing serious, or so she told herself. The first time, straight from the bar, he worried he stunk of cigarettes, and offered to take a shower first. To think that someone as beautiful as he was could be self-conscious about any aspect of himself was a revelation. He said that her skin smelled like citrus and then he seemed so pleased with himself when she told him that he was the one who did that, his hands handling limes and orange slices all night, and then touching her. Cobie, who hated the suburbs, who as a rule did not transfer from one form of transportation to another, made an exception for Jess and joked that this guy would have no power over her, that she was already annoyed at his existence, this person who was pulling Jess away from the city all of a sudden. Jess had to explain to her friend how it was that she didn\u2019t know Malcolm growing up, because he was just those critical few years older than she was, and though Gillam was small in some ways, it wasn\u2019t that small. \u201cOkay, well, let\u2019s get a look at him before you work on your origin story,\u201d Cobie said, and rolled her eyes. But even Cobie found herself watching him, she told Jess after, and not only because meeting him was her sole purpose for visiting Gillam. She took in the bar, the crowd, the music, Jess\u2019s other friends from home, but somehow, for some reason, when she wasn\u2019t paying attention, she was always searching for Malcolm. \u201cExactly,\u201d Jess said. \u201cWhat\u2019s that about?\u201d \u201cHe has a lot of presence. And the two of you together?\u201d Cobie asked. \u201cYou\u2019re like the prom king and queen.\u201d \u201cHim, maybe,\u201d Jess said. \u201cNot me.\u201d \u201cNot you alone, no. But with him?\u201d Cobie paused. \u201cYou\u2019re different here.\u201d Jess met Cobie on the first day of college orientation. They\u2019d both complained about their hometowns\u2014Cobie\u2019s all the way in Texas\u2014how the rules of life were prescribed from birth, though the families they\u2019d been born into couldn\u2019t have been more different. Jess asked, tentatively, if it had been hard coming out to her parents, and Cobie laughed and told her she was never \u201cin\u201d\u2014her parents knew she was gay before she did. No, it was something else about home that was strangling her, the notion that what\u2019s important to one person must be important to everyone. All of Jess\u2019s classmates saw themselves as the ones who\u2019d broken free, but oddly, the more the others griped about their hometowns, the more Jess saw that hers wasn\u2019t so bad. The Ryans hadn\u2019t had money, but that wasn\u2019t Gillam\u2019s fault, and in general, she remembered kindnesses. Teachers telling her she was bright, encouraging her along. She\u2019d gotten a decent merit scholarship but had still needed a sizable loan. She ended up deferring repayment to go to law school full-time. She paid for law school with a new loan, and the loan officer seemed pleased to tell her that when the time came she could bundle her loans together, as if it made any difference to her whether she repaid with one check or split the amount into two. At twenty-two, money was still only theoretical to her, and the higher that loan amount climbed, the more abstract it seemed. \u201cGod,\u201d Jess said the first time she saw Malcolm, standing behind the bar, \u201cwho\u2019s that?\u201d It was her friend Jenny\u2019s birthday. They\u2019d been co-captains of the track team their senior year of high school, and they still ran together sometimes when Jess was home. Jenny had just broken off an engagement, and Jess had just broken up with a classmate she\u2019d been seeing half-heartedly. He always finished her sentences and he was always wrong. So they were due for a night out. They\u2019d rounded up a few other friends from high school Jess hadn\u2019t seen in a while. \u201cOh,\u201d Jenny said, with sympathy in her tone. \u201cYou\u2019ve never met Malcolm?\u201d \u201cHello, Jenny\u2019s lawyer friend,\u201d Malcolm said to her later, when it was her turn to buy a round. \u201cYour friends were bragging about you before you got here.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWorking on it.\u201d \u201cWell look at you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m Jess,\u201d she said. \u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m Malcolm.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d she said, and laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re a big hit around here.\u201d When Jess returned to the table hugging eight bottles of beer and wearing a dopey smile, Jenny said, \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. He\u2019s been with everyone.\u201d \u201cThink about what?\u201d Jess asked. But every time she got a chance, she looked over at him. She found an excuse to go home again two weeks later. And then again two weeks after that. Later, when they were together but no one knew, Jess would shout her order over the din and he\u2019d lean very close, as if to hear her better. It wasn\u2019t true that he\u2019d been with everyone. He had rules about never getting together with girls who hung around the bar too much, girls he\u2019d have to see too often when it ended. He wasn\u2019t interested in girls who wore their designs on him too bluntly, the girls who got too drunk and sagged against him at the end of the night. He liked the girls who kept it together, he said, who could hold a normal conversation at midnight. Like Jess. Once everyone knew, the same friends who\u2019d stood alongside her in sympathy the first night started side-eyeing her, sizing her up. Was she in fact too tall? Could her breasts stand to be a bit bigger? Was she actually all that pretty or was she just skinny with good hair? Sometimes it was hard to tell the difference. Occasionally, to give her a break from all the back-and-forth, he came to her apartment in the city, but Jess knew he hated giving up a weekend night at the bar, hated circling in search of a parking spot. If she and Cobie had friends over, he asked Jess\u2019s classmates for stories of what she was like in law school, if she was very serious or if she ever fell asleep in the back row. He said it was unfair that she could picture his day but he couldn\u2019t quite picture hers. When they went out he always had plenty of cash and kept it neatly folded in a clip. He made the guys searching the opens maws of their wallets look like little boys. In her third year, Jess was selected to represent her school on a tour of Southeast Asia as part of an international law initiative. She was twenty-five years old. She wore one of Cobie\u2019s silk blouses to a meeting in Myanmar and ate the best meal of her life in Singapore. She went swimming off the coast of Cambodia and saw the towering Golden Buddha in Thailand. By then she knew she was in love with Malcolm, and sent him a postcard almost every day, mostly about food. She woke up ravenous every morning and asked her classmates if it was the same for them, if they thought it was the time difference, perhaps their bodies didn\u2019t know when their meals were supposed to be and so wanted to eat all the time. She was sick on the plane home, which was embarrassing. She hoped her classmates didn\u2019t hear her retching into the tiny toilet. When she stepped out of the bathroom, a very kind flight attendant handed her a gel ice pack, told her to hold it to her face and neck, it would make her feel better. When she finally got to New York, dragged her suitcase up four flights of stairs to her apartment, she sat up late with Cobie just to talk about all the things they wanted from their lives, all the places they wanted to go. And then she slept for twenty hours, waking only to pee. When she woke up for real she was so hungry that she felt nauseated. Malcolm was on his way to see her. Cobie said she\u2019d clear out as soon as he arrived, but before she left she wanted to add one extra point to that conversation they\u2019d had last night. She said, and asked Jess to please not be mad at her for saying so, that with Malcolm, Jess\u2019s boundaries would always be Gillam\u2019s. She thought Jess would have ended things with him by then, but instead it seemed to be getting more serious. Cobie said it was something she\u2019d been thinking about and she\u2019d be a bad friend if she didn\u2019t make sure Jess knew that. \u201cYou\u2019ve just been to all these places,\u201d Cobie said. \u201cIs Malcolm interested in going anywhere besides Gillam and the Jersey Shore?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d Jess said. \u201cYou need money to travel. Each year of that high school you went to cost more than most people pay for college. So there are things you just do not understand, Cobie. You think regular people can up and fly to Vietnam? I wouldn\u2019t have gone to Asia if someone hadn\u2019t picked my name out of a hat or whatever. If all my expenses hadn\u2019t been paid.\u201d \u201cThere you go,\u201d Cobie said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t pick your name out of a hat and you know it.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not dumb,\u201d Jess said. \u201cFar from it.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say he is.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with the Jersey Shore. It\u2019s beautiful. A lot of people don\u2019t realize.\u201d \u201cI said okay.\u201d \u201cOr Gillam, for that matter.\u201d \u201cI know that.\u201d \u201cAnyway,\u201d Jess said. \u201cHe\u2019s ambitious. His plan is to own his own bar one day.\u201d She laid a hand on her stomach and tucked a pillow behind her head. \u201cGreat,\u201d Cobie said. \u201cAwesome.\u201d What happened in the five minutes between Fred wishing her a good night and getting up from her seat, Jess wondered later, on the flight back to New York and then a thousand times in subsequent weeks. What exactly had she been thinking on the long walk from the bar, across the lobby, past reception, to the elevator bank? Her hands had been shaking, she remembered that. She had to clasp them together and remind herself to breathe. When Jess left the bar area and turned for the elevators, she counted to five\u2014one, two, three, four\u2014and then turned. And there he was, standing in the lobby, looking at her. Just where she knew he\u2019d be. \u201cHey again,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t seem the least bit nervous. He stopped about three feet away from her, shoved his hands deep into his pockets, and raised his shoulders to a shrug. \u201cWant to get a drink?\u201d he asked. \u201cNot here,\u201d he added. Jess glanced over at his buddies, and if they\u2019d all been turned toward them, watching, she would have walked away. But they didn\u2019t even seem to have noticed that he left. \u201cWhere?\u201d Jess asked. \u201cUpstairs?\u201d he said, pressing the elevator button. He didn\u2019t touch her, he just stood very close. \u201cIf you want to.\u201d \u201cJust a drink?\u201d she asked. \u201cProbably not just a drink, no.\u201d He smiled, and it was a kind smile. She wanted to seem like a woman who found the invitation to be no big deal, like it happened all the time. \u201cTell you what. I\u2019m going to room 704. If you want to join me, great. If not, then it was very nice to have met you.\u201d He paused. \u201cIn case you don\u2019t come up, I want to tell you that you are very, very lovely, Jessica-who-hates-her-name. I hope you have someone who tells you that.\u201d When the elevator door closed, she stood there for what felt like a very long time. She listened to the machinery turning, carrying him to his room, steel cables straining and pulling. Then silence. The whole building was waiting for her to decide. She put her palm to the door. She pressed the button and the system sprang to life. When the elevator arrived, she pushed number seven. She thought she\u2019d have a minute to collect herself, but when the doors opened, he was sitting in the armchair across from the elevator. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m nervous,\u201d she said. He closed the space between them, took her elbows, and walked her backward slowly until they arrived at the wall. And then he kissed her. He seemed cautious at first, testing, but then she kissed him back. He pressed his whole body against her, and she could feel his knee between her legs. He had her dress partly unzipped, and she didn\u2019t even notice until she felt his hand on the bare skin of her back. \u201cWe should probably get out of the hall,\u201d he said. But it struck Jess as they moved toward his room that he might be different in there. He might hurt her. Or she might see his toothbrush on the bathroom counter in a pool of murky water and know that the way he appeared to strangers was false, that the wife he left behind in Seattle, or Toronto, or Minneapolis was sick of cleaning up after him, was working up the courage to leave him. \u201cHey,\u201d Jess said, pulling away from him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m going to head to my room. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d he said, immediately taking his hands off her. He sighed, but he was nice about it and that made her feel worse. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cOkay. Let me just\u2014\u201d Frowning, he reached around and zipped up her dress. He patted her back as if to say she was all set. \u201cDo you do this a lot?\u201d she blurted. \u201cI noticed your ring.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean anything by it, but she could see he didn\u2019t like the question and wouldn\u2019t be answering. He called the elevator for her, waited politely until the door opened. The next day, checking out, Jess waited in her room until the very last moment. Then she arranged her hair in front of her face, put on sunglasses, and got out of the hotel as quickly as possible. During the flight home, she thought of the flight attendant on the long journey from Bangkok all those years ago. Jess tried to remember what she\u2019d been like at twenty-five, what she thought about, what she worried about, how quick she was to speak her mind. How sweet that woman was, handing her that ice pack, later bringing her a cold can of ginger ale. How she\u2019d asked, the second time Jess had to rush to the toilet to vomit, if she always felt ill when flying or if perhaps she was expecting. She said Jess\u2019s face was very pale, but she said it with a small smile, as if encouraging Jess to share a secret. Jess remembered how the woman\u2019s colleague had said something to her sharply in Thai, and the attendant who\u2019d been so kind suddenly looked flummoxed. \u201cExpecting what?\u201d Jess had asked, and only much later, in the frigid darkness of coach, thirty thousand feet above Africa, in a tube traveling five hundred miles an hour, did Jess register what she meant. When she arrived at their little house in Gillam after a delayed departure from San Francisco and her driver from LaGuardia taking a wrong turn, she walked in to find Malcolm there, even though it was a Saturday. His face, his stance, the slight cowlick over his left eye that he tended to so carefully in the mirror each morning, the way he tilted his head and rubbed the stubble on his cheek when he was nervous, when he was trying to think of what to say, it was all as familiar to her as her own reflection. \u201cI returned the glasses,\u201d he said, taking her suitcase, moving it to the landing so he\u2019d remember to carry it upstairs. \u201cThey said the credit will show up in about a week.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t call,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t text me even one time.\u201d \u201cNeither did you,\u201d he said. And that had hurt, she could see. It wasn\u2019t a sentence he was capable of saying. Jess felt a sob gathering in her chest, so she put her hands over her face and doubled over like she\u2019d been punched. She made a keening sound that she\u2019d never made before, not even when she lost the baby she\u2019d come to think of as Nora. Malcolm\u2019s Nora. \u201cJessie,\u201d Malcolm whispered, sliding his hand through her hair, pulling her as tight as he could. The solid hulk of him compared to that stranger in a hallway. How could she have gone that far. \u201cJessie. Honey. Don\u2019t cry. Please.\u201d \u201cThe glasses are not the problem.\u201d He was quiet for a long time and then he said that he knew that, of course he knew that, but he didn\u2019t know what to do. \n five They met at a barbeque at Siobh\u00e1n and Patrick\u2019s house, Memorial Day weekend. Siobh\u00e1n called Jess at work that Friday to say that Patrick\u2019s best friend from college had moved to Gillam, she was sure she\u2019d mentioned that to Jess. He didn\u2019t know anyone. He\u2019d moved there because Patrick had talked it up so much over the years and he had to find a place fast, get the kids settled, get them enrolled in school. They\u2019d only ever known the city but Neil liked the idea of a big yard, somewhere commutable to Midtown. Siobh\u00e1n assumed he had plans for the long weekend, but it turned out he didn\u2019t. So now they all had to come over. \u201cHow do you know I don\u2019t have plans?\u201d Jess asked. \u201cDo you?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Siobh\u00e1n was positive Jess had met him at some party or other, their wedding at the very least. As if Jess would be able to recollect all three hundred people who\u2019d attended Siobh\u00e1n and Patrick\u2019s wedding seventeen years ago, after an entire bottle of prosecco and a mishap with the shuttle bus. As if she ever talked to anyone at those parties other than the people she already knew. That was Malcolm\u2019s thing. He was the host of their table. He was the host of the elevator that brought everyone to the top floor. He was the host of the line that snaked its way to the buffet, cracking jokes and pumping the hands of everyone he knew and hadn\u2019t seen in ages. Neil and Malcolm had both been groomsmen, Siobh\u00e1n reminded her. But Patrick had had ten groomsmen, and Jess had been seeing Malcolm for only a few months. She and Siobh\u00e1n were friendly at the time but not close yet. She spent most of the night waiting for Malcolm to wrap up his duties so they could hang out. Siobh\u00e1n said he was worried about his kids, the poor guy. \u201cHis ex should be in jail,\u201d she added. \u201cCan you imagine Patrick picking back-to-school clothes for Cara?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d figure it out,\u201d Jess said. \u201cAnyway, he\u2019s a lawyer,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n said, in the soft voice she used when she was trying to sound innocent. \u201cI think he does something very similar to what you used to do at the firm.\u201d \u201cOh no. No-no-no. What did you say about me? There are a zillion different types of lawyers, Siobh\u00e1n! As soon as he hears how long I was at the firm and then this sudden pivot, he\u2019ll know I left because I didn\u2019t make partner.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n said. \u201cI wanted him to know he has things in common with people here. He claims he\u2019d never even been on this side of the Hudson before he came to look at the house he bought. He relied completely on Patrick\u2019s stories about Gillam, so now the people in those stories have to show up! He doesn\u2019t care why you left the firm! \u201cAlso,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n added. \u201cWe\u2019re having those ribs you like. I\u2019m making the marinade right now.\u201d \u201cOh really?\u201d Jess said. She\u2019d just eaten a dry turkey sandwich at her desk. \u201cI could drink that marinade.\u201d \u201cI know you could.\u201d \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll be there. But stop discussing my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, please.\u201d \u201cI love you.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that he\u2019d care. It was just embarrassing. Jess had been at Bloom for a few months by then. They owned the Half Moon but it was still so new. They weren\u2019t behind yet, though a simple comparison of the profit and loss sheets month over month, charted on a graph, predicted very clearly where the line was headed if something didn\u2019t change. She\u2019d followed that line to its obvious conclusion, had stayed late at work one evening creating a spreadsheet so she could show Malcolm. And she\u2019d been generous! There were expenses she didn\u2019t know about, surely. The unpaid tabs. The unspoken etiquette of cash put down on a table and then pushed away. The macroeconomics of an entire industry, how to tip and why and when and to whom and how much. Cash passed in envelopes or folded into thick wedges and tucked into shirt pockets. Stacked in a safe deposit box, sure, but also removed in denominations of one inch, two inches. But when she brought home this presentation of facts, he glanced at it exactly once and then told her to just tell him what it said. When she explained, said they\u2019d be in the red within six months, said they\u2019d be up an actual creek if they didn\u2019t make a change\u2014get an investor or sell or come up with a brand-new idea for how to get bodies in a dingy room, buying drinks\u2014he said her work was too binary, what with its columns for profit and loss, success and failure. His world was full of nuance, determined by moods, weather, current events. If the Mets made it to the World Series, the bar would kill it in October. Things like that couldn\u2019t be captured on a spreadsheet, he said, and she said yes it certainly could, she\u2019d done it, all he had to do was look. On the day that Siobh\u00e1n called to invite them to the barbeque to meet Neil, Jess and Malcolm hadn\u2019t had sex in almost three months. Afternoon talk shows and morning radio would have her understand that was normal for some couples, but it wasn\u2019t normal for them. She could count exactly how long because the last time was the day she returned from San Francisco, and every day that passed felt like an alarm ringing deep inside her center, keeping her up at night. There was no way he could know what had happened in San Francisco, but part of her wondered. He was eerie like that, the way he could feel in a room if someone was sad, if someone was in a mood to pick a fight. Maybe it was the same way he could detect something not right in her, a wobbling of loyalty, the fraying of a bond. To look at him, no one would think he was thinking about anything at all. By the time Jess started at Bloom, she and Malcolm both knew that their therapist Dr. Hanley was turning out to be a disaster. She\u2019d sought him out to help them sort through their conflicting feelings about fertility\u2014or rather, to convince Malcolm that he wanted what she wanted\u2014but then there was so much more that she didn\u2019t know bothered her until she spoke in that office. They didn\u2019t tell Dr. Hanley that they\u2019d stopped having sex. Every other week, he asked about intimacy, and every other week they just slid right by it, said that everything was fine. Jess wondered how many of his clients were like her and Malcolm, raised to keep all troubling thoughts to themselves, and then, as soon as they possibly could, to bury them. When Jess said that intimacy was fine, and Malcolm looked anywhere but at either of them, Dr. Hanley said that was good, a sign of health, a sign of a solid foundation. After hanging up with Siobh\u00e1n, she saw the time and had to move fast or she\u2019d miss her train. They were supposed to be at Dr. Hanley\u2019s at five o\u2019clock, the latest he was willing to meet at the start of the long weekend. That day felt no different from any other appointment. Jess got to the train in the nick of time, Malcolm was waiting for her at the station, only to sit in the vestibule for five minutes while the previous couple wrapped up and exited through the other door so they wouldn\u2019t encounter each other. Sometimes Dr. Hanley\u2019s white noise machine played ocean sounds and sometimes rain. \u201cYou know he says the same stuff to everyone,\u201d Malcolm said while they waited. He seemed particularly put out to be there that day. Memorial Day weekend could go either way at the bar, could be slow with people away until Monday night, or busier because those who had not gone on vacation would want to go out. He never wanted to be there, clearly\u2014who did?\u2014but on that evening, something about his whole attitude made her angry. The weather was gorgeous\u2014a perfect, cleansing May day. Would she prefer to blow off their appointment and go get a cocktail, sit outside somewhere? Of course. But this was supposed to be good for them. She noticed he\u2019d gotten a haircut at some point that day. There was a pale line at the back of his neck. She was about to ask him if he came to these appointments for himself or for her, if he agreed that there was something between them that needed fixing, when Dr. Hanley ushered them in and they sat down next to each other on the love seat. Malcolm glanced at his phone, and Jess felt her temper flare. So she crossed her legs, leaned forward, and before Dr. Hanley could ask how the last two weeks had been, Jess blurted out that she thought Malcolm had a problem with porn. Malcolm was so surprised he made a sound like a squeak, a sound he\u2019d never made before or since, and then he looked up at the ceiling and sighed. She just wanted to say something new, and they both knew it. A few times over the years he\u2019d suggested they watch together, and though she didn\u2019t object\u2014sometimes she criticized his choice, sometimes she covered her eyes and said \u201cla la la la\u201d until the wet sounds were over, sometimes she tilted her head and looked closely and said she could be in medical school for gynecology, this was probably exactly what it was like\u2014they both knew that she\u2019d never once implied that she was upset or offended. And she wasn\u2019t, really. When she said the word \u201cporn\u201d in Dr. Hanley\u2019s drab office, six miles from their home, in a room that smelled like Pine-Sol and was full of particleboard furniture made to look like mahogany, just days before Dr. Hanley would close his office for three weeks of fishing in Maine and she knew Malcolm was thinking, finally, he\u2019d get a break from the guy, the doctor intertwined his fingers across his belly and tuned way in. Jess could see that Malcolm was trying to seek out the doctor\u2019s eyes to see if there was something to be understood between them. He did not have a problem with porn, he said. Some of what she said in that room might be true, but that? No. Okay, so he watched porn once in a blue moon, he said, turning red, and then he challenged both Jess and Dr. Hanley to find a man in the universe, okay any man with access to the internet, who did not, on occasion, watch porn. \u201cMy father,\u201d Jess said. Malcolm looked at the ceiling again, as if for help. He was, as she knew he would be, hamstrung by the fact that her father was dead. \u201cSure\u201d was all he said. \u201cYou\u2019re saying he did? Where would he even get porn?\u201d Jess asked. He\u2019d died after a long battle with cancer, and had never once, as far as she could recall, used a piece of technology other than the television. \u201cWhere did anyone get porn before the internet?\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019re getting off base here,\u201d Dr. Hanley said. \u201cYou\u2019re saying my mother rented X-rated videos for him? Are you remembering that he couldn\u2019t drive for the last four years of his life?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything, actually. You\u2019re doing all the saying here.\u201d \u201cListen,\u201d Dr. Hanley interjected. He leaned over his knees to tell them there was nothing wrong with anything, as long as both parties were in agreement. But it sounded to him like Jess was not in agreement. Jess could almost see the adrenaline coursing under Malcolm\u2019s skin and thought he\u2019d either walk out or say something dirty just to get Dr. Hanley to change his expression. Instead he said, \u201cJess, I think it\u2019s pretty standard.\u201d \u201cStandard what?\u201d \u201cStandard fare? For two people who\u2019ve been having sex for as long as we have?\u201d \u201cAre we having sex?\u201d He ignored that. \u201cIt\u2019s lazy. You\u2019re hoping you don\u2019t have to put in any work, so you pull up a porn and hope it does the job.\u201d \u201cAnd it does. Sometimes. Doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Jess felt mortified for three seconds, and then absolutely furious. \u201cIf we\u2019re going there, we should go there. Right? Isn\u2019t that what you said? Jess? Have you not been pretty turned on by a porn a few times?\u201d She turned a fraction so that he was talking to the back of her head. \u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d he said. \u201cIsn\u2019t this where we come to say honest things to each other?\u201d He looked at Dr. Hanley, and then because he was already in trouble, he looked at his phone to read a text. \u201cI have to get to the bar.\u201d When he came home that night, he woke her by lifting her shirt over her head. He tugged down her underwear and she told herself to refuse, he\u2019d been such a jerk in Dr. Hanley\u2019s office, and that would teach him. He hadn\u2019t even texted to apologize. But this was the apology, she supposed, or if not an apology it was some kind of message, and it was up to her to decipher it. She couldn\u2019t help looking at him when he sat back on his heels for a moment to take off his shirt. She couldn\u2019t help noticing that he was beautiful, still. He was the kind of man who\u2019d get better with each passing year, because along with age would come a little wisdom, discipline, a flame trimmed back so neatly he could control its height, its heat. It was all there in how he carried himself, how he stood, how he listened. He was immovable, a rock. It was the worst thing about him and the best. But he was angry now\u2014unusual for him to show it\u2014and it was even more unlike him to stay angry for so many hours. He barely looked at her. His skin smelled like gin. It was like he was in a daze, not really seeing her at all, and though her mind and heart felt a little hurt, felt more than a little worried, her body didn\u2019t seem to care. He gripped her hips. He splayed his hand against her chest and pressed her down. It was so fast, and once it was over, instead of collapsing next to her as he normally did, instead of drawing her close and breathing into her neck, he stood and walked into the bathroom, turned on the shower. She closed her eyes and could see his bare shoulders, how he\u2019d hunch them toward the heat of the water, how he\u2019d dip his head, how that long muscle across his abdomen would tense when he reached to clean himself, when he lifted one arm and then the other. She, on the other hand, was fading fast, or so it felt. Her youth was streaming out of her as if from a puncture she couldn\u2019t find, couldn\u2019t patch. After showering, he went downstairs to watch television without even glancing in her direction. Siobh\u00e1n had started out as Malcolm\u2019s friend\u2014she, Patrick, and Malcolm had been hanging out since high school\u2014but over the years had become just as close to Jess. As Malcolm told it, it was Siobh\u00e1n all those years ago who pointed out that Jess was different from the other girls, that she brought out the best in him. Once or twice Jess tried to talk about what was happening between her and Malcolm to Siobh\u00e1n and their friend Alice\u2014Jess\u2019s best friend from high school. That her body had become a cage. That something sick was taking root, she could feel it. Her friends would have good advice, no doubt about it. But every time she felt herself winding up to begin talking, she suddenly became protective of their secret, as she\u2019d come to think of it. Where would she even slip it in? After which sentence? They\u2019d tune in closely. They wouldn\u2019t interrupt. They\u2019d tell her it would all be okay. She imagined herself saying it: He sleeps on the couch at least two nights a week. He went months without touching me. Siobh\u00e1n would insist it was all normal, my goodness, only to be expected, but an alarm would ring in her expression. So Jess always pulled back, hard, like a sluice of water rushing up against a dam. Also, they\u2019d discuss it after, with each other. They\u2019d do it out of concern, but she didn\u2019t want concern; she wanted a concrete solution. She wanted a cure for grief and she wanted someone to tell her where to find it. Siobh\u00e1n and Alice and every other woman in her life were sensitive to what she\u2019d been through and never brought it up explicitly unless Jess did first, but even small talk, even the most careful arrangement of information, was a reminder of their bustling families. It was there in the cars they drove, always full of crumbs and shin guards and orphan socks. It was in the food they stocked in their refrigerators, particularly the drinks: juice boxes and lime green sport-aids and rows of water bottles with floral prints. It was in the way they had to keep a cell phone on the table when they went out to dinner, and had to keep looking at it in case a babysitter texted, in case a kid called from a sleepover to be picked up early. Cobie wouldn\u2019t understand, either, because she grew up in a family where they all said what they felt, and then had follow-up discussions to make sure problems were being addressed. Whenever anyone in her family visited New York, Cobie hugged them tight and said, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d Jess had witnessed these greetings and had barely known where to look. Cobie\u2019s wife had conceived their twins through intrauterine insemination\u2014\u201cvia turkey baster,\u201d as she always put it\u2014and it had all been very straightforward, as far as Jess could tell. Sometimes Cobie seemed to lose track of the reason it had not gone the same way for Jess. Siobh\u00e1n and Alice grew up more like Malcolm and Jess, but whenever Siobh\u00e1n had a few drinks she let her guard down. Very recently, over glasses of wine on Jess\u2019s patio\u2014the first time Jess had invited friends over in a while, Malcolm at work\u2014Siobh\u00e1n made a crack that her kids were conceived nearly the exact moment it crossed their minds to try. \u201cOh God,\u201d she said immediately after, placing her wineglass down on the table. It was as if a cold wind had swept through. Every woman looked chastened, and that\u2019s when Jess glimpsed the extent to which they must discuss her when she wasn\u2019t around. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. That was an incredibly dumb thing to say. What the heck is wrong with me?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Jess asked, as she always did, the many, many times it happened in ways big and small. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Siobh\u00e1n was better at protecting Jess from other people\u2019s stories than she was from her own. Alice, too, had stories about the lengths she and her husband, Jack, went to have sex, always hiding from the kids, being quiet because of the kids, making sure no sounds were uttered, no bedsprings creaked, the time recently that Jack, usually so thrifty, drove her to a hotel fifteen minutes from their house and paid for the night even though they stayed for only three hours. \u201cI would have spent the time watching TV in peace,\u201d Alice joked, but her expression\u2014if not smug, exactly\u2014bordered on self-congratulatory. One morning, Jess decided to surprise Malcolm in the shower, but when she opened the door and slid aside the curtain, he was just standing there with both hands flat against the tiled wall, his face taking the full brunt of the water, his eyes closed, not washing himself, not doing anything. He looked sad, and Malcolm rarely looked sad. Jess stepped backward out of the room, shut the door, tried to wipe the image from her mind. There was a time when he would have felt the slightest tickle of the draft on his skin and known she was standing there, would have pulled her in. He was worried about the bar, she knew he was, even though he acted as if all her worries were built on a foundation of sand. But then he didn\u2019t act like a person who was worried. She heard him humming under his breath when he dragged the garden hose around the yard, and his pleasantness, his general good mood, grated on her as if he\u2019d been clanging symbols and yodeling. \u201cHey!\u201d he said to anyone who shouted hello to him from a passing car, and pumped his fist. Sometimes he called out a specific name. \u201cJohnny B! What you got?\u201d and when she looked out, he\u2019d still be talking through someone\u2019s car window fifteen, twenty minutes later. After everything happened, Jess tried to remember what things had been like at home on the morning of the barbeque where she first met Neil, as she and Malcolm were getting ready to head over to the Hills\u2019 house. She tried to remember what they talked about. They arrived separately because Patrick texted Malcolm to pick up a few bags of ice, and Jess made a Buffalo chicken dip she wanted to bring over early in case Siobh\u00e1n wanted to pretend she made it. They passed each other in the hallway in their haste, each hustling to their separate assignments, Malcolm in a new T-shirt that still had the size sticker on the sleeve. She put her hand on his chest and he looked at her with alarm, as if he had to brace himself every time she took a breath to speak. She saw everything he feared she would say pass through him, and he knew she saw it and neither of them said a word. She peeled the sticker off and held the little XL circle on her fingertip to show him. He stood there, his expression different now, full of relief, though he would have denied it. He looked at the top of her head for a moment before they both motored on. The day was already warm and the Hills\u2019 yard wouldn\u2019t be fully shaded until late afternoon. An hour later, Malcolm was ripping open bags of ice and pouring them into coolers while Jess was helping set chairs on the lawn. The walk over had left her sweaty, and she was fanning herself with a package of napkins when Neil walked into the yard, his son in an infant carrier, only six months old, the two older girls in matching sundresses, sticking so close to their dad that Jess thought they might get tangled up in his legs. She saw him hesitate by the hedge, reach for his younger daughter\u2019s hand. She thought she saw him take a breath, as if girding himself, even though it was just a backyard barbeque, just friends of his friend, and he was an accomplished guy, everyone was on his side, there was nothing to be nervous about. Jess noticed he changed his expression for his daughters, whose faces were tipped up to study his. Out of habit she watched the hedges a moment longer, as if a woman, a wife, the mother of these children, might stride in behind him, but then she remembered. Siobh\u00e1n had told her how young his kids were, but Jess didn\u2019t really take it in until she saw them. \u201cHello.\u201d She waved, about to introduce herself, but next thing Patrick was there, clapping Neil\u2019s back, crouching to look at the baby, and she didn\u2019t want to interrupt. \u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d Jess leaned into the kitchen to tell Siobh\u00e1n, but instead of going out to greet him, Siobh\u00e1n waved her over to the corner of the kitchen, where she was huddled with Toby\u2019s wife, Amanda, and another woman named Laura, the mother of a friend of one of Siobh\u00e1n\u2019s kids, and who was always at the Hills\u2019 parties now. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even try that hard to keep them,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n was saying. \u201cFinal straw was\u2014and don\u2019t ever repeat this\u2014she had the kids in the car after having a few drinks. I forget some of the details, but the story I heard was that one of the girls was supposed to sleep over at a friend\u2019s but started crying to come home, so next thing Christine\u2014that\u2019s his ex\u2014heads out to pick her up, and rather than leave the other two alone she put them in the car with her.\u201d Siobh\u00e1n paused so they could take that in. Jess didn\u2019t like this side of her friend. Her true motive, Jess knew, was getting everyone on Neil\u2019s side, getting them to welcome him and accept him as if he\u2019d been there hanging out with them all along, but she just ended up seeming like a gossip. \u201cThose poor kids,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cUgh,\u201d Laura said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say they lived in the city?\u201d Jess asked. \u201cWhy would she be driving?\u201d \u201cThey have a house on Cape Cod,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n answered, giving her a look that told her she was missing the point. Jess made her eyes wide to tell her friend, Stop talking, but Siobh\u00e1n ignored her. \u201cHad a place, I should say. Chatham. Just sold it. The kids have friends there.\u201d \u201cSelfish,\u201d Amanda said, nodding, as if she knew the type very well. \u201cWhere was he?\u201d Jess nodded toward the slider to indicate Neil. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he go pick them up?\u201d The yard was getting crowded. Siobh\u00e1n must have invited everyone they knew. The women would share with each other what Siobh\u00e1n told them, and they\u2019d tell other people, and before you knew it Neil would walk into Food King and the seas of people would part, would begin a slow clap in their minds. What a man, to take full responsibility for his kids. \u201cAt work I assume,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n said in a tone that asked what that had to do with anything. \u201cAt night?\u201d Jess asked. \u201cWhile on vacation?\u201d Siobh\u00e1n gave her another look, and Jess shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not the drinking per se that I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Amanda said and then paused. Jess alone recognized she was making a little joke, but when no laughs came she turned serious again. \u201cIt\u2019s the neglect.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n agreed. Malcolm would ask why Jess\u2019s first instinct was always to argue with people, but Jess was tempted to recall that it wasn\u2019t all that long ago that she had to wake Patrick at two in the morning to come downstairs and help get his wife up to bed. Patrick came down in his boxers, wrapped his arm around Siobh\u00e1n, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s it, babe, you got it,\u201d every time Siobh\u00e1n climbed another step. Jess grabbed the decorative bowl off the entry table and followed them up, holding the bowl under Siobh\u00e1n\u2019s chin. Neil was a nice-looking guy. He carried himself like an athlete. He was settling the kids, trying to do four things at once. After moving the baby to the shade of the hedge, he led the girls over to the corner of the yard where other kids were congregated. He went down on one knee to speak to them when they seemed hesitant, and Jess liked that he made his face level with theirs. More people arrived, and when he returned to the adults, he moved a chair to make room. He checked on the baby, who\u2019d fallen asleep. He loosened the straps of the boy\u2019s seat and moved him further into the shade. Jess saw in his movements a certain shyness maybe, like he was out of practice mixing with a large group and didn\u2019t quite know how to be. There was a woman out there in the world who\u2019d either lost him or given him up. Jess wondered what the ex was doing at that exact moment. If she felt her family had been ripped from her or if she felt free. A few moments later, when he came in to ask if he could heat up a bottle and Siobh\u00e1n introduced them, Jess spoke to him just like she\u2019d speak to any of the men at the party, spouses within earshot. If anything, she decided later, she was more formal with him because she didn\u2019t know him. More formal because she\u2019d already decided he was attractive. Later she wondered if she already sensed her curiosity taking root, if she already felt a premonition about the degree to which she\u2019d wonder about him\u2014his habits and preferences and the music he liked and whether he drove fast or slow and what he thought about when he had a moment to himself. Siobh\u00e1n introduced her simply as Jess, without mentioning whom she was connected to, so Jess was the one who added \u201cMalcolm\u2019s wife\u201d when she shook his hand. At that moment, Malcolm was over at the makeshift bar. He shouted for Siobh\u00e1n to bring him honey if she had any, bring him the bottle of hot sauce he saw on the counter, too, and she shouted back to get it himself. \u201cJess,\u201d Neil said as if the name rang a bell. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who was at Kinney-Bartle?\u201d Jess felt him appraising her. She felt him deciding that she was not quite what he expected. \u201cI think I work with one of your old classmates.\u201d He named a guy Jess had been in school with, someone Jess hadn\u2019t thought of in years. They\u2019d gone on one very awkward date and had never spoken again. \u201cWhen I said I was moving here, he mentioned you. That you\u2019d grown up here.\u201d \u201cHow in the world did he remember that?\u201d Jess asked, not really expecting an answer. \u201cWell,\u201d Neil said, making sort of a small bow, as if in deference to something. He smiled and Jess blushed. He didn\u2019t seem half as serious as he\u2019d looked out in the yard. \u201cSiobh\u00e1n said you switched to a media company. How\u2019s it going?\u201d \u201cAsk me in a year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say. The hours are better, I can tell you that.\u201d Later, when she was trying to figure out how much to lay at her own feet, she considered whether that was presumptuous of her, that they\u2019d know each other in a year. As they were talking, the other women kept interrupting to ask if he needed anything for the kids. They used words Jess didn\u2019t know. Do you need a Boppy? A binky? Do you have a Tommee Tippee? A Boon Orb? They were all impressed with him\u2014a man who could bathe and dress three kids, get them to a party in a presentable state. A man who could tell when his baby was about to start fussing. \u201cSorry, Jess,\u201d they said when they moved on. Amanda handed out plates with hot dogs that had been cut lengthwise first and then into smaller pieces. \u201cI have a friend who wants a change, and his background sounds like yours. Did you work with a recruiter? I\u2019d put him in touch if you don\u2019t mind giving me your number.\u201d \u201cTotally fine,\u201d Jess said, and watched as he tapped the numbers she recited and then typed J-E-S-S, as if she were the only Jess in the world. Later, when they were walking home, Malcolm asked her what she thought of him. It was their standard review after meeting a new person, and she wondered if he\u2019d forgotten how tense things were between them. Malcolm noticed that Neil hadn\u2019t had a drink. \u201cYou think he\u2019s on the wagon?\u201d he asked. Later, Jess found out that he didn\u2019t drink that day because his kids were with him, and he said it shocked him, upon moving to the suburbs, how often people strapped children into the backseats of their cars and crossed their fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s only three turns!\u201d they joked. \u201cAll back roads!\u201d When he said that, Jess wondered what she and Malcolm would have been like if they\u2019d gotten so lucky. Would they have been careful like Neil or would they have been like most and have no idea how lucky they were? The smaller girl was crying at one point and ran up to the deck where it was mostly women sitting around. \u201cHey,\u201d Jess said. \u201cCan I help?\u201d She smoothed the girl\u2019s sweaty hair away from her face and without the least bit of ceremony the girl placed her hot hand in Jess\u2019s and told her she needed her daddy. \u201cI bet he grew up with money,\u201d Jess said. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cWeird how it\u2019s always obvious. I think the ex got a huge settlement. Maybe to stop her fighting him about the kids.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019d agree to that?\u201d Jess wondered. \u201cWhat woman?\u201d There was a section of street between the Hills\u2019 house and theirs, where there were so many branches overhead, all thick with May blooms, that it felt like walking along an enclosed corridor. For a second Jess was sure Malcolm would take her hand, but instead he hooked his arm around her shoulder, pulled her in roughly for a kiss, and then he let her go. This was him calling a truce. This was him telling her that he hated arguing with her, that he loved her. She circled her arm around his waist and lay her head on his chest. That was her way of saying she agreed. \u201cHe seemed a little blah,\u201d Jess added, and didn\u2019t know why she said that because she didn\u2019t believe it. \u201cWell, he didn\u2019t know anyone besides Patrick,\u201d Malcolm said. At the party, when she and Neil were talking, they were both looking toward the Hills\u2019 old trampoline, so full of kids Jess was worried the bottom would give. \u201cAre any of those yours?\u201d he asked. Jess squinted at the trampoline as if searching for a particular child. \u201cNo,\u201d she said eventually, as if hers might be in the bathroom, at soccer practice, inside taking a nap. She heard nothing from him for several weeks, had forgotten she\u2019d given him her number. And then. A few group texts first, about getting together. A beer garden in Riverside. Dinner in a nearby town or in the city. A band they all liked at the Forest Hills Stadium. Did anyone want to go? His was the only number without a contact assigned. She didn\u2019t know who it could be at first. And then a direct text. Did I see you running by the train this morning? For a moment she thought it was meant for someone else. Except she had gone for a run that morning, and her route took her by the train station. Then she remembered. You should have honked! I could have used encouragement. \u201cAll good?\u201d Malcolm asked. She\u2019d been at the counter dicing celery when Neil\u2019s message came in. They were making dinner together for the first time in a very long time. \u201cOh, fine,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was just\u2014\u201d And then she turned her phone over so it was facedown on the counter. She thought of the show she\u2019d fallen asleep to earlier that week, on National Geographic, about spiders, how they\u2019re born knowing how to weave a web, without ever having seen one, without imagining what a web could be for. Later, as they were washing up, she checked to see if he\u2019d written again. They exchanged maybe two dozen meaningless texts, spread out over many weeks. Mostly about town, Jess\u2019s recommendations. She assumed he was asking Patrick these questions, too. Or Siobh\u00e1n. Or his new neighbors. She assumed he had so many questions that he had to assemble a dozen people to answer because it would be too much for one person. Best sushi, best dry cleaner, whether the Y was clean. He probably had a thousand questions related to the kids, and school, and their activities, and it occurred to her that he was probably asking someone\u2014a parent\u2014for advice on those things. There were probably so many of \u201cthose things\u201d that he was texting that person more than he was texting her. Once, she was driving when she saw his name pop up, and she pulled over to reply. Later, she wondered why she hadn\u2019t simply waited until she got home. It was a little heartbreaking, when she considered it; having to make new friends in his forties, hoping to be included in things, hoping for his kids\u2019 sakes to make inroads in a place that was not his home. His messages ended with three exclamation points, sometimes. Sometimes no punctuation at all. Sometimes he mixed up \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d and \u201cyour.\u201d And yet he seemed fastidious in other ways\u2014she\u2019d glimpsed the interior of his car, she\u2019d seen the diaper bag. Some texts were strictly professional. He sent an article he read about Bloom. He sent an article from a law review he subscribed to. She once mentioned a band she liked, and several days later he sent her a Spotify link to a song by a band she\u2019d never heard of because he thought they were similar and wanted to know if she thought so, too. He was over at the Hills\u2019 house when Siobh\u00e1n called to wish Jess a happy birthday. Jess heard two male voices in the background, and then Siobh\u00e1n switched to speaker so everyone could shout their good wishes. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Jess asked casually, as if she didn\u2019t feel an electric current down her spine as soon as she heard his voice, and just as she knew she would, Siobh\u00e1n listed Neil and his kids alongside the rest of her family. Alice and some other friends had suggested getting together for drinks, but Jess didn\u2019t feel like it. It was a beautiful August night, the cicadas making a racket. Her father used to say that meant the next day would be very hot. \u201cYou still won\u2019t come over?\u201d Siobh\u00e1n asked, taking her off speaker, and Jess felt a little taken aback, like Siobh\u00e1n knew that Neil would be a particular draw for her and was surprised she held out. But Malcolm had already promised they\u2019d do something to celebrate on his night off. She curled up in her bed with a book and woke up sometime in the middle of the night to the jarring brightness of her bedside lamp. She saw him around town a few times, and noted the car he drove\u2014a white SUV, the same as so many others\u2014but his had a royal blue decal on the bumper in the shape of Cape Cod. She found herself looking for that sticker when she was running errands. Thirty-nine is too young to give up on trying for a baby, the Facebook groups told her, even when she typed her whole history, six and a half years of heartbreak summarized into two paragraphs. She read compulsively and then closed her tabs and cleared her history. Women having miracle babies in their forties. One woman at forty-seven with numbers worse than Jess\u2019s. He was back at the Hills\u2019 house for a Labor Day barbeque\u2014they rented an enormous Slip \u2019n Slide for the kids\u2014and Jess saw him glancing over at her a few times before he walked up to say hello. They were shyer with each other in person than they were on text. \u201cWhere\u2019s Malcolm?\u201d he asked after they chatted for a bit. \u201cWorking?\u201d \u201cYes, working today, probably home tomorrow.\u201d \u201cSo many of Patrick\u2019s stories are about that place. Fun times.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d \u201cIs it hard though?\u201d \u201cSorry?\u201d \u201cAll the nights and weekends?\u201d Jess laughed. \u201cHe loves it. He\u2019s a night owl. Never complains.\u201d \u201cNo, I mean for you.\u201d \u201cMe?\u201d Her stomach tightened. He was looking at her so intently. Her heart knocked as if trying to tell her something important. \u201cNo, not really. We\u2019re used to it. We have our rhythm.\u201d When he walked away\u2014called over by Patrick, who wanted him to show the guys something on his phone\u2014Jess felt shaky, like something had happened that she couldn\u2019t describe. He found her on Facebook a week or so after Labor Day, went on a tear of liking her photos one night. She screenshotted the notifications, wrote \u201cpsycho,\u201d and almost sent it to him, but something told her to pause, to think for a second. She slowly deleted the letters of his name. She deleted the screenshot. She put her phone down on her bedside table. She looked at Malcolm sleeping in a heap beside her, his cheeks heavily shadowed though he gave himself a close shave every afternoon. Malcolm lived and died by his routine. He woke up, went to the gym for an hour, stopped by his favorite deli for an egg sandwich on his way home, salt-pepper-ketchup, no cheese, had a quick chat with Jay, with his wife, Carmen, who worked the register, he asked about their kids, about Jay\u2019s brother who had Parkinson\u2019s and had moved in with them, he chatted with whoever else happened to be on line waiting for their own sandwiches, and then he headed off to buy three scratch-offs from the mini-mart. At the mini-mart he usually stayed for a minute to chat with Lorenzo, but if it was Rick at the counter, he just took his tickets and headed home because as Jess knew, as Jess alone knew, Rick gave Malcolm the creeps. He kept a specific scratch-off penny in the cup holder of his car and always scratched the tickets in their driveway, against the steering wheel, his sandwich and coffee getting cold beside him. When he lost, he stuffed the tickets in the pocket of his car door, only emptying them when they began to overflow. Once inside the house, he stood at the counter and read the newspaper for twenty minutes, the crumbs of his sandwich falling all over the pages. Then he showered, shaved, headed off to the Half Moon once again. \u201cAre you happy?\u201d she asked him once. Long before San Francisco. Before they stopped trying for a baby but after it was clear that it was not likely to end happily for them. Before he gave her a firm no to donor eggs, to adoption, but after she sensed he was backing away, recalibrating what he imagined their life would look like. When she asked whether he was happy, he acted as if he didn\u2019t understand the question, like he didn\u2019t even know how being happy or unhappy was relevant to a life like theirs. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked. \u201cI mean, you always seem upbeat but are you really? Do you ever want something else?\u201d \u201cSomething else?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat are my choices?\u201d She saw that he\u2019d never asked himself that question, or if he had, he\u2019d refused to answer. She saw him wondering if what she was really asking was whether she was happy. \u201cYou mean go somewhere else? To live? Do something else for a living? Or do you mean someone else?\u201d \u201cSomewhere else. For a start.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d And then he looked around their little house as if to ask where could be better. \u201cAnd what do you mean \u2018for a start\u2019?\u201d She told herself to respond to Neil\u2019s texts more slowly going forward. She began setting a timer each time one came in. She told herself she was not allowed to respond within two hours. Anything after two hours was okay. But then sometimes he\u2019d send a second, and she didn\u2019t know if she should start the timer over again with each new one. One morning on the old rail trail, she recognized him running toward her, finishing his loop. Couldn\u2019t women and men be friends? Wasn\u2019t she still close with her guy friends from high school, and God knew there was nothing going on between them? It was nearly Christmas, and they were texting enough by then that she stopped herself from polling her girlfriends to find out whether Patrick\u2019s friend from college was texting them all the time, in case the answer was no (in case the answer was yes). Her breathing quickened when she saw him. She decided the best thing was to say something friendly, something forgettable, but to not break her stride. All runners understand not stopping. And it was so cold. They were both wearing knit hats, gloves. But once he reached her, he turned around and ran alongside her without saying a word. He was not as tall as Malcolm. His build was leaner. He had large eyes the color of a faded penny, thick lashes, high cheekbones, full lips. She kept glancing at him and then away, and he kept doing the same. His running watch beeped. Even in the dead of winter his skin had a gold tone and didn\u2019t turn ruddy and pink like hers did, like Malcolm\u2019s did, too. His hair was buzzed to the scalp, and she imagined if he took his hat off right then, the cold would feel like a slap. That morning on the trail, after they\u2019d panted side by side for maybe a quarter mile, he said he was glad he ran into her. His younger daughter needed a haircut but he wasn\u2019t sure which of the local salons would be okay with him bringing in a little girl. He couldn\u2019t exactly take her to the barbershop. Jess imagined him walking into a salon and every woman looking up. She imagined them catching each other\u2019s eyes in the mirrors without betraying a single thought. The older daughter had curly hair and didn\u2019t need it cut so often, he said. But the little one\u2019s hair was long and fine and was always slipping out of the barrette. Jess pictured him fixing his daughters\u2019 hair in the mornings, helping them pick out their outfits. The fathers Jess knew, the fathers Jess and Malcolm had, they weren\u2019t even the same species as this sort of man. Jess tried to imagine her father saying the word \u201cbarrette.\u201d She tried to imagine him watching a video that would teach him how to braid her hair. \u201cHer mom doesn\u2019t\u2014?\u201d Jess began, not knowing quite how to put it. \u201cShe said she\u2019d take care of it. But she hasn\u2019t yet.\u201d He paused. They were nearly at the first mile marker, their rhythms matched exactly. \u201cWe only communicate through lawyers.\u201d He turned to smirk at her. \u201cThey love us.\u201d A lawyer joke. The fighting was so bad that they were keeping two firms afloat. \u201cGod,\u201d Jess said. She couldn\u2019t help it. It was shocking to think two people could love each other enough to get married, and then be rendered incapable of having a conversation about trimming a girl\u2019s hair. And then he said, \u201cFuck her,\u201d like it was nothing, like he was making an observation about the weather. Jess\u2019s pace slowed. She moved a little farther away from him on the path. For the rest of the day she kept hearing him say it: his tone, the anger that bubbled there. Fuck her. She decided to keep her distance. He was Patrick\u2019s friend. No need to be hers. And then, more than a year after they met in the Hills\u2019 backyard, he texted late. Malcolm was at the bar. I\u2019m watching that new movie about the plane crash and the actress reminds me of you It wasn\u2019t dirty. It wasn\u2019t suggestive. She knew the movie. There was some resemblance on her absolute best day. But reading it made her feel like she\u2019d accidently tugged a trip wire. What was the problem, she asked herself in her silent bedroom. That he\u2019d noticed what she looked like? That he was thinking about her? Hadn\u2019t she noticed him? Weren\u2019t they all checking each other out almost all the time? Just a few weeks ago didn\u2019t Jess say to Phil Colombo, whom she\u2019d known since middle school, that she noticed he\u2019d lost weight and that he looked really great\u2014younger and even more handsome than he\u2019d been at twenty? Didn\u2019t she say something to Phil like \u201cgo get \u2019em, tiger,\u201d and didn\u2019t he growl at her before lifting her off the ground in a bear hug? And didn\u2019t all of this happen in front of everyone going about their business in the bread aisle of Food King and not one person felt an antenna rise? So why was there nothing wrong with that, but something a little wrong with Neil\u2019s text? She deleted their whole history. The problem was her response, an immediate drumbeat of desire that started in her belly. Even as she told herself not to text back, she knew she\u2019d text back. She knew whatever this thing was, she wanted to keep it going. But she decided to go to sleep instead. She\u2019d let it fade away and when they saw each other next, she\u2019d make sure to keep the conversation cordial. A few days later, she drove up to Patrick and Siobh\u00e1n\u2019s and he was there, helping Patrick dig out a tree stump. It was the end of summer. His kids were heading into their second school year in Gillam. Jess was dropping off a selection of shoes for Siobh\u00e1n to choose from for a wedding they had coming up. Neil was in an undershirt, his dress shirt draped over a bush, and so Jess imagined he stopped by straight from work for some other reason\u2014maybe Siobh\u00e1n was minding his kids\u2014and then Patrick had roped him into helping. Siobh\u00e1n was making fun of them a little, the veins in their foreheads protruding, struggling to pry the root up with their spades, but Jess found it hard to laugh or speak. She found it hard to follow what her friend was saying, as surprised as she was to see Neil. He seemed startled, too. Patrick called out hello but Neil didn\u2019t. He looked over at her but stayed across the yard. Jess told herself it would be insane to feel hurt by that. They were sweating, streaked with dirt. She barely knew him. But there was something in that moment, a mutual recognition, maybe. If a judge were to catalog the grand total of the exchanges between them, it would read as completely bland, except for the fact of their existence in the first place, why there\u2019d been exchanges at all. Later, Jess knew that was the moment something shifted. She recognized him and he recognized her across the space of maybe forty feet. There were no drinks to sip. No phones to hide behind. \u201cYou okay?\u201d Siobh\u00e1n asked that evening in the yard. It was almost twilight, the days getting shorter. And then in a lower voice, she asked, \u201cDo the supplements still make you feel sick?\u201d \u201cNo, we stopped all that,\u201d she said lightly, as if she hadn\u2019t owed her friend that news for a whole year by then. She spun her car key on her finger and pretended not to notice how closely Siobh\u00e1n was looking at her. She let herself into the house, lined the shoes along the floor. When Siobh\u00e1n joined her she described which ones were most comfortable, which were best for dancing, all the while keeping track of where exactly Neil was standing in Siobh\u00e1n\u2019s yard. \u201cJessie,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n said, her eyes soft with concern. \u201cWant a quick glass of wine? The kids won\u2019t bother us for at least twenty minutes.\u201d She held up a bottle of Sancerre she knew Jess liked. Jess was tempted. Staying meant the men would come in, maybe. Maybe join them. She\u2019d get to see him, sit near him. \u201cOr a cup of tea? It\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve hung out just the two of us,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n added. \u201cCome on.\u201d \u201cI wish I could, Bon-Bon,\u201d Jess said. \u201cBut I have to go.\u201d \u201cMalcolm\u2019s at work!\u201d \u201cMy mother. I\u2019m taking her to dinner.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re acting kind of odd.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d \u201cNothing. I don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cOkay. But soon, please? I feel like we haven\u2019t had a good chat in a long time.\u201d She called out a goodbye to Patrick and Neil as she all but jogged to her car. As soon as she drove around the corner, out of their line of sight, she pulled over and parked, tried to make her body stop trembling. Nothing happened. You stopped by your friend\u2019s house. You dropped off shoes. Nothing happened. But she couldn\u2019t make her bones hear a different tune. She was sure she\u2019d get a text, but nothing came. When she was invited to a party where she assumed he\u2019d be, she declined. She saw him here and there over the next few months, but always kept the conversations light and quick. It was good to see him but she was on her way somewhere. Dr. Hanley was starting to help a little. The Half Moon\u2019s balance sheet made gentle swings back and forth between red and black each month, but never too widely, never too far. Jess started to wonder if maybe it was possible to dance at the edge of a precipice and keep dancing for the rest of your life. By the time they got their invitation to Amanda and Toby\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s party, she told herself that she was cured of whatever feeling had come over her the previous summer. Hormones. Grief. Boredom. The growing sense that life was passing her by and if she didn\u2019t do something she\u2019d leave nothing behind to prove she was even there. Malcolm always said that New Year\u2019s was the one night a year when normal people turn completely feral, so he wanted to be at the bar. He\u2019d hired a DJ, had cleared out the low-tops. He sold tickets in advance and would sell more at the door. The cops would be all over town, giving Breathalyzers. He suggested their friends have New Year\u2019s at the Half Moon but they didn\u2019t want to, the crowd would be too young there, they said, the music too loud. Jess knew he\u2019d never push the idea on anyone, so he didn\u2019t ask twice. Between just the two of them, they compromised. They\u2019d both go over to Toby\u2019s for a while, and then when the time came for Malcolm to head to the bar, Jess could either go with him or stay at the party. \u201cI really will be working though,\u201d he warned her. \u201cYou might want to rope a few people into coming to hang out.\u201d But Jess knew no one would want to change locations, not if they were having fun. Neil was the first person Jess saw when she walked into Amanda and Toby\u2019s kitchen. He was leaning against the counter with his arms folded across his chest, and she saw his eyes jump from her to Malcolm and then back to his conversation in one split second. Malcolm walked right up to him and shook his hand. Jess followed and he said hello to her, kissed her cheek just like he would any other woman on New Year\u2019s Eve. Every conversation Jess had, every circle she stood in, she knew where Neil was and she knew where Malcolm was, without even looking. Malcolm kept stepping outside to call the bar, and every time he returned Jess expected him to say he was leaving, but he stayed. Toby\u2019s daughter came stomping up from the basement in a swivet about how the kids were supposed to know when it was midnight since there was no TV downstairs. And then the power went out. Someone shouted at Toby in the dark, asked if he\u2019d paid his electric. Everyone laughed. It was only around ten o\u2019clock. Malcolm made for the porch to call the bar, to find out if the power outage was all over town. The rest of them held perfectly still, afraid to bang a leg against a chair, afraid to bump against someone\u2019s glass, and then she felt it: a hand pushing aside her hair, the warm press of a kiss on her neck. She was so surprised that she barely registered it in the moment, but after, a minute after and a week, she conjured up that press and release over and over and over, his breath on her skin. \u201cYou look pale,\u201d Malcolm said when the lights came back on. \u201cJust tired,\u201d she said. Used to be that every time she said she was tired, they both wondered if she was pregnant. Malcolm blew a party horn, and the thin plastic unfurled by her ear. \u201cParty pooper,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess that means you won\u2019t come to the bar.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cBut will you drop me at home on your way?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re sure? I could give you Hugh\u2019s old throne. Free cocktails all night?\u201d \u201cBut then I\u2019ll be stuck there until closing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll call you a cab!\u201d \u201cNah,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be impossible to get one tonight. Home, please.\u201d \u201cHeading out?\u201d Neil asked a moment later, appearing in the doorway of the spare bedroom where everyone tossed their coats. \u201cIt\u2019s so early.\u201d Malcolm was still making his way around the living room, saying his goodbyes. \u201cYes,\u201d Jess said, without looking at him. She pretended to search for something in her purse. The sound of glass shattering came from the other room, a scurry for a broom and dustpan, peals of laughter. \u201cHey I\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore, I mean. I just\u2026\u201d He took a step and staggered. He held the back of a chair to steady himself. Oh, Jess thought. There you go. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you,\u201d he said. \u201cNeil,\u201d she said, and they locked eyes. \u201cAll set?\u201d Malcolm came up behind Neil and clapped him on the back one final time. Neil wished them goodnight, returned to the party, to the endless circling about of stories and old jokes and drinks poured with a heavy hand as the night wore on. Amanda was handing out beaded necklaces and plastic glasses with frames that made the numbers 2018. Out on Toby\u2019s porch, Jess pulled the collar of her coat tight and looked up at Malcolm, caught a frown pass across his face. He patted his jacket pockets as if searching for something. \u201cWhat?\u201d Jess asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cI just got the weirdest feeling.\u201d She kept going over it. She kept putting her hand to the place on her neck. What a prude she was turning out to be. Everyone knew boundaries shifted on New Year\u2019s. He\u2019d had too much to drink. Next time she saw him was at Penn Station, mid-January. It wouldn\u2019t have taken much to cut through the crowd to say hello, but she didn\u2019t. He looked different in the city, in his work clothes. He was reading something on his phone, a messenger bag crossed over his chest. She saw him again when she transferred at Secaucus but he was ahead of her and didn\u2019t look back. The whole ride to Gillam she imagined him somewhere on the same train, staring out at the same view, and it was only when they disembarked at Gillam\u2019s station that he saw her. \u201cOh, hey,\u201d he said, surprised. The circle of light cast by the streetlamp enclosed them together. How lonely he must be. How much courage it must have taken to break his life open and change it. The other commuters had already scattered. They each made a bunch of standard complaints about the train. \u201cWas your day okay?\u201d he asked. He seemed to have genuine interest in her answer, so she told him a little about it, then asked about his. He had to go, he said eventually. The sitter was due to leave. His younger daughter needed a rock to paint for school and couldn\u2019t find a good one in the yard. The older girl needed a particular color T-shirt for spirit week and he promised to take her to the mall. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot,\u201d Jess said. \u201cIt is a lot,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAnd by the way. I\u2019ve been meaning to apologize about, you know\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cYou know what I was going to say?\u201d \u201cI think so.\u201d That was a Thursday. On Friday, the very next night, he texted for the first time in a long time, to ask if she was home, if he could stop by. He must have known Malcolm would be at work. Everyone knew where to find Malcolm Gephardt on a Friday night. When he arrived, he closed the door behind himself but just stood on the mat. He wouldn\u2019t take off his coat. Jess thought, maybe he\u2019s dropping something off. But he had nothing in his hands. She was nervous, her voice loud when she offered him something to drink. How cool she was trying to be, how badly she wanted to seem at ease. But instead of answering he put his hands on his head and clutched it like he was trying to hold it together. \u201cJess,\u201d he said, dropping his arms to his sides. She waited, the electric hum inside her body getting stronger. It was now, she knew. It was now. She had a decision to make. She was in cotton joggers. Her old R.E.M. T-shirt. A ponytail. No makeup. He took a step closer and then reached past Jess to the panel of light switches behind her. The cold air from outside rolled off his clothes. He turned off the light in the hall, and Jess knew that he\u2019d decided, that whatever he was about to do he couldn\u2019t have people see if they glanced at her house. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked. She felt like she was breathing through a straw. His coat was unzipped, and she put her hand flat to his chest, over his heart. He went perfectly still, maybe to figure out if she was pushing him away. But she slid that same hand to his shoulder and he groaned like an animal, like she\u2019d injured him somehow. \n six On the second morning after the storm\u2014Sunday\u2014Malcolm woke in the clothes he\u2019d been wearing the day before, his knit hat twisted up with the bedsheets, his coat on the floor. His phone was dead. He remembered getting up in the middle of the night to search the medicine cabinet, and then Jess\u2019s bedside table for an old Xanax that might have escaped the bottle. She never took one until she\u2019d truly tried to sleep on her own, and she made a rule that she could never take more than one a week. But all he found was a tube of self-tanner, a pile of bobby pins, an empty baggie labeled \u201cfolic acid.\u201d He could see his breath in the slant of moonlight. He wondered if Neil Bratton knew by then what trouble she had sleeping, how she fell asleep easily but couldn\u2019t stay asleep, how her thoughts found a loop and stayed there, night after night, all the things she would have done differently, like a marble rolling down a run, the same twists and turns over and over and over. Surely the power would come back that day. Surely something would happen, because he wouldn\u2019t be able to stand another like the previous one, no markers to go by, no beginning, middle, or end. He stood up from his bed, his shoulders aching, and went to the window, first the back and then down the hall to the front, his new snowstorm ritual. The plow had come through\u2014there were grooves on the road\u2014but it must have snowed more because the tracks were blurred. He tried to tell from the sun what time it was, but every corner of the sky was gray. Downstairs, the wall clock showed it was just after ten. He lifted the smaller of the two pots of water on the stove and chugged as much as he could. He placed the pot back down on the range and took a deep breath, pressing his fist to his chest. He opened and closed cabinet doors, looking for something to eat. He ate a bit of the cold meat loaf his mother had wrapped for him on Friday, and hoped she had a good fire going, that she knew to close the doors to trap the heat. He could feel his temper stirring, like chop on the surface of a shallow pond. Amazing to consider the situation he was in, stuck in his house while his bar sat empty and his wife played pretend across town. He closed his eyes and conjured the scene that always calmed him: a vision of the Half Moon packed from end to end, a cover band playing songs everyone loved. He thought of his friend Adrian who worked at the Half Moon for a few years but then moved down south, Nashville first, and then Miami. He\u2019d called Malcolm twice recently. Left voicemails for Malcolm to call him back without saying what he wanted. Malcolm hadn\u2019t gotten around to it, and then just a day or two before the storm, he opened Neat magazine and whose face did he see but Adrian\u2019s, looking at him from his bar \u201con the edge of the world.\u201d It wasn\u2019t really on the edge of the world. It was on St. John, basically a pergola set over a stone patio from the looks of it, up-lighting, the Caribbean shimmering in the background. The article was mostly about the hurricanes that had hit the previous year, and what the rebuilding effort looked like. Malcolm imagined having no heating bill. No cable. No windows to break. Just a steel drum and a nightly sunset. He wondered how Adrian protected the back bar and the stemware when it rained. Maybe Adrian had heard the Half Moon was struggling. He wasn\u2019t a bragger, so Malcolm was sure whatever he wanted had nothing to do with the feature in Neat, but Malcolm couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to call back and hear how well Adrian\u2019s place was doing. Maybe he should visit St. John. He could get out of town for a few days and get some perspective from a friend who knew Gillam, knew Hugh and the Half Moon, knew what it took to run a place. \u201cJesus,\u201d he said aloud, and wished for something, anything, to distract him. There was nothing to clean, nothing to organize except the attic, but he wasn\u2019t going back up there, no way. Malcolm closed his fist against a vision of Bratton\u2019s face collapsing when Malcolm made contact. Patrick\u2019s, too, for inviting him in. Everyone knew, he supposed. Like he didn\u2019t have chances? Like he didn\u2019t have very appealing options every weekend night of his life? He wondered if his mother had gotten anyone to plow her driveway. Last snowfall Mr. Sheridan rode his quad with the plow attachment around the block to clear her driveway after doing his own. Malcolm had just gotten over there, hadn\u2019t started shoveling yet when they heard the quad coming. Seventysomething years old and Mr. Sheridan\u2019s taking corners on two wheels, the plow\u2019s blade scraping the road. His mother suggested it was a little wrong to bypass houses where the people inside also needed help, but Mr. Sheridan said screw that, he wasn\u2019t in charge of the whole neighborhood, and from the way his mother blushed Malcolm knew that she loved the idea of him speeding by Margie Strand\u2019s four-car driveway to get to her. Malcolm was sure she had plenty to eat, at least, but maybe she was scared over there by herself. His sister had called twice in the last few weeks, saying she wanted to talk to him \u201cabout Mom,\u201d but he hadn\u2019t gotten a chance to get back to her, and now his phone was dead. Anyway, he knew what she wanted to say: little mistakes\u2014names, places. He\u2019d noticed, but he wasn\u2019t quite sure how much to worry. She seemed confused, sometimes, about basic things\u2014had she eaten at the diner that morning or was that several days ago? But then a moment later she was razor-sharp again. His mother-in-law had called, too, the only time he heard from her since Jess took off, and left a long message about a raccoon in his mother\u2019s basement but then said there was no raccoon, the basement was fine. He deleted it and figured he\u2019d check it out himself next time he went by, but then he\u2019d gotten tied up at the bar every night, and last time he saw his mother had been in his own kitchen on Friday, late afternoon, when she showed up with dinner. She sat and talked with him while he ate. She seemed totally fine to him except for one tiny thing, a funny thing, really, when he thought about it. When Malcolm teased her for making a meat loaf so big, how would he ever get through it, she said it wouldn\u2019t go to waste, it was her son\u2019s favorite. \u201cYour son?\u201d Malcolm laughed. \u201cHello? Do you have another?\u201d Jess used to say that he wasn\u2019t himself until he had people around, until he had other moods and personalities to react to, and he resented when she said that, as if he were incapable of self-reflection, but now he sort of knew what she meant. It wasn\u2019t that he disliked being alone, it was more like he felt muted, not completely awake. He held a bag of ground coffee, considered whether he could rig up a percolator on the stove if he found matches to light the pilot. And then, after standing there another minute, he heard the crunch of snow under tires, as if from his dreams. A police SUV was rolling slowly up the street, the snow so high it looked like it was floating. Malcolm imagined all his neighbors rushing to their windows, praying that a cop car meant something that would distract them for ten minutes, break up the morning. It kept coming, rolling past the other houses, and stopped at Malcolm\u2019s driveway. Malcolm tried to see who was driving, but the young officer who eventually got out of the car was one Malcolm didn\u2019t recognize. He began making his way across the snow to Malcolm\u2019s door. \u201cMalcolm Gephardt?\u201d the officer said when Malcolm answered his knock. \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d Jess was dead. No one could call. His mobile wasn\u2019t listed. They didn\u2019t know how else to reach him. \u201cYou own the Half Moon on Seneca?\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cYou were there on Friday night?\u201d \u201cYes. What\u2019s going on?\u201d So it was the bar, then, not Jess. The bar had flooded. The bar had filled with carbon monoxide and exploded, taking out half the town. He gestured for the officer to come inside. The cop stomped the mat several times. \u201cCold out, huh?\u201d Malcolm led him down the hall to the kitchen. He stayed on one side of the island, the officer on the other. He wiped down the counter like he was at the bar, about to serve a drink. \u201cSo? What\u2019s up?\u201d \u201cDo you know a Charles Waggoner? I understand he was at your bar on Friday night.\u201d Charles Waggoner. Malcolm felt his body relax. Jess was fine. The bar was fine. It was just some guy named Charles Waggoner who was not fine. \u201cI know a Tripp Waggoner. Any relation? We had a pretty good crowd Friday night. Why? What happened?\u201d \u201cTripp. That\u2019s his nickname. He hasn\u2019t been home since Friday. His wife talked to him around six o\u2019clock, and he was headed to the Half Moon. He told her a friend was dropping him off.\u201d \u201cSorry, today is Sunday, right?\u201d \u201cSunday, yeah,\u201d the officer said as he reached into his pocket and drew out his phone. \u201cIt\u2019s the power being out, the days are blending together. Anyway, this is him. A photo from last summer.\u201d Malcolm nodded. \u201cHe almost got himself into a brawl. He never made it home?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cSorry to hear that.\u201d He should be careful now, he knew. A pair of cops in uniform had come into the bar one afternoon years ago, asking questions about a guy who\u2019d driven his car into a house. He blew right through a stop sign and into the den of a family of five, all of whom were sleeping. There was an eleven-year-old boy whose headboard was not eighteen inches from the front of the car. The guy had been drinking at the Half Moon for hours that day. Did Hugh panic? No. He asked after the officers\u2019 families. He changed the subject every which way. He told Andr\u00e9 to throw two steaks on the grill. When they left, Hugh shrugged and said, \u201cNo one died and insurance will pay for the house to get fixed.\u201d \u201cCan you shed any light?\u201d the officer asked now. \u201cWhat time he left? Did he mention where he might be going?\u201d He\u2019d gotten dropped off, Malcolm heard as if on a delay. So there was no fear of Tripp having plowed his car into someone. He tried to remember\u2014there was a bar in the Bronx recently that made the news because a patron had left on foot\u2014on foot\u2014and assaulted someone, maybe an hour later. The bar had still gotten sued. Maybe whenever he left, whichever way he\u2019d gone, some of the young guys in the group from earlier in the night spotted him. Maybe they caught up with him, continued the argument they\u2019d been having at the bar. He tried to remember the guy who punched Tripp, how young he was. Tripp had taken the punch like all drunk people, like he barely noticed, as numb as he was. But he would have felt it Saturday morning. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know. He never made trouble before, but on Friday he got into it with a group of young guys, so we had him cool out for a bit. I guess that was about nine thirty or so. But then he ended up leaving before we called a cab for him.\u201d \u201c \u2018Cool out\u2019 meaning what?\u201d \u201cMeaning we took him aside, set him up in the kitchen. I figured he should sober up a little. He was at the bar alone, otherwise I would have told whoever he was with to get him out of there. And we kinda know him, he comes in a lot. But anyway, he just left.\u201d There were times, after cutting someone off, when somehow that person seemed even more wasted after an hour of doing nothing than they had while drinking. As if whatever last gulps of alcohol took precisely that long to enter the bloodstream and reach his brain. Maybe that\u2019s what had happened to Tripp. \u201cWhen you say \u2018got into it,\u2019 what do you mean?\u201d \u201cAh, you know. Taking digs at each other about dumb things. People around him were getting sick of it.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t mention any plans?\u201d \u201cMost people were planning on being snowed in, I think,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cIt was a weird night.\u201d \u201cI mean in general. Life plans. Or any trouble he might have been in.\u201d \u201cNo. Not that I remember.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d the officer said. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d The day before him was too long, too shapeless. He hadn\u2019t talked to another person since Friday night. He didn\u2019t want the officer to leave. \u201cYou know, he usually does go on about how he wants to move somewhere far away. Get off the grid. How we\u2019re all suckers for living the way we do, the constant hustle. Stuff like that. He likes to say there are places where it\u2019s spring all year-round.\u201d \u201cYeah? Where would he go?\u201d The officer was interested. \u201cHe seemed really into South America.\u201d \u201cTo Peru? Did he say Peru?\u201d \u201cYeah, Peru. You knew that?\u201d \u201cWhat else did he say?\u201d \u201cJust how beautiful it is there. He\u2019d looked into how much land costs per acre in one particular area, how he\u2019d make his money stretch. Stuff like that. He seems to really hate his job.\u201d The officer waited, as if hoping for more. \u201cI just let people talk. He does something in finance, don\u2019t ask me what.\u201d He thought of Jess, the time she asked him if he was happy, how he\u2019d reacted as if he didn\u2019t know what she was talking about, as if he\u2019d never asked himself that question, the closed expression on her face when she thought she was the only one. Later he thought it was probably mean of him to make her think that, how she might feel lonelier, but if he forged on as if there were no other choices, then so would she. Only it hadn\u2019t worked out that way. Over the past week, Malcolm had gotten bills for a new year of disability insurance, workers\u2019 comp, his permit from the Department of Health, the company that serviced his fire extinguishers and the exhaust hood. He\u2019d owe first-quarter sales tax pretty soon. \u201cDid he ever mention specifics? How he\u2019d go about it if he were to do it?\u201d \u201cNot that I remember. I didn\u2019t take it too seriously, to tell you the truth. You should hear the things people talk about when they\u2019ve tied one on. People don\u2019t realize they\u2019ll bring their exact same problems to a new place, new relationship, new career\u2014whatever it is they think will solve their problems. \u201cHe seems like a pretty nice guy,\u201d Malcolm added, \u201cbut put a few drinks in him and he\u2019s an expert in everything. You know the type? He\u2019ll tell me how to run my bar. He\u2019ll tell you how to be a cop. He\u2019ll tell a fish how to swim.\u201d Malcolm shrugged. \u201cHe was definitely unhappy. A little angry underneath, but that\u2019s everyone. I hope nothing happened to him. \u201cYou want coffee?\u201d Malcolm asked, and then remembered he had no power. \u201cOh wait. Sorry.\u201d The officer closed his notepad and put it in his pocket. Malcolm followed him to the door. He noticed the new four-foot-tall ridge of snow at the end of his driveway. The plow must have pushed it across while they were in the kitchen, and now that ridge was no doubt transforming into a solid block of ice. \u201cIs the power out all over town?\u201d \u201cAll over the county.\u201d \u201cThe roads are okay though?\u201d \u201cNo, the roads are terrible. An alert went out to stay home. We\u2019ve been doing rescues all night.\u201d \u201cBut the forecast said the freeze will last days.\u201d \u201cPeople are getting stuck. For real. Don\u2019t go out if you can help it. Anyway, thanks for your time.\u201d He began to high-step his way down the path, in the same footsteps he\u2019d made on his way in. \u201cHey. Do you think I could get a lift? To my bar? Since you\u2019re driving over that way and your car is on the other side of that mountain?\u201d He glanced again at the enormous ridge of snow where his driveway met the road. \u201cIt\u2019s an old building. I have a generator there but I need to set it up. The lever on the water main broke off a few years ago and I never got it fixed so I\u2019m worried about a pipe bursting.\u201d The officer hesitated. \u201cI\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d \u201cYeah okay,\u201d he said. \u201cI just need one minute,\u201d Malcolm said and then moved as fast as he could through his house. He layered on clean clothes, grabbed his wallet, his keys, his phone. He stepped into his boots and went out the back door to the shed, picked up the canister of gasoline, looked around for what else he might need. He half expected the car to be gone when he got back around to the driveway, but it was still there, waiting. The officer had just summited the ridge of snow and was stumbling down the far side. When it was Malcolm\u2019s turn, he rested the gas can on the crest and climbed over on hands and feet. The car was warm. The street was freshly plowed but Malcolm could see from the way the sun glinted off the surface of the road that the thin layer left behind was all ice. \u201cYour bosses are so worried about Tripp that they sent you out in this?\u201d The young officer didn\u2019t respond at first. He rolled slowly through the stop sign at the end of the street and took the turn without tapping the brake. \u201cYou call him Tripp. Did he tell you to call him that?\u201d \u201cI guess so. I didn\u2019t come up with it myself.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a childhood nickname. He usually introduces himself as Charles. He probably likes you.\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d Malcolm said. The car rolled right through the red light on Raritan. \u201cHe\u2019s my father.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d Malcolm said, trying to remember what exactly he\u2019d said about Tripp. Nothing too bad, he hoped. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be barricading the hill on Overlook Drive. I\u2019m Rob Waggoner.\u201d Malcolm had never pictured Tripp\u2019s kids. \u201cFor a couple years now he\u2019s just been talking crazy about going away. He pulled me aside maybe six months ago, but he\u2019s so full of it in general that I didn\u2019t really tune in to what he was saying. But now he\u2019s gone. Just like he said. I mean, I can\u2019t imagine anyone getting very far after Friday\u2019s storm, but on the other hand we think he\u2019s been planning. He might have looked into getting papers. You know, false documents.\u201d \u201cFalse documents,\u201d Malcolm repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d \u201cI know it sounds crazy. My mom thought he was having an affair. He was being secretive, always closing his laptop when she walked into the room. She sometimes saw him looking through a file folder but when she searched for it when he was at work she could never find it. The little things she did manage to find never had to do with women.\u201d \u201cWhat were they?\u201d \u201cPlaces he wanted to go and how to live there. Patagonia. Mongolia. Northern Canada. Really rugged places. But his favorite was Peru.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re worried can\u2019t you check? Put out a description?\u201d \u201cLike in the movies?\u201d Rob glanced at him. \u201cSend out an APB? Our captain made an announcement to be on the lookout for him and we can alert other police departments, but that\u2019s pretty much it. And it\u2019s busy right now. People getting stuck in this cold, in houses without power.\u201d \u201cListen, people talk all sorts of nonsense they don\u2019t mean,\u201d Malcolm said as they glided down Seneca, the storefronts so peaceful with snow piled on the sills, sticking to the plate glass. \u201cI hear it all the time. I\u2019m going to leave my wife. I\u2019m going to quit my job. I\u2019m going to write my memoir and sell it to Hollywood. But very few people actually do the things they say they\u2019re going to do. And it feels a little dramatic for a guy like Tripp. Plus remember the weather on Friday night? I\u2019m sure he\u2019s holed up somewhere and he\u2019ll be back soon. I bet his phone died.\u201d They pulled up to the Half Moon. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a look around if that\u2019s okay,\u201d Rob said. \u201cI want to picture his night.\u201d There were no other cars around, so Rob left the cruiser running in the middle of the road. \u201cYeah sure,\u201d Malcolm said. He couldn\u2019t remember exactly how he\u2019d left the place, but knew it was in a state, the floors unwashed, glasses grouped here and there. \u201cMight be a bit of a mess,\u201d Malcolm said as he unlocked the door. Just as he feared, he pushed open the door and the first thing he saw was a napkin on the floor, stained with hot sauce. In bright daylight, brighter than usual because of the reflection off the snow, he could see rings on the high-tops. He set his stuff down and listened for the sound of water. He went into the kitchen, opened the mop closet, got down on his knees, and gripped the old pipe. Cold but intact. He walked over to the sink and flipped it on, got the water moving just in case it was icing up in there, ready to bust. It was a good building. Ugly but strong. Sound construction. Hugh wasn\u2019t wrong about that. But it felt colder in there than it had been in his house. \u201cSo anyway,\u201d Malcolm said when he returned to the dining room. \u201cTripp or Charles or whatever we\u2019re calling him\u2014your dad\u2014was sitting over there.\u201d He pointed. \u201cAnd then like I said we took him into the kitchen to put a little distance between him and the group of younger guys he got into it with.\u201d He led Rob through the kitchen door, showed him the chair where Tripp had rested. \u201cThe guys moved on. I don\u2019t know where they went.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d Rob looked around. \u201cAnd then?\u201d \u201cThen he was just gone. I was in and out, my staff was busy. He must have gone out this door because he didn\u2019t come through the main room. I would have seen him.\u201d Rob pushed open the door that led from the kitchen to the alley. Malcolm saw his snow shovel leaning up against the dumpster, exactly where he knew it was. Both men leaned as far as they could out the door and looked left and right. If they were in a movie, this would be when they spotted him, sitting against the far side of the dumpster, frozen solid, icicles hanging from his nose. \u201cThe commuter lot is right there,\u201d Malcolm said, pointing over the flimsy chain-link fence that separated the back of the Half Moon from Metro-North property. He scanned for a body over there, too, and the blinking seriousness of Rob Waggoner\u2019s face told Malcolm he was doing the same. But the snow was thinner there because of the trees, and Malcolm could already tell there was nothing there but the same empty soda bottles and torn cardboard boxes that had littered that spot for years. Rob knew where the commuter lot was, of course. The point was that Tripp could have gone either way. He could have cut left from the kitchen door and walked to the sidewalk around front, or he could have turned right and walked through the parking lot, away from town. Malcolm noticed Rob looking up at the motion-activated light in the alley. There was a small canister underneath that looked like a camera, but the only real camera was on the front door, trained over the bouncer\u2019s shoulder. To install a working camera at both doors was double the price, and Malcolm figured a fake would be good enough. He told Rob that, and apologized, a real security camera would have helped. Together they took a few tentative steps outside, testing the frozen surface of the snow to discover whether it would hold them. Malcolm broke through first, and then Rob. One after another they stamped a path down the alley to the sidewalk. Nothing. They retraced their footsteps, and circled around the back of the building. Malcolm had left his gloves on the bar and his hands felt so cold he was starting to feel pins and needles in his fingertips. \u201cYou should probably check his route home. Just in case.\u201d \u201cI already have.\u201d Rob squinted up at the trees, the lacework of frozen branches. After a moment he said he was heading out but he\u2019d come by later to see if Malcolm needed a lift back home. \u201cNah, don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll crash here.\u201d \u201cYeah? Okay.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t forget to barricade the hill on Overlook.\u201d \u201cOh yeah.\u201d Once Rob left, Malcolm sat at the bar and ate an entire bag of party mix, pouring it into his mouth directly from the plastic pouch. He found two oranges, which he peeled and ate. He checked his phone but all he\u2019d gotten were dumb memes of people wiping out on ice and two from Toby complaining that he was in his third hour of family Monopoly. Nothing from Jess. He used the landline to call his mother\u2014thank goodness he kept the old, corded phone\u2014but it rang and rang. He walked through the bar and flipped chairs over on tables. He swept. Nearly forty-eight hours after losing power the water in the slop sink still ran warm, so he filled a bucket, cleaned every corner of the floor. It was good to be moving, doing something productive. He scrubbed the bar, the back bar. He wiped down the bottles. He got down on the hex mat and cleaned under the rack. He got so warm while he worked that he took off his coat. He imagined Emma walking in, surprised to find him there. He imagined what he\u2019d say, and then what she\u2019d say, and what might happen. He imagined Jess walking in and his body locked up. He wouldn\u2019t make it any easier for her. He\u2019d just stare at her until she spoke, and then he\u2019d tell her it didn\u2019t matter to him in the least what she did with her life. He cleaned the bathroom, emptied all the garbage cans, brought the bags outside, and since he was out there anyway he shimmied his shovel loose from the spot where it had frozen, and then walked around front to clear the sidewalk. He purposely left his phone inside, but after a few minutes he let himself check. Nothing. The water in the tank wouldn\u2019t stay warm forever, so he went to the men\u2019s bathroom and splashed his face, not caring about the puddle growing on the floor. He used the hidden key to open the supply cabinet where the spare hand towels were kept, and he found three fresh undershirts, plain white, still with cardboard inserts. He slowly unfolded the top shirt, held it against himself. \u201cWell okay,\u201d he said, taking off the T-shirt he was wearing and pulling the new one over his head. He used his stale undershirt to wipe down the sinks, wipe up the water on the floor. He wiped down the urinals. Then he dropped his old undershirt into the garbage can and scoured his hands. Fully dressed once again, he went down to the storage room to get the generator he bought in a panic after a freak hurricane, not long after the bar became his. The generator was on the cheap end, not meant to keep the place running, and Jess had argued at the time that they\u2019d be better off spending more on a good one than any money at all on one that would prove near useless in a crisis. The guy who was helping them piped up that he agreed with Jess, that the one Malcolm picked was barely better than a camp generator. Malcolm wanted to ask the guy what business it was of his, but instead of engaging, instead of making his case, he heaved the thing up to the register without using the hand truck, and slapped their credit card down. Jess went silent, staring dead-eyed out the window the whole ride home. Now, two years later, looking at it as if for the first time, he knew Jess was right: the old 1980s space heater he\u2019d inherited from Hugh\u2019s day would pull all of the power. He shook the canister of gasoline he\u2019d grabbed from his shed and wondered how long the gas would last. He found a bottle of engine oil that had never been opened, carried the oil and generator outside, and knelt down in the snow. The air was pale, cold-blasted, and hung more thinly than it did out front. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said as he pulled the start cord once, twice, and then finally the engine kicked on, as loud as a small airplane. Back inside, after setting up the heater, he found matches and lit the pilot on the gas stove. He turned on two burners and held his hands above them for a minute before setting a pot of water and a skillet on top. He opened the walk-in, assessed what would be easiest to cook, and emerged with a pack of burgers. He cracked two off the stack and placed them in the skillet. The buns were frozen, too, so he placed them alongside. He found a dozen votive candles on a shelf and lined them up on the counter to be ready when night fell. Almost five o\u2019clock. His phone\u2019s charge wouldn\u2019t last very long. He looked up the weather forecast and then the local patch to see if they\u2019d estimated when power would return. Why hadn\u2019t he ever gotten that lever fixed on the water main? Because he was too ashamed to ask whether the guy would work on credit. The whole system was so old that the basement needed to be dug up, the entire line replaced. Insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it. Could he forgive her? The question dropped into his mind as if whispered into the quiet. No, he thought immediately, the obvious answer, the answer that had been there on Patrick\u2019s face, on Siobh\u00e1n\u2019s, when they told him on Friday night. Of course not. Not after being made a complete fool of. And yet there was something that trilled between the thoughts that rung out in his head in complete sentences and the shapeless feelings that bubbled underneath, not even close to coherent yet. There was that one night, so many years ago. Jess had switched to the firm, deciding several years later than her classmates that she wanted to be on a partner track. She loved working for the union\u2014she knew those men, she understood better than anyone what protections they needed, and don\u2019t get her started on the few women who were in the Laborers\u2019 International, the work and politicking it must have taken to get accepted\u2014they needed her even more. But that job didn\u2019t pay nearly enough for her to get ahead of her student loans. All of a sudden she made a switch in paths, and was working even longer hours, trying to make up for lost time. She was traveling, having dinner with colleagues in San Diego and Seattle. Every time he called her, he could hear voices in the background but couldn\u2019t match them with faces. At home she was always surrounded by files and folders. They wanted to buy a house but it felt out of reach, still. One of them was always at work. While Jess tried to make herself essential to the firm, he was where he\u2019d always been, at the Half Moon, trying to make sure everyone was having a good time, but also feeling a little stuck for the first time, like he\u2019d eliminated options at some point without even realizing it. John was still there, but other bartenders had moved away, gone back to school, become electricians or stockbrokers or pharmaceutical sales reps. Were other careers better? No, but they had things that Malcolm never cared about before, things that used to make him want to fall asleep from boredom whenever they came up: health care FSAs, 401(k)s. \u201cIf we have a baby,\u201d Jess said when she was making insurance selections from the packet HR had mailed, just before she started at the firm, \u201cwe want it entirely covered. Right? We don\u2019t want to deal with a deductible. It\u2019ll be more out of each paycheck but I think it\u2019s worth it. Right?\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d Malcolm said, without really thinking. That night. Not even a night. An hour. Jess was nearing the finish line on a case she\u2019d been working on for years. She\u2019d seen a doctor, had gotten a few tests. They had no idea what was ahead of them, but he already felt the weight of it rolling toward them. Work, all they did was work. They went days without seeing each other awake, and that morning he noticed she\u2019d circled two upcoming days on the desk calendar, like he was a prize horse and those were the dates he had to perform. He cracked a joke when he saw it. What happened to spontaneity? Meanwhile, Erica Delfino had been after him for probably fifteen years and made no secret of it. At John\u2019s coaxing, he had a bunch of drinks behind the bar, something he very rarely did. Hugh had been in earlier in the evening, so they could be sure he wouldn\u2019t be back, and it had been so long since Malcolm had gotten truly drunk. That night, when he came out from behind the bar to clear the high-tops and Erica leaned into him, he placed his open hand on the small of her back like it was the most natural thing in the world. \u201cKitchen,\u201d he said, and had not the first inkling he was about to make the suggestion until it was out of his mouth. She went in first, and a moment later, he followed. It was late, the bar was busy, but the kitchen was closed, the food wrapped tight and put away. Everyone on staff had left except for Malcolm and John and the bouncer, who would stay on the sidewalk by the front door. She hopped up on the counter, and he remembered driving his hand through her hair, which felt different than Jess\u2019s. Her face was a perfect heart. They weren\u2019t friends, her and Jess. He\u2019d never seen them talk. He cupped her neck and felt her pulse fluttering under his thumb. Just as he was telling himself it was not a big deal, it had nothing to do with Jess or the life they were building together, just after he reminded himself that he was better behaved than most, look at John for example, my God, Jess walked in. Erica was gone instantly. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Mal?\u201d Jess said, cool as could be, taking a slow look around the room. He knew that expression on her face. And surely, she knew his. He assumed she was at home by then, but it turned out she\u2019d gone out with a few friends, ended up going dancing somewhere in New Jersey. When they got into taxis at the end of the night, Jess told her driver to bring her to the Half Moon, to surprise him. She must have stood there and told him that because he knew it afterwards, the next morning and every time the memory popped up unbidden, leaving him with a feeling in his belly like the floor had fallen out from under him. In the moment, inside his brain was nothing but static, white noise. She studied him with a calm so measured that he knew she already knew the answer. If he responded in that moment he couldn\u2019t remember what he said. He remembered only pushing through the swinging door back to the bar, letting himself be absorbed by the noise, the heat, their demands. How many years ago was that? He counted back. For weeks after he could barely stand himself. It crossed his mind at odd times, and every time it did Erica\u2019s face became more common, her willingness more off-putting. He was dumbfounded at how stupid he\u2019d been, how much he\u2019d risked. And for what? To step outside of his life for an hour? To be shored up by someone who meant so little to him? How could he have imagined that would even work? \u201cWhat was all that last night?\u201d Jess asked the next day as she spread peanut butter on a slice of apple and he tipped back two Advil. She\u2019d hung out for an hour after finding him in the kitchen. She\u2019d chatted with everyone and had a few laughs, and he made sure he was way in the weeds behind the bar, too busy to talk. Even as she was chatting, keeping everything light, he could see her mind working it over. \u201cAll what?\u201d he asked, the coffee percolating, their mail piled on the counter. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said, looking at him steadily. \u201cJust tell me. It\u2019s okay if you just tell me.\u201d \u201cI have no clue what you mean.\u201d Why hadn\u2019t he just said he was sorry? That he was obviously out of his mind and it would never ever happen again? Why couldn\u2019t he say that he missed her and he was worried about some change he felt coming over them? He checked what time sunset would be and figured it would take a while for the light to fade completely. The heater was doing its job, but his hands were still so cold. When it became too dark for him to read the credit card receipts, he found a flashlight. He knew he\u2019d never fall asleep on the floor, not considering all the mouse traps he pulled from under the sink and behind the garbage, the squeals of the live ones giving him chills. So he pushed three chairs together so that he could sit up and have his legs supported when he stretched them across. Up until Patrick and Siobh\u00e1n\u2019s visit to the bar on Friday, up until the moment they told him what they knew, it felt to him that as long as no one addressed whatever was happening, as long as they didn\u2019t say the actual words, then it could go on the way it was forever, sort of stalled between spaces, like a hallway between rooms. Were they separated now? The word carried weight, had legal implications, so he\u2019d never used it. But other people had. \u201cYou\u2019ve been separated for months now,\u201d his mother said not long ago, and he got unreasonably mad at her, as if she were forcing whatever was happening between him and Jess into a category where they didn\u2019t fit. He picked up his phone and searched the name Neil Bratton and got seven thousand results. The one that was relevant to him was at the bottom of the first page. There wasn\u2019t much. Two professional photos. Senior partner. The website said his practice focused on civil litigation, government investigations, employer responsibility, and white-collar criminal matters. Impressive, Malcolm thought, though the words sort of washed over him, and then he thought about how smart Neil must be. Jess probably talked with him about things she could never talk to Malcolm about, things he couldn\u2019t even guess because he didn\u2019t know about them. He didn\u2019t like the empty feeling that left him with. So he closed his eyes, pictured a rooftop full of customers, a three-piece band, a starry sky, people laughing, sitting close. He imagined himself at the center, surveying his small kingdom. How great it would be if he could make it happen, somehow. He did quick calculations in his head, and when he didn\u2019t like the answers, he searched Peru. Temperature highs and lows. The government. The price of real estate. His phone was at five percent. Four percent. He searched for a place like he remembered Tripp talking about. He searched for places where the water running off the Andes was so cold it would numb a person\u2019s hand if he reached down to feel it flow. \n seven Azalea Estates, where Neil lived, was considered the posh section of Gillam, but to Jess it had no personality. The houses were different from one another but perfectly so, as if there\u2019d been three models to choose from when the development was being planned and the builder made sure to never put two of the same next to each other. Stone, brick, shingle, repeat. Tan, gray, blue, repeat. Over in her neighborhood, the one she grew up in and the one where she and Malcolm bought a house and imagined they\u2019d raise a family, every house was different because each generation that lived there tacked on an extension, or added a sunporch, or converted a garage to a bedroom. The Dunleavys recently painted their house a bold lilac color, the shutters eggplant, the front door and mailbox a pale pink. For weeks, cars slowed as they passed. Neighbors restrained dogs on leashes as they considered whether a purple house was cheerful or bizarre. Down the shore maybe, but here in Gillam? There was a broken-down RV in the Dunleavys\u2019 potholed driveway and two rusted quads sitting on the lawn for so many years that most of the neighbors had stopped seeing them, until against a different backdrop they were suddenly obvious again. \u201cA train wreck,\u201d Malcolm called it when the paint job was complete. But Jess said at least the whole scene told you something about who they were. There were no strip malls in Neil\u2019s neighborhood. There were no pizza places or ice cream shops kids could walk to unless they crossed the four-lane parkway that at one time marked the boundary of Gillam, and then walked another mile into Gillam proper. The town border moved when Jess was in law school, something to do with the local utility, so a corner of Riverside became Gillam overnight. \u201cTechnically, Gillam,\u201d people said. \u201cBut.\u201d Even in March, when the rest of town was scalded with salt and coated in grit, the spruce trees and boxwoods over in Azalea Estates looked as welcoming as a Christmas movie. She hadn\u2019t set foot in Gillam in over four months on the day she left Cobie\u2019s to stay at Neil\u2019s for the first time. He drove his car to the city that morning instead of taking the train, just so he could pick her up after work. She brought her bag to the office, and all day she considered canceling. It was happening too fast, and she wasn\u2019t ready. She\u2019d lost control of the situation and needed to get it back. She could say something came up. She could say that Cobie and Astrid needed her to babysit. They\u2019d been tense lately\u2014disagreeing on everything from how to break down a box for recycling to where they should go on vacation\u2014and Jess felt sure her presence was causing the strain, though Cobie insisted having her there had made things better, gave her and Astrid something to focus on aside from their kids and each other. Jess had offered to watch the boys for a few days if they wanted to get away somewhere together. \u201cGo for a week!\u201d she said. \u201cWhy not take advantage of me being there?\u201d Astrid had looked at Cobie like she wanted Cobie to say yes, and Jess\u2019s heart broke for her. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad time at work,\u201d Cobie said, and all the hope on Astrid\u2019s face disappeared in one instant. She didn\u2019t say a word. She just loaded lunch boxes into backpacks and said she was taking the dog for a walk. \u201cYou\u2019re not always that nice to her,\u201d Jess said one night when she and Cobie were alone, sipping wine on the terrace. The boys were inside playing Minecraft. \u201cOh!\u201d Cobie laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re doling out relationship advice?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d Jess said. \u201cShe\u2019s a good one. Don\u2019t forget.\u201d \u201cYours is a good one, too,\u201d Cobie said. \u201cMalcolm I mean,\u201d she added, with a droll expression on her face. \u201cYou\u2019ve never said that before. Not once in all these years.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m saying it now.\u201d Cobie shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t like this new guy.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve never even met Neil.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t need to meet him to know. And another thing\u2014\u201d \u201cOh boy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not one or the other. You know? There\u2019s a third choice. You can just be alone for a while.\u201d She could say to Neil that she simply could not go to Gillam. That something in her had folded since he told Patrick what was going on. But he arrived at her building ten minutes earlier than planned and told her to hurry because he was in a bus lane. She jumped into his car so fast that she blinked and next thing they were ticking off miles along the West Side Highway. She thought of the mums she\u2019d planted back in October. She wondered if Malcolm had gotten rid of them when they shriveled and went brown, or if they were still sitting on the front step, their pots full of damp leaves. Once in Gillam, the lights of a car approaching from a side street lit up the interior of Neil\u2019s, and she dipped her head, hoped she hadn\u2019t been recognized. A moment later, they waited at the ludicrously long light on Dearborn while a car of the exact make and model as her mother\u2019s waited on the other side. She arranged her hair in front of her face and asked Neil to please tell her if the plate of that red Camry started with HGX. It did not. \u201cJess,\u201d Neil said. \u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do? You\u2019ve barely said a word since Manhattan.\u201d \u201cHonestly, maybe drop me at the train.\u201d He went to pull over, not at the train but so he could look at her. The streetlamps grew brighter as dusk settled in. She might as well have been onstage. She slid down in her seat. \u201cThis is so dumb.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cI gave the kids a talk. Even Ethan.\u201d Ethan was only two. Jess was especially looking forward to spending time with him. Neil said Ethan seemed to miss his mother most at night, which was a little baffling. They\u2019d split when he was an infant, and the kids were only with her two weekends a month. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t we talk about making this really happen?\u201d Jess was silent. He had raised the idea of her moving in with them, but in the same conversation he\u2019d also asked if she had a divorce lawyer in mind, because if she didn\u2019t he had a few names. They were standing in the vestibule of a crowded restaurant downtown the first time he said the word\u2014\u201cdivorce\u201d\u2014so she turned away, pretended to read the menu, asked the host how long it would be until their table was ready. Later, after their meal, he called her on it, said she was avoiding the issue. But it was her issue to avoid. \u201cI said I\u2019d stay for the weekend. I never said I\u2019d stay longer than that. I have to go to my mom\u2019s. I have to figure it all out from there. I have to see Malcolm and face the music. It\u2019s different for you. I have to do this right.\u201d \u201cNow you have to do this right?\u201d he said. She was tempted to get out of the car right then. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, reaching for her. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m just tired. And impatient, I guess. The minute you make this decision, our lives will be better. We can stop hiding. My girls have questions, I know they do. I\u2019d love for you to meet my parents. But I can\u2019t introduce you if you\u2019re still married. Once you have everything squared away, we can make this really happen. We can be a family.\u201d A messy family, not exactly the one she always wanted but pretty close. She thought of Malcolm, his leisurely Sunday mornings, how they used to pack sandwiches and go on long hikes together before he headed over to check on the bar. Not for the first time, Jess wondered why Neil and his wife had really broken up. It was as he described, no doubt, but his side of the story was surely just one layer in a multilayered plot. Once in a while, when she was sprawled out on Cobie\u2019s enormous beanbag chair with her boys, watching the baking show they loved, she forgot her resolution to only take life day by day and accidentally thought about waking up next to Neil in the middle of the night, his bedside water bottle, his contact lens solution on the bathroom vanity, his reading glasses folded on the table when she went downstairs in the morning. How long until the little items that made up his life seemed familiar to her, part of the backdrop of her day? Where do you put your recycling? she\u2019d ask upon moving in, and then, after being told just once, that\u2019s where she\u2019d put her recycling for the rest of her days. \u201cIt\u2019s being here,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know that. If you lived anywhere else, it would be different. You have to understand the position I\u2019m in. I\u2019m from here. Even if we face this, it\u2019s not as if we\u2019ll be going out to dinner in Gillam. It\u2019s not as if we\u2019ll do our grocery shopping at Food King. I can\u2019t stand the idea of people talking about us.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, and she decided if he said she should have thought of that sooner, she\u2019d open the door and walk away from him forever. \u201cIf I lived anywhere else, we never would have met.\u201d He looked at her, and whatever she was about to say next fell away. The road ahead of them curved gently to the left, and after that, she knew, a stop sign would appear. After the stop sign would come a bump that made her stomach drop when the car rose and fell. She knew every inch of the town, knew it in her blood and her bones. She wondered for the hundredth time what she was doing. Her mother had made a little comment last time they spoke, that Gail Gephardt seemed confused lately. Gail had called Maureen Ryan when she couldn\u2019t get hold of anyone else because she kept hearing a sound in her basement and was convinced it was a raccoon. \u201cWhat a panic,\u201d Jess\u2019s mother reported. \u201cWhat about her friend Artie Sheridan? What about one of Malcolm\u2019s buddies if she couldn\u2019t get hold of her boy? What about animal control? But no, she called me and expected me to hop to it. What am I going to do if I come face-to-face with a raccoon? Anyway. When I went down there I didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d \u201cDoes Malcolm know that?\u201d Jess asked. \u201cAnd there she is at the top of the stairs waiting for me to report back.\u201d \u201cMom.\u201d \u201cDid she even go down there herself? No clue. But she sure thought I should go down there. Like I don\u2019t have my own problems.\u201d \u201cMom. Hello?\u201d \u201cDoes Malcolm know?\u201d her mother echoed. \u201cI\u2019m not Malcolm\u2019s wife. You are. You\u2019d better call him and tell him his mother needs him.\u201d Shortly before Jess left, Gail Gephardt had been on her way to the same hairdresser she\u2019d been seeing for twenty years when she got confused by a detour and called Malcolm from the side of the road. Nothing looked familiar, she insisted. She kept turning like the signs said but then there were no more signs and she didn\u2019t know where she was. Malcolm tried to talk her through how to drop a pin on her phone\u2019s map but she just shouted, \u201cMalcolm!\u201d So he told her to drive until she found a place to buy a cup of coffee, ask the exact address, and then call him back. He told her to sit in her car and enjoy her coffee while she waited, he\u2019d be there before she knew it. It turned out she was less than a mile from her hairdresser, so he led her there at twenty-five miles an hour. When she got out of her car, he could see the fear was gone. She said now that she knew where she was she\u2019d be fine, but he knew she\u2019d encounter the same closed road on her way home, so he bought a paper and waited. \u201cLook at you,\u201d the stylist said when he came in to check how much longer she\u2019d be. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you since you were in college.\u201d And from under her crown of foils Gail said, \u201cThat didn\u2019t last long.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d she said to Neil as the memory faded. \u201cI\u2019m just nervous.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to get better.\u201d I doubt it, she wanted to say, but instead she said, \u201cI hope so.\u201d She was still living with Malcolm the first time she saw Neil\u2019s house. His kids were at their grandparents\u2019 for the night, and Jess felt like she was back in high school, sneaking into a place she shouldn\u2019t be. She couldn\u2019t stay there, no way. She imagined people looking in the windows. She imagined a parent he might know through his girls dropping something off unannounced and spotting her there. It was insane that she had even come as far as his driveway. She ducked down in the passenger seat like a criminal. Jess planned on telling Malcolm that she was going to dinner in White Plains with a college friend and didn\u2019t want to drive home late so she\u2019d crash on her friend\u2019s couch, but he never asked. He had live music at the bar all weekend, was hoping for a solid crowd. She and Neil were headed to dinner an hour north, near Cold Spring. She only agreed to come inside his house because it was dark out, and being inside seemed less risky than waiting in his car. As she waited for him to get whatever he\u2019d forgotten\u2014his wallet or his phone or what?\u2014she took in the tray ceilings, the large, curtainless windows. She\u2019d imagined a masculine space, something modern and sophisticated, something that looked like an extension of the way he dressed, but instead the house seemed like the waiting room of a dentist\u2019s office. In the front room were two ugly, overstuffed couches in mismatched florals pushed up against the walls. A few dark wood tables placed here and there. \u201cWalk me through your thinking here.\u201d \u201cMy mother\u2019s,\u201d Neil said. \u201cStop making that face. I wasn\u2019t going to fight with Christine over couches.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t making a face.\u201d \u201cThe funny thing is I only noticed how bad it was once I started picturing you here, making that face.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are.\u201d Now, only her second time inside his house, his kids chattering in a nearby room, she felt butterflies. They were standing close together in the doorway that led from the mudroom, and Jess knew that he would never take one more step without removing his shoes, not even by accident. How appalled he\u2019d probably be if he could peek inside her memories and see her house in high school, her brother\u2019s cleats leaving little perforated chunks of grass and dried mud all over the house, the sink always full of food scraps that her mother cleared out with her fingers bent like a claw. Meeting out as they\u2019d been doing, hours stolen here and there, meant they always arrived at each other already armored. Neil clean-shaven and impeccable in a white dress shirt, his watch peeking out from beneath his cuff whenever he reached for anything. Jess in mascara, a pencil skirt, a swipe of lip gloss, three dots of concealer under each eye, expertly blended so that there was never any line. But at home, the gold seams of his dress socks against ceramic tile, the vulnerable looseness of his neck that she never noticed before that moment, she wasn\u2019t so sure she wanted that layer exposed. As she got to know him better, she got a strong impression of habits that would reveal themselves more fully with time. \u201cHis ways,\u201d her mother would say. Neil\u2019s ways were to press the door closed behind him until it clicked and then press a moment longer to be sure; to immediately look around with an eye out for what needed to be tidied; to lick his thumb and rub a spot on the mudroom wainscoting that only he could see; to carefully place his briefcase on the end of the bench and then look to see where Jess placed hers. These small things, she knew, were the end of a vein that ran strong and deep through the bedrock of his personality. She brought a cup of coffee into his car once, when he was a few minutes early picking her up, and after looking at it he said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s fine,\u201d as if Jess had asked. I don\u2019t know him, she reminded herself then and now. Not really. Since stepping inside his home, all she could think about was Malcolm, whether he\u2019d heard yet, if it were still possible that he had not, how she would tell him. Now that she was back in Gillam, Malcolm close by somewhere, she felt all the guilt she\u2019d been holding at bay come sweeping over her. That the bar was struggling, that he\u2019d gotten them into something she hadn\u2019t agreed to\u2014that was old information. There was no need to get mad all over again. She pictured him taking the news of her and Neil by crossing his arms and refusing to look at her. Every other man in the world would have guessed, but Malcolm? It probably hadn\u2019t entered his mind. \u201cCome on,\u201d Neil said, when she said that to him. But it was true. Malcolm never imagined people doing things to him that he wouldn\u2019t do to them. Look at Hugh. \u201cYou\u2019ve said he\u2019s cocky. There you go, I guess,\u201d Neil said. And it was the strangest thing, every time Neil even hinted that he agreed with her assessment of Malcolm, she wanted to shift it so he\u2019d understand that he\u2019d never have it exactly right. Malcolm had good reason to be cocky. He was handsome and charming, and when he loved a person he loved that person with his whole heart. He wasn\u2019t demonstrative, but he never complained about anything, ever, and he was always there where you expected him to be. It was why his friends loved him, it was why they\u2019d stuck by him for forty years. In this dramatic divorce, where Neil\u2019s ex was in the complete wrong according to him, who\u2019d gotten all the mutual friends? It was a detail that only occurred to Jess recently. It was weird to think that their friends and neighbors still saw Malcolm all the time, that in the last four months he must have brought in the mail and put gas in his car and bought his usual weekly roundup of scratch-offs. He must have put up Christmas lights and taken them down and carried the ladder on his shoulder. She hadn\u2019t seen any of it, but other people had. Thinking about it gave her the same feeling she got when she jolted awake at night to save herself from falling. She followed Neil down the hall to the kitchen, where the babysitter was lining dirty dishes in the dishwasher. When Neil referenced the sitter, Jess had pictured a teenager. But of course a teenager had to be in school, couldn\u2019t mind children all day. This was a grown woman. Her face rang a bell; Jess either had overlapped with her in high school or had seen her at the Half Moon. Jess hung back, inspected the recessed lighting as if she were there to redecorate the place, to take a few measurements and head out. Neil told the sitter not to worry about the dishes, that she could go, but right in front of her he quickly turned the plates to face the direction opposite to the way she\u2019d loaded them. Maybe he was fastidious to a fault and he\u2019d get that way with her, too\u2014her body and her habits. By the time she stepped inside Neil\u2019s house, they\u2019d been together in hotel rooms, in his office after hours, in his friend\u2019s empty beach house. Almost but not quite in a loaner Jeep when they drove upstate, his car at the dealer for new brakes. Twice at Cobie\u2019s when Jess had the place to herself for a weekend, Cobie and family in Texas for a wedding. He hadn\u2019t liked that, being in someone else\u2019s home, said it made him feel jumpy. But five minutes inside his home, the place where he clipped his nails and nodded off in front of the television, already felt far more private than any of those encounters. She looked away from the kitchen cabinets, where he kept his alternate flours and his vitamins. She looked away from the books piled on the fireplace mantel in case she caught a glimpse of Ayn Rand or Milton Friedman. \u201cI got snipped,\u201d he said at one point, fairly early on. \u201cYou haven\u2019t asked but you should know. In case you were worried. Or in case you were hoping\u2014\u201d It was right around the time they began discussing the idea that whatever was between them wasn\u2019t just a passing thing, that they should probably own it, give it a chance to live. \u201cYou should know I\u2019m not up for that.\u201d \u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she said, but saying it aloud left her with that same bereft feeling she thought she\u2019d left behind, like wandering into a pocket of cold air. \u201cAnyway the problem was me. With all that. Not\u2014\u201d But she didn\u2019t want to say Malcolm\u2019s name. Didn\u2019t want to bring a thought of him into the room, not in this context, not with this person who\u2019d given himself the freedom to have a few thoughts about what had happened between her and Malcolm, what had gone wrong. \u201cI have no hope of getting pregnant. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d But she did have hope\u2014vague, unreasonable. It wasn\u2019t the main draw, but it was there for sure. Nothing concrete, just a passing thought: maybe. A new person, a new combination. What did the private discussion rooms agree on if not this: conception was a mysterious process. She only called herself on it when he told her about the vasectomy and she examined her disappointment. Still, there were the kids already born. The kids who needed a mother more than two weekends a month. When they walked into the family room, the kids didn\u2019t move. The TV was tuned to a woman dressed like a child, dancing. \u201cYou guys,\u201d Neil said. \u201cThis is Jess.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve met Jess,\u201d said the older one. \u201cAt Cara\u2019s house, right?\u201d Jess said. Cara was Patrick and Siobh\u00e1n\u2019s youngest child, the one who lined up with this girl. Suddenly, Jess saw the other way the whole town would find out. This girl would tell everyone in school, and the teachers would hear, most of whom had grown up in Gillam. \u201cYup,\u201d the girl said. \u201cI remember you from there.\u201d \u201cBut you haven\u2019t formally met,\u201d Neil said. \u201cWe have, actually,\u201d the girl said. Well, well, Jess thought. \u201cHi!\u201d the younger girl said. Ethan raised his arms for his daddy. The babysitter, Jess noticed, did not meet her eyes when she passed by on her way out, and Jess saw the first five minutes of the woman\u2019s drive home unfold in her imagination like a scene in a movie. By the time she got to the red light on Main, she\u2019d have texted her eight best friends to let them know that Malcolm Gephardt\u2019s wife just walked into Neil Bratton\u2019s house with the obvious intention of staying. Five of them would text back to say they\u2019d heard something about that, hadn\u2019t Malcolm and his wife broken up back in the fall? One would ask whether Malcolm was the hot bartender at the Half Moon, or was she thinking of someone else? That\u2019s him, six out of eight would reply, and then each would follow up with a flames emoji. One would say that he and his wife always seemed like a mismatch, hotness-wise. One would ask the babysitter-friend to please snap a good pic of Neil next time she was there. He didn\u2019t have much of a social media presence, and they\u2019d like to discuss how he stacked up against Malcolm. \u201cFrom there the whole town will know,\u201d Jess said, once the sitter was gone and she shared her worry. \u201cAnd?\u201d Neil had asked. \u201cWho cares?\u201d Jess tried it on for size. Who cared? Well, she did. For four months she\u2019d been trying to make herself scarce in Cobie\u2019s guest bedroom, hovering like a satellite at the edge of their endless family discussions of who\u2019d take whom to soccer, who\u2019d take whom to chorus, believing when the time came to make a decision it would be obvious what she should do. And then, out of nowhere, Neil spilled everything to Patrick. He and Patrick went to some ski shop up in Warwick that was liquidating. Patrick was the one who heard about it\u2014crazy deals\u2014and roped Neil into going along. They each bought new skis, boots, bags, and then they went out all afternoon. After Neil confessed, his misgivings were enough to sober him up, to prompt him to call Jess from outside the bar. For some reason she pictured him wearing ski boots. \u201cThree Manhattans and it just came out\u201d was how he put it, and didn\u2019t seem all that remorseful. Malcolm could drink twenty Manhattans and still remain a vault. That\u2019s why people told him things. \u201cWait, what?\u201d Jess asked, pressing the phone to her ear, as if that would help. It was windy wherever he was standing. It sounded as if he were yelling at her from across a field. \u201cPatrick was pretty shocked,\u201d Neil said, shouting over the wind. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d \u201cHe said you guys have had a really tough few years. He said maybe he should have seen it coming.\u201d \u201cHe did?\u201d Jess said, and felt defensive, wondered what Patrick would have seen if he\u2019d looked. \u201cWhere\u2019s he right now? Can he hear you?\u201d \u201cNo he\u2019s inside. He\u2019s hitting the head and then getting us another round.\u201d \u201cAnother round? He\u2019s not mad at you?\u201d \u201cMad at me?\u201d \u201cWell. Yes.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s surprised. He doesn\u2019t approve, obviously. But no, he didn\u2019t storm out or anything.\u201d Jess felt a dull ache spread from her center. She felt like she might get sick. \u201cI told him that I know he\u2019s a good friend of Malcolm\u2019s. I told him I knew it put him in a bad spot.\u201d Good friends? They\u2019d been best friends since they were six years old. Patrick used to be afraid of the wind, and Malcolm would hold his hand as they ran across the school parking lot to their bus. When Malcolm\u2019s father died out of the clear blue, Patrick slept on Malcolm\u2019s bedroom floor for a week. But Neil didn\u2019t know any of that. As Neil was talking, Jess\u2019s phone started lighting up. A text from Patrick, asking her to call him, followed by a call, which she declined. Then a call from Siobh\u00e1n. Then twenty texts in approximately fifteen seconds, all from Siobh\u00e1n. Holy shit Jess what\u2019s going on Call me Or Call P Are you okay? What\u2019s going on w you Jessie? You said you needed space That\u2019s what you said so I figured everything you\u2019ve been thru Here\u2019s me and P feeling so bad for you! And thinking M might be to blame With everything, you know He can be so M and not exactly a talker etc Neil told P What in the world? now I hear it\u2019s been going on for ages? W the actual F Jess! I\u2019m not judging would just love to talk Could be a little thing that got carried away, right? Considering everything Just call me asap Neil called again from the Uber he and Patrick shared to get back to Gillam, once Patrick got dropped off. Patrick left his car and their skis behind for pickup the next day. \u201cI think we\u2019ll both feel better when everyone knows, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Jess said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way at all.\u201d \u201cJess,\u201d he said simply. \u201cYou were going to tell Malcolm soon, right? I mean, it\u2019s long past time.\u201d He repeated the thought the next day, when he surprised her at her office and asked her to lunch. He apologized, said if it made her feel any better, he had the most ferocious hangover of his life. He seemed less put together than usual, and halfway down Fifty-Ninth Street he stopped walking, said he actually wasn\u2019t sorry. That she was stalling was something they were both smart enough to understand, and it was time to acknowledge it because otherwise it would just go on and on and on. Did she want to make a go of it or not? Because he did. He wanted a family. A complete family. Not the lopsided thing he\u2019d been living inside since his divorce. And he wanted her, specifically. How many people did he meet that day at Patrick\u2019s Memorial Day barbeque? How many women crossed his path every single day? But it was Jess his mind snagged on. Jess that he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about in the days after. \u201cSo you took matters into your own hands,\u201d Jess said. \u201cYes,\u201d Neil said, and shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s my life, too.\u201d That Patrick hadn\u2019t seemed angry with Neil kept Jess up all night. She didn\u2019t want anyone to be angry at anyone. She wanted everyone to take it in and try to understand. And yet. She had two missed calls from Patrick before eight o\u2019clock that morning. Plus Toby, who was not a texter, wrote to say he thought she was disgusting and to never show her face in his house again. Who told him? Jess wondered. Patrick or Siobh\u00e1n? Had they called him late the night before or first thing in the morning and either way: Why? Had they called Malcolm, too? It wasn\u2019t Toby\u2019s business. Disgusting. She never even liked Toby and long wondered why in the world Malcolm and Patrick let him tag along with them their entire lives. All he did was steal their jokes and brag about his job, as far as she could tell. She kept looking at his text to confirm that\u2019s what he\u2019d written. She\u2019d been heading into a meeting when it popped up. Working to keep her face a blank, she left her files on the conference room table, closed her laptop, silenced her phone, and went into the ladies\u2019 room to stand in a stall for two minutes with her forehead pressed against the faux wood wall. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d she said on the day she left, as she began transferring the piles of clothes to her suitcase. She had an ache at the back of her neck, and her head was splitting. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving,\u201d Malcolm said, and just stood there, watching, his thick shoulders hunched, and for one split second it crossed her mind that he might punch a wall or something. It was in there somewhere, that possibility, but he kept all extreme emotions neatly in line, and he\u2019d sooner pretend it didn\u2019t matter to him at all than to make a scene, even when there was no one around to see it but her. She thought about pointing out that it was the first time in a long time that he\u2019d paid attention to a single thing she did, but she knew she\u2019d sound like a petulant, attention-seeking child, so she swallowed it back. She wasn\u2019t looking for a fight. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving leaving.\u201d She paused what she was doing but didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cWe just need a break.\u201d Why had she said that? That she wasn\u2019t leaving leaving. She didn\u2019t know that. She didn\u2019t know anything. She kept having the same memory of the day she and Malcolm bought the house, how desperate they were to get a down payment together. And then they had it and they felt invincible, twenty-eight and thirty-two, writing a check bigger than either of them ever thought they would be able to. With the deed and keys in hand, they drove to the house immediately after signing, let themselves in, made their way to the living room before Malcolm remembered what he meant to do. He marched Jess back outside so that he could carry her over the threshold. She said she was pretty sure that was a wedding night thing and they\u2019d been married for three years already, but then she was off her feet, laughing, and he was trying not to knock her head against the doorjamb. Inside the empty house, they opened cabinets and turned on faucets. They went down to the basement and scrutinized the furnace. They walked upstairs and listened to the floorboards creak. They climbed into the attic, where Malcolm poked at the insulation. The inspector had said the house would need a new roof soon, but not yet, it would hold out for a little while. \u201cWhat now?\u201d Malcolm asked when they were done with the tour, and were standing in the bare upstairs hallway, smiling at each other. \u201cWe have so much to do,\u201d she said, but half-heartedly. He smelled like shaving cream. Everything about him\u2014from his brow line, to his hands, to the way his pants rested on his hips, was completely masculine. \u201cHere?\u201d she said as he took hold of her hip. \u201cThe floor is too hard.\u201d \u201cYou can be on top.\u201d \u201cMy knees!\u201d \u201cWe can stand,\u201d he said. \u201cI need something to hold on to,\u201d she protested, but she was laughing, had given in. \u201cBesides you.\u201d \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he said, pulling her into the bathroom, where there was a long counter for her to grip if she needed something, mirrors on every wall. When she thought of her child, the child that would have been born, absolutely, had she lived her life differently, that child was all ages at once. He was four, running to keep up with the other trick-or-treaters, his plastic pumpkin bucket knocking against his knees. She was a ten-month-old, the surprising weight of her sitting on Jess\u2019s arm. He was an adolescent and Jess was the age she was now, walking into his bedroom and telling him to crack a window, my God. She dreaded telling her mother she was leaving, the questions that would come, and even in her mind, explaining it was like pinning down a cloud. Car packed, she drove away from her house without looking back at Malcolm, at the bewildered expression on his handsome face. She drove straight to her mother\u2019s, said she couldn\u2019t stay, said she had something to tell her that she didn\u2019t want her to hear around town or from Malcolm if she happened to go by the house, but then her mother clapped her hand over her mouth and Jess saw that she thought the news had to do with a baby. So she had to let her bring out the Vienna Fingers, make a pot of tea. She heard herself say it again, that she wasn\u2019t leaving leaving, they just needed a little time apart, and her mother pointed out that Jess had probably never expected Malcolm to stay a bartender, not deep down anyway, no matter what she might have told herself. Jess could see by the way she sat, the way she raised her eyebrows and fixed her mouth, that she\u2019d been wanting to say that for a long time. Maureen claimed that she saw it all coming ages ago, the very first time Malcolm strolled into their kitchen at eight thirty in the morning, not one shred of shame on his face. \u201cYou\u2019d stand up to look at him, my goodness, it was like he filled a room just by walking into it, but\u2014\u201d she said. \u201cAnyway, I tried to tell you.\u201d All those bright men Jess had been in school with! From all over! What was the point of that student loan debt if not to tie her life to one of them? They were from states you never even hear about! That redheaded guy\u2014what was his name?\u2014smart as a whip, who knew what he was even talking about half the time, and didn\u2019t his mother\u2019s side of the family have a vineyard in Washington State or someplace? Oregon? \u201cHe loved you,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI saw the way he looked at you.\u201d But what did Jess do? Maureen Ryan mused. She dumped him and fell for the local bartender. \u201cCobie,\u201d her mother said, when Jess told her where she\u2019d be staying while she thought things out. \u201cShe\u2019s still with that woman? She\u2019s still\u2014\u201d \u201c \u2018That woman\u2019? You mean her wife? Are you asking if she\u2019s still gay?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t go getting mad at me, but maybe you should have hung around with girls more like you. Maybe that was your mistake. You could have been on the lookout together.\u201d \u201cOh my God,\u201d Jess said, looking out the kitchen window. She could see streaks where the sun hit. She had no energy left to argue. \u201cAnyway,\u201d her mother went on. Wasn\u2019t it at least possible that women shouldn\u2019t be working like men? It was wonderful to earn a living, sure, she guessed so, Maureen had worked her whole life, too, but was it right? Did it not, in fact, do something maybe to a woman\u2019s body? All those hours and that stress? Running for trains? Have women possibly ruined things for themselves? Jess went to the cabinet where her mother kept her vitamins and prescriptions. She reached past four bottles of super omega-3 capsules, cod-liver oil, women\u2019s dailies, the various antibiotics Maureen never finished because why ever listen to the doctors she demanded to see. She plucked out a bottle of ibuprofen, fished out two, swallowed them dry. She glanced at the expiration date\u2014four years earlier\u2014and took one more. \u201cYou know more than a fleet of medical experts, I guess.\u201d \u201cWell, tell me what doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cTwo young, healthy people.\u201d Jess sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that. There\u2019s more than that now.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d Maureen said, and for the first time since Jess came in, there was silence. Jess counted the ticks of the old clock. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Jessie. But look. At least there aren\u2019t any kids.\u201d Jess was angry driving away from Gillam, like she could toss a match behind her and watch the whole place go up and not feel one bit bad about it, but once she got on the Palisades, got as far as the gas station right before the bridge, and then the toll plaza, she could feel something else move in, like weather she was helpless to watch come and go. Malcolm had the Halloween party at the bar that night, and he\u2019d been so worried it would be a flop. He\u2019d put out money for decorations, for prizes. He had a cover band going on at 9:00 p.m. He\u2019d had Roddy put it on Facebook and then take it down because everyone said Facebook was lame, and then put it back up again because someone else said it was still good for community news. Roddy told him the bar should have its own account, but maybe not Facebook, which was for old people, and Malcolm had said he didn\u2019t know places had accounts, he thought it was just people, and Roddy had said, \u201cOh yeah, brands, buildings, pets, anything.\u201d Roddy was good at the internet, getting info on his phone. Malcolm hoped the kid eventually went back to college. Malcolm had Roddy post on social media, but he still went over to the office supply store and printed a hundred flyers like it was 1998. He divided the pile among everyone on staff and told them to post them at bagel shops, Laundromats, Dunkin\u2019, bus stops, everywhere they went. Roddy said there\u2019d be a good crowd. He could tell by the metrics. And he turned out to be right. Malcolm never knew what to do with himself when he was alone in the house. And Jess was pretty sure she\u2019d used the last of the half-and-half. He probably wouldn\u2019t notice until he made his next pot of coffee, and then what? Jess pulled over to the shoulder just after the toll plaza and rolled down all the windows of her car. Just ahead was the helix that would carry her to the bridge, and then to Manhattan, then down the West Side to Cobie\u2019s. He\u2019d feel less nervous about the Halloween party if she went. He\u2019d feel even less nervous about it if she put on her old Mia Wallace costume\u2014her bangs at that moment were the exact right length, she might not even need the wig\u2014and made it her mission to have a great time. She could always leave him again tomorrow. A Port Authority Police cruiser pulled up to her bumper, blipped the siren, and flashed the lights. \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Jess whispered to her empty car and then drove on. She spent seventeen weeks in Cobie\u2019s guest bedroom and tried to think of it as time outside of time, like a burl on a tree is part of the trunk but also its own thing, complex and apart, created in response to injury or illness, the tree\u2019s way of healing itself. She didn\u2019t answer any calls, except from Neil and sometimes not even his. She almost never responded to texts. She took long walks after work to give Cobie privacy with her family. Sometimes she took the twins to the movies and for milkshakes, watched them flip their skateboards, listened to them play their instruments. When Cobie and Astrid argued, they usually did so via text, often while sitting in the same room. Cobie said it was so the kids wouldn\u2019t hear them, but once, when both Cobie and Astrid were hunched over their phones with miserable expressions on their faces, furiously pecking away, the boys looked over at Jess as if to ask whether she understood what was happening. They rolled their eyes. But then, almost as often, she caught either Cobie or Astrid looking down at her phone and then looking across the room at the other with a grin. And then Neil had gotten hammered with Patrick, spilled everything, and the burl was cut away, leaving only the damaged trunk. The first night she spent at Neil\u2019s, the Thursday before the storm, she stayed downstairs when he went up to manage baths, toothbrushing, pajamas, books. The kids were off from school the following day\u2014a conference for the teachers\u2014so Jess and Neil took off, too. The plan was to play games with the kids all day, bake, watch movies, let them get to know Jess better ahead of the snowstorm that was due to arrive on Friday evening. The latest forecasts showed the storm would be bigger than the news had first estimated, but there was time still, projections changed, it wouldn\u2019t be the first storm the weather people made a big drama about that didn\u2019t end up materializing. Listening to the bedtime routine, she had the same thought she\u2019d had her first night at Cobie\u2019s, that a house where kids lived felt full even when the kids were out of sight, even when their toys were tidied away for the night. There were always whispered footsteps, bedsprings squeaking, doors opening and closing, faucets turned on and off. When these kids got older and had more freedom, they\u2019d show up from school with their friends in tow, their bodies suddenly too big, their bikes abandoned to the front lawn, and like a descending army they\u2019d look through the cabinets, clear out the snacks. Then they\u2019d sit around saying all the obnoxious, self-important things teenagers have been saying since the beginning of time. Later still, they\u2019d pull up in cars, run inside with breezy shouts of where they were going, where they\u2019d been. How lucky for the person listening, to have that energy sweep through. What company to walk in to find all those scuffed bags and worn-out sneakers piled up in the front hall. Even the performance of being annoyed\u2014\u201cClean up your shit!\u201d Siobh\u00e1n often yelled at her kids\u2014had joy at the heart of it, exhausted and fed-up though that joy may be. \u201cMom, you said \u2018shit,\u2019 \u201d one always replied, and Siobh\u00e1n would pull that one to her thickening midsection and hold him tight. On college breaks, all these kids would bring friends home. Someday they\u2019d bring their husbands or wives. Their children. Neil, Siobh\u00e1n, Cobie\u2014they\u2019d have full tables at Thanksgiving for the rest of their lives. Jess could see it, see all of it, including herself, in sort of a split screen, living in an ordered quiet, always turning on the radio for company. I shouldn\u2019t be here, she thought. These people were blanks to her. They moved to different music, were formed by different clay. They were appealing for those differences, she reminded herself\u2014but now that it was time to color them in, color herself in beside them, she couldn\u2019t see how the picture would ever look right. And she wouldn\u2019t be able to do this again. It\u2019s a thought that hit her at some point while she was staying with Cobie, and which she immediately tried to silence. Because if this was real between her and Neil, why would she care about that? Most people got one chance in life, and she was stealing a second. But to use that second chance and end up in a house only three miles from where she started? Why hadn\u2019t she thought bigger, gotten farther? She didn\u2019t have the excuse of being young anymore. Because it was him I met, she remembered. Him I liked. She recalled the strange feeling she got, locking eyes with him from across a room when they barely knew each other\u2019s names, recognizing him, feeling recognized, long before anything happened. A line pulled taut. A tug. A whole life that was hers to step into, if she wanted to. She could hear Neil\u2019s low murmur coming from upstairs, though not what he was saying. She could sneak out now, head back home, beg Malcolm for forgiveness. But whether that made her brave or cowardly depended on what was actually the right thing to do, and that\u2019s the part she couldn\u2019t decide. She could take the flashlight she\u2019d spotted in Neil\u2019s mudroom and make her way back along the ruts and inclines of the roads she knew so well until she arrived at her own door and apologized for trying something new. A new backdrop, new rooms to move through. A new way of being touched, looked at\u2014that was part of it, too. As she listened to him soothing one of the kids, she pictured the long walk home, how she\u2019d rehearse her apology. But then even in her mind she stopped walking. The bouncing light stilled. She was at the exact point in the road where kids used to crawl through a broken section of the chain-link fence to find a sheltered spot to drink beers, to make out in the mossy patches between the trees. She was also not sorry for trying. For feeling a way and doing something about it. She had a problem and she was trying to solve it. And anyway, she couldn\u2019t leave. Neil had already carried her bag upstairs, and she\u2019d already taken out her hairbrush, left her toiletries case on the sink. She\u2019d already emptied her pockets of change, put it in the kids\u2019 change jar. Next thing Neil was back downstairs, searching a drawer for menus, and from across the room he looked like a stranger to her, as if she\u2019d met him not ten minutes before. \u201cLet\u2019s order dinner,\u201d he was saying. \u201cYour first night. Let\u2019s open a bottle of wine. Hey,\u201d he said, coming over to her. \u201cI\u2019m really happy you\u2019re here.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t keep her thoughts on track. \u201cHey,\u201d he repeated, so that she\u2019d look at him. \u201cEverything is going to be okay.\u201d \u201cThey say once a cheater always a cheater,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you know that?\u201d \u201cDo you count this as cheating?\u201d he asked. \u201cJess, this is not wrong, and I\u2019ll never be convinced otherwise.\u201d She liked him best when he said things like that, when he was insistent about it and seemed absolutely sure. The next morning the kids said hello when they padded into the kitchen, but wore puzzled expressions, like they were just remembering, Oh yes, that\u2019s the stranger who arrived yesterday and is still here, pouring our milk into her coffee. \n eight His whole life, he\u2019d had good luck. Hadn\u2019t he? \u201cWell aren\u2019t you the luckiest boy!\u201d his mother said to him in August 1987, shaking him for joy when he found a twenty-dollar bill not once but twice in a single month. He remembered the moment because what she said felt so true. Of all boys, he\u2019d been chosen. Ordained. Picked by fortune. Two twenties, just three weeks apart. What were the chances? There were dozens of kids his age who biked around town all day, but he was the only one who\u2019d spotted that folded bill on the grass beside the bandstand, and then, on a different Friday, another, folded almost exactly the same way, on the sidewalk outside Buster Brown. His father asked him if he mugged two different people or the same guy twice. His mother told him to put the money in his sock drawer for a rainy day, but he was afraid if he kept it she\u2019d get ideas about spending it on something practical. So instead of waiting around for her to tell him he was in charge of buying his own notebooks and pencils that school year, he marched every kid in the neighborhood up to Two Scoops and bought a round of ice creams. Siblings tagged along, which he hadn\u2019t expected or calculated. He didn\u2019t want to leave anyone out, so he ended up pedaling full speed back to his house to beg his mother for $1.75 or else he didn\u2019t know what would happen. She said no at first, let it be a lesson to him, what a fool, treating the entire neighborhood when his father was busting his hump and the propane tank needed filling. But the kids had already started licking their cones! He couldn\u2019t exactly return them! \u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d his mother said, furious, peeling two dollars from the fold that lived in the blue cookie tin over the fridge. \u201cYou mean to tell me you got one, too?\u201d she said to him not fifteen minutes later, when he came cruising down the dead center of the block on his BMX, the soggy end of a cone in his hand. \u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t going to leave myself out!\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my money.\u201d \u201cAnd sprinkles?\u201d she said, eyeing his T-shirt. He shrugged. Another time, when he was even younger, the Gephardts went to the Jersey Shore for a few days. They usually rented a house in the Catskills for a long weekend every summer\u2014Malcolm and Mary played with the kids of their parents\u2019 friends from the Bronx, while the adults played cards and told loud stories that ended up with drinks rocking off tables and glasses shattering on the floor. But his dad had struck up a friendship with a guy who owned a motel in Margate, on the Jersey Shore, and Malcolm overheard him tell his mother that he liked that it was close to Atlantic City in case he got bored sitting on the beach. On their third day there, Malcolm woke up very early, odd to have his entire family sleeping in the same room, so he decided to go for a swim despite the warning sign outside the manager\u2019s office, despite his mother\u2019s cautioning that the ocean was not the town pool. The motel\u2019s floating dock looked so close, hardly a risk, and he\u2019d watched people swim back and forth the previous afternoon. If it really was rough he could always turn around. He wasn\u2019t scared at the time, but since then the feeling he had that day sometimes returned to him without warning: having to fight for a full breath, feeling his body pulled by some mysterious force, glancing at where he\u2019d come from and then ahead at where he was going, unable to decide whether to push forward or go back, and all the while knowing that the longer he took to choose the more precious energy he wasted. The landline in the bar rang, cutting through the silence and jolting him back to the present. Malcolm staggered up from his arrangement of chairs and pressed his palm to his chest to stop his heart from pounding. \u201cAnd what did you decide?\u201d Jess asked, when he first told her the ocean story. That vacation was the only time he could remember his father wearing a bathing suit. His sister was embarrassed because the bathing suit was almost the exact same color as their father\u2019s skin, and from far away he looked naked. Jess laughed, said her father must have had the same one, said she remembered wanting to die the one and only time he came to the town pool. They were in bed, somewhat new to each other still, the windows wide open, a humid summer afternoon. They\u2019d been lying there for hours, telling stories about growing up. Jess\u2019s family had had less than the Gephardts. There were ways to tell. Which sports a kid played. Whether a kid had birthday parties at McDonald\u2019s or whether all the photos were of their siblings crammed around their own kitchen table, a defrosted Sara Lee in the tinfoil pan. Her family wasn\u2019t poor, Jess was always quick to say. There were a lot of kids who had less. Something about the smell of a storm in the air made him remember that swim he took at ten or eleven years old. \u201cWhat happened? Did you end up swimming to the dock or did you turn back?\u201d \u201cNeither,\u201d Malcolm said. An old man zoomed up to him in a motorboat, reached out a hand, and heaved Malcolm on board. He scolded him over the buzz of the motor until they reached shore. Back at the beach, the man bought him a fountain soda from the crab shack, told him to use his head. \u201cSo I lived, plus I got a soda,\u201d he bragged to Jess. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t have to make a choice,\u201d Jess said, and seemed troubled. He never understood why that was such a thing for her. He was rescued because he was always going to be rescued, was his point, and by that logic had never really been in danger. She seemed to consider it a sign of something else, and only now, in the silence of the bar, the ringing phone calling attention to the silence, did her point move into slightly clearer focus. He was surprised he slept that deeply. He was surprised he slept at all. The sound of the boat was almost identical to the noise of the generator running in the alley beside the bar all night, and Malcolm\u2019s brain made the link out of the most delicate filament, where it became briefly incandescent and then broke. It must have run out of gas at some point just before dawn. The heater was cold to the touch. By the phone\u2019s third ring he\u2019d shaken off every dark thought and was in work mode, all business. He slipped through the swinging door quickly, to keep the warm air trapped in the kitchen, and the cold of the main room felt like stepping outside. He\u2019d taken off his boots to sleep, and the feel of the hex mat under his socks was like a massage. Who could be calling the landline? Jess. Patrick. His mother. He should have checked on his mother on Saturday. Now it was Monday. He hoped she had enough wood stacked beside the slider on her deck. He hoped she hadn\u2019t had to wade through the snow to the pile in the backyard. What if she slipped and fell out there? He had to get over there as soon as he could. \u201cHalf Moon,\u201d he said when he picked up, in the same harried tone as always, as if there were a dozen hands reaching for him. \u201cMalcolm Gephardt?\u201d a woman\u2019s voice asked. \u201cYeah?\u201d It was an officer from the local police department, but he didn\u2019t catch her name. She and her partner had been by his house already, trying to track him down. They wanted to ask him a few questions about a patron. Would he still be there in ten minutes if they came by? When the police cruiser pulled up, he expected Rob Waggoner to be one of the two officers, but instead it was Jackie Becker with an officer he didn\u2019t recognize. Jackie was the youngest sister of a friend of his from high school. She used to come to their baseball games and run after the foul balls. Whenever he spoke to her back then, she would blush a deep violet. He hadn\u2019t seen her in years. She and her partner were both in uniform and both looked exhausted. \u201cHey, Jackie,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cWas that you on the phone? You should have said.\u201d \u201cHi, Malcolm.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d remember me.\u201d \u201cI thought you worked in the city. How\u2019s Tom? Still down in DC?\u201d \u201cI transferred up here last year. Yeah, he\u2019s good. Three kids. I\u2019ll tell him you were asking.\u201d Malcolm stuck his hand out to the other officer. \u201cOfficer Navarro,\u201d the man said. \u201cSo,\u201d Jackie said as she reached up and straightened the Hennessy sign by the door. \u201cWhat can you tell us about Charles Waggoner? We heard Rob filled you in a little.\u201d \u201cHe hasn\u2019t turned up yet?\u201d Malcolm was surprised. He figured Tripp would have shown up one way or another by then, that he\u2019d either found his way home or been discovered somewhere between there and the Half Moon. If he\u2019d attempted the walk home on Friday night, he might have stopped for a rest, fallen asleep like drunk people tended to do. And then the snow, the extreme cold that followed. It wasn\u2019t a bad way to go, really. There was also the creek that ran along Jefferson, the water moving fast under the surface ice. A body had been fished out when Malcolm was in ninth grade, and he was certain that every person his age who grew up in Gillam could name the place they were when that news went out. They\u2019d played in that creek all summer. \u201cNo, and we really need to track him down before this next storm gets here,\u201d she said. \u201cOne more biggie and then spring,\u201d Officer Navarro said. \u201cNext thing the tulips will be pushing through.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s March for you,\u201d Jackie said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard that,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cAbout another storm. My phone\u2019s dead.\u201d \u201cTomorrow, supposedly,\u201d Jackie said. \u201cThey might be wrong. It doesn\u2019t have that smell, if you ask me. You know how you can smell snow coming?\u201d A Tuesday storm would be better than another Friday storm. He needed to be up and running by Thursday, latest. He had a birthday party coming in. Plus the rolling St. Patrick\u2019s Day parades that took up most of March\u2014Hoboken, Jersey City, Woodlawn\u2014would mean people returning to Gillam and going for a drink in town. The rowdy groups opened tabs, stayed for hours. He had a band scheduled for Saturday night. They were probably awful but they\u2019d agreed to play for drinks and tips. March was usually his best month. Malcolm told the officers more or less the same things he told Rob the day before, that Tripp had gotten drunk, cooled out in the kitchen, walked off. They took Emma\u2019s and Roddy\u2019s names. He went to the kitchen to get his phone so he could give them their numbers, forgetting it was dead. They asked if he knew the names of any of the people Tripp had been arguing with, but Malcolm didn\u2019t. \u201cWhat\u2019s upstairs?\u201d Jackie asked. She looked at the ceiling. \u201cYou ever hang out here, Jackie? I\u2019ve never seen you.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been here in years. I like going to Riverside or into the city. That new place on Oak is nice. Have you been?\u201d \u201cNope,\u201d Malcolm said, and pulled on his tight shoulder. \u201cWell anyway, there\u2019s nothing up there. Odds and ends. I thought I\u2019d use it as an office, but I really don\u2019t need one. There\u2019s a door from the sidewalk, or a staircase in the back, if you walk past the men\u2019s.\u201d Malcolm pointed. \u201cYou never had a renter or anything?\u201d \u201cNo. Thought about it, but I\u2019d need to renovate, put in a full bath and a kitchenette.\u201d And who in the world would want to live above a bar? They\u2019d have to soundproof it, bring it to residential code. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of opening a wall, having outdoor space, a rooftop bar. You can see the lake from up there.\u201d He watched for their reaction. Jackie turned her face north and tilted her head. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it overlook the commuter lot?\u201d \u201cThere are things you can do about that. Decorative things.\u201d But she\u2019d already lost interest. \u201cYou mind if we look around up there?\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d Malcolm said, and then apologized for having to lead them back outside to the door that led upstairs. A policy leftover from Hugh\u2019s time; they kept the interior door to the second floor locked so that people didn\u2019t sneak up when the bar was full. Upstairs, the light was brighter. The walls were scuffed and the floor was pitched badly, needed to be leveled. But there was something cheerful about it, something promising. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d Officer Navarro asked. Malcolm was across the room, imagining the wall gone, some sort of wood trellis to prevent a person from looking left. \u201cIs someone staying here?\u201d Malcolm turned to see what he was talking about. There in the corner of the room closest to the door they\u2019d entered through was a duffel bag, and next to it, a short stack of clothes, neatly folded. A phone charger. Two battered paperbacks. A clip-on book light. A camp mattress, rolled up into a cylinder. A sleeping bag. As a group they moved toward the tiny bathroom and looked in. There was a cup on the windowsill that held a single toothbrush and a travel-sized tube of toothpaste. Deodorant. A striped towel hung from the doorknob. \u201cWhose stuff is this?\u201d Navarro asked, looking at him carefully. Malcolm shrugged, astonished. For some reason his first thought was of Jess. But if it was her stuff, there\u2019d be the face wash she liked. There\u2019d be her floral makeup case. She didn\u2019t wear men\u2019s deodorant, mountain fresh scent. \u201cSomeone\u2019s definitely staying here,\u201d Jackie said, looking at Malcolm. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d \u201cNo idea,\u201d Malcolm said, glad he didn\u2019t have to lie but also feeling a strong sense of trouble looming. They stood over the duffel bag. There were two boxes of peanut butter protein bars. Jackie picked up a sweatshirt, held it so they could all read what was written across the front: \u201cFall Classic,\u201d a drawing of a fish underneath. One of the books was a spy novel and the other a guidebook of sorts: Alone: How to Break Free of the Grid. Navarro picked up Alone, flipped it open. \u201c \u2018Dig a well before you\u2019re thirsty,\u2019 \u201d he read aloud. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a warrant?\u201d Malcolm asked, and immediately wanted to kick himself. He sounded defensive, but really he just wanted to make sure they did everything right because if they didn\u2019t, it would end up becoming his problem. Both officers looked up. \u201cNah,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cIf Charles Waggoner wants to jet off to the South Pole or wherever, that\u2019s his business. We just want to feel pretty sure that\u2019s what happened.\u201d \u201cFor his wife\u2019s sake,\u201d Jackie added. \u201cThe family is wondering.\u201d \u201cTrespassing is a crime, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Malcolm asked. \u201cYeah,\u201d Jackie said in a tone that said, Not really. \u201cYou\u2019re certain he was on his own on Friday night?\u201d Navarro asked. Malcolm shrugged. He wasn\u2019t certain about anything anymore. \u201cWho else might be staying here?\u201d Jackie asked. \u201cSomeone on your staff maybe?\u201d Malcolm ticked through his staff face by face. He paused on Roddy for a moment, always broke, always disheveled, but he moved on. \u201cI\u2019m just confused. Why would he need to stay here? He has a house.\u201d Jackie looked at Navarro and he shrugged as if to say, Go ahead. \u201cRob found an itinerary for Toronto in his father\u2019s email, early Saturday morning departure. Or rather, Rob\u2019s mother found it, showed Rob. That\u2019s when he looped us in.\u201d \u201cSaturday morning as in two days ago? I would think flights were canceled. How\u2019d he even get to the airport?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cPlanes get above the weather pretty quickly. Getting to the airport would have been hard but not impossible. We confirmed the flight took off from Newark at 7:35 Saturday morning and he purchased a seat several weeks ago. We also confirmed that he checked in, but anyone can check in remotely, so it doesn\u2019t tell us all that much. Maybe he went straight from here Friday night and slept at the airport. We\u2019re waiting for the passenger list. That\u2019ll tell us if he was actually on board. There was also a bunch of stuff in his search history about a village in Peru.\u201d He pronounced the name of the village slowly, syllable by syllable. \u201cOllantaytambo. Rob said Tripp and his mother went there once, years ago. His father\u2019s been obsessed with it ever since.\u201d \u201cHe told me about that place,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cSo Rob\u2019s thinking Canada might just be a rest stop,\u201d Jackie said. \u201cThat\u2019s assuming he made it as far as the nearest traffic light,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cYou checked the snowbanks between here and his house?\u201d \u201cLooking into all possibilities,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s been another development that\u2019s sort of interesting,\u201d Jackie said. \u201cHe changed his life insurance beneficiary, about eighteen months ago. The beneficiary is now a person named Mark Duro. You ever hear that name? All the people who come through the bar? We figure if anyone would know him you would.\u201d The name didn\u2019t ring a bell. \u201cCould be a fake name, right?\u201d \u201cCould be.\u201d \u201cI still don\u2019t get why he\u2019d have his stuff up here.\u201d He pictured Tripp brushing his teeth, settling in for the night. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cWhy stay here? He lives on Acorn. Big house. It\u2019s not that far.\u201d He walked to the window, peered down at the street. \u201cHe takes the train to work every day. His wife said he\u2019d been coming home every night until Friday, unless he\u2019s out of town for business. He\u2019d been having trouble at work, was really stressed out. She didn\u2019t think much of it until he never got home Friday night.\u201d Malcolm thought of a regular from Hugh\u2019s era, an old-timer everyone called Mr. Met who used to spend his days bouncing from the deli to the library to the OTB to the Half Moon, because if his wife saw him sitting down in the middle of the day, she\u2019d come up with something for him to do. \u201cMaybe this was his daytime spot. A place to be instead of the office. Are you sure he\u2019s been going to work?\u201d The officers looked at each other. \u201cI can call,\u201d Navarro said. With music on, the bar was loud even when it was empty. A person staying up there could move about freely without a worry of being heard. They would have to be careful at opening, Malcolm moving through the quiet, getting ready for another day. Any unusual creak of a floorboard and he would have noticed. Was Tripp listening when he negotiated with his suppliers last week? Had he been eavesdropping when Malcolm called the bank for a third time to ask about a line of credit, and then how did he interpret the silence on Malcolm\u2019s end when the loan officer explained equity to Malcolm like he was a five-year-old? \u201cWill you be here later? Or tomorrow?\u201d Jackie asked. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to get back in at some point.\u201d \u201cDepends on this next storm. I have to run a couple errands and I have to check on my mother.\u201d As he was talking, he was making his way to the staircase at the far end of the room, the one that led down to the bar. He jogged down and went to unbolt the door, but it was already unlocked. \u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d Malcolm said. He opened the door, stepped through. \u201cThis door has been locked for years.\u201d He turned to face the officers standing at the top of the stairs. \u201cMaybe he came and went through the interior door when the bar was full,\u201d Navarro suggested. The bar was rarely that crowded, Malcolm thought, especially not during the day. Someone would surely have noticed if a guy went down the hall to the men\u2019s and never returned. He pictured the money lying around in the mornings sometimes, if he was counting out payments. He pictured all the bottles left out when deliveries were made. He was short a bottle of Jameson around Christmas and he thought it odd, figured one of the delivery guys had nabbed it. He lined up all the bottles along the bar, thinking he\u2019d missed it, checked the lineup against the packing list, but then he\u2019d just let it go, figured the delivery guys were in as bad a shape as he was and it was Christmas. Then he remembered the clean pile of undershirts just sitting there in the men\u2019s room cabinet the night before, how he hadn\u2019t even questioned it. The men\u2019s room downstairs was a lot bigger than the tiny bathroom upstairs, and a man of Tripp\u2019s size would need space to clean himself. \u201cYou might as well come down this way,\u201d Malcolm called up to them but Navarro said no way, said it was bad luck to leave a place by a different door. So Malcolm left the door unlocked, went back up, and exited with the cops by way of the street stairs. \u201cIf I\u2019m not here, you can always let yourselves in,\u201d he said when they reached the sidewalk. He hoped they were noticing how cooperative he was being. \u201cThis door seems locked but it\u2019s actually just jammed. If you shove hard, it\u2019ll open.\u201d He lowered his shoulder and rammed it against the door to demonstrate. As he did, it occurred to him that Tripp might have figured that out. \u201cBetter if you\u2019re here, though,\u201d Jackie said. \u201cSure, okay,\u201d Malcolm agreed. \u201cHey, can you guys give me a lift home?\u201d Malcolm grabbed the empty gas canister, his phone, the cash pouch, and hurried to the backseat of the cruiser. Sitting inside the warm car, he noticed how cold he was, pinpricks of pain at his fingertips, his toes. He hoped his mother had a fire going. He hoped she had the sense to close the living room door and trap the heat, to sleep on the couch down there. He needed to get his car out of his driveway, no matter what it took. He had too many stops to make. He needed to charge his phone. He needed to refill the generator, get that space heater going again. The roads were better than they\u2019d been twenty-four hours earlier, and there was movement about, the occasional car, kids playing despite the bitter cold. He noticed lights on here and there. \u201cIs the power back?\u201d he asked. \u201cSome blocks but not many. And it\u2019ll be tricky with more snow coming. They\u2019re saying another foot, minimum.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not too cold to snow?\u201d The officers looked at each other. \u201cWe were just talking about that. Is that a real thing?\u201d All three shrugged. At home, he went directly upstairs, stripped, dipped a washcloth in the cold water he\u2019d collected in the tub, and rubbed his face roughly, brushed his teeth. As he did he thought of Tripp off the grid somewhere, squatting next to a campfire, perhaps, until he figured out how to live. Next Malcolm pictured Tripp stiff as a board, dead since Friday night. Either way he had no worries about roofs leaking or pipes bursting. No worries about a mortgage or filing quarterly tax estimates or where he and his wife were in their health insurance deductible or getting his car inspected or cutting the stupid lawn and getting the edges just so. No worries about Hugh Lydon and getting a payment to him month after month after month. Once he was dressed in fresh clothes, Malcolm went to the window and looked at the sky, wondered what muted parts of a person\u2019s DNA were possible to reawaken given the right circumstances. Life was ticking by, day by day, and it was dawning on him lately that the distance between his present life and his future was getting shorter every minute. Malcolm\u2019s grandfather in Galway had been able to smell rain a day away, could probably tell by the particular shade of the sun what weather was coming across the meadows and fields, but Malcolm had lost all that, had never been taught how to look for these things, had never known how to live any life but the one he was born to. Had Tripp really been drunk on Friday? Malcolm was almost certain it was no performance, but maybe this guy was that good. He must have been sober to have disappeared so completely, to have gracefully slipped away into a window so narrow that he\u2019d have to have very steady hands to pull it off. Brilliant, really, when Malcolm thought about it. He wished he knew the whole plan. Maybe even the fight he\u2019d gotten into was designed so that everyone would remember he\u2019d been there, would swear to it should it ever come up when the police came knocking. It felt urgent to dig out his car. He rebundled, walked over to the Colemans\u2019 garage to take back the same shovel he\u2019d returned on Saturday. It felt a little warmer than it had earlier, not quite as bitter, or else he was getting used to it. He started his car to let it warm up as he worked, set his phone on the charger. He hacked and hacked and pried plates of ice from the surface, tossed them to the street piece by piece. When he finally cleared enough to get his car out, he sat in the driver\u2019s seat and saw that his phone had come to life. Four times, Jess\u2019s name appeared on his screen. More texts: his mother, Emma, Patrick, his mother again, Andr\u00e9, a local number he didn\u2019t recognize. He read all of them and purposely skipped Jess\u2019s, saving hers for last. Emma and Andr\u00e9 wanted to know if power was back on in Gillam, when they should report to work. His mother wanted to tell him she had plenty of food in her fridge if he wanted some of it and that Mr. Sheridan had cleared her driveway. Patrick wanted him to come for dinner, said he had a bottle of scotch they could open. The unfamiliar number was Rob Waggoner, to tell him some police officers might be coming around. Finally, he tapped Jess\u2019s name. You home? I\u2019m stopping by Are you in there? Your car is here. Ok I\u2019m going He looked up. She\u2019d been there while he was gone. He got out of the car and stood there, imagining where exactly she\u2019d walked, what path she\u2019d taken. He imagined her opening the door of their house, stepping inside. She\u2019d been in there and he hadn\u2019t even sensed it. \u201cJess,\u201d he said aloud. \u201cMalcolm,\u201d a voice responded, and Malcolm wheeled around to find Hugh\u2019s guy Billy standing behind him in a jacket too light for the weather, a flat cap pulled low over a gaunt face. \u201cJesus,\u201d Malcolm said, and out of habit almost went to shake his hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s the story?\u201d Billy asked Malcolm, as if he\u2019d just come by to shoot the breeze. Malcolm steeled himself. He was tempted to make fun of the guy. His whole look seemed copied from a bad movie. \u201cWhat do you want, Billy?\u201d Billy laughed. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d \u201cYeah, tell Hugh it\u2019ll be all good in a few weeks.\u201d \u201cBy this weekend.\u201d \u201cThis weekend?\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cThat\u2019s a joke. Look around. Nothing\u2019s moving. And there\u2019s another storm coming.\u201d Billy reached for his pocket and Malcolm swallowed, felt his whole body tense up. But Billy only drew out a pack of cigarettes, followed by a long search in the other pocket for a lighter. \u201cWhere is he anyway? I tried calling him. I\u2019d like to talk to him.\u201d \u201cYou left messages?\u201d \u201cYes, but if you\u2019d let him know, I\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d Billy smirked. \u201cSure.\u201d \u201cBecause what I want to know is why\u2019d he go to so much trouble talking me into buying the place if he knew how it would go. He knew about the new place opening on Oak. There\u2019s no way he didn\u2019t. He knew the vendors wouldn\u2019t grandfather me into those old contracts. He said we\u2019d work it out, not to worry about it, but then he comes up with an interest rate that\u2019s impossible to get ahead of? What\u2019s the point?\u201d Billy shrugged. \u201cThe only reason he\u2019s been as patient as he\u2019s been is because of how far back you go. But his patience has a limit.\u201d \u201cYou know, we didn\u2019t sign anything,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cI have a letter that says the money was a gift. Free and clear. I could stop paying him right now and there\u2019s not a thing he could do about it.\u201d Malcolm followed Billy\u2019s gaze to the little house, top to bottom, how cozy it looked capped in snow. Of course there were things Hugh could do about it. \u201cWe started around the same time,\u201d Billy said. \u201cStarted what?\u201d \u201cWorking for Hugh. I started and then a few weeks later there you were.\u201d Malcolm hadn\u2019t realized that. Billy seemed like a guy who was born the age he was now, in the clothes he was wearing. When Malcolm started at the Half Moon, he remembered seeing Billy along with Hugh\u2019s other guys and thinking they\u2019d all worked for him forever. \u201cHe put me on his other jobs but he put you in the bar.\u201d His point was there somewhere, but Malcolm couldn\u2019t pin it down. \u201cDid you hear what happened to Pete Spear?\u201d Billy asked. Pete Spear, town manager, had come by the bar maybe four times in a short period, looking for Hugh. He wanted to catch him for a sec, he said to Malcolm the last time he was in. He just wanted to talk. Malcolm wondered if the guy was losing it a little, how many times had he explained that Hugh didn\u2019t own the place anymore. \u201cGot mugged I heard,\u201d Billy said. \u201cBeat up pretty bad. In Midtown. Lost sight in one eye.\u201d They both squinted into the glare that rose off the surface of the snow. Back in his car after Billy drove away, Malcolm took deep breaths. He cupped his hands over the heating vents. He tried counting to a hundred but he kept losing his place. He used to ask himself what he was going to do, but the question was too large, and had no answer, so at some point he decided to just get through each day. The days would add up to weeks, weeks to months, and maybe everything would be fine. But it looked as if that plan would not work after all. He scrolled through his contacts and tried calling Hugh again. No answer. The main road was crunchy with sand and salt, but the side streets were slippery, and Malcolm could feel the wheels of his car losing traction. He drove to his mother\u2019s first, felt relief at the sight of the perfect boxed cuts Mr. Sheridan\u2019s snowblower had made along her driveway. She tried to get him to stay, and when she saw he wouldn\u2019t settle, she suggested she tag along with him, help at the bar and keep him company. \u201cMa, no,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cJust keep the house warm.\u201d \u201cWell, you should sleep here tonight at least. I have the fireplace.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t. But I\u2019ll come back.\u201d \u201cIs everything okay? Besides the weather, I mean. Besides Jess.\u201d \u201cYeah, everything\u2019s fine,\u201d he said as he imagined Jess showing up at the house again. Four texts in a row was something. Four texts in a row was more than he\u2019d gotten in months. So she knew she had some explaining to do. If she did show up at the house again, he wanted to be there. \u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cGo. Darren will be\u2014\u201d She stopped speaking so abruptly that he looked up. \u201cWhat were you going to say?\u201d Malcolm asked. He left Billy and Hugh and the Half Moon and Tripp Waggoner and even Jess outside in the cold for a moment. \u201cSomething about Dad?\u201d She looked at him as if he were the one who\u2019d confused things. \u201cI\u2019m calling Mary. They didn\u2019t get one flake of snow in Boston. Can you believe it?\u201d Malcolm waited until he heard his sister\u2019s voice on the line, and then he shouted hello from the background. He told his mother that he was taking the empty gas can out of her garage because he needed a second. A few minutes later, taking turns slowly, he made his way to the gas station and filled both canisters. Then he rolled along Seneca to the Half Moon. The fa\u00e7ade looked damp and forlorn, badly in need of new shingles. There were thick icicles hanging from the roofline. He pictured one breaking off and impaling a passerby. The place needed so many things\u2014new gutters, a whole new roof, the list was too long, and if he stopped paying attention for even one day, it grew longer. He looked up at the second floor windows and imagined someone looking down at him. None of the other businesses had bothered clearing their sidewalks, not with the power still out and another storm coming on the heels of the last. Power was on at the bank. He asked the teller to write his balance on the receipt. Outside, he looked once and then tore it into a dozen pieces. He\u2019d have to ask his mother for a loan. He had no choice. He\u2019d get it back to her on a payment plan somehow. No one could ever know. Not Mary, not his friends, not Jess, not anyone. She had to have more than social security and her little salary from the school district. She should see a doctor, he knew. A specialist. He\u2019d called her regular doctor a few weeks ago to ask what he recommended, but that doctor hadn\u2019t thought much of what Malcolm described. She was forgetful at times, sure, but she was seventy-two. Malcolm searched on the internet, but it led him nowhere except to wonder what exactly a doctor could do for her anyway. There was no medicine that would help long-term. Everything he read online about signs of memory loss\u2014or not loss, exactly, more like confusion\u2014all had to do with prevention. A diet and exercise program she should have been on since she was thirty. Aside from the bank, nowhere seemed to be open except Food King, a smattering of cars in the lot. Casually, without realizing he was doing it, he looked for shoes sticking out of the snow, looked for any lumps that might be shaped like a human man. He slowed as he passed the bus shelter, the long bench that might appeal to a person staggering home late at night in bad weather. He looked carefully at the clutter of cans and bins and stored landscaping equipment behind the mechanic\u2019s shop. The door of the Salvation Army bin was warped. Had anyone checked in there? He left the car running in the middle of the street and walked over, peered inside. He pictured Tripp sleeping peacefully, tucked into a pile of old winter coats and sweaters, but the bin was empty. The traffic lights had all been switched to flashing yellows. The trains weren\u2019t running, the signals still out. He drove slowly past the library, and then, seeing a half-buried realtor sign advertising an open house, he remembered something from a few years before. He kept driving toward the edge of town, where the houses were set farther apart, and then turned toward the busy road that separated one small part of Gillam from the rest. It was a vague memory, but it was growing sharper in his mind. A few years before, Patrick had looked at a house over in the new development, and made Malcolm come with him. \u201cFifteen minutes,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cTops. Just a little detour.\u201d They were on their way to a golf course in Westchester to celebrate their buddy\u2019s fortieth, but first Patrick wanted to walk through an open house, get a quick look at the place for his college friend, to see if it was worth his friend driving from the city to check out. \u201cNasty divorce,\u201d Patrick explained that day. He told Malcolm to stay in the car if he wanted, no need to come in, but Malcolm followed anyway and stood patiently aside as Patrick peppered the realtor with questions. He followed Patrick up the stairs and down the hall as he glanced into bedrooms, opened closet doors. \u201cYour friend has this kind of money?\u201d Malcolm asked as they were walking back to Patrick\u2019s car. The house was huge and expensive, the area it was in far nicer than any other section of town. Divorces were expensive, too, but apparently this friend could afford both. \u201cYeah,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cBut he\u2019s a good guy. I guess I\u2019ve always talked this place up. Gillam, I mean. He\u2019s curious. And he has to decide pretty quick because of school and everything. They\u2019re in the city now. The kids are in private school. So it\u2019ll be a big change.\u201d It was a habit they\u2019d inherited from their parents, the second half of the sentence laid out in opposition to the first. He had money but he was a good guy. To both admire money, want it, and be suspicious of it, too. To consider anyone with money a species slightly different from their own. Anyone in their crew could make a billion, but they\u2019d still understand what it meant to worry. It was present in them no matter where they ended up, just the same as their eye color, their height; the patina of a childhood made up of hand-me-down sneakers and overhearing their parents discuss layoffs, strikes; buying the expiration day meat and their mothers saying it was fine as long as it was cooked to well-done. When people were raised without that worry, you could feel it just by standing near them; something about the way they spoke and moved. It couldn\u2019t be learned. \u201cHe won\u2019t want to be in the suburbs, though, will he?\u201d Malcolm had asked at the time. \u201cNewly single?\u201d \u201cHe got the kids,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cAh,\u201d Malcolm said, and immediately imagined Jess calling him out for something, his old-fashioned assumption that the wife always got the kids. \u201cBut why Gillam? If I had this kind of money, I\u2019d get one of those sick houses on the water in Mamaroneck.\u201d They were still within the bounds of Azalea Estates, Patrick driving slowly so they could look at every house, every yard. There were no weeds, not a single sprig of boxwood that rose up above the rest. \u201cYou? No you wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019d stay right here. And anyway, what do you mean? Gillam\u2019s a great town. You don\u2019t like it here?\u201d \u201cI really don\u2019t know whether I like it or not. It\u2019s just home.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d get it if you had kids,\u201d Patrick said. Sometimes Malcolm knew what Jess meant about people being smug when it came to their families. Malcolm shrugged. \u201cI get it. Even without kids.\u201d \u201cI know you do.\u201d Patrick glanced at him as he put his blinker on and turned. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t know why I said that. Is that stuff, you know, the doctors, you and Jess\u2014\u201d \u201cNah, we\u2019re done.\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d Patrick nodded. \u201cAnd you\u2019re good with that?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Malcolm shifted in his seat. \u201cI mean. The last time\u2014\u201d \u201cI know. That was really tough. You guys were stoked. Everyone was.\u201d \u201cYeah. Jess is struggling.\u201d Patrick frowned, kept his eyes on the road. \u201cSiobh\u00e1n said something about adoption maybe? Are you guys thinking about that?\u201d \u201cJess has brought it up a few times, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s all that serious. She sort of raised the idea and then dropped it. It would take years and we\u2019ve already put in so many years. At one point maybe I\u2019d have considered it, but now? I\u2019m just tired. I need a break. We need to move on.\u201d \u201cI get it. You feel how you feel. When Siobh\u00e1n was pregnant with Jack, it was as if she completely loved him as soon as she got pregnant and kinda got mad at me that I didn\u2019t. I said I did but she knew. It took until meeting each one of them if I\u2019m being honest, and sometimes a little longer. So assuming Jess is more like Siobh\u00e1n, I guess what I\u2019m saying is that she\u2019s going through something slightly different, losing this baby.\u201d They turned onto the main road. \u201cBut what do I know?\u201d Patrick asked after a mile or so. \u201cI was never in your position. I can\u2019t imagine going through what you guys have been through.\u201d Malcolm nodded. He\u2019d been through it, too, not just Jess. He felt a heaviness pressing in on them and didn\u2019t want to ruin the day they\u2019d been looking forward to. \u201cI\u2019d probably get a weird one anyway,\u201d he said, trying to lighten things a bit. Patrick smiled. \u201cYou\u2019d get one who can\u2019t keep his finger out of his nose. Or who can\u2019t stop fiddling with himself in school.\u201d \u201cRemember David Hoyle?\u201d Malcolm said, and they both cracked up. David Hoyle had been in school with them until fourth grade, and then switched schools halfway through the year under mysterious circumstances. He used to press down on his crotch with both hands when Miss McConaughey walked up the aisle. None of their mothers would ever explain why he left so abruptly. \u201cJack told me this morning that he can\u2019t be in the kitchen when I\u2019m eating because my chewing is gross,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cHe told me it sounds like a swamp in my mouth. Can you imagine saying that to your father? Can you imagine what would happen? But that\u2019s the way it is now.\u201d \u201cAnd you have good ones! I mean, they\u2019re normal. More or less.\u201d \u201cDepends on the hour.\u201d \u201cToby\u2019s kid is pretty odd, right? That middle one?\u201d Malcolm pulled a face that mimicked Toby\u2019s second son\u2019s expression whenever he interrupted the adults. \u201cOh my God,\u201d Patrick said, taking quick glances at Malcolm\u2019s impression as he merged onto the highway. \u201cHow have I never seen this before? Mal! You know what? That kid\u2019s eleven years old and has yet to flush a toilet in my house. Unreal.\u201d Malcolm did his impression of the kid\u2019s face once more, and Patrick laughed so hard the car swerved. \u201cHe deuced on our trampoline when he was maybe seven. Did I ever tell you that? I didn\u2019t, right? Siobh\u00e1n said not to. Why do I listen to her? She made me clean it up and told me to pretend to myself it was the dog and never tell anyone.\u201d Malcolm laughed so hard he felt beads of sweat spring up under his collar. It was a beautiful spring day, perfect for golfing, perfect for a beer outside, what did it matter that they all stunk at golf, it was just an excuse to be together. Jess was so miserable, absolutely gutted, and he was heartbroken for her, but he just wasn\u2019t as sad. He wasn\u2019t, and he couldn\u2019t pretend he was. He didn\u2019t see the sense. He was relieved that they were finally moving on. They were still young. There was time to make a good life with each other. All around him, in every part of his life, he saw pretty good fortune. And the day before him was one reason why. Hour by hour, day by day, it was possible to will oneself into feeling better. \u201cSkip it,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThe bar is your baby anyway.\u201d \u201cOof. Can\u2019t say that to Jess.\u201d \u201cNo. Jesus. Definitely not.\u201d Malcolm didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be able to find the house again. The whole neighborhood looked different in the winter, the velvet green lawns covered in snow. The lots in that section of town were divided precisely, far bigger than in his neighborhood. He made turns as his instincts dictated, and next thing he saw it: Bratton\u2019s car. He pulled all the way into the driveway, which was cleared to a perfect asphalt rectangle and showed exactly zero signs of the weather. A curtain moved in an upstairs window. Let him come outside, Malcolm thought. Let him fucking come outside. In another moment, it was Jess who stepped out, wearing a pair of snow boots he\u2019d never seen before. Her hair up, without makeup, she could have been twenty-five years old. When he just kept staring straight ahead, refusing to look at her or roll down his window, she walked around to the passenger side and opened the door. \u201cHey,\u201d she said, sitting. For some reason she put on her seat belt. \u201cI stopped by. You got my texts?\u201d But he said nothing. He would not make it easier for her. He felt something rise up in him, a choked-off feeling, like all the things he wanted to say were bottlenecked in his sternum. He pushed back from the steering wheel, took a deep breath. He glanced at her quickly\u2014she was pale, far too skinny, purple pockets under her eyes. He imagined how he probably looked to her, after the weekend he\u2019d had. \u201cHow are you?\u201d \u201cFuck you, Jess.\u201d She flinched, looked at her lap. They sat side by side in silence, the car\u2019s engine humming. She should talk first, he decided. Let her come up with something. Let her work for it. But then. \u201cHe knows you\u2019re out here with me?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s okay with that?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. It wasn\u2019t up to a vote, you know?\u201d \u201cNo, I bet it wasn\u2019t. I bet you just went ahead and did whatever you wanted.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d she said, in a tone that said she had a few things to say about that but she\u2019d give him a minute. He imagined barging in, finding Bratton, throwing him through his giant picture window. He didn\u2019t give one shit if the guy\u2019s kids watched him do it. He had twenty people who\u2019d vouch for him, say he\u2019d been on their couch playing Go Fish with their families all day. And Jess. What a liar, what a\u2014But none of the usual words felt right. And it hadn\u2019t felt good, even in his imagination. As soon as she opened Bratton\u2019s front door and stepped outside, he felt most of the rage evaporate, and instead he felt hollow, tired, adrift. There was his girl. She was just standing in a different house. \u201cWhere\u2019s your car?\u201d \u201cIn the city.\u201d \u201cSo? You\u2019re sleeping with him. And what else? Do you love him?\u201d \u201cMalcolm,\u201d she said like a plea, quickly turning her face away from him. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He accepted her answer like a blow. He folded it up and absorbed it and waited a moment to see how it would take. She reached for his hand, squeezed it tight, but he pulled it away. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said again. Two older men walking dogs passed on the street behind them, taking slow, deliberate steps on the ice. Malcolm watched them in the rearview. Hot air blasted from the dashboard vents but his hands refused to warm up. \u201cYou should have seen the bar. You should have seen it on Friday when I pulled up. I knew right away. I just felt it. If I could figure out how to make it like that every night. Or not even! Four nights a week. And it was only half a night, really. We closed before midnight.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d she asked. She was humoring him maybe, but he didn\u2019t care. Her favorite nights in Hugh\u2019s time were the nights when tables and chairs were spontaneously pushed aside to make room for dancing. The bottoms of her feet would get filthy because she always took off her heels, and then after, when they got home, she\u2019d have to lather and rinse them in the tub before she got into bed, before she let him pull her there. \u201cJust put on socks!\u201d he used to plead. Remembering this, he described everything that was still vivid about Friday, and he knew by the way she looked at him that she could see it, that he\u2019d done a good job, that she believed every word. \u201cYou look good, Mal,\u201d she said. \u201cYou look okay.\u201d \u201cYou look awful,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry.\u201d The sky was changing. Still bright blue for the most part, but a line of gray was advancing from the north. The air, which all day had smelled so clean, so dry, like pine and bare branches, now had a faint earthy scent, humidity settling over the land. They shivered at the same time. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you.\u201d He intended to sound disgusted, to let her know where things stood, but the words came out in a near whisper. \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cHow could you? And not a fucking word. I\u2019m waiting here like an idiot for you to come home. Four months. And then to hear about this from someone else. You know how stupid I feel? After all these years. And with Patrick\u2019s friend. Aside from losing you, what\u2019s this going to do to Patrick and me? You just wanted to take everything down with you?\u201d \u201cNo of course I didn\u2019t want that. I wasn\u2019t thinking about Patrick.\u201d \u201cNo you sure weren\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Her face had that stricken look that came just before crying. He was so affable, so easy in so many ways, but if there was one thing he wouldn\u2019t forgive, it was being made to feel stupid. \u201cAnd you know\u2014\u201d It was getting difficult to shape the words; his breath kept getting squeezed into the pocket at the base of his throat. She turned away to give him privacy. He banged the steering wheel with the heel of his hand. \u201cWhen I said I was worried that working so hard for a kid would mess things up between us, and I felt a little protective of the great thing we had going, you said that we were already a family. I asked you and that\u2019s what you said.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cBut if you really believed that, about us being a family, you and me, then you wouldn\u2019t have done this. So that means, deep down, you felt we were only a family if we had a kid. A kid would turn us into a family. But without one we\u2019re not. Is that right?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWell, explain it to me then. Looks to me like you went out and got yourself a family. So where does that leave me?\u201d But before she could make any sort of attempt to explain, he held up his hand. \u201cYou know how many people I could have cheated with? You want to know how many? I don\u2019t even know. Remember Meg? She was gorgeous, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d He could see the pale oval of her face in his peripheral vision as she turned to study him. It wasn\u2019t quite his point. It hadn\u2019t come out right. She should know what he meant without him spelling it out. \u201cGood for you, Mal,\u201d she said after a minute. \u201cWhat a guy.\u201d \u201cSorry. That was a dumb thing to say.\u201d \u201cI seem to recall interrupting something a few years ago. Remember Erica Delfino? Because I certainly do. But we never talked about that, did we? And Emma? You can barely make eye contact with me when her name comes up. Come on.\u201d Malcolm\u2019s stomach dropped. \u201cNothing has ever happened with Emma. She\u2019s a pretty girl and my best employee. That\u2019s all.\u201d \u201cIf you saw your chance you wouldn\u2019t take it?\u201d And then she sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t answer that. I\u2019m sorry. I mean, Jesus. Look where we are.\u201d \u201cWait, I want to say this. I\u2019m sorry about what happened with Erica. I\u2019m really sorry. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. You and I\u2014there was only one subject, you know? Nothing happened, but it could have. I\u2019m not making an excuse. I just\u2014I\u2019ve been sorry since that night and I feel sick every time I think about it. It was completely meaningless.\u201d \u201cI know that. I know you, Mal. But that doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d He cracked the window, took deep gulps of cold air. \u201cHow\u2019d we get here, Jess?\u201d She\u2019d been thinking about that exact question for seventeen weeks. She pressed her fingertips to her temples and felt far too tired to cry. Neil\u2019s kids were warming to her. The plan was for her to stay just two nights and then head over to her mother\u2019s, but then the snow arrived, far more than expected, and the thought of being trapped with her mother and all her comments, without even being able to go for a drive or take a long walk\u2014no, that was not something she could face. Being in Neil\u2019s house was like time suspended. No need to decide anything because it was not real life, not until the snow melted and the power was restored. The train signals were still out, and Bloom announced everyone in the NYC office could work from home until further notice. Neil\u2019s office said the same. The kids openly stared at her face, her clothes, her hair. Just that morning the girls came downstairs with cheeks covered in blush, eye shadow up to their brows. Jess imagined the contents of her makeup case scattered all over the bathroom floor. \u201cYou two look a little different today,\u201d Jess said, as if she couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on what had changed. They froze, medium and small versions of each other, waiting to see what Jess would do next. \u201cMay I just\u2014\u201d Jess said, reaching out with a tissue to wipe the lipstick from where it had passed the boundaries of their lips, and they glanced at each other in relief. The oldest one was still a little reserved, but the younger girl and the baby climbed up to sit on her lap even when there was an entire empty couch available. \u201cSorry,\u201d Neil said, and told them to give her some space. But it was a heady thing, having these small people place a portion of their love and trust at her feet. They didn\u2019t hold anything back to protect themselves. Their mother was supposed to take them on Sunday after the storm and keep them overnight, so Jess and Neil made dinner plans. Christine liked her weekends, Neil said, so she preferred having them on Sundays even though it meant a long drive to get them to school on Monday. There was a shortage of road salt in the entire lower Hudson Valley, but Azalea Estates was only half a mile to the entrance to the highway, which was always better than the local roads. Neil packed up their little things and drove them to their mother\u2019s at twenty-five miles an hour, only to discover she wasn\u2019t home. Turned out she flew to Nashville last minute, ahead of the storm, forgot to tell him. She got confused, she told him when he called, irate, and Jess could believe that, she supposed, but then she said the airfare was just too good to pass up, which sort of contradicted her claim of having forgotten. In the meantime, there were three little kids with their teddies clutched to their chests, wondering what was going to happen. When Neil recounted it for Jess, an hour after he packed them up and two minutes after he returned with them, he was afraid she\u2019d be annoyed. They had an evening planned. A movie picked. But all Jess could think about was that the kids were down the hall only pretending to watch TV. She could feel them watching her, ready to take in her reaction. \u201cSo what are you supposed to say?\u201d she asked Siobh\u00e1n later, once she got up the courage to call her friend, begin to explain. She was in Neil\u2019s bedroom, the door closed. She told Neil whom she was calling and he wished her luck, told her it would be fine, but added that if Siobh\u00e1n couldn\u2019t accept it, forget her. He pointed out that she had her law school friends, her college friends, her high school friends who\u2019d always been more hers than Malcolm\u2019s. And she had him now. She didn\u2019t need Siobh\u00e1n. \u201cWell, no,\u201d Jess said, looking off into a blank distance as she tried to get her mind to catch up with the bad feeling that had sprung up in her belly. \u201cI won\u2019t be dismissing Siobh\u00e1n with a \u2018forget her.\u2019 \u201d \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t, actually,\u201d she said as a cold, bewildered feeling enveloped her whole body like a caul. Siobh\u00e1n had welcomed him, arranged what were essentially playdates for him, a grown man. She wondered whom he loved, if he could name them, how many there were. And if he could say why. She wondered again what his ex-wife\u2019s version of their breakup story would look like, what picture she\u2019d paint. Siobh\u00e1n was trying her absolute best to listen to Jess\u2019s explanation without interrupting. Jess could tell she wanted to understand, but she loved Malcolm. There was that old story about how she\u2019d gotten her period in his car when they were driving down the shore together at nineteen, years before Jess knew either of them. There were three other people in the car, all boys, but somehow Malcolm figured it out\u2014he had a sister, he was no dummy\u2014so he covered for her, dropped off the others at the house they\u2019d rented and then made up some reason why he needed Siobh\u00e1n to stay in the car, help him with a beer run. He drove to a gas station restroom, and as she rinsed her shorts, dug out a fresh pair from her duffel bag, he bought a gallon of water and scrubbed the cloth-upholstered seat. He never said a single word about it until more than twenty years later, when Siobh\u00e1n recounted it for Jess and he was at the table, listening. When Siobh\u00e1n realized Jess never heard the story she shouted, \u201cYou never told her?\u201d punching him in the arm. \u201cYou told me not to tell anyone.\u201d He shrugged. Siobh\u00e1n insisted Jess could have talked to her all along, and Jess knew it was probably true. She wouldn\u2019t have stood in a circle at a party and told anyone what Jess was feeling. Siobh\u00e1n loved Malcolm but she loved Jess, too. She might have helped steer her away from the mess she was currently in. Even talking for ten minutes or so, she could feel her friend soften, feel her listening closely. \u201cWhat do you say when he returns home with the kids,\u201d she asked Siobh\u00e1n, \u201cknowing they\u2019re listening? Knowing what they\u2019ve been through and that it\u2019s quite possible their mother would prefer being anywhere else than with them. Knowing none of this is their fault? \u201cSo what I said was \u2018That\u2019s great, I\u2019m so happy they\u2019re here, I\u2019d rather hang out with them anyway.\u2019 And I could sense their minds grow easy.\u201d Morning until night, the house was full of their voices. To which Siobh\u00e1n said, after a long pause, \u201cOh, honey. What an absolute mess.\u201d \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Jess said to Malcolm in the quiet of his car. \u201cI could feel a baby in my arms. I\u2019m not trying to be dramatic. I\u2019m just telling you the truth. All that time, I thought I was seeing a future. So what was I seeing? It was so vivid. I would have been a good mother. I would have been really, really great.\u201d Malcolm wished he were better at putting words on his thoughts, but they came to him as feelings outside of language\u2014static electricity that ran down his arms, tightening in his chest. She had to make her mind change the subject, like he had. She had to take what was dark and fill it with different light. Or maybe that was what she tried to do, maybe that\u2019s what she was still trying for with Neil Bratton and his kids. It was the most astonishing thing, when he looked back. To think that when they first said they loved each other, when they got married, when they bought the house and filled it with furniture and plates and bowls and lamps and all the clutter of domestic life, that all of that was aimed at a future they had no guarantee of reaching. It had occurred to him since she left that each day, each hour, was a place he\u2019d never been, that he\u2019d have to find his way through. It was too obvious an observation to say aloud, and yet it had left him shaken. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d she asked after a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me?\u201d \u201cWell, yeah. We have a serious problem.\u201d \u201cMore than one,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than one,\u201d she agreed. \u201cSpeaking of which\u2014\u201d She took his phone off the dash and punched in his password as if they\u2019d never spent a day apart. \u201cThe snow is supposed to start tomorrow midday.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cThe power is still out on Seneca, right? That whole section of town?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d And then he noticed the lights inside Bratton\u2019s house. He looked down the block and there were lighted windows dotting the fronts of every house. \u201cI have an idea. It came to me yesterday. That\u2019s why I stopped by the house.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cFirst I want you to listen. We can talk about all this\u201d\u2014she indicated the house before them, the people inside\u2014\u201cand we have to, obviously. But we have a more pressing issue.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cMore pressing than this?\u201d \u201cHe was here. That skeevy guy. What\u2019s-his-name.\u201d Malcolm was a total blank, and then he gaped at her. \u201cHugh\u2019s guy? Billy?\u201d \u201cYeah. Scared the hell out of me. I think he was outside our house when I went by, and then he followed me. Anyway, he just parked, and looked. And made sure I saw him looking. Don\u2019t get mad, just listen.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cOkay, so I have an idea.\u201d \u201cYou said that.\u201d \u201cAnd it\u2019s so obvious I don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t think of it before.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Malcolm said, waiting. \u201cBut before I tell you, I think you should go home and think about the bar. Think about yourself, about Hugh, about Gillam, the whole situation.\u201d \u201cHuh? You\u2019re sending me home to think? What\u2019s this about, Jess?\u201d \u201cAlong with the bar,\u201d Jess continued, \u201cthink about me and you, all that\u2019s happened. You know what I read on one of the fertility sites recently? This woman commented that someone else was the luckiest person in the world to have had a healthy child, and a hundred people piped up and agreed. But then this one woman way down in the comments said the luckiest thing, actually, was that each of us got born in the first place, that we should all remember that. Because what were the chances? I\u2019ve been thinking about that. I\u2019m mourning the babies I didn\u2019t have, but to get you, to get me, for our mothers to have conceived us\u2014us specifically, you and I, and not the gazillion other possible combinations that could have gotten mixed up in there. It means something. And then to have been delivered safely, to have been raised safely, too. Whether we stay together or stay apart, it means something. I\u2019m just trying to figure out what. We\u2019re messing up. We\u2019re wasting time. We have one life, and it\u2019s a miracle when you think about it. I want to stop messing it up.\u201d \u201cBut how? We can\u2019t exactly start over.\u201d \u201cLook, Malcolm.\u201d She turned fully in her seat and stared at him straight on. She wanted to put her hands on his beautiful face. She wanted to climb onto his lap. As if reading her thoughts, he took hold of her wrist and held her hand against his cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m asking,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m working up to. Are you sure about that?\u201d \n nine Was he sure about that? He asked himself that question as he drove, once again, by the Half Moon. He didn\u2019t bother going inside. He told Jess he\u2019d meet her over there in the morning, before the snow, so she could explain her idea. He stayed in Bratton\u2019s driveway long enough to watch her pull her navy coat tight around her body and walk back inside. Once she closed the door, he took his coffee from the cup holder\u2014long gone cold\u2014lowered his window, and flung it at the back of Bratton\u2019s car. It exploded against the rear windshield, the cup skittering in one direction, the lid in another. He waited a few seconds to see if anyone\u2014if Bratton\u2014would come running out the door, but the world was as still as it had been before. As he drove away, the announcer from the local radio station was asking people to look in on each other, especially the elderly. There were warming centers set up in various parts of the county, but the problem was getting people there. He suggested those with fireplaces and generators take neighbors in. It was not advisable to drive, but a car with gas could be turned on for heat. The announcer warned that running cars should be in well-ventilated areas, that tailpipes should be checked for ice or packed snow. Malcolm drove by his mother\u2019s house again because he forgot to check how much wood she had stacked on the porch, but she didn\u2019t answer, so he stomped around the house to the slider, which was always unlocked. \u201cMa?\u201d he called. The wood-burning stove felt warm to the touch, and the place smelled strongly of smoke. He walked quickly through the house, not caring about the snow he was tracking, expecting to find her slumped somewhere. Would it be better to drive to the hospital himself or call an ambulance? But the house was empty. Her car was parked in the driveway. He drove over to Mr. Sheridan\u2019s house and knocked. \u201cOh, hi, Malcolm,\u201d Mr. Sheridan said when he opened the door. \u201cYour mom is here. Were you worried? I\u2019m sorry. She just\u2014\u201d He stepped out and pulled the door shut behind him. He spoke in a low voice. \u201cShe just seemed a little confused. I figured, why not set her up here? If she\u2019s here with me, then I won\u2019t have to worry about her.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d Malcolm said. Mr. Sheridan worried about her? Malcolm said he appreciated it. Then Mr. Sheridan opened the door wide and used a loud voice. \u201cHey, Gail, Malcolm found you. You were afraid he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cIs that you, Malcolm?\u201d his mother called. \u201cHi, Mom,\u201d he said, following Mr. Sheridan into the living room. He tried to remember when Mr. Sheridan\u2019s wife died, if it was before or after his dad. He felt a little confused, too, like he was slow on the uptake, but they were just friends, surely, they\u2019d been friends for years. His mother was seventy-two and Mr. Sheridan was probably older. He wanted to call Jess immediately, tell her to forget their troubles for two seconds so he could get her take on this. There was his mother, sitting on the couch with her knees tucked up on the cushion like a kid. She was clutching a mug of tea, and Mr. Sheridan\u2019s German shepherd dog was at her feet. The fire was roaring. \u201cI went by the house.\u201d \u201cLook how handsome,\u201d his mother said, her face lit with pride. \u201cYou okay, Mom? You good?\u201d He made a point of glancing at Mr. Sheridan so she\u2019d understand. \u201cThe smoke started coming inside. Just pouring in! I opened the flue.\u201d \u201cWell, that shouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cMaybe the ice\u2014\u201d Behind her back, Mr. Sheridan shook his head almost imperceptibly, gave Malcolm a look that asked whether he was really buying it, and the rest of Malcolm\u2019s thought fell away. \u201cI\u2019ll check it when I can, Gail,\u201d Mr. Sheridan said. \u201cOr I will,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cEverything\u2019s gonna stink of smoke,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll air out, Mom. It\u2019s good you\u2019re here.\u201d \u201cYou heard there\u2019s another one coming?\u201d Mr. Sheridan asked him. He seemed younger than his years. Boyish, with that head of hair. What did he want with his mother? \u201cYeah. I\u2019m worried about the bar. I\u2019ve got a generator running, but\u2014\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNo word on the power coming back?\u201d \u201cI keep calling. The recording has been predicting eight to ten hours for the last three days.\u201d \u201cGreat.\u201d \u201cWell, listen, you go on, do what you have to do. It\u2019s getting dark. We\u2019re like pioneers now, have to do everything before nightfall. She\u2019s okay here. Honestly. Aren\u2019t you, Gail?\u201d \u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked, directing the question to his mother, trying to get her to meet his eyes so he could really see. Where would she sleep? If Jess were there, she\u2019d find a way to ask. \u201cI\u2019m fine! Look!\u201d She showed him the paper tag of her tea bag hanging over the edge of her mug. \u201cHe has Lady Grey.\u201d Malcolm woke early the next morning, and went straight to the Half Moon. When he pulled up, Rob Waggoner was standing outside, holding a paper bag. This again, Malcolm thought. \u201cFigured you\u2019d be camping here,\u201d Rob said. \u201cBrought you an egg sandwich. I was just about to take off.\u201d \u201cThank you, no, my bed is more comfortable than a barstool. I appreciate this,\u201d he said, taking the bag. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d \u201cI heard you had a guest and didn\u2019t even know. I just want to get in there and take a few photos. Becker and Navarro will be here in a minute.\u201d \u201cYeah, sure. Any news?\u201d Malcolm asked, popping the street door open like he\u2019d demonstrated to the other cops the day before. \u201cAh.\u201d Rob Waggoner pulled off his knit hat and rubbed his hair. He was dressed in plainclothes and looked far younger than he had the first time they met. Malcolm had no idea if he had kids of his own, if he hated his father or what. \u201cYes, actually.\u201d \u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Malcolm said. He began leading Rob up the stairs. \u201cAre you allowed to say?\u201d If he wasn\u2019t, Malcolm knew he could probably get it out of Jackie. \u201cThey told you he was booked on a flight to Toronto? Well, it looks as if he also booked a flight to Panama City, departing from Toronto a few hours later.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cHe wanted us to think he was in Canada, but was really aiming for Panama City.\u201d \u201cAnd was he on both flights?\u201d \u201cWe have confirmation he was on the first flight, but we\u2019re still waiting on the passenger list for Panama City. We\u2019re looping in the police up in Toronto.\u201d \u201cHey, no offense, but shouldn\u2019t there be real detectives involved maybe? The FBI?\u201d Another police car pulled up. \u201cOh they\u2019re definitely involved. It looks like he was in pretty big trouble. There was an SEC investigation into his company, and apparently they presented their findings to the commission this past week. His partner will be arrested any minute, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll issue a warrant for my dad.\u201d \u201cWow,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cJeez. Tripp.\u201d \u201cBut until there\u2019s a warrant, he\u2019s just a missing person, and it\u2019s still with our local department. He\u2019s just a guy who flew to Canada in bad weather without telling his wife. Changing his beneficiary is not illegal. Booking flights isn\u2019t illegal.\u201d Malcolm thought people told him things when he was behind the bar because they considered the relationship sacred, separate from their real lives, protected. And because they were drinking. But maybe it was just something about him that made people want to talk. Jackie and Officer Navarro jogged up the stairs to join them. \u201cHello again,\u201d Jackie said. Malcolm stood aside in the doorway as the other officers joined them, so Rob could see his father\u2019s pile of things. But Rob just looked at him blankly. And then Malcolm noticed the stuff was gone. He looked in the bathroom. No toothbrush. No deodorant. He walked the room from end to end as if there were any places a duffel bag might have gone to hide. \u201cWhere\u2019d the stuff go?\u201d Navarro asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Malcolm said, feeling accused. \u201cI didn\u2019t touch it.\u201d He went to the other stairs and jogged down, opened the door first to the hall, and then to the men\u2019s room. He removed the hidden key from its spot and looked in the storage cabinet. The undershirts were gone, too. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Malcolm said, returning upstairs just as Navarro\u2019s phone rang. He turned his back to take the call. \u201cYou were right,\u201d Navarro said when he hung up. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been to his office since December.\u201d They all looked around the room. \u201cWho cleared out his stuff?\u201d Jackie asked. \u201cMark Duro?\u201d Navarro suggested, and Malcolm noticed all three officers were looking at him funny. The air pressure in the room shifted just a fraction but Malcolm felt it. \u201cWho else knows about this space up here?\u201d Navarro asked. \u201cAhhhh, the former owner, every person who ever worked for him, everyone who works for me, anyone who passes by and notices, oh, that building is two stories.\u201d Navarro nodded. Rob was looking back and forth between them. \u201cHow\u2019s the bar doing?\u201d Navarro asked. \u201cI heard you\u2019re having a hard time.\u201d He withdrew a pad and pen from his jacket to make a note. \u201cBullshit. Where\u2019d you hear that?\u201d Malcolm said. Ridiculous. \u201cYou think I helped this guy? Like I don\u2019t have enough problems?\u201d The place certainly didn\u2019t look as if he poured much money into it, but it looked exactly the same in Hugh\u2019s day, and no one doubted Hugh was minting money. Navarro couldn\u2019t pull his financials without a warrant, and why would he have done that before that very moment. He wondered if they could have checked with the liquor authority. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Jackie said slowly, looking carefully at Malcolm but directing the comment to Navarro. \u201cI really don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cMe neither,\u201d Rob said. \u201cYou guys,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you\u2019re understanding how hammered he was on Friday night. There\u2019s no way he pulled this off, whatever it is.\u201d \u201cHe might have been pretending.\u201d \u201cI seriously doubt it.\u201d \u201cWell, he was on that flight.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d Malcolm said, suddenly annoyed to be even talking about this. Tripp was almost a stranger to him, and he had plenty of his own worries. What if he didn\u2019t have things shipshape for the party coming in Thursday night? What if power stayed out for another week? What if Billy was serious about getting Hugh his money by the weekend? Impossible. \u201cIf anything occurs to you, call us.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d Malcolm said. When they got back to the sidewalk, he spotted Jess\u2019s mother\u2019s car pulling up across the street. Jess must have borrowed it, but how did she get over to her mother\u2019s in the first place? Suddenly he could picture the scene, Bratton driving her there and meeting Maureen Ryan, who sprayed her hair into a perfect shell for the occasion. Bratton was exactly the type of guy she wanted for her daughter all along. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Jess asked as the officers got into their cars. They all got on their phones immediately, which Malcolm didn\u2019t like one bit. \u201cNothing,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cNothing?\u201d \u201cGive me a break, Jess. It\u2019s a long story.\u201d \u201cSure, okay.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell me what your idea is.\u201d She glanced at the cars, still idling. \u201cI should probably wait until they leave.\u201d Inside, she looked around the place as if she\u2019d never seen it before. She walked through the kitchen, looked in the mop closet. She went downstairs to the storage room, and he followed her. She got down on her hands and knees to look more closely at the ancient furnace. She crawled over to the shelf where he kept leftover construction supplies\u2014half-empty cans of paint in case the walls upstairs needed touch-ups. Thinners. Polyurethane from when they refinished the wood floors. Random pieces of lumber. Old rags. Light bulbs. A drill. His toolbox. On the next higher shelves were boxes of alcohol, mostly fruit-flavored vodkas he\u2019d over-ordered in the summer and that would now sit there until warm weather. He\u2019d tried to sell them over the winter, save him from buying more of the unflavored, but people weren\u2019t interested. She began piling empty boxes. She kept stacking until the pile touched the crossbeams over their heads. When she finished, she started another tower, this time against a wood support beam. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Without answering, she carried an old barstool over to the wall with the window, climbed up, peered out. \u201cWe have an extension cord, right?\u201d \u201cYeah it\u2019s upstairs.\u201d \u201cHow long is it?\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you put the space heater against the main? Down here? Warming the pipe that far up the line doesn\u2019t protect the sections down here from getting frozen.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous down here. All this stuff. Plus buildings freeze from the top down. Down here will be okay because it\u2019s underground.\u201d \u201cHm,\u201d she said, thinking about that. \u201cIs that common knowledge? And why didn\u2019t you get the valve on the main fixed? It\u2019s been broken for what? Two years? How much would it cost? A few hundred bucks?\u201d He crossed his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s been broken since Hugh\u2019s day.\u201d \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you fix it. I mean if someone asks you. What would you say?\u201d \u201cWhy would anyone ask?\u201d \u201cHumor me.\u201d \u201cI would tell them the truth. That I was waiting until I had more room in the budget. You know as well as I do that one thing leads to another. I had a plumber take a look at some point, but he wanted to dig up the whole floor. I\u2019ve been working here for a lot of years and I never remember the pipes freezing, so I figured it would be fine for a while longer.\u201d \u201cBut we\u2019ve never lost power for this long. Not as far as I can remember. And another storm is coming.\u201d \u201cAnd? What\u2019s your point?\u201d \u201cYou said it would be too dangerous to set up the heater down here,\u201d Jess reminded him. \u201cBut it makes sense, right? If you wanted to protect the whole system?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it does make sense.\u201d \u201cWhat I mean is, if you explained your train of thought to someone, it would ring true.\u201d He waited. \u201cIt\u2019s part of my idea.\u201d She walked over to the metal file cabinet, pulled open the bottom drawer. That cabinet was where they kept the deed, the receipts from vendors, contracts, permits, licenses, employee 1099s, insurance policies. She ran her fingers along the tabs, removed a file, flipped it open, read silently for a moment, and then nodded as if to confirm something to herself. She handed the file to Malcolm, but he didn\u2019t know what he was supposed to be doing with it. \u201cWhat?\u201d And then he knew. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, handing the file back to her. \u201cNo, Jess. No way.\u201d \u201cListen.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re nuts.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve completely lost it. Jesus Christ.\u201d \u201cStatistically, this would be the time when it would happen. I\u2019ve been reading since yesterday. A basement like this is ideal for producing a large fire. There are so many ways it could ignite accidentally. It would rise straight up and destroy the whole room above us. Everyone knows you love this place, that you\u2019re worried about it, that you\u2019d want to protect the plumbing and might not have thought out the consequences.\u201d \u201cBut I did think about it. Which is why I put the heater upstairs.\u201d \u201cBut what if you were in a panic and made a bad decision?\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s believable, isn\u2019t it? That you would have set it up down here?\u201d \u201cBelievable that I would do that? Malcolm Gephardt? Or that a person would do that?\u201d She hesitated. \u201cA person. Anyone. Think about it. A power outage. A thirty-year-old space heater. What were the safety standards on those things back then? You know how many fires they cause every year? I looked up the stats. Who\u2019s to say you don\u2019t store gasoline for the generator down here? So what if you moved the generator outside that window, snaked the power cord through, pushed the space heater up against the main here in your hopes of keeping the whole system warm. And let\u2019s say, oops, it was set up too close to that tower of boxes, all those chemicals. Let\u2019s say the heater throws a spark.\u201d He stared at her. Together, they looked at the crossbeams over their head, the low ceiling. Together, they thought about the floor above. \u201cSeveral people can attest to the fact that the lever broke years ago, and that it was never fixed.\u201d \u201cPlease stop.\u201d \u201cAn accident caused by your best efforts to protect the place.\u201d When he didn\u2019t say anything, she pointed to the document she wanted him to see. \u201cRead it. Look at the numbers. Our fire coverage is better than our flood coverage. There\u2019s loss of business income coverage, too. Add it up. We can get square with Hugh, with the bank. Then tell me that this is crazy.\u201d She could see she was breaking his heart for the second time. \u201cYou want to go to prison, Jess? Because I definitely don\u2019t. Stop. I don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll be deemed an accident. I know it will. We won\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d She had that preternatural calm she always had when she was right. \u201cAnd we\u2019d be free. You could do whatever you want. Take everything you learned here and start from scratch. Me too. We could sell our house.\u201d \u201cSell our house?\u201d He couldn\u2019t read the expression on her face. \u201cAnd go where? You\u2019ll stay with Neil? At his house?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said, looking away. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She hadn\u2019t even said it to herself so plainly yet, but she knew almost the moment she stepped inside his house that it was the end of something, not the beginning. \u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d He was embarrassed at how he clung to this small hope, not that he knew what to do with it. \u201cThing is, Mal, this idea\u2014it\u2019s time sensitive. This storm will be here in a matter of hours. The utility company is working around the clock, but even they will have to call it when the storm hits. The moment the power comes back on, this no longer makes sense. And by the way, the snow, the freeze, those conditions would also prevent the fire trucks from getting here quickly. Everywhere is closed. No one will even notice the place is burning until it\u2019s fully involved. The local patch said every town in the county is out of salt. The sand they trucked in has almost run out, too. No one can get anywhere quickly.\u201d \u201cFully involved,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou really have been reading.\u201d She walked over to him. She was so close they might as well have been touching. \u201cPlus,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you notice? Where are the hydrants?\u201d He pictured the street outside. \u201cThey\u2019re all covered in snow.\u201d She told him to just read the files. One problem at a time and this would be first. When he walked her out, she turned and faced him once more. Her expression was all business, like it always was when she was worried about something. \u201cIf you search anything online, make sure you\u2019re on private mode but try not to because I don\u2019t know to what extent those searches are protected.\u201d \u201cJesus,\u201d he said. She looked up Seneca, and not a single thing was stirring. \u201cThe fire department will know there\u2019s no one inside. They won\u2019t go into a dangerous situation for no reason. I\u2019ll meet you at our house in\u201d\u2014she looked at her phone\u2014\u201cat three o\u2019clock. We\u2019ll take one car. It\u2019s probably best yours stays in your driveway. The snow will be coming down hard by then, and people will be home, hunkered down.\u201d \u201cAnd then what?\u201d \u201cThen we wait.\u201d It was just after eleven a.m. Several flakes drifted down, early harbingers of what was coming. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re wrong and someone gets killed? They\u2019re volunteers. What if they don\u2019t have the training paid firefighters have? There are very young guys who do it. Like barely out of high school, I think.\u201d What he didn\u2019t say: There was a person staying upstairs who I didn\u2019t even know about. That whatever Tripp had done, he\u2019d used the Half Moon as part of his plan. He was distracted by the thought of her coming over. At three o\u2019clock she\u2019d stand in their kitchen, walk through their rooms. \u201cIf this goes the way I know it will, they\u2019ll just let it burn and protect the other buildings. No one\u2019s going to get hurt.\u201d She looked to the left and right of the Half Moon. No shared walls. The alleys on either side were at least ten feet wide. There was the tiny deli to the right with the offices upstairs. On the other side was Primavera. All closed since Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to say. This is our only option.\u201d \u201cThat can\u2019t be true,\u201d he said. He\u2019d already been thinking about how he might get Hugh\u2019s address in South Carolina. He hadn\u2019t seen John since the day he fired him for stealing, but he bet John was still in touch with Hugh, maybe even working for him again. If he could only get a few minutes with him in person, they could surely sort it out. \u201cWell.\u201d She looked at her phone. \u201cYou have a few hours to decide.\u201d He stood there for a while after she left, watching the traffic light turn yellow, then red, then green, then yellow again. He wondered what she was doing in the meantime. Going to see her mother, she said, but how could he ever know what she said was true? She told Malcolm she wanted to see Siobh\u00e1n in person, but Siobh\u00e1n had said that with Patrick home her house was most definitely not the place to chat, and with the new storm coming and everywhere closed, they couldn\u2019t exactly go out. They\u2019d have to do it another time. Malcolm felt a flare of satisfaction at that, and when Jess saw it pass through him, she closed her eyes and shrugged as if to say that was his right, he\u2019d earned it, there\u2019d be a lot more where that came from. Patrick was his. Toby, too. (\u201cToby\u2019s all yours,\u201d Jess would say.) Everyone in Gillam, probably, except for Neil. But she was the voice in his head, even when she wasn\u2019t there in front of him. The men are yours, Jess might say. But the women? She\u2019d make that face meant to warn him not to be so sure. They might understand: her girlfriends, her mother, any woman who listened to her whole story and really took it in. They\u2019d never admit it to their partners\u2014no, they\u2019d never do a thing like that, risk their families, risk their predictable lives, my God, what had she been thinking\u2014but to each other? To themselves, in the privacy of their own thoughts? There were those who\u2019d sympathize with following a temptation to its conclusion. There were those who would admire a woman who had a problem and did what she thought might fix it. When Malcolm went back inside, he went straight to the file she left flapped open on the basement floor. He took a good look at the numbers and then closed it, returned it to the cabinet. That was all her doing, the insurance policies. After she found out about his side deal with Hugh, she went out and purchased coverage for every possibility. He shivered though he didn\u2019t feel cold, exactly. He could sense her there, in the light she\u2019d just been standing in, the red glints in her dark hair. Even as he insisted to himself that the whole thing was completely insane, he felt himself brush up against the lure. He closed his eyes and made himself picture it, the entire place aflame. He waited for the memories to come at him like echoes down a long corridor, but instead he felt peace. A new chapter. A chance to start over. Waking up in the morning without feeling like he was scrambling uphill before he even opened his eyes. Moving through his day without a physical weight pressing on his chest. He thought again of Tripp. Look at what he might have pulled off, assuming he wasn\u2019t dead in a ditch somewhere. Instead of whining to his bartender for the next twenty years like most people would do, he\u2019d taken action. Instead of waiting for the Feds to come arrest him, he\u2019d taken off. And now where was he? A place so far from a city that he could finally see the stars. In Malcolm\u2019s mind he tried to place this village he\u2019d never seen\u2014sun-drenched, quiet\u2014and next to it he placed Gillam, the endless jockeying for parking spaces, the relentless moaning about traffic and taxes. When people asked whatever happened to the Half Moon, he wouldn\u2019t even have to say it failed. It had been doing just fine up until the moment tragedy hit. At home, he tried to think it out, every possibility, every reason it was a bad idea. He pulled the shades and stretched out on the floor. He stared at the ceiling. He was starving, but he was too tired to get up and hunt for a snack. At three o\u2019clock Jess knocked twice on the side door and then let herself in. The flurries had multiplied. He watched her notice the wire fruit bowl was now on the opposite end of the counter. She glanced out the window over the sink. \u201cThose branches fell very close to the house.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d he said, without moving. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d she asked. He drew himself up to full height. \u201cHow is it you\u2019re so calm?\u201d \u201cBecause we don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d \u201cWe could file for bankruptcy.\u201d \u201cI thought about that. That could solve the debt with the bank. It might even solve our debt with the clinic. Our credit would be destroyed, but it can\u2019t get much worse anyway. Problem is I don\u2019t think Hugh accepts Chapter 11 filings.\u201d \u201cI was also thinking my mom probably has something tucked away.\u201d \u201cStop,\u201d she said, looking at him finally like the old Jess. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious.\u201d He shrugged, held up his hands. \u201cYour mother\u2019s going to need every cent she has. She\u2019s only seventy-two. She makes eleven dollars an hour, Malcolm. No, we won\u2019t be asking either of our mothers. We got ourselves into this, and we\u2019re going to get ourselves out.\u201d He sighed. She was right. \u201cLook,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if we\u2019re going to have to sprint up the stairs with a fireball at our heels. We\u2019re just placing things next to each other. Think of it that way. If a fire inspector finds evidence of gasoline, of chemicals, yes, that makes sense, that\u2019s what was stored down there. We\u2019re not trying to hide that. The whole staff knows what\u2019s down there. In fact those things were part of the backdrop for so long that we stopped seeing them. You were so worried about pipes bursting that you just went ahead and put that ancient heater in the spot where it made the most sense to you.\u201d \u201cBut\u2014\u201d he said. He tried to pinpoint exactly what he wanted to say, tried to find the precise thing that was nagging him. People didn\u2019t get away with this, or else they\u2019d do it all the time. Everywhere, times get tough, buildings would be burning. But they weren\u2019t. Or were they? He thought of what happened at the caf\u00e9 on Vanderbilt. Three in the morning, an electrical fire. They had to close the place for a few months, but when they finally reopened, they had a new kitchen, state of the art. They had beautiful custom shelves installed in the dining room. He imagined being interrogated. All of his answers would be right there, adjacent to the truth. Such a strange set of days, all the rules were different until the power came back on. They took Maureen Ryan\u2019s car. Jess drove with her mouth pinched into a straight line. As they passed each house, he understood what she meant about people hunkering down, looking only to themselves and the people they were stranded with. No one was thinking past getting salt on their own driveways, a way to get a hot meal into their kids. There was chimney smoke coming from a few houses, not many. The roar of generators churned up the silence. Driving through town, Jess cruised by the bar as if it didn\u2019t mean anything to her and parked a block away. They entered through the alley door, out of range of the camera trained on the front door. Once inside, he was relieved that she didn\u2019t go directly to the stairs. \u201cYou want a drink?\u201d she asked. \u201cNow?\u201d he asked. \u201cSure. Fifteen minutes won\u2019t make much difference.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. One drink and then they\u2019d begin the plan. One drink and then he\u2019d put one foot in front of another, and then again, again, come what may. But for now the bar was still standing, he\u2019d done nothing wrong, he was just there with Jess, company in hard weather. She moved seamlessly as she made them each a Manhattan, her slender hands. She placed the napkin down in front of him first, then the glass on top. She would have made a great bartender. He drank slowly, small sips, long pauses, but he reached the bottom anyway. He said he\u2019d go move the generator while she moved the space heater downstairs, but told her to take her time, finish her drink. He took a detour on his way outside to jog up the back stairs and check the second story, to make sure whoever had been crashing there hadn\u2019t come back. But it was still empty, and he stood by the window for a moment to watch the street fill with snow. When he returned downstairs and carried the generator around to the back, he knocked on the basement window from outside. She had to hammer it with the butt end of a screwdriver to get it to pop open. For a second he thought it was all over, the plan wouldn\u2019t work if they couldn\u2019t get the window open, and he couldn\u2019t decide whether he was disappointed or relieved. But then she shimmied it open a crack, just enough to snake the cord through. \u201cWhat are you going to do after this?\u201d he asked when he joined her in the basement. He didn\u2019t know how to frame the question except to simply ask. \u201cGo to my mom\u2019s I guess.\u201d \u201cNo, I mean what are you going to do, Jess? What am I going to do?\u201d It was darker outside now, the snow coming down harder. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d They both walked to the window, stood on tiptoe and looked out. The second canister of gas was at Malcolm\u2019s feet. \u201cYou want to do it?\u201d she asked, holding out a book of matches. \u201cNo way,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was your idea.\u201d She seemed to have expected that. He watched her light a match. He watched her crouch down and hold it to a corner of the bottom box. Malcolm\u2019s heart was beating very fast. He wanted to warn someone that this was happening, someone who could manage the next steps without putting anyone in danger but who wouldn\u2019t rat them out. But who? The flame grew brighter for a few moments but then burned out, leaving only a wan curl of smoke. Jess rearranged the boxes and reached for a second match. But she hesitated for just a second, and Malcolm felt something tighten in his chest. He thought of Emma\u2019s cardigan on a hanger in the broom closet. He thought of the picture of Scotty\u2019s kids that was taped to the side of the microwave. He thought of the framed photo of Gephardt\u2019s that he hung over the bar when he took over: 1982. His father standing under the sign with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, the blur of a yellow cab as it sped out of the frame. \u201cHang on,\u201d he said, staying her hand. \u201cHang on a sec.\u201d He knelt down beside her on the packed dirt floor. \u201cWe need to think for just a minute.\u201d She dropped the book of matches into her pocket and let out a long breath. Was she relieved? He couldn\u2019t tell. It was harder to read her than it used to be. She\u2019d always been a doer, that was one of the things he loved about her. She was a worker, a problem solver. If someone got dumped, then she set them up with someone new. If someone needed a job, then she asked around until that person got one. She paid attention to how things were done so that she\u2019d know how to do them herself. When they bought their house and had zero money to spare after the down payment, she took classes at Home Depot to learn how to tile, how to grout. When they were short on food at Siobh\u00e1n\u2019s baby shower, it was Jess who took everything to the kitchen, cut what they had in half, and rearranged it on more platters so it seemed as if it had doubled. \u201cIt was just like the loaves and the fishes,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n said when she recounted it for Malcolm later. \u201cA miracle.\u201d She felt stuck in her job, so she left. She felt stuck in her marriage, apparently, so she left that, too. They sat in silence for a while. \u201cI\u2019m out of ideas,\u201d she said eventually. \u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI just have to talk to Hugh. I have to make him talk to me. I\u2019ve called and called but\u2014\u201d He shrugged. \u201cListen. Let\u2019s just go, okay? The snow must be coming down hard by now.\u201d \u201cThis is our chance. We won\u2019t get another. You need to be sure.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d Malcolm unplugged the power cord, pushed it back through the window. He told her he\u2019d move the generator back to the original spot, and asked her if she wouldn\u2019t mind carrying the heater upstairs. \u201cI can\u2019t move,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me. I can\u2019t move. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck.\u201d She was sitting there hugging her knees in the dark. So he carried the heater upstairs, set everything up as it had been. He filled the motor with gas and started it up. \u201cJess,\u201d he said when he returned to the basement. \u201cTime to go. Come on.\u201d She held out her hand and he took it, gently pulled her forward. Outside, the snow was pounding hard. Malcolm used his sleeve to clear the windows. Jess stood there without helping. She kept rubbing her face with her cold-reddened hand. \u201cJess?\u201d he asked, and then he reached into her coat pocket and fished out her mother\u2019s key. He opened the passenger door for her and guided her in. He went around to the driver\u2019s side and started the car. \u201cYou\u2019re fine.\u201d He looked over at her. \u201cNothing happened. We\u2019re fine.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d she repeated. She had her forehead pressed against the cold glass. The rear wheels fishtailed a little and then found traction. \u201cMalcolm,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you ever think about what would have happened if I hadn\u2019t gotten pregnant?\u201d Somehow, he knew that she meant the first time. At twenty-five. If they hadn\u2019t rushed into marriage. If they hadn\u2019t been so giddy as they applied for the license without telling a soul, Malcolm stuck in traffic coming from Gillam and Jess glazed with sweat after a short walk from the subway, unseasonably warm for May. He caught sight of her crossing the street that day and tried to decide whether she looked pregnant yet. There was a blank on the application where she had to write her new name, if she chose to change it. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to decide right now?\u201d \u201cYou can always change it later on,\u201d the woman behind the desk said. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about this,\u201d she said, the pen still poised above the blank. \u201cI like your name,\u201d Malcolm said. His way of telling her that it didn\u2019t matter to him either way. \u201cAnd I like yours. And we\u2019re getting married,\u201d Jess said, and quickly wrote Jessica Lee Gephardt in the blank space. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d she said when the woman collected the forms, told them where to wait. She threw her arms around him and squealed. They drove to Gillam together after, riding a wave of momentum, of raucous joy. When they finally got back to the house, the wipers barely able to keep up with the snow, Jess said, \u201cI\u2019m coming in.\u201d It felt as right and natural as anything that had happened in four months. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cListen. We\u2019re going to figure everything out.\u201d She looked at him. \u201cHow?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, but we will.\u201d Once they were inside, he reminded her that she had plenty of clothes upstairs if she wanted to change. She went up and he soaked in the sound of her moving around above him. She eventually came down in her old leggings, a long flannel shirt he hadn\u2019t seen her wear in years peeking out from beneath a wool sweater. She put her coat back on. Inside they sat close together on the couch for warmth. He pulled across their laps the heavy down comforter he\u2019d carried downstairs several days earlier. \u201cDidn\u2019t we talk about getting a fireplace?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d he said, and figured they could both fill in the blank. They\u2019d talked about lots of things, all of which were put off until until until. The snow tinkled against the windows. \u201cHey, Malcolm?\u201d she said. Her head was somewhat below his. He breathed her in and realized he probably didn\u2019t smell too fresh. He didn\u2019t want to talk about anything big. He didn\u2019t want to get into it. He was so tired, and so cold, and so hungry, and he just wanted to rest there for a bit, her body fitted to his despite all their bulky layers. Whatever might happen, he wanted to be quiet there with her for a few hours. \u201cYeah?\u201d \u201cI know I made a mess of things.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything, so she continued. \u201cI know what I did is not the same as what you did with buying the building.\u201d He thought about all the things he saw at the bar and looked away from. The little nods of agreement and the silences because that was his job, to be dependable and neutral. To have no opinion. Would he have told her about his side deal with Hugh? If she hadn\u2019t figured it out so fast? Probably not. \u201cI made a mess of things, too,\u201d he said eventually. She didn\u2019t say anything, but he felt her shift, felt her relax against him. \u201cFreezing in here,\u201d she said. \n ten In Malcolm\u2019s dreams they heard sirens. They ran to the window to listen and then they tried to remember their prayers, as if God would help a pair like them, two sinners who\u2019d not stepped inside a church since they were kids except for their friends\u2019 weddings. Mr. Sheridan was in his dreams, too, pushing a snowblower with huge, muscular arms that unsettled Malcolm. Dr. Hanley appeared with his notebook. Hugh showed up, squeezed behind the steering wheel of his Cadillac. Emma was there, pulling at the end of her ponytail. But in reality, during the many times he woke during the night, he heard nothing except wind, the trees outside groaning as they swayed. It felt right sleeping side by side on the couch instead of upstairs. They\u2019d reached not a truce, exactly, but more of a pause, a taking of breath. Over and over, as she slept and he stared at the blank ceiling, he tried to pinpoint the moment when the line that had been rising so steadily year over year reached a summit and began to fall. All that promise. They just frittered it away, and they didn\u2019t even notice until it was too late. Until it was almost too late, Jess would say. \u201cAlmost too late\u201d was actually the same as \u201cin the nick of time.\u201d When Malcolm opened his eyes next, the world outside was brighter and Jess was still sleeping, heavy against his shoulder. \u201cHey,\u201d she said, hoarse, when he stood into the cold. It was very early, he could feel it. They both looked at their phones. \u201cMine\u2019s dead,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cMine too.\u201d He walked to the front door and looked out, but there was nothing but a bracing white, so bright Malcolm had to shade his eyes. The snow had stopped. His skin was so cold under his clothes. He wondered how his mother had fared at Mr. Sheridan\u2019s. \u201cYour mom is okay in this?\u201d Jess asked, as if reading his thoughts. \u201cShe went to stay with her friend.\u201d \u201cOh, good.\u201d What she didn\u2019t tell Malcolm: that she\u2019d invited her own mother to come to Neil\u2019s, since he had heat and lights, but her mother had declined out of loyalty to Malcolm. Malcolm would be surprised by that, moved maybe, but to tell the story she\u2019d have to say Neil\u2019s name. \u201cThe power\u2019s been out for too long,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people aren\u2019t going to make it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. I don\u2019t remember anything like this.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d \u201cMe too. Is there any food here?\u201d \u201cSome old meat loaf I meant to throw away,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t find matches to light the pilot.\u201d He\u2019d had a splitting headache the day before but now he felt light-headed. Neil Bratton probably kept a half dozen travel chargers on hand at all times. He probably had a ten-thousand-dollar generator. Besides the meat loaf, the fridge was empty except for a jar of pickles and a tub of butter. That was where Malcolm\u2019s search usually ended, but Jess went over to the pantry, reached into the way back, and withdrew a can of black beans. She rustled around some more and came up with a large can of diced tomatoes. She went to the drawer where they threw random things to search for matches hidden beneath old bills, menus, and dried out pens. \u201cOh wait,\u201d she said, remembering. She reached into her coat pocket and withdrew the book of matches from the previous day. She went to the spice rack and removed this and that. She measured rice into a small pot, covered the rice with water. Never in a million years could Malcolm have looked at the random things she assembled and make his mind see a meal. \u201cPlenty here,\u201d she said. Malcolm lit the pilot on the stove and in twenty minutes they had hot food. Just like the story of the baby shower, she\u2019d made something out of nothing. When they finished their first bowls, eating in silence, they each had another. It was so elemental. Cooking. Eating. Washing up after with the water Malcolm had collected. Two white bowls left to dry on a worn kitchen towel. A cobalt blue sky beyond the window. It was an extravagance, thinking only about the present moment. There was Jess, next to him. He already felt warmer, his headache fading. \u201cWe\u2019re in trouble,\u201d Jess said. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it. Let\u2019s not talk about anything until later. Okay? For this morning let\u2019s just pretend nothing\u2019s wrong and then maybe something will come to us. I know that\u2019s nuts but\u2014\u201d Whatever Jess might have said to object, she swallowed back. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. What harm? He was different than he was before she left. She\u2019d first noticed when they were in the basement of the bar. Something in the way he held himself apart from her. Something about the solemn way he listened as she spoke. And now she was seeing it again. Where was the guy who clapped a dozen backs when he walked into a room? The guy who parted the air just by walking through it? Where was the kid who sprang for ice cream cones for the whole neighborhood, without having the first idea what the tab would come to? Gone, as far as she could tell. Humbled. Crushed. By her and what she\u2019d done, yes. She made herself acknowledge that fact. But also, the slow-motion failure of a dream. She\u2019d seen that failure coming, but he hadn\u2019t. She saw that it hadn\u2019t just been denial; he truly had not seen. And then it hit her that it was the same for him when it came to her dream. He knew long before she did that she would never deliver a baby. But he\u2019d stood aside and hoped she\u2019d arrive at that conclusion on her own. Outside, they worked in synchrony. Jess put Malcolm\u2019s phone on his car\u2019s charger first, said she didn\u2019t want to hear from anyone anyway. Not even Neil, Malcolm added in his mind. He shoveled while Jess used a broom to clear the car windows. What are we going to do? he thought over and over. What are we going to do what are we going to do what are we going to do? He knew she was asking the same. They discussed the weight and texture of the new snow, how it felt different from the heavy, sticky snow that had fallen on Friday. It was like they were in a play, acting like normal people, making their faces calm for the world. Jess asked Malcolm if he knew the Inuit people have fifty words for snow, and Malcolm reminded her that they watched that documentary together. \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d she said. Once the cars were clear, she went at the steps, at the windowsills. She reached up and waved the broom overhead to knock down icicles, one hand clutching the broom\u2019s handle, the other crooked over her head to shield herself. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you check my phone,\u201d he said, wincing as an icicle almost caught her in the eye. If he simply told her to stop, she wouldn\u2019t. He wondered where Neil thought she was. \u201cAnything?\u201d he asked, when she sat in his car to check. \u201cEmma,\u201d she said. \u201cShe said, \u2018How\u2019s it there?\u2019 \u201d Jess squinted over at him. \u201cDo you want me to reply?\u201d \u201cNah,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cAnything else?\u201d \u201cRoddy. Wants to know if he left his headphones at the bar. He said they\u2019d be next to the register.\u201d \u201cOh my God that kid. What else?\u201d \u201cMary. Wants to know where your Mom is. She\u2019s not answering the landline at home.\u201d \u201cCan you write back? Tell her she\u2019s fine. Tell her she\u2019s staying with a neighbor. Ask her if she remembers Artie Sheridan. Ask her if she remembers when his wife died.\u201d \u201cGail\u2019s staying with Artie Sheridan?\u201d Jess asked. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d \u201cIs it?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t think so? Come to think of it I stopped by there once and he was in the kitchen heating soup. She was upstairs and he called up to tell her I was there and that the soup was ready.\u201d Jess looked at the sky. \u201cI never thought about that until right now.\u201d \u201cWhen was that?\u201d \u201cTwo or three years ago I guess.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re friends. Good friends.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s attractive for a man his age.\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t they kind of old for that?\u201d \u201cGail in her old bras that make her boobs pointy. Her big underwear.\u201d \u201cPlease.\u201d \u201cI can see it. I\u2019m being serious right now, I really can. I\u2019m happy for her.\u201d \u201cBut she\u2019s been so forgetful. Have you noticed? The other day she said something as if she expected my dad home soon.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve noticed. Here and there. But, I don\u2019t know. Last week I spent five minutes looking for my phone and it was in my hand the whole time.\u201d \u201cI think this is different and Artie Sheridan isn\u2019t going to sign on for that,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cWhy would he?\u201d \u201cMaybe he loves her. Maybe he\u2019s loved her for a long time and we never knew.\u201d Was it possible? Malcolm wondered. The way he looked over at her and her crazy hair that she could never make lie flat the way the other mothers managed to do. Her button-down shirts that she bought in the men\u2019s section at Costco. The way he shook his head to signal Malcolm that he knew better, her chimney had not malfunctioned, but it was okay because he was there to set things right. After an hour or so the driveway was mostly clear. In the distance came the sound of steady beeping, growing louder as it moved toward them. \u201cIt\u2019s just the plow,\u201d Malcolm said, as he looked down the street. But behind the big town plow with its flashing orange lights was a police car. And following the police car was an unmarked SUV. \u201cOh,\u201d Jess said, suddenly pale. They left an ember behind without realizing. The place had lit up despite their change of heart. It was astonishingly dumb. One look at their financials and anyone with a brain would be suspicious. Malcolm immediately saw how guilty he would look, a fire just after they discovered Tripp was staying upstairs. The cars stopped at the end of their driveway. The plow stopped, too, and Jess was soothed by the sheer racket of it combined with the roar of the Colemans\u2019 generator. It felt like a physical barrier, like the drivers of these vehicles would actually have to press their hands to their ears to see her and Malcolm clearly. \u201cHow you doin?\u201d Malcolm called over, when it was clear theirs was the house they were aiming for. Jess recognized the female officer from around. The other two were trailing behind her, one of whom looked young enough to be in college. Malcolm shouted something to the driver of the plow, and next thing the beeping stopped. Immediately, Jess felt exposed. As the men in the SUV approached, she heard the female officer tell Malcolm that they were federal agents. \u201cThis is my wife,\u201d Malcolm told the group as Jess came up beside him. He glanced at her quickly as if to say if there was a different word for what she was to him, then he didn\u2019t know it. They had questions about Charles Waggoner, who still had not turned up, and Jess felt relief wash over her. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d she asked, but Malcolm said he\u2019d fill her in later. \u201cDid you ever confirm he was on that second flight?\u201d Malcolm asked. \u201cTo Panama?\u201d The agents ignored the question, and the local cops looked a bit sheepish, like maybe they shouldn\u2019t have told him so much. The two Feds asked how often Tripp came to the bar, whom he spoke with, his drinking habits, topics he went to, if he met friends there, if he ever talked about his job, if he ever talked about financial trouble, if he ever talked about a particular stress he was under or a decision he had to make. \u201cSorry, but no,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cI already told them\u201d\u2014Malcolm nodded at the three local cops collectively\u2014\u201cthat he talked about how much he hated living around here, the routine of work eat sleep repeat, you know, who doesn\u2019t feel like that? And that he seemed to have a dream of living in Peru. But specifics about work? No, nothing.\u201d They looked at him as if he might say more. Eventually, the shorter of the two offered a detail. \u201cHis partner was arrested this morning.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cIf you were in touch with Charles\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not in touch with him. He drinks at my bar sometimes. He was there on Friday. That\u2019s it.\u201d \u201cWasn\u2019t he staying at your bar? Upstairs?\u201d \u201cWell, we found some stuff.\u201d Malcolm looked at Jackie to help him out, but she gave him a look that said she couldn\u2019t. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it was his. I never go up there, which I guess someone knew. \u201cAnd also, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cBut he just didn\u2019t seem savvy enough to disappear. I always had the impression that he was pretty good at his job, which might seem crazy given that you\u2019re probably here to arrest him. And he was a know-it-all about some things, yes. But this stuff about checking in remotely and taking a flight north to go south, I just don\u2019t buy it. There was this one time, he was complaining about his phone\u2019s battery life and I told him to try closing all his windows and apps. He asked me how to do that. When I took his phone, there were like two zillion windows open. He said he\u2019d never closed one, not once, ever.\u201d Malcolm paused. \u201cSome guys would be sort of defensive because no one likes feeling dumb or out of date or whatever. Especially a guy like him who was heading up a big company. Most guys like that would be like, \u2018Oh, I kept those windows open on purpose, I love having a bazillion pages open on my phone.\u2019 \u201d Jackie laughed. \u201cBut Tripp just said technology wasn\u2019t his thing and thanked me for figuring it out. And trust me, if I know more about phones than he did, that\u2019s saying a lot.\u201d \u201cHe had help,\u201d the agent said. \u201cFor sure he had help. Which is why we\u2019re here.\u201d The agent walked to his car to get something and while they were distracted, Jackie whispered to Malcolm, \u201cHe looked into renting an apartment in Panama City. A company ran a credit check on him. He also looked into opening a Panamanian bank account.\u201d When the agent returned, he held out a driver\u2019s license. \u201cDo you recognize this man? We think he and Charles probably connected at the bar.\u201d Malcolm took the license from him, brought it close. An instinct kicked in and he made his face a blank, the face that drove Jess crazy. \u201cThe photo is pretty small.\u201d He could feel Jess at his side, also looking. The name on the license said Mark Duro. Tripp\u2019s insurance beneficiary. An address about an hour upstate from Gillam. \u201cDuro has a bunch of social media accounts. When you search his name you see references to past employment, a charity 5k he ran. But no photos. His profile pic on most accounts is some famous temple in Japan. The interesting thing is that one of the accounts\u2014the Facebook page\u2014liked a post about the Half Moon a few months ago. A Halloween party.\u201d \u201cReally,\u201d Malcolm said. He brought the license closer still, as if he could communicate to the face in the photograph, as if he could speak to him in his mind. Roddy. His hair slicked back. A dress shirt. Glasses. But it was Roddy. His heart was hammering. Jess was leaning on him hard. He handed her the license. \u201cIf it\u2019s fake it\u2019s a very good one,\u201d one of the agents said. \u201cIt was in a drop box he rented at UPS.\u201d \u201cDo you recognize the man on the driver\u2019s license?\u201d Jackie asked, looking back and forth between him and Jess. \u201cWould you remember seeing him on Halloween?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Malcolm said. He thought quickly. If they found out it was Roddy and that he worked at the Half Moon, then Malcolm would ask how they could expect him to identify a face when he was worried about the bar, and when his estranged wife was standing beside him, a fact that anyone would confirm. He had bigger things on his mind. And the Roddy he knew didn\u2019t look anything like the one in that photo. He made a mistake. \u201cYou sure?\u201d Malcolm shrugged. \u201cSorry.\u201d \u201cHow about you?\u201d she asked Jess. She shook her head. \u201cNo, me neither. But I\u2019m not at the bar much.\u201d Malcolm didn\u2019t dare look at her. He thought of Roddy clutching his phone, posting the Halloween party on five different social media platforms in under ten seconds. He was always looking at the thing, ordering this or that, figuring out new apps. He wasn\u2019t dumb, his uncle had emphasized. He just didn\u2019t seem to know how to apply himself. He remembered Roddy on Friday night, walking off into the storm in his ratty running sneakers, declining a lift because he preferred to walk. Mrs. Tyrell from a few houses down came outside in her bathrobe and snow boots to yell at the driver of the plow, to ask if he was aware that he had taken out her mailbox on the last go-around, said the town should reimburse people for that, what a pain in the ass, her husband had sunk the post in concrete and now it was splinters, he\u2019d have to dig the whole thing up. None of them could hear the driver\u2019s response, but his arm hung limply from the window of the cab, and whatever he said made Mrs. Tyrell even more angry. \u201cWe need you to call us if you remember anything else,\u201d the taller of the two agents said as he handed Malcolm his card. As the group broke up, the local officers made a plan to go eat. They mentioned two diners that were open as of that morning, and Malcolm made note of which one they decided on. Rob begged off, said he had to touch base with his mother and sisters about everything that was going on. As they made their way to their cars, Mrs. Tyrell called over to Malcolm and Jess. \u201cAm I right? Ridiculous the way they operate these plows. You guys don\u2019t have any damage?\u201d When the Tyrell boys still lived at home, the whole neighborhood used to hear her yelling at them. Then she shaded her eyes and called over, \u201cIs that you, Jess?\u201d and began making her way up the driveway. \u201cDear God,\u201d Jess muttered as Malcolm said, \u201cChrist.\u201d \u201cHow are you, honey? I haven\u2019t seen you in so long!\u201d Her long, bottle-red hair looked like it hadn\u2019t seen a brush since the first snowstorm. \u201cWant to come down to my house and sit by the heater? Have a visit? Jimmy has the kitchen snug as a bug. I can make you a cup of coffee? It\u2019s just Nescaf\u00e9 in the saucepan but it\u2019s hot.\u201d Malcolm waited for Jess to say no, to find an excuse. She looked exhausted, battle worn, pale. He thought of her at the hospital that time, the worst time, her legs in stirrups, the green of the paper gown harsh against her skin. How she looked beyond sad, like she had no life left, no fight. She didn\u2019t speak. She didn\u2019t cry. He saw her notice the tray of tools the physician\u2019s assistant rolled in, saw her glance at them once more when the doctor came in a moment later. But instead she said, \u201cI\u2019d love that. Give me a minute.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d Malcolm said when Mrs. Tyrell was out of earshot. Jess shrugged. \u201cSure. Why not?\u201d \u201cIf I go see about Roddy.\u201d Malcolm tried to think of how best to put it. \u201cWill you be here when I get back?\u201d \u201cYou think that\u2019s smart? Going straight to Roddy? Can you explain all of this to me please? Don\u2019t say it\u2019s nothing.\u201d \u201cI will. I swear. But not now.\u201d Backing out of his driveway, he realized she never answered his question. He tried to remember where exactly Roddy lived. He knew it was in one of the apartments where the railroad tracks crossed the creek, but which? It was not nice over there. People piled junk on their balconies, and the natural shingle that had probably looked fresh thirty years earlier was now black with weather. A big OxyContin dealer had recently been arrested from there; his name and mug shot went out over the local patch. Once he got to the parking lot, Malcolm texted Roddy, asked him to come outside if he was home. Three dots came up as if Roddy was typing a reply, but in the meantime Malcolm looked up, saw someone come to the window on the second floor. You there? Malcolm texted, and the figure stepped back. I\u2019m coming up, he wrote. Upstairs, the hallway smelled like cats and mildew. He knocked on the door he estimated to be the right one but heard movement in the apartment next door, so he moved down one door and knocked again. He leaned forward and could hear breathing on the other side. \u201cYou might as well open up,\u201d he said. The locks slid, a chain was drawn aside, the door opened. \u201cOh, hey, Malcolm,\u201d Roddy said, his hair the usual mess. He was wearing a long wool coat with a blanket draped around him like a shawl. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to drop them off.\u201d \u201cDrop what off?\u201d \u201cMy headphones?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d Roddy stared at him. \u201cHave you eaten?\u201d Malcolm asked, glimpsing the chaos of Roddy\u2019s apartment. \u201cI heard Slice of Life is open. Let\u2019s go see if they\u2019ll seat us.\u201d If it occurred to Roddy that he could decline, that Malcolm was not the school principal, not his dad, he showed no sign. He followed Malcolm to his car. They drove to the diner in silence, parked between two utility trucks. There was a coffee station outside for utility workers to refill their travel mugs, and the line extended to the edge of the parking lot. Inside, it was warm. Malcolm greeted Sebastian, the owner, made small talk for a minute, and then asked if he could get a table. Once seated, Sebastian waved over a waitress who was circling with a pot of coffee. They put in their orders so she wouldn\u2019t have to come back. Malcolm waited until the waitress walked away before he spoke. \u201cRoddy,\u201d he said, sitting square to the kid. \u201cDo you remember the guy giving us trouble on Friday night?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Roddy said, and Malcolm could see caution pass over his face. Like an animal he felt another animal circling. \u201cTripp.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the craziest thing. No one has seen him since then. I\u2019ve now talked to the police four different times in\u2014\u201d He looked at his wrist. \u201cFive days. Turns out he was in big trouble with the SEC, probably about to be arrested. Do you know why I\u2019m mentioning all of this to you?\u201d Roddy placed his spoon carefully next to his coffee and pushed the saucer away. \u201cThe cops know someone helped him, and now they have a driver\u2019s license with a photo of that guy,\u201d Malcolm continued. \u201cThey do?\u201d \u201cOh yes. They showed it to me not even an hour ago.\u201d \u201cI should have known you wouldn\u2019t come all the way over just to return my headphones.\u201d \u201cWhere is he? Panama or something? And how much of whatever this is got dreamed up at the Half Moon? Do I need to worry? Because I\u2019m a little worried.\u201d Roddy looked surprised. \u201cIs that where they think he is? Panama?\u201d \u201cYeah. It sounds like he rented an apartment there. He tried to open a bank account, and he used his passport as identification. For a guy who wants to disappear, he\u2019s not that good at it. He used his real name.\u201d \u201cWow,\u201d Roddy said. \u201cThey know about the bank account already? That\u2019s really good.\u201d Malcolm had already lied to the cops once. That one could be explained away, but another lie and he could be charged with a crime. He knew it, but it was hard to think that way with Roddy sitting across from him looking as he always did, so helpless, so guileless. When he hired him, Malcolm had promised Roddy\u2019s uncle that he\u2019d look out for him, but he hadn\u2019t, clearly, and now he was in this mess. Tripp had dragged him into something he probably didn\u2019t understand. \u201cHow in the world is that good?\u201d Roddy hesitated. \u201cFirst tell me how they found the license. Tripp was supposed to leave that in our spot.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s your spot?\u201d Roddy rubbed his chin. The waitress appeared at their table with more coffee, told them their food would be out shortly. Once she moved on, Roddy said, \u201cI guess I can tell you since you already saw the license.\u201d \u201cYeah I would think so.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be mad. It\u2019s at the Half Moon. Was. Upstairs. Nothing\u2019s there now, don\u2019t worry. No one ever goes up there. Tripp couldn\u2019t have it at home in case his wife found it.\u201d \u201cWhere upstairs?\u201d \u201cIn the bathroom vent. The cover pops right off.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d Roddy shrugged. \u201cSorry.\u201d \u201cThe cops saw Tripp\u2019s stuff.\u201d \u201cWhen? Did they see papers? Or a laptop?\u201d \u201cNo, just a bag. Clothes. Some books.\u201d Malcolm had so many questions it was hard to know which one to begin with. \u201cThey found the license in a box he rented at UPS.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d Roddy said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan here? You really thought you were going to pull this off with a fake license?\u201d Roddy stared at him for a moment. The waitress came over with their food. Bacon and eggs for Malcolm, chocolate chip pancakes for Roddy. When she walked away, Roddy asked, \u201cYou think I\u2019m dumb, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cWhat? No. Why would you ask that?\u201d Roddy shrugged. \u201cDid you tell them?\u201d \u201cTell them what?\u201d \u201cThat it\u2019s me. The license.\u201d What was with this kid that made Malcolm so annoyed. Yes I think you\u2019re dumb, he thought, but then he remembered the feeling in his belly when he watched the thin strand of smoke curl up toward the basement ceiling, Jess reaching for a second match. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cAre you going to tell them?\u201d Malcolm hesitated. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cTrust me, I do not know.\u201d Roddy dropped his chin and let out a long sigh. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cSo tell me.\u201d Something sparked in Roddy, a confidence Malcolm had never seen. \u201cMark Duro has pay stubs, tax returns going back ten years, a lease, his own company, a retirement account, a social security number, a passport. It took forever. Tripp picked up the license from my guy last week. I guess he put it in his box for safekeeping.\u201d Malcolm gaped at him. \u201cLook, Tripp\u2019s partner has already been arrested. You have to figure out how to bail out of this. How did it even start?\u201d \u201cHe approached me just a few weeks after I started working at the Half Moon. A year and a half ago I guess. I had a really bad night. You know that regular Emma calls Limp Bizkit? He called me a faggot when I asked him to settle up. He threw a fifty in my face.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cI would have banned him.\u201d \u201cYou would have banned him?\u201d Roddy smirked. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. You would have told me to deal.\u201d And Malcolm realized he was right. He thought about how Bridget regularly cried in the walk-in and he never made her feel bad about it. Was Roddy allowed to cry in the walk-in, too? \u201cHe threw the money in my face but it fell on the ground and I had to come around the bar to pick it up. It was embarrassing.\u201d Malcolm felt chastened but wasn\u2019t sure what to say. \u201cMe and Tripp got to talking. He seemed disappointed that his son ended up a local cop. It was important to him that I knew he earned a lot of money and that he\u2019d started with nothing. I didn\u2019t mind listening. He asked me what I\u2019m going to do with my life, if I\u2019m going to stick around Gillam. He warned me about getting tied down, how one little decision might mean I\u2019m trapped. I told him about my idea for an app. But what do I do with an idea? I can\u2019t call up Apple. I have to build it, but my mom won\u2019t help after everything that went down at school. And my uncle has helped enough.\u201d All around them, thanks to the warmth of the diner, people had removed their jackets and coats for the first time in days, and there was a vague scent of bodies needing to be washed. \u201cAnyway. I\u2019m good at research. Tripp wanted to disappear because of something to do with work, and he didn\u2019t love his wife anymore, and he said his kids are all on her side about everything. But to disappear you need a plan. You need a whole system that closes up on itself after every move. And you need money unless you\u2019re okay with living rough for a while. Tripp isn\u2019t the kind of guy who\u2019d take a job that doesn\u2019t require papers. He isn\u2019t going to sweep streets.\u201d Roddy\u2019s uncle was right. The boy was smart. \u201cI hope he paid you cash up front, because I think the Feds are about to arrest him.\u201d \u201cI plan to take my fee before I pass his money on to him. He can\u2019t rob me because it comes to me first.\u201d Malcolm felt dread spring up in his gut, and a slow dawning that the way things looked was not the way things were. \u201cIs he in Toronto, Roddy?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Roddy looked at Malcolm with such clear-eyed seriousness. \u201cI like Tripp, but I don\u2019t trust him. I mean, look at what he\u2019s doing to his family. I met his wife once. She seems like a nice lady. She raised their kids, stayed home with them, and he seems to think nothing of that, like it wasn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s so mad at everyone about. He wanted to just pay me a fee at first, half up front and half when it was all done. But I didn\u2019t believe I\u2019d ever get it. And I need this money to live on while I build this app.\u201d Roddy swirled his last sip of coffee around the bottom of his cup. Malcolm was shocked at the recklessness of it but also, at the bottom of that, impressed. There was far more to Roddy than he thought. \u201cWhat\u2019s the app?\u201d \u201cYou really want to know?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWell.\u201d He tried to boil it down. \u201cIt knows your mood and predicts your patterns before you realize you\u2019re in a mood or have a pattern. It takes in your searches, your social media\u2014everything from the amount of time you scroll, to the pages you pause at, to the speed at which you click. It listens to your conversations, reads your messages. It can tell how much you\u2019ve sat still or stood or walked in a given day. Based on all that data\u2014and it gets smarter over time\u2014it will start sending you messages after about a month of use. If I build it right, it will be like advice from a trusted friend. Don\u2019t have that drink. It\u2019s okay to skip your spin class. Don\u2019t cancel lunch with Becky because you need the social interaction. People will be shocked that the app knows what they\u2019re thinking of doing before they\u2019ve even really admitted it to themselves.\u201d \u201cYou can build something like that?\u201d \u201cYeah. I think so. But now the problem is there\u2019s already an app that\u2019s similar. Not quite the same but enough to make me nervous. I\u2019m sure there are more in development. I have to get going on this. Like I said, I need time and I need money. I\u2019ve been thinking about it for about three years now.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s where Tripp came in. So he\u2019s in Panama?\u201d Malcolm wished none of it implicated the Half Moon, but his curiosity was too strong. If he was going to lie, he wanted to know what he was lying about. Roddy hesitated. \u201cNot exactly. But\u2014\u201d \u201cBut?\u201d \u201cIf things go as planned, in about three days there\u2019s going to be a car accident in Panama City. There will be a fire. Charles Waggoner\u2019s body will be so burned up that they\u2019ll have to identify him by the papers left behind at his hotel room.\u201d Malcolm remembered a late-night documentary he saw once. Part of it was about the black market for dead bodies, how people trying to really disappear could arrange the purchase of a corpse approximately the same size, age, and gender, set things up to look like an accident, and next thing you have a death certificate for a trusted loved one to present to your life insurance carrier. \u201cThen where is he really?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I should tell you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve already told me this much.\u201d Watching Roddy decide, Malcolm saw that he wanted to tell him\u2014that he\u2019d probably been wanting to talk to someone about all of it for a long time. \u201cYou think I\u2019ll get in trouble? Is that it? Don\u2019t worry about me,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cHe\u2019s in Peru.\u201d Malcolm slapped the table. \u201cI knew it. He loves that place. He talked about it all the time.\u201d \u201cHe did?\u201d That was the first thing that seemed to alarm Roddy. \u201cYes. And I told the cops so. Every time he got lit he\u2019d talk about whatsitcalled. Ollan\u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014taytambo. Shit. I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d \u201cSo he\u2019s going from Panama to Peru?\u201d \u201cNo. He was never in Panama. Or Toronto for that matter. He flew directly to Lima yesterday morning, just a few hours before the second storm. He used his new passport.\u201d Before Malcolm could ask, Roddy answered the question on his mind. \u201cHe stayed upstairs at the bar on Friday night. That\u2019s why no one saw him leave. He just went up through that door by the men\u2019s room. Late Saturday I drove him to a hotel in Secaucus. He stayed there until he left for the airport on Tuesday.\u201d \u201cSo who packed up his stuff from the Half Moon?\u201d \u201cI did.\u201d \u201cBut the passenger list for that Toronto flight had him on it.\u201d \u201cCome on, Malcolm. You know that there\u2019s always someone who\u2019ll do what you need them to if you have the money to pay them.\u201d Malcolm looked at his plate, the food grown cold. He picked up his fork and slowly ate every morsel before he spoke again. He signaled the waitress to refill his coffee. \u201cRoddy. You know you can\u2019t ever claim that life insurance money. Right now you\u2019re just an accessory to Tripp\u2019s mess, but if you claim that money, you\u2019re as guilty as he is. You get that, right? Stay up in Binghamton with your mom for a while. Get a job there. You were never Mark Duro. You want a bartending job? I have a buddy in Ithaca who\u2019s always looking for help. You want to go down to Miami and bartend there? I have a friend with a place in Coral Gables. I\u2019ll put a word in. But honestly? You\u2019re not a bartender. Get a job at a cool store or something. You\u2019re only twenty-two years old.\u201d \u201cWhat would be a cool store?\u201d Roddy looked at him with the same expression he wore the night the urinal got pulled out. Overwhelmed, as if he might cry. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But you\u2019re a smart kid. Why don\u2019t you go back to school? You can still build the app.\u201d \u201cWhat does it matter? Being smart?\u201d Roddy asked. \u201cYou need way more than that. My uncle paid the first semester of college and my mother was supposed to take it from there, but she kept trying to get me to ask him for the money and he\u2019d already done so much for me. The bursar was calling me every day. Like, oh sure, I have seventeen thousand dollars rolled up in a coffee can or something. I got a job with a skip tracer to make some cash. When I learned how it worked, I took a few clients of my own. I liked it. I could do the whole job from my dorm room. I once found a guy who was delinquent for child support by tracking down his loyalty card at a tackle shop. All his ex said was that he loved fishing. But then\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s the flip side. You get some really bad guys looking for their wives or girlfriends. And I could find them. You know? I could see how hard a woman tried to cover her tracks, but it was so easy. I didn\u2019t like that. One guy, he just seemed evil. I wanted to reach out to the woman to warn her that she was way too easy to find, and to help her. I never told that guy that I found her.\u201d They both looked out the window at the dark space under the highway overpass. Kids drank there in the warm months, and there was a collection of broken bottles and crushed cans pushed against one of the pilings. A bright red cardinal alighted on a plow\u2019s blade, and Malcolm watched it look around for a moment before it flew away. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Roddy asked. Malcolm felt so incredibly tired. \u201cI really don\u2019t know. Are you?\u201d Roddy shrugged. \u201cSame I guess. The bar\u2019s not doing great, is it?\u201d \u201cNo it isn\u2019t. But promise you\u2019ll drop this thing. Will you? It\u2019s insane.\u201d \u201cHe really talked about Ollantaytambo? How dumb. He never told me that. I told him to go to Cambodia or Vietnam, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. He said his heart was in Peru.\u201d \u201cYes. Even if it takes a little while, I know they\u2019re going to figure that out.\u201d When Malcolm got home the house was empty. Jess left a note to say she was at her mother\u2019s but to call her because she wanted to hear what was going on with Roddy. The utility trucks had finally made it to their street; the linemen were up in buckets, working on the wires. Malcolm didn\u2019t want to ask them what everyone else had been asking, but one of them called out his name, took off his hard hat. Malcolm recognized him from the bar. \u201cLights on within the hour,\u201d he said. \u201cThank God,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cYou guys must be beat.\u201d \u201cLoving the overtime,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife is already pricing a trip to Turks.\u201d \u201cWhy not,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cYou\u2019ve earned it.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d the man said as he looked up the street. \u201cListen, there was a guy parked in your driveway for a bit. Asked if I\u2019d seen you.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t say who he was or what he wanted.\u201d Billy, Malcolm knew. When the power returned, it was a click and then a surge, and everything came alive at once. The microwave clock flashed. The oven showed an error message and the refrigerator started purring. He stood in the kitchen for a minute, and then he turned right around and left. \u201cHey, Ma,\u201d he said, standing at Mr. Sheridan\u2019s door. His mother invited him in like it was her house. \u201cI can\u2019t, the car\u2019s running. I just wanted to see if you\u2019re okay.\u201d \u201cArtie went over to check on the house,\u201d she said. \u201cHe went to see about the smoke.\u201d \u201cOh good,\u201d Malcolm said. She was wearing the same clothes she\u2019d worn the day before, but what had she worn to bed? Her hair was twisted up, pinned in some complicated way, but a fringe still stood straight above her forehead like a tiara. \u201cYou look exhausted, Malcolm.\u201d \u201cListen, Mom,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bar isn\u2019t doing so well. You might as well know that. I feel like a huge loser and I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t tell you sooner. I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d \u201cWhat? Would you please come in? Come in here this minute and don\u2019t say that.\u201d \u201cI have to go see Jess. I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019ll talk later. I\u2019ll come by. I promise.\u201d \u201cJess is back? Okay, but, Mal? Honey? You could never be a loser. I just said to Artie that something\u2019s wrong with Malcolm. I know everything with Jess and all that, but I said to Artie it\u2019s more than that, he\u2019s not himself at all.\u201d \u201cHi, Maureen,\u201d he said when he got to Jess\u2019s mother\u2019s house. \u201cMalcolm,\u201d Maureen said, solemn as a funeral director. She kissed him on the cheek and then she hugged him tight, something she\u2019d never done before. \u201cCome in. You want something to eat? You have power? Ours just came back.\u201d When he walked into the kitchen, he found Jess sitting at the table spreading jam on a piece of toast. Her hair was wet, and she was wearing the same Gillam High School sweats she\u2019d worn to breakfast the first time he stayed over. \u201cMalcolm,\u201d she said, astonished, as if he\u2019d traveled a thousand miles and not four blocks. She jumped up to take a stack of magazines off a chair, but he refused to sit. \u201cAre you staying here tonight, Jess? Or coming home? I thought I\u2019d check since you don\u2019t have your car.\u201d He sounded gruff. Formal. He could hear it in his voice, but he couldn\u2019t take it back. Jess looked at her mother, but Maureen Ryan was slowly backing up toward the stairs. A moment later they heard a door click closed up there. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d Jess asked. \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Had she called Neil? Had she filled him in? \u201cI want to come home.\u201d He nodded. Good. That was good. He sat heavily. He leaned over his knees. He felt her hand on his back. \u201cMalcolm,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \u201cThen come home,\u201d he said. \n eleven Malcolm got through the Thursday birthday party he\u2019d booked\u2014the power came back on at the bar in the nick of time\u2014but Andr\u00e9 couldn\u2019t make the appetizers the group had picked because their supplier was delayed by the double storms. \u201cI can run up to Food King,\u201d he offered. And when the whole staff looked at Malcolm, waiting to hear what he\u2019d say, he realized they\u2019d known for a very long time how precarious things were. It was one thing for him to live like that, but they had families and lives, too. \u201cGood idea,\u201d he said, plucking two twenties from his wallet. How much did a few boxes of frozen pigs in a blanket cost? Malcolm worried Billy would show up, but he didn\u2019t, and it ended up being a decent night. There was a lot of laughing, in any case, and the group stayed late. Roddy didn\u2019t show. \u201cHas anyone heard from him?\u201d Malcolm asked, but no one had, not since the previous Friday, the night of the first storm. Malcolm hoped that meant he\u2019d heeded his advice and taken off. When they were closing, Malcolm told Emma he\u2019d be out of town for a day or two, so she\u2019d be in charge. He was sorry to leave her stranded on a weekend. \u201cNot that you\u2019ll be running,\u201d he said. A joke, but it had no mirth behind it. \u201cYou never know,\u201d she said. A kindness. It was a plan that had formed that very hour, as he was cleaning up after the party and trying to figure out what to do. He couldn\u2019t wait around for Billy to show up at his house, not with Jess back home, not with things feeling like they might get better now. Surely, he had a card to play, if only he could come up with it. He had to see Hugh face-to-face. \u201cIf something else comes along for you,\u201d he added. \u201cAny of you. I\u2014\u201d \u201cHey,\u201d Emma said. \u201cYou think I\u2019d stay if I didn\u2019t want to be here? That any of us would? No.\u201d The next morning, Friday, a full week after the first storm, Malcolm drove Jess to the city to pick up her stuff from Cobie\u2019s. While Malcolm waited in his car, Cobie tapped on his window and said she just wanted to say hello. She\u2019d been walking the dog when she spotted him. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, slightly embarrassed when he remembered the last time they\u2019d spoken. \u201cGlad to have your guest bedroom back?\u201d he asked. She smiled. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten how much space she takes up for someone so skinny. How many sweatshirts does one straight woman need?\u201d Malcolm relaxed. It was fine. Cobie didn\u2019t think he was a jerk. She said she\u2019d like to visit sometime soon. Malcolm said they\u2019d like that, anytime, he knew how much Jess loved Cobie\u2019s boys, and he hadn\u2019t seen Astrid in ages. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a while, probably,\u201d Cobie said. \u201cDay by day right?\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d Malcolm said. It was something he\u2019d noticed himself. He was so happy to have her home, so completely relieved, that he was confused about why it also made him feel like something he\u2019d been wanting to say had been muffled. Like they\u2019d gone through so much, the worst period of his life, and within twenty-four hours old patterns were already emerging. Malcolm put an empty box of cereal back in the cabinet. Jess left her sneakers on the stairs where one of them would trip on them and break their neck. They were both swallowing all those petty domestic grievances, but neither one had any doubt that they\u2019d return. And then what? What did all the heartbreak get them if not a little wisdom? She wanted to ask him if he forgave her, he knew she did. But it wasn\u2019t a question he could answer, most likely for a very long time. Had she forgiven him? Patrick was almost as shocked at Jess\u2019s return home as he\u2019d been by her departure. \u201cShe\u2019s back in the house? You\u2019re back together?\u201d he was incredulous. Before Malcolm could answer, he added: \u201cWhy?\u201d And then he said sorry, but it just didn\u2019t make sense. They didn\u2019t have kids. There was no reason to stay together. And then he apologized again. Why? Malcolm thought. It was a good question. Another one he couldn\u2019t answer. \u201cBy the way,\u201d Patrick added. \u201cMe and Siobh\u00e1n, all of us, no one is talking to Neil. I had no idea\u2014\u201d \u201cI know, I know,\u201d Malcolm said. Day by day, like Cobie said. Eventually, the burden they were carrying would become lighter. \u201cI did things, too,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cThings that hurt Jess.\u201d \u201cBut not that,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cNo way would you have ever done that.\u201d Jess drove straight to Neil\u2019s after they dug out her car. Malcolm didn\u2019t offer to go with her, though she saw the thought cross his mind when she said she\u2019d see him at home later. She squeezed his arm to remind him that there was no reason to worry. Neil answered the door with a cold expression, and for a moment she thought he might not let her inside. He followed her around as she gathered her things, and told her it was stupid to go back to Malcolm, that she\u2019d already done the hard part by leaving, it didn\u2019t make any sense, that maybe she didn\u2019t want to be happy, did she ever think of that, that she was making a huge mistake. He told her he guessed he was wrong about her. He thought she was a smart, levelheaded woman who\u2019d married a man below her and out of loyalty and kindness had stayed with him far too long but in fact she was a drama-seeking woman just like his ex, just like all women, maybe, and he guessed she didn\u2019t care whom she hurt in her pursuit of attention. She was just another woman panicking about middle age and trying to grasp one last high, and that high had come at his expense. At the expense of his children, who\u2019d gotten to know her. And then he said he didn\u2019t mean it, he just didn\u2019t understand. But she didn\u2019t quite understand either. It was just something she knew. It was time to go home. She was truly, deeply sorry. He told her that no one would ever love her like he did. She wanted to say that she agreed, but that it wasn\u2019t relevant. No two people ever loved each other the same way. It was the kids she\u2019d miss the most, though she didn\u2019t say that, either, because it would hurt him for no reason. And it wasn\u2019t even that she\u2019d miss the real, actual kids but rather the idea of them. If she stayed, she\u2019d become a fixture in their lives. He told her to go, he didn\u2019t care, get the hell out. And then he tried to put his body close to hers and persuade her to stay. But that had lost all power over her, too, and she wanted to cry when she realized how lost she must have felt only a few short weeks ago. Everything about him that was different from Malcolm repulsed her now, and it had happened overnight. His build, the way he smelled, the texture of his skin. It wasn\u2019t his fault, but it wasn\u2019t her fault either. She missed Malcolm so much that she felt it in her muscles, in her blood. \u201cNow things are going to be so weird with Patrick,\u201d Neil said. \u201cNow they\u2019ll be weird with Patrick?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help herself: she laughed. The kids were back at school, finally, after so many days at home, and Jess considered leaving something behind for the girls\u2014a lipstick or a necklace. But in the end she decided it would be best to clear out completely, to leave no trace. While Jess was at Neil\u2019s, Malcolm drove over to Hugh\u2019s house in Gillam, but no one was there. He flagged down a neighbor and asked if he\u2019d seen Hugh lately, if he knew his address down south, but the man said the only people he ever saw at the Lydons\u2019 anymore were the landscapers and they hadn\u2019t been by since November. He went by Little Hughie\u2019s house next\u2014a huge, plastic-looking monstrosity\u2014but no one answered the door. He drove home and called a few of the regulars who\u2019d been coming to the Half Moon since Malcolm started there, but all of them assumed if anyone knew Hugh\u2019s new address it would be Malcolm. He realized how little he knew about Hugh, how little he\u2019d ever known. The few times he met Mrs. Lydon were when she came to the bar to decorate for Christmas. He\u2019d never been to their home or to their family parties, and they\u2019d never been to his. He was staring into space at his own counter when he heard something outside. His mother. She was leaving a box of donuts on the step. \u201cOh, hi, sweetie,\u201d she said when he opened the door. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to bother you guys.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s okay, Jess isn\u2019t here.\u201d His mother handed him the box, and he asked her if by any chance she knew of anyone who was friendly with the Lydons. Someone who might have kept in touch after they moved. The Lydons were around the same age as his mother, after all. They must have had friends who had nothing to do with Hugh\u2019s businesses. \u201cA woman in my gardening club is good friends with Josephine,\u201d she said. \u201cReally? Can you get their South Carolina address for me?\u201d \u201cI can try,\u201d she said. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d \u201cYeah everything\u2019s fine. Just bar stuff.\u201d \u201cEverything\u2019s fine? The other day, you told me the bar\u2019s not doing well, and you said you\u2019d come back and we\u2019d chat. But you never came back.\u201d \u201cI know. Sorry. There\u2019s so much going on right now and\u2014\u201d \u201cI want to ask you something and I want you to tell me the truth. I\u2019m your mother, Malcolm, and I\u2019ll know immediately if you tell me a lie.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cIs Hugh Lydon holding the note on the Half Moon?\u201d Malcolm didn\u2019t answer. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever tell me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cMalcolm, your dad and Hugh had a history. Did Hugh ever tell you that? I don\u2019t know all the details but I know it was a big thing. You and Little Hughie were only babies. I used to think that was why he took you under his wing when your father died, maybe to make up for something, but now\u2014\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWhat was it? Do you want to come in?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m meeting Artie at Pappy\u2019s. They\u2019ll give us a free glass of wine with our pasta if we\u2019re seated by five.\u201d Standing on his cold step with her knit hat pulled down to her eyebrows, the bright white snow made her eyes a vivid blue. Her hands were red. \u201cYou need gloves, Mom.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, and shoved her hands deep into her coat pockets. \u201cI only know parts of it because you know how your dad was, and it was a long time ago. I never told you because it was ancient history and you were doing well at the Half Moon, earning a living at least. And when you bought it, I assumed you were done with Hugh. From what I gathered back then, Hugh made a big bet. A really dumb bet, and everyone knew about it. He used to show up at Gephardt\u2019s every once in a while and get really lit, who knows why, little kids at home made him nuts maybe. He\u2019d opened the Half Moon but you can\u2019t really get drunk in your own bar, as you know. Anyway, he lost the bet, but they worked it out. That\u2019s what your dad always said about everything. \u2018We worked it out.\u2019 \u201d \u201cDad let him welch.\u201d \u201cNot a chance. No. He couldn\u2019t! That\u2019s just not how it worked. If he let him welch next thing everyone who owed him would think they could just walk away. I don\u2019t know what agreement they came to, but all I know is after it settled, he told Hugh to never show his face at Gephardt\u2019s again. And as far as I know, he never did.\u201d Malcolm took it in, tried to make this young, stupid version of Hugh fit with the Hugh he knew. \u201cThe Lydons lived a few blocks from us back then. Their house was so pretty and Josephine was proud. She invited a bunch of women over for sandwiches when they wallpapered their kitchen. Darren didn\u2019t like mixing worlds and he hated that Hugh used to drink down at Gephardt\u2019s sometimes. He didn\u2019t like that Josephine was sort of my friend. He kept certain parts of his business away from me and I didn\u2019t like to think about it too much if I\u2019m being honest. But I know he wouldn\u2019t have wanted to ruin someone so close to home, kids in the same school. Our marriage was different from yours. I wasn\u2019t as clueless as Josephine, but Darren and I didn\u2019t talk much about work.\u201d \u201cSo how\u2019d they settle it? Hugh must have paid up somehow.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Honestly. I\u2019d tell you.\u201d Two hours later, the box of donuts still taped closed on the counter, she called. \u201cI got the address. Do you have a pen?\u201d Malcolm wrote it down. \u201cAnd will you have Jess call me as soon as she gets home? I thought of something and I want to talk to her.\u201d \u201cAbout what?\u201d \u201cAbout none of your business. I\u2019ve missed her. I want to say hello.\u201d Jess said she was coming with him. He didn\u2019t want her to at first, but when he thought of her home alone and Billy coming around, he agreed. Two round-trip plane tickets would cost a fortune on such short notice, so they took fifteen minutes to gather a few things and then they drove through the night. She had to do a little work, she said, and connected something to her laptop to get an internet connection. After a rest stop where she made a few calls while pacing the refrigerated section of a Quik Mart, she moved to the backseat, and every time he looked in the rearview mirror, she was staring at her laptop or out the window. \u201cOkay to play music?\u201d Malcolm asked. \u201cYes, of course, sorry,\u201d she said. She climbed over the armrest into the front passenger seat. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for someone to call me back.\u201d \u201cAt this hour?\u201d Malcolm asked. \u201cA friend in records. She\u2019s doing me a favor.\u201d Malcolm was about to ask more but just then Jess\u2019s phone rang and she put on headphones to take the call. She said something about joint tenancy, the right of survivorship. If she were still at the firm, he would assume it was a case, but it didn\u2019t quite line up with the work he imagined she did at Bloom. The town where the Lydons lived was less than an hour from Charleston, a place Malcolm had always wanted to see but hadn\u2019t gotten to yet. Fort Sumter, the antebellum mansions, a sense of somewhere totally different. After fourteen hours in the car, they stopped at a gas station and washed up as best they could, put on fresh clothes. \u201cWhat are you going to say?\u201d Jess asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Malcolm said. The house was more modest than either of them expected it to be. It was nine o\u2019clock on Saturday morning, and Hugh\u2019s Cadillac was in the driveway, a cat sitting in the shade of the bumper. By the time Malcolm turned off the engine, Hugh was standing at the door. From a distance of forty feet, he looked like any overweight old man. Why had it come to this? Malcolm wondered as he felt the long fuse of his temper ignite. Hugh could have just answered his phone, returned his call. They could have come to an agreement. But Hugh wanted him to beg, Malcolm understood. He wanted Malcolm to feel a little ridiculous. Maybe that\u2019s all he ever wanted, making Malcolm wait so long for the chance to own the bar. How long between Hugh first mentioning it and actually walking away? Twelve years of hoping and expecting it to happen any day. A place that meant so much to him that he didn\u2019t realize it was on its last legs. \u201cWait here,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cNo way!\u201d Jess said. \u201cMalcolm,\u201d Hugh said, holding the door open for them. He turned to call into the room behind him, \u201cJosephine, look who came to see us.\u201d Neither of them seemed the least bit surprised. \u201cIs your phone broken, Hugh?\u201d Malcolm said, and felt Jess press his arm. Josephine Lydon showed them to a screened porch out back, where there were several ashtrays filled with butts. The temperature was already near seventy and muggy. Hugh settled into an armchair, and Josephine asked if anyone wanted tea. Hugh seemed heavier than he\u2019d been in New York and had a rosy sheen on his skin. Malcolm had never before seen him in shorts, short sleeves, his dimpled joints, the coarse rust-colored hair that covered him. \u201cNow,\u201d Josephine said when she\u2019d arranged muffins and teacups. She looked at Jess. \u201cWill we leave them to it?\u201d \u201cThank you, but I\u2019m fine here,\u201d Jess said. \u201cOh,\u201d Josephine said, and looked at Hugh. \u201cJess,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cMalcolm,\u201d Jess said. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Hugh said, and Josephine disappeared somewhere inside the house. \u201cI hear you\u2019re having some weather up there.\u201d \u201cThe whole town lost power for almost a week and it\u2019s crazy cold, single digits. Everything is shut down. Part of the high school roof collapsed.\u201d Jess looked back and forth between them as if to ask if they were really talking about the weather. \u201cBut the Half Moon is okay? Didn\u2019t I tell you that place had good bones?\u201d Malcolm nodded, took a breath. \u201cI assume you\u2019re here because you can\u2019t keep up with your end of our deal. I\u2019ve been in touch with Billy. I don\u2019t understand. When I stepped away, the place was doing great.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not trying to get out of anything. You know me. You know I wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cI just thought, given how long we\u2019ve known each other, if you could make the monthly payments lower, or if we renegotiated the interest. You told me that I\u2019d get grandfathered into your vendor contracts and I took your word for it. But you must have known that would be impossible.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t do your research before making an investment so big?\u201d Hugh said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s my fault that you didn\u2019t? I heard you got rid of the pool table. People loved that thing.\u201d \u201cIt was filthy,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cAnd it took up too much room.\u201d And then Hugh turned his attention to Jess for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you here, Jess. Aren\u2019t you living over in Azalea Estates now?\u201d Jess looked stunned, and her face flushed a deep red. Malcolm spoke quickly. \u201cI was thinking we could work out a percentage of what I bring in each month. Slow months you\u2019d get less, okay, busy months more, but you\u2019d always get your cut and then I\u2019d chip away at the note and you\u2019d have income. The way it\u2019s structured now\u2014I just can\u2019t do it. I need time to come up with a strategy to bring people in and build a little buzz. None of the usual things are working.\u201d \u201cSlow months I\u2019d get nothing, is what you mean.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying, Hugh. You\u2019ll get everything you\u2019re owed, it\u2019ll just take longer than I thought.\u201d \u201cOr,\u201d Hugh said. \u201cYou could sell your house. You\u2019ve owned it for what? Thirteen years? Values have gone way up. There must be quite a bit of equity. That would take care of it.\u201d \u201cMy house?\u201d Malcolm repeated. His house wasn\u2019t part of Hugh\u2019s world. His house was Jess\u2019s domain, all her patterned throw blankets and bowls, all the vases and candles she placed around to make it look sweet. Her stacks of books. Her running pants on the drying rack. He stood up as he took in what was happening, as it sank in that he was powerless in this situation, and anything he suggested would be received with total disregard, as if no one had made the suggestion at all. Nothing mattered to Hugh. Not their long history, not the fact that he\u2019d been his best, most loyal employee for so many years. \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole, Hugh, you know that? I don\u2019t get what the point was. Of any of it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the house is your only asset. I\u2019d never have lent you that money if you didn\u2019t have it.\u201d \u201cHugh?\u201d Jess said, but the men ignored her. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the asshole?\u201d Hugh went on. \u201cYou think you deserve something better than what you got? You\u2019re every bit as arrogant as your father was. You\u2019re what? Forty-five years old? You\u2019re blaming me because you don\u2019t have your life together? Hughie says you were always decent to him when you were in school together, and I appreciate that. But if one of my boys failed as miserably as you did with the Half Moon, I\u2019d be embarrassed to know him. At least your father knew what he had to do to make a place really work.\u201d \u201cHugh,\u201d Jess said again with some force. She stood, stepped in front of Malcolm. Hugh looked at her like he might look at a child who\u2019d walked in and interrupted the adults. \u201cAre you completely sure you were within your rights to sell the Half Moon in the first place?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Hugh said. Malcolm could feel the momentum that had been building skip a beat. He felt a chill, as if a ghost had come striding through. \u201cIf I were to pull the property records right now, are you sure I wouldn\u2019t see any names except yours and Malcolm\u2019s?\u201d It seemed for a moment like Hugh was going to heave his giant body to standing, but instead he stayed seated, looked at Jess. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \u201cThe land the building is sitting on.\u201d The land, Malcolm repeated in his mind, the words becoming tactile, like something he could touch. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d Hugh asked, but Malcolm knew that sneer. Something about what Jess was saying had him rattled. \u201cYou signed the land over to Darren Gephardt in 1975 to make good on a debt.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Hugh asked just as Malcolm had the very same thought. What? Malcolm wanted badly for her to look at him, but her eyes were locked on Hugh. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Hugh said, glancing at the screened door to find out if Josephine was listening. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come up in the sale probably because Malcolm didn\u2019t hire a lawyer. Things get missed, especially if an ownership structure is rare, like this one. Just yesterday I found out about a case in Manhattan where this exact thing happened. The current owner of a bar called Bluebird did a bunch of really nice renovations when he bought the place, and everything was great. But then one night he kicked out some jerk who was acting up, and that guy was embarrassed and furious. Turns out the jerk was a property lawyer\u2014that was the owner\u2019s bad luck\u2014so he decided to dig into the old city records to mess with the owner. And jackpot! The owner didn\u2019t own the land under his building and he had no idea. It never came up when he bought the place. The land had been sold off back in the 1980s and had its own deed. So the new owner panicked, hired a lawyer. He was furious and felt he\u2019d been swindled, which he sort of had been. He had his lawyer track down the owner of the land to make it square. Problem was the man he bought the building from was dead and the owner of the land was dead by the time it all got figured out.\u201d \u201cBluebird,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cI\u2019ve been there.\u201d \u201cYou want to know who owned the land?\u201d Jess asked. Hugh stared at her. \u201cDarren Gephardt.\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cI remember going there with him.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d Jess said, turning to Hugh again. \u201cDarren gave the owner of Bluebird the same deal he gave you in the seventies. He couldn\u2019t let you welch because everyone knew about it, so he took something that wouldn\u2019t ruin or humiliate you. Gail only found out about Bluebird recently. The new owner\u2019s lawyer got in touch with her when they were tracing Darren\u2019s next of kin. I think Gail felt sorry for the guy, so she settled easily. I wish she\u2019d told us it was happening, but she said she didn\u2019t like discussing certain aspects of your dad\u2019s businesses. Talking with Malcolm yesterday got her thinking, so she suggested I look into it.\u201d Jess turned to Malcolm. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to get your hopes up.\u201d To Hugh she said, \u201cYou legally separated the land from the building in 1975.\u201d \u201cSo what?\u201d Hugh said. He tried on his normal bravado, but Malcolm could see he didn\u2019t quite fit. \u201cSo here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Jess said, looking back and forth between the two men. \u201cMalcolm is going to sign that land over to you, and you\u2019re going to take the whole thing back. Land, building, business. It\u2019s all yours. But we\u2019re clear. That land is worth at least as much as what Malcolm owes you.\u201d \u201cHang on, Jess,\u201d Malcolm said, pulling on his shoulder. Didn\u2019t this mean he could keep the Half Moon somehow? But the look she gave him told him to think, to unspool it all the way out. \u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d Hugh said. \u201cYou\u2019ll get your bar back without that caveat you\u2019ve been hiding all these years. If you\u2019d sold to anyone else, they probably would have discovered it. It\u2019s a good deal. You can keep it or resell it, whatever you want.\u201d Malcolm felt he was taking everything in on a delay, two beats behind the action. Just hand over the Half Moon? Hugh appeared to be thinking about it. \u201cYou\u2019re saying I clear your debt and take title of the land.\u201d \u201cCorrect.\u201d \u201cMy lawyer draws everything up.\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d Jess said. She\u2019d be ready for any funny business. \u201cMalcolm?\u201d He\u2019d walk away with nothing. Not the Half Moon, not the time and energy he\u2019d already invested in it. Just before the first storm he\u2019d taken a photo of his TV screen at home as he was watching a movie. The premise of the movie was dumb but the scene showed the characters seated at a rooftop just like the one he imagined. He needed a few days to think. He wanted to talk to his mother about what else she remembered about his dad and the deal he\u2019d made with Hugh. But Jess\u2019s expression when she turned to look at him read like a plea. \u201cMalcolm,\u201d she said, not a question this time. \u201cLet me think for a second.\u201d \u201cMal, please.\u201d \u201cYeah okay,\u201d Malcolm agreed. Hugh said the paperwork would be waiting for them by the time they got back to New York. The taxes would get complicated, but Jess could figure that out. They approached the exit for downtown Charleston, and Malcolm reminded her it was Saturday, they couldn\u2019t make it all the way home anyway without getting some sleep, why not make this the place they stayed? As they were driving, Malcolm asked how in the world she\u2019d figured it out, but she gave all the credit to Gail. She\u2019d researched, yes, she\u2019d used her contacts, but it was Gail who had a hunch. And the crazy part, she said, was that she hadn\u2019t been sure. Her contact in the county records office hadn\u2019t found the document she needed by the time they walked into Hugh\u2019s house. Records from the 1970s were in off-site storage and predated the electronic files. All her friend could see was a note that read \u201c1975\u201d and a code that indicated what box the records could be found in. So Jess just assumed that meant there was a transaction of some kind in 1975. \u201cYou were bluffing,\u201d he said, amazed. \u201cBut I was right.\u201d She grinned. \u201cJessica Ryan!\u201d he said, grabbing her hand as he merged onto the highway. He kissed her knuckles. He\u2019d lost the Half Moon, but he\u2019d regained Jess, and all of that had happened in a matter of days. It was almost too much, how quickly things could change. He wanted one day out of his own life to process everything, one day of wandering around a place where he didn\u2019t know the streets or anyone\u2019s name. Jess didn\u2019t have to be at work until Monday, and Malcolm didn\u2019t have to be anywhere, apparently. He tried to let that fact sink in, but it was impossible. They went to breakfast while they waited for their room to become available\u2014it was only eleven in the morning after all\u2014and could barely keep their eyes open. When they were finally allowed to check in, they immediately went to sleep. Jess woke first, confused about where she was since it was still daylight out, and then she turned to find Malcolm sleeping on his side, facing her, his jaw slack, his hands tucked under his cheek like a little kid. She studied the graying hair at his temples, the breadth of his rib cage as it expanded and contracted with his snores. She tried to decide whether she\u2019d ever really stopped loving him or if she\u2019d just convinced herself that she had. She believed her love had run out because that was how it felt\u2014a petering out over a long, long time, an exhaustion settling in the space that used to be taken up with joy, and then one day finding a thought of him stirred nothing in her, not even fury, and who was it who said the opposite of love was not hate but apathy? But yet here she was, beside him again. She thought of what Cobie said about there being a third choice, which was being alone for a little while. That there were more choices than the ones she\u2019d set before herself. A mere week ago she had no expectation of when she\u2019d next see him, and here she was watching him sleep, in a hotel room eight hundred miles from home. She stepped into the shower and when she came out, Malcolm was awake. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, and tugged at the edge of her towel until finally she let it fall. As they moved around each other, she tried to decide what was different, what he was holding back from her now that he\u2019d never held back before, but there didn\u2019t seem to be anything except maybe a new seriousness, a sense that they\u2019d come very, very close to losing each other, and also, underneath all of that, a sense that they still might, nothing was guaranteed. Once they were dressed, they wandered until they found a restaurant that had a good vibe, as Malcolm put it, and as usual he chatted up the bartender. A band started playing almost as soon as they sat, so they didn\u2019t have to talk. After dinner they walked back to the hotel, watched a movie, slept. The next day, she spent the long drive home trying to convince him that it was a win. He\u2019d had a job for twenty-six years, and now he was stepping away from that job, and that was it. A lot of people stepped away from their jobs after twenty-six years with nothing of the place where they\u2019d worked all that time. He\u2019d get something else. Without that massive pressure on them, they could pay down their debt with the clinic, their credit cards, Jess\u2019s student loans. \u201cWe could sell our house,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cIf you really want to talk about starting over. Hugh isn\u2019t wrong. It\u2019s worth something.\u201d The same thought had occurred to Jess. The paperwork was waiting for them, as promised. When Malcolm told his staff at the Half Moon that Hugh was taking over again, that the place would likely close for a while, he thought they\u2019d be angry with him, but instead they wanted to comfort him. They all told him to let them know if he ended up opening a new place. Malcolm took a few of the framed photos that meant something to him. He told the rest of them to take what they wanted. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Emma asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Malcolm said. The snow melted, though enormous dirt-encased hills lasted in parking lots until late April, taking up crucial spaces at Food King, at the mall. His mother told him more of the story when he got back from South Carolina. \u201cYou were still in a playpen,\u201d she said. Gail remembered him pressing his fat cheek against the netting while Darren told her what a dumb loudmouth Hugh was and how he\u2019d gotten himself into a situation. According to Gail, Hugh had never liked Darren and for some reason always acted like he had something to prove when he was around him. \u201cAnd did Dad like Hugh? I mean before this dumb bet?\u201d \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think he thought anything about him at all.\u201d Malcolm avoided driving down Seneca, but one morning he turned out of habit. Already the building was under construction\u2014a major renovation from the looks of it\u2014a chain-link fence circling the lot. He thought signing the place over would feel like amputating a limb, but all it had taken were five minutes and a few signatures. The land was a bit more complicated. Darren\u2019s next of kin was Gail, so it was Gail who had to sign it over. When Malcolm apologized, said he\u2019d make it up to her, she shushed him, said if he\u2019d only told her how he\u2019d been struggling, she might have thought of it much sooner. Now, several weeks after the paperwork was finalized, he pulled over to look more closely, and without realizing he was doing so, he clutched the steering wheel. He was still there, and he was still Malcolm, no matter what was becoming of the Half Moon. How had Hugh gotten plans drawn up so quickly? He made himself think of the dozen mousetraps in the basement\u2014the ones that smelled of rotted flesh if he didn\u2019t find them right away, and the mice that shrieked for hours until they died\u2014and he then made himself find some gratitude that he\u2019d never have to deal with them again. Siobh\u00e1n said to each of them separately that she was glad they\u2019d worked it out. She said it to them together, too, one night when they were hanging out in Jess and Malcolm\u2019s backyard. A test run, as Jess described it, to see how their friends would be. She ran into a few of her other girlfriends, and most seemed a mix of nervous and sympathetic. She went for a run one morning, and a couple she knew crossed the street when they saw her, pretended to be examining a tree so they wouldn\u2019t have to look her way. On the night that Siobh\u00e1n and Patrick came over, they left their kids at home with instructions that if there was an emergency to just run over to Malcolm and Jess\u2019s. Siobh\u00e1n joked that there was probably already blood on the walls. Jess made stuffed jalape\u00f1os and bacon-wrapped dates, and kept jumping up to refresh drinks. They talked. They laughed. But Patrick never addressed Jess directly. \u201cHe won\u2019t even look at me,\u201d she said to Malcolm when they passed in the kitchen. \u201cWell,\u201d Malcolm said, and raised his shoulders as if to ask if she could blame him. \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d \u201cSorry. It\u2019s hard.\u201d Later, they cleaned the dishes side by side at the sink. They\u2019d had a nice enough time with their old friends, had a few laughs, but Jess felt grief hanging in the air among the four of them. Malcolm insisted their larger circle would come around eventually, but Jess wasn\u2019t so sure. Some friends\u2014two to be exact\u2014reached out to say they hoped she was okay and if she ever wanted to talk. Jenny, whose birthday Jess had been celebrating the night she and Malcolm met all those years ago, was one of them. She was divorced now, living in Toms River, and emailed to say that people having opinions about what happened even though they didn\u2019t have the first clue would be the hardest part, but that Jess should just remember that they don\u2019t know anything, it was no one\u2019s business but hers. \u201cJenny,\u201d Jess whispered aloud when she read that, and it stopped her breath to think what she must have gone through to have gained that wisdom. And where had Jess been for her? Nowhere. Jenny had gotten pregnant so young. They\u2019d drifted apart. When they finished drying the dishes after Siobh\u00e1n and Patrick left, Malcolm leaned back against the counter and looked at her. They were paying more attention to each other lately, as if all past assumptions were open to question. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked. It had been six weeks since she moved back in, six weeks since their trip down to South Carolina. Malcolm\u2019s phone rang, and he glanced at the number quickly before declining. \u201cWho\u2019s that? Kinda late.\u201d \u201cDo you remember Adrian? He\u2019s called a few times.\u201d \u201cWhat does he want?\u201d \u201cTo catch up, I\u2019m sure. He has a place down in St. John. Apparently it\u2019s doing pretty well.\u201d Jess tilted her head, looked off like she did when she was thinking. \u201cYou know?\u201d she said. \u201cYou should call him back.\u201d Malcolm shaped for per diem work with the sandhogs. He was a little on the old side, but he had a hook, and he appreciated the money. He liked the chumminess between the guys, but it was so vastly different from the work he was used to. There was no performance to it. No electric energy. It was just getting to the end of eight hours and then doing it again the next day. Owners of other bars who knew he was free called and offered him shifts, but he couldn\u2019t face it yet, slinging drinks in a place that wasn\u2019t his, taking his cut of the tips again like he hadn\u2019t ever held his dream in his hand. On days he didn\u2019t get work he went to the gym, got his paper and coffee, and then drove over to the Half Moon, to see how the renovation was progressing. Emma worked at a place in upper Manhattan and was dating a sommelier. Andr\u00e9 had been hired as sous chef at a place much nicer than the Half Moon. No one had heard from Roddy, and Malcolm decided no news was good news. Sometimes, out of nowhere, he thought of Patrick\u2019s question and the astonishment in his voice when Malcolm told him that Jess had moved back in, that they were staying together: Why? They heard that Neil put his house on the market. His kids would complete the school year in Gillam, but then he was moving to Westchester, to be near his mother, who would watch them after school. Jess heard it from Siobh\u00e1n, who heard it from some other parents. Siobh\u00e1n added that she never said hello to him if he was at pickup. She\u2019d noticed other parents had followed suit, maybe sensing her dislike of him. \u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Jess said as a wave of shame came over her. \u201cDon\u2019t mobilize people against him.\u201d These waves came at moments she expected but also out of nowhere, and sometimes left her momentarily paralyzed. She was reaching for a bag of coffee beans at the grocery store one recent morning when a woman passed by pushing a cart with a boy around Ethan\u2019s age sitting up top. It hit her, what she\u2019d done, and she withdrew her hand from the coffee like she\u2019d been bitten. The reverberations went on and on. Patrick said to Malcolm, \u201cThank God he\u2019s leaving. You won\u2019t have to worry about running into him.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the one who should be worried,\u201d Malcolm said, but almost every time he went to Dunkin\u2019 or the deli or any of his usual spots, he searched for a white SUV in the lot. And if he spotted one, he kept driving. One morning, late May, Malcolm ran into Jackie Becker at the bagel shop. She was in plainclothes, her day off, and he didn\u2019t recognize her until he lined up behind her and she turned. \u201cMalcolm,\u201d she said. \u201cI was thinking of you the other day.\u201d \u201cOh yeah? What\u2019s going on with the investigation? I\u2019ve been curious.\u201d She turned to face him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear? Charles Waggoner was killed a few weeks ago. An accident in Panama City. He was in a taxi.\u201d Malcolm\u2019s stomach seized. \u201cThat\u2019s insane. After putting together that plan he had?\u201d \u201cExactly. The Feds have their doubts. I think Rob has his doubts, too, but the family is fighting for the insurance money, so having an actual death certificate makes it a lot easier.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cMakes sense. Seems like it would be an easy fight, no? Given all the evidence of a fraud in the making?\u201d \u201cYou would think so, but\u201d\u2014she shrugged, was looking up at the sandwich menu\u2014\u201cit\u2019s entirely with the Feds now, so I don\u2019t have the full story but I think it got pretty complicated once Mark Duro filed. There was a tiny window\u2014if he\u2019d waited another few days the case would have been flagged up the line\u2014but he filed and got a partial payment. Apparently when a policy is beyond a certain dollar amount, they release some of it immediately and the balance a month later. So the rest is being held but, boy, he got a chunk.\u201d \u201cSorry. What?\u201d \u201cWhat what?\u201d \u201cMark Duro did what?\u201d \u201cFiled his claim. Got a partial payment.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m confused.\u201d Jackie looked at him closely. \u201cI assume he\u2019s out of the country at this point.\u201d She leaned over the counter to order her sandwich. Malcolm tried to remember if someone told him that Roddy was staying at his mother\u2019s or if that was something he\u2019d decided in his own mind. \u201cBut the reason I thought of you was because I was at a rooftop bar the other weekend. There was this wall of ivy, and when I peeked around to see what it was hiding, there was this really ugly parking lot below. I thought of what you said about a rooftop bar at the Half Moon. I saw it\u2019s under construction. You going for it?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he said. This had been happening lately. \u201cI sold, actually.\u201d \u201cAre you opening a new place?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m still figuring it out,\u201d Malcolm said, stepping forward for his food when they called his name. But as she turned to leave, he stopped her. \u201cWill they catch him?\u201d \u201cCatch Duro?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cHonestly? I doubt it. They\u2019re interested in Duro only insofar as he might lead them to Waggoner, but from what I understand, it\u2019s cheaper for the insurance company to just eat a fraudulent claim than hire an investigator to chase a ghost all over the world. Waggoner\u2019s old partner is in prison. He insists that Waggoner is alive and probably living in Peru. They seem way more interested in that.\u201d Walking to his car a moment later, his coffee warming his hand, he scrolled through his phone to call Roddy\u2019s uncle. \u201cHe\u2019s traveling,\u201d the uncle said, and Malcolm heard frustration in his voice. \u201cBackpacking through Asia. There\u2019s some famous route. I honestly don\u2019t know what to do about this kid, Mal. What\u2019s he doing with his life? He\u2019s lost. I tried to help him but he won\u2019t listen. He warned us we wouldn\u2019t hear from him for a while, but I can pass on a message when we get word?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Management offers came in but he declined. He bartended the wedding of a friend of a friend, and they handed him a nice stack of cash at the end of the night, so he worked two more weddings. He looked at a place in Yonkers that was for sale. Another in Riverside. Both were total wrecks. He didn\u2019t even know why he\u2019d gone to look. They were a long way from making that leap again. On the way home from the place in Riverside, he stopped to watch a Little League game on the field where he\u2019d grown up playing. The boys were young, maybe nine or ten. In another life he\u2019d be standing among the dads, coaching first base, maybe keeping the book. In another life he\u2019d watch his boy walk up to the plate and hope he remembered the speech he\u2019d given him about courage, the fortitude and mental strength it takes to keep trying your absolute best. He remembered stepping up to the plate as a kid, already having struck out twice, wondering what the hell he was doing, how embarrassing, standing up there by himself just so twenty kids could watch him whiff again. And then, a moment later, connecting, the perfect thwack of bat to ball, the feeling of rightness in the palms of his hands as the ball flew down the third base line. \u201cAre you happy?\u201d he asked Jess one night after she came home from work and changed into leggings and a hoodie. He made salads and had roasted a chicken. It was Memorial Day weekend, warm; they decided to eat outside. It was the exact question she had asked him years ago and he hadn\u2019t known what she meant. He told himself on the day she came home that whenever he was in doubt, he\u2019d ask. \u201cI think so,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m working on it. I don\u2019t regret being here if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t what he meant, exactly. \u201cDo you ever think about what Tripp pulled off?\u201d Malcolm had been checking the papers to find out if there was news of his arrest. He googled Charles Waggoner and Mark Duro and Roddy Horan almost daily. He searched Tripp Waggoner and Roderick Horan and also Rodney because he\u2019d never asked what Roddy was short for. He searched Tripp\u2019s company. He tried to understand Tripp\u2019s crimes. Jess looked surprised. \u201cNo. Do you?\u201d \u201cAll the time. Almost from the moment I wake up until the moment I fall asleep. He has a totally different life now, wherever he is. We would have heard if he\u2019d been caught.\u201d He kept expecting to see Roddy\u2019s face on the news. His dumb T-shirts. He kept thinking of how disappointed his uncle would be, how he\u2019d decide that the kid\u2019s father was right about him after all. \u201cYou really do?\u201d \u201cYup.\u201d \u201cYou have to pay attention to that.\u201d \u201cI know. I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at.\u201d And then, the first week of June, he was at his mother\u2019s trying to remove some stubborn vines from her side yard when out of nowhere he thought of Adrian Walsh. He went inside to get a glass of water, and as he drank it, he looked through recents on his phone until he found Adrian\u2019s number. \u201cMalcolm?\u201d Adrian said when he picked up. \u201cAbout time. I\u2019ve been trying to get hold of you.\u201d Malcolm liked Adrian and had no idea why it took him so long to return his call. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s been a crazy few months. But I saw your place in Neat and I wanted to say congratulations. How cool is that?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I was calling about. But now it might be too late.\u201d \u201cToo late for what?\u201d Malcolm asked. Through the window, Malcolm watched his mother open a little spot in the dirt with her hand trowel. He watched her lower a zinnia into the hole, the perfect cube of roots and soil. He watched her pat the topsoil around it like she was tucking it in. Mr. Sheridan had dropped off the flats of flowers for her, left them on the back porch. \u201cHow\u2019d he know what to get?\u201d Malcolm asked when he saw them. Mostly zinnias and impatiens. Some marigolds. \u201cHow\u2019d he know what colors?\u201d \u201cI get the same every year!\u201d she said. \u201cOf course he knows!\u201d \u201cI have a possible opportunity for you,\u201d Adrian said. \u201cI know you\u2019re tied up with the Half Moon, but I think it might be worth your time to meet. At the very least we can hang out for a bit. I\u2019m actually in New York for my cousin\u2019s wedding.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not tied up with the Half Moon. I sold it. You didn\u2019t hear?\u201d \u201cNo. I heard it wasn\u2019t\u2014I heard it was struggling, to tell you the truth. That\u2019s why I thought of you for this job. That you sold is even better. Do you have an hour or two today? But it has to be today.\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d Malcolm said to Adrian. \u201cWhy not.\u201d Jess wouldn\u2019t be home until dinnertime. \u201cGreat. I\u2019ll meet you\u2014where? The Alibi Lounge?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m dressed to do yard work. Somewhere casual. How about Stella\u2019s?\u201d Malcolm liked their grilled cheese with tomato. As soon as he saw Adrian, he wondered again why he hadn\u2019t called sooner. Adrian was a nice guy, got along with everyone. He was smart, went to Fordham for college and started bartending for extra cash. Like Hugh always warned, cash was a siren song too seductive for mortal men, and Adrian fell prey. He graduated from Fordham and got a day job at a big ad agency, but quickly figured out he\u2019d give up a third of his salary in taxes. He\u2019d be better off bartending more instead of less. Malcolm couldn\u2019t remember why he ended up in Gillam, but he put in maybe four years at the Half Moon. Adrian showed Malcolm a photo of his baby daughter on his phone. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cYou and Jess?\u201d Adrian asked. \u201cNo kids, right?\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cJess is good though. Things are good.\u201d If Adrian had heard the Half Moon was struggling, he\u2019d probably also heard about Jess. Like all good bartenders, he had an excellent poker face. \u201cThat kind of makes it easier,\u201d Adrian said. \u201cMakes what easier?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll just get right to it,\u201d Adrian said. \u201cHave you ever been to St. John?\u201d The island was still recovering from being hit by two back-to-back category five hurricanes in September 2017, Irma followed by Maria. Adrian showed him photos of the devastation in general, and of what the property looked like when he started. Of course, Malcolm had already seen the end result in Neat. The place is doing really well, Malcolm recounted to Jess later. Jess gave him a look that said she\u2019d heard that one before. Adrian didn\u2019t own it, he managed it, and now the owner wanted his help opening a new spot in Maui. He already had bars in Anguilla and Turks and had plans to open one in the Maldives. He was looking into property by some famous lake in Guatemala. Ecotourism was booming. The owner was CEO of a technology company in the Bay Area. He had no interest in the day-to-day of his bars, but he loved the idea of having them, an antidote to the rest of his life. He knew an absent owner in a mostly cash business was asking for trouble, so he was careful. He ran his bars the way he ran his company, offered contracts and benefits, a housing allowance to salaried hires who had to relocate. He held annual meetings where the managers of all locations got together for a few days, shared ideas. He relied on the people he trusted. \u201cSo I\u2019d take Adrian\u2019s place in St. John now that it\u2019s up and running. A contract would protect us since we\u2019d be uprooting our lives. If it doesn\u2019t work out and he wants to fire me in six months, I\u2019m guaranteed a year\u2019s salary. We get free housing for one year. If it does work out, I\u2019d potentially be asked to stay or oversee opening one of the new places. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening to Adrian. \u201cOr,\u201d Malcolm added when Jess didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cI could be done once the contract is up.\u201d \u201cSo if you did this\u2014\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d come, too.\u201d He faltered as he searched for the right words. \u201cI mean, I hope you would. You kind of hate your job, Jess. I know you do.\u201d \u201cI hate the commute more than I hate my job. Besides, I can\u2019t just quit. We can\u2019t afford it.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t afford it here, you mean. But there? We\u2019d sell this house. We\u2019d live for free for a whole year. After that, yeah, okay, St. John is expensive so maybe we stay, maybe we go somewhere else. Don\u2019t they need lawyers everywhere?\u201d \u201cIt seems crazy.\u201d \u201cMaybe. But it\u2019s certainly not the craziest idea either of us has had lately.\u201d Jess grimaced, pretended to look behind her like he might be talking to someone else. \u201cI mean, everyone else here feels stuck. I hear it all day long. But us? We\u2019re not stuck like they are. So why are we here?\u201d Jess frowned. \u201cWhat about your mom?\u201d \u201cI know. I\u2019ve been thinking about her. All I\u2019m saying is that I don\u2019t want to look down the barrel of the same routine for the next forty years, if we make it that long. And I know you don\u2019t either.\u201d \u201cYou love your routine. I\u2019ve never known a single person who enjoys going to Food King on a Sunday afternoon except for you.\u201d Malcolm stood, started pacing. \u201cI do love it, you\u2019re right. But, I wouldn\u2019t be sorry to take a break from it. Can\u2019t a person want two things at once? I need to see something else. I need to go to a place where no one knows us. And with everything that\u2019s happened? I have to get out of here. I have to do one interesting thing. I have to hit the reset button.\u201d \u201cI get that,\u201d Jess said, leaning back to take it all in. She could tell he was already picturing himself in flip-flops, sand between his toes. If they left New York for a year, she\u2019d never get her position back. But she could already feel it: walking along a sunny street in a place she\u2019d glimpsed only once, a stop on a three-day cruise she\u2019d taken for someone\u2019s bachelorette. Somewhere no one knew them. \u201cAnd what? You just have to decide? This amazing job is yours for the taking?\u201d \u201cWell, I have to meet the guy. I have to interview. But I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get it.\u201d Jess stared at him for a moment, and then laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s unreal how cocky you are. You know that, right?\u201d Once they had all the information, Jess did a search of the owner\u2019s name and whistled after the first result. \u201cHe\u2019s a total nerd,\u201d she said, but then her eye caught on something. \u201cOh, he\u2019s from the Bronx. His dad was a bus driver. His mom died when he was a kid.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s like us,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cGive or take a hundred million,\u201d she said, though she knew what he meant. The owner\u2019s name was Noah Grayson, and he and his assistant had interviewed four candidates in total, flying each down to Key West for a day. Malcolm would be the fifth. The interview went pretty well, Malcolm thought. He answered their questions about budgeting, negotiating with vendors, keeping staff in line. He regaled them with stories about the Half Moon\u2019s wildest nights. He did less well when it came to questions about marketing and promotion. He had no familiarity with social media but he made them laugh at least. They had him make three drinks. Two to their specifications, one that Malcolm could improvise. They took a walk by the marina, and Noah asked him if he knew much about boating. Malcolm watched the boats bobbing in the water as he admitted he didn\u2019t. Then Noah asked where his favorite beach was. Malcolm said Beach Haven, New Jersey. \u201cI know Beach Haven. We used to go to Long Beach Island,\u201d Noah said. But Malcolm had said Beach Haven because almost everyone who named the nicest beach on the Jersey Shore said Beach Haven. It was a safe answer. And he didn\u2019t want to risk lying, pretending he\u2019d been somewhere he hadn\u2019t. \u201cSorry. That\u2019s not true. My real favorite beach is called Sunset Cove. My friend Patrick calls it Cigarette Cove. It\u2019s on a lake, about three hours north of the city. The beach itself is not nice, honestly, but I love it there. Maybe it\u2019s cleaner now. I haven\u2019t been there in a long time.\u201d Noah leaned back in his chair. \u201cNever heard of that one.\u201d \u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d \u201cWhy do you love it so much?\u201d But how could Malcolm explain love? \u201cFor you it\u2019s more about who you\u2019re with,\u201d Noah said. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat answer did the other people give?\u201d He got the call from Noah\u2019s assistant first thing the next morning. They wanted him to start in three weeks. As soon as Malcolm hung up with Noah\u2019s assistant, his mind immediately became a flip board of all the things he had to do. It stopped flipping when it landed on his mother, how he\u2019d leave her, if he really could. He\u2019d have to loop in Mary. He\u2019d have to have a frank conversation with Mr. Sheridan. He asked Noah\u2019s assistant if there was any flexibility on the timing, but they\u2019d delayed the decision already because it took Adrian so long to connect with him. \u201cI totally understand,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cThree weeks is plenty of time. I just need a day to think about it, okay?\u201d \u201cTake the weekend,\u201d the guy said. He was going to call Jess at work to tell her but decided to drive to Midtown and surprise her instead. He\u2019d never even seen her office and she\u2019d been there three years. \u201cYou\u2019re where?\u201d Jess asked when he called from the lobby. Then she told him to hang up and have the guard at the security desk call her. When he got his security badge and reached Jess\u2019s floor, she was there by the elevator waiting to lead him across the expanse of gleaming hardwood between the huge glass doors and her office. As she did, she noticed everyone they passed sit up straighter. He was tan from all the yard work, from his single day in Florida. He was trimmer than he\u2019d been in years. He smiled when she glanced over at him, and just like that every other man in the building looked pale and sickly from sitting too long under fluorescent lights. \u201cGuess what?\u201d he asked as soon as they got to her office door. He grabbed her at the waist, and her admin giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s like the boat story, Jessie. Remember I told you? When I tried to swim to the dock and the boat picked me up?\u201d \u201cHow is this like that? You mean the job? You got it?\u201d \u201cIt was always going to work out.\u201d Maureen Ryan thought the plan was a fine one, as good as any other, said she\u2019d be happy to look in on their house until it sold. She said she\u2019d probably end up leaving Gillam herself pretty soon. Her friends were all moving to the Villages in Florida, a fifty-five-plus community so big it had its own zip code. They were drinking Bloody Marys by eleven and whizzing around on golf carts all day. Dinner was a rotating potluck. No one ever wanted to stay home. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d end up moving there. If you guys had\u2014\u201d She stopped herself from explaining the rest. If they\u2019d had children. If she had a granddaughter a few blocks away who needed to be walked to school. But now. Gail Gephardt was surprised, seemed far less sure that it was the right thing. \u201cYeah?\u201d she said when Malcolm told her everything. \u201cWell, that came out of the clear blue.\u201d They were alone in her kitchen, the radio tuned to the Fordham station. She liked the Irish music program on Sundays. \u201cBut it sounds exciting,\u201d she said, though her voice was hesitant. \u201cAnd Jess will go?\u201d He saw worry in her face. He saw how many of her thoughts went to him, her boy. This was what having kids was like, he wanted to tell Jess. You worry sick over your child even when he\u2019s forty-five years old. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, and she looked relieved. \u201cOh good,\u201d she said, reaching over to place her hands on his ears and press. That had been their thing since he was little. \u201cYou were always such good company for each other, you and Jess. You used to chat out on the deck half the night. Remember? I used to love listening to you two. I\u2019m so glad you figured it all out.\u201d Patrick\u2019s question swept through his mind, as it often did now: Why? \u201cBut what about you? You\u2019ll be okay here?\u201d \u201cMe?\u201d she laughed. \u201cYou get confused sometimes. You know you do. What will you do when I\u2019m not nearby?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I get any more confused than anyone else. And if I feel a little mixed up, I\u2019ll call Artie. He\u2019s usually who I call anyway. I only call you if he doesn\u2019t answer. You\u2019re so busy, but Artie\u2019s always around. A year is nothing. At my age a year goes in a blink. Nothing will change in a year. And if you decide to stay longer\u2026\u201d She let the thought go unsaid. \u201cI don\u2019t want you sticking around here for me, kiddo. I\u2019d really hate that.\u201d \u201cYou call Artie first?\u201d Malcolm felt like he\u2019d stepped into a fog. \u201cMa, do you have something going on with Mr. Sheridan? I mean, like, something?\u201d \u201cLike something something?\u201d she said and shimmied her shoulders. She didn\u2019t have her bottom bridge in, so she covered her mouth as she laughed. He called Noah\u2019s assistant to tell them he accepted, and they immediately scheduled a call between him and their relocation coordinator. Later that afternoon, he was making a sandwich at the counter, the TV blaring, when he heard the name Charles Waggoner. Holding a folded slice of ham, he walked slowly into the living room and there was Tripp, being led down a dark sidewalk and into a waiting car, hands cuffed, a gray beard down to his sternum. The reporter said he\u2019d been charged with eight counts of fraud, money laundering, perjury, and theft. Authorities found him at an organic quinoa farm in the Sacred Valley, where he\u2019d been living under a false name and consulting as a wholesaler. They\u2019d searched for him in the area previously, but were led back when they got an alert that several Google searches at an internet caf\u00e9 near Pisac were for Charles Waggoner and each of Charles Waggoner\u2019s children. He\u2019d been extradited from Peru overnight and would face trial in New York City within six months. There was no mention of Roddy. Within minutes came a flurry of texts from Emma and the rest of the gang from the Half Moon. They sent news clips back and forth, giddy about being so close to a major crime, a news story. They included Roddy\u2019s old number on the chain, but Malcolm noticed he didn\u2019t reply. Holy shit, Jess texted soon after. Did you see? He waited four full days, the longest he could stand, and then he texted Roddy\u2019s uncle to say he had some stuff that belonged to Roddy but that he wasn\u2019t returning his calls. Did he get a new number? Was he back from his trip? Immediately, the uncle called. He sighed into the phone, said Roddy had met someone apparently, wasn\u2019t coming back for a while. He sent his mother a postcard to say as much. He didn\u2019t even have the decency to call, which was a garbage move if you asked him. \u201cSo just toss the stuff,\u201d his uncle said. \u201cWhatever it is.\u201d \u201cYeah okay sure.\u201d Malcolm stood perfectly still for several minutes after he hung up. My God. He was going to get away with it. They packed up everything they could to make the house as neat as possible for showings. On weekend mornings they drove upstate for a hike and breakfast while strangers walked through and noticed how small their closets were, how badly the kitchen needed updating. Everyone so far was a newly married couple, or a couple with one small child and plans for another. Malcolm asked Jess if she wanted him to pack up the contents of the attic by himself, the things she\u2019d collected all those painful years, but she said no, they\u2019d do it together. She told him not to worry about her. She was fine. Was he? Up in the musty attic, they combined the contents of all the small bags of hand-me-downs into two giant boxes. And then they looked to the toys, seats, play mats, things that defied categorization. They agreed they\u2019d donate all of it, rather than leave it on the curb to watch it get picked over. Jess found a women\u2019s shelter that would be happy to take it. \u201cI had something like this,\u201d Jess said, spinning the wildly patterned ball bolted to a rimmed seat with wheels. It was for learning how to walk. One of her first memories was of her father grabbing the edge before she went tumbling down the stairs and then smacking her thigh, hard, and telling her to never go near the stairs again. \u201cI had one, too,\u201d Malcolm said. The seat had a complicated system of belts and clasps. He couldn\u2019t imagine a life where he\u2019d find it second nature to understand how these things worked. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is?\u201d But what was it he was going to say? It was so hard to capture a feeling and then make it understood, even to Jess, even to himself sometimes. He remembered being a kid, all the things he felt capable of, all the streets and avenues that branched away from his body, all the possibilities. But in the end you can only have one life. One at a time, at least. You could turn, you could pause for a while, but you couldn\u2019t go down two streets at once. The things they didn\u2019t end up doing, the places and people they decided against, all defined them as much as anything else, in the way negative space defines a photo or a song. The lives they didn\u2019t lead were there, too, always with them. Only recently did he begin to see the shape those choices had made. While Malcolm was getting settled in St. John, Jess would square away what was left to organize in Gillam and at her job, and then follow a few weeks later. Mr. Sheridan came by one evening and talked to Malcolm out on the patio. He stuck to practical things\u2014that Gail needed a sump pump at the house, that it was dangerous for her to trim her hedges on her own, up on a ladder, but they both knew there was no stopping her. He said he wished she\u2019d let him take out the bathtub in her main bathroom and replace it with a walk-in shower in case she fell. He made his whole house senior friendly years ago, no sense pretending life wasn\u2019t headed full speed toward the inevitable. He repeated what Gail had already said to Malcolm, that a year was nothing, it wasn\u2019t like he and Jess wouldn\u2019t be back and forth\u2014holidays, other visits\u2014and if Malcolm didn\u2019t mind, he and Gail would like to come down to St. John to see them. Neither of them had ever been. \u201cAnyway, the whole point of me stopping by is to say you don\u2019t need to worry. I\u2019ll look out for your mom,\u201d Mr. Sheridan said. \u201cAlways have. Lately when I make my doctor appointments I make one for her, too, so we can go together.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve looked out for her ever since my dad died,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d \u201cLonger than that even,\u201d Mr. Sheridan said, and Malcolm decided to say absolutely nothing but to hold it in his hands and carry it to Jess for discussion later. \u201cI\u2019m glad about you and Jess,\u201d he said. \u201cYour mom is, too.\u201d \u201cYeah, me too,\u201d Malcolm said, not wanting to get into it. \u201cLife is complicated, right?\u201d \u201cFunny,\u201d Mr. Sheridan said. \u201cI was about to say exactly the opposite. I was just about to say how simple it is. Life is actually really simple when you boil it down.\u201d Why? Because he loved her. Malcolm\u2019s flight was early, ten past seven in the morning. He offered to take the bus to the airport but Jess was an early riser, she wanted to drive him, plus they wouldn\u2019t see each other for a few weeks. They decided five fifteen was early enough to leave\u2014a summer Friday, little traffic. But they were still home at five thirty, groggy, the airport forty minutes away, so it was a mad rush and then they got lost in Queens\u2014road construction, a detour\u2014and Jess kept saying it was insane to be lost so close to home, going to a place they\u2019d been so many times. He could hear the panic escalating in her voice. She\u2019d been up late reading about how the island was evacuated in an emergency. She\u2019d looked at a hundred images of the destruction after the last hurricane. Now, she kept leaning over the steering wheel to check the sky for planes, as if one of them might guide her. She didn\u2019t used to worry so much. \u201cWe\u2019re not lost,\u201d Malcolm said. He read aloud the directions along side streets, narrow one-ways, wide boulevards. Next thing they were back on track. When they got to the airport, everything was quiet, like it was not yet open for business, the coffeepots cold in the terminals, the planes still resting out back. Jess pulled up to the curb and no cops shouted at her. \u201cYou have everything?\u201d she asked. \u201cI think so,\u201d he said. He was looking ahead at the pedestrian bridge that connected the terminal to the parking deck, and then at the bright cobalt sky above everything. An older man pulled his roller suitcase behind him as he crossed at the light, a pleasant expression on his face. \u201cGood morning!\u201d Malcolm said to him as he got out of the car. Jess shook her head. Leave it to him. He\u2019d have to sprint to his gate, but he\u2019d probably say hello to everyone he passed on his way. She got out of the car and walked around for a hug. \u201cYou okay, Jess?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just thinking, what if it doesn\u2019t work out? This \u2018reset button\u2019 as you call it.\u201d Suddenly, or so it seemed, the lane filled with cars, the cops found their whistles, reps from the airlines were tagging suitcases and directing people to the correct doors. It was like witnessing the day swing open, usher everyone inside. Malcolm patted his pocket to confirm his wallet was there. He checked his phone. The driver of an enormous black truck blasted his horn as a low-flying plane passed over their heads, white bellied, and Malcolm imagined himself and all the people around him becoming smaller as it climbed higher, hauling whatever it carried deeper into the blue. \u201cWe\u2019re not even there yet. Why do you worry so much?\u201d \u201cWe haven\u2019t really talked about it though. What will happen if we don\u2019t like it or I can\u2019t find work or they don\u2019t renew your contract or\u2014\u201d As she spoke, she ran her hands along his arms to his shoulders. She laced her fingers at the back of his neck and held fast. He felt overcome for a moment\u2014all they\u2019d been through, all that lay ahead. He kissed the part in her hair. \u201cWhat will happen? We come back home. That\u2019s all. We just pick right up and head home.\u201d \n acknowledgments Thank you with all my heart to my longtime first and best readers: Eleanor Henderson, Brendan Mathews, and Callie Wright.
