A UNIFIED WELFARE ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT
POLICIES∗
NATHANIEL HENDREN AND BEN SPRUNG-KEYSER
We conduct a comparative welfare analysis of 133 historical policy changes
over the past half-century in the United States, focusing on policies in social in-
surance, education and job training, taxes and cash transfers, and in-kind trans-
fers. For each policy, we use existing causal estimates to calculate the beneﬁt
that each policy provides its recipients (measured as their willingness to pay)
and the policy’s net cost, inclusive of long-term effects on the government’s bud-
get. We divide the willingness to pay by the net cost to the government to form
each policy’s Marginal Value of Public Funds, or its “MVPF”. Comparing MVPFs
across policies provides a uniﬁed method of assessing their effect on social welfare.
Our results suggest that direct investments in low-income children’s health and

education have historically had the highest MVPFs, on average exceeding 5. Many
such policies have paid for themselves as the government recouped the cost of their
initial expenditures through additional taxes collected and reduced transfers. We
ﬁnd large MVPFs for education and health policies among children of all ages,
rather than observing diminishing marginal returns throughout childhood. We
ﬁnd smaller MVPFs for policies targeting adults, generally between 0.5 and 2. Ex-
penditures on adults have exceeded this MVPF range in particular if they induced
large spillovers on children. We relate our estimates to existing theories of optimal
government policy, and we discuss how the MVPF provides lessons for the design
of future research. JEL Codes: H00, I00, J24.
I. INTRODUCTION
What government expenditures are most effective at improv-
ing social well-being? Are in-kind transfers preferable to cash
transfers? Does government-provided social insurance efﬁciently
address market failures? Should we invest more in low-income
children? If so, at what age? Should they be direct investments
or subsidies to parents?
A large empirical literature estimates the causal effects of
historical government policies. These papers frequently conclude
with a brief welfare analysis. The method of that analysis, how-
ever, often differs from paper to paper. When reporting the ef-
fects of health insurance expansions, it is common to report cost
per life saved (e.g., Currie and Gruber 1996). Studies of tax pol-
icy changes often report the implied marginal excess burden or
the marginal cost of funds (e.g., summarized in Saez, Slemrod,
and Giertz 2012). Higher education analyses often report the cost
per enrollment (e.g., Kane 1994; Dynarski 2000). The early child-
hood education literature often reports a social beneﬁt-cost ra-
tio (e.g., Heckman et al. 2010). These varying welfare measures
make it difﬁcult to compare policies, especially if one wishes to
take a bird’s-eye view and perform welfare analysis across policy
categories.
This article conducts a comparative welfare analysis of
133 historical tax and expenditure policies implemented in the
United States over the past half-century. We focus on policies in
four domains: social insurance (e.g., health, unemployment, and
disability insurance), education (e.g., preschool, K–12, college, job
and vocational training), taxes and cash transfers (e.g., top tax
rates, Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC)), and in-kind transfers (e.g., housing

vouchers, food stamps). We draw on existing analyses of the
impacts of these policies to construct the beneﬁt that each policy
provides to its recipients and the policy’s net cost to the govern-
ment. Beneﬁts are captured by the willingness to pay of policy
recipients. The net cost combines both initial program spending
and the long-run effect of the policy on the government’s budget
(i.e., ﬁscal externalities). We then take the ratio of the beneﬁts to
net government costs to generate each policy’s marginal value of
public funds (MVPF).1 Putting these components together allows
us to measure each policy’s “bang for the buck.”2
The MVPF is useful because it measures the amount of wel-
fare that can be delivered to policy beneﬁciaries per dollar of gov-
ernment spending on the policy. Equivalently, the MVPF mea-
sures the shadow price of raising revenue from the beneﬁciaries
of the policy by reducing spending on the policy. For point of refer-
ence, a simple nondistortionary transfer from the government to
an individual would have an MVPF of 1. The cost to the govern-
ment would be exactly equal to the individual beneﬁciary’s willing-
ness to pay. The MVPF can differ from this benchmark value of 1 if
individuals value an expenditure at more or less than its resource
cost. For instance, if the government provides insurance, willing-
ness to pay may be greater than the resource costs of provision
to individuals if the insurance provides consumption-smoothing
beneﬁts. By contrast, willingness to pay may fall below resource
costs if individuals distort their behavior to receive higher trans-
fers.3 The MVPF may also deviate from the benchmark value of 1
if the policy induces ﬁscal externalities. For example, if spending
a dollar on a government policy caused individuals to work less,
government tax revenue might fall slightly and then the net cost
of the policy would rise above $1. By contrast, if spending that dol-
lar caused them to get more schooling and consequently increased
1. See Mayshar (1990), Slemrod and Yitzhaki (1996, 2001), and Kleven and
Kreiner (2006) for original deﬁnitions, and Hendren (2016) for a comparison of the
MVPF to alternative measures of welfare.
2. In several cases where authors constructed their own MVPFs, we incor-
porate those estimates directly. Where applicable, we adjust these estimates to
harmonize assumptions (e.g., discount rates). In cases where previous literature
has conducted comprehensive cost-beneﬁt analyses of a policy, we draw on the
components of those analyses to reformulate them into their implied MVPF.
3. The intuition here comes from the envelope theorem. Willingness to pay
for a government transfer is determined by the “mechanical cost” of that transfer.
Additional costs due to behavioral responses are not valued dollar for dollar.

their income, government revenue would rise and the net cost of
the policy would fall below $1. In some cases, positive ﬁscal exter-
nalities may be large enough to fully offset the initial cost of the
policy. In that instance, the policy has an inﬁnite MVPF, and conse-
quently, spending on the policy results in a Pareto improvement.4
More generally, comparisons of MVPFs correspond to precise
statements about social welfare using the intuition of Okun’s
leaky bucket experiment (Okun 1975). Given two policies, A and
B, suppose MVPFA = 2 and MVPFB = 1. Then one prefers more
spending on policy A ﬁnanced by less spending on policy B if and
only if one prefers giving $2 to policy A beneﬁciaries over giving
$1 to policy B beneﬁciaries. Whether this is desirable ultimately
depends on one’s social preferences for the beneﬁciaries of
policies A and B. MVPFs measure the feasible trade-offs to the
government—in Okun’s metaphor, the “leaks” in the bucket. By
measuring these shadow prices of raising revenue from different
groups, the MVPF provides a uniﬁed method of welfare analysis
that can be applied both across and within diverse policy domains.
We outline the construction of the MVPF for six represen-
tative examples in Section III. At a high level, our construction
of willingness to pay often relies on intuition provided by the
envelope theorem. Our construction of net government costs
involves calculating changes in taxes paid and transfers received,
along with savings or additional costs from crowding out of other
government spending. In Online Appendices A–F we also provide
a detailed explanation of how each MVPF in our sample is
calculated. As is common with any welfare analysis, the creation
of our MVPFs requires various judgment calls. We conduct an
extensive set of robustness analyses, examining our assumptions
about interest rates, tax rates, and forecasting methods.5 In
4. To align with terminology in existing literature, we use various terms inter-
changeably to refer to the same phenomenon. Any policy with a positive willing-
ness to pay and negative net costs we deﬁne to have an inﬁnite MVPF. Given the
negative net costs, we also say that these policies “pay for themselves” or “recoup
their initial costs.” In the taxation literature, this is also known as a Laffer effect.
We often note that spending on policies with inﬁnite MVPFs results in a Pareto
improvement. This is because the expenditure is valued by beneﬁciaries and has
no net cost on the government. This ﬁnal claim regarding Pareto improvement
formally assumes that all beneﬁciaries have positive willingness to pay, which is
natural in many of our contexts in which the policies expanded the choice sets of
all beneﬁciaries.

addition, many MVPF estimates for individual policies contain
considerable sampling uncertainty. We address this by construct-
ing category averages that pool across multiple policies and help
improve the precision of our conclusions. We also test and correct
for publication bias using the methods of Andrews and Kasy
(2019). Given these potential sources of uncertainty, we also focus
our results on broad patterns in the data, rather than conclusions
about individual policies.
Our analysis is inevitably constrained by the scope of existing
literature. Not all policies have been studied with the same degree
of completeness. For each policy, we incorporate all effects that
can reliably be translated into the MVPF, but an omitted impact
could affect our welfare analysis. We therefore assess the robust-
ness of our broad patterns to sample restrictions focused on more
comprehensively studied policies. In addition, we discuss how the
MVPF of each particular policy may vary with the addition (or
removal) of certain effects.6 For example, we ﬁnd that our MVPF
estimates are most sensitive to changes in the estimated earnings
of beneﬁciaries—speciﬁcally dynamic effects within or across
generations. In the results we discuss below, we focus our primary
conclusions on the broad lessons that are robust to variations in
the availability of estimates on underlying causal estimates.
I.A. Main Results
Our estimates reveal a stark pattern: MVPFs vary sub-
stantially based on the age of each policy’s beneﬁciaries. We
ﬁnd the highest MVPFs for direct investments in the health
and education of low-income children. This includes Medicaid
expansions, childhood education spending, and expenditures on
college. In many cases, these policies actually pay for themselves
in the long run. Children pay back the initial cost as adults
through additional tax revenue and reduced transfer payments.
For example, we examine four major health insurance expansions
to children over the past 50 years. We calculate an average across
those policies and ﬁnd that for each $1 of initial expenditure they
repaid $1.78 back to the government in the long run. In particular,
we ﬁnd that three of four policies fully repaid their initial costs.

THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
We ﬁnd high MVPFs for policies targeting children through-
out childhood. We do ﬁnd high MVPFs for early childhood
education programs, including an MVPF of roughly 44 for Perry
Preschool and 12 for Abecedarian.7 In addition, we ﬁnd large
MVPFs for policies targeting older children, such as historical
equalizations in K–12 school ﬁnancing (studied in Jackson,
Persico, and Johnson 2016) and policies increasing college
attainment. Our broad patterns contrast with the notion that
opportunities for high-return investment in children decline
rapidly with age (Heckman 2006).
Our results show lower MVPFs for policies targeted to adults.
Most of these MVPFs lie between 0.5 and 2. For example, we ﬁnd
MVPFs ranging from 0.40–1.63 for health insurance expansions
to adults, 0.65–1.04 for in-kind transfers such as housing vouchers
and food stamps, and from negative values to 1.20 for tax credits
and cash welfare programs to low-income households. These lower
MVPFs reﬂect the fact that spending on many of these policies
reduced labor earnings. This stands in contrast to our ﬁnding that
many policies spending on children increased later-life earnings.
It is important to note that these differences in returns by age
represent general patterns but do not hold uniformly. There are a
number of exceptions. For child policies, we ﬁnd large variation in
MVPFs across policies, with some estimates relatively close to 1.
In particular, we ﬁnd lower MVPFs for job training programs and
for college subsidies that do not lead to increases in attainment.
We also ﬁnd lower MVPFs for transfers to disabled children
and their families. This latter case illustrates that policies with
lower MVPFs are not necessarily “undesirable”—they can be
welfare enhancing depending on one’s social preferences. Unlike
expenditures with inﬁnite MVPFs, policies with low MVPFs
involve a budgetary trade-off that should be weighed against
one’s preference for redistribution.
Among expenditures on adults, we ﬁnd relatively large
MVPFs for reductions in top marginal tax rates, with estimates
7. In our baseline speciﬁcations that harmonize government revenue compo-
nents across policies, we estimate that the government recoups 92% of the up-front
cost of Perry Preschool and 78% of the cost of Abecedarian. Because the cost of
crime impacts are often difﬁcult to quantify, they are not included in our base-
line analyses (when crime estimates are available, we we incorporate them in
alternative speciﬁcations discussed in the Online Appendix for each policy). In
this case, if one includes additional estimated effects such as the cost of crime, we
estimate that Perry Preschool does pay for itself and Abecedarian pays for 92% of
the up-front cost.

from 1.16 to inﬁnity. There is, however, substantial sampling
uncertainty in these estimates.8 We also ﬁnd high MVPFs for
spending on adults that generates spillover effects on children.
For example, providing vouchers with counseling services to
families residing in high-poverty public housing (as part of the
Moving to Opportunity Experiment) helped these families move
to lower-poverty neighborhoods. This led to large increases in
children’s earnings in adulthood that generated sufﬁcient tax rev-
enue to pay for the program cost. Our results highlight the value
of further work to uncover when such spillovers are likely to occur.
I.B. Relation to Previous Theories
The ratio of MVPFs measures the extent to which the govern-
ment can transfer welfare across individuals in society. For this
reason, it relates to the literature on optimal government policy
and redistribution (e.g., Mirrlees 1971, 1976). After presenting
our results, we interpret them in light of this theory. For example,
we tend to ﬁnd tax cuts to top earners have higher MVPFs than
cuts targeted to low-income households, a result consistent with
the behavior of a progressive planner setting the tax rate in a
Mirrleesian optimal tax model (Mirrlees 1971, 1976). We also
compare the MVPFs of cash transfers to those of in-kind trans-
fers, testing the applicability of the Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem
(Atkinson and Stiglitz 1976; Hylland and Zeckhauser 1981).
I.C. Implications for Future Research
We conclude by providing three lessons for future research.
First, we show how the MVPF framework allows us to quantify
the value of such research. Because the MVPF is a shadow price,
one can use a standard decision-theoretic framework to quantify
the value of reducing uncertainty in our MVPF estimates. Just
as a consumer would be willing to pay to learn the true value of
the products he or she buys, a welfare-maximizing government
should be willing to pay to reduce uncertainty in the cost of
redistribution. Using this approach, we show that a welfare-
maximizing government deciding whether to raise taxes to spend
an additional $1 on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program (SNAP) would be willing to pay $0.24 to make this
decision using a more precise causal estimate of the long-run
8. For example, we estimate an inﬁnite MVPF for the 1981 reduction in the
top marginal income tax rate from 70% to 50%. Our conﬁdence interval, however,
includes both 1 and inﬁnity.

impact of SNAP using administrative data (as in Bailey et al.
2019) as opposed to survey data (as in Hoynes, Schanzenbach,
and Almond 2016). This highlights the value of expanding the
access to, and use of, large administrative linked datasets for the
study of long-run policy impacts on children.
Second, we show the added insights that come using the
MVPF framework as opposed to traditional cost-beneﬁt analy-
sis.9 It turns out that our general ﬁndings would be very similar
in a traditional cost-beneﬁt framework, but the MVPF leads to
different conclusions in certain key instances. This is because the
MVPF and traditional beneﬁt-cost analysis rely on similar inputs,
but the MVPF is unique in incorporating all ﬁscal externalities in
its denominator.10 For example, when taxes are at the top of the
Laffer curve, the social beneﬁt of reducing taxes by $1 is $2,11 but
the MVPF of that policy is inﬁnite because the beneﬁts to the in-
dividual are $1 and the net cost of the policy is $0. More generally,
our results suggest there is value in calculating the MVPF in other
settings, such as crime policy or tax enforcement, where the causal
effects of the policy have clear effects on the government’s budget.
Last, we discuss the implications of the MVPF framework
for future empirical designs. In particular, we highlight the im-
portance of determining whether willingness to pay is positive or
negative. In this article, we sought to analyze state-level welfare
reforms from the 1980s and 1990s. There were 27 large-scale
state-level randomized controlled trials (RCTs) analyzing welfare
reform. These studies increased our understanding of the employ-
ment and revenue impacts of welfare policy. They demonstrated
that these welfare reforms had low net costs. That said, while the
treated participants in these studies often received additional
services such as job search assistance, these policies also cut ben-
eﬁts for those who did not comply with program requirements. As
9. The edited volume from Weimer (2009) provides a discussion of cost-beneﬁt
analyses from different researchers in a range of different domains. The Washing-
ton State Institute for Public Policy (WSIPP 2019) conducts ongoing cost-beneﬁt
analyses to assess policies relevant to state legislatures. See also Rea and Burton
(2020) for an application of the WSIPP data to comparative welfare analysis.
10. Traditional cost-beneﬁt approaches include ﬁscal externalities in the nu-
merator (see Greenberg, Deitch, and Hamilton 2010).
11. The individual is willing to pay $1 for the tax cut and the government
receives a $1 beneﬁt from increased tax revenue from the behavioral response to
the tax. In traditional cost-beneﬁt analysis, increases in government tax revenue
are included in the numerator of the expression.

a result, it is unclear whether willingness to pay for these reforms
was positive or negative. Despite randomizing more than 100,000
families into 27 large-scale RCTs, we are unable to reach any reli-
able estimates of the MVPFs of these policies. The evaluations of
welfare reform may have led to more valuable information if the
RCT designs had been created with a social welfare framework
in mind.
I.D. Relationship to Existing Literature
In constructing our MVPFs and presenting evidence for
high returns to investment in low-income children, we build
on a substantial line of existing research making the argument
for investment in children.12 Our work is also related to recent
research on the long-run effect of safety net protections for
children reviewed by Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2018). In light
of the evidence, they conclude that “reallocation of investments
over the life course to earlier periods can be efﬁciency-enhancing,”
which aligns with our conclusions.
There are also analyses—many of which we draw on in
this article—in which researchers have previously argued that
some government expenditures largely pay for themselves.
This argument is particularly prominent in discussion of early
education (e.g., Heckman et al. 2010; Garc´
ıa et al. 2017) and child
health care expenditures (e.g., Brown, Kowalski, and Lurie 2015;
Wherry et al. 2018).13 The argument also appears in the tax
literature, where some have argued that reducing top marginal
tax rates produces a “Laffer effect,” raising total revenue.14 Our
analysis builds on that work by evaluating policies at scale and
searching for the presence of high-return policies across a wide
range of policy domains. We ﬁnd the most robust evidence for
Laffer effects for policies investing directly in children.
12. For example, foreshadowing many of our conclusions, Currie (1994) writes,
“Although the evidence is incomplete, it suggests that in-kind programs have
stronger effects on children than cash transfers, and that programs that target
speciﬁc beneﬁts directly to children have the largest positive effects.”
13. Outside the scope of this article, some suggest certain macroeconomic
policies can pay for themselves, such as ﬁscal expansions during deep recessions
(DeLong et al. 2012). More generally, we omit many potentially relevant categories
of policies, such as macroeconomic stabilization, infrastructure investment, and
environmental policies.
14. In this sense, testing whether the MVPF of a policy change is inﬁnite is a
generalization of Werning (2007)’s proposed test for identifying local Laffer effects
in the income tax schedule.

of policies targeting children versus adults. Section V places the
MVPF estimates in the context of existing theories of optimal
government policy. Section VI presents lessons for future work.

II. MVPF FRAMEWORK
This section presents a general framework to measure the
welfare impact of changes in government policies. The frame-
work illustrates how the marginal value of public funds provides
natural guidance on the social welfare impact of economic policies.
Consider a government seeking to measure the welfare im-
pact of a government policy change under consideration. We deﬁne
social welfare, W, by the weighted sum of individual utilities,
W =

i
ψiUi,
where Ui is individual i’s utility function and ψi is their social
welfare weight. The latter measures how much a 1-unit increase
in utility corresponds to an impact on social welfare, W.15 The
utility function, Ui, measures both current and future well-being
of the individual. For example, if utility were additive over time,
one could nest uncertainty about future outcomes within this
framework, letting Ui = E[
t ⩾0βtuit] where uit is the individual’s
utility t periods from today.
Because the utility function is allowed to vary arbitrarily
across individuals, it will be helpful to normalize units across
individuals. To that aim, let λi denote individual i’s marginal
utility of income at the time the policy is under consideration.
15. For now, we do not place any assumption on these weights, and therefore
they can result from any particular social welfare function. We also assume the
weights do not change in response to the policy, but this is without loss of generality
because we focus on small policy changes below.

This is equal to the effect on individual utility of providing $1
to that individual. Let ηi = ψiλi denote the individual’s social
marginal utility of income at the time of the policy. The value of
ηi measures the impact on social welfare, W, of an additional $1
placed in individual i’s budget today.
The government is considering a set of policy changes indexed
by j = 1, ..., J that change the economic environment (e.g., prices,
public goods) by a small amount. We parameterize the up-front
initial spending on policy j by dpj (which can either be an increase
or decrease). The net impact on social welfare of the policy is

The values ¯

were to provide an average of $1 to the beneﬁciaries of policy

the impact on social welfare of an expansion of the policy by

In accounting for costs, we let R denote the present discounted
value of the government budget, and let Gj = dR

impact of the policy on the government budget.17 This net cost is

ual’s utility function. We abstract from any behavioral biases in the utility function
that might cause willingness to pay to be incongruent with choices that maximize
well-being. Moreover, in practice, our approaches to inferring willingness to pay
often require assumptions of rationality in individual utility that do not account
for the potential presence of behavioral biases.
17. In practice, the dpj variations that are identiﬁed in an empiricist’s re-
gressions will not, in general, correspond to budget-neutral policies. Traditional

inclusive both of the initial cost of the program and all other effects
of behavioral responses on the government budget. For example, if
spending $1 on preschool increases wages in the future, Gj should
incorporate the effect of those increases in future tax receipts.
Crucially, both the willingness to pay measures, WTP j
i , and the
net cost, Gj, should include effects on both parents and children.
Policies that directly affect children should include willingness
to pay by parents and the impacts of their behavioral responses
on the cost of the policy. Conversely, policies that directly affect
parents should include any spillovers onto children.18
The MVPF of policy j is given by the aggregate willingness
to pay, WTP j = 

The MVPF is previously deﬁned in Mayshar (1990), where it is
referred to as the marginal excess burden (MEB); in Slemrod and
Yitzhaki (1996), where it is referred to as both the marginal cost
of funds and the marginal beneﬁt of projects, depending on the
policy in question; and in Kleven and Kreiner (2006), where it is
referred to as the marginal cost of funds (MCPF). However, the
MVPF formally differs from both the traditional deﬁnition of the
marginal excess burden in Auerbach (1985), Auerbach and Hines
(2002), and the marginal cost of funds in Stiglitz and Dasgupta
(1971), Atkinson and Stern (1974). Because of this, Hendren
(2016) deﬁnes this quantity as the MVPF to contrast it with the
MEB and MCPF.
approaches would attempt to account for government spending by modifying
the observed policy into a different policy that raised revenues via lump-sum
taxation. This would then require the researcher to observe not the causal effect of
the policy, but the “compensated effect” of the policy to identify the welfare effect.
In contrast, our approach hypothetically closes the budget constraint by comparing
two MVPFs: one that involves an increase in spending and another that involves
a reduction in spending or increase in revenue. Hence, welfare analysis can be
done with two sets of causal effects (one for the two policies under consideration)
as opposed to attempting to measure the compensated effect of a policy.
18. We sum the beneﬁts accruing to both parents and children, but we do not
include any willingness to pay that arises because of parental altruism toward
their children (or children’s altruism toward their parents). This means that a
child’s willingness to pay for a policy is only counted once. Including willingness
to pay from parental altruism would only reinforce our central results. Similarly,
we do not incorporate individual willingness to pay for redistribution to others.

Given the MVPF for any two policy changes, one can construct hy-
pothetical budget-neutral policy changes. For example, consider
increasing spending on policy 1 by a net amount G1, ﬁnanced by
reducing spending (or increasing revenue) from policy 2 by the
same amount. Pursuing this combined policy, dp, increases social
welfare if and only if
(3)

Welfare increases if and only if the welfare gains from increasing
spending on policy 1, ¯
η1MVPF1, exceed the welfare loss from
reducing spending on policy 2, ¯
η2MVPF2. The MVPFs of the
two policies characterize the cost of moving welfare between the
two groups of beneﬁciaries. One prefers the policy if and only if
¯
η1
¯
η2 > MVPF2
MVPF1 . If MVPF1 = 1 and MVPF2 = 2, then an individual
prefers spending on policy 1 ﬁnanced by policy 2 if and only
if providing $1 to beneﬁciaries of policy 1 is valued more than
providing $2 to beneﬁciaries of policy 2.
As this example illustrates, welfare statements that com-
pare policies generally require comparisons of their MVPFs. The
MVPFs allows the researcher to form hypothetical budget-neutral
policies and assess their welfare implications using equation (3).
To reduce the role of social preferences in driving conclusions, one
can compare policies with the same beneﬁciary group. In this case,
one would expect that ¯
η1 ≈¯
η2 so that comparisons of the MVPFs
correspond to statements about social welfare. For example,
Hendren (2017a) suggests comparing the MVPF of a particular
policy to the MVPF of a tax cut with similar distributional inci-
dence. More generally, one can compare different redistributive
policies, such as food stamps and housing vouchers, among each
other to evaluate the most effective method of redistribution.
In some cases, one does not need to compare an MVPF to
another policy to reach a welfare conclusion. This occurs when
the MVPF is inﬁnite. Mathematically, this happens when a
policy has positive willingness to pay by its beneﬁciaries and the
behavioral response to the policy generates ﬁscal externalities

that are sufﬁcient to cover the cost of the program, Gj < 0. The
textbook example of such a case is lowering taxes when they are
beyond the peak of the Laffer curve. In this case, lowering taxes
increases government revenue, and so these policies represent a
Pareto improvement for any positive welfare weights assigned to
the recipients.19 More generally, the MVPF framework facilitates
a search for other cases where policies have positive willingness
to pay and negative net costs, such as investment in kids.
The deﬁnition of the MVPF is theoretically motivated using
small (marginal) changes in government expenditures. Although
some empirical variation we use has marginal effects on individ-
uals’ budget constraints, one can also continue to construct the
MVPF as the ratio of willingness to pay to net government cost
for nonmarginal policy changes. This approach uses the actual
empirical variation in existing literature to estimate the return
on the observed nonmarginal expenditure. Future work could
explore how the MVPF for a given policy change varies within a
program’s size of spending. This would facilitate improved welfare
comparison for policies that were evaluated at different scales.20
II.A. Comparison to Social Cost-Beneﬁt Analysis
The MVPF approach builds on a large literature on social
cost-beneﬁt analysis (see the edited volume Weimer and Vining
2009 and Boardman et al. 2017, and the cost-beneﬁt estimates
provided by WSIPP 2019). The MVPF uses many of the same un-
derlying estimates used to create beneﬁt-cost ratios, but combines
them in a different way. A comparison with cost-beneﬁt analysis
from Heckman et al. (2010) helps illustrate the importance of
19. In practice an expenditure policy may have been combined with a sep-
arate tax policy to raise revenue at the time the policy is implemented. In this
case, the combined expenditure and tax policy would not deliver a Pareto improve-
ment, as some current taxpayers would be made worse off. However, the inﬁnite
MVPF corresponds to a case where the government need not raise revenue to im-
plement a policy that does not cost money in the long-run. The government could
have borrowed against the future returns on the policy and generated a Pareto
improvement.
20. Consider the case where policy 1 was a $1M government expenditure and
policy 2 was a $2M government expenditure. Comparing policy 1 and policy 2 would
require the MVPF for a version of Policy 1 that is scaled up to cost $2M. This same
logic would also apply if considering a large-scale expenditure on a policy that
had previously been analyzed with a narrower RCT—one would have to make the
additional assumption that the average treatment effect of this expanded policy is
given by the effect identiﬁed in the RCT.

UNIFIED WELFARE ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES 1223
these differences. Heckman et al. (2010) compare the net social
beneﬁts of the policy, inclusive of beneﬁts that accrue back to
the government, against the up-front budgetary spending on the
policy, Cj. They use the following formula:
(4)
BCRj = Social Beneﬁts
Social Costs
= WTP j + FEj
(1 + φ) C j
,
where FEj = Gj −Cj are the beneﬁts accruing to the government
budget from the behavioral responses to the policy. The initial
program outlays in the denominator are often multiplied by 1 +
φ, where φ is the marginal deadweight loss of raising government
revenue. This is thought to translate the up-front costs into social
costs by accounting for the welfare impact of an implicit tax
policy that raises the needed funds. Often, φ is taken to be 0.3 or
0.5 (Heckman et al. 2010). Policies are then deemed to pass the
cost-beneﬁt test if the BCR exceeds 1.
In contrast to the BCR, the MVPF is given by MVPF j =
WTP j
C j+FEj . It differs in two primary ways. First, the impact of be-
havioral responses on the government budget is counted in the
denominator, not the numerator. For example, consider a tax cut
of $1 for which the behavioral response increases tax revenue by
$1. In this case, the policy perfectly pays for itself, and so the
MVPF is inﬁnite. Expenditures on the policy represent a Pareto
improvement. In a BCR framework, however, that $1 in increased
tax revenue is considered social beneﬁt and counted in the numer-
ator. That leaves a BCR estimate of (
2
1 + φ ). This illustrates why
the BCR may be a particularly misleading guide to optimal policy
when policies have strong impacts on the government budget. We
found a policy with a BCR of (
2
1 + φ ) that was a Pareto improvement,
but we could ﬁnd a different policy with a BCR above 2 that does
not deliver a Pareto improvement. For example, if we compare
this hypothetical tax cut to government-provided insurance with
willingness to pay of $2 for each $1 of insurance, the traditional
cost-beneﬁt framework cannot distinguish between these policies.
Second, the MVPF approach does not require the government
to close the budget constraint through an increase in taxation.
Therefore, one does not adjust for the “deadweight cost of tax-
ation” based on this particular assumed method of government
ﬁnance. Rather, the MVPF directly measures the amount of
welfare delivered to beneﬁciaries per dollar of government

expenditure. One closes the budget constraint by comparing the
MVPF of a given policy to the MVPF of other policies. This allows
the researcher to think through the library of feasible levers
available to the government. In contrast to the cost-beneﬁt frame-
work, this approach reinforces the idea that incidence matters: a
policy that provides beneﬁts to the poor cannot be readily
compared to the raising of revenue on the rich without thinking
about Okun’s bucket and the social welfare weights placed on the
beneﬁciaries (i.e., the values of ¯
η j for the policies).
Despite our advocacy for the value of the MVPF over a tradi-
tional cost-beneﬁt analysis, it is perhaps reassuring to note that,
in most cases, these two approaches generate similar conclusions.
So although we argue that the MVPF is more appropriate for
measuring welfare, and consequently more informative in cases
where these two welfare measures diverge, the broad pattern of
our results remain the same under either framework.
III. CALCULATING MVPFS: EXAMPLES
We estimate the MVPF for 133 policies spanning social
insurance (e.g., health, unemployment, and disability insurance),
education (e.g., preschool, K–12, college, job and vocational train-
ing), taxes and cash transfers (e.g., top tax rates, EITC, AFDC),
and in-kind transfers (e.g., housing vouchers, food stamps). Our
focus here is on policies, rather than papers. In many cases
we combine estimates from multiple different papers, putting
together the puzzle pieces to build the full picture.21
We form a sample of policies in each domain by drawing on
survey and summary articles from each ﬁeld. We supplement this
initial set of estimates with recent work in each area not captured
in the survey or summary articles. We restrict our attention to
policies in which there is an experimental or quasi-experimental
identiﬁcation strategy used to estimate the policy’s impact.22
Formally, such papers identify causal effects using variations dpj
in the economic environment. We form our baseline sample with
21. If multiple papers analyze the same causal effect, we generally focus on
the most recent published estimates unless otherwise noted. We provide a detailed
discussion of the alternative speciﬁcations in the Online Appendix.
22. We exclude purely cross-sectional identiﬁcation using controls for ob-
servables in our baseline sample. Within the set of experimental and quasi-
experimental studies, we do not impose our own ﬁlter on the quality or validity of
these empirical designs.

policies where one observes effects of the policy that are sufﬁcient
to form a reasonably comprehensive view of both the WTP and
net cost of the policy. We discuss in Online Appendices A–F the
standard for policy inclusion in our categories and the set of
causal effects used in each case. Because this process involves
judgment calls, we also assess robustness of our conclusions to
an expanded sample (e.g., that expands the set of identiﬁcation
and forecasting methods) and a more restricted sample (e.g., that
requires direct observation of causal effects on income).
Table I lists the set of policies studied, along with the
empirical papers used to form each policy’s MVPF. Column (9)
denotes the set of papers used to construct the MVPF. In many
cases, we draw from multiple papers to form a single MVPF. For
example, some publications might estimate the impact of the
policy on adults, while other papers focus on longer-run effects on
children.
In this section, we illustrate the construction of these esti-
mates using six examples spanning the domains we consider. We
attempt here to provide a diverse set of examples to demonstrate
the range of approaches used to create our estimates. Online
Appendices A–F provides a detailed step-by-step discussion of the
construction of each MVPF. In Section IV.C, we assess robustness
of our primary conclusions to alternative assumptions (e.g.,
different interest rates and tax rate imputations) and alternative
samples.
III.A. Admission to Florida International University
We begin by constructing the MVPF of admitting an addi-
tional student into Florida International University (FIU). This
example illustrates the construction of the MVPF for a policy
targeting youth with effects on later-life earnings. We use similar
methods for other child policies.
We draw on the work of Zimmerman (2014). He uses an RD
design at the school’s academic performance cutoff for applicants
to measure the effect of FIU admission on state university system
enrollment and medium-term earnings outcomes. We translate
his estimates into an MVPF, incorporating the net cost of the
policy and the beneﬁciaries’ willingness to pay. Throughout,
we construct conﬁdence intervals for our estimates using a

semiparametric bootstrap procedure discussed in detail in Online
Appendix H.23
1. Costs.
Figure I, Panel A shows how we calculate the net
cost of FIU admission. We start with initial costs of $11,403, which
represents the state university system’s educational expenditures
on each marginal admit to FIU.24 Students pay some fraction
of those educational expenses, so we subtract $3,184 to account
for private student contributions. Next we account for the fact
that some new admits would have attended a state community
college if they had not enrolled in FIU. We subtract $5,601,
Zimmerman’s estimate of the amount the government would
have paid to support their education at those community colleges.
Taken together, that leaves us with an up-front government cost
of $2,617 per admitted student.
The remaining cost considerations all stem from earnings
changes caused by FIU admission.25 Zimmerman (2014) calcu-
lates that in the ﬁrst seven years after admission, earnings fall
by $10,942.26 We use estimates from the Congressional Budget
Ofﬁce to estimate that the tax and transfer rate on these earnings
is 18.6%. This suggests the earnings change reduces government
revenue by $2,035.27 Next, Zimmerman (2014) estimates that FIU
23. In particular, we conservatively account for correlations across estimates
in a given policy, and we develop a method to adjust for the uncertainty in the
denominator (with many thanks to conversations with Isaiah Andrews). We pro-
vide the intuition for the approach and Monte Carlo simulations with appropriate
coverage. In fact, the coverage is sometimes overly conservative, especially when
costs approach 0.
24. Zimmerman (2014) calculates costs and student contributions using the
data on educational expenditures from the Delta Cost Project (American Institutes
for Research 2017). We adopt this approach for other college policies analyzed in
our sample. Online Appendix B explains the details of our approach.
25. Zimmerman (2014) does not include any information on attendance of
federally supported graduate schools among marginal FIU enrollees. If that infor-
mation were available, it could be incorporated as an additional ﬁscal cost.
26. All earnings changes are discounted back to the time of the initial expen-
diture using a 3% discount rate. We toggle these discount rates in our robustness
discussion in Section IV.C. We also use CPI-U-RS when we need to deﬂate from
nominal dollar values to real ones.
27. To be conservative, we exclude payroll taxes because individuals may ben-
eﬁt from a portion of these contributions. More detail on our calculations can be
found in Online Appendix G. The tax and transfer rate includes federal and state
income taxes along with food stamps, but excludes housing vouchers and other
welfare programs. We use the income-speciﬁc rate from the 2016 CBO estimates,

This ﬁgure illustrates the cost and willingness to pay components for admission
to Florida International University as studied in Zimmerman (2014). Panel
A breaks the total cost down into its various components, including increased
student payments on tuition, reduced government spending on community
colleges, and the changes in tax revenue from earnings. Panel B shows the
cumulative discounted cost of the policy over the lifetime of the beneﬁciary.
The solid line represents cumulative costs for ages up until 33, the oldest age
at which incomes are observed in Zimmerman (2014). The dotted lines provide
the 95% bootstrap (pointwise) conﬁdence intervals with adjustments discussed

costs at subsequent ages. The projection method is detailed in Section III and in
Online Appendix I. Panel C reports the components of our WTP calculations. The
point estimate measures WTP as the change in incomes after taxes and expenses
on tuition. All numbers are in 2005 dollars deﬂated using the CPI-U-RS and
discounted using a 3% real interest rate.

admission causes earnings to rise by $36,369 in years 8–14. Once
again, we apply a tax and transfer rate and determine that the
government’s revenue rises by $7,274. At this point our net costs
are −$2,622, as shown in Figure I, Panel B. This suggests the
expenditure has paid for itself within 14 years of the initial outlay.
Finally, Zimmerman’s earnings data extend 14 years, but we
can extrapolate from the observed effects to estimate earnings
changes over the full life cycle. Online Appendix I describes this
procedure in detail, and Appendix Figure I provides a graphi-
cal illustration of the approach. We use ACS data to estimate
life cycle earnings trajectories and then map the control group in
Zimmerman (2014) onto those trajectories. In particular, we ob-
serve an average earnings for the control group of $28,964, which
we estimate to be 113% of mean earnings for this cohort in the
ACS. In contrast, the treated group earns $6,372 more during
these ages, or 22% more than the control group. We assume that
the control group earnings remain constant as a fraction of av-
erage ACS earnings throughout the life cycle. We also assume
that the percentage earnings increase for the treatment group
also remains constant throughout the life cycle. These assump-
tions mean that we assume the trajectories for the treatment and
control groups differ by a constant percentage throughout the life
cycle.28 This yields an estimated discounted earnings increase of
$117,330 through age 65. We subsequently calculate that the as-
sociated ﬁscal externality reduces government costs by $21,823.
When combined with our previous cost components, we ﬁnd that
each marginal FIU admission has a net cost of −$24,445. The
expenditure pays for itself.
and we apply this rate uniformly across years for simplicity. With more reliable
historical information on marginal tax and transfer rates across the income distri-
bution, one could perform the analysis separately by year. We are not aware of any
comprehensive historical source on the distribution of those rates. For this reason,
we take the simpler approach of using a consistent 2016 tax and transfer rate
and then assessing the robustness of all our results to alternative rate assump-
tions. We present robustness to alternative tax and transfer rate assumptions in
Section IV.C.
28. Although this is a strong assumption, we show in the robustness analysis
that our results are actually not very sensitive to the method we use to construct
these forecasts. For example, we conduct a conservative forecast that assumes
zero income growth over the life cycle. This yields similar results (see Figure VI,
Panel B).

2. Willingness to Pay.
Having established that the initial
costs of increasing admission at FIU leads to long-run net savings
to the government, the policy has an inﬁnite MVPF as long as
WTP > 0. That said, constructing a measure of willingness to pay
remains useful in making our conﬁdence intervals and evaluating
alternate speciﬁcations. The components of our baseline estimate
of WTP are illustrated in Figure I, Panel C.
Throughout, our approaches to estimating WTP rely heavily
on the logic of the envelope theorem and revealed preference. For
the baseline estimate, we assume that increases in income among
the college educated stem from returns to human capital, not from
higher levels of effort.29 In this case, the envelope theorem implies
that we can form an estimate of WTP using the policy’s impact
on net income after taxes and other expenses (and ignore the
composition of individuals’ spending).30 We begin by noting that
those who are admitted to FIU have an increase in private costs
associated with additional tuition and fee payments at the four-
year school. This leads to a negative WTP component of $2,851.
Next, the earnings fall in the ﬁrst seven years after admission
leads to a further negative WTP of $8,907. The earnings gains in
years 8–14 yield a positive WTP of $29,095. Projecting through
the rest of the life cycle yields an additional WTP of $95,507.
Combined, this yields a total willingness to pay of $112,844.31
29. We refrain from incorporating general equilibrium effects in our willing-
ness to pay due to a lack of evidence on this point. If higher educational attainment
produced positive spillovers on others, aggregate willingness to pay would rise. If
the college earnings premium were driven by signaling effects, then we would
expect other individuals to have a negative willingness to pay.
30. To see this, consider the decision problem of choosing a vector of consump-
tion goods x to maximize u(x; p) subject to q · x ⩽y(p) where q is the price of goods
and y(p) is after-tax income. In principle, the government’s policy choices, p, can
directly affect utility and the budget constraint. For the baseline WTP measure
for FIU, we assume admission to FIU only affects y(p) so that ∂u
∂p = 0, which means
willingness to pay is given by dy
dp (the impact on the vector x can be ignored by
the envelope theorem). However, if effects on income of admission to FIU is the
result of higher levels of effort, that would require an adjustment for the disutility
of labor and our baseline approach would overstate WTP; conversely, if individ-
uals derive additional utility from attending college that is not captured in their
earnings, the baseline approach would understate willingness to pay.
31. We also form a “conservative WTP” of $1 that relies on the logic of revealed
preference that individuals are willing to pay a nonnegative amount for admission
into FIU.

III.B. Medicaid Expansion to Pregnant Women and Infants
Now, we consider a Medicaid expansion to pregnant women
and children in the United States that occurred across states
between 1979–1992. This example illustrates a case where we
construct the MVPF using examples from several papers using the
same identiﬁcation strategy but focusing on different outcomes.
We construct our MVPF using several different analyses of
these reforms, each of which use the differential timing of the re-
forms across states to measure their impacts.32 Currie and Gruber
(1996) document a signiﬁcant increase in health insurance cover-
age for pregnant women, along with a corresponding reduction in
infant mortality and low birth weight. Cutler and Gruber (1996)
ﬁnd signiﬁcant crowd-out of private insurance policies. Dave
et al. (2015) ﬁnd reductions in labor supply of eligible women.
Miller and Wherry (2019) ﬁnd positive effects on children’s future
earnings and health for those whose parents obtained Medicaid
eligibility. We translate these estimates into their implied MVPF,
beginning with costs and then turning to willingness to pay.
1. Costs.
The bar chart in Figure II, Panel A illustrates
the translation of estimates from the literature into their
implied costs to the government. Currie and Gruber (1996)
estimate that the cost of insuring an additional pregnant woman
through the Medicaid expansion was $3,473.33 In addition to
the direct Medicaid costs, Dave et al. (2015) estimate that
Medicaid eligibility leads to a 21.9% reduction in female labor
force participation, which corresponds to an earnings impact
of roughly $2,834. We estimate that these individuals face a
tax-and-transfer rate of 18.9% from the CBO using our procedure
discussed in Online Appendix G. This means that the earnings
effect implies an additional cost to the government of $564 per
eligible child. As a result, a short-run analysis of the policy would
conclude that the causal effects of the policy lead to an increase
in costs.
32. Our analysis also explores other policies that expanded Medicaid to chil-
dren, such as the national expansion of Medicaid to those born after September 30,
1983. These policy changes correspond to separate MVPF constructions because
they arise from different sources of policy variation.
33. For consistency across papers analyzing the reform, we deﬂate all numbers
to 2012 US$ using the CPI-U-RS; as a result, they differ slightly from reported
ﬁgures in each paper.

This ﬁgure illustrates the cost to the government of providing Medicaid to
pregnant women and infants. The evidence comes from state Medicaid expansions
between 1979 and 1992. Panel A breaks the total cost down into its various
components. The savings on uncompensated care come from Currie and Gruber
(1996), who estimate rates of uninsurance, and Gold and Kenney (1985) who
estimate the quantity of uncompensated care for the uninsured. The savings
on future health costs come from Miller and Wherry (2019). The increase in
government revenue combines an effective tax rate with the estimates of earnings
gains from Miller and Wherry (2019). Panel B reports the components of our WTP
calculations. The point estimate includes the willingness to pay for reductions
in infant mortality, combined with the change in income for children over their
life cycle after taxes and educational expenses. All numbers are in 2011 dollars
deﬂated using the CPI-U-RS and discounted using a 3% real interest rate.

Turning to the effects on children, Miller and Wherry (2019)
estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in parental eligibility
leads to a reduction in future hospitalizations of 0.237% when
children are 19 to 32 years old. With a 3% discount rate, this im-

Wherry (2019) also ﬁnd a 3.5% increase in college attendance and
an 11.6% increase in earnings for children made eligible. On the
one hand, to the extent to which the government subsidizes col-
lege expenses, increased enrollment raises government costs. We
estimate that effect to be $371. On the other hand, the increase in
earnings when children are 23–36 years old leads to an increase in
government revenue of $3,909. By the time children are 36 years
old, the estimates suggest that the policy has paid for itself.
As with the example in Section III.A, we forecast these
earnings gains to age 65 by assuming that the percentage impact
on earnings remains constant throughout the life cycle. This
suggests that the government recoups an additional $6,114 in
tax revenue over this period, for a total of $10,024. The up-front
cost of $3,473 led to a long-run net government surplus of $7,014
(95% CI of [1,178, 12,971]).
Before moving on to discussing the details of willingness to
pay, it is worth noting that the MVPF of this expenditure has al-
ready been determined. For a policy to have an inﬁnite MVPF, net
costs must be negative and willingness to pay must be any positive
value. The policy evaluated here expanded health care opportu-
nities to parents and children, so it is safe to assume willingness
to pay is positive. In fact, if the policy did not make anyone worse
off, then these expenditures resulted in a Pareto improvement.
2. WTP.
While the baseline MVPF estimate is inﬁnite, we
calculate willingness to pay for use in constructing conﬁdence
intervals and evaluating alternate speciﬁcations where costs are
positive. We brieﬂy summarize this construction, which consists
of three components. (Step-by-step details of this calculation can
be found in Online Appendix D.)
First, Cutler and Gruber (1996) document that half of the
increase in Medicaid actually crowded out private coverage. As-
suming that the public and private costs of insurance were roughly
34. We forecast to age 65 by assuming a constant dollar saving and discounting
by 3%, which implies $530 of total savings, as shown in Figure II.

THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
similar, this ﬁnding implies that beneﬁciaries no longer had to pay
roughly $1,737 in health insurance costs. This means that WTP
is at least $1,737. Second, Currie and Gruber (1996) estimate a
causal effect of the Medicaid expansion on infant mortality. We
assume parents have a willingness to pay out of their own income
of $1M to avoid an infant death (and assess robustness to alterna-
tive speciﬁcations).35 Third, we consider the WTP by the children
for improved labor market prospects in adulthood. To do so, we
assume that the increase in earnings documented by Miller and
Wherry (2019) reﬂects an expansion of labor market opportunities
and not an increase in costly labor effort. This means that the chil-
dren should be willing to pay the increase in their net income after
private expenses that results from increased educational attain-
ment. The increase in after-tax income is $16,775 for the observed
14-year age range (23–36) in Miller and Wherry (2019) and an
additional $26,236 in the subsequent years. Subtracting the cost
of college expenses reduces this by $111 for a net WTP of $47,400.
We also provide a conservative WTP estimate using solely
the transfer value of the insurance of $1,737. This would be
valid if the increase in after-tax earnings came at the expense
of increased effort as opposed to increased opportunities. To
be sure, the difference between the conservative and baseline
WTP estimate is quite large. As we discuss below, our primary
conclusions remain valid under either approach.
III.C. Introduction of Food Stamps
Third, we construct an MVPF for the impact of the intro-
duction of the Food Stamp Program, today known as the Supple-
mental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP). This example
illustrates how we incorporate potential spillovers of adult-
targeted policies onto children.
The Food Stamp Program provides in-kind transfers to
low-income families that can be used on food. Its introduction in
the 1970s was staggered across counties in the United States.36
35. Note we should think of this as a “private” not a “social” willingness to pay.
It assumes that parents are willing to pay $10,000 out of their own pocket to have
a 1% reduction in infant mortality. It is important to note that society may well be
willing to pay more than $1M. In the language of the social welfare function, this
suggests that the population has a high social marginal utility of income, ηj.
36. This variation was initially studied by Currie and Moretti (2006) in Cal-
ifornia and extended nationally by Almond, Hoynes, and Schanzenbach (2011),
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/3/1209/5781614 by guest on 29 September 2024


UNIFIED WELFARE ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES 1235
Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2012) exploit this variation to analyze
its impact on labor income and welfare participation of adult
beneﬁciaries; Almond, Hoynes, and Schanzenbach (2011) study
its effect on birth outcomes. Bailey et al. (2019) use the same
variation to study its impacts on the adult earnings of children
whose parents received food stamps.
1. Costs.
The ﬁrst component of our total costs is the average
yearly beneﬁt from food stamp enrollment, equal to $2,904. To
this, we add the ﬁscal externality resulting from the effects on
both adults and children. For adults, Hoynes and Schanzenbach
(2012) document large yet imprecise reductions in earnings of
$3,650 that imply a ﬁscal externality of $471 from reductions
in tax revenue—roughly $0.16 per $1 of food stamps provided.
For children, Bailey et al. (2019) ﬁnd increases in earnings in
adulthood corresponding to 7.1% for six full years of childhood
exposure to food stamps between the ages of zero and ﬁve. In
Online Appendix E, we show that this corresponds to an estimated
increase in tax revenue of $0.24 per $1 of food stamps for every
family with a child aged 0–5. We then multiply this by 0.35, the
fraction of SNAP beneﬁts received by households with children
age 0–5. We subsequently multiply by 1.32, the average number
of children in these households. This suggests that for each $1
in food stamp spending, the resulting effects on children increase
government revenue by $0.11.37 Taken together, these estimates
imply that every $1 of spending on food stamps costs $1.05.38
2. WTP. We provide a willingness to pay from three compo-
nents. First, the envelope theorem suggests that individuals are
Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2012), Hoynes, Schanzenbach, and Almond (2016),
and Bailey et al. (2019).
37. We assume no impact on children at older ages, but clearly such effects
could alter the MVPF. In Section V, we discuss the implications for a policy targeted
to families with children aged 0–5; this leads to a larger MVPF.
38. Our costs estimates here are constrained by the set of observed outcomes
that we can reliably translate into effects on the government budget. For example,
Hoynes, Schanzenbach, and Almond (2016) report that the introduction of food
stamps was associated with a reduction in adult metabolic syndromes. Although
our earnings estimates likely capture the effect of those health changes on labor
supply, we lack a reliable way to measure the impact of those health changes on
health care utilization. Future work documenting long-run health impacts that
reduce (increase) government spending on medical care could lead to a higher
(lower) MVPF than we estimate here.

THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
willing to pay for the mechanical cost of SNAP beneﬁts, which
we estimate to be $1,809. We arrive at this number by taking
the $3,650 increase in earnings and noting that SNAP beneﬁts
decline with earnings at a 30% phaseout rate. This means that
$1,095 of the food stamp cost is the result of a cost increase from
behavioral responses. Consequently, our point estimate suggests
individuals value $0.62 for each $1 spent by the government on
food stamps.39 Second, we incorporate the WTP for reductions in
infant mortality and increases in longevity among their children.
As in the case of Medicaid in Section III.D, we assume this is
given by the reduction in child mortality multiplied by a value of
a statistical life (VSL) of $1M (2012US$). We add to that value
the number of years of increased longevity multiplied by a quality
of adjusted life-year (QALY) of $20k (2012US$). This leads to
an additional WTP of $0.02. Last, we incorporate an additional
willingness to pay because of increases in after-tax income among
those who received food stamps as children. These estimates of
after-tax income are based on the earnings gains we calculate
above. Combining costs with willingness to pay creates an MVPF
of 1.04 (95% CI of [−0.97, ∞]).40
It is important to note in this case that statistical uncertainty
in these estimates is quite high. The combination of substantial
earnings reductions among parents and large earnings gains
among children mean that we cannot reject MVPFs of 0 or ∞. We
return to this uncertainty in more detail in Section VI.A when
we discuss the value of additional research or data access in
reducing sampling uncertainty.
III.D. Paycheck Plus in New York City
Fourth, we measure the MVPF of the Paycheck Plus program.
This construction illustrates how we create the MVPF from RCTs.
39. It is also worth noting that this willingness to pay is nearly identical to the
value we would receive if we did not apply the envelope theorem in this context, but
rather used estimates from Whitmore (2002) suggesting that food stamps have a
trade value of at least 65%. For our “conservative” willingness to pay speciﬁcation,
we make both the envelope theorem and trade value modiﬁcations and ﬁnd that
the MVPF falls to 0.39.
40. In Online Appendix E, we also explore several alternate speciﬁcations
and ﬁnd that these produce only small changes to the MVPF. For example, we
assume a higher VSL of $9M and a QALY of $180k and ﬁnd an MVPF of 1.22.
We incorporate the impact of reduced incarceration based on effects estimated in
Bailey et al. (2019) and costs of incarceration from Heckman et al. (2010). We ﬁnd
that the MVPF rises from 1.04 to 1.07.

UNIFIED WELFARE ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES 1237
It also provides guidance on the ideal set of measures future
researchers could construct to more directly estimate the MVPF
associated with RCTs.
The Paycheck Plus program is modeled after the Earned
Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC provides income subsidies to
low-income workers that are intended to encourage employment.
If workers face high marginal tax rates due to the beneﬁt schedule
for means-tested transfers such as food stamps, the EITC may
offset those high rates. While the EITC generally targets adults
with children, the Paycheck Plus program in New York City
conducted an RCT to evaluate the provision of EITC-like beneﬁts
to single adults without dependents—a group not traditionally
eligible for signiﬁcant EITC beneﬁts. The credit is worth up to
$2,000 a year and is available over three years (2014–2016 ﬁscal
tax years with bonuses paying out in 2015–2017).
Miller et al. (2017) estimate the effect of the policy on income,
employment, and after-tax income for the ﬁrst two years of the
policy, which we translate here into their implied MVPF.41 We
begin with costs.
1. Cost.
The cost of the policy is the observed causal effect of
the policy on the government budget.42 To measure the costs, let Tj
denote the tax schedule faced by the control (j = 0) and treatment
(j = 1) groups. Let y j
i denote individual i′s earnings if they face
the j = 0, 1 tax/transfer schedule. The cost is then given by:
(5)
Cost = E

T 0 
y0
i

−E

T 1 


.
41. As discussed in Online Appendix D, the current set of results from the third
year do not include sufﬁcient information to form the MVPF in as precise a manner
as we do here; but we note how imposing a reasonable additional assumption
suggests that the third-year effects lead to a very similar MVPF also near 1.
42. In the context of an RCT, our approach measures the welfare impact of
randomly assigning additional people to the treatment as opposed to the control
group. As a result, one can use the reduced-form results to form our welfare
analysis (i.e., one need not separately isolate a LATE/TOT). The denominator
is the causal effect of this assignment on the budget and the numerator is the
aggregate WTP by members of the control group to be in the treatment group. As
a result, whether our welfare analysis can be externally generalized to a different
policy with different take-up of beneﬁts would depend on how its treatment effects
vary across the population.

1238
THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
Because Paycheck Plus is an RCT, we compute equation (5)
using the difference in tax and transfer revenue obtained by the
government. In 2014, the causal impact on government costs was
$621; in 2015, this cost was $453. Combining these values, the
cost is $1,074.
2. WTP. We use the envelope theorem to estimate the WTP
for Paycheck Plus. In 2014, the average bonus paid is $1,399
among those who take it up, and 45.9% of people do so. The en-
velope theorem suggests that participants do not value the full
$1,399 subsidy dollar for dollar. This is because part of this cost
reﬂects the impact of behavioral responses. To the ﬁrst order, those
who entered the labor force to obtain the transfer are indifferent
between working and not working. Miller et al. (2017) ﬁnd a causal
effect of the program on the extensive margin labor supply of 0.9%.
Absent behavioral responses, this implies that 45% of the sample,
as opposed to 45.9%, would have received the transfer had they not
changed their behavior. Consequently, 98% of the transfer ( 45
45.9)
is valued by the beneﬁciaries, which implies a WTP of $630 for
the transfers in 2014.43 Repeating this calculation using the data
from 2015 yields a WTP of $441. This suggests a two-year WTP of
$1,070. The estimated WTP of $1,070 combined with the net cost
of $1,074 implies an MVPF of 0.996 (which rounds to 1 in Table II).
One can also construct an MVPF separately using the 2014 or
2015 transfers and responses. This yields similar MVPFs of 1.014
and 0.973. This dynamic similarity will be a recurring theme
among transfer programs to adults. It means that a static model
of the labor market distortions provides a reasonable approxi-
mation to measuring the MVPF for these policies. Every $1 the
government spends in transfers leads to a beneﬁt of roughly $1.44
43. This calculation assumes no intensive-margin responses. If one observed
the microdata from the RCT, one could allow for intensive-margin responses.
To the ﬁrst order, the WTP is the mechanical change in the tax schedule (i.e.,
replacing T0 with T1) holding behavior ﬁxed for each individual at y0
i :
(6)
WTP = E

T 0 

.
This means the ideal method of calculating WTP is to feed the distribution of
control group earnings into both the control and treatment group tax schedule.
In practice, this number is rarely reported, but future work conducting welfare
analyses of RCTs can directly construct this measure.
44. If the provision of work subsidies today leads to an increase in labor
earnings and thus tax revenue after the earnings subsidies have ended, then

Notes. This table presents our baseline estimates for each program in our extended sample, along with the category averages reported in the bold header rows in each category.
We exclude the welfare-to-work policies discussed in Section VI.C. For each policy, we report its MVPF, cost per dollar of programmatic spending, and willingness to pay per
dollar of programmatic spending. We also report bootstrapped 95% conﬁdence intervals with adjustments discussed in Online Appendix H. The ﬁnal column indicates whether the
program is included in the baseline estimates (and thus included in the category averages). Conﬁdence intervals are marked with an asterisk in cases where we infer p-values
using reported interval ranges. Programs in which the conﬁdence interval is either inferred from p-values or missing are excluded from category averages.

THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
III.E. Job Corps
Next we construct the MVPF for an RCT of Job Corps,
one of the largest vocational education programs in the United
States. This example illustrates how not all attempts to increase
children’s human capital and earnings have high MVPFs.
Established in 1964, Job Corps is administered by the U.S.
Department of Labor and provides job training and other services
to at-risk youth between the ages of 16 and 24 via a network
of centers run by local public and private agencies (Schochet,
Burghardt, and McConnell 2008). Between 1994 and 1996, the
National Job Corps study randomized 80,000 eligible applicants
into the program. We form an MVPF for this RCT using the
recent work of Schochet (2018), who links the original RCT to tax
data; we supplement this analysis with the earlier cost-beneﬁt
analysis of Schochet et al. (2006).
1. Cost. Schochet et al. (2006) estimates that the up-front
programmatic cost per recipient is $16,158. Schochet (2018) then
estimates the earnings impact of the program over the course of
20 years and ﬁnds minimal effects. In particular, they ﬁnd that
the program increases the present discounted value of participant
earnings by $121 using a 3% discount rate. We estimate that this
corresponds to an increase in tax and transfer revenue of $52.45
To these, we add the value of the products produced by the Job
Corps participants, which Schochet, Burghardt, and McConnell
(2008) estimates to be $220. Summing, this implies a net cost
of the program over 20 years of $15,886. Given the small effects
on earnings, we use this 20-year observed period as our baseline
estimate. In Online Appendix C, we show that if one extrapolates
the MVPF would be higher. We discuss these forecasts and their implied MVPFs
in Online Appendix F. To ensure our conclusions are not biased by including
policies for adults that do not have long-run follow-ups, in Section IV.C we conduct
robustness of all our analysis to policies where long-run follow-ups have been
measured.
45. As discussed in Online Appendix C, we form this estimate by summing
the observed increase in tax revenue for years 6–20 in administrative data from
Schochet (2018) combined with an application of the CBO tax rate to the earnings
effects for the ﬁrst ﬁve years. We note that a ﬁscal externality of $52 in this case
corresponds to a high implicit marginal tax rate. This is driven by a low tax rate
on initial earnings declines and a comparatively higher tax rate on subsequently
small earnings gains.

UNIFIED WELFARE ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES 1245
these earnings effects to age 65, the net cost of the program would
fall to $15,832 due to a small subsequent earnings gain.
2. WTP.
Following our approach for other policies that have
the potential to increase human capital, our baseline measure of
willingness to pay consists of the impact of the policy on after-tax
income.46 This is given by the $69 increase in after-tax earned
income plus the $2,314 component of the programmatic cost that
is a transfer to participants to pay for food and clothing while
participating in the program. Summing, this yields a WTP of
$2,383. Dividing by the government cost of $15,886 yields an
MVPF of 0.15. If one extrapolates the earnings affects to age 65,
the resulting MVPF is 0.18.47
III.F. Top Marginal Tax Rates
Finally we turn to the MVPF of top marginal tax rate
changes. This example illustrates how we can utilize estimates
from existing literature that attempts to provide empirical
guidance on optimal government policy (e.g., optimal top tax
rates, optimal unemployment insurance beneﬁts). Whereas those
literatures often consider the policies in isolation (e.g., optimal UI
policy), we can translate the estimates into their implied MVPF
to facilitate comparisons across policy domains.
46. A pure revealed-preference approach in this context could rely on the as-
sumption that job training is accessible in the private market at its programmatic
cost. One could then set willingness to pay equal to (or perhaps below) the up-front
cost of program enrollment. In contrast, setting willingness to pay equal to after-
tax earnings does not require the assumption that potential Job Corps enrollees
have perfect information about the returns to job training at the time of initial
enrollment. However, it does require that after-tax income is sufﬁcient to capture
willingness to pay. This means we do not incorporate any welfare costs from opti-
mization errors in consumption decisions that stem from program participation.
47. Our analysis here focuses on the MVPF of the entire treatment group.
However, it is worth noting that Schochet (2018) ﬁnds larger effects for the sub-
sample of age 20–24 participants, including a 2.4 percentage point reduction in
disability insurance receipt and a roughly $500 a year increase in earnings. To see
how this could lead to a different MVPF, we can ﬁrst take a back-of-the-envelope
calculation of a PDV of lifetime disability insurance receipt of roughly $200k con-
sistent with Von Wachter, Song, and Manchester (2011). This implies a cost saving
of $4,800. Second, we note that the $500 a year impact on earnings corresponds
to a PDV increase in earnings of $12.8k. Applying an approximate 20% tax and
transfer rate implies an increase in WTP by $10.2k and an increase in tax revenue
of $2.6k. This implies a net cost of roughly $8,600, which implies an MVPF of 1.18.

THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
There is a large theoretical and empirical literature dis-
cussing the optimal top marginal income tax rate, summarized
in Saez, Slemrod, and Giertz (2012). This literature notes that
a tax cut providing $1 in additional after-tax income is valued
at $1 by mechanical beneﬁciaries. In other words, the tax cut is
valued at cost by those who would receive it in the absence of any
behavioral response to the change in the tax code. As a result,
measuring WTP is straightforward. The cost to the government of
the tax policy is more difﬁcult. The cost of a tax cut that provides
$1 of beneﬁts in the absence of a behavioral response is given by
1 + FE, where FE is the impact of the behavioral response to the
tax cut on government revenue.
For top marginal tax rate reductions, Saez, Slemrod, and
Giertz (2012) and Diamond and Saez (2011) show that this FE
can be expressed as −
τ
1 −τ αϵETI, where α is the Pareto parameter
of the income distribution48 and ϵETI = 1 −τ
E[y]
dE[y]
d(1 −τ) is the elasticity
of taxable income for top earners with respect to the top marginal
“keep” rate of 1 −τ.49
The elasticity ϵETI has been estimated using various tax
reforms including the 1981 and 1986 tax decreases and 1993
increases in the top marginal income tax rate. We compute
the MVPF of the historical tax policy changes that allowed
researchers to identify ϵETI. The MVPF for each tax reform is the
ratio of WTP to cost,
1
1+FE:
(7)
MVPF =
1
1 −
τ
1 −τ αϵETI .
We translate estimates of ϵETI estimated from ﬁve major tax
reforms in 1981, 1986, 1993, 2001, and 2013, which are outlined
in Online Appendix F.
To take one example, consider the 1981 tax cut that reduced
the top marginal income tax rate from 70% to 50%. Saez (2003)
ﬁnds an estimate of ϵ = 0.311. We estimate α = 2.299 from Atkin-
son, Piketty, and Saez (2011). We plug these into equation (7).
We use marginal tax rates of τ = 75% and τ = 55% before and
after the reform, which include a 5% state tax adjustment.
48. Mathematically, α =
E[yi|yi⩾¯
y]
E[yi−¯
y|yi⩾¯
y] where ¯
y is the threshold over which the
top marginal income tax rate applies.
49. Online Appendix F provides a derivation.

UNIFIED WELFARE ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES 1247
Combining, and averaging FE obtained using the prereform
and postreform tax rates, we obtain FE =
τ
1 −τ αϵETI = 1.51. This
means that the 70% marginal tax rate appears to have been on
the “wrong side of the Laffer curve,” so reducing tax rates may
have increased revenue. In other words, the MVPF is inﬁnite and
the tax cut “pays for itself.” However, it is important to note the
statistical uncertainty in this estimate: we cannot reject an MVPF
of 1 or ∞.
In contrast, for later reforms we ﬁnd lower MVPFs. For
example for the 1993 tax increase from 31% to 39.6% we ﬁnd
an MVPF of 1.85 (95% CI of [1.19, 4.07]). This distinction is not
because of differences in ϵ, but results from the fact that τ was
much lower in 1993 than it was in 1981.
Comparison to the “Optimal” Top Tax Rate.
To compare
our results to the literature on the “optimal” top tax rates, it is
helpful to consider the case studied in Diamond and Saez (2011)
where society is assumed to place no weight on the additional
consumption of the rich. If the social welfare weights, ηi, are
equal to 0 for top earners, then the optimal tax is set to maximize
government revenue: τ is chosen to be at the peak of the Laffer
curve. This occurs when taxes are set so that the net cost to the
government of providing a tax cut is 0, or FE = −1.
This approach then makes the additional assumption that
the elasticity, ϵETI, and α do not change when the tax rate changes.
Solving for the optimal tax rate then implies τ ∗=
1
1 + αϵETI .
For α = 2.299 and ϵETI = 0.311, this implies τ ∗= 58%
inclusive of state and federal tax rates. The fact that this number
is slightly below 70% is consistent with our ﬁnding of an inﬁnite
MVPF for the 1981 reform, in which tax rates were around
70%. In contrast to this optimal tax approach, the MVPF does
not impose an assumption that society places no weight on the
consumption of the rich.
IV. MAIN RESULTS: TARGETING KIDS VERSUS ADULTS
We construct the MVPF for each policy in our sample. Here,
we present all our baseline MVPF estimates and outline our
main results. As noted, details on our MVPF constructions are
provided in Online Appendices A–F.

FIGURE III
MVPF Estimates by Age of Policy Beneﬁciary
This ﬁgure presents MVPF estimates for all policies in our baseline sample. For
each MVPF, we plot them as a function of the average age of the policy’s beneﬁcia-
ries. In cases where both parents and children potentially beneﬁt, we assign the
age of the individuals with the highest willingness to pay. Where policies within
a category have the same age, we stagger these ages around this common value

these estimates at 5. We separately report cases where the MVPF is inﬁnite on

IV.A. Kids
We begin our discussion with the MVPFs of policies targeting
children. Figure III presents the MVPF for each policy on the
vertical axis plotted by the average age of the beneﬁciaries of the
policy on the horizontal axis.50 Each dot represents the MVPF of
a particular policy, with labels provided in Table I.
50. In cases where both parents and children are beneﬁciaries of the policy, we
assign the age of the “economic” beneﬁciary based on who has the highest WTP.
For example, when analyzing the Movement to Opportunity (MTO) experiment,
which provided housing vouchers and counseling to parents with children, the age
shown is the average age of the children in the household. This is because the
policy induced higher earnings among the children, leading them to have a higher
WTP for the policy than their parents.

The ﬁgure reveals our primary result: direct investments in
children have historically had the highest MVPFs, often paying
for themselves. In addition to the evidence on the Medicaid expan-
sions and admission to FIU, we also ﬁnd high MVPFs for other ed-
ucation and child health policies. For example, Wherry et al. (2018)
document that the discontinuous Medicaid coverage eligibility for
children born after September 30, 1983 led to reduced medical
costs and chronic conditions in adulthood. In Online Appendix D,
we calculate that the up-front costs are fully repaid in the long run
from reduced Medicaid and uncompensated care costs, leading to
an inﬁnite MVPF. More generally, all four major health insurance
expansions to children studied in the past 50 years have MVPFs
in excess of 10, with three of them paying for themselves.51
In addition to health policies, we ﬁnd large MVPFs for edu-
cation policies. The widely studied Perry Preschool program has
an MVPF of 43.61; the more expensive Abecedarian model has an
MVPF of 11.89 (neither of these estimates are statistically distin-
guishable from ∞).52 In contrast with the idea that the returns to
human capital investment diminish rapidly with age (Heckman
2006), we ﬁnd there is potential for high MVPFs investments
throughout childhood. We ﬁnd an inﬁnite MVPF for increased
K–12 spending due to school ﬁnance equalization as studied
in Jackson, Persico, and Johnson (2016).53 We also ﬁnd inﬁnite
MVPFs for several college policies, such as admissions to FIU and
51. The only policy that does not have an inﬁnite MVPF is the introduc-
tion of Medicaid. For this policy, we directly incorporate MVPF estimates from
Goodman-Bacon (2017). This working paper includes estimated impacts through
age 55; our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that it is likely that forecast-
ing these effects through 65 would lead the policy to pay for itself as well.
52. To harmonize these estimates with other programs, we do not include the
beneﬁts to the government from reduced crime. This is both because these costs are
difﬁcult to quantify and most papers do not estimate impacts on crime outcomes.
If we include a forecast of reduced government spending on the criminal justice
system and policing, our point estimates suggest that Perry Preschool paid for
itself. However, the standard errors of these estimates also signiﬁcantly increase.
Including these costs for Abecedarian also increases its MVPF, but the policy does
not appear to pay for itself.
53. It is important to note that we only analyze one paper on K–12 education
spending because of limitations in existing evidence on long-term outcomes. While
there is a large literature looking at the effect of school spending on test scores, we
lack a reliable method to translate these effects into long-run impacts. Jackson,
Persico, and Johnson (2016) demonstrate the potential for high returns to K–12
education, but future work is needed to robustly establish the presence of high
returns to K–12 investment.

the provision of CalGrants to low-income students.54 A key insight
of our results is that many policies targeting children do not face
the classic budgetary trade-off. Instead, those expenditures pay
for themselves in the long run.
Before drawing too many conclusions about each data point
in Figure III, it is important to note there is sampling uncertainty
inherent in our estimates. Figure IV, Panel A plots each MVPF
along with its 95% conﬁdence interval. In some cases, our
estimates are relatively precise. For example, both the Medicaid
expansion to pregnant women and infants and admissions to FIU
have conﬁdence intervals that reject any ﬁnite MVPF. We can
rule out any positive net cost to the government. In many other
instances, however, the conclusions at the individual policy level
are less clear due to the sampling variation in the underlying
estimates. For example, the 1990 health care expansion to
children born after September 30, 1983 has a conﬁdence interval
ranging from 0.26 to inﬁnity. In other words, we cannot with 95%
conﬁdence reject the hypothesis that the policy paid for itself, nor
can we reject the hypothesis that the policy provides much less
than $1 of beneﬁts per dollar of government spending.
To reach more precise conclusions at a broader level, we pool
across policies using category averages. We imagine a new policy
that spends $1 of initial program cost on each policy j in category
J containing NJ policies. We then construct the MVPF of this
category-average policy as:

where the numerator is the average willingness to pay per dollar

to policies investing in older youth, the policies in our sample affect a range of
subpopulations. As a result, further work is needed to assess how the rate of
return on investment varies for a given child over the life cycle.
55. We construct this average measure, as opposed to a precision-weighted
average or other measure, because it corresponds to a feasible policy at the time
of initial implementation. It is straightforward for the government to construct a
policy that spends an equal amount on each of these programs.

Net Government Costs per Dollar of Programmatic Spending
This ﬁgure presents estimates of costs normalized by initial programmatic for

estimates as a function of the average age of each policy’s beneﬁciaries within
category. Bootstrapped 95% conﬁdence intervals with adjustments discussed in

and college policies have historically had high or inﬁnite MVPFs.
One dollar of spending across each of the policies in each of these
categories has an MVPF of ∞in child education (95% CI of [17.8,
∞]), ∞in child health (95% CI of [24.8, ∞]), and ∞in college
policies (95% CI of [4.2, ∞]).
We can dig deeper into these category averages by focusing on
the net costs to the government of these policies (the denominator
in our formula in equation (8)). Figure V computes the average
net cost to the government per $1 of programmatic expenditure
spent evenly across the policies in each category. This allows us
to explore the extent to which different types of policies have
paid for themselves. For example, $1 invested in the four major
Medicaid expansions to children has paid back an estimated

UNIFIED WELFARE ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES 1253
$1.78. In other words, the spending actually generated $0.78 of
surplus to the government in the long run.56
Having established this primary result, it is important to
qualify that these patterns do not hold uniformly across policies.
There is considerable variation in MVPFs from policy to policy.
For example, we ﬁnd lower MVPFs ranging from −0.23 to 1.48 for
job-training policies, such as an estimate of 0.15 for Job Corps—
a program targeted toward at-risk youth.57 We also analyze 14
examples of college policies where the MVPFs fall below 2.58
In most cases, this is because those policies represent trans-
fers to existing students, rather than expenditures that increase
attainment.59 In some cases, expenditures may even negatively
affect student attainment. For example, Cohodes and Goodman
(2014) analyze the impact of the Adams Scholarship in Mas-
sachusetts. They ﬁnd that this merit aid program does not induce
more students to go to or complete college. Rather, it induces indi-
viduals to change colleges to attend in-state schools where they are
56. Analogously, Appendix Figure II presents willingness to pay per dollar of
programmatic spending. For our baseline WTP measures, we ﬁnd very similar pat-
terns: much higher estimates of

for child policies than for policies
targeting adults.
57. The one potential exception to this is the recent Year Up RCT, analyzed in
Fein and Hamadyk (2018), who document large increases in earnings in the two
years after initial implementation. As we discuss in Online Appendix C, if these
earnings gains persist for an additional 5 years, the MVPF would be 2.78, and if
they persist for 21 years, the MVPF would be inﬁnite. In addition, in estimates
outside of our sampling frame, the nine-year follow-up results from the sectoral
training program Project Quest suggest an MVPF of 1.52, which increases to an
inﬁnite MVPF if projected to age 65. This suggests a high value to future work
estimating the continued persistence of these more promising sectoral training
programs.
58. Our analysis also demonstrates the limitations of the traditional way that
research papers report the impact of college expenditures. It is very common for
papers to note the percentage point increase in enrollment associated with $1,000
in expenditures. The difﬁculty with that approach is that it doesn’t account for the
number of inframarginal students receiving the beneﬁt. Providing $1,000 to 10% of
the school-age population to achieve a 3.6 percentage point increase in enrollment
may be a very efﬁcient investment, while providing $1,000 to 80% of the school-
age population to achieve a 3.6 percentage point increase is mostly a transfer to
existing students. For this reason, there are cases where we ﬁnd substantially
different MVPFs for policies that had similar percentage point enrollment effects.
59. In Section IV.C we discuss how our results on college expenditures vary
with the method of our MVPF calculation. Although we ﬁnd persistently high
MVPFs when long-run earnings outcomes are observed, we ﬁnd lower MVPFs
when we project earnings gains from attainment outcomes.

eligible to use the scholarship. The change in schooling actually
results in a fall in graduation rates arguably due to switching from
more selective schools with higher graduation rates. Incorporat-
ing these schooling declines, we calculate that the program has an
MVPF of 0.72. Job training or education polices like this one do not
substantially increase human capital and so they do not recoup
meaningful portions of their initial costs via higher tax revenue.
We also ﬁnd lower MVPFs for transfers to disabled children,
such as an MVPF of 0.76 for expanded eligibility for Supplemental
Security Income (SSI) at age 18 analyzed in Deshpande (2016). It
is important to note that spending on these policies may increase
social welfare, even though they have lower MVPFs. Decisions
about optimal policy are determined by the welfare weights the
government places on policy beneﬁciaries. If the government
makes it a priority to provide support for disabled children, these
SSI expansions may be welfare enhancing.
IV.B. Adults
In contrast to policies targeting children, we generally ﬁnd
lower MVPFs (e.g., 0.5–2) for policies targeting adults. For
example, in contrast to the nearly inﬁnite MVPFs for child health
insurance expenditures, we ﬁnd MVPFs ranging from 0.40 to
1.63 for the six health insurance policies in our baseline sample
targeted to adults.60 Along the same lines, we ﬁnd MVPFs ranging
from 0.43 to 1.03 for unemployment insurance policies, 0.74–0.96
for disability insurance expansions, and 1.12–1.20 for earned
income tax credits. We ﬁnd MVPFs of housing vouchers ranging
from 0.65 using assignment of vouchers in Chicago via lottery
(Jacob and Ludwig 2012) to 0.91 using an RCT of the provision of
housing vouchers to families on cash welfare (Mills et al. 2006).
The lower MVPFs reﬂect the fact that many of these expen-
ditures have been shown to reduce labor earnings through labor
market distortions. As depicted in Figure V, the average cost per
$1 of government spending on these adult policies is generally
60. Those adult health insurance estimates include expenditures such as the
subsidies in the Massachusetts health insurance exchange prior to the Affordable
Care Act. In that case, Finkelstein, Hendren, and Shepard (2019) exploit discon-
tinuities in the subsidy schedule to estimate both individuals’ willingness to pay
for insurance and the cost those individuals impose on the government. Translat-
ing these estimates into an MVPF suggests values ranging from 0.800 to 1.09 for
different subsidy eligibility levels.

UNIFIED WELFARE ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES 1255
slightly above $1. This result contrasts with our ﬁndings on expen-
ditures directed toward children, for whom labor market earnings
tended to rise, leading to a decline in net costs. There are a limited
number of cases, such as the Job Training Partnership Act and Na-
tional Supported Work Experiment, where investment in adults
sought to increase earnings by increasing human capital. Those
policies, however, did not produce persistent earnings gains, so
they still yield relatively low MVPFs.61 The MVPFs of job-training
programs for adults over the age of 23 range from 0.44 to 1.48.62
As with our main results for policies targeting children, these
ﬁndings represent general patterns. They do not hold uniformly
across all policies targeting adults. In particular, there are two
types of adult policies that tend to result in higher MVPFs:
reductions of high marginal tax rates for top incomes and policies
with indirect spillovers onto children.
1. Top Tax Rates.
We ﬁnd high MVPF point estimates for his-
torical reductions in the top marginal tax rate when the initial tax
rate lay at 50% or higher. In the case of the 1981 reform, the tax bill
reduced the top federal marginal tax rate on income from 70% to
50%. Using estimates of the elasticity of taxable income from Saez
(2003), we calculate that the MVPF is ∞(95% CI of [0.94, ∞]).
This implies that marginal tax rates were beyond the top of the
Laffer curve prior to 1981. Our conﬁdence interval, however, sug-
gests this estimate contains considerable sampling uncertainty.63
61. For this reason, we calculate the MVPFs of job-training programs based
on the number of years of earnings effects observed, rather than projecting the
effects out to age 65. In Online Appendix C we discuss the sensitivity of our results
to that assumption.
62. The presence of high MVPFs for spending on children and low MVPFs for
spending on adults does not necessarily indicate that families are failing to opti-
mize their investment decisions. Even if families are fully informed of available
investment decisions, a simple model of parental investment could produce these
outcomes if parents are credit constrained. A higher MVPF for investment in chil-
dren could occur if low-income parents expect intergenerational regression to the
mean such that their children will earn more than them. That would produce lower
marginal utilities of income for those children, and therefore increase the return
on spending. In addition, this logic also suggests that when parents are given cash
transfers, they would rationally not spend all of it on their children despite high
returns—this is because their marginal utility of their own consumption is also
high.
63. As we discuss in Online Appendix F, these estimates appear to have consid-
erable uncertainty not just from sampling uncertainty but also model uncertainty:

1256
THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
Along the same lines, we analyzed the 1986 reform and found an
MVPF of 44.27, with a conﬁdence interval ranging from 2.37 to ∞.
Although this may be considered by some to be suggestive
evidence for Laffer effects in tax policy, it is important to ap-
proach that conclusion with considerable caution. In the case
of the 1981 reform our conﬁdence intervals suggest we cannot
rule out an MVPF close to 1. In other words, we cannot rule
out the conclusion that the policy produced no positive ﬁscal
externality. Moreover, estimates of the impacts of recent reforms
have produced substantially smaller MVPFs (e.g., 1.16 for the
2013 top tax rate increase). Compared with these ﬁndings on
taxes, our results suggest stronger evidence for the presence of
Laffer effects when investing in young children.
2. Spillovers onto Children.
We also ﬁnd that spending on
adults may have high MVPFs if those policies have spillover ef-
fects on children. For example, Chetty, Hendren, and Katz (2016)
study the long-run impact of the MTO experiment, which gave
families residing in public housing projects a voucher and coun-
seling to assist them in moving to lower-poverty neighborhoods.64
Chetty, Hendren, and Katz (2016) document that the program
signiﬁcantly increased later-life earnings for young children, but
they ﬁnd null or even slightly negative effects on earnings for
children who were teenagers at the time their parents obtained
the vouchers. Combining these effects across all subgroups
suggests the effects on the young children outweigh the adverse
effects on the older children, leading to an inﬁnite MVPF.65 This
using different taxable income estimates from existing literature studying these
reforms can generate wide variation in the MVPFs of these tax reforms, preventing
precise conclusions about their MVPFs.
64. Because the program was targeted to families already in public housing
and because the cost of public housing is similar to the cost of a voucher, the
primary marginal cost of the program was the cost of the counseling (roughly
$3,783 per family).
65. Not all policies providing beneﬁts to parents generate such large spillover
effects onto children. For example, Price and Song (2018) ﬁnd that the Nega-
tive Income Tax experiment led to a reduction in children’s earnings in adult-
hood, which partially explains its low MVPF of −0.01. In other cases, such as
the provision of housing vouchers in Chicago, and the provision of housing vouch-
ers to families on AFDC and the expansion of AFDC beneﬁts, there is sugges-
tive evidence that positive spillovers on children are small. In those cases, re-
searchers have documented that the policies have limited effects on outcomes such
as test scores, college attendance, and birthweight. Appendix Figure III, Panel A

UNIFIED WELFARE ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES 1257
high MVPF is driven solely by child outcomes, as the policy has
no signiﬁcant effect on economic outcomes for adult beneﬁciaries.
One policy with a substantial degree of uncertainty about
potential
spillovers
onto
children
is
the
EITC.
Appendix
Figure III, Panel C shows how our MVPF estimates would change
if one attempted to impute effects on children using different
estimates from previous literature. In particular, we take the
MVPF for the 1993 OBRA tax reform and supplement that
estimate with spillover effects of the EITC estimated in other
contexts. Projecting earnings effects based on child test scores
produces MVPFs that range from 3.48 to ∞, while incorporating
effects on college attendance produces MVPFs from 0.84 to 1.12.66
Incorporating the work of Bastian and Michelmore (2018) on
long-term earnings would result in an inﬁnite MVPF, suggesting
that the policy pays for itself.67
This uncertainty highlights the importance of understanding
the potential spillovers onto children. It also reinforces our
conclusion that policies raising children’s human capital often
have the highest MVPFs. We return to this issue in Section VI.A,
where we use the MVPF framework to quantify the value to
governments of more precise estimates for potential long-run
effects of policies on children.
IV.C. Robustness
Creating these MVPF estimates inevitably requires that we
make a number of judgment calls regarding the set of causal
effects included and the methodology used to translate those
effects into an MVPF. Here, we provide a short summary of the
robustness of our main conclusions to those assumptions.68
presents results for policies in our baseline sample where child effects are observed.
Panels B and C show how the MVPFs change when effects on children are incor-
porated or removed from the MVPF calculation.
66. The college effects are restricted to a small subset of recipients, so it is
unsurprising that the MVPFs remain small.
67. We exclude these results from the baseline estimates because Bastian and
Michelmore (2018) do not estimate the effect of a particular EITC expansion, but
rather pool across many state and federal policy changes. In Online Appendix F,
we note the impact of incorporating their estimates. The fact that these impacts
matter is consistent with our broader conclusions that potential spillovers onto
children can generate high MVPFs for adult-targeted policies.
68. Online Appendix J details an extensive set of robustness analyses.

THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
Constructing the MVPF for policies with dynamic effects
requires the choice of a discount rate. Although our baseline
approach assumes 3%, Appendix Figure IV shows that higher dis-
count rates do not substantively change our conclusions. Discount
rates of 7% or 10% produce slightly lower MVPFs for child-
targeted policies (more so for young children), but we still ﬁnd
those policies have higher MVPFs than policies targeting adults.
Our baseline approach uses the cross-sectional life cycle
earnings proﬁle to forecast lifetime effects from observed earnings
changes. Our results are robust to alternative methods of fore-
casting earnings, such as assuming no income growth over the life
cycle. The baseline sample also includes some policies targeting
children for which effects on income are not directly measured.
Most notably, we include college policies where researchers have
observed a measure of attainment such as initial enrollment,
college credits, or degree receipt. In those cases we forecast
income impacts using estimates from Zimmerman (2014) on the
returns to college. Online Appendix J provides a discussion of
how our estimates vary depending on the use of intermediate
outcomes to construct long-run forecasts. In particular, Appendix
Figure III shows the effects of restricting our analysis to policies
where earnings are directly observed. We continue to ﬁnd high,
often inﬁnite MVPFs for these child-targeted policies.
In many cases, our MVPFs for policies targeting adults rely
upon estimates of short-run earnings impacts. Consequently,
one might be worried that our low MVPFs for adult policies are
driven by policies for which we do not observe long-run impacts.
In order to assess this, Appendix Figure VII, Panel B restricts
the analysis to the subset of policies for which we observe at least
ﬁve years of income estimates. We continue to ﬁnd higher MVPFs
for policies targeting children.69
Our baseline willingness to pay approach often relies on
measures of a policy’s impact on after-tax income. Appendix
Figure VI, Panel A reports our MVPFs using our conservative
69. Related to this, the pattern of higher MVPFs for children could be driven by
longer payoff periods for children relative to adults, as children have their entire
lives to experience higher earnings. However, the length of the payoff period is
not what is driving our results—even restricting child beneﬁts to accrue only up
to age 45 or 55, we ﬁnd similar high returns for child-targeted policies. Rather,
the patterns are generally driven by a higher positive impact on per-year future
earnings for policies targeting children.

UNIFIED WELFARE ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES 1259
measure of willingness to pay. Although the willingness to pay
measures are much lower, we continue to ﬁnd high MVPFs for
policies targeting children, generally exceeding 5 on average. This
is to be expected as many policies analyzed have very low net costs,
leading to large MVPFs even when willingness to pay is small.
One might also be concerned that the causal effects incor-
porated in our MVPFs may vary in quality due to variation
in the underlying techniques used to produce those estimates.
Appendix Figure VII, Panel C shows our results remain the same
when restricting our sample to policies evaluated via randomized
controlled trial, lottery, or a regression discontinuity design. The
results are also robust to restricting our sample to peer-reviewed
publications. In all these robustness analyses, direct childhood
investments continue to have the highest MVPFs.
Finally, one might worry that MVPFs for child policies were
high in previous decades but have declined over time—perhaps
as the government takes advantage of high-return investments.
Appendix Figure IX assesses this by plotting the child- and adult-
average MVPFs separately by decade. We ﬁnd no evidence for
that pattern of decline. Instead, we ﬁnd high MVPFs for policies
targeting children throughout the past 50 years.70 The robustness
of high MVPFs for direct investments in children over time may
suggest the presence of fundamental political constraints to
enacting policies in which the beneﬁts have a long time horizon.71
IV.D. Publication Bias
All of the robustness analyses above take the estimates from
existing literature as given. However, one might be concerned that
the research and publication process suffers from the problem
70. The one exception to this pattern is the low average MVPF among child
policies implemented in the 1970s. The child policies in that decade primarily
consisted of job-training programs that did not have signiﬁcant effects on children’s
earnings.
71. There are a range of forms that these political constraints might take.
For example, it could be that governments (and politicians) apply a much higher
discount rate, requiring projects to pay off over short horizons. Alternatively, un-
derinvestment might occur because these policies require spending by state and
local governments, but much of the beneﬁts accrue to the federal tax system.
Hence, local incentives may not be sufﬁcient to make efﬁcient investments. It
may also be that the high MVPF policies are undersupported because low-income
children have little political power. We leave a formal analysis of these potential
mechanisms for future work.

of publication bias, where studies are published only if they ﬁnd
clear positive (or negative) effects. In particular, one might worry

statistically signiﬁcant positive effects on children in adulthood.
Conversely, one could imagine that research on adults is more
likely to be published if it ﬁnds statistically signiﬁcant evidence
of distortionary or negative effects on adult outcomes.
To address this, we implement the approach developed in
Andrews and Kasy (2019).72 They provide a method to test
and correct for the effect of publication bias on the observed
set of estimates. Online Appendix K discusses the details of
our implementation of their approach. Table III documents the
evidence of publication bias in our estimates.
The results suggest the presence of a moderate degree of
publication bias. In the baseline sample, we ﬁnd studies of child
outcomes are 3.7 times more likely to be published if they ﬁnd
positive effects on children with p < .10 relative to a ﬁnding of
no statistically signiﬁcant effect. In contrast, we ﬁnd that studies
72. We thank Isaiah Andrews and Max Kasy for their invaluable guidance in
implementing these procedures.

on adult policies are 11 times more likely to be published if they
ﬁnd signiﬁcant distortionary effects on outcomes.
Despite evidence of publication bias in our samples, Appendix
Figure VIII, Panel A shows that correcting for the observed degree
of publication bias in this manner does not affect our conclusion
of higher MVPFs for policies targeting children. Although we ﬁnd
a slight decrease in the MVPFs for child education policies, such
as preschool programs, the general patterns are quite similar
to our baseline results. Moreover, Appendix Figure VIII, Panel
B shows that even if we assumed that statistically signiﬁcant
estimates of positive effects on children are 35 times73 more likely
to be published, our primary conclusions still hold.
V. MAPPING THE MVPFS TO THEORY
The MVPF provides an empirical method for evaluating the
effectiveness of different policies for improving social welfare.
Having established the key patterns of the data, it is natural
to place our empirical results into the context of theoretical
literature on optimal government policy. In this section, we
outline how our results speak to that theory.
1. Optimal Taxation.
To begin, the MVPF measures the
price of redistributing to different policy beneﬁciaries. In this
sense, the approach is related to a large body of theoretical and
empirical optimal tax literature in the spirit of Mirrlees (1971)
and Saez (2001).
As previously explained using the Okun’s bucket logic, the
ratio of MVPFs across two different tax changes measures the
price of moving money between the respective beneﬁciaries. In
general, optimal tax theory suggests that a progressive planner
should be willing to incur efﬁciency losses to move resources from
the afﬂuent toward the lower regions of the income distribution.
The MVPF provides an empirical means of testing that basic
prediction: the MVPF of tax changes should increase with the
income of the beneﬁciaries.
Figure VI, Panel A explores the relationship between the
MVPF of each tax policy change we analyze and the income levels
of the associated beneﬁciaries. Consistent with this prediction,
73. A publication bias of 35x is the degree of publication bias documented in
Andrews and Kasy (2019) for small-sample experimental economics studies.

MVPF by Income of Beneﬁciaries
Panel A shows MVPFs for tax and transfer policies in our baseline sample
against the income of their economic beneﬁciaries. Panel B adds in-kind transfers
to parents and direct expenditures on children (child education, health, job train-
ing, and college policies). See Figure III for an explanation of the color scheme. The
income measures should be considered approximations, as not all papers report
consistent measures of incomes of their samples. We include all papers for which
we are able to obtain a measure of income of the beneﬁciaries, and we attempt
to normalize these measures to correspond to a notion of individual income per
adult in the household at age 30. All conﬁdence intervals are 95% bootstrapped
conﬁdence intervals with adjustments discussed in Online Appendix H.

UNIFIED WELFARE ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES 1263
we observe an upward slope. For example, the 1993 tax reform
(OBRA93) simultaneously raised top marginal tax rates and
expanded the EITC. The MVPF of the increased top tax rates led
to an MVPF of 1.85 (95% CI of [1.19, 4.07]), and the expansion
of the EITC led to an MVPF of 1.12 (95% CI of [0.82, 1.21]).
This suggests the tax schedule created under the 1993 reform
is optimal if one is indifferent to providing $1.85 to top earners
versus $1.12 to those on the EITC. To the extent one’s social
preferences strictly prefer $1.12 to low earners (or strictly prefer
$1.85 to top earners), our results suggest that more progressive
(regressive) taxation than the 1993 schedule would be optimal.74
Although our MVPF estimates for tax changes are loosely
consistent with the preferences of a progressive planner, this is
no longer the case when we consider policies targeting children.
As shown in Figure VI, Panel B, there is no clear relationship
in our sample between MVPFs and the incomes of beneﬁciaries
when including direct investments in children. This means that,
historically, investments in the next generation have been more
efﬁcient than transfers within generations.75
2. In-Kind versus Cash Transfers.
The low MVPFs for
policies targeting very low-income households raises the question
of whether other methods of redistribution—perhaps through
in-kind transfers—can be more effective than cash.76 Figure VII
74. Our estimate for the MVPF of the 1993 EITC is based on evidence from
Meyer and Rosenbaum (2001) on the ﬁscal externality associated with the labor
supply responses of single women. It is worth noting, however, that there is con-
siderable debate over the ﬁscal externalities associated with the EITC. On the
one hand, several recent papers have argued that reductions in transfers have
offset a substantial portion of the cost of historical EITC expansions (Hoynes and
Patel 2018; Bastian and Jones 2019). These large ﬁscal externalities can produce
inﬁnite MVPFs (Bastian and Jones 2019). On the other hand, recent debates have
argued that the effects are overstated in the current literature because the impact
of the EITC expansions cannot be disentangled from the effects of contemporane-
ous welfare reforms (Kleven 2019). These conﬂicting estimates suggest there is a
high value to future work that reconciles these ﬁndings.
75. We develop this argument formally in Online Appendix L, where we relate
this logic to the nonexistence of a social welfare function that can rationalize our
results of high MVPFs for low-income children but low MVPFs for low-income
adults.
76. There is a large theoretical debate on this question, which largely centers
around the applicability of the Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem (Atkinson and Stiglitz
1976; Hylland and Zeckhauser 1981). When utility satisﬁes a “weak separability”
assumption, one would expect that the MVPF for an in-kind transfer would fall

MVPF by Income of Beneﬁciaries: Cash versus In-Kind Transfers
This Figure presents MVPFs as a function of the average income of beneﬁciaries
for tax and transfer policies (shown in Figure IX, Panel A) combined with our
estimates for in-kind transfer policies. The income measures should be considered
approximations, as not all papers report consistent measures of incomes of their
samples. We include all papers for which we are able to obtain a measure of
income of the beneﬁciaries, and we attempt to normalize these measures to
correspond to a notion of individual income per adult in the household at age

adds the MVPF estimates for housing and food subsidies to the
estimates provided in Figure VI, Panel A for cash transfers and
tax credits. Broadly, we ﬁnd a pattern consistent with our general
result: in-kind transfers are most effective when they induce
spillover effects onto children.
For example, the housing vouchers in Chicago (Jacob and
Ludwig 2012; Jacob, Ludwig, and Kapustin 2014) and the
provision of Welfare to Work housing vouchers (Mills et al. 2006)
ﬁnd minimal spillover effects on children. This means that the

distortionary impact on adults’ earnings leads them to have
MVPFs below that of distributionally equivalent tax cuts. In
contrast, the MTO experiment explained previously increased
earnings of young children by a sufﬁcient amount to pay for the
cost of the in-kind policy (the policy had an inﬁnite MVPF with
a 95% conﬁdence interval of [−2.80, ∞]). Similarly, the spillover
effects onto children for the introduction of food stamps policy
leads to an MVPF of 1.04. Both point estimates suggest these
in-kind transfers are as efﬁcient or more efﬁcient than cash
transfers as a result of the spillovers onto children.77
3. Tagging.
There is a large literature in optimal policy
design focused on improving efﬁciency by targeting the right
subset of individuals. In general, this work focuses on the use of
“tags”—characteristics of program eligibility that are generally
not manipulable (Akerlof 1978).78 With that in mind, previous
literature has identiﬁed recipient age as a potentially valuable
tag for optimal government policy. Consistent with that work, we
observe that the MVPFs of certain policies differ substantially
based on the age of the recipients.
For example, our analysis of the MTO experiment ﬁnds an
inﬁnite MVPF with a conﬁdence interval of [−2.80, ∞]. That said,
the result masks substantial heterogeneity in the program’s ef-
fects. In families with children younger than 12, the MVPF is in-
ﬁnite with a conﬁdence interval contained at inﬁnity. In families
with children older than 12, the MVPF is negative, as their point
estimates imply a reduction in earnings. Along the same lines, our
analysis of the introduction of food stamps produces an MVPF of
1.04. This MVPF is partly buoyed by large positive effects on chil-
dren ages 0–5 (Bailey et al. 2019). If we excluded any effects on
children, the MVPF would fall from 1.04 to 0.54. By contrast, if
we restricted our analysis to families with young children and
assumed that causal effects of food stamp introduction remained
the same for that targeted policy, we would ﬁnd an MVPF of 2.28.
77. In relation to the Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem, the violation of the weak
separability assumption for these policies comes not from a short-term change in
earnings but from the long-run indirect impact on children.
78. If the tag were manipulable, then individuals not intended as beneﬁciaries
of the policy could distort their behavior to obtain the beneﬁt. To the ﬁrst order,
they would not value the transfer by the envelope theorem, consequently lowering
the MVPF of the policy.

THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
Despite this substantial variation in MVPFs by the age
of policy recipients, we do not report subgroup-speciﬁc MVPFs
in our main tables. This is a deliberate choice to restrict our
analysis to policy changes deﬁned by explicit identiﬁcation
conditions established in existing work. Reporting MVPFs for
subgroups requires the additional assumption that the observed
behavioral response to the policy among the relevant subgroup
is not impacted by the provision of the policy to other subgroups.
Although this may be plausible in certain cases, we have no
disciplined way of adjudicating its plausibility across all possible
permutations of subgroup analysis. Instead, we highlight the
potential for age-speciﬁc tagging but refrain from more deﬁnitive
statements regarding subgroup-speciﬁc welfare impacts.
VI. LESSONS FOR FUTURE WORK
In this section, we discuss three implications for future
economic research. First, we show how the MVPF framework
facilitates a straightforward method to quantify the value of
future work that reduces the statistical uncertainty in our esti-
mates. Second, we show the value-added provided by measuring
the MVPF relative to what is provided by a more traditional
cost-beneﬁt analysis. Third, we discuss how the intuitions of the
MVPF framework might inﬂuence future empirical designs. The
key is to design experiments in a way that facilitates measuring
willingness to pay. In particular, we discuss how 27 different
welfare reform programs in the 1980s–90s randomized upwards
of 100,000 participants into RCTs, but the nature of the research
designs makes it infeasible to conduct reliable welfare analysis.
VI.A. Value of Information in Evidence-Based Policy Making
Our MVPF estimates measure the welfare impact of a
range of government policies. Although it is our hope that these
estimates can be useful for a policy maker seeking to conduct
“evidence-based” policy, it is quite clear from Figure IV, Panel A
that many of our individual policy estimates contain considerable
sampling uncertainty. Here, we show how one can use the MVPF
framework to understand the value of future research that
reduces the uncertainty in our estimates. The MVPF framework
provides a measure of the value of information because it
is a price: it measures the price faced by the government to

redistribute across beneﬁciaries of different types of policies.
A welfare-maximizing government should be willing to pay to
reduce the uncertainty in these prices, just as consumers would
be willing to pay to learn the true value of the products they buy.
There are many ways one could conceptualize reducing
the various sources of modeling and sampling uncertainty in
our estimates. In this section, we develop a simple approach
to measure the value of reducing sampling uncertainty. We
defer an exhaustive treatment to future work. We use this
example to illustrate the value of future research that increases
estimate precision, perhaps through improved access to larger
administrative longitudinal data sets.79
Our conceptual experiment is organized as follows: suppose
a policy maker is considering whether to raise revenue to spend
an additional $1 on policy j. The policy has a net cost to the
government of Gj and a willingness to pay of WTPj per dollar
of programmatic cost. The policy maker does not know the true
values of WTPj and Gj. Instead, we assume she only observes
the estimates,
ˆ
WTP j and ˆ
Gj, and their sampling distributions.80
We assume the policy maker has an uninformed prior about the
impact of the policy so that the estimated sampling distribution
reﬂects her belief about the policy’s effects.
For simplicity, we assume the policy is ﬁnanced with a tax
change that targets the same beneﬁciaries and has an MVPF of
1. A budget-neutral policy that increases taxes to spend on policy
j has a welfare gain of
U

WTP j, Gj
	
= WTP j −Gj.
Ideally, the policy maker would wish to pursue this policy if and
only if U(WTPj,Gj) > 0 (i.e., the policy increases welfare). In
practice, the policy maker only observes estimates and sampling
distributions of these values. We assume these estimates are
unbiased but noisy estimates of the truth (e.g., E[ ˆ
Gj|Gj] = Gj).
Utility is linear in WTPj and Gj, so the policy maker will choose
the policy if and only if
ˆ
WTP j > ˆ
Gj. The expected utility of this
79. The focus here is on reducing uncertainty among the observed outcomes of
each program. Uncertainty regarding unobserved causal effects remains beyond
the scope of this exercise.
80. For simplicity, we assume programmatic costs are known and equal to
their point estimates.

Now suppose that instead of spending $1 on the policy, the
policy maker can invest a fraction of this dollar, vj, into learning
more about the WTPj and Gj of the policy before making this
decision. We begin by considering a case where spending vj allows
the policy maker to perfectly learn WTPj and Gj before deciding
whether to invest in the policy. Once informed, the government
chooses to pursue the policy if and only if U(WTPj, Gj) > 0. Now it
can decide to pursue the policy if and only if the true WTP exceeds
the true costs. In that case, the net utility to the government is

where the ﬁrst term is the surplus from investing the remaining

of equation (9) is taken with respect to the distribution of the true
parameters, (WTPj, Gj), given the estimates, (

we assume uninformed priors, this distribution is parameterized
by the sampling distribution of the estimates. This implicitly
deﬁnes vinf o

for each policy in our sample as a function of the average age of the policy

1. Results.
We estimate the value of info in equation (9) both
for each individual policy and for our category averages. Figure
VIII presents the results of vinf o
j
for each policy, j, plotted relative
to the age of the policy’s beneﬁciaries. Broadly, we ﬁnd the highest
values of future research for policies with uncertain long-run
effects on children. For example, we estimate vinf o
FS = $0.50 for
the introduction of food stamps. Moreover, we also ﬁnd large
values of information for policies with potential indirect effects on
children and uncertain effects on adults. We also ﬁnd large values
of information for college subsidies to parents (shown in green;
color version available online). This reﬂects the fact that these
policies have highly uncertain effects on college attainment, and
small increases in attainment can translate into large gains. In
contrast, we ﬁnd smaller values of information for policies where
the effects have been already precisely estimated. For example,
we ﬁnd the evidence-based policy maker would be willing to
pay little to remove the statistical uncertainty in the estimated
impact of disability insurance on labor earnings (e.g., we estimate

the policy maker is willing to pay $0 to learn the precise impact
of assignment to a more lenient disability insurance judge). This
lower value of information reﬂects the relatively high precision
of existing estimates in those studies.
2. Administrative verus Survey Data: Long-Run Impacts of
Food Stamps.
Our estimates in Figure VIII report the value
of learning the true effect of the policy. In practice, the true
effect is never observable. That said, improved access to larger
administrative data sets can help obtain more precise effects
of government policies. For example, a policy maker can decide
whether a researcher should use a survey data set for the analysis
or obtain access to linked administrative data on the population.
To illustrate this decision, we consider the case of the intro-
duction of food stamps discussed in Section III.C. Earlier work
by Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2009) used the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics (PSID) survey data set to identify the long-run
effect of food stamps on children’s outcomes. More recently, Bailey
et al. (2019) used linked census data to estimate those effects
more precisely. Here, we imagine that a policy maker is deciding
whether to introduce food stamps based on the existing evidence.
Consider the hypothetical example that they know the PSID
estimates from Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2009),
ˆ
WTP
PSID and
ˆ
FE
PSID. Suppose that they can instead invest vCensus to learn the
estimates with the same statistical precision as those found in
Bailey et al. (2019) based on census data. Instead of learning the
true value of WTP and FE, the policy maker learns
ˆ
WTP
Census
and
ˆ
FE
Census. The policy maker will expect these estimates to
be drawn from the PSID sampling distribution but contain the
standard errors found in the census data estimates. The value of
learning the census estimates, vCensus, then solves

The left side of equation (10) is the expected value of investing
in administrative data at a price vCensus. The right side is the
expected value of the policy if she makes her decision using the
information in the PSID.
We reconstruct the estimates of the WTP and FE for the
introduction of food stamps using the estimates from Hoynes and
Schanzenbach (2009) in place of those in Bailey et al. (2019), nor-
malizing by the mechanical program cost. This yields an inﬁnite
point estimate for our MVPF, and we ﬁnd a willingness to pay
estimate of 6.06 (95% CI of [−12.07, 23.78]) and cost of −0.19 (95%
CI of [−5.19, 4.92]). These estimates are notably less precise than
those using the results from Bailey et al. (2019) that use census
data, which generate a WTP of 1.09 (95% CI of [−2.45, 4.55]).
Plugging these estimates into equation (10) suggests the
policy maker would be willing to invest $0.24 per dollar of
investment in the food stamp program to learn the long-run
estimates from census data instead of PSID data. This exercise
illustrates that if the policy maker only knew the PSID estimates,
there would be a large value in learning additional information
before making this investment decision.
This is, of course, a stylized exercise. We are imagining a
policy maker that sees the ex post evaluation of a policy prior
to making her decision—something that is clearly not feasible.
The goal here is merely to illustrate potential value of expanding
access to administrative data sets that can generate more precise
estimates of long-run policy effects.
VI.B. Comparison to Beneﬁt-Cost Ratios
While we focus on computing the MVPF for each policy, the
most common form of welfare analysis in previous literature is
beneﬁt-cost analysis, as in equation (4). With that in mind, we
compare our results to the beneﬁt-cost ratios for the same policies.
Figure IX, Panel A plots the beneﬁt-cost ratio for a deadweight
loss of φ = 50% as in Heckman et al. (2010) as a function of the
age of the beneﬁciary of the policy. Our general conclusion about
the high returns to investment in children would remain true
even if one used a beneﬁt-cost ratio instead of the MVPF. The
average beneﬁt-cost ratio is 4.13 for child education, 5.30 for child
health, and 6.78 for college policies. In contrast, we ﬁnd smaller
beneﬁt-cost ratios for adult policies—often less than 1.

UNIFIED WELFARE ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES 1273
To directly compare the two methods of welfare analysis,
Figure IX, Panel B plots the beneﬁt-cost ratio on the vertical
axis (again for φ = 50%) against the MVPF on the horizontal
axis. In general, we ﬁnd a fairly monotonic relationship—policies
with high beneﬁt-cost ratios also have high MVPFs. There are,
however, some notable distinctions. For example, the Medicaid
expansion to children born after September 30, 1983, has an inﬁ-
nite MVPF but a BCR of just 1.37. Similarly, the 1981 top tax rate
reduction has an inﬁnite MVPF but a beneﬁt-cost ratio of 1.67. By
the standards of beneﬁt-cost ratios, these policies may not appear
all that desirable, even though the MVPF point estimates imply
that they pay for themselves and provide a Pareto improvement.
The difference between the MVPF and beneﬁt-cost ratio in
these cases reﬂects the fact that the beneﬁt-cost ratio places all
causal effects of the program in the numerator while the MVPF
incorporates effects based on their incidence. In particular, the
numerator of the MVPF captures the effects on beneﬁciaries while
the denominator captures all effects on the government budget.
In measuring the welfare effects of the 1983 Medicaid expansion
and the 1981 tax cut, MVPF places all ﬁscal externalities in
the denominator. The results show us that these policies have
substantial beneﬁts and limited or no net government cost. In
the beneﬁt-cost ratio framework these reforms would have been
interpreted as high-cost policies with substantial beneﬁts.
The second crucial distinction between the MVPF and beneﬁt-
cost ratio is how the two approaches conceptually close the budget
constraint. While the MVPF closes the budget constraint by com-
paring MVPFs of different policies (and aggregating using Okun’s
bucket as in equation (3)), the same consistency does not exist
in the beneﬁt-cost ratio approach. In many cases, beneﬁt-cost
analysis includes no discussion of closing the budget constraint.
In cases where the concept is addressed, it is customary to close
the budget constraint in the same manner regardless of the policy
context. For example, BCRs in Heckman et al. (2010) and Garc´
ıa
et al. (2016) imagine that the policy was funded by an increase
in the marginal tax rate that led to a distortion in tax revenue
and a deadweight loss of φ. Consequently, the deadweight loss
parameter φ in equation (4) is not context dependent.
To see how this matters, consider the 1993 tax reform
that simultaneously raised top marginal income tax rates and
expanded the EITC. One could, in principle, use a beneﬁt-cost
ratio to evaluate whether the EITC expansion was desirable. As
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/3/1209/5781614 by guest on 29 September 2024


1274
THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
shown in Figure IX, Panel A, the beneﬁt-cost ratio for the 1993
EITC expansion is 0.74 after adjusting for a 50% deadweight
loss. The costs exceed the beneﬁts and so, if the government were
applying a strict beneﬁt-cost test, we would not expect this policy
to be implemented. This is because the hypothetical 50% cost of
raising the funds is too large to justify the expenditure.
That said, the goal of the EITC expansion was to provide
redistributive beneﬁts to low-income workers. Its MVPF is 1.12,
near the highest among policies targeting adults. Rather than
ruling this out as a means of redistribution, we can compare
the MVPF of the EITC to the MVPF of a tax increase used to
fund this policy. Comparisons of MVPFs correspond to precise
statements of social welfare using Okun’s bucket. As noted, the
MVPF point estimate for the 1993 top tax rate change is 1.85. If
society prefers giving $1.12 to a low-income worker on EITC to
giving $1.85 to a high-income individual facing the top marginal
income tax rate, then the policy is welfare enhancing despite its
relatively low beneﬁt-cost ratio.
VI.C. Welfare Reform: Lessons for Future RCTs
We end with a lesson of how an MVPF perspective can help
inform the design of RCTs. Throughout, we aimed to include all
possible MVPFs in the categories we considered. We included any
policy where we thought we could provide reasonable measures
of both costs and WTP. One set of notable omissions are the state-
level welfare reforms made by states that sought to increase fam-
ily self-sufﬁciency. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, states
experimented with a range of reforms to cash welfare programs
that imposed term limits, provided job training and other educa-
tional services, and provided job search and placement assistance.
The omission of these reforms is not because they were not
analyzed. Many states rigorously evaluated the effect of these
reforms. Upward of 100,000 participants were enrolled into 27
RCTs nationwide (Greenberg, Deitch, and Hamilton 2010). These
RCTs measured and provided a clear estimate of the net cost
of each reform. However, the design of the policies enacted in
each state makes it difﬁcult to understand their welfare effects.
Generally, programs contained both a carrot and a stick.81 As
81. Welfare reform experiments were expected to place no additional costs on
the federal government and so it is natural that states bundled increases in some
types of ﬁnancial support with potential decreases in others.

a result, we cannot even accurately sign the WTP. As noted by
Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation (MDRC) who
implemented the evaluations of these policies,82 “all [programs]
contained a core quid pro quo arrangement in which the gov-
ernment would offer education, training, job search assistance,
and support services to people receiving cash welfare, while
most recipients—the majority of them single parents—would be
required to participate in such services in order to qualify for
beneﬁts.” Although we can evaluate whether the government
saved money, we do not know if the people in these programs
beneﬁted from their participation. It may be that government
revenue gains were the result of expanded job opportunities due
to program participation. In that case, willingness to pay would
be positive. By contrast, it may be that the government revenue
gains were the result of stricter attendance requirements that
drove individuals off welfare. In that case, willingness to pay
would be negative.83
This highlights the value of isolating the carrot and the stick
into separate RCTs.84 It also demonstrates the value of designing
experiments to estimate individual WTP for nonmarket goods
such as job training, job search assistance, or other educational
policies. In Appendix Figure X, we conduct a range of bounding ex-
ercises that attempt to construct lower and upper bounds on WTP
for these welfare reform programs. Unfortunately, the bounds
are very wide. In many cases, the policies are Pareto dominated,
MVPF < 0, under one set of assumptions and represent a Pareto
improvement, MVPF = ∞, under another set of assumptions.85
Despite substantial expenditures on the evaluation of these re-
forms, the designs of these reforms in each state make it difﬁcult
82. See https://www.mdrc.org/project/evaluations-state-welfare-work-
programs#design-site-data-sources (accessed on July 7, 2019).
83. Previous work (Greenberg, Deitch, and Hamilton 2010) has conducted a
cost-beneﬁt analysis of these reforms by assuming willingness to pay is given by
after-tax earnings. However, if the term limit is what causes individuals to choose
to move off of welfare and into the labor market (thus increasing earnings), the
envelope theorem would suggest the WTP is negative, even if after-tax earnings
increase.
84. Welfare reform RCTs have been criticized for not experimentally varying
each of the components of welfare reform (see Grogger and Karoly 2005). The
MVPF framework suggests bundling carrots and sticks into a single treatment is
particularly problematic for conducting welfare analysis, because it is difﬁcult to
know even whether willingness to pay is positive or negative.
85. In fact, we ﬁnd policies that follow this pattern in each subcategory of
welfare reform programs. These subcategories include job search assistance.

to know whether this massive shift in providing welfare beneﬁts
to low-income families led to an increase or decrease in welfare.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this article, we examine the MVPF of 133 different histori-
cal policies over the past half-century in the United States. We ﬁnd
a clear and persistent pattern that direct investments in children
have yielded the largest MVPFs. There is a large “bang for the
buck” associated with a range of expenditures on children from
early education to child health insurance to college expenditures.
We also demonstrate that in a meaningful number of cases,
these policies pay for themselves. In particular, when government
expenditures boost human capital, the resulting increase in
net government revenue can offset the policy’s up-front costs.
From a taxpayer perspective, these expenditures on children are
investments, rather than just transfers.
We ﬁnd that opportunities for high-return investments in
children have persisted across policy categories for many decades.
This is, however, no guarantee that all future investment in these
categories will produce high MVPFs. Indeed, we ﬁnd that MVPFs
vary substantially within policy categories. Low-return policies
exist even in high-return categories. This highlights the value of
further understanding the mechanisms behind the high MVPFs
of successful historical investments.
Even in cases where there is existing research, much remains
unknown about the welfare consequences of government policy. To
that aim, we quantify the value of future work that uses new data
to reduce estimate uncertainty. We show that in many cases, an
evidence-based policy maker seeking to maximize social welfare
should be willing to make substantial budgetary expenditures to
learn more about policy effectiveness. In particular, our results
highlight the value of expanded use of administrative data for
policy analysis.
The 133 policies included in this article are just a small subset
of those that could be analyzed using the MVPF. We do not discuss
the MVPF of crime policies, environmental policies, macroeco-
nomic stabilization policies, or infrastructure policies, among
many others. With careful tracking of willingness to pay and net
costs, the MVPF can be used in any of these contexts and can guide
cost-beneﬁt analyses. We leave that analysis for future work.

APPENDIX FIGURE I
Income Projections Using the ACS
Panels A and B present a decomposition of the elements that make up our
income projection process for the examples in Section III.A. The “Pop Avg” series
is constructed in each case from the 2015 ACS and using a 0.5% wage growth
assumption. At each age “Pop Avg” gives the mean wage level that would prevail
in the population for individuals of that age, when individuals in the treatment
group for the relevant policy were that age. This number is constructed by
assuming that the mean wage level at each age will rise (and has previously
risen) by 0.5% in each year. The “Control Forecast” series is constructed by taking
an estimate of earnings for a relevant control group at a particular age or range of
ages, then calculating the implied proportion of the “Pop Avg” series at those ages,
then projecting the series forwards (and backwards) as this constant fraction
of “Pop Avg.” The “Treatment” series is constructed by summing the observed
treatment effects in dollar terms and the “Control Forecast” series. To construct
the “Predicted” series we take the ﬁnal value of the “Treatment” series, then
calculate the ratio of this value to the value of the “Pop Avg” series at that same
age, before applying this ratio to the “Pop Avg” series up to age 65. See Online
Appendix I for further details of this methodology.

Willingness to Pay per Dollar of Programmatic Spending
This ﬁgure presents estimates of WTP normalized by initial programmatic
spending for each category-average group of policies in our baseline sample. We
plot these estimates as a function of the average age of each policy’s beneﬁciaries
within category. Bootstrapped 95% conﬁdence intervals with adjustments
(discussed in Online Appendix H) are shown for the category averages. The
normalized willingness to pay of individual policies are shown in smaller dots,
color-coded to align with their respective categories.

Robustness to Child Effects
This ﬁgure assesses the impact of observing child effects on our estimates as
a function of the average age of the economic beneﬁciaries of the policy. Panel
A restricts our sample to the subset of policies for which we observe estimates
of the impact of the policy on children. In addition, Panel B shows projected
MVPFs for additional policies that do not observe earnings impacts but do observe
another intermediate outcome such as birthweight (AFDC), college attendance
(housing vouchers to AFDC recipients), and test scores (housing vouchers in
Chicago). Panel C reports the MVPF for the EITC under alternative methods of
incorporating indirect effects on children through test scores, college attendance,
and income of EITC more broadly.

Robustness to Alternative Interest Rates
This ﬁgure presents our MVPF estimates as in Figure III and the category av-
erages as in Figure IV, Panel B under alternative real interest rate assumptions,
as opposed to our baseline speciﬁcation of 3%. Panel B differs slightly from our
baseline speciﬁcation because we restrict to the subset of policies for which we are
able to vary the discount rate (e.g., we exclude papers where we directly import
an MVPF that relied on a particular discount rate). We omit conﬁdence intervals
for ease of viewing, but caution the reader that the estimate for the college adult
category has a CI that includes 0 and inﬁnity.

Speciﬁcation Robustness
This ﬁgure presents the category-average MVPFs from Figure III using a range

speciﬁcations. Panel A replaces our point estimate WTP measures with our
conservative measures of WTP. We report bootstrapped 95% conﬁdence intervals
with adjustments (discussed in Online Appendix H) for each category average.
Panel B replaces our baseline income projection procedure with a procedure that
assumes zero income growth over the lifecycle. We use our restricted sample of
policies for this speciﬁcation. See Online Appendix I for further details.

Sample Restrictions
This ﬁgure presents the category-average MVPFs from Figure III using a range
of alternative sample restrictions. Panel A considers our restricted sample that
drops estimates for which we are forecasting earnings effects based on a policy’s
impact on college attendance. Panel B restricts the sample to only policies for
which earnings outcomes are estimated for at least ﬁve years of follow-up after
the policy. For this panel we show group averages even for groups with a single
policy. Panel C restricts the sample to policies whose identiﬁcation strategy is a
randomized control trial, lottery, or regression discontinuity. Panel D restricts to
policies whose primary analyses have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
We report bootstrapped 95% conﬁdence intervals with adjustments (discussed in
Online Appendix H) for each category average.

APPENDIX FIGURE VIII
Publication Bias
This ﬁgure presents the MVPF estimates from Figure III and category averages
in Figure IV, Panel B using estimates corrected for publication bias from the
method of Andrews and Kasy (2019). Panel A reports estimates using the
corrections using the publication likelihood estimated from our model that
imposes jumps at p = .05 and p = .10, as shown in Table III, columns (3) and
(6). In Panel B we report corrected estimates under an assumption that child
policies are 35 times more likely to be published if they ﬁnd a positive effect on
children’s outcomes (and we assume no publication bias for adult policies or for
child policies that ﬁnd negative effects on children). This 35 times corresponds to
the estimated publication bias implied by a large-scale replication of experimental
economics papers by Camerer et al. (2016) (Table 1 of Andrews and Kasy 2019
reports that insigniﬁcant results are 0.029 times as likely to be published). We
do not report conﬁdence intervals for these estimates (to our knowledge there is
no well-accepted method of constructing such intervals); but we refer readers to
Figure IV, Panel B to note that some of these category averages are imprecise.

APPENDIX FIGURE IX
MVPFs by Decade
This ﬁgure presents MVPFs for all policies evaluated in the article based on
the year in which the policy was implemented. Policies are divided into categories
based on their decade of implementation and the average age of their economic
beneﬁciaries. For policies implemented in each decade there are two categories—
policies with beneﬁciaries over age 23 and policies with beneﬁciaries aged 23 or
younger. Within each decade by age category we construct the MVPF for a hypo-
thetical policy that allocates $1 of programmatic spending equally among all the
policies in the category. This is the same approach used to create MVPF estimates
for policy domains in previous ﬁgures. The capped lines show the 95% bootstrapped
conﬁdence intervals with adjustments discussed in Online Appendix H.

Welfare Reform
This ﬁgure presents estimates of the MVPF of 27 welfare reform policies
discussed in Section VI.C. We report MVPF estimates using three potential
measures of WTP: (i) cost, the mechanical cost of the program incurred by the
government, excluding any ﬁscal externalities from behavior change. Estimates
from this speciﬁcation are denoted by circles. (ii) Change in transfer payments
(welfare, food stamps, and Medicaid). Estimates from this speciﬁcation are
denoted by Xs. (iii) Change in post-tax income, which includes the change in
participants’ incomes due to changes in employment and the change in their
transfer payments. Estimates from this speciﬁcation are denoted by triangles.
