A fresh page sits in the carriage, replacing the one from last night. Now faceup on the desk, it serves as a partial transcript of our conversation. i want to tell you everything things ive never told anyone else yes about that night because i trust you But I don\u2019t trust Lenora. Not entirely. She\u2019s capable of so little yet accused of so much, and I remain torn between wanting to protect her and the urge to suspect her. But if she wants to tell me what happened, I\u2019m willing to listen. Even though I suspect most of it will be lies. Or, worse, the complete, terrifying truth. The fingers of Lenora\u2019s left hand drum against the keys. She\u2019s eager to begin. I take a deep breath, nod, and help her type the first sentence. The thing I remember most \n The thing I remember most--the thing I still have nightmares about--is when it was all but over. I remember the roar of the wind as I stepped onto the terrace. It blew off the ocean in howling gusts that scraped over the cliff before slamming directly into me. Rocked onto my heels, I felt like I was being shoved by an invisible, immovable crowd back toward the mansion. The last place I wanted to be. With a grunt, I regained my footing and started to make my way across the terrace, which was slick from rainfall. It was pouring, the raindrops so cold that each one felt like a needle prick. Very quickly I found myself snapped out of the daze I\u2019d been in. Suddenly alert, I began to notice things. My nightgown, stained red. My hands, warm and sticky with blood. The knife, still in my grip. It, too, had been bloody but was now quickly being cleaned by the cold rain. I kept pushing through the wind that pushed back, gasping at each sharp drop of rain. In front of me was the ocean, whipped into a frenzy by the storm, its waves smashing against the cliff base fifty feet below. Only the squat marble railing running the length of the terrace separated me from the dark chasm of the sea. When I reached the railing, I made a crazed, strange, strangled sound. Half laugh, half sob. The life I\u2019d had mere hours ago was now gone forever. As were my parents. Yet at that moment, leaning against the terrace railing with the knife in my hand, the rough wind on my face, and the frigid rain pummeling my blood-soaked body, I only felt relief. I knew I would soon be free of everything. I turned back toward the mansion. Every window in every room was lit. As ablaze as the candles that had graced my tiered birthday cake eight months earlier. It looked pretty lit up like that. Elegant. All that money glistening behind immaculate panes of glass. But I knew that looks could be deceiving. And that even prisons could appear lovely if lit the right way. Inside, my sister screamed. Horrified cries that rose and fell like a siren. The kind of screams you hear when something absolutely terrible has happened. Which it had. I looked down at the knife, still clenched in my hand and now clean as a whistle. I knew I could use it again. One last slice. One final stab. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. Instead, I tossed the knife over the railing and watched it disappear into the crashing waves far below. As my sister continued to scream, I left the terrace and went to the garage to fetch some rope. That\u2019s my memory--and what I was dreaming about when I woke you. I got so scared because it felt like it was happening all over again. But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re most curious about, is it? You want to know if I\u2019m as evil as everyone says I am. The answer is no. And yes. \n ONE The office is on Main Street, tucked between a beauty parlor and a storefront that, in hindsight, feels prophetic. When I was here for my initial job interview, it was a travel agency, with posters in the window suggesting freedom, escape, sunny skies. On my last visit, when I was told I was being suspended, it was vacant and dark. Now, six months later, it\u2019s an aerobics studio, and I have no idea what that might portend. Inside the office, Mr. Gurlain waits for me behind a desk at the far end of a space clearly meant for retail. Free of shelves, cash registers, and product displays, the place is too vast and empty for an office staffed by only one person. The sound of the door closing behind me echoes through the empty space, unnaturally loud. \u201cKit, hello,\u201d Mr. Gurlain says, sounding far friendlier than he did during my last visit. \u201cSo good to see you again.\u201d \u201cLikewise,\u201d I lie. I\u2019ve never felt comfortable around Mr. Gurlain. Thin, tall, and just a bit hawkish, he could very well pass for a funeral home director. Fitting, seeing how that\u2019s usually the next stop for most of those in the agency\u2019s care. Gurlain Home Health Aides specializes in long-term, live-in care\u2014one of the only agencies in Maine to do so. The office walls bear posters of smiling nurses, even though, like me, most of the agency\u2019s staff can\u2019t legally claim the title of one. \u201cYou\u2019re a caregiver now,\u201d Mr. Gurlain had told me during that fateful first visit. \u201cYou don\u2019t nurse. You care.\u201d The current roster of caregivers is listed on a bulletin board behind Mr. Gurlain\u2019s desk, showing who\u2019s available and who\u2019s currently with a patient. My name was once among them, always unavailable, always taking care of someone. I\u2019d been proud of that. Whenever I was asked what I did for a living, I summoned my best Mr. Gurlain impression and replied, \u201cI\u2019m a caregiver.\u201d It sounded noble. Worthy of admiration. People looked at me with more respect after I said it, making me think I\u2019d at last found a purpose. Bright but no one\u2019s idea of a good student, I\u2019d eked my way through high school and, after graduation, struggled with what to do with my life. \u201cYou\u2019re good with people,\u201d my mother said after I\u2019d been fired from an office typing pool. \u201cMaybe nursing is something you could do.\u201d But being a nurse required more schooling. So I became the next best thing. Until I did the wrong thing. Now I\u2019m here, feeling anxious, prickly, and tired. So very tired. \u201cHow are you, Kit?\u201d Mr. Gurlain says. \u201cRelaxed and refreshed, I hope. There\u2019s nothing better for the spirit than enjoying some time off.\u201d I honestly have no idea how to respond. Do I feel relaxed after being suspended without pay six months ago? Is it refreshing being forced to sleep in my childhood bedroom and tiptoe around my silent, seething father, whose disappointment colors our every interaction? Did I enjoy being investigated by the agency, the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services, the police? The answer to all of it is no. Rather than admit any of that to Mr. Gurlain, I simply say, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWonderful,\u201d he replies. \u201cNow all that unpleasantness is behind us, and it\u2019s time for a fresh start.\u201d I bristle. Unpleasantness. As if it was all just a slight misunderstanding. The truth is that I\u2019d spent twelve years with the agency. I took pride in my work. I was good at what I did. I cared. Yet the moment something went wrong, Mr. Gurlain instantly treated me like a criminal. Even though I\u2019ve been cleared of any wrongdoing and allowed to work again, the whole ordeal has left me furious and bitter. Especially toward Mr. Gurlain. It wasn\u2019t my plan to return to the agency. But my search for new employment has been a total bust. I\u2019ve filled out dozens of applications for jobs I didn\u2019t want but was crushed anyway when I never got called in for an interview. Stocking shelves at a supermarket. Manning the cash register at a drugstore. Flipping burgers at that new McDonald\u2019s with the playground out by the highway. Right now, Gurlain Home Health Aides is my only option. And even though I hate Mr. Gurlain, I hate being unemployed more. \u201cYou have a new assignment for me?\u201d I say, trying to make this as quick as possible. \u201cI do,\u201d Mr. Gurlain says. \u201cThe patient suffered a series of strokes many years ago and requires constant care. She had a full-time nurse\u2014a private one\u2014who departed quite suddenly.\u201d \u201cConstant care. That means\u2014\u201d \u201cThat you would be required to live with her, yes.\u201d I nod to hide my surprise. I thought Mr. Gurlain would keep me close for my first assignment back, giving me one of those nine-to-five, spend-a-day-with-an-old-person jobs the agency sometimes offers at a discount to locals. But this sounds like a real assignment. \u201cRoom and board will be provided, of course,\u201d Mr. Gurlain continues. \u201cBut you\u2019d be on call twenty-four hours a day. Any time off you need will have to be worked out between you and the patient. Are you interested?\u201d Of course I\u2019m interested. But a hundred different questions keep me from instantly saying yes. I begin with a simple but important one. \u201cWhen would the job start?\u201d \u201cImmediately. As for how long you\u2019d be there, well, if your performance is satisfactory, I see no reason why you wouldn\u2019t be kept on until you\u2019re no longer needed.\u201d Until the patient dies, in other words. The cruel reality about being an at-home caregiver is that the job is always temporary. \u201cWhere is it located?\u201d I ask, hoping it\u2019s in a far-flung area of the state. The further, the better. \u201cOutside of town,\u201d Mr. Gurlain says, dashing those hopes. They\u2019re revived a second later, when he adds, \u201cOn the Cliffs.\u201d The Cliffs. Only ridiculously rich people live there, ensconced in massive houses atop rocky bluffs that overlook the ocean. I sit with my hands clenched in my lap, fingernails digging into my palms. This is unexpected. A chance to instantly trade the dingy ranch home where I grew up for a house on the Cliffs? It all seems too good to be true. Which must be the case. No one quits a job like that unless there\u2019s a problem. \u201cWhy did the previous nurse leave?\u201d \u201cI have no idea,\u201d Mr. Gurlain says. \u201cAll I was told is that finding a suitable replacement has been a problem.\u201d \u201cIs the patient . . .\u201d I pause. I can\u2019t say difficult, even though it\u2019s the word I most want to use. \u201cIn need of specialized care?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the trouble is her condition, as delicate as it might be,\u201d Mr. Gurlain says. \u201cThe issue, quite frankly, is the patient\u2019s reputation.\u201d I shift in my seat. \u201cWho\u2019s the patient?\u201d \u201cLenora Hope.\u201d I haven\u2019t heard that name in years. At least a decade. Maybe two. Hearing it now makes me look up from my lap, surprised. More than surprised, actually. I\u2019m flabbergasted. An emotion I\u2019m not certain I\u2019ve experienced before. Yet there it is, a sort of anxious shock fluttering behind my ribs like a bird trapped in a cage. \u201cThe Lenora Hope?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Gurlain says with a sniff, as if offended to be even slightly misunderstood. \u201cI had no idea she was still alive.\u201d When I was younger, I hadn\u2019t even understood that Lenora Hope was real. I had assumed she was a myth created by kids to scare each other. The schoolyard rhyme, forgotten since childhood, worms its way back into my memory. At seventeen, Lenora Hope Hung her sister with a rope Some of the older girls swore that if you turned out all the lights, stood in front of a mirror, and recited it, Lenora herself might appear in the glass. And if that happened, look out, because it meant your family was going to die next. I never believed it. I knew it was just a variation on Bloody Mary, which was completely made up, which meant Lenora Hope wasn\u2019t real, either. It wasn\u2019t until I was in my teens that I learned the truth. Not only was Lenora Hope real, but she was local, living a privileged life in a mansion several miles outside of town. Until one night, she snapped. Stabbed her father with a knife Took her mother\u2019s happy life \u201cShe is very much alive,\u201d Mr. Gurlain says. \u201cGod, she must be ancient.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s seventy-one.\u201d That seems impossible. I\u2019d always assumed the murders occurred in a different century. An era of hoop skirts, gas lamps, horse-drawn carriages. But if Mr. Gurlain is correct, that means the Hope family massacre took place not too long ago, all things considered. I do the math in my head, concluding that the killings were in 1929. Only fifty-four years ago. As the date clicks into place, so do the final lines of the rhyme. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d Lenora said But she\u2019s the only one not dead Which is apparently still the case. The infamous Lenora Hope is alive, not so well, and in need of care. My care, if I want the assignment. Which I don\u2019t. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else available? No other new patients?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d Mr. Gurlain says. \u201cAnd none of the other caregivers are available?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re all booked.\u201d Mr. Gurlain steeples his fingers. \u201cDo you have a problem with the assignment?\u201d Yes, I have a problem. Several of them, starting with the fact that Mr. Gurlain obviously still thinks I\u2019m guilty but, without further evidence, has no legal grounds to fire me. Since the suspension didn\u2019t drive me away, he\u2019s trying to do it by assigning me to care for the town\u2019s very own Lizzie Borden. \u201cIt\u2019s just, I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d I fumble for the right words. \u201cConsidering what she\u2019s done, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d feel comfortable taking care of someone like Lenora Hope.\u201d \u201cShe was never convicted of any crime,\u201d Mr. Gurlain says. \u201cSince she was never proven guilty, then we have no choice but to believe she\u2019s innocent. I thought you of all people would appreciate that.\u201d Music starts up in the aerobics studio next door, muffled behind the shared wall. \u201cPhysical\u201d by Olivia Newton-John. Not about aerobics, although I bet those housewives working out in ripped sweatshirts and leg warmers don\u2019t care. They\u2019re simply content to be wasting money fighting off middle-age pudge. A luxury I can\u2019t afford. \u201cYou know how this works, Kit,\u201d Mr. Gurlain says. \u201cI make the assignments, the caregivers follow them. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with that, then I suggest we part ways permanently.\u201d I would love to do just that. I also know I need a job. Any job. I need to start building back my savings, which has dwindled to almost nothing. Most of all, I need to get away from my father, who\u2019s barely spoken to me in six months. I remember with a clarity so sharp it could break skin the last full sentence he directed my way. He was at the kitchen table, reading the morning paper, his breakfast untouched. He slapped the newspaper down and pointed to the headline on the front page. A floating feeling overcame me as I stared at it. Like this was happening not to me but to someone playing me in a bad TV movie. The article included my yearbook photo. It wasn\u2019t good, as photos go. Me trying to muster a smile in front of that blue backdrop set up in the high school gymnasium that appeared muddy and gray when rendered in dots of ink. In the picture, my feathered hair looked exactly the same as it did that morning. Numbed by shock, my first thought was that I needed to update my hairstyle. \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying\u2019s not true, Kit-Kat,\u201d my father said, as if trying to make me feel better. But his words didn\u2019t match his devastated expression. I knew he\u2019d said it not for my sake, but for his. He was trying to convince himself it wasn\u2019t true. My father threw the newspaper into the trash and left the kitchen without another word. He hasn\u2019t said much to me since then. Now I think about that long, fraught, suffocating silence and say, \u201cI\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll take the assignment.\u201d I tell myself it won\u2019t be that bad. The job is only temporary. A few months, tops. Just until I have enough money saved up to move somewhere new. Somewhere better. Somewhere far away from here. \u201cWonderful,\u201d Mr. Gurlain says without a hint of enthusiasm. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to report for duty as soon as possible.\u201d I\u2019m given directions to Lenora Hope\u2019s house, a phone number to call if I have trouble finding it, and a nod from Mr. Gurlain, signaling the matter is settled. As I leave, I sneak a glance at the bulletin board behind his desk. Currently, three caregivers are without assignments. So there are others available. The reason Mr. Gurlain lied about that isn\u2019t lost on me. I\u2019m still being punished for breaking protocol and tarnishing the agency\u2019s sterling reputation. But as I push out the door into the biting air of October in Maine, I think of another reason I was given this assignment. One more chilling than the weather. Mr. Gurlain chose me because Lenora Hope is the one patient nobody\u2014not even the police\u2014will mind if I kill. \n TWO It takes me less than an hour to gather my belongings. I learned early on that a caregiver should pack light. A medical bag, a suitcase, and a box. There\u2019s no need for more than that. The medical bag is filled with the tools of my trade. Thermometer, blood pressure cuff, stethoscope. My parents gave me the black leather tote when I was first hired by Mr. Gurlain. Twelve years later, I\u2019m still using it, even though the zipper sticks and the leather is cracked at the corners. The suitcase is filled with a toiletry bag and my clothes. Bland, inoffensive slacks and cardigans ten years out of date. I\u2019ve long ago given up trying to be stylish. Comfort and thrift matter more. The box is filled with books. Paperbacks, mostly. They once belonged to my mother and bear the loving wear and tear of a voracious reader. \u201cYou\u2019re never alone when there\u2019s a book nearby,\u201d she used to say. \u201cNever ever.\u201d While I appreciate the sentiment, I also know it\u2019s a lie. For six months, I\u2019ve been surrounded by books, and I\u2019ve never felt more alone. All packed, I peek into the hallway to make sure there\u2019s a clear path to the back door off the kitchen. My father came home for lunch, which he sometimes does when a job site is nearby. He\u2019s now in the living room, watching TV and eating a sandwich while sunk deep into his La-Z-Boy. In the past six months, the two of us have become experts at avoidance. Full weeks went by in which we never saw each other. I\u2019ve mostly kept to my room, venturing to the kitchen only when I was certain my father was at work, asleep, or out with the girlfriend I\u2019m not supposed to know about. We haven\u2019t been introduced. I\u2019m only aware of her existence because I heard them talking in the living room last week, surprised by the sound of another woman\u2019s voice in the house. The next night, my father snuck out like a schoolboy, either too afraid to admit he\u2019s started dating again or too ashamed to risk my bumping into his new lady friend. Now it\u2019s me sneaking out, moving on tiptoes as I make two trips to my car, one for the suitcase and medical bag, one for the box of books. On the second trip, I find Kenny leaning against my Ford Escort. Clearly, he saw me with the suitcase and came out of the house next door to investigate. Staring at the box in my hands, he says, \u201cYou moving out?\u201d \u201cFor now, yeah,\u201d I say. \u201cMaybe for good. I got a new assignment.\u201d \u201cI thought you were fired.\u201d \u201cSuspended. It just ended.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d Kenny frowns. Rare for him. Normally he only sports a horny, hungry look. \u201cQuickie before you go?\u201d Now that\u2019s the Kenny I\u2019ve gotten used to seeing since we started sleeping together in May. Like me, he\u2019s currently out of work and living with his parents. Unlike me, Kenny is only twenty. He\u2019s my dirty little secret. Or, more likely, I\u2019m his. It started one afternoon when we were both lazing in our connecting yards at the same time, me with a Sidney Sheldon paperback, Kenny with a joint. We made eye contact across the lawn a few times before he said, \u201cNot working today?\u201d \u201cNope,\u201d I replied. \u201cYou?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d Then, because I was bored and lonely, I said, \u201cWant a beer?\u201d Kenny said sure. Which led to drinking. Which led to small talk. Which led to making out on the living room couch. \u201cYou want to fuck or something?\u201d Kenny eventually said. A month into my suspension and full of self-pity, I sized him up. He wasn\u2019t bad-looking, despite the mustache that drooped like a dead caterpillar under his nose. The rest of him was much better. Especially his arms, which were wiry, strong, and tanned. I could do\u2014and have done\u2014much worse. \u201cSure,\u201d I said with a shrug. \u201cWhy not?\u201d When it was over, I vowed never to do it again. I was eleven when Kenny was born, for God\u2019s sake. I remember his parents bringing him home from the hospital, my mother cooing at him, my father slipping an envelope of cash into his dad\u2019s sweaty palm. But when Kenny showed up at the back door two days later, looking like a stray dog seeking scraps, I let him in and guided him to my bedroom. That\u2019s how it\u2019s been once, twice, sometimes three times a week. I know the score. This isn\u2019t romance. Half the time we don\u2019t even talk. And even though I feel guilty about it, I also know I needed something besides reading to get through the long, lonely days. \u201cMy dad\u2019s inside,\u201d I tell Kenny. \u201cAnd my new patient is expecting me.\u201d I don\u2019t tell him just who that new patient is. I\u2019m afraid of what he\u2019ll think of me if I do. \u201cSure, I get it,\u201d Kenny says, doing little to mask his disappointment. \u201cSee you around, I guess.\u201d I watch him walk the short distance back to his house. When he goes inside without a backward glance, a pang hits my heart. Not sadness, exactly, but something mighty close. It might have only been sex, and it might have only been Kenny, but at least it was something and he was someone. Now there\u2019s nothing and no one. I place the box and suitcase into the trunk before making one last trip into the house. In the living room, I find my father watching the noon news because that\u2019s what my mother used to do. It\u2019s a habit, and for Pat McDeere, old habits die hard. On the TV is a clip of President Reagan giving a speech about the economy while Just Say No Nancy stands primly beside him. My father, who hates all politicians regardless of party, lets out a derisive snort. \u201cBullshit, Ronnie,\u201d he mutters, his mouth full of sandwich. \u201cTry doing something that\u2019ll help guys like me for once.\u201d Standing in the doorway, I clear my throat. \u201cDad, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d There\u2019s no surprise behind the word. If anything, my father sounds relieved. \u201cI\u2019m back on the job,\u201d I add when he doesn\u2019t press for details. \u201cMy new patient\u2019s a stroke victim. Lives out on the Cliffs.\u201d I say it hoping he\u2019ll be impressed\u2014or, at the very least, intrigued\u2014by the idea of rich people trusting me enough to take care of someone. If he is, he doesn\u2019t show it. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. I know the one sure way to get my father\u2019s full attention is to tell him the name of my new patient. Just like with Kenny, I don\u2019t even consider it. Knowing I\u2019ll be caring for Lenora Hope will only make my father think less of me. If such a thing is possible. \u201cDo you need anything before I go?\u201d I say instead. My father takes another bite of sandwich and shakes his head. The pang I\u2019d felt outside returns with another kick. Harder this time. So hard I swear a chunk of my heart has broken off and is now dropping into the depths of my stomach. \u201cI\u2019ll try to check in every two weeks.\u201d \u201cNo need,\u201d my father says. And that\u2019s all he says. I hover in the doorway a moment\u2014waiting, hoping, silently pleading for more. Anything will do. Goodbye. Good riddance. Fuck off. Anything but this hostile silence that makes me feel like nothing. Worse than nothing. Invisible. That\u2019s how I feel. I leave after that, not bothering to say goodbye. I don\u2019t want to be met with silence when my father refuses to say it back to me. \n THREE Duran Duran blasts from my car stereo as I follow a road that hugs the rocky coastline, climbing higher and higher until the Escort shimmies and the rough waters of the Atlantic become blurs of white crashing against strips of sand far below. In my rearview mirror is an area that is definitely the Cliffs. It practically screams old money, with massive houses clinging to the craggy bluffs like gannet nests, half hidden behind brick walls and swaths of ivy. How the other half lives. That\u2019s how my mother would have described those cliffside dwellings with turrets, widow\u2019s walks, and bay windows facing the sea. I beg to differ. Not even the other half can afford to live at the Cliffs. The area has always been\u2014and always will be\u2014rarefied air. It\u2019s home to the cream of the crop, perched over everyone and everything, as if God himself had placed them there. \u201cYet here you are, Kit-Kat,\u201d my mother would have said. \u201cOn your way to a job in one of these places.\u201d Again, I would disagree. Where I\u2019m heading isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s idea of a prime destination. Hope\u2019s End. Until today, I\u2019d only heard it referred to simply as the Hope house, usually in that hushed tone reserved for tragic things. Now I know why. Hope\u2019s End strikes me as a startlingly apocalyptic name for an estate. Especially considering what happened there. My knowledge doesn\u2019t extend far beyond the rhyme. I know that Winston Hope made a fortune in shipping and built his estate on the rocky coast of northern Maine and not in Bar Harbor or Newport because the land here was mostly undeveloped and he could have his pick of pristine ocean views. I also know that Winston had a wife, Evangeline, and two daughters, Lenora and Virginia. And I know that one long-ago October night, three of them were murdered\u2014with the fourth member of the clan accused of doing the killing. A seventeen-year-old girl, no less. No wonder I thought that morbid rhyme I first learned on the scrubby playground behind the elementary school was made up. It all seemed too Gothic to be real. But it happened. Now it\u2019s town legend. The kind of thing kids whisper about at sleepovers and adults don\u2019t like to whisper about at all. Lenora, the only one left, claimed to have had nothing to do with it. She told investigators that she was asleep during the murders and only knew about them after she woke up, went downstairs, and discovered the rest of her family dead. What she couldn\u2019t tell the police was who else could have done it. Or how. Or why. Nor could Lenora explain why she wasn\u2019t targeted by the killer, which led the police to suspect she was the one who did it, even though no one could prove it. All the servants had conveniently been given the night off, eliminating any possible witnesses. With no evidence physically linking her to the crimes, Lenora was never charged. But one need only look to that schoolyard chant to see what the public thought. The rhyme\u2019s first line\u2014At seventeen, Lenora Hope\u2014fully establishes that she\u2019s to blame for everything. I\u2019m not surprised. There\u2019s no such thing as presumed innocence. I know that from experience. When the town passed judgment on Lenora Hope, she hid away in her family\u2019s house, never to be seen again. But that didn\u2019t stop people from trying. When I was in high school, it was common for groups of boys to dare each other to sneak onto the property and peek into windows, angling for a glimpse of Lenora. As far as I know, none of them ever got one, which earns Miss Hope some grudging respect in my book. I would love to be able to disappear. Up ahead, the land rises even higher, and the road inclines to meet it. The Escort does another shimmy as I spot a brick wall in the sun-streaked distance. It\u2019s tall enough to block out any hint of what\u2019s behind it and old enough that the road curves around it, as if in deference. I follow the curve, driving slowly until I see spray-painted words on the wall. The graffiti, neon blue on stately red brick, tells me I\u2019m in the right place. ROT IN HELL LENORA HOPE I blink at the words, wondering if I should press ahead or drive away as fast as I can. I know the answer. It\u2019s the one I can\u2019t afford. So I continue on, nudging the Escort closer to the ornate gate covering a gap in the vandalized wall. On the other side, the driveway slices across an emerald lawn toward the Hope house itself. Looking at it now, I wonder why anyone ever called it that. This is not a house. It\u2019s a mansion. Something I haven\u2019t seen in person since my parents took me on a day trip to Bar Harbor when I was fourteen. I remember how my father spent the whole day complaining about the rich bastards who\u2019d built the palatial homes there. God knows what he\u2019d say about Hope\u2019s End, which eclipses those stately mansions in that snooty town. It\u2019s bigger. Grander. This wouldn\u2019t be out of place on Dallas or Dynasty or any of those other silly primetime soaps my mother used to watch. Three stories tall and seemingly as wide as a cruise ship, the mansion is a marvel of Gilded Age excess. The walls are redbrick. Around the front double doors and all the windows is marble detailing that serves no purpose except to show how much money the Hope family once had. A ton of it, to judge by the amount of sculpted curves and curlicues on display. The windows of the third floor retain the marble but jut from the pitched roof, which is topped by a dozen narrow chimneys that look like candles atop an ornate birthday cake. At the gate is a small intercom system. I roll down my window and stretch to press it. Thirty seconds pass before it crackles to life in a burst of static, followed by a woman\u2019s voice. \u201cYes.\u201d It\u2019s not a question. In fact, the way she says it is packed with as much impatience as three letters can hold. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Kit McDeere.\u201d I pause to allow the source of the voice to also introduce herself. She doesn\u2019t, prompting me to add, \u201cI\u2019m with Gurlain Home Health Aides. I\u2019m the new care\u2014\u201d The woman interrupts me with a terse \u201cCome up to the house\u201d before the intercom goes silent. In front of the car, the gate starts to open, giving off a nervous shimmy, as if spooked by my presence. It creaks as it slowly swings wider, making me wonder how often Hope\u2019s End welcomes guests. Not a lot, I assume, when the gate rattles to a stop even though it\u2019s only halfway open. I inch the car forward, trying to gauge if there\u2019s enough room to pass by. There isn\u2019t. Not if I want to keep both of my side mirrors, which I very much do. My budget, such as it is, doesn\u2019t include car repairs. I\u2019m about to get out of the car and push on the gate myself when a man\u2019s voice calls out in the distance. \u201cIs it stuck again?\u201d The source of the voice comes closer, pushing a wheelbarrow heaped with fallen leaves. He\u2019s handsome, I notice. Mid-thirties. In very good shape, as far as I can tell, under his flannel shirt and dirt-streaked jeans. He has a full beard and hair grown a little too long so that it curls slightly at the back of his neck. I\u2019d be interested under different circumstances. Completely different. Living-another-existence different. Just like car repairs, my life doesn\u2019t have room for romantic entanglements. And no, Kenny doesn\u2019t count. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the other time,\u201d I say through the open window, \u201cbut it\u2019s certainly stuck now.\u201d \u201cYou should have said times,\u201d the man replies, flashing a smile that\u2019s endearingly crooked. \u201cThis is, like, the tenth. I keep forgetting to add it to the list of the hundred other things I need to do around here. Are you the new nurse?\u201d \u201cCaregiver,\u201d I say. A necessary correction. Nurses go to school. Caregivers like me get specialized training\u2014a state-mandated 180 hours in Maine\u2014teaching us the basics. Checking vitals, dispensing medication, light physical therapy. But explaining all of that to a stranger takes more time than it\u2019s worth. \u201cThen let\u2019s get this gate open so you can start.\u201d The man pulls a pair of work gloves from the back pocket of his jeans. Making a show of putting them on, he says, \u201cSafety first. I\u2019ve learned the hard way\u2014this place can bite.\u201d He yanks on the gate, and it lets out a squeak so awful I would have described it as pained if it had come from someone in my care. \u201cDo you work here full-time?\u201d I ask, raising my voice to be heard over the sound of the gate. \u201cI do,\u201d the man says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many of us here anymore, although once upon a time this place was overflowing with hired help. For instance, there used to be a gardener, a groundskeeper, and a handyman, along with a bunch of part-time helpers. Now I\u2019m all of them rolled into one.\u201d \u201cDo you like it here?\u201d The man gives the gate one last shove, clearing it from the driveway. Turning to me, he says, \u201cAm I scared, is what you mean.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s what I mean. I\u2019d intended it to be an innocent question. A natural one, considering what happened here. Yet in hindsight I realize how it also could be perceived as incredibly rude. \u201cI just\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d the man says. \u201cYou\u2019re only being curious. I know what people beyond these walls say about this place.\u201d \u201cI guess that means no.\u201d \u201cA correct assumption.\u201d The man removes one of his gloves and extends his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Carter, by the way.\u201d I shake his hand. \u201cKit McDeere.\u201d \u201cNice to meet you, Kit. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d I pause before driving away. \u201cThanks for helping me with the gate. I\u2019m not sure what I would have done if you hadn\u2019t come by.\u201d \u201cI think you would have managed somehow.\u201d Carter studies me, his head tilted in curious appraisal. \u201cYou strike me as being pretty resourceful.\u201d I used to be. Not anymore. Resourceful people aren\u2019t suspended from their jobs, can find new ones if they are, and don\u2019t still live at home at age thirty-one. Still, I accept the compliment with a nod. \u201cOne more thing,\u201d Carter says, coming to the open car window and bending down so we\u2019re eye-to-eye. \u201cForget what everyone says about Lenora Hope and what happened here. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Miss Hope is completely harmless.\u201d Even though he intended them to be reassuring, Carter\u2019s words only underscore the surreal truth of the situation. Yes, I knew what the job entailed when I left Mr. Gurlain\u2019s office. But it was an abstract notion, pushed to the background by packing, dealing with my father\u2019s ambivalence, trying to find this place. But now that I\u2019m here, it hits me like a sucker punch. I\u2019m about to meet a woman who slaughtered her family. Allegedly slaughtered, I remind myself. Lenora was never convicted of any crime, as Mr. Gurlain so coyly reminded me. But who else could have done it other than Lenora? There was no one else at the house, no other suspects to consider, no one else left alive. The rhyme\u2019s final line clings to my thoughts. But she\u2019s the only one not dead A shudder runs up my spine as I pull away from Carter and head toward the main house. I drive slowly, my gaze fixed on the jaw-dropping structure looming up ahead. But as I get closer, the luxurious grandeur of the place fades like fog, revealing the neglect hiding in plain sight. Up close, I realize, Hope\u2019s End is a mess. One of the second-floor windows is missing panes and now has plywood covering the gaping hole. Chunks of marble have broken off the detailing around some of the doors and windows. The roof is missing a fifth of its slate shingles, giving it a battered, pockmarked look that\u2019s honestly a relief. At last, a place as broken as I feel. The driveway ends in a roundabout in front of the house, with another spoke leading to a low-slung garage several yards from the main building. Turning through the roundabout, I count the garage doors. Five. How the other half lives indeed. At the front of the house, I park, get out of the car, and hop up three steps to a massive set of double doors placed in the dead center of the mansion. Before I can even knock, the doors fly open, revealing a woman standing just inside. Her sudden presence startles me. Or maybe it\u2019s simply her monochrome appearance that\u2019s startling. White hair that brushes her shoulders. Black dress fitted tightly around a svelte frame. Lace collar that resembles the doilies my grandmother used to crochet. Pale skin. Blue eyes. Lipstick a bold cherry red. It\u2019s all so dramatic and severe that I can\u2019t quite pinpoint the woman\u2019s age. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say seventy-five, knowing I could be off by at least ten years in either direction. A pair of cat\u2019s-eye glasses hangs from a chain around the woman\u2019s neck. She brings them to her eyes and peers at me for a breath of a second\u2014an instant appraisal. \u201cMiss McDeere,\u201d she finally says. \u201cWelcome.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d I say, even though there\u2019s literally nothing welcoming about the woman\u2019s tone. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s the same person I talked to over the intercom. The disinterested voice is unmistakable. \u201cI\u2019m Mrs. Baker, the housekeeper.\u201d The woman pauses to take in what I\u2019m wearing, seemingly finding my coat lacking. It\u2019s blue wool and pilled in too many places to count. I\u2019ve had it for so long I can\u2019t remember when or where I bought it. Or maybe Mrs. Baker\u2019s apparent distaste is reserved for what\u2019s under the coat. White blouse. Gray skirt. Black flats last worn at my mother\u2019s funeral. If so, I can\u2019t help it. These are the nicest clothes I own. After a moment of clear hesitation, Mrs. Baker adds, \u201cDo come in.\u201d I hesitate as well, hovering just outside. It\u2019s the doorway that gives me pause. Almost as wide as it is tall and surrounded by more of that ubiquitous marble detailing, it sort of resembles an open mouth. Looking at it reminds me of something Carter said. This place can bite. I suddenly long for home. A complete surprise, considering how that house hasn\u2019t felt like home since my mother died. But it had once been a happy place, full of equally happy memories. Snowy Christmases and birthday cakes and my mother in her silly floral apron making French toast on Sunday mornings. Does Hope\u2019s End have any happy memories? Or did they all vanish that one horrible night? Is sorrow the only thing that remains? \u201cComing, dear?\u201d Mrs. Baker says after an impatient clearing of her throat. Part of me doesn\u2019t want to. The entire place\u2014its size, its ostentatiousness, and especially its reputation\u2014makes me want to turn around and head right back home. But then I think about my father, my bedroom, the dregs of cash in my savings account. None of that will change if I don\u2019t do something about it. If I leave\u2014which I desperately want to do\u2014I\u2019ll be stuck in the same limbo I\u2019ve inhabited for the past six months. But working here, even for just a few weeks, could change everything. With that in mind, I take a deep breath, pass through the door, and allow Hope\u2019s End to swallow me whole. \n FOUR The inside of Hope\u2019s End is nicer than the outside, but only slightly. Just beyond the door is a grand foyer with marble tile, velvet drapes at the windows, and tapestries on the walls. The furnishings range from potted palms to fancy wooden chairs with dusty cushions under brocade pillows. Overhead, an oil-painted sky full of puffy-pink clouds adorns the arched ceiling. It all looks simultaneously fancy and shabby and stopped in time. Like the lobby of a four-star hotel that had been suddenly abandoned decades ago. To the left, a long hallway runs past tall windows and a single open doorway, on its way to a set of wide double doors that are currently closed. It then takes a sharp right, disappearing around a corner. On the right is another hallway, offering a straight shot to a sun-drenched room. My attention, though, is mostly focused on what\u2019s in front of me. A red-carpeted staircase directly across from the front door that rises a dozen steps before splitting in two like a pair of wings. Each symmetrical half then curves upward to the second floor. A stained-glass window looms over the center landing, through which slant streaks of sunlight in rainbowed hues that color the carpet. \u201cThe Grand Stairs,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cBuilt with the house in 1913. Very little about the place has changed since then. Mr. Hope made sure to choose a design that was timeless.\u201d She keeps moving, her heels clicking like a metronome on the marble tile. I trail after her, tripped up slightly by the floor. It\u2019s uneven in spots, swelling and ebbing like the ocean outside. \u201cYou can collect your belongings later,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cI thought it would be nice to chat in the sunroom first. It\u2019s a cheerful little room.\u201d I\u2019ll believe it when I see it. So far, nothing about Hope\u2019s End suggests cheerfulness, even the few pretty bits. Gloom and doom seem to have taken up residence in the corners, gathered there like cobwebs. There\u2019s also a chill to the air\u2014a salt-tinged, intangible something that makes me shiver. I know it\u2019s just my imagination. Three people died here. Horrifically, if legend is to be believed. Knowledge like that can mess with your brain. As if to illustrate that point, we pass a framed oil painting that depicts a teenage girl in a pink satin gown. \u201cMiss Hope,\u201d Mrs. Baker says, not bothering to glance at the portrait as she trots by. \u201cCommissioned by her father to mark her birthday.\u201d Unlike Mrs. Baker, I\u2019m stopped cold by the portrait. In it, Lenora is seated on a white divan, with pink-striped wallpaper behind her and, just over her shoulder, a sliver of mirror in a gilt frame. Lenora leans somewhat awkwardly against the armrest of the divan. Her hands rest on her lap, fingers intertwined, suggesting a tension the painter tried hard to disguise with a too-casual pose. Her pale skin and delicate features make me think of a flower just before it blooms. Young Lenora had a pert nose, ripe lips, and green eyes almost as bright as the stained glass over the Grand Stairs. She stares directly at the painter, a spark of mischief in her gaze, almost as if she knows what people will be saying about her decades in the future. Mrs. Baker, five paces ahead of me, turns to give me an impatient look. \u201cThe sunroom is this way, Miss McDeere.\u201d I move on, although not before taking one last look at Lenora\u2019s portrait. Three others, identical in shape and size, hang in a row next to it, all hidden behind black silk crepe. Rather than draped over the paintings, the fabric is stretched taut and held in place by nails driven directly into the frames. All that effort, though, doesn\u2019t entirely hide the portraits. I can faintly see them behind the sheer crepe, hazy and featureless. Like ghosts. Winston, Evangeline, and Virginia Hope. And Lenora\u2019s the only one still on display because she\u2019s the only one left. I catch up to Mrs. Baker, following her quickly down the rest of the hall, passing rooms with their doors firmly shut, suggesting places that are forbidden. At each one, I feel another brief chill. Drafts, I tell myself. Happens all the time in big, old mansions like this. The sunroom is at least brighter than the rest of the house, if not exactly cheerful. The furniture is the same kind of musty antiques spotted elsewhere around Hope\u2019s End. So much velvet and embroidery and tassels. A grand piano anchors the far end of the room, its lid lowered and shut tighter than a casket. The room\u2019s stuffiness is leavened by the rows of floor-to-ceiling windows along two walls. One row of windows faces the lawn, through which I can see Carter in the distance, back to raking leaves. The other set of windows looks out onto an empty terrace. A short marble railing, not even waist high, runs the length of the terrace. I can\u2019t see anything past the railing because there\u2019s literally nothing else to see. Just an endless expanse of cerulean sky that makes it seem like the mansion is literally floating in midair. Mrs. Baker grants me a few more seconds of gawking before gesturing to a red velvet love seat. \u201cPlease, sit.\u201d I lower myself onto the edge of the love seat, as if I\u2019m afraid of breaking it. Which I am. Everything at Hope\u2019s End seems so old and so expensive that I assume nothing here can be replaced. Mrs. Baker shows no such hesitation as she drops onto the love seat across from me. The motion produces a small plume of dust that rises from the fabric in a miniature mushroom cloud. \u201cNow, Miss McDeere,\u201d she says, \u201ctell me a little about yourself.\u201d Before I can speak, someone else bursts into the room with a clomp and a rattle. A young woman carrying a metal pail in one hand and using the other to drag a vacuum cleaner behind her. She freezes when she sees us, giving me a few seconds to take in the sheer spectacle of her appearance. About twenty, if that, she wears a formal maid\u2019s uniform that wouldn\u2019t have been out of place in a black-and-white movie. Black, knee-length dress. Starched white collar with pinpoint tips. White apron bearing a smeared print where she presumably wiped her hands. The rest of her, though, is pure Technicolor. Her hair, dyed a garish shade of red, also contains two streaks of neon blue that trail down both sides of her face, dangling like octopus tentacles. A similar shade of blue streaks across her eyelids before fading at her temples. Her lipstick is bubblegum pink. Rouge colored a darker shade of pink cuts over her cheekbones. \u201cOops, sorry!\u201d she says, doing a double take when she sees me, clearly surprised by the presence of a stranger at Hope\u2019s End. I suspect it doesn\u2019t happen often. \u201cI thought the room was empty.\u201d She turns to leave, producing another rattle that I realize is coming from the half-dozen plastic bracelets in rainbow hues that ride up each of her wrists. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault, Jessica,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cI should have informed you I\u2019d be needing the room this afternoon. This is Miss McDeere, Miss Hope\u2019s new caregiver.\u201d \u201cHi,\u201d I say with a little wave. The girl waves back, her bracelets clattering. \u201cHey. Welcome aboard.\u201d \u201cThe two of us were about to get better acquainted,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cPerhaps you can continue cleaning in the foyer. It\u2019s looking a little neglected.\u201d \u201cBut I cleaned there yesterday.\u201d \u201cAre you suggesting my eyes have deceived me?\u201d Mrs. Baker says, displaying a smile so clenched it borders on the vicious. The girl shakes her head, setting her hoop earrings in motion. \u201cNo, Mrs. Baker.\u201d The young maid curtsies, an act of sarcasm Mrs. Baker seems to mistake for sincerity. Then she leaves, giving me another curious glance before hauling her pail, vacuum, and rattling jewelry out of the sunroom. \u201cPlease forgive Jessica,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to find good help these days.\u201d \u201cOh\u201d is all I can say in return. Aren\u2019t I also considered the help? Isn\u2019t Mrs. Baker? She puts on her glasses, adjusting them atop the bridge of her nose before peering at me through the thick lenses. \u201cNow, Miss McDeere\u2014\u201d \u201cYou can call me Kit.\u201d \u201cKit,\u201d Mrs. Baker says, flinging my name off her tongue like it\u2019s a bad taste. \u201cI assume that\u2019s short for something.\u201d \u201cYes. Kittredge.\u201d \u201cA bit fancy for a first name.\u201d I understand her meaning. Fancy for someone like me. \u201cIt was my maternal grandmother\u2019s maiden name.\u201d Mrs. Baker makes a noise. Not quite a hmmm, but close. \u201cAnd your people? Where are they from?\u201d \u201cHere,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to be more specific than that.\u201d Again, I understand. There\u2019s more than one here. There are the mansions clinging to the Cliffs, home to the moneyed ranks the Hope family used to tower over. Then there\u2019s everyone else. \u201cTown,\u201d I say. Mrs. Baker nods. \u201cI thought so.\u201d \u201cMy father is a handyman, and my mother was a librarian,\u201d I volunteer, trying to impress upon Mrs. Baker that my family is just as worthy of respect as the Hopes and their ilk. \u201cInteresting,\u201d Mrs. Baker says, in a way that makes it clear she finds it anything but. \u201cDo you have much experience as a caregiver?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d I tense, unsure how much she already knows. \u201cWhat did Mr. Gurlain tell you?\u201d \u201cVery little. I wish I could say you came highly recommended, but that would be a lie. I was told next to nothing about you.\u201d I take a deep breath. This could be a good thing. Then again, maybe not. Because it means I\u2019ll have to explain everything myself if asked. Please don\u2019t ask, I think. \u201cI\u2019ve been with Gurlain Home Health Aides for twelve years,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a long time.\u201d Mrs. Baker holds my gaze, her face unreadable. \u201cI assume you learned a lot in those twelve years.\u201d \u201cI did, yes.\u201d I start listing all the things I know how to do, ranging from the pedestrian\u2014light cooking, light cleaning, changing sheets with a person still in the bed\u2014to the professional. Giving sponge baths and inserting catheters, drawing blood and injecting insulin, checking shoulder blades and buttocks for bedsores. \u201cWhy, you\u2019re practically a nurse,\u201d Mrs. Baker interrupts when I\u2019ve droned on too long. \u201cDo you have much experience caring for stroke victims?\u201d \u201cSome,\u201d I say, thinking of Mrs. Plankers and how I cared for her less than two months before her poor husband ran out of money to pay for the agency\u2019s services. Mrs. Plankers was moved to a state-funded nursing home, and I was assigned to another patient. \u201cMiss Hope\u2019s condition might require more attention than you\u2019re accustomed to,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cShe\u2019s been plagued by bad health most of her life. A bout of polio in her twenties weakened her legs so much that she\u2019s been unable to walk since. Over the past twenty years, she\u2019s suffered a series of strokes. They left her unable to speak and the right side of her body paralyzed. She can move her head and neck, but it\u2019s sometimes difficult for her to control them. All she has, really, is limited use of her left arm.\u201d I flex my own left arm, unable to imagine only having control of that single, small part of my body. At least now I know why Lenora never left Hope\u2019s End. She couldn\u2019t. \u201cIs that why the previous nurse left?\u201d \u201cMary?\u201d Mrs. Baker says, seemingly flustered. The first genuine emotion I\u2019ve seen from her. \u201cNo, she was quite good at her job. She\u2019d been with us for more than a year. Miss Hope adored her.\u201d \u201cThen why did she leave so suddenly?\u201d \u201cI wish I knew. She didn\u2019t tell anyone why she was leaving, where she was going, or even that she was leaving at all. She simply left. In the middle of the night, no less. Poor Miss Hope was left unattended all night, during which time something terrible could have occurred. As you well know, considering what happened to the last person in your care.\u201d My breath hitches in my chest. She knows. Of course she does. Squirming beneath Mrs. Baker\u2019s withering gaze, all I\u2019m able to say is, \u201cI can explain.\u201d \u201cPlease do.\u201d I break eye contact, ashamed. I feel exposed. So completely naked that I start to smooth my skirt over my legs, trying to cover as much of myself as the fabric will allow. \u201cI had a\u2014\u201d My voice breaks, even though I\u2019ve told this story a dozen times to just as many skeptical people. Cops. State workers. Mr. Gurlain. \u201cI had a patient. She was sick. Stomach cancer. By the time she found out, it was far too late. It had spread . . . everywhere. Surgery wasn\u2019t possible. Chemo only went so far. There was nothing to do but keep her comfortable and wait until the end arrived. But the pain, well, it was excruciating.\u201d I continue staring at my lap, at my hands, at the way they keep smoothing over my skirt. My words, though, aren\u2019t as cautious. They get faster, freer\u2014something that never happened in that gray box of an interrogation room at the police station. I chalk it up to being inside Hope\u2019s End. This place is familiar with death. \u201cHer doctor gave her a prescription for fentanyl,\u201d I say. \u201cTo be taken only sporadically and only when necessary. One night, it was necessary. I\u2019d never seen someone hurt so much. That kind of pain? It\u2019s not fleeting. It lingers. It consumes. And when I looked into her eyes, I saw sheer agony. So I gave her a single dose of fentanyl and monitored the pain. It seemed to help, so I went to bed.\u201d I pause, just like every time I reach this point in the story. I always need a moment before diving into the details of my failure. \u201cI woke up earlier than normal the next morning,\u201d I say, remembering the dark gray sky outside my window, still streaked with remnants of night. The gloom had felt like a bad omen. One look at it and I knew something was wrong. \u201cI went to check on the patient and found her to be nonresponsive. Immediately, I called 911, which is standard protocol.\u201d I leave out the part about already knowing it was a waste of time. I recognize death when I see it. \u201cI was waiting for the EMTs when I saw the bottle of fentanyl. It was company policy to keep all medications in a locked box beneath our beds. That way only the caregiver has access to them. Maybe I had been tired. Or shaken by how much pain she was in. Whatever the reason, I\u2019d forgotten to take the bottle with me.\u201d I squeeze my eyes shut, trying not to picture the bottle lying on its side against the bedside lamp. I do anyway. I see it all. The bottle. The cap sitting a few inches away. The lone pill that remained. A small circle colored a light shade of blue that I always thought was too pretty for something so dangerous. \u201cDuring the night, she had swallowed all but one of them,\u201d I say. \u201cShe died while I was sleeping. She was pronounced dead at the scene and taken away. The coroner later said she died of cardiac arrest brought on by an overdose of fentanyl.\u201d \u201cDo you think it was intentional?\u201d Mrs. Baker says. I open my eyes and see that her expression has softened a bit. Not enough to be mistaken for sympathy. That\u2019s not Mrs. Baker\u2019s style. Instead, what I see in the old woman\u2019s eyes is something more complex: understanding. \u201cYes. I think she knew exactly what she was doing.\u201d \u201cYet people blamed you.\u201d \u201cThey did,\u201d I say. \u201cLeaving the bottle within reach was negligent. I won\u2019t disagree about that. I never have. But everyone thought the worst. I was suspended without pay. There was an official investigation. The police were involved. There was enough fuss that it made the local paper.\u201d I pause and picture my father with the newspaper, his eyes big and watery. What they\u2019re saying\u2019s not true, Kit-Kat. \u201cI was never charged with any crime,\u201d I continue. \u201cIt was ruled an accident, my suspension eventually ended, and now I\u2019m back on the job. But I know most people think the worst. They suspect I left those pills out on purpose. Or that I even helped her take them.\u201d \u201cDid you?\u201d I stare at Mrs. Baker, both startled and offended. \u201cWhat kind of question is that?\u201d \u201cAn honest one,\u201d she says. \u201cWhich deserves an honest answer, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Mrs. Baker sits calmly, the epitome of patience. Her posture, I notice, is perfect. Her plank-straight spine doesn\u2019t come close to touching the back of the dusty love seat. I\u2019m the opposite\u2014slumped in mine, arms crossed, pinned under the weight of her question. \u201cWould you believe me if I said no?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cMost people don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cThose of us at Hope\u2019s End aren\u2019t like most people.\u201d Mrs. Baker turns toward the row of windows and the terrace railing just beyond them. Beyond that is . . . nothing. A chasm made up of sky above and, presumably, water below. \u201cHere, we give young women accused of terrible deeds the benefit of the doubt.\u201d I sit up, surprised. From Mrs. Baker\u2019s no-nonsense demeanor, I\u2019d assumed it was forbidden to talk about the tragic past of Hope\u2019s End. \u201cLet\u2019s not pretend you don\u2019t know what happened here, dear,\u201d she says. \u201cYou do. Just like you know that everyone thinks Miss Hope is the person responsible.\u201d \u201cIs she?\u201d This time, I surprise even myself. Normally, I\u2019m not so bold. Once again, I suspect the house is to blame. It invites bold questions. Mrs. Baker smirks, maybe pleased, maybe not. \u201cWould you believe me if I said no?\u201d I look around the room, taking in the fussy furniture, the rows of windows, the lawn and the terrace and the endless sky. \u201cSince I\u2019m here, I\u2019ll need to give her the benefit of the doubt.\u201d It\u2019s apparently the right answer. Or, at the very least, an acceptable one. For Mrs. Baker stands and says, \u201cI\u2019ll show you the rest of the house now. After that, I\u2019ll introduce you to Miss Hope.\u201d That makes it official. I\u2019m Lenora Hope\u2019s new caregiver. It doesn\u2019t matter that I lied to Mrs. Baker. Not just about my previous patient. But about Lenora Hope, my opinion of whom hasn\u2019t changed. I still think she\u2019s a killer. I also know it doesn\u2019t matter what I think. She\u2019s my patient. My job is to take care of her. If I don\u2019t do my job, I won\u2019t get paid. It\u2019s that simple. We leave the sunroom and head back down the hallway, toward the heart of the house. When we reach the portraits, I sneak another glance at the only one on display. Lenora\u2019s oil-painted eyes seem to follow us as we pass. \n FIVE Budgetary restrictions force us to keep only a small household staff,\u201d Mrs. Baker says as we return to the foyer. \u201cOutside work is done by Carter, whom I believe you\u2019ve already met.\u201d I stiffen, slightly unnerved. How did she know that? \u201cI have, yes,\u201d I say. Mrs. Baker guides me past the Grand Stairs and into the hall leading to the other end of the house. \u201cInside the house is Jessica, who cleans, and Archibald, who cooks.\u201d \u201cAnd what do you do?\u201d Another bold question. Accidentally so. This time, there\u2019s no mistaking Mrs. Baker\u2019s reaction. Definitely displeased. \u201cI am the housekeeper,\u201d she says with a sniff so disgruntled it lifts her bosom. \u201cI keep the house in the best condition possible under severely limited circumstances. All decisions are made by me. All decisions I make are final. With Miss Hope unable to serve as caretaker of this estate, I have assumed the burden. That is my job.\u201d \u201cHow long have you been with Miss Hope?\u201d \u201cDecades. I arrived in 1928, hired to tutor Miss Hope and her sister in the ways a young woman should behave. Only nineteen myself, I\u2019d intended to stay a year or two. That plan changed, of course. When the household staff was reduced following the . . . incident, I left and went to Europe for a time. When my fianc\u00e9 died, I chose to return to Hope\u2019s End and devote my life to Miss Hope\u2019s care.\u201d Not the choice I would have made. Then again, I\u2019ve never had a fianc\u00e9. Or even a boyfriend for any significant length of time. The job doesn\u2019t allow it. \u201cGet out while you\u2019ve still got your looks,\u201d a fellow Gurlain Home Health Aide once told me. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019ll never snag a man.\u201d Now I wonder if it\u2019s already too late. Maybe I\u2019m already fated to become like Mrs. Baker\u2014a woman in black with white hair and pale skin, drained of all color. \u201cIf you never got married, why are you called Mrs. Baker?\u201d \u201cBecause that\u2019s the title given to the head housekeeper, dear, whether she\u2019s married or not. It commands respect.\u201d Continuing down the hallway, I survey my surroundings. Double doors closed tight straight ahead, open doorway to my right. I peek through it to see a formal dining room, unlit but brightened by two sets of French doors that lead to the terrace. Between them is an ornate fireplace so big I could park my car inside it. A pair of chandeliers hang over each end of a table long enough to seat two dozen people. \u201cHope\u2019s End has thirty-six rooms,\u201d Mrs. Baker says as we reach the closed double doors at the end of the corridor. \u201cYou need only concern yourself with three. Miss Hope\u2019s quarters, your own quarters, and here.\u201d I follow Mrs. Baker as she cuts right, around the corner and into a kitchen large enough for a restaurant. There are multiple ovens and burners and a brick-lined fireplace, inside of which a small blaze crackles. Shelves full of porcelain containers line the walls, and dozens of copper pots hang from the ceiling on wrought iron racks. A massive wooden counter sits in the center of the room, running from almost one wall to another. Decades ago, an army of cooks and servers likely scurried over the black-and-white-tiled floor on their way to the adjoining dining room. Now there\u2019s only one\u2014a man with a thick chest and even thicker stomach wearing checkered pants and a white chef\u2019s coat. In his seventies, he has a shaved head and a slightly bent nose, but his smile is wide. \u201cArchibald, this is Miss Hope\u2019s new caregiver,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cKit, this is Archibald.\u201d He looks up from the counter, where he\u2019s kneading dough for homemade bread. \u201cWelcome, Kit. And call me Archie.\u201d \u201cAll of Miss Hope\u2019s meals are prepared by Archibald, so you won\u2019t be needed in that capacity,\u201d Mrs. Baker tells me. \u201cHe also cooks for the rest of the staff. You\u2019re free to prepare your own meals, of course, but I\u2019d advise against it. Archibald is the best cook on the Maine coast.\u201d It dawns on me how quickly my life has changed. This morning, I woke up in the same bed I\u2019ve had since I was ten. Tonight, I\u2019ll be falling asleep in a mansion that has a professional cook. And a maid. And a terrace with a bird\u2019s-eye view of the sea. As if to silently bring me back to earth, Mrs. Baker moves on, guiding me to a set of steps tucked into a corner of the kitchen. The opposite of the Grand Stairs, these are steep, narrow, and dark. Clearly meant for servants. Of which I am one. I can\u2019t forget about that. \u201cArchibald and Jessica have rooms on the third floor,\u201d Mrs. Baker says, her voice echoing down the narrow stairwell as she climbs. \u201cYour quarters are on the second floor, next to Miss Hope\u2019s room.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s upstairs?\u201d I say, surprised. \u201cIf she\u2019s immobile, shouldn\u2019t she be on the ground floor for easier access?\u201d \u201cMiss Hope doesn\u2019t mind, I assure you.\u201d \u201cThe house has an elevator?\u201d \u201cOf course not.\u201d \u201cThen how do I take her outside?\u201d Mrs. Baker comes to a dead stop halfway up the stairs. So quickly that I almost bump into her. To avoid a collision, I drop down a step, which allows Mrs. Baker to tower over me as she says, \u201cMiss Hope doesn\u2019t go outside.\u201d \u201cEver?\u201d \u201cEver.\u201d Mrs. Baker\u2019s on the move again, quickly climbing the rest of the rickety staircase. \u201cMiss Hope hasn\u2019t been outside of this house in decades.\u201d \u201cWhat if she needs to see a doctor?\u201d \u201cThen the doctor comes to her,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cBut what if she needs to be taken to the hospital?\u201d \u201cThat will never happen.\u201d \u201cBut what if\u2014\u201d There\u2019s an emergency. That\u2019s what I try to say. I can\u2019t get the words out because Mrs. Baker stops once more, this time at the landing. \u201cMiss Hope was born in this house, and this is where she will die,\u201d she says. \u201cUntil then, she is to always remain indoors. Those are her wishes, and my job is to enact them. If you take issue with that, then you may leave right now. Am I understood?\u201d I lower my eyes, fully aware that after less than five minutes on the job I\u2019m this close to being fired. The only thing keeping me from being forced to return to my old bedroom and my father\u2019s silence is what I say next. \u201cYes,\u201d I reply. \u201cI apologize for questioning Miss Hope\u2019s wishes.\u201d \u201cGood.\u201d Mrs. Baker gives me a red-lipped smile that\u2019s as brief and cutting as a razor slash. \u201cLet\u2019s continue.\u201d We start off down a long corridor. Like the downstairs hallways, it runs from one side of the mansion to the other, with the top of the Grand Stairs positioned in the middle. Unlike those wider, better-lit corridors, this one is as narrow as a tunnel and just as dim. The carpet is red. The wallpaper is peacock blue damask. A dozen doors line each side, all of them shut. Moving through the corridor, I feel a strange sensation. Not dizziness. Nothing as strong as that. Instability. That\u2019s what I feel. Like I\u2019ve just had a few very strong drinks. I touch the wall for support, my palm skimming across the blue wallpaper. It\u2019s overwhelming. The color is too dark and the print too florid for such a confined space. All those ornate petals bursting open and intertwining give the impression of a garden that\u2019s grown wild and vicious and is now overtaking the house. My hand recoils from the wall at the thought, which sends me listing ever so slightly in the other direction. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is the house,\u201d Mrs. Baker says without looking back. \u201cIt tilts slightly toward the ocean. It\u2019s not very noticeable on the first floor. You can only feel it on the upper levels.\u201d \u201cWhy is it tilted?\u201d \u201cThe cliff, dear. The ground here at the top has shifted over time as the cliff has eroded.\u201d What Mrs. Baker doesn\u2019t say, but what\u2019s abundantly clear from the slanted floor, is that Hope\u2019s End has been eroding with it. Someday\u2014maybe soon, maybe a century from now\u2014both cliff and mansion will break apart and slide into the ocean. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that worry you?\u201d \u201cOh, we\u2019ve all become quite accustomed to it,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cIt just takes some time. Like getting your sea legs.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t know. My sailing experience is limited to a whale-watching field trip I took in the sixth grade. But I can\u2019t imagine ever getting used to this. When Mrs. Baker stops at one of the tightly closed doors on the left, I lean against the wall, relieved. \u201cThese are your quarters,\u201d she says, turning the knob but not opening the door. It does that on its own, creaking ajar thanks to the mansion\u2019s pernicious tilt. \u201cAfter you\u2019re done changing, I\u2019ll introduce you to Miss Hope.\u201d \u201cChange?\u201d I push off the wall into a standing position. \u201cInto what?\u201d \u201cYour uniform, of course.\u201d Mrs. Baker steps away from the door, allowing me to peek inside. The room is small but tidy. Butter yellow walls, a dresser, a reading chair, a large bookshelf blessedly filled with books. There\u2019s even a view of the ocean, which under different circumstances would make my heart sing. But I\u2019m too focused on the bed and the white nurse\u2019s uniform sitting on top of it, folded as neatly as a napkin in a fancy restaurant. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t fit properly, I can find a seamstress who\u2019ll be able to do some alterations,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. I eye the uniform like it\u2019s a ticking time bomb. \u201cYou seriously want me to wear this?\u201d \u201cNo, dear,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cI require that you wear it.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m not a nurse.\u201d \u201cYou are here.\u201d I should have known this was coming. I\u2019d seen Jessica in her ridiculous maid\u2019s outfit and Archie in his chef\u2019s gear. \u201cI know you think it\u2019s silly,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cThe nurses before you did as well. Even Mary. But we abide by the old ways here. And those ways involve a strict dress code. Besides, it\u2019s what Miss Hope is accustomed to. To deviate now would likely confuse and upset her.\u201d It\u2019s that last bit that makes me concede defeat. While I don\u2019t give a damn about abiding by the old ways\u2014why follow them if no one is ever here to notice?\u2014I can\u2019t argue with not wanting to upset a patient. I have no choice but to suck it up and wear the uniform. Mrs. Baker waits in the hall as I close the door and strip out of my coat, skirt, and blouse. On goes the uniform, which doesn\u2019t quite fit. It\u2019s loose at the hips, just right at the bust, and tight at the shoulders, making it simultaneously too snug and not snug enough. By the time the winged cap is pinned to my head, I feel positively ridiculous. In the adjoining bathroom, I check to see how I look. It\u2019s . . . not bad, actually. While undeniably formal, the tightness in the uniform\u2019s shoulders makes me stand a little taller. Forced out of my perpetual slump, I appear less like a caregiver and more like a legitimate nurse. For the first time in months, I feel resourceful again. A refreshing change of pace. Mrs. Baker certainly approves. When I emerge from the bedroom, she lifts her glasses to her eyes and says, \u201cYes, that\u2019s much better.\u201d Then she\u2019s off again, to the next door down the hallway. Lenora Hope\u2019s room. I suck in a breath when Mrs. Baker opens the door, feeling the need to brace myself. For what, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not as if Lenora Hope will be standing just inside, a knife in one hand and a noose in the other. Yet that\u2019s the only thing I can picture as Mrs. Baker gestures for me to step inside. After another deep breath, I do. The first thing I notice about the room is the wallpaper. Pink stripes. Exactly like in the portrait downstairs. The white divan is there as well, its fabric darkened by time but clearly the same one Lenora posed on. On the wall behind it is the gilt-edged mirror glimpsed in the portrait. Staring at the entire mirror\u2014and my uniformed reflection in it\u2014makes me feel a bit like Alice going through the looking glass. Instead of Wonderland, though, I\u2019ve ended up inside the portrait of Lenora Hope and now stare at myself from outside the frame. The next thing to catch my eye are the tall windows that face the Atlantic. The view beyond them is even more stunning than the one in the sunroom. The ocean is visible from here\u2014a vast canvas of churning water that looks like a fun house\u2013mirror version of the sky. Two blues, one scudded with clouds, the other whitecaps. The second floor\u2019s higher vantage point gives me a better idea of how close the house is to the cliff\u2019s edge. Right against it, in fact. There\u2019s no land beyond the terrace railing. Just a straight drop directly into the sea. Because of the slight tilt of the house, the view seems extra vertiginous. Even though I\u2019m in the middle of the room, I feel like I have my forehead pressed against one of the windows, looking down. Another twinge of instability hits me, and I spend a fraught moment worrying I\u2019m about to tip right over. But then I finally notice the wheelchair parked in a corner of the room, facing the windows. It\u2019s old-fashioned, constructed of wicker and wood, with two large wheels in front and a small one in the back, like a tricycle. The kind of wheelchair that hasn\u2019t been used in decades. In it is a woman, silent and still, her head lolled forward, as if she\u2019s asleep. Lenora Hope. My vertigo fades in an instant. I\u2019m too spellbound by Lenora\u2019s presence to notice the tilted floor anymore. Or the view out the windows. Or even the presence of Mrs. Baker behind me. All I can focus on is Lenora, seated in that old-timey wheelchair, bathed in sunlight so bright it makes her look pale, almost translucent. The infamous Lenora Hope, reduced to a ghost. Everything about her, really, seems sapped of color. Her robe is threadbare and gray, as are the slippers on her feet. Gray socks run to just below her knees, where they bunch and sag. The nightgown under the robe was likely white once upon a time, but too many washings have left it the same ashen shade as her skin. The grayness extends to her hair, which is kept long and straight and cascades down her shoulders. It isn\u2019t until Lenora lifts her head that I see a single bit of color. Her eyes. Their green is almost as bright as her eyes in the portrait downstairs. But what\u2019s fascinating in the painting is downright startling in person, especially when surrounded by all that gray. They remind me of lasers. They burn. That blazing green draws me in. I find myself wanting to stare into those startlingly bright eyes and see if I can recognize a piece of myself in them. If I can\u2019t, then perhaps it means I\u2019m not as bad as people think. Even my father. I take a wobbling step toward Lenora and the tilt returns, more pronounced this time. Then again, maybe it\u2019s not the slanted floor that\u2019s causing it. Maybe it\u2019s simply because I\u2019m in a room with Lenora Hope\u2014a realization as surreal as it is surprising. The chant snakes back into my thoughts. At seventeen, Lenora Hope I wonder if I should be scared. Hung her sister with a rope Because I am. Stabbed her father with a knife Even though there\u2019s no reason to be scared. Took her mother\u2019s happy life This isn\u2019t the Lenora Hope of that awful rhyme. It\u2019s not even the Lenora of the portrait downstairs\u2014young and ripe and possibly that very moment plotting the murders of her family. This Lenora is old, withered, a wisp. I think of reading The Picture of Dorian Gray in high school. This is like the opposite of the book\u2014the painting in the hall getting fresher by the day as Lenora\u2019s crippled body atones for her sins. I take a few more steps, no longer bothered by the tilting house. Maybe Mrs. Baker is right. Maybe I am getting used to the place. \u201cHello, Lenora,\u201d I say. \u201cMiss Hope,\u201d Mrs. Baker says from the doorway, correcting me. \u201cThe help must never refer to the lady of the house by her Christian name.\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d I say. \u201cHello, Miss Hope.\u201d Lenora doesn\u2019t move, let alone acknowledge my presence. I kneel directly in front of the wheelchair, hoping to get a better look at her startling green eyes. My body tenses, bracing for whatever insights might be gleaming within them. About Lenora. About myself. But Lenora isn\u2019t cooperating. She stares past me, out the window, gaze fixed on the churning sea below. \u201cI\u2019m Kit,\u201d I say. \u201cKit McDeere.\u201d Lenora\u2019s eyes suddenly lock onto my own. I stare right back. What I see is unexpected. Curiosity, of all things, shimmers inside Lenora\u2019s gaze. As if she already knows me. As if she knows everything about me. That I\u2019ve been trapped. And accused. And judged and ostracized and ignored. Gazing into Lenora Hope\u2019s eyes feels like looking into that gilt-framed mirror and seeing my reflection staring back at me. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m going to take care of you from now on. Would you like that?\u201d Lenora Hope nods. Then she begins to smile. \n Before we continue, I need to make one thing clear. Don\u2019t try to help me write this. I know what I want to say. You\u2019re simply here to replace the hand I can\u2019t use. Just do what I need you to do, when I need you to do it. Understand? Good. Second, I\u2019m not writing this so you\u2019ll feel sorry for me. I neither want nor need your pity. I\u2019m also not doing it to prove my innocence. That\u2019s for others to decide, if and when I ever finish this. I\u2019m writing it because when I die, which could be any day now, I want there to be a record of the facts. This is the truth--good and bad. And the truth is that it all started the day of the portrait. The beginning of the end, although I had no idea then that would be the case. It was eight months before the murders. A lifetime when you\u2019re as young as I was then. It was also my birthday. The last birthday ever celebrated in this house. That year, my father decided to have everyone sit for a portrait on their birthday. It was his idea of a gift, which might have been fine for him and my mother, but not so much for my sister and me. No girl our age wanted a portrait as a present, especially when it meant getting dolled up and sitting for hours on end, not being allowed to move. The best thing about it was the artist, who was quite handsome. Peter was his name. Peter Ward. Since my father had commissioned him to paint portraits of every member of the family, it was his fourth time at Hope\u2019s End. By then, I was quite enamored of him. I put on my best dress--a pink satin gown--and made sure I looked as pretty as possible. I very much wanted to catch his eye. Unfortunately, so did my sister, who hovered over him the whole time, even though Miss Baker was already keeping a close watch on the artist. Because the portrait was being painted in my bedroom, she was worried something inappropriate might happen if Peter and I were left alone. Such behavior was typical for Miss Baker, who had been hired a year earlier to teach us etiquette and elocution. I knew what she really was, though. A governess for girls who didn\u2019t need a governess. I sat on the divan, trying not to move. Miss Baker stood rigidly in the corner, a disapproving look on her face. My sister, though, mooned about the room behind Peter, checking his canvas and saying things like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s her very likeness.\u201d Every time she did it, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh, which caused Peter to reprimand me several times. \u201cKeep still, please,\u201d he\u2019d say in a tone so deathly serious it made me laugh even more. I spent most of the sitting trying not to crack a smile, although it came through anyway in the finished portrait. My sister had been right about that. Peter captured me perfectly. \u201cBut I\u2019m so bored,\u201d I said as the sitting dragged on well into the afternoon. \u201cCan I at least read a book while you paint?\u201d \u201cYou could, but then I wouldn\u2019t be able to see your eyes,\u201d Peter said. \u201cAnd you have such lovely eyes.\u201d Now that was a birthday gift any girl my age would want. No one had ever called any part of me lovely before, and hearing it from Peter made my whole body quiver. Out of the blue, I began to wonder if Peter had ever painted someone nude. Someone more mature and developed than me, someone who was unashamed of her body. I wondered what it would feel like to slide out of my pink dress, lean back on the divan, and have Peter gaze at my naked form. Would he still think I was lovely? Would he feel compelled to leave his easel, join me on the divan, touch my skin, caress my hair? I began to blush, shocked by the wildness of my thoughts. I looked to Miss Baker, who contemplated me with dark eyes, as if she knew exactly what I was thinking. Apparently, my sister did as well. She approached Peter, coming up behind him until she was pressed against his back. She placed a hand on his shoulder, where it remained as she cooed, \u201cPeter, you really are the most talented man I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d The room suddenly felt hot, and in that moment, all I wanted was to be away from all of them. I longed to be outside, perched at the cliff\u2019s edge with the cool wind in my hair. \u201cAre we almost finished?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnother hour or two,\u201d Peter said. \u201cBe patient,\u201d Miss Baker added. But I no longer had any patience left. I hated her. I hated my sister. I hated my father for bringing Peter into this house. At that moment, the only member of my family I didn\u2019t despise was my mother. Her I pitied. Unable to sit still a moment longer, I leapt off the divan and headed for the door. \u201cI\u2019m not finished yet,\u201d Peter called after me. \u201cI most certainly am,\u201d I called back. I hurried down the back steps and into the kitchen, which was a riot of activity as the cooks and maids readied my birthday dinner. My anger surprised me. I knew my sister had no real interest in Peter, and that Peter had no interest in me. Honestly, I had no interest in him, either. But I did so desperately want someone to notice me, to see me, to understand me. Also, I was sick and tired of being at Hope\u2019s End. The name fit, for it felt like we were at the end of the world, cut off from any hope of being anywhere but here. My father built Hope\u2019s End as a tribute to himself. He claimed otherwise, of course. A peculiar trait among most self-important men is the need to try to hide their self-importance. My father did this by claiming Hope\u2019s End was constructed for his beloved wife and the baby girl she had just given birth to. Not true. He built it because he wanted to show everyone just how rich he was. It worked. For one cannot get a glimpse of Hope\u2019s End without thinking, \u201cThis is the home of a very wealthy man.\u201d Wealthy we were. Happy? Not so much. And the house, though opulent, reflected that. It\u2019s a cold place. An unwelcoming place. I know you can feel it. There\u2019s little comfort to be found here. And all I wanted to do was meet people, go places, experience the things I\u2019d only read about in books. It was 1929, and the world was alive with fast cars and jazz and dancing all night while drinking bathtub gin. I had experienced none of it. And how was I to become a great writer without having any experiences to write about? Some days, Hope\u2019s End felt so much like a prison that I thought I\u2019d scream if I had to spend one more minute inside its walls. Whenever I got that way, the only cure was to be outside. I loved the grounds and the sea and the sky. They always managed to soothe me, which is exactly what they did that day. Standing on the terrace, I inhaled the salty air and felt the cool wind on my face. I leaned against the railing and stared up at the tall windows that ran around the southeastern corner of the house. My mother\u2019s bedroom, which was separate from my father\u2019s. The two of them had long stopped sharing a bed. The drapes were drawn, which meant she was suffering another one of her \u201cnervous episodes.\u201d By then, she rarely left her bedroom. I shuddered at the sight of those tightly closed curtains. I couldn\u2019t imagine being trapped in my room all day, every day, never leaving. To me, that seemed like a fate worse than death. Yet here I am, living that exact scenario. It turns out I was right. Because here\u2019s an intriguing fact about Hope\u2019s End: The doors to all the bedrooms can only be locked from the outside, with individual keys required to open them. When my sister and I were young, one of my father\u2019s favorite games was to lock us in our bedrooms. Whoever went the longest without begging to be let out received a prize. Usually a bit of money or a fancy dessert and, once, a gold bracelet. The winner also got to decide how much longer the loser had to stay in her room. My sister won every single time. She never minded the game, but, oh, how it drove me crazy. I could never last more than a few hours before the walls felt like they were closing in and would trap me forever if I didn\u2019t get out. Because I was always the first to beg my father to open the door, I then had to stay in my room for as long as my sister decided. Once, she chose to keep me locked in for an additional twelve hours. I spent that entire night screaming and pounding on the door, demanding to be let out. When that didn\u2019t work, I tried breaking down the door by throwing myself against it. The door never budged. Even though I had lost, my father and sister never relented. I remained locked inside until midmorning. That\u2019s how it feels to be in this house, this room, this body. Like I\u2019ve been locked inside during one of my father\u2019s games and there\u2019s no one on the other side of the door holding the key that can set me free. \n SIX Lenora and I have adjoining rooms, a fact I discover after bringing my belongings upstairs. The first thing I unpack is the metal lockbox I use to store medication. The same one that got me suspended and investigated by the police after I failed to use it. Now empty, I slide it under the bed and drop the key in a nightstand drawer. Next are my clothes. After opening the suitcase, I try the door to what I think is a closet. Instead, I find myself looking straight into Lenora\u2019s room. Mrs. Baker is still there, putting a slim pair of headphones over Lenora\u2019s ears. They\u2019re attached to a brick-like Walkman resting in Lenora\u2019s lap. \u201cAh, Kit,\u201d Mrs. Baker says as she presses the Walkman\u2019s play button. \u201cLet\u2019s go over Miss Hope\u2019s routine.\u201d I drift into Lenora\u2019s room, curious. She\u2019s a strange sight\u2014a woman in her seventies, slumped in a wheelchair that likely hasn\u2019t been made since the forties, enjoying the latest technology of the eighties. \u201cWhat is she listening to?\u201d \u201cA book on cassette tape,\u201d Mrs. Baker says, as if offended by the very concept. \u201cJessica records herself reading aloud and then gives the tapes to Miss Hope to listen to.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s very nice of her.\u201d \u201cIf you say so.\u201d Mrs. Baker goes to a sideboard beneath the window. Inside are dozens of cassette tapes in plastic cases. Scrawled on the labels in red Magic Marker are many titles I recognize. The Thorn Birds. Clan of the Cave Bear. More than a few books by Jackie Collins. Nearby, Lenora listens to one of the tapes with a look of contentment on her face. Like a child just handed their favorite toy. She remains that way as Mrs. Baker gives me a crash course on how to take care of her. We first go over Lenora\u2019s medications, of which there are many. Aspirin, a water pill, an anticoagulant, a statin, a pill to control muscle spasms, another to prevent osteoporosis. All of them sit on Lenora\u2019s nightstand. Six little orange bottles arranged in a row atop a silver serving tray. I open each bottle, familiarizing myself with the pills\u2019 shapes, sizes, and colors. Also on the tray are a mortar and pestle. Their presence tells me I\u2019m to crush the pills. \u201cI mix them in with Miss Hope\u2019s food, right?\u201d \u201cThree with breakfast, three with dinner,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cThe bottles are marked.\u201d I note the stickers on the bottles as she continues, telling me how I\u2019m to spend two hours each day\u2014one in the morning, one in the evening\u2014gently moving Lenora\u2019s arms and legs to improve her circulation. Each morning and evening I\u2019m also supposed to brush her teeth, brush her hair, and change her out of her sleeping clothes and into her daytime clothes and back again. I need to feed her. And bathe her. And help her onto the toilet when she can manage to go or change her adult diaper when she can\u2019t. We talk as if Lenora isn\u2019t in the room with us, silent and still in her wheelchair. Occasionally, I glance her way, trying to get a read on how much she\u2019s aware of what\u2019s going on around her. Half the time, she seems oblivious to our presence, content to stare out the window and listen to her book on tape. The other half, though, I sense acute concentration. As if she\u2019s keeping track of my every move. At one point, Lenora\u2019s gaze leaves the window and drifts my way. A sidelong glance she doesn\u2019t want me to notice. When I do, her eyes snap back toward the window. \u201cWhat does Miss Hope do for fun?\u201d \u201cFun?\u201d Mrs. Baker says, as if she\u2019s never heard the word. \u201cMiss Hope doesn\u2019t have fun. She rests.\u201d \u201cAll day?\u201d I scan the room, which is larger than mine but also stuffy, in both air flow and furnishings. The windows are firmly shut, making me question when they were last opened. A crisp ocean breeze would do wonders. But it doesn\u2019t smell like a sickroom, either. A relief. I\u2019ve spent far too much time moving around sticky rooms that smell of sweat, body odor, and decay. As for the furniture, well, not much can be done about that. In addition to the sideboard and faded divan, there\u2019s an armoire against the opposite wall, a desk in the corner, an armchair that matches the divan, and several side tables with Tiffany lamps. It\u2019s frilly and slightly girlish and makes me conclude that this was Lenora\u2019s childhood bedroom and has remained unchanged for decades. The idea of a woman sleeping in the same room she had as a child would be weird if not for the fact that I have just been doing the same thing. The only nod to modernity is a Hoyer lift next to the bed, which allows for easier transfer to and from a wheelchair. I\u2019ve used them plenty of times, although this looks to be an early model. Its U-shaped base, angled support pole, and hydraulic pump aren\u2019t as sleek as other versions. At the top, dangling from what looks like an oversize coat hanger, is a nylon sling. The bed itself is crowded with pillows, which bear a human-shaped indentation. I shudder at the thought of being forced to lie there all day with nothing to do. \u201cSurely there\u2019s something she likes to do,\u201d I say, searching for a television somewhere in the room. Most of my other patients loved having the TV on, even if they didn\u2019t really watch. Just the sound of it kept them company. Instead of a television, I spot a typewriter atop the desk. It\u2019s old\u2014mint green, off-white keys, clearly a relic of the sixties\u2014but in working condition, as evidenced by a sheet of paper slid into the carriage. \u201cIs that for Miss Hope?\u201d Mrs. Baker gives the typewriter a passing glance. \u201cIn her youth, she wanted to be a writer. When Mary discovered this fact, she bought a typewriter with the intent of teaching Miss Hope how to use it.\u201d \u201cDid she?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cBut over the years, we\u2019ve devised a way for her to communicate her needs. She can answer yes or no questions by tapping her left hand. Once for no, twice for yes. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s worked well so far.\u201d I again flex my left hand, unnerved by the idea of having only that with which to communicate. I shoot another quick glance at Lenora, who\u2019s resumed watching me. This time, she doesn\u2019t try to hide it. Lenora simply stares. \u201cAs for Miss Hope\u2019s care,\u201d Mrs. Baker says, stressing the word to make it clear she thinks all other topics are frivolous, \u201cdinner is served at seven. While you\u2019re certainly welcome to join us in the kitchen after feeding Miss Hope, most of the nurses have found it easier to eat here with her. After dinner, it\u2019s time for a second hour of circulatory therapy, followed by Miss Hope\u2019s bath.\u201d She opens a door on one side of the armoire. Inside is a bathroom with gleaming white tile, a radiator hissing beneath the towel rack, another Hoyer lift beside the clawfoot bathtub, and a sink high enough to accommodate Lenora\u2019s wheelchair. \u201cMiss Hope is put to bed promptly at nine. If she requires assistance during the night, Miss Hope will use this call button to summon you.\u201d Mrs. Baker goes to the nightstand on the left side of Lenora\u2019s bed and picks up a thick plastic square that resembles an Atari controller missing its joystick. The button is the same, though. A fat red circle Mrs. Baker presses with her thumb. A loud buzz erupts from my room. Accompanying it is a red light I can see through the open adjoining door, flaring from a plastic stand on my night table. \u201cAre there any questions?\u201d she says. \u201cIf I think of any, I\u2019ll be sure to ask.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that in the least,\u201d Mrs. Baker says, her voice dry as tumbleweed. \u201cI now officially entrust Miss Hope to your care. May you serve her well.\u201d The words are uttered with zero enthusiasm, as if Mrs. Baker doubts this will come to pass. Then she turns and leaves the room, her black skirt swishing. I remain by the door a moment, swaying slightly. While I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s the fault of the mansion\u2019s tilt, I know the real cause. I\u2019m now alone with Lenora Hope. My pulse quickens unexpectedly. After seeing that bit of myself in Lenora\u2019s eyes, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be so nervous. But the room feels different now that it\u2019s just the two of us. There\u2019s a charge in the air, likely muffled by Mrs. Baker\u2019s presence. With her gone, I can feel the full weight of it, electric and vaguely foreboding. And scary. Surprisingly so. Years ago, when I was young and my father still spoke to me, we were in the backyard when a bee landed on my arm. Before I could shriek or run away, my father gripped me by the shoulders and held me in place. \u201cNever show fear, Kit-Kat,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThey can tell if you\u2019re scared\u2014and that\u2019s when they sting.\u201d I remained still, pretending to be brave as the bee crawled up my arm, across my neck, onto my cheek. Then it flew away, leaving me unscathed. I try to summon that same illusion of fearlessness now as I approach Lenora, leaning slightly to counterbalance the tilted floor. I check the Walkman in her lap. The cassette inside no longer turns, having come to the end an unknown number of minutes ago. I gingerly remove the headphones from her ears and set them on the sideboard with the Walkman. It prompts an annoyed look from Lenora. \u201cSorry,\u201d I say. \u201cNow that it\u2019s just us, I thought we should\u2014I should\u2014talk. Let you get to know me better.\u201d I take a seat on the divan and face Lenora, whose gaze drifts a bit before those green eyes zero in on me once again. In addition to being unnervingly bright, her eyes are subtly expressive. A byproduct of not being able to speak. Lenora\u2019s eyes must do all the work. Right now, they flicker with wariness and a wee bit of indecision. As if she doesn\u2019t quite know what to make of me. Likewise, Lenora. Likewise. \u201cSo, Miss Hope\u2014\u201d I stop, hating the way it sounds. It\u2019s too formal, no matter what Mrs. Baker says. Besides, I\u2019ve always found that addressing a person by their first name makes them seem less intimidating. Which is likely why Mrs. Baker never shared hers. It was a power move. Since Miss Hope is intimidating enough without the formality, I make the split-second decision to use her first name when Mrs. Baker isn\u2019t around. \u201cSo, Lenora,\u201d I begin again. \u201cAs I said earlier, my name is Kit. And I\u2019m here to help you with anything you need.\u201d Which is everything. Another daunting realization. All my previous patients could feed themselves or walk with assistance. And all of them could speak, letting me know what they needed and when. All Lenora can do is use her left arm, and I have no idea if that goes beyond her being able to press a red button. \u201cLet\u2019s start by testing that communication system Mrs. Baker told me about,\u201d I say. \u201cYou can do it, right?\u201d Lenora curls the fingers of her left hand inward, forming a loose fist. She then drops her knuckles against the armrest of her wheelchair once, twice. That\u2019s a yes. \u201cAwesome,\u201d I say. \u201cNow let\u2019s see what kind of shape you\u2019re in.\u201d I fetch my medical bag and do a routine check of Lenora\u2019s vitals. Her blood pressure is a little high, but not worrisomely so, and her pulse is normal for a woman her age and in her condition. When I test her reflexes, all of Lenora\u2019s limbs react in some capacity. Normal for both her right arm\u2014paralysis doesn\u2019t mean the body can\u2019t react\u2014and her legs, which are too weakened by polio to use. As for her left arm, it responds exactly the way the working arm of someone in their seventies should. The only cause for minor concern is a faded bruise on the inside of Lenora\u2019s forearm. It\u2019s small\u2014just a smudge of purple surrounded by yellow\u2014and seems to be healing correctly. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d I say. \u201cDid you bump into something?\u201d Lenora taps twice. Another yes. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d A single tap this time. No. \u201cLet me know if it does. Now, let\u2019s see what else this arm can do.\u201d I clasp Lenora\u2019s left hand. It\u2019s cold and pale. Practically translucent. A road map of veins runs just beneath the papery skin. \u201cMove it for me, please.\u201d Lenora\u2019s fingers wiggle in my hands. \u201cGood. Now make a fist. As tight as you can.\u201d Her nails scritch against my palm as her hand curls into a fist tighter than the one she made to tap on the armrest. \u201cNot bad,\u201d I say. \u201cLet\u2019s see how much that hand can hold.\u201d I grab a pill bottle from the tray on the nightstand and place it in Lenora\u2019s open palm. She wraps her fingers around the bottle, keeping her grasp steady. \u201cVery good,\u201d I say as I return the pill bottle to the tray. Searching the room for another object to use, I spot a snow globe atop the sideboard. Roughly the size of a tennis ball, it\u2019s clearly old. The globe is glass, not plastic, and inside is a hand-painted scene of Paris, including a tiny Eiffel Tower rising to the top of the dome. I give the snow globe a shake. Any liquid that had once been there is long gone, leaving the gold flakes inside to dryly tumble like reused confetti. I put the snow globe in Lenora\u2019s left hand. Though small, it\u2019s heavy, and her hand trembles under its weight. A noise leaves her throat. A tiny, tortured croak that makes me immediately take the snow globe as Lenora\u2019s hand drops back onto the armrest. She frowns, looking disappointed that she failed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You tried your best.\u201d I put the snow globe back on the sideboard, the motion setting off another glittery plume. Back at Lenora\u2019s side, I take her hand. Under her skin, the veins pulse slightly. \u201cHave you ever been to Paris?\u201d Lenora curls her hand into a loose fist and gives my palm a single, sad tap. \u201cSame here,\u201d I say. \u201cWas the snow globe a gift from someone who was?\u201d Two taps this time. \u201cYour parents?\u201d Another two taps. \u201cDo you miss them?\u201d Lenora thinks about it. Not for very long. Just enough for me to notice the pause. Then she taps twice against my palm. \u201cAnd your sister?\u201d I say. \u201cDo you miss her, too?\u201d I get a single tap this time. One so adamant it stings my hand. No. A troubling answer, accompanied by a more troubling thought\u2014Lenora used this hand when she killed her sister. With a rope. And her father With a knife. And her mother. That happy life. Knowing that the hand I\u2019m holding did all those horrible things makes me let go of it with a gasp. Lenora\u2019s hand plops into her lap, prompting a sharp look, part surprised and part hurt. But soon her expression changes into something more aware, almost amused. She knows what I was thinking. Because I\u2019m not the first caregiver to think such things. Others have, too. Some might have also dropped her hand like a hot potato immediately after. Even Mary. Like me, they probably also wondered not just how Lenora killed her family, but why. That\u2019s the big mystery, after all. There must be a reason. No one slaughters their entire family without motive. No one sane, that is. I look at Lenora, wondering if beneath her silence and stillness madness churns. It doesn\u2019t seem that way, especially when Lenora stares back. I sense a keen intelligence at work behind those green eyes as she moves them from me to the typewriter at the desk. The look is urgent. Almost as if she\u2019s trying to tell me something. \u201cYou want to use that?\u201d I ask. Lenora taps twice. \u201cMary showed you how?\u201d Another two taps. Emphatic ones that echo through the room. Even so, I have my doubts. It seems impossible that someone in Lenora\u2019s condition could use it, even with assistance. I was fired from a typing pool. I know how hard those machines can be for someone who has the use of both hands. Still, I wheel Lenora to the desk and place her left hand on the keyboard. She\u2019s changed subtly now that we\u2019re alone at the typewriter. Brighter and more alert, her fingers slide over the keys, as if she\u2019s carefully deciding which to press first. Settling on one, she uses her index finger to push down with all her might. A typebar springs from the machine and strikes the paper with a loud thwack. Lenora beams. She\u2019s enjoying this. After pressing eight more keys, including the space bar, she exhales, satisfied. Because she can\u2019t do it herself, it\u2019s up to me to tap the return bar, bringing the carriage back to its starting position. The motion inches the page up a line, letting me see what she just typed. hello kit I smile despite my nervousness. \u201cHello.\u201d Lenora bobs her head toward the typewriter. A sign she wants to keep going. \u201cIsn\u2019t this hard for you?\u201d I say. Once again, her left hand roams the keys before pressing a letter. Her typing isn\u2019t fast. I suspect she averages about a word per minute, which isn\u2019t much worse than me in the typing pool. Unlike me, she\u2019s persistent, working with intense concentration. As she hunts and pecks, her brow furrows and her tongue pokes from a corner of her mouth. Soon she\u2019s typed nine more words, each one broken by a thwack of the space bar. my body is dead but my mind is alive Lenora stares up at me expectantly, nervously biting her lower lip, trying to gauge my reaction. It\u2019s such a pure expression. Her feelings are so evident that she reminds me of a teenager. Someone who can\u2019t help but wear her heart on her sleeve. It occurs to me that Lenora could still be like a teenager in so many ways. For decades, she\u2019s been living in this house, in this very room, surrounded by objects of her youth. Nothing about her life has changed since she was seventeen. Without family or friends or even a change of scenery to push her into maturity, Lenora might still mentally be a teenager. Which means there\u2019s a chance her emotional state now is exactly how it was the night her family was murdered. The rhyme again skips through my memory, taunting. At seventeen, Lenora Hope Unnerved, I pull my hand away from the typewriter, as if Lenora\u2019s about to reach out and grab me. She notices, of course, and nods for me to hit the typewriter\u2019s return bar. I do, quickly and abruptly, making sure there\u2019s no contact between us. In response, Lenora types out three small but meaningful words. dont be scared Another nod from her. Another swift swipe of the return bar from me, allowing Lenora to type another line. i cant hurt you If the goal was to put me at ease, then Lenora has failed miserably. I won\u2019t hurt you. Now that would have calmed my nerves. What Lenora ended up typing does the opposite. That insidious, apostrophe-less can\u2019t suggests a lack of capability, not willingness. And that Lenora would hurt me if she could. \n SEVEN We eat dinner in silence, something I\u2019ve become quite used to in the past six months. I sit facing Lenora, making sure our knees don\u2019t touch. Since we left the typewriter, I\u2019ve kept physical contact to a minimum. Our plates sit on the wooden tray I attached to Lenora\u2019s wheelchair. Roasted chicken and glazed carrots for me, mashed acorn squash seasoned with crushed pills for Lenora. Since I don\u2019t know who to feed first, me or her, I decide to alternate bites. One mouthful for Lenora and one for me until both plates are cleaned. After dinner is dessert. I get chocolate cake. Lenora gets pudding. After dessert, it\u2019s time for Lenora\u2019s evening circulation exercises. Something I\u2019m not looking forward to because it means our limited contact must come to an end. For the rest of the evening, Lenora and I are going to be uncomfortably close. I use the Hoyer lift to get her out of the wheelchair and onto the bed. It requires sliding the sling under her, raising her out of the wheelchair, moving the whole contraption while she dangles like a kid on a swing, lowering her onto the bed, then pulling the sling out from under her. It\u2019s easier in theory than in practice, especially because Lenora is heavier than she looks. A surprising sturdiness hides inside her birdlike frame. On the bed, I lift Lenora\u2019s right leg before bending it, pushing the knee toward her chest. Lenora stares at the ceiling while I do it, seemingly bored. I think about how many times\u2014with how many different nurses\u2014she\u2019s had to do this. Thousands, most likely. Morning and evening, day after day after day. When I move on to her left leg, Lenora lolls her head to the side, as if trying to see past me to the window. Even though it\u2019s dark now and there\u2019s not much to see, I understand why. It\u2019s better than looking at the ceiling. At least there\u2019s variety out there, even in the darkness. The full moon sits so low on the horizon it looks like it\u2019s bobbing on the ocean\u2019s surface. Clouds as thin as fingers drift in front of it. In the distance, a ship cruises through the night, its lights as bright as stars. I glance down at Lenora and notice longing in her eyes. I can relate. All my life, I\u2019ve felt like the world is passing me by. I was born in 1952, and my late teens coincided with the end of the sixties. I spent my high school years working in a diner, watching as my few friends decamped to San Francisco, skipped north into Canada to avoid the draft, went to Woodstock and came back tuned in, turned on, dropped out. I watched the moon landing on the evening shift, catching glimpses of history while carrying trays of blue plate specials. My mother assured me not to worry. That by reading, whole worlds could be explored without ever leaving home. My father, on the other hand, warned me to get used to it. \u201cIt\u2019s our lot in life, Kit-Kat,\u201d he told me. \u201cPeople like us toil. The rich bastards running everything make sure of that.\u201d I believed him. I think that\u2019s partly how I ended up a caregiver, so willing to put others\u2019 needs before mine, not even daydreaming about a bigger life. \u201cI don\u2019t get out much, either,\u201d I tell Lenora. \u201cI\u2019ve basically been stuck inside for the past twelve years.\u201d Phrasing it that way startles me. Twelve long years. Not as long as Lenora, but stuck all the same. Only the rooms and patients have changed. I try to remember them all and am surprised when I can\u2019t. How strange it is to have spent so much time in a single place with someone and forget everything about it. About them. I chalk that up to monotony. The people and places were different, but the job was the same. Day after week after year until it all became a blur. It dawns on me that, probably like Lenora, I completely missed the seventies. All those touchstones everyone else got to experience passed me by like a speeding car. I never went to a disco. I didn\u2019t see Jaws until it was shown on TV. I breezed through both gas crises without ever waiting in line to fill my tank. Watergate and all the political upheaval that came afterward was mere background noise as I spoon-fed patients and gave them their pills and sponged their withered bodies. A brief pain pierces my side. Like a knife poking into my ribs. Longing, I realize. For a life I\u2019ve never had\u2014and likely never will. \u201cYou ever feel that way, Lenora?\u201d I say. \u201cThat there\u2019s a whole life out there you could have lived but didn\u2019t?\u201d Lenora taps twice against the mattress. \u201cI thought so.\u201d Soon we\u2019re done with the exercises and on to the next task\u2014bath time. In the bathroom, I start filling the tub before wheeling Lenora in next to it. When it\u2019s full, I reach for Lenora\u2019s left hand but can\u2019t bring myself to grasp it. Just like that, I\u2019m back to being nervous touching her. Mentally cursing Mr. Gurlain, I force my hand around Lenora\u2019s and dip it into the water. \u201cToo hot?\u201d Lenora raps once against the tub. No. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d I say, stalling, not wanting to face what\u2019s next\u2014slipping Lenora out of her clothes. After two taps signaling the affirmative, there\u2019s no more avoiding it. Lenora Hope and I are about to get intimately acquainted. At the start of my career, I used to avert my eyes when undressing a patient. Out of respect for them, yes, but also because I didn\u2019t want to see what the future had in store for me. All those wrinkles and blotches and saggy breasts. Now I\u2019ve come to terms with it. This is what I\u2019ll eventually look like. What everyone will look like. If they\u2019re lucky, that is. Or maybe if they\u2019re unlucky. I\u2019m still on the fence about that. Seeing a patient naked is simply part of the job. It\u2019s the same with bodily fluids. In the past twelve years, I\u2019ve encountered most of them. Blood and urine. Puke and snot. And shit. Way too much of that. I use the Hoyer lift to get Lenora into the tub. A task made more difficult by the cramped bathroom, my ill-fitting uniform, and that lingering urge to have as little physical contact between us as possible. It all leaves me awkward and fumbling, to the point where I accidentally knock Lenora\u2019s elbow against the tub\u2019s edge. She flashes a narrow-eyed look of annoyance. \u201cSorry,\u201d I say. Lenora sighs, and for the first time I sense frustration that she\u2019s not able to speak. The feeling is mutual. There\u2019s so much I want to ask her. So much I need to know. Because I don\u2019t think I can continue like this. Nervous in her presence. Afraid to even touch her, which is pretty much the reason I\u2019m here\u2014to do all the things Lenora\u2019s right arm and legs can\u2019t. \u201cWe need to talk,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, I need to talk.\u201d I pause, as if Lenora can respond. Instead, her silence fills the bathroom like steam, making it feel small, almost oppressive. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019ll try not to be. But it\u2019s hard. Maybe it would be easier if I knew why\u2014\u201d I catch myself before I can finish the sentence. Why you killed the rest of your family. Lenora knows what I mean anyway. I can sense it as I squeeze shampoo into my hands and start to lather her hair. \u201cBecause I might understand.\u201d I cup water into my hands and pour it over Lenora\u2019s head, taking care to keep soapy water from getting into her eyes. My mother did the same thing when I was young. I returned the favor when, years later, I had to bathe her. The act has always struck me as something sacred. Like a baptism. Doing it now, in this stuffy, silent bathroom, puts me in a confessional mood. That\u2019s something my father suggested, right before he all but stopped talking to me. Go to the priest. Confess my sins. I didn\u2019t then. But I attempt it now. \u201cIt turns out, we\u2019re a lot alike, Lenora.\u201d I cup more water, splash it onto her head, let it trickle down her hair as if the act will absolve us both. \u201cWe both like books. We haven\u2019t been anywhere for years and years. And I know what you\u2019re going through.\u201d I pause, unsure if I should continue. Or if I even want to. But then Lenora gives me a sidelong glance, looking as curious about me as I am about her. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest thing we have in common,\u201d I finally say. \u201cThat everyone thinks I also killed my mother.\u201d \n EIGHT Even though I would have cared for my mother for free, my parents insisted on hiring me through Gurlain Home Health Aides. My mother\u2019s idea. Such a proud woman. There was no way Kathleen McDeere would accept charity. Even though stomach cancer was eating away at her\u2014and even though everyone knew it was far too late to do anything about it\u2014she insisted on paying. So I left the patient I had been caring for, a rather boring octogenarian with chronic arthritis, and moved back into my childhood bedroom. At first, it was weird treating my own mother like one of my patients. They all seemed so old. She didn\u2019t. Not that she was young. My mother was thirty-four when she had me and my father thirty-nine. I always assumed that one day I\u2019d be expected to care for them. I just didn\u2019t think it would be this soon. Or this brutal. That was something I wasn\u2019t prepared for, no matter how many other patients I\u2019d cared for. It\u2019s different when it\u2019s your own mother. It matters more. It hurts more, too. But none of the hurt I felt could compare to what my mother was going through. She spent the first few weeks of her illness in a daze, gobsmacked by all the ways in which her body had betrayed her. Then came the pain, so sharp it sometimes left her doubled over and weeping. I urged her doctor to prescribe fentanyl, even though he wanted to wait. \u201cJust a few more weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she\u2019s in agony now,\u201d I said. He wrote out the prescription. Two weeks later my mother was dead of a fentanyl overdose. To an untrained eye, it might have looked like a tragic accident. A sick woman rendered mad by pain taking more pills than she should have. To a trained eye, however, it was worse than that. Because of her condition, it could be argued that my mother was not in a sound state of mind. Which meant that I, as her caregiver, was responsible for making decisions on her behalf and in her best interests. Since I\u2019d left a drug known for its overdose potential within her reach, one could also argue that I was negligent in her care and therefore responsible for her death. That\u2019s what Mr. Gurlain thought, once I admitted I forgot to put the pill bottle in the lockbox under my bed. He didn\u2019t tell me this, of course. He simply contacted the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services, who then contacted the local police. A day after my mother\u2019s funeral, a detective came to the house. Richard Vick. Because he and my father had been friends back in the day, I knew him slightly. He had the look of a sitcom grandfather. Full head of white hair. Friendly smile. Kind eyes. \u201cHello there, Kit,\u201d he said. \u201cMy deepest condolences on your recent loss.\u201d I looked at him with confusion, even though by then I should have known why he was there. \u201cCan I help you with something, Mr. Vick?\u201d \u201cDetective Vick, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d He gave a half smile, as if apologizing for the formality. \u201cIs your dad around?\u201d He wasn\u2019t. My father, stoic in his grief, went to work as usual that day, off to fix the clanging pipes in old Mrs. Mayweather\u2019s house. I told this to Detective Vick, adding a polite \u201cI\u2019ll tell him you stopped by.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m actually here to see you.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I opened the door wider and told him to come in. Detective Vick straightened his tie, cleared his throat, and said, \u201cIt might be better if we did this down at the station.\u201d \u201cDo I need a lawyer?\u201d I was told no, of course not, it was just an informal chat about what happened. I wasn\u2019t a suspect because there was nothing to suspect. All lies, as I learned when I followed Detective Vick to the station and was escorted into an interrogation room with a tape recorder he turned on the moment we sat down. \u201cPlease state your name,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know my name.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s for the record.\u201d I stared at the tape recorder, watching the reels turn and turn. That was when I knew I was in trouble. \u201cKit McDeere.\u201d \u201cAnd what is it you do, Kit?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m an in-home caregiver with Gurlain Home Health Aides.\u201d \u201cHow long have you been doing this?\u201d \u201cTwelve years.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a long time,\u201d Detective Vick said. \u201cI assume you\u2019re probably an expert at it by now.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI guess.\u201d Detective Vick opened a folder in front of him, inside of which was the coroner\u2019s report on my mother\u2019s death. \u201cIt says here your mother died of an overdose of prescription painkillers and that you, acting as her caregiver, had been the one to find her body.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d \u201cHow did you feel when you realized your mother was dead?\u201d I thought back to that morning. How I woke early, took one look at the gray-streaked sky, and just knew my mother was gone. Before crossing the hall to her room, I could have woken my father, who had taken to sleeping on the couch to give my mother more space in bed. We could have checked on her together, sparing me the burden of being the one to find her dead. Instead, I peeked into her bedroom and found my mother with her head on her pillow, her eyes closed, her hands folded over her chest. Finally, she was at peace. \u201cSad,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd relieved.\u201d Detective Vick arched a brow. His eyes were no longer kind. Instead, they radiated suspicion. \u201cRelieved?\u201d \u201cThat she was no longer suffering.\u201d \u201cI suppose it\u2019s natural to think that.\u201d \u201cIt is,\u201d I replied, with more bite than was appropriate under the circumstances. I couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cYour employer, Mr. Gurlain, told me it was standard procedure to lock away all pills while you\u2019re asleep to prevent patients from having access to them. Is that true?\u201d I nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll need you to answer that, Kit,\u201d Detective Vick said with a nod toward the tape recorder. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cBut Mr. Gurlain also told me you confessed to not doing that with the pills your mother overdosed on.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t confess,\u201d I said, thrown off by the word. \u201cSo you did put the pills away?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI left them out. But I didn\u2019t confess. That makes me sound guilty of something. I simply told Mr. Gurlain I left them out.\u201d \u201cHave you ever left medication out like that before?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNever?\u201d \u201cEver.\u201d \u201cSo this was the first time you forgot to lock away the pills like you\u2019re supposed to?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I said, sighing the word as my frustration increased. I looked again to the tape recorder and wondered how the sigh would sound when played back. Impatient? Guilty? \u201cDid you intentionally leave them out?\u201d Detective Vick asked. \u201cNo. It was an accident.\u201d \u201cI find that hard to believe, Kit.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true.\u201d \u201cFor the twelve years you\u2019ve been a caregiver, you\u2019ve never once left medication within a patient\u2019s reach. The one time you do, the patient just happens to overdose. But not just any patient. Your very own mother, who was in so much pain that you begged her doctor to prescribe the very drugs that killed her. And when she died, you admit to feeling relieved. That doesn\u2019t sound like an accident to me, Kit.\u201d I continued to eye the tape recorder, the reels turning and turning and turning. \u201cI\u2019d like a lawyer,\u201d I said. After that, everything fell like dominoes. A formal police investigation began, Mr. Gurlain suspended me, and I was assigned a public defender who told me I\u2019d likely be charged with involuntary manslaughter at best and homicide at worst if the police thought I forced those pills on my mother. He recommended I take whatever plea deal they offered. The last domino\u2014the final straw for my father\u2014was when the investigation made the front page of the local newspaper. Police Suspect Daughter Caused Mother\u2019s Fatal Overdose In the end, though, there was no way to prove I left those pills out on purpose or that I made my mother take them. I have no doubt that lack of proof is the sole reason I\u2019m walking free today. I know Detective Vick thinks I\u2019m responsible. Everyone does. \u201cIncluding my father,\u201d I tell Lenora after giving her my sad story as I lifted her from the tub, toweled her off, put her in a clean nightgown and fresh adult diaper, and tucked her into bed. \u201cHe might never speak to me again. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here instead of there.\u201d I collect her medication from the nightstand and drop the bottles into the lockbox, which then goes back under my bed. Even though there\u2019s no way Lenora could reach them on the nightstand, I can\u2019t be too cautious. Not after what happened with my mother. Back in Lenora\u2019s room, I place the red call button next to her left hand so she can easily use it. \u201cI\u2019ll be right next door if you need me,\u201d I say, which is what I also told my mother every night I was caring for her. Lenora looks up at me, apprehension dulling her green eyes. My stomach clenches as I realize what it means. Even she thinks I\u2019m guilty. I guess that makes us even. \n My birthday dinner was unbearable. Such an unhappy affair, despite all the effort put into it. There was spring lamb, leek soup, and potatoes roasted in rosemary. The dinner was attended by only me, Miss Baker, my father, my sister, and a special guest at her request--Peter. Although there was a place setting for my mother, she sent her maid to inform us that she felt too weak to come down to dinner. For dessert, the kitchen staff wheeled in a massive three-tiered cake with pink frosting and birthday candles ablaze. I tried to appear enthusiastic as I blew them out. I truly did. But since everything felt so awful, I couldn\u2019t quite manage it. Not that anyone noticed. My sister was preoccupied by flirting with Peter and my father was too busy ogling the newest maid, Sally. I could have grabbed a handful of cake and shoved it into my mouth and only stern Miss Baker would have batted an eye. After dinner, I went upstairs to see my mother. She was in bed, of course, the duvet pulled to her chest. She looked so small and pitiful that it was hard to believe she had once been a great beauty. \u201cThe most beautiful girl in Boston,\u201d my father liked to boast back when my sister and I were younger and my parents had at least pretended to love each other. I know he was telling the truth. In her youth, my mother had been astoundingly beautiful. It didn\u2019t hurt that she also hailed from one of the wealthiest families in New England. That fact, combined with her good looks, made her irresistible to my father, who was New Money through and through. A striver of unchecked ambition, he set his sights on Evangeline Staunton. It didn\u2019t matter that all of Boston whispered about how she had taken up with one of the servants, scandalizing her family and edging herself to the brink of being disowned. My father still pursued her with vigor. My mother, of course, enjoyed the attention. More than once, I\u2019d heard her described as a rose blossoming in sunlight. My father\u2019s sun must have shone bright, because in a matter of weeks they wed. My mother got pregnant immediately after and my father built Hope\u2019s End. Years later, when his attention began to wane, my mother--like any flower removed from the light--withered. There was nothing roselike about her the night of my birthday. Pale, shriveled, and thin to the point of gauntness, she was all thorns. \u201cHello, my darling,\u201d she said, using the term of endearment meant only for me. My sister and I each had one, chosen by our parents the day we were born. My sister was dear. I was darling. Although that night, my mother murmured it in a way that made me unsure if she was addressing me or the brown bottle of liquid resting on the pillow next to her. Laudanum. Her cure-all, although as far as I could tell, it cured nothing. \u201cDid you have a happy birthday?\u201d Certain it was indeed me she was talking to, I lied and told her that I did. \u201cI do wish we could have celebrated it in Boston,\u201d my mother said. As did I. To me, Boston was another universe I was only allowed to enjoy once a year before being whisked back to the banality of Hope\u2019s End. It had everything this place didn\u2019t. Restaurants and shops, theaters and cinemas. The last time we visited was right after Christmas. I tasted champagne for the first time, rode a swan boat in Boston Common, went to the movies, and saw Mickey Mouse in \u201cSteamboat Willie.\u201d I couldn\u2019t wait to return. \u201cPerhaps my next birthday,\u201d I said hopefully. My mother gave a sleepy nod and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a gift for you over there. Just a little token from your father and I.\u201d On the dresser was a small box in pink paper and blue ribbon. Inside was a small snow globe with a miniature Eiffel Tower rising above a row of tiny mansard roofs. \u201cShake it,\u201d my mother said, and I did, sending tiny gold flakes spinning around inside the globe. \u201cI so wanted to take you girls to Paris,\u201d my mother said, as if such a journey were no longer possible. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll go one day.\u201d I gripped the snow globe tight and nodded. \u201cGo to Paris and fall in love, then write all about it. I know how much you love to write. Write down all your thoughts and hopes and dreams as you go on grand adventures. Promise me you\u2019ll do that, my darling. Promise me you won\u2019t remain here.\u201d \u201cI promise,\u201d I said. My mother began to cry then. Openly weeping, she reached for the laudanum and lifted the bottle to her lips. I left just before she began to gulp it down. \n NINE I\u2019m not surprised to discover that there\u2019s no TV in my room, either. I\u2019ve seen enough of Hope\u2019s End to know it exists mostly in the past, from the antique box of a phone I spotted in the kitchen to the old-timey toilet in my bathroom, which can only be flushed by yanking a pull cord. While I don\u2019t mind not having a TV\u2014I never watched much anyway\u2014I am glad I brought plenty of books. I set the box of them on the floor and open it up, wondering if I have the energy to try to cram them onto the already-full bookshelf. Spending the day caring for Lenora while subconsciously overcompensating for the leaning house has left me feeling sore and exhausted. Being a caregiver is hard work. It uses muscles you never know you have until that first day spent with your first patient. Or maybe it was talking about my mother that\u2019s left me exhausted. It usually does. Speaking about what happened gives weight to the bad memories, making them feel raw and recent. Right now, I\u2019m so burdened by them that instead of unpacking the box and my suitcase, I\u2019m tempted to collapse into bed and not wake until the sunrise peeks over the horizon. But then I hear a sharp rap on my bedroom door. Mrs. Baker, I assume, ready to either criticize, chastise, or inform me of something else I need to do. Instead, it\u2019s Jessica I find standing in the hall. Gone is her uniform, which has been replaced by stirrup pants and an oversize Madonna T-shirt. The jewelry remains, however, jangling as she offers a happy wave. \u201cHi,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s Kit, right?\u201d \u201cRight. And you\u2019re Jessica.\u201d \u201cJessie. Only Mrs. Baker calls me Jessica.\u201d She starts fiddling with one of her bracelets. \u201cAnyhoo, I just wanted to officially welcome you to Hope\u2019s End. The name fits, by the way. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.\u201d I force a smile, even though her joke is more alarming than amusing. For the umpteenth time that day, I wonder what, exactly, I\u2019ve gotten myself into. \u201cYou settling in okay?\u201d Jessie asks. \u201cTrying to.\u201d I gesture to the suitcase on my bed and the box of books on the floor. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to unpack yet. Lenora\u2014Miss Hope\u2014kept me very busy today.\u201d \u201cYou can drop the whole Miss Hope act around me. It\u2019s only Mrs. Baker who cares about that.\u201d Jessie puts her hands behind her back and stands on her tiptoes. \u201cBut since you\u2019ve been busy, I guess you don\u2019t feel like getting a tour of the house now.\u201d \u201cMrs. Baker already showed me around.\u201d \u201cThis is an unofficial tour,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cThe murder tour. Mary did it for me when I first got here. She said it was good to know where everything went down that night. Who died where. That kind of thing.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you, but I think I\u2019m okay,\u201d I say, repelled by the idea. It\u2019s bad enough knowing what happened here. I don\u2019t need details. \u201cI was hoping to avoid those places.\u201d Jessie shrugs. \u201cFair enough. But how do you plan to avoid them when you don\u2019t know where they are?\u201d A very good point. For all I know, a member of the Hope family could have been murdered in this very room. But that\u2019s not the only reason I decide to take Jessie up on her offer. Between my father and Lenora, I\u2019ve spent so much time with people who can\u2019t\u2014or won\u2019t\u2014talk back that I\u2019ve forgotten how nice it feels to converse. Especially with someone under the age of sixty. \u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cYou can show me. And then I\u2019ll know to never enter those rooms again.\u201d \u201cImpossible,\u201d Jessie says with an impish grin. \u201cOne of them isn\u2019t a room.\u201d She sets off down the hall, going in the direction of the Grand Stairs. I follow, trying to keep quiet, even though Jessie\u2019s rattling jewelry makes her sound like a one-woman wind chime as we pass Lenora\u2019s room. Music drifts from behind the closed door of the room next to it. Something jazzy and old that takes me a moment to recognize: \u201cLet\u2019s Misbehave.\u201d Jessie lifts a finger to her lips and mouths, Mrs. Baker. I slow my steps, moving on tiptoes. Even Jessie quiets down, walking with her arms outstretched to keep her bracelets from clattering. She stays that way until we reach the top of the Grand Stairs. I head down one side; Jessie uses the other. \u201cHow do you like it here?\u201d she says when we meet again on the landing. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to take in.\u201d \u201cTotally,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not so bad. Have you met Carter yet?\u201d \u201cYeah. On my way in.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s, like, totally dreamy, right?\u201d \u201cI guess,\u201d I say, even though I\u2019m in agreement there. We stand in the shadow of the stained-glass window, its colors muted by the darkness outside. Directly beneath our feet, an unruly red splotch two shades darker than the surrounding carpet takes up most of the landing. Earlier today, I thought it was caused by light streaming through the stained glass. Standing on it now, though, I see it for what it is. A bloodstain. A big one. I leap away from it, onto one of the lower steps, where I find another, smaller stain. And another on the step below that. Hopping to the foyer floor, I stare up at Jessie and say, \u201cYou could have warned me.\u201d \u201cAnd miss that reaction? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d She descends the rest of the stairs, stepping on several more bloodstains in the red carpet and making me notice a pattern to the splotches. It looks like someone bleeding profusely had tried coming up the Grand Stairs before being stopped at the landing. \u201cEvangeline Hope,\u201d Jessie says, knowing exactly what I\u2019m thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s assumed she was stabbed in the foyer, tried to escape up the steps, and was stabbed again on the landing, where she bled out.\u201d I shudder and turn away, looking instead to the large front door leading to outside. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she try to leave?\u201d \u201cNo one knows,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot about that night that remains unknown.\u201d She starts moving down the hall on the right, the one that ends at the sunroom. We don\u2019t make it that far. At the halfway point, just past Lenora\u2019s portrait, Jessie stops at one of the hallway\u2019s many closed doors. She pushes it open and flicks a switch just inside. Light floods the room, coming from both a green-glass fixture on the ceiling and matching sconces on the walls. \u201cThe billiard room,\u201d she announces with an enthusiasm usually reserved for tour guides who really, really love their job. \u201cWhere Winston Hope met his end.\u201d My first thought is that yes, this feels very much like a room where a man of Mr. Hope\u2019s stature would die. The d\u00e9cor is brutish. Various antique firearms hang on the walls, along with the heads of animals that were probably killed by them. A lion. A bear. Several deer. A pair of matching leather armchairs sits atop a zebra pelt in front of a fireplace. On one wall is a rack of pool cues, although there\u2019s no pool table to be seen. The only sign it was ever here is a rectangular path in the middle of the room where the floor has been worn down by well-heeled soles. \u201cWhat happened to the pool table?\u201d \u201cWinston Hope died slumped over it,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cSince his throat was slit, I guess it was too bloody to salvage.\u201d I turn her way, startled. \u201cThe rhyme says he was stabbed.\u201d \u201cOh, he was,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cOnce in the side, before his throat was slit. I guess that was too complicated to make rhyme.\u201d \u201cHow do you know so much about all of this?\u201d \u201cMostly Mary,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cShe knows a lot about what happened that night. She\u2019s, like, totally obsessed with the murders. I think it\u2019s why she took the job, you know?\u201d I don\u2019t. Other than my father\u2019s house, this is the last place I want to be. \u201cWhy did you take a job here?\u201d I say. Jessie gives a jewelry-rattling shrug. \u201cThis place seemed as good as any. I needed to do something, right? Work is work and money is money.\u201d Now that\u2019s a sentiment I can get behind. I never thought I\u2019d be a caregiver, just like I\u2019m sure Jessie never thought she\u2019d be cleaning a murder mansion. But it\u2019s better than nothing, which is what I had before today. With nothing more to be explored in the billiard room, we leave. Jessie cuts the lights and closes the door before taking me to the one across the hall from it. \u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d \u201cA surprise,\u201d Jessie says as she flicks on the lights, revealing a library. I take in the floor-to-ceiling shelves, a leather sofa, and two matching armchairs scooted next to a marble fireplace. On the mantel are three cloisonn\u00e9 vases in a matching pattern of ivory flowers and twisting blue vines. Behind them looms a large rectangle of wallpaper darker than the surrounding area. \u201cDid there used to be a painting there?\u201d \u201cYep,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cAn original Winslow Homer, according to Archie. Mrs. Baker had to sell it years ago.\u201d I move to the mantel to get a better look at the vases. Hidden among the vines are tiny hummingbirds with little ruby dots for eyes. In the center of each ivory blossom is a circle of gold. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she sell these, too?\u201d \u201cThose are probably the last thing she\u2019d sell,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cIt might even be illegal. I think there are laws about selling dead people.\u201d I take a step away from the mantel, understanding my mistake. These aren\u2019t vases. They\u2019re urns. And inside are what remains of Winston, Evangeline, and Virginia Hope. \u201cWant to take a peek?\u201d Jessie says. \u201cDefinitely not. Have you?\u201d Jessie makes a face. \u201cNo way. It\u2019s bad enough I have to dust them once a week.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m surprised they weren\u2019t buried.\u201d \u201cI guess it was easier to cremate them,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cIt was more private. Kept the looky-loos away, at least. By then, Lenora probably knew everyone thought she did it.\u201d We\u2019re near the door now, having both unconsciously drifted away from the urns. Being near them unsettles me. The problem isn\u2019t what\u2019s inside the urns. That\u2019s just the dust and ash of three people. What bothers me is how those people died. Tragically. Violently. On the landing of an opulent staircase, sprawled across a pool table, and in a place I haven\u2019t seen yet but am sure Jessie will reveal next. To get it over with, I leave the library, with Jessie close behind. Back in the hallway, we pause at the portraits, three covered, one exposed. Although the hallway is dim, Lenora\u2019s green eyes still gleam from the canvas, as if it\u2019s been lit from the inside. \u201cWhy do you think she did it?\u201d I say. \u201cMaybe she didn\u2019t,\u201d Jessie says with a shrug. \u201cI have a hunch it was Winston Hope himself. The murders took place the night of October 29, 1929. Black Tuesday. The stock market crashed, a bunch of rich guys lost millions, and the Great Depression began. That\u2019s why not many people outside of Maine even know what happened here. Black Tuesday hijacked all the headlines. People were too worried about being poor to pay attention to Winston Hope and his dead family.\u201d I can\u2019t blame them. As someone who is poor, I understand how it can eclipse all other concerns. \u201cI think Winston Hope knew he was about to lose everything,\u201d Jessie continues. \u201cRather than live like the rest of us\u2014which, let\u2019s face it, totally sucks\u2014he decided to end things. He offed his wife, then Virginia, then\u2014\u201d She mimes dragging a knife across her throat. \u201cA good, old-fashioned murder-suicide.\u201d \u201cBut what about the stab wound in his side?\u201d I say, before an even more logical question appears. \u201cAnd why would he let Lenora live? And why wouldn\u2019t she tell the police the truth?\u201d \u201cAnd what happened to the knife?\u201d Jessie adds. \u201cWinston\u2019s throat was slashed and Evangeline was stabbed multiple times, yet no murder weapon was ever found.\u201d \u201cWhich means it had to be Lenora. She killed them and tossed the knife.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what most people seem to think.\u201d Jessie tilts her head, studying the portrait as if she\u2019s an art scholar. \u201cAnd this painting does make her look capable of murder, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cSo why wasn\u2019t she arrested and put on trial?\u201d \u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough evidence,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cThey dusted for fingerprints, but there were so many from every family member and servant that it was impossible to tell who was responsible. With the murder weapon missing, there was no way to prove Lenora was guilty.\u201d \u201cOr that she was innocent,\u201d I say, fully understanding the hypocrisy of my counterargument. Lack of evidence is the only reason I wasn\u2019t arrested and put on trial. \u201cTrue. Then there\u2019s the idea that maybe she lied to cover for someone else. Like him.\u201d Jessie points to a signature in the bottom righthand corner of the portrait. I lean in and read the name scrawled in white paint. \u201cPeter Ward?\u201d \u201cThe artist. That\u2019s Mary\u2019s wild guess. She\u2019s full of theories. Another one is that Hope\u2019s End is haunted. She claims to have seen the ghost of Virginia Hope roaming the second floor.\u201d The chill I\u2019d felt the first time I was in this hallway returns. Definitely not a draft. It\u2019s too cold, too unnatural. Even though I don\u2019t believe in ghosts, I can understand why Mary thought one haunted Hope\u2019s End. \u201cIs that why she left?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Jessie says, her voice going quiet. \u201cI think she was scared. Hope\u2019s End isn\u2019t a normal house. There\u2019s a darkness here. I can feel it. Mary did. And I think she couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d We head back down the hall, Jessie checking over her shoulder, as if something is lurking just behind us. At the Grand Stairs, I can\u2019t help but take another morbid peek at the bloodstains in the carpet. From there, we move through the other side of the house, stopping at the set of double doors before the hall makes a right toward the kitchen. \u201cThe ballroom,\u201d Jessie says solemnly before pushing open the doors. \u201cWhere Virginia Hope died.\u201d She turns on the lights, which include sconces set between large mirrors on the walls and three chandeliers that droop from the ceiling. They\u2019re enormous, with more than three dozen bulbs each. Half have burned out. Others buzz and flicker, giving the room a jittery feel. While Jessie roams freely, I remain on the edge of the parquet dance floor, knowing that wherever I step might be the spot where Virginia Hope\u2019s body once lay. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cVirginia died up there.\u201d She points to the chandelier in the center of the ballroom. It hangs lower than the others and at a slight angle, like the weight of Virginia\u2019s body partially tugged it from the ceiling. \u201cSo the rhyme was right about that.\u201d \u201cYup,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cHung her sister with a rope.\u201d I take a few cautious steps toward the center of the room to get a closer look at the chandelier. While it\u2019s low enough to possibly reach with a rope while standing on a chair, I can\u2019t picture a girl of seventeen doing it and then hoisting her sister high enough to hang her. It seems unlikely, if not impossible. Then again, none of these murders makes sense, including where they occurred. Three deaths in three different spots throughout the first floor. If it was Winston Hope, did he hang Virginia first, get caught in the act by his wife, and stab her at the Grand Stairs before going to the billiard room to kill himself? Or was he killed first\u2014by Lenora or someone else\u2014and did Evangeline find his body, run to the stairs covered in his blood, and bump into the killer on the landing? Without knowing who died first, it\u2019s impossible to tell. And none of it explains poor Virginia\u2019s fate or the missing knife. \u201cI wonder why Virginia was hanged when the others were killed with a knife,\u201d I say. \u201cYou and everyone else,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cI guess we could always ask.\u201d \u201cWe could. But Lenora can\u2019t answer. Even when she could, she didn\u2019t say much.\u201d \u201cI meant Virginia.\u201d Jessie nervously twists one of her bracelets around her wrist. \u201cWhat if Mary is right and Virginia really is haunting this place? If so, we could contact her spirit and ask what happened.\u201d \u201cIf only we had a Ouija board.\u201d I mean it as a joke. For one, I don\u2019t think Hope\u2019s End is haunted. Nor do I believe Ouija boards can contact the dead. But as soon as I say it, Jessie\u2019s eyes light up. \u201cI\u2019ll go get mine,\u201d she says. \u201cWait here. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Jessie scurries off, leaving me alone in the ballroom, my reflection caught in the many mirrors on the walls. It\u2019s dizzying seeing so many different versions of myself. Everywhere I turn, there I am. It makes me think of Virginia Hope swinging from the chandelier. A horrible way to go. Made worse by the fact that, if her eyes were open, she would have seen a dozen reflections of the life being strangled out of her. I pray she kept them shut. Above me, one of the bulbs in the chandelier Virginia hung from buzzes and brightens before going dark with an eerie, electric pop. While I\u2019m certain the cause is ancient wiring and a bulb that likely hasn\u2019t been replaced since 1929, I take it as a sign to leave the ballroom. But as soon as I\u2019m about to exit, Jessie enters, carrying a battered Ouija board. Atop it sits a wood planchette that slides around the board as Jessie moves, as if it\u2019s being moved by invisible hands. \u201cAren\u2019t we a little old for this?\u201d I say. \u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d Jessie places the Ouija board in the center of the ballroom. \u201cI\u2019m young and stupid. At least, that\u2019s what Mrs. Baker says. Now join me or I\u2019ll tell everyone you\u2019re a scaredy-cat.\u201d I do, more for Jessie\u2019s benefit than mine. It must be hard being so young yet living and working in this big, old house. I suspect this whole tour was the result of her feeling lonely and wanting to make a new friend. I want that, too. My circle of friends had shrunk to the size of a dot before my mother died. After her funeral, I found myself with none at all. We place our fingers on the planchette, and Jessie says, \u201cIs there a spirit present?\u201d \u201cThis is silly,\u201d I say. \u201cShush.\u201d Jessie stares at the planchette. \u201cI feel something.\u201d \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI said shush. Don\u2019t you feel it?\u201d At first, I don\u2019t. But soon the planchette begins to slide toward the word printed in the upper-left-hand corner of the board. yes Jessie gasps with delight. I roll my eyes. She\u2019s obviously guided us to the word. \u201cSpirit, is there something you want to communicate to us?\u201d Jessie says. Once again, the planchette moves, slowly circling the same word. yes It continues to circle, even though the pads of my fingers are barely touching the planchette. Which means it\u2019s still Jessie\u2019s doing. \u201cSpirit,\u201d she says, \u201cplease identify yourself.\u201d The planchette slowly slides to the center of the board and the two arched rows of letters printed across it. Unsurprisingly, it comes to a stop near the end of the second row. v Next, it slides to the letter directly above it. i The planchette then glides back down to the second row and the inevitable next letter. r \u201cQuit pretending you\u2019re not moving it,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Jessie whispers back. To the empty room, she says, \u201cSpirit, are you Virginia Hope?\u201d The planchette again moves to the upper-left corner of the board. Faster, this time. A sudden, startling jerk. yes Jessie looks at me from across the board. There\u2019s surprise in her eyes\u2014and just a touch of fear. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t me,\u201d she says. It had to be. I certainly didn\u2019t do it. My touch on the planchette is so light it barely exists. But when I look down, I see that Jessie\u2019s fingertips are also barely touching it. Yet the planchette still moves, sliding back and forth beneath the word yes as if trying to underline it. Jessie gulps and looks to the chandelier directly above us, as if Virginia Hope is still hanging there. \u201cVirginia, did your sister murder you?\u201d The planchette rockets to the other side of the board, zooming directly onto the word in the upper-right-hand corner. no The planchette keeps jerking forward, its tapered point stabbing at the word. Then it flies off the board entirely before skittering across the floor. I jerk my hand away from the Ouija board as Jessie lets out a shocked cry. \u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d \u201cBut I didn\u2019t do it! I was barely touching it! It had to\u2014\u201d Jessie\u2019s mouth drops open and her eyes go wide, startled by something behind me. I whirl around to face the mirrored wall at my back, expecting to see\u2014well, I don\u2019t know. What I do see is my alarmed reflection and, just over my shoulder, Jessie breaking into a wide grin she tries to hide by slapping a hand over her mouth. \u201cNot cool,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jessie says, laughing openly now. \u201cBut you should have seen the look on your face. I, like, totally got you.\u201d I stand and brush dust from the skirt of my uniform. \u201cSo what you said about Mary thinking this place is haunted is\u2014\u201d \u201cTotally made-up,\u201d Jessie admits as she picks up the Ouija board and retrieves the planchette. \u201cI was just messing with you.\u201d \u201cThen why did Mary really leave?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jessie turns off the lights and leaves the ballroom. I follow, closing the doors behind me. \u201cOne day, she was just . . . gone.\u201d \u201cWeren\u2019t the two of you close?\u201d \u201cI thought we were,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cClose enough for her to tell me she was leaving, at least.\u201d \u201cAnd no one else knows why she left?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d We\u2019re in the kitchen now, Jessie heading to the service stairs and me leaning against the center counter. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried about her?\u201d \u201cA little,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cBut Mary\u2019s smart. And normally super responsible. I know she wouldn\u2019t leave like that without a good reason.\u201d \u201cDo you think Lenora had something to do with it?\u201d \u201cLike Mary was scared of her?\u201d Jessie shakes her head. \u201cNo way. She adored Lenora. I think she left because of a family emergency or something. Her parents live in the next county. One of them probably got sick and she had to leave, like, immediately. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll reach out and tell me what happened when she gets the chance.\u201d I hope that\u2019s true, for Jessie\u2019s sake. But I know from personal experience it doesn\u2019t work that way. When I left a patient to care for my mother, a replacement for me needed to be arranged. I didn\u2019t just leave in the middle of the night like Mary did. \u201cI should get back to my room,\u201d Jessie says with a tiny yawn. \u201cI\u2019m about to start recording a new book for Lenora. Lace by Shirley Conran.\u201d \u201cI read it,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s good. Racy.\u201d \u201cAwesome. Lenora loves racy.\u201d I wish her goodnight and stand for a moment in the vast, empty kitchen. I run my gaze along the walls, trying to estimate its size, which might be larger than my father\u2019s entire house. This fact would have impressed the hell out of my mother. Not so much my father, who hates the rich almost as much as he hates politicians. I touch the telephone, which is so old it could be in a museum. But it still works. Lifting the receiver from its cradle, I hear the steady buzz of a dial tone. Quickly, I dial my father\u2019s number, rationalizing it by telling myself he\u2019ll at least want to know where I am. According to the kitchen\u2019s equally ancient clock, it\u2019s just past ten o\u2019clock, so I assume he\u2019s still awake. Sure enough, he answers after three rings. \u201cHello?\u201d I say nothing, the urge to speak fleeing at the sound of his voice. In the background, I hear a woman talking. It might be the TV. Or it could be his new girlfriend, allowed to stay the night now that I\u2019m not there. \u201cHello?\u201d he says again. \u201cWho is this?\u201d I hang up and back away from the phone, worried he\u2019s certain it was me and will now try calling back. An impossibility. He doesn\u2019t know where I am or the phone number for Hope\u2019s End. And since he didn\u2019t want to talk to me while I lived with him, I see no reason why he would now that I\u2019m gone. The only thing I\u2019m certain about as I head upstairs is that at least now my father knows how it feels to be met with silence. \n TEN Just like when Mrs. Baker first led me to it, my bedroom door seemingly moves on its own. One touch of the handle is all it takes to send it swinging open with a pronounced creak. Inside, the room glows red. An uneven, pulsing light coats the walls and makes the bedroom look nightmarish. With each flash of red comes an insistent buzzing sound. Lenora\u2019s call button. She needs me. I push into the room, my eyes stinging from the pulsing red light on the nightstand. I trip over the box of books sitting in the middle of the floor, sending it toppling. Paperbacks spill around my ankles as I keep moving. To the adjoining door. Into Lenora\u2019s room. To her bed, where she lies with her left hand clenched around the call button. Her eyes are open wide and wild. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I say, too worried to think about the fact that she can\u2019t answer me. Anything could be wrong. Another stroke. A heart attack. Seizure or sickness or impending death. When she sees me, Lenora\u2019s grip on the call button loosens. She sighs, looking childlike and embarrassed, and I think I understand what happened. \u201cDid you have a nightmare?\u201d Lenora, still holding the call button, uses it to tap twice against the bedspread. \u201cMust have been a real humdinger,\u201d I say, which is what my mother called especially nasty nightmares. The kind that linger after you wake. The kind that make you afraid to close your eyes again. \u201cDo you want me to stay here until you fall back asleep?\u201d Two more taps. When I was little and had a real humdinger of a nightmare, my mother would crawl into my bed and wrap her arms around me, which is what I do now with Lenora. She looks so rattled\u2014still so utterly scared\u2014that it feels wrong not to. \u201cNightmares are just your brain thinking it\u2019s Halloween,\u201d I tell her. Something else my mother said. \u201cAll trick, no treat.\u201d Lenora\u2019s left hand finds my right one and clasps my fingers. The gesture, despite being tender, almost desperate, leaves me reeling. Lenora Hope, my town\u2019s version of the bogeyman and the woman whose guilt kids to this very day chant about, is holding my hand. Part of me wants to recoil from her touch. Another part of me feels terrible about that. No matter what she did in the past\u2014which, let\u2019s be clear, was very, very bad\u2014Lenora\u2019s still a human being who deserves to be treated like one. If she even did all the things she\u2019s accused of. The same thought I had in the ballroom occurs to me now: Would a seventeen-year-old girl even be capable of killing three people like that? These were physical crimes. Slitting her father\u2019s throat. Stabbing her mother. Tying a noose around her sister\u2019s neck and hoisting her to her death. I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it, which makes it hard for me to believe someone half my age could. Maybe Jessie\u2019s theory is right and it was Winston Hope or someone else. If so, Lenora has paid a terrible price. No, she never went to jail. But she\u2019s been imprisoned for decades. In her own home. In her childhood bedroom. In a body that refuses to function. Then again, if what everyone has said is true, then it means I\u2019m embracing a murderer. One whose care and well-being I\u2019m responsible for. I\u2019m not sure which scenario is worse. I\u2019m also not sure I can continue to work here without knowing the truth. Maybe that\u2019s what made Mary leave without warning. She could no longer take the not-knowing. \u201cLenora,\u201d I whisper. \u201cDid you really do it?\u201d She releases my hand, and I hold my breath, preparing for the answer about to be tapped against the bedspread. To my surprise, Lenora doesn\u2019t tap. Instead, I get a nod toward the typewriter on the other side of the room. \u201cYou want to type?\u201d Lenora taps twice against my hand. \u201cRight now?\u201d Two more taps. More urgent this time. Because it seems easier to bring the typewriter to Lenora instead of the other way around, I carry it across the room in an awkward waddle and plop it down on the edge of the mattress. Then I climb back into bed and prop up Lenora against me so she can easily access the keyboard. All that effort leaves me perspiring. This better be worth it. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d I say as I place her left hand on the keys. Lenora knits her brows, thinking. Then she types four words before nodding, signaling for me to hit the return bar. i wont hurt you My pulse quickens as I read the sentence. \u201cI appreciate that,\u201d I say, not sure how else to reply. How did Lenora know I wanted to hear this? Are my emotions as easily read as hers? Lenora resumes typing. i suppose youve heard the song about me \u201cThe rhyme?\u201d I say, surprised she knows of its existence. It must be horrible having her life\u2014and her family\u2019s deaths\u2014reduced to a childish chant. \u201cI have. It\u2019s . . . cruel.\u201d i find it amusing Another surprise. \u201cYou do?\u201d all that effort for little old me \u201cIs it true?\u201d you can find out Curiosity tugs at me. As does fear and a healthy dose of uncertainty. \u201cHow?\u201d i want to tell you everything \u201cEverything? What does that mean?\u201d things ive never told anyone else \u201cAbout the murders?\u201d I say, surprised I can hear myself over the sound of my heartbeat pounding like a drum in my ears. yes about that night I look at Lenora. The dim light of the room somehow makes her green eyes brighter. They glint fiercely now. Emeralds lit from within, holding me hostage in their gaze. My God, she\u2019s serious. \u201cWhy me? Why now?\u201d because i trust you \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Lenora\u2019s hand slides from the typewriter and drops to the mattress. Her body language is crystal clear. She\u2019s sure. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I say as I carry the typewriter back to the desk. By the time I return to the bed, Lenora is asleep. I can tell by her breathing\u2014a deep, steady rhythm. I switch off the lamp and place the call button next to her left hand before tiptoeing away. Back in my room, I finally ditch the nurse\u2019s uniform. Taking it off feels like removing armor. I feel freer, yes, but also oddly vulnerable. Gone is the sense of purpose I\u2019d felt when I first put it on. Now I\u2019m back to being aimless, slump-shouldered me. After putting on a nightgown and fuzzy socks, I press a hand to my heart. It\u2019s still galloping. This time, I know exactly why. After decades of silence, Lenora Hope wants to tell all. And I need to decide if I want to hear it. Part of me thinks, obviously, yes. This place, with its murderous past, mind-messing tilt, and general dourness, is already a lot to deal with. I suspect it would be easier if I knew what happened that night\u2014and Lenora\u2019s role in it. Especially because I\u2019m the one who\u2019ll be spending the most time with her. The one tasked with feeding her, bathing her, dressing her, keeping her alive. At the very least there\u2019d be no more wondering, no more suspicion. Then again, not knowing provides at least a sliver of optimism. If Lenora confesses to killing her family, that will be gone. I\u2019m still weighing my options as I start to unpack, beginning with the books I\u2019d abandoned when Jessie showed up at my door. I grab a handful and take them to the bookshelf, which is already filled with paperbacks, leaving no room for my own. I grab one\u2014Eye of the Needle by Ken Follett\u2014and open it. Inside the front cover, written in ballpoint pen, is a message. This book is the property of Mary Milton Those same words are in the next book I pick up, a battered copy of John Irving\u2019s The Hotel New Hampshire. While it seems odd that Mary left so many books behind, I also understand. Books aren\u2019t easy to move\u2014and maybe Mary thought whoever replaced her would enjoy them. Things start to make less sense when I abandon the books and try to unpack my clothes. The dresser\u2019s top drawer is filled with pristine nurse\u2019s uniforms exactly like my own. While I totally get why Mary left those behind\u2014I would have done the same thing\u2014more of her clothes fill the other drawers. Not just uniforms, but slacks, blouses, and underwear. I assume they belong to Mary because some of the tags bear initials written in Magic Marker. MM Sorting through the clothes, I see a pair of Jordache jeans, a pink Lacoste polo shirt, a striped blouse with the price tag still attached. Sears. Twelve dollars. All of it looks to be new and in good condition\u2014far nicer than my own clothes. In the closet, I find a wool coat drooping from a hanger. And boots on the floor below it. And an empty cardboard box bearing a word again written in Magic Marker: Books. Beside it, surrounded by a thin coating of dust, is a narrow rectangle of clean floor where something else used to sit. What it was, I have no idea. Another box, presumably. Now gone. On the closet shelf is a medical bag similar in shape and size to the one my parents gave me. I pull it down and peek inside, seeing most of the same items I keep in mine, arranged in an orderly manner. Its presence makes no sense. If there had been a family emergency, as Jessie suspects, Mary surely would have spent a minute grabbing her medical bag and at least some of her clothes. Instead, she left almost everything behind. I give up trying to unpack. It\u2019s late, I\u2019m tired, and there\u2019s no place to put any of my belongings. As I turn out the lights and climb into bed, two thoughts hit me in quick succession\u2014a fact and a question. The fact: Mary left in a hurry. The question: What drove her away? \n After putting the snow globe in my room, I crept downstairs, hoping to gorge myself on leftover birthday cake. But there was no cake to be found. Only Berniece Mayhew, who looked none too pleased to be washing dishes at that late hour. \u201cHappy birthday, Miss Hope,\u201d she muttered when she saw me, not a drop of happiness in her tone. On my way down the hall, I noticed that the door to the billiard room was ajar. Maybe some of the servants were playing, which they sometimes did behind my father\u2019s back. Usually, they let me join in, much to Miss Baker\u2019s alarm. \u201cLadies shouldn\u2019t play pool,\u201d she once told me. \u201cLucky for me I\u2019m not a lady,\u201d I replied. I paused at the door and peeked into the room. Indeed, there was a servant inside. I couldn\u2019t see who it was because she was spread facedown against the billiard table, her skirt pushed up to her waist. Behind her was my father, his trousers around his ankles and his face turning crimson as he thrust into her. I gasped. Loud enough for them to hear. My father looked to the door as I scrambled away. But it was too late. I\u2019d been caught. I ran anyway, down the hall, past the portraits of my family that Peter had painted earlier. Their faces stared at me, as if I was the one who\u2019d done something wrong. I ran to the other side of the house and slipped into the ballroom. There, I collapsed onto the floor, my mind a jumble of thoughts, many of them wicked. I wondered how many other servants my father had screwed, in how many different rooms. I wondered who this one was, and if she was taking pleasure in it or if my father had forced himself on her. I wondered if Peter at that very moment wanted to be doing the same thing to my sister. Mostly, I wondered if anyone would ever want me in that way. My father soon appeared in the doorway, casting a long shadow across the ballroom floor. For a moment, I thought he was about to confess his misdeeds, apologize, promise to do whatever he could to atone for them. If he did that, maybe my mother would feel fit enough to leave her bedroom. Maybe my sister and I wouldn\u2019t be treated like prisoners. Maybe there could be some happiness again in this godforsaken house. Instead, my father joined me on the floor and wiped away the tears that had started falling down my cheeks. It was, I realized, the first time he had touched me in months. \u201cHush, my darling,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t worth getting upset about.\u201d \u201cWho was that?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d It did to me. By then, I\u2019d known about the rumors that my father liked to seduce the servants. Berniece whispered about it so much I couldn\u2019t help but hear. But I wanted to know who it was and why my father did it. \u201cDon\u2019t you love Mother?\u201d I said, trying hard to halt my tears. \u201cI do,\u201d my father said. \u201cIn a very complicated way. Do you love her?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d \u201cThen it\u2019s best not to tell her about this. It would kill her. And you wouldn\u2019t want that, would you?\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d I replied, my eyes downcast because I couldn\u2019t stand to look at him. He chucked my chin like I was a baby. Or, worse, a dog. \u201cThat\u2019s my good girl.\u201d As my father turned and left the ballroom, I almost called out that he was the parent I wanted dead. After all, he deserved it. I didn\u2019t because I felt the need to behave like the good girl he expected me to be. But here\u2019s the thing--I wasn\u2019t a good girl. Not in the least. You\u2019ll see for yourself very soon. \n ELEVEN Sleep doesn\u2019t come easy. Granted, I never sleep well the first few nights with a new patient. Different room. Different bed, some more comfortable than others. Different house, with all its unique nocturnal sounds. At Hope\u2019s End, the dominant night noises are the ocean and the wind\u2014a discordant duet that keeps me awake. The waves are low and steady, crashing into the cliff below with a rhythm that would be soothing if not for the wind, which hits the house in irregular gusts. Each blow rattles the windows and shimmies the walls, which in turn creak and groan, reminding me where I am. A mansion teetering on the edge of the ocean. Inside of which is a woman most people assume murdered her family. A woman who has now offered to tell me everything. The pattern repeats itself. Thinking about Lenora, being lulled to sleep by the waves, then startled awake by the wind. Every time it hits, I grip the edge of the mattress, certain I can feel the house leaning toward the sea. But then the wind calms, my thoughts roll, the waves continue, and the whole process starts anew. This goes on until I hear another noise. Not the wind. Not the waves. It sounds like a floorboard, emitting the faintest of creaks. I sit up and scan the room, looking for\u2014well, I don\u2019t know what to expect. An intruder? A burglar? The mansion beginning its inevitable slide into the Atlantic? But there\u2019s nothing to see. I\u2019m the only person in the room, making me conclude it was just the wind causing Hope\u2019s End to creak in a way I hadn\u2019t yet heard. I crawl out of bed, crack open the door to my room, and peer into the hallway. Right now, it\u2019s empty. Knowing I could have just missed someone passing by, I step into the hall and listen for the sound of departing footsteps or a door closing. \u201cHello?\u201d I say, my voice hushed. \u201cIs someone out here?\u201d No one answers. Not another sound is heard. Until I return to my bedroom. When the creaking resumes, I realize exactly where it\u2019s coming from. Lenora\u2019s room. I press my ear to the door between our rooms, listening for signs of movement. Again, there\u2019s nothing. Just nocturnal silence and a sliver of moonlight from Lenora\u2019s room slipping through the crack between the door and the floor. The noise sounds again. This time, I open the door and peek inside. There\u2019s no one else there. Just Lenora, exactly how I left her\u2014in bed, flat on her back, hands at her sides, the left one beside the call button. The low, slow sound of her breathing tells me she\u2019s still asleep. As for what caused those creaks, I have no idea. It certainly wasn\u2019t Lenora. I close the adjoining door and crawl back into bed, where the waves and the wind resume vying for my attention. When I finally fall asleep, I have a nightmare. A real humdinger. I\u2019m a girl again, on the metal slide at my elementary school playground. The one I never liked because it got too cold in the winter and scalding hot in the summer. Around me, a group of kids\u2014unseen but unnervingly heard\u2014chant in unison. At seventeen, Lenora Hope I remain on the slide, not stuck exactly, but not going fast, either. Instead, I inch down it as the chanting continues. Hung her sister with a rope At the bottom of the slide stands my mother, looking the way she did not when I was young but in the final days of her life. A teetering pile of skin and bones in a powder-blue nightgown. Stabbed her father with a knife My mother pleads with me, only I can\u2019t hear what she\u2019s saying. Whenever she opens her mouth, instead of words, all I hear is the clack of typewriter keys. Took her mother\u2019s happy life Still, I know what she\u2019s saying, almost as if the words are being typed across a blank page. Please, Kit-Kat. Please. I\u2019ll only take one. I promise. \n TWELVE I was wrong about the sunrise. It doesn\u2019t peek over the horizon. It stares. I sit up, squinting at the yellow-orange light blasting through the window. As I do, I notice something strange. Everything on the bed\u2014mattress, blankets, me\u2014is slightly bunched at the bottom of it. Because of the house\u2019s tilt, we\u2019ve all slid a few inches lower during the night. That at least explains the inching-down-a-slide feeling from my nightmare. I sway when I get out of bed, as if the floor has sloped a few degrees more overnight. Which, for all I know, it could have. In the shower, I notice the water is slightly higher on one side of the tub than the other as it rushes toward the drain. The same happens in the sink as I brush my teeth. Watching the pooled water gurgle down the drain, I wonder if this is why Mary left. She couldn\u2019t spend another minute inside this crooked house. After dressing in one of Mary\u2019s abandoned uniforms, I go to the adjoining door to check on Lenora. I pause before opening it, remembering the creaks I\u2019d heard during the night. I can\u2019t think of anything that would have caused them except a person walking around inside that room. But no one else had been there. Just Lenora. I crack open the door and peek in, finding her still asleep and in the same position as when I last saw her. Which of course she\u2019d be. Lenora can\u2019t move anything but her left arm without assistance. To think otherwise is ridiculous\u2014and paranoid. Careful not to wake her, I quietly close the adjoining door before slipping out of my room and going downstairs. Halfway down the service stairs, I notice a crack in the wall that I\u2019m almost certain wasn\u2019t there last night. About four feet long and as jagged as a lightning bolt, it\u2019s impossible to miss. Either I did just that all day yesterday\u2014or it appeared overnight. I think of last night\u2019s wind and how it seemed to jostle the entire house. My mind turns, wondering if that\u2019s what caused the crack. And if there are more just like it now scattered about Hope\u2019s End. And, if a few wind gusts can do all that, how much damage an actual storm would cause. The thought sends me rushing down the remaining steps, eager to be on solid ground. Well, as solid as ground can be atop a cliff that\u2019s being eaten away by the ocean. In the kitchen, I find Archie at the stove, looking like he\u2019s been cooking for hours, even though it\u2019s barely past seven. A stack of pancakes sits atop a platter on the counter, along with a plate full of bacon and a basket of fresh-baked blueberry muffins. \u201cNice to see a fellow early riser,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s Tuesday,\u201d Archie says. \u201cDelivery day. All the groceries for the week arrive bright and early every Tuesday.\u201d He gestures to the food on the counter. \u201cHelp yourself, by the way. There\u2019s fresh coffee, too.\u201d I make a beeline toward the coffee and pour myself a mug. The scent alone perks me up. I take the mug to the counter and down half the coffee in three huge gulps. Archie notices and says, \u201cRough night?\u201d \u201cI had trouble sleeping.\u201d \u201cDoesn\u2019t surprise me. New place and all that. Probably didn\u2019t help that the wind was wicked last night.\u201d At the stove, Archie measures out some Quaker Oats from a cardboard cylinder and dumps them into a pot of boiling water. \u201cWe always get a few gusts, being up here on the bluff with nothing to protect us. But last night was something else.\u201d That doesn\u2019t explain what else I heard during the night. I know what wind sounds like. And it doesn\u2019t sound like footsteps. I think again of Mary. Had she heard them, too? Could that be the reason she left so suddenly? \u201cDid Miss Hope\u2019s previous nurse ever mention hearing things or having trouble sleeping?\u201d \u201cMary? Not that I can recall.\u201d I reach for a muffin on the counter and start peeling away the liner. \u201cHow well did you know her?\u201d \u201cWell enough, I guess. Nice girl. Seemed to be great with Miss Hope,\u201d Archie says, proving Jessie wrong about only Mrs. Baker not calling Lenora by her first name. \u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019m a fan of the way Mary left, though. I understand this place isn\u2019t for everyone. But you don\u2019t just leave in the middle of the night.\u201d \u201cThere were no signs anything was wrong?\u201d \u201cNot that I saw.\u201d \u201cSo she had no problems with Miss Hope?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d \u201cAnd Mary never mentioned being nervous around her?\u201d Archie, stirring the oatmeal now bubbling on the stove, turns my way. \u201cAre you nervous around Miss Hope?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I say, aware the reply is too fast, too emphatic. To cover, I take a bite of muffin. It\u2019s so delicious that I already know I\u2019m going to be eating a second one, with maybe a third to snack on later. \u201cIt\u2019s good, right?\u201d Archie says. \u201cI coat the blueberries in flour. Keeps them from sinking to the bottom.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019d you learn to cook like this?\u201d \u201cHere,\u201d he says, turning back to the pot. \u201cI pretty much grew up in this kitchen. Started as a dishwasher when I was fourteen. By eighteen, I was the sous chef.\u201d \u201cHow long have you worked here?\u201d \u201cAlmost sixty years.\u201d I pause, the muffin top in my hand lifted halfway to my mouth. \u201cSo you were here in 1929?\u201d \u201cI was. Me and Mrs. Baker are the only two left from the good old days.\u201d \u201cWere you here the night of\u2014\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Archie says, also too fast and emphatic. \u201cNone of the help was here that night. Including Mrs. Baker. She\u2019d left Mr. Hope\u2019s employ earlier that day.\u201d An interesting tidbit. Especially since Mrs. Baker mentioned yesterday how she\u2019d left Hope\u2019s End after the murders. I take another bite of muffin, mostly to cover the fact that my head is spinning with more questions. \u201cYou must like it here,\u201d I say after swallowing. \u201cOr Miss Hope likes you. I heard most of the staff was let go.\u201d \u201cA lot, yeah. The rest quit immediately after . . .\u201d Archie lets the rest of the sentence remain unspoken. Not that it needs to be said. I get the gist. Most of the staff would rather quit than continue working for a murderer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have brought it up,\u201d I say. \u201cI was just surprised you\u2019ve known Miss Hope all this time.\u201d \u201cSince we were kids.\u201d Archie\u2019s voice has returned to its usual warmth. A relief. The man preparing my meals is the last person I want to piss off. \u201cGrowing up, Miss Hope and I were quite close.\u201d \u201cAre the two of you still close?\u201d \u201cNot like we used to be,\u201d Archie says as his broad back stiffens and the hand stirring the pot goes still. \u201cThings changed.\u201d What he doesn\u2019t say\u2014but what I infer\u2014is that one thing changed. Namely, the murders of the rest of the Hope family. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to come up and see her,\u201d I say. \u201cI think she\u2019s lonely.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here,\u201d Archie says, once again all coldness as he ladles oatmeal into a bowl placed atop a wooden serving tray. He sets the tray in front of me and says, \u201cMiss Hope\u2019s breakfast. You should bring it up to her before it gets cold.\u201d I get the hint, even before Archie turns back to the stove. There\u2019ll be no more talk about Lenora today. Or maybe ever. \u201cThanks for breakfast,\u201d I say before placing my coffee and another muffin atop the tray and carrying it up the service stairs. At the halfway point, I\u2019m met by Mrs. Baker on her way down. She\u2019s dressed the same as yesterday: black dress, pale skin, red lips, glasses she lifts to her face to inspect my appearance. \u201cGood morning, Kit. I hope your first night here was pleasant.\u201d \u201cIt was,\u201d I lie. \u201cThank you for asking.\u201d My gaze flicks to the jagged crack in the wall, wondering if Mrs. Baker\u2019s noticed it yet. Surely she has. It\u2019s very noticeable. Yet she acts as if nothing is wrong. \u201cAnd you\u2019re finding your new quarters satisfactory?\u201d \u201cVery. Although I do have a question about Mary\u2019s things.\u201d \u201cThings?\u201d Mrs. Baker says with a schoolmarmish head cock. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to be more specific, dear.\u201d \u201cHer belongings. Everything\u2019s still in my room.\u201d \u201cEverything?\u201d \u201cHer books, her clothes, even her medical bag,\u201d I say. As I\u2019m talking, a thought pops into my head. \u201cIs it possible she plans on coming back?\u201d The notion should have occurred to me sooner. It makes more sense than anything else about why she left everything behind. It could be that Mary really was called away\u2014by her family or some other pressing matter\u2014and has every intention of returning. \u201cIf Mary were to return, she wouldn\u2019t be welcomed back,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cNot after leaving Miss Hope all alone like that.\u201d I let out a little huff of relief. At least I still have a job. \u201cBut she could come back for her stuff, right?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been a week,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cIf she wanted any of it, she would have done that by now.\u201d \u201cSo what should I do with it?\u201d \u201cJust hold on to everything, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Mrs. Baker says, though in fact I do mind. This is literally a mansion, with dozens of empty rooms. Surely there\u2019s somewhere else to store it all. \u201cI\u2019ll decide what to do with it all later.\u201d She acts as if that settles the matter, when in fact it doesn\u2019t. She resumes her descent, forcing me to call after her. \u201cI have another question, actually.\u201d I pause, waiting for her to stop, which she does with obvious reluctance after taking three more steps. \u201cWere you in Miss Hope\u2019s room last night?\u201d \u201cNow that you\u2019re here, I have no cause to enter Miss Hope\u2019s quarters.\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s a no,\u201d I say. \u201cYes, dear. A definite no.\u201d \u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d I look down at the tray, stalling. \u201cI thought I heard someone walking around in there last night.\u201d \u201cWalking?\u201d Mrs. Baker couldn\u2019t look more incredulous if I had mentioned aliens or Santa Claus. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d \u201cBut I heard the floorboards creaking.\u201d \u201cDid you investigate?\u201d \u201cYes. I didn\u2019t see anyone.\u201d \u201cThen perhaps it was your imagination,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cOr the wind. Sometimes, when it hits the house just so, it makes all sorts of noise.\u201d \u201cDoes anyone else go into Miss Hope\u2019s room on a regular basis? Like Archie? Or Jessie?\u201d \u201cThe only person who\u2019s supposed to frequent Miss Hope\u2019s quarters is you,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cSo I suggest you get back there before she wakes.\u201d \u201cYes, Mrs. Baker,\u201d I say, feeling the urge to curtsy the same way Jessie did yesterday. I\u2019d probably do it, too, if not for the tray in my hands. \u201cSorry to have bothered you.\u201d I head into Lenora\u2019s room, finding her awake in a triangle of morning sun that gives her a disconcertingly angelic glow. Rather than squint like I did, Lenora appears to luxuriate in the light. She has her head tilted back, mouth slightly open, from which escapes a contented sigh. The patch of sunlight slowly moves across Lenora\u2019s bed as I prop her into a sitting position and feed her oatmeal with her morning pills crushed in. By the time I get her cleaned, changed, and through her circulation exercises, the sunlight\u2019s slid off the mattress and onto the floor in a tidy rectangle. Lenora eyes it from her wheelchair as I check her vitals and make sure the bruise on her forearm continues to heal. When that\u2019s over, her gaze slips to the typewriter. She remembers last night. Part of me thought she\u2019d forgotten. A bigger part of me wishes she had. Because whatever she intends to type, I still haven\u2019t decided if I want to see it. Lenora\u2019s mind, though, is made up. She moves her gaze from the typewriter to me, giving me a look that\u2019s half anxious, half hopeful. One without the other probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to sway me. But the combination of the two makes me realize this has nothing to do with what I want. It\u2019s what Lenora wants. And right now, she wants to type. I still have no idea why. I can\u2019t think of any reason she\u2019d wait so long to talk about that night. If she was innocent, she would have told her story decades ago. Unless she thought no one would believe her. Yesterday, Mrs. Baker told me Hope\u2019s End was a place where young women are given the benefit of the doubt. That\u2019s not true everywhere. It\u2019s true hardly anywhere. Perhaps Lenora tried to tell her story all those years ago and no one believed her. Or, worse, no one even listened. Maybe she thinks I will. And that I\u2019ll believe she\u2019s innocent. Because she thinks the same of me. That idea\u2014that Lenora\u2019s urge to talk stems not from shared guilt but possibly shared innocence\u2014is ultimately why I wheel her to the desk, where the page from last night sits next to the typewriter. Even though I don\u2019t remember removing it, I must have. I wrack my brain, trying to recall the events of last night. Lenora offering to tell me everything. Finding Mary\u2019s belongings. The wind and the waves and the creaking floorboards. The more I think about it, the more convinced I am that I left that page in the typewriter. \u201cLenora, was someone in here last night?\u201d She responds with a single-tap no against the wheelchair armrest. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Two taps. I stare at Lenora. She stares back, looking utterly guileless. If she\u2019s lying\u2014and I see no reason why she would be\u2014she hides it well. And even though I\u2019m close to certain I didn\u2019t move that page, I\u2019m also aware someone else could have done it while Lenora was asleep. Mrs. Baker slipping in to do some snooping, for instance. Or Jessie coming in bright and early to tidy up. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I say, because it truly doesn\u2019t. What matters is that Lenora is about to reveal all. And my job is to help her do it. In a desk drawer, I find a partial ream of paper and insert a new page into the carriage. I then place Lenora\u2019s left hand on the typewriter, wondering if this is the start of something wonderful or something I\u2019ll regret. Or if it will end up being anything at all. Lenora\u2019s fingers twitch atop the keys, almost as if she\u2019s unable to keep them still any longer. I inhale, exhale, nod. Then we begin. \n THIRTEEN The thing I remember most--the thing I still have nightmares about--is when it was all but over. That\u2019s what Lenora typed first, hours ago, when the sun was still rising over the Atlantic. The full sentence took me by surprise. Until then, she\u2019d only typed fragments, ignoring rules of capitalization and punctuation. It took a few confused seconds from me and a few exasperated taps from her before I realized she wanted me to press the shift key while she typed that first capital T. It took even longer for us to settle into some semblance of a rhythm. We got there eventually, though. And that\u2019s where we remain, even though the sun has left the sky and the murky light of dusk now settles over the ocean outside. Lenora uses her good hand to brush against mine, a signal she needs me to press the shift key. When the typewriter dings, I hit the return bar, bringing the carriage back to a new line. She types some more and nods, the sign I\u2019m to nudge it again and start a new paragraph. We keep the door closed so no one will bother us. Lenora insisted, although I don\u2019t know why. Other than Archie, who delivered lunch with a terse rap on the door, I haven\u2019t heard anyone moving about the second floor. And while it feels as if Lenora is an afterthought in her own estate, it might be because I\u2019m now here. Her caregiver. A role I try to continue while doubling as a secretary. After each page, I massage Lenora\u2019s left hand, make her take a sip of water through a straw, and ask if she wants to continue. The answer is always two eager taps against the typewriter. There\u2019s an unmistakable zeal to her typing. She rarely pauses to think about what she\u2019s going to write. The story simply crashes onto the page, as if Lenora had written it all in her head years ago and is just now setting it free. What that story is, I still don\u2019t know. Between responding to Lenora\u2019s signals, constantly tapping the return bar, and removing and inserting pages into the typewriter, I haven\u2019t had much opportunity to see what she\u2019s writing. Lenora brushes my hand, and I press the shift key. Two more presses and two nods later, she finally lays her hand flat against the keys\u2014her signal that another chapter is finished. I pluck the page from the typewriter and place it facedown atop the sixteen others we\u2019ve typed today. A staggering amount. Yet if Lenora\u2019s tired, she shows no sign of it. She gives me an expectant look, as if waiting for me to insert a fresh page into the carriage. \u201cWe\u2019ve done enough for today,\u201d I say. At least I have. Unlike Lenora, I\u2019m exhausted. Being hunched next to her all day has left me stiff and aching. When I stand up straight, half my joints let out a relieved crackle. \u201cIt\u2019s almost dinnertime.\u201d The rest of the evening proceeds on schedule. Dinner and pills. Dessert. Circulation exercises, then bath, then bed. Lenora spends all of it lost in thought. Presumably composing what she plans to type tomorrow. I know the feeling well. When that article about me ran in the newspaper, I called the reporter and demanded he hear my side of the story. The reporter listened with disinterest while I told him my mother\u2019s death was suicide, that leaving those pills within her reach was simply an accident, that I would never do anything to hurt her. \u201cDetective Vick says otherwise,\u201d the reporter said, as if the police\u2019s word was gospel and I was merely a liar trying to cover my tracks. That was six months ago, and I still sometimes get the pent-up urge to shout my innocence from every rooftop in town. I can only imagine how Lenora feels. It\u2019s been fifty-four years for her. No wonder she doesn\u2019t want to stop typing. After putting her to bed and placing the call button next to her hand, I say, \u201cDo you want me to stay until you fall asleep?\u201d Lenora taps twice on the bedspread. I nod. \u201cThen I\u2019ll stay.\u201d She closes her eyes and I gather the typed pages and take them to the divan. As Lenora\u2019s breathing deepens with sleep, I begin to read what she typed. Despite seeing snippets all day, I\u2019m surprised by the quality of her writing. I assumed the prose would be choppy and weak\u2014a string of half sentences not unlike the typed responses she\u2019s given me. Instead, Lenora is a natural storyteller. Her writing is clear and unfussy, while retaining a distinctive voice. From the very first line, I\u2019m hooked. By the time I\u2019m near the end, though, my surprise has curved into shock. Now I know what happened to the knife used to kill Winston and Evangeline Hope. Lenora tossed it into the ocean. That act\u2014plus the fact that her nightgown was covered in blood\u2014makes her look more guilty than ever. It doesn\u2019t help that she declares herself both good and evil. Now, some of that could be attributed to her home life, which was anything but happy. An addict mother. A philandering father. A sister she seemed to have nothing in common with. No wonder Lenora longed for escape and the attention of someone of the opposite sex. I know that feeling all too well, even now in my thirties. It\u2019s why I started sleeping with Kenny, after all. But Lenora was so young, so inexperienced. When you\u2019re that age, full of raging emotions and, yes, desire, it\u2019s very possible Lenora saw those natural feelings as wicked\u2014or worse. Yet that doesn\u2019t explain the bloody nightgown. Or getting rid of the weapon that killed her parents. Or why she fetched a rope as her sister\u2019s screams rang through the house. I can\u2019t stop thinking about all of that as I read the last three sentences Lenora typed today. But here\u2019s the thing--I wasn\u2019t a good girl. Not in the least. You\u2019ll see for yourself very soon. I lower the pages and look to the bed, where Lenora lies fast asleep. As I watch her, a sense of unease creeps over me. I\u2019d assumed she wanted to tell her story in an attempt to finally clear her name. And that she chose me to help because she saw us as kindred spirits. One falsely accused woman telling her story to another, working together to declare her innocence. Now I fear it\u2019s the opposite. Lenora didn\u2019t pick me because she thinks I\u2019m innocent. She did it because she thinks I\u2019m guilty. And what we\u2019ve been typing today isn\u2019t an attempt to clear her name. It\u2019s a confession. \n FOURTEEN I put the pages in the lockbox under my bed, pretending I\u2019m not hiding them, when that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing. Secreting them away beneath Lenora\u2019s rolling, rattling pill bottles because I don\u2019t want anyone else to find them. But it\u2019s not Lenora I\u2019m worried about as I lock the box and slide it back under the bed. My concern is that having Lenora Hope\u2019s partial confession in my possession will somehow make me look equally bad. Guilt by association. I\u2019m dropping the lockbox key into the nightstand drawer when I hear a series of noises from above and outside. A crack, a scrape, a clatter on the terrace. I rush to the window, struggling to see what it was. It\u2019s dark outside, and the lights inside the bedroom merely reflect my worried, tired face onto the window\u2019s glass. Thinking whatever I just heard could be related to the noises coming from Lenora\u2019s room last night, I decide to investigate. I whisk out of my room and take the service stairs to the kitchen. From there, I move through the dining room on my way to the terrace. As soon as I step outside, something crunches beneath my feet. A slate shingle recently fallen from the roof. That\u2019s at least one mystery noise explained. A dozen more shingles litter the terrace, many broken into a hundred pieces, a few still miraculously intact. I step over and around them on my way to the terrace railing. A frigid breeze comes off the ocean in steady, brine-scented puffs. I close my eyes and lean into it, enjoying the chill. It feels good after spending so much time inside the stuffy confines of Hope\u2019s End. Lenora doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s missing. The terrace runs the length of the entire mansion, ending on both sides with four short steps. The ones on the left descend to a flagstone patio surrounding an empty swimming pool. On the right, the steps lead to a swath of lawn. On the other side of it sits a one-story stone cottage so quaint and tidy it could have been plucked from a storybook. Warm light glows from a window beside the arched door. Light from another window flicks on above and behind me, in the mansion itself. It casts a slanted rectangle of brightness across the terrace. In that patch of light, a curl of metal glints among the shards of broken tile. I pick it up and hold it to the light. At first, I think it could be a paper clip bent into an oblong ring. But it\u2019s much thicker than a paper clip. Sturdier, too. It takes some force to bend it further. Both ends are curved toward each other, one more so than the other, making me deduce it was a hook of some kind that either broke or fell off. Maybe it\u2019s what caused the shingles to drop from the roof. I turn back to the lit window to scan the roof one story above it. Craning my neck, I try to see where it is in relation to my room. Two doors down, it looks like. On the other side of Lenora\u2019s room. Mrs. Baker. I take a few backward steps, angling for a better glimpse inside the room. I can make out frilly curtains, a hint of purple floral wallpaper, a shadow stretching across the ceiling. Something else then catches my eye. To the right of the lit window, in Lenora\u2019s room. There, framed in the darkened window, is a gray blur. I gasp, watching as the blur passes the window and disappears. I can\u2019t make out what it is. The room is dark and the movement too brief. All I know is that I\u2019m certain someone is walking around Lenora\u2019s bedroom. I keep moving backward, eyes fixed on the window, hoping for another glimpse of whoever it is. I\u2019m so focused on Lenora\u2019s room that I stop paying attention to the slate shingles on the terrace. I trip on one and stumble backward into the railing, which hits the small of my back and throws me off-balance. The twist of metal flies from my fingers as I reel wildly. Arms flailing. Heart jittering. My shoulders and head lean beyond the railing, out over the waves crashing far below. For a second, the chasm at my back feels like it\u2019s reaching up, as if trying to yank me over the edge and into its depths. I manage to lunge to the side, flipping over until my stomach is pressed against the railing and I\u2019m staring straight down the cliffside. Fifty feet below is the Atlantic, its waves collapsing onto the shore at the base of the cliff. A narrow strip of rock-studded sand sits between the cliff and the water, glowing white in the moonlight. I\u2019d find it lovely if not for the fact that one wrong move would have sent me crashing into it. On my right, I hear the swish of footsteps across the dew-dusted lawn. Carter\u2019s voice cuts through the night. \u201cMary?\u201d I turn to see him already halfway across the lawn and coming closer. He halts when he realizes it\u2019s me. \u201cSorry.\u201d He pauses, befuddled, like he\u2019s literally just seen a ghost. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d \u201cI think so,\u201d I huff, still breathless from my near miss. Carter resumes his approach, reaching the end of the lawn and hopping up the steps onto the terrace. \u201cFor a second there, I thought you were going to topple over the railing.\u201d \u201cSo did I.\u201d I step away from the railing on rubbery legs. It\u2019s the same feeling I had when I was first hit with the tilt on the second floor of Hope\u2019s End. Which makes sense, seeing how the terrace is likely also slanted toward the sea. The thought makes me take another wobbling backward step. Carter rushes to my side to prop me up. \u201cLet\u2019s sit you down for a few minutes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say. \u201cReally.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t look fine.\u201d Instead of leading me back into the mansion, Carter guides me down the steps and across the lawn to the stone cottage. Its open door spills golden light across the grass. \u201cDo you live here?\u201d I say. \u201cI do indeed. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s home.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay in the main house?\u201d \u201cBecause I\u2019m the groundskeeper and this is the groundskeeper\u2019s cottage,\u201d Carter says. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s nicer than that crooked old mansion. Cozy.\u201d When he ushers me inside, I see what he means. The cottage, while not large, has an undeniable charm. A single room divided into two areas\u2014kitchen and bedroom, with a small closed-off bathroom in the corner\u2014there\u2019s a rustic feel to the place. Exposed beams run across the ceiling, and diamond-pane windows face the ocean. Throw pillows on the couch and neatly made bed add splashes of color, while Audubon prints of native seabirds brighten the walls. Carter sits me down at a woodblock dining table big enough for only two people. My chair faces a boxy black-and-white TV on the kitchen counter, which broadcasts Game One of the World Series. Orioles versus the Phillies. Carter lowers the volume before opening a nearby cupboard. \u201cI have it on for background noise,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll care about the World Series when the Red Sox are in it. Which will be never.\u201d From the cupboard, he produces two rocks glasses, into which he pours an inch of whiskey. One glass is placed on the table in front of me. He holds the other as he leans against the counter. \u201cDrink up,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019ll calm your nerves.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think Mrs. Baker would approve.\u201d \u201cMrs. Baker probably has three glasses of Chardonnay under her belt and is now working on number four.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I stare into my glass, surprised. I never would have pegged Mrs. Baker as someone with a drinking problem. She seems so . . . serious. It makes me wonder if she was that way before arriving at Hope\u2019s End or if the place slowly drove her to drink. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t. You just got here. But give it enough time and you\u2019ll know all our secrets.\u201d I allow myself a tiny sip of whiskey. Carter is right. Its amber warmth instantly calms me. \u201cAnything else I should know about Mrs. Baker?\u201d Carter leaves the counter and approaches the table, turning the remaining chair around so he can straddle it, his arms folded across the backrest. Inside and in the light, I notice things about him that I missed earlier. Like the small cleft in his chin barely visible beneath his beard. Or the way he smells freshly showered. The scents of soap and shampoo rise off his skin. \u201cSuch as?\u201d he says. \u201cHer first name, for starters.\u201d \u201cBeats me. I have no clue. What\u2019s your guess?\u201d \u201cMorticia,\u201d I say. \u201cOr Cruella.\u201d Carter, caught mid-sip, snort laughs. \u201cMaybe Archie knows, since he\u2019s been here as long as she has.\u201d \u201cDo you think they\u2019re a couple?\u201d I say. \u201cI doubt it. From what I can tell, they barely speak to each other.\u201d \u201cThen why do you think they\u2019ve stayed here this long? Archie told me he\u2019s been here almost sixty years, and Mrs. Baker left but eventually came back. I assume both of them could have gotten jobs anywhere.\u201d \u201cI think the situation is more complicated than that,\u201d Carter says. \u201cThey knew Lenora before the murders. And the truth is, she\u2019d be helpless without them. I think they know that, which might explain why they\u2019ve been here so long.\u201d \u201cAnd how long have you been here?\u201d \u201cAh, now you\u2019re interested in my secrets,\u201d Carter says with a smile that could be considered flirtatious but is more likely out of politeness. No one has flirted with me for a very long time. Kenny certainly didn\u2019t. He skipped the flirting and got straight to the point. Sadly, it worked. \u201cYou said I\u2019ll find out eventually,\u201d I say, trying a little weak flirting myself. I blame the attempt on the whiskey. \u201cYou might as well tell me now.\u201d \u201cMy secret is that I\u2019m not a groundskeeper. At least I wasn\u2019t until I took this job.\u201d \u201cWhat were you?\u201d \u201cA bartender.\u201d Carter raises his glass, takes a sip. \u201cThat feels like a lifetime ago, even though it\u2019s only been a year. One of my regulars was the former groundskeeper here. When he retired, he suggested I be his replacement. Even put in a good word for me.\u201d \u201cThat seems like quite a leap, from bartender to groundskeeper.\u201d \u201cOh, it was. My guess is he thought I was trustworthy, which is necessary for a place like Hope\u2019s End. Mrs. Baker agreed, and now here I am.\u201d A muffled roar drifts from the TV. On the tiny screen, someone from the Phillies circles the bases after hitting a home run. Carter reaches for the television and switches it off. \u201cAnd you really do like it here?\u201d I say. Carter spreads his arms wide. \u201cI\u2019ve got my own place, and it comes with a view of the ocean. Not many people can say that. Sure, the job\u2019s a bit much for just me, but then again, Hope\u2019s End doesn\u2019t get too many visitors, so there\u2019s no need to impress anyone. What\u2019s not to like?\u201d \u201cUm, the fact that three people were murdered here. And that there are still bloodstains in the carpet.\u201d \u201cI see you\u2019ve taken the murder tour.\u201d \u201cJessie showed me around last night,\u201d I say with a nod. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re now thinking of running away like Mary did.\u201d \u201cHow well do you know her?\u201d \u201cEnough to think you were her,\u201d Carter says. I look down at my uniform, which had once been worn by Mary. The fact that I can fit into it means we\u2019re about the same size and height. No wonder Carter mistook me for her in the dark. \u201cIt must have been strange thinking she\u2019d suddenly come back.\u201d \u201cNot as strange as the way she left,\u201d Carter says. \u201cNo notice or warning. One day, Mary was simply gone. It was a surprise. I\u2019d assumed she was happy here.\u201d \u201cJessie also said she was surprised.\u201d \u201cShe and Mary were pretty close. I, on the other hand, mostly keep to myself. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Mary and I were friends. The truth is, I didn\u2019t see much of her. I live here. She stayed in the mansion, spending most of her time with Lenora. So we didn\u2019t exactly hang out. Most of the time, we\u2019d chat on the terrace in the evenings. Every time I spotted her uniform, I\u2019d come out and say hi.\u201d \u201cDo you think Lenora had something to do with why she left?\u201d I say. \u201cThat Mary was, I don\u2019t know, frightened of her somehow?\u201d \u201cIt sounds like you think Lenora\u2019s guilty,\u201d Carter says. I stare into my drink, contemplating my reflection wobbling atop the amber liquid. Fitting, for I feel wobbly myself. My opinion of Lenora has shifted so much in the past two days that I no longer know how I feel. \u201cIt sounds like you think she isn\u2019t. So who do you think did it? Winston Hope or the painter?\u201d \u201cNeither,\u201d Carter says. \u201cI think it was Ricardo Mayhew.\u201d I look up from the whiskey, confused. \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cThe groundskeeper at the time. He and his wife were living in this cottage when the murders occurred. She wasn\u2019t here. She worked as a kitchen maid and was given the night off with the rest of the servants. She went into town and saw a movie. Ricardo, though, stayed behind.\u201d \u201cDid the police know this?\u201d \u201cThey did,\u201d Carter says. \u201cBack in 1929 it was widely suspected that not every member of the household staff left for the night.\u201d \u201cHow do you know this?\u201d \u201cFrom my predecessor. I poured the drinks, and he told me stories about this place. Another reason I took the job. After hearing so much about Hope\u2019s End, I wanted to experience it for myself.\u201d \u201cSo this groundskeeper\u2014\u201d \u201cRicardo,\u201d Carter interjects. I nod. \u201cRight. Ricardo. He stayed behind and did . . . what?\u201d \u201cNo one knows.\u201d \u201cThe police didn\u2019t question him after the murders?\u201d \u201cThey couldn\u2019t. Ricardo Mayhew was gone. After that night, he was never seen again.\u201d Carter eyes me over his glass, waiting for my reaction. I respond appropriately, my jaw dropping in surprise. \u201cAnd his wife\u2014\u201d \u201cBerniece.\u201d The name jars my memory. Lenora mentioned her in passing. Berniece was the kitchen maid who wished her a half-hearted happy birthday. \u201cShe never saw him again, either?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d \u201cAnd she had no idea where he went or what happened to him?\u201d \u201cNone,\u201d Carter says. \u201cShe\u2019s still around, though. Most folks say she never left town because she\u2019s waiting for her husband to return. It\u2019s more likely the poor woman has nowhere else to go.\u201d \u201cSo you think Ricardo Mayhew murdered the rest of the Hope family and then ran?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my guess. Short of Lenora killing them, it\u2019s the only thing that makes sense.\u201d \u201cBut why would the groundskeeper want to kill Winston Hope and his family?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Carter says. \u201cWhy would Lenora?\u201d A fair point. One I\u2019m still trying to understand myself. But Carter didn\u2019t just spend the entire day helping her type. He didn\u2019t read about the bloody nightgown. Or Lenora tossing a knife into the ocean. Or leaving the terrace to get rope that, I assume, was later tightened around her sister\u2019s neck. And even though I want to tell him all those things, I don\u2019t. It seems wrong to mention anything until I learn the whole story. Only then will I spill any details. I think that\u2019s what Lenora ultimately wants\u2014for me to be the voice she doesn\u2019t have. Even if what I\u2019m saying is her long-delayed confession. \u201cIf you\u2019re right\u2014and that\u2019s a very big if\u2014it still doesn\u2019t make sense. Why wouldn\u2019t Lenora say anything? If Ricardo killed her parents and her sister, why wouldn\u2019t she tell that to the police?\u201d Or to me, for that matter. So far, she hasn\u2019t once typed the name Ricardo Mayhew. If she thought he did it, why wasn\u2019t that the first thing she wrote? Instead, she began when, to use her phrasing, it was all but over. \u201cMaybe she didn\u2019t know,\u201d Carter suggests. But Lenora did know her parents were dead. She told me so. They were dead and her nightgown was bloody and she threw the knife over the terrace railing despite knowing it was evidence of two brutal crimes. Why would she do that if she wasn\u2019t the one who had used it? I finish my drink, my thoughts rattling like the ice in my now-empty glass. In that tumbling mental chaos, a new theory takes shape. One I can\u2019t share with Carter. Not just yet. \u201cI need to go,\u201d I say, standing suddenly. \u201cThanks for the drink.\u201d Carter watches in confusion as I give a quick wave goodbye, leave the cottage, and cross the damp lawn. On the terrace, I watch for shingles underfoot and steer clear of the railing. Only when I\u2019m under Lenora\u2019s window do I risk an upward glance. Although her room is still dark and nothing appears at the window, I can\u2019t stop thinking of Lenora lying within, wide awake and mentally repeating a single line from the rhyme I\u2019ve known since grade school. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d Lenora said Maybe that part of the rhyme is true. But I suspect there\u2019s more to the story than Lenora is letting on\u2014then or now. Inside the house, I quickly climb the service stairs. On the second floor, I begin to sway, the mansion\u2019s tilt made worse by the whiskey. Instead of just one drink, it feels like I\u2019ve had four, which explains why I brazenly lurch into Lenora\u2019s room. I switch on the bedside lamp, startling her awake. Or maybe Lenora\u2019s only pretending to be startled. I can\u2019t shake the sense that she was already awake\u2014and that she knew I\u2019d be coming. Before she saw it was me storming into the room, her left hand made no move to press the call button. Then there\u2019s the intrigued look in her eyes. While the rest of her face retains a shocked, questioning scrunch, they glisten with satisfaction. \u201cI want you to tell me about Ricardo Mayhew,\u201d I say. \n I spent ten minutes weeping in the ballroom before running through the house, looking for Archie. He\u2019d know what to say to make me feel better. He always did. But Archie had made himself scarce recently. My only glimpse of him today was as I passed through the kitchen before dinner, and even then I didn\u2019t dare say anything to him. My sister and I were forbidden from socializing with the staff and vice versa, but that had done nothing to stop me and Archie from becoming best friends. Unable to locate Archie, I found myself outside on the terrace. Even though it was technically spring, winter\u2019s grip remained tight, making the night air bracingly cold. I didn\u2019t mind, though. I was just happy to be anywhere but inside that awful, awful house. I climbed atop the railing. Another thing I was told not to do but did anyway, mostly because the railing was so low. If my father hadn\u2019t wanted me to climb on it, then he should have made it higher. Sitting there, balanced precariously, I stared down at the water below. Moonlight sparkled on the ocean swells and the whitecaps glowed in the night. It was so beautiful that, just for a moment, I considered leaping off the railing to join them. It seemed a better alternative than life at Hope\u2019s End. I was young and bursting with yearning. For love. For adventure. For life. Yet none of that awaited me here, in a place where my mother medicated herself into a stupor, my father openly cheated with the maids, and my sister pretended nothing was wrong. Was this how I was going to spend the rest of my life? If that was the case, I\u2019d rather end it now. And what a fitting end it would be, making the day of my birth also the day of my death. Before I could entertain the notion further, a voice spoke up from behind me. \u201cCareful. If you fell to your death, this place would have nothing worth looking at.\u201d I whirled around, almost losing my balance in the process. I teetered on the railing a moment, suddenly terrified I was about to fall. A second earlier, I\u2019d been thinking of ending it all. Now I wanted nothing more than to live--if only to chastise my unknown companion for spying on me. After righting myself, I hopped off the railing. At the same time, the source of the voice crept from the shadows along the side of the mansion. I knew who he was because I\u2019d heard Berniece mention him in the kitchen and eavesdropped on the maids talking about how handsome he was. And indeed he was handsome. Wearing just work pants and a cotton undershirt, he had a primal look to him. Strong and slightly brutish. Rather than slick his hair back with pomade like most men did at the time, he let it grow wild and unruly. He swiped a lock of hair from his eyes and stared at me in a way that can only be described as wolfish. A smile played across his lips, as if he knew every wicked thought I\u2019d had earlier that day. \u201cYou weren\u2019t really going to jump, were you?\u201d he said. I looked his way, even though I\u2019d been trying not to. I didn\u2019t want to stare, for I knew it would make him think I considered him worthy of staring at, which he very much was. But his remark forced me to face him head-on. While completely true, it also smacked of impropriety. \u201cI don\u2019t need to explain myself. Especially to someone like you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t. But I am curious why someone with your life would even risk death by climbing up on that railing.\u201d I turned back to the ocean, refusing to look at him a moment longer. \u201cYou know nothing about my life.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d He joined me at the railing, focusing his attention solely on me, as if he couldn\u2019t wait to hear what I had to say. \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d \u201cEverything.\u201d He let out a low whistle. \u201cThat sounds quite serious.\u201d \u201cDo my problems amuse you?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot at all, Miss Hope. But surely not everything is terrible.\u201d \u201cThis house is,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s downright awful.\u201d He turned around and gazed up at the glittering mansion behind us. \u201cIt looks quite nice to me.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not, I can assure you,\u201d I replied. \u201cHonestly, I would kill to leave this place.\u201d He moved closer until we were mere inches apart. So close I felt the heat coming off his skin, which in turn gave me delicious chills. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been properly introduced,\u201d he said, holding out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Ricky.\u201d \n FIFTEEN Ricky Lenora types the name with such force that the letters scar the page as if they\u2019ve been applied with a branding iron. Now she stares up at me, defiant and irritated. Her eyes, narrowed like a cartoon villain\u2019s, seem to ask if I\u2019m satisfied. I\u2019m not, despite the chapter she just banged out in the middle of the night and the questions she tapped answers to before the typing began. The first one, posed immediately after I burst into her room, was \u201cDid you know him, Lenora?\u201d She replied with taps in the affirmative against the bedspread. \u201cDo you know what happened to him?\u201d A single tap that time. No. \u201cDid Ricardo do it?\u201d Carter was right. Short of her being the culprit, it was the only explanation that made sense. Ricardo was here that night. Then he vanished\u2014most likely after killing Winston and Evangeline Hope. And I think Lenora either knew this or suspected it. Lenora turned away from me and gazed across the room at the typewriter. I knew that look well enough by then to march to the desk, put a fresh sheet of paper in the typewriter, and carry it to the bed. Lenora then began to type, the thwack of the keystrokes loud enough to echo through the nighttime quiet of her bedroom. i cant tell you yet \u201cWhy not?\u201d because i need to do it in order I repeated my question: \u201cWhy?\u201d She nodded, signaling me to hit the typewriter\u2019s return bar. so youll understand what happened Another nod. and how A third nod. and why \u201cOr you could just type who did it now,\u201d I said hopefully. \u201cAnd help me understand later.\u201d A hint of a smile played across Lenora\u2019s lips. She was, I realized, enjoying this. Teasing out her story bit by tantalizing bit. Keeping me on edge. She placed her hand flat atop the keys. Usually a sign that a chapter was over. In this case, it meant she wanted a fresh page. I obliged, fetching a few sheets of paper from the desk and rolling one into the typewriter. A new chapter was about to start. Lenora and I spent the next two hours typing. As time passed\u2014and midnight came and went\u2014the mood of the room subtly began to change. It got colder. Not all at once. Slowly. The chill crept in the same way winter does after a glorious fall. By the time Lenora started typing the third page, I was shivering from cold. Worse was the sense halfway through her writing that we weren\u2019t alone, even though no one else was in the room with us. I know because I began to check, my gaze darting to the closed door and the dim corners where light from the bedside lamp couldn\u2019t reach. No one else was there. Just us. Yet I couldn\u2019t shake the sense that someone else was nearby, watching us. Even as Lenora typed about meeting a handsome stranger on the terrace, my thoughts drifted to what Jessie had told me on the murder tour. That Mary claimed to have seen the ghost of Virginia Hope roaming the second floor. That she was scared of this place. That it was why she fled. Hope\u2019s End isn\u2019t a normal house. There\u2019s a darkness here. I can feel it. Mary did. Even though Jessie had said it to set up her prank in the ballroom, I wondered if maybe there was some truth behind it. In my experience, most lies contain at least some kernel of truth. Because I felt the darkness, too. And I didn\u2019t like it one bit. Lenora slapped my hand then, yanking me from my thoughts while also indicating that I needed to press the shift key. I did and said, \u201cDo you feel that? Like someone else is here?\u201d She tapped no and resumed typing as I continued to feel the gaze of unseen eyes watching us and the creeping chill that got stronger and stronger until that final word was embedded onto the page. Ricky. The room gets warmer the moment Lenora types it. The chill I\u2019d felt vanishes in an instant, as does the feeling that someone else is here, hiding and watching. Now the only person watching is Lenora, who continues to stare at me, asking without words if what she\u2019s just typed is enough. \u201cFor now, yes,\u201d I say as I return the typewriter to the desk, the page in the carriage flapping as I go. I still don\u2019t know half of what happened before, during, or after her parents\u2019 murders, but Lenora doesn\u2019t need to type it all out tonight. What she did write was breathless enough for me to infer several key facts. For instance, I now think I know why Lenora got rid of the murder weapon. It\u2019s the same reason she told the police so little about that night. She was trying to protect someone. Why she did it also seems clear. Eight months before the murders, Lenora had fallen in love with Ricardo Mayhew. \n SIXTEEN I wake with a scream caught in my throat. Swallowing hard, I gulp it down before it can be released into the darkened bedroom. Then I sit up and do a little shimmy, trying to shake off another humdinger of a nightmare that prompted the near scream. My mother again. Standing over my sleeping form. Stuffing pills into my mouth until I begin to choke. The nightmare was so vivid that I shove an index finger into my mouth, feeling for pills that couldn\u2019t possibly be there. That\u2019s when I hear it. A creak. The same kind I heard last night, coming from the same location. Lenora\u2019s room. The sound of a second creak pulls me out of bed. All thoughts of the nightmare I\u2019d just had evaporate as I tiptoe to the door between our rooms. Now I\u2019m only concerned about one thing: discovering what the hell is making those noises. Standing at the door, I look down at my feet. The thin strip of moonlight coming from under the door runs across the floor, an inch from my toes. A shadow joins it. Eclipsing the moonlight as it passes the other side of the door. I gasp, twist the doorknob, and throw open the door. There\u2019s no one else in Lenora\u2019s room. Just her, flat-backed and fast asleep in her bed. I think of the gray blur I saw at her window earlier, momentarily forgotten in the events that followed. Me almost tumbling over the terrace railing. The long talk with Carter. An even longer typing session with Lenora. But I\u2019m certain someone was moving around inside this room, then and now. I approach the bed and kneel by Lenora\u2019s side, checking to see if she really is asleep and not just pretending like I suspect she was when I burst into the room hours earlier. I wave my hand in front of her face, eliciting no reaction. Definitely no flinch signaling she\u2019s aware I\u2019m doing it. I then touch her left wrist to check her pulse. It\u2019s slow, steady. \u201cLenora?\u201d I whisper anyway. \u201cWas that you?\u201d She doesn\u2019t answer me, of course. She can\u2019t. Just like she can\u2019t walk. Even if she could, Lenora is seventy-one. There\u2019s no way she\u2019d be fast enough to hop into bed as soon as I opened the door. A person half her age wouldn\u2019t be able to do that. Since it wasn\u2019t Lenora and there\u2019s no one else in the room, I know I should blame my imagination. It\u2019s late, I\u2019m exhausted, and it\u2019s possible the house is messing with my mind. But those noises were real. So were the shadow at the door and the blur at the window. I didn\u2019t imagine them. I heard them and saw them and know there must be a logical reason for them. It will all make sense in the morning. That\u2019s something else my mother used to tell me, back when I was struggling to deal with all the pain and pressure of adolescence. Go to bed. Get a good night\u2019s sleep. It will all make sense in the morning. Usually, she was right. Even when things still didn\u2019t completely make sense, I often felt better in the morning. This time, though, the advice is dead wrong. Nothing makes sense when I wake a few hours later with the rising sun poking my retinas and the mattress slid a few inches lower than when I went to sleep. Exhaustion grips me as I get out of bed and start my morning routine. Showering in a tilted tub. Brushing my teeth over a tilted sink. Putting on a uniform that belonged to someone who fled this place. Before going downstairs, I look in on Lenora, pausing at the door before throwing it open. Like a suspicious lover. Or a distrustful father. Trying to catch her in the act. Of what, I have no idea. Other than typing, she mostly just observes, which is what she does now, giving me a quizzical look from the bed. The first thing I do is check the desk. The typewriter is exactly where I placed it during the night. The page in the carriage, however, sits next to it, typed side up, as if someone had been reading it. But unlike yesterday, I\u2019m certain I left that paper in the typewriter. I remember seeing the page flutter as I carried the typewriter back to the desk. I turn to Lenora. \u201cSomeone was in here during the night. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d She gives me another one of those vague nods that I\u2019m still learning to interpret. This time, I again know it\u2019s to bring the typewriter to the bed. After I do, I place her hand on the keys and let her answer. you didnt sleep well I have trouble discerning her tone. Without punctuation, it looks like a statement, meaning Lenora knows I didn\u2019t sleep well. With a question mark\u2014missing because it requires me to press the shift key\u2014it becomes more innocent. A query, likely prompted by the dark circles under my eyes. Lenora gazes at me, waiting for an answer. Her expression\u2014expectant and confused\u2014tells me it\u2019s the latter. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d I say. She starts moving her hand across the keyboard again, eventually typing out a familiar word. a humdinger This time, I can tell it\u2019s a question by Lenora\u2019s brows, which arch inquisitively. I nod my head and smile. \u201cYes. But even before that, I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d More typing. the wind Still more typing. makes strange noises I take a step back and give Lenora a look. \u201cHow do you know I heard noises?\u201d Because she caused them. The thought pushes into my brain like a drill bit. Sudden, unnerving, and unwanted. Also, ridiculous. No, it was someone else. And Lenora\u2019s lying to me. Probably not for the first time. It occurs to me that much of what she\u2019s typed so far could be, if not a lie, then at least a bending of the truth. Shaping the story in a way that suits her best. I did it myself when talking to Mrs. Baker upon my arrival. I could have said it was my mother who overdosed on pills. Instead, I told her it was merely a patient. Not a lie, exactly, but also not the full truth. Not by a long shot. I suspect Lenora\u2019s been doing the same. And I\u2019m getting tired of it. \u201cI know someone was in here last night,\u201d I say. \u201cNow tell me who it was or no more typing. And certainly no more telling your story.\u201d Lenora studies me, trying to decide if I\u2019m bluffing. Good luck with that. I don\u2019t even know how serious I am. While I suspect I\u2019m as eager to hear the full story as she is to write it, I\u2019m also hesitant. Again, it might not be the whole truth. And if it is, I might not want to know it. Apparently, I look more decisive than I feel, because Lenora starts typing again. someones been here I enjoy a moment of vindication. I knew it wasn\u2019t my imagination! \u201cBut not just last night, right? The night before as well.\u201d many nights Jolted with alarm, I say, \u201cThen who is it? Who\u2019s been in your room?\u201d Still hesitant, Lenora sizes me up again. Then she resumes typing with pronounced reluctance. It takes her a full minute to press eight keys. When she\u2019s done, I rip the page from the typewriter. Marking the white paper in ink as black as night is a single name. virginia \n SEVENTEEN Muzak squawks from the kitchen telephone as I wait for Mr. Gurlain to pick up. It\u2019s been five minutes since he put me on hold. Long enough for a queasy rendition of a Captain & Tennille song to be replaced by an even worse cover of \u201cYou Don\u2019t Bring Me Flowers.\u201d I wait, receiver at my ear, as I look around the empty kitchen, hoping no one enters while I\u2019m here. I don\u2019t want to explain why I\u2019ve left Lenora alone in her wheelchair while I make a phone call. I especially don\u2019t want to talk about the reason for the call. Telling it to Mr. Gurlain is going to be hard enough. When he gets on the line, blessedly cutting off the Muzak, he sounds nervous. I assume he\u2019s thinking about the morning I found my mother dead, which was the last time he got an urgent phone call from me. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he says. \u201cNo. Well, yes.\u201d I inhale, hold the breath in my chest, exhale. \u201cI\u2019m calling to ask for a new assignment.\u201d \u201cI just gave you a new assignment,\u201d Mr. Gurlain says. \u201cI\u2019d like a different one,\u201d I say, tacking on a polite \u201cplease.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s only been a few days, Kit.\u201d \u201cI know. I just\u2014\u201d My voice seizes up. I have no idea what to say. That I\u2019m afraid? I\u2019m not. Fear involves certainty. You know what you\u2019re afraid of. I\u2019m the opposite. Uncertain and unnerved. And who can blame me? I\u2019m in a slanted mansion where three people were murdered. There are bloodstains on the Grand Stairs and a ballroom where a dead girl swung from the chandelier. A dead girl who, apparently, roams my patient\u2019s bedroom at night. I don\u2019t believe in ghosts. I absolutely do not think that what I heard was the spirit of Virginia Hope. But something\u2019s not right at Hope\u2019s End. Obviously. And it might have frightened Mary enough to make her leave in the middle of the night without taking anything with her. I don\u2019t want to stick around and wait to see if I\u2019ll eventually get that desperate. I\u2019d rather leave now, in broad daylight, taking all my belongings with me. \u201cI don\u2019t like it here,\u201d I finally say. \u201cI told you I wasn\u2019t comfortable working in this house.\u201d \u201cAnd I told you there wasn\u2019t a choice,\u201d Mr. Gurlain says. \u201cBut there are other caregivers available. I saw their names on the assignment board. Can\u2019t you send one of them here and put me somewhere else? It doesn\u2019t have to be immediately. I can wait a week or two until another assignment becomes available.\u201d That last bit is a stretch. I might not have enough money to last me a few weeks. But Mr. Gurlain doesn\u2019t need to know that. He just needs to put me somewhere else\u2014something he doesn\u2019t seem too inclined to do. \u201cWe went over this, Kit,\u201d Mr. Gurlain says with a sigh. \u201cI make\u2014\u201d \u201cThe assignments and the caregivers follow them. Yes, I know. I was just hoping you would consider making a onetime exception.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Gurlain says without giving it a moment of thought. \u201cAgain, you\u2019re welcome to leave your assignment. But if you do, it means you\u2019re leaving my employ for good. I\u2019ve already given you a onetime exception. Most other agencies would have fired you six months ago. Take it or leave it.\u201d I have no choice but to take it. Yes, I could quit on the spot or, like Mary, leave in the middle of the night, but the only person I\u2019d be hurting is myself. I have next to no money and no job prospects. I\u2019m not even sure I have a house to return to. Quitting would make those problems worse. In short, I\u2019m stuck at Hope\u2019s End. \u201cI understand,\u201d I say, talking quickly so Mr. Gurlain can\u2019t tell I\u2019m on the verge of tears. \u201cSorry to have bothered you.\u201d Resigned to my fate, I hang up and look around the massive, empty kitchen inside this massive, empty house. How the hell did I get here? I think about all the ways my life could have been different\u2014and when everything went wrong. Was it when my mother got sick? Or was it before that? When I got fired from the typing pool and decided to become a caregiver, for instance? Or when, bored by school, I realized I\u2019d never amount to very much and decided not to try? Maybe I was set on this path the first time I heard the chant about Lenora. At seventeen, Lenora Hope . . . There\u2019s one blueberry muffin left over from breakfast, sitting in a basket on the counter. I grab it, taking a bite as I move through the dining room and out onto the terrace. Outside is brisk but bright\u2014the perfect weather for clearing my mind. A necessity after my call with Mr. Gurlain. The sun, wind, and salty air combine to calm me down, make me start thinking rationally again. Now that it\u2019s clear I\u2019m stuck here, I need to focus on how to get myself unstuck. The answer is obvious: do my job. Collect a paycheck, save enough to get as far away from here as possible, start over. It also means I need to follow through on my threat to Lenora if she didn\u2019t tell me who was in her room. No more typing. No more story. I tell myself it\u2019s probably all lies anyway. If Lenora can\u2019t be honest with me about who\u2019s been creeping around her room, then she\u2019s certainly not going to tell me the truth about the night her family was murdered. It all leaves me feeling duped, not to mention stupid, for ever trusting her to be honest. I decide the next thing to do is figure out what\u2019s been causing the noises in Lenora\u2019s room. There has to be a logical explanation for them. Same with the shadow that slid past the door and the blur I saw at the window. Since Archie, Mrs. Baker, and even Lenora suggested the wind, that makes it the likeliest culprit. They know Hope\u2019s End better than I do. Similarly, the blur at the window could have been a trick of the moonlight on the glass. As for the shadow at the door, it might have been caused by clouds scudding in front of the moon, momentarily blocking its light. A plane or large bird could have done the same thing. Considering the sad state of the house, it\u2019s even more likely that a loose shutter or a broken drainpipe was the cause. I turn around and face the back of the mansion, its three formidable stories looming over me. Taking care not to lose my balance, I lean against the railing and scan the exterior. Nothing appears to be out of place around Lenora\u2019s windows. There\u2019s certainly no shutter swinging in the breeze or slanted drainpipe bobbing from the roofline. But there are plenty of birds. Seagulls whirl overhead before diving to the water, lured by sand crabs left exposed by low tide. I rotate and look down at the strip of sand between the water and base of the cliff. Smooth waves calmly collapse against the shore, pushing foamy water around the rocks jutting from the sand. I lean forward and look closer, realizing I\u2019m mistaken. Those aren\u2019t rocks rising out of the wet sand. They\u2019re something else. A hand. A foot. A head. Humped beneath the sand is the corpse they\u2019re attached to. And even before I begin to scream, I know with dreadful certainty that I\u2019m looking at the body of Mary Milton. \n EIGHTEEN I\u2019m in the sunroom, although there\u2019s no sun to be found. Outside, the sky is streaked with dark clouds that rolled in not long after I found Mary\u2019s body. It makes everything gray and oppressive, as if the gathering storm is pressing against the house, trying to force its way in. Joining me in this gloom is the last person I want to see. Detective Vick. He sits in the same dusty love seat Mrs. Baker occupied the day I arrived, looking rumpled and not pleased to be here. Or with me. The feeling is mutual. I tense up in his presence. An ingrained reaction. The result is a clash of emotions\u2014disbelief, sorrow, and bone-deep unease that Detective Vick has come not to ask about Mary but to finally arrest me. \u201cWell, Kit,\u201d he says, \u201cI sure am surprised to see you.\u201d I yank the hem of my uniform, trying to tug it an inch or so closer to my knees. I\u2019m cold, thanks to a chill that\u2019s clung to me since the moment I realized I was looking at Mary Milton\u2019s corpse. It\u2019s shock, I know, exacerbated by the fact that I\u2019m talking to the man who wanted to throw me in jail. \u201cSurprised I\u2019m at Hope\u2019s End?\u201d I say. \u201cOr surprised I\u2019m still allowed to work after you accused me of murder?\u201d The detective sighs. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t need to be contentious, Kit. I\u2019m just trying to figure out what happened.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t seem too interested in that the last time we talked.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll let that slide,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cYou\u2019re understandably distressed.\u201d I am. I\u2019m afraid to even blink out of fear the image of Mary\u2019s corpse poking from the sand will be projected onto the backs of my eyelids. Making it worse is the realization that I spotted her body last night, after I almost tumbled over the terrace railing. I looked down and saw dark objects in the sand that I thought were rocks but now know was Mary. And I can\u2019t stop thinking about how long she\u2019d been there\u2014and how, had I understood what I was looking at, I could have at least spared her a few more hours of indignity. Knowing that I didn\u2019t leaves me so sad and guilty I can barely catch my breath. But I refuse to let Detective Vick see any of that. I\u2019ll sprint from this room and never come back before that happens. \u201cJust ask me your questions,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat\u2019s your job here at Hope\u2019s End?\u201d Even though my uniform and history should give it away, I provide an answer. \u201cI\u2019m a caregiver.\u201d \u201cAnd who is it you care for?\u201d I hesitate, not wanting to tell him because I know the kind of reaction it\u2019ll bring. An ironic smirk, probably. Detective Vick might even make a crack about the appropriateness of a killer caring for a killer. \u201cLenora Hope,\u201d I finally say. To the detective\u2019s credit, there\u2019s no smirk. But I do notice the slight lift of his brows, indicating surprise. \u201cHow long have you been caring for her?\u201d \u201cThis is my third day.\u201d The detective\u2019s brows rise again, higher this time, as he says, \u201cQuite an eventful first week on the job.\u201d The understatement of the year, considering everything else I\u2019ve experienced since arriving at Hope\u2019s End. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who first saw the body, correct?\u201d I give a quick nod, again trying not to picture Mary mostly covered by sand that had been packed over her for more than a week. She might have been completely buried in a few more days. Maybe less. I know it\u2019s a good thing she was found before it was too late, even though I deeply wish it wasn\u2019t me who did it. \u201cWalk me through it,\u201d Detective Vick says. I do, quickly recounting being on the terrace, noticing the seagulls, looking over the edge of the cliff, and seeing Mary. \u201cWhy were you out there in the first place?\u201d It feels like a trick question, even though I know it\u2019s not. But to answer it honestly would mean talking about strange noises and shadows moving around Lenora\u2019s room. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to go there. Instead, I give a not entirely dishonest reply. \u201cJust getting some fresh air.\u201d I look out the row of windows that face the ocean. Outside, a pair of cops mill about the terrace. One of them paces back and forth, eyes aimed at the ground. The other keeps peering over the railing at the water below, even though Mary\u2019s corpse was recovered more than two hours ago. Because of the steepness of the cliff, the police needed a boat to reach it. A small army of officers then stormed the narrow beach and dug Mary out before the tide rolled in again. \u201cWhat are they looking for?\u201d \u201cAnything that might give us an idea of what happened,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cBut Mary fell, right?\u201d I continue to eye the terrace railing, thinking about how I almost tumbled over it last night. The raw panic of that moment remains fresh in my memory. First surprise, then fumbling, then pure fear. I imagine the same thing happening to Mary. A trip. A slip. A long, terrifying fall. It makes me wince. That poor, poor girl. \u201cIt\u2019s one of several possibilities,\u201d Detective Vick says in a noncommittal way that makes it sound like he\u2019s considered only one possibility. I study his face, so expressionless it could be a mask. I\u2019ve seen that look from him before. I know it means he\u2019s already made up his mind. \u201cYou think she jumped,\u201d I say. It makes more sense than falling, despite my recent near miss. The terrace, with its low railing and cliff\u2019s edge access, seems tailor-made for suicide. It would be so easy for someone to climb over the railing and make that final leap. Under normal circumstances, I\u2019d spare another thought for poor Mary Milton, feeling sad and sorry for a woman whose personal demons drove her to take her own life. But right now I can only focus on my mother, another woman driven to suicide, and how Detective Vick refused to believe she acted alone. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make any assumptions at this time,\u201d he replies in that same maddening tone. \u201cYet you were fine making them about me.\u201d Those assumptions eventually found their way into the local newspaper, caused me to be suspended for six months, and almost landed me in jail. They made my few friends vanish and my own father suspect the worst about me. Anger rises inside me, so fast and volcanic I think it\u2019s about to propel me off the love seat and across the room to attack Detective Vick. Only sheer force of will keeps me in place. I sit with my arms tightly crossed, unable to make eye contact. I fear just looking at him will set me off again\u2014and that I\u2019ll no longer be able to control it. Sensing my anger, Detective Vick tries to calm me by saying, \u201cThis is more than just an assumption, okay? A note was found in a pocket of Miss Milton\u2019s uniform, indicating that she intended to kill herself.\u201d I don\u2019t ask what it says. One, it\u2019s none of my business and, two, I\u2019m too busy wondering how different my life would be right now if my mother had left behind a suicide note. I suspect it would be very different, seeing how a note seems to be all Detective Vick needs. \u201cAre you aware of any reason why Mary Milton would want to take her own life?\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I never met her. She was gone before I got here.\u201d I cringe as I say it. Gone has multiple meanings. Dead is one. Missing is another. So, too, is left, although it turns out Mary never did. She was here the whole time. Detective Vick tries a different tactic. \u201cDo you think she liked working at Hope\u2019s End?\u201d \u201cFrom what others have told me, I guess she did,\u201d I say. \u201cDo you like working here?\u201d Caught off guard by the question, I shift on the love seat. \u201cI just got here.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer the question. Which is a simple one. You either like it here or you don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI like it here,\u201d I say, flashing a tight smile so it doesn\u2019t seem like the lie it is. Completely unnecessary, it turns out. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you told your employer,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cWhen did you talk to Mr. Gurlain?\u201d \u201cAbout fifteen minutes ago. Before you and I talked, I wanted to confirm you were indeed the same Kit McDeere I thought you were. When I spoke to Mr. Gurlain, he told me that you also called him not long ago.\u201d My anger returns. Before he even set foot in this room, Detective Vick knew I worked at Hope\u2019s End, how long I\u2019ve been here, and what my job entails. He also knows I asked Mr. Gurlain for a new assignment mere minutes before finding the body of Mary Milton. This whole interrogation feels like a trap to prove I\u2019m untrustworthy. One I walked right into. I\u2019d walk right out of it, too, if I could. But there\u2019s Mary to consider. While I didn\u2019t know her, everyone else at Hope\u2019s End seemed to like her. That alone is enough to make me continue to face Detective Vick. Then there\u2019s the fact that Mary was a fellow caregiver. She cared. I owe it to her to try to help make sense of her untimely end. Yet none of that means I need to go easy on Detective Vick. \u201cAre you going to ask me something you don\u2019t already know?\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you just lied to me about liking it here.\u201d \u201cBecause I want to keep my job.\u201d \u201cEven though, according to Mr. Gurlain, you asked for a new one?\u201d \u201cI need to keep my job,\u201d I say through teeth gritted so hard it makes my jaw ache. \u201cThanks to you, this is my only option.\u201d Detective Vick\u2019s mouth drops open, as if he wants to say something but feels he can\u2019t. In that absence of words, I can only wonder what it is. An apology seems unlikely. \u201cYou told Mr. Gurlain you weren\u2019t comfortable here,\u201d he eventually says. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d \u201cThree people were murdered in this house, Detective. Are you comfortable being here?\u201d \u201cYes. Then again, I\u2019m used to crime scenes. Do you think Mary was uncomfortable here?\u201d \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cYou have the same job she did. Surely you can provide some insight into what it\u2019s like caring for Lenora Hope. How is she as a patient?\u201d \u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cAny problems?\u201d Detective Vick says, pressing. \u201cJust the usual growing pains that happen with every patient.\u201d Along with Lenora\u2019s sordid reputation, noises in the night, and the still-eerie fact that she claimed her dead sister was roaming her bedroom. But those are best left unmentioned. Detective Vick has always looked for a reason to not believe me. It\u2019s not a good idea to toss him a few more, even if it leaves him looking disappointed. I think my answer is exactly what he expected to hear. \u201cYou\u2019re not concerned that Lenora Hope might be the person who committed those three murders you just mentioned?\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cI\u2019m not worried she\u2019s going to kill me, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d The detective purses his lips. A surprisingly dainty gesture on a face that\u2019s grown rugged with age. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cBut since you brought it up, do you think Mary was worried about that?\u201d \u201cMaybe, but I doubt it. Lenora\u2019s harmless,\u201d I say, echoing what Carter told me when I first arrived. \u201cDo you think Mary had any problems with Lenora? Or, for that matter, any other aspect of living and working here?\u201d I\u2019ve wondered that myself, especially when I thought Mary had abruptly left in the middle of the night. Even though I now know better, it still tugs at me. Did something about Hope\u2019s End\u2014its history, its quirks, its unidentifiable noises\u2014drive Mary to jump from the terrace? Or could it have been the history and quirks of the person she was caring for? I can think of only one person who might be able to provide some insight. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I know someone who does.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d At last, I\u2019m able to give Detective Vick an answer I know he isn\u2019t expecting. \u201cLenora Hope.\u201d \n NINETEEN I lead the way, guiding Detective Vick up the Grand Stairs. \u201cWatch the bloodstains,\u201d I say dryly as we climb. I swerve around them. Detective Vick walks right over them, not breaking stride. A disappointment. I was hoping he\u2019d react the same way I did the first time I noticed them. I do get a reaction at the top of the stairs, though. Stepping onto the landing, the detective immediately reaches for the wall and says, \u201cWhoa.\u201d \u201cThe mansion\u2019s tilted,\u201d I tell him, as if I\u2019ve been here years and not mere days. \u201cIs that safe?\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cProbably not.\u201d \u201cMan, it wasn\u2019t like this last time I was here.\u201d I stop in the middle of the hallway. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cI used to work here.\u201d Detective Vick removes his hand from the wall, thinks better of it, slaps it back onto the blue damask. \u201cJust for one summer, plus some weekends that spring and fall. Mr. Hope used to hire boys from town when things got busy.\u201d \u201cWhen was this?\u201d \u201cIt was 1929,\u201d the detective says. \u201cI remember because of the murders.\u201d \u201cSo you know Lenora?\u201d \u201cOnly from a distance.\u201d I start off down the hall again, talking over my shoulder to a still-wobbly Detective Vick. \u201cIs that why you became a detective?\u201d \u201cBecause I spent a summer working in a place where there was a triple homicide?\u201d Detective Vick chuckles, as if he finds the idea preposterous. \u201cIt was more than that, I can assure you. Detective work\u2019s a calling. It\u2019s in our blood to find the people who do bad things and make them pay.\u201d Even though I walk ahead of him, I know the detective is shooting daggers at me. I can feel his stare burning the back of my neck. No doubt he thinks I\u2019m someone who did a bad thing and managed to get away. For now. I turn left into Lenora\u2019s room, where she sits in her wheelchair, the Walkman in her lap and earphones on her head. My sudden arrival with a stranger startles her. Her left hand flutters against the blanket laid over her lap and her green eyes go wide. She\u2019d spent most of the day with Archie or Mrs. Baker as I waited downstairs in the sunroom. And while I\u2019m not sure which one of them told Lenora what happened to Mary, it\u2019s clear she knows. Once the surprise fades, her eyes shimmer with grief. Outside, the storm clouds have gotten darker and more menacing, plunging the bedroom into a gloom that feels both suffocating and appropriate. \u201cLenora,\u201d I say as I go to her side. \u201cThis is Detective Vick. He\u2019d like to ask you some questions about Mary. Is that okay?\u201d Lenora stares at him, uncertain. She looks so hesitant that I expect her response to be no. I\u2019m surprised when, after a few more seconds of contemplation, she taps twice against her lap. \u201cTwo taps mean yes,\u201d I explain to Detective Vick. \u201cOne means no.\u201d The detective nods and approaches Lenora the way I first did\u2014with awestruck trepidation. From the way he talked in the sunroom, I suspect the detective thinks Lenora is guilty as sin. Still, he kneels beside her wheelchair on legs made unsteady from the slanted floor and says, \u201cHi, Lenora. I\u2019m sorry about Mary. I heard the two of you were close?\u201d Rather than tap out an answer, she gives a slow, sad nod. \u201cSo you liked her?\u201d Lenora returns to tapping, giving two quick raps. \u201cAnd Mary liked you?\u201d Another two taps. \u201cHow was she as a nurse?\u201d Detective Vick shakes his head. \u201cSorry. There\u2019s no way for you to answer that.\u201d \u201cThere is.\u201d To Lenora, I say, \u201cYou feel like typing your answers?\u201d Before she can tap a response, I wheel Lenora to the desk and insert a fresh sheet of paper into the typewriter. I place her left hand on the keys and turn to Detective Vick. \u201cShe can\u2019t type very fast, so try to ask her things that only require short answers.\u201d \u201cUh, sure.\u201d The detective rubs his hands together, uncertain. I can only assume this is the first time he\u2019s questioned someone via typewriter. \u201cLenora, when was the last time you saw Mary?\u201d Lenora blinks, confused. \u201cHe wants you to type your answer,\u201d I say, gently prodding her. Instead of typing, Lenora stares at the typewriter as if she\u2019s never seen one before. She lifts her hand, hovering it uncertainly over the keys before dropping it back down. The force of the landing hits a key hard enough to slap a single, faint letter onto the blank page. h \u201cDo you need my help?\u201d I ask her. Simmering with impatience, Detective Vick says, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I look to Lenora. Normally so expressive, her face has taken on a frustrating blankness. It dawns on me that this could be too much for her. Mary\u2019s death. The detective\u2019s presence. All his questions. I kneel next to her, put my hand over hers, and say, \u201cAre you too upset about Mary to type?\u201d Beneath my palm, Lenora curls her hand into a fist and raps the keyboard once. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t you doing it?\u201d \u201cDo you even know how to type?\u201d Detective Vick asks her. Again, Lenora gives another single rap. Outside, a gust of wind slams against the mansion, making the whole room\u2014including those of us in it\u2014shudder. Drops of rain smack the windows as the wind howls. The storm has arrived. With it comes another shudder. One only I can feel. An internal shimmy brought on by a single realization. Lenora is pretending. Detective Vick kneels on the other side of her wheelchair. He shoots me an annoyed look and asks Lenora, \u201cJust to be clear, Miss McDeere is lying about you being able to type?\u201d This time, Lenora raises her hand and taps the typewriter twice. My stomach drops. \u201cShe can,\u201d I say. \u201cI swear.\u201d I give Lenora a desperate stare, as if she can confirm what I just said any other way besides actually pressing one of the typewriter keys. But she can\u2019t. And she won\u2019t. For reasons I don\u2019t understand. The storm\u2019s at full force now. Water pours down the windowpanes, casting undulating patterns on the bedroom floor. I watch them, furious at Lenora for making me look like a liar, wondering why she\u2019s doing it, and trying to think of some way to prove I\u2019m right. That\u2019s when it hits me. \u201cWe typed this morning,\u201d I say. \u201cBefore I found Mary. The page is right here on the desk.\u201d I search the desk for the page I know was still in the typewriter when I went downstairs to call Mr. Gurlain. I even remember the words that had been typed on it\u2014Lenora telling me her dead sister was in this room. But the page isn\u2019t on the desk. It doesn\u2019t seem to be anywhere. \u201cIt was just here,\u201d I say, scanning a desktop that contains nothing but a typewriter and a lamp. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a page in the typewriter,\u201d Detective Vick says, maybe trying to be helpful but coming off smug instead. \u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t imagine it?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d I start opening desk drawers, searching for the page that bore Virginia\u2019s name. It\u2019s not in any of them. Nor is it on the floor. I look to Lenora and say, \u201cYou know it was here.\u201d Her left hand remains atop the typewriter keys, motionless and seemingly useless. \u201cTell him I\u2019m not lying, Lenora,\u201d I say, my voice sliding perilously close to outright begging. \u201cPlease.\u201d Detective Vick stands, grabs me by the wrist, and drags me into the hallway, seething. \u201cIs this some kind of game to you, Kit? Because I didn\u2019t believe a word of what you said about your mother, you\u2019ve decided to toy with me?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not toying with you,\u201d I say. \u201cLenora does know how to type. We spent all of yesterday doing it. She\u2019s been telling me what happened the night her family was murdered. I think she plans on either confessing or telling me who really did it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s insane, Kit. The woman can barely sit up. Do you seriously expect me to believe that Lenora Hope is typing her goddamn life story?\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s the truth!\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d Detective Vick says, dripping sarcasm. \u201cLet\u2019s go with that. But why now? After so many years, why has she decided to tell you, of all people, what happened that night?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. But she has told me things.\u201d The words tumble out in a mad rush, so desperate am I to have Detective Vick believe me about something. \u201cAbout the months leading up to the murders. About her family. And her sister. She said the ghost of her sister has been in her room.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t believe that, do you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I say, because I don\u2019t. Not really. Not yet, anyway. \u201cBut I do think something is wrong with this place. It\u2019s . . . not right.\u201d Detective Vick takes a step back and stares at me, his anger dissolving into something else. It looks like pity. \u201cWe\u2019re done talking, Kit,\u201d he says as he pulls a business card from his pocket and presses it into my hand. \u201cCall me if you ever feel like telling the truth.\u201d He stalks off down the hall toward the Grand Stairs. I march back into Lenora\u2019s room. Seeing her at the desk, now in full typewriting mode, makes me break one of the cardinal rules of a Gurlain Home Health Aides employee\u2014no swearing at patients. \u201cWhat the fuck was that about?\u201d Lenora, exuding the patience of a saint, nods for me to join her. She then types two words. im sorry \u201cYou should be. You made me look like a complete liar in front of the detective.\u201d i had to \u201cWhy?\u201d it must be a secret \u201cYou knowing how to type needs to be a secret?\u201d I say. \u201cFrom whom?\u201d everyone It would have been nice to know that before I invited Detective Vick up to her room. Now that I do know\u2014and now that I\u2019ve completely blown my chance of him ever believing me about anything\u2014I feel compelled to ask the same questions I think he would have posed. \u201cDid Mary tell you she was leaving?\u201d Lenora taps once on the keyboard. \u201cThe last time you saw her, how did she act?\u201d Lenora starts typing, stops to give it some thought, starts over. The result is a strange beast of a word. weirnervous I study the word, which is a pretty accurate summation of my own current state. \u201cWhich is it? Weird or nervous?\u201d both, Lenora types. \u201cHad she been acting this way for a while?\u201d Lenora taps the keyboard twice. Yes. \u201cDid Mary ever mention hearing strange noises at night?\u201d She gives the keyboard two more taps. Another yes. I\u2019m hit with a memory of what Jessie told me my first night here. I think she was scared. Hope\u2019s End isn\u2019t a normal house. There\u2019s a darkness here. I can feel it. Mary did. Even though Jessie assured me it was a joke, I\u2019m now starting to think it wasn\u2019t. Not entirely. \u201cDo you know if she ever found out what they were?\u201d I say. Rather than tap, Lenora types out her answer. no \u201cAnd that\u2019s what made her weird and nervous?\u201d Lenora bangs out two more words. and scared My heart hiccups in my chest. So it is true. Maybe Jessie knew because Mary told her or maybe she just subconsciously suspected something was amiss. Either way, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that something at Hope\u2019s End frightened Mary Milton. \u201cWhat was she scared of, Lenora?\u201d I watch Lenora\u2019s hand slide over the keyboard in a way similar to the planchette on Jessie\u2019s Ouija board. Eight keys and one press of the space bar later, I see the answer I\u2019d been expecting all along. my sister \n My sister knew I was in love. Sisters can tell such things. Even ones who never get along, which certainly was the case for the two of us. \u201cWho is it?\u201d she asked on one of those rare occasions we found ourselves in the same room at the same time. Usually we managed to steer clear of each other. But that night we both chose to occupy ourselves in the library. \u201cI have no idea who you\u2019re referring to,\u201d I replied as I sat by the fireplace, reading one of my mother\u2019s romance novels that I ordinarily would have found beneath me. I wanted to write serious literature and normally read only that. I started to feel differently once I fell in love with Ricky. And it was love. Love at first sight, to use the cliche. In my case, though, it was true. The moment I saw Ricky, I knew I was in love with him. It was impossible not to feel that way. Not only was he the most handsome man I\u2019d ever seen, but he understood me in a way no one else did. I could tell from the way he looked at me. He didn\u2019t see a wealthy man\u2019s spoiled daughter, content with flirting and flouncing about in pretty dresses. He saw a young, intelligent woman with hopes, dreams, ambition. He saw the person I wanted myself to be. \u201cYou\u2019re so different from the rest of your family,\u201d he told me that first night, after we\u2019d spent an hour talking on the terrace. \u201cIn a good way, I hope,\u201d I said. \u201cIn a wonderful way.\u201d I let him kiss me then. My first kiss. It was greater than I ever dreamed it could be. When his lips touched mine, it felt as if my entire existence was exploding like a firework. Bright and sparkling and white hot. I pulled away, short of breath and blushing. For a moment, I thought I was going to faint. I swooned against the terrace railing, dizzy. I likely would have fallen over if Ricky hadn\u2019t caught me in his arms and whispered, \u201cWhen can I see you again?\u201d \u201cTomorrow night,\u201d I whispered back, as if I were Juliet and he my Romeo, meeting at my balcony. \u201cRight here.\u201d Two weeks had passed since then, and the two of us saw each other every night. We\u2019d meet on the terrace and rush off somewhere we couldn\u2019t be found. When we were together, the world melted away, turning everything to sheer bliss. When we were apart, he was all I thought about, dreamed about, cared about. We kissed again the second night we met, this time without restraint. We were by the cottage, half hidden in shadow, telling each other our dreams and our disappointments. I told Ricky about wanting to flee to Paris, living like a bohemian, experiencing everything and then writing it down. Ricky told me how, through tough times and hard luck, he came to work here. \u201cMy family is piss-poor,\u201d he said, using a term that both shocked and thrilled me with its crudeness. \u201cMy mother died when she had me. My father\u2019s a mean drunk who\u2019d rather beat me than work. I learned right fast that school was useless. Money beats knowledge every single time. Since I\u2019m good with my hands, I came here.\u201d He sighed and looked up at the sky. \u201cI want more than this, I can tell you that. It\u2019s crushing, not having the life you\u2019re meant to live. It weighs a man down.\u201d I tried to alleviate that weight the only way I knew how, by letting Ricky wrap his thick arms around my waist, pull me close, and kiss me as passionately as he wanted. We were still kissing when I heard the whisper of footfalls in the grass. It was Berniece, returning home from her duties in the kitchen. I broke away and fled before we could be caught. But that close call didn\u2019t change anything. I knew that what Ricky and I were doing was wrong, but I didn\u2019t care. I longed for the fireworks his kiss created. I needed them. We grew more daring with each meeting. Kissing, touching, exploring. On the third night, when Ricky\u2019s hand moved to my breast, I let it remain there. On the fourth night, I slipped my hand into his trousers and grasped his manhood. I\u2019ll spare you the sordid details, but it progressed like that until, exactly one week after the night we met, I allowed Ricky to take my virginity. When it was over, I laid in his arms and whispered, \u201cI love you.\u201d Ricky grinned and said, \u201cI love you, too.\u201d In that moment, I became a woman. I suspect that was the change my sister saw in me that night in the library. \u201cYou\u2019re clearly mad about someone,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I know who it is.\u201d I looked up from my book, numb with worry. Had Berniece seen us? Did she know? Was she now telling others? \u201cWhat have you heard?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d my sister said. \u201cBut it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re in love with Archibald.\u201d I struggled not to laugh as relief poured over me. So many things prevented Archie and me from being together, starting with the fact that he felt more like a sibling to me than my own sister did. \u201cIt\u2019s not Archie,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you still carry a torch for Peter. It\u2019s hopeless. He has no interest in you.\u201d \u201cOr you.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll come around,\u201d my sister said. \u201cI\u2019m certain of it. Then we\u2019ll marry and spend the rest of our days here.\u201d \u201cAt Hope\u2019s End?\u201d My sister spread her arms wide, as if trying to embrace the house itself. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m never going to leave this place.\u201d \u201cBut there\u2019s a whole world out there you haven\u2019t yet seen,\u201d I said. \u201cI, for one, intend to explore as much of it as I can.\u201d \u201cWith your secret boyfriend?\u201d My sister smiled at me, a look I\u2019d seen so many times that it rarely registered how vicious it could be. Her smile contained neither humor nor warmth. It was as cold and calculating as the girl it belonged to. \u201cYou should just go ahead and tell me who he is now. You know I\u2019m going to find out at some point.\u201d In the end, she was right. She eventually did find out, and disaster soon followed. At least she also got her wish. All these years later, she\u2019s still here, roaming the halls. And she\u2019s never going to leave. As long as Hope\u2019s End still stands, my sister will remain. \n TWENTY The third floor of Hope\u2019s End surprises me. Although everything looks the same, save for the top of the Grand Stairs in the center, it feels completely different. Up here, the mansion\u2019s tilt is more pronounced. Something seen and not merely felt. Staring down the hallway from the top of the service stairs is akin to being in the hold of a listing ship. No wonder Carter chooses to stay in the cottage. I have no idea how Jessie and Archie can live up here. I start off down the hall, slightly woozy. The floorboards rasp beneath my feet while from above comes the sound of driving rain hitting the roof. Up ahead, an open door spills out light and music. Jessie\u2019s room, I presume. I doubt Archie listens to the Talking Heads. I\u2019m proven correct when I peek inside and see her sitting cross-legged on the floor, sorting through a stack of Polaroids. \u201cHey,\u201d I say. \u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d A pointless question. It\u2019s obvious to anyone with a set of eyes that Jessie\u2019s not doing well at all. She looks up from the photos, revealing streaks in her makeup left by recent tears. \u201cShitty,\u201d she says. I step into the room, struck by how different it is from mine. While almost identical in shape and size. Jessie has truly made it her own. The walls are covered with posters of bands, some I\u2019m familiar with, most I\u2019ve never heard of. A silk scarf has been thrown over one of the lampshades, giving the room a muted red glow that reminds me of Lenora\u2019s call button. Near the door, the ceiling is standard height. On the other side of the room, it slants dramatically to the dormer windows, one of which is open, letting in the sound of pouring rain\u2014a fitting companion to Jessie\u2019s tears. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Mary\u2019s gone,\u201d she says, holding up one of the Polaroids. I join her on the floor and take the photo from her hand. It shows her and Mary on the terrace, with puffy clouds hanging in the sky behind them and the wind tossing their hair. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen Mary\u2014what was mostly buried under sand at the base of the cliff doesn\u2019t count\u2014and I\u2019m struck by how young she was. Still in her twenties, from the looks of it. And so familiar to me it squeezes my heart. Bright smile, sensible haircut, gold studs in her ears because anything more elaborate would get in the way of the job. A caregiver through and through. I can see why everyone seemed to like her. I think I would have liked her, too. \u201cI knew she couldn\u2019t have left like that,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cNot without saying goodbye or telling me where she was going.\u201d \u201cWhy did you think she left in the first place?\u201d \u201cBecause that\u2019s what Mrs. Baker told us.\u201d \u201cWhy did she think that?\u201d \u201cI guess because that\u2019s what it looked like,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cI should have known not to believe it. Leaving like that wasn\u2019t Mary\u2019s style. Neither is suicide. I don\u2019t care what that detective says. Mary didn\u2019t kill herself.\u201d \u201cSometimes people do things you don\u2019t expect,\u201d I say, thinking about my mother and the way she ended things. No goodbye. No note. No closure. I miss her, but I\u2019m also furious at her for leaving me and my father alone to pick up the pieces. Something, it turns out, we couldn\u2019t do. \u201cMaybe there was something wrong that no one knew about.\u201d \u201cLike what?\u201d Like being tormented by the ghost of Virginia Hope, for starters. But I don\u2019t want to go there just yet. It\u2019s best to ease into the topic. If such a thing is possible. \u201cHow did Mary act the last time you saw her?\u201d Jessie sniffs and wipes her cheek with the back of her hand, turning the mascara streaking her face into a sideways smear. \u201cYou sound just like that detective.\u201d \u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d \u201cThat Mary seemed fine.\u201d Jessie picks up another Polaroid and stares at it while adding a small, quiet, \u201cEven though it wasn\u2019t entirely true.\u201d \u201cSomething seemed wrong?\u201d She nods, drops the Polaroid onto the floor, picks up another one, and shows it to me. It\u2019s Mary in the second-floor hallway, the white of her uniform\u2014possibly the same one I\u2019m now wearing\u2014a stark contrast to her dark surroundings. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell the detective?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jessie says with a shrug. \u201cI guess I was trying to protect Mary.\u201d An urge I understand well. Even after her death, I felt the need to protect my mother. It\u2019s why, in the beginning, I floated the idea that she had no idea how many pills she was taking. That her overdose was accidental, even though everyone knew it wasn\u2019t. I eventually came to realize that instead of protecting her, I was clinging to the idea that she wouldn\u2019t leave my father and me the way she did. Not by choice. \u201cRight now, the best way to help Mary is to find out exactly what happened.\u201d \u201cShe fell,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cThat\u2019s the only explanation.\u201d I\u2019ve heard that tone before from my father. Uncertain confidence. What they\u2019re saying\u2019s not true, Kit-Kat. \u201cMaybe not. Especially if Mary was acting weird or nervous,\u201d I say, purposefully using the two words Lenora had crammed into one. Jessie stares past me to the wall, where a poster of the Eurythmics gazes back at her. \u201cWhy are you so interested in what happened? You didn\u2019t even know Mary.\u201d No, I didn\u2019t. But I am the one who found her. I\u2019m the one who looked down, saw her dead body, and screamed so loud the sound echoed off the back of the house. I\u2019m the one who now fears I\u2019ll be seeing her sand-covered body in my nightmares later tonight. But that\u2019s not my only worry. The main one\u2014the concern that might keep me from sleeping at all\u2014is that what happened to Mary could happen to me, a notion that\u2019s both utterly paranoid and completely rational. We have the same job, the same bedroom, even the same uniform. If something about this job led to Mary\u2019s death, I\u2019d really like to avoid a similar fate. \u201cDid Mary ever mention hearing strange noises at night? Coming from Lenora\u2019s room? Or seeing things?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cHave you?\u201d I don\u2019t answer, which is an answer in itself. Sometimes not saying no means yes. \u201cThe other night, you told me Mary was scared of this place.\u201d \u201cI was joking,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cSo you said.\u201d I pause again. \u201cBut I think there might have been some truth to it.\u201d Although Jessie begins to respond with a shake of her head, it soon changes direction, swerving upward into a tentative nod. She muddies things further by saying, \u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know anymore.\u201d \u201cDid Mary ever say outright she was scared?\u201d \u201cYeah, but it was, like, obviously as a joke. Both of us joked about it all the time. Stupid shit like, \u2018I just saw Virginia in the hallway. She says hello.\u2019 Dumb things like that to lighten the mood. God knows, this place needs it. But then Mary stopped playing along.\u201d I lean in, curious. \u201cWhen was this?\u201d \u201cA few weeks ago. I\u2019d make a joke about Virginia or Winston Hope and Mary would shake her head and be like, \u2018Don\u2019t say stuff like that.\u2019 She became real serious about everything. Like she was actually scared.\u201d \u201cOf Virginia?\u201d I say, thinking of the things Lenora had typed. That Virginia was in her room. That Mary was afraid of her. \u201cMaybe?\u201d Jessie returns her attention to the Polaroids on the floor. They\u2019re all faceup, a dozen images of Mary that Jessie slides around like a tarot card reader. \u201cI know I\u2019m making it sound like Mary was some kind of weirdo scaredy-cat. She wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think she believed in ghosts. But . . .\u201d \u201cBut what?\u201d I say, pressing. \u201cSomething seemed to spook her,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what. Maybe she really did see the ghost of Virginia Hope. Or maybe she just didn\u2019t want to joke about it anymore. Probably because she\u2019d been spending a lot of time with Lenora.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s part of the job,\u201d I say. \u201cConstant care.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m talking, like, a lot of time. Maybe she thought it was disrespectful or something.\u201d \u201cDid Mary ever mention a guy named Ricardo Mayhew?\u201d Jessie scrunches her face. \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cHe used to work here,\u201d I say. \u201cCarter told me about him.\u201d \u201cNever heard of the guy,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cIf Mary knew who he was, she never told me. And I don\u2019t know why she wouldn\u2019t. She told me everything else about this place. She probably knew more about the Hope family murders than anyone except Lenora.\u201d One particular Polaroid in the pile catches my attention. Taken in Lenora\u2019s room, it shows Lenora and Mary at the desk. Lenora\u2019s in her wheelchair, hunched over the typewriter. Mary\u2019s behind her, leaning in close. A sight so familiar it stings. I pick it up and show it to Jessie. \u201cWhen was this taken?\u201d \u201cA couple weeks ago.\u201d Jessie plucks the photo from my fingers and arranges it in a pile with the others. \u201cThey were always typing.\u201d \u201cDo you know what?\u201d \u201cMary never told me,\u201d Jessie says as she stands and crosses the room to her dresser, where she drops the Polaroids into the top drawer. \u201cAt first, I thought it was some kind of physical therapy. You know, working on Lenora\u2019s motor skills. But they were there all the time. Sometimes even after Lenora was supposed to have been put to bed.\u201d She moves to a tape recorder sitting atop the dresser next to a hardcover copy of Lace with a library sticker on its spine. She pops a cassette from the recorder and hands it to me. \u201cThis is for Lenora. Part one of the new book. Maybe it\u2019ll take her mind off everything.\u201d \u201cThanks.\u201d I pocket the cassette and head to the door. Before leaving, I turn back to Jessie and say, \u201cDid anyone else know about the typing?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cI only knew because I walked in on them one night. I thought it would be a cool picture, so I stood in the doorway and took it before they realized I was there. Mary kind of freaked out about it. She made me swear not to tell anyone. I probably shouldn\u2019t have even told you.\u201d But I\u2019m glad she did. Because now I know why Mary knew so much about the Hope family and what happened that night. Lenora told her. \n I see that look you\u2019re giving me. I\u2019m more observant than people give me credit for. And right now I can tell that you think you won\u2019t like where all this is going. You won\u2019t. But I promised to tell you everything, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m giving you. My deepest, darkest secrets. Things I\u2019ve never told anyone before. Only you, Mary. Only you. \n TWENTY-ONE The fingers of Lenora\u2019s left hand sit atop the typewriter, atypically still. Under normal circumstances, they\u2019d be sliding from key to key, slowly but surely adding words to the blank page I\u2019ve wound into the carriage. But these circumstances are anything but normal. A pall has settled over the house now that the police have left. The place is quiet and the mood somber. A resident of Hope\u2019s End is gone, and while I never knew Mary Milton, I feel her loss all the same. We were alike in so many ways. More than I ever imagined. That\u2019s why I brought Lenora to the typewriter after dinner instead of guiding her through her circulation exercises. An infraction I know Mrs. Baker wouldn\u2019t approve of. I stand next to Lenora, hugging myself despite the gray cardigan thrown over my uniform. Although the storm has passed, it\u2019s left behind a damp chill that seeps through the windows, giving her room the shivery air of a ghost ship. Fitting, seeing how on the desk next to the typewriter is the page Lenora had typed on earlier. Two words catch my eye. my sister \u201cWhy did you lie to me about Mary being scared of your sister?\u201d Lenora looks up at me, apprehension flashing in her green eyes. Then she types. it wasnt a lie \u201cYour sister is dead, Lenora,\u201d I say, tightening my cardigan around me. \u201cAnd ghosts don\u2019t exist. So you\u2019ll have to do better than that to hide the fact that you and Mary spent a lot of time typing.\u201d Lenora can\u2019t hide her surprise. She tries, but her expressive face betrays her. There\u2019s a slant to her lips and a twitch at her right eye, like she\u2019s working hard to keep it from widening. \u201cYou were telling her your story, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Lenora taps twice against the typewriter. With it comes a twinge of disappointment that I wasn\u2019t the only person she trusted enough to tell. I\u2019d thought I was special and that there was a specific reason Lenora chose me. Now I have no idea why she\u2019s doing it. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? Or Detective Vick?\u201d Lenora slowly pecks the keys. it had to be a secret \u201cWho decided that? You or Mary?\u201d mary \u201cAnd whose idea was it to start typing your story?\u201d Rather than signal for me to hit the return bar, Lenora types Mary\u2019s name a second time, running it together with the first. marymary I\u2019m not surprised, given that Jessie told me Mary had been obsessed with the Hope family massacre. She said it might have even been the reason Mary took the job caring for Lenora. If that\u2019s true, then it makes sense she would want to hear Lenora\u2019s version of things. \u201cThat\u2019s why she bought the typewriter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I say. \u201cShe wanted you to write it all down for her.\u201d This brings another two taps from Lenora. \u201cDid you want to?\u201d Lenora thinks about it a moment, her face falling into that pensive expression I\u2019ve come to know so well. When she types, her response is as rambling as I imagine her thoughts to be. Further evidence that what she\u2019d typed with me had all been written before. The second draft, so to speak. not at first i didnt want to talk about what happened because the memories make me sad but i loved the idea of writing again so i told her yes \u201cHow long had you been working on it?\u201d weeks Even though I\u2019m pretty sure I already know the answer, I say, \u201cSo what you typed with me, you also typed with her?\u201d Lenora taps twice before typing additional information. and more \u201cHow much more? About you and Ricky?\u201d Lenora keeps typing. Ten keys she presses slowly and deliberately, making the importance of her response clear. everything \u201cWhen did you finish telling her?\u201d Lenora doesn\u2019t need to think about it. the night she left My stomach suddenly drops. Mary knew everything about the night of the murders\u2014including who did it, how they did it, why they did it. And the day she learned all that, she\u2014 Jumped. That\u2019s what I should be thinking, since it\u2019s what Detective Vick said happened. Yet it feels wrong. Like a lie. Instead, a different word ricochets through my brain. Died. That\u2019s the brutal truth. And it can\u2019t be a coincidence. \u201cDid Mary ever tell you why it needed to be a secret?\u201d Lenora types instead of taps. yes She then adds three more words to the line. she was scared I glance again to the page beside the typewriter, onto which Lenora had typed the same answer to a different question. As I do, a thought occurs to me. Something I should have considered sooner but was likely too scared myself to contemplate. But now there\u2019s no avoiding it. \u201cLenora, did you really think Mary left?\u201d I study her face\u2014the key to all her emotions. Even the ones she\u2019s trying to hide. This time, though, she doesn\u2019t even attempt to disguise the way she feels. Sadness clouds her features as she taps once against the typewriter. No. \u201cYou thought she jumped?\u201d Another single tap. One that kicks my pulse up a notch. \u201cDo\u2014\u201d I swallow. My mouth, suddenly dry from fear, can barely get the word out. \u201cDo you think what happened to Mary is because of what you told her?\u201d Two taps from Lenora confirm my worst fear. She thinks Mary was murdered. Swirling within that dreadful realization is another, smaller thought. One brought about by another quick glimpse of the page next to the typewriter. \u201cWhat did Mary do with the pages the two of you typed?\u201d Lenora responds with a confused look. \u201cShe helped you write the whole story.\u201d I think about the pages the two of us have typed, now sitting with Lenora\u2019s pill bottles in the lockbox under my bed. If Mary and Lenora had typed for weeks, why haven\u2019t I seen any evidence of it? Every piece of paper inside the desk is blank, and I saw no sign of typed pages anywhere else in Lenora\u2019s room or mine. \u201cThat must have been a thick stack. What did Mary do with them?\u201d Lenora\u2019s reply\u2014she hid them\u2014doesn\u2019t help me. \u201cDo you know where?\u201d This time, her response provides a bit more clarity. in her room A bad feeling skitters down my back. What had once been Mary\u2019s room is now my room\u2014and the truth about the murders has been hidden there all this time. A truth that might have gotten Mary killed. The rest of the evening passes with agonizing slowness. I bathe, dress, and lift Lenora into bed, the whole time telling myself that we could be mistaken. Maybe Mary really did jump. Maybe she had deep wells of despair within her that she could no longer control. Maybe this is just another sad chapter in the overall tragic story of Hope\u2019s End. Or maybe she was murdered because she knew that story. After leaving Lenora with the call button, I go to my room and conduct a thorough search. Since all of Mary\u2019s belongings are here, it stands to reason that whatever she and Lenora typed is still in here as well. Where, I have no clue. But I\u2019m determined to find out. I begin with the dresser, removing Mary\u2019s clothes until every drawer is empty. I even check behind the dresser and beneath it. There\u2019s nothing. Next is the bed, both under it and between the mattress and the box spring. The only item of interest is my lockbox. I open it with the key from the nightstand and check its contents. A stack of typewritten pages and six bottles of pills. After that, I do a scan of the bookshelf, thinking the pages could be tucked among all the books Mary had left behind, and check the bathroom for potential hiding spots. Both yield no results. The last place I look is the closet, since I did a thorough inspection of it the night I arrived. Nevertheless, I check Mary\u2019s medical bag, root through her coat pockets, and check the box on the floor that had once held books but now holds nothing. I stand, wiping the front of my uniform, and stare at the patch of clean floor next to the box. Unlike my uniform, it\u2019s free of dust, as if something had sat there until very recently. I noticed it my first night here but gave it little thought. Now, though, I can\u2019t help but wonder what used to be there\u2014and when it was removed. I take a closer look. The dust-free area is rectangular, which would suggest a second box if not for the rounded corners. That means it was something else. Like a suitcase. Mary was a caregiver. She knew the score. A box and suitcase are all we need. With adrenaline buzzing through me, I grab my suitcase and bring it to the closet. With a nervous breath, I place it over the clean patch. It\u2019s like the uniform\u2014not an exact fit, but close enough. As I lift the suitcase from the closet, I notice something that amps up my adrenaline level from a buzz to a roar. On each end of the handle is a metal ring attaching it to the suitcase itself. Each ring is about the same shape and size of the bent piece of metal I found on the terrace. Everything goes sideways, as if Hope\u2019s End is finally, inexorably tipping into the ocean. But it\u2019s only me, shell-shocked by the realization that Mary took a suitcase with her when she left. Inside that suitcase might have been the typewritten truth about Lenora and the night her family died. Now, like Mary, it\u2019s gone. I stagger into the hallway and down the service stairs. The crack in the stairwell, I notice, has gotten larger. It now runs the entire height of the wall, with a second, smaller crack branching out of it. Another crack has formed on the opposite wall. At this rate, the whole stairwell will soon be webbed with them. I shudder, thinking of spiders and flies and sticky strands of cobwebs clinging to my skin. In the kitchen, I head straight to the phone and dial the number printed on the card Detective Vick gave me. The phone rings six times before he answers with a groggy \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Kit McDeere.\u201d \u201cKit.\u201d There\u2019s a rustle as the detective no doubt checks the clock on his nightstand. I do the same with the kitchen clock. Just before midnight. \u201cDo you know what time it is?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I say, my bluntness making it clear I don\u2019t care. \u201cBut I thought you\u2019d like to know that Mary Milton didn\u2019t jump.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think happened to her?\u201d Detective Vick says after a disconcerted pause. I pause myself, trying to collect my thoughts. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m thinking it, let alone about to say it. Yet I do, the words tumbling out with unforced urgency. \u201cShe was pushed.\u201d \n TWENTY-TWO Here\u2019s a question I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll regret,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cBut why do you think Mary Milton was pushed?\u201d \u201cThere was a suitcase in her room.\u201d \u201cAnd?\u201d \u201cNow it\u2019s gone.\u201d \u201cAnd?\u201d \u201cMary took it with her.\u201d Detective Vick sighs. \u201cYou have exactly one minute to explain.\u201d I waste not a second trying to get him to believe the unbelievable. A tall order for someone so skeptical. Yet I do my best, telling him about the bare patch in the closet, how I think it was created by a suitcase recently removed from the bedroom, and why I suspect Mary left the house with it the night she died. \u201cIf she intended to kill herself, why would she take a suitcase with her?\u201d \u201cI have no idea,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cBecause she wasn\u2019t planning to leave,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s why everything else she owned is still here. Mary intended to come back.\u201d \u201cI suppose you also have a theory about what was inside this alleged suitcase.\u201d \u201cThe truth about the Hope family murders.\u201d The sudden squeak of bedsprings tells me the detective just sat up. I finally have his undivided attention. \u201cI think Mary came here with the intention of finding out what really happened that night,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd she did. Because Lenora told her.\u201d \u201cLet me guess,\u201d Detective Vick wearily says. \u201cShe typed it.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cKit, we already\u2014\u201d I cut him off, unwilling to give him yet another chance to call me a liar. \u201cI know you think I\u2019m making this up, but Lenora can type. I have an entire stack of pages I can show you. All typed by Lenora. And if you still don\u2019t believe me, there\u2019s photographic proof. Jessie has a picture of Mary and Lenora typing together. They were doing it in secret. With Mary\u2019s help, Lenora wrote about everything that happened the night her family was killed. When they finished, I think Mary planned to go public with it. She took what Lenora typed, put it in her suitcase, and left. But someone at Hope\u2019s End knew what she had planned and stopped her before she could do it.\u201d \u201cBy pushing her to her death?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhy would someone do that?\u201d \u201cBecause they didn\u2019t want the truth to get out.\u201d There\u2019s silence on Detective Vick\u2019s end. Either he\u2019s thinking over what I\u2019ve said or is on the verge of hanging up. It turns out to be the former, although from his tone, the latter still feels like an option. \u201cThis all sounds pretty outlandish, Kit.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not lying,\u201d I say. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you were. I think you sincerely believe it\u2019s what happened.\u201d \u201cBut you don\u2019t.\u201d Pain throbs at my temples. A headache\u2019s brewing, no doubt caused by lack of sleep and an abundance of frustration. \u201cWhat part don\u2019t you believe?\u201d \u201cAll of it,\u201d Detective Vick replies. \u201cFirst of all, do you know how hard it is to shove someone over a railing?\u201d \u201cNot this railing,\u201d I say, remembering the way it hit the small of my back, sending me off-balance enough to make me fear I was about to flip over it. \u201cIt\u2019s short.\u201d \u201cDuly noted. But you also said Mary put everything she and Lenora typed into this suitcase. Where do you think she was taking it?\u201d \u201cYou, most likely.\u201d A wild guess based on my own instincts. Lenora had just told her everything about the town\u2019s most infamous crime. I haven\u2019t given any thought about what I\u2019ll do when Lenora finishes telling me what happened. But my gut tells me I\u2019d take it to the police. \u201cMary had the truth about that night.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s the first of many holes in this theory of yours,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cMary\u2019s time of death was around two a.m. Do you really think she\u2019d be going to the police at that hour?\u201d I look to the kitchen window. Outside, there\u2019s just enough moonlight to make out the railing running the length of the terrace. I imagine Mary there, bathed in a similar glow, flipping over the railing and vanishing out of sight. \u201cHow do you know when she died?\u201d \u201cBecause it was low tide,\u201d Vick says. \u201cMary disappeared on Monday night. Low tide that day was shortly after two a.m. If there had been any water there, her body would have been swept out to sea. Instead, Mary hit the exposed beach and died upon impact. When the tide came in, she got buried in sand.\u201d I get another image of Mary. One I don\u2019t need to imagine because I saw it. Her corpse mostly covered by sand and seafoam. I close my eyes and turn away from the kitchen window. \u201cBut there\u2019s a suitcase missing from her belongings,\u201d I say. \u201cThere very well could be,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cBut a week passed between Mary\u2019s death and your arrival. During that time, anyone could have taken it from the room. Why are you so certain Mary had it with her?\u201d \u201cI found a piece of it on the terrace.\u201d \u201cYou did?\u201d Detective Vick\u2019s tone changes from dismissive to interested in a snap. I allow myself a smile, even though he can\u2019t see it. It feels warranted. A small moment of triumph. \u201cA metal hook that attaches the handle to the suitcase. It was bent and lying on the ground, making me think the handle broke when someone snatched the suitcase from Mary.\u201d \u201cNow we\u2019re getting somewhere,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cDo you still have it?\u201d My smile falls away. \u201cI lost it.\u201d Detective Vick doesn\u2019t ask how, and I don\u2019t volunteer that information. Telling him I dropped it when I almost fell off the terrace will only make him more convinced that what happened to Mary wasn\u2019t murder. Not that he doubts himself in any way. \u201cI knew it,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt. I really did. But please, enough of this bullshit.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not bullshit.\u201d \u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to do, Kit. It\u2019s the exact same thing you attempted this afternoon. You\u2019re taking what happened to Mary\u2014a very serious, very tragic event\u2014and twisting it into a way to ease your guilt.\u201d \u201cMy guilt? You still think I\u2019m making all of this up?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not blaming you,\u201d Detective Vick continues, as if I\u2019ve said nothing at all. \u201cI don\u2019t even think you\u2019re aware you\u2019re doing it. But it\u2019s obvious what\u2019s happening. Your mother took her own life. How big of a role you played in that is still up for debate.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not up for debate. It was an accident.\u201d \u201cSo you keep trying to convince me,\u201d Detective Vick says. I want to scream. And cry. And rip the phone off the wall and smash it against the kitchen floor. Considering its age and my rage, I suspect I\u2019m capable of it. But common sense grips me harder than frustration. If I sound hysterical, Detective Vick will be convinced that I am. Which is clearly the only thing I can convince him of. \u201cI am telling you I think a woman was murdered,\u201d I say. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you take that seriously? Shouldn\u2019t you at least investigate it?\u201d Detective Vick sighs. \u201cI have investigated it. After talking to you and everyone else at that house, my conclusion is that Mary Milton took her own life.\u201d \u201cHow can you be so certain?\u201d \u201cThe coroner\u2019s preliminary findings show that her injuries are consistent with a fall from that height. There were no defensive wounds, which there would likely have been if she had been attacked in the manner you suggest. I had officers search the grounds, the beach, even the terrace. They found nothing to indicate there was a suitcase or a struggle or a murder. In fact, they found nothing at all.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cI\u2019m not the person you thought I was.\u201d I grip the receiver tight, flummoxed. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cMary\u2019s suicide note. That\u2019s what it said. \u2018I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not the person you thought I was.\u2019 Found neatly folded in the pocket of her uniform. The paper sustained heavy water damage, but it was still readable. Now, give me one reason not to hang up right now.\u201d \u201cLenora didn\u2019t kill her family,\u201d I say, more out of desperation than anything else. I certainly have no plan. But I hope dropping a bombshell like that will keep Detective Vick listening. \u201cAt least, I don\u2019t think she did. We haven\u2019t gotten that far yet.\u201d \u201cWe?\u201d \u201cMe and Lenora. I told you, we\u2019re typing her story, just like she did with Mary. But there was a worker here. Ricardo Mayhew.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cI used to work there, remember?\u201d \u201cDid you also know Lenora was in love with him? And that it\u2019s possible he\u2019s the one who killed her parents and sister? I\u2019m pretty sure Lenora knew he did it and covered for him. Now I think she wants to come clean, maybe in the hopes that he\u2019ll be caught, even though he vanished the night of the murders.\u201d When I finally give Detective Vick a chance to speak, his voice wavers between intrigue and wariness. \u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d \u201cYou have access to the police report from that night,\u201d I say. \u201cLook at it and see. You\u2019ll also see that there\u2019s a whole lot of unanswered questions from that night. Mary had those answers. Now she\u2019s dead. That\u2019s not a coincidence. And it\u2019s sure as hell not suicide.\u201d I hang up before Detective Vick can poke another hole in my theory, tell me I\u2019m wrong, and then smugly trot out some other bit of evidence to prove it. I know I\u2019m on to something here. And it terrifies me. Because Lenora\u2019s also telling me her story, I could be next. Yet that\u2019s not the scariest part of all this. The truly chilling, scarier-than-Stephen-King part is that Mary wasn\u2019t killed by some random stranger. In a twisted way, that would put me more at ease. But whoever pushed her off the terrace knew what she was up to. They knew her. Which means it was likely someone at Hope\u2019s End. Other than me and Lenora, only four people fit that description\u2014Mrs. Baker, Archie, Carter, and Jessie. Why one of them would feel the need to kill Mary over something Lenora typed is beyond me. I reach for the phone again, itching to call Detective Vick back. He needs to hear this, even if it\u2019s doubtful he\u2019ll believe me. He hasn\u2019t yet. About anything. I\u2019m about to dial when I hear a noise behind me. Footsteps. Moving from the darkened dining room into the kitchen. I whirl around to see Carter halt in the doorway. Hands raised in innocence, he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d Yet he did. My heart pounds so loud I suspect he can hear it. Adding to the pounding is this: Carter is one of the four people who could have shoved Mary off the terrace. He sways slightly as he steps fully into the kitchen. He\u2019s been drinking. A truth he acknowledges with an unapologetic \u201cIt\u2019s been a shitty day.\u201d I remain with my hand on the phone, frozen. \u201cIt has.\u201d \u201cI was out on the terrace and heard someone on the phone. Thought I\u2019d come in and investigate.\u201d \u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d \u201cSome of it.\u201d \u201cSome of it or all of it?\u201d \u201cMost of it,\u201d Carter says. \u201cAnd I get why you\u2019re nervous right now. You should be. But not around me. I knew what Mary was doing.\u201d \u201cThen tell me.\u201d \u201cShe was trying to help me.\u201d Carter crosses the kitchen, drawing closer. Close enough for me to smell the whiskey on his breath. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s my fault she died.\u201d \u201cYou have exactly one minute to tell me what you mean by that,\u201d I say, fully aware that I sound exactly like Detective Vick. \u201cNot here,\u201d Carter says. I stay where I am. \u201cYes, here.\u201d I\u2019m not about to walk off alone with a killer. If that\u2019s what Carter is. While his words make it sound like he\u2019s about to confess, his body language says otherwise. Hunched and shambling, he appears incapable of harm. But appearances can be deceiving. \u201cThere\u2019s something you need to see,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cAnd I can\u2019t show you here. So you\u2019re just going to have to trust me for five minutes.\u201d \u201cYou said Mary was helping you?\u201d \u201cShe was, yeah,\u201d Carter says. \u201cAnd now I want to help her by finding out what really happened. Because she didn\u2019t jump. I know that, and judging by that phone call you just made, you know it, too.\u201d The fact that he believes me is the only reason I follow Carter to his cottage. Even then, I make him walk several paces ahead of me, hands where I can see them. Once inside the cottage, I stay by the door in case I need to make a run for it. But Carter\u2019s movements are anything but threatening. After clearing the almost-empty whiskey bottle from the table, he pours himself a cup of black coffee to sober up. \u201cWant some?\u201d he says. \u201cCoffee or whiskey?\u201d \u201cTake your pick.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d rather see what it is you needed to show me so bad,\u201d I say. \u201cIn a minute.\u201d Carter sits at his table for two and takes a sip of coffee. \u201cFirst, I need to admit something. I lied about why I took a job here.\u201d I edge a half step toward the door. \u201cIf you want me to trust you, that\u2019s the wrong way of doing it.\u201d \u201cIt is indeed,\u201d Carter says. \u201cBut it\u2019s important you know that. Now, remember that regular customer I told you about? The one who used to work here and suggested I take his place?\u201d \u201cI do,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I\u2019m assuming he had a name.\u201d \u201cAnthony,\u201d Carter replies. \u201cAlthough everyone called him Tony. Well, Tony did more than suggest I work here. He insisted on it.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cHe worked here for decades. Knew all the nooks and crannies. One day, he was poking around in the rooms above the garage. Some of the servants used to live there.\u201d \u201cI thought they lived in the house or this cottage,\u201d I say. \u201cIn its heyday, Hope\u2019s End was overrun with servants. There was a mechanic whose sole job was to look after Winston Hope\u2019s collection of Packards. He had five of them. Archie told me that Mrs. Baker had to sell them over the years to help pay for this place\u2019s upkeep.\u201d It\u2019s strange to consider how populated Hope\u2019s End once was. Every room filled, including ones over the garage. A small village atop a windswept cliff, all here to serve one outlandishly wealthy family. \u201cAfter the murders, the rooms above the garage were used for storage,\u201d Carter says after another sip of coffee. \u201cBoxes of stuff from the twenties, even earlier. It was winter and there wasn\u2019t much to do around the grounds, so Tony decided to make himself useful and get rid of whatever was in those boxes. Most of it was junk. Moth-eaten clothes, cracked plates, stuff from people who worked here way back when. Basically, all the stuff they left behind when this place cleared out.\u201d Carter retreats to the sleeping area of the cottage and pulls an envelope from its hiding place under his mattress. When he brings it to the table, I join him there, my caution overruled by curiosity. \u201cIn one of those boxes, Tony found this.\u201d He removes something flat from the envelope and slides it toward me, facedown. From its shape and sepia color, I can tell it\u2019s a photograph. An old one, as evidenced by the date scribbled on the back. September 1929 I pick it up, turn it over, and see it\u2019s a picture of Lenora in her youth. By now, I have no problem recognizing her. Even if I did, the divan Lenora sits on and the wallpaper behind her give it away. It\u2019s her bedroom through and through. A photographic re-creation of the portrait in the hallway. The only differences between the two are the dress\u2014the one Lenora wears in the photo is flowing cotton instead of satin\u2014and her position. Gone is the studied pose from the painting. Instead, Lenora leans against the back of the divan in a fashion that\u2019s anything but ladylike, her hands resting over her rounded stomach. I go numb with shock. \u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cThat can\u2019t be.\u201d But the photograph doesn\u2019t lie. A month before her family was slaughtered, Lenora Hope had been pregnant. \n It was an accident, Mary. Or foolishness. Or likely a bit of both. Ricky and I were too besotted with each other--and, yes, brimming with lust--to think about the consequences. Not that I knew what they were. No one had thought to teach me about the birds and the bees. What little I knew of sex had been gleaned from the records my sister loved to listen to. Songs of mischief and romance that made it all seem like harmless fun. And it was incredibly fun. Ricky brought me pleasure in ways I didn\u2019t think possible. When someone makes you feel that good, it\u2019s hard to pay attention to the fact it could all go bad. In hindsight, I suppose it was inevitable that I would get pregnant. I could tell immediately, by the way, despite my limited knowledge. Between the morning sickness, my insatiable appetite, and my missed period, I knew without a doubt I was pregnant. What I didn\u2019t know was what to do about it. I waited weeks before telling Ricky, fearing he\u2019d react badly to the news. I\u2019d read many books in which women in my position were treated poorly by the men who put them there. I feared I\u2019d be just like those doomed characters. That Ricky wouldn\u2019t believe me or, worse, run away, leaving me all alone in my very dire predicament. To my relief and surprise, he was elated. \u201cSo you\u2019re happy about this?\u201d I asked after I told him. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a father,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m overjoyed!\u201d But both of us knew we were in a tricky situation, for so many reasons. Ricky told me he needed time to plan, and I did, too. Our unexpected joy thus became our biggest secret. One that was surprisingly easy for me to keep. No one paid me much mind to begin with, so it went mostly unnoticed when I started gaining weight. Yes, I heard tut-tutting from my mother\u2019s maid when I asked her to let out my clothes an inch or two. And of course I noticed the servant girls stifle their judgmental giggles when I requested a second helping at dinner. I didn\u2019t mind that everyone thought I was simply getting fat. It meant that no one suspected the truth. Those five months or so were the happiest I\u2019d ever been. For the first time in my life, I didn\u2019t feel alone. I always had someone with me--a constant companion right there in my belly. I took great--albeit secret--pride in knowing I was about to bring another life into this world. Gone was the girl who\u2019d considered jumping from the terrace on her birthday. I was now a woman with a purpose. The thought of bearing a child and raising it with Ricky made me hopeful about the future. One evening in early September, I snuck Ricky up to my room to discuss that future. It was a Tuesday, and the house was mostly empty. Miss Baker had been given the night off with the rest of the servants, which was customary every other Tuesday, and my sister had gone off with friends. My father was gone as well, heading to Boston on some emergency business. The London stock exchange had just crashed, and there were growing fears the same thing would happen here. Since I knew my mother wasn\u2019t about to leave her room--or her laudanum--I felt confident I could bring Ricky upstairs and we could share a bed like a proper couple. We made love that night. Tenderly at first, mindful of the child growing in my womb. But lust soon took over, as it always did, and Ricky ravaged me in a way I never knew I wanted or needed. Afterward, as we contently laid together, I pictured our lives being exactly like that night. Just me, Ricky, and the baby, together in a small cottage somewhere far away from Hope\u2019s End. \u201cI wish things were different and we didn\u2019t have to sneak around like this,\u201d Ricky said as he held me in his arms. \u201cI wish I was a better man.\u201d I looked at him, concerned. \u201cWhat do you mean? You\u2019re wonderful.\u201d \u201cHardly,\u201d Ricky said with a dismissive sniff. \u201cYou deserve better than what I have to offer. You--and our child--deserve a man who can take care of you properly. I\u2019ve been saving for months and yet I still barely have two nickels to scrape together.\u201d He tried to slide out of bed, but I clung to him, keeping him from leaving. \u201cIf it\u2019s money you\u2019re worrying about, don\u2019t. My family has plenty.\u201d \u201cI refuse to take a penny from your father,\u201d Ricky said. I wasn\u2019t talking about my father, whom I\u2019d started to suspect didn\u2019t have as much money as he claimed. Recently, when passing his office, I\u2019d heard a heated phone call between him and the man who managed his company\u2019s finances. \u201cWhat do you mean the money\u2019s no longer there?\u201d he shouted into the phone. \u201cWhat happened to it?\u201d I was referring to me and my sister, who were set to inherit the sizable fortune left behind by my grandparents. They had neither liked nor trusted my father, and when they died, they left nothing to their only daughter out of fear it would be squandered. Instead, their money was split between me and my sister and placed in a trust that neither of us could access until we turned eighteen. \u201cI\u2019m talking about my money,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, what will soon be mine.\u201d Even about that, I wasn\u2019t certain. The main reason I hadn\u2019t yet told my family I was pregnant was out of fear they\u2019d disown me once they found out. That seemed the likeliest course of action, considering Ricky\u2019s situation and status. Add in the fact that we had conceived out of wedlock and it was a recipe for disappointment, anger, and punishment. If it weren\u2019t for the money, I wouldn\u2019t have minded being disowned. I hated Hope\u2019s End and wanted nothing more to do with it. That humble cottage with Ricky and our child was all I needed. Ricky seemed shocked by the prospect of possessing money he hadn\u2019t earned. \u201cWhat kind of man would I be if I let you pay our way?\u201d \u201cThe man I love,\u201d I said. He finally freed himself from my grasp and reached for his trousers. \u201cCan you love a man with zero pride? Because that\u2019s what I\u2019d become. I\u2019m not some charity case.\u201d I watched, hurt, as Ricky slid on his pants and began pacing the room, his hands shoved into his empty pockets. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, you did.\u201d \u201cThen forget my money. We\u2019ll figure something out, even if it\u2019ll be hard at times.\u201d Ricky stopped pacing long enough to glare at me. \u201cHard? You don\u2019t know the meaning of the word. Have you ever worked a day in your life?\u201d \u201cI never needed to,\u201d I admitted. \u201cAnd that\u2019s your problem,\u201d Ricky said. \u201cYou and your family sit around all day letting the rest of us do the real work. If the shoe was on the other foot, I bet none of you would last a day.\u201d I\u2019d never seen him angry before, and the only reaction I had was to start crying. I tried to hold the tears back, but they fell anyway, streaming down my cheeks. Ricky\u2019s tone softened as soon as he saw them. Pulling me close, he said, \u201cHey now. No need for that. I\u2019ll think of something. It\u2019ll just take a little more time. Don\u2019t you worry about a thing.\u201d Because Ricky told me not to, I didn\u2019t. A mistake, Mary. For there was much to worry about. But don\u2019t think for a second that this is simply a tale of a young girl used and discarded by a callous man. There\u2019s more to it than that. Nearly everyone at Hope\u2019s End played a role in what happened--and most paid dearly for it. Including me. Especially me. \n TWENTY-THREE The photograph remains on the table, Lenora staring out from it in shades of sepia. Minutes have passed since I first saw it, yet I remain flabbergasted. Lenora was pregnant. And even though she hasn\u2019t revealed it yet, I\u2019m pretty sure Ricardo Mayhew was the father. What I can\u2019t begin to understand is what this has to do with Mary. Or, for that matter, Carter. \u201cWhy did your friend Tony insist you work here?\u201d I say. \u201cBecause of this picture?\u201d Carter nods. He\u2019s sobered up in the past few minutes, likely from a combination of coffee and confession. Although what he\u2019s confessing is far from what I expected. \u201cI started working here because I needed to know.\u201d \u201cKnow what?\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m Lenora Hope\u2019s grandson.\u201d \u201cI still don\u2019t understand,\u201d I say. \u201cOn Christmas morning in 1929, a baby was left at the front door of the Episcopal church in town,\u201d Carter says. \u201cThe baby was freezing, barely alive. Because it was Christmas, the priest who found him got to the church earlier than normal. If he\u2019d arrived even a few minutes later, the baby would have died. That\u2019s why the church called it a Christmas miracle.\u201d \u201cThat baby,\u201d I say. \u201cHe was\u2014\u201d Carter, like me, can\u2019t stop looking at the picture of Lenora. \u201cMy father, yeah. He was adopted by a young couple at the church who couldn\u2019t have children. My grandparents. My father never tried to find out who his birth parents were, mostly because he had no idea where to start looking. Besides, he was literally abandoned. Why bother trying to find someone who didn\u2019t want you? So my birth grandparents remained a mystery. Until Tony found this photo.\u201d \u201cWhy did he think your grandmother is Lenora?\u201d \u201cBecause of the date,\u201d Carter says, tapping the photo. \u201cHow many months pregnant does she look to you?\u201d I peer again at the picture. \u201cSix?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought, too. Which means her ninth month would have been\u2014\u201d \u201cAround Christmas,\u201d I say. \u201cExactly.\u201d Carter doesn\u2019t elaborate, nor does he need to. Since there\u2019s no child of Lenora\u2019s living at Hope\u2019s End\u2014nor even a mention of one\u2014I assume the baby either died during childbirth or was given up for adoption. \u201cAnd you think Ricardo Mayhew\u2019s the father,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s what Mary thought,\u201d Carter says, confirming what I already knew\u2014that Lenora told Mary everything. And that Mary shared at least some of it with Carter. He tips back his coffee cup and empties it. \u201cIt makes sense, too. In fact, it\u2019s the only reason I could see for Ricardo killing the rest of Lenora\u2019s family. He was a married man caught in an affair with Winston Hope\u2019s older daughter. Either they didn\u2019t approve and he killed them out of spite, or they demanded he make an honest woman out of Lenora and he killed them to get away.\u201d \u201cAnd it\u2019s why he spared Lenora,\u201d I add. \u201cShe was pregnant with his child.\u201d And, I suspect, it\u2019s why Lenora\u2019s been covering for him all this time. \u201cAnyway, that\u2019s why I started working here,\u201d Carter says. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid, but I thought that if I saw Lenora\u2014if we came face-to-face\u2014I\u2019d know.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not stupid at all,\u201d I say, thinking about my mad urge to stare into Lenora\u2019s eyes, hoping that doing so would give me some small insight into my own life. \u201cI guess it didn\u2019t help once you did see her.\u201d \u201cNot really. There\u2019s no resemblance that I saw. But it also doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not related.\u201d I finally take a seat at the other side of the table. Either I trust Carter enough to remain within arm\u2019s reach of him or the news of Lenora\u2019s pregnancy has made me toss all caution to the wind. I\u2019m not sure which one it is. \u201cHave you considered asking Mrs. Baker?\u201d \u201cFor about two seconds, yeah,\u201d Carter says. \u201cBut she\u2019s not exactly happy to talk about the past. Neither is Archie.\u201d He\u2019s right about that. Despite both having been here in 1929, neither seems like the type to willingly discuss anything about that time. \u201cSo you went to Mary instead.\u201d \u201cNot until I learned what she and Lenora were up to. The typing and all that.\u201d Carter pauses. Long enough to make me think he\u2019s waiting for me to admit I\u2019ve been doing the same thing with Lenora. I let him keep waiting. I might trust him, but only so much. \u201cWhen I realized we were both working toward the same goal, I got her involved.\u201d Now I understand why Carter assumes it\u2019s his fault Mary is dead. He thinks she knew too much. As does Lenora. I can still hear her response when I asked her if she thought Mary died because of what she\u2019d been told. Those two dreadful taps. \u201cThere are ways to tell if you\u2019re related to someone,\u201d Carter says. \u201cBlood tests. They\u2019re using them all the time now to settle paternity cases. I thought, well, if they can do that, then there\u2019s no reason to think they can\u2019t tell if someone\u2019s my grandparent.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s where Mary came in,\u201d I say. Carter nods before filling me in on the rest. He contacted a lab that could conduct the tests. All he needed were two blood samples\u2014one from him, one from Lenora. Two weeks ago, he went to the lab and got his own blood drawn to be analyzed. \u201cI convinced Mary to help me with the rest. She agreed to draw a sample of Lenora\u2019s blood for me to take to the lab. After that, all we had to do was wait to see if it was a match. It was supposed to happen the night Mary\u2014\u201d Carter can\u2019t bring himself to say the rest. The night Mary died. \u201cShe told me she\u2019d get Lenora\u2019s sample just before putting her to bed,\u201d he says. \u201cI planned to store it in the fridge here and take it to the lab first thing in the morning. When Mary didn\u2019t show, I thought she\u2019d changed her mind or wasn\u2019t able to do it. Then when it looked like she had left Hope\u2019s End entirely, I started to worry my request is what made her leave. Like I\u2019d asked too much of her or put her in an awkward position.\u201d I\u2019m certain he did. That\u2019s a big request of a caregiver\u2014even a registered nurse like Mary. But she had followed through on it. The bruise I found on Lenora\u2019s forearm is exactly the kind that would appear after having blood drawn, especially from an elderly patient taking the kind of anticoagulant she\u2019s on. It also means there might have been more than Lenora\u2019s writing inside Mary\u2019s suitcase. A sample of her blood could have been there as well, a theory that only makes Carter feel worse after I share it. \u201cSo it was my fault.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not the one who pushed Mary,\u201d I say, as clear a sign as any that Carter fully has my trust. \u201cNo, but I put her in a dangerous situation.\u201d \u201cThat you didn\u2019t know was dangerous.\u201d Carter looks into his empty coffee cup, as if he longs to refill it with more whiskey. \u201cBut I should have. I asked Mary to help me prove that I\u2019m related to Lenora Hope. Some people would kill to keep that from happening.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause if I\u2019m really Lenora\u2019s grandson, I might inherit everything when she dies,\u201d Carter says. \u201cHope\u2019s End. The house and the land and whatever money she has left.\u201d \u201cWho gets it now?\u201d I say. \u201cDo you know if Lenora has a will drawn up?\u201d \u201cNo. But if she did, I guess everything would be divided up between the two people who\u2019ve known her the longest.\u201d Mrs. Baker and Archie. The last time Carter and I sat in this exact spot, I wondered aloud why the two of them stayed. Now I think I know why\u2014they\u2019ll get Hope\u2019s End when she dies. \u201cSo one of them killed Mary,\u201d I say. \u201cOr maybe they both did it.\u201d A corner of Carter\u2019s mouth twitches, as if he wants to say something but knows he shouldn\u2019t. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s another reason I think it\u2019s my fault.\u201d Carter pauses, still hesitant. \u201cI left the gate open.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cThat Monday. I found it open that morning. I guess it got stuck and didn\u2019t close after the guy who delivers the groceries left. Since I assumed I\u2019d be leaving first thing the next day to head to the lab, I didn\u2019t bother to push it shut.\u201d \u201cSo on the night Mary died, the front gate was open the entire time?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Carter says with a sigh. \u201cAnyone could have gotten in.\u201d I become unsteady. A moment of dizziness as I realize the list of suspects, recently narrowed down to only two, has now grown to, well, everyone. Only when it passes can I say, \u201cWho else knew what you and Mary were doing?\u201d \u201cTony,\u201d Carter says. \u201cI asked him not to tell anyone, but that\u2019s no guarantee he didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cDo you know if Mary told someone?\u201d I say, thinking specifically of Jessie, who, despite being the closest with Mary, seems to be in the dark about everything. Unless it\u2019s all an act. The fact that I\u2019m even considering it makes me feel both guilty and paranoid. \u201cNot sure,\u201d Carter says. \u201cWhat about Detective Vick? Did you tell him any of this?\u201d \u201cAlmost,\u201d Carter says before finally reaching for the whiskey bottle he\u2019s been wanting to grab for the past five minutes. He empties what\u2019s left into his mug and holds it out to me, offering a first sip of the coffee-tinged whiskey inside. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to sound crazy.\u201d \u201cThat was my job, apparently.\u201d I take the mug, have a sip, grimace. It tastes awful but gets the job done. \u201cWhich is why, for now, I think it\u2019s a good idea to stay quiet. Even if we told him, I doubt he\u2019d believe us. Especially me.\u201d \u201cSo what should we do?\u201d A very good question. One I\u2019m at a loss to answer. The likeliest way to get Detective Vick to believe us is to present him with proof that we\u2019re right. Then it will be impossible for him to ignore us. Right now, the only thing I can think of is to go straight to the source. \u201cWe ask Lenora,\u201d I tell Carter. \u201cAnd get her to\u2014\u201d I\u2019m interrupted by a noise from outside. A great deafening, tearing sound that shakes the cottage and everything in it, including me and Carter. We clutch the rattling table as it continues for one, two, three seconds. By the time it\u2019s over, Carter\u2019s coffee cup is shattered on the floor and I mentally feel the same way. \u201cWas that an earthquake?\u201d I say. Carter lets go of the table. \u201cI . . . think so?\u201d The two of us rise on unsteady legs and make our way outside to investigate. On the terrace, Mrs. Baker, Jessie, and Archie have done the same. All five of us realize at once what just happened\u2014a section of cliff between the terrace and the cottage broke off, leaving a jagged semicircle that looks as if something has taken a bite out of the lawn. Carter and I take a few cautious steps toward it, both of us testing the ground, fearful the entire lawn might fall away beneath our feet. Which it very well could. We stop when we can just see over the edge. Far below, chunks of fallen earth sit surrounded by foamy waves. \u201cWelp,\u201d Carter says. \u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201d \n TWENTY-FOUR For the second day in a row, I skip Lenora\u2019s exercises and take her straight to the typewriter. Even though I know it\u2019s bordering on dereliction of duty, I\u2019m too impatient. On a normal night\u2014not that any night at Hope\u2019s End can be described as normal\u2014I would have shaken Lenora awake after leaving Carter\u2019s cottage, carried the typewriter to the bed, and demanded the truth about the baby. But the night before was particularly abnormal. After the partial collapse of the cliff outside the cottage, Carter wisely decided to move into the main house until the damage could be assessed. Not that it\u2019s any safer in here. While helping Carter carry some of his belongings to an empty bedroom on the third floor, I spotted a new crack at the service stairs and a broken tile on the kitchen floor. Bad omens all. Jessie sidled up to me while I examined the stairwell walls and whispered, \u201cWhat were you and Carter up to?\u201d \u201cJust talking,\u201d I said. She winked. \u201cSure. Right. Totally.\u201d \u201cWe were.\u201d \u201cDid you find out anything else about Mary?\u201d I stopped on the landing and studied her. Dressed in a pink sleepshirt and missing her makeup and jewelry, she looked like a complete stranger. Which she technically was. \u201cNo,\u201d I said before continuing on. I wanted to trust Jessie. I really did. Of everyone at Hope\u2019s End, she seemed the least likely to have a reason for wanting Mary dead and the most likely to be an ally to me. But since I\u2019d already ruled out Carter as a suspect, I couldn\u2019t risk doing it for anyone else. Even Jessie. While I\u2019m not usually a suspicious person, in this case I needed to be. I doubted Mary was suspicious, either, and look at what happened to her. Carter must have been thinking the same thing when he came to my door while on his way to his temporary room on the third floor. \u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d he said in a half whisper. \u201cYeah,\u201d I replied, even though I knew what he was really asking. Barring the possible but unlikely scenario that someone from town had snuck through the open gate and killed Mary, someone under this roof was a murderer. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I wasn\u2019t fine. I ended up spending most of the night wide awake, thinking about Lenora and Carter and the idea that Mary was dead because she knew too much about them both. That led to wondering if I now knew too much. The answer I came up with\u2014a resounding yes\u2014prompted more questions. How much danger was I in? Should I just up and leave in the middle of night like everyone thought Mary had? With ideas like that clanging through my skull, the fact I managed to fall asleep at all is a minor miracle. When I woke to sunrise piercing my eyes and the mattress slid lower on the bed frame, I realized that I hadn\u2019t heard any mysterious noises coming from Lenora\u2019s room. Either I slept right through them or whoever\u2014whatever?\u2014is causing them decided to take the night off. Now I stifle a yawn while getting Lenora into typing position. When she\u2019s ready, I kneel beside her and say, \u201cLenora, I think we should talk about the baby.\u201d She pretends not to be surprised I know. But she is. Her face, as expressive as a silent film star\u2019s, can\u2019t hide such shock. This is especially true of her eyes, which widen at the same time they go slightly dim. An unspoken answer to the biggest question I had: Could Carter have been wrong about Lenora\u2019s pregnancy? Yes, that photograph of her in 1929 is very persuasive, but it doesn\u2019t confirm anything. \u201cI know you were pregnant,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd Mary knew, too, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Lenora\u2019s left hand rises and falls twice against the typewriter. That\u2019s a yes. \u201cWhat happened to the baby?\u201d Lenora lets out a long, sad sigh. Then she types a single word\u2014gone\u2014before letting her hand slide off the typewriter. \u201cGone?\u201d It\u2019s strange how a word so short can contain so many possibilities. Lenora could have had a miscarriage. Or the baby was stillborn. Or left this world shortly after entering it. Or was bundled up and left on the front steps of a church on Christmas morning. That single word\u2014gone\u2014could also mean something happier. The child was born, grew up, left Hope\u2019s End, and now has a family of their own. Although, going by Lenora\u2019s reaction, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what happened. \u201cDid the baby die?\u201d I say. Lenora makes no indication she wants to type more. Her hands sit in her lap, the useful left one atop the useless right, and she stares at them as if she didn\u2019t hear me. \u201cWho was the father?\u201d I say, pressing. \u201cWas it Ricky?\u201d Still nothing from Lenora. No acknowledging the question. No acknowledging me. Without saying a word, she\u2019s made her message clear\u2014she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. I can\u2019t blame her. She was pregnant. The baby\u2019s now gone. She probably thinks there\u2019s nothing else to be said. Only there is. And Lenora told it to at least one other person\u2014Mary. Considering what happened to her, I should be grateful Lenora now refuses to tell me. Maybe that\u2019s another reason for her silence. She doesn\u2019t want to put me in more danger than I might already be. Once again, I think about leaving. It would take only minutes to pack my suitcase and box, grab my medical bag, and walk away from Hope\u2019s End without looking back. But I can\u2019t bring myself to do it. Even though I haven\u2019t been told everything, what I do know is enough to keep me here. I need to learn the rest. The Hope family murders. Lenora\u2019s pregnancy. Mary\u2019s death. They\u2019re all tied together in a complex knot of secrets, lies, and misdeeds both past and present. I\u2019m certain that if I can unravel it, the truth will be revealed. About Carter and Mary, yes, but most of all about Lenora. She\u2019s the person I need to understand the most. So I stay, letting the morning pass slowly and silently. With any other patient, I would have busied myself with light housework or cooking lunch or even just watching TV with them. None of those options are available to me at Hope\u2019s End. So I pass the time reading a Danielle Steel novel on the divan while Lenora sits in her wheelchair and stares out the window. It reminds me of my mother\u2019s final days, when she was too fragile and pain-wracked to be moved to the couch in the living room. Stuck in a room without a television and its comforting background noise, the silence became so thick it was almost unbearable. Today isn\u2019t quite that bad, but it\u2019s enough to make me appreciate the few moments of sound and activity. Fetching lunch. Feeding Lenora. Even assisting her in the bathroom because it\u2019s something to do besides sitting here and thinking. While I tackle the tasks with endless chatter, Lenora does nothing in response. No taps. Certainly no typing. She\u2019s become the person I thought she was when I first arrived. Silent, still, almost a nonentity. It makes me wonder if this is what she was like with all the nurses before Mary breezed in with a typewriter. If so, does Lenora regret indulging her? Does she feel the same about me and has decided this will be the way things are now? And it is her decision. An afternoon at the typewriter could end all this. Yet we spend this long, dreary day in more insufferable silence. I finish my book. Lenora stares out the window. The day fades into dusk, which darkens into night. Eventually Archie arrives, carrying dinner on a tray. Salmon and sweet potatoes that are roasted for me, mashed for Lenora. On the side are piping-hot rolls for me and a chocolate milkshake for Lenora. \u201cI thought Miss Hope could use a pick-me-up,\u201d Archie explains. \u201cShe loved them when she was a girl.\u201d The gesture is so thoughtful it takes me a second to remember that he could have killed Mary. It doesn\u2019t matter that Archie looks about as threatening as a teddy bear. He was here when Lenora\u2019s family was murdered in 1929, and he was here when Mary plummeted off the cliff. Yet that also makes him a perfect source of information about both of those nights. The challenge is figuring out if Archie\u2019s a friend or a foe, a suspect or a potentially trusted resource. For now, I decide it\u2019s best to treat him as all of the above. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to go to all the trouble,\u201d I say, taking the food from his hands. Because I haven\u2019t yet attached Lenora\u2019s meal tray to her wheelchair, I set it on the sideboard next to her snow globe and the cassette Jessie gave me yesterday. \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble,\u201d Archie says. \u201cBesides, I wanted to see how Miss Hope is doing.\u201d I glance at Lenora, who acts like neither of us is in the room with her. \u201cNot too well.\u201d \u201cI think that goes for all of us,\u201d Archie says. \u201cPoor Mary. Had I known she was hurting so much, I would have tried to help her somehow. And then the cliff giving way like that. These are not happy times at Hope\u2019s End.\u201d I wonder if there\u2019s ever been a time here that was happy. From what Lenora has written, I\u2019ve gathered the place was doomed from the start. \u201cThe other day, you told me that you and Lenora used to be close.\u201d \u201cI did,\u201d Archie says. \u201cAnd we were.\u201d \u201cHow close?\u201d \u201cBest friends, I guess. Although that was more from proximity than anything else. We were roughly the same age in a place where that wasn\u2019t common.\u201d \u201cWhat about Virginia? Were the two of you also close?\u201d \u201cNo. Can\u2019t say we were.\u201d His answer, refreshing in its swift honesty, makes me decide to continue the conversation. It might be risky\u2014and I might eventually come to regret it\u2014but if Archie\u2019s currently in a talkative mood, I\u2019m not going to stop him. And Lenora, I know, is listening, even though she pretends she isn\u2019t. I retrieve the Walkman, pop in the latest book-on-cassette from Jessie, and put the headphones over Lenora\u2019s ears. I lodge the Walkman itself between her motionless right hand and the side of the wheelchair so it won\u2019t slide off. \u201cA new book from Jessie,\u201d I explain to Lenora. \u201cWould you like to listen to it while I talk to Archie? After that we\u2019ll have dinner.\u201d Knowing she\u2019s not going to respond, I press play and turn back to Archie, who says, \u201cWhat else do we need to talk about?\u201d I hesitate, trying to think of the best way to phrase my question. After concluding that there\u2019s no good way to pose it, I blurt out, \u201cDid Lenora have a baby?\u201d \u201cA baby?\u201d Archie stares at me, perplexed, like I\u2019ve just asked if she had two heads or a pet rhinoceros. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that idea?\u201d \u201cLenora made a passing reference,\u201d I say, nodding toward the typewriter on the desk. I figure it\u2019s fine to give Archie an indication that Lenora can use it. He might already know. \u201cWhat have the two of you been doing on that thing?\u201d \u201cJust getting to know each other better,\u201d I say, presenting the truth in its simplest form. \u201cI like to learn about the people I\u2019m caring for.\u201d Archie eyes me with skepticism. \u201cAnd she told you she had a baby?\u201d \u201cShe hinted at it.\u201d \u201cYou must have misunderstood her.\u201d \u201cSo Lenora was never pregnant?\u201d I say. \u201cNever.\u201d Apparently done talking, Archie turns to leave. I pose one last question to his retreating form, hoping to get if not an honest answer, then at least an unconscious reaction. \u201cWhen you were close, did she ever mention the name Ricardo Mayhew?\u201d Archie\u2019s formidable frame comes to a stop in the doorway. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cHe used to work here.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d Archie says. \u201cBut Miss Hope never mentioned him. There\u2019s your answer.\u201d He starts moving again, walking stiffly into the hall. Only then does he face me again, his hard stare a silent warning. \u201cIf I were you, I wouldn\u2019t spend too much time typing with Miss Hope,\u201d he says. \u201cThe past is in the past. It does no one any good to start digging it up.\u201d \n \u201cThe baby just kicked.\u201d \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cIt did, I swear,\u201d Archie said, his hand still pressed to my swollen belly. I pushed it away. \u201cI think I\u2019d know.\u201d It was another Tuesday night with the rest of the household staff gone and my family scattered. Archie often spent those nights off in my room, where we\u2019d laugh and talk and dream about the future. It was a ritual we had performed almost since he first started working at Hope\u2019s End. By that September, though, the ritual had become a rarity. In the past few months, Archie and I had spent little time together. He\u2019d grown distant, and I worried it was all my doing rather than his. I\u2019d neglected him terribly since meeting Ricky, so my decision to tell him of my pregnancy was an attempt to involve him once again in my life. He was happy for me, but also concerned. As I told him my plans for the future, he pretended to be pleased, but worry lines kept rippling over his brow. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d he said. \u201cWith someone like him?\u201d \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be sure?\u201d Archie leaned against me on the divan, our shoulders touching. \u201cYou know exactly why.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky situation,\u201d I said. \u201cBut we have a plan.\u201d We didn\u2019t yet, but I couldn\u2019t tell that to Archie. I knew it would only make him more concerned. He had always seen himself as my protector. Even when we were younger and he was just a runaway given a job in the kitchen out of pity. I think that\u2019s what drew us to each other. We were two lonely souls in need of someone to care for. \u201cI wish you had told me you were sweet on him,\u201d Archie said. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause I would have tried to stop you.\u201d \u201cStop pretending like I\u2019m the only one in a tricky situation,\u201d I said. \u201cI know what you\u2019ve been up to.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Archie said, and indeed it wasn\u2019t. The only situation more scandalous than mine was Archie\u2019s. \u201cI knew what I was getting myself into when I met him,\u201d I said, when in truth I had no idea how deeply I\u2019d fall in love with Ricky and how quickly it would happen. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing. Having a baby is another.\u201d Archie reached for the camera he\u2019d just purchased. An extravagance I knew he couldn\u2019t easily afford. Buying it required months of saving. \u201cI know of someone who can help, if you decide you don\u2019t want to have it. A doctor.\u201d \u201cWho told you this?\u201d \u201cOne of the maids. She went to him when she got pregnant. She couldn\u2019t keep it because the father--\u201d Archie stopped himself, too kind to speak aloud the truth we both knew. \u201cWas my father,\u201d I said. \u201cI know.\u201d I\u2019d heard Berniece talking about it in the kitchen one morning when she thought none of the High and Mighty Hopes was around. That\u2019s what she called us. The High and Mighty Hopes, always spoken with a derisive snort. She mentioned that one of the new maids had been ruined by my father, forced to get rid of the baby and then kicked out of Hope\u2019s End. That was the previous year, and based on the compromising position I\u2019d caught him in on my birthday, my father hadn\u2019t learned his lesson. Although no one said as much, I knew it was one of the reasons my mother kept to her own bed. She and my father barely spoke, let alone saw each other. It made me sad to see them so miserable with each other. My sister, however, merely pretended nothing was wrong. I knew it was pretend because it was impossible to miss the tension strung like trip wire throughout the entire mansion. \u201cI won\u2019t end up like my parents,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure of it. I love him, Arch. I really do.\u201d \u201cWell, I wish you didn\u2019t.\u201d I wasn\u2019t hurt by Archie\u2019s words. I knew he didn\u2019t say them to be cruel. It was simply his way. He had a gentle soul and told things the way he saw them, unlike most everyone else at Hope\u2019s End. \u201cIf things were different, you know I\u2019d have chosen you,\u201d I said. \u201cI know,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut they are different. With me and with him. People like us and people like you and your sister--we\u2019re not meant to mingle. Society won\u2019t allow it. The longer you let this thing go on, the worse it\u2019ll be when it inevitably ends.\u201d I sat up, adamant. \u201cIt won\u2019t end.\u201d Archie raised his hands in surrender. \u201cI believe you. But whatever happens, good or bad, know that I\u2019ll be with you the entire time.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d I said. He raised the camera, prompting a sigh from me. The last thing I wanted at that moment was to have my picture taken. Even though Ricky told me I was beautiful every time he saw me, I didn\u2019t feel beautiful. Into the sixth month of my pregnancy, I felt bloated and restless. I couldn\u2019t even muster a proper pose for Archie, although he didn\u2019t seem to mind. \u201cPerfect,\u201d he said as I cradled my swollen stomach. The shutter clicked, and Archie joined me on the divan. I leaned my head against his shoulder, as I had done a hundred times in the past few years. He was so big, so solid. I knew he would always be there for me, no matter what. \u201cJust to make it clear,\u201d Archie added out of the blue. \u201cIf he--or anyone--ever hurts you or makes you unhappy, I won\u2019t hesitate to kill them.\u201d \n TWENTY-FIVE A minute after Archie leaves, Carter pops into Lenora\u2019s room to check on us. He looks, for lack of a better word, haggard from lack of sleep. \u201cGuess the third floor didn\u2019t treat you well,\u201d I say. He answers with a yawn. \u201cHow can any of you stand it in here? All night I felt like I was sleeping in a bed with two of its legs sawed off.\u201d \u201cRight now, it\u2019s safer than the cottage. How does the lawn look?\u201d \u201cLike there\u2019s a big hole in it,\u201d Carter says. \u201cHas something like this ever happened before?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cNot while I\u2019ve been here.\u201d \u201cSo why is it happening now?\u201d I probe. \u201cThat\u2019s a very good question. One I can\u2019t answer. Besides, I\u2019m more worried about if it\u2019s going to happen again.\u201d I look toward the night-shrouded window, grateful I can\u2019t see the edge of the terrace and the ocean waves careening toward the base of the cliff far below it. Still, I wonder if after last night the mansion has shifted even more\u2014and how much more it can go before toppling over entirely. While I glance at the window, Carter sets his gaze on Lenora. \u201cLearn anything new?\u201d I check to make sure she\u2019s still listening to her Walkman before pulling him into my room. \u201cShe confirmed she was pregnant,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat happened to the baby?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. She stopped typing after that. She made it very clear she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d \u201cDo you think the baby was born?\u201d Carter says, avoiding what he really wants to ask: Do I think the baby was his father? I study his features, trying to detect even the slightest resemblance to Lenora. There\u2019s nothing. Especially in the eyes. Carter\u2019s are a warm hazel. A far cry from Lenora\u2019s startling green. Yet I can\u2019t rule out the possibility, either. We have no idea what Ricardo Mayhew looked like, other than Lenora\u2019s description of him as incredibly good-looking. Carter\u2019s definitely got that part covered. \u201cI don\u2019t know. All she told me is that the baby is gone, which could mean anything. I even asked Archie\u2014\u201d \u201cDo you trust him?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause he lied. He told me Lenora was never pregnant.\u201d \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s more likely he doesn\u2019t want anyone else to know. Including Mary.\u201d Carter flinches, and I can tell he\u2019s picturing the same thing I am. Mary on the terrace, suitcase in hand, Archie barreling toward her, twice her size. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have asked him about it,\u201d he says, his voice going quiet. \u201cNow I\u2019m worried he thinks you know too much.\u201d I am, too. But for a reason different than Carter\u2019s. Mine is an abstract fear that none of what we\u2019re doing will change things. The past is in the past, Archie said. It does no one any good to start digging it up. Am I doing more harm than good by forcing Lenora to talk about the child who\u2019s no longer with her and the night her family was slaughtered? Will Mary\u2019s family and friends be better off knowing her cause of death was murder instead of suicide? Maybe Detective Vick was right about my having an ulterior motive for doing all this. That it\u2019s not Lenora or Mary or even Carter I\u2019m concerned about. It\u2019s me. And what will happen if I can\u2019t prove anything? \u201cHe doesn\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t. We only have theories, not facts.\u201d \u201cSo what now?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe Lenora will soon want to start typing again.\u201d I move through the adjoining door back into Lenora\u2019s room, knowing it\u2019s not a good idea for someone else to see me and Carter conferring in mine. I still remember the way Jessie sounded last night. Full of innuendo. Like she was suspicious\u2014or jealous. Who knows how Archie or, God forbid, Mrs. Baker would react if they saw us together like this. \u201cLet me know if she does.\u201d Carter heads to the hall, pausing in the doorway to take one more look at Lenora, checking for a resemblance that isn\u2019t there. \u201cAnd be careful. Right now, I don\u2019t trust anyone but you.\u201d By the time he\u2019s gone, it\u2019s fifteen minutes past dinnertime. Which will make us equally as late for Lenora\u2019s evening exercises, bath, and bedtime. I go back to my room and the lockbox under the bed, shaking out the proper amount of pills I need to mix with her dinner. The pages Lenora and I have typed remain under the rolling bottles. I wonder if more will eventually be added to the stack\u2014and if that would make things better or worse. Back with Lenora, I start to get ready for dinner. She\u2019s exactly as I left her. Wheelchair. Window. Headphones over her ears. The only thing that\u2019s changed is the Walkman. The cassette inside no longer turns. When I lift the headphones from Lenora\u2019s ears, no words come out. \u201cIt turned off?\u201d I ask Lenora. She taps her left hand twice against the wheelchair armrest, where it\u2019s been since before I turned the Walkman on. The Walkman, meanwhile, sits exactly where I left it between her right hand and the side of the wheelchair. Even if Lenora had moved her left hand at some point, there\u2019s no way she could have reached across her lap and turned off the Walkman without disturbing its position. \u201cHow did it stop?\u201d Lenora gives me a blank look that\u2019s her substitute for a shrug. I pick up the Walkman and examine it. My initial thought is that it automatically shut off when the first side of the cassette ran out of tape. Thinking the cassette needs to be flipped, I eject it from the Walkman. There\u2019s plenty of tape around both reels, suggesting only half of it has been played. Since the only other thing that could have caused it to stop working is a dead battery, I slide the cassette back into the Walkman and press the play button. Jessie\u2019s voice, muffled but unmistakable, pops from the headphones in my hands. I hit the stop button, my mind turning faster than the reels inside the Walkman a mere moment earlier. Since the cassette didn\u2019t run out of tape, the batteries still work, and Lenora didn\u2019t use her left hand, I can think of only one other way for the Walkman to have stopped playing. Lenora turned it off herself. With a hand she can\u2019t use. \n TWENTY-SIX It\u2019s ten p.m., Lenora\u2019s in bed, and I\u2019m in my room next door staring at a Walkman she may or may not have turned off using a hand she may or may not be able to use. After an hour of obsessing over it, I\u2019m still not sure. One thing I\u2019m certain of is that it\u2019s nearly impossible for the Walkman to have accidentally shut off without Lenora using her right hand. I know because I\u2019ve tried. Jostling it. Smacking it. I even knocked it against the side of a chair multiple times, testing to see if it was enough to bump the stop button. It wasn\u2019t. Nothing Lenora could have done with her left hand would have somehow made the Walkman turn off if it bumped her right one. Now I watch the reels inside the Walkman spin, waiting to see if they stop on their own for any reason other than the one I\u2019m thinking of. A warp of the cassette tape. Faulty wiring in the Walkman itself. Just random occurrence that has never happened before and never will again. But everything works exactly the way it should, even as I keep pressing buttons. Stop, rewind, play, stop, rewind, play. My thoughts do a similar herky-jerky dance. Stop. Lenora turned off the Walkman. I\u2019m convinced of that now. But how? Rewind. Because it\u2019s possible she\u2019s capable of more than she\u2019s letting on. I\u2019ve thought this before, when I realized the page in the typewriter had been moved. Play. If that\u2019s true, then it means Lenora has been pretending all this time. Stop. But I can\u2019t think of a single reason why she\u2019d do that. Lenora\u2019s day is filled with indignities. Having someone feed her, bathe her, remove her soiled adult diaper, and wipe her clean before putting on a fresh one. No one would willingly subject themselves to that. Rewind. Yet what about that page taken from the typewriter? And the footfalls I keep hearing inside her room? And the blur at the window and the shadow at the door? Someone is causing them\u2014and I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the ghost of Virginia Hope. Play. Which means the only logical source is Lenora, who\u2019s been lying to me. Possibly about everything. Stop. Not necessarily. Maybe Lenora has no control over what her body can and cannot do. It sometimes happens in patients with paralysis. Sudden muscle spasms can occur like an electric shock to their system, moving muscles against their will, just like what happened when I checked her reflexes my first night here. Now that\u2019s something that could have caused her to shut off the Walkman. My finger\u2019s still on the stop button when I hear a noise. A heavy thud. Lenora, I think when I hear it a second time. She\u2019s moving around. Again. I hurry through the adjoining door into Lenora\u2019s room. Inside, it\u2019s as still and silent as a tomb. Outside, waves gently lap at the base of the cliff. Lenora appears to be asleep. Eyes closed, flat on her back, blanket to her chin. I tiptoe to her bedside and listen to the steady sound of her breathing. All is well. Except for more noise. Footsteps this time, shushing over the carpet in the hallway. I go to Lenora\u2019s bedroom door, open it a crack, and see Mrs. Baker passing by. A white-robed blur holding a\u2014 Is that a shotgun? My unspoken question gets an immediate answer when Mrs. Baker halts and does a half-turn in my direction. Clutched in her arms is a shotgun, its double barrel propped against her right shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019re outside,\u201d she says. \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cReporters. They\u2019ve been loitering at the gate all day. It\u2019s either them or boys from town who\u2019ve hopped the wall and now they\u2019re prowling the grounds.\u201d When Mrs. Baker hurries off toward the service stairs, I follow, unsure who\u2019s in bigger danger, us or the trespassers. If they\u2019re teenage boys and anything like the ones I went to school with, then they\u2019re mostly harmless. Mrs. Baker, on the other hand, is armed. From the kitchen, we move into the hallway, where I glimpse movement through the front-facing windows. A dark figure, streaking by. Then another. And another. In the foyer, Mrs. Baker throws open the front door and marches outside, shotgun barrel leading the charge. The night is foggy, with mist languidly curling over the lawn. In the haze, two more dark figures zip by, bringing the number of known trespassers to five. They all carry flashlights, the beams cutting through the dense fog like lasers. \u201cYou\u2019ll leave right now if you know what\u2019s good for you!\u201d Mrs. Baker shouts at them. The trespassers scatter in all directions, footsteps squishing on the damp lawn and flashlights bobbing in panic. Once a safe distance from the house, one of them stops and turns, backlit by the moon-drenched fog. \u201cIt\u2019s Lenora!\u201d he yells. Then he calls out, \u201cKiller!\u201d That settles it. They definitely aren\u2019t reporters. Another one joins him, shouting, \u201cKiller!\u201d before the others also start chiming in. Their voices ring out in the night, echoing through the fog. \u201cKiller! Killer!\u201d The trespasser who\u2019d started the chant\u2014the ringleader, apparently\u2014keeps shouting it after the others have stopped, adding one more word to the insult. \u201cKiller bitch!\u201d I flinch when I hear it. Like he had yelled it at me. About me. I bolt past Mrs. Baker and hurtle into the frigid night, not thinking about what I\u2019m doing or why I\u2019m doing it. All I can focus on is catching the punk who said it, shaking him by the shoulders, and making sure he knows I\u2019m innocent. The dark figure starts running when he sees me coming, his sneakers slipping on the dew-slicked grass. It gives me the extra second I need to catch up just before he can get away. I lunge forward, grab him by the shirt collar, and yank. His feet slide out from under him, and he drops to the ground like a sack of wheat. The flashlight flies from his hand and rolls across the grass, its light flickering. In that stuttering glow, I leap on top of him, surprising him and surprising myself even more. Yet there\u2019s another surprise in store for both of us. Writhing in the grass beneath me, the trespasser looks up at me and says, \u201cKit?\u201d No matter how shocked he is, I\u2019m doubly surprised. It\u2019s Kenny. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he says. Winded, I slide off him and plop onto the grass. \u201cI work here. What are you doing here?\u201d \u201cJust having a little fun with the boys,\u201d Kenny says as he sits up. \u201cAren\u2019t you a little old for this shit, Kenny?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, now grinning the same way he did whenever I met him at the back door. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like it\u2019s hurting anyone.\u201d He\u2019d be singing a different tune if Mrs. Baker had shot one of them, which I wouldn\u2019t put past her. A woman like her surely has an itchy trigger finger. \u201cYou really work here?\u201d Kenny says. \u201cAt Hopeless End?\u201d I sigh. So that\u2019s what they\u2019re calling it now. \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s your patient?\u201d \u201cWho do you think?\u201d Kenny blinks. \u201cNo way! What\u2019s she like?\u201d \u201cNot a killer bitch,\u201d I say. \u201cYeah, sorry about that,\u201d Kenny says, eyes to the ground. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by it. That\u2019s just what everyone says about her.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re wrong.\u201d \u201cThen what\u2019s she really like?\u201d \u201cQuiet,\u201d I reply, which says everything while also revealing nothing. I look down the long driveway to the front gate, where the rest of Kenny\u2019s friends have gathered. At least it\u2019s fully closed tonight. Not that it matters. One of Kenny\u2019s \u201cboys\u201d is boosting the others over the brick wall. At the top, another reaches down to help him up. Gate or no gate, it proves that literally anyone could have come onto the property and killed Mary. One of Kenny\u2019s friends shouts at him from atop the wall. \u201cHey! You coming?\u201d \u201cIn a minute!\u201d Kenny calls back. \u201cDo you guys do this often?\u201d I say as his friends vanish over the wall. \u201cNot since high school,\u201d Kenny says, which in his case was only two years ago. \u201cA few of us were drinking and decided to come see if what everyone\u2019s saying is true. You know, about her dead nurse.\u201d \u201cWhat about her?\u201d I sit up straighter, genuinely curious about what people in town think about Mary\u2019s death. So far, the only outside opinion I\u2019ve been privy to is Detective Vick\u2019s. \u201cWhat are they saying?\u201d \u201cThat Lenora Hope killed her.\u201d Of course they do. I should have known not to put any stock in what my fellow townies are saying. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason Lenora hasn\u2019t been seen in decades.\u201d I stand and brush the skirt of my uniform, now wet from the grass. I then reach down and help Kenny to his feet. \u201cShe can\u2019t walk. Or talk. Or even move anything but her left hand. She\u2019s harmless.\u201d \u201cHow do you know?\u201d \u201cBecause I\u2019m her caregiver,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve spent more time with her than you.\u201d \u201cI know you think I\u2019m stupid.\u201d Kenny says it without a hint of anger. Instead, there\u2019s a gentle resignation in his voice that makes me reconsider our relationship, such as it was. I honestly didn\u2019t think he cared what I thought. Now I\u2019m not so sure. \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I say. He gives me a sad smile. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I am stupid. About a lot of things. But I think that sometimes helps me see things that smarter people like you overthink.\u201d \u201cLike me?\u201d I say, both flattered he considers me smart and insulted that he believes I overthink things. \u201cWhat I mean is that sometimes facts just get in the way. Sure, you\u2019re Lenora Hope\u2019s caregiver and you think she can\u2019t hurt anyone.\u201d \u201cBecause she can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re still overthinking,\u201d Kenny says. \u201cThere\u2019s more to everyone than meets the eye. You, me, even Lenora Hope. Look at us. Back when we first decided to . . .\u201d \u201cFuck,\u201d I say, because that\u2019s all it was. \u201cRight. Back then, I knew what happened to your mom and what everyone was saying about you. But I didn\u2019t spend any time thinking about it. I just knew in my gut that you were a good person.\u201d A lump forms in my throat. No one has said that about me for a very long time. That it comes from Kenny, of all people, makes me understand just how much my father\u2019s silence has hurt me. He\u2019s the one who should be telling me this. Not the guy I started sleeping with just because I was starved for human contact. \u201cThank you,\u201d I say. \u201cNo problem,\u201d Kenny replies with a shrug. \u201cBut on the flip side, sometimes your gut tells you something else. So while Lenora looks like she can\u2019t do much, maybe, like you, there\u2019s more than meets the eye.\u201d There\u2019s certainly more to Kenny than I expected. Back when we were having no-strings afternoon sex, I had no idea there was this kind of wisdom inside him. But before I can give him too much credit, he grabs my waist, pulls me close, and sloppily kisses me. I push him away, worried that Mrs. Baker is still watching from the front door. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, Kenny.\u201d \u201cThought I\u2019d give it a shot,\u201d he says, flashing that horny grin I\u2019ve seen dozens of times since May. \u201cI should go anyway. Take care of yourself, Kit. If you ever change your mind, you know where to find me.\u201d Kenny gives me a playful wink before sprinting to the wall at the end of the lawn and scaling it with zero effort. Then, with a corny salute, he turns and hops off the wall, vanishing from view. Turning around, I take in the entirety of Hope\u2019s End. From the vantage point of the lawn, it looks enormous, forbidding. It\u2019s easy to forget that when you\u2019re on the inside, navigating its bloodstained stairs and tilted halls. Lenora\u2019s the same way. I remember the fear I felt when stepping into her room for the first time. Her reputation preceded her. Now that I\u2019ve gotten to know her, that reputation has, if not faded, at least been made more benign by familiarity. Not anymore, thanks to Kenny. Now my gut tells me I was wrong about initially thinking there are only four people at Hope\u2019s End who could have shoved Mary off the terrace. There\u2019s someone else. A fifth, highly unlikely suspect. But now a suspect all the same. Lenora. \n TWENTY-SEVEN Back in the house, I find Mrs. Baker still in the foyer and Jessie on the Grand Stairs, obliviously standing on the bloodstains in the carpet. Her eyes widen at the sight of the shotgun in Mrs. Baker\u2019s hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she says. \u201cTrespassers,\u201d Mrs. Baker replies before moving down the hall toward the kitchen. \u201cI took care of them,\u201d I say. Jessie lets out a relieved huff. \u201cWhat did they want?\u201d \u201cNothing. Just some kids messing around.\u201d Although, in Kenny\u2019s case, no longer a kid. And his warning still reverberates through my thoughts. Yes, Lenora\u2019s the one who typed her story, but maybe she regretted telling Mary so much. Or had second thoughts. Or didn\u2019t think Mary would tell anyone else and felt the need to act when she realized that was the plan. I even consider the bruise on Lenora\u2019s arm, now all but healed. Could Mary have drawn blood against her will? Is that why she took it from Lenora\u2019s working left arm instead of her nonworking right? So Lenora had no way to fight the needle\u2019s approach? That idea runs counter to the theory that Lenora, of all people, killed Mary. Could she push someone if she only has the use of one arm? If so, how could she do it when she can\u2019t even walk? The answer, of course, is that she\u2019s just pretending she can\u2019t. I\u2019ve experienced too much to keep me from outright dismissing the idea that Lenora is faking it. First, there\u2019s the Walkman and the unlikelihood that it turned off by itself. Then there are the noises coming from Lenora\u2019s room almost nightly. Creaks and footsteps and rustling. Connected to them are the shadow passing the adjoining door and the gray blur I saw at the window. Until I learn what caused some, if not all, of those things, Lenora must remain a suspect. Upstairs, I peek into her room. Despite the ruckus outside, Lenora\u2019s still asleep. Or at least pretending to be. Just like she might be pretending that she\u2019s incapable of doing more than just move her left hand. Much more. Like talking. And walking. And shoving. The only way to find out is to catch her in the act. If it even is an act. Someone else could be causing the noise and movement in her room each night. If so, I want to know who it is\u2014and why. I cross Lenora\u2019s room and enter mine through the adjoining door. Instead of closing it, I prop the door open with a stack of paperbacks from the bookshelf. I change out of my uniform, crawl into bed, and pick up a book I\u2019d pulled at random from the shelf. Scruples by Judith Krantz. Next to it is a thermos I filled with leftover coffee from this morning. It\u2019s cold and bitter, which is exactly what I need. If someone walks around Lenora\u2019s room tonight, I plan on being awake to notice them. I position myself at a slight angle on the bed, making sure the open doorway remains in my line of sight at all times. Then I settle in for a night of no sleep. Fueled by bad coffee and an okay book, I remain awake for hours. Long enough to finish a hundred pages of the Judith Krantz. Long enough to then count the waves as they crash against the base of the cliff. Long enough to give up after tallying two hundred of them. And long enough to see my mother creep into the room through the adjoining door. In silence, she crosses to the foot of my bed, swaying on legs whittled thin by disease. Her teeth clatter, sounding again like the struck keys of a typewriter. She raises a bony arm and points at me as her lower jaw drops open. Then she screams. I bolt upright in bed, my eyes still closed and my ears still ringing with the noise my mother made in the nightmare. Not a scream, but a buzz. A loud, steady one that I continue to hear even though I\u2019m now awake. I open my eyes to a bedroom glowing red and Lenora\u2019s alarm buzzing on the nightstand. I look to the adjoining door. It\u2019s closed. I jump out of bed, fling it open, rush into Lenora\u2019s room. She\u2019s awake in bed with the call button smashed under the palm of her left hand. Her mouth droops open, releasing a gurgling moan of pure terror. Her eyes are saucer-wide as she stares at something on the other side of the room. The typewriter. A fresh page sits in the carriage, filled with a single sentence typed over and over and over. It\u2019s all your fault It\u2019s all your fault It\u2019s all your fault It\u2019s all your fault It\u2019s all your fault It\u2019s all your fault I rip the page from the typewriter and turn to Lenora. \u201cLet me guess. Your sister?\u201d Lenora taps twice. \n TWENTY-EIGHT Which one of you did this?\u201d I hold up the sheet of paper so everyone can see what\u2019s been typed on it. \u201cI know it was someone in this house.\u201d All of us are crammed into Lenora\u2019s bedroom. Every single person living and working at Hope\u2019s End. Carter and Jessie share the divan. Archie sits on the edge of Lenora\u2019s bed. And Mrs. Baker stands in the doorway, arms crossed and eyeglasses on so she can get a better view of what she probably thinks is a mental breakdown. I deserve more credit than that. If I was truly hysterical, I wouldn\u2019t have waited until after breakfast to demand everyone gather in Lenora\u2019s room. I would have done it at four in the morning, right after I spotted the page. \u201cWho does Miss Hope say did it?\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cHer sister.\u201d Mrs. Baker\u2019s eyes grow large behind her cat\u2019s-eye frames. Archie coughs, probably trying to suppress a laugh. Carter and Jessie look worried. Or weirded out. Or both. As for Lenora, she simply sits by the window in her wheelchair, observing the proceedings with keen fascination. From the Mona Lisa smile on her face, I assume she\u2019s enjoying it. She likely hasn\u2019t had this many visitors in decades. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cI know it is,\u201d I say. \u201cWhich means one of you snuck into this room and did it.\u201d \u201cWhy would one of us do that?\u201d This comes from Jessie, who asks while twisting one of the many bracelets around her wrist. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, when in truth I think I do. Whoever did it is likely trying to scare Lenora to keep her from telling me as much as she told Mary. Because the mystery typist is also the person who killed her. The very idea makes me short of breath. I am in a room with a killer. It doesn\u2019t matter that the gate was open the night Mary was killed or that, as Kenny and his friends proved, it\u2019s so easy to hop the wall. The typed page in my hand leaves me convinced this was an inside job. I look from person to person, studying their facial expressions and body language, searching for signs of a tell. Jessie\u2019s bracelet twirling, for instance, could be a nervous tic. The same with Mrs. Baker\u2019s eyeglasses, which she\u2019s lowered but I\u2019m sure will raise to her face again before speaking. As for Archie, he\u2019s harder to read. So quiet and still. Other than that single cough, he\u2019s done nothing to bring attention to himself. Maybe that\u2019s his tell. \u201cI have a question,\u201d Mrs. Baker says as she puts on her glasses just like I predicted she would. \u201cHow was Miss Hope able to tell you she thought her sister did it?\u201d \u201cShe tapped yes.\u201d \u201cSo you specifically asked if it was her sister?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a weird thing to do,\u201d Archie says, finally piping up. \u201cIndeed,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cI can only assume you did it because you went through all of our names with Miss Hope and was told no.\u201d \u201cThat part doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that she said it was Virginia. Which we all know isn\u2019t the case.\u201d \u201cWhy does she think that?\u201d Jessie says. Honestly, I don\u2019t know. My best guess is that talking about the past has Lenora dreaming about it. Those humdinger nightmares that linger. When she wakes, she thinks they\u2019re real. Just for a moment. And that her sister is with her still. But saying that would reveal all. A tempting idea. Tell them everything and see what happens. Admit that I\u2019ve been helping Lenora type her story, that Mary did the same thing, and that it\u2019s why I think someone shoved her off the terrace. I don\u2019t because it would also give away Carter\u2019s secrets. Something the nervous ping-ponging of his eyes tells me he wouldn\u2019t like. \u201cIt\u2019s the power of influence,\u201d Mrs. Baker says, answering in my place. \u201cSomething in Kit\u2019s body language or the way she spoke our names indicated to Miss Hope it wasn\u2019t the answer she wanted. But the way she mentioned Miss Hope\u2019s sister did. Miss Hope was merely trying to please her.\u201d Not knowing how to respond, I begin to smooth the skirt of my uniform. My tell. \u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d \u201cThat the culprit is you, dear,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cWhy would I type this?\u201d \u201cAttention?\u201d Jessie suggests while shooting a quick glance at Carter she probably doesn\u2019t want me to notice. I glare at her. \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s attention.\u201d \u201cThen why are we all here?\u201d Mrs. Baker tilts her head, staring directly at me, her blue eyes boring into me like the sunrise. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who demanded we all come here so you could show us the words on that page and tell us Miss Hope claims it was her sister. Why go to all that trouble?\u201d \u201cBecause I want whoever did it to stop,\u201d I say. \u201cPlease. And stop sneaking into Miss Hope\u2019s room at night.\u201d Mrs. Baker\u2019s body goes rigid. \u201cSomeone\u2019s been doing that?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d \u201cI did,\u201d I say. \u201cThe morning after my first night here. I told you I heard footsteps in Miss Hope\u2019s bedroom and you said it was just the wind. But I heard it again the next night. And saw someone at that window. And watched a shadow pass the door between our rooms. That wasn\u2019t the wind. So it was either one of you or it was Lenora.\u201d I stare at Mrs. Baker, silently daring her to chastise me for not saying \u201cMiss Hope.\u201d She doesn\u2019t. Instead, she says, \u201cTell me immediately if it ever happens again.\u201d Then she leaves, thereby bringing an end to this melodramatic\u2014and ultimately fruitless\u2014household meeting. Archie is the first to follow her out. Then Carter, who gives me a we-need-to-talk-later look before slipping out the door. Jessie, however, lingers. Remaining on the divan, she says, \u201cSorry about that. I don\u2019t really think you did it for attention.\u201d \u201cGee, thanks.\u201d Jessie stands, steps closer, touches my arm. \u201cWhat I mean is that I don\u2019t think you did it at all.\u201d Out of the corner of my eye, I see Lenora pretending she isn\u2019t paying attention to every single word. Before Jessie can say anything else, I pull her into my room and shut the adjoining door behind us. \u201cDid you do it?\u201d I ask her. \u201cDid you type it and get Lenora to tell me it was her sister?\u201d Jessie drifts away from me, toward the bookshelf. \u201cNo way. How could you, like, even think that?\u201d Because she\u2019s done this kind of thing before. In the ballroom. With a Ouija board. Like we\u2019re in a goddamn game of Clue. \u201cIf it was some kind of prank, I\u2019d\u2014\u201d \u201cI told you it wasn\u2019t me,\u201d Jessie snaps. \u201cHow do you know it wasn\u2019t Lenora? She can type, right?\u201d \u201cNot like this.\u201d I glance at the page in my hand, filled with proper capitalization and punctuation. \u201cAnd not without help.\u201d \u201cMaybe she can do more than you think.\u201d Kenny said the same thing last night. And I thought it myself before that, as I fiddled with the Walkman to see if it could shut itself off. \u201cDid Mary\u2014\u201d I have no idea how to phrase this without sounding insane. Did she ever say Lenora is stronger than she looks? Did she ever think Lenora\u2019s faking this whole thing? \u201cDid Mary ever say she thought it was possible for Lenora to recover?\u201d \u201cIn what way?\u201d Walk, I think. Shove. Kill. \u201cAny way,\u201d I say. \u201cMentally. Physically.\u201d \u201cLike, learning to walk again?\u201d Jessie says. \u201cNo. She never did.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s possible, right?\u201d Jessie leans against the bookshelf, her hands behind her back. \u201cI was just talking about typing. I didn\u2019t mean for you to think Lenora is running around without telling anyone. Sure, we\u2019ve all heard stories about people suddenly snapping out of a coma or paralyzed people miraculously being able to walk again. So I guess it can happen. But probably not to someone Lenora\u2019s age. You can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks. That kind of thing.\u201d \u201cBut what if this isn\u2019t a case of an old dog learning a new trick?\u201d I say. \u201cWhat if they\u2019ve known this particular trick since they were young?\u201d \u201cYou think Lenora\u2019s faking this?\u201d Jessie says. \u201cWhy would she do that?\u201d I don\u2019t have an answer other than that Lenora seems to enjoy keeping secrets. She\u2019s been doing it for decades, never telling a soul what she knew about the Hope family massacre until Mary came along. And now, despite all common sense and reason, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that once she revealed her biggest secret to Mary, Lenora decided to take it back. If such a thing is possible. \u201cI\u2019m kind of worried about you, Kit,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like Mary.\u201d \u201cIn what way?\u201d \u201cUm, every way.\u201d I\u2019d be worried about me, too, if I didn\u2019t know what I do. That someone\u2019s been walking around Lenora\u2019s room. That she\u2019s lied to me repeatedly about who it is. That she turned off a Walkman using a hand everyone thinks she can\u2019t use. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, even though I\u2019m not. When Jessie departs, claiming she needs to dust the urns in the downstairs library\u2014a sure sign she wants to get far, far away from me\u2014someone who\u2019s fine wouldn\u2019t transfer Lenora from her wheelchair to the bed. Someone who\u2019s fine wouldn\u2019t then examine Lenora\u2019s legs and right arm, searching for signs of untapped strength, feeling for muscles tense from disuse. Someone who\u2019s fine wouldn\u2019t also tickle Lenora\u2019s palm, looking for a twitch, a twinge, a flicker of movement. I do all those things as Lenora watches me from the bed, more wary than suspicious. I think she knows what I\u2019m up to. If she\u2019s capable of resisting, she shows no sign of it. Her limp right arm is easy to stretch across the mattress, palm up, fingers spread. When she sighs, as if she\u2019s been through this before, I wonder if Mary also tried it. I wonder if it worked. I wonder if Lenora then felt the need to make her disappear. With that in mind, the next logical step would be to try the opposite of tickling\u2014inflict pain, which is more likely to induce a reaction. It would be so easy, too. Grab a syringe and needle from Mary\u2019s medical bag. Jab it into Lenora\u2019s right hand. Watch for the wince. I shove the thought out of my mind. It goes against everything I\u2019ve been trained to do. I might not trust Lenora right now\u2014and I might be far from fine\u2014but I\u2019m still a caregiver. So I cross to the desk, grab the sheet of paper I\u2019d found in the typewriter, and read the accusation running from the top of the page to the bottom. I\u2019m so tired that the words begin to blur, the letters rearranging themselves before my very eyes. It\u2019s all your fault It\u2019s all Kit\u2019s fault What they\u2019re saying\u2019s not true, Kit-Kat I crumple the paper into a ball, take it to the bed, and drop it into Lenora\u2019s open right hand. My hope is her reflexes take over when it hits her palm, the same way we catch something without thinking about it. It just happens. At some point, instinct takes over. Not in this case. The balled-up paper bounces off Lenora\u2019s palm and onto the floor. I pick it up and try again. Then again. Then I throw it across the room, where it ricochets off the window before rolling into a corner. I need something heavier. Something Lenora will really feel when it lands in her hand. I eye the open door between our rooms and the paperbacks that once propped it open but were pushed out of the way when someone (Virginia? Lenora?) pulled it shut. I grab one\u2014Ordinary People by Judith Guest\u2014and hold it spine down a few inches from Lenora\u2019s hand. I let it drop. The book stands upright a second before flipping onto its side over Lenora\u2019s thumb and forefinger. Still nothing. Because, I realize, it doesn\u2019t matter if she catches it. The book, like the ball of paper, is expendable. Both mean nothing to her. If Lenora\u2019s faking all of this, she\u2019s not going to reveal it without a good reason. To get her to move her right hand\u2014if she can move it\u2014I need to provide a bigger incentive than a wad of paper and a dog-eared book. I scan the room, considering and dismissing its contents. A hairbrush? Too worthless. A handheld mirror? Too unwieldy. The Walkman? A strong candidate. But it, too, could be replaced. My gaze lands on the Eiffel Tower snow globe on the sideboard. Stereotypical Paris under glass. Now we\u2019re talking. A gift to Lenora from her long-dead parents, it has sentimental value. It\u2019s likely also worth a lot of money. It\u2019s an antique, for one thing, and I doubt people like Winston and Evangeline Hope went for a cheap snow globe when choosing one for their daughter. I pick it up, convinced Lenora would never, ever, not in a million years let it fall from her grip. The journey from the sideboard to the bed kicks up some of the gold flakes resting at the bottom of the waterless globe. They sparkle and swirl as I hold it upside down over Lenora\u2019s hand. Flat on her back, Lenora strains to see what I\u2019m doing. When she spots the gold flakes inside the snow globe, she takes on a panicked look. Her eyes burn bright, and a grunt rises from the back of her throat. I ignore it, holding the snow globe steady, waiting for the right moment to drop it. I tell myself I\u2019m doing nothing wrong. That Lenora can catch it if she really wants to. That the reason she\u2019s so stressed is because she knows I\u2019m on to her. Both of us stare at the snow globe, watching the gold flakes settle into the curve of the overturned dome. When the last one falls, I let go. The snow globe smacks against Lenora\u2019s palm. I hold my breath, watching and waiting. For her fingers to curl around it. For her to prove that she can use her right hand. For the moment when at least one of my suspicions is confirmed. Instead, the snow globe topples from her hand and rolls across the mattress. Then it hits the floor and shatters. \n The sound coming from behind the closed door of my mother\u2019s room was unmistakable. Breaking glass. Upon hearing it, my sister gasped. I merely flinched, as if whatever my mother had just thrown across the room was flying directly at me and not at my father. \u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, Evie,\u201d I heard him grumble. \u201cHaven\u2019t you destroyed enough?\u201d \u201cI could ask the same of you.\u201d My mother\u2019s voice was loud and clear behind the door. A sign that she was well and truly furious. Normally, the laudanum kept her sounding meek and muddled. It pleased me to hear her sounding like her old self again, even though I knew it was prompted by the worst fight my parents had had in years. \u201cNothing is destroyed,\u201d my father said. \u201cEverything is fine. The firm is just going through a rough patch. Which is why it\u2019s so important right now that we have the money to keep it going.\u201d My mother let out a derisive snort. \u201cOur daughters\u2019 money, you mean.\u201d \u201cIt should be our money.\u201d \u201cOver my dead body,\u201d my mother said. This prompted my father to reply, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me.\u201d \u201cMy parents had good reason for creating that trust,\u201d my mother said. \u201cIf you could get at that money, you\u2019d spend it all in a year and Lenora and Virginia would have nothing.\u201d \u201cNothing is exactly what they\u2019ll have if the business goes under and this place is foreclosed on.\u201d My sister and I exchanged worried glances. We had no idea things were that bad, even though we should have suspected it. My parents barely spoke, let alone fought, which is why when their argument echoed down the hall, we both ran for the door to listen in. We knew something big had to have caused it. \u201cThey\u2019ll be just fine if it does,\u201d my mother said. \u201cAnd what about me? You won\u2019t care if I lose everything?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve already lost everything,\u201d my mother said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t you? Or are you more worried about your little whore? I suppose I should say whores, since there have been many over the years.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t act so innocent with me, darling,\u201d my father shot back, spitting the term of endearment he used on me with undisguised venom. \u201cWe both know the truth.\u201d My mother\u2019s reply was so quiet that my sister and I had to press our ears against the door to hear it. Even then, we could barely make out the half-whispered \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d \u201cYes, you do,\u201d my father said. \u201cI know why you married me. Just like I know that Lenora isn\u2019t my daughter.\u201d I gasped. So loudly I was certain my parents heard it through the door. My sister was certain, too, for she clapped a hand over my mouth and whisked me down the hallway to the first open room. She yanked me inside just as the door to my mother\u2019s bedroom opened. We huddled in that darkened room, my heart pounding and my head woozy from shock, as my father looked up and down the hallway. \u201cGirls,\u201d he said in a voice so stern it turned my blood cold. \u201cWere you eavesdropping?\u201d My sister kept her hand over my mouth as my father passed the open doorway, mere inches from us. I\u2019d started to cry then, and my tears dripped over her fingers. \u201cAre you there, my dear and my darling?\u201d When he paused just past the door, I became certain he was about to leap inside, grab us both by our necks, and drag us out of the room. To my utter surprise, he moved on, down the hallway and to the Grand Stairs. When his footfalls faded to silence, my sister and I finally emerged and hurried to my bedroom. Inside, I threw myself onto the bed and began to weep, fully and openly. My sister stood by the wall, her arms folded, in no mood to comfort me. I\u2019m sure it never even crossed her mind. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s true?\u201d she said. \u201cThat we could lose Hope\u2019s End?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re concerned about? Even after what Father said?\u201d \u201cOh, that.\u201d My sister shrugged. \u201cMother was in love with one of her parents\u2019 servants and got pregnant. He abandoned her and she had to marry Father to avoid a scandal. I thought you knew.\u201d I shook my head. I had no idea. Although, in hindsight, I think I should have. My sister and I bore only a slight resemblance to each other. Our noses were different. As were our hair and eyes. We looked less like siblings and more like cousins, which strangers had mistaken us for on more than one occasion. \u201cWell, now you do.\u201d My sister paused as a cruel smirk formed across her lips. \u201cHonestly, you should be relieved. Now you know where you get it from. And that you\u2019re not the only slut in the family.\u201d She then swanned out of the room, leaving me alone and with a hollow feeling in my gut that she knew about me and Ricky. And it was only a matter of time before she told everyone else. The only choice I had was to beat her to the punch and tell at least someone other than Archie. In my mind, the best person was my mother. She\u2019d take the news far better than my father, for one thing. Also, I hoped she\u2019d understand, having gone through the same predicament herself. My mind made up, I walked to the end of the hall and crept into her room. My mother was barely awake, even though it was only late afternoon. Sunlight peeked between the drawn curtains at the windows, trying to trickle in the same way water did through a crack. \u201cIs that you, my darling?\u201d she murmured from the bed. I stood at the foot of it, trying to come up with the right words to say. But there was so much to be said--and so many questions to be asked--that I simply blurted out, \u201cIs it true? What Father said?\u201d A sigh rose from the covers my mother had buried herself under. \u201cYes, my darling.\u201d \u201cSo you don\u2019t love him?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d my mother said. \u201cDid you ever?\u201d \u201cNever.\u201d My mother sounded dreamy and distant. Like someone talking in her sleep. \u201cNever, ever. He knew it, too. He knew it and paid the man I did love to run away and never see me again. When that happened, I was trapped. I had no choice but to marry him.\u201d My mother\u2019s voice drifted into a slur. \u201cNo choice at all.\u201d The slur became a whisper. \u201cSorry, my darling.\u201d The whisper faded to a gasp. And then . . . nothing. \u201cMother?\u201d I rushed to her side, grabbing her shoulders and giving her a good shake. Jostled by the movement, her right hand flopped against the mattress, releasing the laudanum bottle she\u2019d been holding. It was completely empty. She\u2019d swallowed it all, likely right before I\u2019d entered her room. \u201cMother?\u201d I cried, shaking her even harder, trying to jolt her back into consciousness. But it was no use. As my mother lay there, motionless, the empty bottle of laudanum rolled across the mattress and hit the floor with a crash. \n TWENTY-NINE Lenora is giving me her version of the silent treatment, which involves refusing to tap out a response to even the most basic questions. Still, I try, continuing to ask her what she\u2019d like to do this evening. \u201cWould you like to try typing?\u201d Lenora\u2019s left hand doesn\u2019t rise from the bed. \u201cYou can listen to more of the book Jessie recorded for you. Would you like that?\u201d Again, nothing. \u201cOr I could read to you instead,\u201d I say. \u201cThat might be fun for neither of us.\u201d This at least gets a reaction. The corners of Lenora\u2019s mouth perk up into a half smile. But it fades as quickly as it formed, and her face returns to stony expressionlessness. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say for at least the fifth time that day. \u201cI mean it. And I\u2019ll replace the snow globe. I swear.\u201d We both know I can\u2019t. Lenora\u2019s murdered parents gave it to her more than fifty years ago. And I\u2019m the suspicious bitch who broke it. No wonder she\u2019s furious at me. I\u2019m mad at myself. For thinking she could possibly be faking her condition. And for being so paranoid that I thought a mostly paralyzed woman could have killed Mary. And for letting that paranoia destroy what\u2019s likely the last treasured possession she had. Now all I can do is continue to beg for her forgiveness. I even get down on my knees, kneeling in the flecks of gold glitter that remain on the floor. I can\u2019t rid my brain of the heartbroken way Lenora looked as I tried to salvage what was left of the snow globe. It was impossible. The globe itself was nothing but shards, and very little of the Parisian scene inside survived. Even the Eiffel Tower was ruined, having been snapped in two. All that remained was the base. A stump of gold. I had no choice but to sweep up the shattered pieces and drop them into the trash as a single tear leaked from Lenora\u2019s eyes. \u201cPlease, please forgive me,\u201d I said then and say again now. Finally, Lenora responds. A single tap against the mattress. No. \u201cWhat can I do to make it up to you? Anything you want, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Lenora shifts her gaze to the typewriter on the other side of the room. Now she wants to type. Quickly, I get up and wind a fresh page into the carriage. I bring the typewriter to the bed and place Lenora\u2019s left hand atop the keys. She presses seven of them. outside I stare at the word, surprised. \u201cYou want to go outside?\u201d Lenora raps twice against the typewriter. \u201cBut that\u2019s against the rules.\u201d Lenora bangs out another word. so Even without punctuation, I can tell she means it as a question. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want to go outside.\u201d i do, Lenora types. Adding, i miss it. \u201cSo you never told Mrs. Baker not to take you outside?\u201d Lenora balls her hand into a fist before smashing her knuckles against the typewriter, sending up a spray of keys that clatter together, none of them striking the page. Not that they need to. I understand her perfectly. No. But there must be a good reason why Mrs. Baker doesn\u2019t want her to go outside. I can think of three off the top of my head: The weather. Lenora\u2019s fragile condition. The sheer hassle of getting a wheelchair-bound woman down the steps. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d I say. Lenora taps yes. No surprise there. \u201cMrs. Baker won\u2019t be happy when she sees me trying to do it.\u201d she cant know It\u2019s official\u2014this is definitely a bad idea. I\u2019ll get in trouble if Mrs. Baker catches us. Which she will. There\u2019s no way I can bring Lenora down to the first floor and outside without someone noticing. I\u2019m not sure I can even do it at all. Not by myself. And when I get caught, I\u2019ll surely be sent packing, which will lead to being fired by Mr. Gurlain. I pace the room, my stomach clenching at the thought of being forced to return to my father\u2019s house, trapped in that endless cycle of loneliness and silence. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I tell Lenora. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s too risky.\u201d She types as I continue to pace. A full sentence banged out as quickly as her one good hand will allow. ill tell you what happened to the baby Lenora gives me a pleased-with-herself look. She knows it\u2019s an offer I can\u2019t resist. One that makes me wonder if this was her plan all along. Not for me to break the snow globe and feel so guilty I\u2019d promise her anything. No one could have planned that. But giving me just enough details about the night of the murders to make me want more? Refusing to type the moment I mentioned the baby? It\u2019s entirely possible Lenora did all that on purpose, waiting for the perfect moment to manipulate me into giving her what she wants. Two can play that game. \u201cYou\u2019ll also need to give me the rest of your story,\u201d I say. \u201cIf we do this, you\u2019ll have to tell me everything you told Mary. Just like you promised.\u201d Lenora doesn\u2019t type or tap a response, probably because she doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019ll be yet. Filling her silence is a swift knock on the door, followed by a voice saying, \u201cKit? Are you in there?\u201d Mrs. Baker. Speak of the devil. \u201cJust a second,\u201d I call before lugging the typewriter back to the desk. On my way to the door, I try to kick some of the remaining gold flakes under Lenora\u2019s bed. A fruitless attempt to cover up what I did. One glance at the shattered snow globe in the room\u2019s trash can will tell Mrs. Baker everything. I open the door, prepared for a lecture about how it\u2019s past Lenora\u2019s bedtime, which must be strictly observed. Instead, Mrs. Baker simply says, \u201cThere\u2019s someone here to see you.\u201d My body jolts in surprise. \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t say,\u201d Mrs. Baker replies, which I interpret to mean she didn\u2019t ask because she doesn\u2019t care. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting outside the front gate.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll go out to see him,\u201d I say, adding, \u201cAs soon as I put Miss Hope to bed. We\u2019re running behind this evening.\u201d Mrs. Baker surveys the room, practically sniffing like a bloodhound for signs something is amiss. If she sees the glitter on the floor or the broken glass in the trash, she doesn\u2019t show it. \u201cPlease tell your guest to call at a decent hour next time,\u201d she says, waiting until she\u2019s out the door to add the kicker. \u201cOr not at all.\u201d Quickly, I change Lenora into her bedclothes and arrange her beneath the covers. As I place the call button in her left hand, I whisper, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk more when I get back.\u201d Then I turn out the lights, grab a sweater from my room, and rush downstairs. Outside, the night is cold but clear, with stars twinkling brightly against a black velvet sky. I walk down the center of the driveway, wondering not just who awaits me at the end of it but why they\u2019re here. My hope is that it\u2019s Detective Vick, pulling me away from the others in the house to finally admit he believes me. My fear is that it\u2019s Kenny, angling for a peek of Lenora Hope for the second night in a row. I\u2019m wrong on both counts. It ends up being my father standing on the other side of the gate, gripping the bars like an inmate in a jail cell. He does a double take as I approach, as if I\u2019m the one making a surprise visit. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the uniform?\u201d he says. I ignore the question. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d \u201cI came to take you home.\u201d His calling it that makes me roll my eyes. That house hasn\u2019t felt like home in six months. \u201cWho told you I was here?\u201d \u201cKenny,\u201d my father says. \u201cAnd Rich Vick. And half the damn town. You didn\u2019t think I\u2019d find out you were taking care of Lenora Hope?\u201d I knew he would. Eventually. But judging by his reaction now, I was right not to tell him when I left. Giving him a cold stare through the gate\u2019s bars, I say, \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d \u201cBecause every person who knows you\u2019re working for that woman will think what the police have said is true. Soon everyone will think you\u2019re guilty.\u201d \u201cAnd what do you think, Dad?\u201d I say, pain slicing through my voice like a switchblade. \u201cWhat happened to your mother was an accident.\u201d He says it quickly. The way people do when they don\u2019t want you to notice they\u2019re lying. But my father\u2019s bad at it. He doesn\u2019t even look at me while he\u2019s doing it. \u201cI wish you really believed that.\u201d My chest tightens as grief and disappointment well up inside it, spilling out of my heart, pouring over my ribs. My eyes will be next if I don\u2019t leave immediately. I back away from the gate and start moving up the driveway. I refuse to let my father see me cry over him. \u201cGoodbye, Dad,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll see you when I see you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m worried about you being here. Rich Vick told me you\u2019re the one who found that dead girl.\u201d \u201cI was,\u201d I say, leaving out how Mary now haunts my every waking hour. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d haunt my dreams, too, if my mother left room for her. \u201cHe also told me you think she was murdered,\u201d my father adds. \u201cAccording to Kenny, so does everyone else. Everyone except your detective friend.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s true? That\u2019s what you really think?\u201d My father\u2019s back to gripping the gate, staring at me through the bars with an expression that\u2019s one part concern, two parts disbelief. He wants me to say no. Probably to spare him from looking like a fool when word of it inevitably spreads through town like the flu. Unlike him, I don\u2019t have the energy to lie. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s what I think.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all the more reason to get you away from this place.\u201d It gives me an even greater reason to stay. Since the town\u2019s only police detective doesn\u2019t believe Mary was murdered, it\u2019s up to me to prove that she was. And to find out who did it. Because it all seems to hinge on Lenora\u2019s past\u2014and how much of it Mary knew\u2014I can\u2019t leave until I learn the truth. I turn back toward Hope\u2019s End and say, \u201cDad, go home.\u201d \u201cKit, wait.\u201d I don\u2019t. I continue up the drive, fully aware my father\u2019s still watching, hoping I\u2019ll turn around, open the gate, follow him back to a house I no longer recognize. I keep my eyes fixed on the lights of Hope\u2019s End. It\u2019s not home, either. But I can\u2019t shake the feeling that my future rests inside this place where tragedy struck twice. Two separate nights. Decades apart. Yet linked to one person who I\u2019m pretty sure has all the answers but won\u2019t reveal them until she gets what she wants. Back in the house, I head straight for Lenora\u2019s room. She\u2019s still awake, her bright eyes aimed at the ceiling. \u201cDo we have a deal?\u201d I say. She taps twice against the call button. The matter\u2019s settled. Lenora\u2019s going outside. And the price for taking her there is the truth. \n THIRTY An opportunity to sneak Lenora outside presents itself two days later, when everyone else at Hope\u2019s End leaves to attend the funeral of Mary Milton. Although the mood is solemn, the weather is anything but. It\u2019s a gorgeous autumn day\u2014perhaps the last one of the season. Sun floods the sky, throwing off rays that take the sting out of the October chill. The cloudless sky is so blue it reminds me of sapphires. The Atlantic is calm, and for once the wind decides to take the day off. Not that the weather matters. Even if a hurricane was blowing through, I\u2019d take Lenora outside when given the chance. For the past two days, she continued to be mostly unresponsive, tapping out answers only when necessary. The result was long days of tense silence and uninterrupted boredom. The two of us simply sat, doing nothing. After that, even I\u2019m eager to get outdoors. I haven\u2019t told anyone else about my plan. Not even Lenora. I was tempted to tell Carter, but I opted not to just to be on the safe side. The last thing I want to do is run the risk of Mrs. Baker finding out and putting a stop to it. I watch from the top of the Grand Stairs as the others gather to leave, Archie and Carter in dark suits, Jessie going against the grain in a white wrap dress, and Mrs. Baker wearing what she normally does, with the addition of a wide-brimmed hat and cat\u2019s-eye sunglasses. As soon as they\u2019re gone, I rush to Lenora\u2019s room. It startles her when I begin to push her wheelchair toward the door. Her left hand flies off the armrest, flapping like the wing of a frightened bird. She looks up at me, her face a giant question mark. \u201cYou\u2019re getting your wish,\u201d I say before wheeling her out of her room. \u201cBut then you need to hold up your end of the bargain, okay?\u201d She happily taps twice on the armrest. \u201cGood,\u201d I say. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d I back the wheelchair out of the room. When we pass into the hall, Lenora lets out a huff of awe. It sounds like the relieved exhalation of someone who\u2019s been holding her breath a long, long time. Her eyes widen as we move backward down the hallway, trying to take in everything all at once. The carpet, the wallpaper, every door we pass. It makes me wonder how long it\u2019s been since she last left her room. Months? Years? Decades? Because the service stairs are too narrow for her wheelchair, I have no choice but to use the Grand Stairs. My first thought is to try to hoist Lenora over one shoulder and carry her down the steps and out the door. Good in theory, perhaps, but difficult in practice. I know my limits. Even if I can somehow manage to carry her all the way down the Grand Stairs, getting her back up will be twice as hard. My only choice is to slowly back the wheelchair down each step and hope for the best. \u201cHold on,\u201d I warn. \u201cIt\u2019s about to get bumpy.\u201d I tilt the wheelchair, say a little prayer, and slowly pull it down the first step. The impact jostles Lenora so hard I worry she\u2019s about to fall out. \u201cKeep going?\u201d Lenora unclenches her left hand from the armrest and responds with a hearty double tap. The next few steps are just as rough, but I soon find my groove. Going fast, ironically, is better than going slow. Rather than stopping and starting step by jarring step, I lower the wheelchair to the landing in one continuous pull. Lenora shimmies like a bowl of Jell-O the whole time, but at least she\u2019s not almost knocked out of the chair. I do it again on the way to the ground floor, the chair settling onto the tile in a shuddering thud. \u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask Lenora. She looks back at me with unabashed glee. Her green eyes dance, and a blush of joy paints her cheeks. If she could laugh, I suspect she\u2019d be cackling right now. We head toward the dining room, doing a quick spin around the massive table there and passing the equally large fireplace before heading to the French doors. I fling them open and make sure there\u2019s a clear path for the wheelchair. More slate shingles have fallen from the roof in the past two days. A veritable rainfall of them. Each day, Jessie and Carter have swept them up, only to have more appear in the morning. Today, the terrace is clean of them, allowing me to see fresh cracks crisscrossing its marble surface. Not a good sign. But also not enough to keep me from granting Lenora\u2019s single wish. I return to the wheelchair. Before emerging onto the terrace, Lenora reaches out to me with her left hand. I take it, feeling the rush of her pulse beneath the skin. Then I lead her outside. The wind, sunshine, and sea air hit us all at once. Lenora gasps, delighted. I bring her to the edge of the terrace, stopping only when her knees touch the railing. Closing her eyes, she tilts her face to the sky and basks in the sun. Her hair catches the wind, the gray tendrils streaming in the breeze. Seeing her so ecstatic about something as simple as being outside makes me both sad that she can\u2019t enjoy this on a regular basis and furious at Mrs. Baker for confining her indoors. I stand beside Lenora, leaning on the railing, watching the waves far below. While certainly lovely, it\u2019s not much different than the view she gets from her bedroom windows. Because there\u2019s so much risk involved\u2014and because it might never happen again\u2014I want her to experience something different. Something special. \u201cLenora,\u201d I say, \u201cwhen was the last time you got to lie down in the grass and look up at the clouds?\u201d I know the answer, even if Lenora can\u2019t provide it. Decades. I guide the wheelchair to the end of the terrace, pull it down the steps to the lawn, and, careful to stay far away from the new, unimproved cliff\u2019s edge, park it in the grass. I then lift Lenora out of her chair and lower her until she\u2019s on her back, facing the sky. I lie down next to her, and together we stare at the endless blue overhead. We stay like that for a long time. Maybe an hour. Maybe more. I\u2019m not sure because I doze off, lulled to sleep by the wind, waves, and sunshine. Nights at Hope\u2019s End haven\u2019t gotten any easier. I\u2019m still having nightmares of my mother and still hearing sounds from Lenora\u2019s room that, when I inevitably get out of bed to check, end up being nothing. I wake each morning exhausted, blinking in the harsh light of sunrise and finding a mattress slid slightly lower than the morning before it. Now, though, I awake to the sun higher in the sky and Lenora next to me, taking deep, contented breaths. \u201cIt\u2019s time to talk about the baby,\u201d I say. Lenora\u2019s breathing stops. A sign she doesn\u2019t want to. But she must. Even though I don\u2019t want to ruin her special outing, she needs to hold up her end of the bargain. When she exhales, I say, \u201cWas the baby born?\u201d I sit up, watching her left hand as it taps twice against the ground. \u201cA boy or a girl?\u201d I say, even though I know Lenora can\u2019t answer by tapping. I rephrase the question. \u201cWas it a girl?\u201d One tap. \u201cSo it was a boy.\u201d Lenora nods this time, a flicker of a smile crossing her face. It quickly fades when I say, \u201cWhat happened to him? Did he die?\u201d One tap. \u201cDid you give him away?\u201d One tap. My heart sinks. I don\u2019t want to ask the next question. After a pause, I say, \u201cWas he taken away?\u201d Lenora pauses as well, waiting a good thirty seconds before she taps the ground once, twice. \u201cDo you know what happened to him after that?\u201d After another long pause, I receive only a single tap from Lenora. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say, closing my eyes to hold back tears that have suddenly formed. I can\u2019t imagine being that young, getting pregnant, giving birth, and then having the baby taken from me. It\u2019s beyond cruel. It\u2019s horrific. I open my eyes to see that Lenora\u2019s expression hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s a blank mask facing the sky, hiding the deep pain that\u2019s surely present all these years later. If it turns out Carter really is her grandson, maybe some of that pain will ease. I hope so. \u201cBefore she died, did Mary draw blood from your arm?\u201d Lenora taps twice, confirming my suspicion about the cause of the bruise on her left arm. \u201cDid she tell you why?\u201d One tap. \u201cBut she knew about the baby, right? You told her?\u201d Two taps. \u201cJust like you also told her who killed your parents and sister.\u201d Another two taps, slower this time. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason you haven\u2019t told me yet,\u201d I say, because there must be. She\u2019s typed nothing for almost three days. In that time, she could have revealed all. Hell, she could have done it my first night here. One sentence is all it would take. \u201cAre you ever going to tell me?\u201d Lenora hesitates, her left hand hovering over the ground, as if she\u2019s not sure of the answer. I feel the same way. Also hovering. Also uncertain. As much as I need to know the truth, I\u2019m also cognizant of the danger it might put me in. If Lenora finally tells me and someone else finds out, I could end up just like Mary. I stare across the grass to the edge of the cliff. No railing there. Just a straight, screaming drop into the ocean. Lenora\u2019s aware of it, too, even though she can\u2019t see it from where she lies. There\u2019s no way to miss its presence. It pulls at us, daring us to come closer, peer over the edge, tempt fate. It dawns on me that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing since the moment I arrived at Hope\u2019s End. Edging toward the forbidden. Looking at things I shouldn\u2019t see, poking at things that shouldn\u2019t be poked. All because of a misguided hope that proving Lenora\u2019s innocence might somehow make me look innocent as well. Her left hand finally taps the ground. Just once. No. Seeing it sends anger sparking through my body. \u201cBut you promised.\u201d Lenora winces, as if she regrets that. I don\u2019t care. We had a deal. I take her outside\u2014not an easy task\u2014and she finally tells me everything. I\u2019m damn well going to hold her to it. \u201cYou need to uphold your end of the bargain.\u201d Lenora gives the ground an adamant single tap. \u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cRight now.\u201d I stand as Lenora steadily raps her fist against the grass, making her stance crystal clear. No, no, no. I ignore it, even as I understand all the obvious reasons she doesn\u2019t want to tell me. Mary. Her missing suitcase. Her corpse buried in the sand. The big difference between Mary\u2019s situation and mine is that she left with Lenora\u2019s story when others were here, mistakenly believing the cover of night would keep her safe. But right now, in broad daylight, there\u2019s no one else at Hope\u2019s End. It\u2019s just me and Lenora and an opportunity to finish what we started. I\u2019m ready to tempt fate one last time. And Lenora\u2019s going to be along for the ride whether she wants to or not. I run back into the house, take the service stairs two at a time, and burst into Lenora\u2019s room. At the desk, I grab a fresh sheet of paper and roll it into the typewriter carriage. Because Lenora might use more than one piece, I take a whole stack, setting the paper on top of the typewriter before hoisting it off the desk. Carrying the typewriter down the stairs is harder than moving it to Lenora\u2019s bed. The greater distance puts more strain on my arms, and the typewriter feels heavier with each passing step. To keep the blank pages on top from slipping, I bend forward and use my chin as a paperweight. At the service stairs, I realize I can\u2019t see where I\u2019m going. I take each step slowly, dropping blindly from one to the next. At one point I misstep and knock into the cracked wall, jostling loose a chunk of plaster that falls onto the staircase. I crunch over it on my way to the bottom. After clearing the stairs, I shuffle through the kitchen, the typewriter getting heavier and heavier. My arms feel like jelly. My legs do, too. In the dining room, I huff a sigh of relief when I realize I never closed the French doors on my way inside. That\u2019s at least one thing I won\u2019t need to deal with. Tired and heaving, I carry the typewriter onto the terrace. Lenora\u2019s there. Not on the grass, where I\u2019d left her, but right there on the terrace, sitting in her wheelchair and staring at the sea. \u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d My voice leaves me when I see them. Mrs. Baker and Archie, Carter and Jessie. They all stand off to the side of the terrace, their expressions as varied as their personalities. Carter\u2019s is concerned. Jessie looks mildly surprised. Archie\u2019s face is blank. And Mrs. Baker? She\u2019s pissed. Clearly busted, I lower the typewriter. The blank pages come loose and catch the breeze. I watch them swirl and skid across the terrace before taking flight. Over the railing. Off the cliff. Into the churning water far below. \n My mother would have died if I hadn\u2019t entered her room, a fact made clear by Dr. Walden, the family physician. What wasn\u2019t clear was if she drank all the laudanum by accident or did it on purpose. Everyone else swore it had to have been accidental. I, on the other hand, assumed my mother intended to take her own life. She remained silent on the matter, making it more uncertain. Dr. Walden, either through stupidity or greed, continued to keep the laudanum flowing, using the excuse that cutting my mother off all at once would cause more harm than good. He recommended weaning her off the substance slowly. As a result, nothing changed. Life at Hope\u2019s End quickly returned to the way it had always been. My mother remained wasting away in her room, my father was frequently gone on business, and my sister pretended nothing was wrong by filling her social calendar. The only thing that changed was me. By the end of September, my pregnancy was showing more and more. That I had managed to hide it for so long was a small miracle accomplished only through craftiness on my part and inattentiveness on the part of everyone else. But time was running out. I knew that soon it would be impossible to hide. Until that day came, however, I was determined to keep it a secret from my family. Yet there was only so much I could do on my own. Food, for example, became a problem. I was ravenous all day and night, prompting a weight gain too noticeable to escape even my father\u2019s lax attention. He put me on a diet so strict it wasn\u2019t fit for a woman of any condition, let alone one who was eating for two. I needed someone besides Archie to sneak proper meals to me. It was the same with clothing. My mother\u2019s maid continued to let out my dresses, tsking at each request to alter yet another garment. I needed new clothes designed to better hide my pregnancy, which I couldn\u2019t just sneak out and buy for myself. Someone else had to do it for me. Then there was the matter of my health. I hadn\u2019t seen a doctor since becoming pregnant. I spent nights lying awake worrying about how I didn\u2019t know if something was wrong with the baby. But I didn\u2019t dare approach Dr. Walden about an examination. I needed to see a new doctor. A stranger. One who would remain silent about my condition. If the two of us had shared a typical bond, I would have turned to my sister for help. I\u2019d always hated that we weren\u2019t close, always assuming it was my fault instead of hers. In truth, it was no one\u2019s fault. We were simply different. There was a gulf in our personalities that was too wide to overcome. I was like my mother, always feeling too much, wanting too much, needing too much. Like my father, my sister had wants and needs, too, but they were surface pleasures. Cars and clothes and societal approval from snobs just like them. They held no emotion other than ambition. Without my sister to depend on, I required help from a member of the household staff. Someone discreet. Someone who knew how to keep a secret. The only person I could think of was the one you\u2019d least expect. My father\u2019s mistress. That\u2019s how I found myself standing in the southern hall on the last day of September. My father had returned from Boston the day before, looking more tired than I\u2019d ever seen him. His mood was foul at dinner as he and my sister enjoyed a full meal while I picked at a salad designed to, in his words, \u201crestore my girlish figure.\u201d After dinner, he retreated to the sunroom. A few minutes later, I followed, creeping toward the end of the hall. Noises rose from behind the sunroom\u2019s closed doors. My father\u2019s low chuckle and the high-pitched peal of a woman\u2019s laugh. A laugh that wasn\u2019t my mother\u2019s. Even if it sounded the same, which it didn\u2019t, I knew it wasn\u2019t her because she was currently upstairs in her room, likely taking yet another swig from her bottle of laudanum. I snuck down the hall, which had turned gloomy in the evening dusk. I could barely make out the portraits as I passed. That was for the best. I had zero desire to look at them. Father. Mother. Two dutiful daughters. All of it was a lie. Upon reaching the sunroom, I held my breath, fearful one small exhalation would expose my presence. I stood outside the door, listening to my father\u2019s groaning and panting, disgusted by his animalistic needs. It didn\u2019t occur to me then that they were the same sounds Ricky made when we were together. Only later did I realize all men were alike. It didn\u2019t matter if they were rich or poor, fat or thin, old or young. Their needs were so basic it was laughable. Once the passionate moaning had ended, I hurried away to the library, pretending to read a book in case my father looked in as he passed. He didn\u2019t, of course. He simply strode by, sated, on his way to another part of the house. It wasn\u2019t until I heard his mistress leave the sunroom that I sprang from my chair and ran to the doorway, ready to intercept her. I expected to see someone like Sally, the voluptuous new maid, or even brittle, bitter Berniece Mayhew. Instead, the woman who emerged from the sunroom smoothing her skirts was the person I least expected to be engaged in an affair with my father. Frozen in shock, I could only stand in the middle of the hallway and stare at her. She stared back, also surprised. \u201cYou?\u201d I said. \u201cYes,\u201d Miss Baker replied with a weary huff. \u201cMe.\u201d \n THIRTY-ONE The typewriter is gone. Mrs. Baker removed it from my arms once the last loose sheet of paper had taken flight. At first, I stupidly thought she was trying to help me. Or at least get the typewriter out of my hands while she berated me for bringing Lenora outside. Instead, she said nothing as she lugged it across the terrace, the lone page in the carriage flapping in the breeze. Then, with a grunt and a heave, she hoisted the typewriter over the railing and let it drop. I gasped when it fell from view. Jessie let out a horrified yelp. Even Lenora reacted, her left hand reaching out as far as she could muster, as if that alone might reverse the typewriter\u2019s fall. Pleased with herself, Mrs. Baker wiped her hands together and strode to the French doors. All she said as she passed me was, \u201cTake Miss Hope back upstairs where she belongs.\u201d Carter helped me with that, scooping Lenora in his arms and carrying her up the Grand Stairs as I pulled the wheelchair up step by rattling step. In Lenora\u2019s room, he gently placed her in the wheelchair before turning to me. \u201cWhat do you think\u2019s going to happen?\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019m going to be fired,\u201d I said. It was the only logical outcome. But it wouldn\u2019t be Mrs. Baker doing the firing. She\u2019d leave that to Mr. Gurlain, who I was certain would be all too happy to banish me from the agency. \u201cShit,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Kit. This is all my fault.\u201d In truth, it was mine. I knew the rules. I broke them anyway, simply because I wanted answers that I\u2019ll never get now that the typewriter is gone. All I received in exchange for my transgression was a tidbit of information that might help Carter. The only silver lining in this dark cloud of a day. \u201cLenora had the baby,\u201d I said after pulling him into my room and closing the adjoining door so Lenora couldn\u2019t hear us from hers. \u201cA boy. She confirmed it.\u201d \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know. All Lenora could tell me is that they took the baby away from her.\u201d Carter dropped onto my bed, trying to process it all. Not just the suffering Lenora went through or the cruelty behind it, but also how it seemed to support his theory about being her grandson. \u201cSo I might be right,\u201d he said. \u201cLenora and I might really be related.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a definite possibility.\u201d I joined him on the bed, our shoulders touching. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t find out more.\u201d Carter flashed that crooked smile I\u2019d become slightly enamored of over the past few days. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I wouldn\u2019t have learned any of this without you.\u201d \u201cBut now that you know it, be careful. Whoever killed Mary is still here.\u201d \u201cOr out there,\u201d Carter said. Maybe, but I doubted it. I thought more than ever that Mary\u2019s killer was someone at Hope\u2019s End. Specifically the woman who would be sending me packing at any minute. But those minutes turned to hours, bleeding from afternoon into evening. In that time, I heard nothing about being let go. Not when Archie brought up dinner for me and Lenora. Not when I mixed her crushed pills into her food or did her circulation exercises or gave her a bath. Now I\u2019m putting Lenora to bed, noticing the way in which her gaze flits to the desk. It seems so big without the typewriter on it, so empty. The same can be said of the sideboard, on which used to rest her snow globe. Now there\u2019s just the Walkman. Likely the next thing Lenora will lose. And she\u2019s already lost so much. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lenora,\u201d I say as I place the call button in her left hand. \u201cI know how much you liked using it. I wish I could have heard the rest of your story.\u201d Even though it\u2019s not an official goodbye, it feels like one. Because surely I\u2019ll be gone by morning\u2014if not sooner. I suspect the only reason I\u2019m still here is because Mrs. Baker is trying to cajole Mr. Gurlain into assigning another caregiver to Lenora. One who, unlike me, has the power to decline the job. Assuming I\u2019ll never see her again after this, I pat Lenora\u2019s hand and say, \u201cIt was a pleasure caring for you. I hope whoever takes my place will make you happy.\u201d I leave her after that, sweeping into my room and closing the adjoining door behind me. Now all I need to do is pack up my things and wait for the axe to inevitably fall. Not that there\u2019s much packing to be done. I never did get around to replacing Mary\u2019s belongings with my own. The books are still in their box. My suitcase full of clothes sits atop the dresser. All that\u2019s left to be done is take the lockbox out from under the bed, collect grooming products from the bathroom, and change out of my uniform and into the clothes I wore when I arrived. I start with the lockbox. Opening the nightstand, I take out the key. I then drop to my knees and slide the box from beneath the bed. I unlock it and open the lid. Inside are Lenora\u2019s pills\u2014and nothing else. The pages we\u2019d typed\u2014all of them\u2014are gone. I hop to my feet, push out the door, and stomp down the hallway. The service stairs shake as I angrily descend to the kitchen, in search of Mrs. Baker. I find her in the dining room, sitting alone at the massive table, a recently opened bottle of wine in front of her. The room is dim\u2014lit only by a small blaze in the fireplace. Its flickering glow reflects off Mrs. Baker\u2019s glasses, masking her eyes as she lifts a wineglass to her lips and takes a sip. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to be more specific than that, dear.\u201d \u201cThe pages Lenora and I typed,\u201d I say, forcing the words through clenched teeth. \u201cI know you have them.\u201d \u201cHad, dear,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cI had them.\u201d She gestures to the fireplace, where a few bits of scorched paper surround the single log burning inside. On one of them, I spot a typed word halfway eaten by flame. Seeing it sends me stumbling backward into one of the dining room chairs, which hits the floor with a clatter. \u201cYou had no right to do that,\u201d I say. \u201cThose pages belonged to me.\u201d \u201cAnd what was on them belonged to Miss Hope. Which means they fell under my authority.\u201d Mrs. Baker takes another satisfied sip of wine. \u201cJust like the typewriter.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to destroy them!\u201d I yell, the words bursting out of me. Since I\u2019m about to be sent packing, I see no need to control my anger. Mrs. Baker, far calmer than I, nods toward the toppled chair and says, \u201cSit with me a minute, Kit. I think it\u2019s time for a nice chat.\u201d I remain standing, disobeying her yet again. \u201cSuit yourself,\u201d she says with a shrug. \u201cI assume you expect to be fired.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I say. Why lie at this point? \u201cYou\u2019re free to go, if you\u2019re so inclined. No one is forcing you to stay here.\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019re not forcing me to leave?\u201d \u201cNo, dear,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cBut I would like to know whose idea it was to take Miss Hope outside.\u201d \u201cHers.\u201d \u201cI thought so. Honestly, it doesn\u2019t surprise me. Miss Hope can be very . . . persuasive. It makes sense she\u2019d convince you to disobey my clear wishes.\u201d \u201cYour wishes,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat about Lenora\u2019s?\u201d \u201cThey are one and the same.\u201d Mrs. Baker sets down her glass and runs the pad of her finger around the rim. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s obvious you don\u2019t approve of my methods.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cEven if it\u2019s for Miss Hope\u2019s own good?\u201d \u201cIs it?\u201d I say. \u201cYou keep her a prisoner in her own house. She has no friends. No visitors. She only sees people who are paid to take care of her. You won\u2019t even let her go outside, for God\u2019s sake. Even inmates\u2014literal prison inmates\u2014are allowed to do that.\u201d \u201cWhat if I did? What do you think she\u2019d encounter? Hatred, that\u2019s what. Judgment. Constant suspicion. The world is not a kind place for women accused of violence. You, of all people, should understand that. Don\u2019t people judge you for what happened to your mother?\u201d Too stunned to stand, I finally sit. Not on the chair, but on the floor beside it. I land next to the fireplace. Heat from the crackling blaze inside it stings my skin. But nothing\u2019s as hot as the shame that burns through me. \u201cHow long have you known?\u201d I say. \u201cSince before you arrived. Mr. Gurlain felt it was his duty to notify me.\u201d Of course he did. I have no doubt he also assumed it would kill my chances of working here\u2014or anywhere, for that matter. What I don\u2019t understand is why it didn\u2019t work. \u201cIf you knew, why did you let me come here?\u201d \u201cBecause I thought you and Miss Hope would be a good fit,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cAnd I was right. You understand her. In fact, you even like her.\u201d The comment throws me, mostly because I\u2019m not certain I do. I like Lenora some of the time. Other times, she scares me. Or leaves me frustrated. Or fills me with pity, which then brings me back full circle into wanting to like her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to admit it,\u201d Mrs. Baker says. \u201cMiss Hope can be very charming when it suits her needs. But let me make one thing clear\u2014you\u2019re nothing to her. I know you think you are. That you share a bond unique to her nurses. It\u2019s not. She\u2019s done this kind of thing before, going back decades. She\u2019s smarter than she appears, as I\u2019m sure you know. Some would even call her wily.\u201d I nod, for the description fits. Lenora uses silence and stillness to her advantage, concealing much, revealing little. As a result, every small detail you learn about her leaves you only wanting more. i want to tell you everything That\u2019s what Lenora typed my first night here. And I\u2019ve been starved for that information ever since, willing to break every rule. It doesn\u2019t matter that a week has passed and I still know next to nothing. \u201cWhat would you call her?\u201d I say. \u201cManipulative.\u201d Although Mrs. Baker smacks her lips together, as if savoring the word like it\u2019s the wine in her glass, her tone reveals a different emotion. Distaste. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s what caused poor Mary to do what she did,\u201d Mrs. Baker continues. \u201cMiss Hope made her feel needed. Made her feel special. When Mary realized that wasn\u2019t the case, it drove her to do the unthinkable.\u201d Detective Vick\u2019s voice echoes through my thoughts, reciting Mary\u2019s alleged suicide note. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not the person you thought I was.\u201d Did he also tell Mrs. Baker what it said? And does she genuinely believe Mary killed herself? I try to study her face, looking for signs she does. It\u2019s unreadable, especially with the flames from the fireplace still dancing in the reflection of her glasses. \u201cWhy do you stay here?\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s a rather bold question.\u201d \u201cOne I\u2019d like you to answer. If you hate Lenora so much, why are you still here?\u201d \u201cIf I hated her, I would have left years ago. And this place would have fallen apart without me.\u201d I think of the tiles raining from the roof, the cracks in the walls of the service stairs, the swath of lawn that now rests at the bottom of the ocean. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, it is.\u201d Mrs. Baker tilts her wineglass back and empties it. \u201cIt would already be rubble if not for me. The things I\u2019ve had to do to keep this place standing. Selling it off bit by bit to pay for one repair or another. Trust me, it would be all too easy to leave. But Miss Hope needs me. I stay here out of a sense of devotion.\u201d \u201cBut devotion only goes so far,\u201d I say. \u201cYou still get something out of being here, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cI knew you were bright,\u201d Mrs. Baker says, making it sound like a liability. \u201cYes, our arrangement provides me with certain benefits. Miss Hope and I came to an agreement years ago. If I somehow keep this place standing, she\u2019ll pass it on to me when she dies.\u201d \u201cAll of it?\u201d I say. \u201cThe land. The house. Everything in it.\u201d The fire next to me is quickly dying, its glow finally fading from Mrs. Baker\u2019s glasses. Behind the lenses, her blue eyes seem to catch what little light remains and take on a vibrant shine. I stare at them, unsettled, wondering if she\u2019s aware of just how close she is to having that plan fall apart. All it would take is for someone to come along and contest the agreement. Lenora\u2019s grandson, for example. I consider mentioning that I know Lenora had a baby. I don\u2019t because, just like Archie, I doubt Mrs. Baker will be honest about it. Also, I see no reason to make myself a target. If I\u2019m not one already. Because her revelation that she\u2019ll inherit Hope\u2019s End makes me suspect there are secrets Mrs. Baker would do anything to keep. And that she had every reason in the world to kill Mary. \n Miss Baker made us tea and took me back to the sunroom for what she called \u201ca nice chat.\u201d As if nothing about our respective roles had changed. I was still the pupil and she the proper lady tasked with teaching me how to become the same. Only I seemed to see the ridiculousness of that. After all, I knew what she\u2019d been doing with my father in that same sunroom minutes earlier. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d she said, addressing the situation as if we both had a say in the matter. She didn\u2019t. \u201cYou can start by telling me why,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy my father? Do you love him?\u201d Miss Baker could barely hold back her laughter. \u201cNo, child. What we have is strictly transactional. I give him what he wants, and he rewards me with small tokens of appreciation.\u201d Money, in other words. For all her talk of manners and propriety, Miss Baker was nothing but a high-class whore. My disgust with her must have shown in my expression, because she snapped, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare judge me, young lady. Someone like you, born into enormous wealth, has no idea what it\u2019s like for the rest of us. The things we need to do to survive. Especially unmarried women like me. I\u2019m simply looking out for my future.\u201d \u201cAt what price?\u201d I said. \u201cThe highest one I can get.\u201d Miss Baker leaned back in her seat, daring me to say another critical word. \u201cIs that what all this is about? You wanted to confront me? Try to shame me?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI wanted to show you this.\u201d I stood, pulled the fabric of my dress tight against me, and turned so Miss Baker could see my growing stomach in profile. \u201cDear me,\u201d she said as she set her teacup on its saucer. Her hands shook so much the teacup rattled the whole way to the table at her side. \u201cHow far along are you?\u201d \u201cSix months.\u201d \u201cAnd the father?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you,\u201d I said, unwilling to risk bringing Ricky into this. If Miss Baker knew, she might tell my father, who would surely fire him. Then there\u2019d be no hope of Ricky and me scraping together enough money for the one thing I most desperately wanted to do--escape. \u201cDid he force himself on you?\u201d Miss Baker said. My face turned red as I shook my head and looked at the floor, too ashamed to face her. \u201cI see.\u201d Miss Baker paused to clear her throat. \u201cDoes he know about your . . . predicament?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAnd what does he intend to do?\u201d \u201cMake an honest woman out of me,\u201d I said, which prompted a rueful laugh from Miss Baker. Hearing it made me flinch. \u201cYou\u2019re still practically a child,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd a good man would have restrained himself. Or at least taken precautions.\u201d Still stinging from the way her laughter echoed through the sunroom, I gave her a hard stare and said, \u201cDoes my father?\u201d Miss Baker stiffened in her seat. \u201cWhat exactly do you want from me?\u201d \u201cYour help.\u201d I listed all the ways in which I needed assistance, from procuring maternity clothes to accessing the proper amount of food. This needed to occur long enough for Ricky and me to plan our escape. I finished by telling her that it all had to be done in secret. \u201cThat\u2019s a tall order,\u201d Miss Baker said. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019ll be willing to help?\u201d \u201cBecause if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll tell my mother everything.\u201d The corners of Miss Baker\u2019s mouth lifted in a cruel smile. \u201cYour mother already knows.\u201d \u201cThen I\u2019ll tell Berniece Mayhew,\u201d I said, knowing full well she was the biggest gossip among the household staff. \u201cAbout you and my father and what the two of you have been doing when you think no one is watching. Once that gets out, good luck finding another job teaching etiquette. Everyone will know exactly what kind of lady you are.\u201d Miss Baker stood in a huff, looking like she wanted to slap me across the face, storm out of the room, or both. I suspected the only reason she didn\u2019t was because she knew she was trapped. \u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d she finally said. We shook hands. She promised to see about buying me some new clothes in the morning, followed by arranging a visit from a doctor whose discretion was assured. I told her that Archie had agreed to set aside an extra plate of food at every meal and give it to her to bring up to my room. \u201cWho else knows about this?\u201d Miss Baker said. \u201cJust Archie,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd now you.\u201d To her credit, Miss Baker refrained from mentioning my sister or my mother. She had been at Hope\u2019s End long enough to observe that neither of them would have been of any help to me. When we parted ways, I felt a newfound sense of optimism that my plan could actually work. It would require caution, of course, and perhaps a little bit of luck. But for the first time in weeks I saw a path that led me away from Hope\u2019s End, away from my family, and into a bright, happy future with Ricky and our child. The only thing I didn\u2019t count on was that, no matter how cautious I was, luck failed to be on my side. And that when I shook hands with Miss Baker, I was in fact making a deal with the devil. \n THIRTY-TWO I leave the dining room as Mrs. Baker pours another drink. The sound of wine spilling into her glass follows me across the kitchen, replaced by a loud, sloppy sip as I reach the service stairs. As I climb to the second floor, I try to piece together how she could have killed Mary. First, Mrs. Baker got wind of the fact that Lenora was telling Mary her story. Most likely she was passing by, heard the typewriter, and realized what was happening. She could have even crept in at night and read what Lenora had written. Maybe Mrs. Baker also knew about Carter\u2019s quest to prove he\u2019s Lenora\u2019s grandson. It\u2019s obvious she keeps a close eye on what\u2019s happening inside Hope\u2019s End. She likely spends more time observing than anything else. Which makes it equally as likely that she found out Mary and Carter\u2019s plan. Then, on the night Mary left the house with the suitcase, Mrs. Baker struck. I can even picture it as I continue up the stairs. Mary rushing across the terrace with a suitcase that contained dozens of typewritten pages and a sample of Lenora\u2019s blood. Mrs. Baker emerging from the shadow of the house. Fast. Grabbing the suitcase. Breaking the handle. Giving Mary a shove. It\u2019s possible Mrs. Baker had no intention of killing her. Maybe she just wanted to throw Mary off-balance long enough to get the suitcase away from her. But death was the end result. Mary slipped over the railing, fell to her death, remained there for days. And Mrs. Baker had no choice but to tell everyone that Mary left in the middle of the night. I know a lot of that is conjecture. Just like I know that the truth could be far different from what my wild imagination came up with. I even know it\u2019s possible Mrs. Baker had nothing to do with Mary\u2019s death. The only things I\u2019m sure of, really, are that Mary left Hope\u2019s End with a suitcase in her hand. That whoever has it now is very likely the person who killed her. And that Mrs. Baker is the most obvious culprit. At the top of the stairs, I impulsively hurry past both my room and Lenora\u2019s, stopping only when I reach Mrs. Baker\u2019s door. I try the doorknob, which twists in my hand. When I let go, the door gently creaks wide open. Even though I know it\u2019s merely a trick of the house\u2019s tilt, I can\u2019t help but think of it as an invitation to enter. I check the hall in both directions until I\u2019m certain no one is around. Then, with a breath and a prayer, I slip inside. Closing the door behind me, I stop and gaze around the room. It\u2019s the same shape and size as Lenora\u2019s quarters, with the only differences being the lack of a door leading into another room and the location of the en suite bath. That\u2019s on the other side of the room in a mirror image of Lenora\u2019s. Two lights are already on inside. A relief. It saves me from having to turn them on and then remember to flick them off before I leave. One is a lamp on the nightstand, which casts a glow over Mrs. Baker\u2019s immaculately made bed. The second is a floor lamp in the corner, which sheds enough light over the other half of the room. I see a dresser, an antique dressing table with an oval mirror, and a sideboard similar to the one in Lenora\u2019s room. Instead of a Walkman on top, this one holds a gramophone, complete with a lily-shaped horn to amplify the music. Quickly and quietly, I slide open dresser drawers and peek into the sideboard, finding nothing of interest. They\u2019re too small to hold a suitcase, and if Mrs. Baker had the pages that were in it, I suspect they suffered the same fate as the ones Lenora and I typed. As for the sample of Lenora\u2019s blood Mary took, that was likely also destroyed. Just in case, I sit at the dressing table and root through the drawers, which contain nothing but rattling jewelry and rolling lipstick tubes. Atop the table is a framed photograph of a young couple in front of the Eiffel Tower. Snow falls around the pair as they huddle together beneath the man\u2019s overcoat. The woman in the photo I assume to be Mrs. Baker, albeit fifty years younger than the person currently gulping down wine in the dining room. They have the same eyes, same nose, same chin. That\u2019s where the resemblance ends. In the photograph, she sports marcelled hair and a wide, genuine smile, something I\u2019ve never seen from Mrs. Baker. The man in the picture is tall, handsome, and maybe ten years older than her. I assume he\u2019s the fianc\u00e9 Mrs. Baker mentioned the day I arrived. The one whose death prompted her return to Hope\u2019s End. From the way they\u2019re looking at each other in the photo, the two of them definitely seem in love. I move to the other side of the room, where the most likely hiding places reside. Under the bed. In the armoire. Beneath the large sink in the bathroom, which is where I continue my search, yielding nothing. I get the same result when I crack open the armoire doors. Hanging inside is an array of black dresses, with a few pairs of sensible black shoes sitting in a row beneath them. My last stop is to check the area around the bed. On the nightstand is another framed photograph of the same man as the one on the dressing table. He\u2019s alone in this one, looking dashing in an army uniform. I drop to my hands and knees to check under the bed. Instead of a suitcase, I find several shoeboxes. I pull one out and open it, taking care not to leave clean marks on the dusty lid. Inside are more photographs. I sort through them, seeing a young Mrs. Baker in a variety of situations. Wearing a satin gown and lifting a glass of champagne in a toast. Walking down the street with two other women, their arms linked, mouths open in mid-laugh. Reclining naked on a chaise in what appears to be an artist\u2019s studio, her modesty preserved by only two well-placed feathered fans. They\u2019re a potent reminder that Mrs. Baker once had a life outside the tilted walls of Hope\u2019s End. A happy one, from the looks of it. I wonder how much she misses it, how much she wants it again, and how far she\u2019d go to make that happen. I put the photos back in the box, replace the lid, and slide it back under the bed. Instead of photographs, the next box I grab is full of receipts and copies of cleared checks. All of them bear Lenora\u2019s signature, although it\u2019s clearly the work of Mrs. Baker. I grab a handful and thumb through them. Electric bill. Paid monthly, although there\u2019ve been a few late payments and, once earlier this year, a warning that service was about to be terminated. Grocery bill. Paid like clockwork every Tuesday when the delivery from the market in town arrives. At the bottom of the box is a stack of checks all made out to Ocean View Retirement Home. One thousand dollars a month, going back at least a dozen years. I\u2019ve heard of Ocean View, of course. It\u2019s the only nursing home in town. I even applied to be an aide there after Mr. Gurlain suspended me. I was told I was overqualified for the job, which somehow felt more insulting than if they had told me the truth\u2014that, given my reputation, they thought hiring me would be like inviting a wolf to watch over a flock of sheep. What I don\u2019t understand is why Mrs. Baker is paying all that money for a nursing home when Lenora\u2019s right here, being cared for by me, Mary, a long line of other nurses. I\u2019m still looking at the cleared checks when my attention is caught by a sound in the hallway. Footsteps. Coming down the hall. Almost at the door. I slap the lid atop the shoebox and shove it back under the bed. Then I leap to my feet and hurry . . . nowhere. There\u2019s no place for me to go. I can\u2019t sprint out the door if Mrs. Baker\u2019s coming in, and the only hiding place I can think of is in the bathroom, which is likely where she\u2019ll head first. Resigned to being caught\u2014which this time will surely get me fired\u2014I start to raise my hands in surrender. That\u2019s when I spot the armoire. Without thinking, I bolt toward it, throw open the doors, and back myself inside. Crouched behind identical black sheaths, I pull the armoire doors shut just as the bedroom door is pushed open. Through the thin crack between the armoire doors, I see Mrs. Baker enter the room. From the way she sways, I assume she quickly polished off the entire bottle of wine herself. She drifts to the gramophone on the sideboard and turns it on. One dropped needle later, music starts blasting through the room. \u201cLet\u2019s Misbehave.\u201d Mrs. Baker drunkenly sings along, croaking out every other word. \u201cAlone . . . chaperone.\u201d Her head bobs in time to the music, her hands undulate in the air, and her singing gets louder. \u201cCan get . . . number.\u201d She plops down at the dressing table and yanks the same drawer I\u2019d opened minutes earlier, pulling out a tube of lipstick. \u201cWorld\u2019s . . . slumber . . . misbehave!\u201d Eyeing her reflection in the mirror, Mrs. Baker swipes the tube across her bottom lip, her unsteady hand smearing it outside the lip line. She wipes it with her thumb, making it worse. A crimson streak now runs halfway to her cheek. Mrs. Baker chuckles softly to herself, leans forward, stares at her drunken reflection. Something in the mirror suddenly catches her attention. I can tell by the way her gaze darts from her reflection to just over her right shoulder. The armoire. Mrs. Baker turns away from the mirror and faces it. From my point of view, it appears as if she\u2019s looking right at me. I hold my breath, unable to do anything but watch. As Mrs. Baker sets the lipstick atop the dressing table. As she stands. As she takes an uneven step toward the armoire. Her second step is steadier. The third even more so. Like she\u2019s sobering up with each consecutive stride. By the time she\u2019s in front of the armoire, all traces of drunkenness are gone. It\u2019s now the usual stern, stone-cold-sober version of Mrs. Baker who reaches out. Touches the armoire doors. Prepares to throw them open. I shrink against the interior wall, knowing that in one second I\u2019ll be caught, fired, sent back to a house where my father thinks I killed my mother. But just before Mrs. Baker can pull the armoire doors open, the record player suddenly skips. The music is replaced by a loud, low groan. It sounds through the entire house, starting at the first floor and moving upward, gaining volume as it goes. I know what it is. Mrs. Baker does, too, for her face darkens with concern. The groan is followed by a crack, a clatter, and several sudden, sharp jerks. It sounds like something\u2019s smashing into the house. Inside the armoire, I\u2019m jostled like a body in a coffin that\u2019s just been dropped. One of the doors flies open, exposing me being knocked back and forth behind Mrs. Baker\u2019s long black dresses. But she\u2019s no longer there to see me. Instead, she\u2019s throwing open the bedroom door and peering into the hall, one withered hand gripping the wall for support as all of Hope\u2019s End bucks and heaves. As quickly as it started, everything stops. The noise. The movement. All is silent and still. Mrs. Baker disappears into the hallway, off to investigate what just happened and where. Others in the house are doing the same. I hear footfalls overhead and the sound of someone thundering down the service stairs. I stay huddled in a corner of the armoire, my heart beating a hundred times per minute. Above me, Mrs. Baker\u2019s dresses still sway on the rack. I wait until they\u2019ve settled before crawling out of the armoire and hurrying to Lenora\u2019s room. She\u2019s awake, of course, her expression alarmed and her good hand clenched around the call button. Through our adjoining door, I hear the buzz of the alarm and see the red light filling my room. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I say. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Lenora drops the call button and taps twice on the bedspread. Her gaze then flicks to the far corner of the room, where someone stands, unnoticed by me until just now. Archie. He has the curtains pulled back and is looking out the window toward the terrace. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s down there,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat is?\u201d Archie finally turns to face me. \u201cThe damage. We should go see what happened.\u201d I already know what happened. Hope\u2019s End just got a bit closer to tumbling into the ocean. \u201cWhat are you doing in Lenora\u2019s room?\u201d I say. Archie and I look at each other with wary suspicion. It reminds me of a movie I watched with my mother when she was sick. Two cat burglars who interrupted each other while trying to rob the same mansion are forced to choose if they should work together or alone. They ultimately decide to trust each other. Archie makes a similar decision. \u201cI was saying goodnight.\u201d \u201cSince when do you say goodnight to Lenora?\u201d \u201cEver since Miss Hope first took ill,\u201d Archie says. \u201cEvery night, I make sure to stop by and see how she\u2019s doing.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s walk,\u201d I say. What I really mean is that I want to talk where Lenora can\u2019t hear us. Archie nods and follows me into the hallway, where the tilt of the house is noticeably more pronounced. Just when I had gotten used to it, too. \u201cEvery night?\u201d I say. \u201cYou told me you and Lenora were no longer close.\u201d \u201cI said it wasn\u2019t like it used to be,\u201d Archie says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s evolved over the years. Just because I don\u2019t make a show of it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care about Miss Hope. We\u2019re both on the same side, Kit. We\u2019re both here to watch over her. We just go about it in different ways.\u201d \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I seen you visit her before?\u201d \u201cBecause it\u2019s kind of our little secret. Something kept just between me and Miss Hope. I\u2019m sure you understand.\u201d Archie pauses, as if he now wants me to share one of my secrets. I decline. Because that movie about the cat burglars who decided to trust each other? It ends with one betraying the other. I\u2019m not about to let the same thing happen to me. \u201cHow late do you visit?\u201d \u201cUsually a little after Miss Hope goes to bed and a little before I do the same.\u201d We descend the service stairs slowly, our shoes crunching over bits of plaster that have fallen from the walls. \u201cEver visit her in the middle of the night?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Archie says. \u201cAn early riser like me can\u2019t afford to stay up that late.\u201d He sounds honest enough that I almost believe him. Then again, Archie also sounded honest when he lied about knowing Lenora had a baby. Right now, I suspect there\u2019s a seventy-five percent chance he\u2019s telling the truth. Using that math, I conclude that Archie was the gray blur I saw at Lenora\u2019s window my first night here. I\u2019m less sure about him causing the middle-of-the-night noises in Lenora\u2019s room. Or the shadow I watched pass the adjoining door. Or the typewritten message Lenora blamed on Virginia. \u201cDo you know if anyone else sneaks into Lenora\u2019s room at night on a regular basis?\u201d \u201cI doubt it,\u201d Archie says with a vagueness that drops the truth-o-meter to fifty percent. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m certain it\u2019s something.\u201d I stop halfway down the steps. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me? When I told all of you Lenora said her sister\u2014her dead sister\u2014was in her room typing, you didn\u2019t seem surprised. Why is that?\u201d \u201cBecause it was outlandish,\u201d Archie says. \u201cOr maybe because something like that has happened before over the years.\u201d Archie attempts to descend another step, but I block his way, standing with my arms outstretched and both palms against the stairwell\u2019s cracked walls. \u201cWas Lenora telling the truth?\u201d I should feel ridiculous for even thinking it, let alone saying it aloud. But Archie\u2019s reaction\u2014a flinch, followed by a deliberate masking of his features\u2014tells me I\u2019m on to something. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about this place,\u201d he says as he gently removes one of my hands from the wall and sidesteps past me. \u201cThings you\u2019re better off not knowing.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s true?\u201d I say. \u201cVirginia\u2019s ghost is really haunting Hope\u2019s End?\u201d Archie makes a point of not looking at me as he continues down the steps. \u201cHaunting\u2019s not the right word. But, yes, her presence can be felt here. At Hope\u2019s End, the past is always present.\u201d I follow him to the bottom of the stairwell and into the kitchen, which appears mostly unharmed. Just a few fallen pots and pans and a broken jar on the floor. In the dining room, a large fissure has appeared above the fireplace mantel, zigging toward the ceiling. Both sets of French doors are open, letting in brisk night air and the hushed voices of everyone else already outside. Archie and I step onto the terrace, where Mrs. Baker, Carter, and Jessie all press against the side of the house. At first, I don\u2019t understand why. Then I see it. Littering the terrace are more tiles from the roof plus a pile of bricks that I assume is the remains of a toppled chimney. Running through it all, about five feet from the house, is a fault line that stretches from one side of the terrace to the other. One step over that line could send the cliff, the terrace, and, perhaps, all of Hope\u2019s End tumbling into the sea. \n THIRTY-THREE The full extent of the damage can\u2019t be assessed until morning, when all of us gather on the terrace not long after dawn. If anyone else paid a visit to Lenora\u2019s room during the night, I didn\u2019t hear it. I was too focused on the sound of the waves pounding the base of the cliff, eating away at it inch by inch. Lying in the darkness, listening to that steady churn, I wondered how long we had left until the whole thing fell. To judge from the state of the terrace, not very long at all. The damage appears even worse in daylight, with the rising sun shedding full light upon the fissure slicing across the terrace. About two inches wide and unfathomably deep, it runs down the steps on the left all the way into the empty swimming pool. Following its path is a line of broken marble tiles, many of which now jut from the terrace at jagged angles. Mrs. Baker peers at it all through her glasses, her eyes weary and sad. \u201cIs there someone we could call?\u201d she says. Carter, who\u2019d been on his stomach studying the crevasse, climbs to his feet and brushes dirt from his jeans. \u201cTo do what?\u201d \u201cFix it. Or support it. Or something.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no fixing this,\u201d Carter says. \u201cThis cliff is going to go eventually. And when it does, Hope\u2019s End is going to go with it.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t let that happen,\u201d Mrs. Baker says, as if she has any say in the matter. \u201cI\u2019ll go make some calls.\u201d She hurries back into the house, leaving the rest of us to stare anxiously at the cracked terrace. \u201cShe\u2019s delusional,\u201d Carter says. \u201cTotally,\u201d Jessie echoes. I turn to Archie, hoping our trust pact is still intact. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s a way to convince her to abandon this place?\u201d \u201cLeave Hope\u2019s End?\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019ll never do it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about Lenora. If something like this happens again\u2014\u201d \u201cWhen it happens again,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cCome on, guys, you know it will. And next time it\u2019ll probably be worse.\u201d I sigh, because I agree with her. \u201cWhen it happens, the rest of us can escape if we need to. But Lenora can\u2019t.\u201d Archie promises me he\u2019ll talk to Mrs. Baker about it before going back inside to start breakfast. Jessie quickly follows, saying nothing as she takes a long, disbelieving look at what\u2019s left of the terrace. Carter and I remain, our backs against the mansion and the brisk sea breeze in our faces. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see you again,\u201d Carter says with a shyness I haven\u2019t seen from him before. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re still here.\u201d The wind picks up, bringing with it a biting chill that warns winter is on its way. I pull my cardigan tight around me and wonder if Hope\u2019s End will still be here when winter does arrive. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I am. Honestly, how long do you think this place will remain standing?\u201d \u201cI have no clue. It could be years. Or months.\u201d \u201cOr hours?\u201d I say. \u201cYeah, that, too.\u201d \u201cI long for the days when I thought the scariest thing about this place was the three murders that happened here.\u201d \u201cFour murders,\u201d Carter says. \u201cRight.\u201d I lower my head, ashamed to have momentarily forgotten about Mary and what befell her on this same terrace. \u201cAnything new about that?\u201d Carter says. \u201cOr about anything?\u201d I fill him in on both my conversation with Mrs. Baker and my clandestine search of her room. \u201cNo suitcase. But I did find something interesting. Do you know anyone who might be staying at Ocean View?\u201d \u201cThat nursing home in town?\u201d \u201cYes. I found a bunch of cleared checks, going back years. Mrs. Baker\u2019s been giving them a thousand dollars a month.\u201d Carter lets out a low whistle. \u201cCharitable donation?\u201d \u201cI doubt Mrs. Baker would be giving away thousands of dollars a year when Hope\u2019s End looks like this.\u201d I survey the broken terrace and the rubble scattered across it. It resembles a war zone. I\u2019m all for philanthropy, but in the case of Hope\u2019s End, charity really does begin at home. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t be wasting that kind of money unless she had to. She\u2019s paying for someone to stay at Ocean View.\u201d Carter goes rigid beside me. Clutching my arm, he says, \u201cI think I know who it is. I remember Tony mentioning once or twice when I worked at the bar that a couple people who used to work here are still around. And one of them is at Ocean View.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cBerniece Mayhew.\u201d A look passes between us. One borne of surprise and confusion. For some reason\u2014and for many, many years\u2014Mrs. Baker has been paying the living costs of Ricardo Mayhew\u2019s wife. \u201cWhy would she do that?\u201d Carter says. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I have a feeling Lenora might.\u201d Carter scratches the back of his neck, thinking. \u201cGood luck getting her to tell you anything now that the typewriter\u2019s gone.\u201d I thought the same thing this morning after waking on a mattress slid halfway down the bed frame. I hauled it back into place, showered in an alarmingly uneven tub, and put on another of Mary\u2019s uniforms before checking in on Lenora. The moment I entered her room, I instinctively looked for the typewriter I\u2019d forgotten was no longer there. Staring at the empty desk, I realized communication between the two of us had just gotten a lot harder. Some answers require more than just tapping yes or no. \u201cMaybe she can write with her left hand,\u201d I say, wishful-thinking aloud. Even if Lenora was left-handed before her series of strokes, I don\u2019t think she has the strength to hold a pen and scrawl something on paper for any extended period of time. The only thing I can think to do is write out the alphabet and have her point to the letters. Which, truth be told, isn\u2019t a bad idea. In fact, I don\u2019t even need to go that far. Someone\u2019s already done it for me. \u201cI just thought of a way,\u201d I say, moving to the French doors. \u201cIt\u2019s not typing, but it\u2019ll do in a pinch.\u201d I leave Carter on the terrace and hurry through the dining room into the kitchen. I climb the service stairs quickly, passing the second-floor landing and going straight to the third, which feels like walking through a fun house. Staggering like a drunkard, I make my way to Jessie\u2019s room. Her door is open, so I peek inside and try to casually say, \u201cHi. I was wondering if I could borrow your Ouija board.\u201d Jessie, standing at the foot of her bed, gestures to the top of her dresser, where the Ouija board and planchette sit. \u201cYou can have it. It\u2019ll just be one less thing I need to pack.\u201d Every drawer in the dresser, I notice, is open, and a suitcase sits on the bed in front of Jessie. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d I say. \u201cYep.\u201d \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t care.\u201d For emphasis, Jessie balls up a sweater and stuffs it into the suitcase. \u201cJust as long as it\u2019s anywhere but here. You heard Carter. This whole place is falling apart. Literally. I\u2019m not going to be here when it does. You shouldn\u2019t, either. Honestly, we both should have left right after you found Mary.\u201d There\u2019s no arguing with that. Watching Jessie toss more clothes into the suitcase, I can\u2019t help but imagine what my life would be like right now if I\u2019d walked away that day and never looked back. But I stayed as Mary\u2019s death and the Hope family murders filled my waking hours. And I\u2019ll continue to stay, even though the smart thing would be to follow Jessie\u2019s lead. \u201cI can\u2019t abandon Lenora,\u201d I say, which is both the truth and an excuse. I\u2019m also staying because I can\u2019t shake the feeling that the full story is right at my fingertips, just out of reach. That same feeling is what draws me to the dresser, where I grab Jessie\u2019s Ouija board and planchette. \u201cI\u2019m only borrowing it,\u201d I tell her, pretending we\u2019ll see each other again when in all likelihood we won\u2019t. \u201cI plan on giving it back.\u201d Jessie gives me a surprise hug, which she finishes off with a girlish squeeze. \u201cTake care of yourself, Kit. And take care of Lenora, too. And please promise me you\u2019ll get her away from this place as soon as possible.\u201d \u201cI will.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cI\u2019m worried about her. And you.\u201d \u201cI promise,\u201d I say. \u201cI swear.\u201d I\u2019m about to leave the room when Jessie says, \u201cWait! I forgot something.\u201d She hurries to the dresser and hands me a cassette tape. \u201cThe end of the book I was reading for Lenora. I hope she likes it.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m sure she will.\u201d I pocket the cassette and let Jessie resume packing, knowing I should be doing the same thing. Instead, I\u2019m carrying a Ouija board down a hallway no one should be allowed to walk through, on my way to get a mute woman to speak not with the dead, but like them. Five minutes later, the meal tray is attached to Lenora\u2019s wheelchair. On top of it sits the Ouija board, with the planchette placed in the center beneath Lenora\u2019s left hand. \u201cYou ever use one of these things?\u201d I say. Lenora lifts the planchette to give a single tap against the board. \u201cIt\u2019s easy.\u201d I place my hand over hers and glide the planchette around the board. \u201cJust slide this to whatever letters you need to spell out your answer. Got it?\u201d Biting her bottom lip in concentration, Lenora pushes the planchette to the yes located in the upper-left corner of the board. \u201cPerfect,\u201d I say. \u201cYou ready to answer a question?\u201d The planchette stays where it is, which I assume is another yes. \u201cHow well did you know Berniece Mayhew?\u201d Lenora slides the planchette to the double row of letters arcing over the center of the board. Slowly, she brings it to the L. Then the I. Then the T. Then the T a second time. Then the L again. Then the E. \u201cA little?\u201d I say, making sure it\u2019s what she meant. Rather than return the planchette to the yes, Lenora taps it twice against the board. \u201cWhat was she like?\u201d Lenora slides the planchette again, spelling out a word with a meaning that needs no confirmation. nasty \u201cThen why is Mrs. Baker giving her money every month?\u201d I look to the Ouija board, where the planchette remains still beneath Lenora\u2019s hand. \u201cDid you know she was doing that?\u201d This time, Lenora spells out her answer. yes \u201cHow long has it been going on?\u201d Beneath the letters, a row of numbers is centered on the Ouija board, going from zero to nine. Lenora jerks the planchette to four of them, forming a telltale year. 1929 Because I was never good at math, it takes me a minute to add it all up in my head. The figure I come up with boggles my mind. Since 1929, Berniece Mayhew has been paid more than six hundred thousand dollars. \u201cWhy?\u201d I say, too stunned to phrase it any better than that. Lenora returns the planchette to the letters, falling into the same kind of rhythm as when she used the typewriter. In roughly the same time it would have taken her to type it, she\u2019s spelled out her answer. because she knows I still don\u2019t understand. \u201cKnows what?\u201d Lenora keeps the planchette sliding. about that night I nod. There\u2019s only one night she could be referring to. \u201cWhat about that night?\u201d Lenora keeps the planchette moving, skipping from one letter to another to another. she The planchette continues to slide. Down to one of the last letters on the second row, then up to the first one in the first row, then back down to the second. was I keep my gaze fixed on the Ouija board, too afraid of missing a letter that I don\u2019t even blink. here My heart thuds once against my rib cage. Berniece Mayhew was at Hope\u2019s End that night. Not just before and after the murders, but during them. \n By the start of October, I had reached the point where I could no longer hide my condition, even with the help of Archie and Miss Baker. My body had changed too much to merely blame on weight gain. Soon anyone who looked at me would know I was pregnant. Without another way to keep it a secret, Miss Baker suggested I take a cue from my mother and stay in bed. Reluctantly, that\u2019s what I did. Anyone who came into my room and saw me propped up on pillows and covered by ample blankets wouldn\u2019t know I was pregnant. My excuse for taking to my bed--exhaustion brought about by extreme nervousness--was also inspired by my mother. Everyone believed it. Like mother, like daughter. Even clueless Dr. Walden had no trouble thinking it was the truth. Rather than examine me, he simply provided a bottle of laudanum and told me to sip it regularly to ease my delicate condition. I poured the foul liquid down the sink as soon as I was alone. I might have been acting like my mother, but I certainly had no plan to become her. For a restless girl like me who lost every time my father forced us to play the game in which he locked us in our rooms, I shockingly had no trouble spending most of my time in bed. Very quickly, I learned how to lay very still, sometimes for hours, while my mind roamed the world, going wherever I wanted, whenever I wanted. Often, I\u2019d put my hands on my stomach and whisper to the child growing inside it about all the things I had planned for us and all the places we would go. Paris, of course, but other, more adventurous locales. Jungles and mountains and tropical islands with water that shimmered like sapphires. I thought of it as nothing more than daydreaming, but Archie, whose curious nature compelled him to read about such things, said I was practicing meditation. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked him on one of the rare times he could sneak into my room. \u201cDisassociating the mind from the body,\u201d he replied, which didn\u2019t clear up much. Still, I had ample time to let my mind wander. Few people came to see me. My mother was bedridden herself, and my father, overwhelmed by business woes I knew very little about, had taken to spending more time in Boston. Even Archie\u2019s visits grew scarce as the weeks passed. The only two people I saw on a regular basis were Miss Baker, who brought me meals and made sure I ate every bite, and my sister, who seemed to revel in discussing her social life, including all the things she was doing, people she was seeing, and places she was going. \u201cPeter and I are going on a picnic,\u201d she said the day before everything changed, even though none of us knew it yet. \u201cI do wish you could join us.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean it, of course. It was simply her way of making sure I knew she had the carefree existence I could only long for. Little did she know that I was doing fine. I had someone who loved me, his child growing inside me, and a happy family in my future. Or so I told myself. But doubt had crept in, and no amount of daydreaming--or meditation--could keep it at bay. The truth was that Ricky hadn\u2019t once checked in on me in the three weeks since I had been forced to fake being an invalid. He knew it was a ruse to hide the pregnancy, for I made sure to tell him. Day after day, week after week, I asked Miss Baker, who by then knew Ricky\u2019s identity, if he had come around trying to see me. And day after day, week after week, I was told no. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s very difficult for him to sneak away,\u201d Miss Baker said each time I asked. Of that, I had no doubt. What bothered me was that he didn\u2019t even seem to be attempting to check on me. My patience eventually wore thin, as did my certainty that Ricky truly loved me and wanted this child as much as I did. Fueled in part by my sister\u2019s flaunting of her robust social life, I chose that night to sneak out and see him. The doubt had become too much to bear. When Miss Baker arrived with dinner that evening, I pleaded with her to locate Ricky and tell him I would meet him on the terrace at midnight. It was the only time I could leave my room without being seen. Reluctantly, she agreed. At the stroke of midnight, after I was certain everyone else had gone to bed, I crept downstairs into the kitchen, on my way to the terrace. I was halfway across the kitchen when I realized I wasn\u2019t alone. Berniece was also there. Although she pretended to busy herself with late-night work, it was clear she had been waiting for me. \u201cI knew it,\u201d she said when she saw my rounded stomach. \u201cWell, you\u2019re one apple that didn\u2019t fall far from the tree.\u201d \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d I replied, trying to muster anger when all I felt was pure fear. Berniece sneered. \u201cThat you\u2019re a whore. Just like every other member of your family.\u201d I was so stunned I couldn\u2019t speak. I knew what the servants said about us behind our backs, of course. I just thought they valued their jobs too much to say it to my face. Not Berniece, apparently. \u201cYou honestly think I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on?\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband sneaking out at odd hours, hardly paying any attention to me, looking like he\u2019d rather die than touch me. I\u2019ve known for months. It\u2019s not the first time it\u2019s happened.\u201d She glared at me, as if everything about me repulsed her. \u201cWhat do you intend to do about it?\u201d I said, which I\u2019m sure sounded like a challenge to Berniece even though it wasn\u2019t. I was intensely curious--not to mention frightened--of her next move. \u201cI intend to get rich,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll stay silent and look the other way if you and your family pay up.\u201d I stayed completely still, stunned. \u201cHow much?\u201d \u201cFifty thousand dollars should be enough,\u201d she said before tacking on a threat I was certain she\u2019d carry out. \u201cFor now. You have until tomorrow night to think it over.\u201d Immediately, I began to panic. Tomorrow. That wasn\u2019t much time. Not nearly enough to plan our escape. But escape was the only option. Of that, I had no doubt. I burst from the kitchen, running outside to the terrace, where Ricky waited in the shadows. I hushed him before he could say a word, worried that Berniece had followed me out. \u201cNot here,\u201d I whispered before whisking him away to the first floor of the garage, where the gleaming Packards my father owned but never drove were kept. We climbed into the back seat of one of them, hiding from the rest of the world. \u201cWill you tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d Ricky said. \u201cShe knows,\u201d I blurted out. \u201cBerniece knows. And she wants money or she\u2019s going to tell my father. But telling my father is the only way to get the money.\u201d \u201cHow much does she want?\u201d Ricky said, his voice more curious than angry. \u201cFifty thousand dollars.\u201d I wanted to sob. The situation was so dire that I had no idea what to do. No matter what we chose, the decision would irrevocably change my life. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Ricky had the only answer. \u201cRun away,\u201d he said. \u201cTomorrow night.\u201d \n THIRTY-FOUR I\u2019ll give whoever named Ocean View Retirement Home credit where it\u2019s due. The place does have what its name promises. From a distance. And only if you look between the buildings on the other side of the street, the backs of which really do have an ocean view. Inside is a large, tasteful lobby that makes the place look more like a hotel than a nursing home. There are potted palms, plush chairs, and paintings of seashells in pastel shades on the walls. A registration desk stretches along one end of the lobby, behind which sits a woman who appears old enough to be a resident. Gray hair. Mint green pantsuit. Lit cigarette jammed between her lips. She squints through the smoke, watching my approach. \u201cWelcome to Ocean View,\u201d she says. \u201cHow may I be of assistance?\u201d I look to the doors on either side of the desk. One is closed and marked as being for employees only. The other is propped open, revealing a glimpse of a man pushing a walker down a hallway lined with burgundy carpet. The way into Ocean View. \u201cI\u2019m here to see Bernice Mayhew,\u201d I say. The receptionist looks me up and down, assessing my uniform. \u201cYou\u2019re not one of our nurses.\u201d \u201cNo. I\u2019m with the insurance company.\u201d I lift the medical bag I brought with me as part of the ruse. \u201cThey ordered me to check her vitals.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me. You know how insurance companies can be.\u201d The receptionist nods, silently acknowledging that yes, insurance companies are terrible and yes, the two of us are just cogs in a vast healthcare industrial complex that puts profits over people every damn time. Still, she hesitates. \u201cWe have our own medical staff that evaluates the patients.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just doing what I was told,\u201d I say. \u201cI understand that. But them sending you here at this hour is very unusual.\u201d \u201cI totally agree,\u201d I say. \u201cYou can call the main office, if you want. But you\u2019ll be on hold for an hour and what I need to do only takes five minutes. Check blood pressure, heart rate, temperature. Then I\u2019m gone.\u201d I take a breath, proud of myself\u2014not to mention a little alarmed\u2014for being able to lie so effortlessly. The receptionist exhales a line of smoke and eyes the phone by her elbow, no doubt debating how much time she wants to waste on this. Not a lot, apparently, because she says, \u201cFive minutes? That\u2019s it?\u201d It\u2019s all I can spare. I couldn\u2019t get away until Archie brought dinner up to Lenora\u2019s room. I asked him to stay with her while I ran into town to run an important errand. I told him I\u2019d be gone for thirty minutes. Since the drive here took fifteen minutes and the drive back will take the same, I figure I can spend only five minutes with Berniece Mayhew before he starts to get suspicious. I smile at the receptionist. \u201cDepending on Mrs. Mayhew, it might only take four.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s in the Dunes wing,\u201d the receptionist says as she takes a drag on her cigarette. \u201cRoom 113.\u201d I follow the burgundy carpet deeper into Ocean View. A directory just inside the door helps me get my bearings. Waves wing on the left, Dunes wing on the right, common area straight ahead. I go right, moving down a hallway that smells like bleach, lemon air freshener, and just a hint of urine. At Room 111, I slow my pace. At Room 112, I adjust my nurse\u2019s cap and smooth the skirt of my uniform. I then plaster a smile on my face and step into Room 113. The room is small but tidy. Decent enough to visit, but not a place you want to spend much time in. Berniece Mayhew, though, has spent years here. And it shows. Propped up by pillows and wearing a terrycloth robe, she has the look of someone who doesn\u2019t get out much. Her hair is a shock of white, which stands in contrast to a face darkened by age spots. She\u2019s got a flat nose, chubby cheeks, and a chin that\u2019s nonexistent. In its place is a flap of loose skin that droops like a wet rag on a hook. It sways when she turns to glare at me. \u201cWho are you?\u201d \u201cMy name\u2019s Kit.\u201d The time for lying ended in the hallway. Now I have no choice but to tell her the truth. \u201cI work for Lenora Hope.\u201d \u201cAre you her nurse?\u201d \u201cSomething like that, yes.\u201d Berniece turns back to the small TV sitting opposite the bed. Wheel of Fortune is on. My mother loved that show. \u201cHow\u2019s Lenora doing?\u201d she says. \u201cFine, all things considered.\u201d She huffs with disappointment. \u201cThat\u2019s a damn shame.\u201d \u201cWould it make you happy to know her whole body\u2019s paralyzed except for her left hand?\u201d Berniece Mayhew looks my way again, delight dancing in her eyes. \u201cIs she suffering?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019d be happier if she was.\u201d A wooden chair sits just inside the door. I drop onto it and place my medical bag on the floor. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting thing to say about the woman whose generosity keeps you here.\u201d \u201cIs that what you think it is?\u201d Berniece says bitterly. \u201cGenerosity?\u201d \u201cThe only other thing I can think of is hush money. My best guess is it\u2019s so you wouldn\u2019t tell anyone Lenora Hope was having an affair with your husband. Or is it because you saw something you weren\u2019t supposed to see the night most of the Hope family was murdered?\u201d Berniece Mayhew gives me a squinty-eyed look, as if seeing me for the very first time. \u201cYou\u2019re a shrewd one, I\u2019ll give you that. Bold, too. Just waltzing in here and saying something like that.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Berniece snaps. \u201cWhich one do you want to tell me about first?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve stayed silent since 1929. What makes you think I\u2019m going to start blabbing now?\u201d \u201cBecause someone else is dead.\u201d Berniece\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cLenora\u2019s previous nurse,\u201d I say. \u201cA worker. Just like me. Just like you. I think she was murdered. And I think it has something to do with what happened that night in 1929.\u201d I pause, waiting to see what kind of response I get. My hope is that the mention of Mary will play to her sympathies. If she has any. I\u2019m about to see if Berniece Mayhew is as nasty as Lenora says she is. The old woman turns back to the television, where Vanna White, pert and perky in a sparkly dress, turns letters. But Berniece doesn\u2019t seem to be looking at the TV at all. Her gaze is fixed somewhere else, somewhere distant. A moment in the past only she can see. \u201cRicardo wasn\u2019t perfect.\u201d Berniece sighs, and contained in that single sound is a lifetime of disappointment. \u201cI knew that when I married him. He had, shall we say, a wandering eye. But he wasn\u2019t mean, even when he drank, which is more than I can say about my father. So I wasn\u2019t surprised when that rich bitch got her hooks into him. She could have had the pick of all those young men working the place. Some were full-time. Some were townies. Some of them fine-looking, too. But none as handsome as my Ricardo. I guess that\u2019s why she set her sights on him. All she needed to do was bat those big, blue eyes at him and he was a goner.\u201d \u201cDid you confront him about it?\u201d \u201cOf course. Do I look like some shrinking violet to you?\u201d I have to concede that no, she does not. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d \u201cHe denied it, of course. He was a smooth talker, my Ricardo. Could talk his way out of anything. He tried to convince me nothing was going on between them, and I pretended to believe him. But I had a plan, you see.\u201d The chair creaks as I lean forward, elbows on my knees. \u201cThe hush money.\u201d \u201cIt only seemed fair,\u201d Berniece says. \u201cMy husband was carrying on with one of the High and Mighty Hopes. I deserved something for my pain and suffering. So I gave them an ultimatum\u2014pay up or I\u2019d tell everyone exactly what kind of people they were.\u201d \u201cAnd they had to decide\u2014\u201d \u201cThe night all hell broke loose.\u201d Berniece tells me how all the Hope\u2019s End staff was given the night off. That was apparently common every other Tuesday in the off-season. There wasn\u2019t a whole lot to do there once October rolled around. Berniece told her husband she was going into town to see a movie. \u201cI asked if he wanted to come along, knowing he wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I grabbed my coat, hat, and purse and left the cottage.\u201d \u201cBut you didn\u2019t leave Hope\u2019s End,\u201d I say. Berniece touches the tip of her nose, signaling I\u2019m right. \u201cI waited around outside, hoping to see Ricardo sneaking off to meet her. Sure enough, he left the cottage about fifteen minutes later, sauntering across the terrace and past the swimming pool to the garage. At first, I was surprised. Imagine a place that big, with all those rooms, and choosing to fuck in the garage.\u201d I jolt in shock. No, Berniece Mayhew is definitely not a shrinking violet. She smiles, pleased to have scandalized me. \u201cBut then I realized what he was doing,\u201d she continues. \u201cRicardo wasn\u2019t a stupid man, despite doing many stupid things. He knew I was on to him. And I realized he knew I hadn\u2019t gone to the movies. Heading to the garage was just a way of throwing me off his trail.\u201d I get her gist. Instead of entering through the back, he went to the garage before going around to the front of the house and using the main door. \u201cI marched right into that house, ready to catch the two of them in the act and then tell Winston Hope exactly what his daughter was doing with my husband. I was certain he\u2019d pay up. After firing Ricardo, of course. And probably me, as well. Which was even more reason to try to get as much money as I could.\u201d \u201cBut it didn\u2019t work out that way.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Berniece says quietly. \u201cIt didn\u2019t.\u201d I glance at my watch. My five minutes are up. But I can\u2019t leave. Not until I hear the full story. Trying to move her along, I say, \u201cWhat happened when you went inside?\u201d \u201cI got as far as the kitchen before that bitch ran in.\u201d I can only assume the bitch in question is Lenora. \u201cShe looked scared,\u201d Berniece says. \u201cAt first I thought it was because of me. That she knew they\u2019d been found out. But then I noticed her hands.\u201d My chair starts to vibrate. I look down and notice I\u2019m tapping my right foot, set into motion by both impatience and suspense. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d \u201cThey were bloody.\u201d My foot stills instantly, as does the rest of my body as I picture young Lenora standing in the kitchen, blood dripping from her hands. A horrible image for many reasons. \u201cDid she say anything?\u201d \u201cNot at first,\u201d Berniece says. \u201cShe just stared at me, shocked to see me there. And then we both heard a scream. It came from upstairs, echoing down the service stairs.\u201d \u201cDo you know who it was?\u201d I say. \u201cEither Mrs. Hope or the younger daughter,\u201d Berniece says. \u201cIt was definitely a woman. As she kept on screaming, Lenora grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter. Then she glared at me and said, \u2018Get out right now.\u2019 \u201d \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d \u201cNothing. I just nodded and left. I was too scared to do anything else. But I knew something awful was happening inside that house. It wasn\u2019t until the police came that I realized just how awful it really was.\u201d Berniece looks down at her lap, ashamed. \u201cI think about that moment a lot. If I\u2019d refused to go, maybe Lenora would have killed me on the spot. Or maybe the other killings wouldn\u2019t have happened. Maybe some of them could have been saved. Especially the younger daughter. Virginia. The poor thing. In such a state, too.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell the police any of this?\u201d \u201cBecause I wanted to protect Ricardo,\u201d Berniece says, a catch in her throat. \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t just Lenora responsible for those murders. Ricardo was part of it, too. He had to be. Because he never came back to the cottage. Not that night. Not ever. Once he disappeared, I knew deep down what had happened. That he had helped her kill that family.\u201d \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d I say. \u201cYou said yourself he wasn\u2019t mean.\u201d \u201cBut he was easily swayed. My assumption is she tricked him. I\u2019d seen how manipulative she could be.\u201d There\u2019s that word again. The same one Mrs. Baker had used to describe Lenora. Manipulative. \u201cI bet she gave him some sob story about her cruel parents and her awful life and how she was a prisoner in that big old mansion. And I bet Ricardo believed it. After a few months of hearing bullshit like that, he was probably brainwashed into thinking the only way they could be together is if the rest of her family was dead. So he helped her kill them.\u201d \u201cThen he ran away,\u201d I say. \u201cNo, sweetie,\u201d Berniece says, her voice so vicious it\u2019s practically a snarl. \u201cLenora killed him, too.\u201d I remain completely still in the chair, incapable of movement. I try to imagine Lenora doing any of this. Killing not just her father, mother, and sister, but her lover as well. Only a monster would do that. And the Lenora Hope I know isn\u2019t a monster. Not that I thought she was completely innocent. She told me so herself. I wasn\u2019t a good girl. Not in the least. You\u2019ll see for yourself very soon. I also knew she had gotten rid of the knife used to kill her parents. Lenora made no attempt to hide that from me. Even so, I\u2019d started to think she was innocent of the actual killings. In my mind, the only thing she was guilty of was covering for the man who really committed them, out of a misguided sense of love and loyalty. But what Berniece is telling me shatters all my assumptions. If what she\u2019s saying is true, then Lenora is just as guilty as Ricardo Mayhew. Probably more so, since she\u2019s still alive and he\u2019s . . . gone. Unless Berniece is lying. Not an impossibility, seeing how she just admitted to taking money for decades from the woman she says killed her husband. \u201cIf Lenora murdered Ricardo,\u201d I say, \u201cwhy wasn\u2019t his body found with the others?\u201d Berniece has a simple answer for that. \u201cShe shoved him off that terrace. You\u2019ve seen it. That\u2019s a long drop to the ocean.\u201d Yet that still doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why would Lenora make her accomplice disappear? Especially when it meant all suspicion was directed at her? Either Berniece is making all of this up\u2014or she misunderstood what she saw. And judging by her silence all these years, she doesn\u2019t care about that as long as she\u2019s getting paid. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is about protecting your husband,\u201d I say. \u201cAfter the murders, you realized you had a new way to get your hush money.\u201d \u201cAnd good thing I did, too,\u201d Berniece says. \u201cBecause sure enough, we were all fired within the week. Those of us who were left, anyway. Half the staff quit as soon as they found out what happened. Lenora was too busy being questioned by the police to do it herself. She sent the kitchen boy to do it.\u201d \u201cArchie?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s his name,\u201d Berniece says with a nod. \u201cI never could remember it. Poor kid, though. Barely eighteen and being told to fire everyone he worked with. When he got to the cottage, he could barely look me in the eye. He just handed me a check for a thousand dollars, written out by Lenora Hope herself.\u201d I check my watch again. Five minutes has turned to ten. And the man waiting for my return is the same person who first paid off Berniece. \u201cDid he tell you it was hush money?\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t need to, hon,\u201d Berniece says. \u201cPaying off people was the Hope family way. They did it to get what they wanted, whether it was that concoction Mrs. Hope was always drinking or the pretty young maids Mr. Hope was always screwing. And it was how they kept people quiet, like whenever one of those pretty maids found themselves in trouble.\u201d \u201cSo you just took the check and left.\u201d A cold glint appears in Berniece\u2019s eyes. \u201cNot quite. I told him to inform Miss Hope that there needed to be a similar check every month or I\u2019d tell the police I saw her with a knife the same night her parents were stabbed to death. Sure enough, one came for the same amount the next month. And the one after that. The money faucet\u2019s been running ever since.\u201d I stand, feeling dirty in her presence. Yet I\u2019m also reluctant to get back to Hope\u2019s End, because I know at least some of what she\u2019s said is true. About Mrs. Hope\u2019s addiction and Mr. Hope\u2019s sexual proclivities and how the family threw money at whatever problem they encountered. I know because I helped Lenora type it. Which means everyone in that house other than Carter is corrupt. Including Lenora. \u201cIt\u2019s about to be turned off,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause either you go to the police or I will.\u201d Berniece glances over my shoulder to the doorway behind me, her features brightening. \u201cLooks like they\u2019re already here.\u201d A hand clamps down on my shoulder as the familiar voice of Detective Vick says, \u201cCome with me, Kit. You know you shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re just talking,\u201d I protest. \u201cYou\u2019re trespassing.\u201d Detective Vick grips my arm and tugs. \u201cAnd lying about it in the process.\u201d I unwillingly turn to the doorway. Behind the detective stands the woman I talked to at the reception desk. She glares at me and says, \u201cGuess who called the insurance company after all? They have no idea who you are.\u201d \u201cBut I do,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cI\u2019ll take it from here. Unless you want to press charges.\u201d The woman considers it, taking an uncomfortably long time to make up her mind. She looks to Berniece and says, \u201cDid she hurt you in any way, Mrs. Mayhew?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fine. She just asked me a few questions.\u201d \u201cAnd now you need to tell them what you just told me,\u201d I say. Detective Vick won\u2019t hear of it. \u201cYou\u2019ve bothered her enough, Kit. Let\u2019s go.\u201d He gives me just enough time to grab my medical bag before pulling me out of the room. As we leave, Berniece flashes me a gap-toothed grin. \u201cTell Lenora I said hello,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that I\u2019ll see her in hell.\u201d \n THIRTY-FIVE Detective Vick keeps a firm grip around my wrist as he walks me to my car. I should be flattered he thinks I\u2019m that much of a threat. \u201cYou can let go now,\u201d I say, twisting my arm. \u201cI\u2019m not going to run back inside and bother Berniece some more. Although I highly recommend you do. You\u2019ll want to hear what she has to say.\u201d \u201cThe police talked to Berniece Mayhew fifty-four years ago.\u201d \u201cSo you looked at the case file from back then?\u201d \u201cI did. Berniece didn\u2019t have anything to say other than that her husband hadn\u2019t come home.\u201d \u201cShe was lying,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd you\u2019d know that if you went back there and did your goddamn job.\u201d Detective Vick finally releases my wrist when we reach my car. From the pissed-off look on his face, I expect him to up the stakes and put me in handcuffs. Instead, he says, \u201cGo back and do your goddamn job. Leave the investigating to me. Better yet, quit that place and go home. Your dad misses you.\u201d I blink, surprised. \u201cHe said that?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cBut I assume it\u2019s lonely for him now.\u201d \u201cTrust me,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d \u201cSo you decided to bother an innocent old lady instead?\u201d I stifle a harsh laugh. Innocent is the last word I\u2019d use to describe a woman who\u2019s collected money for decades to stay silent about what she thinks was a quadruple homicide. Then again, that\u2019s nothing compared with the crimes Berniece says her husband and Lenora committed. \u201cI was here asking about Ricardo Mayhew,\u201d I say. \u201cHis wife thinks he did it, by the way. With Lenora\u2019s help. And then she killed him.\u201d \u201cAnd what do you think?\u201d I lean against my car, mulling over the question. \u201cI think something happened that night beyond the murders of three people and the disappearance of another. Something that either instigated the violence or was the result of it.\u201d That Lenora was part of it is a given. What I struggle with is deciding how big of a role she played. Is it all her fault, as both Berniece and the mystery typist who came into Lenora\u2019s room claim? Or was she swept up in events beyond her control? Did she toss the murder weapon to try to mitigate the damage but ended up being blamed for everything? I hope it\u2019s the latter. I fear it\u2019s the former. \u201cWhat else did the police reports say?\u201d \u201cThey got a call a little after eleven p.m. on Tuesday, October 29,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cThe caller told them two people were dead at Hope\u2019s End.\u201d I cock my head. \u201cTwo?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what the report says.\u201d But three people were murdered that night. The only way that can possibly be right is if the person who called the police did so after finding only two of the bodies. \u201cWho was the caller?\u201d \u201cLenora Hope.\u201d It makes sense she\u2019d be the one to call the police. It\u2019s naturally the first thing Lenora would do if she was innocent\u2014or trying to make herself look innocent. But in both cases, she\u2019d surely know the number of victims. Either Lenora lied to the police\u2014or someone else was still alive while she was on the phone. I reach into my memory, summoning the first few pages Lenora had typed. They\u2019re easy to recall because she stressed how it was the moment she remembered most. The thing she still had nightmares about. Her on the terrace. Bloody knife washed clean by the rain before she tossed it into the ocean below. Her sister screaming inside the house. Virginia. That\u2019s who was still alive. And then Lenora went to the garage to fetch some rope. I\u2019m hit with a headache as I consider what that means. And it doesn\u2019t look too good for Lenora. In fact, it looks like Virginia was collateral damage, stumbling into the wrong place at the wrong time. And someone decided she had to die, too. That someone was most likely Lenora, who no longer had the knife that killed her parents and needed a new weapon. As for who did the hanging, maybe that was Ricardo, who either fled afterward or, if Berniece is right, was then shoved off the terrace by Lenora. The same terrace Mary was pushed from. \u201cPolice responding to the scene found the front gate open,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cWhen they entered the house, they discovered Evangeline Hope on the staircase landing. The officers then fanned out through the rest of the house, finding Winston Hope in the billiard room and Virginia Hope hanging from a chandelier in the ballroom.\u201d \u201cWhere was Lenora?\u201d \u201cOn the terrace.\u201d So she went back out there after Virginia was killed. My headache gets worse. Because the more I hear, the more I think that Berniece is right. And that Lenora is guilty. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Hope were declared dead at the scene. Virginia was taken upstairs.\u201d \u201cAlso dead,\u201d I say. Detective Vick shakes his head. \u201cNot for another six months.\u201d A shock. I\u2019d assumed Virginia died the same night her parents did. Instead, she clung to life for six more months. I\u2019m not sure which is worse\u2014going instantly like her mother and father or lingering at death\u2019s door that long before finally slipping through. \u201cWhy did no one suspect Ricardo Mayhew?\u201d \u201cThey did,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cOnce everyone realized he was gone and not coming back, he was the prime suspect. Especially when it was discovered that one of Winston Hope\u2019s Packards was missing from the garage. It was possible he killed them, stole the car, and drove as far away as he could. But there was nothing to prove that\u2019s what happened\u2014or that he was even in the house at all.\u201d \u201cDid someone at least ask Lenora about Ricardo?\u201d A car pulls into the parking lot, its headlights skimming the Ocean View\u2019s fa\u00e7ade before landing on the weathered face of Detective Vick. Usually, he looks flinty. Tonight, he just looks tired. \u201cAs a matter of fact they did,\u201d he says. \u201cShe claimed she didn\u2019t know who he was. One of the cops had to clarify that he was the head groundskeeper at Hope\u2019s End. The cop made a note that she genuinely seemed to not know the man\u2019s name.\u201d \u201cHow many times did they talk to her?\u201d \u201cMultiple times over several weeks,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cHer story was always the same. She didn\u2019t see anything, didn\u2019t hear anything, never saw a soul inside that house other than her family.\u201d That\u2019s at least one lie on Lenora\u2019s part. She saw Berniece, who caught her in the kitchen with blood on her hands as she grabbed a knife. Yet that doesn\u2019t make sense. If Lenora was indeed guilty, how could there be blood on her hands before she fetched the knife? That\u2019s only possible if more than one knife had been used. \u201cWhat about the weapon?\u201d I say. \u201cThey never found it, right?\u201d \u201cCorrect.\u201d \u201cWere the police certain only one knife was used?\u201d \u201cAs certain as they could be,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cNo other knife seemed to be missing from the kitchen, and the stab wounds on both Winston and Evangeline Hope were roughly the same width, suggesting only one weapon was used.\u201d \u201cDid they notice anything out of the ordinary about the place? Anything at all?\u201d \u201cJust that Virginia Hope\u2019s room had recently been cleaned. One of the cops smelled floor polish when they brought her upstairs.\u201d I touch my temples, the headache growing. It\u2019s so bad I\u2019m surprised my skull hasn\u2019t fractured yet, forming a crack as big as the one now running across the terrace at Hope\u2019s End. \u201cSince they couldn\u2019t prove\u2014or disprove\u2014that Ricardo did it, and since they couldn\u2019t do the same with Lenora, the case just stalled?\u201d \u201cCorrect,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cSound familiar?\u201d Anger flashes through me like lightning. Electric. Searing. \u201cFuck you,\u201d I tell Detective Vick, which might be illegal. I\u2019m not up to date on laws against swearing at police detectives. If it is a crime, Detective Vick makes no move to do anything about it as I yank open the door to my Escort and slide behind the wheel. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you, you know,\u201d he says before I can slam the door shut. \u201cYour mother was suffering. I understand that. My own parents suffered when their time came. But I didn\u2019t break the law to try to end it.\u201d \u201cNeither did I.\u201d I\u2019m on the verge of tears, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s from rage or grief or the fact that everything about the past six months has been too damn much. When I got to Hope\u2019s End, I threw myself into learning Lenora\u2019s story because I was desperate to change my own pathetic existence by focusing on someone else\u2019s. But then I found Mary dead, and things have only spiraled since then. \u201cI didn\u2019t make my mother take those pills,\u201d I say, swiping at a tear before it can fall because I\u2019ll be damned if I cry in front of Detective Vick. \u201cShe killed herself. Mary didn\u2019t. And someone smarter than you would understand that.\u201d The detective\u2019s nostrils flare. The only sign I\u2019ve gotten to him. Unlike me, he knows how to keep his emotions in check. \u201cKit, for the last time, Mary Milton wasn\u2019t murdered.\u201d \u201cHow can you be so sure of that?\u201d Detective Vick removes a piece of paper from inside his jacket. A photocopy of a page made ragged and faint from water damage. Thrusting it at me, he says, \u201cBecause of this.\u201d My hands go numb as I read the single sentence typed across the page. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d \u201cA copy of Mary Milton\u2019s suicide note,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cI told you we found it with her body.\u201d I scan the page a second, third, fourth time, hoping each pass will produce a different meaning. But it all reads the same every damn time. im sorry im not the person you thought i was \u201cMary\u2014\u201d I stop, unnerved by the way my voice sounds. Like I\u2019m underwater. Like I\u2019m a thousand miles away. \u201cMary didn\u2019t write this.\u201d \u201cOf course she did,\u201d Detective Vick says. \u201cWho else could it be?\u201d Rather than answer, I struggle to jam the key into the ignition and struggle even more to pull out of the parking spot. Then I drive off, leaving Detective Vick standing in exhaust fumes, still ignorant to the fact that what he found with Mary\u2019s body wasn\u2019t a suicide note. It\u2019s something else. Typed by someone else. And I think I know exactly what it means. \n THIRTY-SIX Because I didn\u2019t want to use the intercom to be let in upon my return, I never closed the front gate to Hope\u2019s End behind me when I left. It\u2019s still open, thank God, letting me steer the car right past it. I stop long enough to smack the button embedded in the interior wall to finally close the gate behind me. Then it\u2019s back to the car, where I speed to the front door, cut the engine, and hurry inside. The house is unnervingly quiet as I sweep down the hallway, coming to a stop at the family portraits on the wall. Pausing a moment at the painting of Lenora, I take in her pert nose, ripe lips, green eyes. Despite the many years between them, the girl in the portrait is unmistakably the woman I\u2019ve been caring for. I head to the first portrait in the row and use my car key to jab the silk crepe covering it. Once I\u2019ve made a hole big enough to poke a finger through, I start clawing at the fabric. The silk crepe makes a tearing sound\u2014slick, almost wet. I wonder if the knife blade sliding across Winston Hope\u2019s throat made a similar noise. That\u2019s who\u2019s underneath the fabric. Winston Hope himself, looking like every other captain of industry from that period. Ruddy and smug and pudgy from too much food, too much wine, too much everything. Men like him gobbled up all they could, leaving nothing for everyone else. Staring at the greedy visage of Winston Hope, I can tell he had no idea what fate had in store for him. He probably thought he\u2019d live forever. Instead, he ended up dead in the room just across the hall, slumped over a pool table, his blood seeping into the green felt. I move on to the next portrait, repeating my steps. Jab, poke, claw, tear. The black fabric pulls away to reveal Evangeline Hope. She truly was beautiful. Lenora hadn\u2019t lied about that. Alabaster skin. Golden hair. Slim, elegant frame draped in an equally slim and elegant gown. But for all the ethereal beauty on display, there\u2019s something not right about Mrs. Hope\u2019s appearance. She\u2019s disconcertingly pale, making her seem delicate and fragile. I look at her and am reminded of a daylily on the cusp of wilting. Unlike her husband, Evangeline Hope looks very much like she knew what was coming. There\u2019s only one portrait left. Virginia. I jab and poke. I claw and tear. I keep ripping until I see a young woman who bears some of the features of her mother and absolutely none of her father. She\u2019s beautiful, too, in a slightly haughty way. In the painting, her smile comes off as forced, almost cruel. Then there are her eyes, which are colored an icy blue. Staring at them makes me recall what Berniece Mayhew said about Ricardo being a goner once Lenora batted her big eyes at him. Her big, blue eyes. Both my heart and mind race as I rush into the library, zeroing in on the fireplace mantel, where those three unsettling urns sit. Father, mother, daughter. With trembling hands, I reach out and lift the lid from the urn on the left. Inside is a pile of dull gray powder that brings to mind something the priest said during my mother\u2019s funeral. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Both are present and accounted for inside the urn, shifting like sand as I set it back on the mantel and replace the lid. I grab the second urn, lift the lid, take a peek at more ashes. Then it\u2019s on to the third urn, where my movements seem to slow like a bad memory. Seconds stretch to minutes as my fingers touch the lid, lift it, set it aside on the mantel. My senses work overtime when I grasp the urn. I feel the porcelain cold against my palm. I see the dust motes drifting through the stale air. I smell the yellowed pages of books that haven\u2019t been opened for decades. I taste something metallic on my tongue. Fear, I realize, of what will happen when I look inside the urn. Then I do look, and my gasp is loud enough to echo off the library bookshelves. Because what I see is . . . nothing. No ashes. No dust. The urn is completely empty. \n I should have known the night would end in disaster. I should have sensed it in the stormy air. All day, while pretending to be bedridden, I\u2019d heard the thunder rumbling over the ocean like the cannon fire of an approaching horde. A battle was coming. And there would be casualties. But I ignored the signs, too preoccupied with getting away to notice them. Our plan, such as it was, involved me gathering as much of my things as possible after everyone in the house had gone to bed. While I did that, Ricky would sneak into the garage and steal the keys to one of my father\u2019s Packards. At ten p.m., if all went well, he\u2019d be pulling up to the front door just as I slipped out with my suitcase. Then we\u2019d drive away and never look back. At the time, I thought it would work. All the servants had been given their biweekly night off, which is what made Ricky think the plan was possible. Because my mother remained in a round-the-clock laudanum haze, there\u2019d be no one else but my sister and father around to catch us. I never expected one of them would. At quarter to nine, I slid out of bed and quickly changed clothes. I had no idea what the rest of the night had in store, but I secretly hoped it involved a trip to a justice of the peace. I loved the idea of Ricky and me getting married before the baby was born. The last thing I wanted was for our child to be considered a bastard. If marriage was in store for me that night, I needed to wear the prettiest thing I owned--the pink satin dress I\u2019d worn for my birthday portrait. It barely fit, even though it\u2019d been let out multiple times since then, and did nothing to disguise my pregnant state. After squeezing into the dress, I tossed my suitcase onto the bed and flung it open. I then went to the armoire, grabbing as many dresses as my arms could hold. When I turned back to the suitcase, I found my sister in the doorway. She stood with her hands behind her back, holding something she didn\u2019t want me to see. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she said, looking delighted to have caught me up and about. \u201cLeaving.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Anywhere but here.\u201d My sister\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cYou\u2019re running away with him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I said as I dropped the dresses I\u2019d been holding into my suitcase. Without them to cover me, my sister could now see what I\u2019d been hiding for months. The gleam in her eyes was quickly replaced by shock. \u201cDear God,\u201d she said, her mouth agape. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d I returned to the armoire and grabbed another armful of dresses. \u201cNow do you understand why I\u2019m leaving?\u201d What I needed from my sister at that moment was for her to help me, comfort me, support me. That\u2019s what sisters are supposed to do for each other. Instead, mine simply said, \u201cFather will never allow it.\u201d The mention of my father stopped me dead. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell him,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease just let me leave. You hate me, after all. Won\u2019t that make your life easier, being the only child?\u201d \u201cNot when the family\u2019s name is ruined.\u201d My sister stood perfectly erect, her chin raised, smug in her superiority. She thought herself better than me in every way, and no longer made any attempt to hide it. \u201cIt\u2019s not just you who\u2019ll be affected. All of us will pay a price. Think of your reputation. Think of mine!\u201d \u201cYou expect me to stay here, loveless and miserable, for the rest of my life, just to preserve your precious reputation?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d my sister said. \u201cYours should be concern enough. If you leave, you\u2019ll be throwing your life away.\u201d \u201cOr gaining a new one,\u201d I was quick to reply. \u201cEither way, I can\u2019t let you do it.\u201d \u201cGo ahead then,\u201d I said. \u201cTell him. It won\u2019t keep me from leaving.\u201d \u201cThen I think it\u2019s time for one of our old games,\u201d my sister said. \u201cYou remember how to play it, don\u2019t you?\u201d My sister removed her hand from behind her back, revealing what she\u2019d been holding all this time. A key. To my bedroom door. Which could only be locked from the outside. \u201cNo! Please!\u201d I said, unable to get the words out before my sister left the room. I rushed to the door, feeling the brush of swift air on my face as she slammed it shut behind her. By the time I reached for the doorknob, it was too late. The key clicked in the lock just before I could grab it. I twisted the knob anyway. It didn\u2019t budge. The door was firmly locked. I caught sight of the door on the other side of the room, the one that led to Miss Baker\u2019s room. Unfortunately, my sister had also thought of it. I heard the key turning in that lock as I burst into the room. I was completely trapped. Still, I threw myself against the door and began pounding on it. On the other side, my sister\u2019s evil laughter echoed down the hall as she ran to tell my father what I was about to do. \u201cLet me out!\u201d I screamed after her. \u201cPlease let me out.\u201d I slammed into the door again and felt something inside me give way. Liquid. Gushing from between my legs onto the floor. Panic flooded my body, for I knew it meant the baby was coming. Early. And fast. Terrified, I pounded on the door, calling for my sister. \u201cPlease!\u201d I screamed. \u201cPlease, Lenora!\u201d \n THIRTY-SEVEN I find Mrs. Baker in the kitchen, corkscrew in hand, opening a bottle of Cabernet on the counter. She looks up, surprised to see me enter from the hallway and not the service stairs. \u201cIs everything all right with Miss Hope?\u201d \u201cYes, Lenora,\u201d I say. \u201cVirginia is fine.\u201d The corkscrew goes still. Just for a moment. Then she yanks, uncorking the bottle with a whisper-like pop. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Her denial, ironically, confirms my suspicion. The rigid way she stands, her forced smile and her steely blue eyes are an exact re-creation of the uncovered portrait in the hall. \u201cMaybe this will help,\u201d I say, removing Mary\u2019s alleged suicide note from my pocket and slapping it onto the table. The woman pretending to be Mrs. Baker scans it, cool as a cucumber, before filling a glass with wine. As she does, I swipe the corkscrew from the counter. Considering the conversation we\u2019re about to have, I don\u2019t want a sharp object within her reach. But I do want one in mine. The corkscrew goes into my pocket as Lenora Hope\u2014the real one\u2014takes a sip of wine and says, \u201cAm I supposed to know what this is?\u201d \u201cMary Milton had it in her pocket the night she died. Detective Vick thought it was a suicide note. But no one types that way. No one but your sister. Who typed it after she revealed to Mary who she really was, apologizing for pretending to be someone else for so long.\u201d Whether Virginia\u2014the real one, the living one\u2014planned on officially revealing it to me is unclear. I think she wanted to. After what happened to Mary, I suspect she feared doing it. But she never lied to me. Nothing she typed was untrue. When I asked who\u2019d been in her room at night, she provided an honest answer. Virginia. Her real name. When I asked who\u2019d used the typewriter during the night, she gave the same truthful response as when I asked her who Mary was afraid of. Her sister. The woman standing directly across the counter from me. \u201cBut you already know this,\u201d I tell her. \u201cYou knew it when you shoved Mary off the terrace.\u201d Lenora grips her wineglass so tightly I fear it might shatter. \u201cI did no such thing! She killed herself.\u201d I pat my pocket, feeling the corkscrew\u2019s curved ridge and the knifepoint sharpness of its tip. \u201cWe both know that\u2019s not true.\u201d \u201cWhatever happened to that poor girl has nothing to do with me.\u201d \u201cBut it does,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause she knew you\u2019ve been hiding the fact that your sister is alive and that you\u2019re really Lenora. How long has it been going on?\u201d \u201cA long time,\u201d she says, admitting at least one thing\u2014Mrs. Baker, she of the unknown first name, is indeed the infamous Lenora Hope. \u201cAlmost all the way back to the murders.\u201d Fifty-four years. A staggering amount of time. \u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d I say. \u201cAnd how?\u201d \u201cWhich part?\u201d Lenora says between giant swallows from her glass. Already, the wine is doing its job. She\u2019s looser now, and far more forthcoming. \u201cFaking my sister\u2019s death or forcing her to assume my identity?\u201d \u201cBoth,\u201d I say, my head now spinning from literally all of it. \u201cWhat really happened that night?\u201d \u201cI can only tell you what I experienced.\u201d Lenora climbs onto a stool and sits across from me, elbows on the counter. As if we\u2019re best friends out for a drink. As if any of this is normal. \u201cI was upstairs in my room, sitting at my dressing table and listening to my record player while pretending I wasn\u2019t hiding from everything going wrong in this house.\u201d It\u2019s easy to picture because I spied on her doing exactly that last night. \u201cIt had already been a long, terrible night,\u201d she says. \u201cThings happened. Awful things. And then it escalated. And then everything went quiet. Eventually, I decided to go downstairs and see if everything was okay.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t,\u201d I say. When Lenora shakes her head, I spot a glint of moisture in her telltale blue eyes. Tears that she refuses to let fall. \u201cI found my mother on the Grand Stairs. Dead, of course. I knew that right away. There was blood . . . everywhere.\u201d Lenora pauses, shuddering at the memory. \u201cI started screaming and running through the house like a chicken with its head cut off. My God, that\u2019s a terrible saying. Still, it fits my reaction that night. Running and screaming. Screaming and running. Right into the billiard room, where I saw my father.\u201d As she takes another sip of wine to fortify herself, I think about how it must have felt to walk into that room, to see her father slumped over the pool table, to notice the blood trickling into the table pockets. \u201cI ran to the kitchen, phoned the police, and told them my parents had been murdered.\u201d I nod, because it tracks with what Detective Vick told me about the police getting the call shortly after eleven. \u201cI then went looking for Virginia. I found her hanging in there.\u201d Lenora nods toward the kitchen doorway and the ballroom down the hall just beyond it. \u201cShe was hanging from one of the chandeliers. I should have tried to take her down. I realize that now. But I thought she was dead, just like my parents. Faced with such an irrational situation, I could only behave in an irrational manner\u2014I went out to the terrace and screamed. Out of fear and grief and confusion. I screamed until my throat seized up and I couldn\u2019t scream anymore. That\u2019s when the police arrived.\u201d Lenora traces the rim of the wineglass with her index finger as she tells me about the cops finding her family presumably dead and no one else in the house but her. \u201cThey looked at me like I was a maniac,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though I\u2019d done nothing wrong. The first words I told them were \u2018It wasn\u2019t me.\u2019 Which only made them suspect me more. The complete opposite of what I intended. They sat me down in the dining room and asked me all sorts of awful questions. Who else was here? Did I have a reason to want my family dead? And I just kept giving them the same answer: \u2018It wasn\u2019t me. It wasn\u2019t me.\u2019 \u201d I get d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu listening to her, thinking about me in a featureless interrogation room, Detective Vick\u2019s accusatory stare, the reels of the tape recorder going round and round. \u201cThen a miracle happened,\u201d Lenora says. \u201cOne of the cops yelled from the ballroom that Virginia was still alive. It turns out the noose around her neck wasn\u2019t much of a noose at all. That haphazard tangle of rope is likely what saved her life. It allowed just enough oxygen in to keep her alive. Barely. No one expected her to live through the night, which was why she was taken upstairs to her room instead of to the hospital.\u201d She tips back her glass and empties it before filling it again and taking another sip. Steeling herself for the rest of the story. Because despite being horrible already, I know much worse is about to come. \u201cDr. Walden, the family physician, was summoned,\u201d she says. \u201cHe said Virginia was brain dead and that the rest of her body would soon follow suit. Only it didn\u2019t. She hung on for days, weeks, months. It turned out Dr. Walden was wrong in every way. Virginia\u2019s mind was very much alive. She seemed to comprehend whatever was said to her. It was her body that had died. She was paralyzed, motionless, unable to talk, unable to do anything.\u201d \u201cSo what you told me about the strokes and the polio were\u2014\u201d \u201cAll lies,\u201d Lenora says. \u201cTo cover the fact that the hanging had damaged her larynx, leaving her unable to speak, and snapped her spinal cord, leaving her mostly paralyzed.\u201d \u201cWhy lie about that?\u201d I say. \u201cWhy go to all that effort to cover up everything?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what it was like for me. I was only seventeen, scared and alone. I had no other family and no one to guide me. My parents were dead. My sister was basically comatose. And suddenly I was in charge of Hope\u2019s End, my father\u2019s business, everything. My father\u2019s attorney came to tell me the market crash had reduced the family business to ruins. My mother\u2019s attorney then came to tell me I\u2019d inherit millions from my grandparents when I turned eighteen and that Virginia would, too, if she managed to live that long.\u201d Lenora stares into her glass like it\u2019s a crystal ball. But instead of the future, all she can see is the past. \u201cMeanwhile, the police kept coming around with their suspicions and insinuations,\u201d she says. \u201cThe servants quit in droves. I had the others fired, worried they thought the same way as the police and might take matters into their own hands. My friends dropped me immediately. As did Peter.\u201d \u201cPeter Ward?\u201d I say, picturing the portraits in the hall, black silk crepe now hanging from three of them like party streamers. \u201cThe painter?\u201d \u201cWe were in love,\u201d Lenora says. \u201cAt least, I was. After the murders, he wanted nothing to do with me. I never saw him again. Then there was my sister to care for and an estate to run and no one to help me but Archie, who did it solely out of devotion to Virginia. I knew he didn\u2019t give a damn about me. And all I wanted was to be somewhere else\u2014and someone else.\u201d Lenora looks up from her glass, seeking sympathy. \u201cCertainly you can understand that. You know what it\u2019s like to be accused of something you didn\u2019t do. To have everyone leave, to grapple with fear and grief alone. In the past six months, haven\u2019t you wanted to change everything about your situation?\u201d I have. And I did. I came to Hope\u2019s End. \u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cBut my options were limited.\u201d Lenora flinches, as if this is the first time someone has pointed out that people like her have advantages people like me can only dream about. \u201cMine weren\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen six months passed and it became clear the police had no proof to charge me of any wrongdoing, I realized how I could escape.\u201d \u201cYou had Virginia declared dead,\u201d I say. \u201cIt was easy,\u201d Lenora says with a nod. \u201cEspecially with someone as corruptible as Dr. Walden. I took him to the garage, showed him my father\u2019s remaining Packards, and said he could take his pick if he declared Virginia legally dead. I threw in another car for his wife if he also claimed that my health depended on getting rest and relaxation far away from Hope\u2019s End. That settled it. Virginia was dead, I turned eighteen and inherited not just my share of my grandparents\u2019 inheritance but hers as well. Then I departed for Europe on my doctor\u2019s orders. Right before I left, though, I made sure to become Mrs. Baker. And Virginia\u2014\u201d I exhale, astonished not just by the craftiness of her plan but by its cruelty. \u201cBecame Lenora Hope,\u201d I say. \n I see you nodding, Mary. You knew, didn\u2019t you? Good girl. I had a feeling you at least suspected it. Yes, my real name is Virginia Hope, although she\u2019s officially been dead for decades. In that time, through my sister\u2019s sheer force of will, I became Lenora. How this happened requires skipping ahead, I\u2019m afraid. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll get the full story about the murders soon. But for now, I must jump to six months after that night. I\u2019d been confined to my bed that whole time, unable to speak, incapable of moving anything but my left hand. Useless Dr. Walden had declared me brain dead, when the truth was my brain was one of the few things about me that actually worked. I knew from Archie, by my side more often than not, that my parents were dead and that my sister had them cremated the moment the law allowed it. I also knew that she was the one everyone blamed for their deaths, although there was scant evidence to prove it. And I knew that my name had been changed. Not legally, of course. That would have left a paper trail, which is the last thing my sister wanted. This was a more informal change, slipped into my life as quickly as a knife to the ribs. One day, she strode into my room without warning and said, \u201cYour name is Lenora Hope. Mine is Mrs. Baker. Never forget that.\u201d At first, I was confused. Even though I was at my weakest and most addled, I knew I was Virginia. Yet my sister kept calling me Lenora, as if I\u2019d been mistaken. As if all my life I\u2019d been wrong about something so defining as my own name. \u201cHow are you, Lenora?\u201d she said every time she peeked into my room to check in on me. At night, she told me, \u201cTime for sleep, Lenora.\u201d At meals, she announced, \u201cTime to eat, Lenora.\u201d One morning, I awoke to her sitting beside the bed, my hand in hers. She stroked the back of it gently, the way our mother had done. Without looking at me, she said, \u201cI\u2019m leaving for a while. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be gone. Archie will take care of you until I return. Goodbye, Lenora.\u201d Then she was gone. For years. How many, I\u2019m no longer sure. Time passes differently when you don\u2019t speak, barely move, spend most of your time watching the seasons gradually change outside your window. She returned as suddenly as she had departed. Marching into my room one day, she said, \u201cI\u2019m back, Lenora. Did you miss your beloved Mrs. Baker?\u201d Again, I was confused. The whole time she was away, Archie had called me Virginia. Yet here was my sister, back to addressing me as Lenora. It went on like this for months. \u201cHow are you, Lenora?\u201d \u201cTime for sleep, Lenora.\u201d \u201cTime to eat, Lenora.\u201d I surrendered eventually. I had no choice. I was Lenora. The physician who replaced Dr. Walden called me that, as did every nurse I had. I got so used to it that sometimes even I forgot who I really was. And what of the real Lenora? She was fully Mrs. Baker, of course, taking the place of the real Miss Baker, who\u2019d fled Hope\u2019s End just before the murders. The only time she ever acknowledged what she\u2019d done was one night a few months after her return. She crept into my room and gathered me into her arms. A sure sign she was drunk. My sister never touched me when she was sober. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI had to do it. I had to have a life of my own. Just for a little bit.\u201d Since then, it\u2019s been a game of pretend. That I\u2019m Lenora. That she\u2019s Mrs. Baker. That we\u2019re not sisters but just an incapacitated boss and her devoted servant. And it\u2019s how things will remain until one of us Hope girls dies. I know she thinks it\u2019s me who will go first. Now my only goal in a life that had once been filled with many dreams and desires is to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. \n THIRTY-EIGHT You must think me a terrible person,\u201d Lenora says after detailing her life away from Hope\u2019s End. Spending two years in France. Drinking in music halls. Mingling with artists. Kissing strangers on the streets of Paris. She met an American serviceman, fell in love, got engaged, was crushed when he died. All those photographs I found in her bedroom were snapshots of that other life. The one Virginia had dreamed about. And the one Lenora stole from her. \u201cYes.\u201d Even if I lie, she\u2019ll know from the look of repulsion I\u2019m certain is on my face. \u201cYou are.\u201d Terrible. And selfish. And heartless. Because Lenora didn\u2019t just take the life her sister longed for. She took away the chance for Virginia to have any kind of life at all. \u201cHow could you?\u201d I say. \u201cShe was your sister. I know you didn\u2019t like each other. But she was the only family you had left.\u201d \u201cWhat else could I have done?\u201d \u201cTold the truth.\u201d Lenora slams the glass down, sloshing wine. It spatters the counter like blood. \u201cI tried! No one believed me! In everyone\u2019s mind, Lenora Hope had slaughtered her family. I couldn\u2019t continue to be her. I would have been as much a captive in this house as my sister. And what good would that have done? Virginia couldn\u2019t talk, couldn\u2019t walk, couldn\u2019t do anything. By pushing my identity onto her\u2014\u201d \u201cAgainst her will,\u201d I interject. \u201cYes, against her will. But by doing that, at least one of us got to enjoy a little freedom. At least one of us got to have a life outside of Hope\u2019s End.\u201d \u201cWhy did you come back?\u201d \u201cEurope was changing,\u201d Lenora says as she blots at the spilled wine with the cuff of her sleeve, the black fabric sucking up the red liquid. \u201cThe storm was gathering, and everyone knew it was only a matter of time before it swept across the continent. I got out and came back here, pretending to be Miss Baker, the prodigal tutor returning to an estate in dire need of her assistance. My sister was Lenora Hope, unfortunate victim of polio and multiple strokes. Because we kept a low profile, no one knew it was all a lie. No one but Archie, who understood the benefit of keeping silent.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you leave again after the war?\u201d \u201cI no longer had the desire,\u201d Lenora says with a shrug. \u201cOr, frankly, the money. What I inherited wasn\u2019t infinite. It\u2019s expensive keeping this place going. And keeping our secrets required additional but necessary costs.\u201d \u201cLike paying off Berniece Mayhew,\u201d I say. Lenora nods, grudgingly impressed I know about that. \u201cThe night of the murders, she saw me in the kitchen fetching a knife. And no, I did not use it to kill my parents.\u201d \u201cThen why did you spend so much money making sure Berniece kept quiet?\u201d \u201cBecause even though I\u2019m innocent, her testimony would have been the proof the police needed to charge me with multiple homicides. I knew it, and Berniece knew it, too, so I paid her off. But now the money\u2019s running out. There\u2019s no third act for me. I got away. Not for long. But it was enough.\u201d \u201cFor you, maybe,\u201d I say bitterly. \u201cBut Virginia didn\u2019t even get that.\u201d Lenora crosses her arms and fixes me with one of her frigid stares. \u201cIf my sister had wanted\u2014truly wanted\u2014a life like mine, then she wouldn\u2019t have tried to take her own.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cMy dear, how else do you think Virginia ended up dangling from that chandelier?\u201d Shock rolls through me like thunder. \u201cShe hanged herself? How do you know that?\u201d \u201cThere was a chair placed under the chandelier,\u201d Lenora says. \u201cI assume she stood on it to loop the rope around one of the arms of the chandelier. She then tied the rope around her neck and stepped off the chair. The chandelier barely held her.\u201d I think back to Jessie\u2019s murder tour and how I noticed the slanted chandelier that looked as if it had been jarred out of the ceiling. \u201cWasn\u2019t she pregnant?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Lenora says, her voice clipped. \u201cNot then.\u201d I wait for her to elaborate. She doesn\u2019t. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the police suspect Virginia tried to kill herself if there was a chair there?\u201d Lenora stares at me, unblinking. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t there when they arrived.\u201d This time, no elaboration is necessary. I understand exactly what she means\u2014rather than try to help her sister, Lenora moved the chair so the police wouldn\u2019t know Virginia killed herself. That realization causes me to recoil. I take several backward steps, wanting to put as much distance between us as possible. Until now, I could almost summon some grudging sympathy for Lenora. But this? This was monstrous. \u201cI did it to protect her,\u201d she says, no doubt knowing what I\u2019m thinking because I make no attempt to hide it. \u201cHow was that protecting her?\u201d I say. \u201cShe tried to kill herself and you did nothing but cover it up.\u201d \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t, then the police would have known the truth,\u201d Lenora says, her voice ice cold. \u201cThey, like me, would have realized the reason Virginia tried to commit suicide.\u201d I take another backward step, this one driven purely by shock. \u201cYou think Virginia murdered your parents.\u201d \u201cI know she murdered them.\u201d Lenora\u2019s tone shifts from steely to tremulous, as if it\u2019s being chipped away with a chisel. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not surprised, considering what we did to her.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s \u2018we\u2019?\u201d \u201cMe,\u201d Lenora says, punctuating the word with a sip of wine and a hard swallow. \u201cMy father. The real Miss Baker. After what we did, the only surprise is that she didn\u2019t kill us all.\u201d \n I gave birth on the floor of my bedroom. It\u2019s one of the few things I remember. The baby coming so quickly that there wasn\u2019t time to get onto the bed. So I was forced to lay in the puddle I\u2019d created on the floor, my head knocking against the wall as I writhed in pain. Another thing I\u2019ll never forget--the sweaty agony of it all. Like I was splitting in half, shedding my skin, being reborn through the fire of pure pain. I had only my sister and Miss Baker, who rushed in to help after hearing my cries. Neither of them knew what they were doing. So I pushed. I screamed. I hurt. At some point, exhausted and delirious from pain, I blacked out. My body was still pushing, crying, screaming, and hurting, but my mind was elsewhere. I pictured me and Ricky on a hillside studded with wildflowers and white-capped mountains in the distance. We stood in the sunlight, our child in my arms, as birds in the surrounding pines sang a song meant just for us. Only when the birdsong turned to crying did I snap back to reality. Mother\u2019s instinct. I knew my child had been born. And that it needed me. He needed me. I saw my child was a boy when my sister returned from the kitchen with a butcher knife she used to cut the umbilical cord. He was so tiny. So fragile. But when I looked at him, I felt a love so fierce it startled me. Nothing else in the world mattered but him. I was his mother, and I knew I would do anything to protect him. At last, my life had a purpose, which was to love my child more than anything else. That realization was the happiest moment of my life. That happiness left me the second I saw that my father was also in the room. He\u2019d spent the labor pacing Miss Baker\u2019s room next door, not emerging until he heard my baby crying. As my sister was about to put my son into my arms, he said, \u201cLenora, take the baby into the other room.\u201d My sister froze. My child in her arms did not. He wriggled, kicked, and cried. One of his tiny hands reached out for me, as if he already knew I was his mother and that he belonged in my empty arms. I reached out, too, stretching my hand until our fingers touched. A single second of contact. That\u2019s all I was allowed. \u201cLenora,\u201d my father said, more sternly this time. \u201cTake the child.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t she at least hold him?\u201d My father shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019ll only make it worse.\u201d \u201cBut she\u2019s his mother,\u201d my sister said. \u201cShe\u2019s not,\u201d my father replied. \u201cShe never had a child. And that baby is not a Hope. None of this happened. Now you\u2019ll either take that bastard into the other room or I\u2019ll take it from you and throw it off the terrace. Then I\u2019ll disown both you and your sister.\u201d Lenora couldn\u2019t bring herself to look at me as she stood and carried my son out of the room, even as I begged her to stay. \u201cNo, Lenora! Please, please don\u2019t go! Please give him to me!\u201d I wanted to chase after her, but I couldn\u2019t. My body was too weak. The effort of bringing a new life into the world had sapped all life from me. Still, I tried, continuing to scream. \u201cPlease, Lenora! Let me have my baby!\u201d But she was already gone, shutting the door between the rooms and blocking out the sound of my child\u2019s cries. Miss Baker grabbed my father by the shoulders and shook him. \u201cWinston, you can\u2019t do this,\u201d she hissed. \u201cIt\u2019s barbaric.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s for the best,\u201d my father said. \u201cThis family can\u2019t afford another scandal.\u201d \u201cBut Virginia is your daughter. Your only legitimate daughter. And if you take that child away from her, you\u2019ll lose her forever.\u201d \u201cI refuse to have another bastard in this family,\u201d my father said. \u201cSays a man who\u2019s likely fathered several,\u201d Miss Baker shot back. Ignoring the remark, my father knelt before me, untouched by my despair. Even as I wept, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my darling. You brought this on yourself.\u201d \u201cPlease,\u201d I said, my voice weakening as quickly as my body. \u201cPlease let me keep him. I\u2019ll be a good girl if you do. I\u2019ll never do anything wrong again.\u201d My father chucked my chin. \u201cMy darling, you\u2019ve done enough wrong to last a lifetime.\u201d Exhaustion lapped over me in waves so strong I suspected I was dying of heartbreak. I hoped so. Death seemed a better option than this unfathomable grief. Yet I remained alive as Miss Baker dressed me in a fresh nightgown and put me to bed. As she mopped up the mess I\u2019d made on the floor, I listened for the sound of my son in the other room. All was quiet. The only one still crying was me. Miss Baker, done with cleaning, clasped my hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Virginia. I\u2019ll think of something to make him change his mind.\u201d I was too tired--and too utterly despondent--to reply. Grief and exhaustion had me in their grip, and I felt like I was being pulled into a dark pit from which I\u2019d never emerge. The last thing I heard was Miss Baker saying, \u201cI swear to you, he won\u2019t take that child from you forever.\u201d She was lying. I never saw her--or my child--again. \n THIRTY-NINE I didn\u2019t think it could get any worse. That Virginia had endured enough. I was wrong. Because Lenora keeps talking, revealing all the ways in which her sister had suffered. Forced to give birth on the floor. The baby taken from her before she could even hold him. Her father\u2019s casual disdain in the face of her heartbreak. It\u2019s all so tragic it takes my breath away. \u201cYou should have stopped him,\u201d I say, speaking despite the sudden tightness in my chest. \u201cYou should have defied his orders.\u201d \u201cI wanted to,\u201d Lenora says, her voice cracking. \u201cTruly, I did. But you didn\u2019t know my father. He was capable of great cruelty. I worried he really would murder that child if given the chance. And I was certain he\u2019d go through with his threat to disown me. I wasn\u2019t his daughter. Not really.\u201d \u201cBut she was your sister!\u201d \u201cIn name only. We were never close. Virginia and I were as opposite as summer and winter.\u201d The comparison is apt. Looking at Lenora Hope, all I see is frigid coldness. Upstairs lies Virginia, as warm and restless as a July afternoon. Two sisters who, like the seasons they represent, never connected. Something always stood between them. So Lenora took the baby into what was Miss Baker\u2019s room but is now mine. She cradled him and shushed his cries by letting him suckle her pinkie finger. She waited for her father to return and tell her what to do. According to Lenora, he never did. \u201cMiss Baker eventually came into the room and began packing up her things,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I asked what she was doing, she said, \u2018Leaving, of course. With the child.\u2019 \u201d Lenora registers my surprise and shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. For all her faults, Miss Baker was a good woman. She convinced my father to do what he always did\u2014use money to make the problem go away. In exchange for some money and one of his Packards, she\u2019d take custody of the baby. Her plan was to be a temporary mother to him until he and Virginia could be reunited. I agreed to help as long as my father never learned of my involvement. Then she drove off in the night, taking the baby with her.\u201d \u201cDo you know where she went?\u201d Lenora nods. \u201cCanada.\u201d I spare a thought for Carter, who was mistaken about his true heritage. There\u2019s no way Virginia\u2019s baby is the same one left on that church doorstep on Christmas morning. He\u2019s no more related to the Hope family than I am. At the same time, it appears to exonerate Lenora, the person I thought was responsible. Since Carter isn\u2019t related to Virginia, he\u2019ll inherit nothing. There was no reason for Lenora to keep him and Mary from finding that out. \u201cMiss Baker wrote to me a few weeks after the murders,\u201d Lenora says. \u201cShe\u2019d heard what happened and said that, under the circumstances, it would be best if she continued to raise the child as her own. I didn\u2019t protest.\u201d I stare at her, shocked. \u201cBut he was your nephew.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think I should have done?\u201d \u201cKept him!\u201d I cry. \u201cRaised him. Loved him. And you damn well should have let Virginia love him.\u201d \u201cAnd what kind of life would that have been? For both Virginia and the child? She couldn\u2019t hold him, let alone feed him. She couldn\u2019t talk to him or play with him or do anything for him.\u201d \u201cYou would have figured out a way.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d Lenora says. \u201cI was seventeen. I knew nothing about taking care of a baby.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s still no reason to keep your sister and her child apart!\u201d Anger churns in my chest, crashing inside me like the waves smashing against the cliff directly below us. \u201cHow could you be so cruel?\u201d \u201cCruel?\u201d Lenora says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite the opposite, I assure you. Keeping that child away from this family was the ultimate act of kindness. Because of me and Miss Baker, that child grew up never knowing that his real mother was a murderer.\u201d \u201cAnd you\u2019re punishing Virginia because of that fact.\u201d \u201cShe deserves punishment! After what she did, a price needed to be paid. But I\u2019m protecting her, too. I always have. Think about what would happen to a woman in her condition if the police learned what she\u2019d done.\u201d I shake my head. That\u2019s not a good enough reason. Especially when, other than trying to hang herself, there\u2019s nothing to suggest Virginia killed her parents. \u201cWhy are you so certain she did it? What about Ricardo Mayhew?\u201d \u201cWhat about him?\u201d \u201cHe and Virginia were having an affair,\u201d I say. \u201cHe was the baby\u2019s father. And Berniece Mayhew followed him here that night.\u201d Lenora laughs. The last reaction I\u2019d expected. There\u2019s nothing remotely funny about the fact that she\u2019s blamed her sister for murders she might not have committed. Yet Lenora keeps laughing, a low chuckle that\u2019s more disbelieving than amused. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy?\u201d I hear footsteps on the service stairs. A second later, Archie emerges into the kitchen. I have no idea how long he\u2019s been there or how much he\u2019s heard. All I know is it was long enough for him to answer my question. \u201cBecause Ricardo was with me that night.\u201d It takes me a second to understand what he\u2019s getting at. When I do, all I can say is, \u201cOh. The two of you were\u2014\u201d \u201cLovers,\u201d Archie says, sparing me from having to say it. In the span of seconds, I think of a dozen follow-up questions. Archie doesn\u2019t give me time to ask a single one. \u201cI was as surprised as you are now,\u201d he says. \u201cFor one, he was married, although in those days and in my limited experience, that was usually the case. It\u2019s not like today, which allows for slightly more freedom. Back then, it had to be kept secret. Especially for someone like me. I was barely eighteen. One wrong move and my whole life could have been ruined.\u201d Archie tells me how he and Ricardo met in secret, sneaking away whenever they could. It wasn\u2019t easy. Ricardo shared the cottage with his wife. Archie lived in one of the rooms over the garage, which is where they usually met. \u201cWe called it our love nest.\u201d Archie allows himself a brief smile of fondness before it fades into a frown. \u201cIt\u2019s where we were the night of the murders.\u201d It turns out Berniece had been wrong about her husband trying to throw her off his trail by going to the garage first before sneaking into the mansion through the front door. Then again, Berniece had been wrong about many things, including who her husband was really having an affair with. \u201cSince everyone had been given the night off and Berniece had gone to the movies, we knew we had a few hours just to ourselves,\u201d Archie says. \u201cBut Ricardo was upset. He said Berniece confronted him about having an affair with Lenora.\u201d Lenora chimes in. \u201cWhich was utterly ridiculous. I didn\u2019t even know who he was.\u201d \u201cShe told him he had to end it,\u201d Archie adds. \u201cAfter they blackmailed Winston Hope. Ricardo wanted nothing to do with the plan. It was wrong, both morally and factually, and he feared it would eventually lead to the truth about the two of us getting out. A disaster for both of us. But he had a plan of his own. He asked me to run away with him.\u201d \u201cThat night?\u201d \u201cImmediately. He wanted to head west. Maybe to California. He said he heard people there were more tolerant. He said there was a chance we could be happy there. But I knew better.\u201d Archie shuffles to a stool. He sits, slumped, as if the sad memories he\u2019s recalling are literally weighing him down. \u201cRunning away is never as easy as it seems. I know because I\u2019d already done it, fleeing a family who hated me because I was different, because I wasn\u2019t like most other boys. But I found my way here\u2014and to Virginia.\u201d \u201cDid she know?\u201d I say. Archie responds with a nod. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons I loved her so much. She didn\u2019t judge me. Or shame me. Or, thank goodness, try to change who I am. She simply accepted me. And I couldn\u2019t leave her. Not when she was pregnant. Not when she needed me. Because that\u2019s another thing Ricardo told me\u2014that Berniece had spotted her the night before and knew of her condition. That meant everyone would soon know. When that happened, Virginia would need me more than ever.\u201d \u201cSo you stayed,\u201d I say, meaning not just that night but all the ones after it. Decades of nights in which he\u2019d sneak into Virginia\u2019s room to check on her and wish her pleasant dreams. \u201cI stayed,\u201d Archie says. \u201cRicardo left. I never heard from him again.\u201d The sadness of his story leaves me convinced that Hope\u2019s End is cursed in some way. Maybe it was merely bad luck. Or perhaps because of Winston Hope\u2019s hubris in building a mansion at the edge of a cliff despite knowing it was only a matter of time before it crumbled into the ocean. Whatever the cause, no one here got the life they wanted. No one was granted a happy ending. Not Archie. Not Lenora. And certainly not Virginia. Yet despite now knowing all their tragic tales, one question remains unanswered. \u201cThen who was Ricky?\u201d \u201cOne of the local boys hired for seasonal help,\u201d Archie says. \u201cA bunch of them came and went all the time. Virginia never told me his last name. Or his first. She just used the nickname, making it impossible to track him down after the murders. I suspect by that point, he didn\u2019t want to be found.\u201d A strange mix of emotions swirls through me. There\u2019s disappointment from the reality that Ricky wasn\u2019t the person I assumed he was. In fact, he wasn\u2019t anyone important at all. Just a boy who took advantage of a girl so desperately lonely she gave away her innocence and, ultimately, her freedom. But Virginia isn\u2019t blameless. I\u2019m angry at her. Not for being na\u00efve. She was just a child when Ricky came along. She didn\u2019t know any better. But what she did to her parents was so unimaginably terrible that I simultaneously hate her, feel sorry for her, and, despite everything I\u2019ve learned tonight, still hold out hope that Archie and Lenora are wrong. I suppose that makes me the na\u00efve one. \u201cThe murders still could have been committed by someone other than Virginia, right?\u201d \u201cThere was no one else it could have been, Kit,\u201d Archie says with a sigh. \u201cAnd I know it changes your perception of her. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time wondering why she did it. But I made peace with the fact that I\u2019ll never know. I might not approve of what Virginia did, but it doesn\u2019t make me hate her. It\u2019s possible to love someone while hating something they\u2019ve done.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m still trying to come to terms with it,\u201d Lenora says as a look passes between us. I take it to mean she knows I know it was her who used the typewriter in the middle of the night, filling a page with the same accusation. It\u2019s all your fault I\u2019m stuck somewhere in between, resigned to the fact that Virginia murdered her parents yet still clinging to one last bit of hope. \u201cBut why are you absolutely certain it was her?\u201d I say. \u201cBecause I saw her,\u201d Lenora says. \u201cLater that night, after Miss Baker departed with the baby, I heard Virginia leave her room. I went to see where she was going and saw her descending the Grand Stairs.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s guilty.\u201d Lenora picks up her wineglass. Before emptying it, she says, \u201cIt does when Virginia was carrying a knife.\u201d \n To this day, I\u2019m still not sure where I found the strength to get out of bed and leave my room. Sheer force of will, I suppose, brought on by a mother\u2019s fierce determination. Yet pain still tore through my body as I slid out of bed. My legs buckled, and for a moment I thought I\u2019d collapse onto the floor. But I remained steady, pushing through the agony, needing to find my child. Before leaving the room, I spotted something sitting on the nightstand. A knife. The same one used to sever the cord connecting me and my baby, now forgotten during the commotion following the birth. I picked it up, telling myself I needed something to use as protection. Against what, I didn\u2019t know. Perhaps my father. Or my sister and Miss Baker. Deep down, though, I knew the opposite to be true. I was seeking a weapon. And if anyone needed protection, it was my father. Knife in hand, I left my room, pushed through pain on my way down the hallway, and began to hobble down the Grand Stairs. At the landing, I stopped and listened. There were voices coming from the billiard room. One was my father. The other belonged to Ricky. And although I couldn\u2019t make out what they were saying, both of them sounded angry. I descended the remaining steps slowly, careful not to make a sound. I needed to know what they were saying before deciding if I should make my presence known. If their voices calmed, then perhaps it meant Ricky was successful in persuading my father to let us wed, let us keep the baby, let us live happily ever after. I should have realized that those things only exist in fairy tales. For there was no happily ever after. Not for me. As I reached the ground floor, I glimpsed Lenora near the top of the Grand Stairs. \u201cVirginia,\u201d she whispered as she nervously clung to the banister. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I refused to answer. She\u2019d find out soon enough. As I continued moving to the billiard room, I heard her footfalls on the second-floor hallway. Running away, of course. Too cowardly to face the damage she\u2019d helped create. If only she had let me run away instead, none of this would have happened. There was noise up ahead as well, making it clear nothing about the situation had calmed. My father\u2019s voice had only gotten louder, booming out of the billiard room and echoing down the hall. Before I reached them, I paused for a moment at the four portraits in the hall. My father intended the paintings to make us appear like one big, happy family, secure in our status, content with our lives. To achieve that effect, he should have had Peter Ward picture us together. A vast canvas depicting the four of us in our regal best, posed oh so carefully in one of Hope\u2019s End\u2019s many well-appointed rooms. Instead, Peter had painted us separately. In the process, he accidentally depicted the family as we really were--four strangers, utterly alone, each one of us boxed in by a gilded frame, unable or unwilling to escape. Not me, I decided. I was determined to leave this place forever. And I would take my baby with me. Even if I had to kill to do it. Tightening my grip on the knife, I then turned and entered the billiard room. \n FORTY Upstairs, the woman I\u2019d thought was Lenora Hope is in bed but wide awake, as if she knew I\u2019d be coming. No surprise there. I always had the feeling she was more aware than she let on. Virginia likely had known this moment would arrive since my first night here, when she typed those tantalizing words. i want to tell you everything She didn\u2019t, yet I learned it all anyway. Right up to the moment she went searching for her father, a knife gripped in her hand. \u201cI ran to alert my mother, who was in her usual daze,\u201d Lenora told me. \u201cNo one had bothered to tell her about Virginia, the urgent labor, my father\u2019s orders to take the baby. She had no idea. But her mind seemed to sharpen as I told her what had happened\u2014and what I worried was about to happen. She patted my cheek and said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, my dear. I\u2019ll handle this.\u2019 It was the last thing she ever said to me.\u201d Silence fell over the kitchen then. Even though we didn\u2019t acknowledge it, I knew both Lenora and I were recalling our mothers\u2019 final words. Please, Kit-Kat. Please. I\u2019ll only take one. I promise. \u201cI don\u2019t think Virginia intended to kill her,\u201d Lenora eventually said. \u201cI think my father was her sole target and that my mother got caught up in it somehow. Collateral damage. And I suspect my sister felt so guilty about it that she then tried to hang herself.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve gone along with everything for so many years,\u201d Archie said. \u201cHere, Virginia is safe. Here, no one knows what she\u2019s done. It\u2019s for her own good. I believe that to my very soul.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t let her go outside,\u201d Lenora added. \u201cAnd why we always refer to her as Miss Hope. If others found out who she is and what she did\u2014what we continue to do\u2014it could destroy Virginia. Imagine her in some state facility, wasting away. At least here she\u2019s home.\u201d But Hope\u2019s End isn\u2019t a home. It\u2019s a cage built of secrets. And Virginia\u2019s not the only person trapped in it. Lenora and Archie are, too. I refuse to join them. That\u2019s why I now stand at the foot of Virginia\u2019s bed. It\u2019s time to say goodbye. \u201cI know who you are,\u201d I tell her. She gazes at me, unsurprised. In fact, I detect a hint of satisfaction in her eyes, as if she\u2019s proud of me for sussing everything out. \u201cI also know you murdered your parents.\u201d Virginia lifts her left hand, ready to tap a response. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I say, in no mood for a denial. But I also don\u2019t want confirmation. In a sense, nothing has changed since my first night here. Despite assuming she was guilty, I was also hesitant to find out if I was right. Once the typing started, the opposite ended up happening. I began to assume she was innocent and became hell-bent on being proven correct. It turns out I was only fooling myself into believing what I wanted to be the truth, even though deep down I knew it wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s likely how my father felt right before he stopped speaking to me. The newspaper in his hand, the disbelief in his eyes, the telling himself the complete opposite of what he assumed deep down in his bones. What they\u2019re saying\u2019s not true, Kit-Kat. \u201cI understand why you felt the need to do it,\u201d I tell Virginia. \u201cYou had your reasons. And I hope you regret it now. You\u2019ve had plenty of time to think about your actions. And I just wish\u2014\u201d I stop, unable to articulate exactly how I feel. If there\u2019s a word for feeling betrayed, foolish, and disappointed all at once, I\u2019ve yet to learn it. Because the truth is, I liked Virginia. I still like her, despite everything. That\u2019s what makes this so hard. It\u2019s likely Mary reacted the same way when she found out, necessitating that typed apology from Virginia. im sorry im not the person you thought i was \u201cI wish you\u2019d been able to tell me everything yourself,\u201d I say. Instead, I got only hints and half-truths. Although she never outright lied to me, she never told me the whole story, either. It would have been so easy, too. A simple sentence, typed with her left hand, telling me that she was Virginia Hope, that everything I thought I knew was a lie, that she was guilty. If she had done that, I might have been able to stay. The job was to take care of a killer. I knew that from the start. And I think I could have done that for as long as necessary. But now? Now I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever trust or believe Virginia again. Which means my only option is to leave. \u201cGoodbye, Virginia,\u201d I say. \u201cI hope whoever\u2019s assigned to care for you next never tries to learn the truth.\u201d Giving her a sad little wave, I move into my own room, forcing myself not to look at Virginia on the way out. I feel her stare anyway, the heat of her green eyes following me as I go. Then, as promised, I leave without packing. No suitcase of clothes. No box of books. No medical bag. I decide to arrange for Carter to bring them to me later. Or maybe I\u2019ll just leave them here, joining Mary\u2019s belongings. A growing collection of things abandoned by previous caregivers for the next unfortunate one to discover. The only thing I take is my car keys, which I clutch in my hands as I hurry down the service stairs. The kitchen is empty, thank God. I don\u2019t know where Lenora or Archie went, and I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m in no mood to see them again, either. Before leaving, I go to the phone hanging on the wall and dial quickly, knowing either of them could enter as the phone rings and rings. When my father finally answers, he sounds groggy and confused. I check the kitchen clock. It\u2019s almost midnight. I woke him up. \u201cDaddy,\u201d I say. \u201cKit-Kat?\u201d My heart, thudding so heavily for so long, skips a joyous beat. I had no idea how much I needed to hear that. \u201cCan I come home? Right now?\u201d \u201cOf course. What\u2019s going on? You sound scared.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t stay here any longer,\u201d I say. \u201cI need to get away from this place. And them.\u201d \u201cThem?\u201d \u201cLenora and Virginia. They\u2019ve been lying all this time. And I can\u2019t be a part of it.\u201d But it\u2019s not just that. There\u2019s something else as well. I need to confess. \u201cWhen I get home, I have things to tell you. About what happened to Mom.\u201d I hang up to keep myself from saying the rest. That can\u2019t be spoken on the phone. It needs to be said in person, face-to-face, which is what I should have done six months ago. What they\u2019re saying\u2019s not true, Kit-Kat. But it is. All of it. Memories of that night wash over me as I leave the kitchen, trot down the hallway, whisk my way toward the front door. My mother, in pain so severe that few words exist to describe it. She wasn\u2019t wracked with pain. She was aflame with it. She was possessed by it. Me, literally creaking from exhaustion and worry and aching empathy, waiting for the painkiller to kick in, desperate to provide her with some small amount of relief. I stroked her hair. I whispered soothing words into her ears. I prayed to a God I wasn\u2019t sure I believed in to do something to put her out of her misery. Eventually, the pain broke. It was still there, of course, but just a simmer instead of a full boil. The fentanyl had leashed it enough to allow my mother to rest, which was all I could reasonably hope for at that moment. As she fell asleep, I reached for the fentanyl bottle, ready to take it back to the lockbox under my bed. I\u2019d barely wrapped my fingers around it when I felt my mother\u2019s hand on mine, stilling it. \u201cLeave them,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not allowed to do that.\u201d \u201cJust for tonight.\u201d Her voice was raspy, labored, slowly but surely filling with renewed pain. \u201cJust in case I need one.\u201d \u201cMom, I can\u2019t.\u201d She tightened her grip atop my hand, shockingly strong for someone so utterly depleted. In hindsight, I don\u2019t think it was her doing it. It was the pain, taking over and moving her like a marionette. \u201cPlease, Kit-Kat,\u201d my mother whispered. \u201cPlease.\u201d What followed was an internal tug-of-war that felt like hours but in reality lasted mere seconds. Part of me was compelled to follow protocol, do the right thing, care for her in the responsible way I\u2019d been trained to do. But another part of me knew that my mother was suffering\u2014and that I could help alleviate it. \u201cI\u2019ll only take one,\u201d she said. \u201cI promise.\u201d One more pill. That wasn\u2019t so bad. It was more than recommended, but sometimes rules had to be broken. This, I concluded, was one of those times. \u201cJust one,\u201d I said. Then I placed the pill bottle back on the nightstand. Even though I\u2019m sure it barely made a sound then, in my memory it\u2019s as loud as the front door to Hope\u2019s End slamming shut behind me. When I went to bed that night, I had a sickening feeling my mother intended to take every pill in that bottle. Call it a sixth sense. Or a premonition. Yet I convinced myself that she knew better, ignoring how extreme suffering could cloud someone\u2019s judgment. I wanted to think she wouldn\u2019t purposefully overdose, so that was what I believed. As a result, my mother is dead. All because of my actions. I hop into my car and drive off, the steering wheel unsteady beneath my shaking hands. I refuse to treat my father the way Virginia treated me. Pretending to be innocent. Forcing him to live with nagging doubt for the rest of his days. Driving a wedge between us until we\u2019ve become exactly like the Hope sisters\u2014stuck with each other in a cycle of suspicion and guilt. The truth will set me free\u2014even if it might also send me to prison. I bring the car to a stop at the gate, which blocks the driveway like the bars of a jail cell. I get out of the car and hit the button embedded into the wall. As I walk back to the car, the gate shimmies open. Then it rattles. Then it stops. I pound the roof of the Escort in frustration. Not this. Not now. As I march back to the gate, determined to push it all the way open, I hear footfalls fast and furious in the grass, followed by Carter\u2019s panting voice. \u201cKit? Where are you going?\u201d I spin around, squinting in the glare of the car\u2019s headlights as Carter emerges from the darkness. \u201cI heard you driving away and ran to catch up. Are you leaving?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause I was wrong,\u201d I say. \u201cWe were wrong.\u201d I pull on the gate, forgetting Carter\u2019s warning when I first arrived. This place can bite. He was at least right about that. Because when I give the gate another tug, I touch the wrong place at the wrong time. The story of my life. My hand\u2019s already wrapped around one of the bars before I feel it\u2014a spot of rusted wrought iron, weathered by salt air into a razor-sharp point. The metal pierces the skin of my left hand. Swearing, I jerk my hand back and examine the damage. Although small, the cut\u2019s bad enough to leave me bleeding. At least it wasn\u2019t for nothing. The gate is now open enough for my car to ease through it. \u201cWrong about what?\u201d Carter says. \u201cLenora\u2019s not your grandmother. She\u2019s not even Lenora. She\u2019s Virginia, Lenora\u2019s sister.\u201d Carter\u2019s face pales as he reels backward like a man who\u2019s just been shot. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t understand.\u201d I start walking toward the Escort. \u201cGet in and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d Carter doesn\u2019t move as I slide behind the wheel and rev the engine. I understand his shock, just as clearly as I understand the need to leave this place before it can cause further damage. Not just to me, but to Carter as well. \u201cCome with me,\u201d I tell him. \u201cJust for tonight. Come with me and we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d I have no idea what we\u2019ll do. Figure something out. I picture Ricardo Mayhew saying the same thing to Archie fifty-four years ago, urging the man he loved to escape Hope\u2019s End. Archie stayed. Carter doesn\u2019t. Without a word, he opens the passenger door and hops in. I hit the gas pedal, and together we pass through the gate, leaving Hope\u2019s End behind. \n FORTY-ONE Let me get this straight,\u201d Carter says. \u201cMrs. Baker is actually Lenora Hope. And Lenora is really Virginia Hope. And she\u2019s the one who killed her parents?\u201d \u201cCorrect.\u201d We\u2019ve been on the road for ten minutes, during which time I managed to tell him all that I\u2019ve learned during this long, surreal night. Still, I get why he\u2019s confused. It\u2019s a lot to take in, especially when it means he came to Hope\u2019s End for nothing. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not related to any of them,\u201d Carter says with a sigh, resigned to the fact that his birth family remains a mystery. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know how much you wanted to know.\u201d \u201cI thought I did know.\u201d Carter stares out the window, watching the scrubby pines of the Cliffs zip past as we descend into town. \u201cThe timeline seemed to fit perfectly.\u201d What neither of us counted on was the possibility of a premature birth, which I learned during my health aide training is more common in teenage mothers. As a result, Virginia likely has a child living somewhere in Canada, oblivious to who his mother is or what she\u2019s done, and Carter, who knows both of those things, still has no idea who his real grandmother could be. And Mary is dead because of it\u2014a horrible truth temporarily forgotten in a night filled with them. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about Mary,\u201d I say. \u201cHow she was killed for no reason whatsoever.\u201d Carter looks away from the window long enough to say, \u201cYou still think she was pushed?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know anymore.\u201d He sighs again. \u201cI\u2019m not Lenora\u2019s\u2014sorry, Virginia\u2019s\u2014grandson. So there\u2019d be no reason for someone to kill her because of that.\u201d \u201cBut she knew all the other secrets about that place,\u201d I say. \u201cLenora\u2019s true identity. Virginia\u2019s guilt. The fact that both have been lying about it for decades. Someone felt the need to stop her before she could reveal it all.\u201d \u201cSo that leaves either Archie or Lenora.\u201d \u201cMaybe,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Both Lenora and Archie laid bare all their secrets tonight. Yes, I\u2019d forced Lenora\u2019s hand when I told her I knew she wasn\u2019t really Mrs. Baker. But both were forthcoming after that. They did what Virginia had promised to do my first night at Hope\u2019s End\u2014tell me everything. What they didn\u2019t do was swear me to secrecy or threaten me in any way. If one of them was so concerned about Mary knowing the truth that they felt the need to murder her, then why am I still alive? Because I\u2019m not a threat to them. I doubt Mary was, either. But she was to someone. My left hand slips off the steering wheel, leaving a smear of blood, sticky and hot. Using my right hand to steer, I glance at the wound. It\u2019s still bleeding and probably infected, but I\u2019ll survive. That gate, however, should be melted into scrap metal. I wipe my hand on the skirt of my uniform, not caring about the stain it will leave. I\u2019ll never be wearing it again. In fact, I won\u2019t even be a caregiver again once Mr. Gurlain finds out I quit, fleeing Hope\u2019s End without even closing the damn gate behind me. Another thought occurs to me, about another time the gate was left open. \u201cHey, Carter,\u201d I say. \u201cWhen did you say you found the gate open?\u201d \u201cThe day Mary died.\u201d \u201cI meant the day. What day of the week?\u201d \u201cMonday.\u201d \u201cAnd what time?\u201d \u201cMidmorning. Why?\u201d Because Carter said he assumed it was left open after the groceries were delivered. But Archie told me those arrive on Tuesdays. A fact confirmed by all those receipts I found under Lenora\u2019s bed. That means the gate had been opened for a different reason. Not to let someone enter and leave, but to let someone leave and come back undetected. I did it myself earlier tonight. Opening the gate when I left for Ocean View Retirement Home and leaving it like that so I wouldn\u2019t need to call the main house to be let back in. Since the gate was open Monday morning, it\u2019s possible it had been like that since the night before. \u201cThe lab already had your blood sample, right?\u201d I say. \u201cYeah. I got it drawn the week before. All they needed was Virginia\u2019s blood.\u201d \u201cWhich Mary was supposed to get Monday night for you to bring to the lab the next day.\u201d \u201cWhich never happened,\u201d Carter reminds me. We\u2019ve entered town, the streets I\u2019ve known my entire life lit by the dull glow of streetlights. We pass Ocean View, where Berniece Mayhew is likely watching TV this very minute, and then Gurlain Home Health Aides. I make a right, heading to my father\u2019s house two blocks away. Even though I should be thinking about what I\u2019m going to tell him when I get there, my mind is preoccupied with something else. \u201cHow long does it take to get a blood sample analyzed?\u201d \u201cAbout a day,\u201d Carter says. \u201cSo if you took a sample to the lab on, say, a Sunday night, they\u2019d have the results Monday night?\u201d \u201cI guess so.\u201d Carter eyes me from the passenger seat. \u201cWhy are you so focused on that?\u201d Because it seems to be exactly what happened. Someone left Hope\u2019s End on Sunday night, leaving the gate open so they could return without anyone realizing they were gone. Carter noticed the open gate on Monday morning. He then left it open overnight because he intended to leave for the lab early Tuesday. During that time, someone could have left and returned once again. Someone like Mary. Coming back from the lab on Monday night. With the results of a blood analysis performed on a sample she brought there the night before. I slam the brakes, and the car comes to a screeching stop in the middle of the street. Carter looks at me, one hand braced against the dashboard and his body still thrust forward from the sudden stop. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u201cIt was you,\u201d I say. When she was pushed off the terrace, Mary wasn\u2019t leaving with a suitcase that contained a bunch of pages typed by Virginia and a sample of blood about to be tested. She was coming back with the results. \u201cYou knew Virginia wasn\u2019t your grandmother,\u201d I say. \u201cMary drew her blood and took it to the lab a day early. Because your bloodwork was already done, they could tell pretty quickly if it was a match. It wasn\u2019t. And when Mary told you the results, you\u2014\u201d \u201cKilled her?\u201d Carter says. \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d Because he wanted Hope\u2019s End. He changed where he worked, where he lived, his entire life. All because of the possibility he might be related to the infamous Lenora Hope and could one day inherit everything she owned. When Mary told him that wasn\u2019t the case, he did whatever he could to hide that fact. \u201cYou did it,\u201d I say. \u201cYou killed Mary.\u201d \u201cDo I look like a killer to you?\u201d He doesn\u2019t. Then again, neither does Virginia. Yet he\u2019s as guilty as she is. The only difference between them is that she\u2019s now harmless. Carter, however, isn\u2019t. I shoot a glance up the street, weighing my options. My father\u2019s house sits on the next block. I can see the warm glow of the porch light, beckoning me home. I can make a run for it and hope Carter doesn\u2019t catch up, or I can force him out of the Escort and speed the rest of the way home. I pick plan B. Being inside the car seems like the safest bet. I shove my right hand into my pocket, fumbling for the corkscrew. I pull it out and hold it up, its pointed tip aimed at Carter\u2019s side. He sees it and raises his hands. \u201cJesus, Kit. There\u2019s no need for this.\u201d \u201cGet out of the car,\u201d I say. Keeping his hands where I can see them, Carter unfastens his seat belt and pulls the handle of the passenger door. It clicks open, setting off a warning beep because the car\u2019s still running. \u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d he says. \u201cI swear to you I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe you!\u201d Anger courses through me, making my blood pump so hard I can feel the cut on my hand pulse. He lied to me. Just like Virginia lied to me. The pain of their twin betrayals stings like a third-degree burn. I jab the air with the corkscrew, forcing Carter closer to the open door. \u201cKit, please!\u201d I jab the corkscrew again, this time lunging forward until its tip is a breath away from Carter\u2019s neck. He scrambles out of the car and stands in the street, calling to me as I speed away, the passenger door flapping like a broken wing. Knowing Carter can still easily catch up to me, I aim not for the driveway but the yard, thumping over the sidewalk and skidding to a stop mere feet from the front door. I burst from the car, Carter\u2019s loud and fast footfalls echoing up the street behind me. \u201cKit, wait!\u201d he calls. I do the opposite, running to the front door, flinging it open, slamming it shut behind me. Carter reaches it just as I turn the deadbolt. He pounds on the door, pleading with me. \u201cKit, please! You\u2019ve got it all wrong.\u201d I back away from the door, unsure what to do next. I need a phone to call Detective Vick, peroxide and a Band-Aid for my hand, and to find my father, so I can finally reveal the truth about my mother\u2019s death. I head to the living room, expecting to find my father in his La-Z-Boy, waiting up for me like he did when I was a teenager. Only his chair is empty. As is the living room. And, it seems, the whole house. \u201cDad?\u201d I move down the hall, to the bedroom he once shared with my mother but now sleeps in alone. Peeking through the doorway, I spot a suitcase on the bed. One that doesn\u2019t belong to him. It\u2019s smaller than his battered suitcase, which I remember from so many family vacations. Nicer, too. Quality leather as dark as brandy. Its single flaw is a broken handle, which dangles from the suitcase, held on at only one end. My vision narrows, darkness pushing in from all sides until it looks like I\u2019m staring down a train tunnel. But there\u2019s no light at the end of it. Only confusion as I zero in on the suitcase\u2019s lid. My hand shakes so hard I can barely lift it open. When I do, I see a test tube with blood inside it and a stack of typewritten pages. I scan the first line of the top one. The thing I remember most--the thing I still have nightmares about--is when it was all but over. A sob croaks out of me. I can\u2019t hear it because my pounding heart is loud in my ears. A shock. I\u2019m so heartbroken I\u2019m surprised it can even beat at all. Because I know what my father did to get this suitcase. And I know why. All my life I\u2019d only heard him referred to as Pat. But his real name is Patrick. Patrick McDeere. It didn\u2019t occur to me that the second half of his name could also be turned into a different nickname. Ricky. \n Ricky sat in one of the leather chairs next to the fireplace. My father stood beside the other one, his back toward the door. Neither one of them noticed me as I crept into the room, the glinting knife in my grip leading the way. They only became aware of my presence once I said, \u201cWhere\u2019s my baby?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s gone, Virginia,\u201d my father said with his back still to me, as if I wasn\u2019t even worth the effort of turning around. \u201cBring him back.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s too late for that, my darling.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d I snapped, my hand tightening around the knife. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare call me that ever again! Now tell me what happened to my son.\u201d \u201cMiss Baker took him. She won\u2019t be returning.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cThat she\u2019s gone for good.\u201d My father said it like it was the most reasonable thing in the world. \u201cShe agreed to leave Hope\u2019s End with the child, find it a good home, and never speak of the incident again.\u201d A hot and stinging jolt of pain went through me. It was, I realized, the pain of betrayal. I felt so stupid then. So utterly foolish that I had deemed Miss Baker worthy of trust when all she truly cared about was herself. \u201cFor how much?\u201d I said, for I knew there was a price. \u201cNot as much as Patrick here.\u201d My father looked at Ricky. \u201cI did get the name right, didn\u2019t I? Patrick McDeere?\u201d Ricky swallowed hard and nodded. \u201cFor fifty thousand dollars, Mr. McDeere will leave, never return, and never speak of his bastard child. Isn\u2019t that right, son?\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Ricky mumbled, refusing to look at me. \u201cYou made him agree to this,\u201d I said to my father. To Ricky, I added, \u201cTell him no.\u201d At last, my father turned around, his gaze bouncing from one part of me to another. My crestfallen face first, then to my hand, where the knife remained. \u201cNow, look here, Virginia,\u201d my father said as he continued to stare at the knife. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201d I kept my own gaze on Ricky. \u201cTell him! Tell him you love me and that we\u2019re going to run away and find our baby and have a happy family.\u201d \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t want that,\u201d my father said. \u201cDo you, son?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d I turned to Ricky. \u201cTell me he\u2019s lying!\u201d Ricky\u2019s gaze also skipped about. To the unlit fireplace, to his hands, to the zebra rug under his feet. Anywhere but at me. \u201cIt\u2019s true, Ginny,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u201cSee?\u201d My father\u2019s tone was shockingly boastful. He was, I realized, enjoying the worst moment of my life. \u201cI know you\u2019re hurt now, but it\u2019s for the best. You don\u2019t want trash like him dragging you down for the rest of your life.\u201d \u201cBut--\u201d It was all I could muster. Shock and heartbreak had silenced me. But I knew I could still speak volumes with the knife in my hand. I tried to rush at both of them, not caring which one I hurt just as long as I inflicted pain on someone. But before I could take a step, I was halted by a gentle grip on the arm that held the knife. My mother. No doubt summoned by my sister. Although I was surprised to see her out of bed and walking around on her own, my mother barely seemed fazed by the sight of me holding a knife. Alert for the first time in weeks, she knew exactly what was transpiring in that billiard room. \u201cDon\u2019t, my darling,\u201d she said, her hands disconcertingly strong as she wrested the knife from my grip. \u201cThey\u2019re not worth destroying your young life over.\u201d I let her take the knife from my hand and collapsed against her, weeping. With the knife in one hand and stroking my hair with the other, she addressed my father. \u201cFifty thousand dollars, Winston? Your price has gone up. If I recall, you only offered twenty-five thousand to make the man I loved go away.\u201d \u201cThat didn\u2019t stop him from taking it,\u201d my father said with not an ounce of softness in his voice. \u201cYou can judge me for it all you want--and you certainly have--but it was the best thing to happen to you. It allowed you to get married, pretend that Lenora was my child, and keep your precious reputation intact.\u201d His words caused something inside my mother to break. I watched it happen. Her eyes went dark and her body still. Standing silent and motionless, she reminded me of a clock unnervingly stopped at midnight. Yet one small part of her continued to tick. I saw that, too. Something coiled around the gears of her mind, ready to spring. And spring she did. Toward my father. Knife in hand. Not stopping until the blade was deep in his side. My father didn\u2019t scream when the knife plunged into him. I did that for him, letting out a sharp cry that pinged around the room in an infernal echo. I could still hear it when my mother yanked the knife from my father\u2019s gut. He clutched at the wound, blood seeping between his fingers as he stumbled against the pool table. \u201cPlease take my daughter out of the room,\u201d my mother said to Ricky in a voice as calm as a spring morn. \u201cNow.\u201d Ricky leapt from the chair and took me by the hand, although the last thing I wanted was to feel his touch. Yet I was too stunned and horrified to do anything but let him pull me from the room, into the hallway, and toward the foyer. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream, right?\u201d I said, more to myself than to Ricky. \u201cJust a terrible dream.\u201d Yet the waking nightmare continued as a grunt and a gurgle sounded from the billiard room. My mother emerged a few moments later, still holding the now-crimson knife. Blood covered her nightgown and dripped from her hands in large dollops that fell across the foyer floor. I pulled myself from Ricky\u2019s grasp and ran up the Grand Stairs, wanting nothing more than to be upstairs in bed, fast asleep, waking up to a new day in which none of this had happened. My mother took a few shuffling steps, moving as if in a daze. Perhaps she thought it was a dream as well. A horrible, terrible, blood-drenched dream. But as my mother climbed the steps to join Ricky on the landing, I saw it was all too real--and that the blood covering her wasn\u2019t just my father\u2019s. It was also her own. A tear in the fabric of her nightgown revealed a gushing wound in her stomach. The moment I saw it, I knew my mother had also used the knife on herself. \u201cMother!\u201d I cried as I started to run back down the stairs. Ricky, still on the landing, halted me with a gruff \u201cDon\u2019t come any closer, Ginny!\u201d I stopped halfway to the landing, frozen by confusion and fear. I watched as Ricky approached my mother and took the blood-soaked knife from her hands. \u201cPlease,\u201d my mother whispered to him. \u201cPlease put an end to my misery.\u201d Ricky shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I mean,\u201d my mother snapped. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me. You don\u2019t know how much I\u2019ve suffered. You wouldn\u2019t, of course. You\u2019re just a shiftless, worthless cad who will amount to nothing.\u201d My mother\u2019s eyes contained a determined spark that worried me. I knew what she was trying to do--and that Ricky was falling for it. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about me like that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy?\u201d my mother said. \u201cIt\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it? You come from nothing, you\u2019ll live with nothing, and you\u2019ll die with nothing. You\u2019re worthless.\u201d Ricky stiffened, his body coiled with tension. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d \u201cThen prove it,\u201d my mother said. \u201cBe a man for once and prove you\u2019re not a piece of--\u201d From the stairs, I screamed as I saw a flash of movement at Ricky\u2019s hand. The knife. The rest happened so quickly I can scarcely recall it. A small mercy. What I do remember--the sound of the knife entering my mother\u2019s torso, her collapsing on the landing--is horrible enough. When it was over, I flew down the stairs to my mother\u2019s side. It was clear she was mortally wounded. Her face had become stark white, and there was blood everywhere. It soaked into my nightgown as I screamed at Ricky to call for help. \u201cHelp us! Please!\u201d The knife remained in Ricky\u2019s grip. He stared at it in disbelief for a moment before looking directly at me and my dying mother. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to--\u201d \u201cGet out,\u201d I said, my voice a ragged whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s true, Ginny. You have to believe me.\u201d \u201cGet out!\u201d I said again, this time in a roar borne of pain, anger, and fear. Ricky dropped the knife and fled out the front door and into the dark night. A minute after he left, so, too, did my mother. I was holding her hand when I felt the last flicker of her pulse. I kept holding it even as the skin grew cold, not knowing what else to do. My parents were dead. My child was gone. The man I had once loved but didn\u2019t any longer had fled. How is one supposed to carry on when they have nothing left? The only thing that pulled me away from my mother\u2019s corpse was the knife that killed her. Still on the foyer floor, it caught the light in a way that felt like a taunt. \u201cUse me,\u201d it seemed to say. \u201cThat\u2019s what you need to do now. Here\u2019s your way out.\u201d I went to it, picked it up, and considered driving it into my heart. I stopped myself before I could do so, worried that once the blade entered my chest, there\u2019d be no heart left for it to pierce. Instead, I walked out to the terrace, buffeted by the wind and driving rain, and threw the knife into the ocean. Something capable of such violence deserved to be in a place where no one could find it. Yet I still wanted to end my life. No, that\u2019s not quite it. I felt like I had to end my life. To me, it already seemed over. All those hopes and dreams I\u2019d held close to my heart had gone with everything else. In their place was a dark void from which I never thought I\u2019d escape. My body might have been alive, but my soul was dead. The quickest and easiest thing to do would have been throwing myself off the terrace. But then I\u2019d be as lost as the knife I\u2019d just tossed into the waves. I wanted to be found, so people would understand the depths of my despair. I decided to go to the garage, where I knew rope was stored. I grabbed a long loop of it and carried it back inside, to the ballroom. I chose that room because it seemed the most like myself. Lovely, yes, but also empty and neglected. In the kitchen, I heard Lenora on the phone, frantically calling the police. I should have considered how the night\u2019s events would affect her. They were her parents, too. At least my mother was. And I was her sister. Yet I selfishly never stopped to think if she would mourn them or me. The same went for Archie, who I knew would miss me deeply. All thoughts were pushed out of my head as I stood on a chair and tossed the rope until it was looped several times around one of the chandelier\u2019s arms. I then knotted it around my neck the best I could. After a tug to make sure the rope wouldn\u2019t unravel from the chandelier, I closed my eyes, took what I thought would be my last breath, and stepped off the chair. And that\u2019s the full story, Mary. Not what you expected, is it? It isn\u2019t for me, as well. Now that you have it, do with it what you\u2019d like. Tell the world. Or tell no one. It\u2019s in your hands now. My hope, though, is that you\u2019ll share it with someone, that it will spread far and wide, and that word of it will somehow reach my son, wherever he is, and the two of us may be briefly reunited. \n FORTY-TWO Tears fill my eyes, making it hard to see as I drive back to Hope\u2019s End. I tighten my grip on the steering wheel, as if that will make up for my blurry vision. I briefly consider not trying to see at all. That way maybe I\u2019ll veer off the road and go sailing over the cliff into the ocean, thereby having to avoid confronting my father. A tempting prospect, considering everything I now know. But that would make me just like Virginia. Attempting to kill myself over something my father has done. She survived. I intend to do the same. I have no plan for what to do when I reach Hope\u2019s End. I\u2019m not even certain that\u2019s where my father went, although in all likelihood it is. On the phone, I gave away that Virginia was alive, accidentally leading him right to her. I wipe my eyes, grip the steering wheel tighter, and press down harder on the gas pedal, taking my rattling Escort ever higher into the Cliffs. As I drive, I continue to keep an eye out for Carter, just in case he decided to make the long trek back to Hope\u2019s End on foot. Once the initial shock of realizing my father had killed Mary passed, I ran to the front door, hoping to still find him there. But Carter was gone. The fact that I was wrong about him, going so far as to force him out of the car, is one of my more regrettable actions tonight. Another thing I regret is speed-reading the typed pages I found in Mary\u2019s suitcase. So much more than what Virginia and I had managed to type. This was indeed the full story. One that I couldn\u2019t stop reading even as it made me dizzy with grief. Now I understand why Virginia had been so reluctant to reveal all of it. She didn\u2019t want to be the one to tell me who my father was. And what he\u2019d done. Getting Virginia pregnant. Accepting a payment to go away forever from Winston Hope. Stabbing Evangeline Hope out of a combination of anger and pity. Killing Mary because she knew all of this. That\u2019s the hardest part to contend with\u2014the fact that he\u2019s still capable of murder. I can\u2019t stop picturing him in the shadow of the mansion, waiting, striking the moment he saw Mary creeping across the terrace. I know she\u2019d been on her way to see Carter, because of the vial of Virginia\u2019s blood I also found in the suitcase. My father grabbed it, gave Mary a shove, and watched as she flipped over the railing and fell into the abyss beyond it. I fear Virginia will be his next victim. Especially after I reach Hope\u2019s End and see my father\u2019s pickup truck parked next to the still-open gate. Why he would choose to make the remainder of the journey on foot isn\u2019t lost on me. All the better to sneak up to the house undetected, which is likely what he did the night he killed Mary. I, having no reason to arrive quietly, keep driving. Past the gate. Down the drive. To the front door of Hope\u2019s End, where Archie stands caught in the car\u2019s headlights like an actor on a stage. Relief floods his features when he sees me climb out of the car. \u201cSomeone\u2019s here,\u201d he says in an urgent whisper. \u201cI saw him walking up the driveway.\u201d \u201cDo you know where he is now?\u201d Archie shakes his head. \u201cWell, I know where he\u2019s going,\u201d I say. \u201cWho is it?\u201d \u201cRicky.\u201d I pause, wary of giving him the same information overload I\u2019ve experienced multiple times tonight. \u201cWho\u2019s also my father.\u201d Before Archie can react, I press my car keys into his hand. \u201cDrive into town. Go to the police and ask for Detective Vick. He\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d \u201cBut what about you?\u201d I start walking up the steps to the front door. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I\u2019m not afraid my father will do me harm. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d go to such an extreme. Besides, other than killing me, he can\u2019t hurt me more than he already has. It\u2019s Virginia I\u2019m worried about. She\u2019s utterly helpless\u2014and the only loose end he needs to tie up. My plan, formed on the spot, is to make sure Virginia\u2019s safe and then distract my father from hurting her long enough for Detective Vick to show up. As Archie drives away in my car, I push inside Hope\u2019s End, where Virginia\u2019s past and my present are about to collide. Standing in the foyer, I search for signs of my father. He could be anywhere, including still outside. Nevertheless, I can feel his presence. A shadow version of himself, repeating his actions from fifty-four years ago. Standing right where I\u2019m standing. Simmering with humiliation and shame and rage. Plunging the knife into Evangeline Hope. It\u2019s so vivid I can almost hear it, as if the horrible sound has been echoing through the foyer since 1929. What I don\u2019t hear are any noises from the present day. No footsteps or floor creaks. That might be a good thing. It could also mean I\u2019m too late. That thought propels me down the hall to the kitchen and the service stairs. I can\u2019t bear the thought of taking the Grand Stairs, with their bloodstains that my father caused. Not that the service stairs are any better. They groan under my feet as I ascend, sounding like they could collapse at any moment. A distinct possibility. At the top of the stairs, I instantly feel the extreme pitch of the house. In the short time I\u2019ve been away, it\u2019s only gotten worse. I creep down the hallway, leaning into the tilt. As I go, I reach into my pocket and pull out the corkscrew. An act that boggles my mind. This is my father. The man who raised me. I can\u2019t imagine needing to protect myself from him. Yet, under the circumstances, it feels necessary. Rather than head into Virginia\u2019s room, I duck into mine, startled by how different it feels. The floor is noticeably more slanted, forcing me to think twice before each step. On my way to the adjoining door, I notice the mattress bunched at the foot of the bed. A couple of books have fallen from the shelf and the mirror hanging on the wall appears tilted when in reality it\u2019s the rest of the room that\u2019s askew. The door to Virginia\u2019s room is shut. Whether it\u2019s the work of my father or the ever-shifting house remains to be seen. Gripping the corkscrew tight, I crack open the door and peek inside. The room is dim, lit only by moonlight coming through windows leaning precariously closer to the sea. In that muted light, I see Virginia in her bed, awake and alert. I rush to her side and whisper, \u201cMy father\u2019s on his way.\u201d She knows I\u2019m talking about Ricky. She\u2019s known since our first meeting, when she barely registered my presence until I told her my full name. That\u2019s when she finally snapped to attention. \u201cI\u2019m going to get you out of here.\u201d I set the corkscrew on Virginia\u2019s nightstand and fetch her wheelchair from the corner. While it would be quicker to lift her out of bed and carry her down the stairs, I know my limitations. Wheeling her down the Grand Stairs the same way I did during our ill-fated trip outside is the only option. Lifting her by the underarms, I manage to get her out of bed and halfway to the wheelchair before I hear a noise in the hallway. Virginia hears it, too, and flashes a startled, stricken look. We both recognize the sound. Footsteps. Coming up the service stairs. Slowly. Uncertainly. The moment I hear them, I know they belong to my father. For a second, I\u2019m frozen. I don\u2019t know what to do. Even if I get Virginia into the wheelchair before my father enters the room, he\u2019ll surely spot us as I try to wheel her out. But staying where we are is also a bad idea. Holding Virginia upright, I can\u2019t do anything to protect her or me. Her life is literally in my hands. Virginia nods toward the far corner of the room, in a pitch-black space between the wall and the divan. Although barely enough space for Virginia to fit, it might be enough to hide her if my father merely peeks into the room and moves on. Also, with his footsteps getting louder on the creaking service stairs, it\u2019s our only option. I drag Virginia to the space by the wall and drop her into it. Then I sprint for my own hiding place\u2014my bedroom. There I huddle in a shadow-filled corner, hoping it, too, is enough to keep me hidden. Through the open doorway, I can see Virginia on the floor next to the divan. Also in shadow, but not very hidden. Not very hidden at all. I hear a noise from the hall, just beyond my bedroom door. My father, passing on his way to Virginia\u2019s room. Of course he knows where it\u2019s located. He\u2019s been here before. When he eventually does enter her room, I have to clamp a hand over my mouth to keep from crying out. All this time I\u2019d secretly hoped I was wrong, that it wasn\u2019t him, that despite Mary\u2019s suitcase and those typed pages, it couldn\u2019t possibly be true. But his presence erases all doubt. My father finds Virginia immediately. It\u2019s not hard. Her legs, incapable of moving on their own, jut from the dark corner into which she\u2019d been dropped. \u201cHey, Ginny,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d His voice is calm, warm, flirting with amusement. The voice of a man seeing a long-lost love. Under different circumstances, it could almost be considered romantic. Right now, though, it\u2019s chilling. \u201cLet\u2019s get you off the floor,\u201d he says. My father bends down, lifts Virginia into his arms, and carries her to the bed. He did the same thing for my mother in her waning days, gently moving her from the living room sofa to their bedroom. Watching him do it now with Virginia cracks my heart wide open. Making it worse is the knowledge that such tenderness comes from a man also capable of horrible deeds. \u201cYou still know how to surprise a fella, Ginny,\u201d he says as he places her on the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you that.\u201d My father eases himself onto the edge of the bed and, to my surprise, takes Virginia\u2019s hand in his. Her right. I hold my breath, waiting for him to tell me he knows I\u2019m here and that I should emerge from the dark. Instead, he talks only to Virginia. \u201cAll those years I thought you were dead. Hung with a rope. Isn\u2019t that how it goes? Now, unlike everyone else, I knew Lenora didn\u2019t do it. I knew you\u2019d done it to yourself. Either way, you were dead all the same. That\u2019s why I never left town. I never felt the need to hide. I certainly didn\u2019t think I had to worry about you telling anyone what really happened. So I stayed. Started my own business. Met a wonderful woman. Had a daughter.\u201d My blood runs cold as he says it. He knows I\u2019m here. Now he\u2019s reminding me whose side I\u2019m supposed to be on. \u201cI felt bad about what happened,\u201d he tells Virginia. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I did love you. At least, I thought I did. And I intended to do right by you. But we were so young, and I was so scared. When your father told me the baby was gone and offered me that money, all I felt was relief. At last, there was a way out of the situation, even though I knew it would hurt you. And I do think about him sometimes. Our son. I think about him and hope he\u2019s happy. I don\u2019t think that would have happened if we\u2019d stayed together. It wouldn\u2019t have lasted, Ginny. We were too different.\u201d My father gives Virginia\u2019s hand a gentle squeeze, as if to drive the point home. \u201cAs for your mother, I didn\u2019t mean to hurt her, Ginny. I swear. But something in me just snapped and I couldn\u2019t control it. I\u2019ve thought about that night a lot. Not a day goes by when I don\u2019t regret what I did. But I learned to live with it. And I knew that, as big of a mistake as it was, I wouldn\u2019t be punished for it. Then that nurse of yours came to the house asking if I\u2019d agree to a blood test.\u201d Somehow I manage to keep from gasping. It sits, bubble-like, at the back of my throat. I swallow it down as the realization that prompted it settles over me. Mary had been to our house. That\u2019s where she went that Sunday night. Not to the lab, but to see my father. While I was there. She was the woman I\u2019d heard talking to my father. Not a girlfriend he didn\u2019t want to tell me about. But Mary, bearing an even bigger secret. When I heard him sneak out the next night, he was actually on his way here. \u201cShe told me she knew that I\u2019d worked at Hope\u2019s End when I was sixteen,\u201d my father continues. \u201cShe knew I\u2019d had a relationship with Virginia Hope and that I was the father of her child, who was taken away but might have had a kid of his own who now wanted to know who his real grandparents were. That\u2019s when I realized you were still alive. The only person she could have learned all that from is you. God, you should have seen her. So smug. Acted like she was so smart. Yet she didn\u2019t know half of it.\u201d \u201cBut I know all of it.\u201d Unlike the gasp, I can\u2019t keep myself from saying it. I know too much to stay hidden and have heard too much to remain silent. Stepping from my room into Virginia\u2019s, I see my father\u2019s hands move to her neck and give a little squeeze. \u201cStop right there, Kit-Kat,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you. And I think you know that. But I will hurt her if you come any closer.\u201d The sight of his hands\u2014so large and so strong\u2014around Virginia\u2019s throat stops me cold. But I don\u2019t show fear. You can sense fear. He taught me that. \u201cNo one else needs to get hurt, Dad,\u201d I say. \u201cYou can end this.\u201d My father turns to me, revealing the same look I saw the morning that article about me appeared in the newspaper. Hurt and betrayal and shame. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can, Kit-Kat. I\u2019m in too deep now.\u201d \u201cWhy did you kill Mary? If she didn\u2019t know everything, why kill her?\u201d \u201cBecause she knew enough. Not the part about the murders. If she did, she didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d My father turns back to Virginia. \u201cYou finished the rest of the story when she came back after asking me to take a blood test. I know because I read about it later. All those pages you typed? I read them all. You really are a good writer, Ginny. You had promise. But you shouldn\u2019t have told her everything. You shouldn\u2019t have told her my goddamn name. But even before that, I knew she was a liability. So I said I\u2019d do her stupid little blood test. But not at the house. Not with my daughter around. I told her I\u2019d come here, to Hope\u2019s End, late the next night and that she should leave the gate open. Then I waited in the same spot I first met you, Ginny. When I saw Mary hurrying across the terrace with that suitcase, I did what I had to do.\u201d \u201cAnd now?\u201d I say. \u201cWhat do you plan to do now?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d my father says, even as his hands tighten around Virginia\u2019s neck. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cThen stop, Dad. Please.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d My father begins to squeeze her throat. \u201cI can\u2019t risk her telling anyone else.\u201d \u201cShe won\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cShe can\u2019t.\u201d My father ignores me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ginny,\u201d he whispers as Virginia\u2019s eyes bulge and wet, choking sounds push out of her throat. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \u201cDad, stop!\u201d I throw myself at him, trying to get him to stop. Even at age seventy, he\u2019s strong enough to shove me away with one arm. I stagger backward into Virginia\u2019s wheelchair, both of us toppling. Sprawled on the floor, I see my father return both hands to Virginia\u2019s neck. Tightening. Squeezing. Then I notice Virginia\u2019s hands. The right one sits on the bed, immobile. The left one holds the corkscrew, which she grabbed from the nightstand. With as much strength as she can muster, Virginia swings it toward my father, the corkscrew slicing the air before jabbing directly into the side of his stomach. My father yelps in pain as his hands drop from Virginia\u2019s throat. He looks down at his side, where the corkscrew juts from his torso. A dark spot surrounds it as blood seeps into his shirt. Before he can grab it, I\u2019m on my feet, reaching out, snagging the handle. I pull and the corkscrew slides out of his flesh with a squelch of blood. Brandishing it like a switchblade, I say, \u201cDon\u2019t touch her again.\u201d My father presses a hand to the wound. He\u2019s hurt, but not badly. He even lets out a rueful chuckle. \u201cI guess I deserve this.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d I say, shocked by how a single syllable can contain six months of bitterness and disappointment. \u201cIf I\u2019d been a better father, you wouldn\u2019t have come here. You wouldn\u2019t have met Ginny. You wouldn\u2019t know about any of this.\u201d \u201cYou pushed me away.\u201d I try to keep my sorrow hidden, but it shows itself anyway, cracking my voice with emotion. \u201cI needed you, Dad. When Mom died, I fucking needed you! Because what happened with Mom was awful. But\u2014\u201d I stop myself, unsure if I can speak the words that need to be said. Even now. Even here. \u201cBut you were right to doubt me. I left those pills out. Even though Mom swore she\u2019d only take one, I knew there was a possibility she\u2019d take them all.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d my father says. \u201cDon\u2019t say that, Kit-Kat.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s true.\u201d \u201cNo. You shouldn\u2019t blame yourself. It\u2019s my fault that you do. I shouldn\u2019t have put that burden on you. I shouldn\u2019t have let it get that far. I should have come forward and stopped the whole thing as soon as that article about you hit the newspaper.\u201d Suddenly, I\u2019m no longer at Hope\u2019s End. The whole cursed place disappears from my vision as I flash back to home, my father at the kitchen table, newspaper in hand. He looks up at me with watery eyes and says, \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying\u2019s not true, Kit-Kat.\u201d He didn\u2019t say that because he wanted it to be the truth. My father said it because it was true. He knew I hadn\u2019t given my mother those pills. Because he\u2019s the one who did it. \n FORTY-THREE Shock and despair. That\u2019s all I feel. Not anger. Not grief. Just those two extremes of shock and despair, feeding off each other, turning into an emotion I can\u2019t describe because I\u2019ve never felt it before and I pray that no one else is forced to experience it. It feels like every part of me\u2014brain, heart, lungs\u2014has been ripped from my body, leaving me hollow. That I remain standing is a miracle. I can\u2019t think. I can\u2019t speak. I can\u2019t move. My father, still blessed with all those qualities, steps toward me, arms outstretched, as if he wants to embrace me but knows I\u2019ll shatter if he does. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kit-Kat,\u201d he says. \u201cI know you wanted more time with her. I did, too. But she was suffering so much. All that pain. I understood why you left those pills out for her. Because you couldn\u2019t take any more of her suffering. None of us could. So I decided to end it.\u201d I don\u2019t want to listen. Yet despite all the functions currently failing me, hearing is the only one left. I have no choice but to take in every word he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t force the pills on your mother. She took them willingly. We both knew it was better that way. What I didn\u2019t intend\u2014what neither of us intended\u2014was for you to be blamed for it. When that happened, I didn\u2019t know what to do. But believe me when I say I wasn\u2019t going to let Richard Vick arrest you, Kit-Kat. I vowed to turn myself in if it came to that. But it never did. So I stayed quiet, because I knew you\u2019d hate me if you ever found out.\u201d I do hate him. Finally, a third emotion, one that eclipses my shock and despair. Those fade to background noise as the hatred takes over. But it\u2019s a wounded sort of hate. Raw and burning. Like I\u2019m the one who\u2019s just been stabbed. I can\u2019t tell what hurts more\u2014that he and my mother decided to end her life without telling me, thereby denying me a chance to say goodbye, or the fact that he stayed silent when the police came for me, when I was investigated by the state, when I was suspended from my job. \u201cThat\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t talk to you afterward,\u201d my father says. \u201cIt was too hard to look you in the eyes, knowing what I did, knowing I was the cause of your suffering.\u201d Somehow, I find my voice. \u201cYet you refused to stop it. You just let everyone think I killed my mother. Worse, you let me think that.\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d my father says. \u201cI was wrong.\u201d He takes another step toward me, wincing as he touches his side. At any other moment, my caregiving instincts would kick in. I\u2019d check the wound, try to clean it, find something to stop the bleeding. But I remain stock-still. His wound is nothing compared to mine. I might have remained like that forever if not for a sound coming from the hallway. A sharp clack as Lenora Hope finishes loading her shotgun before stepping into the bedroom. Upon hearing it, my father raises his hands and turns to face her. \u201cHello, Lenora,\u201d he says. Lenora levels the shotgun barrel at his chest. \u201cWho are you? Why are you here?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Patrick.\u201d Unlike me, Lenora easily matches my father\u2019s name with the boy her sister had loved all those years ago. It even dawns on her, decades too late, that he and not Virginia is responsible for at least some of the violence that claimed the lives of her parents. \u201cIt was you,\u201d she says. My father responds with a curt nod. \u201cMostly, yes.\u201d \u201cGive me one reason not to shoot you dead right now.\u201d \u201cBecause my daughter shouldn\u2019t be here to see it,\u201d my father says as he jerks his head in my direction. Lenora looks to me, astonished. \u201cDid you know?\u201d I shake my head. As Lenora watches me do it, the barrel of the shotgun drifts away from my father to the floor. Sensing an opportunity, my father lunges forward and shoves Lenora into the hallway. \u201cNo!\u201d I scream, not knowing which of them I\u2019m actually screaming at. I do it again, even though they ignore me, too intent on destroying each other. I can only run into the hallway while continuing to scream as it all unfolds like a slow-motion car crash in front of me. My father rushing Lenora. Smashing into her. The barrel of the shotgun moving, tilting, firing. There\u2019s a blast of heat and noise as the gun goes off. A chunk of the wall behind my father explodes, spraying plaster, wood, and wallpaper. He and Lenora continue to collide, edging closer to the top of the Grand Stairs. My father stops. Lenora doesn\u2019t. She falls onto her back, the shotgun leaving her hands as she shudders down the steps and does a single flip onto the landing. I push past my father and start down the Grand Stairs, stopping after only a few steps because I notice something strange. The entire staircase is trembling. As is the entire house. I look around, suddenly terrified. The light fixture in the foyer sways back and forth. From above come several thuds as furniture on the third floor topples over. From below, the earth lets out a low groan, like a beast about to wake. Hearing it, I know in my gut it\u2019ll only be a matter of time\u2014minutes, maybe even seconds\u2014before it does. When that happens, all of Hope\u2019s End will come tumbling down. \u201cGet out of the house!\u201d I call to Lenora. \u201cI\u2019m going to get Virginia.\u201d I start back up the stairs. They\u2019re shaking so hard I can no longer stand and must crawl up them. I continue crawling when I reach the second floor, scrambling past my father. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he says, shouting to be heard over the steadily building groan of the earth and the thumping, shaking clatter it creates. \u201cSaving Virginia!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s not enough time!\u201d My father grabs me by the shoulders. I writhe in his grasp. \u201cThere is if you help me!\u201d We lock eyes, a lifetime of guilt and regret passing between us, unspoken yet keenly felt. \u201cPlease,\u201d I say. \u201cYou owe me. You owe her.\u201d My father blinks, as if snapping from a trance. Then he releases me and, without another word, rushes to Virginia\u2019s room. I follow him inside, where the room rattles like a broken carnival ride. The tilt, often felt but rarely seen, is now a memory. In its place is a full-on slant that turns the room into an obstacle course. All around us, furniture has started to slide toward the windows, including the bed Virginia still lies upon. My father grabs her shoulders. I take her legs. Together, we lift and carry her out of the room as the entire house pitches. Behind me, I hear the empty bed skid across the floor and thunk into the wall. In the hallway, vases on pedestals crash to the floor and paintings on the walls sway. Outside there\u2019s a cacophony of bricks raining onto the roof and terrace as, one by one, the chimneys of Hope\u2019s End collapse. My father and I hurry down the Grand Stairs, trying not to drop Virginia as the steps themselves buck and sway. On the landing, my father hoists her onto his shoulder, freeing my hands to help Lenora. She refuses to move. \u201cWe need to go!\u201d I shout. \u201cNow!\u201d Lenora shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving.\u201d Her reply is so nonsensical that at first I think it\u2019s a joke, even though there\u2019s nothing remotely funny about the fact that Hope\u2019s End is collapsing all around us. But when Lenora makes no effort to join me at the doorway, I realize she\u2019s dead serious. \u201cI can\u2019t leave this place,\u201d she says. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cLenora, listen to me,\u201d I say, gripping her shoulders and trying to shake some sense into her. \u201cYou\u2019ll die if you stay here.\u201d A waste of time, words, and breath. She already knows this. \u201cI had my time away from this place. Now it\u2019s Virginia\u2019s turn.\u201d Lenora touches my hand and gives me a sad smile. \u201cShe\u2019s waited long enough. Take good care of her, Kit.\u201d With a light shove, Lenora Hope sends me away before I can respond. There\u2019s no time for it. I only have enough time to run down the Grand Stairs, skip over the fissures zigzagging across the foyer floor, and join my father and Virginia outside. He carries her until we reach a place where the ground no longer shakes under our feet. There, my father lowers Virginia onto the grass. I join her, checking for signs of injury. Shockingly, other than the wound on my father\u2019s side, all three of us have made it out unscathed. I reach for his shirt and say, \u201cHow bad are you hurt?\u201d My father pushes my hand away, gently, slowly, as if savoring the touch. \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl, Kit-Kat,\u201d he says before kissing me on the cheek. \u201cYou always have been. I should have told you that more. I regret that now. I regret a lot of things. But you? You\u2019ve always been my pride and joy.\u201d Then my father turns back to the house and enters without hesitation. I lurch forward, ready to run in after him, but Virginia grasps my wrist, clinging to it, reminding me she\u2019s still in my care. All I can do is scream for my father to come back as, through the still-open doors, I watch him join Lenora on the Grand Stairs. They don\u2019t look at each other, nor do they reach out for comfort. They merely sit. As chunks of ceiling fall around them. As the stained-glass window over the landing shatters from the strain. As the entire house shudders through its final death rattle. The last I see of them is my father and Lenora finally clasping hands as the front doors swing shut. Then, amid a chorus of groans, creaks, and ear-splitting pops, Hope\u2019s End follows the collapsing cliff and slides into the ocean. \n FORTY-FOUR Music drifts out of Virginia\u2019s room. The Go-Go\u2019s, which she likes more than I thought she would. Or maybe it\u2019s just the novelty she enjoys. Denied most modern technology for so long, she thrills at all the things I\u2019ve had for years and therefore take for granted. My boom box being the chief one. Most days, it plays nonstop. But also television, which left Virginia awestruck the first time I turned it on. She spent the whole night delighted by whatever was being broadcast. She was the same way when I took her to see Return of the Jedi, even though neither of us understood what the hell was going on. We simply enjoyed the spectacle. I pause in the doorway of Virginia\u2019s new bedroom. Once my room, it bears no resemblance to the place where I grew up. Archie and Kenny helped me remove the ugly floral wallpaper and paint the walls a soothing shade of lavender. All my old furniture is gone, replaced with things more appropriate for Virginia\u2019s needs. A new Hoyer lift. A modern wheelchair. A bed donated by the local hospital that Virginia can raise and lower with the left-handed press of a button. I\u2019ve moved into my parents\u2019 old bedroom. A change I wasn\u2019t quite prepared for. Those first few nights, it felt strange to be sleeping on the other side of the hallway, in a bed and room larger than what I was familiar with. But I\u2019m getting used to it day by day. So far, I\u2019ve only had nightmares about my mother twice. There have been none about my father. I\u2019m hoping it stays that way. After what happened at Hope\u2019s End, there wasn\u2019t any question that Virginia would stay with me. I was still her caregiver, after all. Also, she had nowhere else to go. It was either here or a place like Ocean View Retirement Home. It was rough those first fraught days. Both of us were grieving. Virginia had lost her sister and the only home she\u2019d ever known. I\u2019d lost my father, my sole remaining parent, and the idea of the person I thought he was. Now that two months have passed, things have become slightly more bearable. It helps that Archie\u2019s still around, as supportive as ever. He got a job cooking at a fancy hotel two towns away and stops by every night after his shift to check in on us. Which is more than can be said for the rest of the people who had once lived at Hope\u2019s End. Jessie\u2019s all but disappeared, not bothering to reach out to us even after what happened made headlines around the world. As for Carter, well, he\u2019s been having trouble forgiving and forgetting. I can\u2019t blame him, really. I did, after all, accuse him of murder and leave him stranded with no way home. When he finally did get back to Hope\u2019s End, it was hours after the entire place was gone. What had once been his cottage was now part of a massive pile of rubble littering the Atlantic surf. I tried apologizing that night, and again a few weeks later when I entered the bar where he\u2019d started working part-time. He said he understood why I thought what I did. He even went so far as to say I was forgiven. But I could tell he didn\u2019t fully mean it. It was merely something he said because he wanted me to go away. So I did. He did, too, leaving town not long after that to search for his birth family. I wish him well. I hope he gets whatever closure he needs. I hope the same for me. Like Carter, I\u2019m having trouble with that whole forgiveness thing. Despite helping me save Virginia, I continue to hate my father for what he did, just as I hate myself for also still loving him. I now know Archie was right about being able to do both. I should ask him how he handled it when he stops by tonight. But for now, there\u2019s Virginia to focus on. Among her new belongings is an electric typewriter that she uses only sparingly, mostly as another way for us to communicate. So far, she\u2019s shown no sign of wanting to write any more of her story. I think she doesn\u2019t see the need now that everyone knows it. While the initial murders at Hope\u2019s End were upstaged by a historic market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression, the media made a point of not letting it happen a second time. Coverage of the mansion\u2019s collapse, my father\u2019s guilt, and how a still-alive Virginia Hope lived under her sister\u2019s name for decades was everywhere. I still get the occasional phone call from a journalist asking to speak to Virginia. My standard reply is \u201cSorry, she can\u2019t talk right now.\u201d Yet there are days when I wish she could. I think it would help Virginia to be able to articulate how she feels about what happened to her. I can\u2019t imagine enduring everything she went through, from having her baby taken from her to seeing her mother killed by her lover to being hidden away by her very own sister. It makes my own trauma look like child\u2019s play. Right now, though, Virginia radiates nothing but happiness as she sits in her wheelchair, listening to the steady beat of the song that\u2019s playing. \u201cOur Lips Are Sealed.\u201d One of her favorites. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a quick shower,\u201d I tell her when she catches me watching. \u201cDo you need anything?\u201d Virginia replies with a single tap and goes back to listening to the music. I head to the bathroom to start my shower, turning on the water and waiting until it gets warm. That\u2019s when I\u2019m hit with the thought that always strikes while I\u2019m alone with nothing to do. Somewhere out there, I have a half brother. Maybe. There\u2019s no way of knowing if he\u2019s still alive. Or, if so, where he is. Or if he has a family of his own. Archie and I have started putting out feelers, trying to find out what happened to the real Miss Baker, hoping that information can lead us to Virginia\u2019s son and my half brother. We do it in secret, reluctant to tell Virginia out of fear it\u2019ll get her hopes up. So far, the secrecy\u2019s been justified. All we\u2019ve managed to learn is that Miss Baker got married sometime in 1930 and moved. Where, we don\u2019t know. The name of her husband is also unknown. For now, all we can do is wait and hope that more information comes our way. I think Virginia would like that. I would, too. Despite technically not being related, she\u2019s the only known family I have left. The Go-Go\u2019s are still playing when I get out of the shower. I hear the music echoing across the hall as I dry off and put on my uniform for the day. Jeans, comfy blouse, cardigan. No more nurse\u2019s whites for me. I cross the hall while using my fingers to comb my still-wet hair. \u201cHey, Virginia, what flavor oatmeal would you like for\u2014\u201d I freeze in the doorway. Although the music is playing and the wheelchair is right where I left it, Virginia herself is gone. I scan the room, stupidly, as if she\u2019s merely been misplaced and not completely missing from the room. By the front door is a table normally used for mail and car keys. On it sits a single sheet of paper bearing six typed lines. Holding my breath, I pick it up and begin to read. At sixty-nine, Virginia Hope Wrote her nurse this little note Thank you, dear, for saving me Now it\u2019s time to let you be I take my leave, walking tall Knowing that I fooled them all \n My dearest Kit, I hope you\u2019re not surprised to receive this letter. I hope you knew, deep down in your heart, that I would contact you again. Leaving you the way I did was for the best, you see, even though I hated doing it. But I was afraid of how you\u2019d react once you learned the truth. Then again, you always suspected I was capable of more than I let on. To most people, my silence and stillness rendered me almost invisible. But you, Kit, saw me. And now you know the truth. I can walk, talk, and use my whole body. Right now, I bet you\u2019re wondering why I spent such a long time pretending I couldn\u2019t. The reasons are many, beginning with the simple fact that at first I had no desire to move. I was as surprised as anyone when I survived my suicide attempt. And disappointed as well. Despite a miracle occurring, I still wished I were dead. I longed for it. I wanted the sweet relief of death so badly that I pretended I truly had died. I simply lay there, not moving, trying not to breathe. Stupid as he was, Dr. Walden might not have been entirely off base with his diagnosis. For something was indeed wrong with me, although I\u2019m still unsure if it was physical, mental, or emotional. Perhaps it was a combination of all three, which rendered me paralyzed even though I technically wasn\u2019t. All I know is that I felt lifeless, mute, and immobile. And so that\u2019s how I stayed. I might have remained that way forever if it hadn\u2019t been for Archie, who refused to leave my side. \u201cYou\u2019ll get better one day, Ginny,\u201d he often whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sure of it. And when you do, we\u2019ll find your son.\u201d That got me wondering if he was right and that it was possible to one day find my little boy. The more I thought about it, the more I felt a spark of the old me still burning inside. Without letting Archie know, I began the drawn-out task of forcing my body to start working again. It began with a wiggle of the fingers on my left hand and ended many, many years later with me walking around my room in secret. I suspect the first question you have is: Why didn\u2019t I leave Hope\u2019s End then? I wanted to. I wanted so many things. To travel. To run and dance and sing. To raise the child who was so cruelly stolen from me. But I was frightened of what was beyond Hope\u2019s End. I knew the world had changed greatly since my youth. I feared that if I were to leave, I wouldn\u2019t recognize it. But Hope\u2019s End was familiar, and I took solace in that familiarity. Even a prison becomes comforting if it\u2019s the only thing you know. The second question I bet you\u2019re asking yourself right now is: Why didn\u2019t I tell at least Archie that I could move, walk, talk? The answer to that is slightly more selfish. I didn\u2019t tell him because I feared my sister would find out if anyone else knew. And after she\u2019d returned from Europe, where she lived the kind of life I had long dreamed of, I wanted to punish her. That\u2019s the brutal truth of the matter. At first, I simply considered killing her. A murder for which I would have happily taken the blame. But death is quick. And I wanted her punishment to last a long, long time. So I made myself the burden she thought me to be. She assumed she was punishing me by keeping us both here. In truth, she was only punishing herself, and I enjoyed watching it. Think of it as a variation on the game my father forced us to play. I finally won. And the amount of time I chose to keep Lenora in her room was more than fifty years. But it wasn\u2019t just about animosity toward my sister. The main reason I stayed was because I wanted to be there in case my son ever decided to come looking for me. I feared that if I left, he\u2019d never know where I was and therefore would never be able to find me. The idea that we might one day be reunited was, to me, worth the wait. So I chose to continue to appear hopeless, even though I was capable of so much. Shockingly, not a single person noticed, including the many nurses I had before you arrived. So many that I\u2019ve forgotten most of their names and faces. I suspect I was just as forgettable to them, for very few ever paid me much mind. Yes, they performed the basic job of keeping me alive. But only a handful treated me like I was an actual human being. Someone with thoughts and feelings and curiosity. I suppose my silence played a small part in that. One can be easily ignored when one doesn\u2019t speak. And so I was. Of course, nearly all of those nurses were terrified of me. I can\u2019t blame them, really. I\u2019d be scared, too, based on all the rumors that have swirled around me. None of those previous nurses were interested in the truth. Even the ones who deemed me worthy of a little kindness or a bit of conversation. That all changed when Mary came along. Poor, sweet Mary. She\u2019s another person who saw me. Like you, she was curious. So much so that she bought that typewriter in the hope I\u2019d learn how to use it and eventually write my story. I did, as you well know. I only wish I\u2019d been able to do the same with you, Kit. You deserved to know the truth. Yet I couldn\u2019t bring myself to disappoint you with the news about your father. So I stalled, evaded, and misled, knowing it was inevitable that you\u2019d one day find out. I truly regret the way you did eventually learn the truth--and all the events that came after it. You didn\u2019t deserve that. The fact that you\u2019ve handled it so well speaks highly of your character. Around the same time Mary was teaching me how to type, something else extraordinary occurred. I was given an amazing device called a Walkman. With it was a cassette featuring a book read aloud by Jessie, the new maid at Hope\u2019s End. Although I did read in secret at night, it was nice to be able to enjoy a book out in the open, so to speak. I didn\u2019t care what the story was about. I just liked being told a good tale. Imagine my surprise when, halfway through that first cassette, the book stopped. One minute, I was listening to North and South by John Jakes. The next, Jessie\u2019s narration ended and regular talking began. \u201cListen, I know you\u2019re not Lenora Hope, but her sister, Virginia. I know a lot about you. More than anyone else, I think.\u201d And so it continued, a one-sided conversation between me and Jessie, conducted via the messages she slipped in between chapters. \u201cI don\u2019t think you killed your parents. And even if you did, from what I\u2019ve been told, they kind of had it coming. At least your father did.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t told Mary, but I\u2019m pretty sure you can move and possibly talk. I\u2019m curious to hear what your voice sounds like.\u201d Finally, the most important message came. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m your granddaughter.\u201d Jessie told me all about her father, who was named Marcel. He grew up in a loving home with Miss Baker and her husband. He played hockey, loved to read, and excelled at painting. After university, he got a job as a commercial artist in Toronto. He didn\u2019t get married until his thirties, when he met and fell in love with a fellow artist. They had one child, Jessie, and lived a happy life together, savoring every moment until Marcel passed away from illness in 1982. After his death, Jessie was told the truth about Marcel\u2019s parents by Miss Baker, a woman she had always known as Grandma. Undertaking a bit of detective work, Jessie found out Hope\u2019s End needed a maid and applied for the job. Her intention was to try to dig up information about who I was and if I\u2019d really killed my parents like everyone said. What she ended up finding was me. While I\u2019m sad to never have gotten the chance to meet my son, I know that life doesn\u2019t always grant you your greatest wish. But happiness can still sneak in, and now I am overjoyed to be able to know my granddaughter. The noises I\u2019m certain you heard during the night were Jessie, who would come to my room in the wee hours so we could whisper the ways in which we planned to escape. Plans that were derailed by Mary\u2019s murder, your arrival, and the eventual collapse of Hope\u2019s End. (Good riddance to that place, by the way!) Jessie also had to return to Canada when Miss Baker passed away. Another disappointment. I wish I had been able to thank Miss Baker for taking care of my son, even though he ended up being her child much more than he was ever mine. The day I disappeared from your house was the day Jessie came to my window. I let her inside and she quickly told me the new plan--leave immediately. So we left, hurrying to Jessie\u2019s car parked at the curb. Once we were inside, she handed me a forged passport with my real name on it. \u201cWhere do you want to go, Grandma?\u201d she said. I looked through the windshield, gazing at this great big world I had never been able to experience until now. \u201cEverywhere,\u201d I said. By the time we reached the airport, I had narrowed it down to Paris. That\u2019s where I now type this letter, from a top-floor apartment with a view of the Eiffel Tower. Please don\u2019t be angry at me for leaving you the way I did. I beg you. The way life has treated us, you and I have enough to be angry about. Let\u2019s not be that way with each other. I wanted to tell you, my dear. I didn\u2019t because I feared you wouldn\u2019t let me leave or be angry that I hid so much from you the whole time you were caring for me. And, yes, I selfishly wanted some time alone with my granddaughter. Who, don\u2019t forget, also happens to be your niece. You also deserve time with her. Just as you deserve to finally live a life that belongs to you and no one else. To that end, I\u2019ve included two one-way plane tickets to Paris. One for you and another for Archie, with whom I\u2019m certain you\u2019ll share this letter. Your flight departs on the first of February. It is my dearest hope that both of you will be on it. Until we meet again! Virginia \n VIRGINIA HOPE DEAD AT AGE 101 ROME (AP)\u2014Virginia Hope, the key figure in one of the most sensational crimes of the 20th century, died Monday at her villa in Porto Vergogna on Italy\u2019s Amalfi Coast. She was 101. Hope\u2019s alleged murder alongside her well-heeled parents, Winston and Evangeline Hope, caused a stir in 1929 and shocking headlines 54 years later when it was revealed she was still alive and had been forced to assume the identity of her older sister, Lenora. Thought to be mute and paralyzed, Hope gained even greater notoriety when she admitted she had faked her condition for decades. \u201cDid I enact the greatest hoax of the century?\u201d she wrote in her bestselling memoir, Still Life. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. But I like to believe it\u2019s at least in the top ten.\u201d That blend of wit and braggadocio made her a beloved fixture on the talk show circuit, where viewers gobbled up the details of her tabloid-ready story. When asked by David Letterman why she was so eager to talk after pretending she couldn\u2019t for decades, Hope replied, \u201cJust making up for lost time, darling.\u201d When she wasn\u2019t enjoying her late-in-life celebrity, Hope spent her time traveling the globe, visiting all seven continents, including Antarctica, where for a time she held the record for being the oldest woman to do so. Hope is survived by her granddaughter, Jessica Oxford, and her husband, Robert; her great-granddaughter, Mary Hope Oxford; and her devoted friend, caregiver, and traveling companion, Kittredge McDeere. \n Acknowledgments Although my (pen)name is on the cover, this book wouldn\u2019t exist without the hard work and dedication of many others working behind the scenes.
