DERIVATIVE SECURITIES, OR 
 more  
simply 
derivatives, play a large and increasingly 
important role in financial markets. These are 
securities whose prices are determined by, 
or “derive from,” the prices of other securi-
ties. These assets are also called  
contingent 
claims because their payoffs are contingent 
on the prices of other securities. Options and 
futures contracts are both derivative securi-
ties. We will see that their payoffs depend on 
the value of other securities. Swaps, which we 
will discuss in Chapter 23, also are derivatives. 
Because the value of derivatives depends 
on the value of other securities, they can be 
powerful tools for both hedging and specula-
tion. We will investigate these applications in 
the next four chapters, starting in this chapter 
with options. 
 
Trading of standardized options contracts 
on a national exchange started in 1973 when 
the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) 
began listing call options. These contracts 
were almost immediately a great success, 
crowding out the previously existing over-the-
counter trading in stock options. Option con-
tracts are traded now on several exchanges. 
They are written on common stock, stock 
indexes, foreign exchange, agricultural com-
modities, precious metals, and interest rate 
futures. In addition, the over-the-counter 
market has enjoyed a tremendous resurgence 
in recent years as trading in custom-tailored 
options has exploded. Popular and potent 
tools in modifying portfolio characteristics, 
options have become essential tools a portfo-
lio manager must understand. 
 
This chapter is an introduction to options 
markets. It explains how puts and calls work 
and examines their investment characteris-
tics. Popular option strategies are considered 
next. Finally, we examine a range of securities 
with embedded options such as callable or 
convertible bonds, and we take a quick look 
at some so-called exotic options.

 20.1 The Option Contract 
 
Example 20.1 
 
 
Profits and Losses on a Call Option 
 
Consider the January 2010 expiration call option on a share of IBM with an exercise price 
of $130 that was selling on December 2, 2009, for $2.18. Exchange-traded options expire 
on the third Friday of the expiration month, which for this option was January 15, 2010. 
Until the expiration date, the purchaser of the calls may buy shares of IBM for $130. On 
December 2, IBM sells for $127.21. Because the stock price is currently less than $130 a 
share, exercising the option to buy at $130 clearly would make no sense at that moment. 
Indeed, if IBM remains below $130 by the expiration date, the call will be left to expire 
worthless. On the other hand, if IBM is selling above $130 at expiration, the call holder 
will find it optimal to exercise. For example, if IBM sells for $132 on January 15, the 
option will be exercised, as it will give its holder the right to pay $130 for a stock worth 
$132. The value of the option on the expiration date would then be
 
Value at expiration 5 Stock price 2 Exercise price 5 $132 2 $130 5 $2 
Despite the $2 payoff at expiration, the call holder still realizes a loss of $.18 on the invest-
ment because the initial purchase price was $2.18:
 
Profit 5 Final value 2 Original investment 5 $2.00 2 $2.18 5 2$.18 
 
A  
call option 
 gives its holder the right to purchase an asset for a specified price, called 
the  
exercise, 
 or  
 
strike, price, 
 on or before some specified expiration date. For example, a 
January call option on IBM stock with exercise price $130 entitles its owner to purchase 
IBM stock for a price of $130 at any time up to and including the expiration date in January. 
The holder of the call is not required to exercise the option. The holder will choose to exer-
cise only if the market value of the underlying asset exceeds the exercise price. In that case, 
the option holder may “call away” the asset for the exercise price. Otherwise, the option 
may be left unexercised. If it is not exercised before the expiration date of the contract, a 
call option simply expires and no longer has value. Therefore, if the stock price is greater 
than the exercise price on the expiration date, the value of the call option equals the differ-
ence between the stock price and the exercise price; but if the stock price is less than the 
exercise price at expiration, the call will be worthless. The  
net profit on the call is the value 
of the option minus the price originally paid to purchase it. 
 
The purchase price of the option is called the  
 
premium. 
 It represents the compensation 
the purchaser of the call must pay for the right to exercise the option if exercise becomes 
profitable. 
 
Sellers of call options, who are said to  
write calls, receive premium income now as pay-
ment against the possibility they will be required at some later date to deliver the asset in 
return for an exercise price less than the market value of the asset. If the option is left to 
expire worthless, however, then the writer of the call clears a profit equal to the premium 
income derived from the initial sale of the option. But if the call is exercised, the profit to 
the option writer is the premium income derived when the option was initially sold minus 
the difference between the value of the stock that must be delivered and the exercise price 
that is paid for those shares. If that difference is larger than the initial premium, the writer 
will incur a loss. 


 
C H A P T E R  2 0  Options Markets: Introduction

Nevertheless, exercise of the call is optimal at expiration if the stock price exceeds the 
exercise price because the exercise proceeds will offset at least part of the cost of the 
option. The investor in the call will clear a profit if IBM is selling above $132.18 at 
the expiration date. At that stock price, the proceeds from exercise will just cover the origi-
nal cost of the call. 
 
Example 20.2 
 
 
Profits and Losses on a Put Option 
 
Now consider the January 2010 expiration put option on IBM with an exercise price of 
$130, selling on December 2, 2009, for $4.79. It entitled its owner to sell a share of IBM for 
$130 at any time until January 15. If the holder of the put buys a share of IBM and imme-
diately exercises the right to sell at $130, net proceeds will be $130  
2 $127.21  
5 $2.79. 
Obviously, an investor who pays $4.79 for the put has no intention of exercising it imme-
diately. If, on the other hand, IBM sells for $123 at expiration, the put turns out to be a 
profitable investment. Its value at expiration would be
 
Value at expiration 5 Exercise price 2 Stock price 5 $130 2 $123 5 $7 
and the investor’s profit would be $7.00  
2 $4.79  
5 $2.21. This is a holding period return 
of $2.21/$4.79  
5 .461, or 46.1%—over only 44 days! Apparently, put option sellers on 
December 2 (who were on the other side of the transaction) did not consider this outcome 
very likely. 
 
A  
put option 
 gives its holder the right to  
sell an asset for a specified exercise or strike 
price on or before some expiration date. A January expiration put on IBM with exercise 
price $130 entitles its owner to sell IBM stock to the put writer at a price of $130 at any 
time before expiration in January even if the market price of IBM is less than $130. While 
profits on call options increase when the asset  
increases in value, profits on put options 
increase when the asset value  
falls. A put will be exercised only if the exercise price is 
greater than the price of the underlying asset, that is, only if its holder can deliver for the 
exercise price an asset with market value less than the exercise price. (One doesn’t need to 
own the shares of IBM to exercise the IBM put option. Upon exercise, the investor’s broker 
purchases the necessary shares of IBM at the market price and immediately delivers, or 
“puts them,” to an option writer for the exercise price. The owner of the put profits by the 
difference between the exercise price and market price.) 
 
An option is described as  
 
in the money 
 when its exercise would produce profits 
for its holder. An option is  
 
out of the money 
 when exercise would be unprofitable. 
Therefore, a call option is in the money when the asset price is greater than the exercise 
price. It is out of the money when the asset price is less than the exercise price; no one 
would exercise the right to purchase for the strike price an asset worth less than that 
price. Conversely, put options are in the money when the exercise price exceeds the 
asset’s value, because delivery of the lower-valued asset in exchange for the exercise 
price is profitable for the holder. Options are  
 
at the money 
 when the exercise price and 
asset price are equal.

Options Trading 
 
Some options trade on over-the-counter markets. 
The OTC market offers the advantage that the terms 
of the option contract—the exercise price, expiration 
date, and number of shares committed—can be tai-
lored to the needs of the traders. The costs of estab-
lishing an OTC option contract, however, are higher 
than for exchange-traded options. 
 
Options contracts traded on exchanges are stan-
dardized by allowable expiration dates and exercise 
prices for each listed option. Each stock option con-
tract provides for the right to buy or sell 100 shares 
of stock (except when stock splits occur after the 
contract is listed and the contract is adjusted for the 
terms of the split). 
 
Standardization of the terms of listed option con-
tracts means all market participants trade in a lim-
ited and uniform set of securities. This increases the 
depth of trading in any particular option, which low-
ers trading costs and results in a more competitive 
market. Exchanges, therefore, offer two important 
benefits: ease of trading, which flows from a central 
marketplace where buyers and sellers or their repre-
sentatives congregate; and a liquid secondary market where buyers and sellers of options 
can transact quickly and cheaply. 
 
Until recently, most options trading in the United States took place on the Chicago 
Board Options Exchange. However, by 2003 the International Securities Exchange, an 
electronic exchange based in New York, displaced the CBOE as the largest options market. 
Options trading in Europe is uniformly transacted in electronic exchanges. 
 
Figure 20.1 is a selection of listed stock option quotations for IBM. The last recorded 
price on the New York Stock Exchange for IBM shares was $127.21 per share. 
1 Options 
are reported on IBM at exercise prices of $120 through $135.
 
The exercise (or strike) prices bracket the stock price. While exercise prices generally 
are set at five-point intervals, larger intervals sometimes are set for stocks selling above 
$100, and intervals of $2.50 may be used for stocks selling at low prices. If the stock price 
moves outside the range of exercise prices of the existing set of options, new options with 
appropriate exercise prices may be offered. Therefore, at any time, both in-the-money and 
out-of-the-money options will be listed, as in this example. 
 
Figure 20.1 shows both call and put options listed for each expiration date and exercise 
price. The three sets of columns for each option report closing price, trading volume in 
contracts, and open interest (number of outstanding contracts). When we compare prices 
of call options with the same expiration date but different exercise prices in  
Figure 20.1 
, 
we see that the value of a call is lower when the exercise price is higher. This makes sense, 
because the right to purchase a share at a lower exercise price is more valuable than the 
right to purchase at a higher price. Thus the January expiration IBM call option with strike 
1 
Occasionally, this price may not match the closing price listed for the stock on the stock market page. This is 
because some NYSE stocks also trade on exchanges that close after the NYSE, and the stock pages may reflect 
the more recent closing price. The options exchanges, however, close with the NYSE, so the closing NYSE stock 
price is appropriate for comparison with the closing option price.

price $130 sells for $2.18 whereas the $135 exercise price January call sells for only $.84. 
Conversely, put options are worth  
more when the exercise price is higher: You would rather 
have the right to sell shares for $135 than for $130, and this is reflected in the prices of the 
puts. The January expiration put option with strike price $135 sells for $7.75, whereas the 
$130 exercise price January put sells for only $4.79. 
 
If an option does not trade on a given day, three dots will appear in the volume and price 
columns. Because trading is infrequent, it is not unusual to find option prices that appear 
out of line with other prices. You might see, for example, two calls with different exercise 
prices that seem to sell for the same price. This discrepancy arises because the last trades 
for these options may have occurred at different times during the day. At any moment, the 
call with the lower exercise price must be worth more than an otherwise-identical call with 
a higher exercise price. 
 
Expirations of most exchange-traded options tend to be fairly short, ranging up to only 
several months. For larger firms and several stock indexes, however, longer-term options 
are traded with expirations ranging up to several years. These options are called LEAPS

 Now answer part (

American and European Options 
 
An  
 
American option 
 allows its holder to exercise the right to purchase (if a call) or sell (if 
a put) the underlying asset on  
or before the expiration date.  
 
European options allow for 
exercise of the option only on the expiration date. American options, because they allow 
more leeway than their European counterparts, generally will be more valuable. Virtually 
all traded options in the United States are American style. Foreign currency options and 
stock index options are notable exceptions to this rule, however. 
 
Adjustments in Option Contract Terms 
 
Because options convey the right to buy or sell shares at a stated price, stock splits 
would radically alter their value if the terms of the options contract were not adjusted to 
account for the stock split. For example, reconsider the IBM call options in  
Figure 20.1 
. 
If IBM were to announce a 2-for-1 split, its share price would fall from about $127 to 
about $63.50. A call option with exercise price $130 would be just about worthless, with 
virtually no possibility that the stock would sell at more than $130 before the options 
expired. 
 
To account for a stock split, the exercise price is reduced by a factor of the split, and 
the number of options held is increased by that factor. For example, each original call 
option with exercise price of $130 would be altered after a 2-for-1 split to 2 new options, 
with each new option carrying an exercise price of $65. A similar adjustment is made 
for stock dividends of more than 10%; the number of shares covered by each option is 
increased in proportion to the stock dividend, and the exercise price is reduced by that 
proportion.

P A R T  V I  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives
 
In contrast to stock dividends, cash dividends do not affect the terms of an option con-
tract. Because payment of a cash dividend reduces the selling price of the stock without 
inducing offsetting adjustments in the option contract, the value of the option is affected by 
dividend policy. Other things being equal, call option values are lower for high-dividend 
payout policies, because such policies slow the rate of increase of stock prices; conversely, 
put values are higher for high-dividend payouts. (Of course, the option values do not nec-
essarily rise or fall on the dividend payment or ex-dividend dates. Dividend payments are 
anticipated, so the effect of the payment already is built into the original option price.)

Suppose that IBM’s stock price at the exercise date is $140, and the exercise price of the call 
is $130. What is the payoff on one option contract? After a 2-for-1 split, the stock price is 
$70, the exercise price is $65, and the option holder now can purchase 200 shares. Show that 
the split leaves the payoff from the option unaffected. 
 
 
The Options Clearing Corporation 
 
The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), the clearinghouse for options trading, is jointly 
owned by the exchanges on which stock options are traded. Buyers and sellers of options 
who agree on a price will strike a deal. At this point, the OCC steps in. The OCC places 
itself between the two traders, becoming the effective buyer of the option from the writer 
and the effective writer of the option to the buyer. All individuals, therefore, deal only with 
the OCC, which effectively guarantees contract performance. 
 
When an option holder exercises an option, the OCC arranges for a member firm with 
clients who have written that option to make good on the option obligation. The mem-
ber firm selects from its clients who have written that option to fulfill the contract. The 
selected client must deliver 100 shares of stock at a price equal to the exercise price for 
each call option contract written or must purchase 100 shares at the exercise price for each 
put option contract written. 
 
Because the OCC guarantees contract performance, option writers are required to post 
margin to guarantee that they can fulfill their contract obligations. The margin required is 
determined in part by the amount by which the option is in the money, because that value 
is an indicator of the potential obligation of the option writer. When the required margin 
exceeds the posted margin, the writer will receive a margin call. In contrast, the holder of 
the option need not post margin because the holder will exercise the option only if it is 
profitable to do so. After purchase of the option, no further money is at risk. 
 
Margin requirements are determined in part by the other securities held in the investor’s 
portfolio. For example, a call option writer owning the stock against which the option is 
written can satisfy the margin requirement simply by allowing a broker to hold that stock 
in the brokerage account. The stock is then guaranteed to be available for delivery should 
the call option be exercised. If the underlying security is not owned, however, the margin 
requirement is determined by the value of the underlying security as well as by the amount 
by which the option is in or out of the money. Out-of-the-money options require less mar-
gin from the writer, for expected payouts are lower. 
 
Other Listed Options 
 
Options on assets other than stocks are also widely traded. These include options on mar-
ket indexes and industry indexes, on foreign currency, and even on the futures prices of 
agricultural products, gold, silver, fixed-income securities, and stock indexes. We will dis-
cuss these in turn. 


 
C H A P T E R  2 0  Options Markets: Introduction 
673
 
Index Options 
 An index option is a call or put based on a stock market index such 
as the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ 100. Index options are traded on several broad-based 
indexes as well as on several industry-specific indexes and even commodity price indexes. 
We discussed many of these indexes in Chapter 2. 
 
The construction of the indexes can vary across contracts or exchanges. For example, the 
S&P 100 index is a value-weighted average of the 100 stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 100 
stock group. The weights are proportional to the market value of outstanding equity for each 
stock. The Dow Jones Industrial Index, by contrast, is a price-weighted average of 30 stocks. 
 
Option contracts on many foreign stock indexes also trade. For example, options on the 
(Japanese) Nikkei Stock Index trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and options on 
the Eurotop 100 and Japan indexes trade on the American Stock Exchange. The Chicago 
Board Options Exchange, as well as the Amex, lists options on industry indexes such as 
the biotech or financial industries. 
 
In contrast to stock options, index options do not require that the call writer actually 
“deliver the index” upon exercise or that the put writer “purchase the index.” Instead, 
a cash settlement procedure is used. The payoff that would accrue upon exercise of the 
option is calculated, and the option writer simply pays that amount to the option holder. 
The payoff is equal to the difference between the exercise price of the option and the value 
of the index. For example, if the S&P index is at 1100 when a call option on the index with 
exercise price 1090 is exercised, the holder of the call receives a cash payment of the dif-
ference, 1100 
2 
1090, times the contract multiplier of $100, or $1,000 per contract. 
 
Options on the major indexes, that is, the S&P 100 (often called the OEX after its 
ticker symbol), the S&P 500 (the SPX), the NASDAQ 100 (the NDX), and the Dow Jones 
Industrials (the DJX), are the most actively traded contracts on the CBOE. Together, these 
contracts dominate CBOE volume. 
 
Futures Options 
 Futures options give their holders the right to buy or sell a speci-
fied futures contract, using as a futures price the exercise price of the option. Although the 
delivery process is slightly complicated, the terms of futures options contracts are designed 
in effect to allow the option to be written on the futures price itself. The option holder 
receives upon exercise a net payoff equal to the difference between the current futures 
price on the specified asset and the exercise price of the option. Thus if the futures price is, 
say, $37, and the call has an exercise price of $35, the holder who exercises the call option 
on the futures gets a payoff of $2. 
 
Foreign Currency Options 
 A currency option offers the right to buy or sell a quan-
tity of foreign currency for a specified amount of domestic currency. Currency option con-
tracts call for purchase or sale of the currency in exchange for a specified number of U.S. 
dollars. Contracts are quoted in cents or fractions of a cent per unit of foreign currency. 
 
There is an important difference between currency options and currency  
futures options. 
The former provide payoffs that depend on the difference between the exercise price and 
the exchange rate at maturity. The latter are foreign exchange futures options that provide 
payoffs that depend on the difference between the exercise price and the exchange rate 
 
futures price at maturity. Because exchange rates and exchange rate futures prices gener-
ally are not equal, the options and futures-options contracts will have different values, even 
with identical expiration dates and exercise prices. Trading volume in currency futures 
options dominates by far trading in currency options. 
 
 
Interest Rate Options 
 Options are traded on Treasury notes and bonds, Treasury 
bills, certificates of deposit, GNMA pass-through certificates, and yields on Treasury 
and Eurodollar securities of various maturities. Options on several interest rate futures 


674 
P A R T  V I  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives
also trade. Among these are contracts on Treasury bond, Treasury note, municipal bond, 
LIBOR, Euribor, 
 
2 and Eurodollar futures.
 20.2 Values of Options at Expiration 
 
Call Options 
 
Recall that a call option gives the right to purchase a security at the exercise price. Suppose 
you hold a call option on FinCorp stock with an exercise price of $100, and FinCorp is now 
selling at $110. You can exercise your option to purchase the stock at $100 and simultane-
ously sell the shares at the market price of $110, clearing $10 per share. Yet if the shares 
sell below $100, you can sit on the option and do nothing, realizing no further gain or loss. 
The value of the call option at expiration equals2
 
Payoff to call holder 5 ST 2 X
if ST . X
0
if ST # X  
where  
S 
 
T 
 is the value of the stock at expiration and  
X is the exercise price. This formula 
emphasizes the option property because the payoff cannot be negative. That is, the option 
is exercised only if  
S 
 
T 
 exceeds  
X. If  
S 
 
T 
 is less than  
X, exercise does not occur, and the 
option expires with zero value. The loss to the option holder in this case equals the price 
originally paid for the option. More generally, the  
profit to the option holder is the value of 
the option at expiration minus the original purchase price. 
 
The value at expiration of the call with exercise price $100 is given by the schedule:
Stock price:
$90
$100
$110
$120
$130
Option value:
0
0
10
20
30
For stock prices at or below $100, the option is worthless. Above $100, the option is worth 
the excess of the stock price over $100. The option’s value increases by $1 for each dollar 
increase in the stock price. This relationship can be depicted graphically as in  
Figure 20.2 
. 
 
The solid line in  
Figure 20.2 depicts the value of the call at expiration. The net  
profit to 
the holder of the call equals the gross payoff less the initial investment in the call. Suppose 
the call cost $14. Then the profit to the call holder would be given by the dashed (bottom) 
line of  
Figure 20.2 
. At option expiration, the investor suffers a loss of $14 if the stock price 
is less than or equal to $100.

The call writer, who is exposed to losses if 
the stock price increases, is willing to bear 
this risk in return for the option premium. 
 
Figure 20.3 depicts the payoff and profit 
diagrams for the call writer. These are the 
mirror images of the corresponding dia-
grams for call holders. The break-even 
point for the option writer also is $114. The 
(negative) payoff at that point just offsets 
the premium originally received when the 
option was written. 
 
Put Options 
 
A put option is the right to sell an asset at 
the exercise price. In this case, the holder 
will not exercise the option unless the asset 
is worth  
less than the exercise price. For 
example, if FinCorp shares were to fall to 
$90, a put option with exercise price $100 could be exercised to clear $10 for its holder. 
The holder would purchase a share for $90 and simultaneously deliver it to the put option 
writer for the exercise price of $100.

The solid line in  
Figure 20.4 illustrates the payoff at expiration to the holder of a put option 
on FinCorp stock with an exercise price of $100. If the stock price at expiration is above 
$100, the put has no value, as the right to sell the shares at $100 would not be exercised. 
Below a price of $100, the put value at expiration increases by $1 for each dollar the stock 
price falls. The dashed line in  
Figure 20.4 is a graph of the put option owner’s profit at 
expiration, net of the initial cost of the put. 
 
Writing puts  
naked (i.e., writing a put 
without an offsetting short position in the 
stock for hedging purposes) exposes the 
writer to losses if the market falls. Writing 
naked out-of-the-money puts was once con-
sidered an attractive way to generate income, 
as it was believed that as long as the market 
did not fall sharply before the option expira-
tion, the option premium could be collected 
without the put holder ever exercising the 
option against the writer. Because only sharp 
drops in the market could result in losses to 
the put writer, the strategy was not viewed 
as overly risky. However, in the wake of the 
market crash of October 1987, such put writ-
ers suffered huge losses. Participants now 
perceive much greater risk to this strategy.

Option versus Stock Investments 
 
Purchasing call options is a bullish strategy; that is, the calls provide profits when stock 
prices increase. Purchasing puts, in contrast, is a bearish strategy. Symmetrically, writing 
calls is bearish, whereas writing puts is bullish. Because option values depend on the price of 
the underlying stock, purchase of options may be viewed as a substitute for direct purchase 
or sale of a stock. Why might an option strategy be preferable to direct stock transactions? 
 
For example, why would you purchase a call option rather than buy shares of stock 
directly? Maybe you have some information that leads you to believe the stock will 
increase in value from its current level, which in our examples we will take to be $100. You 
know your analysis could be incorrect, however, and that shares also could fall in price. 
Suppose a 6-month maturity call option with exercise price $100 currently sells for $10, 
and the interest rate for the period is 3%. Consider these three strategies for investing a 
sum of money, say, $10,000. For simplicity, suppose the firm will not pay any dividends 
until after the 6-month period. 
 
Strategy A: Invest entirely in stock. Buy 100 shares, each selling for $100. 
 
Strategy B: Invest entirely in at-the-money call options. Buy 1,000 calls, each selling 
for $10. (This would require 10 contracts, each for 100 shares.) 
 
 
Strategy C: Purchase 100 call options for $1,000. Invest your remaining $9,000 in 
6-month T-bills, to earn 3% interest. The bills will grow in value from $9,000 to 
$9,000

Portfolio  
A will be worth 100 times the share price. Portfolio  
B is worthless unless shares 
sell for more than the exercise price of the call. Once that point is reached, the portfolio is 
worth 1,000 times the excess of the stock price over the exercise price. Finally, portfolio  
C
is worth $9,270 from the investment in T-bills plus any profits from the 100 call options. 
Remember that each of these portfolios involves the same $10,000 initial investment. The 
rates of return on these three portfolios are as follows:

These rates of return are graphed in  
Figure 20.5 
. 
 
Comparing the returns of portfolios  
B and  
C to those of the simple investment in stock 
represented by portfolio  
A, we see that options offer two interesting features. First, an option 
offers leverage. Compare the returns of portfolios  
B and  
A. Unless the stock increases 
from its initial value of $100, the value 
of portfolio  
B falls precipitously to 
zero—a rate of return of negative 100%. 
Conversely, modest increases in the rate 
of return on the stock result in dispro-
portionate increases in the option rate of 
return. For example, a 4.3% increase in 
the stock price from $115 to $120 would 
increase the rate of return on the call 
from 50% to 100%. In this sense, calls 
are a levered investment on the stock. 
Their values respond more than propor-
tionately to changes in the stock value. 
 
Figure 20.5 vividly illustrates this 
point. The slope of the all-option port-
folio is far steeper than that of the all-
stock portfolio, reflecting its greater 
proportional sensitivity to the value of 
the underlying security. The leverage 
factor is the reason investors (illegally) 
exploiting inside information com-
monly choose options as their invest-
ment vehicle.

The potential insurance value of options is the second interesting feature, as portfolio  
C 
shows. The T-bill-plus-option portfolio cannot be worth less than $9,270 after 6 months, 
as the option can always be left to expire worthless. The worst possible rate of return on 
portfolio  
C is  
2 
7.3%, compared to a (theoretically) worst possible rate of return on the 
stock of  
2 
100% if the company were to go bankrupt. Of course, this insurance comes at a 
price: When the share price increases, portfolio  
C, the option-plus-bills portfolio, does not 
perform as well as portfolio  
A, the all-stock portfolio. 
 
This simple example makes an important point. Although options can be used by specu-
lators as effectively leveraged stock positions, as in portfolio  
B, they also can be used by 
investors who desire to tailor their risk exposures in creative ways, as in portfolio  
C. For 
example, the call-plus-bills strategy of portfolio  
C provides a rate of return profile quite 
unlike that of the stock alone. The absolute limitation on downside risk is a novel and 
attractive feature of this strategy. We next discuss several option strategies that provide 
other novel risk profiles that might be attractive to hedgers and other investors. 
 20.3 Option Strategies 
 
An unlimited variety of payoff patterns can be achieved by combining puts and calls with 
various exercise prices. We explain in this section the motivation and structure of some of 
the more popular ones. 
 
Protective Put 
 
Imagine you would like to invest in a stock, but you are unwilling to bear potential losses 
beyond some given level. Investing in the stock alone seems risky to you because in prin-
ciple you could lose all the money you invest. You might consider instead investing in 
stock and purchasing a put option on the stock.  
Table 20.1 shows the total value of your 
portfolio at option expiration: Whatever happens to the stock price, you are guaranteed a 
payoff at least equal to the put option’s exercise price because the put gives you the right to 
sell your shares for that price. 
 
Example 20.3 
 
 
Protective Put 
 
Suppose the strike price is  
X  
5 $100 and the stock is selling at $97 at option expiration. 
Then the value of your total portfolio is $100. The stock is worth $97 and the value of the 
expiring put option is
 
X 2 ST 5 $100 2 $97 5 $3 
Another way to look at it is that you are holding the stock and a put contract giving you 
the right to sell the stock for $100. The right to sell locks in a minimum portfolio value of 
$100. On the other hand, if the stock price is above $100, say, $104, then the right to sell a 
share at $100 is worthless. You allow the put to expire unexercised, ending up with a share 
of stock worth  
S 
 
T 
  
5 $104. 
 
Figure 20.6 illustrates the payoff and profit to this  
 
protective put 
 strategy. The solid 
line in  
Figure 20.6 
C is the total payoff. The dashed line is displaced downward by the cost 
of establishing the position,

It is instructive to compare the profit 
on the protective put strategy with that 
of the stock investment. For simplicity, 
consider an at-the-money protective put, 
so that  
X  
5  
S

.  
Figure 20.7 compares 
the profits for the two strategies. The 
profit on the stock is zero if the stock 
price remains unchanged and  
S 
 
T 
  
5  
S0 
. 
It rises or falls by $1 for every dollar 
swing in the ultimate stock price. The 
profit on the protective put is negative 
and equal to the cost of the put if  
S 
 
T 
 is 
below  
S 
0 
. The profit on the protective 
put increases one for one with increases 
in the stock price once  
S 
 
T 
 exceeds  
S 
0 
. 
 
Figure 20.7 makes it clear that the 
protective put offers some insurance 
against stock price declines in that it 
limits losses. Therefore, protective put 
strategies provide a form of  
portfolio 
insurance. The cost of the protection is 
that, in the case of stock price increases, 
your profit is reduced by the cost of the 
put, which turned out to be unneeded. 
 
This example also shows that despite 
the common perception that derivatives mean risk, derivative securities can be used effec-
tively for  
risk management. In fact, such risk management is becoming accepted as part 
of the fiduciary responsibility of financial managers. Indeed, in one often-cited court case, 
Brane v.  
Roth, a company’s board of directors was successfully sued for failing to use 
derivatives to hedge the price risk of grain held in storage. Such hedging might have been 
accomplished using protective puts. 
 
The claim that derivatives are best viewed as risk management tools may seem surpris-
ing in light of the credit crisis of the last few years. The crisis was immediately precipi-
tated when the highly risky positions that many financial institutions had established in 
credit derivatives blew up 2007–2008, resulting in large losses and government bailouts. 
Still, the same characteristics that make derivatives potent tools to increase risk also make 
them highly effective in managing risk, at least when used properly. Derivatives have aptly 
been compared to power tools: very useful in skilled hands, but also very dangerous when 
not handled with care. The nearby box makes the case for derivatives as central to risk 
management. 
 
Covered Calls 
 
A  
covered call position is the purchase of a share of stock with a simultaneous sale of a 
call on that stock. The call is “covered” because the potential obligation to deliver the stock 
is covered by the stock held in the portfolio. Writing an option without an offsetting stock 
position is called by contrast  
naked option writing. The value of a covered call position at 
the expiration of the call, presented in  
Table 20.2 
, equals the stock value minus the value 
of the call. The call value is  
subtracted because the covered call position involves writing 
a call to another investor who may exercise it at your expense.

The Case for Derivatives 
 
They’ve been dubbed financial weapons of mass destruc-
tion, attacked for causing the financial turmoil sweeping 
the nation and identified as the kryptonite that brought 
down the global economy. Yet few Main Streeters really 
know what derivatives are—namely, financial contracts 
between a buyer and a seller that derive value from an 
underlying asset, such as a mortgage or a stock. There 
seems to be near consensus that derivatives were a source 
of undue risk. 
 
And then there’s Robert Shiller. The Yale economist 
believes just the opposite is true. A champion of financial 
innovation and an expert in management of risk, Shiller 
contends that derivatives, far from being a problem, are 
actually the solution. Derivatives, Shiller says, are merely 
a risk-management tool the same way insurance is. “You 
pay a premium and if an event happens, you get a pay-
ment.” That tool can be used well or, as happened recently, 
used badly. Shiller warns that banishing the tool gets us 
nowhere. 
 
For all the trillions in derivative trading, there were very 
few traders. Almost all the subprime mortgages that were 
bundled and turned into derivatives were sold by a hand-
ful of Wall Street institutions, working with a small num-
ber of large institutional buyers. It was a huge but illiquid 
and opaque market. 
 
Meanwhile, the system was built on the myriad deci-
sions of individual homeowners and lenders around the 
world. None of them, however, could hedge their bets the 
way large institutions can. Those buying a condo in Miami 
had no way to protect themselves if the market went 
down. 
 
Derivatives, according to Shiller, could be used by 
 
homeowners—and, by extension, lenders—to insure 
themselves against falling prices. In Shiller’s scenario, you 
would be able to go to your broker and buy a new type of 
financial instrument, perhaps a derivative that is inversely 
related to a regional home-price index. If the value of 
houses in your area declined, the financial instrument 
would increase in value, offsetting the loss. Lenders could 
do the same thing, which would help them hedge against 
foreclosures. The idea is to make the housing market more 
liquid. More buyers and sellers mean that markets stay 
 
liquid and functional even under pressure. 
 
Some critics dismiss Shiller’s basic premise that more 
derivatives would make the housing market more liquid 
and more stable. They point out that futures contracts 
haven’t made equity markets or commodity markets 
immune from massive moves up and down. They add that 
a ballooning world of home-based derivatives wouldn’t 
lead to homeowners’ insurance: it would lead to a new 
playground for speculators. 
 
In essence, Shiller is laying the intellectual ground-
work for the next financial revolution. We are now suffer-
ing through the first major crisis of the Information Age 
economy. Shiller’s answers may be counterintuitive, but no 
more so than those of doctors and scientists who centu-
ries ago recognized that the cure for infectious diseases 
was not flight or quarantine, but purposely infecting more 
people through vaccinations. “We’ve had a major glitch 
in derivatives and securitization,” says Shiller. “The Titanic 
sank almost a century ago, but we didn’t stop sailing across 
the Atlantic.” 
 
Of course, people did think twice about getting on a 
ship, at least for a while. But if we listen only to our fears, 
we lose the very dynamism that has propelled us this far. 
That is the nub of Shiller’s call for more derivatives and 
more innovation. Shiller’s appeal is a tough sell at a time 
when derivatives have produced so much havoc. But he 
reminds us that the tools that got us here are not to blame; 
they can be used badly and they can be used well. And 
trying to stem the ineffable tide of human creativity is a 
fool’s errand.

WORDS FROM THE STREET 
 
The solid line in  
Figure 20.8 
C illustrates the payoff pattern. You see that the total posi-
tion is worth  
S 
 
T 
 when the stock price at time  
T is below  
X and rises to a maximum of  
X 
when  
S 
 
T 
 exceeds  
X. In essence, the sale of the call options means the call writer has sold 
the claim to any stock value above  
X in return for the initial premium (the call price). 
Therefore, at expiration, the position is worth at most  
X. The dashed line of  
Figure 20.8 
C 
is the net profit to the covered call. 
 
Writing covered call options has been a popular investment strategy among institutional 
investors. Consider the managers of a fund invested largely in stocks. They might find it 
appealing to write calls on some or all of the stock in order to boost income by the premi-
ums collected. Although they thereby forfeit potential capital gains should the stock price 
rise above the exercise price, if they view  
X as the price at which they plan to sell the stock 
anyway, then the call may be viewed as a kind of “sell discipline.” The written call guaran-
tees the stock sale will occur as planned.

Covered Call 
 
Assume a pension fund holds 1,000 shares of stock, with a current price of $100 per share. 
Suppose the portfolio manager intends to sell all 1,000 shares if the share price hits $110, 
and a call expiring in 60 days with an exercise price of $110 currently sells for $5. By writ-
ing 10 call contracts (for 100 shares each) the fund can pick up $5,000 in extra income. 
The fund would lose its share of profits from any movement of the stock price above $110 
per share, but given that it would have sold its shares at $110, it would not have realized 
those profits anyway. 
 
Straddle 
 
A long  
 
straddle is established by buying both a call and a put on a stock, each with the 
same exercise price,  
X, and the same expiration date,  
T. Straddles are useful strategies for 
investors who believe a stock will move a lot in price but are uncertain about the direction 
of the move. For example, suppose you believe an important court case that will make or 
break a company is about to be settled, and the market is not yet aware of the situation. 
The stock will either double in value if the case is settled favorably or will drop by half if 
the settlement goes against the company. The straddle position will do well regardless of 
the outcome because its value is highest when the stock price makes extreme upward or 
downward moves from  
X. 
 
The worst-case scenario for a straddle is no movement in the stock price. If  
S 
 
T 
 equals 
 
X, both the call and the put expire worthless, and the investor’s outlay for the purchase 
of both options is lost. Straddle positions, therefore, are bets on volatility. An investor 


684 
P A R T  V I  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives
who  
establishes a straddle must view the stock as more volatile than the market does. 
Conversely, investors who  
write straddles—selling both a call and a put—must believe the 
stock is less volatile. They accept the option premiums now, hoping the stock price will not 
change much before option expiration. 
 
The payoff to a straddle is presented in  
Table 20.3 
. The solid line of  
Figure 20.9 
C illus-
trates this payoff. Notice the portfolio payoff is always positive, except at the one point 
where the portfolio has zero value,  
S 
 
T 
  
5  
X. You might wonder why all investors don’t 
pursue such a seemingly “no-lose” strategy. The reason is that the straddle requires that 
both the put and call be purchased. The value of the portfolio at expiration, while never 
negative, still must exceed the initial cash outlay for a straddle investor to clear a profit. 
 
The dashed line of  
Figure 20.9 
C is the profit to the straddle. The profit line lies below 
the payoff line by the cost of purchasing the straddle,  
P  
1  
C. It is clear from the diagram 
that the straddle position generates a loss unless the stock price deviates substantially from 
 
X. The stock price must depart from  
X by the total amount expended to purchase the call 
and the put for the straddle to clear a profit. 
 
Strips and  
straps are variations 
of straddles. A strip is two puts and 
one call on a security with the same 
exercise price and maturity date. A 
strap is two calls and one put. 
 
Spreads 
 
A  
spread 
 is a combination of two or more call options (or two or more puts) on the same 
stock with differing exercise prices or times to maturity. Some options are bought, whereas 
others are sold, or written. A  
money spread involves the purchase of one option and the 
simultaneous sale of another with a different exercise price. A  
time spread refers to the sale 
and purchase of options with differing expiration dates. 
 
Consider a money spread in which one call option is bought at an exercise price  
X 
1 
, 
whereas another call with identical expiration date, but higher exercise price,  
X 
2 
, is written. 
The payoff to this position will be the difference in the value of the call held and the value 
of the call written, as in  
Table 20.4 
. 
 
There are now three instead of two outcomes to distinguish: the lowest-price region 
where  
S 
 
T 
 is below both exercise prices, a middle region where  
S 
 
T 
 is between the two exer-
cise prices, and a high-price region where  
S 
 
T 
 exceeds both exercise prices.  
Figure 20.10 
illustrates the payoff and profit to this strategy, which is called a  
bullish spread because the 
payoff either increases or is unaffected by stock price increases. Holders of bullish spreads 
benefit from stock price increases. 
 
One motivation for a bullish spread might be that the investor thinks one option is over-
priced relative to another. For example, an investor who believes an  
X  
5 $100 call is cheap 
compared to an  
X  
5 $110 call might establish the spread, even without a strong desire to 
take a bullish position in the stock. 
 
 
Collars 
 
A  
collar is an options strategy that brackets the value of a portfolio between two bounds. 
Suppose that an investor currently is holding a large position in FinCorp stock, which is 
currently selling at $100 per share. A lower bound of $90 can be placed on the value of 
the portfolio by buying a protective put with exercise price $90. This protection, however, 
requires that the investor pay the put premium. To raise the money to pay for the put, the 
investor might write a call option, say, with exercise price $110. The call might sell for

roughly the same price as the put, meaning that the net outlay for the two options positions 
is approximately zero. Writing the call limits the portfolio’s upside potential. Even if the 
stock price moves above $110, the investor will do no better than $110, because at a higher 
price the stock will be called away. Thus the investor obtains the downside protection rep-
resented by the exercise price of the put by selling her claim to any upside potential beyond 
the exercise price of the call. 
 
Example 20.5 
 
 
Collars 
 
A collar would be appropriate for an investor who has a target wealth goal in mind but is 
unwilling to risk losses beyond a certain level. If you are contemplating buying a house 
for $220,000, for example, you might set this figure as your goal. Your current wealth may 
be $200,000, and you are unwilling to risk losing more than $20,000. A collar established 
by (1) purchasing 2,000 shares of stock currently selling at $100 per share, (2) purchas-
ing 2,000 put options (20 options contracts) with exercise price $90, and (3) writing 2,000 
calls with exercise price $110 would give you a good chance to realize the $20,000 capital 
gain without risking a loss of more than $20,000.

 20.4 The Put-Call Parity Relationship 
 
We saw in the previous section that a protective put portfolio, comprising a stock position 
and a put option on that position, provides a payoff with a guaranteed minimum value, 
but with unlimited upside potential. This is not the only way to achieve such protection, 
however. A call-plus-bills portfolio also can provide limited downside risk with unlimited 
upside potential. 
 
Consider the strategy of buying a call option and, in addition, buying Treasury bills with 
face value equal to the exercise price of the call, and with maturity date equal to the expira-
tion date of the option. For example, if the exercise price of the call option is $100, then 
each option contract (which is written on 100 shares) would require payment of $10,000 
upon exercise. Therefore, you would purchase a T-bill with a maturity value of $10,000. 
More generally, for each option that you hold with exercise price  
X, you would purchase a 
risk-free zero-coupon bond with face value  
X. 
 
Examine the value of this position at time  
T, when the options expire and the zero-
coupon bond matures:

If the stock price is below the exercise price, the call is worthless, but the riskless bond 
matures to its face value,  
X. The bond therefore provides a floor value to the portfolio. If

the stock price exceeds  
X, then the payoff to the call,  
S 
 
T

X, is added to the face value of 
the bond to provide a total payoff of  
S 
 
T 
 
. The payoff to this portfolio is precisely identical 
to the payoff of the protective put that we derived in  
Table 20.1 
. 
 
If two portfolios always provide equal values, then they must cost the same amount to 
establish. Therefore, the call-plus-bond portfolio must cost the same as the stock-plus-put 
portfolio. Each call costs  
C. The riskless zero-coupon bond costs

Equation 20.1 is called the  
 
put-call parity theorem 
 because it represents the proper 
relationship between put and call prices. If the parity relation is ever violated, an arbi-
trage opportunity arises. For example, suppose you collect these data for a certain 
stock:
Stock price
$110
Call price (1-year expiration,  
X  
5 $105)
$ 17
Put price (1-year expiration,  
X  
5 $105)
$   5
 
Risk-free interest rate 
 
5% per year
 
 
We can use these data in  
Equation 20.1 to see if parity is violated:
 
C 1
X
(1 1 rf)T 5
? S0 1 P
17 1 105
1.05 5
?
110 1 5
 117 2 115
This result, a violation of parity—117 does not equal 115—indicates mispricing. To exploit 
the mispricing, you buy the relatively cheap portfolio (the stock-plus-put position repre-
sented on the right-hand side of the equation) and sell the relatively expensive portfolio 
(the call-plus-bond position corresponding to the left-hand side). Therefore, if you  
buy the 
stock,  
buy the put,  
write the call, and  
borrow $100 for 1 year (because borrowing money is 
the opposite of buying a bond), you should earn arbitrage profits. 
 
Let’s examine the payoff to this strategy. In 1 year, the stock will be worth  
S 
 
T 
 
. The $100 
borrowed will be paid back with interest, resulting in a cash outflow of $105. The written 
call will result in a cash outflow of  
S 
 
T 
  
2 $105 if  
S 
 
T 
 exceeds $105. The purchased put pays 
off $105  
2  
S 
 
T 
 if the stock price is below $105. 
 
Table 20.5 summarizes the outcome. The immediate cash inflow is $2. In 1 year, the 
various positions provide exactly offsetting cash flows: The $2 inflow is realized with-
out any offsetting outflows. This is an arbitrage opportunity that investors will pursue on 
a large scale until buying and selling pressure restores the parity condition expressed in 
 
Equation 20.1 
. 
 
Equation 20.1 actually applies only to options on stocks that pay no dividends before 
the expiration date of the option. The extension of the parity condition for European call 
options on dividend-paying stocks is, however, straightforward.  
Problem 12 at the end of 


 
C H A P T E R  2 0  Options Markets: Introduction 
689
the chapter leads you through the extension of the parity relationship. The more general 
formulation of the  
put-call parity condition is
 
P 5 C 2 S0 1 PV(X) 1 PV(dividends) 
 
 
(20.2) 
 
 
where PV(dividends) is the present value of the dividends that will be paid by the stock 
during the life of the option. If the stock does not pay dividends,  
Equation 20.2 becomes 
identical to  
Equation 20.1 
. 
 
Notice that this generalization would apply as well to European options on assets other 
than stocks. Instead of using dividend income in  
Equation 20.2 
, we would let any income 
paid out by the underlying asset play the role of the stock dividends. For example, European 
put and call options on bonds would satisfy the same parity relationship, except that the 
bond’s coupon income would replace the stock’s dividend payments in the parity formula. 
 
Even this generalization, however, applies only to European options, as the cash flow 
streams from the two portfolios represented by the two sides of  
Equation 20.2 will match 
only if each position is held until expiration. If a call and a put may be optimally exercised 
at different times before their common expiration date, then the equality of payoffs cannot 
be assured, or even expected, and the portfolios will have different values.

Put-Call Parity 
 
Let’s see how well parity works using real data on the IBM options in  
Figure 20.1 
. The 
January expiration call with exercise price $130 and time to expiration of 44 days cost 
$2.18 while the corresponding put option cost $4.79. IBM was selling for $127.21, and 
the annualized short-term interest rate on this date was .2%. No dividends will be paid 
between the date of the listing, December 2, and the option expiration date. According to 
parity, we should find that
 
 
P 5 C 1 PV(X) 2 S0 1 PV(dividends)
 
4.79 5 2.18 1
130
(1.002)44/365 2 127.21 1 0
 
4.79 5 2.18 1 129.97 2 127.21
 
4.79 5 4.94
 
So parity is violated by about $.15 per share. Is this a big enough difference to exploit? 
Probably not. You have to weigh the potential profit against the trading costs of the call, 
put, and stock. More important, given the fact that options trade relatively infrequently, this 
deviation from parity might not be “real,” but may instead be attributable to “stale” (i.e., 
out-of-date) price quotes at which you cannot actually trade.

 20.5 Option-like Securities 
 
Suppose you never traded an option directly. Why do you need to appreciate the properties 
of options in formulating an investment plan? Many financial instruments and agreements 
have features that convey implicit or explicit options to one or more parties. If you are 
to value and use these securities correctly, you must understand these embedded option 
attributes. 
 
Callable Bonds 
 
You know from Chapter 14 that many corporate bonds are issued with call provisions enti-
tling the issuer to buy bonds back from bondholders at some time in the future at a speci-
fied call price. A call provision conveys a call option to the issuer, where the exercise price 
is equal to the price at which the bond can be repurchased. A callable bond arrangement is 
essentially a sale of a  
straight bond (a bond with no option features such as callability or 
convertibility) to the investor and the concurrent issuance of a call option by the investor 
to the bond-issuing firm. 
 
There must be some compensation for conveying this implicit call option to the firm. If 
the callable bond were issued with the same coupon rate as a straight bond, it would sell 
at a lower price than the straight bond: the price difference would equal the value of the 
call. To sell callable bonds at par, firms must issue them with coupon rates higher than the 
coupons on straight debt. The higher coupons are the investor’s compensation for the call 
option retained by the issuer. Coupon rates usually are selected so that the newly issued 
bond will sell at par value. 
 
Figure 20.11 illustrates this optionlike property. The horizontal axis is the value of a 
straight bond with otherwise identical terms to the callable bond. The dashed 45-degree 
line represents the value of straight debt. The solid line is the value of the callable bond, 
and the dotted line is the value of the call option retained by the firm. A callable bond’s 
potential for capital gains is limited by the firm’s option to repurchase at the call price.

Suppose the period of call protection is extended. How will the cou-

the issuer to sell the bonds at par value? 
 
 
CONCEPT 
CHECK

How is a callable bond similar to a covered call strategy on a straight 
bond? 
 
 
The option inherent in callable bonds actually is more complex than an ordinary call 
option, because usually it may be exercised only after some initial period of call protection. 
The price at which the bond is callable may change over time also. Unlike exchange-listed 
options, these features are defined in the initial bond covenant and will depend on the 
needs of the issuing firm and its perception of the market’s tastes. 
 
Convertible Securities 
 
Convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock convey options to the holder of the secu-
rity rather than to the issuing firm. A convertible security typically gives its holder the right 


 
C H A P T E R  2 0  Options Markets: Introduction 
691
to exchange each bond or share of 
preferred stock for a fixed number of 
shares of common stock, regardless 
of the market prices of the securities 
at the time. 
 
For example, a bond with a  
con-
version ratio of 10 allows its holder to 
convert one bond of par value $1,000 
into 10 shares of common stock. 
Alternatively, we say the  
conversion 
price in this case is $100: To receive 
10 shares of stock, the investor sacri-
fices bonds with face value $1,000 or, 
put another way, $100 of face value 
per share. If the present value of the 
bond’s scheduled payments is less 
than 10 times the value of one share 
of stock, it may pay to convert; that is, 
the conversion option is in the money. 
A bond worth $950 with a conversion 
ratio of 10 could be converted prof-
itably if the stock were selling above 
$95, as the value of the 10 shares 
received for each bond surrendered 
would exceed $950. Most convertible bonds are issued “deep out of the money.” That is, 
the issuer sets the conversion ratio so that conversion will not be profitable unless there is 
a substantial increase in stock prices and/or decrease in bond prices from the time of issue. 
 
A bond’s  
conversion value equals the value it would have if you converted it into stock 
immediately. Clearly, a bond must sell for at least its conversion value. If it did not, you 
could purchase the bond, convert it, and clear an immediate profit. This condition could 
never persist, for all investors would pursue such a strategy and ultimately would bid up 
the price of the bond. 
 
The straight bond value, or “bond floor,” is the value the bond would have if it were not 
convertible into stock. The bond must sell for more than its straight bond value because 
a convertible bond has more value; it is in fact a straight bond plus a valuable call option. 
Therefore, the convertible bond has two lower bounds on its market price: the conversion 
value and the straight bond value.

Should a convertible bond issued at par value have a higher or lower 
coupon rate than a nonconvertible bond at par? 
 
 
Figure 20.12 illustrates the optionlike properties of the convertible bond.  
Figure 20.12 
A 
shows the value of the straight debt as a function of the stock price of the issuing firm. 
For healthy firms, the straight debt value is almost independent of the value of the stock 
because default risk is small. However, if the firm is close to bankruptcy (stock prices are 
low), default risk increases, and the straight bond value falls. Panel B shows the conversion 
value of the bond. Panel C compares the value of the convertible bond to these two lower 
bounds.

When stock prices are low, the straight bond value is the effective lower bound, and the 
conversion option is nearly irrelevant. The convertible will trade like straight debt. When 
stock prices are high, the bond’s price is determined by its conversion value. With conver-
sion all but guaranteed, the bond is essentially equity in disguise. 
 
We can illustrate with two examples:


 
C H A P T E R  2 0  Options Markets: Introduction 
693
Bond  
A has a conversion value of only $600. Its value as straight debt, in contrast, is 
$967. This is the present value of the coupon and principal payments at a market rate for 
straight debt of 8.5%. The bond’s price is $972, so the premium over straight bond value is 
only $5, reflecting the low probability of conversion. Its reported yield to maturity based 
on scheduled coupon payments and the market price of $972 is 8.42%, close to that of 
straight debt. 
 
The conversion option on bond  
B 
 is in the money. Conversion value is $1,250, and the 
bond’s price, $1,255, reflects its value as equity (plus $5 for the protection the bond offers 
against stock price declines). The bond’s reported yield is 4.76%, far below the compa-
rable yield on straight debt. The big yield sacrifice is attributable to the far greater value of 
the conversion option. 
 
In theory, we could value convertible bonds by treating them as straight debt plus call 
options. In practice, however, this approach is often impractical for several reasons:
 
1. The conversion price frequently increases over time, which means the exercise 
price of the option changes. 
 
 
2. Stocks may pay several dividends over the life of the bond, further complicating the 
option-valuation analysis. 
 
3. Most convertibles also are callable at the discretion of the firm. In essence, 
both the investor and the issuer hold options on each other. If the issuer exercises 
its call option to repurchase the bond, the bondholders typically have a month 
during which they still can convert. When issuers use a call option, knowing 
bondholders will choose to convert, the issuer is said to have  
forced a 
conversion. These conditions together mean the actual maturity of the bond 
is indeterminate. 
 
 
Warrants 
 
Warrants 
 are essentially call options issued by a firm. One important difference between 
calls and warrants is that exercise of a warrant requires the firm to issue a new share of 
stock—the total number of shares outstanding increases. Exercise of a call option requires 
only that the writer of the call deliver an already-issued share of stock to discharge the 
obligation. In that case, the number of shares outstanding remains fixed. Also unlike call 
options, warrants result in a cash flow to the firm when the warrant holder pays the exercise 
price. These differences mean that warrant values will differ somewhat from the  
values of 
call options with identical terms. 
 
Like convertible debt, warrant terms may be tailored to meet the needs of the firm. Also 
like convertible debt, warrants generally are protected against stock splits and dividends 
in that the exercise price and the number of warrants held are adjusted to offset the effects 
of the split. 
 
Warrants are often issued in conjunction with another security. Bonds, for example, 
may be packaged together with a warrant “sweetener,” frequently a warrant that may be 
sold separately. This is called a  
detachable warrant. 
 
Issue of warrants and convertible securities creates the potential for an increase in out-
standing shares of stock if exercise occurs. Exercise obviously would affect financial sta-
tistics that are computed on a per-share basis, so annual reports must provide earnings per 
share figures under the assumption that all convertible securities and warrants are exer-
cised. These figures are called  
fully diluted earnings per share. 
3

We should note that the exercise of a convertible bond need not reduce EPS. Diluted EPS will be less than undi-
luted EPS only if interest saved (per share) on the convertible bonds is less than the prior EPS.

The executive and employee stock options that became so popular in the last decade 
actually were warrants. Some of these grants were huge, with payoffs to top executives in 
excess of $100 million. Yet firms almost uniformly chose not to acknowledge these grants 
as expenses on their income statements until new reporting rules that took effect in 2006 
required such recognition. 
 
 
Collateralized Loans 
 
Many loan arrangements require that the borrower put up collateral to guarantee the loan 
will be paid back. In the event of default, the lender takes possession of the collateral. A 
nonrecourse loan gives the lender no recourse beyond the right to the collateral. That is, 
the lender may not sue the borrower for further payment if the collateral turns out not to be 
valuable enough to repay the loan. 
 
This arrangement gives an implicit call option to the borrower. Assume the borrower is 
obligated to pay back  
L dollars at the maturity of the loan. The collateral will be worth  
S 
 
T 
 
dollars at maturity. (Its value today is  
S 
0 
.) The borrower has the option to wait until loan 
maturity and repay the loan only if the collateral is worth more than the  
L dollars necessary 
to satisfy the loan. If the collateral is worth less than  
L, the borrower can default on the 
loan, discharging the obligation by forfeiting the collateral, which is worth only  
S 
 
T 
 
. 
4 
 
Another way of describing such a loan is to view the borrower as turning over the col-
lateral to the lender but retaining the right to reclaim it by paying off the loan. The transfer 
of the collateral with the right to reclaim it is equivalent to a payment of  
S 
0 dollars, less a 
simultaneous recovery of a sum that resembles a call option with exercise price  
L. In effect, 
the borrower turns over collateral but keeps an option to “repurchase” it for  
L dollars at the 
maturity of the loan if  
L turns out to be less than  
S 
 
T 
 
. This is a call option. 
 
A third way to look at a collateralized loan is to assume that the borrower will repay 
the  
L dollars with certainty but also retain the option to sell the collateral to the lender for 
 
L dollars, even if  
S 
 
T 
 is less than  
L. 
 In this case, the sale of the collateral would generate the 
cash necessary to satisfy the loan. The ability to “sell” the collateral for a price of  
L dollars 
represents a put option, which guarantees the borrower can raise enough money to satisfy 
the loan simply by turning over the collateral. 
 
It is perhaps surprising to realize that we can describe the same loan as involving either 
a put option or a call option, as the payoffs to calls and puts are so different. Yet the 
equivalence of the two approaches is nothing more than a reflection of the put-call parity 
relationship. In our call-option description of the loan, the value of the borrower’s liability 
is  
S 
0  
2  
C: The borrower turns over the asset, which is a transfer of  
S 
0 dollars, but retains 
a call worth  
C dollars. In the put-option description, the borrower is obligated to pay 
L dollars but retains the put, which is worth  
P: The present value of this net obligation is 
 
L 
/(1  
1  
r 
 
f 
 
) 
 
T 
  
2  
P. Because these alternative descriptions are equivalent ways of viewing the 
same loan, the value of the obligations must be equal:
 
S0 2 C 5
L
(1 1 rf)T 2 P 
 
(20.3) 
Treating  
L as the exercise price of the option,  
Equation 20.3 is simply the put-call parity 
relationship. 
 
4 
In reality, of course, defaulting on a loan is not so simple. There are losses of reputation involved as well as 
considerations of ethical behavior. This is a description of a pure nonrecourse loan where both parties agree from 
the outset that only the collateral backs the loan and that default is not to be taken as a sign of bad faith if the col-
lateral is insufficient to repay the loan.

Levered Equity and Risky Debt 
 
Investors holding stock in incorporated firms are protected by limited liability, which 
means that if the firm cannot pay its debts, the firm’s creditors may attach only the firm’s 
assets, not sue the corporation’s equityholders for further payment. In effect, any time the 
corporation borrows money, the maximum possible collateral for the loan is the total of 
the firm’s assets. If the firm declares bankruptcy, we can interpret this as an admission that 
the assets of the firm are insufficient to satisfy the claims against it. The corporation may 
discharge its obligations by transferring ownership of the firm’s assets to the creditors. 
 
Just as is true for nonrecourse collateralized loans, the required payment to the credi-
tors represents the exercise price of the implicit option, while the value of the firm is the 
underlying asset. The equityholders have a put option to transfer their ownership claims on 
the firm to the creditors in return for the face value of the firm’s debt. 
 
Alternatively, we may view the equityholders as retaining a call option. They have, 
in effect, already transferred their ownership claim to the firm to the creditors but have 
retained the right to reacquire that claim by paying off the loan. Hence the equityholders 
have the option to “buy back” the firm for a specified price: They have a call option. 
 
The significance of this observation is that analysts can value corporate bonds using 
option-pricing techniques. The default premium required of risky debt in principle can be 
estimated by using option-valuation models. We consider some of these models in the next 
chapter. 
 20.6 Financial Engineering 
 
One of the attractions of options is the ability they provide to create investment positions 
with payoffs that depend in a variety of ways on the values of other securities. We have 
seen evidence of this capability in the various options strategies examined in  
Section 20.4 
. 
 
Options also can be used to 
custom-design new securities or 
portfolios with desired patterns 
of exposure to the price of an 
underlying security. In this sense, 
options (and futures contracts, to 
be discussed in Chapters 22 and 
23) provide the ability to engage 
in  
financial engineering, the cre-
ation of portfolios with specified 
payoff patterns. 
 
A simple example of a prod-
uct engineered with options is 
the index-linked certificate of 
deposit. Index-linked CDs enable 
retail investors to take small posi-
tions in index options. Unlike 
conventional CDs, which pay a 
fixed rate of interest, these CDs 
pay depositors a specified frac-
tion of the rate of return on a mar-
ket index such as the S&P 500,

Return on index-linked CD 


 
C H A P T E R  2 0  Options Markets: Introduction 
697
while guaranteeing a minimum rate of return should the market fall. For example, the index-
linked CD may offer 70% of any market increase, but protect its holder from any market 
decrease by guaranteeing at least no loss. 
 
The index-linked CD is clearly a type of call option. If the market rises, the depositor 
profits according to the  
participation rate or  
multiplier, in this case 70%; if the market 
falls, the investor is insured against loss. Just as clearly, the bank offering these CDs is in 
effect writing call options and can hedge its position by buying index calls in the options 
market.  
Figure 20.14 
 shows the nature of the bank’s obligation to its depositors. 
 
How might the bank set the appropriate multiplier? To answer this, note various fea-
tures of the option:
 
1. The price the depositor is paying for the options is the forgone interest on the 
conventional CD that could be purchased. Because interest is received at the end 
of the period, the present value of the interest payment on each dollar invested is 
 
r 
 
f  
 
/(1  
1  
r 
 
f 
 
). Therefore, the depositor trades a sure payment with present value per 
dollar invested of  
r 
 
f  
 
/(1  
1  
r 
 
f 
 
) for a return that depends on the market’s performance. 
Conversely, the bank can fund its obligation using the interest that it would have 
paid on a conventional CD. 
 
2. The option we have described is an at-the-money option, meaning that the exercise 
price equals the current value of the stock index. The option goes into the money as 
soon as the market index increases from its level at the inception of the contract. 
 
3. We can analyze the option on a per-dollar-invested basis. For example, the option 
costs the depositor  
r 
 
f  
 
/(1  
1  
r 
 
f 
 
) dollars per dollar placed in the index-linked CD. The 
market price of the option per dollar invested is  
C 
/ 
S 
0 
: The at-the-money option 
costs  
C dollars and is written on one unit of the market index, currently at  
S 
0 
. 
 
Now it is easy to determine the multiplier that the bank can offer on the CDs. It receives 
from its depositors a “payment” of  
r 
 
f  
 
/(1  
1  
r 
 
f 
 
) per dollar invested. It costs the bank  
C 
/ 
S 
0 to 
purchase the call option on a $1 investment in the market index. Therefore, if  
r 
 
f  
 
/(1  
1  
r 
 
f 
 
) 
is, for example, 70% of  
C 
/ 
S 
0 
, the bank can purchase at most .7 call option on the $1 invest-
ment and the multiplier will be .7. More generally, the break-even multiplier on an index-
linked CD is  
r 
 
f  
 
/(1  
1  
r 
 
f 
 
) divided by  
C 
/ 
S 
0 
. 
 
Example 20.7 
 
 
Indexed-Linked CDs 
 
Suppose that  
r 
 
f 
  
5 6% per year, and that 6-month maturity at-the-money calls on the 
market index currently cost $50. The index is at 1,000. Then the option costs 
50/1,000  
5 $.05 per dollar of market value. The CD rate is 3% per 6 months, meaning 
that  
r 
 
f  
 
/(1  
1  
r 
 
f 
 
)  
5 .03/1.03  
5 .0291. Therefore, the multiplier would be .0291/.05  
5 .5825. 
 
The index-linked CD has several variants. Investors can purchase similar CDs that guar-
antee a positive minimum return if they are willing to settle for a smaller multiplier. In this 
case, the option is “purchased” by the depositor for ( 
r 
 
f 
  
2  
r 
min 
)/(1  
1  
r 
 
f 
 
) dollars per dol-
lar invested, where  
r 
min is the guaranteed minimum return. Because the purchase price is 
lower, fewer options can be purchased, which results in a lower multiplier. Another variant 
of the “bullish” CD we have described is the  
bear CD, which pays depositors a fraction of 
any  
fall in the market index. For example, a bear CD might offer a rate of return of .6 times 
any percentage decline in the S&P 500.

Continue to assume that

5 3% per half-year, that at-the-money calls sell for $50, and that 
the market index is at 1,000. What would be the multiplier for 6-month bullish equity-linked 
CDs offering a guaranteed minimum return of .5% over the term of the CD? 
 
 
Options markets have been tremendously successful. Investors clearly value the portfolio 
strategies made possible by trading options; this is reflected in the heavy trading volume 
in these markets. Success breeds imitation, and in recent years we have witnessed con-
siderable innovation in the range of option instruments available to investors. Part of this 
innovation has occurred in the market for customized options, which now trade in active 
over-the-counter markets. Many of these options have terms that would have been highly 
unusual even a few years ago; they are therefore called “exotic options.” In this section we 
survey some of the more interesting variants of these new instruments. 
 
Asian Options 
 
You already have been introduced to American- and European-style options. Asian-style 
options are options with payoffs that depend on the  
average price of the underlying asset 
during at least some portion of the life of the option. For example, an Asian call option 
may have a payoff equal to the average stock price over the last 3 months minus the strike 
price if that value is positive, and zero otherwise. These options may be of interest, for 
example, to firms that wish to hedge a profit stream that depends on the average price of a 
commodity over some period of time. 
 
Barrier Options 
 
Barrier options have payoffs that depend not only on some asset price at option expiration, 
but also on whether the underlying asset price has crossed through some “barrier.” For 
example, a down-and-out option is one type of barrier option that automatically expires 
worthless if and when the stock price falls below some barrier price. Similarly, down-and-
in options will not provide a payoff unless the stock price  
does fall below some barrier at 
least once during the life of the option. These options also are referred to as knock-out and 
knock-in options. 
 
 
Lookback Options 
 
Lookback options have payoffs that depend in part on the minimum or maximum price 
of the underlying asset during the life of the option. For example, a lookback call option 
might provide a payoff equal to the  
maximum stock price during the life of the option 
minus the exercise price, instead of the  
final stock price minus the exercise price. Such 
an option provides (for a price, of course) a form of perfect market timing, providing the 
call holder with a payoff equal to the one that would accrue if the asset were purchased for 
 
X dollars and later sold at what turns out to be its high price. 
 
Currency-Translated Options 
 
Currency-translated options have either asset or exercise prices denominated in a foreign 
currency. A good example of such an option is the  
quanto, which allows an investor to fix

699
in advance the exchange rate at which an investment in a foreign currency can be converted 
back into dollars. The right to translate a fixed amount of foreign currency into dollars at 
a given exchange rate is a simple foreign exchange option. Quantos are more interesting, 
however, because the amount of currency that will be translated into dollars depends on 
the investment performance of the foreign security. Therefore, a quanto in effect provides 
a  
random number of options. 
 
Digital Options 
 
Digital options, also called binary or “bet” options, have fixed payoffs that depend on 
whether a condition is satisfied by the price of the underlying asset. For example, a digital 
call option might pay off a fixed amount of $100 if the stock price at maturity exceeds the 
exercise price. 
 
1. A call option is the right to buy an asset at an agreed-upon exercise price. A put option is the right 
to sell an asset at a given exercise price. 
 
2. American-style options allow exercise on or before the expiration date. European options allow 
exercise only on the expiration date. Most traded options are American in nature. 
 
3. Options are traded on stocks, stock indexes, foreign currencies, fixed-income securities, and sev-
eral futures contracts. 
 
 
4. Options can be used either to lever up an investor’s exposure to an asset price or to provide insur-
ance against volatility of asset prices. Popular option strategies include covered calls, protective 
puts, straddles, spreads, and collars. 
 
 
5. The put-call parity theorem relates the prices of put and call options. If the relationship is vio-
lated, arbitrage opportunities will result. Specifically, the relationship that must be satisfied is
 
P 5 C 2 S0 1 PV(X) 1 PV(dividends) 
  where  
X is the exercise price of both the call and the put options, PV( 
X 
) is the present value of a 
claim to  
X dollars to be paid at the expiration date of the options, and PV(dividends) is the present 
value of dividends to be paid before option expiration. 
 
6. Many commonly traded securities embody option characteristics. Examples of these securities 
are callable bonds, convertible bonds, and warrants. Other arrangements such as collateralized 
loans and limited-liability borrowing can be analyzed as conveying implicit options to one or 
more parties. 
 
 
7. Trading in so-called exotic options now takes place in an active over-the-counter market.

KEY TERMS


 
IN THE PREVIOUS 
 chapter we examined option 
markets and strategies. We noted that many 
securities contain embedded options that affect 
both their values and their risk–return charac-
teristics. In this chapter, we turn our attention 
to option-valuation issues. To understand most 
option-valuation models requires considerable 
mathematical and statistical background. Still, 
many of the ideas and insights of these models 
can be demonstrated in simple examples, and 
we will concentrate on these. 
 
We start with a discussion of the factors 
that ought to affect option prices. After 
this discussion, we present several bounds 
within which option prices must lie. Next we 
turn to quantitative models, starting with a 
simple “two-state” option-valuation model, 
and then showing how this approach can be 
generalized into a useful and accurate pric-
ing tool. We then move on to one particular 
valuation formula, the famous Black-Scholes 
model, one of the most significant break-
throughs in finance theory in several decades. 
Finally, we look at some of the more impor-
tant applications of option-pricing theory in 
portfolio management and control. 
 
Option-pricing models allow us to “back 
out” market estimates of stock-price volatil-
ity, and we will examine these measures of 
implied volatility. Next we turn to some of 
the more important applications of option- 
pricing theory in risk management. Finally, we 
take a brief look at some of the empirical evi-
dence on option pricing, and the implications 
of that evidence concerning the li 
mitations of 
the Black-Scholes model.

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
 21.1 Option Valuation: Introduction 
 
Intrinsic and Time Values 
 
Consider a call option that is out of the money at the moment, with the stock price below 
the exercise price. This does not mean the option is valueless. Even though immediate 
exercise today would be unprofitable, the call retains a positive value because there is 
always a chance the stock price will increase sufficiently by the expiration date to allow 
for profitable exercise. If not, the worst that can happen is that the option will expire with 
zero value. 


712 
P A R T  V I  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives
 
The value  
S 
0  
2  
X is sometimes called the  
 
intrinsic value of in-the-money call options 
because it gives the payoff that could be obtained by immediate exercise. Intrinsic value is 
set equal to zero for out-of-the-money or at-the-money options. The difference between the 
actual call price and the intrinsic value is commonly called the  
 
time value of the option. 
 
“Time value” is an unfortunate choice of terminology, because it may confuse the 
option’s time value with the time value of money. Time value in the options context refers 
simply to the difference between the option’s price and the value the option would have if 
it were expiring immediately. It is the part of the option’s value that may be attributed to 
the fact that it still has positive time to expiration. 
 
Most of an option’s time value typically is a type of “volatility value.” Because the 
option holder can choose not to exercise, the payoff cannot be worse than zero. Even if a 
call option is out of the money now, it still will sell for a positive price because it offers the 
potential for a profit if the stock price increases, while imposing no risk of additional loss 
should the stock price fall. The volatility value lies in the value of the right  
not to exercise 
the call if that action would be unprofitable. The option to exercise, as opposed to the obli-
gation to exercise, provides insurance against poor stock price performance. 
 
As the stock price increases substantially, it becomes likely that the call option will 
be exercised by expiration. Ultimately, with exercise all but assured, the volatility value 
becomes minimal. As the stock price gets ever larger, the option value approaches the 
“adjusted” intrinsic value, the stock price minus the present value of the exercise price, 
 
S 
0  
2 PV( 
X 
). 
 
Why should this be? If you are virtually certain the option will be exercised and the 
stock purchased for  
X dollars, it is as though you own the stock already. The stock cer-
tificate, with a value today of  
S 
0 
, might as well be sitting in your safe-deposit box now, 
as it will be there in only a few months. You just haven’t paid for it yet. The present 
value of your obligation is the present value of  
X, so the net value of the call option is 
 
S 
0  
2 PV( 
X 
). 
1 
 
 
 
Figure 21.1 illustrates the call option valuation function. The value curve shows that 
when the stock price is very low, the option is nearly worthless, because there is almost 
no chance that it will be exercised. When the stock price is very high, the option value 
approaches adjusted intrinsic value. In the midrange case, where the option is approxi-
mately at the money, the option curve diverges from the straight lines corresponding to 
adjusted intrinsic value. This is because although exercise today would have a negligible 
(or negative) payoff, the volatility value of the option is quite high in this region. 
 
The call always increases in value with the stock price. The slope is greatest, however, 
when the option is deep in the money. In this case, exercise is all but assured, and the 
option increases in price one-for-one with the stock price. 
 
Determinants of Option Values 
 
We can identify at least six factors that should affect the value of a call option: the stock 
price, the exercise price, the volatility of the stock price, the time to expiration, the inter-
est rate, and the dividend rate of the stock. The call option should increase in value with 
the stock price and decrease in value with the exercise price because the payoff to a call, 
 
1 
This discussion presumes that the stock pays no dividends until after option expiration. If the stock does pay 
dividends before expiration, then there  
is a reason you would care about getting the stock now rather than at 
expiration—getting it now entitles you to the interim dividend payments. In this case, the adjusted intrinsic value 
of the option must subtract the value of the dividends the stock will pay out before the call is exercised. Adjusted 
intrinsic value would more generally be defined as  
S 
0  
2 PV( 
X 
)  
2 PV( 
D 
), where  
D is the dividend to be paid 
before option expiration.

if exercised, equals

X. The magnitude of the expected payoff from the call increases 
with the difference

Call option values also increase with the volatility of the underlying stock price. To see 
why, consider circumstances where possible stock prices at expiration may range from $10 
to $50 compared to a situation where stock prices may range only from $20 to $40. In both 
cases, the expected, or average, stock price will be $30. Suppose the exercise price on a 
call option is also $30. What are the option payoffs?

If each outcome is equally likely, with probability .2, the expected payoff to the option 
under high-volatility conditions will be $6, but under low-volatility conditions the expected 
payoff to the call option is half as much, only $3. 
 
Despite the fact that the average stock price in each scenario is $30, the average option 
payoff is greater in the high-volatility scenario. The source of this extra value is the limited 
loss an option holder can suffer, or the volatility value of the call. No matter how far below

$30 the stock price drops, the option holder will get zero. Obviously, extremely poor stock 
price performance is no worse for the call option holder than moderately poor performance. 
 
In the case of good stock performance, however, the call option will expire in the 
money, and it will be more profitable the higher the stock price. Thus extremely good 
stock outcomes can improve the option payoff without limit, but extremely poor outcomes 
c 
annot worsen the payoff below zero. This asymmetry means that volatility in the underly-
ing stock price increases the expected payoff to the option, thereby enhancing its value. 
2 
 
Similarly, longer time to expiration increases the value of a call option. For more distant 
expiration dates, there is more time for unpredictable future events to affect prices, and the 
range of likely stock prices increases. This has an effect similar to that of increased volatil-
ity. Moreover, as time to expiration lengthens, the present value of the exercise price falls, 
thereby benefiting the call option holder and increasing the option value. As a corollary 
to this issue, call option values are higher when interest rates rise (holding the stock price 
constant) because higher interest rates also reduce the present value of the exercise price. 
 
Finally, the dividend payout policy of the firm affects option values. A high-dividend 
payout policy puts a drag on the rate of growth of the stock price. For any expected 
total rate of return on the stock, a higher dividend yield must imply a lower expected 
rate of capital gain. This drag on 
stock price appreciation decreases 
the potential payoff from the call 
option, thereby lowering the call 
value.  
Table 21.1 summarizes these 
relationships. 
 
 
Several quantitative models of option pricing have been devised, and we will examine 
some of them later in this chapter. All models, however, rely on simplifying assumptions. 
You might wonder which properties of option values are truly general and which depend on 
the particular simplifications. To start with, we will consider some of the more im 
portant 
2 
You should be careful interpreting the relationship between volatility and option value. Neither the focus of this 
analysis on total (as opposed to systematic) volatility nor the conclusion that options buyers seem to like volatil-
ity contradicts modern portfolio theory. In conventional discounted cash flow analysis, we find the discount rate 
appropriate for a  
given distribution of future cash flows. Greater risk implies a higher discount rate and lower 
present value. Here, however, the cash flow from the  
option depends on the volatility of the  
stock. The option 
value increases not because traders like risk but because the expected cash flow to the option holder increases 
along with the volatility of the underlying asset.

general properties of option prices. Some of these properties have important implications 
for the effect of stock dividends on option values and the possible profitability of early 
exercise of an American option. 
 
Restrictions on the Value of a Call Option 
 
The most obvious restriction on the value of a call option is that its value cannot be nega-
tive. Because the option need not be exercised, it cannot impose any liability on its holder; 
moreover, as long as there is any possibility that at some point the option can be exercised 
profitably, the option will command a positive price. Its payoff is zero at worst, and pos-
sibly positive, so that investors are willing to pay some amount to purchase it. 
 
We can place another lower bound on the value of a call option. Suppose that the stock 
will pay a dividend of  
D dollars just before the expiration date of the option, denoted by 
 
T (where today is time 0). Now compare two portfolios, one consisting of a call option on 
one share of stock and the other a leveraged equity position consisting of that share and 
borrowing of (

D 
)/(1

 dollars. The loan repayment is  
X  
1  
D dollars, due on the 
expiration date of the option. For example, for a half-year maturity option with exercise 
price $70, dividends to be paid of $5, and effective annual interest of 10%, you would pur-
chase one share of stock and borrow $75/(1.10) 
1/2  
5 $71.51. In 6 months, when the loan 
matures, the payment due is $75. 
 
At that time, the payoff to the leveraged equity position would be

 denotes the stock price at the option expiration date. Notice that the payoff to the 
stock is the ex-dividend stock value plus dividends received. Whether the total payoff to 
the stock-plus-borrowing position is positive or negative depends on whether

 exceeds  
X.

otherwise. Thus the option payoff is equal to the leveraged equity payoff when that payoff 
is positive and is greater when the leveraged equity position has a negative payoff. Because 
the option payoff is always greater than or equal to that of the leveraged equity position, 
the option price must exceed the cost of establishing that position.

demonstrates 
graphically 
the range of prices that is ruled out by these 
upper and lower bounds for the value of a call 
option. Any option value outside the shaded

tions we have derived. Before expiration, the 
call option value normally will be  
within the 
allowable range, touching neither the upper 
nor lower bound, as in  
Figure 21.3

Early Exercise and Dividends 
 
A call option holder who wants to close out 
that position has two choices: exercise the call 
or sell it. If the holder exercises at time  
t, the 
call will provide a payoff of  
S 
 
t

of course, that the option is in the money. We

PV 
(

). Because the present 
value of  
X is less than  
X itself, it follows that
 
C $ St 2 PV(X) . St 2 X 
 
The implication here is that the proceeds 
from a sale of the option (at price  
C 
) must 
exceed the proceeds from an exercise ( 
S 
 
t 
  
2  
X 
). 
It is economically more attractive to sell the 
call, which keeps it alive, than to exercise and 
thereby end the option. In other words, calls 
on non-dividend-paying stocks are “worth 
more alive than dead.” 
 
If it never pays to exercise a call option 
before expiration, the right to exercise early 
actually must be valueless. The right to exer-
cise an American call early is irrelevant 
because it will never pay to exercise early. We 
therefore conclude that the values of otherwise 
identical American and European call options 
on stocks paying no dividends are equal. If we 
can find the value for the European call, we 
also will have found the value of the American 
call. This simplifies matters, because any valu-
ation formula that applies to the European call, 
for which only one exercise date need be con-
sidered, also must apply to an American call. 
 
As most stocks do pay dividends, you may wonder whether this result is just a theoreti-
cal curiosity. It is not: Reconsider our argument and you will see that all that we really 
require is that the stock pay no dividends  
until the option expires. 
 This condition will be 
true for many real-world options.

CHAPTER 21  Option Valuation

Early Exercise of American Puts 
 
For American  
put options, the optimality of early exercise is most definitely a possibil-
ity. To see why, consider a simple example. Suppose that you purchase a put option on a 
stock. Soon the firm goes bankrupt, and the stock price falls to zero. Of course you want 
to exercise now, because the stock price can fall no lower. Immediate exercise gives you 
immediate receipt of the exercise price, which can be invested to start generating income. 
Delay in exercise means a time-value-of-money cost. The right to exercise a put option 
before expiration must have value. 
 
Now suppose instead that the firm is only  
nearly bankrupt, with the stock selling at just 
a few cents. Immediate exercise may still be optimal. After all, the stock price can fall by 
only a very small amount, meaning that the proceeds from future exercise cannot be more 
than a few cents greater than the proceeds from immediate exercise. Against this possibil-
ity of a tiny increase in proceeds must be weighed the time-value-of-money cost of defer-
ring exercise. Clearly, there is some stock price below which early exercise is optimal. 
 
This argument also proves that the American put must be worth more than its European 
counterpart. The American put allows you to exercise anytime before expiration. Because 
the right to exercise early may be useful in some circumstances, it will command a pre-
mium in the capital market. The American put therefore will sell for a higher price than a 
European put with otherwise identical terms. 
 
Figure 21.4 
A illustrates the value of an American put option as a function of the current 
stock price,  
S 
0 
. Once the stock price drops below a critical value, denoted  
S 
* in the figure, 
exercise becomes optimal. At that point the option-pricing curve is tangent to the straight 
line depicting the intrinsic value of the option. If and when the stock price reaches  
S 
*, the 
put option is exercised and its payoff equals its intrinsic value. 
 
In contrast, the value of the European put, which is graphed in  
Figure 21.4 
B, is not 
asymptotic to the intrinsic value line. Because early exercise is prohibited, the maximum 
value of the European put is PV( 
X 
), which occurs at the point  
S 
0  
5 0. Obviously, for a long 
enough horizon, PV( 
X 
) can be made arbitrarily small.

 21.3 Binomial Option Pricing 
 
Two-State Option Pricing 
 
A complete understanding of commonly used option-valuation formulas is difficult with-
out a substantial mathematics background. Nevertheless, we can develop valuable insight 
into option valuation by considering a simple special case. Assume that a stock price can 
take only two possible values at option expiration: The stock will either increase to a given 
higher price or decrease to a given lower price. Although this may seem an extreme simpli-
fication, it allows us to come closer to understanding more complicated and realistic mod-
els. Moreover, we can extend this approach to describe far more reasonable specifications 
of stock price behavior. In fact, several major financial firms employ variants of this simple 
model to value options and securities with optionlike features. 
 
Suppose the stock now sells at  
S 
0  
5 $100, and the price will either increase by a factor 
of  
u  
5 1.20 to $120 ( 
u stands for “up”) or fall by a factor of  
d  
5 .9 to $90 ( 
d stands for 
“down”) by year-end. A call option on the stock might specify an exercise price of $110 
and a time to expiration of 1 year. The interest rate is 10%. At year-end, the payoff to the 
holder of the call option will be either zero, if the stock falls, or $10, if the stock price goes 
to $120. 
 
These possibilities are illustrated by the following value “trees”: 
 
120

  90

Stock price 
Call option value
Compare the payoff of the call to that of a portfolio consisting of one share of the 
stock and borrowing of $81.82 at the interest rate of 10%. The payoff of this portfolio also 
depends on the stock price at year-end:
 Value of stock at year-end
$90
$120
2 Repayment of loan with interest
290
290
  TOTAL
$  0
$  30
 
We know the cash outlay to establish the portfolio is $18.18: $100 for the stock, less the 
$81.82 proceeds from borrowing. Therefore the portfolio’s value tree is 
 
30
 
18.18
 
  
0
 
The payoff of this portfolio is exactly three times that of the call option for either value 
of the stock price. In other words, three call options will exactly replicate the payoff to the 
portfolio; it follows that three call options should have the same price as the cost of estab-
lishing the portfolio. Hence the three calls should sell for the same price as this  
replicating 
portfolio. Therefore,
 
3C 5 $18.18 
or each call should sell at  
C  
5 $6.06. Thus, given the stock price, exercise price, interest 
rate, and volatility of the stock price (as represented by the magnitude of the up or down 
movements), we can derive the fair value for the call option. 


 
CHAPTER 21  Option Valuation 
719
 
This valuation approach relies heavily on the notion of replication. With only two pos-
sible end-of-year values of the stock, the payoffs to the levered stock portfolio replicate the 
payoffs to three call options and, therefore, command the same market price. Replication is 
behind most option-pricing formulas. For more complex price distributions for stocks, the 
replication technique is correspondingly more complex, but the principles remain the same. 
 
One way to view the role of replication is to note that, using the numbers assumed for 
this example, a portfolio made up of one share of stock and three call options written is 
perfectly hedged. Its year-end value is independent of the ultimate stock price:
  Stock value
$90
$120
2 Obligations from 3 calls written
20
230
  Net payoff
$90
$  90
The investor has formed a riskless portfolio, with a payout of $90. Its value must be the 
present value of $90, or $90/1.10  
5 $81.82. The value of the portfolio, which equals $100 
from the stock held long, minus 3 
C from the three calls written, should equal $81.82. 
Hence $100  
2 3 
C  
5 $81.82, or  
C  
5 $6.06. 
 
The ability to create a perfect hedge is the key to this argument. The hedge locks in the 
end-of-year payout, which therefore can be discounted using the  
risk-free interest rate. To 
find the value of the option in terms of the value of the stock, we do not need to know either 
the option’s or the stock’s beta or expected rate of return. The perfect hedging, or replica-
tion, approach enables us to express the value of the option in terms of the current value 
of the stock without this information. With a hedged position, the final stock price does 
not affect the investor’s payoff, so the stock’s risk and return parameters have no bearing. 
 
The hedge ratio of this example is one share of stock to three calls, or one-third. 
For every call option written, one-third share of stock must be held in the portfolio to 
hedge away risk. This ratio has an easy interpretation in this context: It is the ratio of the 
range of the values of the option to those of the stock across the two possible outcomes. 
The stock, which originally sells for  
S 
0  
5 100, will be worth either  
d  
3 $100  
5 $90 or 
 
u  
3 $100  
5 $120, for a range of $30. If the stock price increases, the call will be worth 
 
C 
 
u 
  
5 $10, whereas if the stock price decreases, the call will be worth  
C 
 
d 
  
5 0, for a range of 
$10. The ratio of ranges, 10/30, is one-third, which is the hedge ratio we have established. 
 
The hedge ratio equals the ratio of ranges because the option and stock are perfectly 
correlated in this two-state example. Because they are perfectly correlated, a perfect hedge 
requires that the option and stock be held in a fraction determined only by relative volatility. 
 
We can generalize the hedge ratio for other two-state option problems as
 
H 5 Cu 2 Cd
uS0 2 dS0
 
where  
C 
 
u 
 or  
C 
 
d 
 refers to the call option’s value when the stock goes up or down, r 
espectively, 
and  
uS 
0 and  
dS 
0 are the stock prices in the two states. The hedge ratio,  
H, is the ratio of 
the swings in the possible end-of-period values of the option and the stock. If the investor 
writes one option and holds  
H shares of stock, the value of the portfolio will be unaffected 
by the stock price. In this case, option pricing is easy: Simply set the value of the hedged 
portfolio equal to the present value of the known payoff. 
 
Using our example, the option-pricing technique would proceed as follows: 
 
1. Given the possible end-of-year stock prices,  
uS 
0  
5 120 and  
dS

What if the option is overpriced, perhaps selling for $6.50? Then you can make arbi-
trage profits. Here is how:

Although the net initial investment is zero, the payoff in 1 year is positive and riskless. 
If the option were underpriced, one would simply reverse this arbitrage strategy: Buy the 
option, and sell the stock short to eliminate price risk. Note, by the way, that the present 
value of the profit to the arbitrage strategy above exactly equals three times the amount by 
which the option is overpriced. The present value of the risk-free profit of $1.45 at a 10% 
interest rate is $1.318. With three options written in the strategy above, this translates to 
a profit of $.44 per option, exactly the amount by which the option was overpriced: $6.50 
versus the “fair value” of $6.06.

Suppose the call option had been underpriced, selling at $5.50. Formulate the arbitrage 
strategy to exploit the mispricing, and show that it provides a riskless cash flow in 1 year 
of $.6167 per option purchased. Compare the present value of this cash flow to the option 
mispricing. 
 
 
Generalizing the Two-State Approach 
 
Although the two-state stock price model seems simplistic, we can generalize it to incor-
porate more realistic assumptions. To start, suppose we were to break up the year into two 
6-month segments, and then assert that over each half-year segment the stock price could 
take on two values. We will say it can increase 10% (i.e.,  
u  
5 1.10) or decrease 5% (i.e., 
 
d  
5 .95). A stock initially selling at 100 could follow these possible paths over the course 
of the year:

CHAPTER 21  Option Valuation

The midrange value of 104.50 can be attained by two paths: an increase of 10% followed 
by a decrease of 5%, or a decrease of 5% followed by a 10% increase. 
 
There are now three possible end-of-year values for the stock and three for the option:

. And there is no reason to stop at 6-month intervals. We 
could next break the year into four 3-month units, or twelve 1-month units, or 365 1-day 
units, each of which would be posited to have a two-state process. Although the calcula-
tions become quite numerous and correspondingly tedious, they are easy to program into 
a computer, and such computer programs are used widely by participants in the options 
market.

Next we find the value of  
C 
 
d 
 
. It is easy to see that this value must be zero. If we reach 
this point (corresponding to a stock price of $95), the stock price at option expiration will 
be either $104.50 or $90.25; in either case, the option will expire out of the money. (More 
formally, we could note that with

As we break the year into progressively finer subintervals, the range of possible year-
end stock prices expands and, in fact, will ultimately take on a familiar bell-shaped distri-
bution. This can be seen from an analysis of the event tree for the stock for a period with 
three subintervals: 
 
 
u3S0
 
u2S0
 
uS0 
u2dS0
 
S0 
udS0
 
dS0 
ud2S0
 
d2S0
 
d3S0
 
First, notice that as the number of subintervals increases, the number of possible stock 
prices also increases. Second, notice that extreme events such as  
u 
3 
S 
0 or  
d 
3 
S 
0 are relatively 
rare, as they require either three consecutive increases or decreases in the three subinter-
vals. More moderate, or midrange, results such as  
u 
2 
dS 
0 can be arrived at by more than one 
path—any combination of two price increases and one decrease will result in stock price 
 
u 
2 
dS 
0 
. Thus the midrange values will be more likely. The probability of each outcome is 
described by the binomial distribution, and this multiperiod approach to option pricing is 
therefore called the  
 
binomial model. 
 
For example, using an initial stock price of $100, equal probability of stock price 
increases or decreases, and three intervals for which the possible price increase is 20% 
and decrease is 10%, we can obtain the probability distribution of stock prices from the 
following calculations. There are eight possible combinations for the stock price move-
ments in the three periods:  
uuu,  
uud,  
udu,  
duu,  
udd,  
dud,  
ddu,  
ddd. Each has probability 
of 1⁄8. Therefore, the probability distribution of stock prices at the end of the last interval 
would be:

three. Because we now consider twice as many subintervals, we set the possible stock 
price increase in each to 20%/2  
5 
 10% and the possible decrease to 10%/2  
5 
 5%. The 
resulting frequency distribution, shown in  
Figure 21.5 
B, begins to resemble the familiar 
bell-shaped curve. In Panel C, we divide the holding period into 20 subintervals, and 
the distribution is now clearly bell shaped. However, observe that the right tail of the 
distribution in Panel C is noticeably longer than the left tail. In fact, as the number of 
intervals increases, the distribution progressively approaches the skewed log-normal 
(rather than the symmetric normal) distribution. Even if the stock price were to decline 
in  
each subinterval, it can never drop below zero. But there is no corresponding upper 
bound on its potential performance. This asymmetry gives rise to the skewness of the 
distribution. 
 
Eventually, as we divide the holding period into an ever-greater number of subintervals, 
each node of the event tree would correspond to an infinitesimally small time interval. 
The possible stock price movement within that time interval would be correspondingly 
small. As those many intervals passed, the end-of-period stock price would more and

more closely resemble a lognormal distribution. 
3 Thus the apparent oversimplification of 
the two-state model can be overcome by progressively subdividing any period into many 
subperiods. 
 
At any node, one still could set up a portfolio that would be perfectly hedged over 
the next tiny time interval. Then, at the end of that interval, on reaching the next node, 
a new hedge ratio could be computed and the portfolio composition could be revised to 
remain hedged over the coming small interval. By continuously revising the hedge posi-
tion, the portfolio would remain hedged and would earn a riskless rate of return over 
each interval. This is called  
dynamic hedging, the continued updating of the hedge ratio 
as time passes. As the dynamic hedge becomes ever finer, the resulting option-valuation 
procedure becomes more precise. 
 
 
Although the binomial model we have described is extremely flexible, a computer is 
needed for it to be useful in actual trading. An option-pricing  
formula would be far easier 
to use than the complex algorithm involved in the binomial model. It turns out that such a 
formula can be derived if one is willing to make just two more assumptions: that both the 
risk-free interest rate and stock price volatility are constant over the life of the option. In 
this case, as the time to expiration is divided into ever-more subperiods, the distribution 
of the stock price at expiration progressively approaches the lognormal distribution, as 
suggested by  
Figure 21.5 
. When the stock price distribution is actually lognormal, we can 
derive an exact option-pricing formula. 
 
The Black-Scholes Formula 
Financial economists searched for years for a workable option-pricing model before 
Black and Scholes 
 
4 and Merton 
5 derived a formula for the value of a call option. Scholes 
and Merton shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Economics for their accomplishment. 
 
6 Now 
 
3 
Actually, more complex considerations enter here. The limit of this process is lognormal only if we assume 
also that stock prices move continuously, by which we mean that over small time intervals only small price 
movements can occur. This rules out rare events such as sudden, extreme price moves in response to dramatic 
information (like a takeover attempt). For a treatment of this type of “jump process,” see John C. Cox and Stephen 
A. Ross, “The Valuation of Options for Alternative Stochastic Processes,”  
Journal of Financial Economics 3 
(January–March 1976), pp. 145–66, or Robert C. Merton, “Option Pricing When Underlying Stock Returns Are

Would you expect the hedge ratio to be higher or lower when the call option is more 
in the money? (Hint: Remember that the hedge ratio is the change in the option price 
divided by the change in the stock price. When is the option price most sensitive to 
the stock price?)

Standard deviation of the annualized continuously compounded rate of return 
of the stock. 
 
Notice a surprising feature of  
Equation 21.1 
: The option value does  
not depend on 
the expected rate of return on the stock. In a sense, this information is already built into 
the formula with the inclusion of the stock price, which itself depends on the stock’s risk 
and return characteristics. This version of the 
Black-Scholes formula is predicated on the 
assumption that the stock pays no dividends. 
 
Although you may find the Black-Scholes 
formula intimidating, we can explain it at 
a somewhat intuitive level. The trick is to 
view the  
N 
( 
d 
) terms (loosely) as risk-adjusted 
probabilities that the call option will expire 
in the money. First, look at  
Equation 21.1 
 
assuming both  
N 
( 
d 
) terms are close to 1.0, 
that is, when there is a very high probability 
the option will be exercised. Then the call 
option value is equal to  
S

Xe 
 
2

, which 
is what we called earlier the adjusted intrin-
sic value,

exercise is certain, we have a claim on a stock 
with c

, and an obligation with 
p 
resent value PV(

Now look at  
Equation 21.1 assuming the  
N 
( 
d 
) terms are close to zero, meaning the 
option almost certainly will not be exercised. Then the equation confirms that the call is 
worth nothing. For middle-range values of  
N 
( 
d 
) between 0 and 1,  
Equation 21.1 tells us 
that the call value can be viewed as the present value of the call’s potential payoff adjusting 
for the probability of in-the-money expiration. 
 
How do the  
N 
( 
d 
) terms serve as risk-adjusted probabilities? This question quickly leads 
us into advanced statistics. Notice, however, that ln( 
S 
0 
/ 
X 
), which appears in the numera-
tor of  
d 
1 and  
d 
2 
, is approximately the percentage amount by which the option is currently 
in or out of the money. For example, if  
S 
0  
5 105 and  
X  
5 100, the option is 5% in the 
money, and ln(105/100)  
5 .049. Similarly, if  
S 
0  
5 95, the option is 5% out of the money, 
and ln(95/100)  
5  
2 
.051. The denominator,  
s"T, adjusts the amount by which the option 
is in or out of the money for the volatility of the stock price over the remaining life of the 
option. An option in the money by a given percent is more likely to stay in the money 
if both stock price volatility and time to expiration are low. Therefore,  
N 
( 
d 
1 
) and  
N 
( 
d 
2 
) 
increase with the probability that the option will expire in the money.

P A R T  V I  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives
 
What if the option price in  
Example 21.2 were $15 rather than $13.70? Is the option 
mispriced? Maybe, but before betting your fortune on that, you may want to reconsider 
the valuation analysis. First, like all models, the Black-Scholes formula is based on some 
simplifying abstractions that make the formula only approximately valid. 
 
Some of the important assumptions underlying the formula are the following: 
 
1. The stock will pay no dividends until after the option expiration date. 
 
2. Both the interest rate,  
r, and variance rate,  
s 
2 
, of the stock are constant (or in 
slightly more general versions of the formula, both are  
known functions of time—
any changes are perfectly predictable). 
 
3. Stock prices are continuous, meaning that sudden extreme jumps such as those in 
the aftermath of an announcement of a takeover attempt are ruled out. 
 
Variants of the Black-Scholes formula have been developed to deal with many of these 
limitations. 
 
Second, even within the context of the Black-Scholes model, you must be sure of 
the accuracy of the parameters used in the formula. Four of these— 
S 
0 
,  
X,  
T, and  
r 
—are 
straightforward. The stock price, exercise price, and time to expiration are readily deter-
mined. The interest rate used is the money market rate for a maturity equal to that of the 
option, and the dividend payout is reasonably predictable, at least over short horizons. 
 
The last input, though, the standard deviation of the stock return, is not directly observ-
able. It must be estimated from historical data, from scenario analysis, or from the prices 
of other options, as we will describe momentarily. 
 
We saw in Chapter 5 that the historical variance of stock market returns can be calcu-
lated from  
n observations as follows:
 
s2 5
n
n 2 1 a
n
t51
(rt 2 r )2
n
 
where  
r is the average return over the sample period. The rate of return on day  
t is defined 
to be consistent with continuous compounding as  
r 
 
t 
  
5 ln( 
S 
 
t  
 
/ 
S 
 
t 
2 
1 
). [We note again that 
the natural logarithm of a ratio is approximately the percentage difference between the 
numerator and denominator so that ln( 
S 
 
t 
 
/ 
S 
 
t 
2 
1 
) is a measure of the rate of return of the 
stock from time  
t  
2 1 to time  
t. 
] Historical variance commonly is computed using daily 
returns over periods of several months. Because the volatility of stock returns must be 
estimated, however, it is always possible that discrepancies between an option price 
and its Black-Scholes value are simply artifacts of error in the estimation of the stock’s 
volatility. 
 
In fact, market participants often give the option-valuation problem a different twist. 
Rather than calculating a Black-Scholes option value for a given stock’s standard devia-
tion, they ask instead: What standard deviation would be necessary for the option price that 
I observe to be consistent with the Black-Scholes formula? This is called the  
 
implied vola-
tility of the option, the volatility level for the stock implied by the option price. 
7 Investors 
can then judge whether they think the actual stock standard deviation exceeds the implied 
volatility. If it does, the option is considered a good buy; if actual volatility seems greater 
than the implied volatility, its fair price would exceed the observed price. 
 
Another variation is to compare two options on the same stock with equal expiration 
dates but different exercise prices. The option with the higher implied volatility would be 
 
7 
This concept was introduced in Richard E. Schmalensee and Robert R. Trippi, “Common Stock Volatility 
Expectations Implied by Option Premia,”  
Journal of Finance 33 (March 1978), pp. 129–47. 


 
CHAPTER 21  Option Valuation 
729
considered relatively expensive, because a higher standard deviation is required to justify 
its price. The analyst might consider buying the option with the lower implied volatility 
and writing the option with the higher implied volatility. 
 
The Black-Scholes valuation formula, as well as implied volatilities, are easily calcu-
lated using an Excel spreadsheet like  
Spreadsheet 21.1 
. The model inputs are provided in 
column B, and the outputs are given in column E. The formulas for  
d 
1 and  
d 
2 are provided 
in the spreadsheet, and the Excel formula NORMSDIST( 
d 
1 
) is used to calculate  
N 
( 
d 
1 
). Cell 
E6 contains the Black-Scholes formula. (The formula in the spreadsheet actually includes 
an adjustment for dividends, as described in the next section.) 
 
To compute an implied volatility, we can use the Goal Seek command from the Tools 
menu in Excel. See  
Figure 21.7 for an illustration. Goal Seek asks us to change the value of 
one cell to make the value of another cell (called the target cell) equal to a specific value. 
For example, if we observe a call option selling for $7 with other inputs as given in the 
spreadsheet, we can use Goal Seek to change the value in cell B2 (the standard deviation of 
the stock) to set the option value in cell E6 equal to $7. The target cell, E6, is the call price, 
and the spreadsheet manipulates cell B2. When you click “OK,” the spreadsheet finds that

a standard deviation equal to .2783 is con-
sistent with a call price of $7; this would 
be the option’s implied volatility if it were 
selling at $7. 
 
The Chicago Board Options Exchange 
regularly computes the implied volatil-
ity of major stock indexes.  
Figure 21.8 
is a graph of the implied (30-day) vola-
tility of the S&P 500 since 1990. During 
periods of turmoil, implied volatility can 
spike quickly. Notice the peaks in January 
1991 (Gulf War), August 1998 (collapse 
of Long-Term Capital Management), 
September 11, 2001, 2002 (build-up to 
invasion of Iraq) and, most dramatically, 
during the credit crisis of 2008. Because 
implied volatility correlates with crisis, it is sometimes called an “investor fear gauge,” 
and, as the nearby box makes clear, observers use it to infer market assessments of the pos-
sibility of turmoil in coming months. 
 
In March 2004, a futures contract on the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500 
began trading on the CBOE Futures Exchange. The payoff of the contract depends on 
market implied volatility at the expiration of the contract. The ticker symbol of the con-
tract is VIX. 
 
Figure 21.8 also reveals an awkward empirical fact. While the Black-Scholes formula 
is derived assuming that stock volatility is constant, the time series of implied volatili-
ties derived from that formula is in fact far from constant. This contradiction reminds us 
that the Black-Scholes model (like all models) is a simplification that does not capture 
all aspects of real markets. In this particular context, extensions of the pricing model that 
allow stock volatility to evolve randomly over time would be desirable, and, in fact, many 
extensions of the model along these lines have been suggested. 
8 
 
 
The fact that volatility changes unpredictably means that it can be difficult to choose the 
proper volatility input to use in any option-pricing model. A considerable amount of recent 
research has been devoted to techniques to predict changes in volatility. These techniques, 
which go by the name ARCH and stochastic volatility models, posit that changes in vola-
tility are partially predictable and that by analyzing recent levels and trends in volatility, 
one can improve predictions of future volatility.

Dividends and Call Option Valuation 
 
We noted earlier that the Black-Scholes call option formula applies to stocks that do not 
pay dividends. When dividends are to be paid before the option expires, we need to adjust 
the formula. The payment of dividends raises the possibility of early exercise, and for most 
realistic dividend payout schemes the valuation formula becomes significantly more com-
plex than the Black-Scholes equation. 
 
We can apply some simple rules of thumb to approximate the option value, however. 
One popular approach, originally suggested by Black, calls for adjusting the stock price 
downward by the present value of any dividends that are to be paid before option expi-
ration. 
10 Therefore, we would simply replace  
S 
0 with  
S 
0  
2 PV(dividends) in the Black-
Scholes formula. Such an adjustment will take dividends into account by reflecting their 
eventual impact on the stock price. The option value then may be computed as before, 
assuming that the option will be held to expiration. 
 
In one special case, the dividend adjustment takes a simple form. Suppose the underly-
ing asset pays a continuous flow of income. This might be a reasonable assumption for 
options on a stock index, where different stocks in the index pay dividends on different 
days, so that dividend income arrives in a more or less continuous flow. If the dividend 
yield, denoted  
d, is constant, one can show that the present value of that dividend flow 
accruing until the option expiration date is  
S 
0 (1  
2  
e 
 
2 
d 
T 
 
). (For intuition, notice that  
e 
 
2 
d 
T 
 
approximately equals 1  
2  
d 
T, so the value of the dividend is approximately  
d

.) In this 
case,  
S

S

, and we can derive a Black-Scholes call option formula on 
the dividend-paying asset simply by substituting

2

 for  
S 
0 in the original formula. This 
approach is used in  
Spreadsheet 21.1 
. 
 
These procedures yield a very good approximation of option value for European call 
options that must be held until expiration, but they do not allow for the fact that the holder 
of an American call option might choose to exercise the option just before a dividend. The 
current value of a call option, assuming that the option will be exercised just before the ex-
dividend date, might be greater than the value of the option assuming it will be held until 
expiration. Although holding the option until expiration allows greater effective time to

The “Fear” Gauge Is Flashing Complacency 
 
Stock-market volatility is back to normal. That could imply 
more gains ahead, but more likely it means investors have 
gotten complacent. 
 
The most closely watched volatility measure, the 
Chicago Board Options Exchange’s VIX index, closed on 
Friday at 21.25, near its lowest level since August 2008 and 
near its historical average of 20.28. The VIX, which tracks 
volatility in S&P 500 options, spiked to more than 80 at 
the worst of the Lehman Brothers crisis, implying volatility 
unseen since at least the Great Depression. 
 
A rising VIX is usually associated with falling stock 
prices, one reason it is often called the “fear” index. It has 
retreated as the market has soared this year, and it could 
fall further in the short run. 
 
But volatility lives. One thing apparently bothering traders 
was the possibility that a stronger job market could lead the 
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than expected, 
snuffing this year’s easy-money-fueled market gains. 
 
But higher rates are only one of many threats to peace 
and quiet in the coming year. Among others: rising bank 
losses in commercial real estate and consumer credit, a 
housing market still oozing foreclosures, municipal and 
sovereign debt worries, soaring commodities prices and an 
economic recovery hampered by persistent unemployment 
and cautious consumer spending. 
 
Stocks can rise amid all kinds of turmoil. But the VIX 
appears to believe that things have returned to normal, 
and that is a stretch. 
 
“We’re going to have a sustained level of volatility 
going forward,” says Milton Balbuena, co–chief investment 
strategist at Contango Capital Advisors in San Francisco. 
“Rallies and meltdowns will be part of the process.”

P A R T  V I  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives
expiration, which increases the option value, it also entails more dividend payments, low-
ering the expected stock price at expiration and thereby lowering the current option value. 
 
For example, suppose that a stock selling at $20 will pay a $1 dividend in 4 months, 
whereas the call option on the stock does not expire for 6 months. The effective annual 
interest rate is 10%, so that the present value of the dividend is $1/(1.10) 
1/3  
5 $0.97. Black 
suggests that we can compute the option value in one of two ways: 
 
1. Apply the Black-Scholes formula assuming early exercise, thus using the actual stock 
price of $20 and a time to expiration of 4 months (the time until the dividend payment). 
 
2. Apply the Black-Scholes formula assuming no early exercise, using the dividend-
adjusted stock price of $20  
2 $.97  
5 $19.03 and a time to expiration of 6 months. 
 
The greater of the two values is the estimate of the option value, recognizing that 
early exercise might be optimal. In other words, the so-called  
 
pseudo-American call 
option value 
 is the maximum of the value derived by assuming that the option will be 
held until expiration and the value derived by assuming that the option will be exercised 
just before an ex-dividend date. Even this technique is not exact, however, for it assumes 
that the option holder makes an irrevocable decision now on when to exercise, when in 
fact the decision is not binding until exercise notice is given. 
 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Put Option Valuation 
 
We have concentrated so far on call option valuation. We can derive Black-Scholes 
European put option values from call option values using the put-call parity theorem. To 
value the put option, we simply calculate the value of the corresponding call option in 
 
Equation 21.1 from the Black-Scholes formula, and solve for the put option value as
 P 5 C 1 PV(X) 2 S0
 5 C 1 Xe2rT 2 S0 
(21.2)
We must calculate the present value of the exercise price using continuous compounding to 
be consistent with the Black-Scholes formula. 
 
Sometimes, it is easier to work with a put option valuation formula directly. If we sub-
stitute the Black-Scholes formula for a call in  
Equation 21.2 
, we obtain the value of a 
European put option as

(21.3)

An exact formula for American call valuation on dividend-paying stocks has been developed in Richard Roll, 
“An Analytic Valuation Formula for Unprotected American Call Options on Stocks with Known Dividends,” 
 
Journal of Financial Economics 5 (November 1977). The technique has been discussed and revised in Robert 
Geske, “A Note on an Analytical Formula for Unprotected American Call Options on Stocks with Known 
Dividends,”  
Journal of Financial Economics 7 (December 1979), and Robert E. Whaley, “On the Valuation of 
American Call Options on Stocks with Known Dividends,”  
Journal of Financial Economics 
 9 (June 1981). These 
are difficult papers, however.

Dividends and Put Option Valuation 
 
Equation 21.2 or  
21.3 is valid for European puts on non-dividend-paying stocks. As we did 
for call options, if the underlying asset pays a dividend, we can find European put values 
by substituting  
S 
0  
2 PV(Div) for  
S

However, listed put options on stocks are American options that offer the opportunity of 
early exercise, and we have seen that the right to exercise puts early can turn out to be valu-
able. This means that an American put option must be worth more than the corresponding 
European option. Therefore,  
Equation 21.2 or  
21.3 describes only the lower bound on the 
true value of the American put. However, in many applications the approximation is very 
accurate. 
12 
 21.5 Using the Black-Scholes Formula 
 
Hedge Ratios and the Black-Scholes Formula 
 
In the last chapter, we considered two investments in FinCorp stock: 100 shares or 1,000 
call options. We saw that the call option position was more sensitive to swings in the 
stock price than was the all-stock position. To analyze the overall exposure to a stock price 
more precisely, however, it is necessary to quantify these relative sensitivities. A tool that 
enables us to summarize the overall exposure of portfolios of options with various exercise 
prices and times to expiration is the hedge ratio. An option’s  
 
hedge ratio 
 is the change in 
the price of an option for a $1 increase in the stock price. A call option, therefore, has a 
positive hedge ratio and a put option a negative hedge ratio. The hedge ratio is commonly 
called the option’s  
 
delta. 
 
If you were to graph the option value as a function of the stock value, as we have done 
for a call option in  
Figure 21.9 
, the hedge ratio is simply the slope of the value curve evalu-
ated at the current stock price. For example, suppose the slope of the curve at  
S 
0  
5 $120 
equals .60. As the stock increases in value by $1, the option increases by approximately 
$.60, as the figure shows. 
 
For every call option written, .60 share of stock would be needed to hedge the investor’s 
portfolio. For example, if one writes 10 options and holds six shares of stock, according 
to the hedge ratio of .6, a $1 increase in stock price will result in a gain of $6 on the stock 
holdings, whereas the loss on the 10 options written will be 10  
3 $.60, an equivalent $6. 
The stock price movement leaves total wealth unaltered, which is what a hedged position is 
intended to do. The investor holding the stock and options in proportions dictated by their 
relative price movements hedges the portfolio.

Black-Scholes hedge ratios are particu-
larly easy to compute. The hedge ratio for 
a call is  
N 
( 
d 
1 
), whereas the hedge ratio for a 
put is  
N 
( 
d 
1 
)  
2 1. We defined  
N 
( 
d 
1 
) as part of 
the Black-Scholes formula in  
Equation 21.1 
. 
Recall that  
N 
( 
d 
) stands for the area under the 
standard normal curve up to  
d. Therefore, the 
call option hedge ratio must be positive and less 
than 1.0, whereas the put option hedge ratio is 
negative and of smaller absolute value than 1.0. 
 
Figure 21.9 verifies the insight that the 
slope of the call option valuation function 
is less than 1.0, approaching 1.0 only as the 
stock price becomes much greater than the 
exercise price. This tells us that option values 
change less than one-for-one with changes in 
stock prices. Why should this be? Suppose 
an option is so far in the money that you are 
absolutely certain it will be exercised. In that 
case, every dollar increase in the stock price would increase the option value by $1. But 
if there is a reasonable chance the call option will expire out of the money, even after a 
moderate stock price gain, a $1 increase in the stock price will not necessarily increase the 
ultimate payoff to the call; therefore, the call price will not respond by a full dollar. 
 
The fact that hedge ratios are less than 1.0 does not contradict our earlier observation 
that options offer leverage and are sensitive to stock price movements. Although  
dollar
movements in option prices are less than dollar movements in the stock price, the  
rate of 
return volatility of options remains greater than stock return volatility because options sell 
at lower prices. In our example, with the stock selling at $120, and a hedge ratio of .6, an 
option with exercise price $120 may sell for $5. If the stock price increases to $121, the 
call price would be expected to increase by only $.60 to $5.60. The percentage increase in 
the option value is $.60/$5.00  
5 12%, however, whereas the stock price increase is only 
$1/$120  
5 .83%. The ratio of the percentage changes is 12%/.83%  
5 14.4. For every 1% 
increase in the stock price, the option price increases by 14.4%. This ratio, the percentage 
change in option price per percentage change in stock price, is called the  
 
option elasticity. 
 
 
The hedge ratio is an essential tool in portfolio management and control. An example 
will show why.

Hedge Ratios 
 
Consider two portfolios, one holding 750 IBM calls and 200 shares of IBM and the other 
holding 800 shares of IBM. Which portfolio has greater dollar exposure to IBM price 
movements? You can answer this question easily by using the hedge ratio. 
 
Each option changes in value by  
H dollars for each dollar change in stock price, 
where  
H stands for the hedge ratio. Thus, if  
H equals .6, the 750 options are equivalent to 
.6  
3 750  
5 450 shares in terms of the response of their market value to IBM stock price 
movements. The first portfolio has less dollar sensitivity to stock price change because the 
450 share-equivalents of the options plus the 200 shares actually held are less than the 800 
shares held in the second portfolio. 


735
 
This is not to say, however, that the first portfolio is less sensitive to the stock’s rate of 
return. As we noted in discussing option elasticities, the first portfolio may be of lower 
total value than the second, so despite its lower sensitivity in terms of total market value, it 
might have greater rate of return sensitivity. Because a call option has a lower market value 
than the stock, its price changes more than proportionally with stock price changes, even 
though its hedge ratio is less than 1.0.

Portfolio Insurance 
 
In Chapter 20, we showed that protec-
tive put strategies offer a sort of insur-
ance policy on an asset. The protective 
put has proven to be extremely popular 
with investors. Even if the asset price falls, the put conveys the right to sell the asset for the 
exercise price, which is a way to lock in a minimum portfolio value. With an at-the-money 
put ( 
X  
5  
S 
0 
), the maximum loss that can be realized is the cost of the put. The asset can 
be sold for  
X, which equals its original value, so even if the asset price falls, the investor’s 
net loss over the period is just the cost of the put. If the asset value increases, however,

upside potential is unlimited. 
 
Figure 21.10 graphs the profit or 
loss on a protective put position 
as a function of the change in the 
value of the underlying asset,  
P. 
 
While the protective put is 
a simple and convenient way to 
achieve  
 
portfolio insurance, 
 that 
is, to limit the worst-case portfo-
lio rate of return, there are practi-
cal difficulties in trying to insure 
a portfolio of stocks. First, unless 
the investor’s portfolio corre-
sponds to a standard market index 
for which puts are traded, a put 
option on the portfolio will not 
be available for purchase. And if 
index puts are used to protect a 
non-indexed portfolio, tracking 
error can result. For example, if 
the portfolio falls in value while 
the market index rises, the put will fail to provide the intended protection. Tracking error 
limits the investor’s freedom to pursue active stock selection because such error will be 
greater as the managed portfolio departs more substantially from the market index. 
 
Here is the general idea behind portfolio insurance programs. Even if a put option on 
the desired portfolio does not exist, a theoretical option-pricing model (such as the Black-
Scholes model) can be used to determine how that option’s price would respond to the 
portfolio’s value if it did trade. For example, if stock prices were to fall, the put option 
would increase in value. The option model could quantify this relationship. The net expo-
sure of the (hypothetical) protective put portfolio to swings in stock prices is the sum of the 
exposures of the two components of the portfolio, the stock and the put. The net exposure 
of the portfolio equals the equity exposure less the (offsetting) put option exposure. 
 
We can create “synthetic” protective put positions by holding a quantity of stocks with 
the same net exposure to market swings as the hypothetical protective put position. The 
key to this strategy is the option delta, or hedge ratio, that is, the change in the price of the 
protective put option per change in the value of the underlying stock portfolio.

Synthetic Protective Put Options 
Suppose a portfolio is currently valued at $100 million. An at-the-money put option on the 
portfolio might have a hedge ratio or delta of  
2 .6, meaning the option’s value swings $.60 
for every dollar change in portfolio value, but in an opposite direction. Suppose the stock 
portfolio falls in value by 2%. The profit on a hypothetical protective put position (if the 
put existed) would be as follows (in millions of dollars):
Loss on stocks:
2% of $100 5 $2.00
Gain on put:
.6 3 $2.00 5   1.20
 Net loss
   5 $  .80


 
CHAPTER 21  Option Valuation 
737
 
The difficulty with this procedure is that deltas constantly change.  
Figure 21.11 shows 
that as the stock price falls, the magnitude of the appropriate hedge ratio increases. 
Therefore, market declines require extra hedging, that is, additional conversion of equity 
into cash. This constant updating of the hedge ratio is called  
 
dynamic hedging (alterna-
tively, delta hedging). 
 
Dynamic hedging is one reason portfolio insurance has been said to contribute to mar-
ket volatility. Market declines trigger additional sales of stock as portfolio insurers strive 
to increase their hedging. These additional sales are seen as reinforcing or exaggerating 
market downturns. 
 
In practice, portfolio insurers do not 
actually buy or sell stocks directly when 
they update their hedge positions. Instead, 
they minimize trading costs by buying or 
selling stock index futures as a substitute 
for sale of the stocks themselves. As you 
will see in the next chapter, stock prices 
and index futures prices usually are very 
tightly linked by cross-market arbitra-
geurs so that futures transactions can be 
used as reliable proxies for stock transac-
tions. Instead of selling equities based on 
the put option’s delta, insurers will sell an 
equivalent number of futures contracts. 
13 
 
Several portfolio insurers suffered 
great setbacks during the market crash 
of October 19, 1987, when the market 
suffered an unprecedented 1-day loss 
of about 20%. A description of what 
13 
Notice, however, that the use of index futures reintroduces the problem of tracking error between the portfolio 
and the market index. 
We create the synthetic option position by selling a proportion of shares equal 
to the put option’s delta (i.e., selling 60% of the shares) and placing the proceeds 
in risk-free T-bills. The rationale is that the hypothetical put option would have off-
set 60% of any change in the stock portfolio’s value, so one must reduce portfolio 
risk directly by selling 60% of the equity and putting the proceeds into a risk-free 
asset. Total return on a synthetic protective put position with $60 million in risk-free 
investments such as T-bills and $40 million in equity is
  Loss on stocks:
2% of $40 5 $.80
1 Loss on bills:
5     0
  Net loss
5 $.80
 
The synthetic and actual protective put positions have equal returns. We conclude 
that if you sell a proportion of shares equal to the put option’s delta and place the 
proceeds in cash equivalents, your exposure to the stock market will equal that of the 
desired protective put position.

appened then should let you appreciate the complexities of applying a seemingly straight-
forward hedging concept. 
 
1. Market volatility at the crash was much greater than ever encountered before. Put 
option deltas based on historical experience were too low; insurers underhedged, 
held too much equity, and suffered excessive losses. 
 
2. Prices moved so fast that insurers could not keep up with the necessary rebalanc-
ing. They were “chasing deltas” that kept getting away from them. The futures 
market also saw a “gap” opening, where the opening price was nearly 10% below 
the previous day’s close. The price dropped before insurers could update their 
hedge ratios. 
 
 
3. Execution problems were severe. First, current market prices were unavailable, with 
trade execution and the price quotation system hours behind, which made computa-
tion of correct hedge ratios impossible. Moreover, trading in stocks and stock futures 
ceased during some periods. The continuous rebalancing capability that is essential 
for a viable insurance program vanished during the precipitous market collapse. 
 
 
4. Futures prices traded at steep discounts to their proper levels compared to reported 
stock prices, thereby making the sale of futures (as a proxy for equity sales) seem 
expensive. Although you will see in the next chapter that stock index futures prices 
normally exceed the value of the stock index,  
Figure 21.12 shows that on October 19, 
futures sold far below the stock index level. When some insurers gambled that the 
futures price would recover to its usual premium over the stock index, and chose to 
defer sales, they remained underhedged. As the market fell farther, their portfolios 
experienced substantial losses. 
 
Although most observers at the time believed that the portfolio insurance industry 
would never recover from the market crash, delta hedging is still alive and well on Wall 
Street. Dynamic hedges are widely used by large firms to hedge potential losses from 
options positions. For example, the nearby box notes that when Microsoft ended its 
employee stock option program and J. P. Morgan purchased many already-issued options

J. P. Morgan Rolls Dice on Microsoft Options 
 
Microsoft, in a shift that could be copied throughout the 
technology business, said yesterday that it plans to stop 
issuing stock options to its employees, and instead will pro-
vide them with restricted stock. 
 
The deal could portend a seismic shift for Microsoft’s 
Silicon Valley rivals, and it could well have effects on Wall 
Street. Though details of the plan still aren’t clear, J. P. 
Morgan effectively plans to buy the options from Microsoft 
employees who opt for restricted stock instead. Employee 
stock options are granted as a form of compensation and 
allow employees the right to exchange the options for 
shares of company stock. 
 
The price offered to employees for the options presum-
ably will be lower than the current value, giving J. P. Morgan 
a chance to make a profit on the deal. Rather than hold-
ing the options, and thus betting Microsoft’s stock will rise, 
people familiar with the bank’s strategy say J. P. Morgan 
probably will match each option it buys from the company’s 
employees with a separate trade in the stock market that 
both hedges the bet and gives itself a margin of profit. 
 
For Wall Street’s so-called rocket scientists who do com-
plicated financial transactions such as this one, the strategy 
behind J. P. Morgan’s deal with Microsoft isn’t particularly 
unique or sophisticated. They add that the bank has sev-
eral ways to deal with the millions of Microsoft options 
that could come its way. 
 
The bank, for instance, could hedge the options by 
shorting, or betting against, Microsoft stock. Microsoft has 
the largest market capitalization of any stock in the mar-
ket, and its shares are among the most liquid, meaning it 
would be easy to hedge the risk of holding those options. 
 
J. P. Morgan also could sell the options to investors, 
much as they would do with a syndicated loan, thereby 
spreading the risk. During a conference call with investors, 
Mr. Ballmer said employees could sell their options to “a 
third party or set of third parties,” adding that the com-
pany was still working out the details with J. P. Morgan 
and the SEC.

WORDS FROM THE STREET 
of Microsoft employees, it was widely expected that Morgan would protect its options 
position by selling shares in Microsoft in accord with a delta hedging strategy. 
 
Hedging Bets on Mispriced Options 
 
Suppose you believe that the standard deviation of IBM stock returns will be 35% over the 
next few weeks, but IBM put options are selling at a price consistent with a volatility of 
33%. Because the put’s implied volatility is less than your forecast of the stock volatility, 
you believe the option is underpriced. Using your assessment of volatility in an option-
pricing model like the Black-Scholes formula, you would estimate that the fair price for 
the puts exceeds the actual price. 
 
Does this mean that you ought to buy put options? Perhaps it does, but by doing so, 
you risk losses if IBM stock performs well,  
even if you are correct about the volatility. You 
would like to separate your bet on volatility from the “attached” bet inherent in purchasing 
a put that IBM’s stock price will fall. In other words, you would like to speculate on the 
option mispricing by purchasing the put option, but hedge the resulting exposure to the 
performance of IBM stock. 
 
The option  
delta can be interpreted as a hedge ratio that can be used for this purpose. 
The delta was defined as
 
Delta 5 Change in value of option
Change in value of stock  
Therefore, delta is the slope of the option-pricing curve. 
 
This ratio tells us precisely how many shares of stock we must hold to offset our expo-
sure to IBM. For example, if the delta is  
2 
.6, then the put will fall by $.60 in value for 
every one-point increase in IBM stock, and we need to hold .6 share of stock to hedge each 
put. If we purchase 10 option contracts, each for 100 shares, we would need to buy 600 
shares of stock. If the stock price rises by $1, each put option will decrease in value by 
$.60, resulting in a loss of $600. However, the loss on the puts will be offset by a gain on 
the stock holdings of $1 per share  
3 
 600 shares.

P A R T  V I  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives
 
To see how the profits on this strategy might develop, let’s use the following example. 
 
Example 21.6 
 
 
Speculating on Mispriced Options 
 
Suppose option expiration  
T is 60 days; put price  
P is $4.495; exercise price  
X is $90; 
stock price  
S is $90; and the risk-free rate  
r is 4%. We assume that the stock will not pay a 
dividend in the next 60 days. Given these data, the implied volatility on the option is 33%, 
as we posited. However, you believe the true volatility is 35%, implying that the fair put 
price is $4.785. Therefore, if the market assessment of volatility is revised to the value you 
believe is correct, your profit will be $.29 per put purchased. 
 
Recall that the hedge ratio, or delta, of a put option equals  
N 
( 
d 
1 
)  
2 1, where  
N (•) is the 
cumulative normal distribution function and
 
d1 5 ln(S/X) 1 (r 1 s2/ 2)T
s"T
 
Using your estimate of  
s  
5 .35, you find that the hedge ratio  
N 
( 
d 
1 
)  
2 1  
5  
2 
.453. 
 
Suppose, therefore, that you purchase 10 option contracts (1,000 puts) and purchase 
453 shares of stock. Once the market “catches up” to your presumably better volatil-
ity estimate, the put options purchased will increase in value. If the market assessment 
of volatility changes as soon as you purchase the options, your profits should equal 
1,000  
3 $.29  
5 $290. The option price will be affected as well by any change in the stock 
price, but this part of your exposure will be eliminated if the hedge ratio is chosen properly. 
Your profit should be based solely on the effect of the change in the implied volatility of 
the put, with the impact of the stock price hedged away. 
 
Table 21.3 illustrates your profits as a function of the stock price assuming that the put 
price changes to reflect  
your estimate of volatility. Panel B shows that the put option alone 
can provide profits or losses depending on whether the stock price falls or rises. We see in 
panel C, however, that each  
hedged put option provides profits nearly equal to the original 
mispricing, regardless of the change in the stock price.

Notice in  
Example 21.6 that the 
profit is not exactly independent of the 
stock price. This is because as the stock 
price changes, so do the deltas used to 
calculate the hedge ratio. The hedge 
ratio in principle would need to be 
continually adjusted as deltas evolve. 
The sensitivity of the delta to the stock price is called the  
 
gamma 
 of the option. Option 
gammas are analogous to bond convexity. In both cases, the curvature of the value function 
means that hedge ratios or durations change with market conditions, making rebalancing a 
necessary part of hedging strategies. 
 
A variant of the strategy in  
Example 21.6 involves cross-option speculation. Suppose 
you observe a 45-day expiration call option on IBM with strike price 95 selling at a price 
consistent with a volatility of  
s  
5 33% while another 45-day call with strike price 90 has 
an implied volatility of only 27%. Because the underlying asset and expiration date are 
identical, you conclude that the call with the higher implied volatility is relatively over-
priced. To exploit the mispricing, you might buy the cheap calls (with strike price 90 and 
implied volatility of 27%) and write the expensive calls (with strike price 95 and implied 
volatility 33%). If the risk-free rate is 4% and IBM is selling at $90 per share, the calls 
purchased will be priced at $3.6202 and the calls written will be priced at $2.3735. 
 
Despite the fact that you are long one call and short another, your exposure to IBM 
stock-price uncertainty will not be hedged using this strategy. This is because calls 
with different strike prices have different sensitivities to the price of the underlying 
asset. The lower-strike-price call has a higher delta and therefore greater exposure to 
the price of IBM. If you take an equal number of positions in these two options, you 
will inadvertently establish a bullish position in IBM, as the calls you purchase have 
higher deltas than the calls you write. In fact, you may recall from Chapter 20 that this 
portfolio (long call with low exercise price and short call with high exercise price) is 
called a  
bullish spread. 
 
 
To establish a hedged position, we can use the hedge ratio approach as follows. 
Consider the 95-strike-price options you write as the asset that hedges your exposure to the 
90-strike-price options you purchase. Then the hedge ratio is
 
H 5 Change in value of 90-strike-price call for $1 change in IBM
Change in value of 95-strike-price call for $1 change in IBM
 5 Delta of 90-strike-price call
Delta of 95-strike-price call . 1
 
You need to write  
more than one call with the higher strike price to hedge the purchase of 
each call with the lower strike price. Because the prices of higher-strike-price calls are less 
sensitive to IBM prices, more of them are required to offset the exposure. 
 
Suppose the true annual volatility of the stock is midway between the two implied vola-
tilities, so  
s  
5 30%. We know that the delta of a call option is  
N 
( 
d 
1 
). Therefore, the deltas 
of the two options and the hedge ratio are computed as follows: 
 
Option with strike price 90: 
 
 
d1 5 ln(90/90) 1 (.04 1 .302/2) 3 45/365
.30"45/365
5 .0995
 
N(d1) 5 .5396

Suppose you bet on volatility by purchasing calls 
instead of puts. How would you hedge your expo-
sure to stock-price fluctuations? What is the hedge 
ratio?

Hedge ratio:

Therefore, for every 1,000 call options purchased with strike price 90, we need to write 
1,589 call options with strike price 95. Following this strategy enables us to bet on the rela-
tive mispricing of the two options without taking a position on IBM. Panel A of  
Table 21.4 
shows that the position will result in a cash inflow of $151.30. The premium income on the 
calls written exceeds the cost of the calls purchased. 
 
When you establish a position in stocks and options that is hedged with respect to fluc-
tuations in the price of the underlying asset, your portfolio is said to be  
 
delta neutral, 
 
meaning that the portfolio has no tendency to either increase or decrease in value when the 
stock price fluctuates. 
 
Let’s check that our options position is in fact delta neutral. Suppose that the implied 
volatilities of the two options come back into alignment just after you establish your posi-
tion, so that both options are priced at implied volatilities of 30%. You expect to profit from 
the increase in the value of the call purchased as well as from the decrease in the value of 
the call written. The option prices at 30% volatility are given in panel B of  
Table 21.4 and 
the values of your position for various stock prices are presented in panel C. Although the 
profit or loss on each option is affected by the stock price, the value of the delta-neutral 
option portfolio is positive and essentially independent of the price of IBM. Moreover, we 
saw in panel A that the portfolio would have been established without ever requiring a cash 
outlay. You would have cash inflows both when you establish the portfolio  
and when you 
liquidate it after the implied volatilities converge to 30%.

This unusual profit opportunity arises because you have identified prices out of align-
ment. Such opportunities could not arise if prices were at equilibrium levels. By exploiting 
the pricing discrepancy using a delta-neutral strategy, you should earn profits regardless of 
the price movement in IBM stock. 
 
Delta-neutral hedging strategies are also subject to practical problems, the most impor-
tant of which is the difficulty in assessing the proper volatility for the coming period. If the 
volatility estimate is incorrect, so will be the deltas, and the overall position will not truly 
be hedged. Moreover, option or option-plus-stock positions generally will not be neutral 
with respect to changes in volatility. For example, a put option hedged by a stock might be 
delta neutral, but it is not volatility neutral. Changes in the market assessments of volatility 
will affect the option price even if the stock price is unchanged. 
 
These problems can be serious, because volatility estimates are never fully reliable. 
First, volatility cannot be observed directly and must be estimated from past data which 
imparts measurement error to the forecast. Second, we’ve seen that both historical and 
implied volatilities fluctuate over time. Therefore, we are always shooting at a moving 
target. Although delta-neutral positions are hedged against changes in the price of the 
underlying asset, they still are subject to  
volatility risk, the risk incurred from unpre-
dictable changes in volatility. The sensitivity of an option price to changes in volatility 
is called the option’s  
vega. Thus, although delta-neutral option hedges might eliminate 
exposure to risk from fluctuations in the value of the underlying asset, they do not elimi-
nate volatility risk. 
 
 
 
 21.6 Empirical Evidence on Option Pricing 
 
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model has been subject to an enormous number of 
empirical tests. For the most part, the results of the studies have been positive in that the 
Black-Scholes model generates option values fairly close to the actual prices at which 
options trade. At the same time, some regular empirical failures of the model have been 
noted. 
 
Whaley 
14 examined the performance of the Black-Scholes formula relative to that of 
more complicated option formulas that allow for early exercise. His findings indicate that 
formulas allowing for the possibility of early exercise do better at pricing than the Black-
Scholes formula. The Black-Scholes formula seems to perform worst for options on stocks 
with high dividend payouts. The true American call option formula, on the other hand, 
seems to fare equally well in the prediction of option prices on stocks with high or low 
dividend payouts. 
 
Rubinstein has emphasized a more serious problem with the Black-Scholes model. 
15 
If the model were accurate, the implied volatility of all options on a particular stock with 
the same expiration date would be equal—after all, the underlying asset and expiration 
date are the same for each option, so the volatility inferred from each also ought to be the 
same. But in fact, when one actually plots implied volatility as a function of exercise price, 
the typical results appear as in  
Figure 21.13 
, which treats S&P 500 index options as the 
underlying asset. Implied volatility steadily falls as the exercise price rises. Clearly, the 
Black-Scholes model is missing something.

Rubinstein suggests that the prob-
lem with the model has to do with fears 
of a market crash like that of October 
1987. The idea is that deep out-of-the-
money puts would be nearly worthless 
if stock prices evolve smoothly, because 
the probability of the stock falling by a 
large amount (and the put option thereby 
moving into the money) in a short time 
would be very small. But a possibility of 
a sudden large downward jump that could 
move the puts into the money, as in a mar-
ket crash, would impart greater value to 
these options. Thus, the market might 
price these options as though there is a 
bigger chance of a large drop in the stock 
price than would be suggested by the 
Black-Scholes assumptions. The result 
of the higher option price is a greater 
implied volatility derived from the Black-
Scholes model. 
 
Interestingly, Rubinstein points out that prior to the 1987 market crash, plots of implied 
volatility like the one in  
Figure 21.13 were relatively flat, consistent with the notion that 
the market was then less attuned to fears of a crash. However, postcrash plots have been 
consistently downward sloping, exhibiting a shape often called the  
option smirk. When we 
use option-pricing models that allow for more general stock price distributions, including 
crash risk and random changes in volatility, they generate downward-sloping implied vola-
tility curves similar to the one observed in  
Figure 21.13 
.

1. Option values may be viewed as the sum of intrinsic value plus time or “volatility” value. The 
volatility value is the right to choose not to exercise if the stock price moves against the holder. 
Thus the option holder cannot lose more than the cost of the option regardless of stock price 
performance. 
 
  
2. Call options are more valuable when the exercise price is lower, when the stock price is higher, 
when the interest rate is higher, when the time to expiration is greater, when the stock’s volatil-
ity is greater, and when dividends are lower. 
  
3. Call options must sell for at least the stock price less the present value of the exercise price and 
dividends to be paid before expiration. This implies that a call option on a non-dividend-paying 
stock may be sold for more than the proceeds from immediate exercise. Thus European calls are 
worth as much as American calls on stocks that pay no dividends, because the right to exercise 
the American call early has no value. 
  
4. Options may be priced relative to the underlying stock price using a simple two-period, two-
state pricing model. As the number of periods increases, the binomial model can approximate 
more realistic stock price distributions. The Black-Scholes formula may be seen as a limiting
