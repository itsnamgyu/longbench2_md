# Question

Based on the passage, which of the following statements about the DigiRL framework's interaction with the emulator is correct?

# Choices

- A: In the Web Shopping subsets, DigiRL increased by 3.6% compared to Filtered BC, while in the General subsets it was about 10%.
- B: The all possible actions for the agent in the DigiRL framework include tapping and swiping on the screen using normalized (x, y) coordinates and typing variable-length text inputs.
- C: The automatic curriculum in DigiRL adjusts the instruction-level value function to filter out easy tasks, allowing the agent to focus solely on tasks it has not yet encountered during training.
- D: The cross-entropy loss function is applied in DigiRL exclusively to the policy network, avoiding its use in the training of value functions to prevent overfitting in the model.

# Answer

A
