The Day Before  
Final Exams Approaching  

"Chairwoman, are you leaving already?"  

Just as Arisa Jomine was leaving her study desk and heading for the door, Yayoi called out to her from the counter. Arisa stopped, smiled apologetically, and replied:  

"Yes... I can focus better in other places."  

She looked around the library after school. Even the usually sparsely populated reading room was packed today, filled with students making a last-ditch effort. Conversations like "Will this formula be on the test?" "Is the scope only up to chapter two?" "Give up and join me in hell!" broke out everywhere, rendering the "Please Keep Quiet" signs on the walls meaningless. The day before exams was always like this.  

"Huh? Is the chairwoman leaving already?"  

"I wanted to ask you about 'The Car Struggle'."  

Two girls sitting beside Yayoi with their study materials spread out complained.  

"I can teach you classical literature," Yayoi jokingly offered.  

"No way, senior Mita. If you teach us, we'll only get more confused..."  

"You dare say such things!"  

Yayoi playfully raised her fist, and the juniors shielded themselves with textbooks, laughing heartily.  

"If the chairwoman's leaving, I might as well leave too."  

"Yayoi, it's your turn to be on duty at the counter today; you can't leave," Yayoi was teased by Arisa as she stepped out of the reading room on a wave of renewed embarrassment.  

At the assignment allocation in April, Arisa had drawn the worst lot. Over five months had already passed. Although being the chairwoman of the high school library committee did not entail heavy responsibilities, it was still a burden for Arisa. She had become a library committee member due to her love for reading novels. She was not very adept at organizing people or blending into various circles.  

"Extra! Extra! Extra!"  

As soon as she exited the entrance, she heard a lively voice. The newspaper club members, who had been waiting here, were distributing the latest issue of the school newspaper to students leaving for home. The proactive figure of the female president seemed to pressure Arisa, and she slipped away quickly to the side.  

She pushed her ladies' bicycle out of the shed and rode towards the main gate. The sound of rusty brakes accompanied her as she rode down the tree-lined path. The air mid-September was still hot and humid.  

Arisa's two braids fluttered in the wind as she pondered where to go next. She could go home, but she wanted to find a place where she could concentrate and sit quietly. A quiet, cool place suitable for study and revision—if so, it would be safest to go to the usual place.  

A library larger than the school's. It was one of the few places that belonged to timid Arisa.  

The library across from the station.  

She crossed the crossing, went through the shopping street, and entered the residential area of Kazekozan. In a secluded corner near the park and sports fields stood nestled among trees, was the Yokohama Municipal Kazekozan Library.  

A two-story concrete building resembling two square building blocks pieced together. The exterior walls were styled with gray brick, and the windows were adorned with faint reddish-brown lines. The building had sharp edges, except for the central area with the automatic doors, which featured a charming arched ceiling. This subtle design was very fitting for a public facility.  

As one of the local libraries found in every district, its size wasn't particularly large. However, it could inter-library loan with other libraries within the city, so most general books were available here. Born and raised in this neighborhood, Arisa had frequented here so often since childhood that she lost count. Because of this, she had become a regular familiar to the librarians.  

Each time she came, she was overwhelmed by the vast number of books on the shelves, debating what to borrow, eventually leaving with a bulging backpack. She bought new books with her allowance at bookstores, while others she mainly relied on the library. Whether she first discovered Shigematsu Shida, learned about Jules Verne, or became obsessed with Natsuhiko Kyogoku, this was the place. To Arisa, the library was both a familiar and intimate friend and a mentor introducing her to unknown worlds.  

She parked her bicycle in the designated area and walked through the automatic doors.  

As soon as she stepped in, she felt a change in the air's density. The scent of paper, the artificially conditioned room temperature, and an uncanny tranquility. Light gray carpet tiles absorbed the sound of footsteps, and the noise from nearby construction was left outside. Some might find this atmosphere stifling, but Arisa quite liked it.  

Upon entering, the first hall was the local resource reading area. On the left was a spacious children's reading room, where anything from illustrated books to picture books could be found. Passing through here, on the right against the wall was a large counter. The librarians working inside wore aprons and nametags, distinguishing them from others. Directly in front of the counter was a staircase leading to the second floor, dedicated to general books with open shelving.  

Arisa was about to go upstairs when she saw two men whispering softly near the elevator. One was a long-haired man wearing a dark blue apron, the other a youth in a cool shirt.  

"But does it have to be our library?"  

"Yes. Can you help figure something out?"  

"I don't mind..."  

"In any case, within today..."  

"Kyousuke."  

Upon hearing her call, the young man turned around startled. Then he raised his hand to signal, "Yo, Arisa!" His other arm cradled several books.  

His name was Kyousuke Jomine, sharing a surname with Arisa because they were cousins on their father's side. Their families lived close by, so Kyousuke often played with her since childhood. Especially in the library, where it was rare for them not to bump into each other. Arisa loved books greatly due to his influence.  

"Until next time, Mr. Koyama."  

Kyousuke said to the man he was talking with. The other nodded slowly and then nodded to Arisa before returning to the counter. The librarian named Koyama, nicknamed "Mr. Lennon" due to his resemblance to the famous musician, was how Arisa called him privately.  

"What are you talking about?"  

"I asked him to get a book from the stack room, so I was discussing it with him."  

Kyousuke and Arisa walked up the stairs, talking in low tones to not disturb others.  

"Here to borrow books?"  

"No, I came to study and prepare for exams. Tomorrow's the final exam. How about you, Kyousuke?"  

"I'm doing summer homework with Akashi."  

"You have homework?"  

"A report on educational book reviews. But the materials are fewer than expected."  

"You should use your college's library."  

"It's too big and uncomfortable to stay in. I can relax more here."  

Kyousuke laughed pleasantly. His gentle smile was just as it was when they were young, like a breath of fresh air.  

Then, he lowered his voice further and whispered:  

"That book has apparently not been read by anyone today."  

"Mm."  

When she replied cautiously, they had already reached the second floor.  

The two headed towards the reading room on the right side. At one end of the table, Kyousuke's friend, Kohei Akashi, was working on a laptop and greeted them quietly.  

"Arisa, long time no see," Akashi then jokingly teased Kyousuke, "I wondered why you were late; now I see you've been on a date with your cute cousin."  

"We just happened to meet. She said she has finals tomorrow."  

"Wow, really? But Arisa, your grades should be pretty good, right?"  

"No, it's not that great..."  

She wanted to deny it, but Kyousuke and Akashi were already conversing among themselves. Is there no issue with part-time work? Oh, it's already time. So, continue this next time. They were university students a stop away by train, in their second year at a national university, appearing relaxed, carefree, and quite mature.  

"We're heading back. Are you sitting here?" Akashi asked.  

"Oh no, I'll be on the benches. Just want to review my textbooks."  

"Jomine, let's go. I'll ride my bike and give you a lift back."  

Akashi packed his laptop in his bag and headed toward the stairs. However, Kyousuke remained, gazing worriedly at Arisa.  

"What's wrong?"  

Kyousuke smiled slightly. "... Sorry, it's nothing. Study well." He turned and caught up with Akashi. Arisa heard Akashi teasing him on the way down, "Can't bear to leave her?"  

Arisa stood dazed, until the stares from others in the reading room brought her back to reality. She adjusted her backpack and walked to the shelves.  

"English and American Novels," "Oriental Novels," "Non-fiction," and "Japanese Novels."  

In the space in front of the domestic novel section, a few people sat scattered on square stools. An elderly man adjusted his reading glasses while perusing a newspaper. A middle-schooler unfamiliar with research techniques. And a man with a stylish bowler hat and a crumpled polo shirt, a strange combination, with his head bowed, possibly napping. Arisa sat down on an empty stool in front of the "Ra" author section.  

"Look here, Orange!"  

She suddenly heard someone speaking to a child, and when she looked over at the bookshelves, she found a mother coaxing her young daughter, trying to take a photo. Arisa frowned inwardly: That’s somewhat against the rules.  

At this moment, perhaps thinking in unison, Arisa’s gaze passed beyond the mother-daughter pair and met that of a boy standing at the end of the bookshelf. They looked at each other for just an instant before the boy redirected his gaze to the shelves.  

The boy's well-defined side profile was close to the book spines as he ran his fingers over the books, selecting one. He wore the same uniform as Arisa, a white shirt with a deep green tie, from Kazekozan High.  

Like herself and Kyousuke, he was a regular visitor to this library. At times, Arisa would see him seated on the benches or at the desks in the reading room. Whether it was because he got bored easily or read exceptionally quickly was unknown. One moment he was engrossed in an anthology of featured authors from the Hayakawa Library, the next he was absorbed in a collection of Hiroshi Uramura's poetry—a rather peculiar individual. He frequently visited the school library as well, where he often read light novels and manga.  

He should be named Risome. Being from the adjacent class, Arisa hardly spoke to him, but she had heard that he was excellent academically. No wonder he felt confident enough to leisurely choose novels on the eve of exams.  

Click—a camera shutter sounded. The mother and her daughter noisily moved away to another section. Arisa breathed a sigh of relief, casting a comforting glance over the bookshelves used as a photographic backdrop. She didn’t choose to sit in the reading room but opted to stay here for a reason: she wanted to keep one of her favorite books within her sight.  

On the "Ma" author shelf, the third row from the bottom contained a hardcover book with a light gray spine embossed with red text denoting the author’s name—"The Planet of the Key Kingdom" by Shinnosuke Mori Asami.  

Of the 120,000 books in this library, this particular one was dear to Arisa. Approximately 250 pages long, it had an undecorated cloth cover, the horizontally printed title encircled in an ivy border. A barcode sticker on the corner read "Kazekozan Library." Opening the book revealed a table of contents outlining its four chapters, filled with exotically-sounding names of characters introduced within. Since Arisa had memorized it entirely, she knew it by heart without taking it off the shelf.  

Tagged at the bottom corner of the back cover was a red label reading "In-library Only," indicating the book was not for loan. Despite its inconspicuous placement, Arisa often saw people reading it, perhaps due to the label drawing attention. "That book," as Kyousuke had mentioned, was also "The Planet of the Key Kingdom." It always caught Arisa's attention, making her heart flutter whenever she saw someone reading it.  

She crossed in front of Risome, who was holding a book, heading to the reading room. He seemed to have picked a book—Hiroko Minagawa's "The Baron Afraid of Hot Food." She couldn’t help but feel restive too.  

With a nudge, Arisa pushed her glasses up and took out her textbooks and vocabulary notebooks.  

*  

"I’ll borrow a few books, wait for me outside."  

Headed to the ground floor, Kyousuke Jomine said to his friend.  

Kohei Akashi exited through the automatic doors, while Kyousuke approached the borrowing counter. The librarian Koyama, who had talked with him earlier, was seated inside. There was no one else queuing to borrow books.  

Kyousuke placed six books and his library card on the counter as usual. Koyama mechanically recited, "Borrowing period is two weeks," scanning the books' barcodes.  

"The Audit," "Perspective of Dreams," "Notes in a Bottle," "Introduction to Educational Counseling," "Special Activities and Personal Development," and "Theory of Moral Education." The machine spat out a slip of recycled paper. Titles and return dates were printed in black ink on it. Koyama tore it off and picked out a red ballpoint pen from a penholder. Then he flipped over the borrowing slip, quickly penned some words, and tucked it into "The Audit."  

"Here you go."  

As Koyama handed over the books, he exchanged a glance with Kyousuke. A hint of unease showed in the librarian’s eyes. Kyousuke smiled back nonchalantly and walked away from the counter.  

Kyousuke approached the waiting Akashi by the automatic doors. On the way, he pulled out the borrowing slip tucked inside the books, glanced at the list of titles, casually turned it over, and noted what was written in pen, before tucking it back.  

The slip read: "Press 'Enter,' 251026."  

*  

The old fluorescent desk lamp buzzed steadily.  

Arisa tapped the tip of her mechanical pencil on the blank spaces of her notebook, checking answers against the reference book. The same actions repeated numerous times resulted in countless small black dots etched into the paper. They connected, seemingly forming constellations.  

Nighttime. Arisa continued battling exam subjects in her room.  

Arisa persisted until library closing time, completing her English reading test preparation. Final confirmation for Mathematics B was completed during dinner and during breaks of the Monday nine o'clock drama in the living room. Now, she was going over physics problems. Only one mistake was made, identified on review as a mere calculation error—but given how things were, tomorrow's subjects should be no problem. Although she couldn't let her guard down—  

Feeling overstrained, she stretched broadly.  

A glance at the clock, it read ten-fifty. Gathering her hair, she donned a T-shirt over her tank top and went downstairs.  

In the living room, her mother and brother watched a variety show.  

"I'm going to buy something to drink."  

"Huh? Going out so late?"  

"I'm just going to the vending machine."  

"Be careful!"  

Her mother's gaze quickly returned to the TV, focused on SMAP’s performance; she was a fan of Goro Inagaki.  

She slipped into her sneakers, exited, and unlocked her bicycle. A vending machine within walking distance was available, but Arisa felt like taking a break, planning to head to the library. The vending machine at the library front sold unusual drinks that Arisa liked.  

Just as she stepped on the pedal, her phone emitted a notification sound from her pocket. She opened it to see the sender: "Miyoko Jomine." It was Kyousuke's mother—Arisa's aunt. The mail's content was even more surprising:  

"Is Kyousuke at your place? He went out around half-past nine and hasn't returned yet."  

Aunt Miyoko was overly protective!  

Arisa replied with a smile, "He's not here, but I’m sure he's fine," and then set off riding.  

Kyousuke's father—Arisa's uncle—passed away ten years ago. Miyoko lived only with Kyousuke ever since. Perhaps because of this, she was always worry-prone, occasionally sending emails like that. Kyousuke was already twenty, not unusual for him to be out late. Perhaps he was leisurely wandering around Yokohama alone, or having drinks with Akashi, or out on a date with a girlfriend.
In contrast to the bright daytime, the outdoor night air was still chilly. Arisa rode her bicycle under the street lights, passing one lamp after another. After about five minutes of pedaling, during which her breathing became labored, she reached her destination.

Right next to the vending machine was the path leading to the library. The building revealed its sharp-edged silhouette among the trees. Not a single light was on, making it look truly eerie.

Perhaps due to the unsettling atmosphere, Arisa thought she saw a flash of light at the second-floor window, ghostly and fleeting. She reflexively adjusted her glasses but then reconsidered, realizing that she must have been mistaken; it was too late for anyone to be in the library.

She turned her attention to the vending machine, which was dazzlingly bright, in stark contrast to the library. Arisa's target was an apple soda produced by a company called Marumi Drinks. She got off her bike and without hesitation inserted her change.

With a clunk, the drink can fell. She picked it up and immediately opened it. As she pulled the tab, she felt a sharp pain in her finger. The metallic edge had cut the base of her thumb. Ugh, how annoying! She was usually very careful—her concentration must really be slipping now, she thought, as she took a sip of the drink. The intense carbonation immediately washed away the stress from studying. Arisa moved the can away from her lips and took a breath—

Just then.

The bicycle parked next to her was knocked over with great force.

* Meanwhile.

Yuzuno Hakata threw her textbook to the side and collapsed onto her desk, groaning in despair:

"I can't go on anymore..."

A section from The Tale of Genji.

Mathematics B is a subject for second-year high school students, while Mathematics I and Mathematics A are for first-year students.
Day One: Geography, Ancient Literature, Case, Investigation

1. The Library at the End of One's Life

Before turning onto the road that led to the library, Masato Nasu looked at the vending machine. He happened to want a cup of morning coffee. Should he buy a can? No, it would be more economical to get a cup from the office coffee machine. He should have enough time. Driving away the temptation and battling drowsiness, he walked into the library grounds.

Nasu was a librarian at Kazekozan Library, and today it was his turn for the early shift, which came once every five days. He had to start an hour earlier than other librarians. His tasks included unlocking the automatic door, opening the service entrance’s roller door, patrolling the open-access area, doing simple cleaning, checking the book storage, setting the air conditioning, and confirming the return counter used at closing. He had stayed up late last night, so starting work at seven-thirty felt like a hardship. Despite the clear and refreshing morning, it seemed it was going to be a bad day for him.

"Hmm?"

As he walked slowly, he spotted a familiar figure ahead. Straight hair reaching her shoulder blades and a smart pants outfit.

"Miss Uehashi!"

"Oh, Mr. Nasu. Good morning!"

The woman who turned her head was indeed Hikari Uehashi. She was also a librarian and the same age as Nasu. Today, her delicate face, framed by celluloid glasses, was as beautiful as always. Just one look at her, and Nasu's sleepiness was thrown to the winds. He thought he should take back what he said earlier; running into her first thing in the morning made today a good day—wait, hold on.

"Today should be my early shift, right? Why are you here so early?"

"It's nothing serious... When I went home yesterday, I didn't put away the books I'd taken from the storage. I was a bit uneasy, so I thought I'd come early to return them."

"Ah? Just for that?"

"I just finished restoring this book, and it would be a shame if it got damaged again..."

Uehashi said apologetically. Nasu couldn't help but sincerely praise, "Miss Uehashi is really something!" Coming early to work just for a book was something he could never do. Her earnestness was impressive. Though they were the same age, they spoke in such a formal way because she was overly serious. Perhaps.

"By the way, what book did you restore?"

"The first volume of 'The Paintings of One's Final Moments.' First edition, boxed."

"Oh. Miss Nariki mentioned that the binding on that book was loose, right? Is it due to aging?"

"Maybe it's because borrowers didn't take care of it."

"Some recent readers are quite careless. The mirror in the second-floor bathroom got cracked too."

"It was just hit by Mr. Teramura's mop."

The two (at least Nasu thought so) were having a pleasant conversation as they walked through the bicycle parking area and reached the building. The front automatic door was still locked, so they went around to the staff entrance.

The staff entrance was a discreet small door on the west side of the building with an electronic passcode lock. Below the intercom was a small keypad for entering the code, covered by a flip-flop plastic guard... as it should have been.

"Huh? Why is the cover open?"

Uehashi remarked.

Indeed, the usually closed cover was open, leaving the keypad exposed.

"That's strange!" Nasu responded, but he wasn't particularly concerned. He approached the keypad and skillfully entered six numeric keys: 2, 5, 1, 0, 2, 6. With a click, the lock disengaged, and the door opened. They were greeted by an empty office. Desks for staff, book trolleys, file shelves, and a copier scattered around, along with a small kitchenette for boiling water; a familiar cluttered room.

"Miss Uehashi, where's the book you restored?"

"I think I left it on the trolley in the hallway... huh?"

Just as Uehashi was about to head towards the hallway door, she exclaimed again.

The door was open, allowing a view of the storage room entrance across the hallway.

"Wasn't this door closed when we left yesterday?"

"Was it?"

Like the cover beside the entrance door, Nasu couldn’t remember clearly. However, he felt this door was usually closed. Miss Nariki, the librarian and director, was somewhat neurotic about such things and would check every day before leaving.

"That's strange... oh, and the book's missing!"

Uehashi yelled again as she entered the hallway. Nasu followed and saw her pointing at the orange trolley placed by the library door—a small, wheeled mobile bookshelf. Some books were on the trolley, but "The Paintings of One's Final Moments" was indeed missing. There was little in the hallway, so it wouldn't have been mixed with other items.

"Really strange. I was sure I put it here."

"Though you placed it here, it wasn’t exactly at the time you were about to leave, was it? Maybe someone noticed and put it back in the storage for you?"

"Could it be?"

"Surely. Books don’t just vanish on their own..."

Nasu didn’t finish his sentence, as he noticed another oddity.

The hallway extended directly to the left and right from the office door. Opposite were the storage entrance and the service port door, with a small window at the far right end and a door to the front desk at the far left.

And that door, like the office door, was inexplicably open.

"Mr. Nasu... wasn't that door closed when we left yesterday too?"

"Yes, I think Miss Nariki closed it."

"A closed door can't open by itself."

Though it wasn’t locked, it was the significant door separating the open-access and office areas, usually not left open after hours.

"Did someone come here at night?"

Nasu crossed the short hallway into the open-access area. He glanced at the back of the counter. Against the wall was a large bookshelf for interlibrary loan books and reserved books. No anomalies were detected. The main counter—

Just as Nasu's gaze reached there, he was taken aback.

An office chair with five round wheels lay overturned on the floor. On the floor beneath the counter was a stain that sharply contrasted with the light gray carpet. The stain, about twenty centimeters in diameter, looked like some liquid had seeped into it.

The color was a dark red.

"Mr. Nasu," Uehashi tugged at his shirt sleeve. If it weren't for the circumstances, he would be thrilled.

"What is this thing?"

"I don't know..."

How could he possibly answer?

"It looks like... like blood."

Nasu stepped closer. The stain on the floor was undoubtedly blood. The counter, the keyboard of the computer, were all spattered with red droplets. There had been no such thing when they closed yesterday.

Ah, this really was a terrible day—Nasu felt sweat running down his whole body. He began checking other areas of the open-access section, with Uehashi following him. The pocket paperback section, the children's section, the restroom, and the multipurpose room were all as they were yesterday.

"Aside from the counter, everything seems normal."

"Yes. But there's also..."

There was the second floor.

They exchanged looks and mutually came to a tacit understanding. They slowly climbed the stairs, having made up their minds. The silence in the library was unsettling, with not even the sound of footsteps. As a librarian familiar with this path, Nasu was perturbed by the quiet.

Though sunlight poured in through the windows, the expansive open-access area on the second floor remained dimly lit. Nasu pressed the switch by the stairs, turning on the lights. The low shelves of the magazine counter, the computers for catalog searching... everything seemed in order. They looked around and entered the nearest aisle.

"Ah!"

About halfway down the shelving, Uehashi discovered something. Ahead on the right side of the aisle lay a book. It was a book with a box. With keen eyes, Nasu immediately recognized the spine title: "The Paintings of One's Final Moments." It was indeed the book Uehashi had supposedly left in the hallway of the office area.

"Why is it here..."

Uehashi quickened her pace towards the book. Nasu absentmindedly watched her back, her long hair swaying left and right. She crouched to pick it up—only to freeze in place.

She seemed to have discovered something new just as she was about to pick up the book. Uehashi stared at the floor, slowly turning her face toward the right side, terrified. The originally intellectual air of her face turned stiff. Her lips moved slightly, but no sound came out. She stood up again, staggered back, and then fell to the ground as if she had been forcibly shocked far beyond what she had ever experienced.

"Miss Uehashi?"

Nasu called her, but there was no response.

"Miss Uehashi? What's wrong?!"

Nasu hastened to her side, and finally understood what she had seen. His reaction was similar to that of the woman of the same age. 

A person lay dead in front of the bookshelf.

2. The First Term-End War Begins

The plan failed. 

Why did it fail? Several reasons can be thought of. Perhaps it was due to overconfidence, perhaps it was a mistake in prioritization. However, reflecting on this can wait. The problem at hand is how to weather the crisis. Only a little time remains. Everyone says that if you give up, you're done with the exam. I have to give it my all until the last moment!

"Ko, Ki, Ku, Kuru, Kure, Ko, Koyo. Se, Si, Su, Suru, Sure, Seyo..."

"What spell are you chanting?"

Hearing Yuzuno muttering while eating breakfast, her brother, sitting across from her, asked. Yuzuno showed him the textbook in her hand with "Ancient Literature" written on the cover and answered briefly:

"This isn't a spell, it's ancient literature grammar. The Ka row changing verbs and Sa row changing verbs. Uh, next is..."

"Yuzuno, close the textbook while you're eating."

Her mother said across the dining table.

"Just today, just for today!"

"No. I hardly ever get the chance to grill salmon. Don't the lyrics say it? Eating fish makes you smarter."

"If just eating some fish would make me smarter, I wouldn't be struggling so much..."

"Is there a quiz?"

"She said the term-end exams start today."

Her brother and mother chatted leisurely. Reluctantly, Yuzuno closed the textbook and lifted the grilled salmon to her mouth. The seasoning was perfect, but she didn't feel any smarter for it.

At Kazekozan High School, where Yuzuno attended, the term-end exams for the first semester began today—September 11th. The exams spanned four days. First-year students had twelve subjects: Modern Literature, Ancient Literature, Mathematics I, Mathematics A, Chemistry, Geography, Japanese History, Modern Society, English Reading, English Writing, Health and Physical Education, and Home Economics... Even just listing them was discouraging, not to mention it's more than during the midterms.

Today's subjects were Geography and Ancient Literature. Since there were only two, it was lighter compared to the battles of the second day. However, this kind of carelessness was dangerous. She allotted too much time to Geography, which she wasn't good at, leaving little time to study Ancient Literature. She tried to complete the task yesterday, but as the beginning sentence captured, it ended in failure.

"Speaking of which, why are your term-end exams now? Wasn't it just summer vacation?"

"The two-semester system is like that," Yuzuno said, "The first semester ends in September."

"Oh, I see. The weather's still quite hot, so it's tough for you. Heh heh heh."

Her brother laughed as he opened the newspaper, a mug beside him, and dressed in pajamas, looking leisurely.

"Brother, aren't you working today?"

"Today's my day off."

"Oh, I see."

"You don't seem genuinely interested! But honestly, I haven't had a break in a while. Today, I'm planning to relax at home... oh?"

His boastful tone was interrupted by the ringtone of his phone, a call coming in.

"Hello, this is Yusaku Hakata... oh, Detective Sendou. Hello! Huh? A case? Ah, but... okay... okay. Hodono Hills? If that’s the case, it is close to home... Yes. But it's my day off... ah, alright..."

As the conversation progressed, his face gradually turned pale. Seeing this, Yuzuno, chewing on salmon, glanced at the clock and changed her expression too. It was already this late! She had eaten too slowly! Though she wouldn't be late, there'd be no time to review at school if she did this!

She hurriedly drank her miso soup and rushed to the bathroom. While preparing herself, she kept chanting the conjugation of adjectives in her mind. Ku, Kara, Ku, Kari, Shi, Ki, Karu, Kere, Kare... The reflection in the mirror appeared utterly literary, with skin remaining fair. She checked her medium-length hair, whose strands curled on the right side. Fixing it to look good would take a while. Should she go for grades or hairstyle? Crying internally, she chose the former.

"Nara, Nari, Ni, Nari, Naru, Nare, Nare..."

Transitioning to the conjugation of adjectival verbs, she headed for the entrance. Her brother staggered down from the second floor. He had changed into a suit and was carrying a bag.

"Still going to work?"

"Wa... was supposed to be a day off..."

"It's hard for you."

"It's mutual."

Her brother said with a lifeless expression.

The siblings opened the front door simultaneously saying, "I'm off," sounding more lackluster than usual.

"Next. What do we call the first period in the six stages of the Paleozoic era when life exploded?"

"Cambrian."

"Alright, next. What is the most primitive land amphibian said to have appeared in the Devonian period?"

"Hint. Give me a hint."

"It has a goofy, cute face."

"That's not a hint!"

"The correct answer is Ichthyostega."

Sanae tilted the geography reference toward Yuzuno. Indeed, an illustration showed a creature that seemed a cross between a giant salamander and a lizard. But this, cute?

"I'm not confident in the Geography I've already reviewed..."

"Forget about it, sighing won’t help now."

Sanae bumped Yuzuno, whose shoulder bag was stuffed with textbooks, so much that it seemed it might collapse.

A long slope connected the main gate and school building of Kazekozan High School. Yuzuno and her friend Sanae exchanged questions as they climbed this listless gentle slope. The usual leisurely school-going scenery looked different today, reflecting the peculiar behaviors unique to term-end exams.

Some students chanted math formulas eccentrically as if reciting sutras. Others, engrossed in textbooks, stumbled into trees, seeing stars. A few shared mnemonic riddles with friends: "Remember 'claws scratch Clovis'." Two boys appearing to be second-year students swaggered past Yuzuno, sharing laughs.

"Did you see the article from the newspaper club yesterday?"

"I saw it, I saw it. I stayed up all night last night studying."

"Heh heh heh, how unfortunate, same here."

People are often proud of not studying, but it's rare to see them proudly admit studying.

"It seems like many are motivated. What's the newspaper club article about?"

"Yuzuno, didn't you know? Um, that's right, you went straight home yesterday after school..."

Sanae put the reference booklet back in her bag and rummaged through it, quickly retrieving a piece of paper:

"This was distributed after school yesterday. Didn't you check your phone? The seniors are having heated discussions."

It was a special edition of the "Kazekozan Times" issued by the newspaper club. A photo of the president challengingly pointing at the reader adorned the top, accompanied by a bold, oversized headline:

Emergency Notice for Second-Year Students! Let's Finish the Exam Papers and Head to the Aquarium!

Everyone! Tomorrow, the term-end exams will finally begin. Such a broad scope, so many subjects, no motivation, low efficiency.
Is everyone suffering as usual? To boost everyone's motivation, our newspaper club has planned an activity specifically for second-year students.

As everyone knows, our school publishes the names and scores of top-performing students after each exam. There are ten main subjects in the final exams, with a perfect total score being 1000 points. For the top three students lighting up the leaderboard among the 288 students, the newspaper club has decided to award additional prizes for their outstanding academic performance.

First place… 50 passes to the Marubi Aquarium in Yokohama.
Second place… Ditto, 30 passes.
Third place… Ditto, 18 passes.

These are the annual passes to the Marubi Aquarium that our special feature once covered, and they are rare! You can enjoy it with friends or give them away. The method of using the prizes is entirely up to the individual. Now, everyone, let us all brave the journey through hell that starts tomorrow!

"I see..." Yuzuno basically understood the situation. So the second-year students are so fired up after reading this announcement. While it's still debatable whether giving additional prizes for exams is appropriate, since it's a newspaper club activity, I guess no one would complain.

"What a pity! I wish there were prizes for the first-year exams too."

"Even if there were prizes, we wouldn't make the top three."

"That's true," Sanae shook her ponytail. "But how did Kaori get the prizes? There are nearly a hundred of them altogether."

"Oh. I guess... she got them from him."

As they reached the entrance, Yuzuno pointed across from the school building, where a thin boy was walking over.

His hair in front of his forehead gave off a melancholic vibe, and his half-open eyes seemed uninterested. A deep green tie hung loosely on his chest, and his black eyes stared at his smartphone screen, yawning every few steps.

He blended casually with the students entering the school from the north gate, even though he didn't actually need to "enter the school." He was there from the start, living a lazy, hidden life in an unused room of the cultural club activities building with a bed, appliances, and personal belongings moved in. His lifestyle itself had issues, and his character and mind were even more bizarre.

"Good morning, Risome!"

Hearing someone greet him, while looking at his phone, Risome Tama lifted his head and replied:

"Did you oversleep?"

"Huh?"

"Your hair on the right side is sticking up."

"Sorry to disappoint, but I got up on time this morning!"

"Then you just ate breakfast too slowly."

He nonchalantly concluded, then entered the entrance. Yuzuno followed behind him, gritting her teeth. Since her and Risome's assigned shoe lockers were close, she changed her shoes next to him.

"Risome, you look like you just got up."

"I didn't sleep much yesterday."

"Huh? Did you stay up studying? ...Wait a minute!"

"I got my 'Slashing Angel Dokuro' delivered, and I've been watching it."

Yuzuno was about to say, "I should've known better than to ask," but she ended up hearing the listless yet expected answer. Exams were coming, and she had no clue what he was doing!

"As expected of the top scorer in the last exam, so relaxed," Sanae said. "Going for a perfect score this time too?"

"I scored full marks last time because I had a credit crisis. This time, I don't want such an exaggerated score."

"But there are prizes for the top three places!"

"I know, they’re just the passes. Those were originally mine."

"Really?"

Sanae turned to Yuzuno, who answered, "Seems so."

About a month ago, during summer break, Risome was invited by the police to assist in solving a murder case at the Marubi Aquarium. The director probably gave him a hundred passes as a token of appreciation.

Kaori, a close friend who was always on good terms with Risome, probably persuaded him to contribute ninety-eight of them. Where the remaining two went is anyone's guess.

"But the newspaper club's idea is pretty dumb too."

Risome closed the shoe locker door with a thud, smirking wryly.

"When Kaori asked me for tickets, I thought they were for something big, turns out for that extra feature edition. What's the point of having dozens of those? Other people are just as interesting. If it were cash prizes, that'd be different, but for some tickets, they got so worked up..."

"But can't tickets be exchanged for money?"

Yuzuno muttered, and Risome, who was about to head to the classroom, paused:

"What did you say?"

"I mean, if you sell them to those ticket collectors or at exchange shops, you can get money, right?"

"The original price for a year-pass might be around four thousand yen. Given the rarity of Marubi's, even if others took advantage of the situation, it could sell for about a thousand yen, right?"

"Which means, if the first-place person sells all fifty, they could get fifty thousand yen..."

"Does the second place get thirty thousand yen too? Wow, that's fantastic! You could buy anything!"

"Wait! Wait! Wait!"

Risome interrupted the heated discussion of the two.

"Tickets can be sold?"

"Usually, yes. You didn't know?"

"No."

"Have you never bought a one-day ticket to Disney at an exchange shop?"

"Disinileyuan...?"

He responded as if speaking a foreign language.

"Could it be you don't know Disney?"

"Of course, I know! Don't underestimate me!"

"That's good."

"Isn't it famous for its hot springs?"

"Where did you get Disney confused with?!"

For this "shut-in" useless fellow, it was indeed too obscure a place. Oh, missing out on exchange shops was probably for the same reason.

As Risome said, no matter how manic the students of Kazekozan High were, they wouldn't take a few local aquarium passes that seriously. Yet the key was the phrase at the end of the report: "The method of using the prizes is entirely up to the individual." Since it's up to them, of course selling is allowed. In other words, the simple "prizes" can directly be converted into lavish "cash prizes."

First place: 50,000 yen. Second place: 30,000 yen. Third place: 18,000 yen.

Gaining good grades while receiving pocket money, no wonder second-year students were determined to strive hard.

"Everyone's this eager because of that... A bunch of money-hungry people!"

Risome punched the side of the shoe locker; who knows where he forgot himself.

"What a shame to give the tickets to Kaori."

"It's not too late. Those were my tickets in the first place; if I negotiate with Kaori to take them all back..."

Speak of the devil, Kaori Sakasaka appeared, heroically blocking Risome's path. With a red hair clip and red-rimmed glasses, a black camera hung around her neck. Her eyes were bright with no hint of morning grogginess. Beside her, the ever-expressionless, sharp-featured boy was Vice President Kento Kuramachi.

"You only just realized, it’s too late, Wise Man! I said 'give it to me,' and you said 'sure,' at that moment, the tickets became mine, nonrefundable."

"You're harsh. Wouldn’t it be nice to return them to me, Mr. Twenty Faces?"

"I said no! To reclaim the tickets, you must follow official procedures."

"...You mean, participate in the event?"

"Yes. If you score first in the exam, you can take half back. But, I don't know if it will be that easy."

The Master Criminologist flashed an invincible smile.

"Tama, even with your smarts, the second-year students are tough competitors. Like this guy, Kuramachi. Despite looking indifferent, he was the fifth top scorer last time!"

"Sorry, Risome, our president is talking nonsense again..."

"No problem, I'm used to it."

"Don't get used to it!"

Kaori raised her voice to her childhood friend Risome:

"In short, academically inclined students are all studying with 'Defeat Risome' in mind, with burning passion. Don't let your guard down!"

"Maybe he’ll take a big loss."

A girl chimed in from beside the shoe locker.

Risome furrowed his brows, as if to say "who’s this now.” The speaker was a regal-looking girl with naturally black short hair—it's Nao Sugawa, the captain of the girls' table tennis team. Yuzuno cheered:

"Captain Sugawa!"

"Good morning!"

The captain replied to her junior members' nods of greeting with a bright and concise "morning," then said:

"Risome, I was sixth last time, but I've been studying diligently. I might just make the top three."

"You want the passes too?"

"Who wouldn’t want free passes? Hakata, let's go to the aquarium after exams."

"Oh?! J-Just the two of us?"

"No, with the team members."

"Oh, okay... I'll go! Captain Sugawa must be first!"

"Sorry, but I'll be the first."

Risome said nonchalantly. His attitude had suddenly changed, and it seemed he also planned to give it his best shot.

"Didn't you just say it's silly to get excited over something like this?"

"Now that there's a chance to earn 50,000 yen, it's a different story."

"Though your motivation might be a bit impure, it doesn’t prevent us from having a good competition, Risome."

"Great, great, very spirited! My plan hasn't been wasted, even though Kuramachi is glaring at me."

A spirited Captain Sugawa and a sentimental Kaori, and a glowering Kuramachi. At that moment—

"Oh dear, did you all forget about me?"

A voice came from behind Yuzuno and the others. Turning around, they saw it was a graceful girl with lush long hair. Her moist eyes were solemnly fixed on Risome.

"Who are you?"

"Chizuru Yatsuhashi. You really forgot me?"

She stamped her foot on the floor in frustration. Chizuru Yatsuhashi, former vice president of the student council—with Kaori's words, she ranked third last time, ahead of Captain Sugawa and Kuramachi.

Chizuru coughed to regain her composure:

"Risome, you're quite relaxed. Do you believe you'll always be on top? You're very careless. If you slip up, you'll fall hard. Just like the former student council vice president you’ve long underestimated."

"Indeed."

"Don't mock me! I'm not a fool!"

The floor trembled again. The last time in August when Yuzuno saw this senior, she seemed different from before, almost like something happened between her and Risome...

"You just wait. I'll repay the humiliation I've suffered these last two months, twice over! I'll defeat you so thoroughly, an utter mess, bring you to tears, see how you continue to act high and mighty..."

"Sorry, excuse me..."

"Oh, sorry, sorry!"

Chizuru's curse was abruptly interrupted, and she embarrassingly stepped aside. Standing with arms akimbo, she naturally blocked the path, hindering a student from changing their shoes.

That student stepped past Chizuru and lightly began removing shoes in front of a shoe locker labeled "Year 2 (2) Class." It was a spectacled girl with big eyes.

Her lowered profile gave a delicate impression, as if drawn with a pen. Her soft black hair tied into twin tails hung down. A red bowtie neatly fastened on her lapel, and her socks and skirt length perfectly matched standards. The shoes were a pair of white sneakers. Although Kazekozan High didn't have specific shoe requirements, nearly all students wore loafers, so seeing someone with sneakers was rare. There was reddish-brown dirt on the tips of her shoes, and a band-aid wrapped around the base of her thumb.

Yuzuno felt she'd seen this senior somewhere, and searched her memory. Oh right, she’s the chair of the Library Committee. Yuzuno often saw her reading at the library's front desk or cafeteria. Her name should be Arisa—

"Good morning, Arisa!"

Kaori raised her hand. "You know her?" Risome asked rudely.

"She's Arisa Jomine from Class 2. She ranked fourth in the last exam. Even stronger than Nao and Kuramachi, right?"

"Oh, hello." The library chair nodded to him, then moved past Yuzuno and the others without looking at them.

Then Chizuru said jokingly, "Be prepared," before striding down the corridor. Kaori and the others said, "See you in class," and turned away. Captain Sugawa also left, leaving a cheerful note: "Hakata, do your best!"

"I want to go back."

In the quiet aftermath of the storm at the entrance, Risome’s face looked weary.

"You haven't even been to the classroom yet?"

"For Risome, isn't school just home?"

Yuzuno and Sanae were relentless, pursuing Risome to the stairs. Yuzuno, beside him, asked:

"Risome, you really can't remember people's names. Even I know the Library Committee chair's name."

"I just forgot momentarily."

"Can you say my name?"

"You're Hakata's sister, aren't you?"

That's not a name; it’s a surname and relation.

"But I'm surprised you didn't know the Library Committee chair ranked fourth last time," Sanae said. "They call her the 'Queen of the Library,' she has a very literary vibe."

"Not necessarily. She might unexpectedly be a wild child. She's not wearing loafers, but sneakers with dirt on them, and a band-aid on her finger..."

Yuzuno boasted of her observation skills, climbing the stairs with delight.

"Why does this mean she's wild?"

Risome paused again at the platform of the stairway.

"Uh... because of the band-aid on her finger."

"Aren't injuries common? I got hurt too, fell out of bed sleeping."

"But...but she’s wearing sneakers."

"Why are sneakers a sign of a wild child?"

"Because moving around a lot would require them. Is there another reason?"

Yuzuno asked crossly. Risome turned his gaze outdoors and said:

"For example, she rides a bike to school."

"Bike?"

"I often see her at the library near the station. Her home must be nearby. This makes buses or trains inconvenient, while walking is a bit far. So riding a bike is most likely. And few students notice, but biking to school makes sneakers ideal. Loafers easily slip off, aren't good for pedaling, and leather can wear out quickly if braked with foot. If she specifically wears sneakers for such reasons, then she’s careful with her belongings, thinks rationally, and prioritizes safety over fashion—a good girl vastly different from a wild child."

Finishing in one breath, he returned his gaze. Yuzuno and Sanae were stunned, processing his words slowly. Sanae responded first, albeit a tad late:

"Risome, you're amazing. You can infer so much about a girl's pair of shoes; you’re practically a pervert!"

"Risome, to think you go to a library! I thought you just stayed in your room watching anime."

"Your reactions aren't what I expected. But, thanks for the compliment."

Risome sarcastically replied expressionlessly, then continued up. A bell rang in the building: was it the bell before morning assembly? Oh no, she'd wasted her study time!

Yuzuno grasped Sanae’s hand, racing up to their first-year (Class 2) classroom. As they ran down the corridor, she recalled the Library Committee chair’s demeanor. It might’ve indeed been wrong to think of her as a wild child; she spoke softly and acted shyly.

No, there were subtle differences from shyness. How should I describe it? It was a deeper, troubled expression.

Younger Men

After nodding slightly to the officers outside, Sakiko Umeatama stepped through the automatic door into Kazekozan Library.
Although she worked in the same area at Hodono Valley, this was her first time coming to the library. The air conditioning wasn't very effective, and the carpet matched the color of her suit. Around her were local history materials, children's books to the left, and the library section inside—no matter which way she looked, there was paper and writing everywhere. She never handled such places well because she always felt suffocated as soon as she arrived.

To the right, against the wall, was a series of counters with signs in hiragana for "Consultation," "Lending," and "Return." Investigators moved back and forth at the "Lending" counter. Just as she was about to head that way, she heard someone say:

"Oh, here she comes, Officer Umeatama, you're really late."

A man approached her. He was a middle-aged detective, around fifty, with a crumpled suit open at the chest, smiling like a benevolent Buddha, which clashed with the scene's atmosphere. This was her superior, Shirato. Although he complained about Umeatama being late, there was no reproach in his tone. Umeatama gave a slight nod again, "Good morning! Officer Shirato."

"Is it a murder case?"

"It seems so."

"Is the crime scene at the counter?"

"No, there's bloodstain on the counter floor, but the body is on the second floor. I just took a look, and it seems to be quite an interesting case."

Shirato innocently announced. The cases he found interesting usually turned out to be quite tricky.

Umeatama leaned against the copier behind her, raising a hand with a convenience store bag, "I haven't had breakfast yet. May I eat here?"

"Eating or drinking is forbidden in the library."

"Well, it's better than committing murder in the library, right?"

She dismissed his remark unceremoniously and proceeded to unwrap her tuna salad rice ball, eating by herself.

She chewed on the seaweed while glancing at the notice board on the wall. Various local notices were posted: a concert at the civic hall, a children's center charity sale, "Volunteer Cleanup Every Monday at 17:30," and such. It seemed just like an ordinary public facility. Who would have thought a murder would happen here?

"What? The investigation headquarters is already established?"

"Yes, a joint investigation with the Prefectural Police. You know Chief Inspector Sendou from Division One, right? He was in charge of the Kazekozan case in June."

"I don't. I was doing training at the Totsuka Police Station at that time."

"Oh, I see... Anyway, he's the commander, a seasoned, pleasant person."

Shirato smiled. Anyone he described as pleasant often wasn't a good person.

"Is he here already?"

"No, he's said to be late due to a meeting. His detective is here assisting the initial investigation. You and I will support him together, so I'm counting on you. He also came during the festival at Ninshinji Shrine; you should know him."

She didn’t remember this person. During last month's summer festival, she was sent to help with external security. She did remember shooting several harsh glares at Shirato as he chatted with local high school girls.

"What is his subordinate's name?"

"It's Hakata, a young man."

"A young man—hmm. It would be nice if he were a tall, dark-haired, slightly melancholic handsome guy."

"Dark-haired?"

"That's my ideal type of man."

"Dark hair, huh."

Her superior touched his own thinning white hair.

"Officer Shirato is indeed out of the question for me. I like men younger than myself, like university students, for instance."

Actually, she liked middle school students, but she didn't want anyone to think she had criminal inclinations, so she never said it out loud.

"Well, if it's someone younger than you, Hakata might interest you. He's probably twenty-five."

"Twenty-five? He's a year younger than me and already in Division One? Annoying, an annoying guy."

"Umeatama, you don't hide your thoughts at all... but don't say it to his face."

"I know, I know." She answered dismissively, stuffing the remaining trash from her rice ball into her pocket. Just then...

The automatic door opened and then closed again. A young man she hadn't seen before walked into the library. He looked around, then headed in their direction.

"Officer Shirato, long time no see!"

"Oh, hello. Thank you for bringing us care packages last month during the festival."

"Oh, not at all, I caused you quite some trouble though... Hmm, and this is..."

The man turned towards Umeatama, who also looked at him and assessed instantly.

Build, no problem. Black hair, no problem. Good looks, passable. Age, within the permissible range. Melancholy... not at all. He gave an impression of being neat and tidy, making one wonder if he really was a detective.

"Sixty-five points."

"Excuse me?"

"Oh, nothing. I'm Sakiko Umeatama from the Hodono Valley Station. The kanji is 'Umeatama,' read as 'Umezu.' Please take care of me!"

"Oh, okay... I'm Yusaku Hakata, nice to meet you."

They exchanged smiles and shook hands. Shirato stood beside them, wearing an expression that suggested he was worried about the future.

* 

Despite having his holiday ruined, Hakata was full of energy.

"I'll be a bit late. Before I arrive at the scene, handle the initial investigation on your own," was the task handed to him by the chief inspector. Alone! Handle the investigation! What enticing words! After following the chief inspector for three years, the opportunity finally came. This was my case. No, this was my fate. I must showcase a dazzling investigation and reasoning to astonish my late-arriving superior.

"So—"

After greeting two area detectives, Hakata clapped his hands, gazing over the spacious library, and said:

"...What should I do?"

There was nowhere to go.

"Officer Hakata?"

The female detective called Umeatama called out to him. Hakata replied, "Present, no problem!" But in truth, there was a big problem.

In reality, this was his first time participating in an initial investigation without assistance from the chief inspector, and he was at a loss for what to do. All he knew beforehand was "someone was found murdered in the library." What should he do first? How did Chief Inspector Sendou usually handle things? An outline of the case? The victim's identity? No, confirm the body? Yes, the body. Where was it? Within the lending counter area, he could see investigators, so it must be there.

"Is the crime scene inside the counter? Hurry and look at the body..."

Hakata straightened up and walked to the entrance of the counter, turned like a dancer, and looked inside.

There was only a trace of blood on the floor.

"Has it been moved already?"

"No, the body is on the second floor."

"Oh, right. Okay. Hmm, then let's go to the second floor... no, wait, let's look at these bloodstains first..."

"Seems like he's useless."

"Huh?"

Umeatama's mumbled critique pierced his heart. Shirato interjected to save the situation:

"I’ll take you to the second floor first! I’ll brief you on the case on the way. Umeatama, I've arranged for the two first witnesses to wait at the reading table in the children's section. Can you ask one of them to guide us to the scene?"

Umeatama answered "Understood" and headed towards the children’s section. As she left, she didn't forget to shoot Hakata one last suspicious and sharp look. Her first impression was that of a good-hearted older sister, but in reality, she was quite stern.

"Sorry, my subordinate was rude, but she's a good person."

"Oh, not at all. She’s straightforward and wonderful, also very beautiful..."

"It's great that Hakata is also straightforward. Let’s proceed as usual."

He patted his left chest with a bang. Hakata collected himself and took out his usual notebook from his front pocket, flipped to a blank page, and extracted a pen, just as he often did with Sendou.

The older detective nodded with a smile and led the way to the stairs.

"The victim is a nearby university student with two head injuries, the second blow to the temple was likely fatal. The murder weapon was a book from the library, found on the floor nearby. The discoverers were the librarians here. They found blood inside the counter when they arrived for work at 7:30 this morning. When checking the second floor for any other abnormalities, they found the body."

"The body was already here when they arrived?"

Hakata stopped halfway up the stairs.

"Please wait. What is the estimated time of death?"

"Not precisely sure yet. It should be around ten o'clock last night.”

"Ten o'clock... was the library still open at that time?"

"Nope, it closes at five, and the staff leave by ten."

"So, the victim snuck into the library after closing?"

"And then was killed. Yes, that's the first mystery."

Shirato's words were loaded with hidden meaning, as was typical in joint investigations.

"It sounds like there are other mysteries as well."

"Something quite interesting."

Shirato flashed his aged teeth, continuing up the stairs. A sense of unease welled up within Hakata. Cases Shirato found interesting were usually difficult to handle.

The entire second floor was an open-shelf area, spacious and open. The floor was covered with the same light gray checkered carpet as the first floor. In front of them were computers for search purposes and low shelves for magazines, with three wooden bookshelf rows opposite them. Many book spines faced this way. Three rows of bookshelves aligned in parallel, extending inward. Even though it was a local library, it wasn't short on a sense of solemnity. There were four longitudinal paths between the bookshelves, including the sideways paths by the windows.

Shirato led Hakata through the computers and magazine racks to the passageway directly in front of the stairs.

Beyond three rows of bookshelves was a slightly more spacious area, laid with a rectangular bench parallel to the bookshelves. Opposite the bench, against the floor on the right, was a marker labeled "A," indicating the location of the evidence.

"The book thought to be the murder weapon was found there. Now the forensics department is examining it. I will have them bring it over later. The body was..."

Over there. No need for an answer; he'd already seen it.

Around marker "A," red splatters sprayed to the right. Perhaps someone tried to wipe it with something, as the stain traces were intermittent, soaking into the carpet.

About a meter forward lay a human body.

It was a male around twenty years old. His body lay close to a bookshelf, feet pointing this way. He was average height, on the slender side, in casual clothes, wearing a blue striped shirt and thin trousers with sandals. At his feet was a black shoulder bag.

The body was facedown, but the left side of his face lay on the ground, facing sideways. As Shirato said, there were two injuries on his head. One was above his right eye, with the swollen eyelid raised, and blood flowed down in two streams along the cheekbone and the left side of the face. The fatal wound seemed to be on the left temple. Because that side was pressed against the ground, it couldn't be seen directly. However, the blood pool about fifty centimeters in diameter spreading from the head center depicted how deep the wound likely was.

Moreover, scattered around the head were about ten books for some unknown reason. Some covers were face up, others opened, messily laid in the blood pool. Perhaps they fell from the bookshelves due to some cause.

The body's outstretched right hand formed an odd position, with the index finger pointing upward, its tip smeared with blood. Hakata pondered what it signified, stepping closer.

"Huh?"

He began to doubt his eyes. His confidence utterly deflated.

"Officer Shirato, is this...?”

Hearing him ask, the fifty-some detective answered with a cheerful smile.

"This is usually referred to as a dying message."

4 All the Information Seen This looks like a "く".

This character—a letter?—was a slanted line at a right angle, written very close to the blood pool on the floor. The character was about a centimeter wide, dark red in color, evidently traced with a blood-smeared finger. The lines slightly quivered, seemingly conveying the deceased's agony before death.

Meaning unclear as it stood. Whether fortunate or not, this wasn't the only piece of information.

Scattered around the corpse were numerous books. One lay right beside the mysterious "く," about thirty centimeters from the victim’s nose. The book cover faced up, its upper left edge touching the edge of the blood pool. It featured two characters drawn in a trending illustration style, one of whom had a red circle around their face. Could be a letter "O" or a number "zero."

Or—

"What do you think?"

Shirato’s voice drew Hakata back. Unsure how to answer, he managed a "I don't know."

"What we can be certain of is... if Inspector Sendou saw this, he’d definitely frown."

"Given that, let’s hurry..."

Shirato handed him a pair of gloves used for site inspections. Hakata pulled them onto his hands and squatted by the corpse.

The victim’s face twisted in agony, looking honest except for that. In the light, his hair still gleamed.

"Officer Shirato, who is he?"

"There’s his ID in the wallet inside the shoulder bag."

Hakata, as Inspector Sendou usually did, clasped his hands together lightly and picked up the bookbag lying at the feet. The bag's zipper was open, revealing its contents: a wallet, phone, student notebook, and leather pen case.

Opening the wallet, it held a student ID and driver’s license.

"Kyousuke Jomine, aged twenty. Yokohama National University, Department of Educational Anthropology..."

Yokohama National University, just one subway stop from Kazekozan. His home was likely also in the residential area five minutes from here. His ID photo was gentle, giving a calm impression, seemingly unrelated to any crime. However, why did this student die in such a place this way?

His money didn’t seem to have been taken. Other than that, there wasn’t much else from the wallet. He continued checking the other items.

The phone was a multi-functional flip phone, locked on standby. The top of the screen showed mail, power-saving, and other icons, requiring a password to view more. If no buttons were pressed, the screen dimmed after about ten seconds.

The campus notebook seemed to be for university, labeled with "Educational Psychology" course, but a general flip through revealed no unusual notes. Opening the pen case, besides pens and erasers, it was stuffed with various stationery. Stapler, ruler, correction fluid, pencil leads, and replacement blades for a utility knife.

"Curious. Spare blades but no utility knife."

"Check the right back pocket of his pants."

His attention turned to the back pocket on the body lying prone, revealing a yellow knife handle inside.

Drawing it out revealed it to be a utility knife. Typically called retractable, its flat screw at the base regulated slider function. Small and with a slender handle.

"The spare blades’ manufacturer and size match this. This utility knife was probably initially in the pen case, too."

"Why’s it in the back pocket?"

"Not sure. Was it for self-defense?"

Shirato jested. Hakata loosened the screw, extended the blade, and meticulously inspected it. Despite rust and slight tip damage, no blood, indicating no self-defense use.

"Is this everything the victim carried?"

"Yes. Besides that, there’s just his watch."

A cheap-looking digital wristwatch on his left arm showed the same current time. He glanced at the left hand, the middle and index fingers blackened with newspaper, manga, and magazine stains.

Feigning an air of reflection, he jotted these findings down in his notebook, leaning even closer to the body’s head.

"What about the scattered books?"

Shirato pointed at the nearby shelf with his chin.

It belonged to the section for domestic authors "Mo," at the precise eye level where the victim’s head lay, awkwardly empty. The last book next to it, an author named "Mori Hiroshi,” the scattered books around the corpse sported names like Masako Mori, Hiroyuki Morioka, Akio Morisawa, and Naruo Morita... all books originally on that shelf.
"Perhaps it fell accidentally for some reason, like someone touched it. I don't think it was thrown on purpose."

"Did the victim and the murderer fight in front of the bookshelf?"

"I don't know. More likely, the victim hit the bookshelf when he fell after being beaten."

"So, he wrote this character after falling..."

Hakata once again looked down at the enigmatic message. The "く" on the floor and the "〇" drawn on the book cover. He carefully picked up this book filled with mysteries. 

It was a softcover single volume, approximately three hundred pages thick. When he turned to the back cover, he found that the corner of the book near the pool of blood was stained red. He looked at the blood-stained carpet, and the part adjacent to the book formed a sunken right angle. This indicated that the book fell on the floor first and was later bloodstained.

He observed the details and noticed that the section where the pages were turned—the cross-sectional part—had several red lines that looked like something delicate had brushed across. However, this didn’t seem like any deliberate clue, perhaps it was from the victim's attempt to draw the "〇" and his fingernails scratched it.

The book's cover showcased a dynamic font for the title—"Remote-Controlled Detective". Below the title was the author's name, "Yao Jiankou", and the publisher, "Wenfu Publishing". A book with a title unfamiliar to him, an unknown pen name, and a publisher he hadn't heard of. In a corner of the cover was a barcode for borrowing, and the bottom of the book had a stamp reading "2010, Kazekozan Library", indicating it was purchased the year before. 

"So this is 'Remote-Controlled Detective'."

Shirato peeked over his shoulder at the book and said. 

"You know it?"

"This book was quite popular recently. It's a series, with a detective skilled at radio control as the protagonist, featuring various machines in each volume, kind of like 'Thunderbirds'. It was nominated for a bookstore award last year but lost to 'Mystery at the Dinner Table'."

"Oh."

"I think it's still available in bookstores. Haven't you read it?"

"I don't often read such books..."

"This is a detective novel, you know. Don’t you read them? You're a detective, right?"

"Precisely because I'm a detective, I don't read them."

He answered dismissively and looked back at the cover. The cover, with its vintage hues, depicted aircraft and submarines (perhaps radio-controlled). Two men in flat caps stood foregrounded against this backdrop. The one on the right was a youth with a baby face, and the one on the left was a fashionably dressed man who seemed to be holding a remote control. He was the one circled with an "〇".

"Is this circled person the remote-controlled detective?"

"Yes, he's the protagonist. He used to be an ace pilot in the Air Self-Defense Force."

"Why would such a person become a detective?"

"Readers can't figure that out either. His name should be Kogoyama..."

"Wright... Kogoyama Wright."

A soft response came from behind him. 

"It's said his name is derived from the Wright brothers. I read that in a magazine interview."

Turning around, he saw a bashful young man in his twenties standing there, with Umeatama beside him.

"You must be the first one who discovered him?"

"Exactly. This is librarian Masato Nasu."

Umeatama introduced him, and Nasu quietly added, "I'm Nasu." He had short hair, a round face slightly blushing, and despite the surname "eggplant", he actually looked like a tomato.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Hakata from the prefectural police."

Hakata returned "Remote-Controlled Detective" to its original place and picked up his notebook again. Hmm, how did Officer Sendou usually start the questioning?

"I assume you've already relayed the situation to the local police, mmm—can you tell us about it again? Please detail the circumstances of how you discovered him."

"Okay, sure."

Nasu nodded stiffly, occasionally glancing at the body with timid eyes as he recounted his discovery process. 

That day he had the morning shift and ran into Uehashi on the way, so they arrived together at the library. They noticed several strange things: the protective cover for the security padlock was open. Then they found bloodstains at the counter. To check for irregularities, they went up to the second floor, where they discovered the body. After the discovery, they immediately contacted the police and did not touch the body or murder weapon.

"The other librarian is..."

After finishing the questions, Hakata asked Umeatama.

"Her name is Hikari Uehashi, a woman of the same age as Nasu. She seems to have been quite shaken, so it's best not to call her over for now... By the way, what’s this character on the floor?"

"A dying message," Shirato said.

"A dying message? Ridiculous."

"Crime is usually ridiculous."

Hakata said in a teaching tone that made Umeatama's pretty face twist. Hakata turned back to Nasu and asked:

"Do you know Jomine?"

"Of course. He’s a regular here, even before I started working at this library. They say he’s been visiting weekly since childhood. Even after entering university, he often comes by whenever he has no classes, saying it’s more comfortable here than the university library. He’s a smart kid and talks to me often. Yesterday, he should have visited with his friend working on a project, leaving around four o'clock..."

"Around four o'clock. I heard this place closes at five. When did all the staff leave yesterday?"

"The business staff left just before five as usual, but we librarians stayed for a meeting. We all left together just after eight. I checked the clock just before leaving, so I'm sure."

"Jomine was killed approximately two hours after that, around ten in the evening. Could he possibly have hidden in the library after it closed?"

"No—that shouldn't be possible. We conduct a thorough check of the premises after closing, and the director is quite strict about it."

"You checked it yesterday as well?"

"Yes, I confirmed it with the director when leaving. There was definitely no one hiding inside."

"Then why was he lying here?"

Nasu’s smile froze on his face. Hakata flipped through his notebook, tapped his head with the pen, and said:

"Alright, let me ask it differently. Can you explain the library’s security system? Are there any exits that can be accessed from outside at night?"

"Security system... The automatic door at the front and the transport entrance at the back can't be opened from outside. Therefore, at night, the only possible entrance is the staff-only side door in the office."

"What kind of lock does that side door use?"

"An electronic lock. The door locks automatically; entering from outside requires a password. Because staff frequently enter and exit during day-time, the password is simple, '333', but at night the security increases, changing to a six-digit code."

"So the password is different during day and night?"

"It's computer-controlled. At five in the afternoon, the closing time, the lock automatically switches to night mode, reverting the next morning at opening time. Lighting in the bathroom in the open-stack area and sensors of the automatic door are linked to it."

"For a local library, that’s pretty intense," commented Umeatama.

"It’s required by the city, introduced just last month. To be honest, I find it a bit excessive too..."

Setting the password to something as simple as "333" during the day suggests this system might indeed be a bit excessive. It might indicate insufficient communication between management and frontline staff.

"Since it's computer-controlled, is it possible to check the record of when the door was used?"

"No, the system specifications don’t support that."

Hakata wanted to determine the time the murderer came and left, but his attempt failed.

"Then what is the password at night?"

"It’s '251026'."

251026… Hakata repeated the numbers, jotting them in his notebook. Although not hard to memorize, it’s a six-digit dispersed number that couldn’t be easily guessed randomly. 

"Is the night-time password known to all staff?"

"Only the librarians know. Our library staff aren't permanent and don’t work at night or early in the morning."

"I see. Then how many librarians are there?"

"Currently, there are five."

"Five, surprisingly few?"

"No, that’s actually quite a lot. The national average is nearly four librarians per library. Speaking of such positions..."

"Got it, got it."

Nasu became loquacious, and Hakata quickly stopped him. Though all civil servants are in the same boat, it’s tough everywhere these days. 

He pored over his notes and pondered. Entering the library at night requires the password. Only the five librarians, including Nasu, knew the password—

"In that case, the murderer is likely among the librarians," Shirato said. Nasu exclaimed, "How... how can you say that?" but couldn’t find a way to refute it.

"We have to consider that possibility. A librarian returned after closing, unlocked the library door, and let Jomine in. He was attacked inside the counter, leaving bloodstains on the floor, and fled to the second floor. The murderer caught up here and stabbed him. Just before dying, he used his own flowing blood to write the dying message..."

Their eyes again fell on the blood-written characters.

A deathbed message—circled Kogoyama Wright and the simple character “く”. “く” and Kogoyama, Kogoyama… 

Hakata asked:

"Is there anyone with the surname Kogoyama among the librarians?"

Not holding much hope, it was a shot in the dark. If Officer Sendou were present, he’d certainly be furious.

But Nasu responded affirmatively.

"There's a librarian named Taku Kogoyama who's been working here for nearly ten years... He should be well acquainted with Jomine."

This answer seemed to confuse him a bit, so he shifted his gaze again. Hakata and others were all shocked. The ink from the pen tip stopped halfway through a word began to seep out, leaving a small black blot on the lined page.

"Well, doesn’t that solve the case?"

Shortly, Umeatama coolly declared the solution.

5 Morning Call

Other library staff members had arrived for their shifts and were stopped by the police. However, Taku Kogoyama, the librarian scheduled to have a day off, had yet to show up even after opening time.

The investigators called his house but received no answer, and when they tried his cellphone, he picked up. He seemed to be hearing about the case for the first time, and his shock was evident, even through the phone. He said he’d come to the library as soon as possible, though he was out of town, heading to Shizuoka for some errands, and would need about two more hours.

Hakata thought it best to interview the staff after Kogoyama and the chief arrived, so he sent Nasu back to the first floor. This time, Shirato accompanied him.

That morning, Hakata had imagined enjoying a leisurely day while sipping coffee at his home, but now—gazing out at the residential area from the window—he cursed his bad luck. By the way, Yuzuno had mentioned her final exams started today, so she was likely struggling with difficult questions, just like him.

“What’s there to be worried about?”

Sakiko Umeatama interrupted his thoughts.

“That librarian named Kogoyama is the murderer, isn’t he? The victim wrote it himself."

"Yes, though I also think so, it somehow doesn’t feel solid to me… For instance, does this message truly point to Mr. Kogoyama?”

“The ‘く’ on the ground, Kogoyama is circled, and among the librarians, one is named Kogoyama. Only librarians can enter the library at night, what else could it be?”

“As clearly as you present your reasons…”

It's hard to argue against her.

“But if that's the case, why didn’t he directly write ‘Kogoyama’?”

“Because it has many strokes. The victim, close to death, tried to convey the murderer’s information, and writing the ‘く’ exhausted him. At that moment, he saw a character with the same surname in his sight, so he circled it. It’s easier this way!”

Her fluent explanation had Hakata backing down. This straightforward yet rational woman should appeal to Officer Sendou.

“I still feel it’s overly simplistic.”

Hakata pondered a bit and responded.

“Why didn’t the murderer notice the message’s meaning? If I were to kill someone and they left behind an ‘は’, I wouldn’t ignore it.”

Umeatama replied seamlessly:

“It’s not really conspicuous in its way… Even if he noticed, he might not have known Kogoyama Wright’s name, hence didn’t understand the message’s significance. Yes, it must be that. It’s also a reason the victim didn’t write ‘Kogoyama’ on the ground. Using symbols to indicate the character’s name is harder to understand than directly writing the name.”

“'Remote-Controlled Detective' was popular, but it was just a while ago, right? And Kogoyama Wright is the protagonist, surely, a librarian wouldn’t be unaware.”

“It's not like librarians and bookstore clerks read every book cover to cover.”

“Hmm, but…”

“You're so indecisive,” Umeatama crossed her arms, “A person fatally wounded and facing imminent death wouldn’t have time to intricately leave a message that exploits the murderer’s gap. I understand if you don’t feel secure without taking it for granted, but simply think about it…”

“What if the message is the murderer’s disguise?”

Hakata promptly asked again. Umeatama replied:

“Are you suggesting the murderer used the victim’s finger, substituting blood for ink, to leave a dying message?”

"Yes. Faking it to appear as if someone else committed the crime."

Before he finished, Umeatama laughed:

“If I were the murderer, I wouldn’t bother doing such an extra thing; I’d leave the scene immediately. Detective Hakata, have you been reading too many detective novels?”

“I don’t really read detective novels.”

“Really?”

“Yes. Because I’m a detective.”

“Detective Shirato often reads them.”

“Oh, as for him…”

“What about me?”

A hoarse voice picked up the conversation. Turning around, Hakata saw Shirato, who had gone to the first floor, return.

"I was just saying you have unique thoughts."

“I'll take that as a compliment. Please take a look at this.”

He handed over a book in a box looking like a dictionary, as if giving a gift.

“This is the murder weapon found dropped in the hallway by Nasu and others.”

Over 20 centimeters long, more than 15 centimeters wide, and nearly 4 centimeters thick. Not massive, but solid enough. In other words, this could serve as a weapon. The book itself was black; examining inside, it showed signs of having been repaired, with some pages once detached. The box was adorned with light green patterns; one corner had bloodstains. Scattered red dots marked the box’s back; on the front was boldly inscribed "The Illustrated Last Moments of Man".

While he hadn’t heard of “Remote-Controlled Detective”, the title was known to Hakata. A strange book written about thirty years ago documenting over nine hundred ways to die. Hakata couldn’t help but pout. A new edition might need to add new entries too. Jomine Kyouji, twenty years old, died from a head injury by “The Illustrated Last Moments of Man.”

“Does this book have fingerprints?"

“The murderer likely touched the bottom left and right corners, but they’ve been wiped clean. The blood is still under analysis. Moreover, there were two areas where fingerprints were wiped, over here.”

Shirato led the way, and as they moved past the crime scene, Hakata returned the weapon to its marked “A” position. The red spots on the box’s back appeared to be from the time the murderer placed the book, getting stained by blood that had splattered on the floor.
Exiting to the first floor and passing through the automatic doors to the outside, nearby residents, hearing the police sirens, gathered outside the yellow tape. Rounding the building's west side, there was an inconspicuous door immediately. 

A small light was installed above the door, and to the right was an intercom. Below it was a brand-new silver keypad resembling phone buttons, except that the position of the # symbol was a large button labeled "Enter." The keypad was housed in a box with a cream-colored plastic cover, currently open.

"The fingerprints on the keypad surface and door handle have been wiped off."

"So, nothing was found?"

"That's not entirely accurate. We found prints from Nasu when he opened the door this morning. However, despite this being a door used daily by staff, there were no other fingerprints. This means it was wiped clean last night."

"Was the culprit the one who wiped the fingerprints?" Umeatama asked.

"That's usually the case. The criminal probably used this door as well."

Hakata bent down, staring at the electronic lock's keypad. Seeing him extend a gloved finger, Shirato advised, "Press the enter button first." Hakata followed by pressing "Enter" and then three times "3," the daylight code Nasu had provided, "333." He turned the handle, and the door opened silently towards him.

Inside the office, blue-uniformed forensic personnel were busy working. To the right was a door connecting to the inner corridor.

"Have all the other door handles been wiped as well? Like the doors connecting to the corridor and the counter, and this door’s inner handle?"

"Only the keypad surface and the outer side of this door were wiped," Shirato reiterated.

"We discovered numerous fingerprints in other areas. We are still investigating who touched what, but the prints weren't wiped."

"So the culprit didn’t touch those places?"

"Or the culprit forgot to wipe them."

"If that's the case, it's more convenient."

Hakata released the door handle. It seemed equipped with a spring device, as it slowly and silently closed like when it opened. He gripped the handle again to test it, but it wouldn't open, confirming it was indeed automatically locked.

"Sigh, it's getting more confusing."

"Truly unreliable," Umeatama’s sharp words wounded him again. Earlier, she had commented, "Seems this guy is truly unreliable."

He attempted to retort but was distracted by the sound of digging, "Gawk Gawk Gawk.” A breeze blew, carrying the scent of red earth to his nose.

"Looks like some construction has started."

"Oh, right, there's ongoing work next door."

"Reportedly, the local center is being renovated."

Shirato pointed outside the library. Amidst the greenery, a white-fenced construction site could be seen. Workers in yellow safety helmets moved to and fro among the building’s framework. A two-story tiny building in the corner, likely a portable residential structure... Wait.

"Officer Shirato, you can see the library clearly from that portable building, right? Maybe the workers saw something," Hakata said excitedly.

"Yes, I thought so too. I already sent someone to investigate."

Beaten to the punch again. "Seems I'm no good," Umeatama murmured, feeling increasingly despondent.

"It’s been some time since he left. He should be back shortly... Oh, here he comes."

A man crossed through the yellow tape, approaching them. It was a detective from Hodono Valley police station whom they had seen during the gym incident. If he returned a bit sooner, Hakata could have avoided this situation.

No one noticed Hakata’s thoughts as the detective reported, "All went well!" And began his report.

"Yesterday, four workers stayed on the second floor of the portable building. From the window, they could see the west side of the library clearly - the office and second-floor windows. The curtains were open at midnight, so the workers remembered the library’s situation well.

First, at eight o'clock, the building’s lights went out. After that, the lights didn’t turn on again, meaning no one turned them back on. However, they saw flickering lights in the second-floor window three times."

"Three times..."

"The first time was an hour and a half after the lights went out, around 9:30 p.m. The second was another 30 minutes later, around 10 p.m. The third was after another hour, around 11 p.m. Each time they saw the light, the workers mentioned the library must have hired a night watchman recently, so they remembered it well."

The flickering light at night was probably a flashlight. However—

“There wasn’t a flashlight near the victim. Did the culprit take it?”

“Maybe it wasn’t a flashlight, but light from a mobile phone?” Umeatama suggested. “It could be used as a substitute for a flashlight.”

“Oh, right.”

“It’s a convenient age now,” Shirato nodded thoughtfully, “but it still doesn’t explain why the light appeared at different times. The death time of 10 is understandable, but 30 minutes before and an hour after...”

9:30, 10, and 11. If there was seen light, someone must have been inside. Who was it and what were they doing? This was Shirato's "first mystery."

“In any case, we need to verify the victim’s actions last night… Officer Shirato, did you send someone there?”

“Yup. They are now investigating at Kyouji Jomine’s home, results should come soon… Oh?”

Shirato turned, looking at the entrance door as an investigator opened it and came out. It was a forensic officer in a blue uniform, not there to report the victim’s family situation.

Without enthusiastically saying "all went well," he reported gravely, “It’s not good.”

“We just examined the bloodstains left on the counter. It's type B.”

“Huh?”

Hakata nodded, puzzled, and asked, “What’s the matter?”

“There’s a big problem. Because the victim has type A blood.”

Hakata recorded this information mechanically. Reflecting after glancing away from his notebook, he finally realized the magnitude of the problem. Umeatama and the reporting detective exchanged shocked looks, while only the construction noise echoed distantly.

“Another mystery,” Shirato remarked, touching his furrowed forehead.

“Yesterday, the person attacked in the library wasn’t just Kyouji Jomine.”

Thirty minutes later, the detectives reconvened at the second-floor stairway bench, deep in thought. Shirato closed his eyes, angling his head like he was napping. On the adjacent bench sat Umeatama, legs crossed, impatiently tapping the floor with her shoe. Hakata paced in front, flipping through his notebook.

New forensic results came from the book used as a weapon. Blood on the corners of “The Last Picture of Man” was of two types. One was type B, the other type A. First was the B type, after four to five minutes as it dried somewhat, A type blood was added.

That means the book struck two people. In sequence, the person leaving blood on the counter was hit first, followed minutes later by Kyouji Jomine. Clarifying this only deepened the central mystery.

Who was attacked at the counter?

"The real identity of the B type person has two possibilities: the killer or a third person," Hakata summarized his thoughts.

"If the killer, then first Kyouji Jomine attacked the murderer, who then bled and countered, leading to Jomine’s death—a mutual killing. If a third person, the murderer attacked both."

"But," Shirato opened his eyes and spoke, "If the latter, why isn’t there a body at the counter?”

"The counter’s blood wasn’t life-threatening, perhaps the hit person survived and escaped, or the killer moved the body."

Either way, neither possibility was pleasant.

“Beyond a third mystery, the first concerns me more—what was the victim doing in the library at night?” Shirato shared his thoughts, returning his head to its previous angle.

“Perhaps the killing was impulsive, the weapon and fingerprint wiping are testimonies. If the killer intended murder from the start, a more suitable weapon rather than a book would be chosen, and wiping prints indicates no gloves were worn. So it's not a planned crime… But then, I’m even more puzzled by the late-night library happenings.”

“Could it relate to other crimes?”

“Possibly drug deals. I’ve seen a cartoon where a librarian deals drugs.”

“Drug... drug deals? Quite a capable librarian.”

“Whatever it is, we’ll know from asking the killer,” Umeatama interjected, “ask the librarian named Koyama.”

“Hehe, Officer Umeatama is concerned about the second mystery?”

“I don’t care which number it is, the victim left information, so no doubt can exist.”

“Yet Officer Umeatama, that seems hasty…”

“You’re indecisive.”

“Ah!”

Hakata finally kneeled. As Shirato continued speaking to himself,

“Perhaps that '〇' is the letter O. Rotate the 'く' and it becomes an L. Then the killer is Mr. OL.”

“Officer Shirato, could you not speak?”

“I’m joking, joking. But we should consider the possibility that '〇' refers to Koyama Wright being targeted. His face is circled by coincidence, considering his surname matches the suspect’s, it’s too coincidental.”

“If it's not a character name, there's no reason to write it on the cover… But this seems to make Koyama the suspicious librarian.”

Hakata, looking to review the victim’s discovery record, opened his notes just as—

“Wait!”

Umeatama grabbed his wrist, peering at the notebook in surprise, "You recorded the scene and testimonies so detailed... while talking to us, compiling?”

“Yeah, for the inspector.”

“Why can you do that?”

“Why? Inspector Sendou requested all information be recorded, plus I'm naturally good at it.”

Whether Umeatama heard this explanation was unclear. She stared wide-eyed at Hakata as if discovering a new continent. “Are you... perhaps capable?”

As she muttered this—

“The inspector's here!” A detective called from downstairs. Hakata quickly assumed a "be careful" stance, and the others rose from the bench.

In moments, Inspector Sendou climbed upstairs with firm steps.

He was tall with broad shoulders, gray suit open at the front, around fifty-five years old. Rarely seen, he was promoted from the bottom within the first division. Short hair speckled with silver and long narrow eyes, deep in his wrinkles, honestly reflected his vibrant criminal inquiry experience. 

After a brief greeting with Hakata and others, the inspector went to the site of the body. It's presumed he received general information in advance. His gaze fell upon the backpack on the ground, the victim lying there, and the scattered books. After confirming these, his eyes fixed on the message written in red. Then came a:

"You bastard!"

Just as Hakata warned, Inspector’s severe face became even more so.

*

From the view of Class 2(1)'s classroom, first-year students leaving school could be clearly seen.

Club activities were prohibited during exam periods, so everyone headed straight for the school gate. Smiling tiredly, the girls seemed to discuss exam answers or lunch plans. Amemura Shintarou stood by the window, observing the courtyard and thinking he was hungry too. The third-period exam had only been over for fifteen minutes. Eating lunch after invigilating meant quite a wait.

He returned his gaze to the classroom. Forty heads came into view. Students had their faces to their answer sheets, silently scribbling away. Unlike first-years, allowed to go home after two exams, second and third years had three. To ensure students took exams more seriously, this test’s difficulty was notably raised. He looked forward to grading.

Leaving the window, Amemura began his second classroom patrol.

Due to past cheating incidents, Kazekozan High demanded monitoring teachers patrol to counter improper behavior. Observing each student’s seat, his gaze declared not missing any suspicious action. Drama club’s Kajiwara, brass band’s Yamabuki, newspaper club’s Sakasaka. Usually carefree students treated exams seriously today… Somewhat overly so. What’s with their enthusiasm this time? Amemura was perplexed, not aware that the puppet master was newspaper club president Sakasaka, nearby.

Nevertheless, treating exams seriously is indeed good. The careless teacher reassured himself and moved forward.

But reaching the back of the classroom, he found an exception—a student not serious.

“Risome, wake up!”

Amemura called to a student slumped on his test paper near the window. He lay motionless, breathing rhythmically—sounds associated with sleep.

“Hey! No sleeping!”

He tapped Risome’s head with the attendance book. Risome groaned and shifted, yet slumber’s breath persisted.

“Hey! Risome…”

Just as Amemura tried calling him again, Teritoritorite, teteumu. Teritoritorite, teteumu.

The familiar tune from "The Flintstones" played by his ear, thankfully stopping after two notes. Students murmured behind him. Amemura’s hunger turned to stomach pain.

Risome Risome sleepily raised his head, blinking at Amemura.

"Sorry, I fell asleep."

“Nothing else?”

Risome tilted his head, "Good morning!"

Amemura staggered back two or three steps—Ah, thankful he wasn’t this guy’s homeroom teacher.

“Turn off the phone power! Immediately!"

“Huh?” He pulled out his smart phone: “Oh dear, there’s a message.”

“Who told you to look? It’s exam time! Quickly turn off…”

But before Amemura finished, Risome stood abruptly, eyes fixed on his phone.

“Hey! Hey! What happened?”

“I’m leaving early.”

“Leaving early?”

Risome seemed serious. Swiftly packing, he left his seat and headed for the exit. The classroom grew louder in chatter.

“What’s going on?” Sakasaka Kaori asked. Risome replied, "Someone's looking for me."

“Wait! Risome, you really planning to leave?”

“Something urgent came up. Just collect my paper.”

“Urgent?”

What could be important enough to abandon an exam? Was it related to the phone message? Who was looking for him? Family?

“Could it be something happened to your family…”

Hearing Amemura's murmur, Risome stopped near the classroom door. He thought briefly and replied:

“It’s probably not family, but someone seems in trouble.”

He casually dropped this line then closed the door.

Amemura soothed the class back to order. Within ten seconds, the room resumed its calm. He sighed, rubbed his stomach, returned to Risome’s seat, picked up the answer sheet on the desk.
He stared dumbfounded at the clock on the wall. There was still about two-thirds of the exam time left. When did Risome start sleeping? Ah, luckily, it wasn't his homeroom teacher.

The questions that Masamura painstakingly crafted were all answered. The answer sheet was filled from top to bottom, with the exception of the last small question, left blank seemingly to adjust the score.

6 Flashlight Power, Awakening

The first day of exams went by reasonably well. 

The first subject was geography. The studying done days in advance didn't go to waste; questions about earthquakes, minerals, and Earth's history were all answered smoothly (incidentally, the oldest amphibian, Ichthyostega, wasn't on the test). The second subject, classical literature, which had worried her, also went better than expected, thanks to not dozing off in class, avoiding the worst disaster. She should at least be able to score an average.

However, it was too early to relax. Among the subjects, the biggest enemy was chemistry. No matter how many times she read the textbook, she couldn't understand molarity, and Avogadro's number was almost indistinguishable from Morin butter.

Given the circumstances, Yuzuno planned to study diligently by herself. She bid farewell to Sanae at the station and headed to Kazekozan Library. The district where Yuzuno lived was just two blocks away from the library, and she had often stopped by on her way home from school. It was cool and quiet, and a well-kept secret that wasn't very crowded—

"Oh?"

But as soon as she stepped into the library courtyard, she was met with an unpleasant surprise.

The area in front of the library was bustling with people and noise. Through the gaps in the crowd, she noticed yellow tape and colorful cones. The building seemed to be cordoned off.

"Excuse me, has something happened?"

She asked a nearby middle-aged man. He glanced at the arched roof and replied, "Seems someone was killed."

"Uh?"

"It's really troublesome. I came to renew Shoji Shina's book. Now I can't proceed with the renewal process, and it's due today. In this situation, even if the return date is overdue, they should extend it, right? I haven't finished reading it. What do you think, young lady?"

"I don't know about that... Thank you."

It seemed she wouldn't get any significant information. Acting nonchalant, Yuzuno walked away from the man and planned to circle around to the back of the building. Attempting to move aside, she was again blocked by the yellow barricade tape. Stretching her neck, she saw two police officers standing in front of the automatic door. It seemed the man was telling the truth. Someone really had been killed. Who could it be?

A feeling of unease welled up within her. At the end of June at Kazekozan, a murder had just occurred, with the broadcasting station head killed in the gymnasium. Could this victim be someone she knew...?

Amidst the clamor, she heard the screech of brakes.

Turning around, she found a car had pulled up beside her. It was a silver sedan. The rear door opened, and a young man got out. He carried a shoulder bag, a deep green tie hung lazily around his neck, and he was holding a takeout sushi pack.

"Is that... Risome?"

Hearing her greeting, Risome turned towards her while stuffing a gourd roll into his mouth.

"Your hair that was sticking up is lying flat now."

"Hello."

Yuzuno reached up to touch her hair. During the break, she had asked Sanae to help brush it down, and indeed it was neatly in place. But this man—did he want to become a scholar of unruly hair?

"What are you doing here? And why did you come by car?"

"I'm working. I want the Blu-ray of 'Anohana'."

"'Anohana'? Which flower is that?"

"Thanks for the help! I'll trouble you on the way back too!"

Risome spoke to the person in the car. The driver’s side door opened, revealing a man in a suit.

"Why do I have to do this?"

The weariness in his voice reminded Yuzuno of his name: Officer Hatori. Last month's aquarium case had forced this new detective in Division One to play chauffeur to the lazy Risome. Though Yuzuno felt sorry for his plight, she had hitched several rides as well.

Thus, Officer Hatori brought Risome to Kazekozan Library. With the library being cordoned off by the police due to a case inside...

"Did the police call you here? For the murder case?"

"You're well-informed! Are you the murderer?"

"Maybe I have an alibi."

"Rule out one person," Risome said without the slightest hint of humor. "Hold this for me."

The sushi pack and the bag were thrust into Yuzuno's hands, forcing her to take them.

Just then, a gruff voice broke in: "Ah, hello!"

"So we meet again. Quite luxurious to come by car."

Heading towards the library, she encountered another familiar detective—Shirato from the Hodo Hills Police Station.

"The chief is waiting inside for you. Going through the main door is too conspicuous, so I'll lead you in through a side door."

"Hello, Officer Shirato!" greeted Risome cheerfully, "By the way, could you bring her in too?"

"Oh, right, Hakata's sister. You hired her as an assistant?"

"She's here to carry my bag."

"Her brother's in there too, so it should be fine. Come on in."

The well-meaning detective lifted the yellow tape and smiled at them. Risome ducked under it and strode towards the building.

Yuzuno glanced at the discounted-labeled sushi in her hand and his retreating figure: "Calling me a bag carrier!"

Letting out this delayed retort, she reluctantly followed Risome.

Guided by Shirato, they passed through a spacious office and a short corridor, arriving behind the counter. The open-access area was still relatively empty, with only three people waiting at the stairs.

One was a rugged-looking man, another was a woman with hair pinned behind her ear wearing a suit, and there was her dejected-looking brother. The "Hodo Hills case" mentioned on the phone this morning appeared to be this case.

"Yu... Yu... Yuzuno?! Why are you here?!"

Upon seeing his sister, the brother writhed, holding his head. The female officer shouted imposingly:

"Officer Shirato!"

"What’s wrong, Officer Umeatama?"

"What do you mean 'what’s wrong?' What are you doing?! I don't care what orders you received from the Chief, bringing unauthorized personnel to the scene is a violation! And it's not just any adult, but a high schooler... high... schooler!"

Officer Umeatama attempted to confront Shirato but inexplicably halted midway, wide-eyed, staring at the passing Risome and muttering softly, "Perfect score."

Seemingly paying no mind to his subordinates, Sendou cross-armedly fixated his long eyes on his nemesis. Finally facing Risome, he begrudgingly said:

"Sorry for calling you so suddenly."

An unexpected line. Sendou, who had thus far disliked Risome, although grudgingly sought his help, had never been so courteous. Perhaps the two cases solved had earned positive evaluation and softened his edges.

"No problem!" Risome said, "I was just taking a physics test at school."

"That's no problem?"

"I finished all the questions."

Sendou’s lip twitched slightly. It appeared his opinion changed, finding this guy annoying again, repeatedly feeling his irksomeness.

"Anyway, thank you for coming during the exam."

Answering Risome sarcastically, Sendou then turned to Yuzuno: 

"I heard you like sushi, quite a traditional taste. It's indeed lunchtime, but if you want to eat, do it outside the library."

"This... this isn't mine. I was holding it for Risome."

"Oh, I see," Sendou fixed his gaze back on Risome, "Eat it outside if you want!"

His tone had become rather overt.

"That lady appears to have eaten a rice ball inside. There's seaweed crumbs on her coat collar, and a convenience store bag is visible from her coat pocket. If she ate outside, she should have thrown it in the trash bin at the entrance."

Risome’s steps were light. Umeatama blushed: "How embarrassing, he called me 'sister.'" Another enigmatic reaction. Sendou, still sturdily controlling his facial expression through sheer willpower: 

"Alright then... Let’s get to the point. Hakata, give him the notebook."

"Why is Yuzuno here too? Actually, when I heard Risome was coming, I had a bad feeling, but I didn't expect you to actually come along. Are you always together? What’s going on here? You two are already totally..."

"Hakata!"

"Yes!"

Bowing to his superior’s order, her brother handed the notebook to Risome. Sendou grumbled obnoxiously, "Everyone’s like this," then cleared his throat to say:

"The victim is a twenty-year-old university student, Kyoujyo Jomine. He is in his second year at Yokohama National University."

He immediately began outlining the case.

How the scene was discovered, the condition of the body, the night-time security system of the library, and the blood found at the counter. The murder weapon, fingerprints, and the message left by the deceased.

"What’s troubling us now is how to interpret this message. It seems to point to the librarian named Koyama, but we are not sure. In my thirty years as a detective, it's the first time I've encountered a body with a self-provided dying message. I think you're more equipped for this kind of problem. You'll have five minutes to observe the scene, then give us your opinion."

"......"

"If your insights lead to the arrest, I’ll give you a reward."

"It's all on me, I'll solve it at lightning speed."

Having been silent, Risome suddenly burst with enthusiasm, smiling at Sendou for the first time. Truly a man driven by money.

"Right this way, please."

Shirato led them upstairs. Yuzuno wanted to follow but was blocked by her restored-position brother.

"You don't need to come. Stay here. Go back."

"Bro, is 'Jomine' the victim's surname?"

"Why?"

"Isn't it related to Arisa Jomine of the library committee?"

"Huh? Oh, haven’t received any reports on family ties yet... Now, get going!"

"I'm going too!"

Yuzuno wasn’t Risome's follower, and she wasn't a thrill-seeker going as far as to get involved in a murder case for excitement in daily life. She’d rather focus on reviewing chemistry, modern society, and Math A promptly.

However, an unsettling feeling stopped her.

The victim's surname "Jomine," same as the library committee chair Arisa Jomine. They could be unrelated, but they might be family or relatives. Thus, Kazekozan’s students may be embroiled in the affair. Besides, Risome mentioned her frequent visits to the library, and this piece of information concerned her.

Are Kyoujyo Jomine and Arisa Jomine related or unrelated? At least she wanted to verify that.

Slipping past her brother with her table tennis team's agility, Yuzuno followed Risome. Sendou side-glanced and said:

"You coming too?"

"Because I'm holding the bag!"

She displayed the sushi and the bag in her hand. The police chief grunted discontentedly:

"Suit yourself... Though I think you'll regret it!"

A minute later, Yuzuno indeed regretted it.

The group stood in line in front of a bookshelf, overlooking the man’s body on the ground—pale, motionless, and bleeding from the head, Kyoujyo Jomine.

Facing a corpse wasn't her first time. During the gymnasium case, she and Sanae were the first discoverers, but that didn't mean the second time was any easier. Yuzuno swallowed hard, hiding behind her following brother, even Risome appeared uncomfortable. 

"No one said there were still bodies here."

“I thought that too. Because I didn’t tell you.”

Sendou said maliciously, handing his nemesis a pair of gloves for examining the scene. 

"You see, everything is kept as it was at discovery. You may begin."

Risome reluctantly accepted the gloves, stepped forward, and began his work. Yuzuno timidly peeked past her brother watching.

Risome first glanced through her brother’s notebook, confirming key points with his fingers. The corpse. Several books scattered. Where these books originally resided. The bag. And the weapon.

"There are small splashes of blood from the weapon’s vicinity to the body’s feet."

"Oh, probably splattered from when he was struck."

"However, every blood droplet is strange, sporadic, as if wiped with something."

"Perhaps the criminal cleaned the ground."

"Wiped...?"

Repeating Sendou's words, Risome picked up the "Book of the Dying."

"The floor beneath the weapon is also spattered with blood. But it’s different from elsewhere, not discontinuous."

He muttered softly, examining the book closely, even taking it out of its box, but he soon lost interest and returned it to its original position.

Next, he approached the body, picking up some books fallen to the ground. Most had been touched by blood flowing from the head, yet the floor beneath them remained spotless.

"Seems the books were already on the ground before the blood spread."

"Yeah," Shirato said, "possibly knocked down when he fell."

"I see."

Risome briskly returned to the weapon’s spot, recreating the motion of the victim with avant-garde ballet-like posture.

"He stood here, first struck on the right eye. As he stumbled and crouched, his left side was hit again. Blood spattered on the floor. The blow's force spun him rightward, staggering forward two or three steps, attempting support hands on the ground, ultimately crashing his arm into the shelf. The books were pushed off, tumbling down. Moments later, he collapsed too, blood from his head spreading over the carpet."

"And then he wrote the message?"

The chief interjected. Risome ignored him, crouching before the backpack, browsing the notebooks inside, turning on the phone's screen, tossing it aside, and rummaging the leather pen case's contents.

"Hey, who's this kid?"

Umeatama quietly asked her brother.

"He's a search consultant, right? We pay him to assist the investigation."

"Is he effective?"

"He’s solved two cases already. June’s gymnasium case and last month’s Marumi Aquarium case."

"Oh, impressive."

Umeatama's eyes gleamed with a girlish glow, then she glanced at Yuzuno and asked again: 

"And this girl?"

"That’s my sister."

Yuzuno and Umeatama exchanged brief, wordless glances. Umeatama immediately asked her brother again: 

"Why is your sister here?"

"I want to know too."

"Brother."

Just as her brother lamented, Risome called out to him. He had just retrieved a utility knife from the pocket on the back of the body.

"This utility knife’s blade is slightly chipped. Did you find the fragment?"

"No, might it have already been chipped?"

"The entire blade, including the folding part, is rusted, yet the break exhibits no rust. Indicating limited air exposure, implying the break happened recently."

He coldly explained while placing the knife back into the pocket. Glancing around the scene with a complex expression, like a passenger waiting for the train on the platform, he tapped the ground three times with the tip of his shoe.

"Oh, I see. The restroom."

The sudden revelation left everyone questioning their ears.

"Restroom?"

"Didn’t you understand? Detective, it’s the toilet. Also called a bathroom, washroom, water closet, restroom, lavatory, lavabo, privy, snow screen, latrine. Call it whatever you want. There should be one on the second floor too."

"Huh? Oh, past the dictionary section to the restroom, there's one compartment, unisex."

"Already checked?"

"The investigation staff should have examined it."
"I don't know the specifics... oh, wait." As soon as Risome heard this answer, he hurriedly picked up his pace. His brother followed behind him, and Yuzuno, who was hiding behind her brother, naturally accompanied him.

"Risome, are you going to the restroom? Is it because you felt nauseous after seeing the corpse?"

"I do feel nauseous, but I'm not going to throw up."

"Then what are you going to do?" his brother asked. "Are you looking for toilet paper like at the aquarium?"

"No, this time I'm looking for a blade tip."

"A blade tip? From a utility knife?"

They retraced their steps back to the corridor, turned right in front of the stairs, and arrived at the newspaper and dictionary section. To the inner side of the left wall, there was a sliding door marked with a unisex symbol. Risome opened the door and went inside. The sensor reacted, and the lights turned on automatically. It was a relatively large room without windows. On the right was a toilet with the lid closed and a toilet paper rack. In front was a small sink, with a piece of paper saying "Caution: Cracks" pasted on it. It seemed that a mirror was behind the paper.

Yuzuno and her brother looked around the interior of the restroom. The flat floor tiles were spotless.

"Where did you say the blade tip was?" the brother asked. But Risome didn't answer and silently took action. He moved around with his face close to the ground, opened the toilet lid, and pulled out the toilet paper. After a lap around the room, he inspected the sink and finally spoke, "Turns out I was wrong."

"You thought the utility knife's blade tip was here?"

"I thought it might be, but apparently not."

"I can't understand what you're doing, but it seems like a waste of time. Let's head back."

"Waste? That's an exaggerated term, brother. My efficiency is high... wait!"

Risome suddenly leaned close to the paper marked "Caution: Cracks."

"There are traces of it being reapplied."

The edges of the notice paper were secured with clear tape, and upon closer inspection, there was a subtle discrepancy between the wall color along the tape and the surrounding area. It indeed looked like it had been adhered again. Risome carefully peeled off the paper, holding the clear tape. As expected, it covered a mirror. Several cracks were on the left side, likely covered with the notice due to their danger. However, he wasn't concerned about this point; he focused on the underside of the peeled tape.

A three-millimeter silver fragment was on the underside of the tape in the lower left corner.

"Guessed right." Risome contentedly pinched the fragment, handed it to his brother, and said, "Please turn this over to forensics."

"Is this... the utility knife's blade tip?"

"It's hard to think of it as anything else. But brother, this restroom’s only lighting is sensor-operated. Do the sensors work at night?"

"No, all the sensors are linked with electronic locks, so they don't operate when the facility is closed."

"All of them? The first-floor restroom too?"

"Yes, but the staff restroom in the office area should be usable since its lighting isn't sensor-operated."

His brother answered accordingly and then, as if just realizing something, asked, "Why does it matter?"

Risome pondered with a thoughtful expression, reapplied the notice back, and started pacing the restroom again.

"Is there anything else to find?"

"Something else that's missing from the scene... never mind, let's go back for now."

As if finishing his work, he whistled while exiting the restroom. The melody was from Yosui Inoue's "Into Dreams." Yuzuno and the others passed by the front of the stairs once more and returned to the scene.

Meatama was daydreaming, Shirato looked utterly delighted, while Sendou was visibly irritated: "If you want to go to the restroom, you should raise your hand for permission; didn't you learn that in elementary school?"

"I don't remember. I'm a victim of relaxed education."

The chief seemed about to blow his top, but when his brother handed him the fragment and recounted what had happened, he wore an expression as if he were being pelted by a bean-firing machinegun. He wanted to say something to Risome but quickly shut his mouth again. In a grumbling tone, he said, "Thanks for your help."

Risome raised his hand slightly in acknowledgment. Then, he finally picked up the book with the death note.

"This is Youko Senigma's 'Remote-Control Detective.'"

"Oh, you know it!" Shirato exclaimed, his eyes gleaming.

"Of course," Risome nodded, "the second part is particularly fantastic. The long-distance trick is unprecedented in mystery novels."

"I would say that's not quite fair. The most crucial clothes hanger wasn't described sufficiently."

"There are such criticisms on the internet, too. But I believe it's because people don't interpret it deeply enough. If you deduce from the opening description and Koyama's lines, you can understand that the hanger in the bathroom is plastic..."

"Can you see the death note?" Sendou finally ran out of patience.

Risome indicated "I can hear you," just like when examining a murder weapon, scrutinizing the 'Remote-Control Detective' from various angles. He paused when he saw the side of the book.

"Officer, what's with the bloodstain on the fore-edge, the side opposite the spine? It's like a thin line."

"Oh, that. It should be from when the victim circled it with their nail."

"With a nail? No, not a nail. The victim's nails were trimmed neatly. Even if it were a finger, it wouldn't leave such a fine mark."

"Then what do you think it is?"

Risome didn't answer but continued a staring contest with the fore-edge. Then, his gaze shifted back to the death note on the cover—no, he returned the book to its original place. His next action was even more unbelievable.

He kneeled in front of the corpse, grabbed its head, and with a swift motion lifted it a few centimeters.

"Ri… Risome, what are you doing?" the detective exclaimed. Risome seriously examined the space between the head and the ground and said:

"The side of the face isn't stained with blood."

He murmured again and then placed Kyouko Jomine's head back where it was. The fear of touching the corpse seemed to have vanished. He peered closely at the corpse, observing it from head to toe, then tilted his head in puzzlement. 

Then, he moved to the bookshelf labeled "Authors starting with Mo," walked from one end to the other — just like in the restroom, it seemed like he was looking for something, widening his eyes and inspecting everywhere, but without conducting another detailed investigation.

After pacing back and forth twice, he stopped and began to announce his investigation results: 

"There's no flashlight."

"What did you say?"

"Flashlight. According to the testimony from the construction site, the library lights hadn’t been turned on after 8 o'clock, right? However, there were a few instances of light on the second-floor window, like a flashlight. This indicates that whatever the victim attempted to do at the night-time library, he had to carry some sort of light source. Otherwise, he couldn't have roamed around the night-time library. Yet, there's no flashlight at the scene."

Risome surveyed the shelves for confirmation... indeed, there were no such tools. "There's none around, not in the backpack, nor in the pockets, and not in the restroom either. It's puzzling. So, where is the flashlight?"

Risome started pacing again. Sendou and his brother exchanged worried glances as if questioning: "Was bringing this guy here a mistake?"

"Hey... you should know there's this convenient invention called a mobile phone, right?" 

"Are you saying he used his phone's light to see his way?"

"Yes, simple as that."

"But his phone is in his backpack. If it substituted as a flashlight, that point becomes suspicious. It's pitch black around, and his phone is set to power-saving mode. This mode typically relies on reducing brightness and volume to save energy. I believe that when brightness drops several levels, the phone can’t substitute for a flashlight."

The simple rebuttal was easily countered. Sendou sheepishly scratched his head.

"Then, did the perpetrator take the victim's flashlight?” Meatama asked, "Or could it be that only the perpetrator carried a flashlight? If both sneaked into the library together, the victim wouldn’t need to bring a flashlight."

"That's exactly it, sister. I suspect it’s likely the former."

"Why?"

"Both corners of the bottom part of the weapon have been wiped, right? If two places were wiped, it means the perpetrator held the book with both hands. After all, to bludgeon someone to death with a book, one would inevitably need both hands' strength. However, at that time, the perpetrator’s hands were not empty, making it impossible to hold a light source. It's more likely the victim carried a flashlight, and the perpetrator took it after the act."

Both Meatama and Sendou were equally at a loss, muttering only, "I see."

"But if that’s the case, something's odd."

"Huh?"

"Where’s the flashlight gone? Let's all think about it. Flashlight, flashlight!"

His behavior became increasingly bizarre. Yuzuno eyed suspiciously at the sushi Risome handed to her. Perhaps something dubious was hidden inside?

Sendou sighed in surrender, "Hey, Risome!" It was unsure how many times he'd attempted to reason with Risome.

"I’ve already understood the flashlight issue, but isn't there something more important? The death note! Hurry and share your thoughts on the death note!"

"Death note!"

Risome shouted fervently, as if to erase it completely.

"Death note? Important? Officer, are you dozing off? Wake up. Tell me, what can you figure out by focusing on the death note? It serves no purpose and is a total waste of time."

"You think it's a waste of time? Of course, it’s important! It's left by the victim..."

"Yes, it's left by the victim. But we can never truly understand what others are thinking. Even if we presume to understand, it's just speculation. And what's more, the person is already dead."

He nonchalantly poked the bloody head with his finger; the corpse showed no reaction.

"'Ku' and '〇' might indeed refer to librarians' surnames. Perhaps. However, it could also signify 'pain' as in 'ku.' One cannot rule out the possibility that this is his retrospect in the final moments, circling beloved characters from favored books. We can make infinite assumptions, but all without foundation. Therefore, thinking about the death note at best is an utter waste. The flashlight situation makes it clear!"

"What does the flashlight indicate?"

"It indicates a lot. I’ll start from the beginning, for instance..."

"Excuse me, Officer." 

Just as Risome was about to continue flaunting, an investigator hurried over to report: 

"Taku Koyama is here." 

"Alright, I'll go right away."

Feeling somewhat relieved, Sendou turned to Risome, "Let's set this aside for now; we need to first understand the situation from the library staff."

"Sure, maybe their alibis will reveal something." 

As Risome nonchalantly said this, the police chief's tranquility was again sent to the far end of the horizon. 

"Are you tagging along too?"

"Of course."

The detective flashed a businesslike smile: 

"Because I haven’t finished stating my 'opinion' yet." 

7. From Today Onwards, Searching for a 'Ku' Assailant 

The bookshelves in the children's section were shorter than those in the second-floor general book area, with hand-drawn posters and recital notices posted everywhere. Walking straight through these shelves, at the end was the reading room. 

Lining the wall at the front were reference books from Gakken Publishing and biographies of great figures published by Shogakukan. Centered was a wide oval table. Compared to the tables on the second floor, the height here was also lower. Distinct scratches and pencil marks were present everywhere. About two weeks ago, children must have gone through tremendous efforts here to complete their summer homework. 

However, now seated around the table were not elementary students, but five adults. They sat in a row facing this direction. 

Looking from Yuzuno and others' perspective, to the far right sat a round-faced man, who seemed to be concerned about the shrunk-shouldered woman sitting next to him, frequently darting quick glances towards her. This bespectacled woman kept her head down, covering her mouth with a handkerchief. Her disheveled straight hair hinted at her distress. Yuzuno thought, this should be the first person that Sendou mentioned to find the murder scene—known as Mr. Nasu and Ms. Uehashi. 

Beside Uehashi, at the center of the table, sat a well-built man, his age between fifty to fifty-five. He tied his combed-back long hair with a band, wearing black-rimmed glasses with sharp angles, a shallow dark nose bridge supporting them. The glasses hung on a metal chain that drooped all the way to his neck. His appearance resembled that of a hearty, knowledge-loving, adventurous scholar. His constantly shifting lips indicated his anxiety, and his skin was sweaty. 

Beside him sat a petite woman contrasting with him. Her face was wrinkled, indicating her advanced age. Her eyes, looking stern beyond big glasses, and her bob cut sprinkled with silver-gray, and her bony fingers interlaced on the table. She wore a camel cardigan, but perhaps a black cloak and witch hat might suit her better. 

Finally, at the end sat the last person. At the leftmost position was a middle-aged man wearing stylish glasses, who sat with an exceptionally straight back, motionless. Compared to the other four individuals, at least his gaze was not so panicked. With a long face, his eyes clueless of where to direct, and shoulder-length slightly grizzled hair. Both his appearance and aura brought to mind the past rocker who sang about world peace.

"Thank you for waiting, and I apologize for the delay."

Standing in front of the table, Sendou spoke first. "I'm Sendou of the Prefectural Police, this is my subordinate Hakata, please bear with me. Now, the local station staff have informed you of the incident. As part of the investigation, I also need to learn about the situation from you..."

"May I interrupt?" The woman with the bob cut interjected.

"I understand you're detectives... but who are those two over there?"

All five people turned their gazes toward the boy standing inappropriately munching on cucumber rolls beside the police inspector and Yuzuno positioned behind him. Yuzuno hurriedly hid behind his brother, but it was too late. However, this situation was inevitable. The local station's team stayed on the second floor, leaving only the prefectural police partners and the pair, naturally making them stand out more.

"Oh," Sendou touched his forehead and said, "He's a search consultant. He’s merely sitting here, so please don't mind."

"But he seems to be just a child."

"He's a high school student, yet not a suspicious individual."

"But he appears to be eating sushi."

"My apologies, let me correct that; he is a suspicious individual, but please don’t mind."

She wanted to say more but held back. Risome himself seemed unbothered, continuing to chew noisily. Incidentally, the sushi box which Yuzuno was forced to hold had returned to his hands. Could one not find it difficult to eat under such circumstances? From both culinary and various other existential perspectives.

Clearing his throat again, Sendou continued: "Now, first, I’d like the three of you apart from Mr. Masato Nasu and Ms. Hikari Uehashi... to introduce yourselves."

"I am Teramura Teruki." The well-built man in the middle spoke.

"I am Riho Nariki," followed the bob-cut woman with her name. She added, "I also serve as the library director."

"I am Kuwayama... Taku." Finally, the leftmost bespectacled man articulated his name one word at a time.

Kuwayama—matching the initial letters written by the deceased, aligning with the highlighted character's family name. It seemed he was the legendary manager Kuwayama. Sendou's eyes glinted slightly.

"Each of you, you all know Kyouji Jomine, who was killed, right? He reportedly frequented the library."

"I’ve known him since he was this small," Teramura stretched out a hand, gesturing about table height. "He'd come several times a week, choose books, study... he also once helped us with free research at this table. He often came with his mother, school friends, and his cousin."
"Yes. He's also very good at following the borrowing rules, a very smart kid," Riki added. Sendou repeated, as if pondering the meaning of the word, "Smart..."

"Mr. Teramura and the others know Jomine better than Mr. Nasu, right?"

"That's because unlike Nasu and Uehashi, we have been working here longer."

"However, perhaps Mr. Koyama has the closest relationship? It seemed like the two of them talked yesterday."

"Oh. Mr. Koyama is very familiar with Jomine, huh?" Sendou picked up on Riki's words and turned to Koyama. The latter replied calmly:

"Yes, we share interests in books. Sometimes, we recommend books we've read to each other."

"By the way, what did you talk about yesterday?"

"Nothing significant, just exchanged greetings."

"Greetings? I see. Was there anything unusual about Jomine?"

"No."

The response was too direct. Perhaps because he could question further anytime, Sendou didn't say anything more. He adjusted his posture and changed the topic:

"It's estimated that Jomine was killed around ten o'clock last night. Did you all leave for home around eight o'clock last night? Mr. Nasu and Ms. Riki checked the library when you left, right?"

"Yes," Riki said, "We inspected all areas, including the stacks and restrooms."

"Did you notice anything unusual?"

"Not at all."

"When you left the library, did you close the doors to the counter and the office?"

"Yes, we did."

"Did everyone leave together?"

"We all live along the Ebina Railway line, commuting by train, so we walked to Kazekozan Station together and then parted, each taking an up-bound or down-bound train."

The Ebina Railway refers to a private rail connecting Yokohama and Ebina, with around fifteen stations. Kazekozan is the fifth station from Yokohama.

"Did any of you return to the library after getting home?"

The detective scanned the entire table, but no one responded. He scratched his chin and returned to the main subject:

"Then, after getting home—especially around ten o'clock, what was everyone doing? Also, is there any way to prove it? Please tell me accurately. Let's start with Mr. Nasu."

The round-faced young man on the right end shivered, sat upright, and said:

"Okay. I live alone in an apartment in Yukinohara... I got home before nine yesterday and then stayed there. So, I don't have an alibi… Oh, but I logged onto my online game account around ten. That might serve as proof."

"I see," Sendou nodded with displeasure as if to say, "How can such a thing be considered proof?"

"Then, Miss Uehashi... Miss Uehashi, are you okay?"

Uehashi still seemed not to have recovered from the shock of discovering the body and did not respond clearly to Sendou's question. It wasn't until Nasu called "Miss Uehashi" that she finally looked up and quietly answered, "I'm fine," though her face was pale.

"You’re asking what I was doing last night? Yesterday... After returning to my apartment in Soujukawa, I had dinner and... didn't do much after that. I was likely taking a bath around ten. Since I live alone, I can't prove it... I'm sorry."

"You don't need to apologize," Sendou said gently, "What about Mr. Teramura?"

"I live with my wife and son, but only I was at home yesterday."

"Why was that?"

"My wife was at a class reunion. My son, who is in college, had a club gathering and came home late. So there was no one home when I returned. I don't have an alibi from nine to eleven."

After Teramura finished speaking, as if remembering something, he said:

"Wait, I watched the nine o'clock show on Monday. I can describe the episode from yesterday. It's that drama where Shun Oguri is searching for a job."

"You can find spoilers online everywhere, so it doesn't count as a rigorous alibi," Risome abruptly mentioned. Teramura widened his eyes, more surprised that Risome spoke than by what he said.

"Ah, oh. That might indeed be true... Mr. Detective, I withdraw that. I still don't have an alibi."

"By the way, it wasn't Shun Oguri looking for a job," Yuzuno said, "It was Satomi Ishihara."

"Thank you for correcting me."

"Wow."

No matter what, she wanted to point that out, yet Risome stuffed her mouth with inari sushi. He casually spoke but treated others like this—what was that all about?

"Thank you, Mr. Teramura!" Sendou regained the rhythm, "And you, Ms. Riki?"

"Actually, I was by myself around ten. On my way home, I got off at Rikuo-cho and watched a late-night movie."

"A movie? Which movie?"

"It's an animated film called 'Tokyo Godfathers' being re-released."

"'Tokyo Godfathers'?" Risome parroted, "I love it, too. Megumi Hagino's character was the best! But it’s quite an old film; why is it showing now? Oh, right, it's the third anniversary of the director's passing, isn't it? What a great theater they have. I've been waiting anxiously for 'The Dreaming Machine' to be completed."

As he rambled on, Yuzuno picked up the last piece of sushi from the box and stuffed it into Risome's mouth. Even though he glared angrily at her, Yuzuno remained unperturbed.

"Hearing you all talk reminded me Ms. Riki did mention going to a movie after work yesterday," Teramura muttered. Both Nasu and Koyama nodded.

"Did you see it alone?" Sendou asked.

"Yes, so it's hard to prove... The theater was really small, and I threw away my ticket stub. Of course, I can describe the plot."

As Risome pointed out earlier, in today's digital age where one click can gather information, this wouldn't count as any significant proof. Especially for a re-released film.

"When I got back to Shiranuma Bridge at around 11:30, my husband can vouch for that."

"Understood, no need to say more. Finally, Mr. Koyama."

Sendou turned once again to the man sitting at the left end:

"Where were you after leaving the library? What did you do?"

Although Sendou's expression remained calm, there was more authority in his words than before. Her brother flipped his notebook to a new page, ready to record the suspect's answer.

At that moment, Yuzuno suddenly thought, do Koyama himself and the other librarians know about the information left by the victim at the scene? Judging by their appearance, perhaps only Nasu and Uehashi were aware. It must have been Sendou's intentional tactic not to inform them, to catch the suspect off-guard.

"I took the train and bought groceries at the supermarket. I got home to my house in Yamato at around 9:30 p.m. After eating the prepared food I bought, I took a bath and drank a can of beer before sleeping. That’s it."

"Prepared food—Excuse me, but what about your family?"

"I have a wife and two young daughters, but no one was home yesterday."

"Much like Mr. Teramura's family, they went out too?"

"No, about four days ago, my wife went back to her parental home, taking the children with her."

He stated it smoothly, yet it caused the detectives and librarians to widen their eyes. Even a high schooler like Yuzuno could easily imagine what this implied.

"Koyama, you're separated from your wife? This is the first I've heard," Teramura said. Koyama calmly responded:

"We just had a fight. It happened once before, so it's no big deal."

"Koyama," her brother suddenly seemed to recall something, "when you mentioned rushing to Shizuoka for personal reasons this morning, that meant..."

"Going to my wife's parental home. I wanted to reconcile with her. I turned back halfway, so I haven't met her yet."

After organizing his thoughts, Sendou summarized the testimonies:

"That means... not a single person can prove you were home at ten?"

"Yes."

He nodded honestly. "Thank you." Sendou's eyes gleamed like he had caught his prey.

Koyama had no alibi. In fact, the other four people had no alibi either. Theoretically, every librarian could have committed the crime. But who—just as she thought about this, Yuzuno suddenly noticed:

Is the premise that the murderer is among these people definitely correct in the first place?

"As for the office door, has anyone shared the nighttime password with others?"

Sendou asked the librarians, seemingly sharing a similar train of thought. They each shook their heads, and Riki responded on behalf of everybody: "No."

"The nighttime password is only known to the librarians. Neither the movers nor the clerks know about it."

"So, the only people who can enter the library at night are those present here?"

The director was about to nod when Teramura's booming voice interrupted:

"Wait a minute! That guy might know, right?"

"You're talking about the guy who quit last month. The password lock was already in use by then."

"Oh... he does know the password then."

Riki remembered, and her stern face relaxed. Sendou immediately asked:

"Who is he?"

"Until three weeks ago, we had another librarian here, but, well, he had some issues..."

"Issues?"

"We discovered he was selling decommissioned books to second-hand bookstores, and the money went into his pocket. Although they were unwanted books, secretly selling them is a serious violation."

"Oh my."

"Thus, I dismissed him immediately. But before that, the password lock was already in use, so he knew the password."

"In other words, this former librarian could access the library after hours?"

"Yes... Now that I think about it, not changing the password was careless of me."

Perhaps feeling the responsibility of being the director, Riki pursed her lips awkwardly.

"What’s the name of the dismissed man?"

"His name is Kuwajima. Kuwajima Nobuo."

Kuwajima.

Yuzuno was startled and exchanged a glance with her brother. This surname also begins with "Ku," phonetically close to Koyama.

"What kind of person is he?"

"This might sound bad, but he always left a selfish impression. While he had extensive knowledge of books and wasn't sloppy with work, he lacked harmony and behaved rudely..."

"What about his appearance?"

"He was quite tall, probably 43 years old. Bald, with big, conspicuous eyes. He also had a burn scar on his left cheek."

"It's said to be from an accident in his childhood," Teramura added, "Though it's not a pronounced scar, he seemed very self-conscious about it. Thus, respecting his wishes, I seldom assigned him counter or open shelf duty."

"So, after his dismissal, has Mr. Kuwajima not appeared before you again?"

"No. He lives nearby, so he's come as a visitor a few times. That guy tends to be a bit thick-skinned about such things. However, he didn't borrow any books and didn't speak to us... Oh, right, I think I saw him yesterday too. With his hat pulled down low, he seemed in disguise. He sat on a bench on the second floor until closing time..."

"Ah!" Toshiko suddenly cried out:

"I remember, yesterday Mr. Kuwajima..."

"Miss Uehashi, what's wrong? What have you remembered?"

"I also saw Mr. Kuwajima at the library yesterday. He was talking to Kyosuke outside the automatic doors."

A wave of agitation rippled through the reading area.

"Around three o'clock in the afternoon. During my break, I was on my way to buy drinks from the vending machine outside. When I returned, Kyosuke and a man wearing a hat were standing next to the automatic doors as if they were conversing…"

"Are you saying the person talking to Kyosuke was Kuwajima Nobuo?"

"His hat was pulled down low; I couldn't see his eyebrows or head, but I could see the red scar on his cheek. I remember thinking, oh, Mr. Kuwajima's back again."

A former librarian dismissed from the library came back in disguise to his former workplace. And he spoke with the victim of the case.

"Miss Uehashi, did you hear what they were talking about?"

"No, I only saw them... Oh, but I think Kyosuke didn't look too friendly; his expression was stern as he spoke."

"So, they weren’t merely exchanging greetings," Sendou said, almost as if mocking Koyama's earlier statement. Koyama himself remained unmoved, still sitting calmly.

"As for this man, we'll confirm his whereabouts in the area shortly. Thank you for providing this valuable information." After Sendou finished speaking, he hesitated for a moment and then turned to ask Risome:

"Do you have anything to ask?"

The adviser didn't answer but handed the empty sushi box to Sendou, took a few steps forward, and looked over the five librarians before saying:

"Has anyone among you changed a lot in appearance compared to yesterday? For example, heavier makeup, different glasses, or a new hairstyle?"

The librarians exchanged puzzled looks, and soon Teramura answered:

"Everyone looks just like yesterday."

"I see. Thank you."

Risome only asked that one question. He gave a bow and was about to return to his spot. But just as he turned halfway, he suddenly stopped and asked:

"Oh, I have one more question. I'd like to ask Mr. Koyama: you just said you share book interests with Mr. Kyosuke Jomine. What kind of books do you two enjoy?"

Another cryptic question. Even Koyama frowned slightly:

"Detective fiction. Especially short stories from abroad."

"What is Mr. Kyosuke Jomine's favorite short story?"

Risome pressed on. Koyama thought for a moment, puzzled, and answered:

"I think he likes 'The Purloined Letter' by Edgar Allen Poe... Does this have anything to do with the case?"

"No, it’s just personal interest. Thank you!"

Risome turned around, leaving a smile to the astonished librarians.

"Mr. Detective, we have a request."

Just as the detective finished questioning and was about to leave the reading room, and Yuzuno and the others were planning to follow him, a polite voice called out to them. When they turned around, both Nasu and Uehashi had stood up.

"May we tidy up the books scattered around Kyosuke on the second floor?"

"If they're left soaking in blood, they'll get damaged..."

"Oh, since the field investigation is over... you can tidy them up under the supervision of the investigation personnel. But 'Remote Police' will be kept by us."

"Understood. Thank you!"

The two, seizing every moment, hurriedly thanked them, quickly passed Yuzuno and the others, and rushed toward the stairs. She recalled the detective mentioning how Uehashi came to the library early just for a book. Encountering a corpse, her face turned pale, but she never forgot to protect the books. Such an attitude made her feel the spirit of a librarian.

The detective watched as they departed, then resumed walking. When they reached the children's book area entrance, he finally breathed a sigh of relief. This space was more for toddlers than older children. Surrounded by shelves of picture books and comics were colorful chairs and small sofas. The detective plopped onto one of these, and the others, weary from standing, sat down with him.

Her brother quickly pulled out his notebook again and said, "Let's summarize."

"None of the librarians have a clear alibi. They all live nearby, so even if they went home initially, they had ample time to return to the library. Theoretically, everyone has the potential to commit the crime. Additionally, another suspect emerged—the man dismissed last month, Kuwajima Nobuo. He has a history of causing issues in the library and even spoke with the victim in front of the library yesterday."

"He seems highly suspicious," Sendou sniffled, "We need to investigate Kuwajima thoroughly. But the real issue is Koyama. The death message points to him, and he also has no alibi, which is almost confirmed. Next, we need to focus our surveillance until he slips up."
"Are you still talking like this?" Risome broke in. He was holding a picture book, casually flipping through it as if passing time. The cover, featuring a flying boy in a surrealist style, had the title "Rubber Head Ponta."

"Didn't I just tell you? There's no point in contemplating death messages."

"I don't remember you saying that. Also, take this sushi box and throw it away yourself!"

"Oh, I didn't finish speaking, did I? Let me continue!"

"Don't ignore what others are saying! Take your trash and dispose of it properly..."

"This death message has nothing to do with the killer's name, or it might be a disguise deliberately made after the fact. The flashlight fact proves this with ninety percent certainty."

Sendou tried to shove the empty box into his hand but suddenly stopped mid-air.

"A disguise? Are you saying the death message is fake?"

"I don't think it's entirely fake, but using a corpse's finger to write a message is time-consuming and risky. A normal killer wouldn't do such unnecessary things; they'd hurry to escape. However, there are two messages. If a killer sees one of them, to cover its meaning, disguising the other is highly possible."

"Why would that happen?"

Risome closed the picture book he was reading, turned to the two detectives, and said:

"Let me start from the beginning. Even though testimonies say the library was in complete darkness, there was no flashlight beside the victim. This implies two possibilities: the victim originally didn't have a flashlight, or it was taken away.

"In the case of it being taken away, there are two possibilities. One is that the killer, K, who killed the victim, took the flashlight. The other is that a third person, X, who left blood stains at the counter, took it away."

"It's okay if the third person is X, but why is the killer K?" asked brother, "Is it K from Kugo-san?"

"It's K for Killer."

In a library filled with classic literature, naming the killer K seemed a bit rude... Yuzuno thought of the Natsume Soseki novel she read in junior high school.

"So, detective, if the flashlight was taken, who do you think took it, K or X?"

"Definitely the killer took it. There's no evidence to suggest the third person isn't the killer."

"Correct. However, I believe X actually exists."

"What?"

"This can be deduced from the witness testimonies of seeing light. The workers at the construction site saw flashlight beams on the second floor of the library, three times in total. Nine-thirty, ten, and eleven o'clock. The murder occurred at ten. So who opened the flashlight on the second floor at eleven? Did the killer linger at the crime scene for nearly an hour, or flee and return an hour later? Compared to such scenarios, it's more natural for someone other than the killer to have come. Therefore, the person who used a flashlight at eleven is likely the third person X. Suppose the killer K assaulted X and Kyouya Arise and then ran. After a while, X, who had fainted, regained consciousness. The timing of this sequence makes sense.

"However, in this situation, X would need to go to the second floor alone. As I mentioned earlier, moving from the counter to the scene without a light source is difficult, no matter how familiar with the library. In other words, when moving from the first to the second floor, X should have their own flashlight. Thus, X nearly wouldn't need to steal the victim's flashlight. Of course, there are a few unreasonable possibilities, but this simple scenario of the killer taking the flashlight is far more likely than other hypotheses."

Since Risome started rambling, Sendou blinked slowly and glanced at the sushi box in his hand.

"Eating vinegared rice really speeds up your mind."

"That's hard to say. It doesn't seem very effective."

"Why are you looking at me?"

Yuzuno had indeed just eaten a piece of inari sushi.

"Let's continue. Since the possibility of X taking it is weak, the reasons for no flashlight at the scene focus on two points. The victim never had a flashlight, or the killer took it."

"I understand. But what does this have to do with death messages?"

"It's closely related, detective. Because you can't write in complete darkness."

Upon hearing this, both Sendou and brother were taken aback, faces tense.

Yuzuno noticed it too. The flashlight gained sudden importance along with the bloody text.

"Imagine. Kyouya Arise was knocked to the ground by the killer. At the point of death, he thought about leaving a message. He dipped his finger into blood to write letters and symbols, but the library was completely dark at night. Writing a simple 'く' might be doable, but accurately circling the face on the book cover in darkness is impossible. Consequently, the quite evident conclusion is: there must have been a light source by the victim's side.

"Here, we apply the two hypotheses deduced earlier, where the victim didn't have a flashlight, and where they did. As I explained upstairs, the former is unlikely, but let's carefully consider it. Assuming the victim did not have a flashlight, it logically means the killer had it. Therefore—"

Risome stood, extending his right hand as if holding something.

"After the killer struck the victim, they continued shining a flashlight by the victim's hand like this. How long does it take for someone with a head injury and fading consciousness to leave two types of messages using blood instead of ink? Ten seconds? Twenty seconds? No, longer. If so, detective, why didn't the killer notice the death message? They were clearly shining the flashlight with their own hands. Even in their panic after striking someone, it would be impossible not to notice, correct?"

Indeed, the killer must have noticed the death message. Realizing it pointed to their name, they would erase it or replace it with other words to disguise it.

With that thought, Risome's initial conclusion made sense. Why does paying attention to death messages seem pointless? Because the message is completely unrelated to the killer’s name or is fake, altered by the killer...

"Then," Sendou muttered in a near-whisper, "what about the other possibility? The flashlight belonged to the victim, dropped when attacked, accidentally illuminating their hand."

"Yes, that's it. But then the killer took the flashlight. Taking it implies getting closer, crouching down, then picking it up. The flashlight in total darkness is like a spotlight on a stage, constantly illuminating the death message by the victim's hand. Getting closer there, crouching, then picking it up... detective, think about it."

Risome repeatedly lectured the two detectives sitting on children's stools with the same lines as before.

"So, why would the killer not notice the death message?"

8: The Fourth Mystery

"Huh?"

Upon bicycling into the library courtyard, Arisa Jomine yelped in confusion.

The first day's exams had ended smoothly. She planned to prepare for the next day, arriving at the library as she did yesterday—but before her was a sea of people, unable to enter for some unknown reason. Her decade-long visits never saw such a spectacle. In her surprise, she nearly lost balance and fell.

Continuing forward on her bike, she noticed not only the crowded entrance, but the library building itself seemed sealed off. Some issue today?

"Excuse me, has something happened?" she asked a middle-aged man peering from the crowd's back.

"Looks like a murder."

"What?"

"Quite baffling, really. I had a book by Makoto Shiina and came to extend the loan. Now, I can't process it. Today is the return deadline. In this case, can it be extended past the due date? I haven't finished reading. Miss, what do you think?"

"Um, I don't really know... but renewing can be done online, so you should be alright?"

"Ah, is that so? I didn't realize."

Leaving the easygoing man, Arisa hurried away.

Even the bike parking area was congested with curious onlookers, so she parked her bike by the greenery's edge. There were fewer people here, allowing her to see the yellow tape across the building and police through it. Apparently, the man's words were true—a murder had occurred. In this place? Who could have been killed? Arisa nervously walked around the tape, touching the bandage on her thumb's base.

An ominous premonition brushed her mind.

* 
"In any case, thank you for your help. I will consider your 'opinions' in the investigation. We'll stop here for today; you can go back. No, hurry and get back!"

"I was planning to, anyway."

Risome responded as he slowly walked back and forth before the stairs. The empty sushi box stuffed back into his hand, as it seems he couldn't find a place to dispose of it.

"I don't want to stay at crime scenes all the time. Going back, can you send me in a patrol car?"

"Who's sending you off, fool! And don't call the prefecture police cars taxis!"

"Sorry. It was rude of me to refer to them as taxis."

"Glad you understand."

"I should call them 'hire cars.'"

"Not 'hire cars' either!"

Sendou grew increasingly frustrated, spittle flying.

"What's a 'hire'? A karate shout?"

Yuzuno asked in a low voice, suddenly interested, and Risome gave her an extremely disappointed look. Yuzuno threw her bag, shoved into her hand, at Risome to block that gaze.

"Alright, enough joking around," Risome said, clutching his nose, "Detective, your consultant advises you to search every corner of the library thoroughly. Inside the ceiling, locker rooms, and the crevices in the book repository's movable shelves—search every nook. Although the librarians say they checked before going home, there are plenty of hiding spots. For example, in an animated series I watched, a director hid a body above the elevator."

"There sure are all kinds of library directors out there."

For some reason, his brother muttered in resignation. Leaning against the checkout counter, Sendou said:

"You think I wouldn't know that. If someone stayed hidden after closing, the night security system is meaningless. I'm planning to turn the place upside down to see if there are any traces of people."

"That's the spirit. Also, please especially examine the second-floor restroom closely."

"We've spotted shards there, so..." He trailed off, then asked, "Why did you know about the shards?"

"I used a process of elimination. So I leave it to you; see you, then."

Waving to Sendou, Risome walked into the counter. "Hey, hurry up and go," his brother called after him. Yuzuno retorted indifferently, "I know!" This reminds her, she hadn't figured out the relationship between Kyouya Arise and the chair of the library committee—

Ding!

Just as they intended to leave the hall, a sound announced the elevator's arrival beside the stairs.

The doors opened, and out came Nasu and Uehashi, who had gone upstairs earlier, with an orange book cart. Behind them was Shirato. Noticing Sendou and others in the hall, Nasu respectfully bowed:

"Thank you."

"Was everything alright with the books?"

"There were just a few books with bloodstained pages, mostly requiring new covers. None were missing..."

Nasu glanced at the small cart. Aside from "Remote Police," all books scattered around the body were rearranged in alphabetical order from the kana chart.

MORI Masako's "After School Memories", MORI Yoko's "Perfume Stories", MORINUE Toshio's "November's Girl", MORIOKA Hiroyuki's "Gentle Purgatory", MORIKAWA Tomonori's "Cat Feed", MORISAWA Akio's "Tsugaru Centennial Restaurant", MORITA Seisei's "Crossing the Mountains", SEI Kesshintou's "The Mercer Alliance", SEIDA Ryuji's "Bay Chronicle"...

"Wait a moment!"

Risome stepped forward, nearing the small cart.

"Are all the collected books here?"

"Yes. Oh, we didn't touch 'Remote Police.'"

"All the scattered books besides it are here, right?"

"Yes."

"Confirmed no lost items?"

The two administrators glanced at each other and answered:

"Indeed, none are lost. We compared the second-floor catalogue on the computer with checked-out books and found no missing volumes."

"Even relying on the computer shouldn't be an issue, right? Even we can't manage all the in-library holdings."

Uehashi added with a wry smile after speaking. But Risome neither smiled wryly nor showed any trace of a favorable expression, instead staring at the books on the cart.

He slowly, slowly tilted his head to the left and, as if arriving at a conclusion, swiftly restored his gaze—then rushed towards the stairs the very next moment.

"Ah! Hey!"

Sendou yelled, and Yuzuno reflexively gave chase. Up the stairs, through the shelves, Risome's destination was the murder scene they had visited earlier.

"Oh no! Advisor lad!"

Umeatama was lazily standing guard there. Of course, the body was still present. Unexpectedly, she saw it twice. The inari sushi she ate earlier felt ready to return to her mouth.

But not sparing a glance at the body, Risome stood where he could overlook all authors starting with "Mo" as he fixed his sights on the numerous book spines.

"What happened?" Umeatama asked Yuzuno. Yuzuno shrugged and replied, "I don't know."

"Sister," Risome continued staring at the bookshelves, "Were there any odd actions when Mr. Nasu and others collected books and checked holdings?"

"Odd actions? Of course not."

"Seriously? It's crucial."

Risome left the scene, returning to the stairs. Yuzuno didn't understand what exactly was deemed "crucial," but she followed his running to and fro; it was somewhat odd.

Sendou in the hall was visibly angry, appearing ready to catch him at any moment. "I've told you not to run around every time, haven't I? Why do you insist on doing so..."

"Detective! Sorry, I have one more request!"

"Huh?"

"Please investigate Kyouya Arise and his surroundings thoroughly. His room, computer, and... well, that's enough. I'll contact you later for details."

Risome waved his head as if to shake off impatience. He seemed unable to organize his thoughts.

"My goodness, this case contains several mysteries far more difficult than the death message. What were the victim and the killer doing at night in the library? Why was Kyouya Arise killed? Does the third person X exist, and if so, who would they be—besides that book!"

"Book?"

"Detective, we might be entangled in an original crime."

Risome finished in haste, leaving the flabbergasted brother and administrators behind as he headed to the office. The Five Sushi box in his right hand had been crushed.

"Well then... we're departing."

Yuzuno bid farewell, hastily bowing for him, then caught up with Risome just as he was exiting via the side door. He seemed distracted, mumbling nonsensically.

"How strange, what's going on? Could I have misremembered? No, I'm sure I saw it... Evidence! There's evidence! Maybe yesterday... What was the name again?"

"Hey, Risome."

"Yuzuno."

Startled by the sudden use of just her first name, Yuzuno was shocked.
"Ah?" 

"I think I thought of you at that time."

Risome turned around for a moment and then continued walking briskly forward, still muttering to himself.

"Why? Younai. Yuzuno... no, no. Is it Yuzu? Youzi, Youzi..."

"Hey, hey, Risome!"

"No, it's not a singer. Is it the fruit Yuzu? Fruit, fruit... quite close, reminds me of something. A fruit's name. What is it?"

"Risome!"

"It's the title of a work! From the 90s... name... fruit... ah, I remember!"

"Risome! Ahead! Ahead!"

"It's Mechanical Goddess!"

Risome snapped his fingers and shouted. At the same time, he bumped headlong into a bicycle parked in front of him.

Clang! A splendid sound echoed around. Risome let out a sound that resembled an unclear "wah" and fell headlong to the ground, not moving. Yuzuno thought to herself that was why she was calling him and ran over to him.

"Are you okay?"

"...Why is there a bicycle parked here?"

"I should be asking you... why didn't you notice the bicycle here?"

Anyway, it seemed he was alright. Yuzuno glanced at the bicycle to see if it was damaged. The bike seemed unharmed, probably because the person who hit it was pretty weak. Since it had a kickstand, it didn't even fall over. It was a silver women's bicycle, common to see everywhere, with a familiar sticker on the rear wheel.

"Huh? It's a student from our school."

The sticker printed with "Kazeko High" was used to prove this bicycle belonged to a student commuting to and from Kazekozan High School. To differentiate from other schools, each student received a sticker upon entering. Some students found it troublesome and didn't stick it on, but it seemed the owner of this bicycle was quite rule-abiding.

Risome got up and seemed interested in the bicycle, too, frowning and saying, "Eh?"

However, his eyes weren't on the sticker but on the seat.

A light gray seat. Nothing particularly odd about it, yet at the top, something the color of brown sand was stuck. Risome approached the bicycle, dipped his index finger in it, and rubbed it between his fingers as if confirming the texture.

"Red clay."

Then he went close to the seat, sniffing it earnestly and seriously with his nose... somehow, it felt like a strange scene.

"Ri... Risome, what's wrong? Have you awakened to something new?"

"Take a sniff too!"

"What? What?"

It didn't seem like he was joking. Yuzuno reluctantly placed her nose close to the seat, detecting the synthetic leather smell mixed with the earthy scent, and amidst it was a faint—

"Apple fragrance?"

"Excuse me, that's my bicycle."

No sooner had Yuzuno murmured those words when a voice came from behind. Arisa Jomine stood there.

"I, um—"

In the frozen air, Yuzuno searched for words to explain.

Arisa Jomine covered her own skirt in self-defense, stepping back half a step, her face filled with confusion rather than anger. Which was understandable. Even she would have the same reaction if she found a boy of the same grade she wasn't familiar with, along with a junior, sniffing and smelling the bicycle seat she sat on every day; certainly treating them like perverts.

If explained well, if the misunderstanding were cleared up.

"No, we're not that kind of—"

"President of the library committee, we met this morning, I remember you are Arisa Jomine."

Risome pushed the babbling Yuzuno aside and said calmly.

"Uh, yes... you're Risome?"

"Yes, and this is Hakata-san."

"To be accurate, I'm Yuzuno."

Didn't this guy already remember what my name was?

"What are you two doing here?"

"Not much, really. I came to study at the library, but who knew something happened here, and it seems like it's closed today. Such a pity... ah, hang on. Jomine?"

Risome lied as naturally as breathing. Then his voice rose, seeming to just realize she shared a surname with the victim.

"Could you be related to Kyoujo Jomine?"

"Kyoujo is my cousin."

Yuzuno took a deep breath. So they are related, after all. Now that you mention it, one of the librarians did mention someone often coming with their cousin.

However, this complicated things further. No one had informed her yet that Kyoujo had been killed. In such a situation, should she be told? Yuzuno was hesitating, but then heard Arisa ask:

“What happened to Kyoujo?”

Risome did not answer, his eyes fixed intently on Arisa, not her face but her body and feet. The more confused the girl became, the more she retreated. Yuzuno thought if she called the police, she’d leave Risome alone and run.

“President, I think I saw you at the library yesterday, right? In the novel area on the second floor.” Risome suddenly changed the subject.

“Yes, that’s right. You remember it well.”

“It was around four o’clock, wasn’t it? I left around four-thirty, were you at the library the whole time?”

“I stayed until five when it closed.”

“Did you go straight home after it closed?”

“Um…”

When Arisa, who answered fluently, heard this, she paused for a moment. Across the lenses, a fearful gleam could be seen in her eyes.

The questioner remained composed, quietly waiting for an answer.

“No.”

“Is that so? Thank you. It seems the library is closed all day today, probably best to head home.”

Risome turned and headed outside the library courtyard. Yuzuno hesitated for quite a while, finally bowed to Arisa just like before, and chased after Risome. She felt the gaze from the library committee president stabbing painfully into her back.

Halfway through, she saw a box of Sushi Six lying near the greenery and picked it up. It seemed to have fallen when Risome stumbled. In the end, she threw it in the trash herself. Ah, a sense of helplessness surged in her heart.

“What was that conversation earlier all about?”

“For goodness' sake, today is full of weird things.”

Yuzuno caught up to him and asked. Yet, Risome was still talking to himself, not intending to answer seriously.

“From my view, you're the weirdest today... Anyway, I think you should stop sniffing girls' bicycle seats! As a person!”

“Don’t talk. I'm thinking.”

“Thinking about what?”

“Thinking about Arisa Jomine.”

The answer was still odd.

Upon reaching the sidewalk, Risome stopped in front of a vending machine at the roadside. Inside were two kinds of Marume drinks.

“I see. You ate sushi, and now you're thirsty.”

“Maybe.”

Risome replied offhandedly, looking at the vending machine products. Yuzuno thought he would take out loose change, but instead, he inexplicably squatted down and observed the ground.

“Are you looking for loose change someone else dropped?”

“I’m not so poor!”

The concrete pavement was stained with red sand. It might have been dust carried over from the construction site next to the library. Shifting her gaze, she also noticed that only the ground near the vending machine was a deeper color, as if something had spilled there. Risome rubbed these places and brought his fingers close to his nose. Seemingly understanding something, he nodded and followed the stain to the vending machine’s side.

“Found it.”

He picked up something.

It was an opened, 350-milliliter drink can. In his other hand was the aluminum pull tab of the same product.

“Oh, it’s Marume’s apple soda... you don’t see this often.”

“Seems like it.”

Risome gently shook the can. The sloshing sound of the drink and the bubbly sound of carbonation could be heard.

“It’s not finished. The carbonation is still there.”

“Seems like it. Are you planning to drink it?”

“Do I look like someone who drinks things people drop?”

“From your weird behavior so far, you look very much like such a person.”

Risome put the can back and started examining the pull tab. Yuzuno also leaned in to look. There was nothing peculiar about the cap, but there was red stuff on the edges.

"Isn’t this blood?"

Yuzuno looked at Risome; he was gazing at the roadway, seemingly summing up his thoughts. After a couple of cars drove by, he thought of something, muttered "Mechanical Goddess," and took out his phone.

Yuzuno didn’t mean to peek, but since she was so close, she saw the screen. Risome was typing two words into the search engine: Raimu Kazekozan Library.

Then, after a slight hesitation, he replaced "Raimu" with the kanji "来梦" and searched. It brought up nearly 30,000 dining establishments and apartment names around Kazekozan. Risome opened the search filter, changed the range to within twenty-four hours, and searched again.

This time there were far fewer search results. He clicked on the topmost result with his slender fingers. It was an SNS personal page. The profile picture was of a young woman with brown hair, along with a tweet associated with the search.

The post was made yesterday at four in the afternoon. The attached photo showed a two-year-old girl standing in front of a library shelf not suited for her. The text was decorated with various emojis, saying:

“Raimu’s library debut! Wandering in Kazekozan Library~”

Yuzuno heard an exhalation.

Beside her, Risome broke into a relieved smile. It didn’t appear to be because the girl’s picture comforted his spirit. He enlarged the photograph and pointed at one of the books in it.

It was unclear what book it was. Over-magnification had made the pixels too large to differentiate the book title and author. However, there was a red label on the spine.

* 

What is going on?

Even after Risome and the others left, Arisa remained standing by the bicycle, bewildered.

She had circled around the library once, and coming back to the green area where bikes were parked, found two Kazeko High students leaning over the bike seat doing god-knows-what. They were library regulars – Risome Tama and that first-year girl she’d seen in the morning by the shoe lockers. During the holidays, she’d noticed this girl wearing a table tennis team training uniform a few times coming to the library. But it was the first time she’d heard the name Hakata Yuzuno. No, it’s Yuzuno Hakata.

Even if their behavior towards the bike seat was a misunderstanding, what happened afterward couldn’t let her be at peace. Risome’s random inquiries. When she stayed at the library until, did she go home right after it closed? Had she returned to the library? Her heart pounded painfully with tension.

This simply, simply—

The phone in her pocket vibrated.

A call came, from Mom. When there is something, she usually emails, which was rare.

“Hello.”

“Ah, hey, Arisa? Where are you right now? What are you doing?”

Mom’s voice was not like usual, having a sort of despairing urgency.

“I’m in front of the library. What’s wrong?”

“The library... Arisa, listen calmly to what I’m going to tell you.”

Mom paused, seeming also to let herself calm down, taking a deep breath:

“Kyojo has been killed.”

...

About Creation, Interwoven Investigation 

A refreshing breeze gently caressed the central plaza radiating from the tourist pedestrian pathway. The grass whispered, and Umei held down her hair. Being summer vacation and still morning, there weren’t many students nearby, making the vast wooded campus seem deserted. Opposite the plaza's shrubbery stood the central library of the university. Viewing this glass curtain wall, modern-style designed building, one could not help but sense an urging pressure as if it was prompting them to study. She also began to understand why Kyoujo Jomine preferred spending time at the neighboring town’s library rather than here.

“That’s how it is, Akashi-kun.”

Hakata diverted her gaze back to the male student sitting on the bench.

"The day before yesterday, upon Kyoujo's invitation, you went to Kazekozan Library after lunch. You were writing a project report at the reading room table, while Kyoujo left for about an hour, claiming to 'select books to borrow'. He returned just before four o’clock. You both left the library together, you rode him back home, then directly went to your part-time job at a family restaurant, working until eight, and returned to your single room in the student dormitory around nine in the evening."

Kohei Akashi nodded, not changing the direction of his face but just stretching his head forward a little. This young man didn’t look too flamboyantly dressed but somehow made one feel his words might not be entirely reliable. He checked his Casio wristwatch every few seconds; reportedly, he had an acapella practice session in the afternoon.

“Do you and Jomine often go to Kazekozan Library together?”

“Yes, when free, I occasionally go. Since the student dorm is close to Kazekozan.”

“Was there anything unusual about Jomine the day before yesterday?”

“Nothing I noticed.”

“What kind of person do you perceive Jomine to be?”

“A regular good guy, I guess. I’ve been good with him since entering university, though I don’t know him very well… But I think he’s serious, not gloomy in character, and we get along well. Oh, but he’s generally quiet, so he doesn’t have many friends, probably no girlfriend.”

“Serious? Has he caused trouble in the past?”

“I already said I don’t know him well. If you want to know about Jomine, please go to those who know him better, like his cousin Arisa.”

“Arisa. Oh, Arisa Jomine, right?”

She’d seen the name in yesterday's report on the victim’s family situation. Apparently, she was a frequent visitor of the Kazekozan Library; it might be necessary to find her for more information in the evening.

“Then, Akashi-kun, we will…”

“We want to know your impression of Jomine.”

Interrupting was Umei who took over his sentence. Hakata had no choice but to comply: “Yes, that’s right.” Akashi scratched his short hair dyed chestnut brown, saying:

“Right, last year he had a run-in with the university office.”

“A run-in?”

“But it was just a trivial matter. I participate in an acapella research society newly established the year before last; we practiced but couldn’t find a performance space. So I often suggested, why not do a flash mob? And although Jomine wasn’t part of our club, once we discussed it, he showed interest and helped us plan and make promotional boards. As a result, we did perform, right here in this plaza.”

“A flash mob choir?”

“That’s right. The atmosphere was lively, but since we didn’t apply for permission, the university got angry and dragged Jomine into it as well… Anyway, I just want to say, this guy was also down-to-earth, and sometimes particularly proactive.”

Akashi nostalgically smiled and then lowered his eyes in solitude.

“How did something happen that he was killed?”

“I understand your feelings,” Umei put a hand on his shoulder, saying, “We will definitely catch the culprit!”

“Alright... I’ll leave it to you! I think Jomine wasn’t a bad guy.”

“Thank you for taking the time. Good luck with the acapella! Alright, Officer Hakata, let’s go.”

“Yes, okay.”

Umei stepped out first; Hakata followed closely... oh? I’m from the prefectural police, and she’s from the local precinct, isn’t she? How did this get reversed? Well, whatever.

“Did you note down the testimony just now?”

“Yes. Basically.”

He showed her the notepad page full of dense writing.
Meito glanced over, half admiring and half speechless, and said, "But we came here specifically to investigate at the chief's request, yet it was all in vain."

"Yeah, we didn't get any important information."

"Nor are there any students that feel right."

"Students that feel right?"

"No, no, that's my personal matter. More importantly, Officer Hakata, tell me more about the advisor."

Meito's voice suddenly gained momentum. Why were both Shirato and she so interested in Risome?

"Risome is not a good person. If anything, he's the worst. He wandered around the crime scene, acted arrogantly, said things that made no sense, lived at school, kept a messy room, had twisted hobbies, and treated my sister rudely. I don't know what the two of them did during the summer vacation. Really! Just thinking about it makes me..."

"Amazing."

"Are you wearing rose-colored glasses?!"

When Hakata exclaimed, a group of female students nearby seemed to misunderstand and started giggling. Like the chief, he hurriedly coughed and steered the conversation back to work: "Anyhow... Anyway, let's hurry back to Kazekozan. It's time to question the victim's mother."

Yesterday, the investigators had invited Kyoujo Jomine's mother, Miyoko Jomine, to the police station. However, upon learning of her son's death, she was extremely distraught, so they couldn't obtain detailed information. As a result, they requested to wait until she had calmed down overnight before proceeding to the victim's house for further investigation. Hakata and the others planned to gather information from Kyoujo's mother and then search his room, also following Risome's email to look for "a certain item."

But why was it necessary to find this item? Neither Hakata nor the chief understood at all.

"Oh, you’re here."

Sendou was already waiting in the residential parking lot, with Shirato and five or six other backup investigators behind him.

"How is Kohei Akashi's situation?"

"We only found evidence that he was with the victim, no other findings..."

"Any progress at the investigation headquarters?"

Meito asked Shirato.

"We found Nobuo Kuwajima's residence."

"Oh, really?"

The investigation into the dismissed former librarian Nobuo Kuwajima was, of course, ongoing as well. His resume, kept at the library, recorded the name of his apartment in Kazekozan, but when investigators went there, they discovered that for some reason, Kuwajima had moved out at the end of last month. Since then, they had been looking into where he relocated.

"It wasn't hard to find. It's an apartment in the neighboring town," Sendou said, "Room 103 at Misumaru Heights, Hatamoto-cho."

"Since it's nearby, we’ve already sent officers there. The nameplate indeed says 'Kuwajima.'"

"Have you seen him in person?"

At Hakata's inquiry, Shirato slowly shook his head and said, "Unfortunately, he’s not home. There’s an evening newspaper stuffed in the mailbox, suggesting he hasn't been home since yesterday afternoon. If he doesn’t return by this afternoon, I’ll have to borrow a key from the manager to enter."

"I see..."

Nobuo Kuwajima. This man had spoken with the victim on the day of the crime. He had burn scars on his face. Yet to appear, he's like a phantom whose true form is unclear. Compared to the death information pointing to Koyama, Kuwajima had become an even more troubling presence.

"Anyway, let's set aside the culprit for now and understand the victim first."

Sendou refocused the investigators and started moving, "It's about time to go."

Turning off the main road where the parking lot was, they walked down a side path. Kyoujo Jomine's home was tucked away in a crowded corner. The houses here were so close together, it seemed like you could cross rooftops from one to the next.

It was a single-family home, seemingly squeezed onto whatever land was available. Given that the victims were a mother-and-son single-parent family, there was likely enough space for two. The house faced south with curtains drawn on every window. The yard had a casually placed flower stand. Crossing the path in front of the entryway, there was an extended and worn step leading down to the street below, giving Hakata a sense of being in a maze.

Sendou rang the doorbell, and a woman around forty-five opened the door.

"Are you Kyoujo's mother, Miyoko Jomine?"

"Yes."

"I'm from the police. We contacted you before..."

"I know, come in."

Before Sendou could finish, she ushered the detectives in. It wasn’t so much that she was understanding, but more that she was exhausted and unwilling to exchange any unnecessary words. The investigators all bowed their heads in greeting and entered the Jomine home. Shirato and Meito went upstairs to search Kyoujo's room, while only Sendou and Hakata were led into a combined living and dining area.

"I'll make some tea."

"Oh, there's no need."

"No, I'll make some."

She went into the kitchen adjoining the living-dining space and set some water to boil. The two detectives sat on chairs at the dining table, looking around the room as they waited for her.

The room was sparsely furnished with a simple—one might say impoverished—setup. Lace doilies were draped over the sofa back, and there were a few photo frames on the sideboard. Few were family shots. Kyoujo had lost his father in an accident ten years ago.

"Please have some tea."

Setting down some black tea, Miyoko faced the two and sat opposite them. 

Hakata thought, she doesn’t really resemble the victim. She was a woman whose hair hung lifelessly over her shoulders, worn out. Although her skin still retained some elasticity making her appear young, her cheeks were gaunt, arms thin, and figure frail. Facing her son's death, her expression was terribly bleak. Perhaps due to the thick glasses, her eyes clad with dark circles seemed particularly large.

To avoid exhausting her further, Sendou spoke calmly: "I'm Sendou from the prefectural police; this is my subordinate, Hakata. We’re in charge of this case... We're very sorry about your son. However, this is a murder case. Even though you're in pain, we hope you'll answer a few questions."

"Alright."

"Thank you for your cooperation. First, regarding the day before yesterday. I hear you work at a tailor's shop near the station. Did you work the day before yesterday?"

"No, the day before yesterday was the shop's regular holiday, so I was at home all day."

"Your son went to the library after lunch?"

"Yes, around one o’clock. He said he was going to the library to write a report. He came back a little past four, seemingly brought home by a friend on a bike."

"How was he after returning home? Did you speak with him?"

"We exchanged trivial words. Like 'the report isn't going well.' Kyoujo then sat on the sofa reading books he borrowed from the library."

"Borrowed books?"

"They’re still on the coffee table there."

They turned to look at the sofa; six books were piled on the coffee table. Three were novels borrowed for pleasure, and the others were reference books for writing reports: "Admission," "The Long and Short of Dreams," "Inside the Jar," "Introduction to Educational Counseling," "Special Activities and Human Development," "On Moral Education."

"Sorry," said Sendou, leaving his seat to call an investigator from the second floor. Once downstairs, the investigator took photos of the books with a polarized camera and collected them.

"You also frequently visit the library?"

"On my days off... I’ve been there with Kyoujo before."

It seemed they had entered touchy ground, for Miyoko's voice lowered. The chief sat back on his chair again.

"Let’s continue. Your son was sitting on the sofa, reading?"

"Yes. That's how he usually behaves when he borrows books. He stayed on the sofa until I started preparing dinner. After that, he went out twice..."

"Twice?"

"The first was around seven o'clock. He suddenly said he wanted to buy a magazine in front of the station and went out with a bag. About fifteen minutes later, he returned, saying he couldn't find any. I didn't think much of it."

Magazines. This reminded him of the victim's fingers, stained from handling a manga magazine.

"So, he went out at seven and returned fifteen minutes later. What about the second time?"

"The second time was two hours later, after having dinner and taking a bath. Kyoujo, who had been watching TV on the sofa, suddenly exclaimed: 'I'll go look elsewhere.' I didn’t have time to stop him before he went out with his bag again."

Miyoko added that it was the last time she saw Kyoujo, then lowered her head. Her lifeless hair drooped, nearly touching the teacup.

"Do you know the exact time he left the second time?"

"Around... 9:20."

"Your son said he was going to look elsewhere for the magazines he wanted?"

"Yes."

Sendou signaled with his eyes, and Hakata circled this testimony in his notes. It took about five to six minutes to get to the library from here. Leaving home at 9:20 would place him at the library by 9:30—when the first person witnessed a light.

Did Kyoujo lie to his mother and go to the library? Yet, what did he do in the 30 minutes between arriving and ten o’clock? And what about the earlier outing at seven?

"He went out after bathing, indeed odd in hindsight. But back then, I thought he would return soon and didn't pay it much mind. However, an hour passed, then two, and he didn't return, even ignoring my emails. I wondered if he’d gone to his father's brother’s nearby, so I emailed his cousin Arisa."

Miyoko showed Hakata and others the communication records on her phone. There were two messages sent to Kyoujo, around 10:30 and after 11. Both were simple messages asking where he was. Between them was a message sent to Arisa, saying: "Is Kyoujo at your house?"

"When he hadn’t returned past midnight, I felt worried yet thought he might have run into friends, resulting in being late, so I went to sleep... So foolish. Had I been more vigilant..."

"No, you were already paying close attention to your son."

Sendou attempted to console, but the mother only seemed to sink into more dejection. Miyoko removed her glasses and wiped the lenses with a cloth repeatedly, appearing to use the action to distract from her sorrow. Making tea was likely for the same reason.

"About that, a handwritten note left on the scene by Kyoujo... can you think of any significance behind it?"

Sendou showed the photo of the note found beside the body to Miyoko after it had been removed. She squinted closely, then put her glasses back on, steadying them with her fingers, peering at the photo.

"It appears to refer to a character named Koyama Ryoto in a book."

Her assessment aligned with theirs.

"Did Kyoujo have a particular fondness for 'Remote Detective'?"

"Hard to say... He’d been reading mystery novels often, but seemed to lose interest recently. 'Remote Detective' was a popular book both Kyoujo and I read. Apparently, Kyoujo discussed it with librarian Mr. Koyama... Oh, Mr. Koyama..."

It seemed the idea of Koyama being the killer also crossed her mind. Hurriedly, Sendou added, "We can’t rely entirely on that message." Switching to another photo, he posed a new question:

"These items were in Kyoujo's school bag. Anything you noticed missing?"

"The handkerchief is gone."

"Handkerchief?"

"Yes. Kyoujo often placed a handkerchief in the side pocket of his bag, a black striped one."

Such an item wasn't spotted in the library. Could the killer have taken it?

"Regarding the belongings, one more question. Did your son take any lighting device when he left at 9:20? Such as a flashlight or penlight?"

"A lighting device? Our family has a small flashlight, though I'm not aware if Kyoujo took it..."

"Could you verify this now?"

Miyoko and Hakata went together to look in the hallway. She opened the closet by the entrance and glanced inside, surprised. "No... it's gone. There used to be a thin silver flashlight here."

Hakata noted this in his notebook and circled it. Risome's deduction was correct. Kyoujo Jomine entered the library with a flashlight, which was later taken from the scene.

Sendou pondered briefly then said to Miyoko: "One more thing. Do you have any clue as to why your son went to the library at night and why he was murdered?"

"No."

Miyoko's tone grew slightly firmer.

"After his father died, Kyoujo supported me all along. Even though he was so young, taking such a blow, he never showed it and grew up gentle and honest. Despite hardships, he never complained, excelled with scholarships and part-time jobs both in high school and university... Far from having anything criminal—he didn't even have a rebellious phase. He was a very good child. Yet to think someone resented him enough to kill is just..."

Footsteps came from the stairs. Shirato descended and signaled with a look that the room search was complete.

Following that, Hakata's group quickly searched the living-dining area and other rooms upon approval. Since trash hadn't been taken out since the day of the incident, they also inspected the trash bins. Throughout the intrusion into their living space, Miyoko remained statically seated at the dining table, staring blankly at her untouched tea.

Once everything concluded, she saw the investigators to the entrance. Sending them off, Sendou finally said, "We’ll take our leave. Thank you for providing valuable information."

"No need... Oh, detective."

"What is it?"

"The vigil, I want to arrange it for the day after tomorrow..."

"Understood. We'll do our utmost to solve the case by then."

Sendou nodded to her assuredly.

But after Miyoko closed the door, his eyes returned to the police-like coldness. Hakata heard him murmur, "A good child. All mothers say the same."

* 

"Hello."

"Risome? Is it convenient to talk now?"

"Oh, it's you, brother! Sure, just finished the second day's exams."

"Was it smooth?"

"So far so good."

"It's great you’re so carefree."

"Not entirely carefree. So, what’s your report? Have you searched Kyoujo Jomine’s room?"

"Just finished. Regrettably, the victim had none of the interests your deduction mentioned."

"Really? Not a trace?"

"Yeah, nothing. However, while checking his computer emails, we found an odd exchange."

"Oh! What kind? ...Okay... Hmm. That explains things. How about phone emails?"

"Actually, there's some intriguing content. The other party..."

"Ah, as suspected. I've mostly figured it out. Can you send me the email exchanges? I need to confirm. I'll handle the rest."

"Handle?"

"Please come to my room this evening to discuss it in detail. I have to go, I have a date."

"A date? With whom? It wouldn’t be Yuzuno, right?"

"It's a cute girl you also know, brother."

"Then it must be Yuzuno?"

"Ah, she's here, she's here. Hey, I’ve been waiting for you. Let's catch up later."

"Hey! Risome? Risome? Risome—! This guy really is no good!"

2. Study Session Observation

Yuzuno Hakata leaned against her friend Sanae's shoulder, walking through the first-floor corridor. The second day of final exams had mostly ended in disaster.

Having poor results in chemistry from the first period, she ultimately stumbled. Modern society essays were aplenty, leaving her short on time, and her relatively good subject, math A, was also a failure. While going over the answers, she realized she had used a wrong formula instead of the repeating sequence required for one problem. It's over, doomed, can't go on. She wanted nothing more than to toss everything aside, go home, and dive into her bed for a good sleep.
And that dream was shattered too. There are still exams tomorrow and the day after.

"I'm going to kindergarten tomorrow, starting over with primary education..."

"Primary education starts in elementary school!" Sanae corrected. Even a joke can be mistaken; it's hopeless.

"Though you're saying that, you always manage to get decent scores."

"No, not this time. Ah, I think tomorrow is doomed too."

"Avoiding that is why we're headed to the library... but I kind of want to see the library where the incident happened."

The incident at the Kazekozan Library was reported on TV and in the newspapers this morning. Although the coverage was brief, urging people to wait for further news, since it happened nearby, it was a topic of discussion in the classroom before exams.

"What's the point of going there? It might be closed today."

"Oh, I see. Well then, let's go to Risome's activity room."

"In that unreliable room, I'd never be able to concentrate..."

As they were about to leave the second school building, Yuzuno stopped in her tracks.

In front of an empty classroom along the north corridor where no one was in sight, the unreliable room's occupant was standing there. In the shadows leaning against the wall, seemingly talking to someone.

"Will it definitely happen?"

"Not absolutely. I'm just saying, if I were him, I'd do it. It's a matter of probability."

"So, there's a possibility of guessing wrong with probability?"

"We'll see when the time comes. We have nothing to lose, anyway."

The person was a girl with straight black hair. She had her back to them, so it was unclear who she was. They seemed to be discussing something secretive. Yuzuno and Sanae exchanged glances, hiding in the corner of the corridor, eavesdropping on their conversation.

"But why do I have to agree to your request?"

"You don't want to?"

"It's not that I don't want to, but I don't think I owe you anything now, right?"

"By the way, the group photo you sent me last time was fantastic. What if I enlarge it at the print shop and hang it in a frame in the entrance notice board?"

"Okay, I'll do it. No, please let me do it."

"Then, I'm counting on you."

"Fine... I still dislike you."

"Same here. Oh, and."

"What is it now?"

"That suits you better."

"I'm not happy about that!"

Leaving those words shyly, the girl turned and walked toward them. Familiar yet unfamiliar. Yuzuno racked her brains, trying to remember her exhausted mind tormented by exams—

It was Rieko Harimiya.

This girl was a second-year who had always given a bad impression. Yuzuno hadn't recognized her at first because her appearance had changed dramatically. She had heard her image changed at the end of the summer holiday, and today was the first time seeing it. She indeed transformed into a beauty. Her blonde long hair was sharply cut into a bob and had returned to black. Her curled ends and lightly made-up long eyebrows gave her a cool look like a model from a foreign magazine.

Being mesmerized caused her to lag a step while hiding. As the girl was about to turn the corner in the corridor, she spotted Yuzuno and Sanae, her face turning red as she ran towards the first school building... her personality didn't seem that cool after all.

Beside her, Sanae groaned, "Mmm." Yuzuno redirected her attention to the corridor and found Risome's gaze already close.

"When did you start standing here?"

"Hmm... just now." Her response filled with a sci-fi tone. Risome seemed uninterested in pursuing further and looked away. Sanae immediately asked, "What were you talking about with Harimiya?"

"Just discussing how to deal with exams."

Yuzuno and Sanae exchanged glances again. What they heard didn't sound like typical high schooler conversation.

"Stop!" A cheerful voice suddenly came. It turned out Kaori was running towards them from the third school building. Risome, whose face turned pale, attempted to escape in the opposite direction but was yanked back by Yuzuno, who had vaguely sensed something, just in time. It was easy to take down this useless person, an athletic idiot.

"Arrest!" Kaori, catching up, grabbed his other wrist. Yuzuno and Sanae clapped happily; however, it was their first time seeing someone really shouting "stop" while chasing another.

"Ha ha, caught you at last, Twenty-Face! Time to pay your dues!"

"Oh, it's you, Akechi!... Ah, no, weren't you Twenty-Face yesterday? What happened to your worldview?"

"It's magic!"

"Don't think you can explain everything with magic!"

Ignoring Risome's complaints, Kaori thanked Yuzuno:

"Thank you, Kobayashi, it's all thanks to you!"

"I'm not Kobayashi. Did Risome do something bad?"

"He declined my invitation and ran away, so I was chasing him all over the place. Come on, everyone is waiting."

"Unluckily, I'm exhausted from exams and need to go nap at the activity room."

"You slept for half of the exam time! We need Tenma's brain!"

"Brain?" Sanae reacted to the word, "Is there an incident?"

"Not an incident... oh, if convenient, you both can come too."

Holding onto the still unwilling captive's arm, Kaori stretched out her right hand, pointing towards the third school building where Yuzuno and Sanae were heading, "Join us for a study meeting in the library."

"Oh, I'm so moved that so many second-year scholars are here for me! Looks like I'll pass this exam!"

"Here for you? I was dragged here by this red glasses without even asking!"

"Sitting to the left, my situation is the same as yours."

"As a man, don't complain so much! Hurry up! Tenma, take out the materials. Kogura, you too. Learn from Nao!"

"It's possible...but Kaori, your grades are good too, you alone can teach Kajiwara."

"Isn't it lively with more people?"

"It's not good to be lively in the library!"

"We're not having a hotpot."

"Hmm, but with more people, we can complement each other's weaknesses, maybe we'll be more efficient."

"As expected from the table tennis team captain Nao, you immediately understood!"

"But I still think noise is not good."

"Oh, sorry... let's be quieter. Start. Wow!" Kaori clapped her hands.

"Kaori, you don't have to clap!" "Well, Kajiwara, what do you want us to teach you?"

"First, what's being tested tomorrow?"

"Starting from that?!"

"Kogura, be quiet!"

"Kaori, why do you tell me!?"

Kuramachi shouted twice. Fortunately, the other students' seats were similarly noisy, so it didn't attract glares.

The library was on the fourth floor of the third school building, the school's most spacious rectangular classroom. A counter was right at the door; inside from the counter was an area for newly purchased books and recommended books, a reading room with study tables, and bookshelves with a wide variety of books. Perhaps due to extra issues from the newspaper club, the reading room was unusually crowded, with students wrestling with textbooks and reference books at every seat. Occasionally, groaning could be heard.

Yuzuno and her group took a window-side table. Five second-year students sat around the table: Kaori and Risome, vice president of the newspaper club Kento Kuramachi, the drama club president with remarkable curls Kazuya Kajiwara, and Captain Nao Sugawa.

The gathering seemed to be organized by Kajiwara under the guise of advanced students helping lagging ones, considering the nature of the conversation and his position at the head of the table. Yuzuno recalled that during the disappearing incident at the end of August, Kajiwara and Kaori had discussed this matter. Though it was a bit awkward to study with seniors, she felt obliged to meet old friends, especially since Captain Sugawa was there.

"Hakata, if you don't understand something, feel free to ask!" said the captain, sitting to Yuzuno's left.

"I think the first-year scope is easy to teach."

"Okay, thank you."

The captain's smile remained, though her eyes shifted to her meticulously color-coded world history notebook. In both club activities and the library, she was a reliable presence. Easy to teach first-year material—could Yuzuno say the same to her juniors next year? Unlikely.

"What should we start with?" Sanae nudged her from the right, snapping Yuzuno back to reality. She pulled out her math workbook, saying, "Let's start with this." Tomorrow's exams were in modern literature, English reading, and Math I. Today's Math A didn't go well; she couldn't let it happen again.

Suddenly, she felt someone watching her. Turning toward the opposite seat, she saw Risome casting a murky gaze her way. Falling asleep? No, he was actually focusing on something behind her. She turned to check.

Directly in front of her was Arisa Jomine.

Sitting alone at the rarely frequented counter due to the exams, she was engrossed in a novel. After saying goodbye to Yuzuno and the others yesterday, she might have learned about her cousin's death. Her expression was more troubled, clearly downcast.

The morning news possibly avoided revealing Kyouko Jomine's name, considering the victim was a student. Hence, no other students focused on her feelings... maybe Yuzuno should say something to her?

"Tomorrow's world history exam, such a hassle... Risome, got any memory tricks for countries?" Kajiwara asked, breaking her thoughts.

"Messy fringe for Italy, slicked back for Germany."

"Why personify them?"

In her hesitation, Risome and Kajiwara resumed their leisurely conversation. Better to concentrate on studying.

She opened her workbook, reviewing quadratic functions. Luckily, there were untouched problems piled up like a mountain, plenty to do. Tears almost welled up. Wanting to cry, no, she wasn't being irresponsible, just invested too much in club activities.

Making excuses, she tackled the mountain. The June unit had completely melted in the summer heat, needing step-by-step confirmation with Sanae. But this mischievous friend was just as sloppy, not allowing any carelessness even after verifying. After completing just two or three problems, the time spent was shockingly long. Would she manage tomorrow like this?

Seeing Yuzuno and Sanae's determination, Kaori muttered, "You're tackling math?"

"We're also studying Math II on the last day. Teacher Okaniki is such a pain."

"Teacher Okaniki... oh, the notoriously strict one?"

"Strict, more like a pervert." replied Kajiwara from his seat. Teacher Okaniki seemed unpopular.

"Are the exam questions that difficult?"

"Yes. That's one reason, but also during exams, he's too rigid. Last time, a classmate ended up in a make-up test because their mechanical pencil lead broke."

"Oh, that happened. And Okaniki's exams are taken in large classrooms with four classes together. Having to leave in front of so many people, how pitiful."

"That's... indeed harsh."

"Maybe he wants students to experience the atmosphere of actual big exams." Captain Sugawa joined the conversation, lifting her head from her notebook. Yuzuno nodded in agreement but internally prayed that Okaniki wouldn't be teaching her class the following year... Such differences set her apart from the captain.

Kaori leaned forward to ask:

"Yuzuno, who's your math teacher? Yabe teacher? I haven't taken their class. How about English?"

"English reading is taught by Sato teacher. Writing by Hamaguchi teacher."

"Hamaguchi? Oh, I had Hamaguchi with Tenma in the first year."

"So did I with Hamaguchi," said Kajiwara, "He's the opposite of Okaniki, careless enough to make you uneasy. The test seems to be the same every year."

"Huh?!" Sanae exclaimed in excitement.

"The same every year? Really?"

"Reportedly," the captain responded.

"Sa... Sugawa, last year's English..."

"Writing was also by Hamaguchi."

"Give me, quickly give me last year's final exam papers!"

Sanae reached over Yuzuno, pestering the captain, but the earnest captain didn't relent. Her mischievous friend drooped her ponytail, turning to Risome.

"Ri... Risome, at least share how to excel in English with me."

"Memorize the material!"

"It's impossible! Our worlds are different!"

Sanae grew more dejected. Yuzuno patted her back in comfort, then returned to her workbook. Seemed like she had finished problem six and should tackle problem seven next. This one required finding the maximum and minimum of a quadratic function—

She paused, staring at the page. 

It seemed like a straightforward common form, yet so simple that she couldn't find the approach. How to solve it?

She glanced around the table. Kajiwara was posing philosophical questions to Kuramachi about "who were the Germans." Kaori and Sanae were animatedly discussing Hamaguchi. Risome—not even opening his textbook—was fiddling with his phone. Thus, only Captain Sugawa seemed available.

"Sugawa, can you look at this problem?"

"Hmm?" The captain took Yuzuno's workbook.

"Oh, this, perhaps distinguishing based on the domain and the axis' position is needed..."

She lightly pressed the mechanical pencil's cap against her lips, starting to solve problem seven. Apparently, it was a habit of hers when thinking. Yuzuno was entranced, momentarily forgetting what she asked.

She appeared very elegant, her intently lowered eyelids showing dedicated focus. It was truly a marvel. Her usually dynamic, natural short hair, sharply outlined in the afternoon sunlight, added an intellectual calm beauty. A fleeting thought popped in Yuzuno's mind: if only problem seven were immensely difficult.

"Sugawa, your pen..."

This utmost joy was interrupted by Risome's comment.

"Is thin and nice. Also looks portable."

The captain hesitated a moment, pencil leaving her lips: 

"Oh, this? It's indeed handy... why mention this?"

"Can I borrow it during the exam? I'll return it next week."

"What?" Both the captain and Yuzuno raised their voices. This man, casually bringing this up. Borrow? Borrow the captain's pen? The one that just touched her lips?

"Alright, I don't mind lending it."

"Sorry and thank you... your service is appreciated..."

"No." Yuzuno quickly blocked Risome's hand reaching for the captain's pencil. Risome looked at her discontentedly:

"What gives you the right to decide?"

"What... just no. If you need a fine pen, here."

Searching through her pencil case, Yuzuno pulled out a small ballpoint pen. It was a complimentary gift with a notebook purchase.

"Take mine, don't bother returning it."

She handed the pen to Risome. Risome test-wrote on the notebook's edge, compromising with "a ballpoint," and pocketing it in his shirt's breast pocket... wait, why put it there instead of the pencil case? Moreover, Risome stood up immediately saying he needed a break and headed to the bookshelves. His intentions remained a mystery.

"Strange..."

"I'll teach you; you'll understand," the captain misunderstood her muttering, moving her chair closer to Yuzuno.

**3 Literature Girl and the Detective Who Wants to Know Everything** 

Retracing the words, flipping pages. Continuing to retrace the words, flipping more pages. Arisa mechanically repeated this action.

A world of irony and humor unfolded within the novel's pages. Playing the poor man's rich and jobless youth, their roles swapped at a grand hotel. But her thoughts were far away, the content not entering her mind. Yet, despite this, Arisa hurriedly flipped pages as if someone were chasing her, reading forward. She confirmed with her right thumb the thickness of the overlapped pages, trying to convince herself it's the usual, it's okay.

Kyouko, her cousin, was killed in the library.
The time of the murder was around 10 p.m. on Monday. The killer struck him on the head with a book. The perpetrator has not yet been arrested. It's said information was left at the scene in the shape of a "く"... Her parents were in a panic and couldn’t directly communicate with the police, so the information they got was fragmented. She really didn't want to go to school, but her parents said, "You're a high school student, you have to take exams," they forced her out.

She didn't remember how she answered the questions. It seemed she did well, yet also poorly.

She turned another page, trying to immerse herself in the story. Books made her feel warm, comfortable like being wrapped in a blanket. Overlapping pages covered everything. Whether it was disgust, sadness, or unease.

"I'd like to borrow this book, please."

A paperback was placed on the counter.

She looked up and saw it was Tama Risome.

"Oh, okay."

Arisa hurriedly inserted a bookmark in her own book and took Risome's paperback. She pulled out a borrowing card from the back cover. The books at Kazekozan High School weren't managed with barcodes, so the procedure was still done the old way: you just had to write your name and date on the card. In essence, it could be done without a library committee member, but nominally someone needed to check.

Laughter came from the window-side table. The head of the drama club with naturally curly hair and the newspaper club president were talking and pointing. While writing his name on the borrowing card, Risome said:

"Sorry, they’re being noisy."

"It's fine... It's always like this during exams."

Arisa took the card, wrote down the date, and placed it in the management box. Risome borrowed a light novel from Dengeki Bunko that sounded like a work by Nietzsche. The illustration depicted a boy and girl sitting back-to-back, with the boy drinking a canned juice.

"Risome, don't you need to study?"

Risome glanced at the paperback Arisa had on the counter and said:

"I was about to ask you the same thing."

Indeed, she was in no position to comment on others.

"Reading during exams, you’re quite the model library committee member."

“No, I’m not.”

“Then why read?”

“Books offer an escape.”

On the cover with a yellow-green border, before a snowman with a bucket on its head, a young man and an old man raised glasses of red wine, smiling at each other, looking quite happy.

Risome was silent for a moment, then slowly walked behind the counter and sat in the chair beside Arisa:

"I see."

It sounded both like indifferent agreement and as if he knew everything.

Arisa looked at his profile and thought, what a strange person. She always thought so, but since yesterday, that feeling grew stronger. His odd actions in front of the bike, his enigmatic gaze, and yesterday's interrogation-like questioning. Right, when there was a murder in the school gym in June, she also heard strange rumors about him helping the police—

"It's rare nowadays among high school girls to find fans of Kästner."

Risome said softly, his gaze falling again on Arisa's paperback.

"I just happened to pick this up, not really a fan. But I did read children's books like 'Emil' often... Actually, I probably prefer James Krüss."

“‘The Boy Who Sold Laughter’?”

The latter half was just self-talk, but she was surprised when he said the book’s name.

"You know?"

“That book really got me obsessed with who makes margarine for a while.”

"I've never met anyone my age who's read that book. Do you like Krüss, Risome?"

"No, I'm an Ende supporter."

"Oh... but I like Ende too. Like 'Momo' and 'The Magic Cocktail'."

“Hell, villains, dark thoughts, and liqueurs. Such nostalgic things; I still remember them."

"Yes, yes, what an amazing story."

“No, actually, I’ve mostly forgotten the plot. But wasn’t there a nitpicker in the book who’s obsessed with books? It was such a perfect satire."

After saying something a bit off-topic, Risome started flipping through the borrowed paperback. They seemed to be on different wavelengths. And he didn’t seem inclined to leave.

"Risome, you borrow light novels here often, right? Mainstream or not."

“Since this place has more books for teenagers, and they keep a thorough collection of original anime works.”

"You like anime?"

"I like escaping, just like you."

Risome placed the paperback on the counter, glanced at Arisa’s hand, and said:

“Calluses.”

“What?”

“I mean, you have calluses on your right-hand fingers. So you haven’t neglected your studies after all, being fourth in the grade.”

“Oh, no. It’s not from studying.”

“Practicing illustrations?”

“Not that either…”

Arisa instinctively denied it, then suddenly closed her mouth, but it was too late.

Risome knowingly touched his chin and nodded, "Oh, I see."

"You not only enjoy reading but writing, too. Seems like you belong in the literary club."

Arisa tightly gripped her skirt.

She had been found out.

Till now, neither friends, classmates, nor seniors or juniors, even teachers at school noticed, yet she had been discovered by this neighboring class boy she’d hardly ever spoken with.

Her ears were burning, and she searched for an excuse in a skewed voice:

“Well, I just don’t like showing it to others. So, um, I just casually write.”

"You can't get calluses from casual writing," easily revealing the truth, "What kind of writing is it?"

"Fantasy... fantasy style."

“I’d love to read it.”

Arisa's mouth opened and closed like a goldfish. Was he serious, or just teasing? Risome's voice lacked inflection, making it hard to discern sincerity.

“Do you handwrite in notebooks or something? Not using a computer?”

“It’s not that I can’t use a computer, just not good at it... Without handwriting, I couldn’t continue. Um, I mean, uh…”

“You’re becoming more of a rarity.”

Risome murmured in amazement. Arisa’s skirt was almost torn. Couldn’t continue? What was she babbling in confusion?

"Don't you write, Risome?"

Arisa's mind was like a boiling pot, and she asked an even stranger question.

She expected Risome to dismiss it with a laugh, but unexpectedly, when he heard the question, he seemed caught off guard as he moved his gaze away. He muttered "Um" and continued:

“I actually have something half-written.”

“Hmm?”

She loosened her grip on her skirt hem.

“No, what I'm writing is really nothing significant. It's my first time, and I haven't decided on an ending.”

Risome once again picked up the light novel, flipping through it aimlessly. He, like Arisa, was flushed red, eyes wandering nervously.

Was that why he approached me? He wanted to discuss writing, to connect with a peer who shared his hobby? Were yesterday's odd actions and just now’s awkward conversation attempts to find a suitable moment?

If so—

“I'm pretty surprised.”

"Don't look at me like that, it was just a whim, and I haven't even decided on an ending."

"You've said that twice."

Arisa laughed. It had been a while since she felt like laughing. Risome was fiddling with the paperback, mirroring his reaction. Although Arisa wished he’d handle library books with care.

“Quick, tell me what you wrote?”

“Ah, why?”

“Because I’m interested. Also, maybe I can offer some advice.”

Risome continued to toy with the paperback but soon shyly turned to her with a slight smile. He glanced around the counter, ensuring no one else was eavesdropping, and began his tale with clumsy gestures.

"It's a story of a girl, a girl and a novel."

"Wow, sounds nice."

“Is it… somewhere there’s a girl, an introverted girl, a girl who’s not too noticeable, not good at talking or organizing, but actually rational and wise. She loves reading, often novels.”

“Uh-huh.”

“But the girl has a secret hobby, writing. She not only loves to read but also to write. Though she’s never shown her novels to anyone, there’s one exception: her cousin living nearby. They’ve always been close; he also loves reading. To her, he’s as reliable as a big brother.”

"…"

“One day, her cousin, after reading her new work, praises her, saying, ‘I wish more people could read this story.’ She secretly harbors the same desire, but stepping out is difficult. She lacks the courage to submit the manuscript for public contests or to bring it to sell at doujin events. Even the idea of showing it to school friends feels embarrassing. Uploading it online seems daunting as she’s not computer savvy, with the novel handwritten in a notebook. Just as she thinks of giving up, her cousin has an idea, a peculiar one, allowing many unspecified people to read it within a limited range.”

“Wait, Risome.”

Arisa interrupted. But Risome barely paused, continuing swiftly.

“The cousin first transforms her novel into a book. Not handwritten, but properly printed, with a hardcover just like other books. These days, companies offering such printing services are easy to find. Send in your notes or manuscript, and they convert it to data and bind it. Initially used to preserve diaries or school collections, novels can, of course, be made into books too. If it’s just one copy, a bit of money and a few emails suffice. Thus, a unique book written by her is born. What does her cousin do with it, then?”

"Wait!"

“The cousin places it in a library he often visits. Wrapped in a cover, affixed with a barcode to disguise it as a library book, placing it among books by domestic authors starting with 'Mo’. Though the barcode is fake, it would be discovered if someone tried to check it out. He preemptively stuck a ‘For Reference’ label on it, removing that concern. Library-goers wouldn’t know, nor the librarians. It was such a conspicuous hiding spot that nobody questioned its presence. Even if people noticed its unfamiliarity, most would think, ‘Oh, there’s such a book too.’ Even the most diligent librarian can't remember over ten thousand books. Thus, their plan worked.”

“Stop it!”

“At first, it was just a playful thing. Gradually, more people in the library read her book. Some doubted the book they’d never seen or heard of, but no one guessed the truth. Initially nervous, the girl felt delighted witnessing her book being read at the library. She and her cousin enjoyed the secret. But—”

“Please stop!”

Arisa didn’t shout, but she tightly gripped Risome’s uniform sleeve. She was panting as if she'd just run fast.

Risome finally went silent. Even after Arisa released his sleeve, he continued to stare at her. The blush and shy smile on his face faded away.

Amid Arisa's chaotic mind surfaced James Krüss, the boy who sold laughter, who lost his smile after trading with a demon, only a cold expression remaining. She felt inexplicably watched by this boy.

No, rather, he was the demon.

Once her heart calmed down, Risome spoke again with his still level tone:

"What do you think?”

“How did you know?”

The voice Arisa managed to squeeze out was hoarse.

Risome leaned back in his chair, resuming in a flat tone without hesitation.

“Yesterday, after visiting the crime scene where Kyoujo Jomine was killed with the police, I noticed something odd. The scene was before the domestic author ‘Mo’ bookshelf, books scattered from ‘Moriyama Misako’ to ‘Moriya Ryuji’. Yet, in alphabetical order, one book was missing. However, the librarian responsible for organizing these books said nothing was missing. They cross-referenced with the library’s book list via computer, affirming that besides the ones checked out, no book was missing. Yet, that book shouldn’t have been checked out. It should have had a ‘For Reference’ tag on it.”

“That book, is…”

“Mori Asami Zero’s ‘Planet of the Key Kingdom’.”

Upon hearing the title, Arisa visibly flinched.

My book.

“Risome, have you read it?”

“No. I noted it appearing around August but never touched it. So, it’s possible I got it wrong. Or perhaps it never existed to begin with. So I confirmed something.”

Risome took out his phone, showing her the screen. It was a personal page from SNS. It seemed like a Twitter post with a child’s photo, along with the location and her name “Raimu.” Arisa immediately recalled the “hot mom” with the child she’d seen at the library the day before.

“Posting a child’s name, photos, and location, I genuinely find such behavior reckless. But in such times, it’s convenient. A quick search revealed it.”

Risome zoomed in on the photo, pointing at a book on the shelf behind her. On the gray spine was a small red dot.

“Too pixelated to confirm the title, but that red dot is unmistakably a ‘For Reference’ label. No other book on that shelf has a no-lending mark. This conclusively shows ‘Planet of the Key Kingdom’ was still in the library at 4 p.m. on the 10th of September.”

Placing his phone on the counter, Risome continued: 

“Although I hadn’t got it wrong, the library's inventory didn’t list ‘Planet of the Key Kingdom’. No information about it could be found online. Therefore, I concluded the book wasn’t part of the library’s collection nor a formally published work. Someone privately made it and slipped it into the library's collection. Moreover, after the murder, the book mysteriously disappeared from the crime scene—linking it to the homicide.”

Arisa unknowingly gripped her skirt again, an unease of a different nature filling her heart.

“Anyone sneaking into the library at night, at least one person’s identity is clear. That’s Kyoujo Jomine, the victim. If ‘Planet of the Key Kingdom’ was a novel written by Jomine himself? It’s a wild assumption, but considering his frequent library visits, it warrants investigation. So, I asked the police to search for any novel-writing traces from Jomine. This clue cannot be easily discarded. If he truly wrote it, his room should contain some evidence of writing, like a notebook, notes, a Word document, or a USB stick.”

Taking a brief pause, Risome carried on: “However, the police found nothing. But in the computer’s email, they discovered some peculiar email exchanges. Here it is.” He showed another screenshot from a phone to Arisa.
The recipients are "Joint Publishing" and "Yasuda Printing."

"A printing company that produces hardcover books and a company that can turn images into labels. The label company is likely used to mimic barcodes and do-not-loan icons. Clearly, Kyouke was creating library collections. However, this wasn't a novel Kyouke wrote himself. So who did write it?

"There are three speculated conditions. First, it's someone close to Kyouke. He wouldn't create books for someone he isn't closely connected with. Second, it's someone with less capability and financial means than Kyouke. If they had money, they would have hired a professional company to make the book. It seems that this person may be an unfamiliar member of society, a younger student in junior or senior high school than Kyouke. And finally, this person frequents the library like Kyouke. As seen from the fact that the book was hidden in the library, this is accurate. The person who fits all these conditions..."

Risome paused, his dark eyes turning toward Arisa, who didn’t dare to meet his gaze. She kept her lips shut, staring at her wrinkled pleated skirt.

For the third time, he operated his phone: 

"As collateral evidence, I used a foolishly risky method and had the police investigate Kyouke's cell phone emails. He's been emailing you repeatedly recently. 'Another person read it today,' 'Two people today!' 'Another person today'... As conversations between cousins, the content is rather unusual."

Arisa didn't need to check the screen, as these emails were safely stored in her own phone's inbox as well.

"The key piece of evidence is the author's name. Moriasa Shinrei. Written in Roman letters, it forms a wordplay into another name."

Finally, he took out a pen and paper from the counter and wrote two names, placing them on Arisa's paperback. 

MORIASA SHINREI
SHIROMINE ARISA

Arisa gazed at these two names, recalling the eagerness she felt when making the puzzle. Moriasa Shinrei. Using her real name would cause trouble, so she strained her mind in her wind-chime-tinkling room to come up with this pen name, together with Kyouke.

That was at the beginning of July. Arisa handed three school notebooks to Kyouke when he visited her home. She had spent half a year and finally completed her third work. Written in pencil, the notebook was filled with vertical lines and marked everywhere with eraser corrections. It looked childish, but it was only for Kyouke to see, so it didn’t matter. She had always done it this way until now. 

Three days later, Kyouke excitedly shared his thoughts with Arisa. She was delighted to receive praise. However, when Kyouke proposed secretly publishing it somewhere, starting with the library, she was taken aback. She hesitated, but Kyouke said they’d put it there just for the summer vacation, and she nodded, making a decision. She was secretly excited at heart.

Under Kyouke's arrangement, "The Star of the Country of Keys" became a book. It was different from notebooks filled with eraser marks and from poorly printed typewriter manuscripts on cheap paper. It was a high-quality book that wouldn't lose its appeal anywhere. She wanted to keep it by her side, but that would defeat the purpose. So, they quietly took it to the library and placed it on the shelf. At first, Arisa was very afraid. A few days later, when she visited the library and saw someone reading her book for the first time, she felt embarrassed. Over time, this fear and embarrassment gradually turned into excitement. 

Of course, she couldn’t ask the readers directly about their thoughts, but she could see their satisfied expressions as they closed the book, which made Kyouke happy too. Soon school started, and they were supposed to take back "The Star of the Country of Keys." However, Kyouke jokingly said, “The university’s summer vacation goes until the end of September,” extending the period. Arisa didn’t object. As Risome said, she very much enjoyed the process.

A secret novelist game that existed only in the summer. A little mischief using a familiar library as a stage.

However, why?

"Why did things turn out this way?"

"I wish I knew."

Hearing her murmur in a voice so low it was nearly inaudible, Risome repeated her words.

"Risome-kun, are you investigating this case?"

"It’s part of my job. The prefectural police hired me."

"Have you always suspected me?"

"I never suspected you, but there’s something I want to ask you."

"Something to ask...?"

"I told you, right? The story isn’t over. Could you give me some advice on how to end it?"

Risome spoke in a self-mocking tone. As if the intermission had ended, he repositioned his chair. Arisa's throat tightened again.

The "story outline" he spoke of wasn’t over yet.

"After the girl placed her book in the library, a while passed, and one night, something happened. She left her house, rode her bicycle to the library. No, to be precise, she went to the vending machine in front of the library. Perhaps, preparing hard for exams, she simply wanted to buy a drink to adjust her mood. She bought apple soda and took a sip on the spot. However, at that moment, something happened."

His narration for the second chapter was very short, but Arisa was greatly shocked. Ignoring this, he continued in a light tone:

"What do you think happened?"

The hand supporting her body touched the paperback. The book fell from the counter with a thud. Nothing could protect Arisa from the sting of reality.

She knew that "The Star of the Country of Keys" had been exposed. She hadn't intended to hide it anyway, and an investigation would naturally uncover many pieces of evidence. However, what happened that night was different. She hadn’t told anyone, whether the police or her parents. He couldn't possibly know.

Could he be bluffing? No, yesterday he had asked a question. Until what time did she stay at the library? Did she leave right after closing? After going home, did she return to the library?

He wasn't bluffing.

"Why?"

She repeated the question in a trembling voice.

"Your bicycle seat."

"When I saw your bicycle, I found red soil on the seat. It's one thing to find it on the tires and pedals, but soil on the seat is strange. When I touched the seat, it was slightly sticky, and when I sniffed it..."

"You smelled it?"

"I caught a faint apple scent."

Risome continued calmly while Arisa, beside him, started rubbing her thighs. For some reason, they had suddenly become itchy.

"There’s the same colored soil on your sneakers too. Nowadays, it’s rare to find roads with bare soil. In this town, only the road in front of the library fits that description. Because the wind blew construction site soil onto it, I concluded that someone spilled juice or something similar there, and the bicycle fell over. Your shoes and seat became sticky with juice, making it easy for soil to stick.

"However, this kind of sudden incident is common. What concerns me is the timing. When did you knock over the bicycle on that road? On Tuesday morning, Yuzuno noticed the red soil stuck to your sneakers at the entrance. This means the bicycle was knocked over before Tuesday morning. Yet, apple soda smell still lingered on the seat, and it was sticky, indicating that not much time had passed."

A chill ran down her spine. She stammered in rebuttal:

"But... but just from this, you can't determine whether it was that night or not."

"You can't make a definite conclusion. Hence, first I confirmed with you whether you returned to the library after going home."

"Ah..."

"You said you didn't, but your reaction was odd. I investigated the road in front of the library. And I found signs of spilled apple soda near the vending machine, with the can still left by the roadside. Incidentally, the edge of the pull tab had traces of blood. At this point, I was convinced you were the person who spilled the soda."

As Risome spoke, he gestured toward the band-aid wrapped around Arisa’s thumb. Beneath it was a hidden wound from the pull tab's edge. Arisa covered the band-aid with her left hand, as if avoiding his accusation.

"Even if you know I spilled the soda, it doesn't prove I went to the vending machine at night. Maybe I bought the drink on my way home from the library that evening."

"No. If you had spilled the drink on Monday evening, it would not have stayed until the next day’s morning. As a regular visitor to the library, you should remember the notice board at the entrance."

"Notice board..."

She suddenly recalled it. Although she hadn't paid particular attention, she did have an impression of it.

Volunteers will clean every Monday at 5:30 PM~

"Residents clean the area every Monday from 5:30 PM. During cleaning, roadside trash would typically be removed. If it were cigarette butts, they might be overlooked, but a conspicuous item like a drink can wouldn’t. However, the can was left on the road. This implies that the spill occurred after the volunteers had cleaned the area."

There was no room for refutation.

"Let me summarize. After leaving the library once it closed, you returned home. Several hours later, you rode your bicycle to the vending machine. You bought apple soda and were about to drink it when encountered an issue, causing not only your can to spill but also your bicycle to fall. You panicked and, forgetting to wipe off the soil on your seat, returned home directly. Furthermore, you intended to hide this event from me.

"Why hide it? There are two possible reasons. One, you did something at those places you don't want others to know about. Or two, you witnessed something incredibly unbelievable that no one would believe even if you told them. Regardless of which, considering a homicide occurred the same night in a nearby area, it’s highly likely you're connected to it."

After drawing his conclusion, Risome leaned back in his chair and let out a short sigh.

More cheerful voices emanated from some group in the reading room. Arisa remembered herself at the familiar library desk. Being questioned by a fellow student about a murder case right under classmates’ noses—it was absurd and laughable.

"Risome-kun, you’re a detective, aren't you."

"I'm not that great; I don't even know Disneyland."

He whispered an inexplicable answer. Arisa forgot about the serious atmosphere and couldn't help but ask, "What?"

Risome shifted the topic, saying:

"What do you think? Do you believe the girl is the culprit or a witness?"

"She's not the culprit."

"What evidence do you have?"

"The incident was around ten, right? I wanted to watch a drama, so I was studying in the living room from nine till after ten. My mom and brother were also there, so there's no way I could have slipped out unnoticed."

She answered truthfully. Risome was quick to accept: "Got it."

"You believe me?"

"I told you, I never suspected you in the first place. I don’t think you could have known the library’s night code. If she's not the culprit, then she must be a witness?"

"Yes..."

"What did you see?"

Risome’s gaze became slightly sharper.

Arisa suddenly realized that this was his true focus. His claim of being an aspiring writer was a blatant lie. Be it "The Star of the Country of Keys" or the events of Monday night—he had been fully aware from the start. The conversation just now was his way of cross-checking. His engagement with her was to discover what followed.

Realizing this made Arisa even more tense. With her dry lips, she haltingly recounted her experience from the night before.

Close to eleven, she rode her bicycle to the library, intending also to take a break. Around eleven when she reached the vending machine, she saw a flashlight flickering on the second floor of the library for some reason. After purchasing her favorite apple soda, she took a sip and relaxed. And then—

"A man ran out of the library grounds, bumping into my bicycle parked on the roadside. I was startled, causing the can to drop, and the bicycle to crash onto the road. He seemed to stagger slightly. His cap was pulled low, hiding his face. However, the impact of colliding with the bicycle caused his hat to fall onto the sidewalk. Under the vending machine light, I saw his eyes, and he saw me too."

"Did you recognize him?"

"No, he was an unfamiliar man."

"What did he look like?"

"He wore a gray polo shirt... seemed to be about forty. Tall, with bulging eyes, and what appeared to be a burn scar on his left cheek... He was bald and had a bleeding head. Blood also streamed down his face—it was terrifying. He looked shockingly at the toppled bicycle and me; I was dumbfounded, unable to utter a word."

"Was he holding anything?"

"Um... It was fleeting, so I can't be sure, but I seemed to see something like a flashlight in his pocket. I didn’t notice anything else."

"Did the man just run away?"

"Yes. He picked up his hat and ran toward the station. At first, I couldn't comprehend what had happened and stood there stunned. Then fear suddenly overwhelmed me, and I rushed home, forgetting the soda... though it was not good to leave the can on the roadside..."

Arisa chuckled awkwardly. At that time, she hadn't dreamed that her cousin had been killed in the nearby library.

"Risome-kun, can you believe me?"

She asked timidly, and Risome nodded once again with brisk acceptance: "What you said matches up with various facts. That man is probably the one the police are looking for, Kuwajima. Until last month, he was a library assistant."

"An assistant? Then I should know him."

"It's said he was self-conscious about his burn scar, so he only worked behind the office area. It's normal if you don’t know him."

“Is this Kuwajima the culprit?”

“I wouldn’t say so. But it’s uncertain for now.”

Risome pondered out loud in a summarizing thought, tapping the counter with his fingertips:

“What you said just now—can you tell the police as well?”

“Yeah… I thought I’d tell them if they asked.”

The reason she lied to Risome yesterday was because his questions came so unexpectedly, catching her off guard, and she didn’t know he was involved in the investigation.

No, more than that—perhaps she was afraid of truly getting entangled in the case. Maybe she feared confronting reality. She vaguely sensed that "The Star of the Country of Keys" was linked to Kyouke's death. Noticing this yet wanting to escape, she had attempted to cover it up and hide it.

Feeling watched, Arisa lifted her gaze to look outside the counter. She met the eyes of Hakata, the girl who was with Risome yesterday. Arisa wanted to hide and lowered her head. The paperback that fell from the counter was right by her feet. The bookmark had flown out of the book, with pages flipped to who knows where.

"...Risome-kun."

"What's up?"

"I suggest you not write stories about girls who like books."

"Why not?"

"Because the protagonist is a coward."

"So what?"

Risome’s face appeared within her field of vision as he bent down.

"When it’s too noisy around, wanting to cover ears and wrap oneself in a blanket is normal. Maybe it's cowardice, but sometimes, if you don't block the noise, you can't think."

Risome picked up the paperback, dusted it off, and handed it to her:

"Also, you've shared the secret with me. Catching the culprit is for others to handle. You don't need to worry anymore."

Arisa looked up at Risome’s face. He was propping his chin with his hand, gazing outside the counter, not looking at her.

He was using that expression to mask his own shyness.
Arisa smiled like the men laughing together on a paperback cover, "Are you encouraging me?" "I'm trying to keep you around. Without a partner who likes to escape, I'd feel lonely." It sounded like he was indeed hiding his shyness. Arisa thanked him and took the paperback. The feeling when her fingers touched the book was the same as usual. The paperback, the size of her palm, made her feel at ease.

The curious conversation at the counter seemed to have ended. Risome stood up from the chair, intending to leave the counter. But just before he stepped away, he raised a finger and added, "That book is incredibly interesting, you should escape with a more joyful expression!"

*

"Ah, Risome is actually there." As the study session's initial restlessness settled, everyone finally started to focus on studying. Sanae whispered in a voice only Yuzuno could hear. "Where?" "Look, over there!" She pointed to the library entrance behind them. For a moment, Yuzuno thought she was seeing things.

Inside the counter, the chairman of the library committee and Risome sat side by side. After saying "break" and leaving his seat, Risome hadn't returned, so Yuzuno wondered where he'd gone. "When... More importantly, how is he in the counter?" Ordinary students couldn't enter. Arisa Jomine didn't point this out, she just shyly hung her head. Risome sat beside her, expressionless. Suddenly, Arisa glanced at the reading room, meeting Yuzuno's gaze. The chairman quickly looked down to avoid her eyes. 

The atmosphere felt quite tense. Yuzuno thought they must be discussing the case. "The feeling is quite nice." Sanae's impression was markedly different. "He had a secret meeting with Rieko, and also something going on with Chizuru. Risome is not to be underestimated." "No way, with him that certainly can't happen!" "That's hard to say! Maybe he's eating sundaes with Chizuru and running by the sea with Rieko without us knowing." "I think he's likely to be turned into Chizuru's chair and throttled by Rieko." "But I think he pairs well with the library committee chairman." "Really…" A useless indoor person and a book-loving introverted girl. If forced into the "indoor type" category, they might indeed be a good match. Both of them also had excellent grades and often met at the library. And also—

"Right, he did something weird yesterday." "Huh? What did he do? Held hands?" "Risome smelled Arisa's bicycle seat." "Ah, that's too strange! That's literally the definition of strange! It proves he's deeply in love, it would be best to stop him!" "Is that so?" "Yes. If you're careless, you'll truly be taken away. Yuzuno is the main wife after all." "Punishment? Can punishment be administered?" "Huh? A polygamy?" "Hmm?" "Uh?"

The conversation went completely off track. Sanae shrugged in disappointment and turned to the person across the table. "What do you think, Kaori? Those two at the counter." Kaori, fervently writing in her workbook with a pencil, raised her head and said, "There's only one person." Looking back at the counter, both Yuzuno and Sanae were surprised. There was only Arisa sitting quietly, Risome had somehow disappeared. "You actually let him get away!" Sanae said angrily. "No, just now Risome was sitting right next to the library committee chairman, they seemed very close." "Tenma? That can't be." "Really. Also, I heard yesterday he smelled the chairman's bicycle seat." "Oh, he would do that." "Would do that... Anyway, what do you think?" "Hmm, well, I guess I can understand. I really like the smell of freshly printed newspapers and McDonald's paper bags." "I'm not talking about pleasant smells."

Sanae and Kaori's conversation also went off track. While listening, Yuzuno kept staring at the counter. The library committee chairman continued reading the paperback quietly as if Risome had never been there. The ribbon bookmark still nestled between her fingers, in the same position Yuzuno had seen when the study session started, and still the same book. However, there were slight changes.

The shadow of worry was no longer visible in her expression.

The Appearance of the Third X

The towering skyscrapers of DVDs and the collapsed ruins of excess comics, along with dolls, magazines, and empty e-commerce boxes, bathing in the sunset glow. The Hundred Poets Research Club room, occupied by Risome on the first floor of the cultural club activity rooms, remained in disarray. According to him, it was "just a lot of stuff." Yet Yuzuno thought each time, since he self-claimed occupancy of the school room, he should at least tidy it up.

After the study session disbanded, Yuzuno and Kaori came to this room to recharge their tired brains with some sweets. Several mugs already filled with barley tea and an open pack of fruit jelly on a wooden tray sat on the low table. The room's owner, as usual, sat on the bed, flipping through this week’s "Jump" issue.

"So, I've figured it out, Arisa Jomine wasn't only linked to the missing fake book but also ran into Nobuo Kuwajima by the vending machine near the library around 11 PM on the night of the incident." He was smoothly reporting his findings to the two other guests sitting at the low table with Yuzuno—her brother and Inspector Sendou. "She said she'd truthfully tell the police, so soon you can confirm this at her house."

After saying this, Risome watched for the reaction of the prefectural police pair. While Yuzuno and the others were shocked by this unexpected new piece of information, the inspector and her brother seemed to have skipped straight past surprise to a state of dejection.

"Police concluded after a day-long full-scale investigation the same as you did during your exam break, why?" "Don't be discouraged, detectives. I learned about the fake book from your investigation." "I was talking about Kuwajima." Sendou, exhausted, urged his subordinate, "Quickly report!" Her brother opened his notebook, detailing the police's findings: the testimony of Kazuya Kajiwara's friend Kohei Akashi, the investigation on former librarian Nobuo Kuwajima, the testimony of his mother Miyoko, and the items found near Kajiwara.

"In short, like I mentioned over the phone, aside from the computer and phone messages, nothing suspicious was discovered… The problem emerged later, regarding Kuwajima. He still hadn’t returned home by afternoon, so the investigators entered his apartment. As a result—" "Did you find a body?" "You're watching too much TV." Her brother dismissed Kaori’s assumption, placing several photos on the low table.

A six-mat tatami room. The futons never folded, clothes hung to dry in the room, and empty instant noodle bowls. But the most noticeable was the massive stack of books filling both the walls and floor. "This room is such a mess," Risome remarked after glancing at the photos, somewhat oblivious to his reflection. "Were all these books part of Kuwajima's personal collection? A former librarian indeed," Kaori commented. Though she wasn't at the scene yesterday, she spoke as if she knew everything. Since they didn’t discuss this matter during the study session, Risome must have told her.

"Even librarians should know their limits. Maybe he moved here a few weeks ago because the books were about to crash through the floor. But there was no one in the room."

"So you haven't…" 

"We haven’t met Kuwajima himself. This man is practically a ghost." At Yuzuno's observation, Sendou made a displeased sound. Her brother turned to the next page, saying, "However, we've found various pieces of evidence in the room."

"Firstly, blood-soaked gauze and towels were found in the trash can. The blood was type B, matching the residue in the counter. Additionally, a flashlight was found near the shoe cabinet. The handle was red." It matched the flashlight color Arisa Jomine described in her spoken testimony, which meant—

"In conclusion, this clarifies something. The person who left the bloodstains in the counter is Nobuo Kuwajima."

"Yes, I've already mentioned that." The frank expression of this fact left the police duo utterly deflated.

"Please restore your reputation with another report. For instance, did you find anyone hiding in the library after closing?" 

"No. Following your guidance, we thoroughly searched from the elevator to the stacks and found nothing." 

"And fingerprints?" 

"There are three places where Kajiwara's fingerprints were found: the keypad cover of the back door, the handle of the door connecting the office to the corridor on the office side, and the handle of the corridor door leading to the counter on the corridor side. The prints were quite clear, so it can be concluded that Kajiwara was the last person to touch these areas."

In her mind, Yuzuno mapped the office surroundings she had walked through yesterday. The keypad cover, and the doors of the office and counter. These areas were places that should have been closed but were opened. If Kajiwara was the last to touch the cover and door handles, he was likely the one who opened these doors, right?

"Matching fingerprints were found in Kuwajima's room and on the inside handle of the service door. This supports the fact that Kuwajima was indeed in the library on the night of the incident."

"And the items in the backpack and the utility blade in the hip pocket?"

"Only Kajiwara's fingerprints, and nothing else suspicious was found." 

"What about the second-floor restroom?"

"The fragments were indeed part of the blade's tip, plus trace amounts of a substance similar to the restroom floor material were detected on the fragments. However, after carefully checking the door and walls, there was nothing unusual… No fingerprints from either Kajiwara or Kuwajima were found there."

"Do you think the restroom is related to the incident?" Sendou asked Risome.

"The restroom contained some of the victim's belongings, of course it’s related!" 

"While that’s an undeniable discovery, why did it attach to the back of the adhesive tape already?"

"That’s simple, because it was stuck to the back of the tape originally."

Risome continued reading the magazine as he spoke, which only further drew a frustrated frown from the inspector. 

"Brother, what were the blood test results?" 

"Leaving aside the weapon, the results are quite straightforward. All the blood on the first floor belonged to Nobuo Kuwajima. All the blood found on the second floor belonged to Kajiwara. Oh, wasn’t the splatter on the second-floor ground peculiar? It seems to have been wiped off. As for the microscopic material found on the carpet, its amount in that area is less than elsewhere." 

“Could you tell us the precise area you believe to have been wiped?" 

"From the corpse’s toes to the passage, covering one square meter."

Kaori adjusted her red glasses slightly upward: 

"Wiping the floor suggests that something was spilled or dripped there, right? What could it be?"

"Could it be the killer’s blood that dripped there?" 

Yuzuno also ventured a guess, but her brother dismissed it. 

"I just mentioned it, all second-floor blood belongs to the victim. Plus, upon examining the library’s interior, including the floors, there was no reaction indicating a once-present bloodstain has been cleansed away."

"Hmm, then it must have been the murderer’s sweat or tears?" 

"This would be akin to a murder scene at Koshien Stadium…"

"However, it is an intriguing clue," Sendou commented, "We suspect some bodily fluid from the killer may have splattered onto the floor as well." 

"I find this illogical." The consultant remarked in a peculiar tone, "Any personal room could be a possibility, but the scene was right at the middle of the library’s open shelves. Every day, dozens of people come and go. Even if the killer sweats or spits on the floor, mixed with other substances, it can't become reliable evidence. Having deliberately erased it doesn’t make sense."

"Haven't you ever heard of something called a plotless drama?" 

"I prefer dramas with plots." 

Risome fidgeted with the magazine’s page, seemingly deep in thought. But soon, he said, "Let’s treat this as tomorrow's assignment." thus leaving this mystery. Subsequently, he switched the topic: 

"What about alibis?"

"We examined camera footage from the station and shopping street but the images weren’t clear… The alibis for the five librarians are unclear, and Kuwajima’s alibi couldn’t be verified either. However, the alibis for all staff other than the librarians were confirmed. If there’s a perpetrator, it must be one of the librarians who knew the code. 

"Additionally, we've found a testimony concerning Kajiwara, provided by the owner of the soba shop south of the library. He said he saw Kajiwara. Around a little after 7 PM, when he went outside to bring in the sign, he noticed Kajiwara standing on the road in front of the store. Kajiwara observed the library, pacing back and forth a couple of times, then quickly returned to the road."

Seven o'clock was when Kajiwara first went out. At that time, it indeed wasn’t for buying magazines but to go to the library. However, during that period, the librarians should still have been inside. He couldn't infiltrate the library and thus returned home.

Risome ignored Yuzuno’s tumultuous thoughts and swallowed his saliva: "What were the autopsy results?"

"They are consistent with the initial estimate. The time of death was at ten o'clock at night. The fatal injury was on the left temple. The injury to the right eye occurred first, and the temple was struck on the second occasion. Given the wound depth, the blood splatter occurred upon the second strike. Blood droplets landed only on the ground, indicating that after the first strike he staggered, presumably in a crouching position, lowering head height just before the second blow. No interval existed between the two strikes; he fell immediately afterward, dead within a minute."

Risome flipped a page, continuing, "Then, something very important: after the body fell to the ground, was there any indication of struggle or movement?"

"According to the autopsy, apart from the right hand, no signs of substantial movement were present." "And there were no indications that the head was moved?"

"No, there weren’t. You confirmed this yourself yesterday. Although bleeding from the left temple, there were almost no bloodstains on the left side of the face. This was because the head remained pressed against the ground." Her brother explained by pressing his own face against his palm, imaging the ground. Indeed, maintaining contact between the face and the ground would prevent it from soaking blood.

"There’s another new discovery." Just when Risome's questioning paused, Sendou piped up, "There is a computer at the checkout counter, and a large number of Kuwajima’s fingerprints were found on the keyboard and mouse. We examined the computer’s records from the night of the incident and discovered that between 9:35 and 9:50 PM, a library reader's personal information had been queried. Can you guess who?”

Seeing Risome silently shrug, the inspector announced the answer: “It was Kajiwara Arisa.”

Kaori straightened her back, and Yuzuno nearly spat out the jello she was chewing. Risome raised his head from the magazine.

“More accurately,” her brother elaborated, “it was a sweep of the library readers within the region with the surname ‘Kajiwara’ from start to end. Consequently, Kajiwara Arisa’s personal information was last pulled up at exactly 9:50 PM.”

"Even though it's personal information, this is the library reader's data. The only things that can be discerned are name, address, and age, I presume. Nevertheless, 9:50 PM is only ten minutes from the estimated time of death."

"I suspect that after this, Kuwajima was struck on the head, and a few minutes later, Kajiwara was murdered." The detectives conversed. Yuzuno and Kaori exchanged looks. This was an even more surprising turn of events than the fake book, requiring time to organize their thoughts.
"Well... then, Kuwajima tried to investigate the murdered Kyousuke Jomine? Did he sneak into the library to view some data?" 

"Yes," said Sendou. "Accessing the data requires a password to be entered on the staff computers. But, just like with the back door, the former librarian knew the password. If he could sneak in, he could check whatever he wanted."

"What was the relationship between Kyousuke and Kuwajima?"

"I don't know. However, based on testimonies that they talked on the day of the incident, it might be as it seems."

Sendou shook his barley tea cup, trying to melt the ice faster, and bluntly expressed his opinion:

"Even after being dismissed, Nobuo Kuwajima continued to frequent the library and noticed that Kyousuke Jomine was hiding counterfeit books inside. He used this to threaten Kyousuke, demanding he cooperate in his criminal activities, such as sneaking into the library at night to steal books and sell them to second-hand bookstores.

"Kuwajima and Kyousuke agreed on a time and sneaked into the library around 9:30. While Kyousuke moved books on the second floor, Kuwajima accessed the computer at the counter. The more weaknesses you grasp while threatening someone, the better. Therefore, he started browsing the reader information, trying to obtain Kyousuke's personal details. But Kyousuke realized what was happening. To protect himself, he hit Kuwajima with a book. Kuwajima fell by the counter but got up, grabbed a weapon, chased Kyousuke on the second floor, and retaliated against him... right, Risome?"

"It's like when 'Assassination Classroom' was made into an anime!"

"Stop thinking about 'Jump'!"

In the midst of the inspector's long-winded explanation, the eyes of the useless person drifted back to a magazine. He closed the magazine as if it's a hassle.

"Detective, you are practically suggesting that Kuwajima Nobuo is the culprit."

"He's been hiding his whereabouts ever since running away from the scene! Of course, I suspect him. The investigation headquarters is currently treating Kuwajima Nobuo as a suspect."

"What about the death message from 'Kogayama'?"

"Like you said yesterday, it's a disguise. Jomine actually only wrote 'く', right? Afterward, Kuwajima saw the main character in a book by coincidence and faked the 'く' of Kogayama to look like the 'く' of Kuwajima."

"I might have said something like this too: 'The possibility that "Person X" and "Culprit K" are the same is very low.' Kyousuke Jomine was killed at 10 PM. Kuwajima Nobuo ran out of the library an hour later. If Kuwajima is the killer, why did he linger at the scene for an entire hour?"

"I've been slowly grasping your weaknesses lately."

Sendou stared at the boy with narrowed eyes.

"You have no understanding of human nature."

Risome did not retort, gently placed the magazine beside him, and waited for the inspector to continue.

"When a person is extremely angry, they forget all sorts of things. Like reason, like pain, for example. Kuwajima Nobuo, hit on the head, forgetfully snatched the weapon from Jomine, chased him down, and killed him in front of that bookshelf. Then, as his excitement faded, the pain from his head wound hit him, and Kuwajima fainted beside the corpse. He regained consciousness an hour later. Realizing the trouble he'd caused, Kuwajima hurriedly fled from the library—this scene, however, was seen by Arisa Jomine."

"If that's the case, it does make sense."

"The time gap makes sense now."

Yuzuno and her brother nodded together. Kaori, however, raised her hand and said:

"But..."

"In this situation, isn't it strange that there was no blood from Kuwajima found on the second floor? Only Kyousuke's blood was there!"

"His bleeding wasn't that profuse to begin with, and the blood might have clotted to an extent while chasing Kyousuke. Depending on the way he fell, no blood stains might be left on the ground. He might have drooled in his unconsciousness, cleaning the floor."

"Uh-huh, I see."

"What do you think?"

Sendou, looking for agreement from everyone, turned around to ask the consultant as a final move.

However, Risome quietly shook his head on his bed.

"Well... I still think that besides Kuwajima Nobuo and Kyousuke Jomine, there was another person in the library."

"Why?"

"There are several reasons. For example, fingerprints. The culprit thoroughly wiped the fingerprints off the keyboard and door handles. If Kuwajima Nobuo was the culprit, wouldn't it be strange for him not to clean up the fingerprints left on the counter and other places?"

"He might have forgotten in a panic. It happens."

"Then there's another point. Arisa Jomine testified that when she saw Kuwajima Nobuo, he was only holding a red flashlight, nothing else. So who took 'The Country of Keys' or the silver flashlight Kyousuke Jomine was carrying?"

Sendou, just about to drink his barley tea, stopped abruptly. He seemed not to have considered this matter. He placed the glass back on the short-legged table, hesitantly saying "Ah":

"Maybe he disposed of it by the library building before leaving its yard. Like digging a hole and burying it."

"Would anyone dispose of something they specifically took out of the library right next to its building?"

"You think Kuwajima Nobuo isn't the culprit?"

"I don't have concrete evidence yet, but that's my current stance."

Risome finished with a sarcastic tone and turned over on his bed. Sendou sulked and silently stuffed jelly into his mouth. The two of them didn't get along at all.

An awkward atmosphere filled the room. After a while, Yuzuno's brother mumbled to himself, "If there's another culprit, why take away the book?"

"Finally, a constructive comment."

The consultant gazed at the ceiling with a slight smile from his bed:

"That might just be the key to the case."

"It seems we haven't really rested at all."

Locking the door of the Hundred Poets Study Group room, Kaori said. Yuzuno also murmured with little energy, "You're right." Both had originally come by to recharge with some sweets, only to wind up tangled in a reporting session and exhausting their brains instead.

The setting sun turned the deserted school red. The two of them headed through the chill breeze toward the main entrance.

"So you know about the case, Kaori? You seem quite informed!"

"That's because Tama left early from the exam yesterday. I hid in the activity room in the evening to fish out information. He doesn't seem keen on participating too much this time around, given he still has to study."

"Yeah, that's what I thought too."

Yuzuno felt more and more exhausted. She just wanted to get home quickly and tackle her kanji and English vocabulary problems.

"But you knew about the relationship between Jomine and Risome from the start?"

"I vaguely knew they were discussing the case. Even if I didn't know, I knew Risome doesn't have any romantic rumors."

"Sanae is still guessing that Risome has some other partner. Like Yatsuhashi-san or Harigaya-san."

"That's quite a leap of imagination, huh?"

"Exactly."

The two exchanged wry smiles.

When leaving the room, the useless person had already started napping on the bed. "Did you stay up all night watching videos again?" they asked him. He muttered an animation title like "Give me cold noodles." It seemed that a hectic life wasn't suitable for someone whose lifestyle and character were akin to hiding underground. Even Kaori, who had long interacted with him, said so—

Then suddenly, Yuzuno had a superfluous thought.

Right there beside her, grinning gleefully—Kaori Sakasaka?

For ten years, a classmate and friend. Also, the only person who knew the secret of the activity room from the start. The first time they met, when Yuzuno asked about their relationship, Kaori casually said they were "childhood friends" and hadn't thought about it ever since. But even if they were childhood friends, would she visit the activity room every day?

Is their relationship closer? Yuzuno was already accustomed to how they were together, so imagining it wasn't that hard, at least easier than with anyone else.

"Sanae also said, Kaori, you seem... suspicious."

Yuzuno was embarrassed to ask directly, so she made a little lie.

Kaori pointed at herself and said, "Me? No, no. Although people occasionally ask me that, I'm really not."

She lightly denied it. Yuzuno only responded with, "Of course."

Their conversation abruptly ended there, and they walked silently down the path between the school buildings. Usually, at this time, you could hear running chants, the brass band's performance, or the sound of basketball shoes squeaking against the floor, yet during exams, Kazekozan High was silent.

When they reached the front courtyard, Kaori stopped and said:

"He might never like anyone again."

She looked back at the building behind where the Cultural Clubs' activity rooms were.

Yuzuno stood a few steps behind her, watching Kaori's profile. Though her tone was light and casual, her smile had lost its radiance. Another gust of wind came, making the leaves in the courtyard trees whisper.

Kaori seemed to want her own voice hidden among them, softly saying:

"Because..."

"What?"

Yuzuno's question brought her back to reality. She turned her head saying "Nothing," then shifted her gaze to the entrance.

"Oh, right. I left my camera in the activity room. I'll go fetch it, see you later!"

Kaori lightly waved and ran off. Just at the moment she turned around, her red-framed glasses flashed orange in the sunlight.

Yuzuno stood briefly where she was.

What could she have meant by what she said earlier?

Or perhaps she had misheard it entirely? Her voice was indeed quite low, mixed with the sound of wind and leaves. Yuzuno wasn't confident about what she heard, piecing it together from lip movements alone, which was very vague.

However—she moved on again, turning her focus inward:

The quietly muttering Kaori carried an air of loneliness she had seen before. On the platform at the Negishi Station, at the shrine during summer activities. Kaori's cheerful and bright smile would often take on a shadow when talking about Risome. Plus, the way she referred to Risome as "that person" made it sound like she was talking about someone unfamiliar, distant, a man far removed...

"Bzzzz—"

Just as she was ascending the slope, her phone vibrated inside her bag. It was an email. Still preoccupied with Kaori, Yuzuno pulled out her phone. She looked at the sender's name twice—

Risome Kyouka.

* 

After drying her hair, Arisa returned to her room on the second floor.

The detectives who had come to gather information left about thirty minutes ago. It seems they had already spoken to Risome (who was cooperating with the police), so the questioning proceeded more smoothly than expected. Though Arisa wasn't good at speaking with others, much less with detectives for the first time, her heart was still pounding heavily. Nevertheless, she believed she had addressed everything positively and said all she could.

Detectives Sendou and Hakata had sincerely listened to Arisa's account. They didn't press too hard on the issue of counterfeit books, but in exchange, they took the manuscript of "The Planet of the Keys." The thought of her book being read in such a manner was something she had never dreamed possible. Everything over these past few days was beyond her wildest imagination.

Arisa leaned back in her chair and gazed at the ceiling.

Even after confessing her secrets to the detectives, even after showering and washing clean her body, she couldn't shake off her anxiety. Her mother's phone conversation came through intermittently from downstairs. It seemed Aunt Miyoko had trouble arranging the funeral alone, so Arisa's parents also extended their help. Her mother's voice was faster than usual, mingled with shock and a sense of loss. Arisa felt the same. The paperback book with a bookmark on the desk offered some comfort.

She remembered Risome's words. It's okay, he is here, the police are taking action. So just continue to do what you need to do. Now, focus on preparing for exams. There's a world history exam tomorrow; although she felt she was mostly ready, it wouldn't hurt to review as a last check.

She opened her textbook and notebook, and began studying.

Her gaze fell outside the window by chance.

In the next moment, she was already astonished and lowered her head to the desk. Then, trembling, she looked out the window again. The road in front of the house was only bathed in streetlight, devoid of any people. Her freshly washed skin began to sweat again, and her heartbeat was faster than when facing the detectives.

Could it be psychological?

No, just now, she definitely—definitely saw something. Moreover, her eyes met the other person's.

A man had been standing under the streetlight, staring fixedly at this room.

Wearing a hat, with bulging eyes and a burn scar on his cheek. It was that man!

Erich Kästner (1899–1974) along with James Krüss (1926–1997) and Michael Ende (1929–1995) mentioned below are all German authors.

These two sets of romanized words correspond to "Mori Asada Zero" and "Jomine Arisa."

In Japanese, "seisai" (正妻) and "seisai" (制裁) are homophonic words with different meanings.
The Third Day: Modern Literature, English Reading, Math I, Pursuit, and The Past

1. The Doctrine of Passing By "How was the world history exam?" At first, she didn't even realize someone was speaking to her. "Chairperson!" It wasn't until the second call that she looked up. After class in the second-year (2) class. Tomorrow's exam schedule was written on the blackboard, and students were busy packing up to go home. Standing at the table was Yayoi Mitada, who was also a member of the library committee. "Ah, yeah," Arisa answered, "It seemed pretty hard." "Really? Even the chairperson found it difficult?" "Yeah, the question on Rome was insane." "Oh, that question. It must be the teacher's interest." "Yeah." The conversation paused. Avoiding her gaze, Yayoi worriedly asked, "Chairperson, are you okay?" "Huh? Why do you ask?" "It's just that you seem very anxious." Yayoi's words were vague. Whether she had noticed the connection between Arisa and the student killed in the library, or if she was simply aware of Arisa's gloomy expression, she wasn't sure. In any case, Arisa could only reply, "No problem." "Really?" Yayoi looked worriedly at Arisa's face, who felt as if she were being seen through, a pang of heartache. "I mean, if you don't mind, you can talk to me about anything, you know." "No... no problem, really! It's nothing major." "That's good to hear." Arisa forced a smile with her stiff lips, stood up, said goodbye, and walked toward the door. Yayoi watched Arisa leave, claiming to be relieved, but still looking worried. Her friend's concern was, in fact, spot-on. Far from being fine, a huge issue had arisen. Moreover, she might also be involved. Not only that, the man standing at her door last night—the same one she saw at the vending machine—his face wouldn't leave her mind. But telling Yayoi about it wouldn't help. The sunshine was bright today too, yet the empty corridor felt chilling. She rubbed her goosebump-covered arm, intending to head to the entrance. It was then that a girl came running from the stairs, it was Kaori Sakasaka, the newspaper club president. Red glasses, a red hairclip, and in one hand, a 500 ml bottle filled with a red liquid without a label. "Sorry to keep you waiting!" Kaori brushed past Arisa and entered next door's second-year (1) class. Inside, the voices of two boys could be heard: "Hey!" "Good job!" One of the voices had become all too familiar, from behind the counter in the library yesterday. The door was open, and she glanced inside to see Risome and the drama club president, Kajiwara. Sitting by the window, they were eating snacks and chatting. Kaori, looking as if she'd just completed some errand, handed the bottle to Risome. "You're fast! Where did you get it?" "From the Paranormal Phenomena Research Association's office." "Didn't expect our school's society to take it seriously... They even drew magic circles on campus recently." "And they also have potted mandrakes and dried garlic!" "Their clubroom is like a demon world!" "Your clubroom can rival that!" "Don't confuse theater props with magic... By the way, isn't our blood plasma good enough for you?" "Well, I am pursuing realism. Ah, I don't need this much, though." "What? Why didn't you say so earlier?... Hey, Arisa." Even though she didn't plan to hide, she was noticed by Kaori. She nodded slightly and timidly stepped into the classroom. As she got closer and looked, the red liquid in the bottle was surprisingly dark. "What's in the bottle?" "Pig's blood." Kaori said nonchalantly. Pig's blood? "What are you going to do with it?" "Pour it on the ground." "Sabbath?" "Experiment. A science experiment!" Risome spouted words she couldn't comprehend and stuffed the bottle into the side pocket of his backpack. "Kaori, if you can, I also need saliva and bodily fluids." "Oh— Those things, even if you ask me..." "Can't prepare them?" "Can prepare... huh? You're asking me to prepare them?" "Risome, calm down! Calm down! Let's discuss over there, shall we?" "Forget it, let's just use water." Risome ignored Kajiwara's attempt at persuasion. He tossed the last snack into his mouth, stood up, and said goodbye to Kaori and the others before heading to the door. The backpack on his shoulder, with pig's blood visible... Arisa still couldn't fathom the situation. "Where are you going, Risome?" "To the library." Another brief response. Arisa had an epiphany. Blood, experiments, and the library. Could he be investigating the case? At that moment, an unprecedented idea popped up in the corner of her mind. Yes, the library. Going to the library might provide new information, might get her closer to the culprit. Cousin Kyouji's actions, the man standing at her door—she might find out something. "I... I say!" Realizing this, the words she wanted to say burst out from her mouth without thinking. Facing Risome, who turned around, Arisa pleaded with more vigor than she usually showed: "Take me with you too!" * "Oh man, whatever happens, there's only one more day!" "Just one more day..." Exhibiting opposing reactions, Sanae and Yuzuno walked down the gentle slope leading to the main gate. The third day of final exams, with two wins and one loss. Modern literature, which she was originally good at, and Math I, which she crammed for, went okay. But she had no confidence in English reading, not even enough energy to check her answers. "If I were born in America, I wouldn't have to deal with this!" "If that were the case, you'd be worrying about French exams or something... Well, let the past be past, let's talk about tomorrow." "Tomorrow..." On the last day, they'd have English composition and Japanese history exams, along with thirty-minute health and physical education, and home economics. Time allocation was the same as the second and third days but with the most subjects. "How's Japanese history? Reviewed it?" "I think Japanese history should be fine." "Oh." "But I have no idea about the others, what should I do?" "Yuzuno, you're always like this..." "You always say that, but how about you?" "Oh look, it's Arisa!" Sanae sidestepped the topic and turned to the main gate. Was it because she didn't review? Following her friend's gaze, indeed, it was Rieko Nakamura. Hiding behind the fence like yesterday, talking with another student. But today's counterpart wasn't Risome, rather the beautiful Yamato Nadeshiko—Chizuru Yatsuhashi. Learning the lesson from yesterday, Yuzuno and Sanae didn't eavesdrop, but their expressions spoke volumes. Chizuru appeared relaxed, while Rieko looked troubled. "Please follow these steps." As they approached the main gate, they overheard Chizuru's voice. With light steps, she walked past Yuzuno and Sanae, exiting the school gate. What did she mean by steps? Yesterday, Risome mentioned they were discussing exam strategies, was she also in that situation? Were top-ranked students consulting Rieko because her academics were excellent? If they asked Kaori, she'd likely sport a cheeky grin with a title from a shounen manga: "Rank Zero—the Hidden Queen!" "Let's quickly quiz each other on tomorrow's grammar questions!" A practical suggestion pulled Yuzuno back to reality from her imagination. Sanae pulled a hefty English grammar reference book from her bag. The green cover bore an unintelligible title: "Let's Fly Into the Forest of English." It's just the beginning, entering the woods makes more sense. If you suddenly fly into the forest, what if you get into danger? Yuzuno reached into her bag, intending to pull out her reference book. However, she suddenly realized: The bag felt light. "Oops... I left the reference book in the activity room." This book wasn't used in class regularly, and it took up space in the classroom locker, so Yuzuno had stored it in the activity room's locker, untouched. She had planned to bring it home today, but the fatigue from exams made her forget. Without the book, how could she study! Yuzuno told Sanae and quickly turned back. She could hear Sanae teasing her, "Take your time!" almost colliding with Rieko at the main gate. Although this slope was called "gentle," it was actually quite steep, and halfway up, her legs felt heavy, as if they wouldn't move. Along with this weight, the nearly forgotten negative thoughts seemed to swell again. The final exams were distressing, but there was another reason for her troubles— "Hey!" When she reached the top of the slope, she encountered Risome. Yuzuno stopped immediately. "Slept in again today?" "How could I possibly be late! I forgot something... Ah, Jomine-san, hello!" Halfway through retorting, she noticed Arisa Jomine beside him, so Yuzuno politely bowed. Risome held a small bottle of mineral water in one hand, with a plastic bottle filled with a red liquid protruding from his bag. "Is that tomato juice?" "It's pig's blood." "Oh, pig's blood... pig's blood?!" She couldn't help but ask again. "I've always thought you look listless during the day, like a vampire, finally awakened today?" "No way, I wouldn't drink that!" "Then what are you using it for?" "Pour it on the floor." "I see." To maintain mental hygiene, Yuzuno thought it best not to inquire further. "What's with the water in your hand? Holy water?" "Volvic." "Completely normal, that's good." "I originally wanted Kaori's bodily fluids." "Not normal at all!" Is he planning to hold a live ritual to summon a demon? Arisa beside him also seemed perplexed, shoulders hunched, gazing awkwardly around. While knowing they aren't that kind of couple, the sight of them together under sunlight filtering through tree leaves looked like a painting. "Well, where are you two going?" "Library. Investigating a case. Wanna come?" "Alright... no." Yuzuno reflexively nodded but immediately pulled back her words. "I have to study today, not going." Risome briefly showed a surprised expression, "Alright," he said, then emotionlessly began descending the slope. Arisa nodded to Yuzuno again, catching up with him. Only after their figures disappeared did Yuzuno head towards the athletic clubs' activity building. Despite finishing the slope, her steps were still heavy. She thought her choice might have been right. Having to study was true, and it felt awkward to hang out with him with this mindset. Besides the examinations, there was another thing on her mind. That was Risome. Yuzuno entered the empty activity room, opened the locker, and immediately found the English reference book. When summer vacation started, she unconsciously got influenced by Risome's room, making her locker a mess, but she didn't let it bother her, persisted in organizing, and it paid off, as evidenced here. Yuzuno closed the locker door and suddenly felt silly for her franticness. She sighed, sat on the narrow bench in the middle of the room, and put the reference book in her bag. She then took out her phone and opened the email Kyouka sent yesterday. Dear Yuzuno Hakata, The lingering summer heat... I apologize for the long silence after leaving Kazekozan’s summer events... The lengthy email continued in this formal tone, yet was mixed with cute emoticons, oddly enough. In summary, it was an invitation to a tea outing. Kyouka was two years younger than minor Risome and, unlike her useless brother, a proper, courteous, albeit sometimes peculiar, well-mannered child. She was now in her third year of middle school, attending the prestigious Hiten Academy's junior high section in a nearby town. Being invited by such a girl, naturally, Yuzuno felt delighted, but since yesterday, she had been hesitating how to respond. It wasn't just because she was busy with final exams. It was also because talking to Kyouka alone made her slightly uneasy. Because she might break her promise to Kaori. When Yuzuno first met Kyouka, about a month ago, she asked Kyouka about her long-suspected curiosity regarding Risome's family situation. Why didn’t he live at home but stayed at school instead? The answer she received was: "Our father severed ties with him." Kyouka said the father disowned him, and he voluntarily left home. Hence, he was homeless and ended up living in the activity room. Yuzuno wanted to know what exactly happened, so she inquired Kaori, who had known Risome for a long time, the next day. However, Kaori refused. Kaori not only repeatedly emphasized "not to mention this in front of him," but also implored Yuzuno not to tell others. From Kaori's earnest appeal for her, Yuzuno deeply understood two points: First, it was a taboo subject; Second, Risome disliked people prying about it. Since then, Yuzuno had buried it in her heart. Yet, if she were to meet Kyouka, she felt she would surely ask something. She felt she might betray Kaori and Risome by doing something against their wishes, which made her feel guilty. She pressed the reply button, attempting to write a response, typed a few lines, but instantly changed her mind, deleting them altogether. This repeated several times since yesterday, and still, she hadn't replied. Yuzuno closed her phone, looking up at the ceiling. The rusted fire sprinklers and the dusty fluorescent lights. The sight when gazing alone was so hollow, it felt like this wasn't the usual bustling activity room. She recalled doubts that had surfaced at some point. During the investigation of the aquarium case and the summer events at Kazekozan, she experienced it. What scenery did Risome's pitch-black eyes reflect? Would there ever be a day when she could understand? Creak— The stubborn door creaked open. It was the captain, Nao Sugawa, who entered. "Oh? Hakata?" "Tha...thank you for your hard work!" Yuzuno stood up and bowed. For some reason, the captain was wearing the team’s training attire instead of the uniform, and her skin was glistening with sweat. "Hakata, are you here for a run too?" "No, I came to fetch my reference book... Ah, Sugawa-san, did you go for a run?" "I just ran around the school twice. Felt my body was sluggish." The captain opened her locker nonchalantly. It seemed she had changed into her workout clothes in the activity room after the exam for self-training. Although she only ran around the school, Kazekozan’s campus was so wastefully large, one lap was nearly a kilometer. "Have you finished your revision?" "Basically done, plus, I felt suffocated just by studying all the time." Yuzuno, almost exhausted, sat heavily on the bench again, staring at the captain wiping her nape with a towel. Her slender, toned legs looked great in training shorts. Despite the closed curtains, her sweat shimmered as if it had absorbed sunlight, making her skin shine brightly. "I really wish I could be like Sugawa-san." The words slipped out unintentionally. The captain turned back, "Why say that suddenly?" "Look at you, you're good at everything and so straightforward." "What are you talking about?" The captain smiled bitterly, "Hakata is the straightforward one." There's no clear direction to move forward. Uninclined to continue the conversation, Yuzuno lowered her head. The captain brought a sports drink to her lips and drank. Through the mirror on the locker, it felt like she was watching her.
"Do you have any worries?"

"Nothing major."

But there were indeed worries.

"How should I put it... I really want to understand someone, to figure out what's going on with him, but he might not want anyone to know about him. If I found out his matters, he would probably be very upset. But I really want to know... What do you think I should do in this situation?"

Yuzuno trailed off, not even sure what she was saying. The captain listened while changing into her school uniform, paused with her arm mid-sleeve, turned to Yuzuno, and said:

"So it's about considering your feelings or the other person's?"

"Yeah, that's right."

Captain Sugawa sighed softly and sat down on Yuzuno's left, even closer than yesterday at the library. She leaned slightly toward Yuzuno.

Their arms, shoulders, and hair softly touched.

"Hakata, you're in your teens."

Yuzuno looked at the captain. She smiled dreamily, eyes closed. Her blouse was unbuttoned, revealing her well-proportioned, fair, unadorned body. Yuzuno quickly turned her face away.

"When I was in middle school, I faced something similar. I was troubled whether to consider my own feelings or the other person's."

"So which did you choose in the end?"

"The other person’s feelings," the captain said, slightly opening her eyes, "but, I really regret it now."

"Oh dear, sorry, I'm all sweaty."

The captain hastily moved away from Yuzuno. She didn’t smell sweat, but the warm sunshine on her skin. However, this scent was quickly replaced by the smell of deodorant spray.

"I think Hakata can just go for it."

The captain said as she laced her blouse.

"What if I choose the wrong path?"

"I don't know about that."

"Uh?"

"I can’t take on such a big responsibility. It’s not like I’m all-knowing."

She concluded mockingly, then turned back. Her usually strong leadership face now looked quite embarrassed.

"However, I don’t want Hakata to avoid things like I did. That’s what I wanted to say."

The captain finished changing, said goodbye, and left the activity room. Yuzuno wanted to say goodbye but the door was already closed.

Yuzuno stared blankly at the door plastered with training plans, then as if remembering something, she shifted her gaze to the left where the captain had sat, and lowered her head again. She rubbed her upper arm and pondered silently in the empty activity room.

Before long, she stood up and turned on her phone.

Heading to the library on a sunny day

"Are you really going to follow?"

Risome asked in surprise as they reached the main entrance. Arisa nodded tightly with pursed lips.

"I want to understand the case. If it bothers you, I won't."

"No, it’s actually a big help to have a library readers’ representative come along. Oh, by the way, didn’t cycle today?"

"Yeah, I walked today... Didn’t feel like cycling."

The real reason was her inexplicable itchiness whenever she straddled her bike, but she didn’t plan on telling the person who caused this reaction.

"That’s quite a healthy lifestyle."

Risome commented as they stepped off the campus. Walking to school is healthy living—this guy talks like an old man.

Even though some time had passed after school, there were still many students around, exchanging thoughts on today's exams and grumbling about tomorrow's subjects. Today, news spread that prizes would be given to the top scorers by the newspaper club, igniting fervor among the second-years. Competing for prizes in exams might seem excessive, but since a cheating scandal last time left second-years unmotivated, if this scheme could dispel the gloom, the newspaper club surely did its part well.

"Did the police visit your house yesterday?"

"Yes. A police chief named Sendou and his subordinate. I told them everything I knew."

"What exactly did you tell them? If there’s anything I don’t know, please elaborate."

"Mainly just confirmed what you had deduced... Oh, but they did ask about meeting Kyouka on Monday."

Arisa recounted meeting Kyouka at the library the afternoon of the incident. They chatted about “The Star of the Land of Keys” as usual, and Kyouka was hesitant when parting. Risome was particularly interested in Kyouka's conversation with Koyama before greeting Arisa.

"You heard Kyouka say, 'Could you think of a way? Absolutely by today?'"

"Yes. Kyouka said he consulted about retrieving a book from the stacks."

"So, not just saying hello."

Risome sneered lightly.

"Are you suspecting Mr. Koyama? But the chief also said, the information about the death is unreliable."

"I don’t think he’s the culprit. However, not being the killer doesn’t mean he’s not involved in the crime."

The detective seemed to have found an answer.

"Anything else unusual?"

"Something did happen after the police left."

She thought that even if she told Risome about Nobuo Kuwajima at her door, he wouldn’t believe it. But Risome didn’t laugh it off or conclude she was mistaken; instead, he quietly listened and then took out his phone and asked, "Did you tell the police about this?"

"Not yet. I feared I was seeing things… Should I?"

"I’ll inform them now."

Risome quickly operated his phone and put it away immediately. Apparently, he had emailed the police.

"If I wasn’t mistaken, then why did he come to find me…"

"I don’t know. But from the police investigation, it seems Kuwajima used the library’s database to methodically look up readers with the surname 'Jomine', so he knowing your address isn’t surprising."

"Address..."

Arisa looked around. 

That thought passed as they reached the station. Despite being a weekday, it was bustling around the roundabout. Young people waiting for companions, parents and children leaving the bakery, aunties buying lottery tickets, the line at the bus stop, Kazekozan students entering the station. The past fear of being watched by the scarred man revived, making her knees weak.

"Don’t worry," Risome said, "tonight a detective will be stationed near your house. If they capture Kuwajima, the police will celebrate. Don’t think about it, just study and read or write as usual."

"Write… write something?"

Barely opening her mouth, Arisa mumbled.

"Maybe, I won’t write again."

With her close cousin murdered, her written novel taken, and possibly linked to the case, she couldn’t possibly continue writing new things in such a state. Not now, maybe not ever.

It’s okay, she never seriously planned to become a novelist anyway.

Arisa tightened the shoulder strap of her bag and walked forward, staring at the dark asphalt ground of the roundabout. Risome seemed to sense her thoughts and turned away.

They stopped at the crossing. The unsettling alarm, the whistle of the passing train. Her tied hair swayed in the wind.

Reaching the opposite side of the station, they entered a somewhat desolate shopping street. The only lively spot was a hamburger shop. On the balcony was the tennis club captain and a second-year girl. She remembered hearing at the end of summer break that they were dating. They were sharing a large fries, chatting closely.

Arisa looked at Risome, suddenly compelled to tidy her hair, so she combed her bangs with her hands. He walked slightly faster than Arisa. She suddenly remembered a first-year named Hakata who spoke intimately with Risome and wondered about their relationship.

Dark eyes turned to Arisa.

"What’s 'The Star of the Land of Keys' about?"

Arisa was startled and replied:

"Well..."

"I remember it’s a fantasy novel, right? Describes human society from the viewpoint of a cat-eared girl?"

"No, it's not like that."

Actually, she just mimicked the manga title by Yumiko Oshima poorly. Moreover—

"It’s not a fantasy novel, it’s a mystery novel."

On her correction, Risome raised his eyebrows immediately:

"Didn't you say yesterday it was fantasy style?"

"I meant 'mystery in a fantasy style'… but before I could finish, you went on by yourself."

He was embarrassed. "Oh, did I?"

Arisa organized the content in her mind and started describing the introduction to her story. Since the draft had already been handed over to the police, there was no use in being embarrassed now.

"There’s a fictional planet called 'The Star of the Land of Keys', where people strictly follow a law that 'all entrances and exits must be locked'. Not only the front doors but also inside doors, storerooms, and windows require keys for each lock. People thus carry a large bunch of keys with them."

"What an inconvenient planet to live on."

"Right. So there are dissenters… One day, an eccentric prince built a room in the palace without locks. The prince started living there and advocated for not locking unnecessary places. But a few days later, in that room..."

"Was murdered?"

"Yes. It’s a locked-room murder."

"A locked room? The room’s not locked, right?"

"It shouldn’t be. But somehow, the doors and windows couldn’t be opened. After breaking in, they couldn’t figure out who or what method blocked the door. Hence, there’s a belief it was done by a 'key sprite', and they searched the city to capture the culprit. That’s roughly the story..."

How the murderer sealed the doors without a trace in an unlocked room? Arisa believed the story’s highlights were the unusual key-laden world and the irresistible impossible situation. 

She also wanted to hear Risome’s opinion, but his only comment was, "It’s a bit like Momotaro Kita."

"Since it’s a mystery, it’s about how the crime was executed, right?"

"Uh, uh. But I won’t spoil the trick for you."

"I didn’t ask you for spoilers though. So you wrote a mystery novel."

Risome nodded, walked in silence. Then repeated thoughtfully, "A mystery..."

Being a public facility, Kazekozan Library had resumed its usual operations. All restricted access tapes were removed, and curiosity seekers were gone. Although there was still a TV station car in the parking lot, it stood there in loneliness. They probably deemed this a commonplace case; the news hadn’t mentioned anything about the falsified library books and death notification.

Standing still at the automatic doors, Arisa clenched her fists, looking up at the arched roof. It was the "Mansion of Books" revisited after three days; where she played with her cousin many times, last spoke with him, and where he was brutally murdered—if she claimed not to hesitate entering, it would be a lie.

But she was the one who decided to come.

Following Risome, she stepped forward. As if in response to her determination, the door opened. The intensified air density stimulated her skin more strongly than usual.

Inside were hardly any readers. The young female librarian, Uehashi Hikari, sat at the loan counter. Engrossed in her computer screen, she didn’t notice them. Risome strolled toward the children’s section as if taking a walk.

“What are you planning to do?”

“I’ll first hear the opinion of the library readers’ representative. Please tell me about the people here, your impressions will do.”

The unexpected challenge shook her internally. However, since she came, she wanted to be useful.

“Uh hmm—” Arisa mulled over it while describing.

“Let’s start with Director Nariki… Director Nariki strictly enforces rules like timely returns and thoughtfully considers readers as a teacher would. She’s worked here for about twenty years, knowledgeable and experienced. Mr. Teramura is the second longest-serving, for around fifteen years. He’s approachable and organizes reading sessions and events. And, well, physically strong as he appears, it’s reassuring. I often see him carrying many books around.”

Arisa slowed her steps to the Aozora Bunko shelves along the wall.

“Mr. Koyama is quiet and sometimes spaced out. But he’s not gloomy; he listens kindly when approached. He had a good relationship with my cousin Kyoukyo. Uh, he once showed me a family photo. Smiling broadly and surrounded by two girls. He seems like a good father at home."

“He seems to be separated from his wife.”

“Huh!?”

Arisa interrupted the introductions. Not only because she heard unexpected information. But also because she saw Risome through the shelves performing a strange act in the reading room.

After stopping at the room’s corner, he squatted on the light gray rug, took out pig's blood from his bag, and dripped it on the floor. Waving his wrist like sprinkling pepper, he dripped three times at intervals, finally leaving three horizontally arranged stains on the carpet. Each droplet immediately seeped into the fibers, forming red circles one to two centimeters in diameter.

“What… what are you doing?”

Risome didn’t answer, looking at his phone as if activating a timer. Then, stretching his finger to the leftmost blood stain, he gently wiped it. His fingertip turned red.

He wiped his finger clean with a wet wipe and took out a handkerchief, wiping the middle trace two or three times. The blood became blurry, transferring a little onto the handkerchief, but the color on the carpet didn’t lighten due to deep absorption.

Next, he wiped the rightmost stain with a wet wipe. The stain was almost cleaned off, but the moisture seeped into the carpet, creating a darkened spot.

“You... you stained the floor; they’ll be angry!”

Still unresponding, Risome checked his phone; a minute had passed. Touching the leftmost stain again, no blood stuck to his finger this time. He pressed his finger back on the stain, this time rubbing it with some force, and his finger got stained. 

Wiping his finger clean with a wet tissue, he opened a water bottle. Using the same wrist motion, he sprinkled water closer than the three stains, leaving irregular droplets like early raindrops. Quickly, he wiped with the handkerchief. As with the blood, water spots blurred, some wiped away, but most soaked into the carpet.

“Hmm.”

Staring intently at the tannish floor marks he made, Risome finally stood up. He seemed ready to return to the lobby.

“Were you experimenting?”

"In a way."

In a way—what kind of way?

“What about the remaining two?”

“Oh, well... Mr. Nasu is cheerful but a bit slow. Occasionally causes messes, angering others. Miss Uehashi is probably the one who spoke to me the most. She is good at drawing and making stickers, like a reliable older sister. When asking her to find a book, she would spend hours searching for it. I think she genuinely loves this job.”

"She loves her work? Then I'll do that."

With the front firmly ahead, Risome carried on, seemingly set on his course.

Through the deserted picture book section, straight to the loan counter.

The reliable sister—Uehashi Hikari—lifted her head from the computer and exclaimed warmly:

“Arisa… You’re all right?" This was different from the question at school Yayo asked.
"Are you okay?" — This question held several unnecessary emotions. Sympathy for the loss of a loved one, the politeness of an adult, interest in the case, and a hint of hostility — perhaps she had already been questioned about the situation regarding "The Planet of the Key Country." Arisa could not answer and could only nod in silence.

However, Risome was indifferent to such an atmosphere: "I think I should ask if you’re okay. You looked quite unwell that day."

"Yes. I'm fine... you can't stay down forever."

"That's great. Are you busy now? Not too busy? Then let's talk."

He leaned one arm on the counter and started a chat that was far from ordinary small talk. 

"The day before yesterday, you entered the library with Mr. Nasu, right? Around seven thirty in the morning?"

"Yes. I happened to meet Mr. Nasu on my way to work."

"Is the early shift usually at that time?"

"Yes. Regular librarians start at eight thirty, while the early shift starts an hour earlier."

"However, the day before yesterday wasn't supposed to be your early shift. Why did you come in so early?"

"Because I forgot to return 'The Last Picture of Man' that I restored the night before to the archive... I just couldn't let it go. Who would have thought that book would be used as a murder weapon and couldn't be returned?"

"Just wanted to return a book to the archive as soon as possible. You came an hour early just for that reason? You're so admirable, truly a model librarian. I'll have to learn from you, right?"

He sought Arisa's opinion. Arisa nodded, saying, "Yes, yes." Uehashi hesitated, but Risome interjected swiftly, "By the way, you wear glasses, right?"

"Isn't it obvious?"

She chuckled and said, "It's really due to age; staring at books all year round has deteriorated my eyesight. Only Mr. Nasu doesn't wear glasses; the rest of us, without glasses, can't see words thirty centimeters away...”

"Yes, others may be like that, but your glasses have no prescription."

Uehashi froze, touching her glasses frame with her fingers. Arisa was stunned, looking at the expression of the female librarian and then at the smiling Risome.

"When I met each of you in the children's section the day before yesterday, I observed everyone. For those wearing prescription glasses, when tilting their heads slightly, the light refracts due to the convexity of the lenses, causing subtle distortion in the facial outline through the lens. You can clearly see this outline distortion in Ms. Nariki, Mr. Teramura, and Mr. Koyama, suggesting they all wear glasses with quite strong prescriptions. However, your outline showed no distortion whatsoever, even when observed at such close range. This means your glasses have no prescription; they're what you call non-prescription decorative glasses.”

Arisa stared intently at Uehashi's face, which indeed did not appear to have a prescription, though she had never noticed until now.

"If it's for fashion, this frame is too plain, and wearing them at work all the time is a bit strange. You know that wearing glasses makes you seem 'more professional.' You've left a deep impression on readers and colleagues: an intellectual, smart, and book-loving beautiful librarian."

He stopped speaking, seeming to await the other's reaction. Uehashi removed her glasses and glared coldly at Risome. Even without glasses, she was beautiful.

"You talk quite awkwardly for a high school student."

"It's exactly because I'm a high school student that I speak awkwardly."

"My glasses are indeed non-prescription. But what's wrong with that? There are thousands of people wearing decorative glasses in this world, so there's probably no reason to criticize me."

"That's quite right. However, the incident is making me think in such awkward ways. Your intellectual and book-loving image is a calculated performance. Since that's the case, you might not be as devoted to your work as people imagine. Thus, when you arrived early at work that morning when the body was discovered, it is possible it wasn't just to return a book to the archive."

Uehashi's face turned pale, followed by a flush of shame. She wanted to speak, but at that moment, Mr. Teramura appeared from the door behind her, preventing her from refuting further. The female librarian stood up abruptly, holding her glasses in her hand, and left straight away, disappearing behind the door as if avoiding further questioning. 

Mr. Teramura watched Uehashi walk past him and then turned to say: "Hey, aren't you the one who came with the detectives the day before yesterday... you too, Arisa."

This tall man didn't ask, "Are you okay?" like Uehashi did; instead, he comforted Arisa with a look of gentle sympathy. Still, Risome spoke indifferently: 

"Mr. Teramura, you came at just the right time. I have a couple of questions I’d like to ask you, is that okay?"

"Sure, I'm quite free today."

Mr. Teramura opened the printer cover while agreeing, seemingly changing the ink cartridge. 

"By the way, I didn't notice the day before yesterday; you seem to come here often, right?"

"You know pretty well."

"You live nearby?"

"I rent a place nearby."

Risome answered cooperatively and then got to the main point: 

"On Monday, when the incident occurred, after closing, the librarians had a meeting until eight, right? Was this meeting scheduled in advance?"

"Yes. We have meetings every Monday."

"Has it always been like this?"

"We’ve had this habit for about two or three years."

"What time do meetings usually end?"

"They usually end around eight, which is why I'm always home late on Mondays."

"Librarians’ work is tough as well. By the way, how long is the shortest time it takes to retrieve a book from the archive?"

"The archive?... No matter how quickly, it takes at least ten minutes. The archive is large, and retrieving a book also requires filling out a loan slip and signing, a process that’s quite a hassle. You want to read a book from the archive?"

"No, not at all."

"You ask questions without logic."

"My mind has even less logic than this. One more question, where’s Mr. Koyama now?"

"He should be on the second floor."

"Thank you!"

Risome bowed and left the counter. Mr. Teramura pushed up his chain-attached glasses puzzledly, watching him leave.

Arisa thought he would head to the second floor but unexpectedly returned to the children's section. Even following behind him, Arisa couldn't see the logic in his mind now.

"Risome, what are you investigating?"

"Various things."

"Various things... it sounded like you suspect Ms. Uehashi from what you said to her just now."

"It's not just a suspicion."

Risome replied curtly. So, he truly was suspecting her?

"But can coming to work early be used as proof alone?"

"I know. I was just probing her. I actually have more conclusive evidence to suspect Uehashi."

The two of them quickly walked through the children's section, returning to the reading room. Risome stopped before the bloodstain from earlier, checking his phone's timer. About ten minutes had passed since it started. He squatted down on the carpet, rubbing the leftmost bloodstain hard with his finger, just as he had ten minutes ago.

The blood had soaked into the carpet entirely, leaving barely anything on his fingers. He scrubbed hard with a handkerchief, yet the bloodstain didn't blur.

Chaos in the Library
National Literature "Authors Starting with 'Mo'" Shelf
The shelf, largely free of the incident now, had the scattered books put back in place, the blood-stained carpet replaced anew, and naturally, no sign of the corpse. Yet, the bouquet standing alone in front of the shelf solemnly told the story of a young man brutally killed. It was a bouquet of white gazanias, whose flower language was "mourning a lost friend."

But the detective, with clouded eyes, didn't stop in front of the shelf, nor did he glance at the bouquet. He walked straight towards the bookshelf.

Mr. Lennon, aka Taku Koyama, was beside a shelf at the far end of the second floor. Together with Director Nariki, he was organizing history books on an orange little cart. When Arisa and the others approached, the two stopped their work. Nariki spoke first:

"Arisa Jomine."

"Mmm, yes."

"I heard that Kyouko sneaked your novel into the library's collection, and it has been there for nearly a month. The detectives told me about this in the morning."

Her tone brimmed with reproach.

"Removing a book from the collection is one thing, but bringing a nonexistent book in is unheard of. You came so many times during the summer for this reason. Were you two mocking us for not discovering the fake book?"

"No, no, that's not it..."

"And now this implicates a murder case... Do you know how much trouble this has caused us?"

Having expressed her hysteria, Nariki quickly left. Her gray bob and wrinkle-ridden face resembled a genuine witch.

Arisa was at a loss for words. She understood that Nariki getting angry was legitimate since they were indeed at fault. If the book related to the case, it was because of Kyouko's own doing. However, when a librarian she always admired uttered the word "trouble," she felt a pain in her heart as if gouged out.

"I apologize!" For some reason, Mr. Koyama apologized to her.

"Director Nariki, being the person in charge, has faced much hardship due to this case... We don't mind at all about the book. Director Nariki isn't indifferent to Kyouko's death; she was the one who laid the flower."

"Yes, it's just as well she left."

An unaffected spectator, Risome, moved a step closer to Mr. Koyama and said:

"Actually, I have something I'd like to say to Mr. Koyama alone."

"Alone... about what?"

"You were the one who gave the rear door's night-time password to Kyouko, weren't you?"

Upon hearing this abrupt statement, Arisa forgot her recent bewilderment and looked at him. His tone was as casual as if talking to a friend, but his smile was absent from his lips.

Mr. Koyama held a book he grabbed from the shelf and met Risome's eyes. He didn’t flinch, unlike Hikari Uehashi, though deep within his round glasses, his eyes emitted a powerful gaze.

"Me? Why? Is it because the information left at the scene points to me?"

"You've heard of the information left there, huh."

"The detectives mentioned it to me today. But I'm not the culprit."

"Yes, I think so too, yet it was you who gave him the password."

The artistic librarian said no more words.

"Let me explain it step by step. Kyouko was murdered in the library after it was closed. How did he, who couldn’t know the nighttime password, manage to enter the library then? I initially thought someone opened the door for him from inside, or a password-knowing person entered the library with him. Nonetheless, I was wrong. Fingerprints proved it."

"Fingerprints?"

"I’m referring to the password keypad's protective cover's fingerprints. Kyouko's fingerprints are on the protective cover. Regardless of whether someone opened the door for him or someone came with him inputting the password, it was entirely unnecessary for Kyouko to touch the keypad's protective cover. So, since his fingerprints are on the protective cover, it implies he entered the library alone, entering the password himself. The doors from the office to the open area also carry Kyouko's fingerprints, with no traces of the culprit’s touch, reinforcing this deduction. Kyouko was first in the library and, as he opened the protective cover and inner doors, not shutting them afterward meant the later arriving killer didn't have to touch those parts. 

So if Kyouko came alone, how did he get the password?”

Risome demonstrated lavish gestures before asking in a challenging manner. Mr. Koyama slowly pushed up his glasses and said:

"The killer must have been the one. It was the killer who told Kyouko the password to let him infiltrate the library."

"For what purpose?"

"Purpose... Something perhaps unspeakable. Hasn’t he already been murdered?"

Mr. Koyama said casually and then uncomfortably glanced at Arisa, perhaps realizing only then that he ought to speak cautiously before the victim’s family.

"But this conflicts with the witness testimony."

“Witness testimony?”

“Kyouko left the house once on Monday evening around seven, mentioning heading to the station nearby. Shortly after seven, someone saw him wandering on the road south of the library. He was obviously looking for an opportunity to enter the library. This suggests he didn’t know the librarians’ off-duty schedule. Those knowing the night-time password should know or specify Monday evenings after meetings, librarians wouldn’t get off until post-eight, including the newly dismissed Kuwajima. If any of these personnel ordered or lured Kyouko to intrude into the unmanned library, they would certainly specify post-eight as the time, explicitly informing Kyouko that librarians don’t leave until then. And if there’s an unspeakable purpose, they would emphasize this all the more, fearing that if Kyouko infiltrated pre-shift end, the covert operation would have failed. So his trying to enter an hour before librarians left seems quite unnatural.”

Listening by the side, Arisa agreed with this notion. Although hearing about fingerprints and witness testimony for the first time, assuming these facts stand, it seemed unlikely Kyouko would be called upon by someone else. 

“Kyouko, unaware of the librarian-off times, entered the library alone. That indicates he discovered the password on his own accord, entering the library proactively. This night-time password was for librarians only, typically with limited entry chances. I doubt he had any window to glimpse it; he needed someone to inform him. So who could he ask? If I were him and had such an unreasonable request, I’d ask the closest person I could consider reliable. That would be—”

Risome didn’t complete the sentence but pointed his finger at the man in front.

Mr. Koyama remained unperturbed: 

“Ultimately, the precision of reasoning seems to have lessened indeed. Kyouko did very possibly inquire about the password, but to say it had to be me…”

“I’ve heard he told you, ‘for sure today, by all means.’”

"Huh?"

“It was Monday afternoon, when you two had a talk. He reportedly asked you for something, and you agreed, saying ‘I don’t mind,’ to which Kyouko said, ‘Then please, by all means today...’ I asked Arisa what you talked about, and she said Kyouko explained, wanting a library book retrieved. “However, the issue lies hereafter. As Arisa mentioned, Kyouko and she went to the second floor, exchanged a few words with friend Akashi, and then promptly left the library. Going to the second floor, briefly chatting, and leaving – even in leisurely motioning, it wouldn’t exceed five minutes. Thus, Kyouko left the library within five minutes of parting with you. Yet I discerned, retrieving a book from the library takes at least ten minutes. And since Kyouko supposedly wanted the book ‘by all means that day,’ him departing without retrieving it seems implausible. In conclusion, he deceived his cousin and wasn’t asking you for a book but another thing.”

Under Risome's constant scrutiny, Mr. Koyama finally exhibited a flustered expression. Arisa, learning of Kyouko's deception, also fell into confusion — indeed, if seeking a loan, leaving swiftly seemed peculiar. Moreover, she suddenly came to a realization.

Generally speaking, there’d be no reason for Kyouko to lie to her. 

There must have been something weighing on his conscience. 

The history book in Koyama’s hand dropped to the floor, producing a heavy thud. The hefty book rolled to Risome’s feet, stopping cover-side-up.

The librarian leaned back on the bookshelf behind him with a long sigh: 

"I knew this would be found out someday. Just surprised it was you."

“You admit it?”

“Yes. I was indeed the one who gave Kyouko the password... No, Arisa, it wasn’t that. Just as he described, it was Kyouko who implored me for it.”

Mr. Koyama explained, like trying to win back the retreating Arisa.

“That happened Monday afternoon. I was working in the open area, and Kyouko came to me earnestly saying...

‘To write my report, I wish to use reference books in the dictionary section. However, I have something to attend to shortly and can't return before closing. The dictionary section books are all non-circulating, and there’re too many books I want to use. I wanted to ask if you could find a way for me to access the library after closing; would that be possible?’”

“Then you told him? Succumbing to this so easily?”

“I refused him at first, of course."
However, he repeatedly pleaded, and I thought the topic might be extremely important to him, so I felt compassion... I agreed, and it happened that Arisa was there at the time."

Arisa remembered. The two people whispering, Kyoujo seemed surprised when he heard her greeting and turned around, and his response was half a beat slow. Meanwhile, Koyama appeared to be contemplating something.

When he said, "Does it have to be in our library?" he meant the project had to be done in the library after closing hours. "I don't mind," was his response when he agreed to give out the password.

"If it were another reader, I would never tell. But—"

"You believed Kyoujo Jomine was trustworthy."

Hearing Risome say this, Koyama nodded painfully:

"I thought, as long as he couldn't freely use the archives and the computer, just entering the open stack area wouldn't be a problem."

"What happened after your conversation ended?"

"When I reached the borrowing counter, Kyoujo came down from the second floor. In the chaos of handling the borrowing procedures, I wrote the password on the back of the borrowing slip with a red pen and tucked it in the book I handed to him. It read, 'Press "Enter," 251026... I never dreamed something like this would happen at the time."

"Did you tell anyone else about giving him the password?"

"I haven't told anyone else. This is the first time I've brought it up with you."

"Why did you keep silent?" Arisa couldn't help but ask.

Koyama listlessly gazed elsewhere and lowered his head, saying, "Disclosing the password, letting unrelated people enter, and getting involved in a murder case are valid reasons for dismissal. I still have a family..."

The man who was now murmuring his defense had already lost his air of mystique. He was no longer the detached-from-the-world librarian, but merely a timid small-town citizen lamenting his failure and worrying about his family.

"It's alright, Mr. Koyama. I won't tell anyone besides the police. Actually, compared to figuring out who the murderer is, who gave him the password is a minor issue."

Risome comforted, making Koyama's expression grow even uglier, "I'm not the murderer." 

"I think so too. If you were the murderer, you wouldn't have left the information just lying around the scene. In my view, the murderer..." Risome bent down as he spoke, intending to pick up the book Koyama had dropped.

He suddenly halted. 

A peculiar moment as if performing mime. Risome remained in a crouched position, his hand just touching the book, petrified, not even blinking. Five seconds passed, ten seconds passed, and when Arisa and Koyama began to exchange anxious glances, he finally stood up. This time, his black eyes darted back and forth between Arisa and Koyama's faces.

"What's wrong?"

"It's nothing... This is yours. Please work hard!"

Risome handed the book back to the librarian and abruptly turned to walk towards the passage. His steps were staggering as if sleepwalking, and he muttered strangely to himself, "That's right, that's how it is... I overlooked... corroborating evidence of the blood stain... but the suspect... it's not confirmed yet... have to wait until tomorrow..."

"Risome, are you alright?" 

"Huh? Oh, I'm fine. No problem, quite smooth."

Upon hearing her speak, Risome replied lightly, as if waking from a dream, but he didn't look alright. Perhaps what Yayoi saw in the classroom when she worried about him was a sight like this.

The two headed to the stairs, their pace slower than when they arrived.

"Say, about what Mr. Koyama mentioned earlier... that Kyoujo said he wanted to know the password to write a report at the library at night..."

"Kyoujo did have stationery and books in his backpack, but isn't the university still on vacation? There couldn't be a report due on that day. Moreover, he told Koyama that he couldn't stay until the library closed because of something, but in fact, he was reading at home all along.”

"Then..."

"He's lying."

Risome coldly stated.

"What was his true intention?"

"We don't know yet. But... it might be related to your book."

He stopped at the foot of the stairs, looking at Arisa's face. His black eyes held nothing, yet Arisa felt as if her inner self had been seen through, experiencing a sense of pressure.

Upon reaching the first floor, they encountered two men entering through the automatic doors. One was carrying a gray jacket under his arm, while the other held a familiar notebook. Arisa recognized them both; they were Detective Sendou and Detective Hakata, who had visited her home yesterday.

"Hello!" Hakata greeted Risome and, glancing at Arisa beside him, asked, "Got a new girlfriend?"

"Uh-huh. Your sister makes too many demands."

"Demands? What do you mean? What demands?"

"Cleaning the room."

Only five seconds into the conversation, the detective was already flustered, while Risome remained expressionless. Arisa vaguely sensed their superior-subordinate relationship... Right, this person shared the same last name as that first-year girl. "Your sister"—could they be siblings?

More importantly, he just mentioned "girlfriend."

"Yes, I've got a question for the detectives."

"If you're not reporting you’ve discovered something before we have, I’m happy to hear it."

"Never mind then."

"You discovered something?"

"Yep. Have a chat with Mr. Koyama, you’ll find a fun story." Detective Sendou reluctantly nodded, regaining his police demeanor, and turned to Arisa, saying, "I read the email Risome sent. You saw someone resembling Kuwajima Nobuo, right? I've set up a search team in your neighborhood. We'll arrest any suspicious individuals as soon as they're spotted. Rest assured."

"Th-thank you. Sorry, I'm not sure if I really saw him clearly."

"It's alright, whether accurate or not, providing sighting information on Kuwajima Nobuo is very useful."

"Haven't gathered any information on him yet?" Risome asked. The recovered-from-chaos Detective Hakata flipped through his notebook and said, "Apparently, he stayed at a nearby net café yesterday and the day before, but we don't know where he is now... and he hasn't returned to the apartment either."

"No worries about Kuwajima Nobuo for now," said Sendou. "I'm inclined to agree with your opinion from yesterday. It's likely that the murderer who killed Kyoujo isn’t Kuwajima, but someone else."

"You found something?" 

"Thanks to you." Detective Sendou replied sarcastically and looked around with his long eyes. Librarian Teramura at the borrowing counter was leaning forward, seemingly eavesdropping. The detective inclined his head and led the group to the vacant bunko section.

Then, turning to speak to Risome, he asked, "Have you read Tetsuya Ayukawa's 'The Kamakura Suspense Guide'?"

"The detective took a different perspective on the death message's 'く', seeing it could also be read as the letter 'L', and noticing that 'L' is circled, possibly pointing to the first letter of 'light', as in Koyama Light's name. 'Light' translates to Hikari in Japanese, which might suggest librarian Uehashi Hikari. He also recalled that on the day the body was discovered, she wasn't scheduled for the morning shift yet arrived early. There were many suspicious points. If you're thinking that, I'm afraid you're making a mistake."

The chief officer's mouth froze on 'The Kamakura Suspense Guide', producing an airy sound, then his lips began to twitch.

Hakata glanced awkwardly at his boss and asked, "Did you think this too?"

"I thought of it the moment I saw the death message. But it's too foolish, so I dismissed it. Initially, the Wright Brothers' 'wright' and 'light' aren't even spelled the same."

Risome delivered a metaphorical blow to the detective, who was left speechless before he continued, "But detective, honestly, I was tracking the Uehashi line just now, though not based on the death message."

"What was your basis?"

"The utility knife."

"Utility knife? The one in the pocket?"

"Yes. However, five minutes ago, another issue emerged. And now, I am completely confused."

Both detectives tilted their heads in the same direction.

"You mean Uehashi Hikari isn't the murderer?"

"She seems to be hiding something, but logically, for some reason, another person keeps coming to mind."

"Who?"

"Mr. Koyama."

"Koyama? Why him? Didn't you say the death message is meaningless the day before yesterday…"

"Yes. But that's all I can think of now… Detective, don't take this too seriously. It's not confirmed yet. Honestly, I'm all mixed up at this point."

Risome shrugged, leaned back against the bunko bookshelf, and casually picked up a collection of Hoshi Shinichi's stories, flipping through them. Detective Hakata tapped his pen on the notebook, and Detective Sendou rubbed the back of his neck like wiping sweat. The three were all in a fog.

A few seconds later, the silence was broken by someone shouting, "Detective!"

Masato Nasu dashed over from the children's book section.

"I… I just found a bloodstain in the corner of the carpet in the reading room! Could it be related to the case?"

"Relax, Mr. Nasu! It’s not human blood, it’s pig blood."

"Oh… huh?"

"The experiment is still ongoing, please don't touch it until tomorrow. Goodbye!" Risome handed Nasu the bunko book he'd just read, waved to the detectives, and headed towards the automatic door. Arisa quickly followed, always one step behind in action.

Stepping out the automatic door, they were met with the afternoon sun. The air conditioning in the library had been effective, and the temperature difference made the heat feel even more intense. Risome took a sip of the remaining water in his bottle and groaned, "It's warm!"

"There's a soba place behind us, right?"

"Yes. I've been a few times, it's good."

"Cheap?"

"Average."

"Let's have lunch there, take a break. I'm tired of talking, and I want to confirm Kyoujo's sighting information too."

"Um... huh? The two of us?"

"One is fine, three is fine too."

Risome spoke casually as he headed for the shade of the trees. Arisa used her hand as a fan, fanning her face.

Lunch. With Risome. It's fine. There's nothing wrong. But what should I do? What to talk about? Will it be awkward? Right, I should talk about books. About the book from yesterday. Luckily, I finished it yesterday. The main characters—what were their names again?

They walked out of the library yard towards the soba place, passing by a vending machine. On the night of the incident, the spilled apple soda seemed to have lost completely to the sun and dried up completely.

---

Students pouring out from the main gate, despite wearing short-sleeved uniforms, appeared rather heavy.

The boys wore gray T-shirts with tight-fitting collars, while the girls wore dark blue sailor uniforms. Hair, shoes, and school bags were all uniformly black. This group of seemingly brilliant children lined up to head for the bus stop. Inside the gate was a modern-style school building that could be directly placed on a brochure. The columns were engraved with standard script "Hiten Academy Junior High," glistening as if polished daily. Indeed deserving to be the top school in the prefecture, it greatly differed from the relaxed style of Kazekozan, even though they were only junior high students.

Yuzuno, dressed in a white overcoat, was somewhat tense and restrained, huddled under the shade of a roadside tree. She used an English reference book to cover her face, to avoid being seen, while she waited for the other party to arrive. Ten minutes past the agreed time, the other person still hadn't shown up. Perhaps a less conspicuous meeting spot should have been chosen.

Occasionally, running sports team members chanted slogans as they passed by her view. Only this aspect, identical to the familiar school scenery of Yuzuno's, provided her a sense of relief. The girls team donning caps were likely the softball team. The taller girls following them seemed to be high school students attending classes at the opposite school building. Their uniforms were a gradient of red, paired with black shorts.

"Oh!"

She had seen them before. Mainly during the Kanto district preliminaries, in table tennis magazines, and at the old gymnasium during the summer break.

Those were the uniforms of the girls' table tennis team.

"Oh?"

Someone in the team saw Yuzuno and stopped. It was a shapely girl with long hair tied at the back, limbs extending gracefully from the uniform—a beautiful, handsome girl with androgynous charm.

"Shinjiritsu-san..."

Yuzuno quickly tucked the reference book into her bag and became instantly respectful. 

"You’re from the Sugawa team, right? Your name is… um..."

"Hakata... Hakata."

"Oh, right, right. Hakata-san. I played against you in the last match."

She recalled and nodded. Truthfully, just this gesture already made Yuzuno happy. 

Choko Shinjiritsu.

Hiten Academy's girls' table tennis team was widely known as a strong team. This second-year student was the ace player. Undoubtedly the Kanto region's top national-level player. To Yuzuno, she was like a transcendent being. During the summer, when playing a friendly match at Kazekozan, Yuzuno unexpectedly had the chance to compete against her. Although the game ended in a complete defeat, she seemed to remember Yuzuno because of it.

"What are you doing here?"

"Waiting for someone..."

"Waiting for someone? Haha, I thought you were here for reconnaissance."

She casually uttered such a terrifying thought. Reconnaissance on an opposing school? It’s not some comic book. Or does she often get targeted for reconnaissance herself?

"Sugawa's doing well, right? But without asking, I know she's fine."

"Yeah, she's good. She's quite motivated, aiming to get revenge on Shinjiritsu-san."

"That's excellent. That makes defeating her all the more meaningful."

"I... I'll pass it on to her."

Her confident lack of modesty was overwhelming. Shinjiritsu evaluated Yuzuno, just like when opposing each other in a match. Yuzuno reflexively covered her left arm. She felt as if Shinjiritsu could see through her to the other end, to Captain Sugawa.

Shinjiritsu considered Sugawa Nao from Kazekozan as a rival—which was notably well-known throughout the county. Objectively speaking, Shinjiritsu indeed had the upper hand in skill, but a personality clash mixed with incompatible play styles seemed to make Sugawa Nao her most challenging opponent inwardly. During the aforementioned friendly match, she parachuted in to compete specifically against the captain. Eventually, Shinjiritsu barely won. Nonetheless, this result seemed to add fuel to the fire.

"Choko! No slacking off!" 

Someone leisurely reminded her from the side. Shinjiritsu turned around and responded, "Oh, Otoha!" Approaching her was another girl in a red uniform, gentle and graceful. One must not be fooled by her seemingly dull appearance. She was the second-year ace Todori Otoha, equally famous as Shinjiritsu. No wonder it was a strong school, with powerful players emerging one after another.

"The coach will kill you~"

"I ran into someone I know. You go ahead, I'll catch up."

"You’re dodging me again~"

Todori said in a prolonging drawl before continuing toward the distance. The aura Shinjiritsu exuded must have pressured even the senior students. Probably only she could converse with Shinjiritsu without trepidation—even if you excluded Captain Sugawa.

When Shinjiritsu waved at her friend, Yuzuno noticed a bandage wrapped around her left elbow.

"Shinjiritsu-san, your elbow..."

"Hmm? Oh, it’s just bandaged, not injured. I'm developing a new technique."

"A technique?"

"A kind of magic ball, I suppose."

Even as she said this, Shinjiritsu maintained her smile. Indeed, she was far removed from reality.

"Oh, okay." Yuzuno replied helplessly.

"By the way, the person you're waiting for, who is it? A guy?"

"No, it’s..."

"Hakata-san!"

Speak of the devil, the person she was waiting for emerged from the main entrance. 

"Sorry to keep you waiting! I stopped by the clubroom, so it took some time."

A petite girl in a dark blue sailor uniform. Her shoulder-length hair fell from behind her ears, with a musical note accessory on her rubber band, standing out in a crowd of plain-styled students.
Her slender arms and translucent skin, along with uniquely charming eyes, were the only things appearing mature amid her youthful features. Yet this girl—Kyouka Risome’s elegant face twisted extremely at the very moment she noticed Choko Shinjiritsu: 

"Hey! Oh, Choko Shinjiritsu!" Choko also announced her full name: "Kyouka Risome!" with a rather displeased expression.

"What are you doing here?"

"That's my question. What are you doing at the middle school's entrance? Are you regretting your foolish actions thus far and planning to start over from compulsory education?"

"I thought about it, but I gave up. I'd rather die than restart in the same school building as you! Aren't you with the student council's errand person today?"

"Princess Mari is the head of the errand team. Your grades are quite good, yet why can't you remember no matter how many times I tell you?"

The two seemed to be at daggers drawn. Then, Shinjiritsu asked Yuzuno:

"Hakata-san, is this the girl you were waiting for?"

"Yes, I was."

"I'm not sure what your relationship with her is, but it's best to be wary," Shinjiritsu whispered in Yuzuno's ear, "there are a lot of yellow rumors about her!"

"You should at least say black rumors!"

"So you admit you're a dark one?"

"Just not as much as you, senpai."

This time, the sound of a gun’s trigger being pulled could almost be heard. Before Yuzuno could understand the situation, the two had simultaneously stopped paying attention to each other. It seems their relationship wasn't just bad.

Disappointed, Shinjiritsu bid farewell to Yuzuno, "Then I'll be off."

"Hakata-san, please pass a message to Sugawa: next time we meet, it'll be a sight to behold!"

She tapped her bandaged elbow, leaving behind a provocative smile. The strongest girls' table tennis team member from the Kanto region sprinted off at a pace that would truly catch up with her companions.

"That woman, really!" Kyouka grumbled, "Hakata-san, you won't believe a word she says, will you? Ever since last year, for some reason, she’s treated me as an eyesore. Could it be she twisted psychologically due to the loss of her queenly throne?"

"Kyouka, are you a queen?"

"Of course not. Rather, I’m a slave, to you, Hakata-san," she said with a smile.

However, Yuzuno couldn’t recall ever signing such an agreement with her.

"Let's not talk about that. It really has been a long time since we've seen each other."

"Oh, has it been long? Maybe not that long? A month?"

"For me, that's already quite a while. Let's move quickly."

With those words, Kyouka leaned on Yuzuno and linked arms with her. For some reason, Yuzuno could hear the sound of handcuffs clinking. This scene was even more conspicuous than before, but they decided to move forward first.

"Where should we go? Hakata-san, are you hungry?"

"No, not really."

Yuzuno and Sanae, who had been waiting loyally at the station, had already eaten Mos Burgers.

"I'm not really hungry either, so how about we have something to drink? There’s a nice traditional teahouse near the national university."

"Traditional teahouse…" Another rather elegant term.

"But I'm sorry for making you come all the way to my school. It’s so hot, you must be tired, right?"

"No, no, I took the bus to get here."

"Really? How did you pay? PASMO card or Suica card?"

"The price wasn’t high, so I paid cash."

"Are you in the middle of exams? Sorry! I didn’t know and trouble you with an email out of the blue."

Kyouka exclaimed in a panic.

Yuzuno's mouth gaped open. Clearly, she hadn't specified in her email that she was during exams, so—

"How did you know?"

"I saw something in your bag, inadvertently..."

Her face turned red as her eyes dropped to Yuzuno's arm, intertwined with her own, as well as the bag slung over Yuzuno's shoulder. When putting away the reference books, she hadn't entirely closed the zipper, so it was possible to glimpse inside. 

"Your wallet is under the English reference book. You got out your reference book after your wallet, didn't you? The city buses here require you to pay upon arrival. So if you used cash on the bus, then you definitely used your wallet before getting the reference book. So you must have looked at it while waiting at the main entrance. If it was just a vocabulary book, it wouldn’t matter, but to read such a thick reference book while standing—unless you’re exceptionally diligent. Thus, I thought you had exams. Your school uses a two-semester system, so it makes sense to have finals now."

"......"

"I’m sorry for not considering this."

Kyouka bowed her head apologetically. However, in Yuzuno’s eyes, her thought process wasn’t just inconsiderate; it was overthought.

"Kyouka, you really resemble your brother."

Hearing Yuzuno mumble this, Kyouka puffed her cheeks childishly and said:

"That doesn’t make me happy at all!"

The shop sign read "Tea House Red Chic."

This was clearly a privately-run café, converted from a ground-floor residence. The owner seemed to want to showcase a red-roof Western style, but given its small scale, it mainly evoked the image of a dollhouse. A sign reading "open" was hung on the door with diamond-shaped glass.

On entering, Yuzuno was greeted by the ringing bell, violin music, and the smell of coffee. The music seemed to come from a turntable on the counter. Decorated in reassuring shades of brown and scarlet, without other patrons present—only an elderly person was resting at a four-seater table—Yuzuno and Kyouka sat at a table for two by the window.

Upon hearing the bell, a young man who appeared to be a staff member came over from the back of the store. He seemed familiar with Kyouka, greeting her affectionately with "welcome!" Yuzuno flipped open the menu, served with cool water, and unsurprisingly, found coffee to be the main item. A single cup was as pricey as a Mos Burger, quite expensive.

"I’ll have an iced coffee. What about you, Hakata-san?"

"Okay, I’ll have the same then."

"I’ll take an iced mocha."

"Ah? Why the change?"

"My mind changed suddenly. One iced coffee, one iced mocha, please."

"Sure."

The young man, indifferent to their change, nodded and returned to the store's back. His movements in passing through the counter and adjusting the turntable needle were practiced.

"This place feels really nice."

"You like it?"

"Yeah. It feels reassuring, and the records have a charm," thought Yuzuno, while also thinking the staff was handsome, "Oh, is the shop's name derived from red records?"

"No, it’s supposed to mean 'red and chic.'"

"......"

Is this a joke? In any case, it's an unusual name.

"Kyouka, do you come here often?"

"Sometimes after school. Mostly just to rest."

"I heard Hiten Academy is quite strict—won’t you get in trouble wearing uniforms into a café?"

"Not if I don’t get caught."

Kyouka laughed carefree, indeed resembling Risome's take-no-concern attitude. Yet, there were subtle differences; even in a tea shop, her brother leaned more toward a manga café type.

"Shouldn't you be worrying about Hakata-san? Ignoring exams all together."

“Mm, hmm. It's mostly over, and I've been feeling cooped up." 

Unable to find an appropriate reason, she borrowed words her captain once used. Kyouka seemed to understand very well, her eyes sparkling, nodding repeatedly. Yuzuno, on her end, sipped water in quick, small gulps, trying to mask her unease.

"Thank you for waiting."

The young man returned with their drinks. The cool ice clinked lightly. A red apron, matching the shop's name, adorned with a pleasing smile matching its title. The iced coffee was translucent too. Yuzuno felt as if she were being served tea by a butler in a garden.

"Mm, delicious!"

"Isn't it?"

"Yes. Worth a Mos cheeseburger."

"Cheeseburger?"

"No, no, I was just rambling."

"Got it. Oh, I suddenly want to try the iced coffee too. Just a sip, alright?"

"Ah? Then why did you change just now?"

"A woman’s mind is as mercurial as a June sky."

"But that’s extreme weather… go on, have a sip."

"Thank you. In return, try my mocha."

"Thanks… ah, this is delicious too! What now? Shall we swap?"

"No need, I thought about it and mocha’s definitely best."

"Kyouka, your woman's mind has issues."

"Because it’s a June sky."

"More like the sky is falling..."

Amid unknown classical tunes, the two engaged in an odd conversation while savoring their coffee. Just a visit to a café, and Kyouka seemed extremely pleased. She sipped through the straw, showing a satisfied smile, occasionally offering Yuzuno a grin. Sunlight shone beautifully on her note ornament and eyes, making Yuzuno think she must be quite popular at school.

"You said earlier you went to your club room, Kyouka, which club are you in?"

"Choir. But I don’t sing, I accompany."

"You play the piano?"

"I learned."

Kyouka’s slender fingers danced gracefully along the table's edge, demonstrating to Yuzuno.

"But more than performing, I prefer writing lyrics… oh, right, to help Hakata-san understand me better, I brought this."

Kyouka opened her bag, solemnly placing a CD case on the table.

The cover illustration showed a girl with twin green pigtails holding a gun in front of ruins. A casual line was scribbled on the right: Etheric Polystyrene, presumably the band’s name.

"Kyouka, is this a band you like?"

"No, it's a band I've joined."

"Ah!?"

Yuzuno nearly spilled her coffee.

"We’re just quietly active online… I collaborate with people I met in online chat, composing songs and pairing them with animations using VOCALOID. This is a mini-album for online sales."

No wonder it seemed familiar; of course, the girl was the singing synth software's character.

"You compose the lyrics? That’s amazing!"

"Nah, it’s not a big deal."

Kyouka reddened but seemed to have eagerly awaited Yuzuno's compliment.

"This 'Etheric Polystyrene'—you familiar with them?"

"Sorry, I only know VOCALOID… are you popular?”

“Among certain circles," came the ambiguous reply. "Hakata-san, what music do you usually listen to?"

“Hmm, let’s see. My favorite is SUPERCAR.”

“Didn’t expect so retro! Then maybe you’ll like our songs too. Here, this is for you, please take it!"

Kyouka handed over the CD without waiting for Yuzuno’s response. The back of the case displayed song titles written by Kyouka:

Disposable Circuits Genocide and Coca-Cola Only You, Please Don’t Attend My Funeral When the Ocean is Called an Asshole, What is It Thinking? God’s Singer, Demon’s Audience Crash, Hallelujah

"Well?"

"Truly artistic—is this rock?"

"It probably counts as rock."

Yuzuno swallowed back the words she wanted to say: “Truly literary.”

"Actually, I'm writing a song now called ‘School’s End, Hell on Earth.’”

“Hell on Earth?”

"It’s about a girl in love."

A mysterious blush spread across Kyouka's face. What about this embarrassed her?

"I mostly keep it under wraps at school. If it gets out, they’ll be more upset than finding out about the café."

“Do Risome and Kaori know?”

"Of course. My brother made the cover drawing."

"Oh, I see. Your brother... huh?"

She exclaimed even more frantically than before:

"Your brother? Risome-san?"

"Yes. Sometimes he also draws animations. I'd say he does it upon my request. Sketches or drafts. You know how lazy he is; it takes forever to get him to do anything.”

Who knew Risome had such a talent? Now that it’s mentioned, the last time Kyouka went to Risome’s room, she did say: “The new song's almost done, I’ll need your help.”

"Has Risome always been good at this?"

"Yeah. In Hiten, he and Kaori ran unofficial club activities."

"Hiten? Risome and Kaori were in Hiten?"

"Yup, they were middle school students there. Later, they didn’t continue to the high school but chose to take exams for Kazekozan."

Kyouka’s quick response paid no heed to Yuzuno’s surprise. Yuzuno knew Risome and Kaori were middle school classmates but hadn’t realized they both went to Hiten. Then again, considering Kyouka studies at Hiten, this situation might indeed be normal.

"Didn't your brother mention it?"

"No, he didn’t."

Yuzuno's gaze fell again on the cover. The girl standing before ruins. The style was simple with minimal transformations, suggesting a neat, precise touch, more illustration than manga. The gap between the light watercolor style and the gun and ruined buildings created a peculiar atmosphere. It looked like a computer-generated image, crafted presumably using the computer in his room?

It wasn’t until she returned to her senses that she realized her jaw had dropped.

Indeed, she knew nothing about Risome.

Yuzuno put the CD in her bag, sat upright in the chair, and faced Kyouka, elegantly sipping her mocha:

"Kyouka."

"Yeah."

"Your father really doesn’t recognize your brother?"

She asked as if nothing were amiss. Kyouka didn’t show any wariness, only nodded slightly as if to say: Oh, it's that topic, and responded:

"I also don’t really know."

That response caught Yuzuno off guard.

"When I was in the first year of junior high—or when my brother was in his third year—it was likely in February. He hadn't returned home until late, and our father would have been late too. Apparently, our father returned alone around midnight and suddenly declared he would sever ties with my brother. As it seems. I was already asleep by then, so I deduced it the following morning."

Risome disappeared; the father came home and proposed cutting ties? Had something not occurred at home, but outside? 

“Mother had a violent argument with Father. A huge fierce argument. Although Father was exhausted, he stubbornly stuck to his position. A few days later, when my brother, who had suddenly returned home, said he was going to leave and wouldn’t budge. Ultimately, Father compromised, agreeing to let him become independent after moving on to high school. However, my brother seemed unwilling to continue receiving care from Father, leaving without even finding a place to live… I don’t know where he went. I had to ask Kaori to find out—"

"He’s in the school's activity room?"

"That sounds just like his useless-person style. Anyway, I informed Mother about the situation. But Mother has some quirks too, and the end result is that she secretly provides him living expenses each month without telling Father… sigh, it’s been this way up till now. That’s mostly what I know."

Kyouka shrugged and took a sip of her mocha. She genuinely didn't seem to be hiding anything. She recalled how Kaori once described Kyouka—

I only know the surface of that child.

"Kyouka, didn’t you ever think to ask why?"

Yuzuno pressed on. Removing her straw, Kyouka stared defiantly with a narrowed gaze:

“Look at you, only caring about my brother.”

“......”

Yuzuno stirred her ice cubes, brushing off the comment.

Silence fell between them across the table, and the background music mixed with hic and hic sounds, likely due to a worn-out record or misaligned needle.

Soon, in a tone of conceding defeat, Kyouka said dejectedly:

"Of course, I asked the reason, but both Father and my brother kept tight-lipped. I suspect they disagreed on an academic matter. Back then was indeed the time for exam preparation, and it seems Father wished my brother would remain at Hiten.”
Her brother was naturally stubborn, possibly just due to adolescent rebellion. Or, perhaps it was because of his very good friend... Oh, no, who knows if that's true or not." Kyouka hesitated. Her fingers wandered over the table, finally pinching the end of a straw.

“What about Risome’s friend?”

“No, there were strange rumors back then. I couldn't quite understand my brother's social circle…”

“Rumors?”

Kyouka gently lowered her head, as if regretting her slip of the tongue. Yuzuno watched her intently, waiting for her to continue. A chill spread from her fingers resting on the glass, while the noise from the record grew increasingly pronounced.

“His friend, attempted suicide.”

The sound of the violin abruptly stopped, as if it had run out of breath.

5. What the Black Missing from the White Screws Has

Just after six o'clock, they heard the sound of a key turning on the other side of the door.

Risome returned to the "castle" carrying a supermarket plastic bag and was startled to see the lights on inside. He quickly scanned his familiar "activity room with the door that wouldn't open," and after noticing the short-legged table with pens, open notebooks, and reference books, along with Yuzuno, he reacted just as she expected—by frowning.

“What are you doing?”

“Studying. English.”

“Is it going well?”

“So-so. The room is full of distractions.”

Risome seemed itching to speak, but held back. He put the grocery bag on the short-legged table and sat down across from Yuzuno, sighing in visible exhaustion.

“Have you been at the library all this time?”

“I wasn't there long. I escorted the chair of the library committee home and then went shopping, I'm exhausted.”

"Jomine-san? You escorted her home?"

"Just to be safe, because it seems Nobuo Kuwajima might be stalking her."

"I didn't expect you to be such a gentleman."

"'Didn't expect' is unnecessary,” Risome's brow furrowed more deeply, “and what about you, have you been here all along?”

"Yeah. Pretty much."

Yuzuno avoided his gaze and resumed her English exercises. She didn't want to tell him that she had been with his sister just a short while ago.

After that...

Kyouka, having said what she did, never mentioned the past again, and Yuzuno was unable to pursue it further. The waiter changed the jazz record, and they shifted the topic of conversation. They chatted idly until the ice in their glasses had melted completely. When saying goodbye and leaving the café, Kyouka said, "Next time, let me try on the Kazekozan uniform." Yuzuno worried about the size fitting, but Kyouka insisted it didn’t matter. She truly is a bit of an eccentric child.

On the way back, Yuzuno pondered Kyouka's words repeatedly on the swaying bus. Particularly the last sentence, which echoed in her mind, causing a sharp, stabbing pain in her chest each time she recalled it.

Attempted suicide. Is this true? If it is, what does it have to do with the severance of father-son ties? Yuzuno had assumed the issue was just a family dispute, but what lay beneath might be far more intricate.

In the end, all she gleaned was surface-level information. The truth behind why Kaori wanted to escape her middle school years remained shrouded.

But—

Yuzuno put down her mechanical pencil and looked at Risome. He was absent-mindedly munching senbei in a wooden tray.

“How's the library investigation going? Any new discoveries?”

He stared at Yuzuno with his dark eyes and said, “Are exams not important anymore?”

“I really want to know what the pig's blood was for. It’d be great if you could tell me.”

“The pig's blood is still under testing; we’ll only know final results by tomorrow. Apart from that, I've figured out how Kyouko Jomine got into the library.”

Risome, while chewing the senbei, languidly began recounting his findings: the figure Arisa had seen yesterday, the conversation with the library staff, Koyama’s secret, and his encounter with the detective. Finally, he summed it all up rather nonchalantly: “A dense fog.” Yuzuno was just as perplexed, though she found the detective's theory of connecting the death message to Hikari Uehashi quite intriguing.

“Is Uehashi-san not the culprit?”

“If you ask me, she's innocent. Even so, she certainly has suspicious behaviors. For instance, arriving early to return a book to the shelves—generally, even the most meticulous person wouldn't do that. She must have had another motive. If Uehashi were the culprit, her intention might have been to remove fingerprints she forgot to wipe clean or to hide evidence against her. However, under these circumstances, some things just don't add up. Uehashi arrived at the library at 7:30 in the morning, the same time as her usual shifts. That’s too risky. In fact, she coincidentally ran into Nasu, limiting her freedom. Why didn’t she come even earlier? Perhaps she overslept, but a criminal probably wouldn’t be that careless…”

“Could her target have been Nasu-san?”

“Ah?”

Yuzuno's casual remark altered the investigator's tone as he submerged in thought.

“You see, Uehashi-san and Nasu-san were hired at the library in the same year, they’re the same age, and both are single. Uehashi-san appearing at that time would match Nasu-san’s work hours. If so, doesn't the answer become simple? It’s possible Uehashi-san arrived early to create an opportunity to be alone with Nasu-san.”

“……”

“She might wear plano lenses for Nasu-san. She's appealing to his tastes, wearing them to get his attention.”

Risome, weary to the bone, slowly leaned over, collapsing onto the scattered manga.

“Was my guess too far-fetched, so far that it floored you?”

“Opposite,” came his voice from across the low table, “Yesterday, the detective pointed out a weak spot in me; it seems he hit the mark.”

“Weak spot?”

“Never mind, I’m just tired. From tomorrow, you'll solve the mystery, give your detective brother some advice. And then, go adopt a calico cat, black-white-brown.”

Why does he have to micromanage even the type of pet? Yuzuno sighed quietly, stood up, circled to the other side of the low table, placed her hands on her hips, and peered down at the back of Risome's head lying on the floor:

“You have keener insight than I do, Risome-kun.”

“I haven’t realized a thing.”

“Don’t sell yourself short, stir yourself up! Who’s the culprit?”

“Taku Koyama.”

“Koyama-san? So you're saying the death message is correct?”

“That’s the problem. I hadn’t noticed it, yet after going in circles, I realized its importance. I can't find the link between the case and the death message. Without it, I can't catch the true culprit. I still haven’t grasped anything…”

Risome turned toward her, as if in a dream, and suddenly stopped speaking. His head was at an awkward angle, gazing straight up at Yuzuno. Curious, Yuzuno followed his line of sight—

“Oh wow!”

Yuzuno kicked at his undefended abdomen. Risome let out a strange “Guh” sound, his back hitting the leg of the short table, and the wooden tray of senbei fell, bumping his head, leaving him floundering in agony like a fish on a hook. Yuzuno took the chance to hold down her skirt:

“What’s with the staring? What are you looking at?!”

“No, blame it on your poor positioning…”

Yuzuno wanted to take back her words; he really wasn’t the slightest bit gentlemanly.

“I told you not to stare!”

Risome groaned as he sat up, rubbing his head and stomach, casting wary looks at Yuzuno’s foot like a predator watching its enemy—

His eyes widened in an instant.

The next second, he was lying on the floor again. He crawled across on his stomach toward Yuzuno, as if trying to nestle between her legs.

“Whoa!”

Yuzuno forgot to kick him this time and stepped backward. She stumbled over the stacked DVDs, once more holding down her skirt. Risome, unconcerned, stood up, furrowing his brows, blinking as ominous thoughts crossed.

“Twice, twice, you actually tried a second time, really now, you, what are you up to?”

“Twice... right, twice. The number of times is crucial.”

“Oh, oh, you admit it? You’re a thought criminal? Are you aware of the seriousness?”

“I'm just a fool. Why would I make such an error?”

“Repenting is too late now! Turn around! This time, I’m kicking your butt!”

“But if he's innocent…”

“You’re not examining the color!”

“I'm not talking about you; I’m talking about the case!”

Risome roared at Yuzuno, who was yelling and arguing, and then fell silent. Yuzuno, unable to keep up with his pace, called out, disengaged, "What?"

The case? Speaking of the case, he meant the library homicide, right? Did he discover a new lead? But based on the situation just now, how did he uncover it? Can looking at a girl’s underwear boost reasoning skills? What kind of setting is that? But if true, whenever a case occurs, Yuzuno and Kaori... Ah, this is bad, my imagination is just too disgusting!

She shook her head to dispel the inappropriate thoughts. Risome ignored her, slowly raising his head. Rationality seemed to return to his eyes. He looked around the room as if he had just awoken and picked up the scattered snacks.

“You… you figured something out?”

“Opposite,” his reply echoed his earlier one, “nothing clear.”

“Because your head got damaged.”

“Because I found an obvious fact. Maybe I’m not far from the answer.”

Risome faintly smiled, put the wooden tray back on the short-legged table, then instead of returning to his previous seat, he positioned himself before Yuzuno’s spread-out study materials, grabbed a reference book, and began flipping through it in a flurry. Yuzuno shifted in confusion:

“Say, that’s my seat.”

“You have a writing test tomorrow, right? I’ll show you a few tips, as thanks.”

“Thanks? Not an apology?”

“Whichever counts.”

Risome popped the cap off a highlighter and began marking sections with yellow. He was adept, like a teacher, adeptly narrowing down the exam scope.

Yuzuno blinked at him, then glanced at the senbei tray and the DVDs she’d knocked over earlier, somehow breaking into a smile, just like when she’d seen Kyouka's mini-record.

He truly was an enigma. The scenery reflected in his eyes was still far out of her reach.

Nevertheless, she no longer felt anxious. She resolved herself when answering letters in the table tennis club's activity room. Directly questioning Risome and Kaori would only add to their troubles. It was best to investigate on her own for a time, until she reached a point where she could see the same vistas.

For even if it's a winding road, moving resolutely forward will only bring the destination closer.

"Then please, I’ll trouble you."

Yuzuno nodded lightly, sitting down next to Risome.

*

“There was no sign.”

“Yeah.”

“Was the witness report reliable?”

“Reliable. She said she thought it was around this time yesterday that she saw Nobuo Kuwajima outside her doorstep.”

“Thought? So she’s uncertain?”

“Yeah, that does seem the case.”

“Looks like we’re in for a useless effort…”

Sakiko Umeatama leaned back against the passenger seat, sipping a carton of soy milk. The electronic clock on the dashboard ticked slower than a glitch. The time for a shift was nowhere in sight.

Outside the windshield was just the street from the residential area. Arisa Jomine's house was in the middle of the block. Ahead, there was a police car, made to look like a regularly parked car. Shirato and colleagues from the detective division were inside, keeping watch. Umeatama’s partner was Yusaku Hakata from the prefectural police. The four officers surrounded their target, waiting for the suspect to appear.

But even after more than five hours since the operation began, there was still no sign of Nobuo Kuwajima. Nor were there updates from the officers monitoring his apartment, affirming his return.

Hakata's phone, placed above the dashboard, buzzed with a message. He glanced at the sender and said, “It’s from Risome.” Umeatama perked up:

“Ah? That student advisor? What does he say? What did he write?”

“I'll… I'll read it out to you, keep your eyes on the road... ‘Please re-investigate Taku Koyama, review his alibi, and if possible, interview his wife and daughter, I’m counting on you. Also, your sister will be home late tonight.’ …What? Home late? …Home late...”

Hakata started repeating like a malfunctioning robot, knocking his head against the steering wheel. Truly unreliable. Umeatama prodded his back with the empty soy milk carton to make him sit up straight.

“Does Advisor really think Koyama is the culprit?”

“Seems that way. Furthermore, it was Koyama who gave the password to the victim.”

“So the death message is accurate?”

“Indeed… But Risome himself mentioned before that the death message doesn’t carry any meaning.”

Umeatama had heard his reasoning at the time. Given a victim left a message, the area at his side should have been illuminated by a flashlight. Furthermore, since the flashlight wasn’t found at the crime scene, it must have been taken by the murderer. If that were the case, the murderer couldn’t have missed the information. She believed his rationale was concise and clear but admitted it also had holes.

“Is it possible Koyama didn't know about the role name ‘Koyama Light’? Thus, he didn’t realize the message pointed to him. Or perhaps he was in a hurry to escape, and so had to leave things as they were.”

“But that isn’t definite, is it?”

Hakata answered with a trace of retribution. 

“I can’t grasp what Risome is thinking, but I can assert one thing clearly, our ideas on the death message are only hypotheses, and based on hypotheses alone it’s impossible to determine...”

“Who the murderer is. Right?”

Umeatama rested her arm on the passenger door, supporting her cheek.

Oh, how vexing such a clue like the death message could be. Neither a detective's experience, scientific inquiry, nor logical thinking could tackle it effectively. It played them all like fools, this maddening case.

“If we could just manage to apprehend Kuwajima, things might come to light…”

Just as both sighed heavily and refocused their attention outside the car—

A man appeared on the opposite side of the street.

He was tall, with his cap pulled low, obscuring his eyes. Moving cautiously, he intermittently glanced up at the houses along the street, focusing on Arisa’s home. He wore a crumpled polo shirt on top, khaki casual pants below, and a pair of brown leather shoes.

When he walked beneath a streetlamp, the burn scar on his left cheek was clearly visible to all.

There was no longer a need to rely on radios for communication. Shirato and the others had already exited the vehicle across the street, closing in behind the man, cutting off his exit. Umeatama and Hakata exchanged glances, nodded, and got out of the car too.

The man appeared alert to his path being blocked and tried to turn back, but Shirato and the others closed in from behind, hemming him in. In the middle of the residential area's night street, four detectives gradually closed the gap between them and him. Everything was as silent as a mime.

“Are you Mr. Nobuo Kuwajima?”

Shirato took a step forward, breaking the standoff.

“We're police. There are some questions regarding the library case. Could you come with us?”

Though Kuwajima’s gaze was hidden, at least his heavy breathing was evident. He swung his head back and forth, looking from Umeatama’s group to Shirato’s, and then back the other way. With the movement, his feet shuffled as he looked for a way to escape.

Shirato took another step closer. The man's body tensed as he stepped backward, suddenly drawing a sharp breath and lunging toward Umeatama. She calmly grabbed the man’s arm, attempting to subdue him. However—

“Get out of the way!”

The former librarian, previously thought of as a mere bookworm, was unexpectedly strong. His forceful attack led Umeatama to lose her balance and fall toward the cement ground. As she mentally exclaimed, “Oh no!” the man and Hakata came into the periphery of her vision. The man was getting even more aggressive, striking at Hakata. It's over, he's going to get away—

Hakata swiftly locked the man's arm.

A blow to the chest, a restrain on the head, an arm wound around the neck, thrown backward, and the man was taken down to the ground.
Detective Umeatama stood up, the man was already pinned to the ground.

"Officer Umeatama, are you okay?"

"Yes, I'm fine... thank you!" Umeatama softly thanked with a voice lower than usual. Hakata, without a bead of sweat, was saying to Shirato, "This counts as obstructing the performance of official duties, right?" She thought to herself that this person seemed somewhat reliable after all and mentally awarded him fifteen extra points.

She scratched her cheek, trying to hide her embarrassment, and turned to look at the man groaning on the concrete ground. His hat had fallen off, revealing his head.

On the detained man—Nobuo Kuwajima's bald head—there were clumsily wrapped bandages and gauze.
**Day Four: English Writing, Japanese History, Health and Physical Education, Home Economics, Confessions**

1. Inclinations and Strategies

Chizuru Yatsuhashi adjusted the length of her mechanical pencil lead, preparing for battle.

Students began to gather in the large classroom of the second teaching building, ready to take the Mathematics II exam. Although they were still scattered at the moment, in ten minutes, nearly 160 students from Classes 1 to 4 would be seated orderly, writing their names on the answer sheets under the strict supervision of the math teacher, Mr. Kanyuki.

The only subject being tested in the large classroom was Mathematics II, with Mr. Kanyuki as the test maker. Although the students understood his intention to recreate the tension of entrance exams, the hassle of changing classrooms and the strict rules during the exam were not well-received. Conversations filled with self-deprecating remarks and bitter smiles about their misfortune could be heard everywhere.

However, for Chizuru today, this strictness was the most crucial.

She silently surveyed the classroom, using her eyes to capture her top-performing rivals. Kuramachi from Class 2 quietly reviewed his materials, while Nao Sugawa from Class 4 chatted with her table tennis teammates. Arisa Jomine, chair of the library committee, seemed unwell and stood alone by the window with a melancholy air. And then—

"Huh? I like the story of the little baby, and the one with the thick artsy vibe from a while back."

"The artsy vibe was a bit overdone. Anyway, I prefer the doorbell."

"What do you think of 'Byond'?"

"I haven't seen that yet."

Tama Risome chatted about topics unrelated to the exam as he entered the classroom with the newspaper club president.

He found his assigned seat marked with his exam number and, per the rules, left only his mechanical pencil and eraser on the desk, placing other items at the back of the classroom. He glanced at his watch but didn't sit down; instead, he walked out of the classroom. Chizuru knew he was going to the bathroom. She had been secretly observing him and keeping track for the past few days, so she was certain. Risome had a habit of going to the bathroom after the first class.

Chizuru exchanged a glance with the person sitting diagonally behind her. The short-haired girl, Rieko Nakamura, gave her a slight nod, as if to say, "I understand." Chizuru redirected her gaze to observe the area around Risome's seat again. If other students were present, it might have been a bit troublesome, but fortunately, there weren't any. His seat was quite inconspicuous, located toward the edge of the large classroom. This little maneuver was sure to succeed without a hitch.

Begin the plan.

Chizuru mentally recited as she casually stood up, following after Risome.

Since the gym incident in June, Chizuru had been subjected to Risome's antics. In August, not only did Risome force her to help apply for the swimming pool but also involved her in bizarre experiments, leaving her to clean up the aftermath. If she didn't change the situation, Chizuru's self-esteem could not bear it. She badly wanted to kick his shin and reclaim her lost position. So, Chizuru decided to enact a small revenge, with the stage being the end-of-Term exams after summer break, by taking away Risome's first-place standing.

However, what was infuriating was that this guy's scores were monstrous. Even if she scored full marks and tied for first, it wouldn't be considered a victory. Therefore, to lower her opponent's ranking, she needed to put in some effort. She came up with several thoughtful schemes, such as spreading a rumor he was cheating or giving him a dose of laxative. However, each one was troublesome and had a low success rate, so she abandoned them. Ultimately, Chizuru chose the simplest and most practical method.

The Mathematics II exam during the second period on the last day.

Mathematics II was suitable in every aspect. Firstly, it was the only subject in which Chizuru and Risome would take the exam in the same classroom. Secondly, the inflexible proctor established strict rules. The only items allowed on the desk were a mechanical pencil and eraser, or a black ballpoint pen. Other things like textbooks and pencil cases had to be placed at the back of the classroom and couldn't be touched during the exam. Kanyuki: wholehearted, with no deception. Last time, when a student's mechanical pencil lead unfortunately broke, he promptly ruled for a retake.

If that's the precedent, what would happen if Risome encountered the same situation?

The procedure was simple. During the break before the exam, Chizuru would call Risome out of the classroom (her investigation showed she wouldn't even need to call him out; he would go to the bathroom of his own accord). During this opportunity, Chizuru's collaborator would approach Risome's seat and remove all the leads from his pencils. Returning to his seat, Risome would never expect the leads to disappear, would he? By the time he realized it, the exam would already be underway. No matter how sharp his mind, it would be meaningless if he couldn't write anything. Helplessly pleading with Kanyuki, the decisive Kanyuki would refuse (Risome had already caught Kanyuki's attention due to his normally poor attitude in class, which was crucial to the plan’s success). Sitting at her remote desk, Chizuru would serenely work on the exam while enjoying the comedic tragedy, and the results announced in the coming days would show Chizuru with near-perfect scores firmly holding first place, while Risome, with zero in Mathematics II, would rank far below.

Minimal risk, maximum effect. This was a reasonable plan that aligned with Chizuru's aesthetics.

She hid behind the cabinet used for storing cleaning tools to observe her target.

Risome emerged from the men's bathroom, brushing past Miho Aizuki from the broadcasting station, then stood in the hallway talking to her. Who would have thought that such a gloomy guy could have such a wide circle of friends? About three minutes had passed since leaving the classroom; she wondered if Nakamura had succeeded.

Chizuru chose Rieko Nakamura from Class 4 as her collaborator because she was the easiest person to threaten among the students gathered in the large classroom due to her usual misconduct. Out late at night. Rumors of intimidating others. Even suspicion of involvement in the "fire extinguisher incident" in April—Chizuru, who used to be the vice president of the student council, was aware of several of her weak points, things other students didn't know about. Upon hinting at these when she caught her by the main gate yesterday, Nakamura agreed almost happily and without difficulty. She looked pretty on the outside, but inside she was a little devil. Manipulating such people was Chizuru's expertise.

Miho and Risome were still talking.

"Math B is difficult, so I'm quite worried about Math A too... If I could get into the top three, that would be great. But it's really hard."

"Are you aiming for the ticket too?"

"Because I like aquariums very much. Risome-kun, if you come first place, could you give me a ticket?"

"I can't just give it to you for free."

"As thanks, I'll give you the rights to direct the noon broadcast."

"I'd rather give it to you for free."

Miho Aizuki waved with a smile—the girl who once seemed so docile now seemed to have changed her character somewhat—and entered the women's bathroom. Risome walked this way. The trick was probably done, but to be safe, it was better to buy some more time.

"Tama Risome, can I talk to you for a moment?"

She greeted him as if it was nothing. Risome said "Oh" and stopped.

"How did you do on the tests?"

"Quite smoothly. So far, things are very much in line with the plan."

"You're quite confident," this infuriating guy, "well-deserved for being the top of the grade. Tell me your surefire strategy."

"I didn't do anything special. Identifying trends, formulating strategies. Spending time preparing for several days to avoid last-minute cramming."

"I see. After all, regardless of the exam, finding trends and discussing strategies is the most important."

"Yes. Whether it's an exam, or things beyond the exam, it's always like that."

His emphasis on the last part made Chizuru uneasy.

"What do you mean?"

"Back at the poolside in August, I knew you still had a fighting spirit to target me after school resumed. So, I took the initiative during the summer break."

"Took the initiative?"

"It’s obvious that regardless of what trouble you plan for me, you'll use a pawn. Not dirtying your hands is your style. However, the pieces you can manipulate after losing your authority are limited. Considering that this person should be easy for you to speak to, and easy to target me, the most suitable candidate would be someone of the same gender and grade. Among those people, the one whose weak point you know the most—although it is indeed strange, how coincidental it was that an aquarium ticket fell from my wallet during a romantic date, and they didn't notice."

"Wa...wait! What are you talking about?"

"It's nothing. Well then, let's both do well on the exam."

Risome, with the demeanor of the top student, said this and returned to the large classroom. Chizuru stood there dumbfounded, watching his departing figure.

What was he talking about just now? It was as though he had already discovered that Chizuru was threatening Rieko Nakamura. Taking the initiative, could it be—

No, it's impossible. Even if he had some inkling, he couldn't have seen through Chizuru's entire scheme. Because if Risome saw through the plan, he surely wouldn’t have left the classroom.

Chizuru regained her shaken confidence and pushed the door open to the large classroom. She looked at Rieko Nakamura once more, and once again, Nakamura nodded to her. Risome had returned to his seat and didn’t seem to have discovered the ruse. It seemed he was indeed just bluffing earlier.

I've got this in the bag.

Before long, the math teacher Kanyuki appeared. The forehead of the rigid teacher, with a receding hairline, was covered in stiff wrinkles. The students took their seats, and the distribution of test papers and answer sheets began, along with the dispassionate reminders of various precautions. Then, the bell announcing the start of the exam rang.

More than the test paper, Chizuru was focused on Risome. He was a step slower than those around him in opening his test paper and quickly skimmed through it. Then, he picked up his mechanical pencil and clicked it several times with his thumb... But no matter how many times he clicked, no lead came out.

Under the desk, Chizuru clenched her fist and lightly pumped it—success! Great!

But in the next instant, she nearly shouted out.

Risome set his mechanical pencil aside, took a small ballpoint pen from the pocket of his shirt front, and calmly began answering the questions.

Chizuru was dumbfounded. What in the world? It was one thing for a salaryman, but who would expect a normal high school student, especially one with a reputation for poor diligence, to keep a pen in his shirt front pocket? Could it be that he already knew the leads would be removed? But that possibility—

"Hey, Yatsuhashi!" she heard the teacher's voice, "Stop looking around and start answering!"

"Oh, alright..."

Failed—furious, Chizuru ground her teeth, frowning deeply, but decided to focus on her own test paper first. However, just as she reached for her mechanical pencil, she froze.

The lead she had adjusted to the right length just moments ago was now gone, and the tip was empty.

In anxiety, she repeatedly clicked the pencil head, but no matter how many times it made a clicking sound, the HB black lead didn’t appear.

She blankly turned to glance at the seat diagonally behind her. Rieko Nakamura looked up from her test paper with a stony face and shrugged with an expression that seemed to say, "Don't mess with me."

In that instant, she realized.

Risome indeed saw through her plan. He figured out Chizuru’s thinking and anticipated the scheme. Somehow, he managed to sway Rieko Nakamura and used the same trick on her. Him intentionally leaving the seat wasn't for the bathroom but to lure Chizuru out of the classroom.

But now, even though she was aware, it was too late. Precisely because there was no way Risome could have evidence to accuse her, she didn't have evidence against Risome.

"Yatsuhashi, I told you to stop looking around!"

"Teacher... my pen, pen, the lead..."

"Hmm?"

"Never mind, never mind."

It’s no use; if she pleaded, she'd likely be made to take a retest. Amid her turmoil, Chizuru racked her brain for a plan. Was there something, anything she could use to write? She desperately searched her desk, and then her fingertips touched something long and thin, like a pen cap.

A pen! Something the previous occupant of this seat forgot to take with them!

Chizuru thanked the gods, not even considering that it might have been deliberately left there by Risome and Nakamura, and pulled it out.

Her joyful expression began to twitch.

What she was holding was a yellow, old highlighter pen, which looked nothing like a mechanical pencil or a ballpoint pen.

2. The Broken Flag of Death

The advisor appeared in the lobby of the Hodono Valley Police Station promptly at one o'clock. Despite this being the territory of the Hakata people, different from school, the boy in his school uniform continued to be himself.

"Hello there, brother. I hear you've caught Nobuo Kuwajima?"

"Yes, right at the front door of Arisa Jomine's house. Detective Sendou is struggling with him in the interrogation room right now."

"What did he confess?"

"I wasn't there, so I only know that he seems to deny committing any crime."

"That's all I need to know."

"Oh, is that so... Oh yeah, why are you here alone today? Did your girlfriend dump you?"

"I'm recruiting people to take care of me. Brother, would you like to?"

"I refuse. If I started a family with you, Yuzuno would become your sister."

"Is that your reason for refusing?"

As they chatted, they climbed to the second floor and opened the door to the interrogation room.

In the narrow room with closed blinds were three men. Sendou, with a transcript of the confession spread out on the table, stood alongside Shirato, while in opposition was a man with an unhappy face and a scar on his face. Upon the entry of the two, Sendou and Shirato stood up, offering a folding chair to the advisor.

"Hurry it up," Sendou said, "times have changed; you can't just ignore the transcript!"

"So it seems. There isn't even a pork cutlet rice bowl."

"That was abolished before I graduated from police academy and came here."

"Are you trying to coerce a confession?" Nobuo Kuwajima asked in a low voice.

Sendou answered facing the suspect, "In a sense, that might be the case. Mr. Kuwajima, you should be prepared—talking to this guy is exhausting."

Tama Risome took a step forward and sat in the chair that Sendou had just vacated. Nobuo Kuwajima seemed to reassess the confusion and blinked, asking, "Who are you?"

"I'm an investigation advisor, responsible for the library case."

"This isn't a joke, is it?"

"Definitely not. But I'm still high from just finishing my end-of-term exams."

Nobuo Kuwajima showed signs of fatigue, glancing imploringly at Sendou. The police chief, leaning against the wall with Hakata and others, maintained a serious expression.

"Mr. Kuwajima," Risome spoke, "Someone saw you leaving Kazekozan Library around 11 p.m. on Monday, with your head bleeding and in a great panic."

"Oh, I admit that. But I'm not the murderer. I didn't kill Kyouko Jomine."

"I know that."

Nobuo blinked again, but this time differently. Sendou also murmured softly.

"What I want to know is why you, who aren’t the killer, went to the library, what you did there, and what you saw. Can you tell me as clearly as possible from the beginning? Maybe the detectives don’t believe you, but I do. This is because I know very well you're not the killer."

Risome repeated, staring into Nobuo Kuwajima's eyes. Yusaku thought Risome's statement was quite exaggerated! "Know very well"—not just "feel." As if Risome had already perfectly proved in his mind that Kuwajima was not the murderer.

The former librarian widened his eyes, looked at Risome, and scratched his bandaged head loudly, saying, "I read the novel."

"Even after being dismissed, I often went to the library as a reader because both my previous and new homes are close to the library. Initially, I went to read back-issues of magazines, but in early September, I noticed an unknown book on the domestic novel bookshelf. The title was—"

"The Planet of the Key Country," Risome said first.

"Yes. Neither the title nor the author's name was anything I recognized, nor did I recall the library having such a collection. Intrigued, I picked it up and saw it had an in-house label sticker, so I sat on a bench on the second floor and started reading.

At first, I thought it was a mystery novel written by an amateur. The plot development was awkward, and the depiction of the peculiar world view wasn't satisfactory, and traces of forced writing were evident. However... after finishing it, I became captivated with it."
"Kuajima averted his gaze, describing his excitement.

'The trap was designed so brilliantly. I've read thousands of mystery novels, but I've never seen anything like this. It fundamentally overturns the concept of a locked room, reminding me of *The Judas Window*...'

'I guessed this would be the case when you said it was a suspense novel,' Risome chimed in, seemingly enjoying the conversation.

'In any case, I plan to investigate the author of this book. However, when I searched online using the book title, author name, and publisher name, I found nothing. Moreover, it's not even recorded in the library's collection information. The copyright page and library barcode are all fake. So I realized that someone had secretly made this book and placed it in the library. In a sense, I guessed right that this book was "written by an amateur." I'm increasingly curious to know the real identity of the author, so I set a small trap. I deliberately put the book in the place of other authors' names. If the person who placed the book noticed, he would surely be concerned and move it back to its original position. Fortunately, being unemployed means I have plenty of time. I planned to come to the library every day to observe, but it only took two days to yield results. Last Saturday, a man put the book back in its original place—a young man I often see in the library.'

'Is that Kyousuke Jomine?' Kuajima nodded.

'It turned out I was wrong, but at the time, I thought he was the author. I had a vague impression of his identity, knowing he was a frequent reader often talked about by the librarians, seemingly a student aspiring to become a teacher with the surname "Jomine." I think I've even heard his first name, but I couldn't recall it. He was, in short, a student, one striving to get a teaching certificate... Then I thought, why not steal the setup of that book?'

'So, are you saying you tried to blackmail him with the forged book to take the idea for yourself?'

'To put it bluntly, yes.' The man with bandages on his head clicked his tongue in displeasure. 'I regret it now. But being driven by unemployment, I thought if the book was published and entered into a competition, I'd get some prize money... well, that's just embellishing it. I just wanted his idea, wanted to claim that trap as my own.'

'This past Monday, I saw Jomine in the library again, so I called him outside the automatic door and negotiated with him to sell me *The Planet of Keys*. If he didn't agree, I would tell the librarians about the book. Causing a problem like this outside school would likely ruin his dream of becoming a teacher... I just said whatever came to mind, threatening him. He reluctantly said the book wasn't written by him but by his cousin, and he needed to consult her. I was half-believing. I knew he had a cousin, remembered that girl often came to the library too, yet I couldn't recall her name either.'

'You really should communicate more with your colleagues.'

'I'll pay attention at the next place... In short, I set the deadline for the next morning to meet him at the library for his response, and then parted ways with him.'

'What did you do after that?'

'I sat near the domestic novels section, pretending to sleep, watching if anyone would take away *The Planet of Keys*. If Jomine took the book home, there would be no evidence to threaten him. I waited until the library closed, but no one touched the book.'

'Was *The Planet of Keys* still on the shelf at closing time?'

'Yes.'

'I see,' Risome smiled meaningfully, urging him to continue. Kuajima, looking hesitant, shrank his neck and said:

'I went back to the apartment after closing, and upon reflecting, realized my approach was careless. I didn't know Jomine's full name or address. If he refused to deal with me, having his address beforehand would help. Moreover, I wanted to investigate the identity of his cousin. It was possible because I could access the library's reader data.'

'Is that why you snuck into the library at night?'

'I thought sneaking in would go unnoticed.' Sendou snorted beside Hakata. Kuajima's attempt to infiltrate the library to investigate Kyousuke Jomine's personal information seemed like the superintendent's deduction was correct.

'I calculated the time the librarians would be gone and went to the library. The night password hadn't been changed, so I got in from the office's side door.'

'Was the cover of the keypad open?'

'Yes.'

'Do you know exactly what time you entered the library?'

'Exactly nine-thirty, as I saw on the office's digital clock.'

'Good. Now, please tell us about your nighttime adventure in the library.'

'I was as clumsy as Injun Joe,' the man with fish-like eyes shook his head, 'I didn't have the courage to turn on the lights, so I relied on a flashlight I brought to reach the counter. Neither the office area nor the open shelves had anyone present.'

'Sorry to interrupt again. Were the office and counter doors open?'

'Yes, they were. I neither opened nor closed any doors.'

'Are you sure there was no one in the office area?'

'Yes, because I scanned with the flashlight after entering the office... there wasn't a single person as far as I could see.'

Risome leaned forward quietly and asked:

'One more point, this is also very important. Was the upper volume of *The Pictures of a Person Dying* in the corridor?'

Kuajima scratched his chin, searched his memory, and said, 'Yes.'

'It should have been on the small trolley by the archive door... that's right, because I had the flashlight, I clearly remember it.'

'I understand. So, what did clumsy Injun Joe do next?'

'I logged into the database on the loan counter's computer, first pulling up readers with the surname Jomine in the area. I initially assumed there wouldn't be many people, yet over forty names came up. Without photos, I couldn't determine which Jomine I was looking for. The only clues I had were age. As for his cousin, she's also surnamed Jomine and is female. The only criterion left was being close in age to him. Frustrated, I decided to record the names and addresses of everyone with potential into my phone.'

'Didn't you consider printing or copying files?'

'The printer was out of paper, and I didn't bring a USB to copy files. I wanted to leave as few suspicious traces as possible... so I sat on the chair, placed my hat and flashlight aside, and began entering the names and addresses of potential people into my phone's memo. Although tedious, I wasn't worried about anyone coming to the library at night. Plus, I had ample time due to unemployment.'

Kuajima mocked himself with these words, then immediately showed a displeased expression again.

'About fifteen minutes in, on the reader page for Kyousuke Jomine, a realization hit me. The name's pronunciation reminded me of how the librarians called him "Kyousuke-kun." I felt my efforts paid off, staring at his name, I went, "It's him!" Then—'

He suddenly pointed at his head and said:

'I was attacked from behind without warning. I remember falling to the ground with the chair, and my phone flew out too. Everything that happened afterward is a blur—I believe this took place at nine-fifty.'

'He attacked you from behind? Not from the front?'

'Yes. It was dark around, but the computer screen was bright. I was always facing the open shelves. If anyone approached from the staircase or open shelves, I would have seen them immediately.'

'Also, no one approached you from the front while you were at the counter. Given this, it indeed seems someone attacked you from behind,' Risome nodded again. 'Next question, when did you regain consciousness?'

'When I came to, I thought I was dead due to the absolute darkness. But I touched my phone under the counter with my left hand. I checked the time, it was ten-till-eleven, meaning I fainted for exactly an hour. I felt horrible. My head throbbed, and there was blood on the floor... yet I wanted to understand the situation first. I found my hat and flashlight still on the counter, untouched. The computer was still on, so I quickly turned it off.'

'I wanted to know who hit me, quickly searched the first-floor open shelves, but no one was there. Then I went up to the second floor by the stairs. With the flashlight's help, I discovered *The Pictures of a Person Dying* on the floor deep in the corridor... Kyousuke Jomine was dead in front of the bookshelf.'

Kuajima paused here, gazing at the interrogation room floor as if the corpse lay there.

'Did you see anyone who might be the murderer?'

'No, at least no one was visible after I scanned around.'

'Can you describe the body's condition?'

'Oh.' To recall this, Kuajima was unwilling from the bottom of his heart. What he described matched perfectly with the appearance discovered the following morning: the body lying prone, a bookbag beside it. The murder weapon and faint bloodstains. Blood pools, books, and the death message.

'I had no idea what had happened. I wanted to flee but was still concerned about *The Planet of Keys*, as it was on that very shelf. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't find it. It wasn't on the shelf, nor among the books scattered on the floor.'

'Did you check Jomine's bookbag?'

'No, I didn't want to touch anything, so I didn’t look through his bag... was it inside?'

'No, only small personal items were in the bag. What happened next?'

'I ran. I ran out from the side door. But as I reached the road, I crashed into a parked bicycle. A girl stood by the vending machine, and I fell, my hat fell off, and I saw the girl was staring at me with wide eyes. My head was bleeding, and she was staring at me in shock, dropping the drink can in her hand. I was even more flustered and fled without apologizing.'

Finally, the man's confession overlapped with Arisa Jomine's testimony. Hakata continued to take notes, Shirato nodded to show understanding, and Sendou had been weighing the truth, never taking his eyes off Kuajima.

Risome asked, 'Did you return to your apartment?'

'Yes, I walked back. I bandaged the wound and slept a night. But the next day, I started worrying. The library retained my fingerprints and blood. What if the police suspect me of killing Jomine? What if they came knocking on my door now... so I fled the house with just my wallet, card, and phone.'

'Where were you during the three days before you got caught? What did you do?' asked Sendou. Kuajima indeed stated he stayed in various cafes. Even without deploying a perimeter around Arisa's home, he would eventually be caught.

'During the escape, I couldn't stop thinking about *The Planet of Keys*. I reviewed the names and addresses recorded in my phone memo, pondering who Kyousuke Jomine's cousin might be. On Tuesday afternoon, I noticed among them a "Arisa Jomine," and it struck me immediately. Arisa Jomine, written in Roman letters, is the wordplay for the author's name of *The Planet of Keys*.'

Kuajima traced in the air with his finger.

'I thought this person must be the author, so I went to her house. As a result, I was shocked to see that the girl through the window looked exactly like the one I encountered by the vending machine that night. I left in a panic, but couldn't settle down, so I went again to confirm yesterday...'

At this point, Kuajima leaned back against the folding chair, as if saying, 'And then I got caught.' This peculiar long confession drew to a close.

Risome stood up slowly.

'Your deduction is correct, Arisa Jomine is the author of *The Planet of Keys*.'

'I knew it! Does she have anything to do with the case?'

'No, she has an alibi.'

'Oh, really?'

'So, you don't know who attacked you or have any idea who killed Kyousuke either.'

'Sorry I couldn't be of help!' Kuajima said, half-revealing, in response to Risome's summary.

'Anyway, I didn't do it, really. The real culprit must be Taku Koyama; that death message clearly points to him.'

'Unfortunately, that alone does not constitute evidence,' Sendou said, moving away from the window. 'I say, is *The Planet of Keys* truly such a masterpiece? I merely skimmed through it, unclear myself.'

'The setup of the trap is a masterpiece among masterpieces! I recommend you read it... oh right, Mr. Detective, if you meet Arisa Jomine, I would like you to convey a message to her.'

'What to say? "I want to plagiarize your work"?'

'No.' Kuajima seemed to have given up all ideas, smiled slightly, and said, 'Please tell her I'm her fan.'

'Do you believe that man's confession?' A few minutes later, the detectives moved to the rest area surrounded by vending machines. Sendou lit a Camel cigarette and asked Risome. The advisor on the bench held a can of coffee and replied:

'I don't believe his confession specifically; I trust my own deductions.'

'You mean, matching your deductions with Kuajima's words leads you to believe he's telling the truth?'

'Yes. There's no reason for doubt, from the start. His words also align with other evidence.'

'He was on the run for three days, plenty of time to think about how to align with the evidence.'

'Detective, you're quite stubborn... alright, let me explain. For instance, from his words, we can deduce what actions Kyousuke Jomine took.'

Risome sipped coffee with a small amount of added sugar and began to explain:

'Kyousuke Jomine, on Monday afternoon, came to the library with Kohei Akashi, and around three, he left his seat to choose books. At this moment, Nobuo Kuwajima called him to deal—this was seen by Hikari Uehashi—so, faced with trouble, what would Kyousuke decide to do? He would first think to hide *The Planet of Keys*, the book causing him threats. However, Kuajima predicted this and prevented him from approaching the shelf. So, is there any way to retrieve the forged book that day? Only one.'

'Breaking into the library after closing...' Hakata voiced the only method.

'Yes. So, he lied to Taku Koyama and got the night password. Shortly after, he met Arisa Jomine yet seemed unable to speak about the transaction.

'When night fell, around seven, thinking the staff was gone, he told his mother a lie and went to the library again. He packed a flashlight in his bag. But the library lights were still on. Reluctantly, he returned home. His next attempt was about two hours later, around nine-thirty. This time, the lights were out, so he entered the just-closed library. Kuajima entered four or five minutes afterward.'

'Four or five minutes later?' Shirato said, 'Very close indeed.'

'It can only be surmised this way. The fingerprints on the doorknob and keypad cover indicate Kyousuke was the first to enter the library. Given that Kuajima entered at nine-thirty, then Kyousuke must have broken in shortly before. This means Kyousuke entered the library just a bit earlier than Kuajima.'

The senior detective nodded, as interested as ever. 

'With that in mind, we can imagine why Kyousuke got trapped inside. Entering the library, he hadn't closed the keypad cover or the office door when he went to the second floor. Although the darkness in the library delayed him, he smoothly retrieved the book. He intended to leave the library promptly. However, descending to the first floor, he was surprised to find Kuajima Nobuo at the counter.'
During the four or five minutes that Kyousuke was on the second floor, Nobuo Kuwajima, who was completely unaware, had already entered the library, sat down at the counter, and started browsing through the reader data. 

"Why is Kuwajima here?" Kyousuke might have been puzzled about it. However, no matter how you look at it, the stairs and the elevator both face the counter, and he would be discovered as soon as he went downstairs. Thus, he had no choice but to observe the situation at the counter from the staircase landing, waiting patiently. 

Then, about fifteen minutes later, someone assaulted Kuwajima. 

"So, it wasn't Kyousuke who assaulted Kuwajima?" Sendou asked. The advisor nodded and said, "In this situation, even without relying on imagination, it can be logically proven. As I mentioned earlier, Kyousuke was the first to enter the library, followed shortly after by Kuwajima. Kyousuke couldn't have left the library in this very short interval, as there were no fingerprints left by Kyousuke on the inner door handle. Once Kyousuke entered the library, he never came out again. Therefore, at the time Kuwajima entered the library, Kyousuke was still inside the building. 

"So, where was he?" Kuwajima testified that when he came in, there was no one in the office area. Naturally, he didn't conduct a thorough search, so it's not impossible for someone to be hiding in the collection room, the transport entrance, or the office cupboard, but it certainly couldn't have been Kyousuke. There were no fingerprints left by him on the doors of those places either. Therefore, when Kuwajima was sitting at the counter, Kyousuke should have been in the open-shelf area. And if he was in the open-shelf area, he couldn't have gotten behind Kuwajima. This means that the person who attacked Kuwajima from behind was not Kyousuke. There was someone else— the culprit." 

"Oh..." The detective puffed on his cigarette thoughtfully, unwilling to concede, and said, "That is, assuming your deduction is correct..." Risome didn't mind his attitude and continued to deduce the case's progression. 

"Analyzing this fact further, we can figure out one more thing— the motive for the killing." 

"The motive?" 

"It was to silence a witness, detective. Kyousuke likely witnessed the scene of the assailant attacking Kuwajima. Kuwajima fell to the ground and lost consciousness. Both the assailant and Kyousuke might have mistakenly believed that he was already dead. Then, to cover up their crime, the assailant sealed Kyousuke's lips." 

"..." The detective pressed the last bit of a Camel cigarette stub forcefully onto the square ashtray. After finishing his coffee, Risome attempted to toss the empty can into the trash but stopped mid-action and instead placed it normally in the bin. It seemed he lacked confidence in making the toss. 

"So, the rough sequence of events on the night of the crime is like this." Hakata drew up a simple timeline and spread out a notebook in front of Sendou and the others. The three of them huddled together to scrutinize it. 

19:00 - Kyousuke Jomine leaves home. 
19:10 - Kyousuke wanders around the road behind the library. Briefly returns home. 
20:00 - Librarians leave the library. 
21:20 - Kyousuke leaves home again. 
21:25 - Kyousuke breaks into the library, goes to the second floor (workers noticed the lights on). 
21:30 - Kuwajima enters the library shortly after, starts browsing data. 
21:50 - Kuwajima is attacked by a newcomer. 
22:00 - Kyousuke is killed on the second floor (workers saw the lights on). The assailant flees. 
22:50 - Kuwajima regains consciousness. Finds Kyousuke's body on the second floor (workers see the lights on). 
23:00 - Arisa Jomine sees Kuwajima fleeing the library. 

"Perfect! As expected of my brother!" 

"Indeed, it doesn't contradict other evidence and testimonies." Sendou reluctantly admitted, and Shirato nodded leisurely in agreement. 

"The fog has mostly cleared. Kuwajima Nobuo threatened Kyousuke Jomine; both broke into the library for different reasons. Someone who entered later attacked Kuwajima and killed Kyousuke Jomine, who witnessed the incident... That's the rough outline of the case. But there's still one thing we haven't figured out." 

"This is the most crucial part. Who is the killer? Where did they come from? Why were they at the scene?" 

"The person who took 'The Planet of the Key' is the killer, right? Is the killer also related to the book?" The detectives each posed questions, and silence fell again. Regarding this "most crucial part," Risome seemed to have no conclusions either and silently shifted his crossed legs. The vending machine's motor hummed lowly, seemingly describing their stagnant thoughts. 

It was when Sendou finished his second cigarette that the advisor stood up from the rusted bench: "Brother. Was anything found concerning the tiny substances retrieved from the scene?" 

"No. Nothing related to the case was found." 

"I see. Then let's go to the library— it's the most suitable place for the investigation, after all." 

3 Blue Bookmark

About a week later, having shed the burdens, Yuzuno felt a lightness on her shoulders again. It wasn't just because she wasn't carrying a bag upon leaving school, but also because the final exams were over. 

On the last day of exams, she unexpectedly did well in every subject. The Japanese history she had been reviewing for the past two weeks showed results, and health and physical education and home economics weren't much of a challenge. The most worrisome one, English writing, surprised her right at the start of the exam. Most of the questions were from the content Risome told her the day before. She nearly shouted, like depicted in some manga: "This is what Risome taught in class!" Thanks to him, she did exceptionally well. 

Ah, thinking about it now, it's really such a relief! No more lugging textbooks home every day, no more evening self-study sessions after school. No, if she lets her guard down like this, she'll be in trouble for the next exam. Anyway, today she could resume team activities, go online, play with Sanae, and listen to the CD Kyouka gave her. 

And, she could also make some time to investigate. 

As she passed through the automatic doors, the cold air rushed inside Yuzuno’s jacket. The Kazekozan Library, which she hadn't visited in three days, had returned to its usual calm. No, one might say it was too calm. There were hardly any readers, and the library was quiet and deserted. It seemed the impact of the case was still quite significant. 

"Oh dear... aren't you the student who came with the advisor last time?" Librarian Rihoko Nariki, with her bobbed hair, was sitting at the counter. She remembered Yuzuno and eyed her cautiously through her thick lenses. 

"Are you here to investigate the case again today?" 

"No, I didn’t come for that today... I want to look up some information." 

"Information?" Her gaze softened, "What kind of information?" 

"Well, it's the school newspaper, do you have it here?" 

"We have a few from nearby schools." 

"Do you have ones from Hiten? Hiten Academy Junior High's school newspaper." 

"Oh, Hiten sends us copies annually. The recent ones should be on this shelf..." 

Nariki left the counter and led Yuzuno to the local materials section next to it. Three A5-sized booklets were placed together with maps of the area and a tile railroad map of Ebi. On the orange covers, there were photos of the school buildings, and the magazine's name was "Dawn." Below was a small line of words: Hiten Academy Junior High· 2009 Edition. The other two were the 2010 and 2011 Editions. 

"Is this okay?" 

"Wonderful. Thank you!" 

"These can't be borrowed, so please read them at the table over there. Copies are ten yen per page..." 

Nariki added a simple introduction and returned to the counter. 

Yuzuno pulled out the 2009 and 2010 editions of "Dawn" and sat at the nearest desk. She didn't take the 2011 edition from the shelf because he should have graduated by then. 

What Yuzuno wanted to investigate was the situation during Risome's junior high years. 

The only specific information she had was that he was once a student at Hiten. To find a new lead, the only keyword was Hiten Academy. However, entering "Hiten Academy" online produced excessive information, making it hard to know where to start. 

Hence, Yuzuno turned her attention to the school newspaper. Middle schools usually published a small booklet every few years, recording events inside and outside the school. Previously, she read a report in the Kazekozan High School's library newspaper stating that school newspapers would be sent to the library, thus learning that libraries not only collected ordinary books but also local publications. If that was the case, a prominent school like Hiten might have theirs too... 

With this thought, Yuzuno quickly finished her lunch and rushed to the library. Although she hadn't held much hope from the beginning, it seemed that the jam sandwich she hastily had for lunch was proving quite effective. However, time was limited, and she had to return to school before 3 o'clock for the club activities. 

Yuzuno, bracing herself as if she was reviewing for an exam, said to herself, "Let's do it" and eagerly opened the 2009 edition when Risome was a sophomore in junior high. 

The introduction began with a greeting from the principal and the PTA chairman; it was lengthy and useless, so she skipped over it. Next were reports of the year's activities, listing all the year-round student activities and achievements of various clubs. There were award-winning essays from certain students in competitions and speech transcripts from others. Occasionally, there were inserted color photographs. 

As expected of Hiten, the content was rather luxurious, but the names of Risome Tama and Sakasaka Kaori weren't featured here. Nor did she find anyone resembling them in the corners of the photos. 

Could it really be all for nothing? Yuzuno's fingers gradually lost strength as she turned the pages. 

"Ah..." 

As she flipped to a page near the very end, Yuzuno's fingers stopped. The page's title was "This Year's Dusk Awards." It seemed to be Hiten's version of a student award, given to those who achieved excellent performance in academics and sports over the year. On the stage in the auditorium, six students stood side by side. 

Among them was a girl whom Yuzuno recognized. 

Kaori— no, this girl had her long hair combed neatly behind her, stood straight-backed, and possessed mature beauty. 

Yuzuno checked the name below the photo, and sure enough, it was Choko Shinjiritsu. She was in the same grade as Risome and should have been a sophomore in 2009. Although she was shorter back then, the confident smile that suggested winning this award was only natural was no different from now. Next to her was another girl awarded at the same time; she looked like a typical junior high student, appearing overwhelmed by the queenly aura beside her, shoulders hunched. 

The exact reason for the award wasn't detailed in the record; it was probably due to her outstanding achievements in table tennis. It seemed her prowess in table tennis was genuine, even starting in junior high. But what was Yuzuno like as a sophomore herself? She recalled that her skill in defending shots wasn't good, and she was scolded by a senior at the time. 

"Well—" 

"Ah!" 

Suddenly hearing someone call her, Yuzuno's heart pounded rapidly. She turned to look and found the person equally startled by Yuzuno's reaction. It was an obedient-looking girl with glasses, her hair neatly braided into two, wearing a Kazekozan school uniform. 

"Jo... Jomine-san." 

"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you... You're the one who was with Risome last time, right? Your name is, Hakata— Hakata girl?" 

"Yuzuno. Yuzuno Hakata." 

This chairperson, perhaps had an unexpected air of innocence. 

"What are you investigating?" 

"Oh, nothing, it's not important... hahahaha." 

Yuzuno hastily closed "Dawn" and put it back on the shelf. This behavior seemed suspicious to her. She suddenly remembered that last time when she talked to Arisa, she had just smelled the seat on her bike, and it seemed like the impression she left on her was going to worsen over time. 

"Uh, Jomine-san, why are you here?" 

"I came to see if there were any developments in the case." 

Arisa smiled weakly and averted her gaze. 

That's right. For her, this was the place where her cousin was killed; she wouldn't have come here just to borrow books. Because of her nervousness, Yuzuno accidentally asked the wrong question. 

Feeling both awkward and guilty, Yuzuno turned her gaze to the library area. A girl with a backpack was wandering in front of the bookshelves, seemingly searching for something. She looked like she could be about third grade, and her hairstyle was very similar to the chairperson's. 

"Jomine-san, how old were you when you started coming to the library?" 

Yuzuno asked casually. 

Arisa said, "I've been coming since kindergarten. Initially, I only went to the picture book area; later, I started reading books that were further inside, and then I went to the second floor." 

"Turns out you've liked reading since young." 

"Well, it's more like I liked the atmosphere here than the books." 

"The atmosphere..." 

The over-effective air-conditioning. The smell of the paper. The quiet tranquility. 

"The air in the library is a bit special, isn't it? It gives a sense that this place is something unique. The time spent choosing books with a six-volume limit, the sound of scanning when borrowing, opening an old book wondering who read it before... I used to love those things." 

Arisa said nostalgically. Yuzuno noticed that she used the past tense in her last sentence. 

"It's actually not good." 

"Hmm?" 

"It's not good to only read at a library. Books you like should be kept by your side." 

"Oh... well, we're kind of tight on money, though." 

"Yes, so perhaps our library visits would only be for the time being. When we grow up, and we have more money that we can freely use, we can buy nice books at bookstores and go to distant second-hand book streets, learn to order books online... In that case, the atmosphere and benefits might be forgotten, and our visits here could decrease." 

Her eyes gazing inside the library were flickering with solitude. Even though Yuzuno wasn't the one experiencing it, she seemed to catch a glimpse of her feelings. 

Not everyone would always cling to one place like Kyousuke Jomine. Once the outside world becomes vast, people would naturally gravitate toward it. The things gained from frequently visiting such a spot should become our wealth, yet the time we can spend here is finite. 

"You sound like you're about to graduate tomorrow." 

Yuzuno said quietly. Arisa looked at her with a slight surprise and burst into a smile: "A little bit." Her smile no longer felt perfunctory like before; it naturally reminded one of sunlight. 

"Hakata-san is a bit unusual, you know." 

"Am I?" It was the first time anyone had said that to her. 

"Do you like books and the library, Hakata-san?" 

"Not... not exactly a big fan..." 

"I see. But you do seem very suited for the library." 

That's something people tended to say. Gently poking at her sore spot, Yuzuno chuckled awkwardly. 

"Oh, by the way, I met a detective with the same last name as you last time." 

"Ah, that must be my brother." 

"Really? Then, that thing too..." 

For some reason, Arisa blushed. 

"That thing?" 

"Your brother said you were Risome's girlfriend..." 

"That's a misunderstanding. But thank you for telling me." 

Before Arisa could finish, Yuzuno immediately corrected her. Perhaps sensing the hostility emanating from Yuzuno, Arisa fearfully replied, "I see, glad it was just a misunderstanding." 

"Glad?" 

"No, not glad, actually." 

Arisa averted her gaze and readjusted her backpack straps. 

"Well, I'll get going. Sorry for disturbing your investigation." 

"No, no... by the way, Jomine-san, I've heard that suspect Kuwajima is targeting you. Is it safe for you to be out alone?" 

"You're well informed. Actually, the detective contacted me." 

"He was arrested last night." 

The familiar voice of a young man reached their ears. Looking toward the automatic door, they saw Risome approaching with the pair of detectives from the prefectural police. 

"Brother!" 

"Yuzuno!" 

Yuzuno waved her hand and ran to her brother, catching him off guard, and smiled as she backhanded his side with a spinning smash move she had honed over the summer training. Her brother let out a "puft" sound and collapsed as if out of breath, lying still on the floor. 

"Are you Nene's mother?" Risome addressed. 

"Did apprehending Kuwajima mean you figured out what happened?" 

She continued as if nothing had happened, and Sendou calmly replied, "Yes." 

"He told us everything he did in the library that night. It's fortunate we ran into Jomine; we have a few things left to confirm. Hakata, you tell her." 

"......" 

"Let's borrow your notebook for a moment." 

The police chief took notes from the report of his deceased subordinate and began detailing Kuwajima Nobuo's story.
Yuzuno was hoping the mystery of the case would be resolved, but after listening, her mind only became more muddled.

"So, basically, Kunishima wanted the idea for 'Planet of the Land of Keys,' so he threatened Kyousuke? He snuck into the library to get information on him, and during this process, he was attacked by someone, and when he came to, he found a body on the second floor?"

“Thank you for the summary.” said Sendou to Yuzuno, then his narrow eyes shifted to Arisa. The author of 'Planet of the Land of Keys' had a complicated expression, frowning.

“Joumine-san, Kunishima said he threatened Kyousuke. Do you think he was telling the truth?”

“I don’t know. However, when we parted ways on Monday, Kyousuke seemed like he had something to tell me. Perhaps he wanted to talk about the deal Kunishima proposed… and also…”

“And also?”

“When Kyousuke first read 'Planet of the Land of Keys', he praised me for setting up a good trap. That was why I considered placing it in the library. Although I wasn’t confident about it.”

Arisa lowered her head, her bangs falling to cover her eyes. Even if the incident was triggered by her novel, she didn't need to put the blame on herself.

“So the murderer is not Kunishima?”

To sort out her thoughts, Yuzuno asked the inspector again.

“That is the problem. I think he's just making up a plausible story.”

"I don't think so," Risome said. "Kunishima Fanao is not the murderer."

“Do you have evidence?”

“The utility knife, detective. Didn’t I mention it yesterday?”

“What does that have to do with the credibility of his testimony? Honestly, whether it's about Kunishima or the information on the deceased, what you said is all…”

“Information on the deceased.”

Arisa murmured to herself. 

When she looked up, the smile on her face was gone, revealing an expression that Yuzuno had seen before. Though she skillfully concealed her emotions, her big eyes and long eyebrows couldn't lie. It was the same distressed expression she had on the first day of exams in front of the shoe locker.

“What’s wrong?”

“It’s nothing… Uh, I have something to do. I’ll head back first.”

Arisa lowered her head, turned her back to Yuzuno and the others, and left through the automatic door. Her pace was quick, as if spurred by something.

“She shouldn’t have heard about what happened on the night of the incident. It was too harsh for her."

Sendou scratched his head as he said this. Risome neither confirmed nor denied it, just stared at the automatic door.

“Detective, may I interrupt for a moment?”

Another person greeted them. It was a man with long hair wearing a dark blue apron, Taku Koyama.

“Koyama-san, what’s the matter? Oh, don't mind my subordinate who’s dead here, he’ll be up in a while.”

“No, no, not about that. I'm here to lodge a complaint.”

His face was noticeably more haggard than three days ago.

“Are the police always this unreasonable? They came to my house in the middle of the night yesterday, pestering me. They spoke to me as if presuming I’m the murderer… And the search squad even went to my wife’s family home.”

“Oh, um… I’m sorry about that, but it’s to conduct a thorough investigation…”

“Please, enough is enough. I’m not the murderer.”

Koyama said in a calm and firm tone. Sendou looked at the advisor as if shifting responsibility. Risome said coldly:

“Even so, we suspect you at the moment. The information found at the scene also points to you.”

“I don’t care about any information. I’m not the murderer.”

“Do you have evidence?”

“I am not the murderer!”

Koyama shouted emotionally. Yuzuno couldn't help but step back, and even Nariki from inside the counter turned to watch. Koyama's once calm face twisted, revealing a dreadful expression as he glared at the youth. Risome remained unfazed, staring back at him with unyielding, steely eyes.

A few seconds later, the librarian could no longer hold out. Exhausted, Koyama left silently, heading for the hall leading to the office. The sound of a door closing echoed in the library.

“I really don’t understand your approach at all.”

“It’s just as you said, Detective. We need to thoroughly investigate.” Risome replied dismissively, crossing his arms, and walked toward the children's book section.

*

Arisa stepped outside and noticed the sky was overcast. 

She remembered the weather forecast mentioned rain starting in the evening, which might unexpectedly arrive early. She came by bicycle today and didn't bring an umbrella, so she needed to hurry back.

Arisa pushed her bike out of the parking lot and looked back at the library. Its gray walls and arched roof stood out. Under the gloomy sky, the library looked old and insignificant.

She recalled what Yuzuno Hakata said.

Perhaps, she indeed planned to graduate from this library. If it’s “graduation,” then surely there’s youth stored here. Even if it sounds childish, at least to Arisa, it’s true. Familiar friends. Teachers who opened up new worlds for her. This library would always appear in her memories. This library, and Kyousuke.

She might have lied to Hakata.

She didn’t actually love books or the library’s atmosphere—

“Goodbye!”

The farewell words burst from her mouth. She wasn’t even sure what exactly she was saying goodbye to.

The young girl mounted her bicycle, steadied her feet on the pedals, and rode off with determination.

4 RED FRACTION

“The English writing exam included almost everything you taught me.”

“That’s good.”

Risome replied, without any emotional fluctuation. He was flipping through a dinosaur encyclopedia on a table in the children's section.

“How did you predict the exam topics? Are you capable of deducing even the test questions?”

“In professional terms, deducing test questions is called ‘forecasting’.”

“Forecasting? But you completely predicted it…”

“Didn’t Hamaguchi, the lecturer, teach you English writing? That guy uses the same topics every year. Why do you think that is?”

During the study group, everyone talked about this. “Little Hama” made things too easy by repeating his topics, which in turn made us worry. Sanae even thought about getting last year’s test papers to score well. But why was it?

“He’s just lazy, I guess?”

“It’s because this set of test questions is comprehensive. I presume it covers all the essentials from the textbook. With that, one can expect what will be on the exam.”

“…”

In Yuzuno’s mind, the teacher who was mocked for his mediocrity suddenly transformed. 

Unchanging test questions. Which, conversely, meant test questions that didn’t need to change. Risome saw through Hamaguchi’s methods, inferring the exam content from the textbook’s essential points. I see. No wonder he excels academically despite being considered useless. Yuzuno felt she had glimpsed the secret behind his high grades—wait!

Just as a sense of admiration started to develop, she noticed a minor inconsistency.

During the study group, when Yuzuno mentioned Hamaguchi-sensei’s name, Kaori said, "It was the same when we and Tenma were first-year students." This meant that Hamaguchi-sensei also taught English writing in Risome's first year.

Could it be he remembered the English test questions from a year ago? Even if it’s improbable for most people, this man could likely do it. He taught Yuzuno English grammar based on his memory, but if he had confessed honestly, Yuzuno might have gotten angry, thinking it was akin to cheating, so he spun a plausible lie. Could it be like that?

Yuzuno stared hard at Risome beside her. He seemed fascinated by the stegosaurus, his face close to the encyclopedia. Almost intentionally.

“Risome-san.”

“Yes?”

“Do you know the phrase, ‘Telling lies leads to becoming a wolf’?”

“I think you’re mixing a proverb with a fairy tale. I am not a wolf.”

“Men are wolves!”

“Stop talking like Alice from SOS!”

Alice? I was aiming for more of a Pink Lady. Where did this conversation even end up?

“Ah… fine, fine. Anyway, thank you for helping me with my studies.”

“You’re welcome.”

Risome handed Yuzuno a ballpoint pen as he replied. This was the substitute for the captain’s revered mechanical pencil which Yuzuno had lent him two days ago.

“Here, returning this to you. It helped me manage the exam.”

“I’m not sure how it actually helped… You don’t need to return it; consider it a gift.”

“Is that so? Then I’ll keep it as a memento.”

Risome placed it back into his shirt’s front pocket, growing more peculiar by the minute.

“Are you conducting research voluntarily?”

Sendou approached from the hall, followed by Yuzuno’s brother, who was pale and clutching his side. It seemed the intensified spin smash had a lasting effect.

“I’m simply examining the anatomy in reference to the Land, Sea, and Air Bionic Dinosaurs Aerial Megadragon.”

After giving this bizarre answer, Risome closed the dinosaur encyclopedia.

“What did the librarians testify?”

“Hikari Uehashi mentioned that judging by Kyousuke and Kunishima’s interaction on Monday, Kyousuke did seem to be threatened. Aside from that, nothing else was useful.”

“I see. You’re in a stalemate.”

“Advisor, this isn’t unrelated to you. You said there was something you wanted to show me. What is it?”

Risome left his seat, leading the three to the edge of the area.

There were four kinds of stains on the ground, like something had been spilled. Three were aligned horizontally, with another in front of them. The leftmost was a bloodstain, the center was also a bloodstain, similar to the crime scene's, slightly smeared. The right stain was black, as if it had been pressed with a cloth. The remaining one wasn't blood but seemed to be spilled water, and like the center bloodstain, the water was slightly smeared.

“What is this?”

“This is my voluntary research.”

Risome echoed Sendou’s earlier remark.

“The crime scene’s floor had unnatural traces of wiping, right? I have been contemplating this fact. The smearing of the blood indicated someone wiped over it. In other words, wiping occurred after the murder. But this poses three mysteries. Who? Why? How was it wiped?”

“Who? It's surely the murderer.”

“Why? Perhaps to erase something incriminating.”

“How was it wiped? Just ordinarily wiped, I suppose?”

Sendou, Yuzuno’s brother, and Yuzuno each answered the questions, and Risome nodded in agreement with each.

“Yes. Who? Surely the murderer. This has been proven through experimentation. I tested the blood on the left, and it completely soaked into the carpet in ten minutes, unable to be smeared by fingers or handkerchiefs. However, the bloodstain on the scene was smeared. As such, wiping at the scene was done within ten minutes after the incident. Only the murderer could achieve this.

“Why? This question is also simple. Like brother mentioned, because something unfavorable for the murderer remained on the ground. There’s only this reason for the murderer to wipe the floor immediately after the murder.

“How was it wiped? That, I don’t know. Even if it’s ‘ordinarily wiped,’ there are two methods—dry or with water. I compared these two methods.”

Risome pointed at the central smeared bloodstain and the faint right bloodstain, saying:

“This was wiped with a handkerchief, and that with a wet tissue. Sir, which one resembles the scene?”

“The one wiped with the handkerchief. It’s unmistakably closer.”

"The murderer wiped it dry?"

“Absolutely correct.”

Even with the compliment, Yuzuno's brother remained frowning. Was it so significant whether it was dry or wet?

Risome's finger moved to the water stains, as he continued:

“Now, look at this. This is a spot where I immediately wiped clear water with a handkerchief. The droplet was smeared like the blood, but as you see now, it couldn’t be completely cleaned. There are still clear traces on the carpet. Brother, were any of these traces left at the scene?”

“There wasn’t… but perhaps because a time lapse allowed it to dry.”

“Brother, I dripped these water droplets yesterday around noon.”

Yuzuno's brother shrugged, refraining from further argument. The police’s first search of the scene was only twelve hours after the incident. If moisture dropped twenty-four hours earlier hadn’t dried yet, similar marks should have been present on the crime scene floor.

“I still don’t quite grasp the purpose of your research. Could you summarize your conclusion directly?”

Sendou said, resembling a professor fed up with reading papers at a seminar. Risome raised three fingers—

The research proved three primary points:

1. Once liquid adheres to the library's carpet, it’s hard to wipe clean.
2. Moisture absorbed in the carpet remains undried twenty-four hours later.
3. The murderer wiped the floor.

“In other words?”

“In other words, my deduction has been confirmed. As such, all conditions needed to identify the murderer are now gathered.”

The inspector nodded in understanding, saying, “I see.” However, a moment later, his eyes widened. Yuzuno and her brother also raised their heads from staring at the floor.

“You… You mean you know who the murderer is?”

 “No, quite the contrary.”

“Ah?”

“I still don’t know who the murderer is. Honestly, I am at my wit’s end.”

The advisor retracted his earlier words, gently raising both hands. However, his lips lacked the sneer commonly seen when mocking the police.

“Quite the contrary… but didn’t you say all the conditions are complete?”

“They are indeed complete, all deduced based on facts, absolutely accurate axioms. However, compared with the conditions, it’s getting more and more confusing who the murderer is. It’s truly a bizarre case.”

“Have you narrowed it down to a few individuals, like in the aquarium case?”

Hearing Yuzuno ask, Risome responded:

“No one at present.”

He sat back at the table, resumed flipping through the dinosaur encyclopedia.

The other three exchanged looks of varying expressions. One found it incomprehensible, another acted clueless, while the last was greatly astonished. Though they hadn’t grasped the full situation, the murderer was as elusive as ever.

Quite the contrary—Risome had said the same thing yesterday: When things became visible, yet everything remained incomprehensible.

Whether it was the gymnasium case or the aquarium case, Risome always identified the murderer by eliminating suspects one at a time. Yet this time seems to be entirely different. The closer one gets, the further from the truth. The more you think, the deeper you sink into the bog. Fake books, Kunishima's intimidation, each fact was clear, yet the murderer's true identity remained veiled. Indeed, it might be a truly peculiar case.

Yuzuno sat beside Risome, propping up her face with her arm on the table. Before her was the vacant children's book section, and in this silence, the truth seemed to dissolve into wisps of smoke, disappearing amid the rows of book pages.

A girl with a backpack appeared on the other side of the bookshelf, accompanied by the sound of footsteps. It was the girl Yuzuno had seen earlier in the fiction section.

At the sight of Yuzuno and others sitting by the children’s table, she glanced curiously before turning to look at the reference shelf. It seemed she had already searched the books on the computer; comparing them with the notes on her paper, she found a book titled 'The Mysterious Universe' and returned to the counter with little footsteps. Perhaps she was doing a science class assignment? Her tiny figure disappearing among the bookshelves, carrying a backpack, was just as adorable as Little Red Riding Hood lost in a forest.

"Did Joumine-san also used to come to the library like that?" Yuzuno casually remarked.

Risome stood up silently.

He took a breath, bent forward as if to slump on the table, focusing intently on the girl's retreating figure. His eyes widened as though receiving a divine revelation. Deep black pupils. As dark as the night that could absorb everything.

Yuzuno felt she saw sparks like circuits and firework flashes within those dark depths. She knew these sparks intersected, converged, overlapped, and condensed on the dark foundation, forming some kind of thing in Risome's mind.

“Detective.”

Once the girl's figure was completely gone, he said with a flat tone:

“I know who the murderer is.”

“Ah?”

The inspector was once again stunned.

“But you just said you were at your wit's end?”

“I missed something fundamental, something very fundamental… Oh, yes, why didn’t I notice before? There’s a fifth condition.”
"In this way, there is only one person who fits perfectly."

"Are you sure you've figured it out?" her brother asked. "Do you have any evidence..."

"Evidence? No, I don't have any concrete evidence. But logic... a logic that is clear to everyone has provided the best answer. Each clue on its own is weak, but when all the clues are organically combined, they form an unshakable answer. The utility knife, the bloodstains at the scene... and that red message!"

Risome was as excited as if possessed, but he quickly regained his composure and shifted his gaze to the library bicycle parking lot outside the window.

"Detective, can you gather as many investigation personnel as possible right away?"

"I can, but..."

"Are you going to solve the mystery?" Yuzuno asked with some anticipation.

"No, there's something else that needs to be done first."

"Something else?"

"Yes." He seemed to have realized something and said, "We need to stop Arisa Jomine."

A character from "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer." There is a Japanese saying, "Lying is the beginning of theft."
