2. HALF-YEAR MANAGEMENT REPORT
A/ SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OF THE FIRST HALF OF 2024
A.1. FIRST-HALF OVERVIEW
During the first half of 2024, Sanofi continued to implement its “Play to Win” strategy, initiating the second phase which aims to launch major innovations, redeploy resources and
develop leading innovative R&D. Significant events connected with the implementation of that strategy are described below (for additional information on developments related to
Research and Development see also section “A.2. Research and Development”).
On January 9 2024, Brian Foard, a healthcare industry veteran and Sanofi leader in the United States, was named head of the Specialty Care Global Business Unit (GBU). With this
appointment, Brian became a member of Sanofi’s Executive Committee.
On February 1, 2024, Sanofi announced that François-Xavier Roger would be appointed Chief Financial Officer and a member of Sanofi’s Executive Committee effective April 1, 2024.
Based in Paris, he succeeds Jean-Baptiste Chasseloup de Chatillon, who has stepped down from his role to become Head of Apprentis d’Auteuil.
On May 10, 2024, as part of its commitment to developing a diverse portfolio of best-in-class vaccines, Sanofi announced that it had entered into a co-exclusive licensing agreement
with Novavax, a biotechnology company headquartered in Maryland, US. The terms of the agreement include (i) a co-exclusive license to co-commercialize Novavax’s current stand-
alone adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine worldwide (except in countries with existing Advance Purchase Agreements and in India, Japan, and South Korea, where Novavax has existing
partnership agreements); (ii) a sole license to Novavax’s adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine for use in combination with Sanofi’s flu vaccines; and (iii) a non-exclusive license to use the
Matrix-M adjuvant in vaccine products. In addition, Sanofi took a minority (<5%) equity investment in Novavax.
On May 13, 2024, as the largest private contributor to the security and independence of France's health ecosystem, Sanofi announced that it was increasing its investment in major
industrial projects by €1.1 billion, by creating new bioproduction capacity at its sites in Vitry-sur-Seine (Val de Marne), Le Trait (Seine-Maritime) and Lyon Gerland (Rhône). This new
investment will create more than 500 jobs and significantly strengthen France's ability to control the production of essential medicines from start to finish, for the present day and into
the future. This plan brings to more than €3.5 billion the amount committed by Sanofi since the COVID-19 pandemic to major projects to keep production of medicines and vaccines in
France for patients around the world.
On May 21, 2024, Sanofi announced a collaboration with Formation Bio and OpenAI to build AI-powered software to accelerate drug development and bring new medicines to patients
more efficiently. The three teams will bring together data, software and tuned models to develop custom, purpose-built solutions across the drug development lifecycle. This is the first
collaboration of its kind within the pharma and life sciences industries. Sanofi will leverage this partnership to provide access to proprietary data to develop AI models as it continues on
its path to becoming the first biopharma company powered by AI at scale.
On May 30, 2024, Sanofi announced that it had completed the acquisition of Inhibrx, Inc (Inhibrx), a publicly-traded, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a
pipeline of novel biologic therapeutic candidates in oncology and orphan diseases. The acquisition added SAR447537 (formerly INBRX-101) to Sanofi’s rare disease development
portfolio, and underscores the company’s commitment to developing differentiated, potentially best-in-class therapeutics, leveraging its existing strengths and capabilities. This
transaction followed on from Sanofi's January 23, 2024 announcement of a merger agreement under which Sanofi planned to acquire Inhibrx following the spin-off of its non-INBRX-
101 assets and liabilities into a new publicly-traded company ("New Inhibrx"). Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi agreed to (i) pay Inhibrx stockholders $30 per share of
Inhibrx common stock on closing of the merger (approximately $1.7 billion) and issue one contingent value right (CVR) per share of Inhibrx common stock, entitling its holder to receive a
deferred cash payment of $5, contingent upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones (approximately $0.3 billion, if those milestones are achieved); (ii) pay off Inhibrx’s
outstanding third-party debt (approximately $0.2 billion); and (iii) contribute capital to "New Inhibrx" (at least $0.2 billion). Since the closing of the merger, Sanofi has held 100% of the
equity interests in Inhibrx, which has become a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi. Additionally, Inhibrx retained a minority stake (approximately 8%) in "New Inhibrx".
On June 20, 2024, Sanofi and Biovac, a biopharmaceutical company based in Cape Town, South Africa, announced a local manufacturing partnership to produce inactivated polio
vaccines (IPV) in Africa. This agreement is designed to enable regional manufacturing of IPV to serve the potential needs of over 40 African countries. This partnership with Sanofi
makes Biovac the first African producer of IPV on and for the African continent, and supports the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s ambition to have 60% of local
vaccines produced in Africa by 2040.
On June 21 2024, Audrey Duval Derveloy, a seasoned healthcare industry leader and Sanofi France’s President, was named Executive Vice President, Global Head of Corporate Affairs.
Audrey became a member of Sanofi’s Executive Committee, reporting to CEO Paul Hudson, and is based in Paris. Her appointment was effective July 1, 2024.

37


Net sales for the first half of 2024 amounted to €21,209 million, 5.1% higher than in the first half of 2023. At constant exchange rates (CER) , net sales rose by 8.4%, driven mainly by
strong performances for Dupixent, increased sales of Nexviazyme, ALTUVIIIO, and Beyfortus.
Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi amounted to €2,246 million in the first half of 2024, versus €3,430 million in the first half of 2023. Earnings per share was €1.80,
versus €2.74 for the first half of 2023. Business net income
 was €4,380 million, down 10.2% on the first half of 2023, while business earnings per share (business EPS ) was €3.51,
10.0% lower than in the first half of 2023.
A.2. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
During the first half of 2024, Sanofi maintained its R&D efforts with the aim of improving quality of life for people around the globe by developing innovative vaccines and medicines.
Immunology
Dupixent (dupilumab) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 to 11 years, weighing at least 15 kg, with
eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). This approval expands the initial FDA approval for EoE in May 2022 for patients aged 12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg. The FDA evaluated
Dupixent for this expanded indication under Priority Review, which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious
conditions. Dupixent is now the first and only medicine approved in the US specifically indicated to treat these patients, and regulatory submission is currently under review by the
European Medicines Agency for this age group. The New England Journal of Medicine has published results from the positive Phase 3 study that was the basis for the FDA approval and
regulatory submission in Europe. The study showed a greater proportion of those receiving weight-tiered higher dose Dupixent experienced significant improvements in many key
disease measures of EoE, compared to placebo at week 16.
The FDA updated the label for Dupixent in atopic dermatitis, adding efficacy and safety data for patients aged 12 years and older with atopic dermatitis with uncontrolled moderate-to-
severe hand and/or foot involvement. These Phase 3 data are from the first and only trial evaluating a biologic specifically for this difficult-to-treat population and have also been
added to the Dupixent label in the European Union, with regulatory submissions underway in additional countries.
In July, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment for adults with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
characterized by raised blood eosinophils. This approval represents the sixth approved indication for Dupixent in the EU and seventh approved indication globally. The approval was
based on results from the landmark Phase 3 BOREAS and NOTUS studies, which were separately published in The New England Journal of Medicine and evaluated the efficacy and
safety of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Earlier in February, the US FDA accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics
License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent in this indication. In May, the agency extended by three months the target action date of its priority review of the sBLA; the revised target action
date is September 27, 2024. The FDA did not raise any concerns regarding the approvability of Dupixent for this indication. The FDA had requested additional efficacy analyses on the
efficacy of Dupixent in the BOREAS and NOTUS pivotal trials.
The FDA has accepted for Priority Review the sBLA for Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with inadequately controlled chronic
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). The target action date for the FDA decision is September 15, 2024. The sBLA in adolescents is supported by an extrapolation of efficacy
data from two positive pivotal studies (SINUS-24 and SINUS-52) in adults with CRSwNP. These studies demonstrated that Dupixent significantly improved nasal congestion/obstruction
severity, nasal polyp size and sense of smell, while also reducing the need for systemic corticosteroids or surgery, at 24 weeks compared to placebo. The sBLA was also supported by
the safety data of Dupixent in its currently approved indications for adolescents.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan has granted marketing and manufacturing authorization for Dupixent for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU) in people aged 12 years and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with existing therapy. Japan is the first country to approve Dupixent for CSU, emphasizing the value
of Dupixent as a novel treatment option to manage this disease in patients with unmet needs. Regulatory submissions are also under review in the European Union and China.
In June, the FDA approved the sBLA for the expanded use of Kevzara for treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in patients who weigh 63 kg or greater.
Rare diseases
Regulatory submissions for fitusiran for the treatment of hemophilia A or B in adults and adolescents with or without inhibitors have been completed in China, Brazil, and the US, with a
target action date for the FDA decision of March 28, 2025. The FDA granted fitusiran Breakthrough Therapy Designation for hemophilia B with inhibitors in December 2023. New ATLAS
Phase 3 study data reinforcing the potential of fitusiran to provide prophylaxis for people with hemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors were presented in June at the 32  Congress
of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH).

SANOFI 2021 HALF-YEAR FINANCIAL REPORT


In June, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for ALTUVOCT (ALTUVIIIO in the US, Japan, and Taiwan) for the treatment and prevention of bleeds and
perioperative prophylaxis in hemophilia A to Sanofi’s partner in the EU, Sobi. The EU also endorsed the retention of orphan designation, granting a ten-year market exclusivity period.
The FDA updated the label for ALTUVIIIO to include full results from the XTEND-Kids phase 3 study showing that once-weekly dosing with ALTUVIIIO delivers highly effective bleed
protection in children with hemophilia A. ALTUVIIIO was first approved in February 2023 for adults and children with hemophilia A for routine prophylaxis and on-demand treatment to
control bleeding episodes as well as for perioperative management (surgery), and this label update builds on the interim XTEND-Kids data from 2023 to include full results. Interim
results on the efficacy and safety of ALTUVIIIO from the XTEND-Kids phase 3 study were presented in June at the 32  Congress of the ISTH. Full results from the XTEND-Kids study
were published in July in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), highlighting the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profile of ALTUVIIIO.
Positive results from the LUNA 3 phase 3 study demonstrated that rilzabrutinib 400 mg twice daily orally achieved the primary endpoint of durable platelet response in adult patients
with persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The safety profile of rilzabrutinib was consistent with that reported in previous studies. Regulatory submission is planned for
the second half of 2024. Previously, rilzabrutinib was granted Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA.
The AMETHIST Phase 3 study of venglustat for the treatment of GM2 gangliosidosis was discontinued based on the absence of positive trends on clinical endpoints. The data
reinforced the favorable safety profile and did not impact the other indications currently being tested in Phase 3 studies (Fabry disease and Gaucher disease type 3).
Sanofi and Fulcrum Therapeutics entered into a collaboration and license agreement for the development and commercialization of losmapimod, a selective p38α/β mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) small molecule inhibitor being investigated in phase 3 for the treatment of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Losmapimod has orphan drug designation in
US, orphan designation in the EU, FDA fast track designation and FSHD is included on the list of rare diseases in China.
Neurology
Supported by encouraging efficacy and safety Phase 2 data, two Phase 3 studies, evaluating rilibrubart in standard-of-care (SOC)-refractory chronic inflammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy (CIDP) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)-treated CIDP, have been initiated and are currently recruiting patients.
Oncology
The FDA accepted for Priority Review the sBLA for the investigational use of Sarclisa (isatuximab) in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) for the
treatment of patients with transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). If approved, Sarclisa would be the first anti-CD38 therapy in combination with standard-of-
care VRd in newly diagnosed patients not eligible for transplant, which would be the third indication for Sarclisa in multiple myeloma. The target action date for the FDA decision is
September 27, 2024. Other regulatory submissions are currently under review in the EU, Japan, and China. Data from the IMROZ Phase 3 study demonstrated Sarclisa in combination
with standard-of-care (VRd) followed by Sarclisa-Rd (the IMROZ regimen) significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 40%, compared to VRd followed by Rd in
patients with NDMM not eligible for transplant. IMROZ is the first global Phase 3 study of an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody in combination with standard-of-care VRd to significantly
improve PFS and show deep responses in this patient population who often have poor prognoses.
Vaccines
In March, Beyfortus (nirsevimab) was approved in Japan for the prophylaxis of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in all neonates, infants
and children entering their first RSV season, and the prevention of RSV LRTD in neonates, infants and children at risk of serious RSV infection entering their first or second RSV season.
New Beyfortus real-world evidence data were published in The Lancet, showing Beyfortus substantially reduced RSV lower respiratory tract disease and hospitalizations in infants
during the 2023-2024 RSV season, versus no intervention. Results add to the consistent high efficacy of Beyfortus against medically attended RSV lower respiratory tract disease,
shown in the pivotal clinical studies and the outcomes from HARMONIE, a Phase 3b clinical study conducted in close to real-life conditions.
The Phase 3 study of MenQuadfi to protect infants from six weeks of age against invasive meningococcal disease caused by serogroups ACWY read out positively on safety and
immunogenicity, supporting regulatory submission in the US in the second half of 2024 to extend the indication down to six weeks of age.
The Phase 3 study evaluating SP0125, a live attenuated RSV vaccine for toddlers, for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in toddlers was initiated.
Sanofi and Novavax announced, in May, co-exclusive licensing agreement to co-commercialize COVID-19 vaccine and develop novel flu-COVID-19 combination vaccines.

B/ PROGRESS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY STRATEGY
Sanofi continues its progress to improve access to medicines
Sanofi Global Health Unit: making a difference for our patients in low- and middle-income countries
Sanofi’s Global Health Unit (GHU) works to address today’s many growing healthcare challenges – with a focus on countries with the highest unmet medical needs – through a self-
sustained not-for-profit social business model.
Sanofi’s GHU aims to provide access to a broad portfolio of medicines in 40 countries with the highest unmet medical needs. To that end the GHU created Impact, a unique not-for-
profit brand with 30 standard-of-care medicines produced by Sanofi, some of which are considered essential by the World Health Organization (WHO). The Impact medicines cover a
wide range of therapeutic areas including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, malaria and cancer.
Sanofi's GHU aims to reach two million people with non-communicable disease (NCD) care in its 40 countries in scope by 2030. Since its creation in 2021, the GHU has made
significant progress towards its objective, having already treated 506,130 NCD patients in 31 countries as of the end of March 2024.
To support the set up and development of sustainable healthcare systems, the GHU is also working closely with local communities, authorities and non-governmental organizations to
develop disease awareness programs and establish partnerships to drive better care through:
– strengthening supply chains;
– conducting medical training; and
– providing services to patients.
Sanofi's GHU has engaged with Ministries of Health and other partners in several countries, including Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania and Cambodia. As of March 2024, the GHU pilots 44

Cancer and work: Sanofi supporting health and wellbeing in the workplace
Sanofi has launched ‘Cancer & Work: Acting Together’, a program which covers all Sanofi employees in the world if they are diagnosed with cancer or critical illnesses . It provides
social, emotional and financial support and secures the job, salary and benefits of any employee for up to twelve months, no matter the role or geographical location.
It will allow employees to incorporate further flexible work arrangements to better navigate cancer and work and will have access to a network of volunteer colleagues trained to help
them navigate from initial diagnosis through the treatment journey and return to work. The program is also designed to better equip managers to support members of their team who
are affected by cancer. Throughout 2024, Sanofi also intends to implement coverage of miscellaneous non-medical expenses. Moreover, Sanofi permanent employees will become
eligible for an unpaid caregiver leave which allows them to carry out caregiving duties for their close family member suffering from a critical illness .
In 2017, several volunteer employees in France, with complementary expert skills and experience as patients, caregivers or managers, started the initiative. The program has since grown
to a network of 27 partner teams with one team at each Sanofi site in France, with 150 members who share feedback and best practice. More than 350 employees have benefited (42%
sick employees, 30% caregivers, 28% managers).
The program “Cancer & Work” has started to roll out globally in early 2024 and is part of our programs supporting health and wellbeing in the workplace. This complements other
initiatives already launched for employees such as the gender-neutral parental leave, allowing all new parents 14 weeks of paid leave to welcome a new child into their lives.
Sanofi continues its progress to limit its impact on the environment
Sanofi’s Planet Care strategy: concrete actions towards net zero emissions
For several years, Sanofi has been implementing its Planet Care strategy, aiming for net zero greenhouse gas emissions across all scopes by 2045, with an intermediate carbon
neutrality milestone in 2030. The company has already achieved a 43% decrease in scopes 1 and 2 emissions, targeting 55% by 2030, and a 10% reduction in scope 3 emissions,
aiming for 30% by 2030.
For scopes 1 and 2, Sanofi is focusing on the following key decarbonization levers to reach its 2030 targets:
•
Energy decarbonization: increasing renewable electricity share from 11% in 2019 to 85% in Q2 2024 through solar panels, power purchase agreements (PPA), and guarantees of
origin. In France, three PPAs have been signed with the Compagnie Nationale du Rhône, for an annual volume of 83 GWh/year over a twenty-year period, covering 19% of Sanofi’s
annual electricity needs in France. Sanofi also has a renewable electricity PPA in Mexico to supply energy to its three Mexican sites and is exploring PPAs opportunities in other
European countries and the US. Sanofi is also incorporating biomethane and biomass to reduce reliance on fossil fuels ;
•
Energy reduction and efficiency: aiming to reduce energy consumption by 15% in existing facilities by 2025 compared to 2021.
•
Eco-fleet: converting Sanofi’s car fleet to an 80% eco-fleet (biofuel, hybrid and electric vehicles) by 2030 ; and
•
Refrigerant gas: replacing existing refrigerant gases with lower global warming potential alternatives and improving leak prevention.
For scope 3, the majority of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions come from raw materials and subcontracting, thus representing the primary target for the decarbonization efforts. Sanofi's
eco-design program aims to integrate environmental criteria from product design. The company is seeking less carbon-intensive suppliers and considering the country of manufacture
in supplier selection. For example, sourcing of a highly carbon-intensive raw material from China has been reduced from over 50% of the volume in 2019 to just 5% in 2024, with a shift
to European suppliers. Additionally, Sanofi is implementing comprehensive measures to reduce emissions across multiple areas: addressing business travel and employee commuting
through remote work and low-carbon travel options, shifting from air to sea freight for product transport, setting ambitious waste management goals, and focusing on energy use.
Community-centric carbon offsetting
By 2045, the residual emissions will remain under 10% of the 2019 total emissions, in line with the Science Base Targets Initiative net zero commitment. Understanding that not all
emissions can be immediately abated, we also created a community-focused carbon offsetting program. These initiatives not only compensate for residual emissions but also generate
substantial environmental, social, and economic benefits in local communities.
Sanofi's carbon offsetting program has invested around €60 million in four strategic projects since 2019. These include the Sundari Mangrove Restoration project in India, which has
restored 380 hectares of mangroves since 2022 with plans to rehabilitate an additional 3,750 hectares. In Kenya, 18,250 energy-saving biomass cookstoves have been distributed. A
new project in Mozambique aims to rehabilitate 1,040 water handpumps, reducing the need to burn biomass for boiling water and providing clean water access to 312,000 people.
 Specific criteria identifying the conditions and circumstances that are eligible for coverage under this program might be governed by the terms and conditions of country-specific policies or legal requirements.

Business resilience to environmental changes
Sanofi is also actively working to strengthen its business resilience to environmental challenges which could impact its ability to support patients across the world. For instance, Sanofi
has undertaken an end-to-end internal study, in order to better identify the associations between environmental change impacts and pipeline of products.
Among its conclusions, the study reported that 70% of Sanofi’s portfolio indications and 78% of the R&D pipeline indications are already targeting diseases impacted by at least one
environmental hazard (air pollution, shift in seasonal patterns, chemical pollution, extreme temperatures, water pollution).

SANOFI 2024 HALF-YEAR FINANCIAL REPORT


D.1. SEGMENT INFORMATION
D.1.1. OPERATING SEGMENTS
In accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), the segment information reported by Sanofi is prepared on the basis of internal management data provided to our Chief Executive
Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker of Sanofi. The performance of those segments is monitored individually using internal reports and common indicators. The operating
segment disclosures required under IFRS 8 are provided in Note B.20. to the condensed half-year consolidated financial statements.
Sanofi reports two operating segments: Biopharma and Opella (formerly Consumer Healthcare – CHC).
The Biopharma operating segment comprises commercial operations and research, development and production activities relating to the Speciality Care, General Medicines and
Vaccines franchises, for all geographical territories. The segment’s results include the costs of global support functions that are not within the managerial responsibility of the Opella
GBU.
The Opella operating segment comprises commercial operations relating to consumer healthcare products, and research, development and production activities and global support
functions (as listed above) dedicated to the segment, for all geographical territories. The Opella GBU segment’s results reflect all incurred costs of global support functions attributable
to its business.
The “Other” category comprises reconciling items, primarily but not limited to (i) gains and losses on centralized foreign exchange risk hedging transactions that cannot be allocated to
the operating segments and (ii) gains and losses on retained commitments in respect of previously divested operations.
D.1.2. BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME
We report segment results on the basis of “Business operating income”. This indicator is used internally by Sanofi’s chief operating decision maker to measure the performance of each
operating segment and to allocate resources. For a definition of “Business operating income”, and a reconciliation between that indicator and Income before tax and investments
accounted for using the equity method, refer to Note B.20.1.2. to our condensed half-year consolidated financial statements.
In the first half of 2024, “Business operating income” amounted to €5,656 million (versus €6,059 million for the first half of 2023), while “Business operating income margin” was
26.7% (versus 30.0% for the first half of 2023). “Business operating income margin” is a non-IFRS financial measure that we define as the ratio of “Business net income” to our
consolidated net sales.
Because our “Business operating income” and “Business operating income margin” are not standardized measures, they may not be directly comparable with the non-IFRS financial
measures of other companies using the same or similar non-IFRS financial measures. Despite the use of non-IFRS measures by management in setting goals and measuring
performance, these are non-IFRS measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS.
D.2. BUSINESS NET INCOME
We believe that understanding of our operational performance by our management and our investors is enhanced by reporting “Business net income”. This non-IFRS financial measure
represents “Business operating income”, less net financial expenses and the relevant income tax effects.
“Business net income” for the first half of 2024 amounted to €4,380 million, 10.2% less than in the first half of 2023 (€4,876 million). That represents 20.7% of net sales, versus 24.2%
for the first half of 2023.
We also report “Business earnings per share” (business EPS), a non-IFRS financial measure which we define as business net income divided by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding.
Business EPS was €3.51 for the first half of 2024, 10.0% lower than the 2023 first-half figure of €3.90, based on an average number of shares outstanding of 1,249.4 million for the
first half of 2024 and 1,249.9 million for the first half of 2023.

(a)     For the six months ended June 30, 2024, this line corresponds to a net reversal of impairment losses amounting to €371 million, mainly due to an increase in the expected recoverable amounts of certain marketed
products and other rights in the Biopharma segment.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, this line mainly comprised an impairment loss of €833 million, reflecting the impact of the strategic decision to de-prioritize certain R&D programs, in particular those related to the NK
Cell and PRO-XTEN technology platforms.
(b) For the six months ended December 31, 2024, “Other gains and losses, and litigation” is a charge of €442 million, mainly comprising a provision recognized in respect of the litigation related to Plavix (clopidogrel) in the
US state of Hawaii (see note B.14.). That compares with a charge of €73 million in the first half of 2023, which comprised costs related to the settlement of a dispute with shareholders of Bioverativ.
(c)     This line corresponds to the financial expense arising from remeasurement of the financial liability recognized in the balance sheet to reflect estimated future royalties on sales of Beyfortus in the United States.
(d) This line mainly comprise costs relating to severance plans announced by Sanofi. Restructuring costs also include Sanofi's ongoing transformation projects, mainly those relating to the separation of the Opella business.
(e)     For the year ended December 31, 2023, this amount corresponds to the deferred tax liability recognized in respect of investments in consolidated entities in light of the proposed separation of the Opella business in the
fourth quarter of 2024 at the earliest.
(f)     This line includes the share of profits/losses arising from the equity-accounted investment in EUROAPI, including an impairment loss taken against the equity interests based on the quoted market price: €2.55 euros as
of June 30, 2024, €10.50 as of June 30, 2023, and €5.73 as of December 31, 2023.
The most significant reconciling items between “Business net income” and Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi relate to (i) the purchase accounting effects of our
acquisitions and business combinations, particularly the amortization and impairment of intangible assets (other than software and other rights of an industrial or operational nature) and
(ii) the impacts of

(c)

SANOFI 2024 HALF-YEAR FINANCIAL REPORT


restructurings or transactions regarded as non-recurring, where the amounts involved are particularly significant. We believe that excluding those impacts enhances an investor’s
understanding of our underlying economic performance, because it gives a better representation of our recurring operating performance.
We believe that eliminating charges related to the purchase accounting effect of our acquisitions and business combinations (particularly amortization and impairment of some
intangible assets) enhances comparability of our ongoing operating performance relative to our peers.
We also believe that eliminating the other effects of business combinations (such as the incremental cost of sales arising from the workdown of acquired inventories remeasured at fair
value in business combinations) gives a better understanding of our recurring operating performance.
Eliminating restructuring costs and similar items enhances comparability with our peers because those costs are incurred in connection with reorganization and transformation
processes intended to optimize our operations.
Finally, we believe that eliminating the effects of transactions that we regard as non-recurring and that involve particularly significant amounts (such as major gains and losses on
disposals, and costs and provisions associated with major litigation and other major non-recurring items) improves comparability from one period to the next.
We remind investors, however, that “Business net income” should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi
reported in accordance with IFRS. In addition, we strongly encourage investors and potential investors not to rely on any single financial measure but to review our financial statements,
including the notes thereto, carefully and in their entirety.
We compensate for the material limitations described above by using “Business net income” only to supplement our IFRS financial reporting and by ensuring that our disclosures
provide sufficient information for a full understanding of all adjustments included in “Business net income”.
Because our “Business net income” and “Business EPS” are not standardized measures, they may not be directly comparable with the non-IFRS financial measures of other companies
using the same or similar non-IFRS financial measures.
D.3. NET SALES
Net sales for the first half of 2024 amounted to €21,209 million, 5.1% higher than in the first half of 2023. Exchange rate fluctuations had a negative effect of 3.3 percentage points
overall, due mainly to adverse trends in the euro exchange rate against the Argentinean peso, Turkish lira and Japanese yen. At constant exchange rates (CER, see definition below), net
sales rose by 8.4%, driven mainly by strong performances for Dupixent, increased sales of Nexviazyme, ALTUVIIIO, and Beyfortus.

SANOFI 2024 HALF-YEAR FINANCIAL REPORT


D.3.3. BIOPHARMA SEGMENT
The Biopharma segment includes Pharma and Vaccines. Net sales increased by 8.3% CER and by 5.2% on a reported basis to €18,378 million, driven by Dupixent and new Pharma
launches.
Comments on the performances of our major Biopharma segment products are provided below.
PHARMA
Immunology
Dupixent (collaboration with Regeneron) generated net sales of €6,138 million in the first half of 2024, up 25.8% on a reported basis and 27.1% at constant exchange rates. In the
United States, sales of Dupixent reached €4,437 million in the first half of 2024, driven by continuing strong demand in the product’s approved indications: atopic dermatitis (AD),
asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis, and prurigo nodularis. In Europe, the product’s net sales for the first half of 2024 totaled €770
million, up 31.2% CER, driven by continuing growth in AD, asthma and CRSwNP. In the Rest of the World region, Dupixent posted net sales of €931 million (+63.9% CER), driven mainly
by Japan and China.
Pharma launches
Nexviazyme/Nexviadyme (Pompe disease) sales were €320 million (including €174 million in the United States), up 73.9% year-on-year, driven by switches from Myozyme/Lumizyme
in the eligible late-onset Pompe disease population and by an increase in new patients. Total sales for the Pompe franchise (Nexviazyme/Nexviadyme + Myozyme/Lumizyme)
reached €691 million. Nexviazyme/Nexviadyme now account for 46% of total Pompe franchise sales.
ALTUVIIIO (hemophilia A) generated sales of €280 million in the first half of 2024, predominantly in the United States where growth was driven by patient switches from factor-
based treatments other than Eloctate. Sales also benefited from supplies to Sanofi’s partner in Europe, where the medicine obtained regulatory approval. Total hemophilia A
franchise sales (ALTUVIIIO + Eloctate) amounted to €471 million (+76% versus the first half of 2023) representing an increase in Sanofi’s market share of factor-based treatments
as well as of the overall hemophilia A market.
Sarclisa (multiple myeloma) reported sales of €227 million in the first half of 2024, up 32.6% CER, driven by strong growth in all three regions. Sales reached €100 million in the
United States (+31.6% CER), €64 million in Europe (+14.3% CER), and €63 million in the Rest of the World region (+55.1% CER).
Sales of Rezurock (chronic graft-versus-host disease) were €207 million in the first half of 2024, an increase of 46.8%, driven by improved patient adherence and new patients
(primarily in the United States), and by new launches in China and the UK.
Cablivi (acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) reported 2024 first-half sales of €113 million (+0.9% CER), including €60 million (+3.4% CER) in the United States and
€43 million (-12.2% CER) in Europe.
Xenpozyme (acid sphingomyelinase deficiency) achieved sales of €72 million in the first half of 2024, mainly in the United States.
Enjaymo (cold agglutinin disease) posted sales of €55 million, mainly from the United States and Japan.
Sales of Tzield (delayed onset of type 1 diabetes) amounted to €21 million. As expected, sales are on a gradual uptrend, driven by a higher number of infusions supported by increased
awareness and screening. Efforts to increase knowledge and updates to disease guidelines will support long-term growth.
 OTHER MAIN MEDICINES
Lantus sales remained steady at €758 million (+0.6% CER) in the first half of 2024. In the United States, sales were up 50.0% CER, as volumes rose following the withdrawal of a
competing medicine from the market. In the Rest of the World region, sales were down by 16.1% CER, mainly due to the strategy of switching to Toujeo in China.
Toujeo sales increased by 14.5% CER to €634 million, driven by China, where the product’s market share now exceeds that of Lantus. Sales were stable in the United States, mainly due
to the withdrawal of a competing medicine.
Lovenox sales decreased by 9.6% CER to €518 million, reflecting an impact from VBP (volume-based procurement) in China as well as biosimilar competition in Europe.
Sales of the Fabry disease treatment Fabrazyme reached €526 million in the first half of 2024 (+10.1% CER), propelled by the Rest of World region.
Plavix sales were up 4.4% CER at €473 million, underpinned by use in the Rest of the World.
Cerezyme sales rose by 21.2% CER to €407 million, reflecting growth in high-inflation countries (Argentina and Turkey) included in the Rest of the World region.
Sales of Myozyme/Lumizyme (Pompe disease) decreased by 12.6% CER in the first half of 2024 to €371 million, reflecting switches to Nexviazyme/Nexviadyme as mentioned above.
in the first half of 2024, sales of Alprolix (indicated for the treatment of hemophilia B) amounted to €271 million, an increase of 5.0% CER, driven by the United States.

First-half net sales of Praluent reached €247 million CER, an increase of 31.7%, thanks largely to Europe and China.
Thymoglobulin sales rose by 5.3% in the first half year of 2024 to €246 million, driven by the United States.
Sales of Aubagio were down 66.1% CER at €209 million, reflecting the loss of exclusivity in the United States in March 2023 and competition from generics across all regions, including
Europe where generics entered the market at end September 2023. The negative impact is anticipated to lessen during the rest of 2024 as the effects of loss of exclusivity annualize.
Eloctate, indicated in the treatment of hemophilia A, posted sales of €191 million in the first half of 2024, down 21.4% CER, reflecting the conversion to ALTUVIIIO.
Cerdelga sales were €165 million, up 11.3%, underpinned by continued growth in the United States and Europe.
VACCINES
In the first half of 2024, Vaccines sales were down 3.0% on a reported basis but up 0.3% CER, at €2,319 million. Sales reflected a strong start for Beyfortus, which offset the absence
of COVID-19 vaccine sales in the period (versus €226 million in first half of 2023).
Sales of Polio/Pertussis/Hib (PPH) Vaccines, including Boosters, decreased by 2.9% to €1,348 million. Growth in Europe, sustained by better sales performance and favorable phasing,
was partly offset by declining sales in the United States, where Vaxelis became market leader in the three-dose primary series market for infants at the end of 2023. Vaxelis sales in the
United States are not consolidated by Sanofi, but profits are shared equally between Sanofi and Merck & Co.
Meningitis, Travel and Endemics Vaccines sales increased by 3.9% CER to €582 million, reflecting increased penetration of MenQuadfi in Europe.
Beyfortus sales reached €200 million in the first half of 2024, reflecting late deliveries in the United States and implementation of “All Infant Protection” programs in some Australian
states and Chile.
Sales of Influenza Vaccines reached €188 million, up 27.2% CER, benefiting from higher public tender sales in Latin America.

In the first half of 2024, net sales in the United States reached €9,067 million, up 13.5% on a reported basis and 13.4% at constant exchange rates. The impacts of strong growth for
Dupixent, plus Pharma launches and additional Beyfortus deliveries, were partially offset by the impact of generic competition on Aubagio.
In Europe, 2024 first-half net sales decreased by 3.0% on a reported basis and 3.2% at constant exchange rates, to €4,882 million; the impact of generic competition on Aubagio and a
high comparative base for Vaccines (due to COVID-19 vaccine sales recorded in the first half of 2023) more than offset a strong performance from Dupixent.
In the Rest of the World region, first-half net sales were up 1.3% on a reported basis and 11.0% at constant exchange rates at €7,260 million, driven mainly by Dupixent, the launch of
Beyfortus in two Southern Hemisphere countries, and Opella. Sales in China increased by 2.8% CER to €1,522 million driven by Dupixent, Toujeo and Plavix.

D.4. OTHER INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS
D.4.1. OTHER REVENUES
Other revenues decreased by 5.1% to €1,289 million in the first half of 2024 (versus €1,358 million in the first half of 2023). This decline is explained in particular by the absence of
COVID-19 sales in 2024, which represented €94 million in the first half of 2023.
This line item also includes VaxServe sales of non-Sanofi products, amounting to €854 million (versus €835 million in the first half of 2023).
D.4.2. GROSS PROFIT
Gross profit for the first half of 2024 was €15,649 million, versus €15,198 million for the first half of 2023, a rise of 3.0%.
The gross margin ratio decreased by 1.4 percentage points to 73.9% compared with the first half of 2023. The main factors were a fall in the Opella gross margin ratio from 66.1% to
63.1% due to product and country mix, and unfavorable trends in exchange rates.
The Biopharma gross margin ratio decreased from 76.8% to 75.5% due to changes in product mix (lower sales of Aubagio, and COVID-19 sales booked in 2023), and unfavorable
trends in exchange rates.
D.4.3. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES
Research and development expenses (R&D expenses) in the first half of 2024 totaled €3,423 million (versus €3,193 million in the first half of 2023). That represents 16.1% of net sales,
compared with 15.8% in the first half of 2023. R&D expenses rose by 7.2%, reflecting increased expenses in Vaccines (mRNA) and Pharma (pipeline acceleration).
D.4.4. SELLING AND GENERAL EXPENSES
Selling and general expenses amounted to €5,260 million in the first half of 2024 (24.8% of net sales), versus €5,182 million in the first half of 2023 (25.7% of net sales); this 1.5%
year-on-year increase reflected higher commercial spend and launch costs in the Biopharma segment, and increased selling expenses in the Opella segment.
The ratio of selling and general expenses to net sales was 0.9 of a percentage point lower than in the first half of 2023, at 24.8%.
D.4.5. OTHER OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES
In the first half of 2024, Other operating income amounted to €617 million, stable versus the first half of 2023), and Other operating expenses to €2,010 million (versus €1,422 million
in the first half of 2023).
Overall, other operating income and expenses represented a net expense of €1,393 million in the first half of 2024, compared with a net expense of €805 million in the first half of
2023.

Other operating income and expenses (net) also includes gains on divestments of assets and operations totaling €389 million, mainly related to portfolio rationalization (versus €413
million for the first half of 2023).
D.4.6. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Amortization charged against intangible assets in the first half of 2024 amounted to €1,061 million, versus €1,035 million in the first half of 2023. This rise was mainly driven by
amortization of the intangible assets acquired through acquisitions and alliances during 2023, with the impact partly offset by some intangible assets reaching the end of their
amortization periods.
D.4.7. IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The results of impairment tests on other intangible assets led to the recognition of a net reversal of impairment losses amounting to €371 million in the first half of 2024, mainly due to
an increase in the expected recoverable amounts of certain marketed products and other rights in the Biopharma segment.
The comparative for the first half of 2023 was a net impairment loss of €15 million.
D.4.8. FAIR VALUE REMEASUREMENT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION
Fair value remeasurements of contingent consideration assets and liabilities relating to business combinations (recognized in accordance with IFRS 3) represented a net expense of €66
million in the first half of 2024, versus a net expense of €26 million in the first half of 2023.
D.4.9. RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND SIMILAR ITEMS
Restructuring costs and similar items amounted to a charge of €1,331 million in the first half of 2024, compared with a charge of €547 million in the first half of 2023.
Restructuring and similar costs increased by €784 million between June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024. They mainly comprise costs relating to severance plans announced in the first half
of 2024. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023, they included the impact of pension reform in France on future annuities under the rules of
each severance plan. Restructuring costs also include Sanofi's ongoing transformation projects, mainly those relating to the separation of the Opella business.
D.4.10. OTHER GAINS AND LOSSES, AND LITIGATION
For the first half of 2024, Other gains and losses, and litigation is a charge of €442 million, mainly comprising a provision recognized in respect of the litigation related to Plavix
(clopidogrel) in the US state of Hawaii (see note B.14.). That compares with a charge of €73 million in the first half of 2023, which comprised costs related to the settlement of a
dispute with shareholders of Bioverativ.
D.4.11. OPERATING INCOME
Operating income amounted to €3,044 million in the first half of 2024, versus €4,322 million in the first half of 2023. The year-on-year change was mainly due to increases in
Restructuring costs and similar items and Other gains and losses, and litigation.

SANOFI 2024 HALF-YEAR FINANCIAL REPORT


D.4.12. FINANCIAL INCOME AND EXPENSES
Net financial expenses were €305 million for the first half of 2024, €221 million higher than the 2023 first-half figure of €84 million. The 2024 first-half amount includes a financial
expense of €176 million (€35 million for the first half of 2023) in respect of the remeasurement of the liability recorded in the balance sheet for estimated future royalties on Beyfortus
sales in the US.
Our cost of net debt (see the definition in Section D.7., “Consolidated balance sheet” below) was €66 million in the first half of 2024; that compares with net interest income of €25
million in the first half of 2023.
D.4.13. INCOME BEFORE TAX AND INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD
Income before tax and investments accounted for using the equity method for the first half of 2024 was €2,739 million, versus €4,238 million for the first half of 2023.
D.4.14. INCOME TAX EXPENSE
Income tax expense totaled €463 million in the first half of 2024, versus €730 million in the first half of 2023, giving an effective tax rate (based on consolidated net income) of 16.9%,
versus 17.3% in the first half of 2023. The reduction in income tax expense was mainly due to a year-on-year increase in restructuring costs relating to severance plans announced in
the first half of 2024 and to Sanofi’s ongoing transformation projects (€408 million in the first half of 2024, versus €157 million in the first half of 2023). It also reflects the tax effects
of amortization and impairment of intangible assets (€96 million in the first half of 2024, versus €226 million in the first half of 2023) and tax effects relating to contingencies arising
from business divestitures.
The effective tax rate on our “Business net income”  is a non-IFRS financial measure. It is calculated on the basis of business operating income, minus net financial expenses and
before (i) the share of profit/loss from investments accounted for using the equity method and (ii) net income attributable to non-controlling interests. We believe the presentation of
this measure, used by our management, is also useful for investors as it provides a mean of analyzing the effective tax cost of our current business activities. It should not be seen as a
substitute for the effective tax rate based on consolidated net income.
When calculated on business net income, our effective tax rate was 21.0% in the first half of 2024, compared with 19.0% in the first half of 2023 and 18.8% for 2023 as a whole. The
main factor in this year-on-year change was the impact of the OECD Pillar Two model rules, which aim to ensure that large multinationals pay a minimum level of tax on the income
arising in each jurisdiction where they operate.
D.4.15. SHARE OF PROFIT/(LOSS) FROM INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD
Share of profit/(loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method amounted to a net loss of €13 million in the first half of 2024, versus a net loss of €52 million in the
comparable period of 2023. This line item includes the share of profits generated by Vaxelis.
D.4.16. NET INCOME
Net income amounted to €2,263 million in the first half of 2024, versus €3,456 million in the first half of 2023.
D.4.17. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS
Net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the first half of 2024 was €17 million, against €26 million for the first half of 2023.
D.4.18. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY HOLDERS OF SANOFI
Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi amounted to €2,246 million in the first half of 2024, versus €3,430 million in the first half of 2023.
Basic earnings per share (EPS) was €1.80, compared with €2.74 for the first half of 2023, based on an average number of shares outstanding of 1,249.4 million for the first half of 2024
and 1,249.9 million for the first half of 2023. Diluted earnings per share was €1.79, versus €2.73 for the first half of 2023, based on an average number of shares after dilution of
1,253.8 million for the first half of 2024 and 1,254.5 million for the first half of 2023.
 See definition in section D.2., “Business net income”.

D.5. SEGMENT RESULTS
In the first half of 2024, our “Business operating income” (see Note B.20.1. to our condensed half-year consolidated financial statements for a definition and further details) was €5,656

Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities represented a net cash inflow of €1,423 million in the first half of 2024, against €3,563 million in the first half of 2023.
Operating cash flow before changes in working capital for the first half of 2024 was €4,064 million, versus €4,382 million in the first half of 2023.
Working capital requirements decreased by €2,641 million in the first half of 2024 (versus a decrease of €819 million in the first half of 2023), due mainly to the reduction in provisions
for rebates in the US, a consequence of the reduction in the list price of Lantus from January 1, 2024.
Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities represented a net cash outflow of €3,413 million in the first half of 2024, due mainly to the acquisition of Inhibrx, Inc. for €1,884
million (see Note B.1. to our condensed half-year consolidated financial statements). That compares with a net cash outflow of €3,073 million in the first half of 2023, resulting mainly
from the acquisition of Provention Bio, Inc. for €2,465 million.
Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets totaled €1,886 million, versus €930 million in the first half of 2023. There were €950 million of acquisitions of
property, plant and equipment (versus €782 million in the first half of 2023), most of which (€882 million) were in the Biopharma segment, primarily in industrial facilities. Acquisitions of
intangible assets (€936 million, versus €148 million in the first half of 2023) mainly comprised contractual payments for intangible rights, primarily under license and collaboration
agreements (in particular Novavax, for €463 million).
After-tax proceeds from disposals (excluding disposals of consolidated entities and investments in joint ventures and associates) amounted to €607 million in the first half of 2024,
compared with €578 million for the first half of 2023, and related mainly to divestments of assets and operations relating to portfolio streamlining and disposals of equity and debt
instruments.
Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities represented a net cash inflow of €89 million in the first half of 2024, compared with a net outflow of €5,214 million in the first half
of 2023. The 2024 first-half figure includes (i) the dividend payout to our shareholders of €4,704 million (versus €4,454 million in the first half of 2023); (ii) €5,105 million of net
external debt contracted (versus net external debt reimbursed of €376 million in the first half of  2023); and (iii) movements in Sanofi’s share capital (purchases and disposals of
treasury shares, net of capital increases) representing a net outflow of €281 million (compared with a net outflow of €332 million in the first half of 2023).
The net change in cash and cash equivalents in the first half of 2024 was a decrease of €1,915 million, compared with a decrease of €4,743 million in the first half of 2023.
“Free cash flow” is a non-IFRS financial measure which is reviewed by our management, and which we believe provides useful information to measure the net cash generated from the

ts ), for debt repayment, and for payments to shareholders. “Free cash flow” is determined from business net income
 after adding back (in the case of expenses and losses) or
deducting (in the case of income and gains) the following items: depreciation, amortization and impairment, share of undistributed earnings from investments accounted for using the
equity method, gains & losses on disposals of non-current assets, net change in provisions (including pensions and other post-employment benefits), deferred taxes, share-based
payment expense and other non-cash items. It also includes net changes in working capital, capital expenditures and other asset acquisitions
 net of disposal proceeds
 and payments
related to restructuring and similar items. “Free cash flow” is not defined by IFRS, and is not a substitute for Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities as reported under
IFRS. Management recognizes that the term “Free cash flow” may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances.

D.7. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET
Total assets were €129,755 million as of June 30, 2024, versus €126,464 million as of December 31, 2023, representing an increase of €3,291 million.
Net debt was €15,112 million as of June 30, 2024, versus €7,793 million as of December 31, 2023. We believe the presentation of this non-IFRS financial measure, which is reviewed by
our management, provides useful information to measure our overall liquidity and capital resources. We define “net debt” as (i) the sum total of short-term debt, long-term debt, and
interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives used to manage debt, minus (ii) the sum total of cash and cash equivalents and interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives used
to manage cash and cash equivalents.

(a) Net debt does not include lease liabilities, which amounted to €2,012 million as of June 30, 2024 and €2,030 million as of December 31, 2023.
To assess our financing risk, we use the “gearing ratio”, another non-IFRS financial measure. This ratio (which we define as the ratio of net debt to total equity) rose from 10.5% as of
December 31, 2023 to 20.7% as of June 30, 2024. Analyses of our debt as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are provided in Note B.9. to the condensed half-year consolidated
financial statements.
Because our “net debt” and “gearing ratio” are not standardized measures, they may not be directly comparable with the non-IFRS financial measures of other companies using the
same or similar non-IFRS financial measures. Despite the use of non-GAAP measures by management in setting goals and measuring performance, these measures have no
standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS.
We expect that the future cash flows generated by our operating activities will be sufficient to repay our debt. The financing arrangements in place as of June 30, 2024 at the Sanofi
parent company level are not subject to covenants regarding financial ratios and do not contain any clauses linking credit spreads or fees to Sanofi’s credit rating.
Other key movements in the balance sheet are described below.
Total equity was €72,997 million as of June 30, 2024, versus €74,353 million as of December 31, 2023. The net change reflects the following principal factors:
•
an increase representing our net income for the first half of 2024 (€2,263 million);
•
an increase of €1,040 million due to currency translation differences arising on the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, mainly due to movements in the US dollar; and
•
a decrease representing the dividend payout to our shareholders of €4,704 million.
As of June 30, 2024 we held 15.33 million of our own shares, recorded as a deduction from equity and representing 1.211% of our share capital.
Goodwill and Other intangible assets (€76,733 million in total) increased by €3,010 million, the main factors being our acquisition of Inhibrx, Inc. (impact: €1,766 million) and our May
2024 agreement with Novavax (impact: €463 million).
Investments accounted for using the equity method (€315 million) decreased by €109 million, including the recognition of an €11 million impairment loss on the investment in EUROAPI
based on that entity’s quoted market price as of June 30, 2024 (€2.55).
Other non-current assets (€3,333 million) decreased by €115 million.
Net deferred tax assets were €5,484 million as of June 30, 2024, compared with €4,477 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of €1,007 million.
Non-current provisions and other non-current liabilities (€8,219 million) increased by €617 million relative to December 31, 2023. This variation is explained mainly by the recognition
of provisions for restructuring programs and for litigation.
Liabilities related to business combinations and to non-controlling interests (€728 million) increased by €19 million.

E/ RISK FACTORS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
E.1. RISK FACTORS
The main risk factors to which Sanofi is exposed are described in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission on February 23, 2024 .
Any of those risks, and others that we may not yet have identified, could materialize during the second half of 2024 or during subsequent periods, and could cause actual results to
differ materially from those described elsewhere in this report.
E.2. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Our principal related parties are defined in Note D.33. to the consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F (page F-91) .
Note B.5. to the condensed half-year consolidated financial statements provides a description of the main transactions and balances for the six months ended June 30, 2024 with
equity-accounted entities that qualify as related parties.
Sanofi did not enter into any transactions with key management personnel during the first half of 2024.
Financial relations with the Group’s principal shareholders fall within the ordinary course of business and were immaterial in the first half of 2024.

F/ OUTLOOK
At constant exchange rates, we expect full-year 2024 business earnings per share  (business EPS) to be stable, an upgrade from the low single-digit percentage decrease previously
expected, underpinned by accelerated delivery of Sanofi’s pipeline-driven transformation. Applying average July 2024 exchange rates, the currency impact on 2024 business EPS is
c.-5.5% to -6.5%.
Full-year business net income
for 2023 was €10,155 million, giving business earnings per share of €8.11.
This guidance was prepared on a basis comparable with that used to prepare our historical financial information, and in accordance with Sanofi accounting policies. It was also prepared
on the basis of assumptions established by Sanofi and its subsidiaries, including but not limited to:
•
trends in the competitive environment, in terms of innovative products and launches of generics;
•
respect for our intellectual property rights;
•
progress on our research and development programs;
•
the impact of, and progress on, our operating cost containment policy;
•
trends in exchange rates and interest rates;
•
integration of the contribution from acquisitions; and
•
the average number of shares outstanding.
Some of the above information, estimates and assumptions are derived from or rely on, in full or in part, judgments and decisions made by Sanofi management which may change or be
amended in future.

are not historical facts. These statements include projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions, statements regarding plans, objectives, intentions, and expectations with
respect to future financial results, events, operations, services, product development and potential, and statements regarding future performance. Words such as “believe”, “anticipate”,
“can”, “contemplate”, “could”, “plan”, “expect”, “intend”, “is designed to”, “may”, “might”, “plan”, “potential”, “objective” “target”, “estimate”, “project”, “predict”, “forecast”,
“ambition”, “guideline”, “should”, “will”, or the negative of these and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of

forward-looking information and statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Sanofi, that could
cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements.
These risks and uncertainties include among other things, the uncertainties inherent in research and development, future clinical data and analysis, including post marketing, decisions
by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA or the EMA, regarding whether and when to approve any marketing application or filing in respect of any drug, device or biological product for
any such product candidates as well as their decisions regarding labelling and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of such product candidates, the
fact that product candidates if approved may not be commercially successful, the future approval and commercial success of therapeutic alternatives, Sanofi’s ability to benefit from
external growth opportunities, to complete related transactions and/or obtain regulatory clearances, risks associated with intellectual property and any related pending or future
litigation and the ultimate outcome of such litigation, trends in exchange rates and interest rates, cost containment initiatives and subsequent changes thereto, the average number of
shares outstanding, the impact that pandemics of any other global crisis may have on us, our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and the financial condition of
any one of them, as well as on our employees and on the global economy as a whole. The situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise of which we are not currently
aware and may exacerbate other previously identified risks. The risks and uncertainties also include the uncertainties discussed or identified in the public filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) made by Sanofi, including those listed under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” in Sanofi’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023. For an update on litigation, refer to Note B.14. “Legal and arbitration
proceedings” to our condensed half-year consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and to section “A.3.2. Legal and arbitration proceedings”, and

3. STATUTORY AUDITORS’ REVIEW REPORT ON THE HALF-
YEARLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Period from January 1 to June 30, 2024
To the Shareholders,
In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your Annual General Meetings and in accordance with the requirements of article L. 451-1-2 III of the French Monetary and
Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier), we hereby report to you on:
•
the review of the accompanying (condensed) half-yearly consolidated financial statements of Sanofi, for the period from January 1, 2024 to June 30, 2024;
•
the verification of the information presented in the half-yearly management report.
These condensed half-yearly consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Board of Directors. Our role is to express a conclusion on these financial statements based
on our review.
1.
Conclusion on the financial statements
We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in France.
A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and consequently does not enable us to
obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed half-yearly consolidated financial statements are not prepared, in
all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 – standard of the IFRSs as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial information.
2.     Specific verification
We have also verified the information presented in the half-yearly management report on the condensed half-yearly consolidated financial statements subject to our review.
We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and consistency with the condensed half-yearly consolidated financial statements.
