FOREWORD 
In 2022, the Asia-Pacific region experienced unprecedented weather catastrophes such as heat 
waves and droughts, typhoons, and floods that resulted in substantial human and economic 
losses and eroded hard-won development gains. Evidence is mounting that the severity and 
frequency of such catastrophes are increasing due to climate change, which is serving as a 
“threat multiplier” for existing social, political, and economic challenges.  
These challenges have been further exacerbated by the ongoing war in Ukraine which caused a 
“polycrisis” related to food, energy, and finance, with cascading multifaceted effects on the 
global economy already severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To effectively respond to 
these crises – Covid, conflict and climate change – and to rebuild our economies in a manner consistent with the 
ambitions of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Paris Agreement on climate change, substantial financial 
resources are needed. But it is also clear that, alarmingly, the gap between the resources required and those currently 
available is substantial and growing. To close this gap, especially to address climate change, the participation and 
commitment of all relevant stakeholders – governments, regulators, and private finance – is urgently needed.  
The Asia-Pacific region is not on track to meet the SDGs by 2030 nor achieve climate ambitions, with current financial 
requirements far exceeding available resources. Thus, inaction to raise sufficient additional financing, or to channel 
available resources in support of SDGs and climate action, is not an option anymore. It is time for all stakeholders to 
commit to accelerated change by committing to net zero emissions and transforming their financing priorities, processes, 
and programs to meet the growing financing needs of the region.  
This report focuses on sustainable finance, which, in a broader sense, refers to the financing of sustainable activities as 
well as finance that is sustainably managed. In this vein, the report examines the trends, challenges, and opportunities 
that policymakers, regulators, and private finance (banks, issuers, and investors) in Asia and the Pacific face to mobilize 
and deploy sustainable finance, particularly for climate action. It then presents specific recommendations for 
governments, regulators, and private finance – summarized in ten principles for action – to chart the way forward. We aim 
to spur more robust and informed debate amongst our member States, drive consensus on key policy and regulatory 
measures to move the region towards sustainability and bring greater clarity regarding the benefits and consequences of 
enhancing sustainable finance in both the short and long term.  
I am confident that policymakers, regulators, private sector representatives as well as researchers in the Asia-Pacific 
region will benefit tremendously from our report. My team and I look forward to engaging with member States, partners, 
and other key stakeholders to translate the ideas presented in this report into practical measures so that the pressing 
financing gap can be closed.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Asia-Pacific region is not on track to meet the SDGs 
by 2030 nor achieve climate ambitions, with current 
financial requirements far exceeding available 
resources. The Sharm-el-Sheikh Implementation Plan, 
agreed at the 27th Conference of the Parties of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) in 2022 highlighted that the world will 
need between $4 trillion and $6 trillion per year to 
transition to a low-carbon economy. For developing 
countries the financing gap to meet their Nationally 
Determined Contributions (NDC) is estimated at close to 
$6 trillion for the period 2023-2030.  
Urgent and systemic change is required to deliver 
funding at such a scale. It requires recognition and 
willingness by all countries to transform policies, 
regulations, and the financial system. In Asia and the 
Pacific this change has proceeded at too slow a pace. 
Policymakers still need to implement credible NDC 
financing plans, with corresponding resource 
mobilization strategies to achieve sequenced NDC 
targets that are progressively ambitious (and to adopt 
more ambitious NDC targets in the future). Regulators 
must act decisively to manage the risks that climate 
change and biodiversity threats pose to the financial 
system, while at the same time decisively shifting 
capital towards green objectives consistent with their 
NDCs. 
In the private sector, banks and businesses need to 
adopt net zero commitments and implement credible 
transition pathways. As they do so, and the supply of 
net-zero aligned financing increases, the demand side 
for this capital also needs to increase. For this, projects, 
particularly in the energy transition and new green 
technologies, are needed at sufficient scale and quality 
to meet a range of investor needs. These projects need 
to be built through new financing partnership 
approaches. In this vein, multilateral development banks 
and development financial institutions will play a key 
role in providing catalytic capital with the right terms 
related to concessionality and risk-sharing. As they do 
so, local banks and investors in Asia-Pacific must 
decide increasingly to finance the net-zero transition, 
particularly in providing local currency financing, which 
is essential in today’s difficult macroeconomic 
environment. Sustainable finance (and transition 
finance) frameworks, roadmaps, disclosure frameworks 
and taxonomies increase the integrity and clarity of 
financing sustainable activities, through the use of 
appropriate standards. Achieving increased regional 
alignment, convergence and interoperability in these 
standards will be highly desirable, which can reduce 
cross-border compliance costs and create an efficient 
and level playing field.   
This report discusses challenges, opportunities, and 
recommendations for policymakers, regulators, and 
private finance in the Asia-Pacific region to bridge the 
gap in sustainable finance. It outlines two tracks of 
sustainable finance; Track 1 refers to use-of-proceeds or 
objective/outcome driven finance; and Track 2 refers to 
sustainably managed finance that manages 
environment, social, governance, and increasingly 
climate, risks in its deployment. The aim of this report is 
to spur a robust and informed debate amongst member 
States, establish consensus on key measures to move 
towards increased sustainable finance, and bring 
greater clarity regarding the benefits and consequences 
of various policy, regulatory and private finance choices. 
What can governments do? 
Policymakers have an important role to play in building 
sustainable finance markets and driving down risk and 
perceptions of risk. When commitments and priorities in 
climate action and sustainable finance are 
communicated clearly to markets, long-term 
investments can be accurately priced and undertaken 
with investor confidence. Policymakers are also 
responsible for budget allocations in terms of incentives 
or tariffs that affect the returns in fossil fuel dependent 
sectors, and in thus shifting the financing of the energy 
mix of sectors. Their actions have vast implications on 
various sectors of the economy that need to finance the 
shift to new and cleaner energy sources, reduce the 
carbon intensity of their output, track their emissions, 
and plan their transition to net-zero emissions. 
Governments also have a role in shifting capital towards 
green objectives. There has been a promising increase 
by governments in the region in issuing sovereign green, 
social, sustainable and other bonds, labelled GSS+, that 
raise capital for specifically GSS+ uses. The global 
market for GSS+ bonds has grown to more than $3.8 
trillion outstanding by the end of 20221, and annual

issuances in Asia and the Pacific increased from $5 
billion in 2015 to $206 billion in 2022. Although 
corporate issuances dominate this market, sovereigns 
and jurisdictions are increasingly tapping into it, with 
Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Malaysia; New Zealand; 
Philippines; Singapore; and Thailand issuing between $1 
billion and $2.5 billion each in 2022. 
Governments in the region also have a role in accessing 
multilateral climate funds (MCFs), such as the 
Adaptation Fund, the Global Environment Fund, or the 
Green Climate Fund. While the money available from 
MCFs will not be sufficient to close the financing gap, 
MCFs remain a critical source and channel for 
developed countries to meet their Paris Agreement 
obligations to developing countries. In 2021, for 
instance, according to the OECD2, funds from MCFs 
provided more than $1.2 billion to Asia-Pacific 
countries. This source of sustainable finance is 
attractive because a large portion is available as grants 
— about 50 per cent in 2021, compared to 29 per cent of 
financing from bilateral donors and 3 per cent of 
financing from multilateral development banks.  
Moving forward, the most immediate step for 
policymakers to take is to ensure that Nationally 
Determined Contributions are supported by concrete, 
targeted, and sequenced national financing strategies. 
Climate mitigation and adaptation activities need to be 
mapped out with expected sources of domestic public 
finance, international financial assistance, and private 
finance. Governments must accelerate the difficult work 
of translating national net zero commitments into net-
zero commitments by financial institutions and 
businesses. In doing so, policymakers should ensure 
clarity, reliability, predictability and stability, thereby 
setting trusted signals to markets and investors who 
must make the long-term investments that underpin the 
net zero transition. Sustainable finance frameworks 
(such as roadmaps and taxonomies) can then further 
embed and clarify financing parameters to support the 
NDC financing strategies. 
Finally, new climate finance partnerships are needed at 
scale to tackle the challenge. Policymakers can also 
drive sustainable finance at scale through engaging in 
multi-dimensional partnerships with donor countries and 
private financial institutions such as the recent Just 
Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) launched by 
Indonesia and Viet Nam in 2022. These JETPs 
coordinate national commitments to peaking emissions, 
phasing out coal, improving regulations and designing 
effective pipelines of bankable projects — all initiatives 
which provide a strong basis to mobilize even more 
private and public finance. While not every country in the 
region can and should replicate the JETP model, the 
engagement between policymakers and financial 
providers (whether public or private) from the planning 
and inception stages of energy transitions are mutually 
beneficial and serve to focus efforts, concentrate minds, 
and bridge the financing gap. 
What can regulators do? 
Regulators can increasingly ensure coherence and 
coordination across other regulators as well as 
policymakers. Regulators have an important role in 
preserving stability of the financial system, managing 
risks, and increasingly, shifting capital towards climate-
related investments. To effectively tackle the scale of 
the sustainable finance challenge, financial regulators 
need to work increasingly closely with other regulators, 
such as environmental protection agencies, 
departments of industries that regulate the fiduciary 
duties of directors and trustees of fund and investment 
managers, competition and consumer regulators 
guarding against potential greenwashing of products 
and services, energy regulators and regulators related to 
the introduction of new green technologies.  Such an 
integration of climate-related and increasingly nature-
related risks into regulation also calls for substantial 
investment into building the right skills and capacities 
across the financial system.  
Effective regulation requires clear, consistent, and 
comparable data. A major challenge to implementing 
regulatory approaches that would account for climate-
related and nature-related financial risks is the lack of 
available quality data. Data challenges reported by 
supervisory authorities include the lack of granular, 
consistent, and comparable data reporting standards for 
counterparties and for financial institutions. The data 
required includes: the identification of sectors or 
economic activities that are vulnerable to physical, 
transition and liability risks; financial institutions’ 
exposures to such sectors or economic activities; the 
geographical location of financial institutions’ 
exposures most prone to physical risk; and reports on

carbon-related metrics, including Scope 1, 2, and 3 
greenhouse gas emissions, by financial institutions and 
their counterparties. The International Sustainability 
Standards Board’s (ISSB) inaugural standards for 
sustainability-related disclosures, issued in June 2023, 
is expected to establish a common global baseline for 
corporate sustainability disclosures. However, 
regulators in countries where institutions are not yet 
required to adopt ISSB standards will still face data 
challenges around the standards, costs, and verification 
aspects of the required data.  
In addition to playing a supervisory role to manage 
finance sustainably (what this report refers to as Track 2 
of the two types of sustainable finance), regulators can 
also decisively shift capital into low-carbon investments 
(Track 1 of the two types of sustainable finance). Their 
work in sustainable finance roadmaps, sustainable 
finance taxonomies, and GSS+ bond and loan 
frameworks create clarity, boost integrity, and signal to 
investors the credibility of intentions to undertake a 
sustainable finance trajectory. Emerging transition 
finance taxonomies have the potential to also credibly 
direct the market towards supporting the transition from 
brown to green activities and incentivize the reduction of 
emissions. Regulators can thus steadily encourage 
financial institutions and corporations to credibly 
transition through the implementation of voluntary and 
mandatory sustainable finance requirements.  
The adoption of sustainable finance roadmaps is a 
promising first step, but their mostly voluntary nature 
may not accelerate urgent and widespread change. Net 
zero commitments, or any obligation to the net zero 
transition, are currently not mandatory across most of 
Asia and the Pacific. Coal financing and fossil fuel 
financing is still on the rise, powered by the increase in 
energy demand across Asia and the Pacific. 
Policymakers and regulators in the region must 
therefore take urgent and decisive action as the report 
outlines. 
What can private finance do? 
The Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2023 highlights that 
there is sufficient global capital and liquidity to close 
the global investment gap. In Asia and the Pacific, 
trillions of dollars of capital are held predominantly in 
the bank lending market, and trillions are also held in 
capital markets. This private finance will now have to 
step up to the challenge. Regulators have an important 
role, as discussed, in incentivising this private finance to 
shift towards green objectives, and in creating an 
efficient and level playing field. The universe of private 
finance in Asia and the Pacific includes banks who lend 
to businesses in the real economy; capital market 
issuers of equity and debt securities; asset owners 
(pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, foundations, 
endowments, trusts, family offices); and asset 
managers (mutual fund managers, investment advisors, 
stockbrokers). Development financial institutions such 
as multilateral development banks (MDBs), bilateral 
development financial institutions, and national 
development banks play an increasingly critical and 
catalytic role in shifting risk, promoting standards, 
mobilising private finance and building capacity. 
Historically, private finance has operated under 
traditional norms of fiduciary duty, which is now 
changing. The architecture governing both the duties of 
directors of companies as well as companies’ climate-
related and sustainability disclosures, which are mostly 
voluntary in Asia and the Pacific now, is being 
transformed. Financial institutions and companies will 
increasingly be required to comply with a strengthening 
mesh of sustainability requirements if they wish to 
continue operating in regulated markets. As they do so, 
and they increasingly commit to net-zero aligned 
operations, these Asia-Pacific private finance actors will 
have to increase the scale of their investing operations 
in net-zero aligned activities. This will infuse much 
needed local currency into the net zero transition in the 
region, if suitable projects and activities are present at 
scale. 
On the supply side, much more needs to be done 
differently in terms of building green projects that are 
ready to meet the needs of a range of investors. 
Common transaction templates in new sectors and 
countries can be developed and shared by investors, 
creating a common transaction lexicon in uncharted 
territories. Investors also need to participate in pre-
investment project-building, at earlier stages, despite the 
resource costs such efforts may entail, in order to bring 
first-mover projects in challenging sectors and locations 
to fruition, and then to replicate such projects. Private

financial institutions in Asia and the Pacific need to 
engage in learning how to invest in what may seem to be 
riskier projects, and how to build and assess capital 
structures that involve blended finance and a multiplicity 
of standards. For such green project pipelines to 
genuinely meet the needs and standards of multiple 
investors at scale, new partnership approaches are 
needed that move away from a deal-by-deal basis to a 
platform basis. This is a different way of doing 
business, and part of the transformation that is needed 
across the system. 
Ten principles of action to bridge Asia-Pacific's 
sustainable finance gap 
This report puts forward a ten-point action plan to 
accelerate sustainable finance in Asia and the Pacific. 
These ten actions summarize in-depth 
recommendations found in each chapter for 
governments, regulators and private finance. These ten 
actions below are grouped into actions to be taken by 
governments, regulators, and private finance. 
Governments and regulators 
1. New climate finance partnerships are developed 
through which governments, regulators, MDBs, and 
private finance commit to action around specific 
goals and contribute specific tasks in line with this 
shared goal. Just Energy Transition Partnerships, 
which are led and owned by countries, provide a 
useful model for the region, especially if execution 
can be accelerated.   
2. 
Effective NDC financing strategies are developed, 
led by authorities with clear mandates, which signal 
credible transition pathways with interim targets 
and clear resource mobilization plans. This will 
provide a clear and vital signal to investors, 
businesses, and project developers that 
governments are committed to change. This signal 
of reliability, stability, and predictability is a core 
part of costs around projects.   
3. Policy coherence and capacities are developed 
across key government ministries such as finance, 
energy, transport, and environment, ultimately 
reducing the costs of financing. Governments need 
to invest in both the effort for such coordination 
and the capacities for such coordination. This will 
also allow governments to better work with MDBs, 
DFIs, and development partners to obtain the 
assistance they need in the timeframe they need it 
in.   
4. Decisive regulatory action takes place to shift 
capital in Asia and the Pacific towards the net zero 
transition. Asia and the Pacific is home to 
significantly large pools of capital capable of 
bridging the gap in sustainable finance. Regulators 
need to adopt a more active role in shifting capital 
towards climate action, recognizing that doing so 
will strengthen financial stability in the system, as 
well as create a level playing field for all. In doing 
so, regulators will also need to move towards 
consistent taxonomies and roadmaps across 
countries, to create a level playing field. 
5. Investment in the capacities of financial personnel  
to assess climate risk, innovate green financial 
instruments, and supervise the transition path of 
the green economy is undertaken. International 
groupings such as the Network for Central Banks 
and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System 
(NGFS) or the Sustainable Banking and Finance 
Network (SBFN) can be effective to promote peer-
learning among members.  
6. Investment in much-needed sectoral and project-
based financial data is undertaken. Common data 
platforms that share valuable data on ESG, climate, 
nature, contracts, clauses standards, targets, and 
deals (where possible) will streamline investment, 
assist benchmarking, strengthen credibility and 
ensure higher replicability.  
Private finance - Asia-Pacific banks, investors and 
issuers. 
7. Commitments to net zero pledges for 2050 with 
credible transition pathways including 2030 goals 
are made. The slowness of banks in Asia and the 
Pacific to commit to net zero and transition their 
lending and investing portfolios with interim 2030 
science-based targets is a serious brake on driving 
finance towards climate action in the region.

8. 
Local-currency financing of energy transition 
projects as well as green technologies and other 
net-zero investments is increased. Local-currency 
financing is critical to accelerate the scale and pace 
of private finance because it can fund projects that 
do not have to reach a higher rate of return just to 
cover exchange rate risk as well as provide other 
benefits. Increased net-zero commitments by 
private finance in Asia and the Pacific (number 7 
above) combined with a focus on investing in the 
energy transition in their local currency will leverage 
and bring forward the needed investment at scale.   
9. Concessional financing and risk-sharing by 
multilateral development banks, bilateral 
development financial institutions, and public 
development banks is expanded and accelerated. 
This will de-risk otherwise sound projects and 
ultimately leverage significant private capital. A 1:5 
ratio, like ADB’s goal, can be one benchmark to 
ensure that concessional funds truly leverage 
private finance and go towards well-structured 
projects. This will also guarantee well-designed 
projects in which concessional finance truly 
catalyzes and mobilizes greater private finance. In 
doing so, however, it is critical to ensure the project 
is both high impact to support the net-zero-
transition and commercially attractive.   
10. Investment of time and effort with partners in 
project preparation is increased in more challenging 
markets, whether it is in the LDCs, SIDS, or in new 
green technologies. Setting up a modality in which 
project developers and financial institutions 
regularly meet and co-create green projects in a 
progressive and iterative manner can accelerate the 
preparation of effective pipelines of bankable green 
projects at scale.  While large projects have lower 
transaction costs, investing in project preparation 
for smaller-ticket projects will ensure a long-term 
pipeline of large projects. Ultimately good project 
preparation brings down the risk of projects when 
implemented.

Since its inception in 2015, the ESCAP biennial series on financing for development has published research on a range of 
critical issues on financing for development from the regional perspective of Asia and the Pacific. This research 
contributes to regional and national dialogues on strategies for the implementation of selected aspects of financing for 
development as advanced by the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.  
The 5th edition of the series was prepared by a core team at ESCAP led by Suba Sivakumaran (Chief, Financing for 
Development Section) and comprising of Chiara Amato, Pierre Horna, Alberto Isgut and Latipat Mikled from the Financing 
for Development Section of the Macroeconomic Policy and Financing for Development Division as well as external 
consultant Michael Coates. 
Hamza Ali Malik, Director of the Macroeconomic Policy and Financing for Development Division, has provided overall 
leadership and shared valuable comments and suggestions at various stages of preparation of this publication.  
A technical review was conducted by Patrick Martin and Deanna Morris, also from the Financing for Development Section 
of the Macroeconomic Policy and Financing for Development Division. Michael Williamson and Michael David Waldron 
from the Energy Division of ESCAP provided technical inputs on financing the energy transition. Heather Lynne Taylor-
Strauss from the Trade, Investment and Innovation Division provided inputs on foreign direct investment.  
Significant research assistance was provided by the following ESCAP consultants, interns and UN volunteers: Maria d’ 
Amato, Zeinab Elbeltagy, Riley Green, Sophie Hunter, Nilaphy Phommachanh and Haoyue Tan.  
The preparation of the report benefitted from extensive discussions and consultations with a broad range of stakeholders. 
Two review discussions were held: at the ESCAP Roundtable on The Next Frontier for Sustainable Finance at the 
Singapore FinTech Festival on 4 November 2022 and during the ESCAP Expert Group Meeting on Public Debt and 
Sustainable Financing that took place on 28 November – 2 December 2022 in Bangkok, Thailand. Additional feedback was 
provided through a series of consultations with experts and practitioners, including representatives of government 
agencies, regulators, investors, banks, private organizations, think-tanks, and academia listed below. We would also like to

EXPLANATORY NOTES 
▪ The United Nations Economic and Social Commission of Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) is one of the five regional 
commissions of the United Nations Secretariat and promotes cooperation among its 53 member States and nine 
associate members in pursuit of solutions to sustainable development challenges. The Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) is the most inclusive intergovernmental platform in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
▪ The ESCAP secretariat supports inclusive, resilient, and sustainable development in the region by generating action-
oriented knowledge, by providing technical assistance and capacity-building services in support of national 
development objectives, regional agreements, and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development, and in supporting and facilitating member states in inter-governmental coordination, resolutions, and 
commitments.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The global financing gap to reach net zero emissions by 
2050 is substantial. For example, the Sharm-el-Sheikh 
Implementation Plan of the COP 27 highlights that 
approximately $4 trillion per year needs to be invested in 
renewable energy alone until 2030 to reach net zero 
emissions by 2050.3 In addition, the global 
transformation to a low-carbon economy is expected to 
require investment of at least between $4 and $6 trillion 
annually.4 Developing countries need to put up an 
estimated $5.8-5.9 trillion5 in the pre-2030 period to 
meet their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). 
To adapt to climate change, according to the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 
developing countries require $127 billion per year by 
2030 and $295 billion per year by 2050. But the 
disparities are stark; funds for adaptation only reached 
49 billion in 2019/20, accounting for about 6 per cent of 
tracked climate finance.6 At the same time, the IPCC 
found that public and private financial flows for fossil 
fuels are greater than those directed toward climate 
mitigation and adaptation.7 
Climate change under a high emissions scenario could 
impose Gross Domestic Product (GDP) losses of 24 per 
cent in the whole of developing Asia, 35 per cent in 
India, 30 per cent in South-East Asia, and 24 per cent in 
the rest of South Asia by 2100.8 According to ESCAP,9 
the region faces increasing frequency and severity of 
storms, flooding, heat waves, and droughts due to 
climate change. Of the 10 countries most affected by 
these disasters globally, six are in Asia and the Pacific, 
where climate-related impacts have disrupted food 
systems, undermined economies and damaged 
societies.10 Across the region, the average economic 
losses resulting from disaster-related and other natural 
hazards in Asia and the Pacific costs an estimated $780 
billion per year. This is forecast to increase to $1.1 
trillion in a moderate climate-change scenario and $1.4 
trillion in a worst-case scenario.11 On the other hand, 
economic losses as a percentage of GDP have risen 
faster in Asia and the Pacific than at the global level.12 
Natural resource–based sectors, such as agriculture 
and fisheries, that are directly affected by climate, 
account for around one-third of total employment in the 
region.13 Beyond threatening the livelihoods of Asia’s 
poor, climate change may also put at risk regional and 
global food security. For these reasons, climate action 
is at the heart of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development for the region.  
Asia-Pacific economies urgently need to step up action 
to tackle the climate challenge. The Asia-Pacific region 
is home to five of the 10 largest emitters in the world 
and accounts for almost half of the world’s greenhouse 
gas emissions. It is also one of the most vulnerable 
regions to climate change. Economic growth in the 
region has relied heavily on emission-intensive 
activities, with the emission intensity of GDP estimated 
to be 41 per cent higher than the rest of the world.14 
Additionally, there is a climate ambition gap,15 with Asia-
Pacific regional NDCs falling short of the required 
climate ambition to effectively reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions in support of the 1.5ºC global warming 
pathway.  
The Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC 2023 
highlights that there is sufficient global capital and 
liquidity to close the global investment gap.16 However, 
there are barriers to deploy capital for climate action, 
both within and outside the financial sector and in the 
context of increased economic vulnerabilities and 
indebtedness facing developing countries.17 Reducing 
the obstacles to scale up financial flows requires clear 
signalling and government support, including stronger 
alignment from public finances to lower the real and 
perceived regulatory cost, and market barriers and risks 
while improving the risk-return profile of investments. At 
the same time, depending on national contexts, financial 
actors — including investors, financial intermediaries, 
central banks, and financial regulators — can address 
the systemic under-pricing of climate-related risks and 
reduce sectoral and regional mismatches between 
available capital and investment needs.18 These insights 
are echoed in our analysis, consultations, and interviews 
and are further elaborated in this report.  
In addition to financing climate action, a separate 
stream of public and private finance is required for 
biodiversity and nature objectives. Countries will have to 
further align both climate and nature financing 
approaches with their commitments to the landmark 
Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), 
adopted by 188 countries19 to halt and reverse nature 
loss, as well as the Paris Agreement. The Kunming-

Montreal GBF includes four overarching goals and 
twenty-three accompanying targets to be achieved by 
2030, together with four long-term goals to achieve the 
2050 Vision for Biodiversity. To achieve these 
biodiversity objectives, it aims to mobilize $200 billion 
per year globally by 2030 to implement national 
biodiversity strategies. Additionally, a target to increase 
financial flows from developed countries to developing 
countries to at least $20 billion per year by 2025 and 
$30 billion per year by 2030, has also been set. 
Furthermore, deforestation driven by land‑use change 
and agriculture contributes around 11 per cent of annual 
global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the 
IPCC, reducing the effectiveness of existing carbon 
sinks. As such, it has been suggested that the global 
economy will not be able to reach net zero by 2050 
without ending deforestation by 2025.20 
The polycrisis brings further complexity to the choices 
that need to be made to increase sustainable finance. 
The term polycrisis, defined as the simultaneous 
occurrence of related global adversities with 
compounding effects,21 aptly describes the current set 
of interlocking challenges that countries face. Rising 
inflation, high public debt levels and increased debt 
servicing burdens, combined with projections of 
moderate economic growth across the globe, places 
limits on fiscal manoeuvrability. Meanwhile, the food 
and energy crisis spurred by the war in Ukraine has had 
wide-ranging detrimental global impacts. The need to 
ensure that the world limits global warming to between 
1.5 ºC and 2ºC above pre-industrial levels, while also 
addressing rising poverty and inequality, has increased 
the importance of making clear and sustainable 
financing choices.  
Delivering sufficient sustainable finance to achieve 
climate and biodiversity goals will require a 
transformation of the financial system. It will also 
require engagement with governments, central banks, 
securities and exchange commissions, ministries of 
environment, energy and transport, commercial banks, 
institutional investors, and other private finance actors 
— to name just a few. In this moment of interconnected 
crises, there is heightened recognition and willingness 
among all actors to systemically transform policy, 
regulation, and finance. If chaos breeds opportunity, 
then this is an opportunity for systemic transformation 
that should not be missed.  
In this report, we discuss the choices and implications 
that policymakers, regulators, and private finance 
institutions in Asia and the Pacific face. The decisions 
and investments made today will have long-term 
consequences for the region. In this biennial report, the 
fifth within ESCAP’s Financing for Development series, 
we examine the trends, challenges, and opportunities for 
policymakers, regulators, and private finance (banks, 
issuers, and investors) in Asia and the Pacific to 
mobilize and deploy sustainable finance, particularly for 
climate action. We then put forward ten principles for 
action for our member states to chart the way forward. 
Our focus in this report is to help policymakers, 
regulators and private finance actors understand the 
implications of choices that need to be made to bridge 
the financing gap in the region. The report aims to spur 
a robust and informed debate amongst member States, 
drive consensus on key measures to move the region 
towards sustainability and bring greater clarity to the 
short- and long-term benefits and consequences of 
these policy and financing choices.  
A. 
Progress in the Asia-
Pacific region towards 
the Sustainable 
Development Goals 
The region is falling behind on 
achieving the Sustainable 
Development Goals 
As of 2022, the region is not on track to achieve any of the 
SDGs, as seen in Figure 1.1. While the region has 
progressed relatively more in Goals 7 (Affordable and 
clean energy) and 9 (Industry, innovation, and 
infrastructure) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities) since 
2015, it has regressed significantly in Goal 13 (Climate 
action) – a major focus of sustainable finance. This is 
the case for all five subregions of ESCAP. On the other 
end of the spectrum, although no SDG is on track in any 
subregion, progress on Goals 1 (No poverty), 3 (Good 
health and well-being), and 9 (Industry, innovation and 
infrastructure) was higher than 50 per cent of being on 
track in at least three of the five subregions.

Among the five subregions, the largest challenges are 
faced by the Pacific subregion, where six out of the 17 
SDGs show regression in 2022 compared to 2015. 
Across subregions, as seen in Figure 1.2 below, the top 
performer economies are in the East and North-East 
Asia and South-East Asia subregions, particularly on 
SDG 1 (No poverty) and SDG 15 (Life on Land) in East 
and North-East Asia and SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and 
communities) and SDG 10 (Reduced inequalities) in 
South-East Asia. Unfortunately, for all SDGs across 
subregions in the table, SDG progress as of 2022 is less 
than half of its 2030 target.

With regards to estimates of the financial needs of 
developing countries to implement the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs), there is wide variation. This 
indicates both different methodologies as well as a lack 
of data. In 2014, the United Nations Conference on 
Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  estimated the 
annual financial gap at $2.5 trillion globally, but after the 
pandemic this estimate surged to $4.3 trillion per year.24 
A similar figure was cited at a recent meeting between 
global business leaders that are members of the Global 
Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) 
Alliance and the Secretary General of the United Nations 
to discuss solutions to bridge the SDG financing gap.25 
For Asia and the Pacific, ESCAP estimated in 2019 an 
average annual financing gap to achieve the SDGs of 
$1.5 trillion per year — equivalent to 5 per cent of the 
aggregate GDP of the region’s developing countries.26 
With regards to Asia and the Pacific, there is substantial 
heterogeneity across countries and subregions. For 
instance, the annual gap estimated by ESCAP in 2019 
was as high as 16 per cent of the GDP for the region’s 
least developed countries, and 10 per cent for the South 
and South-West subregion.27 More recently, the 
International Monetary Fund estimated the SDG 
financing gap of Asia-Pacific emerging market 
economies and low-income developing countries, 
respectively, as 5.4 per cent and 10.6 per cent of the 
GDP.28 While such estimates vary, all of them show that 
the SDG financing gap is substantive.  
The lack of progress on climate 
action in Asia and the Pacific is 
alarming  
Carbon neutrality commitments are still being translated 
into policy and regulatory changes in the region. Figure 
1.3 below shows the policy and legislative status of the 
existing carbon neutrality commitments of Asia-Pacific 
member states as of December 2022. Bhutan is the only 
country to have achieved carbon-neutrality in the region 
and is the world’s first carbon-negative country.

Most countries have not yet assessed and reported the 
financial needs to meet their Nationally Determined 
Contributions (NDCs). At the time of writing, of 51 Asia-
Pacific countries that are party to the UNFCCC, only 17 
reported that information in their latest NDCs, and only 7 
have a breakdown of financial needs for adaptation and 
mitigation. This points to a significant need in the region 
to develop effective NDC financing strategies to meet 
clear financial needs.  
Furthermore, the latest NDCs at both the global and 
regional levels have been assessed as not being 
ambitious enough to contain global warming to between 
1.5°C and 2°C. The Sixth Assessment report of the 
IPCC29 shows that emissions of greenhouse gases from 
human activities are responsible for approximately 
1.1°C of warming since 1850-1900 and estimated that 
the average global temperature will reach or exceed 
1.5°C of warming in the next 20 years. A recent analysis 
using global data finds that reaching a temperature rise 
of between 1.5°C and 2°C goal would require cuts in 
global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 2030 of 
between 25 and 50 per cent compared to 2019. 
However, current country pledges in NDCs would cut 
only 11 per cent, if fully implemented.30 This is also 
referred to for the Asia-Pacific region in Figure 1.4 
below. Similarly, in Asia and the Pacific, GHG emissions 
are expected to decline by only 7.6 per cent between 
2020 and 2030, which falls significantly short of the 45 
per cent reduction required by the 1.5°C pathway for the 
region, as shown in Figure 1.4.31

some conditions, e.g. support from international financing, capacity building, existence of favourable condition, carbon market, etc.) (iii) 
NDC + net zero pledges (the level of GHG emission reductions based on NDCs, and current net-zero pledges) (iv) 45 per cent reductions (a 
45-per cent GHG emission reduction from 2010 level is required to keep the world within the 1.5C temperature rise. 
 
Estimates of financing requirements range higher and 
are frequently being revised upwards the more the 
action is delayed. The Report of the Independent High-
Level Expert Group on Climate Finance states that 
emerging markets and developing countries (excluding 
China) will need to spend approximately $1 trillion per 
year by 2025 (4.1 per cent of GDP compared with 2.2 per 
cent in 2019) and around $2.4 trillion per year by 2030 
(6.5 per cent of GDP) on three investment and spending 
priorities:32 (i) the transformation of the energy system, 
(ii) responding to the growing vulnerability of developing 
countries to climate change; and (iii) investing in 
sustainable agriculture and restoring the damage human 
activity has done to natural capital and biodiversity in 
terms of degraded land, deforestation, and damage to 
water supplies and the oceans. 
Financing gaps for climate mitigation, adaptation, and 
transition face different challenges. According to 
UNFCCC,33 as seen in Figure 1.5 below, global climate 
finance flows were 12 per cent higher in 2019–2020 
than in 2017–2018, reaching an annual average of $803 
billion, with the trend being driven by an increasing 
number of mitigation actions in buildings and 
infrastructure and in sustainable transport, as well as by 
growth in adaptation finance. While mitigation finance 
constituted the largest share of climate-specific 
financial support through bilateral, regional, and other 
channels, at 57 per cent, the share of adaptation finance 
continues to be small. However, adaptation finance 
from the private sector is difficult to keep track of 
because governments do not maintain a centralized 
system that can account for private funds.34

Finance for adaptation needs to rise dramatically. 
According to the World Resources Institute, quoting the 
IPCC, developing countries alone will need $127 billion 
per year by 2030, and $295 billion per year by 2050, to 
adapt to climate change.  
In addition to the climate finance 
gap, there is a large biodiversity 
financing gap.  
According to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity 
Framework (GBF), $700 billion per year will be needed to 
close the biodiversity finance gap. To progressively 
close this gap, Target 19 of the GBF aims to mobilize 
$200 billion per year by 2030 globally from all sources, 
including by increasing financial flows from developed 
countries to developing countries to at least $20 billion 
per year by 2025 and $30 billion per year by 2030, to 
implement national biodiversity strategies. Beyond the 
need to meet agreed-upon biodiversity financing targets, 
it is vital to recognize the strong reliance of economies 
on nature, particularly in low and lower-middle-income 
countries. According to the World Bank,35 low and lower-
middle-income countries stand to lose the most in 
relative terms if ecosystem services collapse, severely 
hampering prospects to grow out of poverty. For 
example, South Asia would suffer a 6.5 per cent 
contraction of real GDP in the case of a severe 
disruption to the natural environment and healthy 
ecosystems by 2030.36  
The macroeconomic environment 
in Asia and the Pacific has become 
challenging in recent years. 
The ability of governments to spend public finances on 
climate action is becoming increasingly constrained due 
to unfavourable economic conditions, which is 
worsening the financing gap. As the figures below show, 
rising inflation accompanied by rising interest rates, and 
rising risk premiums on sovereign bonds, suggest that 
the cost of borrowing is rising. For private sustainable 
finance, the key consideration is that with more costly 
capital, projects, and investment opportunities will have 
to provide greater, and substantially higher, hurdle rates 
(i.e. the minimum acceptable rate of return) to 
investors. This will have serious implications for the 
volume, quality, terms, and tenors of sustainable finance 
available to close the gap.

In conclusion, the need to redirect more finance towards 
climate mitigation and adaptation goals in the region as 
well as nature and biodiversity goals is critical. Although 
raising public and private liquidity is challenging in the 
current macroeconomic environment, significant 
measures can be taken to increase and accelerate 
sustainable finance by removing policy, regulatory, and 
institutional barriers to climate action. In the next 
section, we explore definitions surrounding sustainable, 
green and climate finance, which are relevant for 
policymakers and regulators in the region as they 
continue to engage in transforming financial systems. 
 
 
B. 
What is sustainable 
finance? 
Sustainable finance encompasses a wide set of 
definitions, with binding and non-binding implications. It 
has an evolving lexicon. Definitions are important 
because they define not only the volume of sustainable 
finance available, but also its integrity. Definitions also 
guide future choices about the allocation of capital. We 
list below in Table 1.1 the most used definitions and 
their sources, so that policymakers can understand the 
nuances in differences between definitions. The 
implications of the definitions of climate finance are 
further discussed below.

Table 1.1: Examples of sustainable finance definitions. 
Body 
Definition 
European Union (Regulation 
EU 2019/2088) 
The definition of ‘sustainable investment’ in Regulation EU 2019/2088 includes 
investments in economic activities that (i) contribute to an environmental objective and 
(ii) do not significantly harm any environmental or social objective. The regulation covers 
six predominantly environmental objectives: climate change mitigation, climate change 
adaptation, the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the 
transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and 
restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.37 
G20 Sustainable Finance 
Roadmap  
The G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap released in October 2021 encourages jurisdictions 
that intend to develop their own approaches to align finance and sustainability to refer to 
a set of voluntary principles. These include:  
Principle 1: Ensure material positive contributions to sustainability goals and focus on 
outcomes; 
Principle 2: Avoid negative contribution to other sustainability goals (i.e. do no significant 
harm to any sustainability goal requirements) 
Principle 3: Be dynamic in adjustments reflecting changes in policies, technologies, and 
state of the transition 
Principle 4: Reflect good governance and transparency; 
Principle 5: Be science-based for environmental goals and science- or evidence-based for 
other sustainability issues; and 
Principle 6: Address transition considerations. 
The International Capital 
Market Association (ICMA)  
Sustainable finance incorporates climate, green, and social finance while also adding 
wider considerations concerning the longer-term economic sustainability of the 
organizations being funded, as well as the role and stability of the overall financial system 
in which they operate. ICMA’s definition is based on market usage and draws on the G20 
and European Union references, according to ICMA.38 
International Finance 
Corporation’s Sustainable 
Banking and Finance 
Network 39 
Sustainable finance refers to policies, regulations, and practices by regulators, 
supervisors, industry associations, and financial institutions (FIs) to 
(i) reduce and manage environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks resulting from 
and affecting financial sector activities, including the risks of climate change; and 
(ii) encourage the flow of capital to assets, projects, sectors, and businesses that have 
environmental and social benefits.  
 
A balance of definitions that both incorporate rigour and 
act as an incentivizing and inclusive force is necessary. 
By no means are these definitions exhaustive or 
mutually exclusive. While the broadness of sustainable 
finance definitions has also contributed at times to 
confusion, or to claims that some sustainable finance is 
less ‘sustainable’ than purported (conveying a false 
impression, or ‘greenwashing’), broad definitions of 
sustainable finance allow at this stage more 
stakeholders to participate and classify their activities  
as sustainable. As exemplified by the European Union 
Taxonomy Regulation, the definitions of sustainable 
finance and their subsequent use in regulation can be 
progressively strengthened over time. And while the 
term is well-understood and well-embedded in finance, 
regulations, and policy in more mature markets, it is 
nevertheless also true that wide swaths of stakeholders 
still need to be convinced of the value of sustainable 
finance activities.

Definitions are important to guide regulators and 
policymakers. Evolving sustainable, green and transition 
taxonomies in certain countries in Asia and the Pacific 
further try and clarify to the financial sector how 
financing of activities can be considered green, 
sustainable, or transitioning from brown to green. It is 
thus important for policymakers, who are considering 
voluntary and mandatory approaches in sustainable 
finance, to understand the differences in definitions, so 
that they can guide the financing of sustainable, green 
or transition activities in the real economy. With regards 
to the definition of climate finance, we discuss this 
further below.  
The two tracks of sustainable 
finance  
Sustainable finance can be categorized by two tracks. 
Both foster sustainable economic, social, and 
environmental development, but there are two different 
routes towards fostering that impact.  
Track 1 refers to the financing of sustainable activities. 
Track 1, as shown in Figure 1.9 below, refers to use-of-
proceeds defined sustainable finance, in which the 
proceeds go towards clearly demarcated, pre-defined, 
sustainable, green, or climate-oriented uses, activities, 
objectives, or outcomes. With regards to green finance, 
for example, the G20 Green Finance Study Group 
describes it as “the financing of investments that 
provide environmental benefits in the broader context of 
environmentally sustainable development.”40 Again, 
there is no single universal agreed-upon definition. 
Climate finance, as defined by UNFCCC,41 refers to local, 
national, or transnational financing – drawn from public, 
private and alternative sources of financing – that seeks 
to support mitigation and adaptation actions that will 
address climate change. This definition is objective-
based, and it falls within Track 1 of sustainable finance.  
Track 2 refers to sustainably-managed finance. The 
second track is not about where the investment goes or 
which activities are financed but, rather, how 
sustainability or climate or green-related risks materially 
impact the financial performance of the investment and 
how those risks should be managed. For example, when 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks are 
analysed with respect to how they would affect the 
financial returns of the investment, the resulting 
investments are often labelled as ESG investments. 
Here, greening finance refers to the mainstreaming of 
environment and climate risk management in the 
financial sector. For example, the purpose of the 
Network for Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening 
the Financial System (NGFS), launched at the Paris One 
Planet Summit in 2017, is to enhance the role of the 
financial system in managing risks and capital for green 
and low carbon investments in the broader context of 
environmentally sustainable development. While green 
finance falls within Track 1, greening finance falls within 
Track 2 of sustainable finance. We refer to this track as 
sustainably-managed finance.

ESG standards in risk management 
do not necessarily mean high ESG 
impact.  
ESG-related investment risks have come under 
increasing scrutiny by investors in recent years, and 
these risks also include non-financial considerations 
which can affect a company’s financial performance, 
reputation, and long-term sustainability. ESG investing, 
or ESG finance, has come to the fore of public 
consciousness worldwide as sustainable social and 
environmental practices have become a strategic 
imperative for businesses. Much of the critique on ESG 
in the global narrative has been due to its lack of 
standardization for compliance and the risks of so-
called greenwashing.42 It is therefore important to 
understand what constitutes ESG and what does not.  
The assessment of ESG risks is important for both the 
banking sector and capital markets. There is a fast-
emerging and increasingly well-established regulatory 
risk management framework that incorporates 
environmental and social risk considerations into 
banking and fund management. Typically known as 
Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM), the 
framework has been widely adopted by nearly all central 
banks in the Asia-Pacific region, though the specifics 
vary across countries. ESRM frameworks measure how 
risks will affect the banking sector and thus managed, 
but importantly, they are not designed to evaluate social 
or environmental impact — i.e. the institution’s activities 
on the environment or its communities.  
Corporate governance risks (the G) on the other hand 
are determined separately, and usually carry a different 
weight than the ‘E’ and the ‘S’. Corporate governance 
risks around shareholder and board practices, politically 
exposed persons (PEPS) on boards and their 
involvement in decision-making, as well as complicated 
family ownership structures within businesses are also 
assessed by financial institutions that employ ESG risk 
management practices. ESG risk management 
frameworks for different sectors and products apply 
different weights and analytical approaches to the E, S 
and G components of ESG risks. Strengthening E, S 
and/or G standards are the subject of continued difficult 
political conversations between financial institutions, 
businesses, and policymakers.

ESG risk assessments in capital markets use the 
principle of whether ESG risks are material to the 
financial performance of the company’s stock or the 
fund’s performance. Morgan Stanley Capital 
International (MSCI), one of the leading providers of ESG 
ratings to corporates and funds, defines ESG investing 
in capital markets as the consideration of 
environmental, social and governance factors, alongside 
financial factors in the investment decision-making 
process. This is further echoed by Morningstar 
Sustainalytics, another leading ESG rating provider and 
industry standard setter. Sustainalytics’ ESG risk ratings 
measure a company’s exposure to industry-specific 
material ESG risks and evaluate how well the company 
is managing those risks. Their multi-dimensional way of 
measuring ESG risk combines the concepts of 
management and exposure to arrive at an absolute 
assessment of ESG risk.  
MSCI’s ESG ratings are designed for one purpose: to 
measure a company’s resilience to financially material 
environmental, societal and governance risks.43 ESG 
risks are therefore evaluated in the assessment of a 
company to understand how such ESG risks may impact 
current and future financial performance – not 
sustainability performance. MSCI notes that “Our ESG 
ratings provide a window into one facet of risk to 
financial performance. They are not a general measure 
of corporate ‘goodness,’ a barometer on any single issue 
or a synonym for sustainable investing... They are not 
climate ratings.”44 To add further clarity, MSCI considers 
three methods of ESG investing: a) ESG integration, b) 
impact investing, and c) values-based investing. Of 
these three methods, the first is by far the most 
frequently adopted method of ESG investing in markets 
today. As an extreme example, a fossil fuel investing 
fund can still be labelled as an ESG fund if it considers 
and actively manages ESG risks as it invests in fossil 
fuels.  
Furthermore, the UN’s Principles for Responsible 
Investing notes that there is “no single definitive list of 
ESG issues”.45 This has led a to plethora of different 
standards, due diligence processes, analytical methods, 
and measurement methods around ESG assessment by 
companies, banks, investors, funds, and markets across 
the world. Movements are underway to centralize  
standards, as through the inaugural standards in June 
2023 of the International Financing Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) Foundation’s International Sustainability 
Standards Board (ISSB), which recommends a 
comprehensive global baseline of sustainability-related 
disclosures.  
Use or outcome-based sustainable finance (Track 1) is 
mutually strengthened by sustainably managed finance 
(Track 2), and both are critical to a resilient financial 
system. These two aspects of sustainable finance are of 
course not mutually exclusive; use-based sustainable 
finance can have, and frequently does have, strong ESG 
risk management and safeguards. Some ESG-rated 
investing will also be directed to sustainable uses even 
if that is not explicitly measured yet. Importantly both 
are critical to the robust functioning and stability of the 
financial system. The ability to manage risks, including 
climate-related risks, leads to the stable provision of 
sustainable finance and strengthens the transition to a 
low-carbon economy.  
Who are the key constituents of the 
sustainable finance ecosystem? 
The sustainable finance ecosystem captures a nexus of 
national commitments, public and private sector 
incentives and standards, and financing relationships 
between policymakers, regulators, and private finance 
stakeholders. Sustainable financial markets are made 
up of a large ecosystem of actors, as shown below in 
Figure 1.10 (adapted from the International Finance 
Corporation). However, the activities financed by this 
ecosystem are contained within the real economy, or 
within sectors such as power, transportation, trucking, 
agriculture, forestry, manufacturing etc. Therefore, 
financing sustainable activities follows, or lags behind, 
developments in the real economy. Net-zero pledges by 
financial institutions can drive financing towards net-
zero related activities, but only if the projects and 
activities by corporations and households themselves 
qualify as net-zero related activities.

The frontier where the actual work will be done to 
accelerate sustainable finance is thus within the real 
economy. In particular, it will take place within the 
businesses that adapt their choices, make meaningful 
net-zero commitments, and measure and disclose 
sustainability impacts. A serious pivot is required 
immediately if the 2015 Paris Agreement commitments 
— in which 196 countries pledged to limit global average 
temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-
industrial levels and make efforts to halt the 
temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial 
levels46 — is to be met. Whilst we limit our discussion in 
this sustainable finance report to policymakers, 
regulators, and private finance, it is no exaggeration to 
say that the scope and scale of the change required in 
the real economy in the Asia-Pacific region is breath-
taking, exacerbated by the urgency of the time frame in 
which it must do so.  
The sustainable finance ecosystem has many 
stakeholders. While Figure 1.10 shows the traditional 
financial sector’s role in sustainable finance, Figure 1.11 
below depicts the universe of private finance actors that 
are instrumental for determining whether private finance 
is sustainable and how it can be deployed to more 
sustainable uses. This universe represents a set of 
stakeholders and countries that need to mobilize in a 
systematic and coherent fashion (through setting 
coordinated policy and regulatory actions). For example, 
incorporating sustainable or green elements into the 
compliance and disclosure burden; the tax regime; and 
the fees from advisory, verifiers, and auditors that asset 
owners bear, can change the flow of capital in this 
sustainable finance ecosystem.

An evolving definition of climate 
finance  
The UNFCCC definition of climate finance includes 
binding commitments for developed countries with 
implications for recipient developing countries. The 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) refers to climate finance as local, 
national, or transnational financing —drawn from public, 
private and alternative sources of financing — that 
seeks to support mitigation and adaptation actions that 
will address climate change.47 The definition of climate 
finance has acquired scrutiny due to the implications for 
the COP15 pledges made by developed countries in  
200948 to mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 and 
until 2025 to support climate action in developing 
countries.49 While this goal has yet to be met ($83.3 
billion was mobilized in 2020 – the last available 
estimate at the time of writing), the work of the Standing 
Committee on Finance of the UNFCCC indicates that this 
is an area of continued debate, stating, “there are 
varying understandings of what climate finance 
encompasses, including which sectors and activities are 
covered, the range of financial instruments available 
and which tracking and reporting processes apply, as 
well as different perspectives of what definitions of 
climate finance should include and the detail with which 
associated concepts should be defined.”50

There are at least nine key variables relevant to any 
definition of climate finance. The Standing Committee 
on Finance’s report shows nine components necessary 
to operationalize a given definition of climate finance 
for reporting purposes, as shown in Table 1.2 below.  
 
The complexity described here can seem daunting, but it 
adds valuable clarity to policymakers, regulators, and 
private finance actors from developing countries (to 
whom these commitments have been made). Climate 
finance is objective-based and falls within Track 1 of the 
two tracks discussed earlier.

Does more sustainable finance 
translate into progress towards the 
Sustainable Development Goals?  
There is currently no overall Sustainable Development 
Goal or sub-target that measures the flow of sustainable 
finance. In addition, financing the SDGs does not always 
directly correlate with improved SDG indicators for 
several reasons. For example, use-based sustainable 
finance directed towards the provision of 
environmentally sustainable renewable energy would 
affect Goal 7,51 which can be measured by the 
proportion of the population that relies mainly on clean 
fuels and technology (indicator 7.1.2); the share of 
renewable energy out of total energy consumption 
(indicator 7.2.1); and/or how much money is flowing to 
countries for clean energy research (7.a.1).52 However, 
the corresponding results are not always visible for 
many reasons. Firstly, reporting use-based proceeds 
within most of the currently accepted sustainable 
finance frameworks does not include reporting on SDG 
impacts. Secondly, national statistics agencies and 
bodies do not have the resources to measure all 17-
interlinked goals and 231 indicators. Thirdly, 
improvement in SDGs may take considerable time and 
may be affected by other trends occurring in parallel, 
making it difficult to isolate the impact of sustainable 
finance alone. This was noted earlier in the Roadmap for 
Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development, which pointed out that misaligned 
incentives and regulations, limited awareness, and 
difficulties in identifying, measuring, and reporting on 
sustainable investments impede private investment53 in 
the SDGs at scale.54 The lack of hard evidence to justify 
sustainable finance in terms of the SDGs need to be 
counterbalanced by greater awareness of how 
sustainable financing works. This lack of reporting 
ability is thus an important hurdle to overcome, so as to 
better drive national conversations and choices towards 
financing for development as well as to advocate more 
clearly for increases in climate finance. 
 
 
C. 
Concluding remarks: How 
can countries raise 
sufficient sustainable 
finance? 
The sums are staggering, whichever estimate of the 
financing gap is used. Yet while the gap to finance the 
SDGs will continue to be substantial, the discrepancy 
between need and availability of funds for financing 
climate action to achieve the 1.5-2°C target looms larger 
and larger. There is no single silver bullet to mobilize the 
finance needed in the short time frame needed. Instead, 
only concerted and targeted action by all stakeholders 
will transform the region’s pathway. As the Sharm-el-
Sheikh action plan noted, delivering such funding will 
require a transformation of the financial systems and its 
structures and processes, engaging governments, 
central banks, commercial banks, institutional investors, 
and other financial actors.  
How can countries increase the volume of sustainable 
finance in the time frame needed? The central question 
for this report, therefore, is “How can countries in Asia 
and the Pacific, especially developing countries 
including the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and the 
Small Island Developing States (SIDS) increase the 
quantity and quality of sustainable finance available in 
the time frame needed?” We focus particularly on the 
environmental aspects of sustainable finance, already 
heavily weighted in most sustainable finance definitions, 
and in international and regional regulatory and policy 
norms and processes. This includes a focus on green 
and climate finance. We also further note that LDCs and 
SIDS have contributed disproportionately little to GHGs 
but are significantly impacted by regional and global 
emissions. Their ecosystems are also particularly prone 
to and affected by the collapse of biodiversity; however, 
they do hold a disproportionate amount of high 
biodiversity assets.

The challenges are greater for LDCs and SIDS. LDCs and 
SIDS face a set of interconnected challenges in scaling 
sustainable finance. LDCs and SIDS are generally far 
more exposed to the impact of climate change related 
extreme weather events due to their reliance on 
subsistence agriculture in the former, and their exposure 
to sea-level changes in the latter. LDCs and SIDS are 
also highly exposed to the negative implications of 
growing global macroeconomic uncertainties. Finally, 
the limitations of government revenue means that public 
finance is naturally constrained in implementing the 
adaptation changes required to protect the livelihoods 
and lives of their vulnerable populations. LDCs and SIDS 
also face difficulties obtaining the data and building the 
capacities needed to track and accelerate sustainable 
finance.  
We thus propose action by three sets of stakeholders 
who are the subject of this report: policymakers; 
regulators; and private finance. We analyse trends, 
challenges, and opportunities faced by these three main 
stakeholders and aim to answer the following policy 
questions:  
▪ What can government policymakers do?  
▪ What can regulators do? 
▪ What can private finance do? 
The goal of this report is to contribute to a better-
informed debate that can guide timely choices amongst 
our member states. Our focus is to outline the choices 
that stakeholders face, as well as discussing the 
evidence, data, and current debates around such 
choices. We hope that this will better inform much-
needed actions, and spur accelerated action.

2. WHAT CAN 
GOVERNMENTS DO? 
A. 
 Introduction 
In this chapter we examine the trends, challenges, and 
opportunities that policymakers within governments 
face in unlocking further sustainable finance, and 
particularly climate finance, from public and private 
stakeholders. We then propose recommendations for 
policymakers which are aggregated in our final chapter 
into our ten point action plan for the region.  
There is a strong link between financial sector 
development and GDP growth. According to the World 
Bank, “countries with better-developed financial systems 
tend to grow faster over long periods of time, and a 
large body of evidence suggests that this effect is 
causal: financial development is not simply an outcome 
of economic growth; it contributes to this growth.”55 
However, there is substantial debate over the extent to 
which the financial sector contributes to growth, which 
types of financial systems are most beneficial to 
growth, and even whether all growth in the financial 
sector is beneficial to society.56 What is clear is that a 
positive correlation exists between GDP per capita and 
the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) financial 
development index, as seen in Figure 2.1 below. 
Nevertheless, it is important to note that the growth of 
sustainable finance markets depends on the depth, 
integrity, and liquidity of countries’ financial systems.

Note: The IMF Financial Development Index is an aggregate measure that summarizes how developed financial institutions and financial 
markets are in terms of their depth, access, and efficiency. There is significant correlation between the Financial Institutions index and 
GDP per capita (corr = 0.73, p <0.001) and between the Financial Market index and GDP per capita (corr = 0.62, p <0.001).57 Both GDP per 
capita values and IMF Financial Market Index and Financial Institution Index values are from 2020. Countries lacking sufficient 
information on Financial Market Index components were excluded from the analysis due to missing data. The figure shows countries in 
Asia and the Pacific based on ESCAP groupings at sub-regional level.

Figure 2.2 below shows the relative state of financial 
market development in the region. Interestingly, one 
may intuitively expect countries with more financially 
developed systems to be further along in adopting 
sustainable finance taxonomies or regulation and 
experiencing higher sustainable finance flows. For 
example, Cambodia and Viet Nam, which have 
seemingly less developed financial systems, have 
nevertheless issued maiden green bonds using green or 
sustainable finance taxonomies. This suggests that 
countries can leapfrog traditional timelines of financial 
system maturation in developing sustainable finance 
systems. Such sustainable finance flows often include 
new types of investors for developing countries; 
investors who specifically seek sustainable/green 
impact investments even in the face of high sovereign or 
currency risk. For issuers, such diversification in 
investors expands the depth of the market.

To grow, sustainable finance markets need depth, 
access, efficiency, and stability. According to the Center 
for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), in traditional 
financial markets, ‘depth’ means that financial 
institutions and financial markets are of a sufficient 
size. ‘Access’ reflects the degree to which economic 
agents use financial services. ‘Efficiency’ means that 
financial institutions can successfully intermediate 
financial resources and facilitate transactions. Finally, 
‘stability’ refers to low market volatility and low 
institutional fragility.58 These elements are also 
necessary for an increase in sustainable finance flows.  
LDCs and SIDS face particular challenges in financial 
sector development, which affects their ability to attract 
private finance. Many LDCs and SIDS in the Asia-Pacific 
region continue to face challenging fiscal situations, 
which are exacerbated by low levels of tax revenue and 
domestic savings, disruptions in the tourism sector for 
SIDS, low productivity, and volatile GDP growth. Many 
LDCs and SIDS also frequently struggle to expand 
capital markets and deepen financial sectors, especially 
with regards to attracting private and/or foreign capital. 
For example, of all the private finance mobilized globally 
between 2012 and 2018, LDCs received only 6 per 
cent,59 — approximately US $13.4 bn between 2012 and 
2018. The majority flowed to upper middle income 
countries, which received 41 per cent, or $84 bn. 
Meanwhile, lower middle income countries were the 
recipients of 33 per cent, or $68 bn. Given the low share 
of LDCs in global GDP, this may seem to be a 
substantial amount; however, in light of the discrepancy 
between sustainable finances and what is required, a 
significant increase in private investment is vital. With 
10 out of the 12 LDCs in Asia and the Pacific en route to 
graduation, official development assistance will need 
replacement with alternative sources of public and 
private finance, particularly to support the Sustainable 
Development Goals. 
“Data limitations for adaptation projects, high transaction 
costs, and small project sizes make it difficult for SIDS to 
attract investments and compete for or access climate 
resilience financing. The climate and development finance 
systems need to adequately take into account SIDS unique 
needs and vulnerabilities, whilst ensuring a more consistent, 
long-term focused, and systematic way to attract climate 
finance working alongside national stakeholders” – Peseta 
Noumea Simi, Chief Executive Officer, Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade of Samoa 
 
What is the role of policymakers in 
supporting sustainable finance? 
The financing of sustainable development, including the 
financing of climate action, requires strong leadership 
and commitment to implement the Nationally 
Determined Contributions (NDCs) in time. The Paris 
Agreement, now ratified by 193 countries, requests each 
country to outline and communicate their post-2020 
climate actions, known as their NDCs. These NDCs form 
the basis for countries to achieve the objectives of the 
Paris Agreement, and contain information on targets, 
policies and measures to reduce national emissions and 
adapt to the impacts of climate change. In Asia and the 
Pacific, countries have started to implement the NDCs 
domestically by (i) mainstreaming climate activities into 
national development plans, policies, strategies and 
roadmaps; (ii) creating an institutional framework; (iii) 
mobilizing resources; and (iv) elaborating transparency 
measures to monitor and evaluate climate action. 
However, as outlined earlier, the state of climate 
ambition in Asia and the Pacific (as manifested in the 
NDC commitments collectively) is insufficient to meet 
the global goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 
degrees Celsius.

24 
 
Importantly, even where (insufficiently ambitious) NDCs 
are in place, NDC financing plans lack progress. A 2020 
assessment by ESCAP suggests that 26 countries in the 
region, well more than half, have not taken any steps to 
integrate NDC actions in national budgetary processes; 
29 countries have no relevant policy frameworks for 
aligning private sector actions with NDCs; and 22 
countries do not have frameworks for aligning lending 
with NDCs.60 While this is improving, concerted and 
systematic efforts to devise and implement 
comprehensive financing strategies for the NDCs are 
not advancing fast enough.  
Nevertheless, progress has been made in certain areas. 
The issuance of green, social, and sustainable bonds 
continues apace. Climate budget tagging — the practice 
of identifying, measuring, and monitoring climate 
relevant expenditures — is slowly increasing. More 
countries are exploring the viability of debt-for-climate 
or debt-for-nature swaps, especially in situations of 
potential debt distress. Several countries are developing 
and implementing integrated national financing 
frameworks (INFFs), which could strengthen planning 
processes and drive sustainable financing. These are 
promising trends. But to avoid fragmentation, they 
should be accompanied by a national vision that is 
central, overarching, and integrated to finance both the 
NDCs and the SDGs together.  
Policymakers have an important role to play in signalling 
credible intentions and presenting national climate 
action priorities to markets. Such intentions and 
national priorities are closely watched by markets, who 
use them to price long-term investments. Emissions-
reducing investments — whether it is phasing out of coal 
or the adoption of new technologies in carbon capture, 
utilization and storage — require upfront, lump sum 
payments of significant amounts to finance capital 
expenditure in equipment, factories, renewable energy 
installations, and technologies. Meanwhile returns are 
collected over a long-term basis, and often in the later 
years of the project. Policy signals thus need to act to 
reduce both the actual risks and the perceptions of risks 
associated with such long-horizon, upfront investments.  
For public and private sustainable finance to flow 
towards the NDCs, contradictions in the enabling 
environment of sustainable finance need to be resolved. 
Firstly, it is important to recognize the scale of the 
transformation currently underway in sustainable 
finance. Regulations, taxonomies, standards, and 
markets are in flux, alongside countries’ evolving NDC 
implementation plans. Policymakers are responsible for 
budget allocations in terms of incentives or tariffs that 
affect the returns in, for example, coal versus green 
hydrogen offtake, and in shifting economic structures 
away from using traditional energy sources to cleaner 
energy sources. This has vast implications for real 
economy industries, which have to adapt to new and 
cleaner energy sources, reduce the carbon intensity of 
their output, track their emissions, and plan for 
transition. In turn, this affects those who finance such 
industries and companies, whether it is public or private 
finance. Therefore, when regulation and policy are 
constantly evolving, investment returns are difficult to 
forecast with predictability or stability and affect go-no-
go financing decisions with deleterious effects on long-
term investment projects. Coherence across policies 
and sectors along with an enabling environment is thus 
critical to accelerate sustainable finance.  
 
“The enabling environment signals an incoherence in policies: 
for example, with a subsidized coal industry on one part and a 
different picture for the renewable energy market, which lacks 
competitiveness as a result of the returns emerging due to 
challenges on the regulatory front.” – Anonymous 
 
Sustainable finance roadmaps are one tool that 
governments can use to signal their priorities to 
markets. In many cases, though such roadmaps are 
announced by governments and their ministries of 
finance, the design and implementation of such 
roadmaps are led by regulators. These roadmaps can 
chart a path for the development of a sustainable 
finance market, often by creating priorities and timelines 
for the development of key enabling tools such as (i) 
sustainable or green taxonomies; (ii) green, social, and 
sustainable bond frameworks; (iii) corporate 
sustainability reporting; (iv) climate disclosures; (v) and 
net-zero transition reporting; and other similar 
requirements. However, while sustainable finance

25 
 
roadmaps lay out the planned trajectory of a sustainable 
finance market, policymakers still need to grapple with 
how underlying sectors in the real economy (which is 
financed by sustainable finance) can be guided to 
transition in time. 
Furthermore, it is important to distinguish between the 
standards and ambition of sustainable finance 
roadmaps in developed countries versus least 
developed countries. LDCs, SIDS and other countries 
with special situations should be able to attract enough 
capital required for climate action and the SDGs. The 
danger is that by imposing strict ESG standards on risk 
management (Track 2), or on use of proceeds (Track 1), 
capital ends up being diverted away from more 
challenging markets that already face high sovereign 
risk and deter investors. The ASEAN taxonomy for 
example is a multi-tiered framework that takes into 
account differences amongst its member states.  
Policymakers also have a role in advocating for and 
mobilizing committed climate finance from developed 
countries. In 2009 at COP15, developed countries 
committed to a goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion a 
year by 2020 to address the needs of developing 
countries in the context of meaningful mitigation 
actions. This funding would come from public and 
private, bilateral, and multilateral sources, including 
grants as well as concessional and non-concessional 
debt. In 2016, parties to the Paris Agreement decided 
that they shall “set a new collective quantified goal from 
a floor of $100 billion per year, taking into account the 
needs and priorities of developing countries before 
2025”.61  In 2021, at COP26 in Glasgow, parties decided 
to initiate deliberations to establish a new collective 
quantified goal that are to be concluded in 2024, and are 
to include inter alia, quantity, quality, scope and access 
features as well as sources of funding.62  In spite of 
strong commitments, funding has fallen short of the 
goal of $100 billion annually ($83.3 billion was 
mobilized in 2020, according to the latest data available 
at the time of writing). Nevertheless, on the demand 
side, developing countries can continue strengthening 
their ability to seek access to these funds through 
concrete financing plans and strategies.   
 
 
B. Trends and opportunities 
This section discusses recent trends among 
governments and policymakers across Asia and the 
Pacific which are strengthening the depth, access, 
efficiency, and stability of sustainable finance markets. 
These trends, which are largely positive, point to 
increasing policy momentum across the region and are 
a positive harbinger of further sustainable finance at an 
imperative scale and pace. We discuss, in particular: the 
growth of green, social, sustainability and other labeled 
(GSS+) bonds; the role of carbon pricing; potential of 
debt for climate swaps; trends in accessing multilateral 
climate funds; and the potential offered by the Just 
Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs).  
Sovereign green, social, 
sustainability and other labeled 
(GSS+) issuance 
Many countries in the region are increasingly issuing 
sovereign bonds that finance climate action and 
sustainable development. Green, social, sustainability, 
sustainability-linked bonds, and transition bonds, 
together referred to as GSS+ bonds or thematic bonds, 
fall within Track 1 of sustainable finance, whereby their 
proceeds are explicitly directed to fund green, social, or 
sustainable activities, as seen in Figure 2.3 below. While 
green, social and sustainability bonds follow a strict 
use-of-proceeds criteria, sustainability-linked bonds 
(SLBs) are used by issuers who commit explicitly to 
future improvements in the sustainability outcomes of 
their entity within a predefined timeline, and the 
proceeds of SLBs are intended to be used for general 
purposes.63  SLBs therefore offer the issuer greater 
flexibility in terms of proceeds, while still setting 
specific targets for sustainable outcomes in a 
predefined timeline. Transition bonds are an emerging 
asset class whereby the issuer can either commit to use 
of proceeds terms directed to climate or just-transition 
purposes, or issue general purpose bonds aligned to 
sustainability linked bond principles.64  On the London 
Stock Exchange, for example, transition bond issuers 
must publish a transition framework in line with ICMA’s 
Climate Transition Finance Handbook, engage in 
climate-related financial disclosures, commit to net-zero 
targets and commit to report annually on its transition 
performance.

Figure 2.4 below shows the steep growth in GSS+ bonds 
in Asia and the Pacific from 2015 to 2022 and the 
promising growth of new asset classes. Globally, the 
market for GSS+ bonds (corporate and sovereign) has 
grown to around $3.8 trillion as of the end of 2022 
(excluding transition bonds).65 These new asset classes 
provide flexibility by issuers to meet different climate 
objectives and enable the issuer to obtain further 
unrestricted funding. While green bonds continue to 
dominate both corporate and sovereign bond issuances, 
sustainability bonds and more recent instruments, such 
as sustainability-linked and transition bonds, are making 
progress. The growth of these debt instruments, despite 
global turmoil in debt markets, is a proof of their 
resilience. Additionally, maiden issuances continued to 
grow and by the end of 2022, 43 sovereigns from five 
continents brought out debut GSS issues.66 Of these, 
green bonds dominate the market with social bonds, 
sustainability bonds, and sustainability-linked bonds 
following.

In Asia and the Pacific, China, Japan and the Republic of 
Korea have issued 78 per cent of the GSS+ bonds 
between 2015 and 2022. Among developing countries, 
India, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand 
have issued GSS+ bonds for over $65 billion in the last 
seven years, as seen in Figure 2.5. Globally, according to 
Climate Bonds Initiative, 2022 saw GSS+ issuance hold 
its 5 per cent share of the global bond market despite an 
overall decline in GSS+ volume to $863.4 billion from 
more than $1 trillion in 2021.67  Of these, green bond 
issuance comprised just over half of the labelled bond 
issuance in 2022 ($487.1 billion), followed by 
sustainability bonds ($166.4 billion), social bonds 
($130.2 billion), SLBs ($76.3 billion), and transition 
bonds ($3.5 billion).   
Sovereigns lag behind corporate issuers of GSS+ but 
their share is growing, sending important signals to the 
market. Sovereign GSS+ issuance is still about 5 per 
cent of the total debt issuance globally, while corporates 
are globally issuing 8 per cent of their issuance in GSS+ 
instruments. Similarly, international financial institutions 
are raising more than 30 per cent of their total bond 
issues via green instruments.68  Sovereign green 
issuances catalyze domestic market development and 
send important signals to markets about the direction 
and commitment of policymakers to climate and 
sustainability goals. In Asia and the Pacific, the growth 
in sovereign and other public issuance by countries in 
the region has been substantial between 2019 and 2022, 
as seen in Figure 2.6 below.

emerging regulation for new GSS+ markets, increased 
premiums due to lower sovereign credit ratings, and a 
nascent base of issuers and investors in GSS+ bonds, 
there have been promising maiden issuances in Asia-
Pacific countries over the past two years — a trend that 
signals growth and continued strength of sustainable 
finance markets across the region.

Note: No GSS+ sovereign bonds were issued by ESCAP members for the first time in 2022. It is expected more ESCAP members will issue 
a GSS+ bond for the first time in 2023, including Mongolia and Cambodia. 
 
There is also promising local-currency issuance of GSS+ 
bonds, signalling uptake of GSS+ bonds by local 
investors. This not only increases the depth of the GSS 
markets but importantly signals that investment appetite 
is no longer driven solely by international investors. 
Ensuring the participation of local investors in 
sustainable finance markets is essential to achieving a 
country’s climate objectives. As seen in Figure 2.7 
below, there has been significant local currency 
issuances of GSS bonds by both corporate and public 
actors. This signals that domestic investors are 
understanding and purchasing these securities and 
signifies the promise of depth and access in these 
markets. 
 
Importantly, it also means projects financed by such 
green bonds do not need to add a premium to overcome 
hard-currency financing costs, which are aggravated by 
the depreciation of local currencies against the United 
States dollar. This unlocks larger volumes of 
sustainable finance that can meet environmental 
objectives at a higher and faster scale. Finally, as seen 
in Figure 2.8 below, there has been substantial issuance 
in many local currencies in Asia-Pacific countries that 
do not necessarily have an investment-grade rating. This 
also shows that investors have an appetite for what may 
be perceived as more risky local currency financing, in 
the GSS+ asset class. Interestingly, some of these GSS+ 
bonds are also being used as long-term financing 
instruments (with maturities beyond five years), which is 
essential as a potential tool to finance capital 
expenditure-heavy, upfront investments in climate 
action.

The emergence of sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) 
could allow the financing of projects with direct impact 
in cutting GHG emissions. While green bonds are 
directed to financing green projects under green bond 
criteria, they are usually not linked to financing the 
reduction of emissions. SLBs are instruments with pre-
defined sustainability performance targets that the 
issuer commits to meet by a given date (the "penalty 
event date"). If the targets are not met, the issuer is 
typically subject to a penalty, a mechanism that is 
absent in the case of conventional green bonds. SLBs 
can be linked directly to reduced greenhouse gas 
emissions through the contractual choice of the 
Sustainability Performance Target (SPTs). Data for the 
first half of 2022 shows that 58 per cent of SLB 
issuances were tied to greenhouse gas emissions – and 
28 per cent of these covered scope 1, 2, and 3 
emissions.69 
Furthermore, mainstream green bonds tend to be 
concentrated in green infrastructure (buildings and 
transport) and renewable energy but SLBs are issued 
across a more diverse range of sectors. Alongside the 
financial services and utilities sectors, which are 
responsible for a combined total of 30 per cent of all 
SLB issuance in 2021 and H1 2022, the industrials, 
materials, and consumer sectors have a sizeable share 
of the market, with a combined total of almost 50 per 
cent of all SLB issuance, suggesting that companies in a 
wider range of sectors are using the instrument to help 
finance their net zero or low-carbon transitions.70  
Trends show that sovereign issuances tend to raise 
overall sustainable bond standards. According to the 
Bank of International Settlements (BIS), the inaugural 
issue of sovereign green bonds tends to tighten 
standards for overall green issuance in that country. 
After such an issue, not only does the annual number of 
corporate issues tend to increase across jurisdictions, 
but so does the percentage of corporate issuance with 
second-party opinions. This tendency is apparent in both 
advanced and emerging market economies.71 This 
further enhances the integrity of the markets and allows 
investors to trust and trade. According to BIS, while all 
sovereign issuers have solicited a seal of approval from 
an external reviewer, in contrast, as many as one-fifth of 
corporate green bonds globally are self-labelled as 
green by the issuer without any external review.72

Sovereign sustainable finance instruments can 
potentially finance other SDG objectives as well, 
including gender equality. While the sustainable finance 
market keeps expanding, investors’ requests for more 
inclusive and innovative financial instruments that 
address social issues are also growing. These include 
financial products which include women’s leadership, 
employment or incorporation into investment strategy 
and analysis. Social bonds, Sustainable Development 
Goal bonds,73 gender bonds, sustainability bonds, and 
sustainability-linked bonds can help direct capital to 
reduce the financial and economic inequalities between 
women and men. Such instruments can enable capital to 
flow to fund social projects targeting specific 
populations. However, green or sustainability-linked 
bonds which include a gender or diversity dimension 
remain scarce. 
Governments are increasingly 
active in carbon markets 
In addition to fostering the development of the GSS+ 
bond markets in the region, carbon markets should be 
seriously considered by governments for climate action. 
Voluntary carbon markets remain predominantly global 
in nature, but in the region, China, Thailand, Japan, the 
Republic of Korea, Singapore, Australia and New 
Zealand have also developed emissions trading 
schemes or carbon credit markets, as can be seen in 
Figure 2.9 below and Annex D. New carbon markets in 
Asia and the Pacific are also expected to go live in 2023, 
when Indonesia will launch the first phase of mandatory 
carbon trading for coal power plants.74

Note: Carbon pricing initiatives are considered "scheduled for implementation" once they have been formally adopted through legislation 
and have an official, planned start date. Carbon pricing initiatives are considered “under consideration” if the government has announced 
its intention to work towards the implementation of a carbon pricing initiative and this has been formally confirmed by official government 
sources.77 ETS refers to cap-and-trade systems, but also baseline-and-credit systems.78

Governments can allocate carbon pricing revenues to 
critical social and environmental policies to support 
sustainable development. The World Bank estimates 
that $84 billion in carbon pricing revenues was raised by 
governments in 2021, yet carbon pricing still only 
accounts for less than 5 per cent of global emissions. 
ESCAP’s Economic and Social Survey 2020 highlights 
that phasing out fossil fuels and introducing carbon 
pricing could open up significant fiscal space for 
countries in the region. For example, at a carbon price of 
$70, the survey estimates that several countries in the 
region could increase revenues by over 2 per cent of 
GDP by 2030. In sum, if the revenue raised from carbon 
taxes is collected effectively and then partially 
channelled back into the economy to compensate low-
income groups for the impact on energy and 
transportation costs, it can potentially increase the level 
of economic activity and reduce inequality and poverty, 
while simultaneously progressing towards emissions 
targets and reducing air pollution. 
Several countries in the Asia-Pacific region have already 
adopted different forms of carbon pricing. This includes 
China (the largest carbon market in the world), Japan, 
Republic of Korea, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, 
and Kazakhstan. In addition, several others are currently 
considering carbon pricing policies, including Thailand, 
Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam and Indonesia. (However, 
Indonesia recently announced it would delay the 
introduction of its carbon tax due to the impact of high 
energy prices). Furthermore, nascent discussions are 
underway to link compatible ETSs with each other to 
reduce costs, increase liquidity, and harmonize carbon 
pricing across jurisdictions. According to the World 
Bank,79 73 different carbon pricing instruments globally 
have been implemented as of the end of 2022 with a 
share of global GHG emissions covered around 23 per 
cent. Record high revenues from emission trading 
schemes and carbon taxes approached $100 billion. 
While both issuances and retirements of carbon credits 
fell compared to 2021, voluntary demand from 
companies remains the primary driver of market activity.  
However, the carbon price remains well below what is 
needed to drive carbon neutrality. According to the 
World Bank, as of April 1, 2023, less than 5 per cent of 
global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are covered by 
a direct carbon price at or above the range ($40-$80 per 
metric ton of carbon dioxide) recommended by 203080 
(in 2023), with most of these high-price instruments 
located in Europe.81 Another estimate of what an 
effective carbon price range should be also came from 
the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for 
Greening the Financial System (NGFS) which released 
its updated scenarios for central banks and supervisors 
in September 2022. NGFS modelling suggests that 
carbon prices need to be around $50 by 2030 in 2010 
terms (or $69 in 2023 terms) and subsequently around 
$200 (or $276 in 2023 terms) by 2050 to achieve a 
below-2°C outcome.82 The majority of current carbon 
prices remain far below this range, and such prices are 
commanded in high income countries, mainly in Europe 
and the United States.  
Most countries have now included emission reductions 
targets in their NDCs. Carbon offsets are an integral part 
of the UNFCCC Paris Agreement, including the rules to 
establish pathways for their use. A carbon offset is 
equal to one metric tonne of carbon dioxide (or 
equivalent GHG) that has either been removed from the 
atmosphere or prevented from being released into the 
atmosphere. Critically for carbon offsets to serve their 
purpose of incentivizing abatement and encouraging 
countries to meet their international climate change 
obligations, they must have environmental integrity. 
Carbon offsets are created by certified activities that 
create and measure the number of tonnes of removals 
or reductions in GHGs from the atmosphere. Only 
additional removals or reductions in GHGs that happen 
because of the activities, and that would not have 
happened otherwise, can be counted and made into 
carbon credits. 
Article 6 allows parties to the UNFCCC to use 
international trading in carbon offsets, referred to as 
internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs) 
to help achieve their emissions reduction targets. ITMOs 
enable countries to buy and sell carbon offsets from 
each other to meet their obligations under the Paris 
Agreement. Importantly, this creates opportunities for 
developing countries to sell carbon offsets to developed 
countries.  
Carbon markets are being explored by governments to 
accomplish their NDCs, while corporations are taking 
the initiative by establishing their own reduction targets 
and utilizing offsets to achieve them. Consequently, the 
demand for carbon offsets is increasing, with both 
mandatory compliance and voluntary markets becoming 
more widespread. It is hoped that Article 6 will provide a 
framework for integrating compliance and voluntary 
markets in the future.

Box 2.1: LDCs and SIDS and carbon offset markets. 
Carbon offset markets are increasingly valuable to enable companies and governments to meet their emission reduction 
targets by purchasing carbon offsets. Carbon offsets are generated by projects that reduce or remove GHG emissions. 
Article 6 of the Paris Agreement encourages countries to use cooperative approaches that enable them to use carbon 
offsets to help achieve their emissions targets. These projects can include nature-based solutions, such as projects to 
reduce deforestation. Forests absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere — thus acting as natural sinks for GHG 
emissions — although they release GHGs when cleared or degraded. Reducing deforestation can, therefore, significantly 
enhance efforts to mitigate climate change.  
Blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangrove forests and seagrass meadows, also act as carbon sinks and contain more 
sequestered carbon per square meter than almost any other ecosystem. Importantly, projects must be certified according 
to agreed methodologies and have in place appropriate monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) protocols to 
guarantee that they create actual measurable reductions in GHGs, which increases compliance costs. However, if 
structured appropriately, a project designed to conserve a forest or blue carbon ecosystems can generate carbon offsets 
that can be sold, earning valuable income for local communities and governments that can contribute to broader 
sustainable development priorities. Regional partners — including Australia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, among others — are 
working together to develop high-integrity carbon offset schemes in the Indo-Pacific region. The rich stock of biodiverse 
green and blue ecosystems within the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in LDCs and SIDS, means that carbon offsets 
generated from these types of projects have the potential to play a critical role in generating much-needed sources of 
climate finance for LDCs and SIDS in the region.  
Debt for nature and debt for 
climate swaps  
In the current context of high, and increasing, public 
debt levels amid a narrowing fiscal space in developing 
countries, the availability of public finance for climate 
action projects is curtailed. Debt for nature or debt for 
climate swaps represent a promising solution. 
Policymakers are increasingly exploring this tool. 
A debt swap is an agreement between a creditor and a 
debtor by which the former cancels a portion of the 
latter's foreign debt in exchange for a commitment to 
invest in a specific environmental project. Debt for 
nature swaps have a precedent in the debt for nature 
swaps first implemented in the context of the global 
debt crisis of the 1980s. Debt for nature swaps invested 
mainly in conservation projects, and they are flexible 
instruments that can be funded through a variety of 
sources in addition to donor countries. These may 
include grants from philanthropical organizations, as in 
the Seychelles debt swap of 2015 — when nearly $22 
million of debt was forgiven in exchange for greater 
ocean protection — or an issuance of a blue bond 
backed by political risk insurance by the US International 
Development Finance Corporation (DFC), as in the Belize 
debt-for-nature swap of 2021, through which 
approximately $107 million was dedicated to 
conservation projects amid debt restructuring. 
A debt for climate swap is a type of debt swap that 
cancels foreign debt in exchange for a commitment to 
redirect savings in debt services towards climate-
friendly objectives. Bilateral official creditors that are 
Annex II parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change can make their funding 
of debt for climate count as part of the developed 
countries’ commitment to provide $100 billion per year 
in climate finance to developing countries.83 According 
to the IMF, “under bilateral debt swaps, previously 
committed debt service to official bilateral creditors is 
redirected to the financing of mutually agreed projects 
in areas such as nature conservation and climate.84 
Tripartite swaps involve buybacks of privately held debt 
financed by donors and/or new lenders, usually 
intermediated by an international nongovernmental 
organization (NGO), conditional on nature- or climate-
related policy actions and/or investments. In the most 
common type of operation the NGO lends the funds to 
the debtor country at below-market interest rates, on 
condition that (1) the debtor uses the funds to buyback 
commercial debt at a discount, and (2) a portion of the 
resulting debt relief (the difference between the cost of 
the retired commercial debt and the new debt to the 
NGO) is used to fund climate-related actions or 
investments.”85

Debt swaps are not the same as unilateral debt 
forgiveness. They are mutually beneficial agreements 
through which both the debtor and its creditors gain. 
Debtors benefit by reducing their debt burden and 
opening fiscal space for dedicated investments in 
climate projects. They also benefit by reducing pressure 
on the exchange rate, as their new obligations to invest 
in climate projects are in domestic currency. With 
regards to creditors, private bondholders can benefit 
from a buyback agreement at a price that exceed the 
market price, and bilateral official creditors can make 
their funding of a debt for climate swap deal count as 
part of the $100 billion commitment, as mentioned 
earlier. Table 2.2 provides a broader description of 
costs and benefits of debt swaps which policymakers 
can use to assess the suitability of these instruments.86 
Table 2.2. Opportunities and challenges of debt swaps for the involved parties. 
Advantages and positive outcomes 
for the debtor country  
Advantages and positive outcomes for 
the creditor country  
Shortfalls and challenges  
▪ Through debt relief and conversion, 
the overall debt burden on the debtor 
country is lowered and the strain on 
the national budget is reduced.  
▪ Since counterpart payments into 
environmental projects are generally 
made in local currency, debtor 
governments save scarce hard 
currency which they can then use to 
build foreign exchange reserves.  
▪ Debt swaps have the potential to 
improve the overall macroeconomic 
situation of an indebted and 
developing country through alleviating 
its public debt burden in the medium 
term and creating fiscal space in the 
short term.  
▪ Debt relief can strengthen economic 
stability, improve the credit rating of a 
debtor, and attract new investments. 
▪ Environmental projects benefit from 
freed finance that would have 
otherwise gone towards the creditor’s 
budget, often bringing economic and 
social benefits at a local level.  
▪ Grants to environmental projects or 
local NGOs are typically distributed via 
a trust fund which is set up according 
to the original repayment schedule. 
This long-term regular funding 
facilitates investments in climate 
finance. 
▪ From a financial perspective, creditor 
countries’ remaining debt claims 
increase in value through such swaps, 
and creditors can recover either full or 
at least a larger part of their debt. Debt 
swaps are particularly beneficial if parts 
of the debt have been already written 
off, but full repayment remains unlikely. 
▪ Creditors must mobilize less additional 
finance to meet their international 
climate commitments and, at the same 
time, can register the instrument as the 
provision of Official Development 
Assistance (ODA). Since the nominal 
value of non-concessional debt can be 
registered as ODA, many creditor 
countries have used this instrument to 
boost their ODA numbers.  
▪ Further, creditor countries can raise 
their environmental credentials by 
mobilizing co-financing through 
international funding institutions. A debt 
swap that is carefully designed can 
guarantee an adequate use of funds and 
carry a greater weight than a single 
donation.  
▪ Debt for climate swaps can help 
developed countries reach their COP26 
target to mobilize at least $100 billion 
annually by 2023 while providing 
developing countries with additional 
resources to mitigate and adapt to 
climate change. 
▪ If the write-off rate is low or even zero, no 
extra-budgetary room is provided, which 
leaves the overall macroeconomic 
situation unaffected.  
▪ If the debt swap volume is small, the 
positive impact on the debtor’s economic 
situation is negligible or might even be 
outweighed by the costs incurred when 
negotiating a swap and setting up a trust 
fund.  
▪ Debtor countries must have sufficient 
funds to put into trust funds, and there 
exists a risk of inflation if debtor 
governments print money to pay the 
agreed amount in local currency. This 
risk does not apply to countries that do 
not have a national currency.  
▪ Debt swaps carry the threat of crowding 
out other forms of finance that are 
potentially more effective. Debt swaps 
should be additional to the already 
delivered ODA and not substitute other 
channels of new aid.  
▪ Climate-relevant debt swaps have to 
compete with other sectors (health, 
education, infrastructure) for a limited 
amount of eligible debt.  
▪ Countries will need to negotiate with 
creditors specifying the conditions of the 
swap, reduced debt, selection of projects, 
implementation and monitoring, 
additional financial sources, connections 
with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement.

Accessing multilateral climate 
funds and development finance  
In addition to GSS+ bonds, carbon pricing, and debt for 
climate or debt for nature swaps to finance, accessing 
multilateral climate funds and/or development finance 
is another source of sustainable finance for 
policymakers.    
Multilateral climate funds (MCFs) are a significant 
source of sustainable finance for developing countries 
but may be insufficient to meet their financing gaps. 
Multilateral climate funds were established through 
international agreements with a mandate to provide 
finance for the transition to a green, inclusive, and 
climate resilient economy in developing countries. The 
visions and missions of the MCFs are partially shared 
and mutually reinforcing in their support to developing 
countries to implement the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and the Paris 
Agreement. They are to be accessed by developing 
countries for mitigation, adaptation or transition funding 
and use a variety of financing methods. They form a 
significant channel for the $100 billion per year 
promised by developed countries to developing 
countries. The main MCFs and their purposes are:  
▪ Finance for adaptation in developing countries: 
The mission of the Adaptation Fund is to 
accelerate the quality of adaptation action in 
developing countries by financing concrete 
adaptation actions, innovation and multi-level 
learning that engage, empower, and benefit the 
most vulnerable communities through inclusive 
and country-driven processes.  
▪ Finance to adopt new green technologies in 
developing countries: The Climate Investment 
Fund’s mission is to mobilize its Multilateral 
Development Bank partners, governments, the 
private sector and local communities, to test and 
pioneer new technologies, create markets, and 
catalyze transformational change toward a more 
prosperous, equitable climate economy.  
▪ Finance to meet climate goals by developing 
countries: The Global Environment Facility’s 
(GEF’s) mission is to safeguard the global 
environment by helping developing countries meet 
their commitments to multiple environmental 
conventions and by creating and enhancing 
partnerships at national, regional, and global 
scales based on the principle of sectoral 
integration and systemic approaches to project 
and program financing.  
▪ Finance for LDCs to meet national adaptation 
programmes of action. The GEF operates the Least 
Developed Countries Fund (LDCF).  
▪ Finance to adopt low-emission development 
strategies by developing countries. The Green 
Climate Fund’s (GCF’s) vision is to promote the 
paradigm shift towards low-emission and climate 
resilient development pathways in the context of 
sustainable development. 
In Asia and the Pacific, $5.3 billion was mobilized by the 
multilateral climate funds between 2018 and 2021, 
based on OECD development finance statistics.87 This is 
still a small proportion of overall climate finance flows, 
and of the climate finance gaps, and many developing 
countries in the region face challenges in applying for 
and meeting the requirements of financing from these 
funds. Table 2.3 below presents data on access to 
sustainable finance in Asia and the Pacific in 2021 from 
three main sources: multilateral climate funds, 
multilateral development banks, and bilateral donors.

Notes: The table shows climate-related development finance in current United States dollars committed by bilateral and multilateral 
sources in 2021. Flows from bilateral donors are provided directly to an aid recipient country. A bilateral donor’s contribution is 
considered multilateral if it is pooled with other contributions and disbursed by multilateral development banks or multilateral climate 
funds. The data in the table covers 96.3 per cent of the climate finance flows to the region in 2021. For simplicity, flows from private 
philanthropies and flows in the form of equity and mezzanine financing instruments from all sources, which contribute the remaining 3.7 
per cent of the total, are not shown in the table. Regional and subregional funding is funding to the region or a specific subregion that 
does not identify the recipient countries. 
In total, Asia and the Pacific received $183.7 billion in 
climate finance between 2016 and 2021 from all such 
sources. The two main sources were multilateral 
development banks ($88.3 billion) and bilateral donors 
($86.8 billion), followed by multilateral climate funds 
($7.5 billion). In addition, private philanthropies 
contributed $1.1 billion during this period. As can be 
seen in Figure 10, Panel A, climate finance increased 
from $24.2 billion in 2016 to $38.2 billion in 2020, but it 
fell to $32.6 billion in 2021. The $5.6 billion drop in 
climate finance between 2020 and 2021 was due to 
bilateral donors, who decreased their flows to the region 
by $6.2 billion, while multilateral climate funds and 
multilateral development banks increased their 
financing slightly. A possible explanation of the drop in 
Official Development Assistance (ODA) channelled to 
climate finance in 2021 could be the increase in global 
ODA allocations towards COVID-19 related activities, 
from $12 billion in 2020 to $21.9 billion in 2021.89 
The increase in climate finance between 2016 and 2021 
has been largest for adaptation finance, 101 per cent 
from $6.2 billion in 2016 to $12.5 billion in 2021. 
Finance for mitigation increased by 11 per cent, from 
$16.7 billion in 2016 to $18.5 billion in 2021. As 
percentage of total climate finance from such sources, 
adaptation increased from 25.6 per cent in 2016 to 38.2 
per cent in 2021 (Figure 2.10, Panel A).

Much of the financing has been debt creating, which is a 
concern when countries are already experiencing 
increased indebtedness. With regards to financing 
instruments, 82.8 per cent of the flows during 2016-
2021 consisted of debt finance, 15.6 per cent consisted 
of grants, and 1.6 per cent consisted of other 
instruments such as equity and mezzanine financing.90 
The share of debt is higher for mitigation projects (90 
per cent) and lowest for projects where there is an 
overlap of mitigation and adaptation (37 per cent). (See 
Figure 2.10, Panel B). 
Over 70 per cent of the climate finance received by the 
region between 2016 and 2021 was concentrated in four 
sectors: Transport & Storage (29.6 per cent of total 
climate finance flows in 2016-2021), Energy (22.7 per 
cent), Water Supply & Sanitation (9.9 per cent), and 
Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing (8.9 per cent). Within the 
transport sector, rail transport was the main subsector 
(18 per cent of total climate finance flows in 2016-
2021), followed by road transport (6 per cent), and 
Transport policy and administrative management (3.7 
per cent). Within energy, the main subsectors were 
Electric power transmission and distribution (5 per 
cent), Energy policy and administrative management (4 
per cent), Energy generation, renewable sources - 
multiple technologies (3 per cent), Hydro-electric power 
plants (2.5 per cent), Solar energy for centralized grids 
(1.9 per cent), and Energy conservation and demand-
side efficiency (1.3 per cent).

Achieving climate goals requires developing countries to 
go beyond reliance on promised funding from developed 
countries. It is encouraging that publicly sourced 
climate finance to Asia-Pacific developing countries is 
on the rise. However, even if these flows continue 
growing at an annual rate of 12 per cent, as they did 
between 2016 and 2020, the amounts will not suffice to 
cover the large financial gaps faced by countries in the 
region for the transition to a low carbon economy, nor 
will the funds be enough to meet the investment 
required for the energy transition. 
The Just Energy Transition 
Partnerships  
The Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) 
present a promising model of partnership between 
policymakers, regulators, donors, and private investors 
for the region. While it is not feasible for every country 
in the region to participate in a JETP, policymakers can 
nonetheless take away several key lessons from the 
initiative.  
The Indonesia Just Energy Transition Partnership 
(JETP) was launched in November 2022. Following the 
South Africa model, this is a country platform of 
coordinated policies, regulatory improvements, 
(anticipated) project pipelines, and financing 
commitments that together aim to mobilize $20 billion 
from 2023 to 2028 to accelerate a just energy transition. 
Ten billion US dollars of public money will be 
contributed by the International Partners Group (IPG) 
members (France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the 
United States of America, and the European Union), and 
at least $10 billion of private finance will be mobilized 
and facilitated by the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net 
Zero (GFANZ) Working Group.  
The Viet Nam Just Energy Transition Partnership 
launched in December 2022 will rally an initial $15.5 
billion of public and private finance over the next three 
to five years to support Viet Nam’s green transition. 
Initial contributions to Viet Nam’s JETP include $7.75 
billion in pledges from the IPG together with the Asian 
Development Bank and the International Finance 
Corporation. This is supported by a commitment to work 
to mobilize and facilitate a matching $7.75 billion in 
private investment from an initial set of private financial 
institutions coordinated by the Glasgow Financial 
Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), including: the Bank of 
America, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Macquarie 
Group, Mizuho Financial Group, MUFG, Prudential PLC, 
Shinhan Financial Group, SMBC Group, and Standard 
Chartered. 
The Indonesia and Viet Nam JETPs provide a model to 
the rest of the region to focus their financing strategies. 
Their JETPs coordinate national commitments to 
peaking emissions, phasing out coal, improving 
regulations and ensuring bankable projects for private 
finance as well as public finance. In turn, this 
commitment and coherence at the national level has 
attracted private finance commitments in addition to 
donor finance. For the rest of the region’s developing 
countries, the model suggests that pragmatically 
focusing on coherence and change within a specific 
sector can yield results. Strong policy and regulatory 
commitment in a specific sector and area signals to 
investors that pricing risks around regulatory and policy 
uncertainty will likely subside, reducing the cost of 
financing (or the “uncertainty premium”).  
C. Challenges 
This section discusses some of the challenges faced by 
governments, particularly in developing countries, to 
strengthen the depth, access, efficiency, and stability of 
sustainable financial markets; and to bridge the gap by 
mobilizing enough sustainable finance to meet national 
goals.  
The lack of policy coherence by policymakers affects 
the amount of sustainable finance flows to countries 
and the integrity (standards) of these flows. A lack of 
coordinated policymaking between goals, trade-offs, 
activities and resources between ministries, 
departments, and agencies responsible for designing 
and implementing climate-related mandates and 
financial sector mandates adversely affects transaction 
costs and reduces efficiency. It also negatively drives 
risk perceptions about the reliability, predictability, and 
stability of the policy and regulatory regime.

Coherence between policy commitments and 
independent regulatory approaches is also essential. 
Scaling up green and climate finance involves 
transforming not only green and climate finance policies 
but also other areas of business and investment 
policies, especially with regards to the real economy. 
The policy environment exerts a strong influence over 
investment decisions, and if the legal and regulatory 
system is unclear, contradictory, or creates unintended 
barriers, a country is less likely to attract the necessary 
climate finance. One example is a country with an 
ambitious emission reduction target, but legal and 
regulatory frameworks that provide preferential 
treatment for fossil fuels. Policymakers thus need to 
balance numerous competing policy choices and 
regulatory arrangements in many different sectors and 
levels of government.  
Expertise, skills, and resources are required by 
policymakers to access multilateral climate fund 
funding. The GCF project approval time, for instance, for 
LDCs is often long. In the time span between November 
2015 and July 2021, the median time for processing an 
application was of 619 days or 21 months. Because 
submissions are made quarterly in accordance with the 
GCF project submission schedule, this could represent 
up to six or seven rounds of reviews of the funding 
proposal at the GCF Secretariat and/or from an 
Independent Technical Advisory Panel (ITAP). The 
shortest approval time for LDC projects was 113 days 
(about four months) and the longest was 1,727 days or 
58 months. Adaptation projects bore the longest 
average time — 22 months compared to 20 months for 
mitigation and cross-cutting projects.92 
“Public sector of SIDS like Samoa inherently face major human 
and technical capacity constraints throughout the project cycle, 
from project origination to implementation. The complexity of 
the climate finance landscape and the lack of harmonization 
among the requirements of multilateral climate funds and 
donors further exacerbate this challenge. Improved capabilities, 
more predictable and long-term financing can be key to the 
development of pipeline projects for potential investments and 
access to funding opportunities for SIDS.” – Peseta Noumea 
Simi, Chief Executive Officer, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade of Samoa 
The cost of sustainable finance is affected by countries’ 
sovereign credit ratings. Sovereign credit ratings are 
usually a combination of domestic economic risk, public 
finance risk, external economic risk, financial stability 
risk and environmental, and social and governance risk. 
We see this in Table 2.4 below, which shows that 
investment-grade sovereign ratings are correlated with 
much larger volumes of GSS+ bond issuance. Such 
bonds enjoy a cheaper cost of financing for green 
projects and can be issued in larger volumes, given the 
lower debt servicing costs. However, sustainable 
finance instruments can still be issued successfully 
without investment-grade ratings. As Table 2.4 also 
shows, countries with non-investment grade sovereign 
ratings have also successfully issued GSS+ bonds. The 
volumes are still low, but they signal that there exists 
appetite for such instruments.

Despite an increasing demand for green projects, the 
paucity of bankable projects in national pipelines is a 
serious issue. For governments, building a pipeline of 
projects that meet the bankability needs of the relevant 
investors in terms of climate finance is often a 
challenging process. Outreach to the relevant investors 
is also challenging. From a returns perspective, green 
projects (particularly in adaptation) may involve high 
upfront costs and a longer term for payouts. Pricing may 
be better in non-green asset classes, though that may 
not always be the case. However, risks in the interim 
period between costs being paid upfront and returns 
materializing later are still challenging to financiers. 
These include risks at the country level, sector level, 
borrower/project developer level, and increasingly, 
related to external shocks. Untested regulatory 
environments and green business models can also 
create liabilities for first movers. In this instance, the 
global discussion on reform within multilateral 
development banks can help boost financing for riskier

projects. But building climate finance or green pipelines 
is nonetheless a whole-of-government process due to 
the need to coordinate standards, sectors, and MDB and 
investor outreach. 
D. Recommendations 
Based on the thorough discussion of trends, 
opportunities, and challenges presented above, this 
section puts forward a series of recommendations for 
governments and policymakers. While they are not 
exhaustive, they nevertheless present the most critical 
areas for policymakers to begin as soon as possible. In 
addition, these recommendations (which are set out in 
detail here) have been aggregated into our final set of 
ten principles of action for the region to bridge the 
sustainable finance gap in Asia and the Pacific, set 
forward in the final chapter.  
▪ Develop effective and coherent NDC financing 
strategies with interim 2030 and 2040 targets, and 
clear resource mobilization plans. Efforts should 
be spearheaded by authorities with clear 
mandates. This would clearly signal to investors, 
businesses, and project developers that 
governments are committed to change. While most 
governments have submitted NDCs, many of them 
do not include financial needs – ideally broken 
down by industry, sector, use, and area. Such 
needs should ideally be identified in the form of a 
national level NDC financing strategy which maps 
climate mitigation and adaptation projects or 
programs with expected/planned sources of 
government finance, international financial 
assistance, and private finance. Large ballpark 
financial figures are currently included in some 
NDC action plans, but without a clear methodology 
that depicts how such figures were arrived at, it is 
difficult for countries to begin mobilizing the 
finance necessary from the best sources. What is 
needed are defined investment priorities, 
concomitant policy and regulatory improvements 
related to those priorities, investor, DFI and MDB 
outreach plans, including to potential international 
donors, and a list of properly vetted projects that 
are matched to possible financing sources. This 
coherent and cohesive process itself requires 
government investment in building capacity, data, 
and systems. 
 The process would similarly include an 
evaluation of regulatory and policy barriers to 
enabling private sector investment in 
adaptation.94 For example, in China (the largest 
green bond market in the world), such a regime 
is implemented with a focus on inter-ministerial, 
central-local and international collaborations, 
centralized policymaking, and the alignment of 
green goals with performance assessments of 
local officials.95 Interestingly, evidence reviewing 
current financing strategies suggests that “it is 
not clear that a strategy that includes detailed 
costing of adaptation actions is more effective 
than a high-level strategy that builds awareness 
and high-level political buy-in.”96  
 Consequently, any financing strategy should be 
broader than merely seeking resources from 
developed countries. Improvements to the 
enabling environment encourage increased 
private sector investment. The political economy 
of sustainable financing within a country should 
also be considered, especially regarding 
domestic investors and businesses. Finally, the 
preparation of the strategy should involve private 
finance from the beginning, even though this 
compounds multi-stakeholder coordination 
challenges. Such involvement is key for the lead 
ministry in charge of NDC planning to translate 
the country’s needs and opportunities into a 
national priority list of feasible investments. 
 
"When Armenia presented its NDCs, it was followed by a 
concrete implementation plan that highlighted potential sources 
for financing the NDCs and an annual financial plan, particularly 
focusing on energy sector projects." - Erik Grigoryan, former 
Minister of Environment, Armenia.

▪ Encourage the financial sector and the private 
sector to proactively plan for the net zero 
transition, ahead of 2030 or 2050. This will also 
increase local currency financing for the net zero 
transition. As part of the above, the whole-of-
society transformation that needs to be 
accelerated can kick off with governments 
requiring the financial and private sectors to begin 
disclosing their transition planning strategies. 
Governments also need to call on the financial 
industry (and therefore their underlying borrowers 
the private sector) to set strategies and targets 
that progressively align financial portfolios with 
the NDCs. Of relevance to governments and other 
public sector stakeholders is to ensure that any 
legislation passed (particularly as it pertains to 
corporate transparency and disclosure) is 
supportive of emerging international sustainability 
standards. As part of this approach, governments 
should also encourage the use of central net zero 
data platforms to overcome critical data gaps, 
such as Singapore is doing through the 
forthcoming Project Greenprint.97 Project 
Greenprint is a blockchain-enabled, trusted, 
common platform to manage and access ESG data 
and to meet disclosure requirements locally and 
internationally. It promotes data consistency and 
clarity in disclosures and enables comparability of 
data.  
▪ Consider subsidizing the costs of measurement 
and disclosures in green or sustainable finance, to 
whatever extent possible, as part of the transition. 
For example, the Monetary Authority of 
Singapore’s sustainable bond grant scheme 
offsets up to SGD 100,000 (approximately 
$73,890) of additional expenses for external 
reviews of eligible green, social, sustainability and 
sustainability-linked bonds and promotes the 
adoption of internationally accepted standards. 
This has led to an increase in green issuance in 
Singapore both by sovereigns and corporates. 
Various, relatively small, incentives like these have 
been used in Thailand, Indonesia, and China in 
different forms such as discounts on pricing, 
grants, tax breaks, tax credits, and other 
incentives. While this may not be appropriate for 
every economy, nevertheless their availability may 
be useful to launch new markets and reduce first-
mover disadvantages. 
▪ Ensure development of a pipeline of bankable 
projects. The pipeline of projects needs to fit the 
volumes, scales, and risk-return profiles that 
interest multilateral climate funds, multilateral 
development banks, development financial 
institutions, and private investors. Solving this is a 
complex issue and must include bringing relevant 
investors onboard for advice at early stages, 
despite the increased coordination costs faced by 
investors. Private investors could in fact benefit by 
not having to engage in the high transaction costs 
related to identifying, developing, and financing 
low-carbon bankable projects. Missing policy or 
regulation in new sectors — such as renewable 
energy or green technologies — further hinders the 
development of such projects, where again, 
governments can play a key role to develop them. 
Additionally, governments may need proper 
emissions-based assessments, disaster impact 
assessments and nature-based assessments to be 
able to prioritize projects. This activity also 
requires significant capacity building within 
ministries around the identification of such 
projects. For example, the OECD’s review of green 
infrastructure project pipelines98 highlights six 
essential factors to attract investment to projects 
in the pipelines. We underscore three of them for 
all-sector green project pipelines:  
 Ensuring authority and ownership of the green 
bankable project pipeline by ministries, 
departments, or agencies with adequate ability to 
co-ordinate public and private actors, signal 
investment needs, translate national climate 
commitments into prioritizing green projects, and 
capable of outreach to multilateral climate funds 
and private finance actors.  
 Ensuring that the right priorities are translated 
through the pipeline is critical to build project 
pipeline at the scale and rates far beyond current 
volumes. Such priorities are not only about which 
projects will reduce emissions the fastest but 
should also reflect an understanding of the 
commercial risks, potential returns, requirement 
of heavy upfront capital expenditure and contract 
enforcement risks.

45 
 
 Ensuring transparency in how project pipelines 
have been identified and using clear data and 
criteria to specify why projects have entered the 
pipelines. According to the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD),99 improved transparency equips 
investors with information to justify subsequent 
commitments and positions in pipelines, and to 
develop exit strategies.  
▪ Expand the role of national development banks, as 
limited public capital must be deployed in a 
manner that increasingly catalyzes private finance. 
National Development Banks are a key element of 
financial infrastructure in many emerging markets. 
The Addis Ababa Action Agenda emphasizes the 
fundamental role that well-functioning national and 
regional development banks can play in financing 
sustainable development. National banks play a 
countercyclical role, especially during crises. The 
Addis Agenda specifically calls on national and 
regional development banks to expand their 
contributions to areas important for sustainable 
development. It also urges relevant international 
public and private actors to support such banks in 
developing countries. They are particularly 
effective at accessing concessional financial flows 
(either through directed lending or private 
placement of bonds) from MDBs and bilateral DFIs 
and intermediating them into the real economy, 
either directly or as an apex lender. “Greening” an 
existing national DFI or creating a new specialist 
entity is a vital underpinning of continued access 
to concessional finance. MDBs and bilateral DFIs 
increasingly expect credit to be directed towards 
sustainable economic development, and for 
borrowers to demonstrate this through enhanced 
ESG reporting and disclosure. 
▪ Advocate for MDBs and bilateral development 
financial institutions to increase local currency 
lending. The global macroeconomic stability 
concerns have again highlighted the profound 
problems caused by the predominance of hard 
currency lending by MDBs and bilateral 
development finance institutions (DFIs). National 
DFIs that previously borrowed cheaply in hard 
currency are now struggling to manage these 
dollar or euro liabilities against a loan book 
dominated by local currency assets. The same 
challenge affects the interface with MDBs and 
DFIs looking to finance the commercial banking 
sectors directly. The appetite for hard currency 
lending during periods of currency depreciations in 
the region has changed. As the global discussion 
underway is tilting towards, MDBs and bilateral 
DFIs need to explore new modalities for helping 
borrowers absorb these exchange rate risks. 
▪ Invest resources to build the necessary skills, 
capacities, and data collection systems to bridge 
the sustainable finance gap. For example, given 
the substantial new commitments by donors100 to 
multilateral climate funds, eligible governments of 
developing countries should invest in improving 
their capabilities to access the funds, particularly 
when the transaction costs are worth the benefits 
of the projects. Many countries also have 
considerable room to improve their access to the 
UNFCCC Financial Mechanism in the form of the 
Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF). Development of a 
robust pipeline of project opportunities at a 
national level is a critical success factor, as is the 
accreditation of entities (particularly financial 
institutions) that will curate projects and apply for 
funding through the UNFCCC Financial 
Mechanism. Figure 11 shows where countries have 
already successfully applied to the GEF and GCF, 
and where countries have been less successful or 
not yet been successful, representing a set of 
countries that would benefit from further 
resources to strengthen capacities.

Fund, GEF Trust Fund, LDC Fund, Multi Trust Fund, NPIF, and the Special Climate Change Fund. Per capita financing is calculated based on 
2021 population data. 
 
▪ New climate finance partnerships, inspired by the 
JETP model, should be considered. These 
partnerships can bring together commitments to 
transform the real economy by policymakers, 
regulatory reform, donor capital, and private 
finance. For example, in the energy sector, long-
term commitments to financing energy transitions 
rely on the presence of comprehensive national 
planning strategies that include energy efficiency, 
electrification of end uses, clean power, and clean 
fuels. Such integrated energy strategies are 
lacking in many Asia-Pacific countries, but the 
JETPs move decisively towards such integration. 
Several cross-cutting barriers also inhibit clean 
energy project development. These include lack of 
carbon pricing and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, 
which can tilt the economic playing field against 
clean energy. Inadequate regulatory frameworks, 
including onerous permitting and licensing 
processes, can exacerbate risks in early-stage 
clean energy project development, for which 
funding is particularly constrained. Again, these 
barriers to climate action are anticipated to be 
overcome to some extent by the JETPs.  
▪ Adopt a conducive taxation regime towards the 
net-zero-transition, and further align policy 
coherence. Perhaps the most important role that 
governments can play is to incentivize sustainable 
economic development. Ultimately, financial 
institutions will direct credit on the balance of risk 
versus reward. Governments can reduce the risks 
of enterprises adopting sustainable business and 
operating models by creating fiscal incentives that 
support extra financial headroom for financing. 
This approach can be controversial with fiscal 
planners that are rightly wary of undermining 
public finances. Implementing well-aligned tax 
incentives or deterrents can enable investors to 
achieve their threshold of investment (referred to

as the “hurdle rate” or the minimum rate of return 
on a project or investment required by an investor) 
— thus enabling more private finance. 
▪ A combination of policy and regulatory 
improvement and investor participation from the 
inception of projects is what is needed in any 
sector, not just the energy transition, to overcome 
the current mismatch between the demand and 
supply of private finance for the net zero 
transition. For example, anecdotally, some private 
investors in energy transition projects worldwide 
find that they have been brought on too late and 
are expected to co-finance projects that have been 
pre-designed in too restrictive a fashion. In some 
cases, the best returns within the project have 
already been dedicated towards one investor 
(often an MDB), leaving other private investors 
with less attractive returns within their share of the 
project and reducing the volume of financing 
available. If private investors are brought onboard 
at inception together with other investors to 
communicate their preferences on risk, return, 
tenors, corporate governance, ESG standards, 
climate and social impact, domestic and 
international regulatory compliance, legal clauses, 
dispute resolution and other aspects of the 
transaction; then truly investment-ready pipelines 
can be built faster and better.  
Conclusion 
While there is no one-size-fits all policy for governments 
in Asia and the Pacific, all countries face the challenge 
of bridging the sustainable finance gap. Regional 
cooperation on data, cross-border challenges, and 
aligning investment norms through common taxonomies 
or common regulatory approaches can work to level the 
playing field between countries and reduce arbitraging 
opportunities. Importantly, regional cooperation allows 
less developed countries to learn from the lessons of 
other policymakers and share best practices relevant to 
the region’s unique context.

3. WHAT CAN 
REGULATORS DO? 
A. Introduction 
A well-functioning sustainable financial system has 
depth, efficiency, access, and stability. A rich diversity 
of instruments is available to meet the demands of 
investors amid a fast-flowing current of exchange. As a 
Bank of Thailand regulator notes, “An efficient financial 
market is one with proper depth and breadth. That is, on 
the supply side there is a wide range of financial 
instruments, offering choices of issuers, credit risks, 
etc. to satisfy all classes of asset demand. On the 
demand side, there has to be sizable investment 
demand from various types of investors, with different 
risk-return appetites. Also, a good diversity among 
issuers and investors usually brings about a good mix of 
market views, leading to an active exchange of financial 
assets. A highly liquid financial market as such is able 
to accommodate large and varied issuance of financial 
instruments with minimum price effect. Here, financial 
instruments can be quickly exchanged at reasonable 
cost. [An] efficient clearing and settlement system is a 
key supporting factor that helps lower transaction 
cost.”103  
Sustainable finance requires the participation of far 
more regulatory bodies than just the financial 
regulators. To date, much of the fast-changing 
regulatory advances seen regionally and globally have 
been driven by central banks and securities and 
exchange commissions. While this report concentrates 
on the role of financial regulators, sustainable or green 
finance demands significant coordination and 
coherence with other regulators. For example, 
environmental protection agencies issue the permits 
that allow investments to go ahead. Departments of 
industries regulate the fiduciary duties of directors of 
companies,104 especially in a context where litigation 
that challenges companies’ contribution to climate 
change is increasingly common. Competition and 
consumer protection regulators are also involved, 
through implementing guardrails against the potential 
greenwashing of products and services. Real economy 
regulators, such as energy regulators with science-
based targets involving emissions reductions, or 
national electricity boards that make offtake 
agreements with set prices in renewable energy, 
similarly play a profound role in financing the energy 
transition. New green technologies, such as green 
hydrogen, may also involve regulators for carbon 
trading, the greenhouse gas quota system, or to enforce 
other compliance requirements around the carbon-
intensity of production of steel, fertilizer, and heavy 
transportation. While financial regulators’ decisions 
undoubtedly influence investment in sustainable 
finance, and are at the heart of the regulatory debate, 
they are unquestionably not the “only game in town” 
when it comes to sustainable finance. 
B. What is the role of 
financial regulators in 
sustainable finance? 
There is currently significant debate about the extent 
and substance of the role of financial regulators. On the 
one hand there has been accelerating momentum to 
develop sustainable finance taxonomies; on the other 
hand, varied definitions, and degrees of implementation 
throughout the region creates the risk of arbitraging 
opportunities and disadvantaging actors with less 
capacity. Consistency remains a work in progress. 
Nevertheless, to varying degrees across the region, 
regulators have adopted either piecemeal or in full the 
following regulatory roles related to sustainable finance 
(both Track 1 and Track 2):  
▪ Ensuring that financial stability, which is affected 
by climate change and biodiversity loss, is 
maintained in the system through macroprudential 
policies105 
▪ Ensuring adequate microprudential supervision106 
for the safety and soundness of financial 
institutions and ensuring that capital by financial 
institutions is sustainably managed 
▪ Shifting capital towards low-carbon investments

▪ Aligning national sustainable finance regulation 
with international norms and standards  
▪ Supporting policy priorities as articulated by 
member States in the Paris Agreement and related 
commitments  
▪ Confirming that sufficient information and 
capacities for the above are available throughout 
the financial system 
In the following section, the report discusses trends and 
opportunities in regulatory roles, noting that this is an 
extremely dynamic field and by time of publication the 
landscape will have evolved significantly.  
C. Trends and opportunities 
Integrating climate-related 
financial risks into macroprudential 
stability assessments remains 
challenging.  
It is now widely accepted that physical risks and 
transition risks undermine the stability of the financial 
system. Physical risks refer to the risks arising from 
weather-related events (rising sea levels, floods, heat) 
which affect financial portfolios and can be jarring for 
financial stability. Transition risks occur when 
economies move towards a less polluting, greener 
economy. Such transitions could mean that some 
sectors of the economy face big shifts in asset values or 
higher costs of doing business.107  
The “tragedy of the horizon” poses significant additional 
challenges to maintaining financial stability. Mark 
Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and 
Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, coined the 
term “tragedy of the horizon” to refer to the decade-long 
forecast used by central banks to manage monetary 
policy and financial stability. However, the catastrophic 
impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the 
traditional horizons of most actors, with actions 
undertaken today resulting in less costly adjustment.108 
As Mark Carney noted, the risks to financial stability will 
be minimised if the transition begins early and follows a 
predictable path, thereby helping the market anticipate 
the transition to a 2 degree world.109  
In addition, physical and transition risks are prone to 
being experienced as “green swans”. According to the 
Bank of International Settlements, a ‘green swan’ is a 
climate black swan, named after Nassim Nicholas 
Taleb’s popular concept for events with major effects 
that come as a surprise and are recognised only in 
hindsight. The physical and transition risks of climate 
change are characterized by deep uncertainty and 
nonlinearity, so their chances of occurring are not 
reflected in past data. These unknown unknowns make 
traditional approaches to risk management largely 
irrelevant.110 This is an indication of the challenges that 
lie ahead — not only for central banks — but for the 
entire financial system to assess and incorporate 
climate-related risks into operations.  
Climate risks translate into credit, market, underwriting, 
operational, and liquidity risks. Figure 3.1 shows the 
types and complexity of physical and transition risks, 
the latter of which are particularly difficult to forecast. 
Along with transmission channels, sources of variability, 
and five types of threats – to credit systems, the market, 
underwriting, operations, and liquidity — traditional 
methods of financial risk management are at a loss in a 
climate stress context. This profoundly affects the 
traditional methods of managing macro and 
microprudential risks in the region. It is therefore 
equally, if not more, important that individual banks and 
businesses acting in the financial system mainstream 
the diagnosis, assessment, and planning into their 
portfolios and operations. This will in turn help central 
banks perform their supervisory duties well and to 
conduct stress-tests under accurate parameters.

Figure 3.1: Transmission channels from climate risks to financial risks. 
Source: NGFS (2021a).  
Assessing risk channels, given their complexities, 
continues to be extremely challenging. According to 
recent research published at the Journal of Financial 
Regulation, difficulties in stress testing are exacerbated 
by their long-time horizon (generally 30 years) and 
radical uncertainty about possible climate pathways and 
their probability distribution. Their unprecedented and 
potentially catastrophic consequences mean that well-
established risk management tools in the financial 
industry, such as Value-at-Risk models and stress tests, 
cannot readily be used. Exploratory scenario-based 
impact assessments must be used instead. In addition, 
if climate-related risks materialize, they would affect the 
economy and the financial system as a whole and may 
be amplified by the pro-cyclical behaviour of market 
participants; the self-reinforcing reductions in bank 
lending and insurance provision; the bank-sovereign 
nexus;111 the feedback loops with the real economy; and 
network and cross-border effects.112  
In addition, the ability to perform appropriate climate-
based stress testing by regulators is contingent on the 
data quality and capabilities of regulators. The Network 
for Greening the Financial System has made significant 
advances to develop climate-based scenarios for 
regulators which, due to the challenges and costs of 
creating such scenarios, are beyond most individual 
institutions. The first iteration of NGFS scenarios was 
released in 2020.  In Asia and the Pacific, four central 
banks as of November 2022 concluded a first exercise 
in stress-testing based on the three NGFS scenarios 
known as the “hothouse” scenario, the “disorderly 
transition” scenario, and the “orderly transition” 
scenario, as shown in Figure 3.2. These scenarios imply 
significant per cent changes in GDP from physical and 
transition risks as seen in Panel 2 of Figure 3.2. For 
example, the delayed transition scenario implies a close 
to 5 per cent reduction in GDP globally by 2050 due to 
the manifestation of both physical and transition risks.  
While regulators in the region are increasingly 
conducting climate stress-testing, gaps in data and 
abilities remains a major hurdle. The four regulators who 
have already conducted NGFS stress testing at time of 
writing include: the Monetary Authority of Singapore, 
People’s Bank of China, Japan Financial Services 
Agency/Bank of Japan, and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. 
The Reserve Bank of India, Bank Indonesia, Bank of 
Korea, Bank Negara Malaysia, and the National Bank of 
Georgia are five additional central banks that are in the 
midst of conducting the scenario exercise or planning to 
do so.113 According to the NGFS, in light of challenges 
posed by data gaps and methodological uncertainties, 
no members as of yet have envisaged calibrating 
prudential policies, such as capital requirements, on the 
basis of their exercise.114

financial risks due to climate-related risks.

Ensuring financial stability also 
hinges upon climate and nature-
related disclosures and data from 
individual financial institutions.  
Supervisory authorities report the lack of granular and 
sectoral counterparty-level emissions data, as well as a 
dearth of consistent and comparable data reporting 
standards for counterparties and financial institutions, 
as a major challenge.115 This is echoed by the Financial 
Stability Board,116 which reports that “the lack of 
sufficiently consistent, comparable, granular and 
reliable climate data reported by financial institutions is 
one main challenge for authorities in the development of 
supervisory and regulatory approaches to climate-
related risks. Areas where data contribute to identifying 
exposures and understanding the impacts from climate-
related risks include: sufficiently granular data on 
sectors or economic activities that are sensitive, 
vulnerable or exposed to physical, transition and liability 
risks; financial institutions’ exposures to such sectors or 
economic activities; geographical location of financial 
institutions’ exposures most prone to physical risk; and 
financial institutions’ and their counterparties’ reporting 
of carbon-related metrics, including Scope 1, 2, and 3 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.”117 Figure 3.3 below 
is an analysis118 of more than 2,000 companies on 22 
stock exchanges in G20 countries, and shows the top 
100 Scope 1 emissions data. Such data allows capital 
markets regulators to work with issuers to take well-
calibrated and orderly actions towards the net-zero 
transition.

Note: the figure shows the analysis of the scope 1 emissions of the top 100 issuers by market capitalization listed on each of the 22 
exchanges in G20 countries. 
 
As outlined by the Bank of England in 2015, and is worth 
being reminded of, data is required to be consistent, 
comparable, reliable, clear and efficient. This means 
that data should be consistent in scope and objective 
across the relevant industries and sectors. 
Comparable means it should allow investors to assess 
peers and aggregate risks. Reliable means that it should 
ensure that users can trust the data. Clear means that it 
should be presented in a way that makes complex 
information understandable. Efficient means that it 
should minimize costs and burdens while maximizing 
benefits. Convergence in standards across jurisdictions 
ensures comparability regarding the quality and scope 
of data.  
This is not yet the case. Standards and frameworks are 
rapidly fluctuating and improving for the better, but it 
remains widely acknowledged that current sustainable 
finance data disclosure frameworks do not (yet) meet 
these objectives — impeding uptake and application. 
Furthermore, the availability of quality data is critical to 
set appropriate science-based targets and benchmarks 
for future pathways of corporates, financial institutions, 
and sectors. However, there are reasons to be optimistic 
about the state of data for the sake of sustainable 
finance. The International Sustainability Standards 
Board (ISSB) plans to streamline sustainability 
disclosures through its 2023 standard-setting work; the 
EU’s Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulation will 
apply to all EU capital investing in the region; and the 
upcoming United States Securities and Exchange 
disclosure requirements will modernize reporting 
structures. We hope that sustainability and green 
disclosures will increasingly become consistent, clear, 
and comparable.  
In the meantime, voluntary international climate-related 
disclosures to support regulators with the right 
information is increasing by leaps and bounds. 
According to the Taskforce on Climate Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD),119 in its fifth annual TCFD status 
report in December 2022, a survey of asset owners and 
managers found that more than 60 per cent of managers 
and 75 per cent of owners report climate-related

information to their clients and beneficiaries. Nearly 50 
per cent of asset managers and 75 per cent of asset 
owners120 disclosed information aligned with at least 
five of the 11 recommended disclosures. In addition, 
participation in climate-related data disclosures through 
financial filings or annual reports (including integrated 
reports) surged from less than half of companies (45 
per cent) in 2017 to more than 70 per cent of companies 
in 2021.121 This clear hike in disclosures is reflected 
below in Figure 3.4.  
Figure 3.4: Implementation of the TCFD 
recommendations and use of climate-related 
disclosures. 
Source: FSB (2022b).  
Asia and the Pacific is the second leading region for 
climate-related financial disclosures, after Europe. 
According to TCFD, more than 4,227 organizations have 
become supporters of the TCFD recommendations as of 
February 2023, a number which has steadily risen since 
the recommendations were first published in 2017. 
Supporters include upwards of 1,500 financial 
institutions, responsible for $217 trillion in assets. TCFD 
supporters now span 99 countries and nearly all sectors 
of the economy, with a combined market capitalization 
of more than $26 trillion.122 Asia-Pacific organizations 
account for 46 per cent of this number (1,956) – of 
which 792 organizations became supporters between 
2022 and February 2023 (40 per cent of the total for the 
Asia-Pacific region). Figure 5 below shows the 
distribution of sectors and countries where companies 
are following TCFD disclosure requirements. Of these, 
all regions have significantly broadened their levels of 
disclosure over the past three years. While the number 
of companies (1,956) is still a tiny proportion of all the 
large companies in Asia and the Pacific,123 growing 
adoption of the practice of disclosures is nonetheless a 
positive trend that needs to be encouraged further.

Note: The list of TCFD supporters includes organizations that have publicly declared support for the TCFD and its recommendations, 
demonstrating that they are taking action to build a more resilient financial system through climate-related disclosure. TFCD supporters 
include private companies, industry associations, banks, credit rating agencies, central banks, stock exchanges, government agencies, 
and other types of organizations. 
Finally, while climate-related disclosures are gaining 
momentum, nature-related disclosures have yet to 
become mainstream. The Taskforce on Nature-Related 
Disclosures has published a draft framework125  to bring 
clarity and methodological guidance to assessments of 
nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and 
opportunities. Like climate-related disclosures, such 
disclosures should be in line with country commitments 
within the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity 
Framework. As an indication for regulators and private 
finance in the region, Table 3.1 below shows the 
preliminary scope and possible extent of the 
recommended nature-related disclosures.

Trends in microprudential 
supervision of financial institutions 
Regulators have developed environmental and social 
risk management (ESRM) guidelines for financial 
institutions in the region. Many central banks in Asia 
and the Pacific, notably in Bangladesh, Nepal, and 
Philippines, have taken active steps to develop and roll 
out ESRM guidelines for banking sectors and individual 
financial institutions. Unlike the voluntary nature of 
most roadmaps and taxonomies, ESRM guidelines — 
which incorporate policies into institutional banking 
processes and procedures — are mandatory. ESRM 
strategies are risk management focused, and as such 
they do not incorporate science-based targets or focus 
on emissions reductions. 
In addition to standard ESRM guidelines, there are 
increasing calls for financial institutions to formulate 
and disclose net-zero transition plans to regulators. The 
Taskforce on Climate Related Financial Disclosures 
recommended the introduction of climate transition 
plans in 2021, which have been further reinforced by the 
efforts of the G20 and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for 
Net Zero.126 Such transition plans, set forward by both 
financial institutions as well as real economy 
businesses, differ by jurisdiction. The latest NGFS 
stocktake of financial institutions’ transition plans127 
relates that there are a range of approaches and 
priorities put forth in transition plans. While some 
economies have focused on emissions reduction, others 
have prioritized sustainable development, enhancing 
resilience to climate change, or developing the economy 
while keeping emissions low, consistent with 
international agreements. This, in turn, changes the 
context for expectations of different jurisdictions. 
Microprudential authorities will also assess financial 
institutions’ safety and soundness during the transition 
to a low-emission economy in different ways depending 
on the prospects outlined in the plan. 
Net zero and biodiversity transition plans are 
increasingly called for. The World Wildlife Fund 
(WWF)128 further urges central banks, financial 
institutions, and actors such as insurers to adopt 
credible transition plans, set out clear and actionable 
steps to achieve science-based climate and nature 
targets, and enable an economy-wide transition towards 
sustainability. Transition plans must provide necessary 
clarity and guidance to financial market actors and have 
clear quantifiable, legally binding climate and 
biodiversity goals for 2025, 2030, and 2050. The plans 
should include all central banking, financial regulation, 
and supervision activities. The WWF asks stakeholders 
to ensure that monetary policies and financial regulatory 
instruments better reflect the economic cost and 
financial risk of “always environmentally harmful” 
economic activities, companies, and sectors as these 
assets represent the highest financial risks. Financial 
institutions lending to companies involved in 
environmentally harmful activities should face far higher 
capital requirements to account for the long-term risks 
involved. 
How regulators are supporting 
government priorities and shifting 
capital to low carbon investments 
Regulators play a key role in translating policy 
commitments into systematic actions. Every country has 
a set of policy commitments and legislation, and they 
are sometimes subject to internationally binding 
financial regulations or norms. All these provide the 
parameters for the national development of sustainable 
finance and can be summarized through one or a 
combination of the following: sustainable finance 
roadmaps, sustainable finance taxonomies, green bond 
frameworks, sustainable stock exchanges and/or other 
sustainable finance initiatives. These sustainable 
finance regulatory approaches for the most part specify 
how capital can be deployed towards environmental 
objectives and are different from the ESRM and climate 
or nature-related risk assessment approaches discussed 
above. It is important to note that although roadmaps, 
taxonomies, and other sustainable financing 
frameworks are usually not binding, they are 
nonetheless critical tools to guide the development of 
the sustainable finance ecosystem and signal the future 
intentions of regulators.  
Financial authorities are increasingly producing 
sustainable finance roadmaps presenting the pathway 
to achieve government targets. For example, in 2014,

Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK) produced 
a Sustainable Finance Roadmap as a comprehensive 
plan for promoting sustainable finance. The roadmap 
covered both the medium-term (2015–2019) and the 
longer term (2015–2024) plan for the financial services 
industry.129 The aim of the roadmap was to promote 
sustainable development through key governmental, 
industry, and international institutions. Given the 
ongoing high demand for energy to support Indonesian 
development, the sustainable finance roadmap (led by 
the financial regulator) promotes energy conservation, 
as well as the funding of new and renewable energy 
sources. Other focus areas include agriculture, 
processing industries, general infrastructure, and 
measures to assist micro-, small- and medium-sized 
enterprises. Since July 2017, OJK mandates banks to 
develop sustainable finance action plans for sustainable 
financing and to issue sustainability reports, as well as 
to report their green financing exposures.130  
Many countries globally are developing Sustainable 
Finance Roadmaps to guide this process. These 
roadmaps vary in depth and approach but are typically 
understood as something more tangible than pure 
strategy — without striving for the detail of an 
implementation plan. Most aim to describe a suite of 
sequenced tasks and activities, and assign stakeholder 
responsibilities, in a way that improves communication 
and cooperation between actors. Often the task of 
developing a roadmap is spearheaded by regulators, due 
to their convening power and thorough appreciation of 
their respective franchises – whether banking, capital 
markets, or insurance. The list of existing roadmaps in 
the region can be seen in Table 3.1 below.  
The type and purpose of each country’s sustainable 
finance roadmap is different. For example, the Bangko 
Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)’ Sustainable Finance 
Roadmap131 was prepared to a) outline the goals to 
support the current initiatives and policies to create a 
supportive environment for the widespread adoption of 
sustainable finance in the Philippines, b) determine 
priority areas and acknowledge the basis for 
improvements relating to sustainable finance, c) provide 
strategic direction and recommendations to accelerate 
sustainable finance and d) provide investment and 
policy signals to support the transition to a sustainable 
economy. Through this Roadmap, the BSP 
communicates its expectations that banks should 
disclose their sustainability strategy objectives, risk 
appetite, and risk management system in annual 
reports. In Singapore, the recent Finance for Net Zero 
Action plan announced by the Monetary Authority of 
Singapore covers four strategic outcomes around 1) 
data, definitions and disclosures, 2) a climate resilient 
financial sector (including climate-scenario analysis), 3) 
credible transition plans (supporting the adoption of 
science-based transition plans by FIs) and 4) green and 
transition solutions and markets (including an 
expansion of grant schemes totalling SGD15 million, or 
more than $11 million, over the next five years till 2028) 
to include transition bonds as well as incentives to 
encourage the early adoption of entity-level 
sustainability disclosures.132

Box 3.1: Cambodia and ASEAN sustainable finance 
roadmaps.  
ESCAP is supporting the National Bank of Cambodia in 
its development of a Sustainable Finance roadmap to 
advance Cambodia's green and social finance agenda. 
The roadmap aims to enable Cambodia to deliver on its 
climate and sustainable development goals, enhance 
Cambodia's financial sector's competitiveness and 
resilience, coordinate activities between different 
stakeholders, and analyze possible synergies and 
tradeoffs in the current financial ecosystem. 
In addition, in coordination with partners the Global 
Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and the ASEAN 
Secretariat, ESCAP is supporting the development of 
the ASEAN Green Map, a regional approach focused on 
green and climate-related financing aligned with the 
ASEAN Secretariat's vision to mobilize finance for the 
SDGs in the region. The roadmap will draw together 
stakeholder views, international best practices, and 
lessons learned. It will identify the challenges 
policymakers and market participants face and provide 
clear measures to help overcome existing barriers and 
assist with concrete steps to enhance green finance, 
particularly in ASEAN’s LDC member states. 
Furthermore, it will discuss the available opportunities 
to mobilize finance to support the environmental 
transformation needed in ASEAN to meet the SDGs by 
2030. 
Box 3.2: Thailand sustainable finance initiatives. 
Recognizing the crucial role sustainable economic growth 
plays in bringing about better living standards and 
inclusive economic development for all, in 2015 Thailand 
adopted the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development (consisting of the 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals), and, in 2016, committed to the Paris 
Agreement to advance its Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
reduction by 20 to 25 per cent from the business-as-usual 
level by 2030. 
The Three Regulators Steering Committee (Bank of 
Thailand, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the 
Office of the Insurance Commission, and the Ministry of 
Finance) is a non-statutory body that provides a regular 
platform for the three key financial regulators to discuss 
policy issues. Recognizing the importance of the finance 
sector to sustainable development, the Three Regulators 
Steering Committee formed the Sustainable Finance 
Working Group. 
On 18 August 2021, the Working Group on Sustainable 
Finance jointly published Sustainable Finance Initiatives 
for Thailand (known as the Initiatives), with one of their 
key work plans being the focus on setting the direction 
and framework to drive sustainable finance across the 
financial sector.

Green and sustainable finance taxonomies in the region 
further help direct investment towards national green 
priorities. According to ICMA, a green taxonomy is a 
classification system to identify activities or 
investments that will move a country towards meeting 
specific targets related to priority environmental 
objectives. The taxonomy aims to help financial actors 
determine which investments can be labelled as green 
or sustainable for their jurisdictions. According to the 
World Bank,133 taxonomies assist regulators to green the 
financial system by a) supporting regulatory 
interventions on the taxonomy to encourage banks to 
lend to eligible green companies, b) facilitating new 
climate or sustainability-related reporting and disclosure 
guidelines for financial market actors or enhancing 
existing ones, c) measuring financial flows toward 
sustainable development priorities at the asset, 
portfolio, institutional, and national levels and d) 
avoiding reputational risk by preventing “green-
washing”.  
Green bond frameworks can be part of taxonomies or 
exist separately. In the case of green bond frameworks, 
ICMA’s Green Bond Principles (GBP) can be considered 
a global standard for issuers. The ASEAN Green Bond 
standards are, for example, closely aligned with the 
Green Bond Principles. Developing a green bond 
framework is a crucial step to prepare for the release of 
a green bond by all issuers, including sovereign and 
corporate. The framework reveals to investors the 
critical elements of any thematic bond issuance. The 
core components of the framework include: the 
rationale and strategy; use of proceeds, including 
eligible project categories and exclusions; evaluation 
and selection processes; processes for management of 
proceeds; reporting; external reviews; and amendments 
to the framework. The framework helps to ensure that 
bonds adhere to international best practices and 
incorporate high-level oversight to ensure transparency 
and accountability. While in general green bond 
frameworks should match national green taxonomies, 
they can be developed by both sovereign and corporate 
issuers without a national taxonomy.  
Sustainable finance taxonomies allow regulators to 
guide markets based on national priorities. They provide 
information to investors to understand whether an 
economic activity is sustainable (usually and mostly 
meaning environmentally sustainable) and to navigate 
the transition to a clear environmental objective. Some 
taxonomies have an overarching objective around 
climate change mitigation, others on low-emissions 
development strategies. In the Russian Federation, for 
example, the green finance taxonomy covers both green 
and transition activities. It is compatible with recognized 
international taxonomies and reflects criteria for 
sustainable projects. For transition projects, it includes 
projects in hard-to-abate industries substantially 
contributing to the Russian Federation’s net zero target. 
Across Asia and the Pacific, many countries have 
adopted their own individual taxonomies of sustainable 
finance. Activities, assets and/or project categories, 
such as what the finance is used for, are ranked by 
contribution to environmental objectives. For example, 
activities could be labelled green, amber, or red, based 
on contribution to the environmental objectives of the 
taxonomy. 
Box 3.3: ESCAP’s work on green bond frameworks 
ESCAP is currently supporting three member 
countries (Sri Lanka, Cambodia, and Bhutan), to 
develop green and sustainability bond frameworks 
and build institutional capacity on thematic bond 
issuance. In Sri Lanka, collaboration with the Ministry 
of Finance and Sri Lanka’s Sustainable Development 
Council facilitated the development of a sovereign 
green bond framework that was subsequently 
approved by Cabinet in May 2023. ESCAP and GGGI 
will provide continued support for a second-party 
opinion of Sri Lanka’s Green Bond Framework. In 
addition, ESCAP is collaborating with Cambodia’s 
Ministry of Economy and Finance and GGGI to 
contribute to the Sovereign Thematic Bond Issuance 
section of Cambodia’s Comprehensive Policy 
Framework on the Development of Government 
Securities 2023 – 2028 and a subsequent Sustainable 
Finance Framework for future thematic bond 
issuance. In Bhutan, ESCAP and the Ministry of 
Finance of Bhutan conducted a workshop with key 
stakeholders at the end of 2022 to create shared 
understanding of the best practices and principles of 
sovereign thematic bond issuance, which will guide 
the future development of Bhutan's Sustainable 
Finance Framework, which ESCAP is supporting.

Emerging transition finance taxonomies are charting the 
path for financing activities that reduce emissions and 
move brown activities towards green activities.  
Sustainable finance taxonomies so far have mainly been 
green taxonomies that do not, for example, permit the 
financing of coal or fossil fuels. However, there is now 
increased global recognition that it is essential to 
finance transition in hard-to-abate sectors, such as the 
phase out of coal or the transition of brown to green 
activities as in the transportation sector. The recently 
released second version of the ASEAN Taxonomy 
includes not only green activities but charts a path for 
phasing out brown assets.134 It is a further example of 
how taxonomies iterate and evolve as living 
classification systems and expand to incorporate 
transition objectives as well. According to Sustainable 
Fitch, the localized approach of the ASEAN taxonomy to 
incorporate the coal phase out as a supported activity (a 
world first in taxonomies) is expected to promote more 
regional ESG-labelled debt issuances and back the 
funding needs for a scalable energy transition.135 The 
Indonesian presidency of the G20 in 2022 led to the 
formation of a framework on transition finance136 which 
guides financial institutions and real economy firms to 
identify and understand what constitutes a transition 
activity or investment opportunity and reduce the 
identification barriers, costs, and transition-washing 
risk. 
In addition to roadmaps, taxonomies, and green bond 
frameworks, some central banks also utilize directed 
lending policies towards green objectives. According to 
a survey of central banks in the region by the Asian 
Development Bank Institute,137 22 per cent (or four) of 
18 central bank respondents stated that their institution 
currently has a strategic investment mandate or 
approach to scale up private investment in low-carbon 
sectors. The research cites that to boost green finance 
in Bangladesh, banks were instructed to provide 
financial assistance to green projects, with a minimum 
of 5 per cent of their total loan disbursement or 
investment. In addition, banks and financial institutions 
were mandated to set up a climate risk fund. As much 
as 10 per cent of banks’ and financial institutions’ 
corporate social responsibility budget must be allocated 
to the climate risk fund. Funding can be undertaken 
either via the provision of grants or through financing at 
lower interest rates. Starting from December 2016,

banks and financial institutions were instructed to 
establish sustainable finance units.138 Similarly, in Viet 
Nam, in accordance with the National Green Growth 
Strategy and the National Action Plan on Green Growth 
between 2014 and 2020, the State Bank of Vietnam 
(SBV) has been assigned to lead institutional 
improvement and capacity building in the banking sector 
for green growth.139 In 2015, the SBV issued Directive 
No. 3 to promote green credit growth and incorporate 
ESRM into lending operations. Decision No. 1552 is an 
action plan for the banking sector to contribute to the 
National Green Growth Strategy to 2020.140  
Regulators are putting forth green incentives for issuers 
and borrowers. The Monetary Authority of Singapore 
(MAS) launched the Green and Sustainability-Linked 
Loan Grant Scheme (GSLS), to support corporates in 
obtaining green and sustainable financing by defraying 
up to SGD100,000 ($75,000) of the expenses of 
engaging independent service providers to validate the 
green and sustainability credentials of the loan. (This 
has now been expanded to cover the period from 2023 
to 2028 under MAS’ Finance for Net Zero Action Plan). 
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched 
the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme (GSF) 
in its 2021-22 budget to provide subsidies for eligible 
bond issuers and loan borrowers to cover their expenses 
on bond issuance up to HKD2.5 million ($320,000) and 
external review services up to HKD800,000 ($100,000). 
To support net-zero goals, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) 
introduced a new fund-provisioning measure in 2021 
providing funds for investments or loans made by 
financial institutions that contribute to addressing 
climate change at a zero-interest rate. 
Box 3.4: Cambodian Sustainable Bond Accelerator. 
While bond issuers in developing markets generally face considerable barriers to issuance, issuers of thematic bonds 
(green, social, and sustainability bonds) are further constrained due to the limited awareness and capacities on the side 
of issuers as well as high issuance costs. In March 2023, ESCAP, the Global Green Growth Institute, and the Securities 
and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia (SERC), in collaboration with the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF) 
and GuarantCo, launched the Cambodia Sustainable Bond Accelerator to provide technical assistance and support to 
prospective private sector issuers.  
Three private-sector bond issuers have been selected and will be provided with support, including developing bond 
frameworks, meeting best practices, facilitating post-issuance reporting, and providing co-financing options to decrease 
bond issuance costs and investment support. As H.E. Sou Socheat, Director General of the Securities and Exchange 
Regulator of Cambodia (SERC), noted, "This is a crucial step towards growing Cambodia's capital market and achieving 
our goal of encouraging the use of green, sustainability, and sustainability-linked bonds to aid private sector growth and 
sustainable development in Cambodia." Through this support, ESCAP and its partners will be supporting the early stages 
of green and sustainable bond issuance in Cambodia.

There is growing momentum and consensus to 
mainstream green regulation in the region. The 
International Sustainability Standards Board global 
baseline disclosure standards, released in June 2023, 
will take a further step towards taxonomy unification 
and allow for comparability and interoperability between 
taxonomies across the region. Between the EU’s 
Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulation, which will 
apply to all EU capital investing in the region, the 
upcoming United States Securities and Exchange 
disclosure requirements, and the strengthening 
Environmental and Social Risk Management 
frameworks, there is now a remarkably fast-growing 
consensus regarding the need for green regulation in the 
region. The pressure on policymakers, regulators, and 
private finance to mainstream sustainable/green 
principles into regular investing, credit decisions, 
operations, risk management, and reporting is mounting. 
We believe this means sustainable finance taxonomies 
will only iterate to become even more clearer and 
convergent, especially on environmentally-focused and 
science-based definitions. This is important to reduce 
high transaction costs, arbitraging opportunities and to 
create an efficient and level playing field. In addition, 
convergence towards common frameworks is essential 
to reduce global emissions. Otherwise, one investor 
divesting from brown activities may be replaced by 
another investor who does not need to follow similar 
guidance in their region, thus not reducing overall global 
emissions.

D. Challenges 
This section discusses some of the key challenges that 
regulators face, as revealed in the discussion of the 
trends and opportunities that they face. 
Clear, consistent, comparable, reliable, and efficient 
data is lacking. One of the key elements required for a 
thriving sustainable finance regulatory framework is 
data. From the perspective of scaling sustainable 
finance, the reporting frameworks for most financial 
institutions in the Asia-Pacific region do not capture 
flows of sustainable finance. Most reporting to 
regulators is rooted in prudential monitoring and 
focused on specific sector, product, or risk exposures. 
There is little transparency on the ultimate purposes of 
funding and how it may either directly or indirectly affect 
sustainable development goals. From the viewpoint of 
making finance sustainable, few regulators in the Asia-
Pacific region have the complex mix of data required 
from financial institutions, government, supranational 
agencies, and scientific bodies to effectively model 
climate risks. Nor do many have the complex models 
required to measure and monitor climate risk within 
their portfolios, or the expertise to build or adapt 
existing models for use. While the forthcoming 
disclosure requirements will apply to companies that fall 
within those jurisdictions, for the multitude of FIs and 
corporates in Asia and the Pacific to which global 
disclosure requirements may not apply, data will 
continue to be a challenge.  
The costs of collecting, cleaning, verifying, and 
publishing data continue to be disproportionately high 
for smaller firms and financial institutions. Analyzing 
and collating data from both financial institutions and 
real economy clients can be expensive, especially where 
substantial changes in business and operating models 
are called for. Regulators are already reporting concerns 
from financial institutions and their industry 
associations about the potential cost of implementing 
measures to support sustainable finance. They argue 
that many customers, particularly SME bank borrowers, 
are ill-placed to provide the required data, and the 
additional compliance costs will result in reduced 
access to finance. There is already a perception 
amongst bank subsidiaries with parents in more highly 
regulated jurisdictions that the reporting obligations of 
the parent may cause them to be uncompetitive. 
Establishing a “level playing field” both within a 
jurisdiction (and regionally) is important to avoid the 
dangers of regulatory arbitrage. While new technologies 
and artificial intelligence will naturally reduce the costs 
of analysis and monitoring, nevertheless data collection 
is an activity that needs to be embedded at all levels of 
an organization and requires investment.  
Better alignment of taxonomies across countries is 
needed to level the playing field. As reported by 
Refinitiv,141 a global provider of green finance data, there 
are multiple ongoing conversations about taxonomies 
around the world. The implications for financial market 
participants are significant because most organizations 
are global in nature and operate across boundaries. 
Having to comply with multiple “definitions” can be 
costly, risky, and may not deliver the transparency and 
reduced risk of greenwashing objectives underpinning 
the regulatory developments. Investors also report142 
that for companies operating across multiple Asian 
jurisdictions, this multiplicity presents a difficult and 
expensive compliance and reporting challenge, 
particularly when businesses are already straining under 
the weight of increasing anti-financial-crime compliance 
burdens (as well as a shortage of expertise to manage 
these burdens). 
Coordination and coherence between policymakers, 
standard-setters and regulators continues to be 
essential. In this chapter we have focused mainly on 
financial sector regulators, but there are a wide range of 
other intermediary actors such as industry associations 
(both financial sector and real economy); international 
and national standard setting bodies; government 
agencies; academic and training institutions; and 
scientific and research agencies, amongst others, that 
are relevant to sustainable finance products. Tight 
coordination between these players is essential for the 
effective and timely rendition of government sustainable 
finance ambitions into the business and operating 
models of financial institutions.

“We need to convince all our stakeholders about their 
engagement and move beyond individual roles and individual 
mandates, because at the end of the day this is going to help all 
of us to accomplish all of our mandates if we concentrate 
properly” T M J Y P Fernando, Deputy Governor, Central Bank of 
Sri Lanka.   
Only a few regulators have committed to mandatory 
green regulation, preferring to rely on voluntary 
approaches. For example, banks in Hong Kong, China, 
are expected to start making disclosures in line with 
guidelines from the international Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures from mid-2023 and this 
will become mandatory in 2025. In December 2021, the 
Singapore Exchange (SGX) mandated climate and board 
diversity disclosures.  
While climate stress testing is underway, regulators are 
not currently incorporating nature-related concerns into 
their frameworks. The World Wildlife Fund’s 2022 
Sustainable Regulation Annual Report evaluates 
progress on sustainable financial regulations and 
central bank activities in 44 jurisdictions representing 
over 88 per cent of the global GDP and has put forward 
an ambitious series of recommendations on nature-
based macroprudential supervision. Recommendation 
3143 states that central banks should consider climate 
and nature as a single twin crisis and ensure their 
monetary policy implementation does not contribute to 
either climate change or nature loss. The WWF further 
proposes that central banks and supervisors should 
further develop a risk-based classification framework 
for sectors and assets exposed to biodiversity loss, 
which may enhance the data required for stress-testing 
and scenario analyses and reallocate capital flows from 
biodiversity-negative to -positive projects.144 Lastly, 
supervisors should mandate financial institutions to 
report their management of nature-related risk and 
opportunity based on the Taskforce on Nature-related 
Financial Disclosures (TNFD) framework.145 According 
to the WWF's Sustainable Regulations and Central Bank 
Activities (SUSREG) Tracker, only about 20 per cent of 
the jurisdictions have nature-related issues listed among 
a list of general considerations, the remaining 80 per 
cent  lacking any supervisory consideration. Only one 
Asia-Pacific jurisdiction has clearly requested banks to 
consider deforestation issues in decision-making.146 
Capacity constraints will continue to disadvantage 
lesser developed economies. Regulators and 
policymakers together will need to conduct proper 
environmental impact assessments, map their 
biodiversity and carbon sink assets, estimate and 
protect against climate-related losses in their portfolios, 
institute locally-appropriate safeguards in the financial 
system, shift their economy to low emissions pathways 
carefully, and ensure that a just transition is maintained. 
Therefore, without the appropriate skills and capacity at 
the level of financial regulators, the danger is that 
inappropriate, long-term investments are made which 
lock in countries to unsustainable and economically 
disadvantageous pathways. Furthermore, differences in 
standards between LDCs, SIDS, and other countries in 
the region could mean that there are less sustainable 
financial flows to those who most need it, as the stricter 
ESG policies of major financial institutions toss these 
economies into the “too hard” basket. This applies not 
only to commercial financiers, but also to MDBs and 
bilateral DFIs who tend to make bigger deals in bigger 
economies.  
Integrity matters. According to the United Nations 
Environment Programme’s Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI), 
in the absence of a universally accepted definition of 
what is green and sustainable, it is important that 
effective frameworks, taxonomy standards, and 
regulations set the foundation for global best practices 
and an equal playing field. In this regard, Asia-Pacific 
regulators can play a role in encouraging the growth of a 
robust ecosystem for third party verification/ assurance 
and impact assessment. Strengthening the green 
credentials of businesses and projects can further 
assuage greenwashing concerns. 
E. Recommendations  
This section outlines recommendations for the region’s 
regulators, in line with the trends, opportunities and 
challenges discussed. In addition, these 
recommendations (which are set out in detail here) have 
been aggregated into our final set of ten principles of 
action for the region to bridge the sustainable finance 
gap in Asia and the Pacific, set forward in the final 
chapter.

Effort should be undertaken to facilitate interoperability 
between taxonomies. As discussed, the growth of 
individual taxonomies implies that autonomy is 
maintained at the country level and that locally 
appropriate pathways are embedded in such 
taxonomies. However, the downsides of varied 
taxonomies across the region are significant. 
Compliance costs are higher, risks are multiplied, 
arbitraging opportunities may be created and an 
efficient and level playing field is not created. One large 
institutional investor in the region has outlined three 
areas to steer Asia-Pacific taxonomies147 to 
convergence: a) adopt a principles-based approach to 
provide flexibility when tailoring taxonomies in different 
regions and economies; b) align taxonomies with widely-
adopted global or international standards, such as the 
Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) between the 
European Union and China; and c) actively collaborate 
amongst regulators, policymakers, and stakeholders to 
develop transparent, relevant, comparable, and 
interoperable standards and guidance. 
Roadmaps, taxonomies, and sustainable finance 
frameworks put forth by regulators should be aligned 
with policymakers’ commitments, especially the NDCs. 
One example is Thailand. In December 2022, the Bank of 
Thailand and Thailand's Securities and Exchange 
Commission issued a consultation on their pilot 
sustainable finance taxonomy, which includes 
objectives largely drawn from the EU taxonomy and a 
traffic light system to categorize activities. This 
followed the November 2022 announcement of 
Thailand’s second updated nationally determined 
contribution, which showed a more ambitious target to 
reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30‑40 per cent 
from the projected business-as-usual level by 2030. The 
Thai government also announced a revised version of its 
Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Development Strategy, which proposed accelerated 
efforts to combat greenhouse emissions. 
Regulators should ensure fair and predictable 
enforcement of current green finance requirements, for 
example around ESRM management. A complaint often 
heard in emerging markets is that while the ESRM 
guidance by the central bank exists on paper, 
enforcement is not always fairly implemented, allowing 
financial institutions who are not actively penalized or 
deterred to charge more competitive pricing. Ensuring 
that fair enforcement is a key priority, and that there are 
no exceptions (and thus ensuring adequate staff and 
supervision to ensure comprehensive fair enforcement) 
is therefore essential to create a level playing field.  
Strengthening monitoring, reporting, and verification 
capacity in markets. One of the most vexing challenges 
faced by many emerging markets is the absence of ESG 
Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) capacity 
and other ESG data vendors or ratings agencies. Organic 
development is inhibited without a critical mass of 
corporate customers or project sponsors, and the 
demand from the latter is curtailed by the lack of a 
competitive and competent local market. Furthermore, 
financial sector industry associations and training 
bodies should also take care to ensure that both the 
theory and practice of sustainable finance is embedded 
in academic curricula and professional qualifications for 
financial services professionals. 
More supervisors from the region should join peer-
learning based international alliances. International 
peer-learning is of great importance when embarking on 
the uncharted journey of scaling up sustainable finance. 
Financial regulators are increasingly sharing knowledge, 
developing common approaches, and attempting to 
understand the landscape both within and outside their 
own country through membership in key peer-based 
international organizations. These include the Network 
for Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the 
Financial System, which consists of 121 regulatory 
authorities and 19 observers; the Sustainable Banking 
and Finance Network housed at the International 
Financial Corporation, consisting of financial sector 
regulators, central banks, ministries of finance, 
ministries of environment and industry associations; and 
the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. The regulatory and 
policy enabling environment surrounding climate finance 
is evolving by leaps and bounds in developed countries, 
and this rising tide will inexorably arrive at less 
developed countries. The advantage that less developed 
countries have in this regard is that they can leapfrog 
the learning journey by learning from developed 
countries, and take advantage of existing training, new 
regulatory technology, and political economy lessons 
learned on how to cascade regulations that avoid vested 
interests.

Mandatory verification and audit could accelerate 
compliance in the region.  This remains a topic of 
debate, and only a few jurisdictions in the region for 
example China, Hong Kong, China, and Singapore (to 
name a few) have moved towards mandatory 
regulations in green finance. Nevertheless, given the 
urgency of meeting the 1.5C goal, and in terms of 
pushing the real economy faster towards the net zero 
transition, mandatory requirement of, and/or verification 
of climate-related disclosures can be a powerful stick 
while also unleashing green investment and green jobs 
as a significant growth opportunity. This was also 
echoed by banking leaders as part of UNEP-FI’s 
Leadership Council meeting. While Council members 
welcomed the ISSB’s draft sustainability standards, 
although voluntary, they said sustainability reporting 
should be treated like financial accounting and allow for 
auditing. They also recognized that a harmonized 
approach should recognize country and sector 
differences and allow time to set and comply with 
national sustainability disclosure rules.148 
For LDCs and SIDS, regulators should continue to 
prioritize standard financial sector development. While it 
was beyond the scope of this report to discuss the 
importance of deepening and expanding traditional 
financial sectors, it is important to appreciate that 
sustainable finance is still just finance, and most of the 
barriers that impede access to finance that currently 
prevail, will equally apply to sustainable finance flows. 
Regulators in LDCs and SIDs should continue to pay 
attention to mainstreaming financial sector 
development including the following standard themes: 
▪ 
Deepening formal savings and investments: 
Increasing domestic savings and the role of 
investment to capitalize the formal financial 
sector remains vital. 
▪ 
Improving financial inclusion: Boosting access to 
finance for adaptation to climate change and 
local mitigation efforts such as off-grid 
renewables etc. 
▪ 
Developing access to finance for sustainable 
enterprise: Overcoming gaps in financing for 
small and medium enterprises (SMEs) 
(particularly larger ones seeking to expand fixed 
assets and transform value chains) remains a 
major challenge in many Asia-Pacific markets. 
▪ 
Growing capital markets: Countries accumulating 
long-term pools of domestic capital should 
improve market and legal infrastructure to match 
savings and investments with longer-term 
financing for financial institutions and corporates. 
 F. Conclusion 
This is a time of great change and forward momentum 
for financial regulators in Asia and the Pacific. Like 
policymakers, regional cooperation is of the utmost 
importance to ensure interoperability between regulatory 
frameworks, convergence towards widely accepted 
norms around investment aligned with climate goals and 
equalizing the playing field. To establish a level playing 
field, however, special attention must be paid to the 
least developed countries and small island developing 
states. These countries should not be disadvantaged by 
the imposition of standards and norms that 
disproportionately redirect capital elsewhere. This is not 
an easy task, but regional cooperation can do much to 
reduce fragmentation and present a unified approach.

4. WHAT CAN PRIVATE 
FINANCE DO? 
A. Introduction 
The role of private finance to meet global climate goals 
and the sustainable development goals has never been 
more important than right now. This comes at a time 
when expansionary fiscal support by governments are 
constrained by difficult macroeconomic conditions. 
Furthermore the staggering size of the amounts to be 
financed in order to meet these goals means that private 
finance must be crowded in at substantial scale and 
pace. While the actions of policymakers and regulators 
are critical in creating enabling conditions for private 
finance to invest at greater scale and pace, the call for 
private finance actors to expand their activities and 
deepen pre-investment activities is increasing.  
The universe of private finance in Asia and the Pacific is 
vast and growing, with each actor bearing distinct 
incentives and challenges. The universe includes banks 
who lend to businesses and entrepreneurs in the real 
economy; capital market issuers of equity and debt 
securities, usually businesses and financial institutions; 
asset owners such as pension funds, sovereign wealth 
funds, foundations, endowments, trusts, and family 
offices; and asset managers, such as mutual fund 
managers, investment advisors, and stockbrokers. For 
the purposes of this report, we also include development 
financial institutions, such as multilateral development 
banks like the Asian Development Bank and the World 
Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation; bilateral 
development financial institutions, such as the Dutch 
Entrepreneurial Development Bank (FMO), the United 
States Development Finance Corporation (DFC), British 
International Investment (BII), the Norwegian Investment 
Fund (Norfund), and the Swiss Investment Fund for 
Emerging Markets (SIFEM); as well as some national 
development banks (NDBs).  
Private finance has historically operated under a 
traditional fiduciary mandate to provide risk-managed 
growth and returns (as well as other specific mandates) 
in good faith to stakeholders. It does this through 
financing specific projects or entities in various sectors 
of the economy, such as industry, services, energy, 
agriculture, transportation etc.  In recent years, other 
mandates such as specific environmental, climate and 
social impact objectives (Track 1) or environment, social 
and governance (ESG) risk management mandates 
(Track 2) have been added, over and beyond what may 
be regulatorily required in the investor’s jurisdiction. 
These include environmental, climate and social impact 
mandates related to the use of proceeds or objectives 
(Track 1) or environment, social and governance (ESG) 
risk management mandates (Track 2).  
Today, the nature of fiduciary duty is changing around 
the world. Historically private finance has operated 
under managing appropriate risk-return ratios as part of 
their oversight and duty of care related fiduciary duties 
and climate risk was seen as a non-fiduciary issue. 
Directors and trustees around the world are now re-
evaluating their roles to include climate risk as a 
standard financial risk, especially as such risks now 
have become increasingly foreseeable and thus can be 
legitimately considered to be part of their oversight and 
duty of care responsibilities. In a correlated trend, 
climate litigation has also risen globally.149  
The financial risk-return profile is naturally driven by the 
regulatory framework in place, which is rapidly evolving. 
Often, two regulatory frameworks related to sustainable 
finance are in play simultaneously. The country where 
the underlying projects, activities, and sectors are 
located has its own mandatory or voluntary sustainable 
finance (ESG and/or climate) standards; the second 
sustainable framework is in the country where the asset 
owner or manager is based. It is important to note that 
the risk-return profile is also heavily influenced by the 
perceptions of risk related to the destination country, 
manifested in that country’s exchange rate as well as its 
sovereign credit rating.

Many asset owners, especially pension funds and 
insurance funds, are prohibited by their mandate from 
investing in non-investment-grade projects or entities, 
due to their responsibility to provide a “safe pair of 
hands” for clients. Deposit-regulated financial 
institutions, MDBs, DFIs, and other banks are required to 
comply with regulation on risk-weighted capital 
adequacy ratios, meaning they must reserve a certain 
amount of capital to protect against their risk-weighted 
lending. Reserving capital also means that they are 
unable to lend out that reserved capital and obtain 
interest revenue, affecting the profit of the institution. 
Put simply, lending to riskier activities means less profit 
not only due to the inherent risk of activities going into 
default, but also because of the need to set aside more 
reserves; and the implication that this ‘idle capital’ will 
produce less interest revenue.150 In addition, many asset 
owners and managers have pension funds or mutual 
funds that are dollar, euro, yen, or yuan denominated. 
When they invest in other countries, they take on the 
exchange rate risk, which substantially influences the 
risk-return profile of investments, even though it does 
not change the underlying real risk-return profiles of the 
activities themselves. 
This means that riskier projects, entities, and countries 
(such as the Least Developed Countries) cannot qualify 
under traditional norms as a destination for many funds. 
It also means that these riskier projects, entities, and 
activities located in such countries — which if funded, 
might make substantial contributions to emissions 
reductions or to the SDGs — unfortunately entail 
extremely high capital costs for financing. Therefore, 
only projects or entities that can cover the capital costs 
and/or investors who either do not have to comply with 
capital reserve requirements or have high risk tolerance 
can invest in such projects.  
In practice, this means that for private finance to flow 
naturally to such “riskier” projects, they must generate 
very high returns. For example, projects in new green 
technologies, novel nature-based finance, or renewable 
energy in LDCs, who face such parameters may have to 
generate much more profit than less-risky projects 
(located for example in countries with higher credit 
ratings, or in established sectors where risks can be 
clearly mitigated), just to cover the higher capital costs 
of financing. This naturally drastically reduces the pool 
of investment-ready project (under traditional norms of 
investment-readiness).  
For such projects where the potential to achieve 
environmental impact is high, and the underlying project 
is sound, concessional and risk-sharing finance as well 
as local currency financing is essential. Concessional 
finance is below market-rate finance and takes on many 
forms, ranging from loans and grants to technical 
assistance or guarantees. The degree of concessionality 
is also highly heterogeneous. Financing from MDBs, 
DFIs, NDBs, overseas development assistance (ODA) 
and other grant or concessional capital can be used to 
“de-risk” these projects, drive up their “grade” and 
safety, and attract more and cheaper commercial 
financing that can be layered on top of the capital 
stack.151 It also exemplifies why local-currency financing 
into such projects is of critical importance if the scale 
and pace of private finance is to be accelerated because 
local-currency financing can fund projects that do not 
have to reach a higher rate of return simply to cover 
exchange rate risk.  
This places a focus on how enough ‘bankable’ projects, 
activities and entities can be built, to investor-
specifications, in a regulatorily compliant manner, to 
meet climate goals, at speed. Different investors in the 
capital stack have different requirements. Therefore, it 
is fundamental that a pipeline of projects, activities, and 
entities with adequate risk-return-mandate profiles are 
generated at scale and pace to enable Asia and the 
Pacific to its meet climate and SDG goals. The scale of 
this challenge should not be underestimated, nor the 
requirements of project preparatory work (and costs) 
required to substantively build viable project pipelines. 
This also requires a new way of building projects – 
especially in sectors and areas, such as in renewables 
or in new decarbonization technologies, where 
regulation has not yet emerged and, therefore, costs are 
particularly prohibitive, and where new industries and 
decarbonisation technologies risk upsetting long-
entrenched balances of power and interests that may 
exist. This new way necessitates deeper participation by 
investors in the pre-investment stage of pipeline 
building.

It is time for shareholders, boards, and personnel to 
enact accelerated change. While many private finance 
institutions are already working to accelerate change, 
now it is time for shareholders, boards, and personnel to 
accelerate their response to the challenge. Considerable 
wealth has been created over the last two decades in 
financial markets, along with rising inequalities and 
huge adverse climate impacts. It is now time for 
substantial change. Hitherto, in pricing projects, 
activities and entities and in realizing returns, private 
finance has long enjoyed not being required to 
incorporate the environmental (or social) externalities of 
these costs, whilst also enjoying low costs of capital 
due to low inflation. Many shareholders and boards are 
indeed rising to this challenge with voluntary 
stewardship codes and net-zero commitments. Yet 
given the mounting consequences of inaction, more 
needs to be done at urgent scale and pace to turn such 
commitments into reality.  
This chapter focuses on how to unlock more finance for 
climate action. While the extent of change required in all 
asset classes and instruments, owners and managers, 
jurisdictions and geographies across Asia and the 
Pacific is beyond the scope of this report, we discuss a 
few key issues which are critical to unlocking further 
private finance to meet climate goals. These include: the 
building of bankable projects in renewable energy and 
new decarbonization technologies, such as green 
hydrogen, both of which have a direct link to reducing 
emissions and meeting the 1.5-2C goal; the role of 
green instruments such as green bonds, debt for 
climate/nature swaps and green loans in financing; the 
role of MDBs in unlocking further financing, and the role 
of local currency financing in bringing down risks, 
lowering transaction costs and in financing such 
development.  
B. Trends and opportunities 
The Asia-Pacific region is predominantly a loan market, 
which continues to be at the frontier of the transition to 
net zero in the region. While some capital markets in the 
Asia-Pacific region are extremely deep and liquid, 
trading cutting-edge structured financial products, the 
predominant financial instrument used for investment 
purposes in Asia and the Pacific is still the standard 
loan product from banks to corporates. There is also a 
correlation between the size of bank lending to private 
sector, and the level of financial development in the 
country, as seen in Figure 1 below. While figures on total 
bank lending in the region are varied, one estimate152 of 
the top 50 largest banks in Asia alone places their total 
asset size as of April 2023 at more than $56.5 trillion. 
Naturally this includes all financial products, but it is still 
a clear indication of the depth of funds that can 
potentially be mobilized towards climate action.

Banks are slowly moving from a Track 2 approach, 
where all lending was sustainably managed, to also 
increasingly direct lending towards green, sustainable 
and sustainability-linked uses and outcomes. 
Sustainable loans, based on sustainable loan principles, 
are generally structured in the same way as standard 
loans, except that the loan proceeds are tracked and 
allocated to eligible sustainability objectives. 
Sustainable loans also require transparency about how 
the sustainable projects are selected and how the funds 
are allocated. There are consumer or smallholder 
agricultural products that are easier to package as part 
of a sustainable loan portfolio like: 
▪ Consumer loans for clean cooking, household 
solar, energy efficient home improvement, low 
emissions vehicles, etc. 
▪ Buyer credit or supplier pre-financing for value 
chains, particularly for sustainable agricultural 
value chain inputs, such as: 
 Environmentally friendly fertilizer, herbicides, or 
pesticides 
 Climate and disease resistant crop varieties and 
more productive livestock husbandry 
 Irrigation equipment 
 Farm enterprise solar or biogas installations 
 
Increasing use of sustainability-linked loans allow for 
more flexibility, if structured and verified well. 
Sustainability-linked loans involve setting "sustainability 
performance targets" for borrowers (e.g. internal targets 
such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions; improving 
energy efficiency; reducing pollution; increasing 
biodiversity; reforestation; conducting external 
assessments or achieving a sustainability certification 
or rating). If targets are met, the borrower is rewarded 
with reduced loan interest rates, or penalized with higher 
interest rates if key performance indicators (KPIs) are 
not met. Unlike green loans, the proceeds of 
sustainability-linked loans (SLLs) do not need to be 
allocated exclusively to green projects; rather, they 
incentivize borrowers to improve their overall

74 
 
sustainability profile or targets. These can be technically 
more difficult to design and structure, but are also more 
amenable for jurisdictions, sectors, or customers in the 
early stages of the adoption of sustainability standards. 
SLLs may be more suitable for SMEs as well. SLLs open 
the sustainable loan market to companies in a wider 
variety of sectors and to smaller companies which are 
unable to overcome entry barriers to green loans or 
issuing a green bond. SMEs are a likely candidate for 
SLLs since they may be unable to commit the entire 
proceeds of a loan to specific green projects. They are 
also much more amenable to a full suite of flexible 
credit products because the incentive can be placed 
around the “relationship” rather than a strict “use of 
proceeds” which tends to require a fixed term capital 
investment loan. 
Within loan markets, green, sustainable, and 
sustainability-linked lending is on the rise but is still 
small.  As seen in Figure 4.2 below, sustainability-linked 
lending is particularly growing, reflecting its increasing 
versatility to finance entities rather than projects or 
activities; therefore, allowing more “unrestricted” 
funding. Sustainability-linked lending can also ensure a 
direct tie to sustainability outcomes and objectives, 
depending on the KPIs used. In Asia and the Pacific, 
banks are still at the frontline in the transition to net 
zero, and clearer and more effective regulation can drive 
banks to embark or accelerate the transition to net zero 
in the region.

In terms of corporate GSS+ bond issuances and lending, 
the top-two categories in 2022 were green bonds ($95 
billion) and SLLs ($72 billion). Corporate bond 
issuances increased in 2022 compared to 2021 for 
social and transition bonds, but decreased for green, 
sustainability, and sustainability-linked bonds, as shown 
in Figure 4.4 below. In terms of corporate borrowing of 
GSS+ loans, sustainability-linked loans and social loans 
made remarkable progress during that period.  
On the other hand, lending to fossil fuels and coal in the 
region is still on the rise. As can be seen from recent 
research from the IMF,158 in Figure 4.5 below, the debt 
levels (including corporate bonds and corporate loans) 
of companies in the coal value chain, as well as in oil 
and gas, in Asia and the Pacific continue to surge, and 
are larger compared to other geographies in the globe.  
Asia and the Pacific is also home to a significant 
number of asset owners, with a very high volume of 
assets under management. Recent research shows that 
the world’s top 100 asset owners’ assets under 
management (AUM) totalled $25.7 trillion at the end of 
2021, growing 9.4 per cent from the previous year.159 Of 
these, Asia and the Pacific accounts for 36.1 per cent of 
total AUM, making it the largest region in the study.160 
The Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) of 
Japan remains the largest asset owner in the world, with 
an AUM of $1.7 trillion as of end 2021, and the China 
Investment Corporation was the third largest asset 
owner in the world (AUM of $1.2 trillion).161 Additionally, 
the top 20 asset owners of this top 100 made up 55 per 
cent of total AUM (i.e. more than $12 trillion), 
representing a small group of private finance 
stakeholders (mainly pension funds and sovereign 
wealth funds) that can take forward the transition to net 
zero for trillions of dollars of assets.162 Such asset 
owners need to convert their net zero commitments into 
faster action, including transition plans with targets for 
2030 and 2040.  
Stock exchanges in the region continue to be a 
significant source of capital but market capitalization 
has been relatively stable. Listed equity capital across 
the region’s major stock markets continues to be a 
major source of private finance, with the potential to be 
turned towards climate action in a faster manner. Figure 
4.6 below lists the market capitalization of the region’s 
major stock exchanges by year and shows the relative 
values of total equity capital raised in the last four years 
across the region. China, Japan, and Hong Kong, China, 
remain the most popular destinations for capital raised, 
with the highest volumes of market capitalization.

Asian banks and private finance are still considerably 
slow to make net zero commitments. At the time of 
writing, there were 131 banks globally that have made 
net zero commitments to align their lending and 
investment portfolios with net zero emissions by 2050, 
as part of the UN-convened Net Zero Banking Alliance 
(NZBA) — the industry alliance for banks under the 
Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. Signatory 
banks also commit to setting and publicly disclosing 
2030 targets within 18 months of joining the NZBA. Out 
of the 131 banks who have made net zero commitments, 
33 members were from ESCAP’s Asia-Pacific region. 
Twenty-three banks were based in Australia, New 
Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and Japan. Of the 
remaining 10 banks, three were from Bangladesh, two 
from Malaysia, four from Türkiye, and one from the 
Russian Federation.166

Box 4.1: Foreign direct investment into climate 
mitigation and adaptation 
Foreign direct investment (FDI) has an important role to 
play in limiting climate change and filling in climate 
finance gaps globally. Yet despite ample opportunities 
for FDI to contribute to addressing climate change in 
Asia and the Pacific, greenfield investment, or 
investment in new productive activity, FDI flows to 
climate mitigation and adaptation have been declining 
over the past several years. Meanwhile both the value 
and volume of climate mitigation projects are 
significantly larger than climate adaptation projects. For 
example, since 2016 there have been 1,218 climate 
mitigation projects worth $247 billion, compared to 83 
climate adaptation projects worth $2.7 billion (Figure 8). 
In 2022 there was a pronounced loss of momentum in 
climate mitigation FDI, which was accompanied by 
growing investment in fossil fuels in the region. 
 
Figure 4.8: FDI inflows into climate mitigation and 
adaptation versus fossil fuels in Asia and the Pacific, 
2016-2022 (millions of United States dollars). 
Source: ESCAP calculations based on fDi Markets (2023).167 
The lion’s share of FDI in climate mitigation in Asia and 
the Pacific has gone into renewable energy and other 
energy efficiency projects (Figure 9). In terms of project 
numbers, since 2016 there have been 667 projects 
related to renewable energy, 518 in energy efficiency, 
and a meager 83 on low carbon transport. 
Figure 4.9: FDI inflows into climate mitigation projects in 
Asia and the Pacific, 2016-2022 (millions of United 
States dollars). 
Source: ESCAP calculations based on fDi Markets (2023).168  
The value and volume of climate adaptation projects has 
been low in the region, and largely focused on 
introducing clean technologies to foreign operations. 
For instance, in 2021 Teijin Polyester of Japan invested 
$17.2 million and created 44 jobs in its Thai subsidiary 
to convert domestically-produced plastic bottles into 
recycled polyester chips to produce high-quality 
polyester filament. The facility is expected to produce 
7,000 tonnes of recycled polyester chips annually by 
2025. Some recent examples from 2022 include an 
investment of $27 million by Covestro (Germany) into 
China to set up a dedicated line of polycarbonate 
mechanical recycling, and another investment by 
Covestro (Germany) in Thailand to repurpose and 
convert its existing compounding plant to a recycling 
facility. Notably, no least developing countries or small 
island developing countries – arguably two sets of 
countries urgently in need of climate FDI – have 
received climate FDI since 2011.  
The low and uneven distribution of FDI to developing 
countries in the region underscores the urgent need to 
bring FDI into conversations about unlocking climate 
finance for developing countries. FDI is an important 
type of private sector investment with immense 
potential to help developing countries fill climate 
finance gaps; however, it has until now been left out of 
the discussions at forums on climate finance.

There is an urgent need to support developing countries, 
especially least developing and small island developing 
countries, and their investment promotion agencies 
responsible for attracting and facilitating climate-related 
FDI. Most importantly, these agencies need support to 
identify the climate projects that would give their 
countries a competitive advantage to attract and target 
investors; generate leads; repackage and repurpose 
brownfield investment sites into green projects; and 
pitch investment opportunities to foreign investors. 
Investment promotion agencies should consider 
incorporating tailored indicators to assess, evaluate and 
measure the climate relevant characteristics of 
investments. UN ESCAP has developed sustainable FDI 
indicators that would enable investment promotion 
agencies to do precisely this.169 On a policy advocacy 
level, they also need to build their capacity to articulate 
to relevant ministries the need for better incentives for 
climate FDI and to phase out fossil fuel subsidies and 
incentives. UN ESCAP, through its assistance and 
capacity building programme of FDI for sustainable 
development, is supporting investment promotion 
agencies in the region in each of these areas.170 More

Trends in multilateral development 
bank (MDB) and development 
financial institution (DFI) lending 
In addition to their role as investors, MDBs can play an 
even more important role in unlocking sustainable 
finance through encouraging and supporting policy 
change and mobilizing additional private finance for 
global and regional goals alongside their own 
investments. While multilateral development banks are 
considered public actors, in practice they operate in a 
fashion like other private financial institutions, following 
risk-return-mandate profiles instituted by their boards. 
However, in addition to their global, regional, and in-
country role as investors, they are uniquely placed to 
carry out investing for global public goods, and to 
mobilize private finance for this purpose while assisting 
and supporting policy changes to enable the 
achievement of goals.  
In 2021, MDBs delivered $82 billion in climate finance 
and simultaneously mobilized an additional $41 billion 
in private finance.171 The additional mobilization of 
private finance usually is arrived at through MDBs taking 
an anchor investor role in a (sometimes pioneering) 
project that then signals to other investors that the 
investment is ‘bankable’. This is not always because the 
MDB has instituted a first-loss or partial credit 
guarantee; sometimes it is simply a signal that an 
adequate amount of due diligence and vetting of the 
project and project sponsor’s financials, governance, 
and ESG risks has been passed. MDBs and bilateral DFIs 
can also support private credit institutions by investing 
equity (increasing shareholder’s funds) in the financial 
institution to allow them to expand their lending 
portfolio; and/or buying bonds issued by the financial 
institutions (usually in some sort of private placement); 
and/or extending credit.

Initiatives to support private FIs by MDBs and DFIs entail 
a cost of capital that is attractive to the FI and/or with 
terms and conditions that would be difficult to obtain 
from commercial sources. Before engaging in debt or 
equity investment, however, MDBs and DFIs will typically 
work with FI partners by providing wholesale loans 
typically on concessional terms. Increasingly these 
funding lines need to be linked to ESG standards in 
finance (Track 2, sustainably managed finance) by 
which the recipient undertakes to build a portfolio of 
lending that assesses ESG risks associated with that 
lending. Figures 4.10 and 4.11 show the development 
finance commitments to mitigation and adaptation in 
Asia and the Pacific by the top nine MDBs and DFIs in 
2020. On an aggregate level within the region defined by 
the membership of ESCAP, in Figure 4.11 below, we see 
that 64 per cent of MDB funds were committed to 
mitigation-related finance, with the rest directed to 
adaptation finance. The majority was committed by the 
World Bank Group (including equity, grants, and loans).

Development (EBRD), Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank  (AIIB), European Investment Bank (EIB), Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), 
Black Sea Trade & Development Bank (BSTDB), Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB).

Most of the investment was in debt and was not 
concessional. As seen in Figure 4.12 below, energy was 
the single biggest destination for MDB/ DFI investment 
funds in the region (followed by transport and storage). 
Over 90 per cent of the instrument used was debt, and 
only 30 per cent of the financing was concessional by 
MDBs and DFIs.

MDB and DFI finance does leverage private finance, but 
has the potential to leverage even more private finance. 
According to Figure 4.13 below and the methodology 
used by OECD, $2 billion in private finance was 
mobilized by MDBs in Asia and the Pacific in 2020. 
Estimates of how much private capital is leveraged by 
MDBs vary widely. For example, the G20’s Independent 
Review of Multilateral Development Banks’ Capital 
Adequacy Frameworks cites that in 2020 the MDBs 
covered by their review directly mobilised only 14 cents 
for every dollar of own-account investments, mostly 
through their private sector arms.177 This is still too 
small.  In 2023, the Independent Expert Group 
commissioned by the Indian G20 Presidency issued a 
report saying that MDBs only mobilise 0.6 dollars in 
private capital for each dollar they lend on their own 
account and that they should aim to at least double this 
target.178 The Independent Expert Group further states 
that they ‘envisage a doubling of concessional and non-
debt creating finance in the system as a whole, with 
priority given to support for low-income countries. 
Additional concessional finance should also support 
vulnerable countries and incentivize projects with global 
public good benefits. We further envisage a tripling of 
non-concessional official finance by 2030, compared to 
2019 pre-pandemic base year levels.179 
Figure 4.13: Total amount of mobilized private finance by MDBs across regions, 2020.

Note: The term “mobilized climate finance” measures the amounts activated in the private sector by MDBs. It covers five instruments 
(guarantees, syndicated loans, shares in collective investment vehicles, credit lines, and direct investments in companies) and is collected 
based on instrument-specific methodologies, which measure the amounts mobilized from the private sector by official development 
finance interventions. Total amount of private climate-related finance is calculated based on the OECD methodology in line with Rio 
Markers. This differs from the methodology adopted by the Joint MDB report, which relies on the data and methodology of the MDB 
Taskforce on Private Investment Mobilization for tracking the private share of climate co-finance.  The methodology of the Joint MDB 
report relies on a broader coverage of data disclosed on mobilized private climate finance; it covers more instruments and includes social 
infrastructure (hospitals, schools, etc.), which are excluded from the OECD dataset.

The call on MDBs to increase the concessionality of 
their financing and expand risk-taking has intensified 
but actual reform is still slowly emerging. While MDBs 
recognized the need to increase concessional finance 
and scale up private sector mobilization, among other 
priorities at COP27, the methods remain a source of 
much debate. The reforms under discussion at the 
World Bank Group — with forthcoming announcements 
following completed reviews and discussions at the 
Spring and Autumn 2023 meetings — may mark a 
historic moment and change in the MDB landscape. 
Such momentous change has not been seen since the 
Bretton-Woods negotiations in 1944, which led to the 
formation of the IMF and the World Bank Group (WBG). 
In this context, the development committee has asked 
the WBG Management to identify gaps in WBG’s current 
institutional and operational framework and deliver a 
work program by the end of the year, for consideration 
by the Executive Board (which oversees the routine day 
to day matters at the WBG).181  
According to the Development Committee, “This work 
program should be aimed at strengthening the WBG’s 
role and capacity to continue to be responsive to the 
evolving needs of all client countries. This should 
include designing pertinent financial reforms to 
responsibly make the most efficient use of the WBG’s 
balance sheets and generate new resources and 
contribute to strengthening coordination and 
collaboration across the broader international financial 
architecture, as well as incentivizing country demand, 
and addressing any operational obstacles to the WBG’s 
effective response.”182  
The Board of Governors additionally requested WBG 
Management to explore the recommendations of the 
Independent Review of MDB Capital Adequacy 
Frameworks (CAF),183 commissioned by the G20, to 
make the most efficient use of the Group’s balance 
sheets to increase lending capacity, while preserving 
long-term financial sustainability, robust credit ratings 
(i.e. AAA ratings), and preferred creditor status. The 
appeal for historic transformation has far-reaching 
implications for how MDBs operate on the ground; how 
operations, policy reforms and lending operations will be 
sourced, built, made bankable, and financed; and how 
private finance will be herded in.  
The reforms under discussion at the World Bank Group 
will have implications for other MDBs. The World Bank 
Group, which is the largest provider of climate finance, 
has been asked by its shareholders in the Development 
Committee, known as the Boards of Governors of the 
Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to “among 
other things, support the following: 
i) 
the development of countries’ long-term 
strategies for investing in climate action;  
ii) 
the preparation, screening, and structuring 
of reforms and projects for bankable, 
climate-resilient investments that mobilize 
private capital and foster a business 
environment aligned with low carbon and 
resilient development;  
iii) 
increased concessional and blended 
finance for adaptation and mitigation; and  
iv) 
bold investment in high-quality, 
sustainable infrastructure that enables a 
just energy transition.”184  
ADB’s newly announced Innovative Finance Facility for 
Climate in Asia and the Pacific (IF-CAP) could further 
expand climate finance in the region. ADB’s stated 
intention to be the climate bank for Asia and the Pacific 
was further cemented in 2023 with IF-CAP’s 
announcement to provide grants and guarantees for 
parts of ADB’s sovereign loan portfolio. The ADB’s 
proposed model of “$1 in, $5 out”, the initial ambition of 
$3 billion in guarantees could create up to $15 billion in 
new loans for much-needed climate projects across Asia 
and the Pacific. According to ADB, a leveraged 
guarantee mechanism for climate finance has never 
before been adopted by a multilateral development 
bank.185  
It is worth highlighting that MDBs occupy a unique 
position in the global financial architecture. Their capital 
adequacy frameworks are not subject to prudential 
supervision and governance (unlike commercial banks 
governed by the Basel Framework), but by the distinct 
makeup of each MDB’s board. MDBs also have Preferred 
Creditor Treatment (PCT), meaning that “sovereign 
borrowers will continue to repay MDBs even if they go 
into default or delay payment to other creditors. In 
addition, MDBs typically do not reschedule, restructure 
or write off sovereign loans.”186 Most uniquely to MDBs, 
and the subject of much debate, is the matter of how to 


 
ESCAP FINANCING FOR DEVELOPMENT SERIES NO. 5 
                             SUSTAINABLE FINANCE: BRIDGING THE GAP IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC 
 
 
85 
 
treat MDB’s unique callable capital. The assessment of 
capital adequacy frameworks for individual MDBs 
considers each one’s exclusive callable capital. 
Ultimately, “shareholders define MDB objectives, supply 
share capital and define the limits of risk that they are 
willing to tolerate”.187 For example, the Independent 
Expert Group of the 2023 G20 has said ‘in order to 
respond to today’s challenges, MDBs need to reframe 
their mission, raise their level of ambition and financing, 
and change the way they work internally, with each other 
and with other public and private development 
partners’.188 Importantly, they ‘recommend that the G20 
link the sustainable lending levels of the MDB system in 
2030 to the financial support needed by developing 
countries to invest to achieve these goals. This would 
establish, for the first time, a clear link between 
mandates and financing for the MDBs as a system. We 
further recommend that the G20 review the adequacy of 
such lending levels every three years in line with the 
recommendations of the report of the G20 panel on 
capital adequacy frameworks.189 It is therefore up to 
shareholders to redefine how MDBs will play their part in 
the global financial architecture.  
C. Challenges 
This section of the report addresses the challenges 
confronting Asia and the Pacific to amplify privately 
sourced finance for climate action and sustainable 
development.  
Asian banks are considerably slow in in making net zero 
commitments and need to urgently commit to credible 
net zero transition pathways. The state of net zero 
commitments by Asian banks is a code red situation. 
Asian banks are still considerably slow to pledge net 
zero commitments by 2050. When they make 2050 
commitments, it is necessary that they also outline 
credible transition pathways by setting 2030 targets (as 
is required for example by the industry-led, UN 
convened, Net Zero Banking alliance which forms the 
industry partnership for banks party to the Glasgow 
Financial Alliance to Net Zero). Without setting the 
appropriate 2030 targets, 2050 targets will not be 
met.190 More than 90 per cent of the 500 largest banks 
in Asia (with a combined $71.8 trillion in total assets, 
$37.4 trillion in net loans, $49.7 trillion in customer 
deposits, and $425 billion in net profit in 2021)191 have 
not yet made credible net zero commitments by 2050 
with intermediate targets by 2030. Under such 
circumstances, change is unlikely to happen fast 
enough. It is possible for financing towards net zero to 
happen in the absence of a net zero commitment; but as 
discussed earlier, the picture emerging from Asia and 
the Pacific is that coal financing is on the rise, 
emissions are on the rise, and net-zero action is 
insufficiently financed.  
This also means a significant lack of local currency 
financing for the net zero transition. The lack of net zero 
commitments from Asia-Pacific also translates into a 
lack of local currency financing for the net zero 
transition. This is further corroborated anecdotally by 
international banks and investors, who bemoan the 
significant dearth of local banks investing in the energy 
transition, the managed phase out of coal, and in new 
green technologies in the region. The lack of mandatory 
regulation to shift banks towards concrete 
commitments, despite national commitments to the 
Paris Agreement, may be an additional reason why 
Asian banks are slow. Importantly, local banks bring 
investment in local currency, removing the need for the 
hurdle rate for investments to compensate for the 
exchange rate risk. Without the credible participation of 
Asian banks in the transition to net zero, adequate 
finance cannot be mobilized to meet the 1.5C goal. To 
the extent that finance can drive action and incentives 
for the real economy to transition, the lack of progress 
by Asian banks also acts as a brake on the transition of 
the real economy.  
Asia’s growing energy demand requires significant 
private finance, but challenges abound in financing the 
just energy transition. Coal power generation is the 
largest source of carbon dioxide emissions globally. 
According to the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net 
Zero, if existing coal power assets continue to operate 
as planned, they alone will generate enough emissions 
to exhaust two-thirds of the remaining carbon budget 
associated with limiting warming to 1.5C. The 
International Energy Agency predicts that more than 70 
per cent of growth in global electricity demand will come 
from Southeast Asia, India, and China over the next 
three years.192 In addition, the average age of coal fired

                             SUSTAINABLE FINANCE: BRIDGING THE GAP IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC 
 
 
86 
 
power plants in these regions is about 15 years, 
compared to average ages in Europe and America of 
more than 30 years.193 This means it will be more 
expensive to phase out coal, and it is estimated that 
there are about 5,000 coal fired power plants operating 
in Asia and the Pacific.194 Financing is thus required to 
acquire coal assets for early phaseout. While most net-
zero committed banks have a no-coal financing policy 
(or at least a no-new-coal financing policy), what is 
essential for the managed phase out of coal in an 
orderly and just manner is to invest in the phaseout of 
coal. This will mean investing in new coal in the short 
term, and seeing emissions rise in the financing 
portfolio in the short term. ADB’s energy transition 
mechanism, as well as the Just Energy Transition 
Partnerships, also further support the early retirement of 
coal in the region. At a side event to the ECOSOC Forum 
on Financing for Development organized by ESCAP in 
2023, it was further noted that the cost of early 
retirement of coal-based power plants varies across 
plants and depends on when they will be retired. The 
case of a specific power plant in Asia-Pacific was 
mentioned which would cost $625 million to retire in 
2025, $314 million to retire in 2030, and $127 million to 
retire in 2035 as an example of varying and sizeable 
decommissioning costs. Various options to finance this 
decommissioning were discussed including policy 
changes and innovative financing mechanisms, 
including carbon credits and accelerating investments in 
renewables as well as options to transition of the plants 
into renewables, such as wind or solar or hydrogen. 
Such an approach, if it could maintain the revenues of 
the power plant and its levels of employment, would 
also minimize social disruption. 
The costs of investing in renewable energy have 
significantly declined and global investment in 
renewable energy has soared in 2022 to a record high of 
$495 billion globally. However, this still represents less 
than one-third of the average investment needed each 
year between 2023 and 2030, according to the 1.5°C 
scenario predicted by the International Renewable 
Energy Agency (IRENA). Investments are also not on 
track to achieve the goals set by the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development.195 Renewable power 
investment has risen rapidly in Asia-Pacific countries to 
more than $335 billion in 2022, and accounts for around 
55 per cent of the global total. Still, except for China and 
India, the region comprises less than 20 per cent of 
global investment. 
Private finance is the major source of funding for 
financing clean energy investment and long-term debt is 
the preferred instrument, but bankability issues persist. 
Between 2013 and 2020, private sources accounted for 
75 per cent of global renewable energy investment, 
though some technologies with long lead times, such as 
hydropower and geothermal, relied more on capital from 
state-owned enterprises and public financial 
institutions. Financing has shifted towards balance 
sheet structures, at more than 60 per cent in 2020, 
though project finance transactions remain prevalent. 
While utility-scale renewable power investments are 
often highly leveraged, debt has played a greater role in 
onshore wind than solar photovoltaics (PV). Bankability 
issues often arise from insufficient pricing and 
remuneration frameworks; lack of standardization 
around common contingency, risk mitigation, dispute 
resolution and other contractual clauses; and perceived 
cash flow risks. Availability of grid infrastructure and 
land as well as equity shortfalls for early-stage project 
development remain persistent barriers in many 
markets.  
Large-scale private financing is also required for new 
green technologies such as green hydrogen to be 
deployed in hard-to-abate sectors.196 Green hydrogen is 
produced by electrolysis, which is essentially the 
process of splitting water molecules into hydrogen and 
oxygen, by passing electricity through water. If the 
electricity for electrolysis is generated through 
renewable energy sources, the production process does 
not result in a carbon by-product, and it is therefore an 
ideal (clean) form of hydrogen production from an 
emissions reduction perspective.197 The continuing drop 
in the cost of green hydrogen technologies and the 
volatility of fossil fuel prices therefore makes green 
hydrogen an attractive solution for energy security and 
storage capacity,198 but large upfront financing 
requirements, and challenges in the enabling policy and 
regulatory frameworks still need to be overcome. 
Globally, governments have committed more than $37 
billion in public funding to hydrogen development, while 
the private sector has announced investments of around 
$300 billion. Nearly 40 per cent of the global demand for 
hydrogen is generated from the Asia-Pacific region and,

87 
 
within Asia and the Pacific most of the demand comes 
from China, which accounts for 26 per cent of global 
demand. Global competition to win business for the 
green hydrogen sector is increasing in an environment 
of high interest rates. The massive subsidies offered to 
green hydrogen under the US Inflation Reduction Act and 
the EU’s contracts for difference scheme via its new 
Hydrogen Bank seek to attract domestic green hydrogen 
investment. However, it is unlikely that emerging 
markets and developing economies have either the cash 
to match these subsidies nor the credit ratings to 
borrow competitively. 
For both new renewable energy project investments and 
new green technologies, particularly in more challenging 
markets in Asia and the Pacific, building bankable 
pipelines is fraught with challenges.  While there are 
substantially large pools of debt and equity available 
regionwide in local currencies, there is a discrepancy 
between available capital, ready projects, and the 
execution of transactions. The absence of standardized 
transaction templates to easily replicate requirements, 
risk contingency clauses, and dispute resolution 
mechanisms, remains a challenge. In addition, poor 
connectivity between investors and projects leads to 
poor visibility about what bankability means to different 
investors. Therefore, it is likely that misunderstandings 
about how to structure projects and engage with 
multiple investors arise. High transaction costs for 
adding guarantees, first-loss-tranches, and the blend of 
concessional capital with commercial capital also 
prohibit the rapid scale and replicability of projects. 
Projects thus tend to be executed on a deal-by-deal 
basis, with most deals taking anywhere between one 
and two years to execute.  
Private finance, whether local investors in local currency 
or international investors in hard currency, need to 
spend more effort in assessing and pricing risk 
appropriately. Too often perceptions drive risk pricing in 
countries where benchmarks on risk-return-mandates do 
not exist. Investors without boots-on-the-ground and the 
ability to conduct sustained due diligence prefer not to 
engage with new countries where they have never done 
a transaction before. This exacerbates the problem of 
capital not flowing to where it is most needed (and 
where in fact returns could be made). Large, capital 
expenditure heavy projects with upfront payments and 
returns spread over a long tail require long-term 
financing solutions, preferably in local currency. But if 
Asia-Pacific investors do not engage with trying to 
understand how to finance new sectors and projects 
without existing benchmarks and locally tailored lending 
methodologies, there will continue to be a significant 
bottleneck in financing.  
Small-ticket projects are increasingly overlooked in the 
urgent search for scale, but they also need to be 
nurtured. For a full pipeline of energy transition projects 
to materialize at large scale and high pace, underlying 
pipelines of smaller energy transition projects at smaller 
ticket sizes are often required. This is typical for 
investments in general – angel investment offers a 
proving ground for companies with strong ideas or 
concepts. As their concepts reach the early stages of 
becoming proven, companies can raise larger ticket 
Series A and B venture capital. Upon proving themselves 
more and growing even further, larger-ticket private 
equity funds invest based on the belief that they can 
grow these companies all the way to an initial public 
offering and listing on a stock exchange where retail 
investors can buy a share. Similar principles apply here.  
Insufficient project preparation funds exist to ensure 
projects meet the risk-return-mandate requirements of 
different investors. Project preparation significantly 
lessens the risks inherent to projects, particularly when 
done in partnership with investors. Proper feasibility 
studies conducted in line with a model of a transaction 
template (which outlines what risks investors are willing 
to take and what contingencies they may need) will 
significantly lower the risks in projects. Third party 
verification of such studies, as well as support to 
investors (particularly local investors who may not have 
experience in such investments) through technical 
assistance in the sector or project also constitutes a 
strong part of effective project preparation. In the 
region, small ticket-size projects by businesses face 
high transaction costs to get off the ground. In some 
cases, they are simply not eligible for large grant 
facilities like the Green Climate Fund or the Global 
Environment Facility. Neither are they eligible for the 
technical assistance grants delivered by multilateral 
development banks which are mostly given alongside a 
specific prospective investment by the MDB. In some 
cases, even when they are eligible for these large

88 
 
facilities, applications require significant skills which 
they lack. More inclusive and wide-reaching project 
preparation funds, while requiring more funds and 
possibly generating some failures in terms of 
investment, may on a net basis however generate 
significantly more bankable projects.  
Since financing ultimately drives investment by the real 
economy, two‑thirds of the largest listed businesses still 
lack a net zero pledge.199 Only 8 per cent of companies 
in Asia and the Pacific have set a net zero goal by 2021, 
according to CDP, a climate disclosure nonprofit.200 Of 
the one third of largest listed businesses that have 
made a net zero pledge, only a portion have committed 
to an independent voluntary initiative. Most 
privately‑listed businesses and state‑owned enterprises 
have no net zero target at all.201 Even with 2050 net zero 
commitments, the challenge is that emissions need to 
peak (in two years’ time) by 2025 globally, and 
emissions need to be cut by nearly half by 2030,202 in 
order to limit the temperature rise to 1.5C.203 Therefore 
companies that have set a 2050 net zero goal need to 
still commit to credible transition pathways with 2030 
goals and other interim goals.  
The absence of data that would enable transaction 
benchmarks to be built remains a major challenge, 
including in biodiversity finance. Investor-grade data on 
risks, dependencies, and impact on science-based 
targets, is needed. This would allow pricing benchmarks, 
as well as other reference points for appropriate 
covenants, impact standards, and outcomes to be 
placed. For biodiversity finance, complex biodiversity 
measurements — such as revenue related to carbon, 
biodiversity net gain, and other new indicators for 
traditional investors — create a challenge for 
investment.   
D. Recommendations 
In this section, we outline the key recommendations for 
private finance emerging from the discussion on trends, 
opportunities, and challenges. In addition, these 
recommendations (which are set out in detail here) have 
been aggregated into our final set of ten principles of 
action for the region to bridge the sustainable finance 
gap in Asia and the Pacific, set forward in the final 
chapter.  
Instead of being on track to reduce emissions by 45 per 
cent by 2030, emissions are set to increase by close to 
11 per cent.204 Instead of delaying the efforts to 
transition closer to 2050 or 2060, making the costs to 
transition even greater, private finance needs to act now 
to proactively plan for the transition to net zero. If 
private finance adopts an active role and becomes the 
vanguard of change, actions will cascade down to 
businesses, corporates, and households who use private 
finance for their activities, thereby spurring widespread 
change in the timeframe needed. The groundbreaking 
report by the High Level Expert Group on the Net Zero 
Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities, tasked 
by the United Nations Secretary General and chaired by 
the Honourable Catherine McKenna, put forth a series of 
recommendations on net zero pledges for actors 
including private finance. We refer to the following 
relevant recommendations on credible transition 
pathways for such actors including private finance 
below:205  
▪ A net zero pledge must contain stepping-stone 
targets for every five years and set out concrete 
ways to reach net zero in line with the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or 
International Energy Agency net zero greenhouse 
gas emissions modelled pathways that limit 
warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot. 
Implementation needs to begin immediately, and 
not delay action to the last minute, reflecting the 
fact that global emissions must decline by at least 
50 per cent by 2030. The plans must disclose how 
capital expenditure plans, research and 
development plans, and investments are aligned 
with all targets (e.g. capital expenditure‑alignment 
with a regional or national taxonomy) and split 
between new and legacy or stranded assets. Net 
zero plans must detail the third‑party verification 
approach and ensure audited accuracy. 
▪ On coal for power generation, net zero targets and 
transition plans of all financial institutions must 
include an immediate end of: (i) lending, (ii) 
underwriting, and (iii) investments in any company 
planning new coal infrastructure, power plants, and 
mines.

▪ Private finance should focus on renewable energy: 
Financial institutions should create investment 
products aligned with net zero emissions by 2050 
and facilitate increased investment in renewable 
energy. 
▪ Private finance should also focus on financing 
biodiversity: Businesses should invest in the 
protection and restoration of ecosystems beyond 
the emission reductions in their own operations 
and supply chains to achieve global net zero. This 
is important considering the systemic financial 
risks associated with the loss of biodiversity and 
the exacerbated climate impacts associated with 
the loss of natural carbon sinks. Businesses, 
especially financial institutions, should anticipate 
the final guidance of the Taskforce on 
Nature‑related Financial Disclosures by factoring 
in nature risks and dependency to all elements of 
their net zero transition plans. 
Private finance, including MDBs and DFIs, need to 
engage in partnerships now, not just transactions. 
Solving the highly complex problem of financing climate 
action at scale and pace requires moving beyond short-
term, transaction-oriented thinking and deploy strategic 
thinking about how to generate many deals within a 
country in the relevant sectors. This requires private 
finance to partner with policymakers and regulators and 
drive new climate finance partnerships. It also requires 
investors with experience in financing the net zero 
transition to build the capacity of regulators and 
investors in-country who may not have such experience. 
The Just Energy Transition Partnerships present one 
model of ambitious partnerships. The caveat is that time 
is of the essence and partnerships need to be built and 
executed urgently.  
Multilateral banks and development finance institutions 
need to rethink their approaches to concessional 
lending and their abilities to take on more risk. In doing 
so, they will have to work closely with financial 
institutions and businesses to build projects that are 
well-structured, leverage more private financing than 
before (thus ensuring shared returns to all investors, not 
just one), mitigate risk through good preparation, design, 
and execution, and genuinely require concessional or 
grant tranches. These projects should also be aligned 
with countries’ national and sectoral transition pathways 
and MDBs and DFIs are a powerful partner in 
conversations with countries on developing such 
credible transition pathways. 
Project pipeline building requires significantly reformed 
approaches if scale is to be achieved. The classic model 
of investors either building their own pipelines 
confidentially or waiting for fully packaged bankable 
projects to be referred to them will no longer work in 
certain sectors relevant to the transition, such as often 
in energy transition or in new technologies. The scale of 
investment required, and the tight timeframe in which to 
achieve such a scale, is too high and requires significant 
pre-investment partnerships. Foreign investors and local 
investors need to work together in the early stages of 
project building, and to collaborate to blend local and 
hard currency as well as grants and concessional 
finance from multiple sources. While this report has 
focused on concessional finance from MDBs and DFIs, 
we note that there is also substantial concessional and 
grant finance available from foundations. The newly 
announced Energy Transition Accelerator by Rockefeller 
Foundation and the Bezos Foundation206 aim to bring 
substantial philanthropic capital to incentivize new 
private-sector climate finance for mitigation and 
adaptation that augments — not substitutes for — other 
sources of public, private, multilateral, and philanthropic 
finance and companies’ continued investments in deep 
emissions reductions within their own value chains.  
Finally, to ensure that project preparation funds are 
optimally employed to ensure the creation of genuinely 
investment-ready projects, investors should advise 
project preparation fund implementation, even if in a 
light-touch manner. This will avoid the unfortunate, but 
common, occurrence of existing project pipelines for 
investment which fail to receive financing as a range of 
investors do not consider them investment-ready and 
investors have not been engaged from the inception of 
project development. By setting up a modality in which 
project developer and financial institutions regularly 
meet and co-create investment projects in a progressive 
and iterative manner, supported by grant funds that 
defray high-risks surrounding the project preparation, 
higher-quality projects can be built.   
Private finance also needs to invest in building the 
capacity of staff and systems. For banks and investors 
who are yet to make a net-zero pledge and transition

                             SUSTAINABLE FINANCE: BRIDGING THE GAP IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC 
 
 
90 
 
their lending and investing operations, significant 
investment in staff capacity and systems is required to 
design, plan, and manage this transition urgently. 
Investments by private finance are thus urgently 
required. Private finance institutions can join peer-to-
peer learning networks. There are also international 
principles that individual financial institutions of any 
jurisdiction can apply to. The best known are those 
developed by UNEP-FI encompassing the Principles of 
Responsible Banking, the Principles of Responsible 
Investment, and the Principles of Sustainable Insurance. 
These self-organized peer-to-peer learning networks are 
vital to share knowledge and raise standards. 
Private finance should also encourage their real 
economy borrowers and clients to implement the net 
zero transition. Finance and the real economy are 
intertwined, and neither can afford to lag behind the 
other. Encouraging industry borrowers who seek finance 
to adopt voluntary net zero standards relevant to their 
sector, will help private finance. For many countries, 
sectoral transition pathways will be needed, and these 
will differ from other countries due to different starting 
points and different goals. Finance and the real 
economy businesses need to participate in those 
sectoral transition pathways; both in design and in 
implementation.  
Conclusion 
Private finance actors must redefine how they engage 
with net zero, committing to net zero targets, as well as 
a credible transition pathway, and driving action within 
the real economy to the maximum possible extent. To 
fulfill net zero targets and finance action, project 
pipeline building must also be redefined to include 
greater collaboration between a multitude of actors. 
Commercial investors and development financial 
institutions, such as MDBs and businesses/project 
developers, need to work hand-in-hand with green 
project developers at the pre-investment stage. Instead 
of operating on a per deal basis, common approaches to 
templating transactions can be adopted, creating a 
replicable model for transactions in the net-zero arena, 
and ensuring investments take place at scale and pace. 
In Asia and the Pacific, local banks and investors need 
to take their place at the forefront of investing in the net-
zero transition.

5. TEN PRINCIPLES OF 
ACTION TO BRIDGE 
THE SUSTAINABLE 
FINANCE GAP IN ASIA 
AND THE PACIFIC 
Climate change has been called “a wicked problem par 
excellence”207 because it constitutes of a series of 
interconnected problems that cannot be solved in 
isolation. Financing climate action in time is thus also a 
wicked problem par excellence. It requires policymakers 
to collaborate with regulators and private finance to 
drive action in the real economy. It calls for urgent 
implementation, in a world in which we have already 
experienced a 1.1C change, and in which if we continue 
as normal, the carbon budget to stay within 1.5C will be 
depleted in less than six years, according to the IPCC. It 
has been said that the global battle for climate change 
will be won or lost in Asia and the Pacific.208 If the Asia-
Pacific region is at the core of the problem, however, it 
is also at the core of the solution.  
In the previous chapters, we discussed at length the 
trends, opportunities, challenges, and recommendations 
for policymakers, regulators, and private finance related 
to how sustainable finance can bridge the gap in the 
region. Based on that analysis, we aggregate the 
recommendations across the three actors into the 
following ten-point principles of action, which we hope 
constitutes an action plan for stakeholders in the region.  
Governments and regulators 
1. New climate finance partnerships are developed 
through which governments, regulators, MDBs, 
and private finance commit to action around 
specific goals and contribute specific tasks in 
line with this shared goal. Just Energy 
Transition Partnerships, which are led and 
owned by countries, provide a useful model for 
the region, especially if execution can be 
accelerated.   
2. Effective NDC financing strategies are 
developed, led by authorities with clear 
mandates, which signal credible transition 
pathways with interim targets and clear 
resource mobilization plans. This will provide a 
clear and vital signal to investors, businesses, 
and project developers that governments are 
committed to change. This signal of reliability, 
stability, and predictability is a core part of 
costs around projects.   
3. Policy coherence and capacities are developed 
across key government ministries such as 
finance, energy, transport, and environment, 
reducing the costs of financing. Governments 
need to invest in both the effort for such 
coordination and the capacities for such 
coordination. This will also allow governments 
to better work with MDBs, DFIs, and 
development partners to obtain the assistance 
they need in the timeframe they need it in.   
4. Decisive regulatory action takes place to shift 
capital in Asia and the Pacific towards the net 
zero transition. Asia and the Pacific is home to 
significantly large pools of capital capable of 
bridging the gap in sustainable finance. 
Regulators need to adopt a more active role in 
shifting capital towards climate action, 
recognizing that doing so will strengthen 
financial stability in the system, as well as 
create a level playing field for all. In doing so, 
regulators will also need to move towards 
consistent taxonomies and roadmaps across 
countries, to create a level playing field.   
5. Investment in the capacities of financial 
personnel to assess climate risk, innovate green 
financial instruments, and supervise the 
transition path of the green economy is 
undertaken. International groupings such as the 
Network for Central Banks and Supervisors for 
Greening the Financial System (NGFS) or the 
Sustainable Banking and Finance Network 
(SBFN) can be effective to promote peer-
learning among members.  
6. Investment in much-needed sectoral and 
project-based financial data is undertaken. 
Common data platforms that share valuable

data on ESG, climate, nature, contracts, clauses 
standards, targets, and deals (where possible) 
will streamline investment, assist 
benchmarking, strengthen credibility and ensure 
replicability and scale of green transactions and 
deals.  
Private Finance – Asia-Pacific banks, investors and 
issuers  
7. Commitments to net zero pledges for 2050 with 
credible transition pathways including 2030 
goals are made. The slowness of banks in Asia 
and the Pacific to commit to net zero and 
transition their lending and investing portfolios 
with interim 2030 science-based targets is a 
serious brake on driving finance towards 
climate action in the region.   
8. Local-currency financing of energy transition 
projects as well as green technologies and other 
net-zero investments is increased. Local-
currency financing is critical to accelerate the 
scale and pace of private finance because it can 
fund projects that do not have to reach a higher 
rate of return just to cover exchange rate risk as 
well as provide other benefits. Increased net-
zero commitments by private finance in Asia 
and the Pacific (number 7 above) combined with 
a focus on investing in the energy transition in 
their local currency will leverage and bring 
forward the needed investment at scale.    
9. Concessional financing and risk-sharing by 
multilateral development banks, bilateral 
development financial institutions, and public 
development banks is expanded and 
accelerated. This will de-risk otherwise sound 
projects and ultimately leverage significant 
private capital. A 1:5 ratio, like ADB’s goal, can 
be one benchmark to ensure that concessional 
funds truly leverage private finance and go 
towards well-structured projects. This will also 
guarantee well-designed projects in which 
concessional finance truly catalyzes and 
mobilizes greater private finance. In doing so, 
however, it is critical to ensure the project is 
both high impact to support the net-zero-
transition and commercially attractive.   
10. Investment of time and effort with partners in 
green project preparation is increased in more 
challenging markets, whether it is in the LDCs, 
SIDS, or in new green technologies. Setting up a 
modality in which project developers and 
financial institutions regularly meet and co-
create investment projects in a progressive and 
iterative manner can accelerate the preparation 
of effective pipelines of bankable green projects 
at scale. While large projects have lower 
transaction costs, investing in project 
preparation for smaller-ticket green projects will 
ensure a long-term pipeline of large projects. 
Ultimately good project preparation and 
dedicated resources to that end will reduce the 
risk of projects when implemented.

42 There is no one uniform definition of greenwashing. 
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) 
have sought industry views on legally defining 
greenwashing to be enshrined in law. A commonly 
referred to analysis is regarding the seven sins of 
greenwashing by TerraChoice (2010), The Cambridge 
dictionary defines greenwashing as the practice of 
making people believe that your company is doing more 
to protect the environment than it really is.

51 SDG Goal No. 7 is to ensure access to affordable, 
reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. It has 
five targets to be achieved by 2030, three of which are 
outcome targets (universal access to modern energy, 
increase global percentage of renewable energy, double 
the improvement in energy efficiency) and two of which 
are means of implementation targets (to promote 
access to research, technology, and investments in 
clean energy and to expand and upgrade energy 
services for developing countries).  
52 Indicator 7.1. 2 is the proportion of population with 
primary reliance on clean fuels and technology, while 
indicator 7.2.1 measures renewable energy share in the 
total final energy consumption and indicator 7.a.1 
measures international financial flows to developing 
countries in support of clean energy research and 
development and renewable energy production 
(including in hybrid systems). 
53 An exception is the SDG bonds, which are instruments 
that clearly link the use of proceeds to the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through 
a multiplicity of methods.

77 Carbon pricing initiatives have been classified as 
ETSs and carbon taxes according to how they operate 
technically; local terminology may vary. Jurisdictions 
that only mention carbon pricing in their NDCs are not 
included. 
78 Systems operating like a baseline-and-offsets 
program, such as Australia Safeguard Mechanism, fall 
outside the scope of the Carbon Pricing Dashboard. 
79 World Bank (2023). 
80 The High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices 
concluded in 2017 that carbon prices needed to be at 
the level of $40/metric tons of carbon dioxide (tCO2) to 
$80/tCO2 in 2020 and reach $50/tCO2 to $100/tCO2 by 
2030 to be on track to keep temperatures below 2°C—
the upper end of the limit agreed upon in the Paris 
Agreement (2017 USD). Adjusting for inflation allows a 
more direct comparison with current carbon prices—
prices would need to reach $61 to $122 by 2030 (in 
2023 USD).

90 Mezzanine financing is a layer of financing that fills 
the gap between senior debt and equity in a company. It 
can be structured either as preferred stock or as 
unsecured debt, and it provides investors with an option 
to convert to equity interest. Mezzanine financing is 
usually used to fund growth prospects, such as 
acquisitions and expansion of the business. (Corporate 
Finance Institute, 2023)

104 For example, according to the Commonwealth 
Climate and Law Initiative (CCLI) and Climate 
Governance Initiative (CGI) (2021), “Climate-related 
disclosure standards have significant consequences for 
boards. Directors have obligations to approve or attest 
to the accuracy and completeness of disclosures made 
in financial filings. Directors on audit committees will 
likewise have additional responsibilities to engage in 
testing and overseeing the robustness of the climate 
scenario assumptions underpinning key aspects of the 
audit process.”  
105 Macroprudential policies are financial policies that 
aim to ensure the stability of the financial system as a 
whole in order to prevent substantial disruptions in 
credit and other vital financial services necessary for 
stable economic growth. The stability of the financial 
system is at greater risk when financial vulnerabilities 
are high, such as when institutions and investors have 
high leverage and are overly reliant on uninsured short-
term funding, and interconnections are complex and 
opaque. High vulnerabilities increase the likelihood that 
a firm’s failure or other negative shock will cause 
distress at other financial institutions because of direct 
exposures and through fire sales, contagion, or other 
negative externalities arising from the initial shock. 
Macroprudential policies aim to reduce the financial 
system’s sensitivity to shocks by limiting the buildup of 
financial vulnerabilities (Yilla and Liang, 2020). 
106 Microprudential supervision refers to the supervisory 
role performed by central banks to monitor financial 
institutions to ensure the stability and soundness of 
practices by individual banks.  
107 BOE (2019). 
108 Carney (2015). 
109 Ibid. 
110 Green swans, or “climate black swans”, present many 
features of typical black swans. Climate-related risks 
typically fit fat-tailed distributions: both physical and 
transition risks are characterized by deep uncertainty 
and nonlinearity, their chances of occurrence are not 
reflected in past data, and the possibility of extreme 
values cannot be ruled out. In this context, traditional 
approaches to risk management consisting of 
extrapolating historical data and on assumptions of 
normal distributions are largely irrelevant to assess 
future climate related risks (Bolton, and others, 2020). 
111 The bank-sovereign nexus refers to the fact that 
many banks hold domestic sovereign debt, especially in 
emerging economies, which can amplify 
macroprudential risk. IMF research shows that an 
increase in sovereign credit risk can adversely affect 
banks’ balance sheets and credit supply especially in 
countries with less well-capitalized banking systems. 
Sovereign distress can also impact banks indirectly 
through the nonfinancial corporate sector by 
constraining their funding and reducing their capital 
expenditure. Notably, the effects on banks and 
corporates are strongly nonlinear in the size of the 
sovereign distress (Deghi, and others, 2022).

117 The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard 
classifies a company’s GHG emissions into three 
scopes. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from 
owned or controlled sources. These are usually the 
easiest to measure. Scope 2 emissions refer to the 
indirect emissions from the generation of purchased 
energy. Scope 3 emissions refer to all indirect 
emissions (not included in Scope 2) that occur in the 
value chain of the reporting company, including both

126 GFANZ defines a net-zero transition plan as follows: 
A net-zero transition plan is a set of goals, actions, and 
accountability mechanisms to align an organization’s 
business activities with a pathway to net-zero GHG 
emissions that delivers real-economy emissions 
reduction in line with achieving global net zero. For 
GFANZ members, a transition plan should be consistent 
with achieving net zero by 2050, at the latest, in line with 
commitments and global efforts to limit warming to 
1.5C, above pre-industrial levels, with low or no 
overshoot. Financial institutions’ net-zero commitments 
should cover at least the Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions associated with clients or portfolio 
companies. They should also cover Scope 3 emissions 
associated with clients or portfolio companies in 
sectors that are significant climate change contributors 
or where company Scope 3 emissions are material and 
can be incorporated based on data availability (GFANZ, 
2022).

149 In May 2021, the Court of the Hague delivered a 
landmark decision, ordering Shell to reduce its global 
CO2 emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 (Milieudefensie v 
Shell plc). Similar claims were filed in Germany in 2021 
against the car manufacturers BMW, Mercedes Benz, 
and Volkswagen. In the US, ExxonMobil, its chairman, 
CEO, and other directors have been subject to several 
securities and financial regulation claims, relating to 
alleged failures to disclose climate risks properly 
(Ramirez v ExxonMobil) (Page and Butland, 2022).  
In February 2023, activist group ClientEarth sought to 
bring a derivative action against Shell's directors for 
their alleged failure to effectively address the risks of 
climate change. The case was ground-breaking as the 
first-ever climate litigation attempting derivative action 
to establish personal liability for a company's directors 
who allegedly failed to address the threat of climate 
change. While the High Court dismissed this case in 
May 2023, it nevertheless accepted that ClientEarth had 
established a prima facie case. "Shell faces material 
and foreseeable risks as a result of climate change 
which have or could have a material effect on it." 
According to legal firm Dentons (2023), ‘this finding will 
not be lost on others seeking to bring ESG claims.”  
150 Most banking regulators follow the 
recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision, which defines capital adequacy ratios using 
risk-weighted assets in the denominator. With riskier 
assets having a larger weight, they require larger 
increases in capital reserves compared to less risky 
assets. 
151 The capital stack of a project or entity refers to the 
mix of various forms of capital in the capital structure, 
that is ordered by who has the rights and in what order 
the capital owner gets paid in terms of both profits and 
income as well as in event of default. Common capital 
forms include senior debt (usually the first to get paid 
out such as collateral-backed loans, commercial bank 
loans), junior debt (a form of second-tier subordinated 
debt such as mezzanine debt) and common equity. 
Concessional funding can thus be blended with private 
commercial finance and used at different levels of the 
capital stack.

190 As Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary 
Authority of Singapore said, “2020 to 2030 is the critical 
decade for climate action. Net zero commitments for 
2050 are fine and good but a credible trajectory towards 
that goal will be substantially determined by 2030. While 
a growing number of countries and companies have set 
net-zero targets, very few have credible plans to meet 
them. The problem is that countries and companies 
alike are pledging to hit targets in almost three decades' 
time without committing to action for which they can be 
held accountable in the short term. To achieve net-zero 
by 2050, the necessary policies and the associated 
investments must be made between now and 2030,” 
(Menon, 2022).

196 Hard to Abate (HTA) sectors are sectors in which it is 
difficult to move away from fossil fuel energy uses and 
in which it is hard to directly electrify using renewable 
power. These include major industries that rely on fossil 
fuels for high-temperature energy or for chemical 
feedstocks and include steel, cement, iron, chemicals 
and building materials which together are responsible 
for approximately 30 per cent of the world’s annual CO2 
emissions. Another HTA sector is heavy duty 
transportation, such as trucking and shipping, which is 
harder to electrify than passenger transport because it 
would require enormous batteries that add to vehicle 
weight and take a long time to charge. (Nault, 2022).

203 The IPCC report (IPCC, 2022a) additionally states 
“tracked financial flows fall short of the levels needed to 
achieve mitigation goals across all sectors and regions. 
The challenge of closing gaps is largest in developing 
countries as a whole. Scaling up mitigation financial 
flows can be supported by clear policy choices and 
signals from governments and the international 
community (high confidence). Accelerated international 
financial cooperation is a critical enabler of low-GHG 
and just transitions and can address inequities in 
access to finance and the costs of, and vulnerability to, 
the impacts of climate change (high confidence). {15.2,
