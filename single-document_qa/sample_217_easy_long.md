# Question

In this article, what practical factors did the author consider when designing the collaborative fusion perception algorithm?

# Choices

- A: Different types of roadside facilities and vehicle facilities lead to different data transmission frequencies, different heights and angles between different facilities (different vehicles, vehicles and road facilities), spatial measurement errors and communication time delays, etc.
- B: Different installation heights and angles between vehicle facilities, positioning noise in the algorithm, and. Asynchronous sensor measurements may introduce delayed sensor information, and different devices send different frequencies
- C: Different installation heights and angles between vehicles and facilities, positioning noise, and asynchronous sensor measurements may introduce delayed sensor information, different transmission frequencies between different devices, and loss of information during communication
- D: The different types of roadside facilities and vehicle facilities lead to data delays, different installation heights and angles between different facilities, spatial measurement errors and positioning errors caused by communications, etc.

# Answer

A
