EDITOR'S INTRODUCTIO N
i. Th e Texts  an d their  Philosophy
Berkeley i s generally regarded a s the invento r of subjective
idealism; that is , of the theor y tha t th e physica l world exists
only in the experiences minds have of it. This is one version of
the doctrine tha t reality  i s wholly mental: the other version is
pan-psychism (whic h is from the Greek, meaning 'everything-
mind-ism'). Pan-psychism holds that there are minds in every-
thing. S o th e kitche n tabl e ha s a  mind , o r i s compose d o f
minds, or i s run throug h wit h the presenc e o f mind i n som e
other way. Pan-psychism accepts the autonomous existence of
objects outside creatures that we normally think of as possess-
ing minds, but says that these other things, contrary to general
belief, also have consciousness in them, in some way or other.
Amongst majo r philosophers , Leibni z and , perhaps, Spinoz a
are pan-psychists . Berkeley's idealis m restrict s min d t o th e
usual list of humans, God, animals, and whatever other spirits
there ma y commonly be thought t o be, and says that every-
thing else—th e intrinsicall y non-mental—exist s onl y a s
features of the experienc e o f these minds.
This seem s t o be a very bizarre view , but, as we shall see ,
it arise s naturall y ou t o f th e philosoph y an d scienc e o f th e
seventeenth century . Tha t scienc e wa s articulate d philo -
sophically b y Joh n Lock e i n hi s Essay  Concerning  Human
Understanding. Becaus e i t articulated the ne w knowledge in
a fairl y discursiv e style , i t foun d a  read y audience . Bu t
Berkeley, unlike Locke, was not a discursive thinker; he dealt
in cris p an d purportedl y decisiv e abstrac t arguments . Thi s
meant that, in his first exposition of idealism in the Principles,
his shocking doctrine was stated rather too nakedly and with-
out th e scene-settin g tha t migh t hav e mad e i t acceptable .
Consequently, i t was simply dismissed a s eccentric. Th e Dia-
logues are his attempt t o present hi s doctrine i n a more per -
suasive way . In th e Dialogues,  therefore, h e personifie s th e
debate that leads from the fashionable scientific philosophy of


x Introduction
Locke to his own idealism in two characters. One, Hylas (th e
name is derived from the Greek for matter) defends the scien-
tific view of the materia l world as existing independently of
the mind ; th e other , Philonous  (fro m th e Gree k lover  o f
mind) defend s idealism. Th e Dialogues  ar e masterpiece s of
both literatur e an d philosophy. The styl e is almost perfectly
lucid and the debate proceeds wit h something as close to the
dynamic of a real argumen t between intelligen t an d sympa-
thetic interlocutors as one could hope t o capture in the writ-
ten word. There are few long speeches and the dialogue has a
natural to-and-fr o quality. Hylas' thought s follow a  natural
development and , i n the cours e o f the dialogues , he make s
every objectio n tha t migh t reasonabl y hav e occurre d t o
an opponen t o f Berkeley's . I n short , Hyla s i s a s fa r fro m
the tedious sycophants who constitute Socrates' opponents in
most o f Plato's dialogue s a s one coul d hop e t o get . This is
because in Plato's dialogues the discussion is usually between
master and student: Hylas and Philonous are, in all except the
outcome o f the argument , friend s an d equals . Becaus e th e
Dialogues are mor e accessibl e than the Principles,  it is from
the perspective of the Dialogues that most of this Introduction
is written. But almos t al l the argument s find a place in both
sources.
ii. Historical  Background
George Berkeley was born at Kilkenny on 12 March 1685. His
grandfather had gone to Ireland after the Restoration o f 1660
and hi s father was a gentlema n farmer . He entere d Trinit y
College Dublin in 1700, took his BA in 1704 and was elected
a Fellow in 1707. There he developed hi s system in the note s
now published a s the Philosophical  Commentaries  an d pub-
lished his first work, Essay Towards  a New Theory  o f Vision in
1709. This remaine d th e standar d theory o f vision until th e
mid-nineteenth century. In 1710 he was ordained priest in the
Anglican Churc h an d publishe d th e Principles  o f Human
Knowledge. Because this was thought merely peculiar in intel-
lectual circles in London, he wrote the Three  Dialogues  and
published them in London in 1713. Both volumes were moti-

vated by Berkeley's resistance to the 'new philosophy' of the
seventeenth century .
This new philosophy was, roughly, the philosophical articu-
lation of the new science of the period. Isaac Newton (1642-
1727) wa s the greates t scientis t of the age , an d Joh n Lock e
(1632-1704) th e philosophe r mos
t crucia l i n turnin g
Newtonian science into a philosophy, but many other philo-
sophers an d scientists , includin g Descarte s (1596-1650) ,
Malebranche (1638-1715) , Galile o (1564-1642) , an d Boyl e
(1627-91) helped form and popularize the new ideas. Most of
the moder n thinkers—wit h th e importan t exceptio n o f th e
Cartesians—were atomists . Atomist s no t onl y believe d tha t
bodies are made from minute particles, they also held that the
particles, and th e bodie s mad e fro m them , possess onl y pri-
mary, and not secondary qualities . Descartes, thoug h reject-
ing atomism, agreed that bodies really only possessed primary
qualities. This means that, in themselves, bodies possess size,
shape, motion , an d impenetrability , but no t colour , sound ,
taste, hardness, or smell.1 These latter qualities are said to be
dependent o n the senses—colour is, so to speak, generated in
the min d through the eye , sound throug h the mechanis m of
hearing, etc. But th e secondar y qualitie s ar e a  vital compo -
nent of the world as we experience it. It follows that the world
of experience i s very different fro m th e worl d as science dis-
covers it really to be. And not merely are they different quali-
tatively, but they are located in different realms . Because the
things of which we are immediatel y aware really do posses s
secondary qualities , an d becaus e secondar y qualitie s exis t
only 'in the mind', then what we are aware of are 'ideas in the
mind', not object s in the externa l world. The idea s of which
we are aware are, indeed, held to represent, and, in respect of
primary qualities, resemble, objects in the world, but, never-
theless, the y als o constitut e a  'vei l o f perception ' standin g
between th e perceive r an d th e externa l world . S o th e
phenomenal or experiential realm , on the one hand, is differ -

xii Introduction
ent from the real or external world investigated by science, on
the other .
The term 'idea ' as coined b y Locke an d used by Berkeley
does not have its normal sense—a fact much remarked upo n
by Locke's contemporaries . We think of ideas as creatures of
the intellect , as things that ar e thought: indeed 'idea' is very
close to 'concept'. Locke, however, defined a n idea as 'what-
ever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks' and
included sensation s an d sensor y image s amongs t ideas : in -
deed, not merely did he include them, they became the para-
digm ideas, for ideas are treated a s sensory, or quasi-sensory,
images. Traditiona l Aristotelia n an d scholasti c philosoph y
had distinguished between two kinds of objects of mental life.
On th e on e hand , ther e ar e form s o r species , whic h ar e
universals, and so appropriate for intellect and thought: these
are, roughly , what w e woul d cal l 'concepts' . O n th e othe r
hand, there ar e phantasms, which are the objects for sensory
perception, an d are particular sensor y images or sense-data .
Locke's adoptio n o f th e ter m 'idea ' fo r al l menta l object s
signalled his determination t o assimilate these tw o groups—
the intellectual and the sensory—to each other, and to make
the sensory the model for both. (Why he did this we shall see
in section (vii).)
Once one has accepted that one is directly aware of ideas in
the mind, in the sense just explained, not of external things, it
becomes pressin g to prove that there really are any external
things at all. To dramatize the possibility that there may be no
external world , Descarte s suggeste d tha t ou r experienc e
could be the product of an evil demon whose intention was to
deceive us. He then tried to refute such sceptical possibilities
by proving, a priori, the existence of a good God; such a God,
he argued, would not deceive us, nor allow us to be deceived,
in somethin g s o fundamenta l a s ou r belie f i n a n externa l
world. But Descartes's wa y of proving the existence of God—
the ontological argument—did no t command general accept -
ance, eve n amongs t theists . Locke' s respons e t o scepticis m
was hardl y mor e helpful . H e wa s robustl y anti-sceptica l in
spirit, but had little to offer in the way of argument against the
sceptic. Although non e o f the majo r figure s o f seventeenth -
century philosoph y wer e sceptics , th e ne w philosoph y wa s

always tainted, if not wit h espousing scepticism explicitly, at
least wit h having no convincin g refutation o f it and , hence ,
encouraging it amongst its readers. Thi s potential for scepti-
cism cam e t o fruitio n i n a  majo r philosopher slightl y later,
with David Hume (1711-76).
Closely connecte d t o th e fea r o f scepticis m was a  fea r of
materialism and atheism. The mechanistic and, hence, deter-
minist vie w o f th e physica l world tha t wen t wit h atomis m
made it difficult t o understand how immaterial spirits, such as
the soul or God, were related to the physical world: in particu-
lar it was thought difficult t o understand how there could be
causal interaction betwee n a material and an immaterial sub-
stance. Descartes's attempt t o make the interactio n of mind
and body scientifically respectable by saying that it took place
in a particular part of the brain—namel y the pineal gland—
conspicuously failed t o address the problem. The unease fel t
about interactio n suggested tha t a  materialist theory o f th e
mind would be preferable. And just as the mechanistic view o
f
the bod y threatene d t o squeez e ou t th e immateria l soul o r
mind, so Newton's rigorously determinist laws of motion lef t
God littl e t o d o i n th e cosmo s a t large . Th e respons e wa s
deism, according to which God sets the world in motion, but
then i t runs without His support o r intervention. Atheis m is
the next step. These tendencies had already borne fruit in the
materialist philosophy of Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679).
iii. Berkeley's  Philosophical  Task
We can see common sense as clinging to two principles. On e
is that we are directly aware of physical objects and the othe r
is that physical objects are independent of us and exist outside
our minds . The ne w philosophy mad e i t impossible t o hol d
both these principles in their natural sense. If we are directly
aware o f ideas i n ou r mind s and no t o f the externa l world,
then our naive realist understanding of perception canno t be
maintained. The new philosophers, typified b y Locke, there-
fore abandoned naive realism in favour of representative real-
ism. Berkeley, by contrast, was determined t o hold on to the
idea tha t w e are directl y awar e o f the physica l world itself ,
whilst acceptin g tha t wha t w e ar e awar e o f mus t b e mind -
dependent ideas . He was, therefore, forced to conclude that


xiv Introduction
the physical world consists essentially of ideas in our minds—
that it s esse  i s percipi: fo r materia l objects , t o b e i s t o b e
perceived. So instead of abandoning direct realism, Berkeley
preferred to abandon the principle of the mind-independenc e
of th e physica l world . A t least , h e modifie d it . Th e min d
independence of objects, according to Berkeley, is not absol-
ute, but relative. A physical object, unlike a hallucinatory one,
is not dependent on the perception o f any given person, and,
in that sense , i s mind-independent. Bu t h e denie s tha t any-
thing exist s outsid e al l minds taken together . Th e physica l
world consists of those patterns o f experience tha t are avail-
able to all: so metaphysical mind-independence is not neede d
to guarantee objectivity.
But if the world is just experience, then there is a problem
about th e origi n o f experience , fo r i t ca n n o longe r b e
explained b y th e interactio n o f th e subjec t an d th e mind -
independent physica l world. The natural alternativ e explan -
ation i s tha t God , instea d o f creatin g a  mind-independen t
world whic h then produce s experienc e i n us , produces th e
experience directly, and these experiences are deemed to con-
stitute th e physica l world. O n thi s scheme , w e ar e directly
acquainted wit h the physica l world, so removing the barrie r
which made scepticism a temptation, and God is made essen-
tial to the existence of the world at every moment.
iv. Perception  and th e World:
The Philosophical Options
Before considerin g Berkeley' s argument s for his idealism, it
would b e helpfu l t o hav e a  roug h taxonom y o f th e variou s
accounts of the relation between perception an d the physical
world that have appeared in modern philosophy. There are at
least eight such theories, and they mark out the ground fro m
naive realism, through differen t kind s of representative real -
ism, to idealism. The tw o forms o f realism that have already
been mentioned are :
(\d) Naive  o r direct  realism.  This i s suppose d t o b e th e
theory o f untutore d commo n sense , an d i t hold s tha t i n

physical objects and their mind-independent properties. So if,
in normal perception, I seem to see a red patch, then the red
expanse of which I am aware is the surface of a physical object
in public space: it is not simpl y some idea o r sense-datum in
my mind.
(2/7) Scientific  o r Lockean representative realism. This is the
view attribute d i n sectio n (ii ) t o th e 'ne w philosophy' : th e
external worl d possesses onl y primary qualities, the second -
ary bein g propertie s o f ideas ; bu t th e primar y qualities of
external things do resemble thos e of ideas. So if I accurately
perceive a red square, the external object will be square in the
way I perceive it to be; but its redness consists only in the fac t
that it has the power to cause in me the sensation of red; red-
as-I-see-it exists only in the mind's eye.
I hav e calle d thes e (10)  an d (26 ) becaus e ther e ar e tw o
positions so far not mentioned, one of which is an attenuated
kind of direct realism and the other a richer kind of represen-
tationalism whic h fal l betwee n the m o n th e spectru m o f
options. The attenuated version of direct realism is not a very
plausible theory, but Hylas seems to defend it at one point in
the argument, and it has had more recent supporters . It is
(ib) Primary  quality  direct realism. This theor y i s a com-
promise betwee n naiv e an d representativ e realism . I t say s
that the secondary qualities of which we are aware exist only
in our minds, but the very instances of the primary qualities of
which we are aware are external. So if I am aware of a square
patch of red, the red is a feature of an 'idea', but the square -
ness is the contour of an external physical thing. This is a very
odd theory, because it would seem that the shape must be the
shape o f th e re d patch, s o i f th e re d i s i n th e mind , tha t
particular instance of shape mus t be s o too. Hyla s might be
defending primary quality  direct realism on pag e 12 6 of th e
Three Dialogues. (See note to this passage.) The richer for m
of representative realism is
(20) Simple  representative  realism. We ar e directl y aware
only o f 'idea s i n the mind' , but th e externa l physical world
resembles these ideas in respect of both primary and second-

ary qualities . Bot h idea s an d externa l thing s ca n be , fo r
example, red and square in just the same way. Visual ideas are
like coloured photograph s of a coloured world.
There ar e tw o other mor e attenuate d form s of represen -
tative realism which were not explicitly developed unti l after
Berkeley's death , bu t agains t which some o f hi s arguments
can be employed.
(3) Structural  representative realism. The primary qualities
that externa l object s posses s canno t b e sai d t o resembl e
those qualities as found in ideas. What they have in common
is purel y forma l o r structural . Thi s ma y mea n n o mor e
than tha t the y ca n b e describe d i n th e sam e mathematica l
way.
(4) Kantian  o r 'barely  representative'  realism.  Nothing, or
virtually nothing, can be sai d about th e natur e o f the mind-
independent world , except tha t i t is, in some sense , respon -
sible for the world of experience .
All these form s of realism can be subdivide d according t o
how they stand on a further issue. I have been talkin g about
the externa l world in terms of the kin d of qualities it is sup-
posed to possess, but physical objects are substances and there
is the question of what there is to a substance in addition to its
qualities—if anything. That there is an extra something seems
to follow from the thought that qualities and other propertie s
belong to something and that this something is not itself just a
bundle o f qualities, but a  deeper 'thinginess' . Because o f its
mysteriousness, not everyone agrees that one needs this extra.
Indeed, althoug h Lock e wrot e a  long chapte r o n substanc e
(Essay, 2 . 23) an d talke d extensivel y about th e substratum
which i s ove r an d abov e qualities , scholar s canno t agre e
whether he was for it or against it!
So all the above forms of realism can be distinguished int o
a versio n i n whic h th e externa l worl d consist s o f sensibl e
qualities whic h belon g t o som e furthe r substratum o r sub-
stance—the unknow n extr a tha t own s th e qualities—an d a
version whic h has the externa l object s consisting entirely of


Introduction xvi
i
qualities. This distinction is relevant to our concerns because
Berkeley discusse s th e ide a tha t matte r possesse s a  sub-
stratum, a s well a s th e questio n o f what qualitie s matte r i s
supposed t o possess.
There remai n th e tw o principa l form s o f non-realism, as
articulated by Berkeley an d Hume .
(5) Berkelian  idealism.  Ther e i s nothin g t o th e physica l
world except our experience and its patterns. This ordering of
experience is sustained directly by God.
(6) Sceptical  o r Humean phenomenalism. There i s nothing
to the physical world except experience an d its patterns, and
there i s no goo d reaso n t o loo k fo r a n explanatio n o f why
there shoul d be suc h ordered experiences : thei r existenc e is
just a brute fact .
Although som e o f these position s wer e no t explicitl y for
-
mulated until after Berkeley' s day, ther
e are arguments that
can be deployed agains t all except (5), Berkeley's ow n posi-
tion, i n th e text s i n thi s book . Berkele y can , therefore, b e
read as trying to eliminate all the above options other than his
own. First, he seeks to refute naive realism, then the forms of
representative realism , discreditin g th e notio n o f material
substratum on the way: then to show that God is required for
the system . This is, in effect, th e structur e o f the Three  Dia-
logues. At the centre of such a strategy is the refutation of the
realism that is common to (i)-(4). This Berkeley attempts in
two radically different ways . One way is to examine the con-
cept o f matter an d discover that it lacks any proper content .
The essenc e o f thi s strateg y i s t o enquir e wha t propertie s
mind-independent matter is supposed t o possess and to show
that it could not possess any of them. This is a natural part of
the attack s on naiv e an d representativ e realism , for i t is by
arguing tha t neithe r primar y no r secondar y qualitie s nor a
residual substratu m coul d b e mind-independen t tha t h e re -
futes the theories of perception an d the theories of the physi-
cal world that ar e contained i n (i)-(4). The secon d strategy
against matter is radically different an d philosophically more
esoteric. It starts not primarily from reflecting on the conten t


xviii Introduction
of the concept o f matter, but fro m reflectin g on the nature of
thought—on what it is for something to be, or be the conten t
of, an idea—and concluding that there cannot be a concept or
idea o f anythin g essentially independen t o f mind . I t i s this
strategy of which Berkeley was most proud and which greatly
impressed Hume. 2 I t i s expressed i n th e attac k o n abstrac t
ideas and the supposed proof that one cannot conceive of the
unperceived. A t it s cor e lie s th e theor y tha t thought s ar e
merely images—that is, they are not essentially different fro m
sense-contents an d sensations . Berkele y want s t o res t a
knock-down demonstration o f idealism on the foundation of
this theory of thought, but, as we shall see, this conception of
thought i s so confused an d inadequat e tha t Berkele y ha s t o
fall bac k o n th e mor e luci d and commonsensica l argument s
that constitute his more general attack on matter. This is why
it is the mas s of arguments that make up his criticisms of the
other theorie s an d o f particular conception s o f matter tha t
have more usuall y impressed hi s more moder n readers , and
why i t ha s bee n a  puzzle fo r man y commentator s ho w th e
attack o n abstractio n i s supposed t o relat e t o th e proo f o f
idealism.
v. Th e Main Argument of the Three Dialogue s
a. Against  the  externality of  secondary qualities.  First I  shall
consider th e les s esoteric argumen t of the Three  Dialogues.
The Dialogues  wer e writte n t o mak e th e doctrin e an d th e
argument o f th e Principles  mor e accessible . Th e Principles
starts from Berkeley's more or less novel theory of concepts—
his attack on 'abstract ideas'—and approaches the notions of
matter an d mind-independenc e wit h that nove l theor y very
much i n mind . Th e Three  Dialogues,  b y contrast , start s
from th e kin d o f argument s agains t naiv e realis m tha t
would hav e been familia r t o hi s readers an d seek s t o show
that thes e argument s develo p naturall y int o argument s
against representative realism , and, hence, against realism in

greatest and most valuable discoveries that has been made of late years in
the republic of letters'; Treatise  o f Human Nature,  i. 7.

general. The attac k on abstract ideas is invoked where help-
ful, bu t i t is not th e cornerston e tha t it is meant to be in the
Principles.
In the Three  Dialogues  Berkeley attack s ever y one o f our
eight options except (5)—his own form of idealism—more or
less in the order I number them. After an initial exchange on
the danger s o f scepticism , Hylas an d Philonou s agre e tha t
'sensible things' consist of 'sensible qualities', such as 'lights,
colours, figures, sounds, tastes, odours'. Philonous set s out to
prove that all these sensibl e qualities and, hence, all sensible
things are mind-dependent. To do this he mainly uses three
arguments that would have been familiar to, and accepted by,
the 'moder n minded' amongs t his readers. Tw o of these ar e
still amongs t th e stock-in-trad e philosophica l argument s
against naive realism. The first is the argument from illusion,
which concludes from the fact that objects look (or sound, or
feel, etc. ) differen t t o differen t observer s o r t o th e sam e
observer a t differen t times , whilst not themselve s changing,
that wha t on e i s directl y awar e o f i n thos e varie d 'looks '
cannot b e th e object s themselves . Th e secon d i s the causal
argument, whic h argue s fro m th e fac t tha t ou r experience s
are cause d a t th e en d o f a  chai n o f event s tha t run s fro m
the object to the sense organ and then the brain, to the conclu-
sion tha t th e immediat e object s o f thos e experience s mus t
also be  cause d at  the  end  of  the proces s and  so  be 'i n the
mind' o r 'i n th e head' ; they , therefore, canno t b e identica l
with the objects in the external world that initiated the causal
chain. Th e thir d argument , which is of ancien t origin , doe s
not hav e the sam e modern currenc y as the othe r tw o and is
less familiar . I t migh t b e calle d th e assimilation  argument.
Certain menta l content s ar e incontrovertibl y subjective , s o
that it makes no sense to suggest that they might exist extra-
mentally. Ther e are , fo r example , n o thoughts , emotions ,
pains, o r sensation s outsid e o f minds. On e wa y o f showing
that sensibl e qualitie s are subjectiv e would be t o sho w tha t
they ar e essentiall y interconnected wit h one o f these neces -
sarily subjectiv e element s an d s o assimilat e th e sensibl e
quality to the subjective one. Berkeley follows a line of argu-
ment dating at least from Aristotle , which asserts that certain

pain. A n exampl e o f thi s strateg y i s his treatmen t o f heat .

the external world.31 mention this now largely ignored strat-
egy becaus e i t wil l featur e i n th e crucia l question , t o b e
discussed later, of whether 'an idea can be like nothing but an
idea'.
I cannot dea l satisfactorily here with the still controversial
question o f whethe r these , an d simila r argument s agains t
naive realism are successful. 4 As they were the common cur-
rency of the day, Berkeley's claim to fame rests, not on them,
but o n the idealist developments h e makes from them . On e
point is, however, worth making. On pages 112-25 °f the First
Dialogue he applies the above arguments to secondary quali-
ties, an d conclude s 'Colours , sounds , tastes , i n a  word , all
those termed secondary qualities, have certainly no existence
without the mind. ' Berkele y i s here making an exaggerated
claim. Al l tha t th e arguments , even i f sound, justify on e i n
concluding i s that thos e instance s o f secondar y qualitie s o f
which one is immediately aware exist only in the mind: they do
not, tha t is , refute (20}  above , simple representative  realism,
according to which both primary and secondary qualities be-
long both to ideas in the mind and to the external objects the
ideas represent. I n making this confusion, Berkeley is simply
following Locke, who had used similar arguments against the
objectivity of secondary qualities. Both Lock e an d Berkeley,
that is, confuse arguments which, if successful, show that th e
immediate object s o f ou r awarenes s ar e subjective , wit h
proofs tha t secondar y qualitie s are per se subjective.5 I n th e
case of secondary qualities this is, perhaps, an understandable
mistake, because secondary qualities play such a central role
3 I  discuss this argument in the note to Dialogues, p. 112 .
4 I  argue that, contrary to current belief, the arguments are successfu l
in Perception (London: Routledge, 1994).
5 I n Essay,  2. 8. 21 Locke argues that the perception of primary quali-
ties does not vary with subjective conditions
, as perception of secondaries
does, and that this shows the former to exist externally and the latter in
the mind.

i
in constituting the immediat e objects of our awareness . But,
as we shall see when considering primary qualities, the error is
more gros s tha n that; for it appears t o involv e the principl e
that, i f a  kin d o f qualit y i s prove d t o exis t i n th e mind , i t
follows that it does not also exist outside the mind, and this is
question-begging.

read a s then considerin g the bizarre option (ib)\  tha t we are
directly awar e o f externa l primar y qualities , thoug h no t o f
secondary. He has no difficulty refutin g this by using the same
arguments as he had used to refute the objectivity of second-
ary qualities, and similarly proceeds t o conclude that primary
qualities exis t onl y i n th e mind . H e i s thereb y misle d int o
thinking that h e has disposed o f the form s o f representativ e
realism containe d i n (20) , (2/7) , an d (possibly ) (3) . Locke' s
mistaken interpretation o f these arguments is, therefore, eas -
ily turned against his own philosophy. It is not until late on in
the first dialogue, afte r a n interesting digression , tha t Hyla s
realizes that representationalism i s still available. The digres-
sion contains three arguments that all involve backtracking on
his concession tha t no sensible qualitie s exist externally. Two
of these arguments merit comment .
In on e o f these , Hyla s suggest s tha t i f on e distinguishe s

to. The psychological state is the ac t and the objec t i s out in

poles of perception. A  proper discussion of this point would
take us into the more sophisticated reaches of the philosophy
of perception , bu t Philonous ' respons e i s not withou t force .

xxii Introduction
The othe r interestin g argumen t i n th e digressio n come s
from Hylas ' suggestion that sensible qualitie s can be looke d
on i n eithe r o f tw o ways : the y ca n b e considere d eithe r a s
modes of sensation which could not exist outside the mind; or
as modes o f a material substratum. This does nothing to an-
swer directly the argument s already employed agains t mind-
independent sensibl e qualities, and faces also the problem of
giving some literal sense to 'substratum' and its task of 'under-
lying' or 'supporting' qualities. Berkeley argues that one can
make sense of an unknown, such as substratum is meant to be,
only if one can set it in a known relation to something known.
An example of this might be that I can form an idea of Smith's
father, though I do not know him, because I know Smith and
understand the relation 'being the father of. Substratu m sup-
posedly stands in relation to known sensible qualities, but that
relation—'underlying' o r 'supporting'—i s itsel f metaphor -
ical—not 'a s your legs support you r body'. So there are no t
two knowns and one unknown , but tw o unknowns and only
one known . Thi s i s essentiall y Berkeley' s objectio n t o al l
those forms of realism that make material substance consist of
more than qualities alone.
The digression ends when Hylas realizes that he should be
defending a  representative realism involving qualities alone ,
so picking the argument up where it should have left off after
the attack on naive realism.
To speak the truth, Philonous, I think there are two kinds of objects,
the on e perceived immediately, which are likewise called ideas', th e
other ar e real things or external objects perceived b y the mediatio n
of ideas , which ar e thei r image s an d representations . Now I  own,
ideas do not exist without the mind; but the latter sort of objects do.
I am sorry I did not think of this distinction sooner ... (pp. 142-3)
Philonous glosses this, saying: 'you will have our ideas, which
alone ar e immediatel y perceived, t o b e picture s o f externa l
things . ..' Philonous make s two important responses : (i ) He
asks ho w w e coul d eve r com e t o kno w abou t th e object s
behind th e pictures . I n th e cas e o f normal pictures, we can
perceive bot h pictur e an d objec t wit h th e sam e degre e o f

directness, but i n the cas e of ideas and things only the idea s
are directl y available in experience . Ou r knowledg e of ob -
jects, therefore, would have to be 'by some internal faculty of
the soul, as reason o r memory'. Hylas here admits 'I do not
find I can give you any good reason for ' believing in objects,
but in the second dialogue he comes near to the natural reply
by saying that the external world causes, and thereby explains,
our ideas. That the y provide such an explanation would be a
reason for believing in external objects.
Berkeley's response t o this suggestion brings into play one
of th e mos t contentious of his anti-realist claims. He argue s
that only minds are real causal agents, so the postulation of an
external world could never explain anything. He backs this up
by an appeal to introspection. We know from experience that
our volitions can cause things, but that ideas are passive: we
see the white blob touch the red blob and the red blob then
moves, and we see such things regularly, but see no making or
causing connectin g the whit e an d th e re d ideas . Berkeley' s
position would have seemed muc h weaker if he had concen -
trated on tactile, rather than visual cases. The feeling of being
pressed and the feeling of motion that is associated with it do
not seem to be merely contingently connected—it seems to be
part of the nature of the one that it tends to lead to the other .
Even if this is so (which is not clear ) the Berkelia n need no t
worry. The feeling of being pushed is still a feeling and, hence,
a mental state. To say that causal power in the world is like a
feeling o f pressur e excep t tha t i t i s outsid e o f min d seem s
hardly better than saying it is like an extra-mental act of will.
Phenomenological judgements in these areas are very difficult
to evaluate , but i t is plausible for a  Berkelian to argu e that
saying something is like what you feel when you feel yourself
being pushed, excep t tha t i t i s not a  sensation , is no bette r
than saying that something is like yellow, but not a colour, (ii)
His second response is to deny that there could be anything in
the externa l worl d which was like anythin g presented i n an
idea: 'nothin g bu t a n ide a coul d b e lik e a n idea' . I f thi s is
correct the n n o kin d of representative realis m which allows
the representatio n t o tel l u s anythin g about wha t th e thin g

represented i s like, will be possible: this would certainly rule
out (20)  an d (26) which claim that ideas and the world share
certain positiv e qualities . I t woul d probabl y permi t (4) , for
that makes no claims about the nature of the physical world:
whether i t allows (3) will depend o n whether structura l fea-
tures ar e 'likenesses ' in the sens e covere d b y this argument
(whatever that sense exactly may be).
c. That  'an idea can be like nothing but an idea'. When applied
to perceptual  ideas , thi s principl e seems , a t firs t sight ,
both sophistical and question-begging. On the ordinary, non-
philosophical sense of 'idea', where it means thought or con-
cept, it is plausible to say that nothing outside the mind could
be lik e an idea , for thing s like bits of thoughts cannot floa t
around in the externa l world. But Berkeley is using 'idea' in
Locke's way, to mean anything with which the mind concerns
itself directly , which include s perceptual content s a s well a s
intellectual contents. And it seems simply to beg the question
against the representative realis t to assert a s a principle that
the extra-menta l worl d coul d no t b e lik e ou r perceptua l
contents.
The situatio n for Berkeley's argument is not, however, as
bad a s this suggests. It i s true, no t onl y tha t nothin g extra -
mental coul d b e like a thought, but als o that nothing extra -
mental coul d b e lik e a  sensation . A s I  pointe d ou t whe n
discussing the assimilation argument above , there can be no
pains, itches , or tactile sensations , o r anythin g like them, in
the externa l world. Berkeley has to show, therefore, tha t all
perceptual 'ideas ' fall into this category: in particular, he has
to show that colour patches are just as much mere sensations
as twinges and feelings. His attack o n visual depth (whic h is
discussed in (vii)) is part of such a strategy. It can be carrie d
further b y a  thought-experiment . Imagin e someon e bor n
blind, wh o wa s given , by direc t cortica l stimulation , visual
sensations. Give n tha t thes e were no t s o ordered a s to ma p
onto his picture of the world gained through the other senses,
would there be anything about them which made them seem
any different i n status from other sensations? Although this is
speculative, i t seem s reasonabl e t o gues s tha t the y woul d

seem to be 'in the head' and no more apparently external than
aches and throbs. It is the kind of structure that normal visual
experience possesses , rathe r tha n it s intrinsi c nature , tha t
makes it natural to read its contents as external.6 If our visual
experience wer e chaoti c an d accidental , eve n tha t featur e
of it that we identify a s visual shape would have no apparen t
claim t o greate r objectivit y tha n an y othe r featur e o f th e
sensation.
If these considerations have force, then the external world
would no t b e lik e ou r idea s o f it an d s o would have t o b e
something the natur e o f which (if it has one ) i s hidden fro m
us. Thi s conceptio n o f physica l realit y i s on e tha t wa s de -
veloped afte r Berkeley , but there ar e arguments in our texts
which are relevant to it.
Hylas suggests that we have no other conception o f matter
than as that which causes experience. If developed systemati-
cally, this would lead to the conception o f the physical world
as th e forma l structur e o f causa l law s tha t explai n th e
phenomena: that is, as a version of (3), structural representa-
tive realism.  Berkeley admit s that ther e coul d b e thing s of
which we do not know the intrinsic nature (pp. 164-5), so his
only direc t objectio n t o thi s attenuate d realis m is the clai m
that causation is essentially connecte d with will and, hence,
mental.7 In desperation Hyla s attenuates matter further: 'I at
present understan d by matter neither substance nor accident,
thinking nor extende d being , neither cause , instrument, nor
occasion, bu t somethin g entirel y unknown , distinc t fro m
all these ' (p . 163) . This conceptio n i s reminiscent o f Kant' s
noumenon, in that it is wholly negative: matter has become a
mere place-holder (not literally, for Hylas concedes that place
has been shown to be mental). Philonou s has little difficult y
persuading Hylas that this idea is entirely empty. Having done
this, eac h o f (i ) t o (4 ) ha s bee n dispose d o f t o Berkeley' s
satisfaction.

Treatise, i. 4. 2.
7 Thi s is the onl y argument apart fro m thos e t o be considere d in th e
next section by which he argues that the very idea of extra-mental exist-
ence is defective.


xxvi Introduction
vi. Mites,  Men, and  Objective  Space
There i s an argumen t that Berkele y use s agains t the objec -
tivity of physical space which is not, I think, taken seriously by
most commentators, bu t which I believe has more force than
is generally appreciated. Berkeley argues that because things
look bigge r to a  mite than to a  human and there i s no clea r
sense i n whic h on e o f the m perceive s th e 'right ' size , the n
there i s no fac t abou t th e siz e and, therefore, n o suc h thing
as rea l o r objectiv e size , an d s o n o suc h thin g a s mind -
independent spatia l dimensions.
The first objection to this argument that springs to mind is
that measurement ca n pick out real size and that, irrespective
of how it looks to mite or man, an object will have a specifi c
measurable size; for example, being two inches long. But this
will achieve nothing unless we can give objectivity to units of
measurement, an d an inch is a long distance to a mite and a
small on e t o a  human, so in agreein g that a n objec t i s two
inches lon g th e mit e an d th e ma n hav e onl y a n illusio n of
agreement. Ther e i s agreement o n th e relativ e size s of th e
object an d a n inc h on a  ruler, but n o agreemen t abou t th e
absolute siz e o f either . I t seem s tha t subject s o f radicall y
different size s can agre e o n th e relative  sizes of objects, bu t
not on their intrinsic dimensions. The response to this is obvi-
ous, namely that size is a relative matter and agreeing on the
relative dimension s o f thing s i s agreeing o n thei r actua l di-
mensions. The matter is not, however, quite so simple. It can
be proved tha t a  purely formal definition of space, in terms,
say, o f Cartesia n co-ordinate s an d axes , i s not a  complet e
representation o f the nature of space.8 As well as such formal
features, ther e mus t b e somethin g intuitiv e an d qualitative ,
like th e wa y that extensio n present s itsel f experientiall y i n
vision. But it is in respect of this qualitative feature that things
look man y time s large r t o th e mite : relative sizes ar e pre -
served, but th e qualitativ e interpretations o f dimensions ar e
not. I f suc h a n interpretatio n i s essential t o an y rea l space ,
as I  have claime d i t is, then ther e is a problem. Th e physi -
cal worl d i n whic h thing s canno t al l doubl e i n size—as

they can when one moves from a human world to a mite's—is
an abstractio n create d b y measuremen t fro m th e variou s
worlds of experience, which are th e ultimat e constituents of
reality. This is a line of argument that I  think merits further
investigation.9
vii. Th e Principles an d Abstraction
The feature of The Principles on which I want to concentrat e
is Berkeley' s theor y o f thought . This i s to b e foun d i n th e
attack on abstract ideas in the Introduction, and in section 23,
where h e argue s tha t w e cannot for m th e ide a o f an extra -
mental object. (Thi s argument als o occur s in Dialogues, pp.
139-40.) Berkeley's purpose i s to demystify ou r understand-
ing of thought.
Thoughts and their contents possess two strictly distinct but
closely connecte d properties . First , thought s posses s inten -
tionality, which means that they are about things other tha n
themselves: my thoughts are about elephants or books, which
are not themselve s simply events in my mind. Second, most
thought contents possess generality. All our concepts, except
those strictly used to name or indicate particular objects, ex-
press features , such as being red o r bein g human, which an
indefinite number o f things might possess. Being about things
and being general are mysterious properties, in the sense that
they are peculiar t o mind and ar e not possessed b y physical
particulars i n thei r ow n right . Th e classica l an d medieva l
preoccupation wit h forms an d universal s was precisely con -
cerned with the generality of thought and with how the world
had t o b e s o tha t i t coul d matc h th e generalit y foun d i n
thought—that is , how the worl d ha d t o b e s o that thought s
could b e tru e o f it . This concer n spawne d a  whol e clas s of
general o r potentiall y genera l entities , suc h a s forms ,
universals, essences , an d sensibl e species . Nominalists—o f

reality.

whom Ockha m i s the mos t notorious—denie d the realit y of
generality i n th e world , someho w wantin g generality t o b e
spun by language, an
d by the seventeenth century nominalists
had gained the day with regard to supposed generalit y in the
external world , but some , suc h a s Descartes, stil l accepte d
generality as an intrinsic feature of mental life. British philo-
sophers—including bot h Hobbe s an d Locke—wer e deter -
mined tha t absolutel y everythin g rea l ha d t o b e wholl y
particular. This leaves a problem for the undoubted generality
of thought . Th e particular s tha t wer e agree d t o constitut e
thought were images, conceived of as colour patches, sounds,
etc. Thus there was no essential differenc e between though t
and sensation. Locke tried to solve the problem of generality
by invoking abstract general ideas, which, sometimes at least,
he treats as abstract general images. So the idea of triangle is
an imag e whic h is , at th e sam e time , ever y specifi c kin d of
triangle—isosceles, rectangle, scalene, etc.—and none in par-
ticular. Berkele y ha s n o difficult y showin g tha t ther e i s n o
sense in the ide a o f such a n image. His alternativ e theory is
that a  thoroughly particular image becomes genera l by rep-
resenting or standing for som e class of images. From the point
of view of the subject, this happens by his selectively attending
to the relevant featur e of the image. So, though I am imaging
an equilateral triangle, I take it as representing all triangles by
selectively attending just to the fact that it has three sides, and
ignoring their relative proportions, it s size, colour, etc.
This explains why Berkeley thought his attack on abstrac -
tion refuted the belief in mind-independent reality . If we can
have genuine ideas only of those features which are literall y
realized i n images, such a s red o r square , o r ar e name s fo r
collections o f such idea s (suc h a s 'apple' ) the n being  mind-
independent, being  unperceived, or material substance will not
be genuine ideas, for no idea ca n literally possess thes e fea-
tures: al l idea s ca n occu r i n hallucination s an d n o halluci -
nation can literally possess such characteristics. Nor can they
be names for a  collection o f ideas, unless one agree s to give
these concept s their Berkelian gloss.
His theory of thought explains what otherwise can seem the
rather strange argument in section 23. Berkeley appears to be

arguing tha t yo u canno t for m th e ide a o f somethin g
unthought of, for once you form such an idea its object is, ipso
facto, thought of.
To make out [tha t the objects of your thought may exist without the
mind], it is necessary that you conceive them existing unconceived or
unthought of , whic h i s a  manifes t repugnancy . Whe n w e d o ou r
utmost to conceiv e the existenc e o f external bodies, we are al l the
while only contemplating our own ideas.
Put in this way, the argument feels sophistical: all you need is
a distinction between th e thought  an d its object, an d thoug h
the former is in the mind, the latter is not. This distinction is
what we mean by the intentionality of thought. The theory of
thought foun d i n th e introductio n t o th e Principles  under -
mines such an appeal to intentionality. If everything thinkabl
e
can be realized in an image as a feature of it, then the concepts
of mind-independen t matter
, an d mind-independence
,
simpliciter, shoul d b e s o realizable . But , necessarily , suc h
things cannot b e propertie s o f images, which are essentially
mental, so we cannot have ideas of them.
It i s at this point that the argumen t about visual distance,
which had been the mai n topic of the New Theory  o f Vision,
Berkeley's firs t book , become s important . I t i s natura l t o
suggest that we are directly aware of distance in sight, because
things look to be out in front o f us and some of them look t o
be furthe r awa y than others : s o these visua l ideas d o see m
really to represent th e property of externality and mind-inde-
pendence. Berkeley argue s agains t thi s suggestio n tha t dis -
tance i s not a  rea l visua l phenomenon becaus e i t i s 'a line
turned end on to the eye'. If we consider visual space on the
left-right an d up-down axes, then a space of, say, two inches
is represented b y an area in which a two-inch visual object—
an extent of colour—could be present to awareness. For these
axes, that is, a spatial distance is something in which a visual
phenomenon i s presented. But this is not so for depth. If one
object i s two inches behind anothe r the n th e spac e betwee n
them i s invisible, in th e sens e tha t somethin g place d ther e
cannot be seen. The line is end-on to the eye in the sense that
no spatia l exten t i s directl y visibl e i n depth . Ou r sens e o f


xxx Introduction
depth come s onl y from a  learnt associatio n betwee n certai n
visual experiences an d the fac t tha t we have to reach out t o
touch the more distan t objects. It is this correlation betwee n
touch an d visio n tha t create s th e experienc e o f depth , no t
something intrinsic to vision.
The objectio n fro m intentionality , however , i s no t ad -
equately dealt with merely by disparaging our perception o f
depth. No theory of thought can operate without a distinction
between th e thought, considered a s a psychological episode,
and what the thought is about. Berkeley does not deny that I
can now think of myself a s existing yesterday, and that I can
think of your mind and what might be in it: but neither pas t
time nor other minds and their contents can be features of the
current image with which I am thinking. If a current episod e
of thought could not be about something outside that episode,
then we would be stuck in a solipsism of the present moment;
that is, we could have no thought of anything but the current
contents o f our ow n consciousness .
Berkeley does implicitly take notice of these problems, for,
as we have seen , h e doe s have a  doctrine o f representatio n
whereby a n ide a ca n stan d fo r others . A s w e shal l see , hi s
account of this is seriously inadequate.
Berkeley's claim that particular ideas stand for other idea s
is the source of the doctrine ofassociationism, whic h was to be
the principle empiricist account of meaning and thought until
the end of the nineteenth century . Associationists explaine d
thought and meaning by saying that the meaning of a mental
episode consisted in its association with other mental episode s
which tended t o occur in close proximity to it. For example ,
the word 'red' means the colour red because the word tends to
summon up an image of the colour. Hume applies this idea to
explain ou r attributio n o f necessit y t o causa l relations : be -
cause we have often seen events of type F followed by events
of type G, whenever we see an F our minds immediately form
an idea of G, and so we think them necessarily connected .
A fatal flaw with associationism can be exposed by noticing
an ambiguity in the notion of association. An associatio n can
be either objective o r subjective i n the following way. It might
just b e a  matte r o f fac t tha t certai n idea s tende d t o occu r

together, or it might be the case that the subject noticed these
associations and so actively thought of them as associated. In
so far as we are trying to understand the experience of mean-
ingful thought , it must be th e latte r that is intended, for th e
bare occurrenc e o f correlations woul d not alon e constitut e
the experience of meaning. Berkeley certainly meant the sub-
jective association when he talked of attending to the triangu-
larity of a particular triangle and ignorin g its other features.
But t o allo w that on e ca n subjectively see an idea a s repre-
senting others and that one can attend to some feature of an
idea reimports the original problem of generality. For what is
it for one idea to represent others to a subject, if it is not only
for them to be objectively associated? Making an association
between particula r idea s canno t consis t i n havin g another
wholly particular idea or image. It would seem to be for them
to b e brough t unde r a  concept , wher e a  concep t i s a n in -
herently genera l kin d o f entity . An d th e kin d o f attentio n
involved in selectively attending to the triangularity of a par-
ticular idea is not a  mere focusing on a  spatial region of the
idea, it is the focusin g o n a  conceptual feature of the image,
and thi s presupposes, i t does no t analyse , the possessio n of
concepts.
Even if we were to ignore these difficulties with Berkeley's
nominalism, the doctrin e o f the associatio n o f ideas canno t
overcome th e problem s with intentionality raised by section
23. If my current idea can mean the other ideas with which it
is associated, then I am no longer trapped in a solipsism of the
present moment , for m y current idea can mean other idea s
with whic h m y experienc e associate s it . Bu t I  a m stil l a
solipsist, fo r n o associatio n ca n b e mad e i n m y experienc e
between a n ide a o f mine an d a n ide a o f yours, for I  never
experience the latter. For Berkeley, the fundamental form by
which idea s represen t on e anothe r i s through resemblance ,
not simpl y by brut e contingen t association , lik e caus e an d
effect, whic h need possess no similarity . So one triangl e can
represent al l triangles. I can , therefore, think o f something
similar to my current idea and impute it either to my own past
or t o you r mind . Thes e othe r time s an d othe r mind s ar e

logous to—the present moment and my own mind. Intention-
ality is, for Berkeley, therefore, a  matter of association and,
primarily, of resemblance.
It is at this point that the argument based on the nature of
thought ceases to be autonomous. If the present red , squar e
idea can represent othe r ideas that are square, why cannot it
represent squar e a s it occurs in the external, physical world?
Once ther e is allowed to be 'intentionalit y by resemblance',
then qualities in the world similar to those in the mind should
be amongst the things one can intend. At this point the prin-
ciple tha t 'a n ide a ca n b e lik e nothin g but a n idea ' (s . 8)
becomes essential to the argument, for only by appeal to that
principle can it be denied tha t images can represent externa l
qualities that resemble them. But the same principle was es-
sential to the attac k on representative realism . 'Nothing but
an idea can be like an idea' turns out to be the corner-stone of
both of Berkeley's argumentative strategies, and the nominal-
ist argument loses any independent force.
viii. Salvaging  Berkeley o n Abstraction
Berkeley's remarks on abstraction are not as completely mis-
conceived a s the abov e may suggest. Imagism as a theory of
what concepts are is hopeless, but an imagist approach to what
we ca n conceive of—that is , to th e content s o f concepts—is
not open to the same objections, and captures more directly
the spiri t of empiricism. It is empiricism free d fro m th e con -
cern t o be nominalist. Imagism as a theory of the content  of
concepts, rathe r tha n o f th e natur e o f concept s themselve s
could be expressed a s follows:
The only properties tha t we can conceive of as they are in
themselves ar e one s tha t ca n b e presente d in , o r con -
structed from feature s presented in , experience.
Clearly not all concepts could have their contents represente d
in images in this way. For example , logical connectives, such
as 'and', 'or', and 'if... then', do not have that kin d of con-
tent—though ultra-empiricist s hav e trie d suc h move s a s
equating the sense of 'or' with a feeling of uncertainty at the
back o f the neck ! And on e would probably nee d somethin g

like analogy to carry one from a  grasp on one's own experi-
ence to giving sense to something as being another mind and
its contents , fo r th e propert y o f belonging  t o someone  else
could not be directly imaged. But it is intuitively plausible to
claim that the fundamenta l properties o f the worl d must be
like somethin g in themselves.  And i f we canno t experienc e
certain propertie s directly—a s w e canno t th e propertie s o f
electrons or, if the defenc e given above o f the principl e that
'an idea can be like nothing but an idea' is sound, the proper-
ties of the mind-independent world in general, then we cannot
know what those properties—electrons, or the external world
in general—are like in themselves. We can then either think
of them on analogy with what we experience by constructing
models t o interpre t them , or ca n try to treat thei r concept s
on analogy with the logical connectives, as ideas used to struc-
ture an d relat e element s tha t hav e th e mor e full-bloode d

ix. Th e Case  for Theistic  Idealism
This completes Berkeley's case against physical realism, but it
leaves open th e choic e between his theistic idealism and th e
sceptical phenomenalism of Hume, tha t is , between option s
(5) and (6). The plain fact is that Berkeley does not seriously
consider th e sceptica l possibilit y tha t ou r experienc e ma y
come—and come in ordered patterns—withou t any cause. It
seems obvious to him—as it does to common sense—that such
things are not acceptable as brute facts. Similarly, he does not
consider Hume' s radica l empiricis t principl e tha t wha t i s
probable or improbable can only be based on experience, so
there ca n be nothing improbable in the fac t tha t experienc e
just happen s t o come , an d com e i n patterns; thi s cannot be
improbable, o n Humea n principles , becaus e experienc e
shows u s i t happen s tha t way . Th e differenc e betwee n


xxxiv Introduction
Berkeley an d Hum e is that Berkele y i s implicitly acceptin g
that ther e ar e a  prior i probabilitie s relevan t t o matter s of
fact—that is , that consideration s o f what i s possible ca n b e
enough on their own to influence probability, without further
information about how things actually work. This is too diffi -
cult a question to investigate here.10
In general , Berkelia n idealis m differ s fro m sceptica l
phenomenalism i n its attitude toward s spirit an d it s powers.
The ful l version of Berkeley's famous maxim is esse estpercipi
vel percipere: perceiver s exis t a s wel l a s th e perceived . Be -
cause they are not objects of awareness, but agents, spirits and
their activities are not ideas. A full-blown empiricism, there-
fore, tha t say s that onl y ideas ar e intelligibl e has a proble m
with spirit . I n hi s early notebooks Berkele y considere d th e
theory that there are only ideas and, hence, considered what
we thin k o f a s th e Humea n thesi s tha t th e sel f i s onl y a
collection of ideas. Berkeley, however, thought that he could
hold o n to spiri t an d it s powers—acts of understanding and
of will—because , thoug h no t capture d i n ideas , the y ar e
captured b y consciousness . Berkele y woul d hav e rejecte d
Hume's clai m that
when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I  always stumble
upon some particular perception or other ... I never catch myself at
any time withou t a perception, an d never ca n observe anything but
the perception. (Treatise, i . 4. 6)
because there is a conscious experience o f acting, as opposed
to merely undergoing, and o f the endurin g unity of the self .
Berkeley has often been criticized for inconsistency in refus -
ing t o allo w tha t matte r i s intelligible though no t a n idea ,
whilst spirit is allowed, though not an idea. There is no incon-
sistency, however, because he does argu e that consciousnes s
makes spiri t availabl e t o u s i n a  wa y tha t i t canno t mak e
matter: thoug h ther e ar e n o idea s o f spiri t o r it s activities ,
there ar e wha t Berkele y call s 'notions' . I n short , Berkele y

believes tha t experienc e present s u s wit h it s agen t an d hi s
activities, as well as with its objects, though the agen t side of
the divid e is more elusiv e than th e objec t side . As wit h the
issue of a priori probabilities, it is not possible to pursue here
the argument s betwee n Hum e an d Berkeley , whic h remain
live issues. But the Humean has great difficulty explaining the
unity of the self , both through time, and, more crucially, at a
time: what is it that constitutes th e experience d unit y of my
current thoughts , emotions, an d perception s fro m differen t
senses, if not tha t they are al l given to a  single subject? The
difference betwee n idea s floatin g int o th e min d an d con -
trolled though t i s also difficul t t o explai n i f there is no suc h
thing as agency or will.
x. Berkeley's  Influence
In a  sense, Berkeley' s main influence has been just the op -
posite o f wha t h e intended . Instea d o f savin g religio n an d
common sense from atheis m and scepticism, Berkeley is seen
as providing the stepping-ston e fro m Locke' s scientifi c real -
ism to Hume's radical empiricism and scepticism: Hylas' ver-
dict o n Berkeley' s syste m has , fo r th e mos t part , bee n
followed b y history, both in Berkeley's own day, and since .
There are a variety of reasons for this. First, there ar e those ,
such a s Hume , wh o thin k ther e i s a n actua l inconsistenc y
between Berkeley's strict empiricist criterion of meaning and
allowing i n spirit s an d thei r activities . We hav e see n tha t
Berkeley was ready to meet this objection, but it continues to
be used; (for example, by A. D. Lindsay in the introduction to
the old Everyman edition of the Principles and Dialogues). If
one shares this feeling, then Berkeley will merely be clearing
the wa y fo r Hume' s consisten t statemen t o f empiricism .
Second, there was the powerful influence of John Stuart Mill.
Mill described physical objects as 'the permanent possibilitie s
of sensation' and, reasonably, regarded thi s as equivalent to
Berkeley's understandin g of the physical . Mill was the vita l
link betwee n eighteenth-centur y empiricis m an d th e twenti-
eth-century, more positivistic , versions of it (a s represente d
by Bertrand Russell , A. J. Ayer, and the Vienna Circle) and


xxxvi Introduction
his advocacy of Berkeley turned the Anglican bishop into the
officially approve d forerunne r o f modern radica l empiricism
and phenomenalism . I n a  famou s article , Si r Kar l Poppe r
suggests that Berkeley be seen as the precursor of both Ernst
Mach, the proto-logical positivist, and of Albert Einstein, thus
adopting Berkele y int o a  moder n scientifi c empiricis m tha t
was completel y unconcerne d wit h hi s spiritua l objectives .
Third, the ethos of both Christianity and common sens e has
proved resolutel y Johnsonian. Dr Johnson claimed to refut e
Berkeley by kicking a stone to prove that the world was real
and solid, and though no one—probably not even Johnson—
thought thi s a  seriou s argument , i t represent s a  perennia l
feeling about the system, and one that makes it, as a matter of
psychological fact , generall y unbelievable b y those wh o ar e
supposed to find it most congenial. Radical empiricists, on the
other hand , find the mixtur e of reductionis m an d a  hin t of
scepticism extremel y attractive . Fourth, ther e is a matter of
Zeitgeist. The Enlightenment , and th e scientifi c ag e that fol-
lowed it , wer e no t th e tim e fo r a  religiou s metaphysic —
especially a n idealis t one—t o commen d itsel f t o advance d
thinkers. A s a  plai n matte r o f history , therefore , Berkele y
occupied a  plac e i n a  proces s tha t wa s mor e receptiv e o f
certain of his ideas than of others. This is no doub t why th e
more spiritual Berkeleian ethos found an echo in those philo-
sophers wh o wer e reactin g agains t th e Enlightenment ,
namely certai n Hegelia n idealists . Th e Hegelia n tradition ,
represented i n Britain most notabl y by F. H. Bradley , too k
Berkeley's attac k o n matte r a s conclusiv e an d agree d wit h
him that Absolute Mind was in control of the universe. They
did no t conceiv e o f tha t min d a s a n independen t spiritua l
substance, as did Berkeley. It was more like a Humean bundle
composed of all the experiences that make up the total ideal-
ist universe: excep t that , for th e Hegelians , unlik e Hume, a
bundle is more than the sum of its parts, and so has a principle
of unity or identity in its own right, which is lacking in Hume's
conception.
If Berkeley's defence of orthodox religion is to have its day,
that da y ha s no t ye t come . Bu t ther e ar e moder n philo -
sophers, suc h a s Joh n Foste r an d Timoth y Sprigge , wh o

defend idealis t philosophies that owe much to Berkeley. The
processes agains t whic h Berkele y struggled , however , gro w
stronger, an d th e nee d fo r hi s insight s grow s greater , no t
less.11
11 Th e strea m o f philosophica l orthodox y ha s alway s ru n agains t
Berkeley's religious metaphysic, but its influence agains t the current has
not been negligible . C. S. Lewis credits Berkeley with a major role in his
reconversion t o Christianit y an d Cardina l Newma n admitted a  debt t o
him in the development of his own empiricist Catholicism. I suspect that
Berkeley's influenc e i n private religiou s resistance t o th e metaphysica l
mischief o f the Enlightenment i s greater than the secular public consen-
sus reveals.


NOTE O N TH E TEXT S
The Principles was published twice in Berkeley's lifetime; first
in Dublin in 1710 (this is known as A), second i n London i n
1734, togethe r wit h th e Three  Dialogues  (editio n B).  Th e
Three Dialogues  were published thre e times ; 1713 (A), 172 5
(B), 173 4 (C). The text s used her e ar e th e 173 4 versions, as
found i n volume ii of the complet e Works,  edite d b y A . A .
Luce and T. E. Jessop (London, 1948-57) . In the Notes I have
drawn attention to those differences between the editions that
may be of philosophical interest .

THE PREFACE*
What I  here  make  public has,  after  a  long  and  scrupulous
inquiry, seem'd  to  me evidently  true,  and not  unuseful  to  be
known, particularly to those who are tainted with scepticism, or
want a  demonstration  of  the  existence  and  immateriality  of
GOD, or the natural immortality o f the soul Whether  it be so or
no, I am content the reader should impartially  examine.  Since
I do not think  myself  any  farther concerned  for the  success of
what I have written, than as it is agreeable to truth. Bu t t o the
end thi s may no t suffer,  I  make i t my request  that the reader
suspend hi s judgment, till  he has once, at least, read the whole
through with  that  degree of attention  and  thought  which  the
subject matter  shall  seem  to  deserve.  For  as  there  are  some
passages that, taken by themselves, are very liable  (nor could it
be remedied} to  gross misinterpretation, and to be charged with
most absurd consequences, which, nevertheless, upon an entire
perusal will  appear  not  to  follow  from  them:  so  likewise,
though the  whole  should  be  read  over,  yet,  if  this  be  done
transiently, 'tis  very probable my  sense may be mistaken; but to
a thinking  reader,  I flatter  myself,  it  will be throughout  clear
and obvious.  As  for  the  characters of novelty and  singularity,
which some of  the  following notions  may  seem  to  bear, 'tis,  I
hope, needless  to make any  apology on  that account. He must
surely be  either  very  weak,  or  very  little  acquainted with  the
sciences, who  shall  reject  a  truth,  that  is  capable  of  demon-
stration, for no  other reason but because it's newly known and
contrary to  the prejudices of  mankind. Thus much I thought fit
to premise, in  order to prevent, if  possible, the hasty censures of
a sort of men, who  are  too apt to condemn an  opinion before
they rightly  comprehend it.


INTRODUCTION*
1. Philosoph y being nothing else but th e stud y of wisdom
and truth , i t ma y with reason b e expected , tha t thos e wh o
have spent mos t time an d pains in it should enjoy a  greate r
calm and serenit y of mind, a greater clearnes s an d evidenc e
of knowledge, and be less disturbed with doubts and difficult -
ies tha n othe r men . Ye t s o i t i s w e se e th e illiterat e bul k
of mankind that walk the high-road of plain, common sense ,
and ar e governe d b y th e dictate s o f Nature , fo r th e mos t
part eas y an d undisturbed . T o the m nothin g that' s familia r
appears unaccountable or difficult to comprehend. They com-
plain not of any want of evidence in their senses, and are ou t
of al l dange r o f becomin g sceptics.  Bu t n o soone r d o w e
depart from sense and instinct to follow the light of a superior
principle, t o reason , meditate , an d reflec t o n th e natur e of
things, but a  thousand scruple s spring up in our minds, con-
cerning thos e thing s which before w e seeme d full y t o com -
prehend.* Prejudice s an d error s o f sens e d o fro m al l part s
discover themselves to our view; and endeavouring to correct
these by reason w e are insensibly drawn into uncouth para -
doxes, difficulties , an d inconsistences , whic h multipl y an d
grow upo n u s a s w e advanc e i n speculation ; til l a t length ,
having wander'd through many intricate mazes, we find our-
selves just where we were, or, which is worse, sit down in a
forlorn scepticism.
2. Th e cause of this is thought to be the obscurity of things,
or th e natura l weaknes s an d imperfectio n o f ou r under -
standings. It is said the facultie s we have are few, and thos e
designed b y Nature fo r th e suppor t an d comfor t of life, an d
not t o penetrat e int o th e inwar d essenc e an d constitutio n
of things. * Besides , th e min d o f ma n bein g finite , whe n i t
treats of things which partake of infinity, it is not t o be won-
dered at , if it run int o absurditie s and contradictions ; ou t of
which it is impossible it should ever extricate itself, it being of
the nature of infinite not to be comprehended b y that which is
finite.


8 Principles:
 Introduction
3. Bu t perhaps we may be too partial t o ourselves i n pla-
cing the fault originally in our faculties, and not rather in the
wrong use we make of them. It is a hard thing to suppose, that
right deductions from tru e principles should ever end in con-
sequences whic h cannot b e maintaine d or mad e consistent .
We should believe that God has dealt more bountifull y with
the son s o f men, tha n t o giv e them a  strong desire fo r tha t
knowledge, which He had placed quite out of their reach. This
were no t agreeabl e t o th e wonted , indulgen t method s o f
Providence, which, whatever appetites it may have implanted
in the creatures , dot h usuall y furnish the m wit h such means
as, if rightly made use of, will not fail to satisfy them. Upon the
whole, I am inclined t o think that the far greater part, if not
all, o f thos e difficultie s whic h have hithert o amuse d philo -
sophers, an d blocked u p the way to knowledge, are entirely
owing to ourselves. That we have first raised a dust, and then
complain, we cannot see .
4. M y purpose therefor e is , to tr y i f I ca n discove r what
those principles are, which have introduced al l that doubtful-
ness an d uncertainty , thos e absurditie s an d contradiction s
into the several sects of philosophy;* insomuch that the wisest
men hav e thought our ignoranc e incurable , conceiving it to
arise from the natural dulness and limitation of our faculties.
And surel y it is a work well deserving our pains , to mak e a
strict inquiry concerning th e first principles of human know-
ledge, to sif t an d examin e them on al l sides: especially since
there ma y be som e ground s t o suspec t tha t thos e let s an d
difficulties, whic h stay and embarras s th e min d in its search
after truth , do not spring from an y darkness an d intricacy in
the objects, or natural defect in the understanding, so much as
from fals e principles which have been insisted on, and might
have been avoided.
5. Ho w difficul t an d discouraging soever this attempt may
seem, whe n I  conside r ho w man y grea t an d extraordinar y
men have gone before me in the sam e designs: yet I am not
without some hopes, upon th e consideration tha t the largest
views ar e no t alway s the clearest , an d tha t h e who is short-
sighted wil l be oblige d t o dra w the objec t nearer , an d may,
perhaps, by a close and narrow survey discern that which had
escaped fa r better eyes .

6. I n order to prepare the mind of the reader for the easie r
conceiving what follows, it is proper to premise somewhat, by
way o f introduction , concernin g th e natur e an d abus e o f
language. Bu t th e unravellin g this matter lead s m e i n som e
measure t o anticipat e m y design , by takin g notic e o f what
seems to have had a chief part in rendering speculation intri-
cate and perplexed, and to have occasioned innumerabl e er-
rors and difficulties in almost all parts of knowledge. And that
is the opinion that the mind hath a power of framing abstract
ideas or notions of things. He who is not a perfect stranger to
the writing s an d dispute s o f philosophers , mus t need s ac -
knowledge that no small part of them are spent about abstract
ideas. These are in a more especial manner, thought to be the
object o f those science s which go by the nam e o f Logic an d
Metaphysics, and of all that which passes under the notion of
the mos t abstracte d an d sublim e learning, i n al l which on e
shall scarc e fin d an y question handle d in such a manner, as
does not suppose their existence in the mind, and that it is well
acquainted with them.
7. I t is agreed on all hands, that the qualitie s or modes of
things do never really exist each of them apart b y itself, an d
separated fro m al l others , bu t ar e mixed , a s i t were , an d
blended together, several in the same object. But we are told,
the min d bein g abl e t o conside r eac h qualit y singly, o r ab -
stracted fro m thos e othe r qualitie s wit h which i t i s united,
does by that means frame to itself abstract ideas. For example,
there is perceived by sight an object extended, coloured, and
moved: this mixed or compound idea the mind resolving into
its simple, constituent parts, and viewing each by itself, exclu-
sive o f the rest , doe s fram e th e abstrac t idea s o f extension ,
colour, and motion. Not that it is possible for colour or motion
to exist without extension: but only that the mind can frame to
itself by abstraction the ide a of colour exclusive of extension,
and of motion exclusive of both colour an d extension .
8. Again , the min d having observed tha t i n the particular
extensions perceive d b y sense , ther e i s something commo n
and alik e i n all , an d som e othe r thing s peculiar, a s thi s o r
that figur e o r magnitude , which distinguish them on e fro m
another; it considers apart or singles out by itself that which is
common, makin g thereof a  most abstrac t ide a of extension,

which is neither line , surface, nor solid, nor has any figure o r
magnitude but is an idea entirely prescinded from all these. So
likewise th e min d b y leavin g ou t o f th e particula r colour s
perceived b y sense, that whic h distinguishes them on e fro m
another, an d retainin g tha t onl y whic h i s commo n t o all ,
makes a n ide a o f colou r i n abstrac t whic h i s neithe r red ,
nor blue, nor white, nor an y other determinat e colour . An d
in like manner b y considering motio n abstractedl y not onl y
from th e bod y moved , bu t likewis e fro m th e figur e i t de -
scribes, an d al l particular direction s an d velocities , th e ab -
stract idea of motion is framed; which equally corresponds t o
all particular motion s whatsoeve r that ma y be perceive d b y
sense.
9. An d a s the min d frames t o itself abstrac t ideas of qual-
ities o r modes , s o does it , by the sam e precisio n o r menta l
separation, attai n abstrac t idea s o f th e mor e compounde d
beings, whic h includ e severa l coexisten t qualities . Fo r
example, th e min d having observe d tha t Peter , James, an d
John resemble eac h other, in certain common agreements of
shape and other qualities, leaves out of the complex or com-
pounded idea it has of Peter, James, and any other particular
man, tha t whic h is peculiar t o each , retainin g onl y wha t is
common to all; and so makes an abstract idea wherein all the
particulars equally partake, abstracting entirely from and cut-
ting off all those circumstances and differences , whic h might
determine it to any particular existence. And afte r thi s man-
ner i t is said we come by the abstrac t idea of man or , if you
please, humanity or human nature; wherein it is true, there is
included colour, because there is no man but has some colour,
but then it can be neither white, nor black, nor any particular
colour; because ther e is no one particular colour wherein all
men partake. So likewise there is included stature, but then it
is neither tall stature nor low stature, nor yet middle stature,
but somethin g abstracte d fro m al l these. An d s o of the rest .
Moreover, there being a great variety of other creatures that
partake in some parts, but not all, of the complex idea of man,
the mind leaving out those part s which are peculiar to men,
and retaining those onl y which are common t o all the livin g
creatures, frameth the idea of animal, which abstracts not only


Principles: Introduction u
from al l particular men, but als o all birds, beasts, fishes, and
insects. The constituen t part s o f the abstrac t ide a o f animal
are body , life , sense , an d spontaneou s motion . B y body  i s
meant, bod y withou t an y particula r shap e o r figure , ther e
being no one shape or figure common to all animals, without
covering, eithe r o f hai r o r feathers , o r scales , &c . no r ye t
naked: hair, feathers, scales, and nakedness being the distin-
guishing properties o f particular animals, and for that reaso n
left out of the abstract idea. Upon the same account the spon-
taneous motio n mus t b e neithe r walking , no r flying , no r
creeping, it is nevertheless a motion, but what that motion is,
it is not eas y to conceive .
10. Whethe r others have this wonderful faculty of abstract-
ing their  ideas, they bes t ca n tell : for mysel f I  find indeed I
have a  facult y o f imagining , o r representin g t o mysel f th e
ideas of those particular things I have perceived and of vari-
ously compounding and dividing them. I can imagine a man
with two heads or the upper parts of a man joined to the body
of a horse. I can consider the hand, the eye, the nose, each by
itself abstracte d o r separated fro m th e res t o f the body . But
then whateve r han d o r ey e I  imagine , i t mus t hav e som e
particular shape and colour. Likewise the idea of man that I
frame t o myself , mus t be eithe r o f a white, or a  black, or a
tawny, a straight, or a crooked, a  tall, or a low, or a middle-
sized man . I  canno t b y an y effor t o f though t conceiv e th e
abstract idea above described. And it is equally impossible for
me to form the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body
moving, and whic h is neither swif t no r slow , curvilinear no r
rectilinear; an d th e lik e ma y b e sai d o f al l othe r abstrac t
general ideas whatsoever. To be plain, I own myself abl e t o
abstract in one sense, as when I consider some particular parts
or qualities separated from others, with which though they are
united in some object, yet, it is possible they may really exist
without them. But I deny that I can abstract one from another ,
or conceive separately , those qualitie s which it is impossible
should exist so separated; or that I can frame a general notion
by abstractin g fro m particular s i n th e manne r aforesaid .
Which tw o las t ar e th e prope r acceptation s o f abstraction.

themselves to be in my case. The generality of men which are
simple and illiterate never pretend to abstract notions. It's said
they ar e difficul t an d no t t o b e attaine d withou t pain s an d
study. W e ma y therefor e reasonabl y conclud e that , i f such
there be, they are confined only to the learned .
ii. I  proceed to examine what can be alleged in defence of
the doctrine of abstraction, and try if I can discover what it is
that inclines the men of speculation to embrace an opinion, so
remote fro m commo n sense a s that seem s t o be. There has
been a late deservedly esteemed philosopher, who, no doubt,
has given it very much countenance by seeming to think the
having abstrac t genera l idea s i s what puts the wides t differ -
ence i n point o f understanding betwixt man and beast. Th e
having of general ideas (saith he ) is that which puts a perfect
distinction betwixt man and brutes, and is an excellency which
the facultie s o f brutes d o by no mean s attai n unto. For i t is
evident w e observ e n o footstep s i n the m o f makin g us e o f
general signs for universal ideas; from whic h we have reaso n
to imagin e tha t the y hav e no t th e facult y o f abstracting or
making general ideas, since they have no use of words or any
other genera l signs. And a  little after. Therefore , I  think, we
may suppos e tha t i t is in this that th e specie s o f brutes ar e
discriminated fro m men , an d 'ti s tha t prope r differenc e
wherein they are wholly separated, and which at last widens to
so wide a distance. For i f they have any ideas at all, and ar e
not bar e machine s (a s som e woul d hav e them ) w e canno t
deny them to have some reason. It seems as evident to me that
they do some of them in certain instances reason as that they
have sense , bu t i t i s onl y i n particula r ideas , jus t a s the y
receive them from their senses. They are the best of them tied
up within those narrow bounds, and have not (as I think) the
faculty to enlarge them by any kind of abstraction.' Essay on
Hum. Underst.,  b. 2. c. 11. sects. 10 and n. I readily agree with
this learne d author , tha t th e facultie s o f brute s ca n b y n o
means attai n t o abstraction.  Bu t the n i f thi s b e mad e th e
distinguishing property o f that sort of animals, I fear a  great
many of those that pass for men must be reckoned int o their
number. Th e reaso n tha t i s here assigne d wh y we have n o
grounds to think brutes have abstract general ideas, is that we


Principles: Introduction 1

observe i n them n o use of words or any other genera l signs;
which is built on this supposition, to wit, that the making use
of words , implie s th e havin g genera l ideas . Fro m whic h i t
follows, tha t me n wh o use languag e are abl e t o abstrac t o r
generalize their ideas. That this is the sense and arguing of the
author will further appear by his answering the question he in
another place puts. 'Since all things that exist are only particu-
lars, how come we by general terms?' His answer is, 'Words
become genera l b y bein g made th e sign s of general ideas. '
Essay o n Hum. Underst.,  b. 3. c. 3. sect. 6. But it seems that a
word become s genera l b y bein g mad e th e sign , no t o f a n
abstract general idea but, of several particular ideas, any one
of whic h it indifferently suggest s to th e mind . For example ,
when i t i s sai d th e change  o f motion  i s proportional t o th e
impressed force,  o r tha t whatever  has extension  i s divisible',
these propositions are to be understood o f motion and exten-
sion i n general, and nevertheles s i t will not follo w tha t they
suggest t o m y thought s a n ide a o f motio n withou t a  bod y
moved, or an y determinate directio n an d velocity , or tha t I
must conceive an abstract general idea of extension, which is
neither line, surface nor solid, neither great nor small, black,
white, nor red, nor of any other determinate colour. It is only
implied that whatever motion I  consider, whether it be swif t
or slow, perpendicular, horizontal or oblique, or in whatever
object, the axiom concerning it holds equally true. As does the
other o f ever y particula r extension , i t matter s no t whethe r
line, surfac e or solid , whether o f thi s o r tha t magnitud e o r
figure.
12. B y observing how idea s become general , we may th e
better judg e ho w words ar e mad e so . And her e i t i s to b e
noted tha t I  do not deny absolutely there ar e general ideas ,
but onl y that there are an y abstract general ideas: for in th e
passages above quoted, wherei n ther e is mention o f general
ideas, it is always supposed tha t they are formed by abstrac-
tion, after the manner set forth in sects. 8 and 9. Now if we will
annex a meaning to our words, and speak only of what we can
conceive, I believe we shall acknowledge, that an idea, which
considered i n itself is particular, becomes general , b y bein g
made to represent o r stand for all other particular ideas of the

same sort. To make this plain by an example, suppose a geom-
etrician is demonstrating the method, of cutting a line in two
equal parts. He draws , for instance, a black line of an inch in
length, this which i n itself i s a particular line is nevertheless
with regard to its signification general, since as it is there used,
it represents al l particular lines whatsoever; for tha t wha t is
demonstrated o f it, i s demonstrated o f al l lines or , i n othe r
words, o f a  lin e i n general . An d a s tha t particula r lin e be -
comes general, by being made a sign, so the name line which
taken absolutely is particular, by being a sign is made general.
And as the former owes its generality, not to its being the sign
of an abstract o r general line , but o f all particular righ t line s
that may possibly exist, so the latter must be thought to derive
its generality from th e sam e cause, namely, the variou s par-
ticular lines which it indifferently denotes .
13. T o giv e the reade r a  yet cleare r vie w of the natur e of
abstract ideas , and the uses they are thought necessar y to, I
shall add one more passage out o f the Essay  on Human Un -
derstanding, whic h i s a s follows . 'Abstract  ideas  ar e no t s o
obvious o r eas y t o childre n or th e ye t unexercise d min d as
particular ones . I f the y see m s o t o grow n men , i t i s only
because b y constant an d familia r us e they are made so . For
when we nicely reflect upon them, we shall find that general
ideas ar e fiction s an d contrivance s o f th e mind , that carr y
difficulty wit h them, and do not s o easily offer themselves , as
we are apt to imagine. For example, does it not require some
pains and skill to form the general idea of a triangle (which is
yet none of the most abstract comprehensive and difficult) fo r
it must be neither obliqu e nor rectangle, neither equilateral ,
equicrural, nor scalenon, but all and none of these at once. In
effect, i t i s somethin g imperfec t tha t canno t exist , a n ide a
wherein some parts of several different an d inconsistent ideas
are put together. It is true the mind in this imperfect state has
need of such ideas, and makes all the haste to them it can, for
the convenienc y o f communicatio n an d enlargemen t o f
knowledge, to both whic h it is naturally very much inclined.
But yet one has reason to suspect such ideas are marks of our
imperfection. A t leas t thi s is enough t o she w tha t th e mos t
abstract and general ideas are not those that the mind is first

has the faculty of framing in his mind such an idea of a triangle
as is here described, it is in vain to pretend t o dispute him out
of it, nor would I go about it . All I desire is, that the reade r
would fully an d certainly inform himself whether he has such
an idea* or no. And this , methinks, can be no hard tas k for
anyone to perform. What more easy than for anyone to look
a little into his own thoughts, and there try whether he has, or
can attai n t o have , a n ide a tha t shal l correspon d wit h th e
description that is here given of the general idea of a triangle,
which is, neither oblique, nor rectangle, equilateral, equicrural,
nor scalenon, but all and none of these at once!
14. Muc h i s here sai d o f th e difficult y tha t abstrac t idea s
carry with them, and the pains and skill requisite t o the form-
ing them. And i t is on all hands agreed tha t there i s need of
great toil and labour of the mind, to emancipate our thoughts
from particula r objects , an d rais e the m t o thos e sublim e
speculations tha t ar e conversant abou t abstrac t ideas . Fro m
all which the natural consequence shoul d seem to be, that so
difficult a  thing as the forming abstract ideas was not necess -
ary fo r communication,  which is so eas y an d familia r t o al l
sorts of men. But we are told, if they seem obvious and easy to
grown men, It is only because by constant and familiar use they
are made so. Now I would fain know at what time it is, men are
employed in surmounting that difficulty, and furnishing them-
selves with those necessary helps for discourse. It cannot b e
when they are grown up, for then it seems they are not con -
scious of any such pains-taking; i
t remains therefore to be the
business of their childhood. And surely , the great and multi-
plied labour of framing abstract notions, will be found a hard
task for that tender age. Is it not a hard thing to imagine, that
a coupl e o f childre n canno t prat e together , o f thei r sugar -
plumbs and rattles and the rest of their little trinkets, till they
have first tacked together numberless inconsistencies, an d so
framed i n thei r mind s abstract  general ideas,  an d annexe d
them to every common nam e they make use of?

a point , muc h insiste d on , tha t al l knowledg e an d demon -
stration are about universal notions, to which I fully agree: but
then it doth not appear to me that those notions are formed by
abstraction in the manne r premised ; universality,  s o far a s I
can comprehen d no t consistin g i n th e absolute , positiv e
nature or conception o f anything, but in the relation it bears
to th e particular s signifie d o r represente d b y it : b y virtu e
whereof it is that things, names, or notions, being in their own
nature particular, are rendered universal.  Thus when I dem-
onstrate an y proposition concernin g triangles, it is to be sup-
posed tha t I  have i n view the universa l idea o f a triangle; *
which ought not to be understood as if I could frame a n idea
of a  triangle which was neither equilateral no r scaleno n no r
equicrural. Bu t onl y that th e particula r triangl e I  consider ,
whether of this or that sort it matters not, doth equally stand
for and represent all rectilinear triangles whatsoever, and is in
that sens e universal.  All which seems ver y plain and no t t o
include any difficulty i n it.
16. Bu t her e it wil l b e demanded , how we can kno w any
proposition t o b e tru e o f al l particular triangles, except w e
have firs t see n i t demonstrate d o f th e abstrac t ide a o f a
triangle which equally agrees to all ? For because a  property
may b e demonstrate d t o agre e t o som e on e particula r tri -
angle, it will not thenc e follow that it equally belongs to any
other triangle, which in all respects is not the same with it. For
example, havin g demonstrated tha t th e thre e angle s o f a n
isosceles rectangula r triangl e ar e equa l t o tw o right ones , I
cannot therefor e conclud e thi s affectio n agree s t o al l other
triangles, whic h hav e neithe r a  righ t angle , nor tw o equa l
sides. It seems therefore that, to be certain this proposition is
universally true , w e must either mak e a  particula r demon -
stration for every particular triangle, which is impossible, or
once for all demonstrate it of the abstract  idea of a triangle, in
which al l th e particular s d o indifferentl y partake , an d b y
which the y are al l equally represented. To whic h I answer,
that though the idea I have in view whilst I make the demon-
stration, be , fo r instance , tha t o f a n isoscele s rectangula r
triangle, whose sides are of a determinate length, I may nev-
ertheless be certain it extends to all other rectilinear triangles,


Principles: Introduction 1

of wha t sor t o r bignes s soever . An d that , becaus e neithe r
the right angle, nor the equality, nor determinate length of the
sides, are at all concerned i n the demonstration. It is true, the
diagram I have in view includes all these particulars, but then
there is not the least mention made of them in the proof of the
proposition. It is not said , the thre e angle s are equal to two
right ones, because one of them is a right angle, or because the
sides comprehending i t are o f the sam e length . Which suffi -
ciently shew s that th e righ t angl e might have bee n oblique ,
and the sides unequal, and for all that the demonstration have
held good. And for this reason it is, that I conclude that to be
true o f any obliquangular o r scalenon , whic h I had demon -
strated o f a  particular right-angled, equicrural triangle; and
not becaus e I  demonstrate d th e propositio n o f the abstrac t
idea of a triangle. And her e it must be acknowledge d that a
man ma y consider a  figure merely a s triangular, without at -
tending to the particular qualities of the angles, or relations of
the sides . S o far h e ma y abstract : but thi s will never prove,
that h e ca n frame a n abstract genera l inconsisten t ide a o f a
triangle. In lik e manner w e may consider Pete r s o far fort h
as man , o r s o fa r fort h a s animal , withou t framin g th e
forementioned abstract idea, either of man or of animal, in as
much as all that is perceived i s not considered .
17. I t were an endless, as well as an useless thing, to trac e
the Schoolmen, those great masters of abstraction, through all
the manifol d inextricabl e labyrinth s o f erro r an d dispute ,
which their doctrine of abstract natures and notions seems to
have led them into . What bickering s an d controversies, an d
what a learned dust have been raised about those matters, and
what might y advantag e hat h bee n fro m thenc e derive d t o
mankind, ar e thing s a t thi s da y too clearl y know n t o nee d
being insisted on. And i t had been well if the ill effects of that
doctrine wer e confine d t o thos e onl y wh o mak e th e mos t
avowed profession of it. When men consider th e great pains,

supported by the most clear and cogent demonstrations, con-
tain in them paradoxes whic h are perfectly irreconcilable t o
the understanding s o f men , an d tha t takin g al l together , a
small portion o f them dot h suppl y any real benefit to man -
kind, otherwis e tha n b y bein g a n innocen t diversio n an d
amusement. I say, the consideration of all this is apt to throw
them into a despondency, an d perfect contempt o f all study.
But this may perhaps cease, upon a view of the false principles
that hav e obtained i n the world , amongst al l which there is
none, methinks, hath a more wide influence over the thoughts
of speculative men, than this of abstract general ideas.
18. I  com e no w t o conside r th e sourc e o f thi s prevailing
notion, an d tha t seem s t o m e t o b e language . And surel y
nothing o f less extent than reason itsel f could have been th e
source of an opinion so universally received. The truth of this
appears a s from othe r reasons , s o als o fro m th e plai n con -
fession o f the ables t patrons o f abstract ideas, who acknow-
ledge that they are made in order to naming; from which it is
a clear consequence, tha t if there ha d been no such thing as
speech or universal signs, there never had been any thought of
abstraction. See b. 3. c. 6. sect. 39 and elsewhere of The Essay
on Human Understanding. Let us therefore examine the man-
ner wherei n word s hav e contribute d t o th e origi n o f tha t
mistake. Firs t then , 'ti s though t tha t ever y nam e hath , o r
ought t o have , on e onl y precis e an d settle d signification ,
which inclines men to think there are certain abstract, determi-
nate ideas, which constitute the true and only immediate signi-
fication of each general name. And that it is by the mediatio n
of these abstract ideas, that a  general name comes to signif y
any particular thing. Whereas, in truth, there is no such thing
as one precise an d definite signification annexed t o any gen-
eral name, they all signifying indifferentl y a  great number of
particular ideas . All which doth evidentl y follow fro m wha t
has been already said, and will clearly appear to anyone by a
little reflexion. To this it will be objected, that every name that
has a definition, is thereby restrained t o one certain significa -
tion. For example , a triangle is defined to be a  plane surface
comprehended b y three  right  lines',  b y whic h tha t nam e i s
limited to denote on e certain ide a and no other. To which I


Principles: Introduction 1

answer, that in the definition it is not said whether the surface
be grea t o r small, black o r white, nor whethe r th e side s are
long or short, equal or unequal, nor with what angles they are
inclined to each other; in all which there may be great variety,
and consequently there is no one settled idea which limits the
signification o f the word triangle. Tis one thing for to keep a
name constantly to the same definition, and another to make
it stand everywher e for the sam e idea: the on e i s necessary,
the other useles s and impracticable.*
19. Bu t to give a farther account how words came to pro -
duce the doctrine of abstract ideas, it must be observed that it
is a received opinion , that language has no other end but the
communicating ou r ideas , an d tha t ever y significan t nam e
stands for an idea. This being so, and it being withal certain,
that names, which yet are not thought altogether insignificant,
do no t alway s mark ou t particula r conceivabl e ideas , i t i s
straightway conclude d tha t the y stan d fo r abstrac t notions .
That there ar e many names in use amongst speculative men,
which do not always suggest to others determinate particular
ideas, i s what nobody wil l deny . And a  littl e attentio n wil l
discover, that it is not necessary (even in the strictest reason-
ings) significan t name s whic h stan d fo r idea s should , ever y
time they are used, excite in the understanding the ideas they
are mad e t o stan d for : i n readin g an d discoursing , name s
being for the most part used as letters are in algebra, in which
though a particular quantity be marked by each letter, yet to
proceed righ t it is not requisit e that in every step each lette r
suggest t o your thoughts , that particula r quantit y it was ap-
pointed to stand for.
20. Besides , the communicating of ideas marked by words
is not th e chie f an d onl y en d o f language,* a s is commonly
supposed. Ther e ar e othe r ends , a s th e raisin g o f som e
passion, th e excitin g to , o r deterrin g fro m a n action , th e
putting the mind in some particular disposition; to which the
former i s in man y case s barel y subservient , an d sometime s
entirely omitted, when these can be obtained withou t it, as I
think dot h no t infrequentl y happen i n th e familia r us e o f
language. I entreat the reader to reflect with himself, and see
if i t dot h no t ofte n happe n eithe r i n hearin g o r readin g a

discourse, that the passions of fear, love, hatred, admiration,
disdain, and the like arise, immediately in his mind upon th e
perception o f certai n words , without an y idea s comin g be -
tween. At first, indeed, the words might have occasioned idea s
that were fit to produce those emotions; but, if I mistake not,
it will be found that when language is once grown familiar, the
hearing of the sounds or sight of the characters is oft immedi-
ately attended with those passions, which at first were wont to
be produced b y the intervention of ideas, that are now quite
omitted. May we not, for example, be affected with the prom-
ise of a good thing, though we have not an  idea of what it is?
Or is not the being threatened with danger sufficient t o excite
a dread, though we think not o f any particular evil likely to
befall us , no r ye t fram e t o ourselve s a n ide a o f dange r i n
abstract? I f anyon e shal l join eve r s o littl e reflectio n of his
own to what has been said, I believe it will evidently appear to
him, tha t genera l name s ar e ofte n use d i n th e propriet y of
language without the speaker' s designin g them for marks of
ideas in his own, which he would have them raise in the mind
of th e hearer . Eve n prope r name s themselve s d o no t see m
always spoken, with a design to bring into our view the ideas
of those individuals that are supposed to be marked by them.
For example, when a Schoolman tells me Aristotle hath said it,
all I conceive he means by it, is to dispose me to embrace his
opinion with the deference and submission which custom has
annexed t o tha t name . An d thi s effec t ma y be s o instantly
produced in the minds of those who are accustomed to resign
their judgment t o th e authorit y o f that philosopher , a s it is
impossible an y idea either o f his person, writings, or reputa-

words are of excellent use, in that by their means all that stock
of knowledge which has been purchased by the joint labours
of inquisitive men in all ages and nations, may be drawn into
the view and made the possession of one single person. But at
the same time it must be owned that most parts of knowledge
have been strangely perplexed an d darkened by the abuse of
words, and general ways of speech wherein they are delivered.
Since therefore words are so apt to impose on the understand-
ing, whatever ideas I consider, I shall endeavour to take them
bare and naked into my view, keeping out of my thoughts, so
far a s I a m able , thos e name s whic h long an d constan t us e
hath so strictly united with them; from whic h I may expect to
derive the following advantages.
22. First , I  shal l b e sur e t o ge t clea r o f al l controversie s
purely verbal; the springin g up o f which weeds in almost all
the sciences has been a main hindrance to the growth of true
and sound knowledge. Secondly, this seems to be a sure way
to extricate myself out o f that fine and subtle net o f abstract
ideas, whic h ha s s o miserably perplexed an d entangle d th e
minds of men, and that with this peculiar circumstance , that
by how much the finer and more curiou s was the wi t of any
man, by so much the deeper wa s he like to be ensnared, and
faster held therein. Thirdly, so long as I confine my thoughts
to m y own ideas divested o f words, I do no t se e how I can
easily be mistaken. The object s I consider, I  clearly and ad-
equately know . I canno t b e deceive d i n thinking I hav e a n
idea which I have not. It is not possible for me to imagine, that
any of my own ideas are alike or unlike, that are not truly so.
To discer n th e agreement s o r disagreement s there ar e be -
tween my ideas, to se e what ideas ar e include d in any com-
pound idea , an d wha t not , ther e i s nothing mor e requisite ,
than a n attentiv e perceptio n o f wha t passe s i n m y ow n
understanding.
23. Bu t the attainment of all these advantages doth presup-
pose an entire deliverance from the deception of words, which
I dare hardl y promise myself ; so difficul t a  thing it is to dis-
solve a n unio n s o early begun, an d confirme d by s o long a
habit as that betwixt words and ideas. Which difficulty seem s
to have been very much increased by the doctrine of abstrac-

tion. For so long as men thought abstract ideas were annexed
to their words, it doth not seem strange that they should use
words for ideas: it being found a n impracticable thing to lay
aside the word, and retain the abstract idea in the mind, which
in itsel f wa s perfectly inconceivable . This seem s t o m e th e
principal cause , wh y thos e me n wh o hav e s o emphaticall y
recommended t o others, the layin g aside al l use of words in
their meditations , an d contemplatin g thei r bar e ideas , have
yet failed t o perform it themselves. O f late many have been
very sensible of the absurd opinions and insignificant disputes,
which gro w ou t o f th e abus e o f words. * An d i n orde r t o
remedy thes e evil s the y advis e well , tha t w e atten d t o th e
ideas signified , an d dra w of f ou r attentio n fro m th e word s
which signify them. But how good soever this advice may be,
they have given others, it is plain they could not have a due
regard t o i t themselves , s o lon g a s the y though t th e onl y
immediate us e o f word s wa s t o signif y ideas , an d tha t th e
immediate signification of every general name was a determi-
nate, abstract idea.
24. Bu t these being known to be mistakes, a man may with
greater ease prevent his being imposed on by words. He that
knows he has no other tha n particular ideas, will not puzzle
himself i n vai n t o fin d ou t an d conceiv e th e abstrac t idea ,
annexed t o an y name . An d h e tha t know s name s d o no t
always stand for ideas, will spare himself the labour of looking
for ideas, where there are none to be had. It were therefore to
be wished that everyone would use his utmost endeavours, to
obtain a clear view of the ideas he would consider, separating
from the m all that dress and encumbrance of words which so
much contribute t o blind the judgment and divide the atten-
tion. In vain do we extend our view into the heavens, and pry
into the entrails of the earth, in vain do we consult the writings
of learned men, and trace the dark footsteps of antiquity; we
need only draw the curtain of words, to behold the fairest tree
of knowledge, whose fruit is excellent, and within the reach of
our hand.
25. Unles s w e tak e car e t o clea r th e firs t principle s o f
knowledge, from the embarras and delusion of words, we may
make infinit e reasoning s upo n the m t o no purpose; w e may

wiser. Th e farthe r w e go , w e shal l onl y los e ourselve s th e
more irrecoverably , an d be the deeper entangled in difficul -
ties an d mistakes . Whoeve r therefor e design s t o rea d th e
following sheets, I entreat him to make my words the occasion
of his own thinking, and endeavour to attain the same train of
thoughts in reading, that I had in writing them. By this means
it will be easy for him to discover the truth or falsity o f what
I say. He wil l be ou t o f all danger o f being deceived b y my
words, and I  do not se e how he can be led into an error b y
considering his own naked, undisguised ideas.


OF TH E PRINCIPLE S O F
HUMAN KNOWLEDG E
PART I *
1. I t is evident to anyone who takes a survey of the objects
of human knowledge, that they are eithe r idea s actuall y im-
printed on the senses, or else such as are perceived by attend-
ing to the passions and operations of the mind,* or lastly ideas
formed b y hel p o f memor y an d imagination , eithe r com -
pounding, dividing , o r barel y representin g thos e originall y
perceived i n th e aforesai d ways . By sigh t I  hav e th e idea s
of light and colours with their several degrees and variations.
By touch I perceive, for example, hard and soft, heat and cold,
motion an d resistance , an d o f all these mor e an d les s eithe r
as to quantity or degree. Smelling furnishes me with odours;
the palate with tastes, and hearing conveys sounds to the mind
in al l their variet y o f tone and composition . An d a s several
of thes e ar e observe d t o accompan y each other , the y com e
to be marked by one name, and so to be reputed as one thing.
Thus, fo r example , a certain colour, taste , smell, figure and
consistence havin g bee n observe d t o g o together , ar e ac -
counted one distinct thing, signified by the name apple. Othe r
collections o f idea s constitut e a  stone , a  tree , a  book , an d
the lik e sensibl e things ; which, a s they ar e pleasin g o r dis -
agreeable, excite the passions of love, hatred, joy, grief, an d
so forth.
2. Bu t beside s al l that endles s variet y of ideas o r object s
of knowledge , there i s likewise somethin g whic h knows o r
perceives them , an d exercise s diver s operations , a s willing,
imagining, remembering abou t them . This perceiving, active
being is what I call mind, spirit, soul or myself. B y which words
I d o no t denot e an y on e o f m y ideas , bu t a  thin g entirely
distinct from them , wherein they exist, or, which is the sam e
thing, whereby they are perceived; for the existence of an idea
consists in being perceived.


Principles: Part I 2

3. Tha t neithe r ou r thoughts , no r passions , no r idea s
formed b y the imagination , exist withou t the mind , is what
everybody wil l allow. And i t seems n o les s evident tha t th e
various sensations or ideas imprinted on the sense , however
blended o r combined together (tha t is, whatever objects they
compose) canno t exis t otherwise than i n a  min d perceiving
them. I think an intuitive knowledge may be obtained o f this,
by anyone that shall attend to what is meant by the term exist
when applie d t o sensible things. The tabl e I  write on, I say,
exists, that is, I see and fee l it; and if I were out o f my study
I shoul d sa y it existed, meaning thereby tha t i f I was in my
study I  might perceive it , or tha t som e othe r spiri t actually
does perceive it. There was an odour, that is, it was smelled;
there wa s a  sound , tha t i s to say , it was heard; a  colour o r
figure, and it was perceived by sight or touch. This is all that I
can understand b y these an d the lik e expressions . For a s to
what i s sai d o f th e absolut e existenc e o f unthinkin g things
without any relation to their being perceived, that seems per-
fectly unintelligible. Their esse ispercipi, nor is it possible they
should have any existence, out of the minds or thinking things
which perceive them .
4. I t i s indee d a n opinio n strangel y prevailin g amongs t
men, that houses, mountains, rivers, and in a word all sensible
objects have an existence natural or real, distinct from thei r
being perceived by the understanding. But with how great an
assurance and acquiescence soeve r this principle may be en-
tertained i n the world; yet whoever shall find in his heart t o
call it in question, may, if I mistake not, perceive it to involve
a manifes t contradiction . Fo r wha t ar e th e forementione d
objects but th e things we perceive by sense, an d what do we
perceive beside s ou r ow n idea s o r sensations ; an d i s it no t
plainly repugnant tha t an y one o f these or an y combination
of them should exist unperceived?
5. I f we throughly examin e this tenet, it will, perhaps, b e
found a t bottom t o depend o n the doctrin e of abstract ideas.
For ca n there be a nicer strai n of abstraction tha n t o distin-
guish the existenc e o f sensible object s fro m thei r bein g per-
ceived, s o a s to conceiv e the m existin g unperceived? Ligh t
and colours, heat an d cold, extension an d figures, in a word


26 Principles:
 Part I
the things we see and feel, what are they but so many sensa-
tions, notions , idea s o r impression s o n th e sense ; an d i s it
possible to separate, even in thought, any of these fro m per -
ception? Fo r m y part I  migh t a s easily divide a thing fro m
itself. I may indeed divid e in my thoughts or conceive apar t
from eac h othe r thos e thing s which , perhaps, I  neve r per -
ceived b y sens e s o divided . Thus I  imagin e th e trun k o f a
human body without the limbs, or conceive the smell of rose
without thinking on the rose itself. So far I will not deny I can
abstract, i f tha t ma y properl y b e calle d abstraction,  whic h
extends onl y to th e conceivin g separately suc h objects, as it
is possible ma y really exist or be actually perceived asunder .
But m y conceiving or imagining power doe s not exten d be -
yond the possibility of real existence or perception. Hence as
it is impossible for me to see or feel anything without an actual
sensation of that thing, so is it impossible for me to conceiv e
in my thoughts any sensible thing or object distinct from th e
sensation or perception o f it.*
6. Som e truths there are so near and obvious to the mind,
that a man need only open his eyes to see them. Such I take
this important one to be, to wit, that all the choi r o f heaven
and furnitur e o f the earth , in a word al l those bodie s which
compose the mighty frame of the world, have not any subsist-
ence withou t a  mind, that thei r bein g i s to b e perceive d o r
known; tha t consequentl y s o lon g a s the y ar e no t actuall y
perceived b y me, or d o not exis t in my mind or tha t o f any
other created spirit , they must either have no existence at all,
or els e subsis t i n th e min d o f som e eterna l spirit : i t bein g
perfectly unintelligibl e and involvin g all the absurdit y of ab-
straction, to attribute to any single part of them an existence
independent o f a spirit. To be convinced of which, the reade r
need onl y reflect an d try to separate i n his own thoughts the
being of a sensible thing from it s being perceived.*
7. Fro m wha t ha s bee n said , i t follows , ther e i s not an y
other substanc e tha n spirit, o r that whic h perceives. But for
the fuller proof of this point, let it be considered, the sensible
qualities are colour, figure, motion, smell, taste, and such like,
that is, the ideas perceived by sense. Now for an idea to exist
in a n unperceivin g thing, is a manifes t contradiction ; fo r t o


Principles: Part I 2

have an idea is all one as to perceive: that therefore wherein
colour, figure, and the like qualities exist, must perceive them;
hence i t i s clea r ther e ca n b e n o unthinkin g substanc e o r
substratum o f those ideas.*
8. Bu t sa y you, though th e idea s themselves do no t exis t
without the mind, yet there may be things like them whereof
they ar e copie s o r resemblances , whic h things exist without
the mind, in an unthinking substance. I answer, an idea can be
like nothing but an idea;* a colour or figure can be like noth-
ing but anothe r colour or figure. I f we look but eve r so little
into ou r thoughts , we shall find it impossible fo r u s to con -
ceive a likeness except onl y between our ideas . Again, I ask
whether those supposed originals or external things, of which
our ideas ar e the pictures or representations, b e themselves
perceivable o r no ? I f they are , the n the y ar e ideas , an d we
have gained our point; but if you say they are not, I appeal to
anyone whether i t be sense , t o asser t a  colour i s like some -
thing which is invisible; hard or soft , lik e something which is
intangible; and so of the rest .
9. Som e there are* who make a distinction betwixt primary
and secondary qualities: by the former, they mean extension ,
figure motion, rest, solidity or impenetrability and number: by
the latter they denote all other sensible qualities, as colours,
sounds, tastes, and so forth. The ideas we have of these they
acknowledge not to be the resemblances of anything existin
g
without the mind or unperceived; but they will have our ideas
of th e primar y qualitie s t o b e pattern s o r image s o f things
which exis t withou t th e mind , i n a n unthinkin g substanc e
which they call matter. By matter therefor e we are to under-
stand an inert, senseless substance, in which extension, figure,
and motion, do actually subsist. But it is evident from what we
have alread y shewn , tha t extension , figure and motio n ar e
only ideas existin g in the mind, and that a n idea ca n be like
nothing but another idea, and that consequently neither they
nor thei r archetypes ca n exist in an unperceiving substance .
Hence it is plain, that the very notion of what is called matter
or corporeal substance, involves a contradiction in it.
10. The y who assert that figure, motion, and the rest of the
primary o r origina l qualities d o exis t withou t th e mind , in


28 Principles:
 Part I
unthinking substances , d o a t th e sam e tim e acknowledg e
that colours, sounds, heat, cold, and such like secondary quali-
ties, do not, which they tell us are sensation s existin g in the
mind alone, that depend on and are occasioned by the differ -
ent size, texture and motion of the minute particles of matter.
This they take for an undoubted truth, which they can demon-
strate beyond al l exception. Now i f it be certain , that thos e
original qualities are inseparably united wit h the other sens -
ible qualities , an d not , even  i n thought , capabl e o f bein g
abstracted fro m them , it plainly follows tha t the y exist only
in the mind. But I  desire anyon e to reflec t an d try, whether
he can by any abstraction o f thought, conceive the extensio n
and motio n o f a  body , withou t al l othe r sensibl e qualities .
For m y own part, I  see evidently that i t is not i n my power
to frame a n idea o f a body extended an d moved, but I  must
withal giv e i t som e colou r o r othe r sensibl e qualit y which
is acknowledge d t o exis t onl y in th e mind . I n short , exten -
sion, figure, an d motion , abstracted fro m al l other qualities ,
are inconceivable.* Where therefore the other sensible quali-
ties are , ther e mus t thes e b e also , t o wit , in th e min d an d
nowhere else .
ii. Again , great  an d small,  swift  an d slow*  ar e allowed
to exis t nowher e withou t th e mind , bein g entirel y relative ,
and changing as the fram e o r position of the organ s of sense
varies. The extension therefore which exists without the mind,
is neither great nor small , the motion neither swif t no r slow,
that is, they are nothing at all. But say you, they are extension
in general , an d motio n i n general : thu s w e se e ho w muc h
the tene t o f extended, moveable substance s existing without
the mind, depends on that strange doctrine of abstract ideas.
And her e I  canno t bu t remark , ho w nearly th e vagu e and
indeterminate descriptio n o f matter o r corporea l substance ,
which th e moder n philosopher s ar e ru n int o b y thei r ow n
principles, resemble s tha t antiquate d an d s o much ridicule d
notion o f materia  prima* t o b e me t wit h i n Aristotl e an d
his followers. Without extension solidity cannot be conceived;
since therefor e it ha s been shew n tha t extensio n exist s no t
in a n unthinkin g substance , th e sam e mus t als o b e tru e
of solidity.

12. Tha t number is entirely the creature of the mind, even
though th e othe r qualitie s be allowe d t o exis t without , will
be eviden t to whoeve r considers, that th e sam e thin g bear s
a different denominatio n of number, as the mind views it with
different respects. * Thus, the same extension is one or three
or thirty six, according as the mind considers it with reference
to a  yard, a foot , o r a n inch . Number i s so visibly relative,
and dependen t o n men' s understanding , tha t i t i s strang e
to thin k ho w anyon e shoul d giv e i t a n absolut e existenc e
without the mind . We say one book, on e page, one line ; all
these ar e equall y units, though som e contai n severa l o f th e
others. An d i n eac h instanc e i t i s plain, th e uni t relate s t o
some particular combination of ideas arbitrarily put togethe r
by the mind.
13. Unit y I know some will have to be a simple or uncom-
pounded idea , accompanying all other idea s into the mind. *
That I have any such idea answering the word unity, I do not
find; and i f I had , methink s I  coul d no t mis s findin g it ; on
the contrary it should be the most familiar to my understand-
ing, since it is said to accompany all other ideas, and to be per-
ceived b y all the way s of sensation an d reflexion . T o sa y no
more, it is an abstract idea.
14. I  shall farther add, that after the same manner, as mod-
ern philosophers prov e certai n sensibl e qualitie s to have no
existence in matter, or without the mind, the same thing may
be likewise proved of all other sensible qualities whatsoever.
Thus, for instance, it is said that heat an d cold are affection s
only of the mind, and not at all patterns of real beings, existing
in th e corporea l substance s whic h excite them , for tha t th e
same body which appears col d to on e hand, seems warm to
another. No w why may we not a s well argue that figure and
extension ar e not patterns or resemblances o f qualities exist-
ing in matter, because to the same eye at different stations , or
eyes of a differen t textur e a t th e sam e station , the y appea r
various, an d canno t therefor e b e th e image s o f anythin g
settled and determinate without the mind? Again, it is proved
that sweetnes s i s not reall y in th e sapi d thing , because th e
thing remaining unaltered th e sweetnes s is changed into bit-
ter, as in case of a fever or otherwise vitiated palate. Is it not


30 Principles:
 Part I
as reasonabl e t o say , that motio n i s not withou t the mind ,
since if the succession of ideas in the mind become swifter, th e
motion, i t is acknowledged, shall appear slowe r without any
alteration in any external object.
15. I n short , le t anyon e conside r thos e arguments , which
are thought manifestly to prove that colours an d tastes exist
only in the mind, and he shall find they may with equal force,
be brought to prove the same thing of extension, figure, and
motion. Though it must be confessed this method o f arguing
doth not so much prove that there is no extension or colour in
an outward object, as that we do not know by sense which is
the true extension or colour of the object.* But the arguments
foregoing plainly shew it to be impossible that any colour or
extension at all, or other sensibl e quality whatsoever, should
exist in an unthinking subject without the mind , or in truth,
that there shoul d be any such thing as an outward object.
16. Bu t le t u s examin e a  little th e receive d opinion . I t is
said* extensio n i s a  mod e o r acciden t o f matter , an d tha t
matter i s the substratum  tha t support s it. Now I desire tha t
you woul d explai n wha t i s mean t b y matter' s supporting
extension: sa y you, I have n o ide a o f matter, an d therefor e
cannot explai n it. I answer, though you have no positive, yet
if yo u hav e an y meanin g a t all , yo u mus t a t leas t hav e a
relative idea o f matter; though you know not wha t it is, yet
you must be supposed to know what relation it bears to acci-
dents, and what is meant by its supporting them. It is evident
support canno t here be taken i n its usual or literal sense , as
when w e sa y tha t pillar s support a  building : i n wha t sens e
therefore must it be taken?
17. I f we inquire into what the most accurate philosopher s
declare themselve s t o mea n b y material substance', we shall
find them acknowledge, they have no other meaning annexed
to thos e sounds , but th e ide a o f being i n general , togethe r
with the relative notion o f its supporting accidents. The gen-
eral ide a o f bein g appearet h t o m e th e mos t abstrac t an d
incomprehensible o f all other; an d a s for its supporting acci-
dents, this, as we have just now observed, cannot b e under-
stood i n the common sense of those words; it must therefore
be take n i n some othe r sense , but wha t that i s they d o no t


Principles: Part I 3
1
explain. S o that whe n I  conside r th e tw o parts o r branche s
which make the signification of the words material substance,
I am convinced there is no distinct meaning annexed to them.
But why should we trouble ourselves any farther, in discussing
this material substratum or support of figure and motion, and
other sensibl e qualities ? Doe s i t no t suppos e the y hav e a n
existence withou t the mind ? And i s not thi s a direct repug -
nancy, and altogether inconceivable ?
18. But thoug h i t were possible tha t solid , figured, move-
able substances may exist without the mind, corresponding to
the idea s w e have o f bodies, ye t how is it possible fo r u s to
know this?* Either we must know it by sense, or by reason. As
for ou r senses , by them we have the knowledg e only of ou r
sensations, ideas , o r thos e thing s that ar e immediatel y per-
ceived b y sense , cal l the m wha t yo u will : but the y d o no t
inform us that things exist without the mind, or unperceived,
like to those which are perceived. This the materialists them-
selves acknowledge. It remains therefore that if we have any
knowledge a t al l o f externa l things , i t mus t b e b y reason ,
inferring their existence fro m wha t is immediately perceived
by sense. But what reason ca n induce us to believe the exist-
ence of bodies without the mind, from what we perceive, since
the very patrons of matter themselve s do not pretend, ther e
is any necessary connexion betwix t them and our ideas? I say
it i s grante d o n al l hand s (an d wha t happen s i n dreams ,
phrensies, and the like, puts it beyond dispute) that it is poss-
ible w e migh t b e affecte d wit h al l th e idea s w e hav e now ,
though n o bodie s existe d without , resembling them . Henc e
it is evident the supposition of external bodies is not necessary
for th e producin g our ideas: since it is granted they are pro -
duced sometimes , an d migh t possibl y b e produce d alway s
in th e sam e orde r w e see the m i n at present , withou t their
concurrence.
19. Bu t thoug h we might possibly have al l our sensation s
without them , ye t perhap s i t ma y b e though t easie r t o
conceive an d explai n th e manne r o f thei r production , b y
supposing externa l bodie s i n thei r likenes s rathe r tha n
otherwise; and so it might be at least probable there are such
things a s bodie s tha t excit e thei r idea s i n ou r minds . Bu t


32 Principles:
 Part I
neither ca n thi s be said ; for though we give the materialist s
their external bodies, they by their own confession are never
the nearer knowing how our ideas ar e produced: sinc e the y
own themselves unable to comprehend i n what manner body
can act upon spirit, or how it is possible it should imprint any
idea in the mind. Hence it is evident the production of ideas
or sensation s i n ou r minds , ca n b e n o reaso n wh y w e
should suppos e matte r o r corporeal substances , since that is
acknowledged to remain equally inexplicable with, or without
this supposition . I f therefor e i t wer e possibl e fo r bodie s
to exis t withou t th e mind , ye t t o hol d the y d o so , mus t
needs b e a  ver y precariou s opinion ; sinc e i t i s to suppose ,
without any reason a t all, that God has created innumerabl e
beings tha t ar e entirel y useless, an d serv e t o n o manne r of
purpose.
20. I n short, if there wer e external bodies, it is impossible
we shoul d eve r com e t o kno w it; and i f there were not , we
might have the very same reasons to think there were that w e
have now. Suppose, what no one can deny possible, an intel-
ligence, without th e hel p o f externa l bodies , t o b e affecte d
with th e sam e trai n o f sensation s o r idea s tha t yo u are ,
imprinted i n th e sam e orde r an d wit h lik e vividnes s i n hi s
mind. I ask whether that intelligence hath not all the reason to
believe the existence of corporeal substances , represented b y
his ideas, and exciting them in his mind, that you can possibly
have for believin g the sam e thing ? O f this there ca n be n o
question; whic h on e consideratio n i s enoug h t o mak e an y
reasonable perso n suspec t th e strengt h o f whateve r argu -
ments h e ma y thin k himsel f t o have , fo r th e existenc e o f
bodies without the mind.
21. Wer e it necessary to add any farther proof against th e
existence of matter, after what has been said, I could instance
several o f thos e error s an d difficultie s (no t t o mentio n
impieties) whic h hav e sprun g fro m tha t tenet . I t ha s occa -
sioned numberless controversies an d disputes in philosophy,
and not a few of far greater moment in religion. But I shall not
enter int o the detai l of them i n this place, as well because I
think, arguments a posteriori ar e unnecessary for confirmin g

priori, as because I shall hereafter find occasion to say some-
what of them.*
22. I  am afraid I  have given cause to think me needlessly
prolix i n handling this subject. For t o wha t purpose i s it t o
dilate o n tha t whic h may be demonstrate d wit h the utmos t
evidence in a line or two, to anyone that is capable of the least

trying whether yo u ca n conceiv e i t possible fo r a  sound, o r

unperceived. This easy trial may make you see, that what you
contend for, is a downright contradiction. Insomuch that I am
content to put th e whole upon this issue; if you can but con-
ceive it possible for one extended moveabl e substance , or in
general, fo r an y one ide a o r anythin g like a n idea , to exis t
otherwise than in a mind perceiving it, I shall readily give up
the cause : An d a s for al l that compages  o f externa l bodie s
which you contend for , I shall grant you its existence, though
you canno t eithe r giv e m e an y reaso n wh y yo u believ e i t
exists, or assign any use to it when it is supposed to exist. I say,
the bare possibility of your opinion's being true, shall pass for
an argument that it is so.
23. Bu t sa y you, surely there i s nothing easier tha n to im-
agine trees , fo r instance , i n a  park , o r book s existin g in a
closet, and nobody by to perceive them.* I answer, you may
so, there is no difficulty in it: but what is all this, I beseech you,
more than framing i n your mind certain ideas which you call
books an d trees, and at the same time omitting to frame th e
idea o f anyon e tha t ma y perceiv e them ? Bu t d o no t yo u
yourself perceiv e o r think of them al l the while ? This there -
fore i s nothing t o th e purpose : i t onl y show s yo u hav e th e
power of imagining or forming ideas in your mind; but it doth
not shew that you can conceive it possible, the objects of your
thought ma y exis t without the mind : to mak e ou t this , it is
necessary tha t yo u conceiv e the m existin g unconceive d o r
unthought of, which is a manifest repugnancy. When w e d o
our utmos t t o conceiv e th e existenc e o f external bodies, we
are al l the while only contemplating ou r ow n ideas. But th e
mind taking no notice of itself, is deluded to think it can and
doth conceiv e bodie s existin g unthough t o f o r withou t th e

mind; though a t the sam e time they are apprehende d b y or
exist i n itself . A  littl e attentio n wil l discove r t o anyon e th e
truth and evidence of what is here said, and make it unneces-
sary t o insis t o n an y othe r proof s agains t th e existenc e o f
material substance .
24. I t is very obvious, upon the least inquiry into our own
thoughts, to know whether it be possible for us to understand
what is meant, by the absolute  existence of sensible objects i n
themselves, o r without  th e mind. T o m e i t i s evident thos e
words mark out either a  direct contradiction, or else nothing
at all . And t o convince other s o f this, I know no readie r o r
fairer way, than to entreat the y would calmly attend to their
own thoughts: and if by this attention, the emptiness or repug-
nancy of those expressions doe s appear, surely nothing more
is requisite for their conviction . It is on this therefore tha t I
insist, to wit, that the absolute existence of unthinking things
are word s withou t a  meaning , o r whic h includ e a  contra -
diction. Thi s i s what I  repea t an d inculcate , an d earnestl y
recommend t o the attentive thoughts of the reader .
25. Al l our ideas , sensations, o r th e thing s which we per-
ceive, by whatsoever name s the y ma y be distinguished , are
visibly inactive, there is nothing of power or agency included
in them. So that one idea or object of thought cannot produce,
or make any alteration in another. To be satisfied of the truth
of this, there is nothing else requisite bu t a  bare observatio n
of our ideas. For since they and every part of them exist only
in the mind, it follows that there is nothing in them but what
is perceived. Bu t whoever shal l attend t o his ideas, whether
of sens e o r reflexion , wil l no t perceiv e i n the m an y powe r
or activity ; there i s therefor e n o suc h thin g containe d i n
them.* A little attention will discover to us that the very being
of a n ide a implie s passiveness an d inertnes s i n it, insomuch
that i t i s impossible fo r a n ide a t o d o anything , or, strictl y
speaking, to b e th e caus e o f anything: neither ca n it be th e
resemblance or pattern of any active being, as is evident fro m
sect. 8 . Whence i t plainly follows tha t extension , figur e an d
motion, cannot be the cause of our sensations. To say there-
fore, tha t thes e ar e th e effect s o f powers resulting from th e


Principles: Part I 3

configuration, number , motion , an d siz e o f corpuscles, mus t
certainly be false .
26. W e perceive a  continual succession of ideas, some ar e
anew excited, others are changed or totally disappear. There
is therefore som e cause of these ideas whereon they depend ,
and which produces and changes them. That this cause cannot
be an y quality or idea or combination of ideas, is clear fro m
the preceding section. It must therefore be a substance; but it
has been shew n tha t ther e i s no corporea l o r materia l sub -
stance: it remains therefore that the cause of ideas is an incor-
poreal activ e substance or spirit.
27. A  spiri t i s on e simple , undivided , activ e being : a s i t
perceives ideas , it is called th e understanding,  an d a s it pro-
duces or otherwise operates abou t them , it is called the will.
Hence there can be no idea formed of a soul or spirit: for all
ideas whatever , being passive an d inert , vide  sect . 25 , they
cannot represen t unt o us , by way of image or likeness, that
which acts. A little attention will make it plain to anyone, that
to hav e an ide a whic h shal l be lik e tha t activ e principle of
motion an d change of ideas, is absolutely impossible. Such is
the nature of spirit or that which acts, that it cannot be of itself
perceived, but onl y by the effect s whic h it produceth. I f any
man shall doubt of the truth of what is here delivered, let him
but reflec t an d tr y if he ca n frame th e ide a o f any power o r
active being ; an d whethe r h e hat h idea s o f tw o principa l
powers, marked by the names will and understanding, distinct
from eac h othe r a s well as from a  third idea of substance o r
being i n general , wit h a  relative notio n o f its supporting o r
being the subject of the aforesaid powers, which is signified by
the name soul or spirit. This is what some hold; but so far as I
can see, the words will, soul, spirit, do not stand for differen t
ideas, or in truth, for any idea at all, but for something which
is very different fro m ideas, and which being an agent cannot
be like unto, or represented by , any idea whatsoever. Though
it must be owned at the same time, that we have some notio n
of soul, spirit, and the operations o f the mind, such as willing,
loving, hating , i n a s muc h a s w e kno w o r understan d th e
meaning of those words.*

28. I  find I can excite ideas in my mind at pleasure, and vary
and shif t th e scen e a s oft a s I  thin k fit. It i s no mor e tha n
willing, and straightwa y this or tha t ide a arise s i n my fancy :
and b y the sam e power it is obliterated, an d make s way for
another. Thi s making and unmaking of ideas doth very pro-
perly denominate th e mind active. Thus much is certain, and
grounded o n experience : bu t whe n w e tal k o f unthinkin g
agents, o r o f excitin g idea s exclusiv e o f volition , w e onl y
amuse ourselves with words.
29. Bu t whatever power I may have over my own thoughts,
I find the idea s actually perceived b y sense hav e no t a  like
dependence o n my will. When in broad day-ligh t I open my
eyes, it is not i n my power to choos e whethe r I  shall see o r
no, o r t o determin e wha t particula r object s shal l presen t
themselves to my view; and so likewise as to the hearing and
other senses, the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of
my will . Ther e i s therefor e som e othe r wil l o r spiri t tha t
produces them .
30. Th e ideas of sense are more strong, lively, and distinct
than those of the imagination; the
y have likewise a steadiness,
order, and coherence, and are not excited at random, as those
which are the effects of human wills often are, but in a regular
train or series, the admirabl e connexion whereof sufficientl y
testifies the wisdom and benevolence o f its Author. Now the
set rules or established methods, wherein the mind we depend
on excite s i n u s th e idea s o f sense , ar e calle d th e Laws  o f
Nature: an d thes e w e learn by experience, whic h teaches u s
that suc h an d suc h idea s ar e attende d wit h suc h an d suc h
other ideas, in the ordinary course of things.
31. Thi s give s us a  sort o f foresight, which enables u s t o
regulate our actions for the benefit of life.* And withou t this
we should be eternally at a loss: we could not know how to act
anything that might procure us the least pleasure, or remove
the leas t pain of sense. That food nourishes, sleep refreshes ,
and fire warms us; that to sow in the seed-tim e is the way to
reap in the harvest, and, in general, that to obtain such or such
ends, such or such means are conducive, all this we know, not
by discoverin g an y necessary connexio n betwee n ou r ideas ,
but onl y b y th e observatio n o f th e settle d law s of Nature ,


Principles: Part I 3
7
without which we should be all in uncertainty and confusion ,
and a grown man no more know how to manage himself in the
affairs o f life, than an infant just born.
32. An d ye t this consistent uniform working, which so evi-
dently display s the goodnes s an d wisdo m of that governing
spirit whose will constitutes the Laws of Nature, is so far fro m
leading our thoughts to him, that it rather sends them a wan-
dering afte r secon d causes . Fo r whe n w e perceiv e certai n
ideas o f sens e constantl y followe d b y othe r ideas , an d w e
know this is not o f our doing , we forthwith attribute powe r
and agency to the ideas themselves, and make one the caus e
of another, than which nothing can be more absurd and unin-
telligible. Thus, for example, having observed tha t when we
perceive by sight a certain roun d luminou s figure, w e at th e
same time perceive by touch the idea or sensation called heat,
we do from thenc e conclude the sun to be the cause of heat.
And i n lik e manner perceivin g th e motio n an d collisio n of
bodies to be attended with sound, we are inclined to think the
latter an effect o f the former.
33. Th e idea s imprinte d o n th e sense s b y th e Autho r of
Nature ar e called real  things: and those excited i n the imagi-
nation being less regular, vivid and constant, are more prop -
erly termed ideas,  or images  of things,  which the y copy an d
represent. But then our sensations, be they never so vivid and
distinct, are nevertheless ideas, that is, they exist in the mind,
or are perceived by it, as truly as the ideas of its own framing.
The ideas of sense are allowed to have more reality in them,
that is , to b e mor e strong , orderly , an d coheren t tha n th e
creatures of the mind; but this is no argument that they exist
without the mind. They are also less dependent on the spirit,
or thinking substance which perceives them, in that they are
excited b y the wil l of another an d mor e powerfu l spirit : yet
still the y ar e ideas,  and certainl y n o idea,  whether fain t o r
strong, can exist otherwise tha n in a mind perceiving it.

some tim e i n answerin g objection s whic h may probabl y b e

which, if I seem too prolix to those of quick apprehensions, I
hope it may be pardoned, since all men do not equally appre-

hend things of this nature; and I am willing to be understood
by everyone. First then, it will be objected that by the forego-
ing principles , al l tha t i s rea l an d substantia l i n Natur e i s
banished ou t o f the world : and instea d thereo f a  chimerical
scheme of ideas takes place. All things that exist, exist only in
the mind , that is , they ar e purel y notional. Wha t therefor e
becomes of the sun, moon, and stars? What must we think of
houses, rivers, mountains, trees, stones; nay, even of our own
bodies? Ar e al l these but s o many chimeras and illusions on
the fancy ? T o al l which, and whatever else o f the sam e sort
may be objected, I answer, that by the principles premised, we
are no t deprive d o f an y one thin g i n Nature. Whateve r we
see, feel, hear, or anywise conceive or understand, remains as
secure as ever, and is as real as ever. There is a rerum natura,
and the distinction between realities and chimeras retains its
full force. This is evident from sects . 29, 30, and 33, where we
have shew n wha t i s mean t b y real  things  i n oppositio n t o
chimeras, or idea s o f our ow n framing ; bu t the n the y bot h
equally exist in the mind , and in that sense are alik e ideas.
35. I  do not argu e agains t the existenc e o f any one thin g
that we can apprehend, either by sense or reflexion. That the
things I see with mine eyes and touch with my hands do exist,
really exist , I  mak e no t th e leas t question . Th e onl y thin g
whose existence we deny, is that which philosophers call mat-
ter o r corporeal substance . And i n doing of this, there i s no
damage don e t o th e res t o f mankind, who, I dar e say , will
never mis s it. The atheis t indee d wil l want the colou r o f an
empty name to support his impiety; and the philosophers may
possibly find , the y hav e los t a  grea t handl e fo r triflin g an d
disputation.
36. I f an y ma n think s this detract s fro m th e existenc e o r
reality of things, he is very far from understanding what hath
been premise d i n the plaines t terms I  coul d thin k of . Tak e
here a n abstrac t o f what ha s been said . There ar e spiritua l
substances, minds, or human souls, which will or excite ideas
in themselves at pleasure: but thes e ar e faint, weak, and un-
steady in respect of others they perceive by sense, which being
impressed upo n the m accordin g t o certai n rule s o r law s of
Nature, speak themselves the effects of a mind more powerful

and wis e than huma n spirits . These latte r ar e sai d t o hav e
more reality  i n them than the former: by which is meant that
they ar e more affecting , orderly , and distinct , and tha t the y
are no t fiction s o f th e min d perceivin g them . An d i n thi s
sense, the sun that I see by day is the real sun, and that which
I imagine by night is the idea of the former. In the sense here
given of reality, i t is evident tha t ever y vegetable, star, min-
eral, an d i n general eac h par t o f the mundan e system , is as
much a real being by our principles as by any other. Whethe r
others mean anything by the term reality differen t fro m what
I do, I entreat the m to look into their own thoughts and see.
37. I t will be urged that thu s much at least is true, to wit,
that we take away all corporeal substances. To this my answer
is, that if the word substance be taken in the vulgar sense, for
a combination of sensible qualities, such as extension, solidity,
weight, and the like; this we cannot be accused of taking away.
But i f it be take n i n a  philosophic sense , for th e suppor t o f
accidents o r qualitie s withou t th e mind : the n indee d I  ac -
knowledge that w e take it away , if one ma y be sai d to tak e
away tha t whic h never ha d an y existence , no t eve n i n th e
imagination.
38. But , sa y you, it sound s ver y harsh t o sa y we ea t an d
drink ideas, and are clothed with ideas. I acknowledge it does
so, th e wor d idea  no t bein g use d i n commo n discours e t o
signify th e severa l combination s o f sensible qualities , which
are calle d things:  an d i t is certain tha t an y expression which
varies from th e familiar use of language, will seem harsh and
ridiculous. Bu t thi s dot h no t concer n th e trut h o f the pro -
position, which in other words is no more than to say, we are
fed an d clothed with those things which we perceive immedi-
ately b y ou r senses . Th e hardnes s o r softness , th e colour ,
taste, warmth, figure, and such like qualities, which combined
together constitut e th e severa l sorts of victuals and apparel ,
have bee n shew n t o exis t onl y i n th e min d tha t perceive s
them; and this is all that is meant by calling them ideas', which
word, i f it wa s a s ordinaril y used a s thing,  would sound n o
harsher no r mor e ridiculou s than it . I a m not fo r disputin g
about the propriety, but the truth of the expression. If there-
fore yo u agree wit h me that w e eat an d drink , and ar e cla d


40 Principles:

with th e immediat e object s o f sens e whic h canno t exis t
unperceived o r withou t th e mind : I  shal l readil y gran t i t is
more prope r o r conformable t o custom, that the y should b e
called things rather tha n ideas.*
39. I f it be demanded why I make use of the word idea, and
do not rathe r i n compliance wit h custom cal l them things . I
answer, I do it for two reasons: first, because the term thing, in
contradistinction t o idea,  i s generall y suppose d t o denot e
somewhat existing without the mind: secondly, because thing
hath a more comprehensiv e significatio n tha n idea, including
spirits or thinking things as well as ideas. Since therefore th e
objects of sense exist only in the mind, and are withal thought-
less an d inactive , I  chos e t o mar k the m b y th e wor d idea,
which implies those properties .
40. Bu t say what we can, someone perhap s ma y be apt t o
reply, h e wil l stil l believ e hi s senses , an d neve r suffe r an y
arguments, how plausible soever, to prevail over the certainty
of them. Be it so, assert th e evidenc e of sense a s high as you
please, w e are willing to do the same. Tha t wha t I see, hea r
and feel doth exist, that is to say, is perceived by me, I no more
doubt tha n I do of my own being. But I do not se e how the
testimony of sense can be alleged, as a proof for the existenc e
of anything, which is not perceive d b y sense. W e ar e not fo r
having any man turn sceptic, and disbelieve his senses; on the
contrary we give them all the stress and assurance imaginable;
nor are there any principles more opposite t o scepticism, than
those we have laid down, as shall be hereafter clearl y shewn.
41. Secondly , it will be objected tha t there is a great differ -
ence betwixt real fire, for instance, and the idea of fire, betwixt
dreaming or imagining one's self burnt, and actually being so:
this and the like may be urged in opposition t o our tenets. To
all which the answe r is evident from wha t hath been alread y
said, and I shall only add in this place, that if real fire be very
different fro m th e ide a o f fire, so also is the rea l pain that i t
occasions, very different fro m th e idea of the same pain: and
yet nobody wil l pretend that rea l pain either is, or can poss-
ibly be , i n a n unperceivin g thin g o r withou t th e mind , an y
more than its idea.

42. Thirdly , it will be objecte d tha t we see things actually
without or at a distance fro m us , and which consequently do
not exist in the mind, it being absurd that those thing s which
are seen at the distance of several miles, should be as near to
us as our own thoughts. In answer to this, I desire i t may be
considered, tha t i n a  drea m w e d o of t perceiv e thing s a s
existing at a great distance off, and yet for all that, those things
are acknowledged t o have their existence onl y in the mind.
43. Bu t for the fuller clearing of this point, it may be worth
while t o consider , ho w i t i s tha t w e perceiv e distanc e an d
things placed at a distance by sight. For that we should in truth
see externa l space , an d bodie s actuall y existin g i n it , som e
nearer, others farther off, seems to carry with it some opposi -
tion to what hath been said, of their existing nowhere without
the mind. The consideration of this difficulty i t was, that gave
birth to my Essay towards a new Theory  o f Vision,  which was
published not long since. Wherein it is shewn that distance or
outness is neither immediately of itself perceived by sight, nor
yet apprehended o r judged of by lines and angles, or anything
that hat h a  necessar y connexio n wit h it : but tha t i t i s only
suggested t o ou r thoughts , by certain visibl e ideas an d sen -
sations attendin g vision, which i n their ow n nature hav e n o
manner o f similitud e o r relation , eithe r wit h distance , o r
things placed a t a distance. But by a connexion taugh t us by
experience, they come to signify and suggest them to us, after
the same manner that words of any language suggest the ideas
they are made to stand for. Insomuch tha t a man born blind ,
and afterwards made to see, would not, at first sight, think the
things he saw, to be without his mind, or at any distance from
him. See sect. 41 of the forementioned treatise .
44. Th e ideas of sight and touch make two species, entirely
distinct an d heterogeneous . Th e forme r ar e mark s an d
prognostics o f th e latter . Tha t th e prope r object s o f sigh t
neither exis t without the mind, nor are the images of external
things, was shewn eve n i n that treatise . Thoug h throughou t
the same , the contrar y be supposed tru e o f tangible objects :
not that to suppose that vulgar error, was necessary for estab-
lishing the notion therein laid down; but because it was beside


42 Principles:
 Part I
my purpose to examine and refute it in a discourse concerning
vision. S o tha t i n stric t trut h th e idea s o f sight , whe n w e
apprehend b y them distance and things placed a t a distance,
do not suggest or mark out to us things actually existing at a
distance, bu t onl y admonis h u s what idea s o f touch wil l be
imprinted in our minds at such and such distances of time, and
in consequence of  such and suc h actions. It is, I say, evident
from what has been said in the foregoing parts of this treatise,
and in sect. 147, and elsewhere of the essay concerning vision,
that visibl e idea s ar e th e languag e whereby th e governin g
spirit, on whom we depend, informs us what tangible ideas he
is abou t t o imprin t upon us , i n cas e w e excit e thi s o r tha t
motion in our own bodies. But for a fuller information in this
point, I refer to the essay itself.
45. Fourthly , i t wil l b e objecte d tha t fro m th e foregoin g
principles it follows, things are every moment annihilated and
created anew . The object s of sense exist only when they ar e
perceived: the trees therefore ar e in the garden, or the chairs
in the parlour, no longer than while there is somebody by to
perceive them . Upon shutting my eyes all the furniture in the
room is reduced to nothing, and barely upon opening them it
is again created. I n answer to all which, I refer the reader t o
what has been said in sects. 3, 4, &c. and desir e h e will con-
sider whether he means anything by the actual existence of an
idea, distinct from it s being perceived. Fo r my part, after th e
nicest inquir y I  could make , I  am not abl e t o discove r tha t
anything els e i s mean t b y thos e words . An d I  onc e mor e
entreat th e reader t o sound his own thoughts, and not suffe r
himself t o b e impose d o n b y words . I f h e ca n conceiv e i t
possible eithe r for his ideas or their archetype s to exist with-
out being perceived, then I give up the cause: but if he cannot,
he will acknowledge it is unreasonable fo r him to stand up in
defence of he knows not what, and pretend to charge on me as
an absurdity, the not assenting to those propositions which at
bottom hav e no meaning in them.
46. I t wil l no t b e amis s to observe , ho w fa r th e receive d
principles of philosophy are themselves chargeable with those
pretended absurdities . I t i s though t strangel y absur d tha t
upon closin g m y eyelids , al l th e visibl e object s roun d m e


Principles: Part  I 4

should be reduced to nothing; and yet is not this what philo-
sophers commonl y acknowledge , whe n the y agre e o n al l
hands, that light and colours, which alone are the proper and
immediate objects of sight, are mere sensations that exist no
longer than the y are perceived? Again , it may to some per -
haps see m ver y incredible, that thing s should be ever y mo-
ment creating, yet this very notion is commonly taught in the
Schools. Fo r th e Schoolmen , thoug h the y acknowledg e th e
existence o f matter, an d tha t th e whol e mundane fabric k i s
framed ou t o f it, ar e nevertheles s o f opinion tha t i t cannot
subsist withou t th e divin e conservation , whic h b y the m i s
expounded t o be a continual creation.*
47. Farther , a little thought will discover to us, that though
we allow the existence of matter or corporeal substance, yet it
will unavoidabl y follo w fro m th e principle s whic h ar e no w
generally admitted , tha t th e particula r bodie s o f what kin d
soever, do none o f them exist whilst they are not perceived .
For it is evident from sect , n and the following sections, that
the matte r philosophers contend for, is an incomprehensibl e
somewhat whic h hat h non e o f thos e particula r qualities ,
whereby the bodies falling under our senses are distinguished
one fro m another . Bu t t o mak e thi s more plain , it must b e
remarked, that the infinite divisibility of matter is now univer-
sally allowed, at least by the most approved and considerabl e
philosophers, wh o on the receive d principle s demonstrat e i t
beyond all exception. Hence it follows, that there is an infinite
number o f part s i n eac h particl e o f matter , whic h ar e no t
perceived by sense. The reason therefore, that any particular
body seem s t o b e o f a  finit e magnitude , o r exhibit s only a
finite numbe r of parts to sense, is not becaus e i t contains no
more, since in itself it contains an infinite number of parts, but
because th e sens e i s not acut e enoug h t o discer n them . I n
proportion therefore a s the sens e i s rendered mor e acute , it
perceives a greater number of parts in the object, that is, the
object appears greater, and its figure varies, those parts in its
extremities which were before unperceivable, appearing now
to boun d i t i n ver y differen t line s an d angle s fro m thos e
perceived b y an obtuse r sense . An d a t length , afte r variou s

acute, the bod y shall seem infinite . During all which there is
no alteratio n i n the body , but onl y in the sense . Each body
therefore considered i n itself, is infinitely extended, and con-
sequently void of all shape o r figure. From which it follows ,
that though we should grant the existence of matter to be ever
so certain, yet i t i s withal as certain, th e materialist s them-
selves are by their own principles forced to acknowledge, that
neither the particular bodies perceived by sense, nor anything
like the m exist s withou t the mind . Matter , I  say , and eac h
particle thereof is according to them, infinite an d shapeless,*
and it is the mind that frames al l that variety of bodies which
compose th e visibl e world , any one whereo f doe s no t exis t
longer than it is perceived.
48. I f we consider it, the objection proposed in sect. 45 will
not b e foun d reasonabl y charged o n th e principle s we have
premised, s o as in truth to make any objection a t all against
our notions. For though we hold indeed the objects of sense to
be nothing else but ideas which cannot exist unperceived; yet
we ma y not henc e conclud e the y hav e n o existenc e excep t
only while they are perceived by us, since there may be some
other spirit that perceives them, though we do not. Wherever
bodies are said to have no existence without the mind, I would
not be understood to mean this or that particular mind, but all
minds whatsoever. It does not therefore follow from the fore-
going principles, that bodies are annihilated and created every
moment, o r exist not a t all during the intervals between ou r
perception o f them.
49. Fifthly , i t ma y perhap s b e objected , tha t i f extensio n
and figure exist only in the mind , it follows tha t the min d is
extended an d figured; since extension is a mode or attribute,
which (to speak with the Schools) is predicated o f the subjec t
in which it exists. I answer, those qualities are in the mind only
as they ar e perceive d b y it, that is , not b y way of mode o r
attribute, but only by way of idea', and it no more follows, that
the sou l o r min d i s extended becaus e extensio n exist s in it
alone, than it does that it is red or blue, because those colours
are o n al l hands acknowledge d t o exis t i n it , an d nowher e
else. A s to what philosophers sa y of subject and mode, that
seems very groundless and unintelligible. For instance, in this


Principles: Part I 4

proposition, a die is hard, extended and square, they will have
it tha t th e wor d di e denotes a  subject o r substance , distinct
from the hardness, extension and figure, which are predicated
of it, and in which they exist. This I cannot comprehend: to me
a die seems to be nothing distinct from those things which are
termed it s mode s o r accidents . An d t o sa y a  di e i s hard ,
extended an d square , is not t o attribut e those qualities to a
subject distinct from an d supporting them, but only an expli-
cation o f the meanin g of the wor d die.
50. Sixthly , you wil l sa y ther e hav e bee n a  grea t man y
things explained by matter and motion: take away these, and
you destro y th e whol e corpuscula r philosophy , an d under -
mine thos e mechanica l principle s whic h hav e bee n applie d
with so much success to account for the phenomena. In short,
whatever advance s hav e bee n made , eithe r b y ancien t o r
modern philosophers, i n the stud y of Nature, do all proceed
on the supposition , tha t corporea l substanc e o r matter dot h
really exist . T o thi s I  answer , tha t ther e i s no t an y on e
phenomenon explaine d on that supposition, which may not as
well be explained without it, as might easily be made appea r
by an induction of particulars. To explain the phenomena , is
all one as to shew, why upon such and such occasions we are
affected wit h suc h an d suc h ideas . Bu t ho w matte r shoul d
operate on a spirit, or produce any idea in it, is what no philos-
opher will pretend to explain. It is therefore evident, there can
be no use of matter in natural philosophy. Besides, they who
attempt t o accoun t fo r things , do i t no t b y corporea l sub -
stance, but by figure, motion, and other qualities, which are in
truth no more than mere ideas, and therefore canno t be the
cause of anything, as hath been already shewn. See sect. 25.
51. Seventhly , i t wil l upon thi s b e demande d whethe r i t
does not seem absurd to take away natural causes, and ascribe
everything to the immediate operation of spirits? We must no
longer say upon these principles that fire heats, or water cools,
but tha t a  spiri t heats , an d s o forth . Woul d no t a  ma n b e
deservedly laughed at , who should talk afte r thi s manner? I
answer, he would so; in such things we ought to think with the
learned, an d speak  with  th e vulgar*  The y wh o t o demon -
stration are convinced of the truth of the Copernican system,

do nevertheless say the sun rises, the sun sets, or comes to the
meridian: and if they affected a  contrary style in common talk,
it woul d withou t doub t appea r ver y ridiculous . A  littl e
reflexion o n what is here said will make it manifest, that th e
common us e o f language would receive n o manner o f alter-
ation or disturbance from th e admissio n of our tenets .
52. I n th e ordinar y affairs o f life, an y phrases ma y b e re -
tained, s o lon g a s the y excit e i n u s prope r sentiments , o r
dispositions t o ac t i n such a  manner a s is necessary for ou r
well-being, how false soeve r the y may be, if taken in a strict
and speculative sense. Nay this is unavoidable, since propriety
being regulated by custom, language is suited to the receive d
opinions, which are not always the truest. Hence it is imposs-
ible, even in the mos t rigid philosophic reasonings, so far t o
alter the bent and genius of the tongue we speak, as never to
give a handle for cavillers to pretend difficulties and inconsist-
encies. But a fair and ingenuous reader wil l collect the sense ,
from the scope and tenor an d connexion of a discourse, mak-
ing allowance s for thos e inaccurat e mode s o f speech, which
use has made inevitable .
53. As to the opinio n tha t ther e ar e no corporeal causes ,
this ha s bee n heretofor e maintaine d b y som e o f th e
Schoolmen, as it is of late by others among the modern philo-
sophers,* wh o thoug h the y allo w matte r t o exist , ye t wil l
have Go d alon e t o b e th e immediat e efficien t caus e o f all
things. These men saw, that amongst all the objects of sense,
there was none which had any power or activity included in it,
and tha t b y consequence thi s was likewise true of whatever
bodies they supposed to exist without the mind, like unto the
immediate object s of sense. Bu t then , that the y shoul d sup-
pose an innumerable multitud e o f created beings, which they
acknowledge are no t capabl e o f producing any one effec t i n
Nature, and which therefore ar e made to no manner o f pur-
pose, since God might have done everythin g as well without
them; this I say, though we should allow it possible, must yet
be a very unaccountable and extravagant supposition .
54. I n the eight h place, the universa l concurrent assen t of
mankind may be thought by some, an invincible argument in
behalf of matter, or the existence of external things. Must we


Principles: Part I 4
7
suppose th e whol e worl d t o b e mistaken ? An d i f so, what
cause can be assigned of so widespread an d predominant a n
error? I answer, first, that upo n a  narrow inquiry, it will no t
perhaps be found, so many as is imagined do really believe the
existence of matter or things without the mind. Strictly speak-
ing, to believe that which involves a contradiction, or has no
meaning i n it , is impossible: and whethe r th e foregoin g ex-
pressions are not of that sort, I refer it to the impartial exam-
ination of the reader. In one sense indeed, men may be said to
believe that matter exists, that is, they act as if the immediate
cause o f their sensations, whic h affects the m ever y momen t
and i s so nearly presen t t o them , wer e som e senseles s un -
thinking being. Bu t tha t the y shoul d clearl y apprehend an y
meaning marked by those words , and form thereo f a  settled
speculative opinion, is what I am not able to conceive. This is
not the only instance wherein men impose upon themselves,
by imagining they believe those propositions the y have ofte n
heard, though at bottom the y have no meaning in them.
55. Bu t secondly , though we should gran t a  notion t o b e
ever s o universally and stedfastl y adhered to , yet thi s is but
a wea k argumen t o f its truth, t o whoeve r consider s wha t a
vast number of prejudices and false opinions are everywhere
embraced wit h the utmost tenaciousness, by the unreflectin g
(which are the far greater) part of mankind. There was a time
when th e Antipode s an d motio n o f th e eart h wer e looke d
upon as monstrous absurdities, even by men of learning: and
if it be considere d wha t a small proportion the y bear t o th e
rest of mankind, we shall find that at this day, those notion s
have gained but a  very inconsiderable footin g in the world.
56. Bu t it is demanded, that we assign a cause of this preju-
dice, an d accoun t fo r it s obtainin g i n th e world . T o thi s I
answer, tha t me n knowin g the y perceive d severa l ideas ,
whereof the y themselves were not th e authors , a s not bein g
excited from within, nor depending on the operation o f their
wills, this made them maintain, those ideas or objects of per-
ception ha d a n existenc e independen t of , an d withou t th e
mind, withou t eve r dreamin g tha t a  contradictio n wa s in-
volved in those words. But philosophers having plainly seen,
that the immediate objects of perception d o not exist without

 Part I
the mind , they in some degre e correcte d th e mistak e o f the
vulgar, but a t th e sam e tim e ru n int o anothe r whic h seem s
no les s absurd , t o wit , tha t ther e ar e certai n object s reall y
existing withou t th e mind , o r havin g a  subsistenc e distinc t
from bein g perceived, o f which our idea s are only images or
resemblances, imprinte d b y those object s o n the mind . An d
this notio n o f the philosopher s owe s it s origi n t o th e sam e
cause with the former, namely, their being conscious that they
were no t th e author s o f thei r ow n sensations , whic h the y
evidently kne w wer e imprinte d fro m without , an d whic h
therefore mus t have some cause , distinct from th e mind s on
which they are imprinted .
57. Bu t why they should suppose th e idea s of sense t o b e
excited i n us by things in their likeness , an d not rathe r hav e
recourse t o spirit which alone can act, may be accounted for ,
first, because they were not aware of the repugnancy there is,
as well in supposing thing s like unto ou r idea s existing with-
out, a s i n attributin g t o the m powe r o r activity . Secondly ,
because th e suprem e spiri t which excites thos e idea s i n our
minds, i s no t marke d ou t an d limite d t o ou r vie w b y an y
particular finite collection o f sensible ideas , as human agent s
are by their size, complexion, limbs
, and motions. And thirdly,
because hi s operations ar e regula r an d uniform . Wheneve r
the cours e o f Natur e i s interrupted b y a  miracle , me n ar e
ready to own the presence o f a superior agent. But when we
see things go on in the ordinary course, they do not excite in
us any reflection; their order and concatenation, thoug h it be
an argument of the greatest wisdom , power, and goodness in
their Creator, i s yet so constant and familiar to us, that we do
not think them the immediate effects of a free spirit: especially
since inconstanc y and mutabilit y i n acting , though i t b e a n
imperfection, is looked o n a s a mark of freedom .
58. Tenthly , i t wil l b e objected , tha t th e notion s w e ad -
vance, ar e inconsisten t wit h severa l soun d truth s i n philo -
sophy an d mathematics . Fo r example , th e motio n o f th e
earth i s now universally admitted b y astronomers, a s a truth
grounded o n th e cleares t an d mos t convincin g reasons ; bu t
on th e foregoin g principles , ther e ca n b e n o suc h thing .

perceived, i t exist s not ; bu t th e motio n o f th e eart h i s no t
perceived by sense. I answer, that tenet, if rightly understood,
will be found to agree with the principles we have premised:
for th e question, whether the earth moves or no, amounts in
reality to no more tha n this, to wit, whether we have reaso n
to conclude fro m wha t hath been observed b y astronomers ,
that i f w e wer e place d i n suc h an d suc h circumstances ,
and such or such a position and distance, both from the eart h
and sun, we should perceive th e former to move among the
choir o f th e planets , and appearin g i n al l respects lik e on e
of them : an d this , by the establishe d rule s o f Nature, which
we have no reaso n t o mistrust , is reasonably collecte d fro m
the phenomena .
59. W e may, from th e experience we have had of the train
and succession of ideas in our minds, often make, I will not say
uncertain conjectures , bu t sur e an d well-grounde d predic -
tions, concerning the ideas we shall be affected with, pursuant
to a  grea t trai n o f actions , an d b e enable d t o pas s a  right
judgment of what would have appeared t o us, in case we were
placed in circumstances very different fro m those we are in at
present. Herein consists the knowledge of Nature, which may
preserve its use and certainty very consistently with what hath
been said. It will be easy to apply this to whatever objections
of the like sort may be drawn from the magnitude of the stars,
or any other discoverie s in astronomy or Nature.
60. I n th e elevent h place , i t wil l b e demande d t o wha t
purpose serve s tha t curiou s organizatio n o f plants, and th e
admirable mechanism i n the parts o f animals; might not ve -
getables grow, and shoot forth leaves and blossoms, and ani-
mals perform all their motions, as well without as with all that
variety o f interna l part s s o elegantl y contrive d an d pu t
together, whic h being ideas have nothing powerful or opera -
tive i n them , no r hav e an y necessar y connexio n wit h th e
effects ascribe d t o them ? I f i t b e a  spiri t tha t immediatel y
produces every effect by a fiat, or act of his will, we must think
all that is fine and artificia l i n the works , whether o f man o r
Nature, to be made in vain. By this doctrine, though an artist
hath mad e th e sprin g and wheels , and ever y movement o f

would produce the motions he designed; yet he must think all
this done t o n o purpose, an d tha t it is an intelligenc e which
directs the index, and points to the hour of the day. If so, why
may not the intelligence do it, without his being at the pains of
making th e movements , an d puttin g the m together ? Wh y
does no t a n empty case serv e a s well as another? An d ho w
comes it to pass, that whenever there is any fault in the going
of a watch, there is some corresponding disorder to be found
in the movements, which being mended by a skilful hand , all
is right again ? The lik e may b e sai d of all the clockwor k of
Nature, great part whereof is so wonderfully fine and subtle,
as scarce to be discerned b y the best microscope. I n short, it
will be asked, how upon our principles any tolerable accoun t
can be given , or an y final cause assigned of an innumerable
multitude o f bodie s an d machine s frame d wit h th e mos t
exquisite art , whic h i n th e commo n philosoph y have ver y
apposite uses assigned them, and serve to explain abundance
of phenomena .
61. T o al l whic h I  answer , first , tha t thoug h ther e wer e
some difficulties relatin g to the administration of providence,
and th e use s b y i t assigne d to th e severa l part s o f Nature,
which I could not solv e by the foregoin g principles, yet this
objection could be of small weight against the truth and cer-
tainty of those things which may be proved a priori, with the
utmost evidence. Secondly, but neither are the received prin-
ciples fre e fro m th e lik e difficulties ; fo r i t ma y stil l b e de -
manded, t o wha t en d Go d shoul d tak e thos e round-abou t
methods o f effectin g thing s by instrument s an d machines ,
which no one can deny might have been effected b y the mere
command o f hi s will , withou t al l tha t apparatus:  nay , if w e
narrowly consider it , we shall find the objectio n ma y be re -
torted wit h greater force on those who hold th e existenc e of
those machine s without the mind ; for i t has been mad e evi-
dent, that solidity, bulk, figure, motion an d the like, have no
activity o r efficacy  i n them, so as to b e capabl e of producing
any on e effec t i n Nature . Se e sect . 25 . Whoever therefor e
supposes the m t o exis t (allowin g the suppositio n possible )
when they are not perceived, does it manifestly to no purpose;
since th e onl y us e tha t i s assigne d t o them , a s the y exis t


Principles: Part I 5
1
unperceived, i s that the y produce thos e perceivabl e effects ,
which in truth cannot be ascribed to anything but spirit.
62. Bu t to come nearer th e difficulty , i t must be observed ,
that thoug h th e fabricatio n of all those part s an d organ s b e
not absolutel y necessary to the producing any effect, ye t it is
necessary t o th e producin g o f thing s in a  constant , regular
way, according to the Laws of Nature. There are certain gen-
eral laws that run through the whole chain of natural effects :
these are learned by the observation and study of Nature, and
are by men applied a s well to the framing artificia l things for
the use and ornament o f life, as to the explaining the various
phenomena: whic h explicatio n consist s onl y i n shewin g th e
conformity an y particular phenomeno n hat h t o th e genera l
Laws of Nature, or, which is the same thing, in discovering the
uniformity ther e is in the production of natural effects; as will
be eviden t to whoeve r shall atten d t o th e severa l instances,
wherein philosopher s preten d t o accoun t fo r appearances .
That ther e i s a grea t an d conspicuou s us e i n thes e regula r
constant method s o f workin g observe d b y th e Suprem e
Agent, hath been shewn in sect. 31. And i t is no less visible,
that a  particular size, figure, motion and dispositio n of parts
are necessary , thoug h no t absolutel y t o th e producin g an y
effect, ye t t o th e producin g i t accordin g t o th e standin g
mechanical Laws of Nature. Thus, for instance, it cannot b e
denied that God, or the intelligence which sustains and rules
the ordinar y cours e o f thing s might, if he wer e minde d t o
produce a miracle, choose all the motions on the dial-plate of
a watch, though nobody had ever made the movements, and
put the m in it: but ye t if he will act agreeably to the rules of
mechanism, by him for wise ends established an d maintained
in the Creation, it is necessary that those actions of the watch-
maker, whereby he makes the movements and rightly adjusts
them, precede the production of the aforesaid motions; as also
that any disorder in them be attended wit h the perception of
some corresponding disorder i n the movements, which being
once corrected al l is right again.
63. I t may indeed on some occasions be necessary, that the
Author o f Nature display his overruling power i n producing
some appearanc e ou t o f the ordinar y serie s o f things. Such


52 Principles:
 Part I
exceptions fro m th e genera l rule s o f Natur e ar e prope r t o
surprise and awe men into an acknowledgement of the Divine
Being: bu t the n the y ar e t o b e use d bu t seldom , otherwis e
there i s a  plai n reaso n wh y the y shoul d fai l o f tha t effect .
Besides, God seem s t o choose th e convincin g our reaso n of
his attributes by the works of Nature, which discover so much
harmony and contrivanc e i n their make , and ar e suc h plain
indications of wisdom and beneficence in their Author, rather
than to astonish us into a belief of his being by anomalous and
surprising events.
64. T o set this matter in a yet clearer light, I shall observe
that what has been objected in sect. 60 amounts in reality to
no mor e tha n this : idea s ar e no t anyho w an d a t rando m
produced, there being a certain order and connexion between
them, lik e to tha t o f cause an d effect : ther e are als o several
combinations o f them, made i n a  very regular an d artificia l
manner, which seem like so many instruments in the hand of
Nature, that bein g hid a s it were behin d th e scenes , hav e a
secret operatio n i n producing thos e appearance s whic h ar e
seen on the theatre of the world, being themselves discernible
only to the curious eye of the philosopher. But since one idea
cannot b e th e caus e o f another , t o wha t purpos e i s tha t
connexion? And since those instruments, being barely ineffi-
cacious perceptions i n th e mind , ar e no t subservien t t o th e
production o f natura l effects ; i t i s demanded wh y the y ar e
made, or, in other words , what reason ca n be assigne d why
God shoul d make us, upon a close inspection into his works,
behold so great variety of ideas, so artfully lai d together, an d
so much according to rule; it not being credible, that he would
be a t th e expens e (i f one ma y s o speak) of al l that ar t an d
regularity to no purpose?
65. T o al l which my answer is, first, that the connexio n of
ideas does not imply the relation of cause and effect,  bu t only
of a mark or sign with the thing signified. Th e fire which I see
is not th e caus e of the pai n I suffer upo n my approaching it,
but the mark that forewarns me of it. In like manner, the noise
that I hear is not the effec t o f this or that motion or collision
of th e ambien t bodies , bu t th e sig n thereof . Secondly , th e
reason why ideas are formed into machines, that is, artificial


Principles: Part I 5
3
and regular combinations, is the same with that for combining
letters int o words. That a few original ideas may be made to
signify a  great number o f effects an d actions , it is necessary
they be variously combined together: and to the end their use
be permanen t an d universal , thes e combination s mus t b e
made by rule, and with wise contrivance. By this means abun-
dance of information is conveyed unto us, concerning what we
are to expect from suc h and such actions, and what methods
are proper to be taken, for the exciting such and such ideas:
which i n effec t i s all that I  conceive t o b e distinctl y meant,
when i t i s sai d tha t b y discernin g th e figure , texture , an d
mechanism o f the inward parts of bodies, whether natural or
artificial, we may attain to know the several uses and proper-
ties depending thereon, or the nature of the thing.
66. Henc e it is evident, that thos e things which under th e
notion o f a  caus e co-operatin g o r concurrin g t o th e pro -
duction of effects, are altogether inexplicable, and run us into
great absurdities, may be very naturally explained, and have a
proper an d obviou s use assigne d them , when the y are con -
sidered onl y as marks or signs for our information . And i t is
the searchin g after , an d endeavourin g t o understan d thos e
signs instituted by the Author o f Nature, that ought to be the
employment o f the natural philosopher, and not the pretend-
ing t o explai n thing s b y corporea l causes ; whic h doctrin e
seems to have too much estranged the minds of men from that
active principle, that supreme and wise spirit, in whom we live,
move, and have our being*
67. I n the twelft h place , it may perhaps b e objected , tha t
though i t be clea r fro m wha t ha s been said , that ther e can
be n o suc h thin g a s a n inert , senseless , extended , solid ,
figured, moveable substance, existing without the mind, such
as philosophers describ e matter : ye t i f an y ma n shal l leav e
out of his idea of matter, the positive ideas of extension, figure,
solidity and motion, and say that he means only by that word,
an iner t senseles s substance , tha t exist s withou t th e mind ,
or unperceived , whic h i s th e occasio n o f ou r ideas , o r a t
the presence whereo f Go d i s pleased to excite ideas in us: it
doth no t appear , bu t tha t matte r take n i n thi s sens e ma y
possibly exist. In answer to which I say, first, that it seems no


54 Principles:
 Part I
less absurd to suppose a substance withou t accidents, tha n it
is t o suppos e accident s withou t a  substance . Bu t secondly ,
though we should grant this unknown substance may possibly
exist, yet where can it be supposed t o be? Tha t i t exists no t
in the mind is agreed, and that it exists not in place is no less
certain; sinc e al l extension exist s only i n th e mind , a s hat h
been alread y proved. I t remain s therefore tha t i t exists no-
where at all.
68. Le t us examine a little the description that is here given
us of matter. It neither acts, nor perceives, nor is perceived: for
this i s al l tha t i s mean t b y sayin g it i s a n inert , senseless ,
unknown substance; which is a definition entirely made up of
negatives, exceptin g onl y the relativ e notion o f its standing
under o r supporting : bu t the n i t mus t b e observed , tha t i t
supports nothin g a t all ; an d ho w nearl y thi s come s t o th e
description of a non-entity, I desire may be considered. But,
say you, it is the unknown occasion, at the presence of which,
ideas are excited in us by the wil l of God.* Now I would fain
know ho w anythin g can b e presen t t o us , whic h is neither
perceivable by sense nor reflexion , nor capable of producing
any ide a i n ou r minds , nor i s at al l extended, no r hat h an y
form, nor exist s in any place. The word s to be present, when
thus applied , mus t need s b e take n i n som e abstrac t an d
strange meaning, and which I am not able to comprehend .
69. Again , let us examine what is meant by occasion: so far
as I can gather from th e common use of language, that word
signifies, eithe r th e agen t whic h produces an y effect , o r els e
something that is observed to accompany, or go before it, in
the ordinary course of things. But when it is applied to matter
as above described, it can be taken in neither of those senses .
For matter is said to be passive and inert, and so cannot be an
agent o r efficien t cause . I t i s als o unperceivable , a s bein g
devoid of all sensible qualities, and so cannot be the occasio n
of our perceptions in the latter sense: as when the burning m
y
finger is said to b e th e occasio n o f the pai n tha t attend s it .
What therefore can be meant by calling matter a n occasion 1?
This term is either used in no sense at all, or else in some sense
very distant from it s received signification .


Principles: Part I 5

70. Yo u wil l perhap s sa y tha t matter , thoug h i t b e no t
perceived by us, is nevertheless perceived by God, to whom it
is the occasio n o f exciting ideas i n our minds . For, sa y you,
since we observe our sensations to be imprinted in an orderly
and constant manner, it is but reasonable to suppose there are
certain constan t an d regula r occasion s o f thei r bein g pro -
duced. That i s to say , that ther e ar e certai n permanen t an d
distinct parcels of matter, corresponding to our ideas, which,
though the y d o no t excit e the m i n ou r minds , or an y way s
immediately affec t us , a s bein g altogethe r passiv e an d
unperceivable t o us, they are nevertheless to God, by whom
they ar e perceived , a s it were s o many occasion s t o remin d
him whe n an d wha t idea s t o imprin t on ou r minds : that s o
things may go on in a constant uniform manner.
71. I n answer to this I observe, that as the notion of matter
is here stated, the question is no longer concerning the exist-
ence of a thing distinct from spirit  an d idea,  from perceivin g
and being perceived: but whether there are not certain ideas,
of I  know not wha t sort, i n the min d o f God, whic h are s o
many mark s o r note s tha t direc t hi m ho w t o produc e sen -
sations in our minds, in a constant and regular method: much
after the same manner as a musician is directed by the notes of
music to produce that harmoniou s trai n an d composition of
sound, which is called a tune] though they who hear the music
do no t perceiv e th e notes , an d ma y be entirel y ignoran t of
them. Bu t thi s notio n o f matte r seem s to o extravagan t t o
deserve a  confutation . Besides, i t i s i n effec t n o objectio n
against what we have advanced, to wit, that there is no sense-
less, unperceived substance.
72. I f w e follo w th e ligh t o f reason , w e shall , fro m th e
constant uniform method of our sensations, collect the good-
ness and wisdom of the spirit who excites them in our minds.
But this is all that I can see reasonably concluded from thence.
To me , I say, it is evident that th e bein g o f a spirit infinitely
wise, good, and powerful i s abundantly sufficient to explain all
the appearance s o f Nature. But a s for inert  senseless matter,

explain any the meanest phenomenon in Nature by it, or shew
any manne r o f reason , thoug h i n th e lowes t ran k o f prob -
ability, that h e can have for its existence; or even make any
tolerable sens e o r meaning of that supposition . For a s to its
being an occasion, we have, I think, evidently shewn that with
regard to us it is no occasion: it remains therefore that it must
be, i f at all , the occasio n to Go d o f exciting ideas in us; and
what this amounts to, we have just now seen.
73. I t is worth while to reflect a little on the motives which
induced men to suppose th e existence of material substance ;
that so having observed the gradual ceasing, and expiration of
those motive s or reasons , w e may proportionably withdraw
the assent that was grounded on them. First therefore, it was
thought tha t colour , figure, motion, an d th e res t o f the sen -
sible qualities or accidents, did really exist without the mind;
and fo r thi s reason, i t seemed needfu l to suppos e som e un -
thinking substratum or substance wherein they did exist, since
they coul d no t b e conceive d t o exis t b y themselves . After -
wards, in process of time, men being convinced that colours,
sounds, and the rest of the sensible secondary qualities had no
existence without the mind, they stripped thi s substratum o r
material substance of those qualities, leaving only the primary
ones, figure, motion, and such like, which they still conceived
to exist without the mind, and consequently to stand in need
of a  material support. Bu t i t having been shewn, that none ,
even of these, can possibly exist otherwise than in a spirit or
mind which perceives them, it follows that we have no longer
any reaso n t o suppos e th e bein g o f matter.  Nay , tha t i t is
utterly impossible there should be any such thing, so long as
that wor d i s take n t o denot e a n unthinking  substratum  o f
qualities or accidents, wherein they exist without the mind.
74. Bu t though it be allowed by the materialists themselves
,
that matte r wa s though t o f onl y for th e sak e o f supporting
accidents; and the reason entirel y ceasing, one might expect
the mind should naturally, and without any reluctance a t all,
quit the belief of what was solely grounded thereon. Yet th e
prejudice i s riveted s o deepl y i n ou r thoughts , that w e ca n
scarce tell how to part with it, and are therefore inclined, since
the thing  itsel f i s indefensible, at leas t t o retai n th e name',

which we apply to I know not what abstracted and indefinite
notions o f being,  o r occasion,  though withou t an y she w o r
reason, a t least so far as I can see. For wha t is there on ou r
part, or what do we perceive amongst all the ideas, sensations,
notions, which are imprinted on our minds, either by sense or
reflexion, fro m whenc e may b e inferre d the existenc e of a n
inert, thoughtless , unperceived occasion ? an d o n th e othe r
hand, on the part of an all-sufficient spirit,  what can there be
that should make us believe, or even suspect, he is directed by
an inert occasion to excite ideas in our minds?
75. I t is a very extraordinary instance of the force of preju-
dice, and much to be lamented, that the mind of man retains
so great a  fondness against all the evidenc e o f reason, for a
stupid thoughtless somewhat, b y the interposition whereof it
would, as it were, screen itsel f from th e providenc e o f God ,
and remove him farther off from the affair s o f the world. But
though we do the utmost we can, to secure the belief of matter,
though whe n reaso n forsake s us, we endeavou r t o suppor t
our opinio n o n the bar e possibility of the thing , and though
we indulge ourselves in the ful l scop e of an imagination no t
regulated by reason, to make out that poor possibility, yet the
upshot o f all is, that ther e ar e certai n unknown  ideas  i n th e
mind of God; for this, if anything, is all that I conceive t o b e
meant by occasion with regard to God. And this , at the bot-
tom, is no longer contending for the thing, but for the name.
76. Whethe r therefor e there ar e such ideas in the mind of
God, an d whether the y may be called by the name matter, I
shall not dispute. But if you stick to the notion of an unthink-
ing substance , o r suppor t o f extension , motion , an d othe r
sensible qualities, then t o me it is most evidentl y impossible
there should be any such thing. Since it is a plain repugnancy,
that thos e qualitie s shoul d exis t i n o r b e supporte d b y a n
unperceiving substance.
77. Bu t sa y you , thoug h i t b e grante d tha t ther e i s n o
thoughtless suppor t o f extension , an d th e othe r qualitie s
or accident s which we perceive; yet there may, perhaps, b e
some iner t unperceivin g substance , o r substratum  o f som e
other qualities , as incomprehensible to us as colours are to a
man born blind, because we have not a sense adapted to them.


58 Principles:
 Part I
But if we had a new sense, we should possibly no more doubt
of their existence, tha n a  blind man made t o see does of the
existence of light and colours. I answer, first, if what you mean
by the word matter be only the unknown support of unknown
qualities, i t i s n o matte r whethe r ther e i s suc h a  thin g o r
no, since it no way concerns us: and I do not see the advantage
there i s in disputing about we know not what,  and we know
not why.
78. Bu t secondly , i f w e ha d a  ne w sense , i t coul d onl y
furnish u s with new ideas or sensations: and then w e should
have the same reason against their existing in an unperceiving
substance, tha t ha s bee n alread y offere d wit h relatio n t o
figure, motion, colour , an d th e like . Qualities, a s hath bee n
shewn, ar e nothin g else bu t sensations  or ideas,  which exist
only in a mind perceiving them; and this is true not only of the
ideas we ar e acquainte d wit h at present , bu t likewis e o f all
possible ideas whatsoever.
79. Bu t you will insist, what if I have no reason to believ e
the existence of matter, what if I cannot assign any use to it, or
explain anything by it, or even conceive what is meant by that
word? Yet still it is no contradiction to say that matter exists,
and tha t thi s matter is in general a substance, or occasion  of
ideas', though, indeed, to go about to unfold the meaning, or
adhere to an y particular explicatio n o f those words , may be
attended with great difficulties. I answer, when words are used
without a meaning, you may put them together as you please,
without danger of running into a contradiction. You may say,
for example , that twice  two is equal to seven, so long as you
declare you do not take the words of that proposition in their
usual acceptation, but for marks of you know not what. And
by the same reason you may say, there is an inert thoughtless
substance withou t accidents , whic h i s th e occasio n o f ou r
ideas. An d w e shal l understan d jus t a s muc h b y on e pro -
position, as the other .
80. I n th e las t place, you wil l say , what if we give up th e
cause o f materia l substance , an d assert , tha t matte r i s a n
unknown somewhat, neither substance nor accident, spirit nor
idea, inert, thoughtless, indivisible, immoveable, unextended,
existing i n no place ? For , sa y you, whatever may be urge d


Principles: Part I 5

against substance or occasion, or any other positive or relative
notion of matter, hath no place at all, so long as this negative
definition o f matter is adhered to . I answer, you may, if so it
shall seem good, use the word matter in the same sense, that
other me n use nothing, and so make those terms convertible
in your style. For after all, this is what appears to me to be the
result o f that definition , th e part s whereo f whe n I  conside r
with attention , eithe r collectively , o r separat e fro m eac h
other, I  d o no t fin d tha t ther e i s any kin d o f effec t o r im-
pression made on my mind, different fro m wha t is excited by
the term nothing.
81. Yo u will reply perhaps, that in the foresaid definition is
included, what dot h sufficientl y distinguis h it fro m nothing ,
the positive , abstract ide a o f quiddity, entity,  or existence.  I
own indeed, that those who pretend to the faculty of framing
abstract genera l ideas , do tal k a s i f they ha d suc h a n idea ,
which is, say they, the most abstract and general notion of all,
that i s to m e th e mos t incomprehensibl e o f all others. Tha t
there ar e a  grea t variet y o f spirit s o f differen t order s an d
capacities, whose faculties, both in number and extent, are far
exceeding those the Author of my being has bestowed on me,
I see no reason to deny. And for me to pretend to determine
by m y ow n few , stinted, narro w inlets o f perception , wha t
ideas the inexhaustible power of the Supreme Spirit may im-
print upo n them , wer e certainl y the utmos t foll y an d pre -
sumption. Sinc e ther e ma y be , fo r augh t tha t I  know ,
innumerable sorts of ideas or sensations, as different from one
another, an d fro m al l that I  have perceived , a s colours ar e
from sounds . But how ready soever I may be, to acknowledge
the scantiness of my comprehension, wit h regard to the end -
less variety of spirits and ideas, that might possibly exist, yet
for an y on e t o preten d t o a  notio n o f entit y o r existence ,
abstracted fro m spirit  an d idea,  fro m perceivin g an d bein g
perceived, is, I suspect, a downright repugnancy and triflin g
with words. It remains that we consider the objections, which
may possibly be made on the part of religion.
82. Som e there are* who think, that though the arguments
for the real existence of bodies, which are drawn from reason ,
be allowe d no t t o amoun t t o demonstration , ye t th e Hol y

Scriptures ar e s o clear i n the point , a s will sufficiently con -
vince ever y goo d Christian , tha t bodie s d o reall y exist, and
are somethin g mor e tha t mer e ideas ; ther e bein g i n Hol y
Writ innumerable fact s related , which evidently suppose th e
reality of timber, and stone, mountains, and rivers, and cities,
and human bodies. To which I answer, that no sort of writings
whatever, sacre d o r profane , whic h us e thos e an d th e lik e
words in the vulgar acceptation, or so as to have a meaning in
them, are in danger of having their truth called in question by
our doctrine. That al l those thing s do really exist, that ther e
are bodies , eve n corporea l substances , whe n take n i n th e
vulgar sense , ha s been show n t o b e agreeabl e t o ou r prin -
ciples: an d th e differenc e betwixt things  an d ideas,  realities
and chimeras,  has bee n distinctl y explained. An d I  d o no t
think, that eithe r wha t philosophers cal l matter, or the exist-
ence o f objects without the mind , is anywhere mentioned i n
Scripture.
83. Again, whether ther e be, or be not externa l things , it
is agreed o n al l hands, that th e prope r us e o f words, is th e
marking ou t conceptions , o r thing s onl y as they ar e know n
and perceive d b y us ; whenc e i t plainl y follows , tha t i n
the tenet s w e have laid down, there i s nothing inconsisten t
with the righ t us e and significanc y o f language, and that dis -
course o f what kind soever, so far as it is intelligible, remains
undisturbed. But al l this seems s o manifest, from wha t hath
been set forth in the premises, that it is needless to insist any
farther o n it.
84. Bu t it will be urged, that miracles do, at least, lose much
of thei r stres s an d impor t b y ou r principles . Wha t mus t we
think of Moses's rod, was it not really turned into a serpent, or
was ther e onl y a  chang e o f ideas  i n th e mind s o f th e spec -
tators? And can it be supposed, that our Saviour did no more
at the marriage-feast in Cana, than impose on the sight , and
smell, and  tast e of  the  guests , so  as  to  creat e in  the m the
appearance o r idea only of wine? The same may be said of all
other miracles: which, in consequence o f the foregoing prin-
ciples, must be looked upon only as so many cheats, or illusion
of fancy. To this I reply, that the rod was changed into a real
serpent, an d the water into rea l wine . That this doth not , in


Principles: Part I 6

the least , contradict what I have elsewhere said , will be evi-
dent fro m sects . 34 and 35 . But thi s business of real and im -
aginary hat h been already so plainly and fully explained , and
so often referre d to, and the difficultie s abou t it are so easily
answered from what hath gone before, that it were an affron t
to the reader's understanding , to resume the explication of it
in this place. I shall only observe, that if at table all who were
present shoul d see, and smell, and taste, and drink wine, and
find the effect s o f it, with me ther e coul d be n o doub t o f its
reality. So that, a t bottom, th e scrupl e concernin g rea l mir -
acles hath n o plac e a t al l on ours , but onl y on th e receive d
principles, an d consequently maket h rathe r for, tha n against
what hath been said.
85. Havin g done with the objections, which I endeavoure d
to propose in the cleares t light , and gav e them al l the forc e
and weight I could, we proceed in the next place to take a view
of our tenets in their consequences. Som e of these appea r a t
first sight, as that severa l difficul t an d obscur e questions , o n
which abundance o f speculation hat h been throw n away, are
entirely banishe d fro m philosophy . Whethe r corporea l sub -
stance can think? Whether matter be infinitely divisible? And
how it operates o n spirit ? thes e an d th e lik e inquirie s hav e
given infinite amusemen t t o philosophers i n all ages. But de -
pending on the existenc e o f matter, they have no longer any
place on our principles. Many other advantage s there are , as
well with regard t o religion  as the sciences,  which it is easy
for anyone to deduce from what hath been premised. But this
will appear mor e plainl y in the sequel .
86. From the principles we have laid down, it follows, hu -
man knowledge may naturally be reduced t o two heads, that
of ideas,  and tha t o f spirits. Of each o f these I  shall treat i n
order. An d first as to ideas or unthinking things, our know-
ledge o f thes e hat h bee n ver y muc h obscure d an d con -
founded, and we have been led into very dangerous errors, by
supposing a twofold existence of the objects of sense, the on e
intelligible, o r i n th e mind , th e othe r real  an d withou t th e
mind: whereby unthinking things are thought to have a natu-
ral subsistence o f their own, distinct from being perceived by
spirits. This which, if I mistake not, hath been shew n to be a


62 Principles:
 Part I
most groundless an d absurd notion, is the very root of scepti-
cism', fo r s o lon g a s men though t tha t rea l thing s subsiste d
without the mind , and tha t thei r knowledge was only so far
forth real as it was conformable to real things, it follows, they
could not be certain that they had any real knowledge at all.
For how can it be known, that the things which are perceived,
are conformabl e t o thos e whic h are no t perceived , o r exis t
without the mind?
87. Colour , figure , motion , extensio n an d th e like , con -
sidered only as so many sensations in the mind, are perfectly
known, there bein g nothing in them which is not perceived .
But if they are looked on as notes or images, referred to things
or archetypes* existing without the mind, then are we involved
all in scepticism. W e se e only th e appearances , an d no t th e
real qualities of things. What may be the extension, figure, or
motion o f anythin g really an d absolutely , o r i n itself , i t i s
impossible fo r u s t o know , but onl y th e proportio n o r th e
relation they bear to our senses. Things remaining the same,
our idea s vary, an d whic h of them, o r eve n whethe r an y of
them a t al l represent th e tru e qualit y reall y existin g i n th e
thing, it is out of our reach to determine. So that, for aught we
know, all we see, hear, an d feel , ma y be onl y phantom an d
vain chimera, and not at all agree with the real things, existing
in rerum natura. All this scepticism follows, from ou r suppos-
ing a difference between things and ideas, and that the former
have a subsistence without the mind, or unperceived. It were
easy t o dilat e o n thi s subject, and she w how the arguments
urged b y sceptics  i n al l ages , depend o n th e suppositio n o f
external objects.
88. S o long as we attribute a  real existence to unthinking '
things, distinct from thei r being perceived, it is not onl y im-
possible for us to know with evidence the nature of any real
unthinking being, but eve n that it exists. Hence it is, that we
see philosophers distrust their senses, and doubt of the exist-
ence of heaven and earth, of everything they see or feel, even
of their own bodies. And afte r all their labour and struggle of
thought, they are forced to own, we cannot attain to any self-
evident or demonstrative knowledge of the existenc e of sen-
sible things. But all this doubtfulness, which so bewilders and


Principles: Part I 6
3
confounds the mind, and makes philosophy ridiculous in the
eyes o f th e world , vanishes , i f we anne x a  meanin g t o ou r
words, and do not amus e ourselve s with the term s absolute,
external, exist,  and suc h like, signifying w e know not what . I
can a s well doubt o f my own being, as of the bein g of those
things which I actually perceive b y sense: it being a manifest
contradiction, that any sensible object should be immediately
perceived b y sigh t or touch , an d a t th e sam e tim e hav e n o
existence in Nature, since the very existence of an unthinking
being consists in being perceived.
89. Nothin g seems of more importance, toward s erecting a
firm system of sound and real knowledge, which may be proof
against the assaults of scepticism, than to lay the beginning in
a distinct explication o f what is meant b y thing, reality, exist-
ence: for in vain shall we dispute concerning the real existence
of things, or pretend t o any knowledge thereof, so long as we
have not fixed the meanin g of those words. Thing or being is
the mos t genera l nam e o f all , it comprehend s unde r i t tw o
kinds entirel y distinc t an d heterogeneous , an d whic h hav e
nothing common but the name , to wit, spirits an d ideas. The
former ar e active,  indivisible substances: the latte r ar e inert,
fleeting, dependent  beings,  which subsis t no t b y themselves,
but are supported by, or exist in minds or spiritual substances.
We comprehen d ou r ow n existenc e b y inwar d feelin g o r
reflexion, and that of other spirits by reason.* We may be said
to have some knowledge or notion of our own minds, of spirits
and active beings, whereof in a strict sense we have not ideas.
In like manne r w e know an d have a  notion o f relations be -
tween thing s o r ideas , whic h relations ar e distinc t fro m th e
ideas o r thing s related , inasmuc h a s the latte r ma y be per -
ceived b y u s withou t ou r perceivin g th e former . T o m e i t
seems that ideas, spirits and relations are all in their respective
kinds, th e objec t o f huma n knowledg e an d subjec t o f dis -
course: and that the term idea would be improperly extended
to signify everythin g we know or have any notion of .
90. Idea s imprinte d o n th e sense s ar e rea l things , or d o
really exist; this we do not deny, but we deny they can subsist
without the minds which perceive them , or that the y are re-
semblances of any archetypes existing without the mind: since


64 Principles:
 Part I
the ver y being o f a sensation o r ide a consist s i n being per -
ceived, and an idea can be like nothing but an idea. Again, the
things perceived by sense may be termed external, with regard
to their origin, in that they are not generated from within, by
the min d itself , bu t imprinte d b y a  spiri t distinct fro m tha t
which perceives them. Sensible object s may likewise be said
to be without the mind, in another sense , namely when they
exist in some other mind. Thus when I shut my eyes, the things
I saw may still exist, but i t must be in another mind. *
91. I t were a mistake to think, that what is here said dero-
gates in the least from the reality of things. It is acknowledged
on the receive d principles, tha t extension , motion , an d in a
word al l sensibl e qualities , have nee d o f a  support , a s no t
being able to subsist by themselves. But the objects perceived
by sense, are allowed to be nothing but combinations of those
qualities, an d consequentl y canno t subsis t b y themselves .
Thus far it is agreed on all hands. So that in denying the things
perceived by sense, an existence independent of a substance,
or support wherei n they may exist, we detract nothin g fro m
the receive d opinio n o f thei r reality,  an d ar e guilt y o f n o
innovation in that respect. All the difference is, that according
to us the unthinking beings perceived by sense, have no exist-
ence distinct from being perceived, and cannot therefore exis t
in an y othe r substance , tha n thos e unextended , indivisible
substances, or spirits, which act, and think, and perceive them:
whereas philosophers vulgarly hold
, that the sensible qualities
exist i n a n inert , extended , unperceivin g substance , whic h
they call matter, to which they attribute a natural subsistence,
exterior t o al l thinkin g beings , o r distinc t fro m bein g per -
ceived by any mind whatsoever, even the eternal mind of the
Creator, wherei n the y suppos e onl y idea s o f th e corporea l
substances created by him: if indeed they allow them to be at
all created.
92. Fo r a s we have shew n the doctrin e o f matter o r cor -
poreal substance, to have been the main pillar and support of
scepticism, so likewise upon th e sam e foundation have been
raised all the impious schemes of atheism and irreligion. Nay
so great a  difficulty hat h it been thought , to conceive matter
produced out of nothing, that the most celebrated amon g the


Principles: Part I 6
5
ancient philosophers, eve n of these who maintained the being
of a God, have thought matter to be uncreated and coeternal*
with him. How great a friend material substance hath been to
atheists i n al l ages , wer e needles s t o relate . Al l thei r mon -
strous systems have so visible and necessary a dependence o n
it, tha t whe n thi s corner-stone i s once removed , th e whol e
fabric cannot choose but fall to the ground; insomuch that it is
no longer worthwhile, to bestow a particular consideration on
the absurditie s of every wretched sec t of atheists.
93. Tha t impiou s an d profan e person s shoul d readil y fal l
in with those system s which favour thei r inclinations, by de-
riding immateria l substance , an d supposin g th e sou l t o b e
divisible and subject to corruption as the body; which exclude
all freedom, intelligence, an d desig n fro m th e formatio n of
things, an d instea d thereo f mak e a  self-existent , stupid, un-
thinking substance the root and origin of all beings. That they
should hearken to those who deny a providence, or inspection
of a superior mind over the affairs of the world, attributing the
whole series of events either to blind chance or fatal necessity,
arising fro m th e impuls e o f on e bod y o n another . Al l thi s
is very natural. And o n the othe r hand , when men o f bette r
principles observe the enemies of religion lay so great a stress
on unthinking  matter,  and al l of them us e s o much industry
and artific e t o reduce everythin g to it; methinks they should
rejoice t o se e the m deprive d o f thei r gran d support , an d

cureans, Hobbists, an d the like, have not even the shadow of
a pretence, bu t become th e most chea p an d easy triumph in
the world.
94. Th e existenc e o f matter , o r bodie s unperceived , ha s
not only been the main support of atheists and fatalists, but on
the sam e principl e dot h idolatry  likewis e i n al l it s variou s
forms depend. Di d men but consider tha t the sun, moon, and
stars, and every other objec t of the senses , are only so many
sensations i n their minds, which have no other existenc e bu t
barely being perceived, doubtless they would never fall down,
and worship their own ideas', but rather address their homage
to tha t eterna l invisibl e Min d whic h produce s an d sustain s
all things.*

95. Th e sam e absurd principle, by mingling itself with the
articles of our faith , hat h occasioned n o smal l difficulties t o
Christians. Fo r example , abou t th e resurrection,  how many
scruples an d objection s have been raise d b y Socinians* and
others? But do not the most plausible of them depend on the
supposition, that a body is denominated the same, with regard
not t o th e for m or that which is perceived b y sense, but th e
material substanc e whic h remain s th e sam e unde r severa l
forms? Take away this material substance, about the identity
whereof all the dispute is, and mean by body what every plain
ordinary perso n mean s b y tha t word , t o wit , that whic h is
immediately see n an d felt , whic h is onl y a  combinatio n o f
sensible qualities, or ideas: and then their most unanswerable
objections come to nothing.
96. Matte r being once expelled out of Nature, drags with it
so man y sceptica l an d impiou s notions , suc h a n incredibl e
number of disputes and puzzling questions, which have been
thorns i n th e side s o f divines , as wel l a s philosophers , an d
made s o much fruitles s wor k for mankind ; that i f the argu -
ments w e have produce d agains t it , are no t foun d equal t o
demonstration (as to me they evidently seem) yet I am sure all
friends to knowledge, peace, and religion, have reason to wish
they were.
97. Besid e the externa l existence of the object s of percep-
tion, another grea t sourc e o f errors an d difficulties , wit h re-
gard to ideal knowledge, is the doctrine of abstract ideas, such
as i t hat h bee n se t fort h i n th e Introduction . Th e plaines t
things in the world, those we are most intimately acquainted
with, an d perfectl y know, whe n the y ar e considere d i n a n
abstract way, appear strangely difficult and incomprehensible.
Time, place, and motion, taken in particular or concrete, ar e
what everybody knows; but having passed through the hands
of a metaphysician, they become too abstrac t and fine, to be
apprehended b y me n o f ordinar y sense . Bi d you r servan t

to deliberat e o n th e meanin g o f those words : in conceiving
that particular time and place, or the motion by which he is to

taken, exclusive of all those particular actions and ideas that
diversify the day, merely for the continuation of existence, or
duration in abstract, then it will perhaps gravel even a philo-
sopher t o comprehend it.
98. Wheneve r I  attemp t t o fram e a  simpl e ide a o f time,
abstracted fro m th e successio n o f idea s i n m y mind , which
flows uniformly, and is participated by all beings, I am lost and
embrangled in inextricable difficulties . I  have no notion of it
at all, only I hear others say, it is infinitely divisible, and speak
of it in such a manner as leads me to entertain odd thoughts of
my existence: since that doctrine lays one under an absolut e
necessity of thinking, either that he passes away innumerable
ages withou t a thought, o r els e tha t h e i s annihilated every
moment o f hi s life : bot h whic h see m equall y absurd. Tim e
therefore bein g nothing , abstracte d fro m th e successio n o f
ideas in our minds,* it follows that the duratio n o f any finite
spirit mus t be estimate d b y the numbe r o f ideas o r action s
succeeding each other in that same spirit or mind. Hence it is
a plain consequence tha t the soul always thinks:* and in truth
whoever shall go about t o divide in his thoughts, or abstrac t
the existence  of a spirit from its cogitation, will, I believe, find

TOO. Wha t it is for a man to be happy, or an object good,*
everyone may think he knows. But to frame a n abstract idea
of happiness,  prescinde d fro m al l particular pleasure , o r o f
goodness, from everythin g that is good, this is what few can
pretend to . S o likewise , a  ma n ma y b e jus t an d virtuous ,
without having precise ideas of justice and virtue. The opinion
that thos e an d th e lik e words stand fo r genera l notions ab -
stracted from all particular persons and actions, seems to have
rendered morality difficult, and the study thereof of less use to
mankind. And i n effect, th e doctrine of abstraction has not a
little contribute d toward s spoilin g th e mos t usefu l part s of
knowledge.
101. Th e tw o grea t provinces of speculative science, con-
versant abou t idea s received fro m sens e an d their relations ,
are natural philosophy an d mathematics', with regard to each
of these I shall make some observations. And first, I shall say
somewhat of natural philosophy. On this subject it is, that the
sceptics triumph : all that stock of arguments they produce t o
depreciate our faculties, and make mankind appear ignoran t
and low, are drawn principally from thi s head, to wit, that we
are under an invincible blindness as to the true and real nature
of things. This they exaggerate, and love to enlarge on. We are
miserably bantered, say they, by our senses, and amused only
with th e outsid e an d she w o f things . The rea l essence , th e
internal qualities, and constitutio n of every the meanes t ob -
ject, is hid from ou r view; something there is in every drop of
water, every grain of sand, which it is beyond th e powe r of
human understandin g t o fatho m o r comprehend . Bu t i t is
evident fro m wha t has been shewn, that al l this complaint is
groundless, an d that we are influenced by false principles to
that degre e a s t o mistrus t ou r senses , an d thin k w e kno w
nothing of those things which we perfectly comprehend.
102. On e grea t inducemen t t o ou r pronouncing ourselves
ignorant o f the natur e o f things, is the curren t opinio n tha t
everything includes within itself the cause of its properties: or
that ther e i s in each objec t a n inwar d essence , whic h is th e
source whence its discernible qualities flow, and whereon they
depend. Some have pretended t o account for appearances by
occult qualities , bu t o f lat e the y ar e mostl y resolve d int o

mechanical causes, to wit, the figure, motion, weight, and such
like qualities of insensible particles:* whereas in truth, there is
no other agen t or efficien t caus e than spirit, it being evident
that motion, a s well as all other ideas, is perfectly inert. Se e
sect. 25 . Hence, t o endeavou r t o explai n the productio n o f
colours or sounds, by figure, motion, magnitude and the like,
must need s b e labou r i n vain. And accordingly , we see th e
attempts of that kind are not at all satisfactory. Which may be
said, in general, of those instances, wherein one idea or qual-
ity is assigned for th e caus e o f another. I  need no t say , how
many hypotheses and speculations are left out, and how much
the stud y of Nature is abridged by this doctrine.
103. Th e great mechanical principle now in vogue is attrac-
tion. That a  stone falls to the earth, or the sea swells towards
the moon, may to some appear sufficiently explained thereby.
But ho w ar e w e enlightene d by bein g tol d thi s i s done b y
attraction? I s i t tha t tha t wor d signifie s th e manne r o f th e
tendency, an d tha t i t i s b y th e mutua l drawin g o f bodies ,
instead o f thei r bein g impelle d o r protrude d toward s eac h
other? But nothing is determined of the manner or action, and
it ma y a s trul y (fo r augh t w e know ) be terme d impulse  o r
protrusion a s attraction. Again, the part s o f steel w e see co-
here firmly together, and this also is accounted for by attrac-
tion; but i n this, as in the othe r instances , I do not perceiv e
that anything is signified besides the effec t itself ; for as to th e
manner o f th e actio n whereb y it i s produced, o r th e caus e
which produces it, these are not so much as aimed at.
104. Indeed , i f we take a  view of the severa l phenomena,
and compare the m together, we may observe som e likeness
and conformity between them. For example , in the falling of
a ston e t o th e ground , in the risin g o f the se a toward s th e
moon, i n cohesio n an d crystallization , there i s somethin g
alike, namely an union or mutual approach of bodies. So that
any one of these or the like phenomena, may not seem strange
or surprisin g to a  man wh o hat h nicel y observed an d com -
pared the effects o f Nature. For that only is thought so which
is uncommon , or a  thin g by itself , an d ou t o f th e ordinar y
course of our observation . That bodie s shoul d tend towards
the centr e o f the earth , is not though t strange , because i t is


70 Principles:
 Part I
what w e perceive every moment o f our lives . But tha t the y
should have a like gravitation towards the centre of the moon,
may seem odd and unaccountable to most men, because it is
discerned only in the tides. But a philosopher, whose thoughts
take in a larger compass of Nature, having observed a certain
similitude of appearances, as well in the heavens as the earth,
that argu e innumerabl e bodie s t o hav e a  mutua l tendenc y
towards eac h other , whic h he denote s b y the genera l nam e
attraction, whatever can be reduced t o that , he think s justly
accounted for. Thus he explains the tides by the attraction of
the terraqueous glob e towards the moon, which to him doth
not appear odd or anomalous, bu t only a particular exampl e
of a general rule or law of Nature.
105. I f therefore we consider the difference there is betwixt
natural philosopher s an d othe r men , wit h regar d t o thei r
knowledge of the phenomena, we shall find it consists, not in
an exacte r knowledg e o f th e efficien t caus e tha t produce s
them, for that can be no other than the will of a spirit, but only
in a greater largeness of comprehension, whereby analogies,
harmonies, an d agreement s ar e discovere d i n th e work s of
Nature, and the particular effects explained , that is, reduced
to genera l rules , see sect . 62 , which rules grounde d o n th e
analogy, and uniformness observed in the production of natu-
ral effects, ar e most agreeable, and sought after b y the mind;
for that they extend our prospect beyond what is present, and
near to us, and enable us to make very probable conjectures,
touching thing s that ma y hav e happene d a t ver y great dis -
tances of time and place, as well as to predict things to come;
which sor t o f endeavou r toward s omniscience , i s muc h af -
fected b y the mind.
106. Bu t w e shoul d proceed waril y in such things : for w e
are ap t t o la y to o grea t a  stres s o n analogies , an d t o th e
prejudice o f truth , humou r tha t eagernes s o f th e mind ,
whereby i t i s carried t o exten d it s knowledg e int o genera l
theorems. For example, gravitation, or mutual attraction, be-
cause it appears i n many instances, some are straightwa y for
pronouncing universal'* and that to attract, and be attracted by
every other  body, is  an essential quality inherent in all bodies
whatsoever. Whereas it appears th e fixed stars have no such

tendency toward s each other : and s o far i s that gravitation,
from being essential to bodies, that, in some instances a quite
contrary principle seems to shew itself: as in the perpendicu -
lar growt h o f plants , an d th e elasticit y of th e air . Ther e is
nothing necessar y o r essentia l i n th e case , bu t i t depend s
entirely on the will of the governing spirit, who causes certain
bodies to cleave together, or tend towards each other, accord-
ing to various laws, whilst he keeps others at a fixed distance;
and to some he gives a quite contrary tendency to fly asunder,
just as he sees convenient.
107. Afte r wha t ha s bee n premised , I  thin k w e ma y la y
down the following conclusions. First, it is plain philosophers
amuse themselves in vain, when they inquire for any natural
efficient cause , distinct from a  mind o r spirit. Secondly, con-
sidering the whole creation is the workmanship of a wise and
good agent, it should seem to become philosophers, to employ
their thought s (contrary to what some hold ) about th e final
causes o f things : and I  mus t confess , I se e n o reason , wh y
pointing ou t th e variou s ends , t o whic h natura l thing s ar e
adapted, and for which they were originally with unspeakable
wisdom contrived , shoul d no t b e though t on e goo d wa y of
accounting fo r them , an d altogethe r worth y a  philosopher .
Thirdly, fro m wha t hat h bee n premise d n o reaso n ca n b e
drawn, why the history of Nature should not still be studied,
and observations and experiments made, which, that they are
of use to mankind, and enable us to draw any general conclu-
sions, is not th e resul t o f any immutable habitudes, or rela -
tions between things themselves, but only of God's goodness
and kindness to men in the administratio n of the world . See
sects. 3 0 and 31 . Fourthly , by a  diligen t observation o f th e
phenomena withi n ou r view , we ma y discove r th e genera l
laws of Nature, and from them deduce the other phenomena,
I do not sa y demonstrate', for al l deductions o f that kind de-
pend on a supposition that the Author of Nature always oper-
ates uniformly, and in a constant observance of those rules we
take for principles: which we cannot evidently know.
108. Thos e men * wh o fram e genera l rule s fro m th e
phenomena, an d afterward s deriv e th e phenomen a fro m
those rules, seem to consider signs rather than causes. A man


72 Principles:

may wel l understan d natura l sign s withou t knowin g thei r
analogy, o r bein g abl e t o sa y by what rul e a  thin g i s so o r
so. And a s it is very possible to write improperly, through too
strict a n observance o f general grammar-rules: so in arguing
from genera l rule s o f Nature , i t i s no t impossibl e w e ma y
extend th e analog y to o far , an d b y tha t mean s ru n int o
mistakes.
109. A s in reading other books, a wise man will choose t o
fix his thoughts on the sens e and apply it to use, rather tha n
lay them ou t i n grammatical remarks on the language ; so in
perusing the volume of Nature, it seems beneath the dignity o
f
the min d t o affec t a n exactnes s i n reducing eac h particula r
phenomenon t o general rules, or shewing how it follows fro m
them. We should propose to ourselves nobler views, such as to
recreate an d exal t th e mind , with a  prospect o f the beauty ,
order, extent, and variety of natural things: hence, by proper
inferences, t o enlarg e ou r notion s o f the grandeur , wisdom,
and beneficence of the Creator: and lastly, to make the several
parts o f the Creation , s o far a s in us lies, subservient to th e
ends they were designed for, God's glory, and the sustentation
and comfort of ourselves and fellow-creatures.
no. Th e bes t ke y fo r th e aforesai d analogy , o r natura l
science, will be easily acknowledged to be a certain celebrated
treatise of mechanics: in the entrance of which justly admired
treatise,* time , spac e an d motion , ar e distinguishe d int o
absolute an d relative,  true  an d apparent,  mathematical  an d
vulgar: whic h distinction , a s i t i s a t larg e explaine d by th e
author, dot h suppos e thos e quantitie s t o hav e a n existenc e
without the mind: and that they are ordinarily conceived with
relation to sensible things, to which nevertheless in their own
nature, they bear no relation a t all.
in. A s fo r time,  a s i t i s ther e take n i n a n absolut e o r
abstracted sense, for the duration or perseverance of the exist-
ence of things, I have nothing more to add concerning it, after
what hath been alread y said on that subject, sects. 97 and 98.
For the rest, this celebrated autho r holds there is an absolute
space, which, being unperceivable to sense , remains in itself
similar and immoveable: and relative space to be the measure


Principles: Part I 7

thereof, which being moveable, and defined by its situation in
respect o f sensible bodies, i s vulgarly taken fo r immoveable
space. Place  h e define s t o b e tha t par t o f spac e whic h is
occupied by any body. And accordin g as the space is absolute
or relative, so also is the place. Absolute motion is said to be
the translatio n o f a  bod y fro m absolut e plac e t o absolut e
place, as relative motion is from one relative place to another.
And because the parts of absolute space, do not fall under our
senses, instead o f them we are oblige d to us e their sensibl e
measures: and so define both place and motion with respect to
bodies, whic h w e regar d a s immoveable . Bu t i t i s said , in
philosophical matters we must abstract from our senses, sinc e
it may be, that none of those bodies which seem to be quies-
cent, ar e trul y so: and th e sam e thin g which is moved rela -
tively, may be reall y at rest . A s likewis e one an d th e sam e
body may be in relative rest and motion, or even moved with
contrary relative motions a t the sam e time , according as its
place is variously defined. All which ambiguity is to be foun d
in the apparent motions , but not at all in the true or absolute ,
which should therefore be alone regarded in philosophy. And
the true , w e ar e told , ar e distinguishe d from apparen t o r
relative motions by the following properties. First, in true or
absolute motion, all  parts whic h preserve the sam e position
with respec t t o th e whole , partak e o f th e motion s o f th e
whole, Secondly, the place being moved, that which is placed
therein is also moved: so that a body moving in a place which
is in motion, doth participate the motion of its place. Thirdly,
true motion is never generated or changed, otherwise than by
force impresse d o n th e bod y itself. Fourthly, true motio n is
always change d b y forc e impresse d o n th e bod y moved .
Fifthly, in circular motion barely relative, there is no centrifu -
gal force, which nevertheless in that which is true or absolute,
is proportional t o the quantity of motion.
112. Bu t notwithstanding what hath been said , it doth no t
appear t o me, that ther e ca n be any motion other tha n rela-
tive: so that to conceive motion , there mus t be a t least con-
ceived two bodies, whereof the distance or position in regard
to eac h othe r i s varied. Henc e i f there wa s on e onl y body


74 Principles:
 Part I
in being, it could not possibly be moved. This seems evident,
in tha t th e ide a I  hav e o f motio n dot h necessaril y includ e
relation.
113. Bu t thoug h i n ever y motion i t b e necessar y t o con -
ceive more bodie s tha n one , ye t i t may be tha t on e onl y is
moved, namely that on which the force causing the change of
distance i s impressed, o r i n othe r words , that t o whic h th e
action is applied. For however some may define relative mo-
tion, so as to term that body moved, which changes its distance
from som e othe r body , whether th e forc e or actio n causing
that change were applied to it, or no: yet as relative motion is
that which is perceived by sense, and regarded in the ordinary
affairs of life, it should seem that every man of common sense
knows what it is, as well as the bes t philosopher : no w I  ask
anyone, whether in his sense of motion as he walks along the
streets, th e stone s h e passes ove r ma y be sai d to move, be-
cause they change distance with his feet? To me it seems, that
though motion includes a relation of one thing to another, yet
it is not necessar y that each term of the relation be denomi -
nated fro m it . As a  man may think of somewhat which dot h
not think, so a body may be moved to or from anothe r body,
which is not therefor e itself in motion.
114. A s th e plac e happen s t o b e variousl y defined , th e
motion which is related t o it varies. A man in a ship may be
said to be quiescent, with relation to the side s of the vessel,
and ye t mov e wit h relatio n t o th e land . O r h e ma y mov e
eastward in respect of the one, and westward in respect of the
other. In the common affairs of life, men never go beyond th e
earth to define the place of any body: and what is quiescent in
respect o f that, is accounted absolutely  to b e so . But philo -
sophers wh o hav e a  greate r exten t o f thought , an d juste r
notions of the syste m of things, discover even the eart h itself
to be moved. In order therefore to fix their notions, they seem
to conceiv e th e corporea l worl d a s finite , an d th e utmos t
unmoved walls or shell thereof to be the place, whereby they
estimate tru e motions . I f we sound ou r ow n conceptions, I
believe we may find all the absolut e motion we can frame a n
idea of , to be a t bottom n o othe r tha n relativ e motio n thu s
defined. For as hath been already observed, absolute motion


Principles: Part I 7
5
exclusive of all external relation is incomprehensible: and t o
this kind of relative motion, all the above-mentioned proper -
ties, causes, and effect s ascribe d to absolute motion , will, if I
mistake not , b e foun d t o agree . A s t o wha t i s sai d o f th e
centrifugal force , tha t i t dot h no t a t al l belon g t o circula r
relative motion: I do not see how this follows from the exper-
iment* whic h i s brough t t o prov e it . Se e Philosophiae
Naturalis Principia  Mathematica,  i n Schol Def.  VIII . For th e
water in the vessel, at that time wherein it is said to have th e
greatest relativ e circular motion, hath, I think, no motion a t
all: as is plain from th e foregoin g section.
115. Fo r to denominate a  body moved, it is requisite, first,
that i t chang e it s distance o r situatio n wit h regard t o som e
other body: and secondly, that the force or action occasioning
that change be applied to it. If either of these be wanting, I do
not thin k tha t agreeabl y t o th e sens e o f mankind , o r th e
propriety of language, a body can be said to be in motion. I
grant indeed, that it is possible fo r us to think a body, which
we se e chang e it s distanc e fro m som e other , t o b e moved ,
though it have no force applied to it (in which sense there may
be apparent motion) , but then it is, because the force causing
the chang e o f distance , i s imagined b y u s t o b e applie d o r
impressed on that body thought to move. Which indeed shews
we are capable o f mistaking a thing to be in motion which is
not, and that is all.
116. Fro m wha t hath been said , it follows tha t th e philo -
sophic consideration o f motion dot h no t impl y the bein g of
an absolute  space,  distinc t fro m tha t whic h i s perceived b y
sense, and related to bodies: which that it cannot exist without
the mind, is clear upon the same principles, that demonstrat e
the lik e o f al l othe r object s o f sense . An d perhaps , i f w e
inquire narrowly, we shall find we cannot even frame a n idea
of pure space, exclusive of all body. This I must confess seems
impossible, a s being a  mos t abstrac t idea . Whe n I  excit e a
motion i n som e par t o f m y body , i f i t b e fre e o r withou t
resistance, I say there is space: but if I find a resistance, then I
say there i s body: an d in proportion a s the resistanc e to mo-
tion is lesser or greater, I say the space is more or \esspure. So
that whe n I  spea k o f pur e o r empt y space , i t i s not t o b e


j6 Principles:
 Part I
supposed, that the word space stands for an idea distinct from,
or conceivable without body and motion. Though indeed we
are ap t t o think every noun substantiv e stands for a distinct
idea, that may be separated fro m al l others: which hath occa-
sioned infinit e mistakes . Whe n therefor e supposin g al l th e
world to be annihilated besides my own body, I say there still
remains pure space: thereb y nothin g els e i s meant, bu t onl y
that I  conceiv e i t possible , fo r th e limb s o f my body t o b e
moved on all sides without the least resistance: but if that too
were annihilated, then there could be no motion, and conse-
quently no space. Some perhaps may think the sense of seeing
doth furnish them with the idea o f pure space; but it is plain
from wha t we have elsewhere shewn , that the idea s of space
and distanc e are no t obtaine d b y that sense . Se e the Essay
concerning Vision.
117. Wha t i s here lai d down, seems t o pu t a n en d t o al l
those disputes and difficulties, which have sprung up amongst
the learned concerning the nature otpure space. But the chief
advantage arisin g fro m it , is , tha t w e ar e free d fro m tha t
dangerous dilemma,  t o whic h severa l wh o hav e employe d
their thoughts* on this subject, imagine themselves reduced ,
to wit, of thinking either tha t real space is God, o r else tha t
there is something besid e Go d whic h is eternal, uncreated ,
infinite, indivisible , immutable . Bot h whic h ma y justl y b e
thought pernicious and absurd notions. It is certain that not a
few divines, as well as philosophers of great note, have, from
the difficulty the y found in conceiving either limits or annihil-
ation of space, concluded it must be divine. And som e of late
have set themselves particularly to shew, that the incommuni-
cable attributes of God agre e to it. Which doctrine, how un-
worthy soever it may seem of the Divine Nature, yet I do not
see ho w we can ge t clea r o f it, so long as we adher e t o th e
received opinions .
118. Hithert o o f natural philosophy: we come now to make
some inquiry concerning that other great branch of speculat-
ive knowledge , to wit , mathematics. These , ho w celebrate d
soever they may be, for their clearness and certainty of dem-
onstration, which is hardly anywhere else to be found, cannot
nevertheless b e supposed altogethe r fre e fro m mistakes ; if in

their principles ther e lurks some secre t error, whic h is com-
mon to the professors of those sciences with the rest of man-
kind. Mathematicians , thoug h the y deduc e thei r theorem s
from a  great height of evidence, yet their first principles ar e
limited b y th e consideratio n o f quantity : an d the y d o no t
ascend int o an y inquir y concernin g thos e transcendenta l
maxims, which influence all the particular sciences, each part
whereof, mathematics not excepted , dot h consequentl y par -
ticipate of the errors involved in them. That the principles laid
down by mathematicians are true, and their way of deduction
from those principles clear and incontestable, we do not deny.
But w e hold , ther e ma y b e certai n erroneou s maxim s of
greater exten t tha n th e objec t o f mathematics, and fo r tha t
reason no t expressl y mentioned , thoug h tacitl y suppose d
throughout the whole progress of that science; and that the ill
effects of those secret unexamined errors are diffused through
all the branche s thereof . To be plain, we suspect th e math -
ematicians are, as well as other men, concerned i n the error s
arising fro m th e doctrin e o f abstrac t genera l ideas , and th e
existence o f objects without the mind.
119. Arithmetic  hat h bee n though t t o hav e fo r it s objec t
abstract ideas of number. Of which to understand the proper -
ties and mutual habitudes is supposed n o mean part of specu-
lative knowledge . The opinio n o f the pur e an d intellectual
nature of numbers in abstract, hath made them in esteem with
those philosophers, who seem to have affected a n uncommon
fineness and elevatio n o f thought. It hath se t a price o n th e
most triflin g numerica l speculations whic h in practice ar e of
no use, but serve only for amusement: and hath therefore so
far infecte d th e mind s o f some , tha t the y hav e dream t o f
mighty mysteries involved in numbers, and attempted th e ex-
plication o f natura l thing s by them . Bu t i f w e inquir e int o
our own thoughts, and consider what hath been premised, we
may perhaps entertain a  low opinion of those high flights and
abstractions, and look on all inquiries about numbers, only as
so many difficiles nugae*  so far as they are not subservient to
practice, and promote th e benefi t o f life.

it plainly follows there is not any such idea. But number being
defined a  collection of units,  we may conclud e that , if there
be no such thing as unity or unit in abstract, there are no ideas
of numbe r i n abstract denote d b y the numerica l names and
figures. Th e theorie s therefor e i n arithmetic , i f the y ar e
abstracted from the names and figures, as likewise from all use
and practice, as well as from th e particular things numbered,
can be supposed to have nothing at all for their object. Hence
we may see, how entirely the scienc e of numbers is subordi-
nate to practice, and how jejune and trifling it becomes, when
considered a s a matter of mere speculation.
121. Howeve r sinc e there may be some , who, deluded by
the speciou s she w o f discoverin g abstracte d verities , waste
their time in arithmetical theorems and problems which have
not any use: it will not be amiss, if we more fully consider, and
expose th e vanit y o f that pretence ; an d thi s will plainly ap-
pear, by taking a view of arithmetic in its infancy, and observ-
ing what it was that originally put me n o n the stud y of that
science, an d t o wha t scope the y directe d it . It i s natural t o
think that at first, men, for ease of memory and help of com-
putation, made use of counters, or in writing of single strokes,
points or the like, each whereof was made to signify a n unit,
that is, some one thing of whatever kind they had occasion t o
reckon. Afterward s they foun d ou t th e mor e compendiou s
ways, o f makin g on e characte r stan d i n plac e o f severa l

being observed throughout, it is easy to read them into words;
and s o the numbe r become s perfectly known . For the n th e

signs being known , we ca n b y th e operation s o f arithmetic,
know the sign s of any part of the particular sums signified by
them; and thus computing in signs (because of the connexion
established betwixt them and the distinct multitudes o
f things,
whereof on e i s taken fo r an unit), we may be abl e rightly to
sum up, divide, and proportion the things themselves that we
intend to number.
122. I n arithmetic  therefore w e regard no t th e things  bu t
the signs, which nevertheless ar e not regarded for their own
sake, but becaus e the y direc t u s how to ac t with relation t o
things, and dispose rightly of them. Now agreeably to what we
have before observed, of words in general (sect . 19 . Introd. )
it happen s her e likewise , that abstrac t idea s ar e though t t o
be signifie d b y numeral names or characters , while they d o
not suggest ideas of particular things to our minds. I shall not
at presen t ente r int o a  mor e particula r dissertatio n o n thi s
subject; bu t onl y observ e tha t i t i s evident fro m wha t hat h
been said , thos e thing s whic h pas s fo r abstrac t truth s an d
theorems concernin g numbers , are , i n reality , conversan t
about n o objec t distinc t fro m particula r numerabl e things ,
except only names and characters; which originally came to be
considered, o n n o othe r accoun t bu t thei r bein g signs, o r
capable t o represen t aptly , whatever particula r thing s me n
had need to compute. Whence it follows, that to study them
for thei r ow n sake * woul d b e jus t a s wise, and t o a s goo d
purpose, as if a man, neglecting the true use or original inten-
tion an d subservienc y of language, should spend hi s time in
impertinent criticisms upon words, or reasonings and contro-
versies purely verbal.
123. Fro m number s w e procee d t o spea k o f extension,
which considered a s relative, is the objec t o f geometry. Th e

supposed, and thought to have so inseparable and essential a
connexion wit h th e principle s an d demonstration s i n geo -
metry, tha t mathematician s neve r admi t i t int o doubt , o r
make the least question of it. And a s this notion is the source
from whenc e d o sprin g all those amusin g geometrical para -
doxes, which have such a direct repugnancy to the plain com-
mon sens e o f mankind , an d ar e admitte d wit h s o muc h
reluctance into a mind not yet debauched by learning: so is it
the principa l occasion o f all that nic e an d extrem e subtlety ,
which renders th e stud y of mathematics so difficult an d tedi -
ous. Hence if we can make it appear, that no finite extension
contains innumerable parts, or is infinitely divisible, it follows
that w e shal l a t onc e clea r th e scienc e o f geometr y fro m a
great numbe r o f difficultie s an d contradictions , which have
ever been esteemed a  reproach t o human reason, and withal
make the attainment thereof a business of much less time and
pains, than it hitherto hath been.
124. Ever y particular finite extension, which may possibly
be th e objec t o f our thought , is an idea  existin g only in th e
mind, and consequently each part thereof must be perceived.
If therefore I cannot perceive innumerable parts in any finite
extension that I consider, it is certain they are not contained in
it: but it is evident, that I cannot distinguish innumerable parts
in any particular line, surface, or solid, which I either perceive
by sense , o r figur e t o mysel f i n my mind: wherefore I  con-
clude they are not contained i n it. Nothing can be plainer t o
me, than that the extensions I have in view are no other than
my own ideas, and it is no less plain, that I cannot resolve any
one of my ideas into an infinite number of other ideas, that is,
that they ar e no t infinitel y divisible . If by finite extension be
 
meant something distinct from a finite idea, I declare I do not
know what that is, and so cannot affirm o r deny anything of it.
But if the terms extension, parts, and the like, are taken in any
sense conceivable, that is, for ideas; then to say a finite quan-
tity or  extensio n consist s of  part s infinit e in  number , is  so
manifest a  contradiction, that everyone at first sight acknow-
ledges it to be so. And i t is impossible it should ever gain the
assent of any reasonable creature, who is not brought to it by
gentle and slow degrees, as a converted Gentil e t o the belief

of transubstantiation. Ancient and rooted prejudices d o often
pass into principles: and those propositions which once obtain
the forc e and credi t o f a principle, ar e no t onl y themselves ,
but likewis e whatever is deducible from them , thought privi-
leged fro m al l examination . An d ther e i s n o absurdit y s o
gross, whic h by thi s mean s th e min d o f ma n ma y no t b e
prepared t o swallow.
125. H e whose understanding is prepossessed with the doc-
trine of abstract general ideas, may be persuaded, that (what-
ever be thought of the ideas of sense), extension in abstract is
infinitely divisible . And on e wh o thinks the object s of sense
exist withou t th e mind , wil l perhap s i n virtu e thereo f b e
brought t o admit , that a  line bu t a n inc h lon g ma y contai n
innumerable parts really existing, though too small to be dis-
cerned. These errors are grafted as well in the minds of geo-
metricians, as of other men, and have a like influence on their
reasonings; an d i t wer e n o difficul t thing , to she w how th e
arguments from geometry made use of to support the infinit e
divisibility of extension, are bottomed on them. At present we
shall only observe in general, whence it is that the mathemat-
icians are all so fond an d tenacious of this doctrine.
126. I t hath been observe d i n another place , that the the -
orems and demonstrations in geometry ar e conversant about
universal idea s (sect . 15 . Introd.) . Wher e i t i s explained i n
what sense this ought to be understood, t o wit, that the par-
ticular lines and figures included in the diagram, are supposed
to stand for innumerable others of different sizes : or in other
words, th e geomete r consider s the m abstractin g fro m thei r
magnitude: which doth no t impl y that h e form s an abstrac t
idea, but only that he cares not what the particular magnitude
is, whether great or small, but looks on that as a thing indiffer-
ent to the demonstration : hence i t follows, tha t a  line in the
scheme, bu t a n inc h long , mus t be spoke n of , a s thoug h i t
contained ten thousand parts, since it is regarded not in itself,
but as it is universal; and it is universal only in its signification,
whereby it represents innumerable lines greater than itself, in
which ma y b e distinguishe d te n thousan d part s o r more ,
though there may not be above an inch in it. After this man-
ner th e propertie s o f the line s signifie d ar e (b y a very usual

figure) transferre d to th e sign , and thenc e throug h mistak e
thought to appertain to it considered in its own nature.
127. Becaus e there is no number of parts so great, but it is
possible there may be a line containing more, the inch-line is
said to contain parts more than any assignable number; which
is true, not of the inch taken absolutely, but only for the things
signified b y it. But men not retaining that distinction in their
thoughts, slide into a belief tha t the smal l particular line de-
scribed on paper contains in itself parts innumerable. There is
no such thing as the ten-thousandth part of an inch'* but there
is of a  mile o r diameter  of th e earth, which may b e signifie d
by that inch. When therefore I delineate a  triangle on paper,
and take one side not above an inch, for example, in length to
be the radius: this I consider as divided into ten thousand or
an hundre d thousan d parts , o r more . Fo r thoug h th e ten -
thousandth part of that line considered in itself, is nothing at
all, and consequently may be neglected without any error o r
inconveniency; ye t thes e describe d line s bein g onl y mark s
standing fo r greate r quantities , whereof i t ma y b e th e ten -
thousandth par t i s very considerable, it follows, that t o pre -
vent notable errors in practice, the radius must be taken of ten
thousand parts, or more.
128. Fro m what hath been said the reason i s plain why, to
the en d an y theore m ma y becom e universa l in it s use, i t is
necessary we speak of the lines described on paper, as though
they containe d part s whic h really the y d o not . I n doin g of
which, if we examine the matte r throughly, we shall perhap s
discover tha t we cannot conceiv e an inch itself a s consisting
of, o r bein g divisibl e int o a  thousan d parts , but onl y som e
other line which is far greater than a n inch, and represente d
by it. And tha t when we say a line is infinitely divisible,  we
must mean a line which is infinitely great.  What we have here
observed seem s t o b e th e chie f cause , wh y t o suppos e th e
infinite divisibilit y o f finit e extensio n hat h bee n though t
necessary in geometry.
129. Th e severa l absurditie s an d contradiction s whic h
flowed from thi s false principle might, one would think, have
been esteeme d s o many demonstrations agains t it. But b y I
know not what logic, it is held that proofs a posteriori ar e not

to b e admitte d agains t proposition s relatin g t o infinity . A s
though i t wer e no t impossibl e eve n fo r a n infinit e min d t o
reconcile contradictions. Or as if anything absurd and repug-
nant coul d hav e a  necessar y connexio n wit h truth , o r flow
from it. But whoever considers the weakness of this pretence,
will think it was contrived on purpose to humour the laziness
of the mind, which had rather acquiesce in an indolent scepti-
cism, than be at the pains to go through with a severe exam-
ination of those principles it hath ever embraced for true.
130. O f lat e th e speculation s abou t infinite s hav e ru n s o
high, and grown to such strange notions, as have occasioned
no smal l scruples and dispute s among the geometer s o f th e
present age . Some there are o f great note , who not conten t
with holdin g that finite lines may be divide d into a n infinit e
number o f parts, do yet farther maintain, that each o f those
infinitesimals i s itsel f subdivisibl e into a n infinit y o f othe r
parts, o r infinitesimal s o f a  secon d order , an d s o o n a d
infinitum. These , I  say , asser t ther e ar e infinitesimal s of
infinitesimals of infinitesimals, without ever coming to an end.
So that according to them an inch doth not barely contain an
infinite numbe r o f parts, bu t a n infinit y o f a n infinit y o f a n
infinity a d infinitum  o f parts . Other s ther e b e wh o hol d al l
orders o f infinitesimals below th e firs t t o b e nothin g a t all ,
thinking it with good reaso n absurd , to imagin e there i s any
positive quantit y o r par t o f extension , whic h though multi-
plied infinitely , ca n ever equa l the smalles t given extension.
And yet on the other hand it seems no less absurd, to think the
square, cube , or othe r powe r o f a positive rea l root, should
itself be nothing at all; which they who hold infinitesimals o
f
the firs t orde r denyin g al l o f th e subsequen t orders , ar e
obliged to maintain.
131. Hav e w e not therefor e reaso n t o conclude, that they
are both in the wrong, and that there is in effect n o such thing
as parts infinitel y small , or a n infinit e numbe r o f parts con-
tained i n an y finit e quantity ? Bu t yo u wil l say , that i f this
doctrine obtains , it will follow th e ver y foundations of geo-
metry ar e destroyed : an d thos e grea t me n wh o have raise d
that scienc e t o s o astonishin g an height , have bee n al l th e
while building a castle in the air. To this it may be replied, that


84 Principles:

whatever i s useful i n geometry and promote s th e benefi t o f
human life, doth still remain firm and unshaken on our prin-
ciples. That science considered a s practical, will rather receive
advantage than any prejudice from wha t hath been said. But
to se t thi s i n a  du e light , ma y b e th e subjec t o f a  distinc t
inquiry. For the rest, though it should follow that some of the
more intricat e an d subtl e part s o f speculative  mathematics
may be pared off without any prejudice to truth; yet I do not
see what damage will be thence derived to mankind. On th e
contrary, it were highly to be wished, that men of great abili-
ties and obstinat e applicatio n would draw off their thoughts
from those amusements, and employ them in the study of such
things as lie nearer the concerns of life, or have a more direct
influence o n the manners.
132. I f it be sai d that severa l theorems undoubtedl y true,
are discovere d b y methods i n which infinitesimals ar e mad e
use of , whic h coul d neve r hav e been , i f their existenc e in -
cluded a  contradiction i n it. I answer, that upo n a  thoroug h
examination i t wil l no t b e found , tha t i n an y instanc e i t is
necessary t o mak e us e o f o r conceiv e infinitesima l part s of
finite lines, or even quantities less than the minimum sensibile:
nay, it will be evident this is never done, it being impossible.*
133. B y what we have premised, it is plain that very numer-
ous an d importan t error s hav e take n thei r ris e fro m thos e
false principles, which were impugned in the foregoin g parts
of this treatise. And the opposites of those erroneous tenets at
the sam e tim e appea r t o b e mos t fruitfu l principles , fro m
whence d o flo w innumerabl e consequence s highl y advan -
tageous to true philosophy as well as to religion. Particularly,
matter or the absolute existence of corporeal objects, hath been
shewn t o b e tha t wherei n th e mos t avowe d an d perniciou s
enemies o f al l knowledge , whether huma n o r divine , hav e
ever placed their chief strength and confidence. And surely, if
by distinguishing the real existence of unthinking things from
their bein g perceived , an d allowin g the m a  subsistenc e o f
their own out of the minds of spirits, no one thing is explained
in Nature ; bu t o n th e contrar y a  grea t man y inexplicabl e
difficulties arise : if the supposition of matter is barely precari-
ous, as not being grounded on so much as one single reason:
if it s consequence s canno t endur e th e ligh t o f examinatio n

and fre e inquiry , but scree n themselve s under th e dar k an d
general pretence of infinites being  incomprehensible: if withal
the removal of this matter be not attende d with the least evil
consequence, i f it be not even missed in the world, but every-
thing as well, nay much easier conceive d without it: if lastly,
both sceptics and atheists are for ever silenced upon supposing
only spirits and ideas , and thi s scheme of things is perfectly
agreeable bot h t o reason and religion: methinks we may ex-
pect i t shoul d b e admitte d an d firml y embraced , thoug h i t
were propose d onl y a s a n hypothesis,  an d th e existenc e o f
matter had been allowed possible, which yet I think we have
evidently demonstrated tha t it is not.
134. Tru e i t is, that in consequence o f the foregoin g prin-
ciples, several disputes and speculations, which are esteeme d
no mean parts of learning, ar e rejecte d a s useless. But ho w
great a prejudice soever against our notions, this may give to
those who have already been deeply engaged, and made large
advances in studies of that nature: yet by others, we hope it
will not be thought any just ground of dislike to the principles
and tenets herein lai d down, that they abridge the labou r of
study, an d mak e huma n science s mor e clear , compendious,
and attainable, than they were before.
135. Havin g dispatched what we intended t o say concern-
ing the knowledge of ideas, the method we proposed leads us,
in th e nex t place , t o trea t o f spirits: wit h regard t o which ,
perhaps huma n knowledg e is not s o deficien t a s is vulgarly
imagined. Th e grea t reaso n tha t i s assigne d fo r ou r bein g
thought ignorant of the nature of spirits, is, our not having an
idea of it. But surely it ought not to be looked on as a defect
in a human understanding, that it does not perceive the idea
of spirit, if it is manifestly impossible there should be any such
/dea. And this, if I mistake not, has been demonstrated in sect.
27: to which I shall here add that a spirit has been shown to be
the only substance or support, wherein the unthinking beings
or ideas ca n exist: but tha t thi s substance which supports o r
perceives idea s shoul d itsel f b e a n idea  o r lik e a n idea,  is
evidently absurd .
136. I t will perhaps be said, that we want a sense (as some
have imagined) proper to know substances withal, which if we
had, we might know our own soul, as we do a triangle. To this


86 Principles:
 Part I
I answer, that in case we had a new sense bestowed upo n us,
we could only receive thereby some new sensations of ideas of
sense. Bu t I believe nobody wil l say, that what he means by
the term s soul and substance, is only some particular sort of
idea or sensation. We may therefore infer, that all things duly
considered, it i s not mor e reasonabl e t o thin k ou r faculties
defective, in that they do not furnish u s with an idea of spirit
or activ e thinking substance, tha n i t woul d b e i f we shoul d
blame them for not being able to comprehend a  round square.
137. Fro m the opinion that spirits are to be known after the
manner of an idea or sensation, have risen many absurd and
heterodox tenets , an d muc h scepticism abou t th e natur e of
the soul. It is even probable, that this opinion may have pro-
duced a  doub t i n some , whethe r the y ha d an y sou l a t al l
distinct fro m thei r body , sinc e upo n inquir y they coul d no t
find they had an idea of it. That an idea which is inactive, and
the existenc e whereof consists in being perceived, should b e
the image or likeness of an agent subsisting by itself, seems to
need n o othe r refutation , tha n barel y attendin g t o wha t is
meant b y those words. But perhaps yo u will say, that though
an idea  canno t resembl e a  spirit,  i n it s thinking , acting, o r
subsisting by itself, yet it may in some other respects: and it is
not necessary that an idea or image be in all respects like the
original.
138. I  answer, if it does not in those mentioned, it is imposs-
ible it should represent i t in any other thing. Do but leave out
the power of willing, thinking, and perceiving ideas, and there
remains nothing else wherein the idea can be like a spirit. For
by the word spirit we mean only that which thinks, wills, and
perceives; this, and this alone, constitutes the significatio n of
that term. If therefore it is impossible that any degree of those
powers should b e represente d i n an idea, it is evident ther e
can be no idea of a spirit.
139. Bu t it will be objected, that if there is no idea signified
by the terms soul, spirit, and substance, they are wholly insig-
nificant, o r have no meaning in them. I answer, those words
do mean or signif y a  real thing, which is neither a n idea no r
like a n idea , but tha t whic h perceives ideas , an d wills , an d
reasons about them. What I am myself, that which I denote by


Principles: Part I 8
7
the term I, is the same with what is meant by soul or spiritual
substance. If it be said that this is only quarrelling at a word,
and that since the immediate significations of other names are
by common consent called ideas, no reason ca n be assigned,
why that which is signified by the name spirit or soul may not
partake in the same appellation. I answer, all the unthinking
objects o f the min d agree , i n that the y ar e entirel y passive,
and their existence consists only in being perceived: whereas
a soul or spirit is an active being, whose existence consists not
in being perceived, but i n perceiving ideas and thinking. It is
therefore necessary , i n orde r t o preven t equivocatio n an d
confounding natures perfectly disagreeing and unlike, that we
distinguish between spirit an d idea.  See sect. 27.
140. I n a  large sens e indeed , w e may b e sai d t o hav e a n
idea, o r rathe r a  notion o f spirit, tha t is , we understand th e
meaning of the word,* otherwise we could not affir m o r deny
anything of it. Moreover, as we conceive the ideas that are in
the mind s o f othe r spirit s b y mean s o f ou r own , which we
suppose to be resemblances of them: so we know other spirits
by means of our own soul, which in that sense is the image or
idea o f them , i t havin g a  lik e respec t t o othe r spirits , tha t
blueness o r hea t b y me perceive d hat h t o thos e idea s per -
ceived by another.
141. I t mus t not * b e supposed , tha t the y wh o asser t th e
natural immortality of the soul are of opinion, that it is abso-
lutely incapable of annihilation even by the infinit e power of
the Creator who first gave it being: but only that it is not liable
to be broken o r dissolved by the ordinary Laws of Nature or
motion. They indeed, who hold the soul of man to be only a
thin vital flame, or system of animal spirits, make it perishing
and corruptible as the body, since there is nothing more easily
dissipated than such a being, which it is naturally impossible
should surviv e the rui n o f th e tabernacle , wherei n i t i s en-
closed. An d thi s notio n hat h bee n greedil y embrace d an d
cherished by the worst part of mankind, as the most effectua l
antidote agains t all impressions of virtue and religion. But it
hath been made evident, that bodies of what frame or texture
soever, ar e barel y passive ideas i n the mind , which is more
distant and heterogeneous fro m them, than light is from dark-


88 Principles:

ness. We have shewn that the soul is indivisible, incorporeal,
unextended, and it is consequently incorruptible. Nothing can
be plainer , tha n tha t th e motions , changes , decays , an d
dissolutions which we hourly see befal l natura l bodies (an d
which is what we mean by the course of Nature) cannot poss-
ibly affect a n active, simple, uncompounded substance: such a
being therefore is indissoluble by the forc e of Nature, that is
to say, the soul of man i s naturally immortal.
142. Afte r what hath been said , it is I suppose plain , that
our souls are not to be known in the same manner as senseless
inactive objects, or by way of idea. Spirits an d ideas are things
so wholl y different, that whe n w e say , they  exist,  they  ar e
known, or the like, these words must not be thought to signify
anything common to both natures. There is nothing alike or
common in them: and to expect that by any multiplication or
enlargement o f our faculties , we may be enable d t o kno w a
spirit as we do a triangle, seems as absurd as if we should hope
to see a sound. This is inculcated because I imagine it may be
of moment towards clearing several important questions, and
preventing some very dangerous errors concerning the nature
of the soul. We may not I think strictly be said to have an idea
of an active being, or of an action, although we may be said to
have a notion of them. I have some knowledg e or notion of
my mind , an d it s act s abou t ideas , inasmuc h a s I  kno w o r
understand what is meant by those words. What I know, that
I have some notion of. I will not say, that the terms idea an d
notion ma y not b e used convertibly, if the worl d will have it
so. But ye t it conduceth t o clearnes s an d propriety, that we
distinguish things very different b y different names . It is also
to be remarked, that all relations including an act of the mind,
we cannot s o properly b e sai d to have an idea, but rathe r a
notion of the relations or habitudes between things. But if in
the moder n wa y th e wor d idea  i s extende d t o spirits , an d
relations and acts; this is after all an affair o f verbal concern.*
143. I t will not be amiss to add, that the doctrine of abstract
ideas hat h ha d n o smal l shar e i n renderin g thos e science s
intricate and obscure, which are particularly conversant about
spiritual things. Men have imagined they could frame abstract
notions of the powers and acts of the mind, and consider them


Principles: Part I 8

prescinded, as well from the mind or spirit itself, as from their
respective objects and effects. Hence a great number of dark
and ambiguous terms presumed to stand for abstract notions,
have bee n introduce d int o metaphysic s an d morality , an d
from thes e hav e grow n infinit e distraction s an d dispute s
amongst the learned.
144. Bu t nothing seems more to have contributed towards
engaging men i n controversies an d mistakes , with regard t o
the nature and operations of the mind, than the being used to
speak of those things, in terms borrowed from sensible ideas.
For example , the wil l is termed th e motion  of the soul : this
infuses a  belief, that the min d o f man is as a ball in motion,
impelled and determined by the objects of sense, as necessar-
ily a s that i s by the strok e o f a  racket. Hence aris e endles s
scruples and errors of dangerous consequence in morality. All
which I  doub t no t ma y be cleared , an d trut h appea r plain ,
uniform, and consistent, could but philosophers be prevailed
on t o retir e int o themselves , an d attentivel y consider thei r
own meaning.*
145. Fro m what hath been said , it is plain that we canno t
know the existenc e o f other spirits , otherwise tha n b y their
operations, o r th e idea s b y the m excite d i n us . I  perceiv e
several motions , changes , an d combination s o f ideas , tha t
inform m e ther e ar e certai n particula r agent s lik e myself ,
which accompan y them , an d concu r i n thei r production .
Hence the knowledge I have of other spirits is not immediate,
as is the knowledge of my ideas; but dependin g on the inter-
vention of ideas, by me referre d t o agent s or spirit s distinct
from myself , as effects o r concomitant signs.
146. Bu t thoug h ther e b e som e things which convince us,
human agent s ar e concerne d i n producin g them ; ye t i t i s
evident t o everyone , that thos e thing s which ar e calle d th e
works of Nature, that is, the fa r greater part of the idea s or
sensations perceived by us, are not produced by, or dependent
on the wills of men. There is therefore some other spirit that
causes them , sinc e i t i s repugnant tha t the y shoul d subsis t
by themselves . Se e sect . 29 . But i f w e attentivel y conside r

of th e larger , an d th e exquisit e contrivanc e o f th e smalle r

and correspondenc e o f the whole , bu t abov e all , the neve r

I sa y i f we conside r al l these things , an d a t th e sam e tim e
attend to the meaning and import of the attributes, one, eter-
nal, infinitely wise, good, and perfect, we shall clearly perceive
that they belong to the aforesaid spirit, who works all in all*
and by whom all things consist*
147. Henc e it is evident, that God is known as certainly and
immediately as any other mind or spirit whatsoever , distinc t
from ourselves. We may even assert, that the existence of God
is far mor e evidentl y perceived tha n th e existenc e o f men ;
because th e effect s o f Nature ar e infinitel y mor e numerou s
and considerable, than those ascribed to human agents. There
is not any one mark that denotes a man, or effect produced by
him, which doth no t mor e strongl y evince the bein g of that
spirit wh o i s the Author  o f Nature.  Fo r i t i s evident tha t in
affecting other persons,* the will of man hath no other object,
than barely the motion of the limbs of his body; but that such
a motion should be attended by, or excite any idea in the mind
of another , depend s wholly on th e wil l o f the Creator . H e
alone it is who upholding all things by the Word of  his Power*
maintains that intercourse between spirits, whereby they are
able to perceive the existence of each other. And yet this pure
and clear light which enlightens everyone, is itself invisible.
148. I t seem s t o b e a  general pretence o f the unthinkin g
herd, tha t the y cannot se e God . Coul d w e but se e him, say
they, a s w e se e a  man , w e shoul d believ e tha t h e is , an d
believing obe y hi s commands . Bu t ala s w e nee d onl y
open ou r eye s to see the sovereig n Lord o f all things with a
more ful l an d clea r view, than we do an y one o f our fellow -
creatures. Not that I imagine we see God (a s some will have
it) b y a direct an d immediat e view , or se e corporeal things ,
not by themselves, but by seeing that which represents the m
in the essence of God, which doctrine is I must confess to me
incomprehensible. Bu t I shall explain my meaning. A human
spirit or person is not perceived by sense, as not being an idea;

when therefor e w e see the colour , size , figure , an d motion s
of a man, we perceive only certain sensations or ideas excited
in ou r ow n minds : an d thes e bein g exhibite d t o ou r vie w
in sundr y distinc t collections , serv e t o mar k ou t unt o u s
the existence of finite and created spirits like ourselves. Hence
it is plain, we do not see a man, if by man is meant that which
lives, moves , perceives, and think s a s we do : bu t onl y such
a certai n collectio n o f ideas , a s direct s u s t o thin k there i s
a distinct principle of thought and motio n lik e to ourselves ,
accompanying an d represente d b y it . An d afte r th e sam e
manner w e se e God ; al l th e differenc e is , tha t wherea s
some on e finit e an d narro w assemblag e o f ideas denote s a
particular human mind, whithersoever we direct our view, we
do a t al l times and i n all places perceive manifes t tokens of
the divinity: everything we see, hear, feel, or anywise perceive
by sense , bein g a sig n or  effec t of  the  Powe r of  God ; as  is
our perceptio n o f thos e ver y motions, whic h ar e produce d
by men.
149. I t is therefore plain, that nothing can be more evident
to anyone that is capable of the least reflexion, than the exist-
ence of God, or a spirit who is intimately present to our minds,
producing in them all that variety of ideas or sensations, which
continually affect us, on whom we have an absolute and entire
dependence, i n short, in whom we live, and move, and have
our being. That the discovery of this great truth which lies so
near an d obviou s to the mind, should be attaine d t o by the
reason o f so very few, is a sad instanc e o f the stupidit y and
inattention o f men , who, thoug h the y ar e surrounde d wit h
such clear manifestations of the Deity, are yet so little affected
by them, that they seem as it were blinded with excess of light.
150. Bu t yo u wil l say , hath Natur e n o shar e i n th e pro -
duction of natural things, and must they be all ascribed to the
immediate and sole operation o f God? I answer, if by Nature
is meant onl y th e visibl e series of effects , o r sensation s im -
printed o n our mind s according to certain fixed and genera l
laws: then it is plain, that Natur e taken i n this sense canno t
produce anything at all. But if by Nature is meant some being
distinct fro m God , a s well as from th e Law s of Nature, an d
things perceived by sense, I must confess that word is to me an

empty sound, without any intelligible meaning annexed to it.
Nature i n thi s acceptatio n i s a vai n chimera  introduce d b y
those heathens, who had not just notions of the omnipresenc e
and infinite perfection o f God. Bu t it is more unaccountable ,
that it should be received amon g Christians professing belief
in the Holy Scriptures, which constantly ascribe those effect s
to the immediate hand of God, that heathen philosophers ar e
wont to impute to Nature. The Lord, he causeth the vapours to
ascend; he maketh lightnings  with rain;  he bringeth  forth the
wind out of his treasures, Jerem., chap. TO . ver. 13. He turneth
the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark
with night,  Amos , chap . 5 . ver. 8 . He visiteth  the earth,  and
maketh it  soft with  showers: he blesseth the springing thereof,
and crowneth  the  year with his goodness; so that the pastures
are clothed with  flocks, and  the  valleys are  covered over with
corn. See Psalm 65. But notwithstanding that this is the con -
stant languag e o f Scripture ; ye t w e hav e I  kno w no t wha t
aversion from believing, that Go d concerns himself so nearly
in our affairs . Fain would we suppose hi m at a great distanc e
off, an d substitute some blind unthinking deputy in his stead,
though (if we may believe Saint Paul) he be not far from every
one of  us.
151. I t wil l I  doub t no t b e objected , tha t th e slo w an d
gradual methods observed in the production of natural things,
do not seem to have for their cause the immediate hand of an
almighty Agent.  Besides , monsters , untimel y births , fruit s
blasted in the blossom, rains falling in desert places, miseries
incident to human life, are so many arguments that the whole
frame o f Natur e i s not immediatel y actuate d an d superin -
tended b y a spirit o f infinite wisdo m and goodness . Bu t th e
answer to this objection is in a good measure plain from sect .
62, it being visible, that the aforesai d methods o f Nature ar e
absolutely necessary, in order to working by the most simpl e
and general rules, and afte r a  steady and consistent manner;
which argues both the wisdom  an d goodness o f God. Suc h is
the artificia l contrivanc e o f thi s mighty machin e o f Nature ,
that whilst its motions an d various phenomena strik e on our
senses, th e han d whic h actuate s th e whol e i s itsel f

ver. 15. But though God conceal himself from the eyes of the
sensual an d lazy,  wh o wil l no t b e a t th e leas t expenc e o f
thought; yet to an unbiassed and attentive mind, nothing can
be more plainly legible, than the intimate presence o f an all-
wise Spirit,  wh o fashions , regulates , an d sustain s th e whol e
system o f being . I t i s clea r fro m wha t w e hav e elsewher e
observed, that the operating accordin g to general and stated
laws, is so necessary for our guidance in the affair s of life, an d
letting us into the secre t o f Nature, that without it, all reach
and compass of thought, all human sagacity and design could
serve to no manner of purpose: it were even impossible there
should be any such faculties or powers in the mind. See sect.
31. Which one consideratio n abundantl y out-balances what-
ever particular inconveniences may thence arise .
152. W e shoul d further consider, tha t the ver y blemishes
and defects of Nature ar e not without their use, in that they
make an agreeable fort of variety, and augment the beauty of
the rest of the creation, as shades in a picture serve to set off
the brighter and more enlightened parts. We would likewise
do well to examine, whether our taxing the waste of seeds and
embryos, an d accidenta l destructio n o f plant s an d animals,
before the y com e to ful l maturity , a s an imprudence i n th e
Author of Nature, be not the effect of prejudice contracted by
our familiarit y wit h impoten t an d savin g mortals . I n ma n
indeed a thrifty management of those things, which he cannot
procure without much pains and industry, may be esteeme d
wisdom. Bu t we must not imagine, that the inexplicably fine
machine of an anima l or vegetable , cost s the grea t Creato r
any mor e pain s o r troubl e i n it s productio n tha n a  pebbl e
doth: nothing bein g more evident , than tha t a n omnipoten t
spirit can indifferentl y produc e everythin g by a mere fiat or
act of his will. Hence it is plain, that the splendid profusion of
natural things should not be interpreted, weaknes s or prodi-
gality in the agent who produces them, but rather b e looked
on as an argument of the riche s of his power.

is indispensably necessar y t o ou r well-being . But ou r pros -
pects are too narrow: we take, for instance, the idea of some
one particula r pai n int o ou r thoughts , an d accoun t i t evil,
whereas i f w e enlarg e ou r view , so a s t o comprehen d th e
various ends , connexions , an d dependencie s o f things , o n
what occasions and in what proportions w e are affecte d wit h
pain an d pleasure , th e natur e o f huma n freedom , an d th e
design wit h whic h w e ar e pu t int o th e world ; w e shal l
be forced to acknowledge that those particular things, which
considered i n themselves appea r t o be evil,  have the natur e
of good,  whe n considere d a s linked with the whol e system
of beings.
154. Fro m what hath bee n sai d it will be manifes t to an y
considering person, that it is merely for want of attention an d
comprehensiveness o f mind, that ther e ar e an y favourers of
atheism o r th e Manichean  heresy*  t o b e found . Littl e an d
unreflecting soul s may indeed burlesqu e th e works of Provi-
dence, the beauty and order whereof they have not capacity,
or will not be at the pains to comprehend. Bu t those who are
masters of any justness and extent o f thought, and are withal
used to reflect, can never sufficiently admir e the divine traces
of wisdom and goodness tha t shine throughout the econom y
of Nature. But what truth is there which shineth so strongly on
the mind , that by an aversion of thought, a wilful shuttin g of
the eyes , we may not escap e seein g it ? I s it therefore t o b e
wondered at, if the generality of men, who are ever intent on
business or pleasure, and little used to fix or open the eye of
their mind , should not have all that conviction and evidenc e
of the bein g of God, which might be expected i n reasonabl e
creatures?
155. W e should rather wonder , that men ca n be found so
stupid as to neglect, than that neglecting they should be un-
convinced of such an evident and momentous truth. And ye t
it is to be feared that too many of parts and leisure, who live
in Christian countries, are merely through a supine and dread-
ful negligence sunk into a sort of atheism. Since it is downright
impossible, that a  soul pierced an d enlightene d with a thor-
ough sense of the omnipresence , holiness, and justice of that
Almighty Spirit,  should persist in a remorseless violation of his

laws. We ought therefore earnestl y to meditate an d dwell on
those important points; that so we may attain conviction with-
out al l scruple , that  th e eyes  o f th e Lord  ar e i n every  place
beholding the evil and the good', that he is with us and keepeth
us in all places whither we go, and giveth us bread to eat, and
raiment t o put on',  tha t h e i s present an d consciou s t o ou r
innermost thoughts ; an d tha t w e have a  most absolut e an d
immediate dependence on him. A clea r view of which great
truths cannot choose bu t fill our hearts with an awful circum-
spection an d hol y fear , whic h i s th e stonges t incentiv e t o
