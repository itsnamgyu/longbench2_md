Foreword 
 
 
The National Population Health Survey (NPHS) is a cross-sectional population health 
survey series to track the health and risk factors, as well as lifestyle practices of Singapore 
residents. This survey replaces the three population health surveys (i.e., National Health 
Survey (NHS), National Health Surveillance Survey (NHSS) and Health Behaviour 
Surveillance of Singapore (HBSS)) previously conducted by the Ministry of Health and 
Health Promotion Board respectively. 
 
The NPHS is conducted annually to provide timely and regular information on the 
prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and 
hyperlipidaemia, and related risk factors like smoking, alcohol consumption and physical 
inactivity from a representative sample of the resident population. The NPHS also 
captures information on practice of chronic disease and cancer screenings, mental health 
as well as influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations among Singapore residents.   
 
As we live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease, many of the health indicators have 
continued to show improvements in 2023. There were more residents who participated in 
chronic disease and cancer screening; and had sufficient total physical activity compared 
to 2022. The proportion of residents who reported having received vaccinations against 
influenza and pneumococcal; and showed willingness to seek help from healthcare 
professionals (when unable to cope with stress) continued to increase in 2023. Though 
there was a sustained decline in the prevalence of smoking, the prevalence of binge-
drinking increased slightly in 2023. The findings from the survey will help the Ministry of 
Health and Health Promotion Board develop and evaluate health policies and 
programmes and improve the health of Singapore residents. 
 
I would like to gratefully acknowledge and thank all who have, in one way or another, 
contributed to the successful completion of the survey. In particular, I would like to thank 
all respondents who have given their time to take part in the survey, and whose support 
makes this report possible.

Executive Summary 
 
The National Population Health Survey (NPHS) is a cross-sectional population health 
survey, conducted annually by the Ministry of Health and Health Promotion Board, to 
track the health and risk factors, as well as lifestyle practices of Singapore residents. This 
survey replaces the three population health surveys (i.e., National Health Survey (NHS), 
National Health Surveillance Survey (NHSS) and Health Behaviour Surveillance of 
Singapore (HBSS)) that were conducted in the earlier years.  
 
The NPHS monitors behavioural risk factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption; 
chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia as well as 
preventive health behaviour such as the practice of health screening. The survey findings 
will be used by the Ministry of Health and Health Promotion Board to track progress 
towards national heath targets and for planning and evaluation of health policies, 
programmes, and health care services. 
 
The NPHS consists of two components 1 : (i) Household Interview and (ii) Health 
Examination. This report presents the survey findings from the Household Interview of  
Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years. The Health Examination, which comprises 
mainly measured indicators such as obesity and chronic disease prevalence, is 
conducted on a two-year survey cycle to ensure that there is enough data for a detailed 
analysis2. The findings from the Health Examination (NPHS 2023 – 2024) will be reported 
in 2025. The reporting coverage in terms of age differs from previous national health 
surveys reflecting the growing size of the older population. While the survey results in the 
earlier publications of the national health surveys were based on Chinese, Malay and 
Indian residents aged 18 to 69 years, the NPHS report is based on all Singapore residents 
aged 18 to 74 years. Time-series data for the extended reporting coverage are available 
from 2007 onwards3.  
 
 
 
1  More details on the survey design, method and fieldwork are covered in “Chapter 13: Survey 
Methodology”. 
 
2 Data collection for the “Health Examination” component requires a longer time duration for completion. 
This is because it requires respondents to attend a health examination/screening at designated locations 
and hence there are relatively fewer respondents as compared to the “Household Interview” component.  
 
3 Data from the earlier national health surveys are presented for trend analysis over a longer time period. 
However, there are differences in the survey design across the health surveys and examination of 
differences across the survey series should take this into consideration.

Trend analysis is presented when there are sufficient data (inclusive of NHS, NHSS and 
NPHS) to gauge the directional change of an indicator. A comparison of survey results 
between 2019 and 2023 is also carried out to highlight changes in the health behaviours 
and health practices among Singapore residents, possibly due to COVID-19 pandemic4.  
 
 
Alcohol consumption  
• In 2023, 2.1% of Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years consumed alcohol regularly, 
with 3.2% of males and 1.0% of females being regular drinkers.  
• Regular alcohol consumption was most common among males in the 50 to 59 years 
age group (4.7%).  
• The crude and age-standardised prevalence of regular alcohol consumption 
increased significantly from 2007 to 2023 (crude: 1.2% in 2007, 2.1% in 2023; age-
standardised: 1.2% in 2007, 2.1% in 2023).  
• However, the prevalence of regular drinking remained the same between 2019 and 
2023 (crude: 2.1% in 2019, 2.1% in 2023; age-standardised: 2.1% in 2019, 2.1% in 
2023). 
• The prevalence of binge drinking was 10.3% in 2023, and it was more common among 
males (13.7%) than females (7.1%). 
• Males aged 30 to 39 years and females aged 18 to 29 years had the highest proportion 
of binge drinkers at 17.5% and 13.7% respectively. 
• The rise in both the crude and age-standardised prevalence of binge drinking was 
significant between 2007 and 2023 (crude: 4.3% in 2007, 10.3% in 2023; age-
standardised: 3.9% in 2007, 10.4% in 2023). 
• The overall prevalence of binge drinking remained the same between 2019 and 2023 
period (crude: 10.2% in 2019, 10.3% in 2023; age-standardised: 10.2% in 2019, 10.4% 
in 2023). 
 
 
4 NPHS 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 results are compared with NPHS 2019 results to highlight changes in 
the health behaviours and health practices among Singapore residents possibly due to COVID-19. 
Fieldwork for NPHS 2019 was conducted from August 2018 to July 2019 where COVID-19 pandemic had 
not started yet (pre-COVID-19). Fieldwork for NPHS 2020 was affected by COVID-19 as data were 
collected for only three-quarter of the survey year (July 2019 to March 2020) and fieldwork from April to 
June 2020 was cancelled due to the Circuit Breaker from 7 April to 1 June 2020 (inclusive). Fieldwork for 
NPHS 2021 to NPHS 2023 was typically carried out from preceding July to June of the reporting year, 
unless stated otherwise (e.g. for NPHS 2021, the fieldwork was carried from July 2020 to June 2021).

Cigarette Smoking 
• The crude prevalence of daily smoking has decreased further from 9.2% in 2022 to 
8.8% in 2023, continuing the declining trend of smoking rates over the past decade.   
• The prevalence of daily smoking was higher among males (15.7%) than females 
(2.3%) in 2023.  
• Daily smoking was most prevalent in adults aged 50 to 59 years (11.5%) and least 
prevalent among younger adults aged 18 to 29 years (5.0%) in 2023.   
• Male daily smokers smoked an average of 12 cigarettes a day while female daily 
smokers smoked an average of 8 cigarettes a day.  
• About half (46.5%) of the daily smokers in 2023 had intention to quit smoking. 
However, only 18.2% of them planned to quit smoking within the next 12 months or 
less. 
• The crude and age-standardised prevalence of daily smoking decreased significantly 
between 2007 and 2023 (crude: 13.3% in 2007, 8.8% in 2023; age-standardised: 13.0% 
in 2007; 8.9% in 2023).  
• Between 2019 and 2023, the overall crude and age-standardised prevalence of daily 
smoking also showed a significant decrease over the last five years (crude: 10.6% in 
2019, 8.8% in 2023; age-standardised: 10.6% in 2019, 8.9% in 2023).   
 
 
Physical Activity 
• With COVID-19 being an endemic disease, the proportion of residents with sufficient 
total physical activity increased significantly from 74.9% in 2022 to 78.5% in 2023 after 
several years of declining participation, likely primarily due to COVID-19.  
• In 2023, more males (80.0%) compared with females (76.9%) were able to meet the 
recommended total physical activity level.  
• Young adults in the 18 to 29 years age group (85.5%) had the highest level of sufficient 
total physical activity while the older adults aged 60 to 74 years had the lowest 
proportion at 74.2%.  
• The largest contributor to total physical activity per week was commuting (45.6%), 
followed by leisure-time physical activity (29.1%) and work-related physical activity 
(25.3%).   


 
5 
 
• About one in three (33.7%) Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years reported having 
sufficient muscle-strengthening activities in 2023. 
• This was more common among younger adults aged 18 to 29 years (42.3%) while the 
proportion with sufficient muscle-strengthening activities dropped to around one-third 
or less for those aged 30 to 74 years. 
• There was a higher proportion of males (40.4%) with sufficient muscle-strengthening 
activities compared with females (27.3%). 
• Comparing the longer-term trend between 2007 and 2023, the decreasing trend in the 
proportion of residents with sufficient total physical activity was not significant (crude: 
85.4% in 2007, 78.5% in 2023; age-standardised: 85.3% in 2007, 78.5% in 2023).  
• Likewise, the drop in proportion of residents with sufficient total physical activity was 
also not significant between 2019 and 2023 (crude: 84.6% in 2019, 78.5% in 2023; 
age-standardised 84.6% in 2019, 78.5% in 2023). 
 
Self-reported Diabetes Mellitus (or High Blood Sugar) 
• 7.3% of Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years reported that they had diabetes 
mellitus and were currently prescribed medication in 2023. 
• A higher proportion of males (8.1%) reported having diabetes compared to females 
(6.6%). 
• The prevalence of self-reported diabetes mellitus (i.e. residents who reported they had 
diabetes mellitus and were currently prescribed medication) increased with age, from 
1.0% in young adults aged 30 to 39 years to 22.3% among those aged 70 to 74 years. 
• Both the crude and age-standardised prevalence of self-reported diabetes among 
Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years showed a significant increasing trend 
between 2007 to 2023 (crude: 4.9% in 2007, 7.3% in 2023; age-standardised: 6.4% 
in 2007, 7.2% in 2023).  
• Between 2019 to 2023, the crude and age-standardised prevalence of self-reported 
diabetes remained stable and hovered around 7% (crude: 6.9% in 2019, 7.3% in 2023; 
age-standardised: 7.0% in 2019, 7.2% in 2023)

Self-reported Hypertension (or High Blood Pressure) 
• In 2023, 15.0% of Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years reported that they had 
hypertension (or high blood pressure) and were currently prescribed medication.  
• A higher proportion of males (15.9%) reported having hypertension than females 
(14.2%).  
• The prevalence of self-reported hypertension (i.e. residents who reported they had 
hypertension and were currently prescribed medication) increased with age, from 2.4% 
in young adults aged 30 to 39 years to 47.7% among those aged 70 to 74 years. 
• The crude prevalence of self-reported hypertension  among Singapore residents aged 
18 to 74 years showed a significant upward trend from 2007 to 2023 but the age-
standardised prevalence did not show a significant increase (crude: 12.7% in 2007, 
15.0% in 2023; age-standardised: 16.9% in 2007, 14.7% in 2023). 
• Between 2019 to 2023, the crude and age-standardised prevalence of self-reported 
hypertension remained stable around 15% to 16% (crude: 15.6% in 2019, 15.0% in 
2023; age-standardised: 15.9% in 2019, 14.7% in 2023).  
 
Self-reported Hyperlipidaemia (or High Blood Cholesterol) 
• 15.3% of Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years reported that they had 
hyperlipidaemia (or high blood cholesterol) and were currently prescribed medication 
in 2023.  
• More males (16.9%) reported having high blood cholesterol than females (13.7%).  
• The prevalence of self-reported high blood cholesterol (i.e. residents who reported 
they had hyperlipidaemia and were currently prescribed medication) increased with 
age, from 1.7% in young adults aged 30 to 39 years to 50.9% among those aged 70 
to 74 years. 
• The overall crude prevalence of self-reported hyperlipidaemia among Singapore 
residents aged 18 to 74 years showed an increasing trend from 2007 to 2023 but the 
age-standardised prevalence did not show significant upward trend over the same 
period (crude: 8.2% in 2007, 15.3% in 2023; age-standardised: 10.8% in 2007, 15.0% 
in 2023). 
• From 2019 to 2023, the crude and age-standardised prevalence of self-reported 
hyperlipidaemia remained stable at around 14% to 15% (crude: 13.6% in 2019, 15.3% 
in 2023; age-standardised: 13.8% in 2019, 15.0% in 2023).  


 
7 
 
Chronic Disease Screening  
• The crude proportion of Singapore residents aged 40 to 74 years with no previous 
diagnosed chronic diseases (i.e., diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, and high 
blood cholesterol (“DHL”)) and were screened for these three conditions within the 
recommended screening frequencies (i.e. the chronic disease screening participation) 
increased from 60.3% in 2022 to 62.6% in 2023.  
• Looking at a longer-term trend between 2007 and 2023, the chronic disease screening 
participation showed no significant upward trend during this period (crude: 58.1% in 
2007, 62.6% in 2023; age-standardised: 62.0% in 2007, 62.6% in 2023). 
• Although chronic disease screening participation for residents with no previous 
diagnosis of DHL fell between 2019 and 2023, the decrease was not significant (crude: 
66.3% in 2019, 62.6% in 2023; age-standardised: 68.2% in 2019, 62.6% in 2023).  
• Looking at individual chronic disease alone regardless of the co-morbidity with the 
other two chronic diseases, the crude proportion of residents who had diabetes and 
hypertension screening increased significantly from 2007 to 2023 while the proportion 
screening for hyperlipidaemia did not show significant upward trend over the same 
period (diabetes: 72.4% in 2007, 76.7% in 2023; hypertension: 77.7% in 2007, 82.7% 
in 2023; hyperlipidaemia: 78.1% in 2007, 74.7% in 2023). 
• Between 2019 and 2023, the individual crude screening participation for all three 
chronic diseases fell but the decreases were not significant (diabetes: 81.0% in 2019, 
76.7% in 2023; hypertension: 86.0% in 2019, 82.7% in 2023; hyperlipidaemia: 77.9% 
in 2019, 74.7% in 2023). 
 
Cancer Screening 
• The crude screening participation for cervical and colorectal cancers increased from 
43.1% in 2022 to 45.4% in 2023, and from 38.1% in 2022 to 41.7% in 2023 
respectively. However, the crude screening participation for breast cancer decreased 
from 37.6% in 2022 to 34.7% in 2023. 
• The crude and age-standardised screening participation for breast and cervical cancer 
showed a decreasing trend between 2007 and 2023. The decline was significant for 
cervical cancer (crude: 57.9% in 2007, 45.4% in 2023; age-standardised: 54.1% in 
2007, 44.9% in 2023) but not for breast cancer (crude: 41.0% in 2007, 34.7 in 2023; 
age-standardised: 40.2% in 2007, 34.7% in 2023).  


 
8 
 
• The crude and age-standardised screening participation for colorectal cancer rose 
significantly between 2007 and 2023 (crude: 14.6% in 2007, 41.7% in 2023; age-
standardised: 15.0% in 2007, 41.7% in 2023).  
 
Breast Cancer Screening:  
• In 2023, slightly more than one-third (34.7%) of Singapore female residents in the 50 
to 69 years age group reported that they had gone for mammography in the last two 
years. 
 
Cervical Cancer Screening 
• In 2023, more than two in five (45.4%) Singapore female residents aged 25 to 74 
years reported that they had gone for cervical cancer screening (had done Pap test in 
the past three years or HPV test in the past five years).  
• Women aged 30 to 59 years (more than 50%) were most likely to have undergone 
cervical cancer screening. 
 
Colorectal Cancer Screening  
• In 2023, 41.7% of Singapore residents aged 50 to 74 years had undergone colorectal 
screening within the recommended screening frequency.  
• Approximately one in four of these residents reported having undergone a Faecal 
Immunochemical Test (FIT) at least once in the past one year (24.1%) or had 
undergone colonoscopy in the past 10 years (27.7%). 
• The practice of taking a FIT or a colonoscopy was more prevalent among males 
(43.8%) than females (39.6%). 
 
Self-reported Vaccination Uptake 
• 
The crude self-reported influenza vaccination uptake among Singapore residents 
aged 18 to 74 years increased significantly from 18.0% in 2022 to 21.7% in 2023.  
• 
The self-reported influenza vaccination uptake was similar among males (22.1%) and 
females (21.4%) in 2023.  
 
 


 
9 
 
• 
The crude and age-standardised self-reported influenza vaccination uptake (flu 
injection in the past 12 months) among Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years 
showed a significant increasing trend between 2017 and 2023 (crude: 13.1% in 2007, 
21.7% in 2023; age-standardised: 13.0% in 2007, 21.5% in 2023).  
• 
The crude self-reported pneumococcal vaccination uptake among Singapore 
residents aged 65 to 74 years increased significantly from 26.5% in 2022 to 35.0% in 
2023.  
• 
The proportion of residents who reported having received the pneumococcal 
vaccination was similar among males (35.0%) and females (34.9%) in 2023. 
• 
There was a significant increase in the self-reported pneumococcal vaccination 
uptake among Singapore residents aged 65 to 74 years over the period from 
2017(11.9%) to 2023 (35.0%). 
 
Mental Health 
• 
The crude prevalence of poor mental health, as measured by the 12-item General 
Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), among Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years has 
decreased from 17.0% in 2022 to 15.0% in 2023.  
• 
More females (17.6%) reported poor mental health compared to males (12.2%) in 
2023.  
• 
Younger adults aged 18 to 29 years had the highest proportion (26.0%) with poor 
mental health while the prevalence for other age groups were much lower, ranging 
from 8.2% for those in the 60 to 74 years age group to 17.2% in the 30 to 39 years 
age group. 
• 
Comparing between 2017 and 2023, the crude and age-standardised prevalence of 
poor mental health among Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years have increased, 
though these increases were not significant (crude: 12.5% in 2017, 15.0% in 2023; 
age-standardised: 12.4% in 2017, 15.0% in 2023). 
• 
The proportion of Singapore residents who were willing to seek help from healthcare 
professionals has increased significantly to 62.8% in 2023, compared to 56.6% in 
2022, while 78.4% of Singapore residents were willing to seek help from informal 
support networks in 2023, compared to 79.7% in 2022. 


 
10 
 
• 
In 2023, females were more willing to seek help from healthcare professionals and 
informal support networks compared to males (females: 63.3% and 81.6% 
respectively; males: 62.3% and 75.1% respectively).  
• 
Among the age groups, Singapore residents in the oldest age band (60 to 74 years) 
(51.2%) were the least willing to seek help from healthcare professionals while those 
aged 30 to 39 years (71.9%) were the most willing to seek help from healthcare 
professionals in 2023. 
• 
Similarly, the proportion of Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years who indicated 
that they were willing to seek help from informal support networks decreased with 
age -- it was the highest among younger adults aged 18 to 39 years (85.4% for both 
18 to 29 years and 30 to 39 years age groups) and the lowest among older adults 
aged 60 to 74 years (65.6%) in 2023.    
• 
There was no trend in the proportion of residents who indicated that they were willing 
to seek help from healthcare professionals, which ranged between 47.8% to 62.8%,  
in the period between 2019 and 2023.  
• 
Similarly, the proportion of residents who were willing to seek help from informal 
support networks, which ranged between 69.1% to 79.7%, did not display any trend 
over the same period between 2019 and 2023.

Chapter 1 
Alcohol Consumption 
 
Key Points 
• 2.1% of Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years consumed alcohol regularly in 
2023, with 3.2% of the males and 1.0% of the females being regular drinkers. 
• Regular alcohol consumption was most common among males in the 50 to 59 years 
age group (4.7%).  
• The prevalence of binge drinking was 10.3% in 2023, and it was more common 
among males (13.7%) than females (7.1%).  
• Males aged 30 to 39 years and females aged 18 to 29 years had the highest 
proportion of binge drinkers at 17.5% and 13.7% respectively. 
 
Introduction 
Alcohol is a toxic, carcinogenic and psychoactive substance with dependence producing 
properties. Alcohol consumption is a major contributor to the global burden of disease. 
Several diseases such as liver and pancreas disease, neuropsychiatric disease, 
cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers, are entirely or partially caused by alcohol 
consumption. Although some studies have shown that light alcohol intake provides a 
small protective factor for cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes, no study has 
been able to show that light alcohol intake is beneficial for cardiovascular diseases, type 
2 diabetes, and cancer (Anderson et al., 2023). In addition to these chronic disease risks, 
alcohol consumption can also affect social behaviours and cause immediate harm (e.g., 
road traffic accidents, physical assault) to both the drinkers and the other people around.  
A recent meta-analysis reported that low levels of alcohol consumption was not 
associated with protection against all-cause mortality (Zhao et al., 2023). Due to the short 
and long term effects of alcohol consumption, there is risk associated with alcohol 
consumption at every level.

Definition 
Alcohol consumption was classified according to the frequency of alcohol intake in Table 
1.1. 
 
Table 1.1: Classification of alcohol consumption 
Classification 
Frequency of alcohol consumption 
Regular drinker 
> 4 days a week 
Frequent drinker 
1 – 4 days a week 
Occasional drinker 
≤ 3 days a month 
Binge drinking was defined as consumption of at least five alcoholic drinks5 for males or 
at least four alcoholic drinks for females in any single drinking session during the past 
month preceding the survey. 
 
Methodology 
An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used. Respondents were shown a card

Prevalence of Regular Alcohol Consumption 
Among Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years, 3.2% of the males and 1.0% of the 
females consumed alcohol regularly (Table 1.3). Regular alcohol consumption was most 
common among males in the 50 to 59 years age group (4.7%). Among the ethnic groups, 
both Chinese (2.2%) and Indians (2.1%) had similar proportion of regular drinkers at 
around 2% (Graph 1.1). A slightly higher proportion of residents with primary education 
(3.4%) and secondary education (2.2%) were regular drinkers, compared to those with 
post-secondary education (1.8%) (Table 1.4).

Trends in Regular Alcohol Consumption 
The crude and age-standardised prevalence of regular alcohol consumption increased 
significantly from 2007 to 2023 (Table 1.4). Likewise, a significant rise in prevalence of 
regular drinking was also observed among adults aged 40 to 59 years, among males and 
females, among Chinese and across all education levels in the same period. Comparing 
between 2019 and 2023, the prevalence of regular drinking remained the same.

Prevalence of Binge Drinking 
Among Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years, the prevalence of binge drinking was 
10.3% (Table 1.5). Binge drinking was more prevalent among males (13.7%) than 
females (7.1%). The highest proportion of binge drinkers for males was in the 30 to 39 
years age group (17.5%) and for females in the 18 to 29 years age group (13.7%). Among 
the ethnic groups, the prevalence of binge drinking was higher in Indians (13.0%) and 
Chinese (11.0%) than Malays (3.0%) (Graph 1.2). The proportion of binge drinkers was 
higher among those with post-secondary education (12.6%), compared to those with 
lower education levels (primary education and secondary education at 5.2% and 6.7%, 
respectively) (Table 1.6).

Trends in Binge Drinking 
The rise in both the crude and age-standardised prevalence of binge drinking was 
significant between 2007 and 2023 (Table 1.6). This upward trend was also observed in 
all age groups except those aged 18 to 29 years and 60 to 74 years, among males and 
females, among all ethnic groups; and those with primary and post-secondary education 
over the same period between 2007 and 2023.  
 
Between 2019 and 2023, the prevalence of binge drinking remained the same at the 
overall and subgroup levels except in the 40 to 49 years age group which showed a 
significant increase over the last five years.

Chapter 2 
Cigarette Smoking 
 
Key Points 
• 8.8% of Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years smoked cigarettes daily in 2023.  
• More males (15.7%) smoked daily than females (2.3%).  
• Daily smoking was most prevalent in adults aged 50 to 59 years (11.5%) and least 
prevalent among younger adults aged 18 to 29 years (5.0%) in 2023.  
• Male daily smokers smoked an average of 12 cigarettes a day while female daily 
smokers smoked an average of 8 cigarettes a day.  
• About half (46.5%) of the daily smokers had intention to quit smoking. However, 
only 18.2% of them planned to quit smoking within the next 12 months or less. 
 
Introduction 
Tobacco use is a source of preventable morbidity and mortality. Active smoking increases 
the risk of several diseases such as respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases and 
certain cancers. In addition to these disease risks that affect the smokers, smoking also 
implicates the other people around who are exposed to second-hand smoke. Cigarette 
smoking is the most common form of smoking. The impact of tobacco use is largely 
determined by the pattern of smoking and number of cigarettes smoked (US Department 
of Health and Human Services, 2014). 
 
Definition 
Smoking status was classified according to the frequency of cigarette smoked as shown 
in Table 2.1, which followed the World Health Organization (WHO) classification criteria 
(WHO, 1998). 
 
Table 2.1: Classification of smoking status 
Classification 
Frequency of cigarette smoking 
Daily smoker 
Smokes cigarettes at least once a day (including people who smoke 
every day but have to stop temporarily because of religious fasting or 
medical reasons)  
Occasional smoker 
Smokes cigarettes but not every day 
Ex-smoker 
Formerly a daily smoker, but currently does not smoke at all 
Non-smoker 
Never smoked before or smoked too little in the past to be regarded 
as an ex-smoker 


 
20 
 
Methodology 
An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used. The questionnaire was based on 
WHO’s recommended core questions for assessing smoking status (WHO,1998). 
 
Smoking Status 
The survey showed that among Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years, 8.8% were 
daily smokers, 2.7% were occasional smokers, 8.5% were ex-smokers and 79.9% were 
non-smokers (Table 2.2).

Prevalence of Daily Smoking  
The prevalence of daily smoking among Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years was 
15.7% among males and 2.3% among females (Table 2.3). Daily smoking was most 
prevalent for males in the 50 to 59 years age group (20.7%) and for females in the 40 to 
49 years age group (3.4%). Daily smoking prevalence was higher among Malays (16.0%) 
than Chinese (7.6%) and Indians (9.8%) (Graph 2.1). The prevalence of daily smoking 
among residents with primary education (17.6%) was more than three times higher than 
residents with post-secondary education (5.2%) (Table 2.4).

Age of Initiation and Onset of Daily Smoking Among Daily Smokers 
Among Singapore residents who are daily smokers, the mean age of initiation, or the age 
at which they first tried smoking, was 18 years old. The mean age at which they 
established their habit of daily smoking was 19 years old. Among the younger daily 
smokers aged 18 to 24 years, the mean age of initiation and age at which they established 
their daily smoking habit was 17 and 18 years old respectively. Such information help to 
establish more targeted interventions aim at younger adults to prevent or delay their 
smoking initiation.  
 
Smoking Intensity of Daily Smokers 
The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day among the daily smokers was 12 
cigarettes. Male daily smokers on average smoked more cigarettes per day (12 cigarettes) 
than female daily smokers (8 cigarettes). Daily smokers in the 50 to 59 years age group 
on average smoked the highest number of cigarettes per day (13 cigarettes), compared 
to the other age groups.

Quit Intention of Daily Smokers 
About half (46.5%) of the daily smokers had intention to quit smoking. However, only 
about one in six (18.2%) daily smokers planned to quit smoking within the next 12 months 
or less. Around one in four (25.6%) daily smokers did not plan to quit smoking at all but 
planned to cut down on the number of cigarettes smoked. Over one in four (27.9%) daily 
smokers did not plan to quit smoking or reduce the number of cigarettes smoked. Daily 
smokers who had abstained from smoking for a period of at least 24 hours in the past 12 
months reported that on average they had tried quitting smoking three times during the 
past 12 months preceding the survey.  
 
Trends in Daily Smoking  
The crude and age-standardised prevalence of daily smoking decreased significantly 
between 2007 and 2023 (Table 2.4). This downward trend was also significant in adults 
aged 18 to 49 years, among males and females, among the Chinese and Malays, those 
with secondary and post-secondary education over the same period.  
 
Between 2019 and 2023, the overall crude and age-standardized prevalence of daily 
smoking also decreased significantly. There was a significant decrease in daily smoking 
prevalence among males, among Chinese and Malays and residents with secondary 
education over the last five years.

Physical Activity 
 
Key Points 
• Based on all domains of physical activity (including work-related, transportation-
related and leisure-time), 78.5% of Singapore residents had sufficient total physical 
activity in 2023.  
• More males (80.0%) compared with females (76.9%) were able to meet the 
recommended total physical activity level.  
• Young adults in the 18 to 29 years age group (85.5%) had the highest level of 
sufficient total physical activity while the older adults aged 60 to 74 years had the 
lowest proportion at 74.2%.  
• The largest contributor to total physical activity per week was commuting (45.6%), 
followed by leisure-time physical activity (29.1%) and work-related physical activity 
(25.3%).   
• About one in three (33.7%) Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years reported 
having sufficient muscle-strengthening activities in 2023. 
• This was more common among younger adults aged 18 to 29 years (42.3%) while 
the proportion with sufficient muscle-strengthening activities dropped to around one-
third or less for those aged 30 to 74 years. 
• There was higher proportion of males (40.4%) with sufficient muscle-strengthening 
activities compared with females (27.3%). 
 
Introduction 
Physical activity is important for maintaining good health for all ages. For adults, it has 
been shown to reduce the risk of premature death in general and in particular the risk of 
developing cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. In addition, 
physical activity improves mental and cognitive health, sleep and prevents unhealthy 
weight gain. In older adults aged 65 years and above, those who are physically active are 
less likely to experience falls and falls-related injuries and have better functional capacity 
and mobility to live longer independently (US Department of Health and Human Services 
2018; WHO 2020; WHO 2010).  


 
25 
 
Methodology 
An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used. Respondents were asked about the 
frequency, duration, and intensity of physical activity in the domain of work, transportation 
and leisure6 using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) Analysis Guide 
developed by WHO in 2014. Physical activity participation was assessed and could be 
achieved in one single session or accumulated in bouts of at least 10 minutes throughout 
the day. 
 
Total Physical Activity 
WHO guidelines recognise that participation in physical activity can be achieved across 
three domains: work-related activity (paid or unpaid work including household chores), 
transportation-related activity (e.g. walking or cycling while travelling to and from places) 
and leisure-time physical activity; and recommend that adults should do at least 150 
minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity 
physical activity or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity 
physical activity per week (WHO 2020; WHO 2010). This recommendation is equivalent 
to achieving a minimum of at least 600 MET7 minutes per week (i.e., having sufficient 
total physical activity). 
 
Prevalence of Sufficient Total Physical Activity 
In 2023, 78.5% of Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years had sufficient total physical 
activity (Table 3.1). More males (80.0%) compared with females (76.9%) were able to 
meet the recommended total physical activity level. Physical activity participation was 
observed to decrease with age - young adults in the 18 to 29 years age group (85.5%) 
had the highest level of sufficient total physical activity while the older adults aged 60 to 
74 years had the lowest proportion at 74.2%. A higher proportion of Indians (84.1%) had 
sufficient total physical activity than the Malays (80.1%) and Chinese (77.2%) (Graph 3.1). 
Residents with post-secondary education (80.8%) had higher sufficient total physical 
activity compared with residents with secondary (76.3%) or primary (68.9%) education 
(Table 3.2). The largest contributor to total physical activity per week was commuting 
(45.6%), followed by leisure-time physical activity (29.1%) and work-related physical 
activity (25.3%). 
 
6 Starting from NPHS 2022, the National Population Health Survey will no longer report the participation on 
leisure-time physical activity. For information regarding sports and exercise participation among Singapore 
residents, please refer to the National Sport Participation Survey (NSPS). 
 
7 MET (Metabolic Equivalents) is the ratio of a person’s working metabolic rate relative to the resting 
metabolic rate. 1MET is defined as the energy cost of sitting quietly and is equivalent to a caloric 
consumption of 1kcal/kg/hour.

Trends in Sufficient Total Physical Activity 
The decreasing trend in the proportion of residents with sufficient total physical activity 
was only significant for primary and secondary educated residents between 2007 and 
2023 but not at the overall level or for other subgroups (Table 3.2). Similar declines in 
sufficient total physical activity were observed in all subgroups in the period 2019 to 2023 
but the declines were all not significant.

Muscle-Strengthening Activity 
WHO also recommends that adults should do muscle-strengthening activities involving 
the major muscle groups at least two days or more in a week. Muscle-strengthening 
activity refers to an activity or exercise that increases skeletal muscle strength, power, 
endurance and mass (e.g., strength training, resistance training or muscular strength and 
endurance exercises) and may involves the use of weight machines, exercise bands, 
hand-held weights or own body weight (e.g., push-ups or sit-ups) (WHO 2010; Bennie et 
al. 2019). The major muscle groups to work on include the legs, back, abdomen, chest, 
shoulders and arms (WHO 2010). It has been shown that muscle-strengthening exercises 
increase skeletal muscle strength and mass, bone density, ability to perform activities of 
daily living, improve cardiometabolic heath and reduce symptoms of anxiety and 
depression (Bennie et al. 2019).  
 
Methodology 
Information on muscles-strengthening activities were collected since 2020 using an 
interviewer administered questionnaire. Respondents were asked about the number of 
days in a typical week that they do physical activities or exercises to strengthen their 
muscles. Respondents must complete at least one set of exercises involving eight to 12 
repetitions to be counted as having done one day of muscle-strengthening activities. 
Respondents were classified as having sufficient muscle-strengthening activities if the 
frequency of muscle-strengthening activities are at least two days per week.  
 
Prevalence of Sufficient Muscle-Strengthening Activities 
About one in three (33.7%) Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years reported having 
sufficient muscle-strengthening activities in 2023 (Table 3.3). This was more common 
among younger adults aged 18 to 29 years (42.3%) while the proportion with sufficient 
muscle-strengthening activities dropped to around one-third or less for those aged 30 to 
74 years. Males (40.4%) had higher proportion with sufficient muscle-strengthening 
activities compared with females (27.3%). The proportion of males with sufficient muscle-
strengthening activities in the ages 18 to 29 years was almost twice that of females in the 
same age group and this difference narrowed for older age groups.

(Graph 3.2). Similar proportion of Malay (34.0%) and Chinese (32.1%) residents reported 
having sufficient muscle-strengthening activities in 2023. Among the subgroups, Malay 
(26.1%) and Chinese (25.6%) females had the lowest participation in sufficient muscle-
strengthening activities. Residents with post-secondary education (38.0%) had higher 
proportion with sufficient muscle-strengthening activities compared with residents with 
secondary (28.2%) or primary (19.4%) education (Table 3.4).

Self-reported Diabetes Mellitus 
 
Key Points 
• About one in 14 (7.3%) Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years reported that they 
had diabetes mellitus and were currently prescribed medication in 2023.  
• A higher proportion of males (8.1%) reported having diabetes compared to females 
(6.6%).  
• The prevalence of self-reported diabetes mellitus increased with age, from 1.0% in 
young adults aged 30 to 39 years to 22.3% among those aged 70 to 74 years. 
 
Introduction 
Diabetes mellitus represents a group of metabolic disorders characterised by high blood 
sugar (hyperglycemia) resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. 
Diabetes mellitus can lead to death and disability through long-term complications such 
as blindness, kidney failure, coronary heart disease and stroke. Type 2 diabetes is the 
more common form of diabetes, occurring mainly in older adults and is associated with 
obesity (WHO, 2019). 
 
Methodology 
An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to obtain an indication of the 
prevalence of known diabetes mellitus in the community. Respondents were asked 
whether they had ever been told by a western-trained doctor that they had diabetes and 
were currently prescribed medication for diabetes. Respondents who answered “yes” to 
both questions were classified as having “reported diabetes mellitus”. Diabetes mellitus 
prevalence estimates based on reported use of medication for diabetes mellitus are likely 
to be under-estimated as there will be a proportion of undiagnosed diabetics who were 
not aware of their condition at the time of the survey. Among those with self-reported 
diabetes, they were also asked on the frequency of doctor’s visit and place of treatment 
to manage their diabetes.

Prevalence of Self-reported Diabetes Mellitus 
The prevalence of self-reported diabetes among Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years 
was 7.3% (Table 4.1). A higher proportion of males (8.1%) were reported as diabetic 
compared to females (6.6%) and this pattern was also observed in all age groups. Self-
reported diabetes prevalence increased with age; from 1.0% among those aged 30 to 39 
years to 22.3% in those aged 70 to 74 years. Indians (13.5%) had the highest prevalence 
of self-reported diabetes, compared to Malays (10.7%) and Chinese (6.2%) (Graph 4.1). 
Residents with post-secondary (3.7%) education had lower self-reported diabetes 
prevalence compared to residents with secondary (12.1%) or primary education (18.8%) 
(Table 4.2). Residents with self-reported diabetes visited their doctors for the 
management of their diabetes about four times on average in the past 12 months, mainly 
in polyclinics (63.2%), private GP clinics (21.3%) and specialist outpatient clinics in public 
hospitals (12.6%).

Trends in Prevalence of Self-reported Diabetes Mellitus 
The crude and age-standardised prevalence of self-reported diabetes among 
Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years showed a significant increasing trend 
between 2007 and 2023 (Table 4.2). This significant increase was also observed 
among residents aged 60 to 69 years, and across all sexes, ethnic groups and 
education levels.  
 
On the other hand, for the most recent five year period, there was a significant 
decrease in the prevalence of self-reported diabetes for residents aged 40 to 49 years 
from 2019 (5.0%) to 2023 (2.8%). The  prevalence of self-reported diabetes for overall 
level and other subgroups remained stable during this period.

Self-reported Hypertension 
 
Key Points 
• In 2023, about one in six (15.0%) Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years reported 
that they had hypertension (or high blood pressure) and were currently prescribed 
medication.  
• A higher proportion of males (15.9%) reported having hypertension than females 
(14.2%).  
• The prevalence of self-reported hypertension increased with age, from 2.4% in 
young adults aged 30 to 39 years to 47.7% among those aged 70 to 74 years. 
 
Introduction 
Hypertension or high blood pressure is a condition in which the blood vessels have 
persistently raised pressure. It is often known as a silent killer as it rarely causes 
symptoms and many people go undiagnosed. Hypertension is one of the key risk factors 
for cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack, stroke and heart failure as well as other 
diseases like kidney failure. Dietary and lifestyle changes can improve blood pressure 
control and decrease the risk of associated health complications, although drug treatment 
may be necessary in patients for whom lifestyle changes prove ineffective or insufficient 
(WHO, 2013). 
 
Methodology 
An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to obtain an indication of the 
prevalence of known hypertension in the community. Respondents were asked whether 
they had ever been told by a western-trained doctor that they had high blood pressure 
and were currently prescribed medication for high blood pressure. Respondents who 
answered “yes” to both questions were classified as having “reported hypertension”. 
Hypertension prevalence estimates based on reported use of medication for high blood 
pressure are likely to be under-estimated as there will be a proportion of undiagnosed 
hypertensives who were not aware of their condition at the time of the survey. Among 
those with self-reported hypertension, they were also asked on the frequency of doctor’s 
visit and place of treatment to manage their hypertension.

Prevalence of Self-reported Hypertension 
The prevalence of self-reported hypertension among Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 
years was 15.0% (Table 5.1). A higher percentage of males (15.9%) were reported as 
hypertensive compared to females (14.2%) and this trend was observed across most age 
groups except for those aged 70 to 74 years. Self-reported hypertension prevalence was 
also found to increase with age, from 2.4% among younger adults aged 30 to 39 years to 
47.7% among older adults aged 70 to 74 years. Among the ethnic groups, Malays (18.9%) 
had the highest prevalence of self-reported hypertension, followed by Chinese (14.9%) 
and Indians (11.9%) (Graph 5.1). The prevalence of self-reported hypertension was 
higher among Malay and Indian males compared to females while the pattern was reverse 
among the Chinese where males had higher prevalence of self-reported hypertension 
than females.   
 
Residents with post-secondary education had much lower prevalence of self-reported 
hypertension (8.7%) compared to those with secondary (22.1%) or primary education 
(38.0%) (Table 5.2).  Residents with self-reported hypertension visited their doctors for 
the management of their high blood pressure about three times on average in the past 
12 months, mainly in polyclinics (53.7%), private GP clinics (30.8%) and specialist 
outpatient clinics in public hospitals (11.8%).

Trends in Prevalence of Self-reported Hypertension 
There was a significant increase in the crude prevalence of self-reported hypertension 
between 2007 to 2023 but the age-standardised prevalence did not show a significant 
increase over the same period (Table 5.2). This increase was also observed among 
Chinese, in both sexes, and across all education levels.  
 
Between 2019 and 2023, the prevalence of self-reported hypertension at the overall 
level and for the other demographics profiles remained stable except for the 40 to 49 
years age group where the prevalence trended downward significantly.

Self-reported Hyperlipidaemia 
 
Key Points 
• About one in six (15.3%) Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years reported that 
they had hyperlipidaemia (or high blood cholesterol) and were currently prescribed 
medication in 2023.  
• More males (16.9%) reported having high blood cholesterol than females (13.7%).  
• The prevalence of self-reported high blood cholesterol increased with age, from 
1.7% in young adults aged 30 to 39 years to 50.9% among those aged 70 to 74 
years. 
 
Introduction 
Hyperlipidaemia or high blood cholesterol is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. 
Elevated blood cholesterol, in particular LDL-cholesterol, causes atherosclerosis and 
increases the risk for coronary heart disease. HDL-cholesterol has been shown to have 
a protective effect against coronary heart disease. Low HDL-cholesterol has been shown 
to be an important independent risk factor for development of coronary heart disease. 
Population-based (public health) approaches through the adoption of healthier lifestyle 
behaviours such as reduced dietary intake of saturated fats and cholesterol, being more 
physically active, and better weight control as well as clinical management of those 
persons at increased risk are important factors in lowering the cholesterol levels in the 
population (JAMA 2001; NIH 2002). 
 
Methodology 
An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to obtain an indication of the 
prevalence of known high blood cholesterol in the community. Respondents were asked 
whether they had ever been told by a western-trained doctor that they had high blood 
cholesterol and were currently prescribed medication for high blood cholesterol. 
Respondents who answered “yes” to both questions were classified as having “reported 
high blood cholesterol”. High blood cholesterol prevalence estimates based on reported 
use of medication for high blood cholesterol are likely to be under-estimated as there will 
be a proportion of residents with undiagnosed high blood cholesterol who were aware of 
their condition at the time of the survey. Among those with self-reported high blood 
cholesterol, they were also asked on the frequency of doctor’s visit and place of treatment 
to manage their high blood cholesterol.

Prevalence of Self-reported Hyperlipidaemia 
The prevalence of self-reported high blood cholesterol among Singapore residents aged 
18 to 74 years was 15.3% (Table 6.1). Overall, a higher proportion of males (16.9%) 
reported having hyperlipidaemia compared to females (13.7%). This was observed 
across all age groups and ethnicities except for older adults aged 70 to 74 years, where 
a higher proportion of females (54.2%) reported having high blood cholesterol compared 
to males (47.1%). The prevalence of self-reported high blood cholesterol was also found 
to increase with age, from 1.7% among younger adults aged 30 to 39 years to 50.9% 
among those aged 70 to 74 years.  
 
Malays (16.4%) had slightly higher prevalence of self-reported high blood cholesterol 
among the ethnic groups compared to Indians (15.5%) and Chinese (15.2%) (Graph 6.1). 
Close to two in five (37.5%) residents with primary education reported having high blood 
cholesterol, which was higher than those with secondary (22.2%) or post-secondary 
education (9.1%). Residents with self-reported hyperlipidaemia visited their doctors for 
the management of their high blood cholesterol about three times on average in the past 
12 months, mainly in polyclinics (56.2%), private GP clinics (26.7%) and specialist 
outpatient clinics in public hospitals (11.5%).

Trends in Prevalence of Self-reported Hyperlipidaemia 
The crude prevalence of self-reported hyperlipidaemia increased significantly from 
2007 to 2023 (Table 6.2) while the age-standardised prevalence did not show similar 
trend over the same period. There were significant increases observed among older 
adults aged 70 to 74 years, in both sexes, across all education levels, and among 
Chinese and Indians over the same period.  
 
Between 2019 and 2023, significant increases were also seen among females and 
older adults aged 60 to 74 years while the prevalence for other subgroups remained 
stable.

Chronic Disease Screening 
 
Key Points 
• Among Singapore residents aged 40 to 74 years with no previous diagnosis of 
diabetes, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol (“DHL”), (i.e. not told by 
a doctor that they have these diseases), about three-fifths (62.6%) were screened 
for all three health conditions within the recommended screening guidelines in 2023. 
• Among Singapore residents aged 40 to 74 years without known diabetes, 76.7% 
had their blood glucose tested within the past three years. 
• Among Singapore residents aged 40 to 74 years without known high blood 
pressure, 82.7% did their blood pressure check in the past two years.  
• Among Singapore residents aged 40 to 74 years without known high blood 
cholesterol, 74.7% were screened within the past three years. 
 
Introduction 
Health screening is an effective strategy for disease prevention in the population. It is 
important to go for appropriate and regular health screening as it helps to detect risk 
factors or diseases early even when there are no symptoms. Early detection of diabetes 
mellitus, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol could result in better treatment, 
fewer complications and increased chances of better outcomes (HPB, 2019). 
 
Methodology 
An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used. Respondents were asked whether 
they were ever told by a doctor that they had diabetes, high blood pressure or high blood 
cholesterol. Respondents who reported that they were not told by a doctor that they have 
diabetes or high blood cholesterol were asked on the last time they had a blood test to 
check for these health conditions. Those who were not told by a doctor to have high blood 
pressure were asked on the last time they had checked their blood pressure. 
Respondents were also asked where they last had their screening for these chronic 
diseases. The national “Screen for Life” (SFL) screening programme which takes 
reference 
from 
the 
Screening 
Test 
Review 
Committee’s 
recommendations, 
recommended that Singapore residents aged 40 years and above to go for diabetes and 
hyperlipidaemia screening once every three years and hypertension screening once 
every two years.

Practice of Health Screening 
Health screening practice was relatively common among Singapore residents aged 40 to 
74 years who were not told by a doctor to have any chronic diseases (diabetes, high blood 
pressure and high blood cholesterol (DHL)). 62.6% of them were screened for all three 
health conditions within the recommended screening guidelines in 2023 (Table 7.1). The 
majority of them with no known DHL were screened at the private GP clinics at 39.7%, 
followed by polyclinics (17.1%), specialist outpatient clinics in public hospitals (11.8%) 
and specialist outpatient clinics in private hospitals (10.3%) 
 
Health screening practice was found to be more prevalent among older adults aged 70 to 
74 years, with two-thirds of them (66.0%) having screened for all three health conditions 
within the recommended screening guidelines. Among the ethnic groups, Indians (78.4%) 
had a higher screening prevalence for all three chronic diseases, followed by Chinese 
(61.4%) and Malays (52.6%). Singapore residents with post-education (67.6%) were 
more likely to have gone for chronic disease screening compared to those with lower 
education level (primary education: 51.6%, secondary education: 55.6%). 
 
Looking at individual chronic disease alone regardless of the co-morbidity with the other 
two chronic diseases, 76.7% of adults aged 40 to 74 years without known diabetes were 
screened for diabetes within the past three years, 82.7% of those without known high 
blood pressure had their blood pressure checked within the past two years, and 74.7% of 
them with no previous diagnosis of high blood cholesterol were screened for this health 
condition within the past three years (Tables 7.3 to 7.5).   
 
Trends in Health Screening 
Looking at the trend data over the period from 2007 to 2023, significant increases in the 
screening participation for residents with no previous diagnosis of DHL were observed 
among those aged 40 to 49 years and those with post-secondary education (Table 7.2). 
The overall and age-standardised chronic disease screening participation did not show 
significant upward trend between 2007 and 2023. 
 
For the individual chronic disease, the crude proportion of residents who had diabetes 
and hypertension screening increased significantly from 2007 to 2023 while the 
proportion screening for hyperlipidaemia did not show significant upward trend over the 
same period (Tables 7.3 to 7.5).  For diabetes, the screening participation improved in 
the age groups of 40 to 49 years and 70 to 74 years; in both sexes, among Chinese and 
Indians, and those with post-secondary education. For hypertension, the significant 
improvements were observed for both sexes and those aged 40 to 49 years.  


 
45 
 
Between 2019 and 2023, the screening participation for residents without known DHL 
and for the individual chronic disease fell, though the decrease was not significant. 
Significant decreases in diabetes screening participation were observed among 
Singapore residents in the age group of 40 to 49 years and among males, Chinese and 
Indians during this period.

Breast Cancer Screening 
 
Key Points 
• 
In 2023, slightly more than one-third (34.7%) of Singapore women in the 50 to 69 
years age group reported that they had gone for mammography in the last two 
years. 
 
Introduction 
Breast cancer remained the most common cancer among Singapore women in the past 
50 years (NRDO 2024). For the latest five-year period from 2018-2022, it accounted for 
24.4% (about 1 in 4) cancer diagnoses in females, and the age-standardised incidence 
rate of breast cancer was 76.2 per 100,000 women. It was the leading cause of cancer 
death among females in 2018-2022, accounting for 17.1% of cancer deaths among 
females.  
 
Breast cancer has been linked to a number of risk factors including age, family history of 
breast cancer, smoking, high-fat diet and obesity. The earlier breast cancer is diagnosed, 
the better the chances for successful treatment. As early breast cancer usually does not 
present with any symptoms, screening is therefore important. Mammography for women 
over 50 years old is widely accepted as appropriate and beneficial. The national “Screen 
for Life” (SFL) screening programme which takes reference from the Screening Test 
Review Committee’s recommendations, recommended that women aged 50 to 69 years 
to go for mammography once every two years. 
 
Methodology 
An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used. Female respondents were asked 
on their practice of mammography as well as where they took their mammography.

Practice of Mammography  
In 2023, slightly more than one-third (34.7%) of Singapore women in the 50 to 69 years 
age group reported that they had gone for a mammography within the last two years, in 
accordance with the recommended frequency of mammography in this age group (Table 
8.1). Ever-married women (35.6%) were more likely to have a mammography within the 
last two years than never married women (28.4%). A higher proportion of Indian (40.4%) 
and Chinese (36.6%) women had undergone mammography compared to their Malay 
counterparts (16.9%) (Table 8.2). Women with post-secondary education (44.6%) were 
more likely to go for screening than women with secondary education (31.5%) or primary 
education (20.8%). More than two-fifths (45.3%) of the women had their mammogram 
taken in the polyclinics, followed by public hospitals (24.0%), private hospitals (14.4%) 
and private X-ray centres (10.7%).

Trends in Breast Cancer Screening 
Between 2007 and 2023, the decrease in screening participation for breast cancer was 
only significant for females with secondary and post-secondary education while the 
downward trends for overall and other groups were not significant (Table 8.2).  
 
Comparing 2023 with the pre-COVID-19 period in 2019, there was no significant change 
in the breast cancer screening participation at the overall or any of the subgroup levels.

Cervical Cancer Screening 
 
Key Points 
• 
In 2023, more than two in five (45.4%) Singapore female residents aged 25 to 74 
years reported that they had gone for cervical cancer screening (had done Pap test 
in the past three years or HPV test in the past five years). 
• 
Women aged 30 to 59 years (more than 50%) were most likely to have undergone 
cervical cancer screening. 
 
Introduction 
Cervical cancer was the 10th most common cancer among women in Singapore for the 
latest five-year period from 2018-2022, accounting for 2.5% of cancer diagnoses in 
females (NRDO 2024). During this period, the age-standardised incidence rate of cervical 
cancer was 6.8 per 100,000 women and it accounted for 2.4% of all cancer deaths among 
females.  
 
Major risk factors for cervical cancer include having sexual intercourse at an early age, 
having multiple sexual partners and infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) (the 
cause of genital warts). Long term consumption of combined oral contraceptive pills and 
cigarette smoking are also the risk factors8.  
 
Based on the latest recommendations on cervical cancer screening in 20199, women 
aged 25 to 29 years are recommended to undergo a Pap test at a three yearly interval 
while women aged 30 years and above are recommended to take a HPV test at a five-
yearly interval.

Methodology 
An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used. Female respondents were asked 
on their practice of cervical cancer screening as well as where they took the test; and 
which test (Pap test/ HPV test) was taken.      
 
Practice of Cervical Cancer Screening  
In 2023, among women aged 25 to 74 years, more than two in five (45.4%) Singapore 
women aged 25 to 74 years had undergone cervical cancer screening (had done a Pap 
test in the past three years or HPV test in the past five years) (Table 9.1). The proportion 
of women who had undergone cervical cancer screening was higher among ever-married 
women (52.9%) than women who were never married (20.2%). Chinese (46.9%) and 
Indian (46.2%) women were more likely to have undergone cervical cancer screening 
compared to Malays (31.4%) women (Table 9.2). Women aged 30 to 59 years were the 
most likely to have undergone cervical cancer screening. Women with post-secondary 
education (52.7%) were more likely to have undergone cervical cancer screening 
compared to those with secondary (34.5%) or primary education (26.7%). The majority of 
the women had their last cervical cancer screening in private GP clinics (25.1%), followed 
by specialist outpatient clinics in the public hospitals (23.0%), polyclinics (19.6%) or 
specialist outpatient clinics in the private hospitals (18.6%).

Trends in Cervical Cancer Screening 
The crude and age-standardised screening participation for cervical cancer decreased 
significantly from 2007 to 2023 (Table 9.2). Significant decreases were also seen in some 
age groups (25 to 29 years, 30 to 39 years and 70 to 74 years), across all education 
levels and among Chinese and Malay women.  
 
Between 2019 and 2023, similar decreasing trends in screening participation were also 
observed at the overall and subgroup levels though most decreases were not significant 
except in the 70 to 74 years age group.

Colorectal Cancer Screening 
 
Key Points 
• In 2023, 41.7% of Singapore residents aged 50 to 74 years had undergone 
colorectal screening within the recommended screening frequency.  
• Approximately one in four of these residents aged 50 to 74 years reported having 
undergone a Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) at least once in the past one year 
(24.1%) or  had undergone colonoscopy in the past 10 years (27.7%). 
• The practice of taking a FIT or a colonoscopy was more prevalent among males 
(43.8%) than females (39.6%). 
 
Introduction 
Colorectal cancer was the most common and second most common cancer among 
Singapore men and women respectively for the latest five-year period from 2018-2022, 
accounting for 16.2% of cancer diagnoses in males and 12.9% of cancer diagnoses in 
females (NRDO 2024). During this period, the age-standardised incidence rate of 
colorectal cancer was 37.9 per 100,000 men and 27.0 per 100,000 women respectively 
and it accounted for 14.3% of cancer deaths in males and 15.6% of cancer deaths in 
females. 
 
Factors that have been associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer include specific 
hereditary conditions, older age, inflammatory bowel diseases, regular high saturated 
fat/low fiber diet, excessive alcohol intake and sedentary lifestyle10.  
 
Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) and colonoscopy are able to detect colorectal cancer 
at an early stage. The Screening Test Review Committee recommends annual screening 
for colorectal cancer using FIT for people aged 50 years and older who are at average 
risk for colorectal cancer. For a person who is tested positive for FIT, colonoscopy is the 
confirmatory diagnostic investigations.

Methodology 
An interviewer administered questionnaire was used. Respondents were asked whether 
they had ever done a FIT or colonoscopy, and where they took the FIT. 
 
Practice of FIT 
Based on the survey, 24.1% of Singapore residents aged 50 to 74 years reported to have 
a FIT in the last one year (Table 10.1). Higher proportion of males (26.0%) than females 
(22.2%) had undergone a FIT in the last one year. Chinese (25.7%) were more likely to 
take a FIT compared to Malays (10.5%) and Indians (14.6%). Higher proportion of 
residents with post-secondary (32.9%) had done a FIT in the last one year compared to 
residents with secondary (19.0%) or primary (15.3%) education. The majority of 
Singapore residents had their last FIT in private GP clinics (29.4%), followed by 
polyclinics (16.4%) and specialist outpatient clinics in the public hospitals (14.9%). More 
than one in five (22.3%) residents tested using the FIT kit that they had collected from 
pharmacies, clinics or Singapore Cancer Society. 
 
Practice of Colonoscopy  
27.7% of Singapore residents aged 50 to 74 years reported to have undergone a 
colonoscopy in the last 10 years (Table 10.1). Similar to the practice of FIT, the practice 
of colonoscopy was more prevalent among males (28.6%) than females (26.8%). 
Chinese (30.0%) were more likely to have undergone a colonoscopy compared to Malays 
(17.2%) and Indians (16.6%). By education attainment, more than one-third (34.9%) of 
residents with post-secondary had a colonoscopy in the last 10 years compared to 
residents with secondary (26.4%) or primary (15.8%) education.

Trends in Colorectal Cancer Screening 
Any residents who took a FIT in the last one year or had undergone a colonoscopy in the 
last 10 years are considered as having been screened for colorectal cancer. In 2023, 
41.7% of Singapore residents aged 50 to 74 years had undergone colorectal screening 
within the recommended screening frequency (Table 10.2). Females (39.6%) had lower 
screening participation compared to males (43.8%). Malay residents (23.7%) had lower 
screening participation compared to Chinese (44.6%) and Indian (35.0%) residents. In 
general, residents with higher education levels were more likely to have screened for 
colorectal cancer, where more than one in two (52.9%) residents with post-secondary 
education had done the screening compared to almost two in five (37.9%) residents with 
secondary education and about one in four (26.0%) residents with primary education. 
 


 
59 
 
The crude and age-standardised screening rate for colorectal cancer rose significantly 
from 2007 to 2023 (Table 10.2). The increase was seen across all ages, sex, education 
and ethnic groups over this period.  
 
The overall colorectal cancer screening participation in 2023 (41.7%) was similar to that 
of 2019 (42.0%). No significant changes were observed across all subgroups between 
the period of 2019 to 2023.

Chapter 11 
Self-reported Vaccination Uptake 
 
Key Points 
• In 2023, approximately one in five (21.7%) Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years 
reported that they had received influenza vaccination in the past 12 months. 
• The self-reported influenza vaccination uptake among males (22.1%) was similar 
than females (21.4%). 
• All the ethnic groups had similar self-reported influenza vaccination uptake  (Malays: 
23.1%, Indians: 22.3% and Chinese: 21.4%). 
• The proportion of elderly aged 65 to 74 years who reported ever having received 
pneumococcal vaccination was 35.0% in 2023. 
 
Introduction 
Seasonal influenza, which is commonly called flu, is a respiratory illness caused by 
influenza viruses which is highly contagious. For healthy individuals, influenza is usually 
self-limiting. However, it can sometimes lead to complications and even death. Those 
who are at risk of serious flu complications such as older persons, young children, adults 
and children with certain medical conditions and pregnant women should get vaccinated11. 
Annual influenza vaccination is recommended under the National Childhood 
Immunisation Schedule (NCIS) and National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS) for 
these groups of persons12.

Pneumococcal vaccine helps to prevent pneumococcal disease caused by the bacteria 
Streptococcus pneumonia. It can cause a wide spectrum of illnesses and disease burden 
is greater at the extremes of ages, that is, those less than five years old and those older 
than 65 years old, as well as those with certain medical conditions. These include 
infection of the lungs (pneumonia), ear (otitis media), brain (meningitis) and blood 
(bacteremia)13. The NAIS and NCIS recommends all persons aged 65 years or older to 
be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease, as well as other groups of persons at 
higher risk of complications from pneumococcal infection12. 
 
Methodology 
An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to measure the uptake of both 
vaccinations. Respondents were asked “In the past 12 months, have you had an injection 
to protect you from getting flu?” and “Have you ever had pneumococcal vaccination?”  
 
Self-reported Influenza Vaccination 
The self-reported influenza vaccination among Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years 
was 21.7% in 2023, with the proportion being similar among males (22.1%) and females 
(21.4%). Singapore residents aged 65 to 74 years had the highest self-reported influenza 
vaccination at 40.6% and more than double the proportion of residents vaccinated in the 
other age groups (Table 11.1). All the ethnic groups had similar self-reported influenza 
vaccination uptake with Malays at 23.1%, Indians at 22.3%, and Chinese at 21.4% (Graph 
11.1).

Trends in Self-reported Influenza Vaccination Uptake 
Among Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years, the crude and age-standardised self-
reported influenza vaccination uptake showed a significant increasing trend between 
2017 and 2023 (Table 11.2). Similar increases were observed among some age groups 
(30 to 39 years, and 65 to 74 years), in both sexes, among Chinese and residents with 
primary and secondary education during this period. 
 
Between 2019 and 2023 there was a significant improvement in influenza vaccination 
uptake reported among residents aged 30 to 39 years, among males, and those with 
primary education. 
 
Self-reported Pneumococcal Vaccination Uptake Among Elderly 
The proportion of elderly aged 65 to 74 years who reported ever having received 
pneumococcal vaccination was 35.0% in 2023, with similar proportion reported among 
males (35.0%) and females (34.9%) (Table 11.3). Among the ethnic groups, Chinese 
(36.7%) had higher self-reported pneumococcal vaccination uptake than Malays (29.2%) 
and Indians (27.8%). In 2023, pneumococcal vaccination uptake increased with 
education attainment at 28.4%, 33.4%, and 46.4% for residents with primary education, 
secondary education, and post-secondary education, respectively.

Mental Health 
 
Key Points 
• The prevalence of poor mental health, as measured by the 12-item General Health 
Questionnaire (GHQ-12), among Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years was 
15.0% in 2023. 
• More females (17.6%) reported poor mental health compared to males (12.2%) in 
2023.  
• Younger adults aged 18 to 29 years had the highest proportion (26.0%) with poor 
mental health while the prevalence for other age groups were much lower, ranging 
from 8.2% for the 60 to 74 years age group to 17.2% for the 30 to 39 years age 
group. 
• In 2023, Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years indicated that they were more 
willing to seek help informally from their support network (78.4%) than formally from 
healthcare professionals (62.8%) if they were constantly unable to cope with stress. 
• In 2023, females were more willing to seek help from healthcare professionals and 
informal support networks compared to males (females: 63.3% and 81.6% 
respectively; males: 62.3% and 75.1% respectively). 
• Among the age groups, Singapore residents in the oldest age band (60 to 74 years) 
(51.2%) were least willing to seek help from healthcare professionals while those 
aged 30 to 39 years (71.9%) were the most willing to do so in 2023. 
• Similarly, the proportion of Singapore residents who were willing to seek help from 
informal support networks decreased with age -- it was the highest among younger 
adults aged 18 to 39 years (85.4% for both 18 to 29 years and 30 to 39 years age 
groups) and lowest among older adults aged 60 to 74 years (65.6%). 
 
Introduction 
The WHO defines mental health as more than the absence of mental disorders. It is also 
a state of well-being in which the individual realises his or her own abilities, is able to cope 
with the normal stresses of life, work productively and fruitfully, and contribute to his or 
her community. A person’s mental health may be affected by multiple interrelated social, 
psychological and biological factors (WHO 2007).

Methodology 
The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was administered by interviewers 
and used to measure mental health. Cut-off for poor mental health (having a score of 3 
or more) was based on an earlier internal validation study conducted in 2003.  
 
Prevalence of Poor Mental Health 
The prevalence of poor mental health as measured by GHQ-12, among Singapore 
residents aged 18 to 74 years was 15.0% in 2023 (Table 12.1). More females (17.6%) 
reported poor mental health compared to males (12.2%). Younger adults aged 18 to 29 
years (26.0%) had the highest proportion with poor mental health while the prevalence 
for other age groups were much lower, ranging from 8.2% in the 60 to 74 years age group 
to 17.2% in the 30 to 39 years age group. Among the ethnic groups, Malays (16.1%) and 
Indians (16.1%) had higher proportion with poor mental health compared to Chinese 
(14.7%) (Graph 12.1). The proportion of Indian females (21.1%) with poor mental health 
was almost doubled that of Indian males (11.3%) while the difference in proportion 
between males and females among the Chinese and Malays were much narrower. 
Residents with post-secondary education (16.4%) had higher prevalence of poor mental 
health compared to residents with primary (9.5%) or secondary education (13.4%) (Table 
12.2).

Trends in Prevalence of Poor Mental Health 
The crude and age-standardised prevalence of poor mental health among Singapore 
residents aged 18 to 74 years increased between 2017 and 2023, though these increases 
were not significant (Table 12.2). The only significant increase in the prevalence of poor 
mental health was observed among younger residents aged 18 to 29 years between 2017 
(16.5%) and 2023 (26.0%).

Definition of Help-seeking Attitudes 
Respondents were asked on their willingness to seek help from healthcare professionals 
or informal support networks if they were constantly unable to cope with stress through 
the interviewer-administered questionnaire. Healthcare professionals include counsellors, 
doctors, psychologists or psychiatrists. Informal support networks refer to friends, 
relatives, colleagues, religious leaders and teachers in school. 
 
Help-seeking Attitudes 
In 2023, Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years were more willing to seek help from 
informal support networks (78.4%) than from healthcare professionals (62.8%) if they 
were constantly unable to cope with stress (Tables 12.3 and 12.4). Females were more 
willing to seek help from healthcare professionals and informal support networks 
compared to males. Older adults aged 60 to 74 years (51.2%) were the least willing to 
seek help from healthcare professionals while those aged 30 to 39 years (71.9%) were 
the most willing to seek help from healthcare professionals. Similarly, the willingness to 
seek help from informal support decreased with age, it was highest among younger adults 
aged 18 to 39 years (85.4% for both 18 to 29 years and 30 to 39 years age groups) and 
the lowest among older adults aged 60 to 74 years (65.6%). Those with higher levels of 
educational attainment were more willing to seek help from healthcare professionals and 
informal support networks, it was highest among those with post-secondary education 
and the lowest among those with primary education. 
 
Trends in Help-seeking Attitudes 
There was no trend in the overall proportion of residents who were willing to seek help 
from healthcare professionals between 2019 and 2023 (Table 12.3). Nonetheless, there 
was a significant improvement among residents aged 30 to 49 years, among males and 
females, in Chinese and those with post-secondary education who were more willing to 
seek professional help in 2023 compared to the previous year in 2022. 
 
Likewise, there was no trend in the overall proportion of residents who were willing to 
seek help from informal support networks over the years (2019 to 2023) (Table 12.4). But 
the proportion of Indians who were willing to seek help from informal support networks 
did increase significantly in the last five years.

Chapter 13 Survey Methodology 
 
Study Design and Objectives 
The NPHS is a cross-sectional population health survey series jointly managed by the 
Ministry of Health and Health Promotion Board to track the health and risk factors of the 
Singapore residents. The main objectives of the survey are to monitor the health of 
Singapore residents and track progress towards national targets in the areas of: 
(i) 
risk factors such as alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking and physical 
inactivity; 
(ii) 
diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia; and 
(iii) preventive health behaviours such as chronic disease screening; cervical, breast 
and colorectal cancer screening; and vaccinations.  
 
The survey results were presented for the 18 to 74 years age group for most chapters 
except chronic disease screening, cancer screening and vaccinations. For these few 
chapters, the analyses were confined to relevant age groups recommended for screening 
and immunisation. Data for the “Others” ethnic group were included in the compilation of 
the survey results shown under “Total”, but suppressed in ethnic-specific data of all 
statistical tables due to small counts or high sampling variability.   
 
Ethics Approval 
The NPHS methodology, protocol and procedures were approved by National Healthcare 
Group (NHG) Domain Specific Review Board (Domain F). 
 
Sample Design 
A representative sample of residential addresses was obtained from the Singapore 
Department of Statistics (DOS) who maintains a sampling frame of residential addresses 
for the selection of samples for household surveys. The sample selection was based on 
a two-stage design where the primary sampling units comprised of geographical areas 
and the secondary sampling units were the residential dwelling units.  
 
 
 


 
73 
 
The NPHS design comprised two components – (1) Household Interview (HI) and (2) 
Health Examination (HE). In the first component, a household member aged 18 to 79 
years old (also known as “reference person”) was identified using KISH tables within each 
selected address to participate in the household for a face-to-face questionnaire interview 
(i.e. NPHS HI). Only Singapore citizens and permanent residents were recruited for the 
survey. All reference persons who completed NPHS HI would be invited to undergo a 
health examination (i.e. NPHS HE) at a designated clinic. Physical measurements e.g. 
height, weight, hip and waist circumference, blood pressure levels and bio-specimens 
such as blood and urine samples of survey respondents were collected. The blood and 
urine samples were sent to a medical laboratory to test for blood sugar, cholesterol, 
proteins in urine and other conditions. A full report on the respondent’s health status was 
mailed to him/ her six to eight weeks after the completion of the health examination.  
 
Questionnaire 
An electronic structured questionnaire administrated on a tablet was used in the survey 
to collect information on the demographic, socio-economic, lifestyle practices relating to 
the major non-communicable diseases and risk factors, health conditions, knowledge, 
attitude and practices on health screening as well as the help-seeking attitudes of the 
respondents. The questionnaire was adopted from that of the National Population Health 
Survey 2017 and National Health Surveillance Survey 2013; and included elements of 
the instruments used in the WHO STEP-wise approach to Surveillance of Non-
Communicable Diseases (STEPS) Instrument for Non-Communicable Disease Risk 
Factors and WHO’s Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ).    
 
Invitation Letter and Publicity 
An invitation letter, in four official languages, was mailed to the selected household 
addresses one week prior to visitation by the assigned interviewers. The invitation letter 
provided information on the survey purpose, what the survey comprised and expected 
survey duration. It also informed that an interviewer from a research company 
commissioned by the Ministry of Health and Health Promotion Board would be visiting 
the household to enumerate, select and interview an eligible household member to take 
part in the survey, and assured the household on the confidentiality of all collected 
information. A dedicated NPHS webpage was set-up to provide detailed information on 
the conduct of the NPHS.   
 
 


 
74 
 
Training 
All survey interviewers were given an overview of the survey background and briefed 
extensively on the fieldwork procedures such as procurement of appointments, 
enumeration of household members, selection of eligible household members using KISH 
tables and consent taking for survey participation. They were given training slides on 
survey protocols and questionnaire administration as well as training in administrating the 
electronic questionnaire on a tablet. Fieldworkers carrying out the health examination 
were given training on consent taking and the standard operation procedures for the 
conduct of health examination. These trainings helped to ensure compliance to standards 
and protocols of the survey, and consistency in data collection for the household interview 
and health examination.  
 
Household Interview Fieldwork 
The survey fieldwork was conducted between 01 July 2022 and 30 June 2023. Survey 
interviewers from the appointed research company (National University of Singapore 
(IPS-Social Lab)), commissioned by the Ministry of Health and Health Promotion Board 
visited all the selected household addresses. The interviewers made a minimum of five 
visit attempts, at different times of the day and on different days of a week to establish 
contact with the reference person or household member to conduct the survey or obtain 
a survey appointment if the reference person was unavailable at the point of visit. 
Informed written consent was obtained from the reference person before the interviewer 
administered the questionnaire face-to-face. A token of appreciation was given to the 
reference person who completed the survey interview. All reference persons who 
completed the household interview were invited to go for a health examination and given 
a letter of invitation by the interviewer.  
 
 


 
75 
 
Health Examination Fieldwork 
The health examination fieldwork for NPHS 2023 was carried out between 18 July 2022 
and 28 August 2023 by a healthcare service provider (Healthway Medical Group) 
appointed by the Ministry of Health and Health Promotion Board. Appointment setting 
officers from the service provider provided a reminder call to reference persons two to 
three days prior to their appointments and managed any requests for changes to the 
appointments. At the appointed clinic, informed written consent was obtained by a 
fieldworker before the conduct of the health examination and a token of appreciation was 
given to the reference person after the completion of the health examination.   
 
Data Quality Control 
Informed consent forms validation 
All the informed consent forms from the household interview and health examination were 
checked for completeness and accuracy of information captured. This included checks 
for missing information, consistency of information and any data-entry errors in the 
datasets.  
 
Interview validation 
Data quality control was conducted by a separate team of staff who were not involved in 
the survey interview fieldwork. For each interviewer, 40% of their survey interviews were 
randomly selected and subjected to quality control checks via telephone validation or 
audio audit. At least 30% of all quality control checks were conducted through telephone 
validation where respondents were asked to verify their residential address and 
responses to nine specific fields with the respondents concerned. The remaining 10% of 
the checks were audio audits where a quality control staff listened to segments of the 
interview and checked if the interviewer complied with the stipulated survey protocols in 
administering the questions.   
 
 
 


 
76 
 
Data verification and consistency check 
The electronic survey questionnaire had built-in features that prompt data entry for fields 
that required a response or prompt data re-entry if data entered was outside the logical 
or valid field range. Built-in checks for relational fields were also incorporated to ensure 
that responses for those fields across different sections of the questionnaire were 
consistent. The built-in features and checks ensured that missing values, data-entry 
errors and inconsistent responses were eradicated or kept to the minimum where possible. 
The database on the questionnaire records with the complete survey responses was 
subjected to a series of computer-programmed checks for missing values, valid field 
range and cross-field relational consistency. Missing values were obtained from 
respondents and data anomalies were clarified through direct verification with the 
respondents whenever necessary.  
 
The database on the physical measurements and laboratory results were also checked 
for missing value, valid field range and cross-field relational consistency. Missing values 
and data anomalies were clarified with fieldworkers and corrected where possible.   
 
Data Confidentiality 
Throughout all stages of the survey, strict confidentiality on individual respondent 
information was maintained. All information, including audio recordings, questionnaire 
answers, health examination records collected for this survey, would be kept strictly 
confidential, and stored in a secure, password-protected environment. Any reporting of 
findings would be done on a grouped basis such that no individual survey respondents 
can be identified. The identity of the respondents would remain confidential in publications 
(e.g. in national reports). 
 
Age-Standardisation 
Age-standardisation of prevalence rates take into account the changing age distribution 
of the population over the years and allows for more meaningful trend comparison, 
especially with an ageing population. Age-standardisation of prevalence was calculated 
by the direct method, using the 2020 Census Singapore resident population as the 
standard (reference) population.  
 
 
 


 
77 
 
Response Rate 
From a sample of 10,623 eligible households, 7,624 reference persons aged 18 to 79 
years participated in the household interview, forming a response rate of 71.8% in NPHS 
2023. 5,832 reference persons (76.5% of all reference persons) initially agreed to 
participate in the follow-on health examination. However, only 4,498 (77.1%) of those who 
agreed eventually attended the health examination.     
 
Comparison of Demographic Profile between Survey Respondents and Resident 
Population 
The demographic profiles of survey respondents from household interview were shown 
in Table 13.1. The survey sample was weighted to the age, ethnic group and sex 
distribution of the 2022 Singapore resident population to yield a similar population 
structure as the resident population. This was to ensure that the survey results apply to 
the general population.  
 
Sample Weights 
The sample weights for household interview were the composite of sample weights for 
the households and the selected household members. For each household, the sample 
weight (WHH) comprised weight for non-response and unequal probability of selection 
stratified by planning regions and housing type and benchmarked to the total number of 
resident households. For each household member, the sample weight (WHH_Mem) 
comprised weight for unequal probability of selection and weight for post-stratification 
stratified by age, sex and ethnic groups. The overall sample weight for household 
interview was the product of WHH and WHH_Mem.

3. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 
 
 
Interviewer: The next questions are about the time you spend doing work. Think of work as the things 
that you have to do such as paid or unpaid work, household chores or looking for a job. Activities at 
work, focus on occupational physical activity. For homemakers, this refers to household chores. For 
unemployed, this refers to looking for a job. For students, this refers to classes (including Physical 
Education if relevant). 
接着我要询问您关于工作中的体力活动。工作是指您不得不做的事情，如有偿或无偿工作、家
务活以及找工作。工作中的活动，主要是指与职业相关的体力活动。对于家庭主妇来说，这指
的是家务劳动。对于无业人士来说，这指的是找工作。对于学生来说，这指的是上课（包括相
关的体育课）。 
 
In answering the next few questions, ‘vigorous-intensity activities’ are activities that require hard physical 
effort and cause large increases in breathing or heart rate, ‘moderate-intensity activities’ are activities 
that require moderate physical effort and cause small increases in breathing or heart rate. 
在以下的问题，“剧烈活动” 是指需要大量体力并引起呼吸心跳显著增加的活动，“中等强
度活动” 是指需引起呼吸心跳轻度增加的活动。
