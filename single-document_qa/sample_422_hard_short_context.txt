Abstract 
This review provides a thorough discussion of homogeneous 
catalysis by transition metal 
oxygen anion clusters (polyoxometalates), 
with a focus on mechanism. The primary catalysts 
examined are mixed addenda 
and d-electron-transition-metal-substituted 
polyoxometalate 
(TMSP) complexes. The unusual versatility and tunability of these catalysts and their compati- 
bility with environmentally 
and economically 
attractive conditions 
(solvents, oxidants, etc.) 
are outlined. A general compilation 
of the reactions, including catalytic electrooxidations 
or 
electroreductions, 
reported to date is given. Selected examples involving different classes of 
catalysts, different organic substrates and transformations, 
and mechanistic information 
are 
covered.

S. General considerations and literature 
Homogeneous 
catalysis 
by early-transition-metal-oxygen-anion 
clusters, 
hence- 
forth referred to as polyoxometalates 
or polyoxoanions 
for convenience, 
is a rapidly 
growing 
area, in part as a consequence 
of the unusual 
versatility 
of these catalysts 
and their compatibility 
with environmentally 
friendly 
conditions 
(e.g. O2 and H,O,) 
and operation. 
This initial 
overview 
section is followed 
by sections 
that focus on the 
general 
properties 
of polyoxometalates, 
the pertinent 
redox chemistry, 
and finally, 
the homogeneous 
catalysis 
itself. This review focuses on the detailed 
features, includ- 
ing the mechanisms, 
of the catalytic 
processes for two reasons. 
First, previous 
reviews 
have not covered 
this fundamental 
chemistry 
very adequately, 
and second, 
a deep 
understanding 
of just this fundamental 
chemistry 
will be requisite 
for more sophisti- 
cated applications 
and developments 
in this area, including 
catalysts 
for transforma- 
tion 
of a range 
of complex 
targets 
in biology, 
chemistry 
and 
materials 
science. 
Reasonable 
projected 
tasks entail recognition 
and transformation 
of complex 
multi- 
functional 
molecules 
and asymmetric 
catalytic 
reactions. 
The unique 
collective 
prop- 
erties of polyoxometalates 
make them of fundamental 
and practical 
interest. 
There 
are already 
more commercial 
applications 
of polyoxometalates 
than for any class of 
cluster compound 
and the promise 
for additional 
applications 
in areas from catalysis 
and medicine 
to materials 
and microdevice 
technology 
is substantial. 
There 
have 
been more than thirty reviews on some aspect of polyoxometalates 
since 1983 [l-31]. 
Most of these reviews, including 
ones by Day and Klemperer, 
[ 31 Chen and Zubieta, 
[ 21 Isobe, [ 121 and Pope [ 281, stress structural 
properties. 
One by Jeannin 
addresses 
nomenclature 
[ 141 and others 
by Papaconstantinou 
[25], 
Yamase 
[31] 
and Hill 
and McCartha 
[lo] 
address photochemistry 
and photocatalysis. 
While many photo- 
catalytic 
processes 
are very similar 
to those described 
in Section 
3 of this review, 
this work 
has not been formally 
included 
here as it has recently 
been 
reviewed 
elsewhere 
[ 10). It has been more than seven years since the last fairly comprehensive

and general reviews of polyoxometalates 
[26,27] and the enormous growth in the 
chemistry of these compounds makes such reviews increasingly difficult and impracti- 
cal. An excellent general review by Pope and Mtiller appeared 4 years ago but was 
prohibited 
by space limitations from delving into much detail [29]. A 41 l-page 
edited volume from the polyoxometalate 
meeting in Bielefeld held during the summer 
of 1992 compiles a series of 28 articles focusing on a range of subtopics. While some 
of the included articles provide fairly up-to-date reviews, others are simply research 
reports of the most recent findings in specific research areas [29]. 
In addition, there are several reviews on one or more aspects of catalysis by 
polyoxometalates. 
Effective processes involving both heterogeneous 
and homogen- 
eous catalysis by polyoxometalates 
are well documented and good reviews covering 
the commercialized 
processes have been written recently by Misono [ 20,211. The 
first review on catalysis, written by Matveev and Kozhevnikov, thoroughly discussed 
aspects of heteropolyacid 
catalysis with an emphasis on homogeneous oxidative and 
acid processes. Physicochemical properties of the complexes, mechanism, and applica- 
tions were addressed [17,18]. Kozhevnikov 
followed with two reviews in 1987 and 
1993 which concentrated on the advances in homogeneous and heterogeneous cataly- 
sis by heteropolyacids; 
and their application as acid and oxidation catalysts for the 
synthesis of fine chemicals, including antioxidants, medicines and vitamins [ 15,161. 
Hill discussed polyoxometalates 
as catalysts for selective catalytic homogeneous 
oxygenation 
[ 8,9]. Ono surveyed the use of heteropolyacids 
as oxidation and acid 
catalysts [24]. Mizuno and Misono reviewed recent progress in both homogeneous 
and heterogeneous 
catalysis by heteropolyanions 
[20,22,23] 
and Jansen et al. 
reviewed the same subject with an emphasis on the last 6 years of research [ 131. 
The subject matter in several of the latter reviews is repetitive. All these reviews are 
more descriptive than quantitative. 
There is little rigorous discussion about how 
these reactions actually take place. Indeed, hard mechanistic information on polyoxo- 
metalate-catalyzed 
reactions is limited to a handful of papers. This review tries to 
remedy this deficit and concentrates primarily on the most recent research (roughly 
the last 4 years of work). Discussion of studies prior to this can be found in the 
appropriate 
reviews cited above. 
Much work has been done in the area of H,02 oxidation catalyzed by heteropoly- 
acids and two reviews focused on this work. One review by Ishii and Ogawa focused 3 
on hydrogen peroxide oxidation catalyzed by heteropoly acids combined with cetyl- 
pyridium chloride [ 111. A wide selection of organic substrates and reactions were 
addressed, including epoxidation, oxidative dehydrogenation 
and oxidative cleavage 
processes, but very little information 
was offered about how the reactions actually 
take place. Another review by Hill addressed H,O,! facilitated by polyoxometalates 
[6]. While these two reviews are relatively recent, both are already quite out of date 
as research in this area, and in particular that involving polyperoxotungstophos- 
phates and their oxidation chemistry, has developed considerably in the last 3 years 
[32-401. 
Most of the recent general reviews of polyoxometalate 
catalysis include 
oxidations by H,O, and the precatalysts, PW,,Oi;, 
PMo,,Oj;, 
and other polyoxo- 
metalates, but inclusion of these reactions in such reviews is questionable given that 
lower nuclearity polyperoxometalates 
are the dominant and active species formed

in these systems [33-413. Recent data provide strong evidence that the polyoxometa- 
late catalyst precursors are not catalytically significant [33,35,36]. The polyperoxo- 
metalates are very different structurally and electronically from the polyoxometalate 
precursors. Primarily for these reasons and secondarily as these systems no longer 
appear to be of serious commercial value given the requirement 
of chlorocarbon 
solvents or selectivity issues [42,43-J, they will not be discussed further. Bregeault 
and co-workers [ 353 and Hill and co-workers [ 361 have investigated the mechanisms 
of epoxidation 
under Venturello’s conditions 
(H+, WO$-, PO:-, 
phase transfer 
catalyst, 
H,O/CHCl,, 
60°C) and under Ishii’s conditions 
(H3PW12040, phase 
transfer catalyst, H,O/CHCl,, 
60°C). Amusingly, these studies indicate that these 
catalytic systems are effectively identical despite the fact that each group patented 
their particular set of catalyst precursors as novel chemistry [44,45]. In closing this 
section, we note that a thorough review of dioxygen and peroxo complexes with a 
focus on structural features has just appeared [4]. 
Heterogeneous 
reactions catalyzed 
by polyoxometalates 
have been repeatedly 
reviewed and few major strides regarding the nature of these reactions have been 
made recently [ 13,19-241. As a consequence, yet another review of this material, at 
least with the conventional 
technical foci, would contribute little. Misono’s multiple 
reaction domains, “pseudoliquid phase” and other concepts in heterogeneous cataly- 
sis by polyoxometalates 
were nicely elaborated years ago [ 19,211. Acid catalysis by 
polyoxometalates 
is not a primary focus of this review as the nature and mechanism 
of these reactions is likely to be similar to the same reactions catalyzed by other 
strong Bronsted acids. One of the most promising applications of polyoxometalates 
in catalysis is as insoluble superacids and this research was reviewed recently by 
Misono [46]. As a majority of the catalytic reactions we will review are oxidations, 
we follow the next section on basic features of polyoxometalates 
with a section on 
basic features of metal catalyzed oxidations including mechanisms. 
1.2. Polyoxometalates 
This section has been kept to a minimum as this material has been covered not 
only in all the general reviews but also in abbreviated form in the catalysis reviews. 
Polyoxometalates 
are a large and rapidly growing class of compounds. They are 
constituted, as the name indicates, primarily by d” early transition metal cations and 
oxide anions. The principal d” transition metal ions that form the molecular structural 
framework or scaffolding of polyoxometalates 
are W( VI), Mo(VI), V(V), Nb(V), 
Ta(V) and Ti(IV). These ions or their local MO, coordination polyhedra are referred 
to as “addenda” or “addenda ions”. There are two generic families of polyoxometa- 
lates, the isopolyoxometalates 
or isopolyanions, which contain only transition metal 
cations and oxide anions, and the heteropolyoxometalates 
or heteropolyanions 
which 
contain one or more p or d block elements as “heteroatoms” located at structurally 
well defined sites, in addition to the more numerous transition metal and oxide ions. 
As the suffix of polyoxometalates 
indicates, these compounds 
are nearly always 
negatively charged although the negative charge density is widely variable depending 
on the elemental composition and the molecular structure.

1.2.1. Structure 
Polyoxometalates 
are composed 
primarily 
of MO, 
octahedra 
but in some cases 
by MO5 pentahedra 
and 
MO4 tetrahedra. 
The most 
commonly 
occurring 
MO, 
octahedra 
are those containing 
one terminal 
0x0 group and five bridging 
0x0 groups 
(Type I octahedra) 
and those containing 
two terminal 
0x0 groups 
and four bridging 
0x0 groups 
(Type II octahedra) 
[26]. 
The three-dimensional 
structures 
of polyoxo- 
metalates 
are defined primarily 
by corner 
sharing 
(one bridging 
p,-0x0 
group), edge 
sharing 
(two 
bridging 
~~-0~0 
groups), 
or occasionally 
by 
face 
sharing 
(three 
bridging 
p,-0x0 
groups) MO, octahedra. 
While there is a profound 
structural 
diver- 
sity in polyoxometalates, 
a diversity 
that has been markedly 
enhanced 
by an ava- 
lanche 
of new complexes 
characterized 
by X-ray crystallography 
in the last 5 years. 
a few structures 
still dominate 
polyoxometalate 
research 
in many 
areas. The most 
investigated 
of all structural 
types 
are the Keggin 
heteropolyanions 
of formula 
[Xn+M1204,,](8-n)), 
when 
M=W(VI) 
or Mo(V1). 
The heteroatom, 
X”+. can be 
one of over half the d block 
elements 
and many 
of the p block 
elements. 
These 
complexes 
are attractive 
as they are very stable, readily 
prepared 
and well charac- 
terized 
spectroscopically. 
They also exhibit 
a rich and well elaborated 
substitution 
chemistry 
in which one or more of the d” addenda 
W(VI) 
or Mo(V1) 
ions can be 
replaced 
with other d” early transition 
metal (addenda) 
ions, d-electron 
transition 
metal 
ions, or organometallic 
or organic 
groups.

four representative

complexes

in this review on homogeneous 
catalysis. 
In polyhedral 
notation, 
the 
MO, 
polyhedra 
are depicted; 
the nuclei 
of the oxygen 
atoms 
are the vertices 
and 
the metal ions are buried 
inside each polyhedron. 
The inter-MO, 
connections 
(e.g. 
corner 
sharing 
versus edge sharing) 
and longer 
range 
structural 
features 
are often 
more readily 
discerned 
in polyhedral 
notation 
than in bond notation. 
1.2.2. Reactivity 
Solubility, 
a requisite 
for homogeneous 
catalysis, 
is quite controllable 
for polyoxo- 
metalates 
as these complexes 
can be dissolved 
in media from water to hydrocarbons 
by judicious 
choice of the counter 
cation(s). 
The redox characteristics 
of the polyoxo- 
metalates 
which are important 
for certain 
types of homogeneous 
catalysis 
are also 
widely 
variable 
and 
to some 
extent 
controllable. 
One 
early 
criterion 
for redox 
chemistry 
attributable 
to Michael 
Pope 
was that polyoxometalates 
composed 
of 
Type I MO6 octahedra 
display 
reversible 
redox chemistry 
while polyoxometalates 
composed 
of Type II MO, octahedra 
do not, a criterion 
that follows from a simple 
MO picture 
of the two types of MO, 
units 
[26]. 
The redox potentials 
depend, 
in 
part, on negative 
charge 
density 
and elemental 
composition. 
The negative 
charge 
density 
depends 
principally 
on structural 
type, protonation 
state 
and 
elemental 
composition, 
all of which can be controlled 
to a reasonable 
extent synthetically. 
The 
dependence 
of polyoxometalate 
redox potentials 
on elemental 
composition 
is dictated 
primarily 
by the presence 
or absence 
of the most oxidizing 
skeletal 
or “addenda” 
d” 
early transition 
metal ions. The polyoxometalate 
addenda 
ions in order of decreasing 
redox 
potentials 
are V(V) 
(most 
oxidizing) 
> Mo( VI) > W( VI) (least 
oxidizing).

There are no known examples involving reduction of Nb(V), Ta(V), or Ti(IV) ions 
in dissolved polyoxometalates. 
One polyoxoanion 
counter cation, H+, has relevance for homogeneous catalysis 
and catalysis by polyoxometalates 
in general. The proton or the free acid forms of 
polyoxometalates 
are stable, tractable and highly soluble for several structural classes 
of polyoxometalates. 
In addition, the free acid forms become superacids when dehy- 
drated, and as such they can function as effective and recoverable catalysts for a 
variety of acid-dependent 
processes [46]. The simultaneous exhibition of the above

and other properties has rendered polyoxometalates 
attractive in homogenous cataly- 
sis and a range of areas. 
1.3. Homogeneous 
catalytic oxidation 
1.3.1. General considerations 
As a sizable majority of the research in homogeneous catalysis by polyoxometalates 
involves oxidation processes, it is necessary to outline the fundamental features of 
homogeneous catalytic oxidation. Research in this area has been quite intense in the 
last few years for several reasons: (1) catalytic oxidations are often the most challeng- 
ing to achieve satisfactorily (high yields and selectivities, etc.), (2) the existing catalytic 
processes often leave considerable room for improvement, 
(3) the mechanisms are 
often quite complex (e.g. multiple mechanisms can be simultaneously operable), and 
(4) these processes have extensive application in areas from the manufacture of fine

chemicals to the degradation 
of many kinds of toxic materials. Several reviews and 
symposia in this area have recently been published [7,47-56). 
The generic catalytic 
oxidation process is given in Eq. (1) and a general catalytic 0x0 transfer oxidation 
(or oxygenation) process, a major subset of Eq. (l), is given in Eq. (2).

(catalyst) 
where Sub = organic substrate, OX = oxidant, DO = oxygen donor. 
1.3.2. Oxidants 
A large number of oxidants, OX in Eq. 1, many of which can function as oxygen 
donors, DO in Eq. (2), have been extensively investigated in context with homogen- 
eous catalytic oxidation processes. The primary characteristics that define the attrac- 
tiveness of an oxidant are the % active oxygen (the higher the better) and the 
selectivity associated with its use, in addition to the pragmatic issues of cost and 
effect on the environment. 
Some of the major oxidants, particularly 
those with 
oxygen atom donor capabilities, along with salient assets and liabilities are summa- 
rized in Table 1. Table 1 is organized from the highest % active oxygen at the top 
of the table to the lowest % active oxygen. 
While the oxidants such as OCl-, Cl, and CIOZ lead in varying yields to chlori- 
nated organic compounds, including the highly toxic and carcinogenic dioxins and 
are, as a consequence, rapidly becoming environmentally 
unacceptable, many other 
oxidants that produce only minimally toxic inorganic waste as by-products, such as 
sulfate from persulfate, are also becoming environmentally 
and hence politically and 
economically 
unacceptable. 
Indeed, legislation in many countries concerning the 
waste products from industrial catalytic oxidation processes is moving so fast it has 
been difficult for companies developing new and more benign catalytic processes to 
keep up. Some better processes from the environmental 
prospective are obsolete 
before sufficient development is concluded to render them commercially viable. The 
most attractive oxidants with respect to the criteria articulated above are O2 and 
H,O,. 
Unfortunately, 
these two oxidants generally exhibit the most complex and 
minimally controllable oxidation chemistry of all the potentially attractive oxidants. 
1.3.3. General mechanisms 
Fig. 3 (Eqs. (3-11)) summarizes the general processes in homogeneous 
metal- 
catalyzed oxidation processes. Radical chain processes, including those associated 
with 0, (autoxidation) 
and H,Oa, that entail a minimal involvement of the metal 
are not included here. 0x0 transfer, Eq. (3) in Fig. 3, is clearly important 
if not 
dominant in the most difficult enzymatic oxidations and the oxidation reactivity of 
high-valent transition oxometal species is among the most variable and, in principal, 
electronically controllable. While a multitude of biomimetic systems using a range 
of oxygen donors (see Table 1) facilitate the oxygenation cycle of Eqs. (3) and (4)

(in Fig. 3), there are few commercially significant processes based on this mechanism 
thus far. The less reactive and alterable, but to date more selective and tractable 0x0 
transfer reactions, involving heterolytic (non-radical) mechanisms and peroxometal 
intermediates (not shown in Fig. 3), are more commercially significant. 
Reversible dioxygenation, 
Eq. (5) in Fig. 3, followed by reduction and peroxide 
cleavage to form high-valent oxoiron species (Eqs. (5) and (6) where M = Fe) are 
important in biological systems including the heme enzyme, cytochrome P-450 [ 571, 
and probably in the nonheme enzyme methane monooxygenase 
(MMO) [58-631. 
Generation 
of the high-valent oxometal species via reaction of the dioxygenated 
metal complex, MOz, with another equivalent of reduced metal complex, M, Eq. (7) 
in Fig. 3, is highly attractive as no external reducing agent is required. Only 0, and

substrate are needed for the net catalytic cycle (Eqs. (3), (5) and (7), in Fig. 3). No 
commercially viable homogeneous 
catalytic oxidation based on this mechanism is 
available. Indeed, only two or three examples of this are known, with the best 
example being aerobic epoxidation catalyzed by tetramesitylporphyrinatoruthenium 
(II), Ru( 1I)TMP [ 641. Unfortunately, 
the barriers to overcome before such a process 
were to be viable are collectively formidable. Homogeneous 
metal-based systems 
must be identified for which Eqs. (3), (5) and (7) all proceed in high yield and at 
satisfactory rates. 
A final general mechanism for homogeneous metal-based oxidation is direct oxida- 
tion of substrate by the metal complex, Eq. (8) in Fig. 3, followed by regeneration 
of the reduced metal complex (M=O& 
Eq. (9) in Fig. 3, by the oxidant, OX. This 
process, Eqs. (8) and (9), is as inherently attractive as it is rare. One feature of 
considerable significance is that Eqs. (8) and (9) can be separated in either time or 
space. Such a separation facilitates the use of the most attractive oxidants such as 
O2 and H,O, without involvement of radical chain and other minimally selective 
and controllable 
oxidative processes often associated with their use. In closing the 
mechanistic overview of homogeneous metal-mediated 
oxidation processes, two side 
reactions, one nonproductive 
and one deleterious, should be mentioned. The nonpro- 
ductive process involves ~-0x0 dimer formation or dehydration 
condensations 
that

are extensions thereof (Eq. (10) in Fig. 3). This process is often reversible, but not 
always so, under conditions where the catalytic oxidation proceeds satisfactorily (fast 
and selectively). The other process, oxidative degradation 
of the organic ligands or 
other necessary organic components, 
Eq. (11) in Fig. 3, is irreversible and is often 
the success-limiting factor with respect to development of viable homogeneous cata- 
lytic oxidation systems, particularly those that function on significant scales. Major 
efforts have been made by many research groups in recent years to combat this 
Achilles’ heel of homogeneous oxidation catalysts, including construction 
of elegant 
but expensive 
polyhalogenated 
porphyrin 
and other 
organic 
ligand 
systems 
[ 48,51,56,65-791. 
2. d-Electron-transition-metal-substituted polyoxometalate (TMSP) complexes 
2.1. Homogeneous catalytic reactions 
One or more addenda ions in some structural families of polyoxometalates 
can 
be substituted with d-electron transition metal ions. Syntheses of these d-electron- 
transition-metal-substituted 
polyoxometalates 
(TMSP) complexes date back to 1956 
(substitution in Keggin heteropolyanions) 
[SO]. Baker speculated in 1970 that “...the 
role of these complexes in catalysis should be important” [Sl]. Fourteen years later 
in breakthrough 
work, Katsoulis and Pope demonstrated 
that Keggin-type TMSP 
complexes, particularly 
[( Mn”H20)SiW11039]6-, 
when extracted 
into nonpolar 
aprotic organic solvents, such as toluene, could reversibly bind O2 [ 821. These 
authors also speculated about catalysis, quoting: “Besides the obvious implications 
for catalysis and molecular activation, we foresee the development 
of novel high- 
temperature 
chemistry, new methods of synthesis and new polyanions and deriva- 
tives” [82]. The first actual catalysis (elaboration of specific concept and realization 
of successful results) came 2 years later (1986) in a communication 
by Hill and 
Brown [83]. The specific concept was oxygen transfer from a typical donor to a 
suitable TMSP followed by transfer of this TMSP-activated 
form of oxygen to an 
organic substrate (i.e. Eqs. (3) and (4) in Fig. 3). This work followed in a direct way 
from the thorough earlier investigations of analogous metalloporphyrin 
systems by 
the Hill group (catalytic profiles, characterization 
of intermediates, product distribu- 
tions, kinetics and other studies in many papers) [75,84-921. The realization was 
the sustained and selective oxygenation 
of alkenes by iodosylarenes 
catalyzed by 
M”PW,,O&, 
M=Co(II) 
or Mn(I1) (Eq. (12); numbers are % selectivities) [83]. 
Since this time, other TMSP complexes have been prepared, characterized and their 
catalytic chemistries evaluated with varying degrees of sophistication and thorough- 
ness (Table 2). Again, the reactions given in Table 2 and discussed below are reactions 
reported primarily in the last 4 years. Table 2 excludes most articles discussed in 
reviews written prior to 1993.

As a generic class of compounds, TMSP complexes exhibit many of the attractive 
features of metalloporphyrins 
[ 51. These include: ( 1) multidentate 
ligand systems 
that bind the d-electron 
transition 
metal ions in multiple oxidation 
states with 
sufficient strength that they are not lost. This can be critical, as oxygenation processes 
(Eq. (3) and (4) or Eqs. (3) and others in Fig. 3) and some other processes dictate 
oxidation state changes in the metal. As oxidation state changes usually result in 
significant changes in lability and other electronically 
controlled 
properties, it is 
often difficult for ligand systems to adequately retain the metal throughout a catalytic 
cycle. If the metal is lost (deligated), it usually precipitates rapidly as the transition 
metal oxide. While transition 
metal oxides can be quite active as heterogeneous 
oxidation catalysts at the temperatures 
typically used in such oxidation processes 
(often over 2OO”Q they are effectively inactive for low temperature 
homogeneous 
catalytic oxidations. (2) Both metalloporphyrin 
and TMSP ligand systems can bind 
or activate substrates proximal to the active site, and both ligand systems can be 
reduced, which facilitates the activation 
of some oxidants and the quenching of 
various intermediates 
seen in oxidation 
processes. (3) The electronic 
structures 
(tendency to donate or accept electrons and relative energies of frontier orbitals) of 
both types of ligand systems can be altered by rational synthesis, and (4) both types 
of complexes can be rendered soluble in both polar and nonpolar media. TMSP 
complexes, unlike metalloporphyrins, 
however, are not susceptible to oxidative degra- 
dation (the rate of Eq. (11) in Fig. 3 is 0), and as a consequence, they continue to 
catalyze oxygenation 
and other oxidations for longer than metalloporphyrins 
or 
other conventional 
inorganic complexes with organic ligands. Last but not least, 
many TMSP complexes (unlike halogenated metalloporphyrins) 
are readily accessible 
and available in significant quantity in two-to-three-step 
high yield syntheses. 
2.1 
.I. Monosubstituted 
catalysts 
As shown in Table 2, a considerable number of reactions, and particularly those 
of monosubstituted 
TMSP catalysts with the Keggin structure, have been studied. 
The monosubstituted 
TMSP catalysts of formula M”+XM’llO:<“, 
where X = P or 
Si; M = Co, Mn, Cu, Fe, Cr, Ni, or Ru; and M’ = MO or W, are the most thoroughly 
studied. Several oxidants and a wide range of substrates have been examined, leading 
to a range of oxygenated products. Since the solubility of the polyoxometalate 
can 
easily be adjusted with use of different counter cations, many solvents and combina- 
tions of solvents have been studied. We now describe some of these reactions. Again, 
it is unfortunate that most of these studies are descriptive and unsophisticated. 
Many 
contain insufficient information to establish either the actual catalyst(s) or the nature 
(mechanism) of the reactions themselves.

Not surprisingly, alkane oxidation reactions catalyzed by monosubstituted 
Keggin 
or Dawson polyoxometalates 
produce alcohol and ketone products under a wide 
variety of conditions. The oxidation of alkanes by O2 facilitated by several TMSP 
complexes of the Keggin structure has been reported by Lyons and Ellis [70,93]. 
The addition of azide to an aqueous solution of K,CrPW,,O,,, 
producing presuma- 
bly the 1:l adduct, K,CrPW,,039N3, 
led to a -54-fold 
increase in rate from 14 to 
762 turnover h- ‘. Equal amounts of alcohol and ketone products were produced in 
both cases. More spectroscopic information would have been helpful in these studies 
(characterization 
of these catalysts was limited to elemental analysis, in some cases, 
and IR). Bressan and coworkers reported the homogeneous catalytic oxygenation of 
several alkanes in a two-phase system with the alkane in dichloromethane 
and the 
catalyst (K,Ru(H,O)PW~~O,~) 
and oxidant (NaClO 
or TBHP) in water [94]. 
Methylene groups were found to be oxygenated to secondary alcohols and then to 
the dominant ketone products. There has been controversy (vide infra) regarding the 
actual formulation 
of Ru-substituted 
polyoxometalates. 
TMSP complexes have been documented 
to catalyze the oxidation of alkenes, 
under varying conditions, to give epoxides, allylic alcohols, allylic ketones, oxidative 
cleavage products, carboxylic acids, and aldehydes. Mizuno and coworkers studied 
the effect of several Keggin TMSP catalysts (MPWriO&), 
several aldehydes, and 
different solvents on the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexene to epoxide (major product), 
and allylic alcohol and ketone (minor products) [ 1021. The order of TMSP activities 
was found 
to be Co (most active)>>Mn> Fe > Cu >Ni 
(least active). Further 
study of the effect of aldehyde and solvent was conducted 
with the most active 
catalyst, CoPWi,O& 
[ 1021. It was found that addition 
of aldehyde increases 
the catalytic 
activity 
of the system with the following order 
of effectiveness: 
pivalaldehyde > isobutyraldehyde 
>> 
butyraldehyde % 
acetaldehyde > valeraldehyde > 
benzaldehyde 
[102]. The catalytic activity of CoPW1rO& 
was solvent dependent: 
chloroform 
(fastest 
rates) z dichloromethane 
> 1,Zdichloroethane 
> acetonitrile > 
N,N-dimethylformamide 
> dimethyl sulfoxide (slowest rates). It is likely that these 
reactions simply involve autoxidation 
of the aldehydes to the peracids which then 
epoxidize the alkenes either directly or with TMSP catalysis. While the authors 
mention that perisobutyric acid might be an intermediate in the oxidations, they did 
not do the control experiments involving alkene and peracid with and without the 
CoPW,,O&. 
If the main role of the TMSP is as a redox initiator of aldehyde 
autoxidation 
it would be more appropriate 
to view the complex as an initiator than 
as a catalyst. 
Neumann 
and Levin studied the effect of several reducing agents (Na,S,O,, 
ascorbate, NaBH,, or HJPt) 
on the product selectivity when molecular oxygen is 
used as the oxidant and a TMSP, MSiWilO& 
(M =Mn3+, Cu’+, Co’+, Fe3’), is 
used as catalyst with an alkene substrate [ 1043. In general, allylic products were 
observed in the presence of sodium dithionate, epoxidation products in the presence 
of hydrogen/Pt, 
saturated alcohols in the presence of sodium borohydride, 
and no 
products in the presence of ascorbate. Neumann and coworkers also examined the 
alkene oxidation by RuSiW,,O& 
with several oxidants [108,109]. In the case of 


CL. Hill, CM. Prosser-McCarthajCoordination 
Chemistry Reviews 143 (1995) 407-455 
425 
styrene, sodium periodate oxidant produced exclusively the aldehyde oxidative cleav- 
age product, while potassium persulfate produced 
primarily the carboxylic 
acid. 
Iodosylbenzene 
and TBHP produced cleavage, epoxidation, and oxidation products. 
The mechanism of oxidative cleavage by periodate catalyzed by RuSiW,,Oz; 
was 
studied to a greater degree than nearly all other reports on TMSP catalysis (see 
Section 2.2). A concern in this, however, was the nature of the catalyst itself as two 
other groups subsequently provided evidence that the catalyst used by Neumann 
and Levin was more than likely a mixture of compounds. RuTMSP complexes, in 
part as a function of minimal lability of both Ru(II1) and Ru(II), are far more 
difficult to prepare and purify than most, if not all, of the analogous first-row TMSP 
complexes. First, Rong and Pope provided the first (1992) definitive purification 
and 
characterization 
of a Ru polyoxometalate 
when 
they 
synthesized 
the 
Ru”““PW 11 
Oi;“- 
complexes, characterized 
several of their physical and spectro- 
scopic properties, and reported a little catalysis (products from oxidation of frans- 
stilbene by iodosylbenzene). In this paper, they stated that the cyclic voltammogram 
of a sample of the Neumann and Levin “RuSiWiiO~;” 
catalyst indicated that a 
mixture of species was present [ 1 
lo]. Subsequently (1993), Randall, Weakley and 
Finke also charged that the Neumann-Levin 
“RuSiW,,O&” 
was a mixture [ 1271. 
These workers reported the definitive characterization 
including an X-ray structure 
of an oxo-bridged diruthenium “bimetallic-porphyrin 
analog”, KLi,, [O{ Ru’“Cl(x,- 
P,W,,O,,)},] 
but no catalysis [ 1271. 
Mansuy, Finke, and coworkers examined the oxidations of alkenes and alkanes 
catalyzed by Wells-Dawson 
TMSP catalysts and compared the reactions to those 
catalyzed by analogous metalloporphyrins 
[ 1001. These TMSP complexes were as 
well characterized 
as any in the literature. In the case of (+)-limonene, 
the total 
epoxide yield was greater for the TMSP than the metalloporphyrin 
catalysts. As 
shown in Eq. (13) oxidation of (+)-limonene with the Mn(II1) Wells-Dawson TMSP 
gave a 53% yield of 1,2-epoxide and a 22% yield of 8,9-epoxide. 
(13) 
Other oxidations 
catalyzed by TMSP complexes include H,S to S(0) by O2 
[ 114,115], and triphenylphosphine 
to triphenylphosphine 
oxide by CrV(O)SiW,,O& 
[ 1011. The oxidation 
of alcohol 
and phenol 
substrates 
catalyzed 
by TMSP 
complexes, 
including 
the aerobic 
oxidation 
of hindered 
phenols facilitated 
by 
MnSiW,,O&, 
has been examined by Katsoulis and Pope (Eq. (14)) [112]. The type

2.1.2. Trisubstituted 
and tetrasubstituted 
catalysts 
Trisubstituted 
and tetrasubstituted 
TMSP catalysts have not been studied as 
extensively as the monosubstituted 
TMSP catalysts, as is evident from Table 2. One 
key reason for this is undoubtedly 
that the trisubstituted 
TMSP complexes are 
harder to synthesize in pure, unequivocally 
characterized 
form. One of the most 
heavily evaluated classes of trisubstituted TMSP complexes with respect to catalysis 
has been the complexes of the general formula M3PW9037, where M, = Fe,M’ and 
M’ = Ni, Fe, Mn, Co, or Zn first reported by Ellis and coworkers [ 70,118]. The free 
heteropolyacids 
were made by pyrolyzing the tetra-n-butylammonium 
salts (temper- 
ature not given). As many Keggin structures do not withstand temperatures necessary 
for such reaction, it would have been of interest and pertinence 
to have some 
information 
regarding changes in the catalyst after pyrolysis. The complexes were 
characterized primarily by elemental analysis [70]. Further work might permit one 
to distinguish 
Fe,MPW90,, 
from 
other 
possible 
formulations 
including 
2/3 
Fe,PW,03, 
+ l/3 MJPWgO,,. 
As expected, oxidation by O2 of alkane substrates 
produced 
alcohols and ketones; alkenes produced 
allylic alcohols, allylic ketones 
and epoxides; and aldehyde produced carboxylic acid. Mizuno and coworkers exam- 
ined the oxidation of octanal by 0, as shown in Eq. (15) [ 1191. The catalyst was 
quite thoroughly 
characterized; 
the reactions themselves were less so. Lyons and 
coworkers studied the oxidation activity of a series of trisubstituted Keggin catalysts, 
H7Fe2MPW9037, where M =Ni, Fe, Zn, Mn, or Co, with propane as substrate [70]. 
It is not at all unlikely that in both of the interesting studies of Lyons et al. [70] 
and Mizuno et al. [ 1191 TMSP complexes may be functioning more as radical chain 
initiators than as true catalysts. The complexes probably function to catalytically 
break down intermediate peroxides (or peracids in the work of Mizuno and cowork- 
ers), and may be participating in or facilitating several processes simultaneously.

Another class of TMSP catalysts examined at length are sandwich-type compounds 
with a central unit of four edge-shared TMO, octahedra where TM is a first row 
transition ion, sandwiched between two B-XW,Oz; 
units, complexes first reported 
by Weakly and Tournt [ 1281 (Fig. 2(C)) and sandwiched between two P2Wr50:i- 
units, complexes first reported by Finke and Droege [ 1291 (Fig. 2(D)). Hill and 
coworkers first reported 
the oxidation 
of alkenes by H,O, 
with tetrasubstituted 
TMSP catalysts. Epoxidation 
and allylic oxidation products were observed in all 
cases. In the case of 6Q16[(Ni’1)4(P2W15056)2] as the catalyst, oxidation of cyclohex- 
ene resulted in chlorinated products doubtless derived from attack of intermediate 
radicals on the solvent (a CH,Cl,/H,O 
solvent system was used). These products 
were eliminated if the solvent was changed to benzene [7]. Little mechanistic work 
was reported. Khenkin and Hill reported the synthesis of and the effective H,Oz- 
based epoxidation catalyzed by the Fe, complexes, [Fe,( H20)2( PW9034)2]10- and 
[Fe4(H20)2( P2W,,0,6),]‘6- 
[ 1061. These Fe4 complexes produced epoxides in high 
selectivity while other Fe-containing TMSP complexes did not, consistent with quite 
distinct dominant 
mechanisms with the different FeTMSP catalysts. H,O,-based 
epoxidation 
of cyclohexene catalyzed by Fe”PW, ,O:p, 
[( Fe”‘),(SiW,O,,)]‘~ 
and 
[Fe,( PW,O,,),]i”~ 
proceeded in 7,49, and 90% selectivity, respectively (all reactions 
were homogeneous 
in CH,CN/H,O 
solution 
under N, at 25 “C) [105]. 
Later 
Neumann and Gara examined similar H,O,-based 
epoxidations 
catalyzed by the 
isostructural 
but more highly charged sandwich complexes comprising a central, 
WM’M, unit (two M ions opposite each other and on the outside of the complex) 
sandwiched between two B-XW,O& 
units, X =Zn(II) 
or Co(H), complexes first 
prepared by Tourne and coworkers [ 1301. The complex [ WZnMn”z(ZnWgO,,),] 
l2 
was the best of these catalysts 
and superior 
to the Fe, sandwich complexes 
of Khenkin 
and Hill [ 1203. A variety of alkene substrates 
were investigated. 
In the case of cyclohexene, 
epoxidation 
was the primary 
mode of oxidation 
at 2 “C, but allylic oxidation 
was the primary 
mode 
of oxidation

2.1.3. Electrocatalysis reactions 
Several papers have been published addressing the electrochemical 
properties of 
TMSP catalysts. Toth and Anson have reported the electrochemical 
behavior of 
FeXW1,O& 
where X=Si, Ge, P, or As, determined 
that changes in the central 
heteroatom 
result in changes in the formal Fern/Fe’* potential, and evaluated the 
effect of pH and ionic strength [ 1311. Later, Toth and Anson evaluated the electro- 
chemical reduction of nitric oxide and nitrite to ammonia with (Fe”‘H,O)XW,,O”,;, 
where X = Si or Ge (n = 5), P or As (n = 4), and found the catalysts to have long- 
term durability [ 1241. Subsequently, they reported the electrochemistry 
and redox 
chemistry of (Fe”‘H20)SiW,,0~~ 
in the presence of OH and H,Oz [126]. Dong 
and 
Liu 
studied 
the 
electrocatalytic 
reduction 
of 
NO; 
and 
HzOz 
by 
(Fe”‘H,O)P,W,,O~; 
[ 1251. Rong and Pope reported the electrocatalytic 
oxidation 
of sulfoxide to sulfone by RuV(0)PWI1O& 
with greater than 90% current efficiency 
[ 1 
lo]. Most recently, Rong and Anson found that benzyl or ethyl alcohol was slowly 
oxidized to the aldehyde by (CrO)PW,,O$; 
or (CrO)P,W1,Oz; 
generated electro- 
chemically [ 1231. Finally, Steckhan and Kandzia reported the electrochemical cleav- 
age of styrene derivatives to benzaldehydes catalyzed by RuSiWrrO& in a multiphase 
system (Eq. (17)) [ 1221. The problematic issue of purification and characterization 
of such Ru polyoxoanions 
is, again, noted [ 110,127].

2.2. Mechanistic overview of reactions 
To date there have been several reports that address the mechanism of TMSP 
catalyst reactions at the level of organic product distributions and limited structure 
reactivity relationships and very few reports that address the mechanism at the more 
involved level of insightful kinetics and detailed evaluation of elementary processes. 
A majority of the papers, in general, don’t go significantly beyond the trivial identifi- 
cation of organic oxidation products after a set reaction time or after consumption 
of a set amount of oxidant. From the limited mechanistic data that are available to 
date, however, four points are apparent. First, the mechanism for the TMSP catalyzed 
oxidation of hydrocarbon 
substrates alone appears to vary considerably with both 
the metal and the oxygen donor just as it does in the analogous oxidations catalyzed 
by metalloporphyrin, 
Schiff-base complexes, and other more conventional transition 
metal complexes. The word “appears” was carefully chosen as there are insufficient 
data at present to say anything definitive about trends in mechanism. 
Second, in no case have the O,-based oxidations been studied adequately. Next 
to nothing is known in detail about the nature of the reactions. Given the vast 
literature on homogeneous 
metal catalyzed O,-based oxidation (autoxidations 
and 


C.L. Hill, C. M. Presser-McCarthalCoordination 
Chemistry Reviews 143 (1995) 407-455 
429 
others) and the chemistry in these reports on TMSP facilitated 0, oxidations, it is 
likely that the latter reactions involve both conventional 
radical chain components 
(not shown in Fig. 3) and, in some cases, oxygenation 
components 
(Eq. (3) and 
reoxidation 
processes in Fig. 3). A principal role of the TMSP complexes in the 
radical chain component 
of these O,-based oxidations is doubtless as an initiator 
and/or a catalyst for breakdown of peroxide intermediates. As a redox initiator only, 
which appears to be their function in some cases, they are not technically catalysts 
and hence our deliberate use above of the verb “facilitate” rather than “catalyze”. 
The TMSP complexes may also modulate various reactions of radical intermediates. 
Further delineation of these reactions must await the results of quantitative investiga- 
tions. A caution should be articulated here that an attempt to use radical scavengers 
to quantify or even qualitatively 
eliminate the radical-chain 
component 
in these 
TMSP facilitated O2 oxidations could be problematical. 
Scavengers, as they often 
do in reactions involving short radical chains, may have no effect in these reactions. 
Alternatively, 
scavengers are likely to bind to the TMSP or otherwise alter the 
chemistry. 
Third, the first step in TMSP catalyzed oxidation of organic substrate by any 
oxygen donor is the association or binding of the oxygen donor and/or the substrate 
to the TMSP itself. Despite the fact that binding numbers (stoichiometric 
ratios of 
donor or substrate to TMSP) and the binding constants can be assessed by straight- 
forward spectroscopic 
(thermodynamic) 
and kinetics studies, only one such study 
has been conducted under conditions similar to those used in the catalytic oxidation 
reactions themselves. Finke and co-workers reported the equilibrium constants for 
association of four different bases, N-methylimidazole, 
pyridine, triphenylphosphine, 
and Br-, to aa-P,W,,O,,(Mn 
3+ sB~)~- [ 1321. Some quantitative association chemis- 
try involving Keggin-type TMSPs has been reported by Weakley [ 1331 (binding of 
SCN-, (NH&S, 
and various pyridines to Co”W,,O&, 
X= B, P, and As in water) 
but none with ligands pertinent 
to catalytic oxidation. 
A difficulty in assessing 
equilibrium association constants and binding numbers appears as a consequence 
of the assessment of results from the similarity in the chromophores 
of ligand bound 
and ligand free forms of the TMSP. This may preclude ready measurement. 
Fourth, only two studies in the literature 
address, to a significant extent, the 
mechanism of TMSP catalyzed organic substrate oxidations 
at the level of rate 
constants and quantitative 
elementary processes. The first, by Neumann and Abu- 
Gnim, 
investigates 
oxidative 
cleavage 
of 
alkenes 
by 
10; 
catalyzed 
by 
RuSiW,,O;; 
[ 1081. While there is ambiguity as to exactly what was being measured 
in some kinetics plots and uncertainty about the precise formulation of the catalyst 
(vide supra) [ 110,127], the mechanistic inferences in this work follow from the data. 
Product 
generation 
involves rate limiting reaction of a complex between alkene 
substrate, a water molecule and an oxidized form of the Ru TMSP. This strong 
paper contributes significantly to our understanding of catalysis by TMSP complexes. 
In the other study, Khenkin 
and Hill demonstrated 
that S= l/2 d’ 0x0 Cr(V) 
complexes, (OCrV)X”+ W1lO$~-“‘-, X”+ = Pv and Si”, first reported by Katsoulis 
and Pope [ 1341, catalyze the oxidation 
of organic substrates (alkenes, alkanes, 
alcohols, and one phosphine, 
Ph,P) by a variety of oxidants (OCll, 
H,Oz. or

iodosylbenzene). More significantly, however, they were able to study one exemplary 
reaction in greater mechanistic detail than any other TMSP catalyzed reaction. The 
in-depth mechanistic analysis was facilitated by the ability to directly monitor the 
actual form of the TMSP complex, the 0x0 Cr(V) specie itself, involved in attack 
on substrate. The rate law and seven other lines of evidence were consistent with 
0x0 transfer from the complex to the substrate proceeding by a rate limiting radical 
addition of the 0x0 unit to the alkene, Eq. (18) [ 1011. Electron transfer, concerted 
0x0 transfer, carbocation 
and several other mechanisms were ruled out.

A great deal of work, particularly on the dynamic and mechanistic front, is needed 
on TMSP catalyzed reactions if their potential utility in conventional 
areas (e.g. 
commodity 
products 
from selective oxidation) 
and other areas (e.g. asymmetric 
transformations 
and modification 
of high technology materials, etc.) is to be fully 
defined. 
3. Mixed addenda polyoxometalates 
3.1. Homogeneous catalytic reactions 
Mixed addenda polyoxometalates 
are typically formed from the substitution of one 
or more tungsten( VI) or molybdenum( VI) ions in Keggin, Wells-Dawson, and other 
prominent structural families of heteropolyanions 
(vide supra: Figs. 1 and 2). Many 
mixed addenda polyoxometalates 
such as the heavily investigated 
PMo,,V,O:; 
are mixtures of positional isomers. In the case of disubstituted 
Keggin complexes, 
such as PMo,,,V,Oi;, 
there are 66 possible ways of arranging the constituent ions, 
which after allowance for degeneracy leads to five distinct isomers [ 135 
J. In general 
for x substituted metal ions, M’, in a Keggin structure YM’,M,,_,O$,~“‘-, 
Y = the 
heteroatom, 
there are 12!/x!( 12 -x)! 
possible ways to arrange the constituent ions 
[135]. The lability of these different positional isomers depends on the particular 
complex (for example, the di- or polysubstituted 
polymolybdates 
are more labile 
than the structurally analogous di- or polysubstituted 
polytungstates) but equilibra- 
tion is usually achieved quickly under the conditions used in homogeneous catalysis. 
Quantitative studies documenting the speciation thermodynamics 
of mixed addenda 
polyanions, 
and particularly 
recent studies by Pettersson 
and co-workers 
on 
V-containing Keggin systems have provided data of direct value for optimization of 
catalysis [ 136-1381. Grate and co-workers at Catalytica have used just such seminal 
information 
to optimize 
promising 
PV,Mo,,_,O$,-x)-/Pd 
systems (vide infra) 
[ 137,139-1411. 
Mixed addenda polyoxometalates 
already occupy roles of central importance in 


C.L. Hill, C.M. Prosser-McCarthalCoordination 
Chemistry Reviews 143 ( 1995) 407 -455 
431 
both homogeneous 
and heterogeneous 
catalysis and in both oxidation and acid- 
catalyzed reactions. The largest number of papers in the homogeneous catalytic area 
involve oxidation. Many of the desirable attributes of mixed addenda polyoxometa- 
lates were addressed in the general sections above. These include ease in preparation, 
low cost, robustness (both thermal and oxidative), and solubility, depending on 
counterion, in media from water to hydrocarbons. 
The mixed addenda polyoxometa- 
lates used most commonly 
in homogeneous 
oxidation 
processes are those that 
contain vanadium for the simple reason that vanadium is the most strongly oxidizing 
addenda element. 
Another attractive feature of homogenous catalytic oxidation by mixed addenda 
polyoxometalates 
is that they can function by the general two-step oxidation (Eqs. 
(8) and (9) in Fig. 3), as well as by other mechanisms. For those reactions proceeding 
by the Eqs. (8) and (9), the ground state redox potentials of the complexes are 
crucially important. These potentials can be controlled by several features enumer- 
ated in Section 1.2.2. The higher the molecular 
charge, the more negative the 
potential, and the less facile is oxidation of substrate, Eq. (8) and the more facile is 
reoxidation 
of the reduced polyoxometalate 
(M =Ored), Eq. (9). While numerous 
reports have presented and analyzed useful data on redox potentials of polyoxometa- 
lates, a more sophisticated and comprehensive 
study that would take into account 
activity coefficients and ion pairing is lacking (see Section 6). Such a study would 
perforce be fairly substantial in size and would greatly augment the predictability of 
redox processes involving mixed addenda polyoxometalates. 
Table 3 summarizes the 
key papers since 1988 involving homogeneous catalysts by mixed addenda polyoxo- 
anions. For elaboration 
of reactions in this class reported prior to this date, one is 
again referred to the reviews cited earlier. 
3.1 
.I. Oxidation reactions 
As shown in Table 3, the majority of the mixed addenda polyoxometalates 
studied 
are polymolybdovanadates 
and polytungstovanadates; 
however, a few examples of 
tungstoniobates 
and tungstomolybdates 
are given. Included in Table 3 are also the 
parent (non-mixed-addenda) 
polyoxometalate 
catalysts to compare with their mixed 
addenda counterparts. 
In general, for the oxidation of alkanes by O,, the reactions 
containing polytungstovanadate 
or polymolybdovanadate 
mixed addenda catalysts 
exhibited higher rates of reaction than the parent polytungstate 
or polymolybdate 
catalysts [ 931. Neumann and Levin examined the mechanism of the aerobic oxidative 
dehydrogenation 
of c+terpinene to p-cymene catalyzed by the mixed addenda polyox- 
ometalate, 
H,PMo,,V20,, 
(Eq. ( 19)) [ 1431. Kinetic and spectroscopic 
(UV-vis, 
ESR, 31P NMR, and IR) studies led to the conclusion that oxidative dehydrogena- 
tions take place by formation of an intermediate catalyst-substrate 
electron-transfer 
complex. After completion 
of the step involving substrate oxidation and catalyst 
reduction (analogous to Eq. (8) in Fig. 3), the catalyst is reoxidized via a proposed p- 
peroxo intermediate 
whereby the primary oxidant, molecular oxygen, undergoes a 
four-electron 
reduction to water [ 1431.

Ishii and coworkers have reported, but not mechanistically investigated, a number 
of provocative and synthetically interesting reactions involving oxidation of alkenes 
to epoxides, aldehydes to carboxylic acids, thianthrene 5-oxide to thianthrene diox- 
ides, and cyclic ketones to esters with 0, in the presence of an aldehyde and mixed 
addenda polyoxometalates 
[ 1441. Typical heteropoly acids with the Keggin structure 
proved to be inert under the reaction conditions. In the case of alkenes, reactions 
run in the absence of aldehyde yielded no products. An example of lactone formation 
is shown in Eq. (20) [144]. These reactions may or may not simply involve polyoxo- 
metalate initiated autoxidation. 
The mechanisms of these reactions are admittedly 
not a major interest to these authors [43].

A range of heteropolyoxoanions 
catalyze the oxidation of thioether analogs of 
mustard (HD) to the corresponding 
sulfoxides by t-butylhydroperoxide 
(TBHP) 
rapidly at 25 “C, with selectivities as high as any seen in the literature for thioether 
oxidations. The strongly acidic complexes H3PWl2O40 and H3PMo1204, function 
primarily as acid catalysts for thioether oxidation by TBHP, producing sulfoxide 
with 98-99% selectivities (l-3% 
sulfone present) at modest conversions. Gall and 
Hill just reported the oxidation of THT and other thioethers by TBHP catalyzed 
by vanadium-substituted 
heteropoly acids, including hydrated H5PMo10V2040, that 
proceeds in >99.9% 
selectivity [ 1651. No sulfone (THTOJ

Chemistry Reviews 143 (1995) 407-455 
441 
limits of several methods (1 part in 105). These oxidations 
proceed by a novel 
mechanism for metal catalyzed peroxide oxidations that accounts for this very high 
selectivity, namely Eq. (8) (Fig. 3) followed by Eq. (9) (Fig. 3). The direct oxidation 
of THT by H,PMo,,V,O,, 
has been investigated as closely as any reaction in the 
literature catalyzed by mixed addenda polyoxometalates. 
While readers are referred 
to the original paper for all the details, this reaction is inhibited by water and exhibits 
the rate law -d[R,S]/dt= 
~[THT][H,PMo,,,V~O~,J[H~O]-~. 
In the absence 
of water, 
the rate 
becomes 
independent 
of THT 
substrate 
(-d[R,S]/dt 
= 
~[H~PMo~~V~O~,,]) and dehydration 
of the polyoxometalate 
may be rate limiting. 
The complete rate law is given in Eq. (26) and all the data, including the activation 
parameters (AHI = 8.06 & 0.64 kcal mol-’ and ASI = - 29.7 + 0.18 eu.), are most con- 
sistent with rate limiting electron transfer between thioether and H,PMo,~V~O,,

3.1.2. Acid catalyzed reactions 
While many acid forms of polyoxometalates 
(protons as gegenions) exist, most 
belong to the common Keggin and Wells-Dawson 
structural classes and hence the 
very common term “heteropolyacids”. 
This term is so common it is often inappropri- 
ately used by noncognoscenti 
to refer to all polyoxometalates. 
The word heteropoly- 
acids is partially a misnomer which leads to a key issue. The protons do not reside 
directly on the heteropolyacid 
oxygens as they do on some polyoxometalates 
(cf. 
H,V,,,O&) 
[ 1781 but rather on the water molecules of hydration that accompany 
most heteropolyacids and all soluble examples of this particular class of polyoxometa- 
lates. In other words, heteropolyacids, 
to a good approximation, 
are hydronium 
cations stabilized by heteropolyanions. 
Upon dehydration, 
the ease of which varies 
considerably 
with the particular complex, the protons move to the polyoxoanion 
oxygens. As the negative charge density on most polyoxometalates 
including the 
Keggin and Wells-Dawson complexes is even below that of the conjugate bases of 
the strongest conventional 
acids such as ClO;, BF;, PF;, 
CF,SO;, 
etc., it is not 
surprising that the dehydrated heteropolyacids 
are often superacids. It is noted for 
completeness that mixed acid salts (proton plus other cation(s)) of heteropoly com- 
pounds can sometimes be superacids [ 1791. 
Heteropolyacids 
have been shown to catalyze many acid-catalyzed reactions such 
as ester exchange [ 1671 and cyclotrimerization 
of aliphatic aldehydes [ 172,173]. 
For a fairly complete tabulation of these reactions one is referred to recent reviews 
by Misono [22,46]. Again, as these reactions entail a modest involvement of the 
polyoxoanions 
mechanistically 
and they have been adequately 
addressed in the 
above reviews, we will not reiterate this chemistry in detail one more time here. 
Heteropolyacids 
containing 
tungsten have been shown to be more stable than 
heteropolyacids 
containing molybdenum, 
consistent with the general lower lability 
of polyoxotungstates 
than the corresponding 
polyoxomolybdates. 
Misono and 
coworkers used polyoxotungstate 
derivatives to evaluate the effect of different central

in turn correlates with the trend in negative charge densities (

and H,CoW,,O,, 
least acidic) [ 1671. Sao and coworkers have examined the cyclotri- 
merization of aldehydes producing 2,4,6-trialkyl-1,3,5_trioxanes 
in high yields [ 1721. 
In these high yield reactions, the reaction mixture spontaneously 
separates into two 
liquid phases, a product phase and a catalyst phase [ 1721. This is phenomenologically 
similar to the commercial process for THF polymerization 
catalyzed by heteropolya- 
cids in which a degree of molecular weight selectivity can be obtained by selective 
precipitation of product polymer in a particular molecular weight range [ 22,180]. 
3.1.3. Multiple function 
reactions 
The robust nature of many families of polyoxometalates 
coupled with the alterabil- 
ity of their properties suggests new reaction modes and reaction engineering possi- 
bilities. For example, a single polyoxometalate 
might be formtilated to catalyze more 
than one reaction in a multireaction 
process or technology. Each reaction could be 
conducted separately in space (different reactors) and/or time (different conditions). 
A complex problem of considerable 
current technological, 
societal and economic 
significance, the bleaching and processing of wood pulp for paper manufacture, led 
to an initial attempt at using a polyoxometalate 
to catalyze multiple functions. This 
work is a collaboration 
between Ira Weinstock, Rajai Atalla, and co-workers of the 
U.S. Forest Products Laboratory, 
our laboratory at Emory University, the University 
of Wisconsin Department 
of Chemical Engineering, and companies in the pulp and 
paper industry. 
First, the prototype 
process, depicted at the top of Fig. 4, involves bleaching of 
pulp without the use of chlorinated oxidants of any kind, obviating the production 
of dioxins and other ecologically unacceptable 
chlorinated 
organics. Second, the 
most economically and environmentally 
desirable oxidant (0,) and solvent (H,O) 
are used. Third, no organic effluent of any kind is released into the environment 
(“mill closure” is achieved), and fourth, several engineering features including energy 
consumption are attractive. The first patents and papers on this chemistry have just 
appeared [ 181-1831. 
The two steps that add up to the net reaction at the top of Fig. 4 are shown in a 
cycle at the bottom of Fig. 4. First, the oxidized polyoxometalate 
selectively oxidizes 
the lignin (LigH, in Fig. 4) to fragments (Lig in Fig. 4) and is stoichiometrically 
reduced. The polyoxometalate 
properties pertinent to the redox reaction (potentials, 
etc.) can be tuned by the composition, molecular charge, protonation 
state and so 
on, so that this bleaching step is highly selective. That is, the lignin is extensively 
oxidized and oxidatively depolymerized while the cellulose is hardly modified at all. 
The selective removal of lignin without damage to the cellulose is the general goal 
in pulp bleaching; it is the cellulose that imparts the strength and substance to the 
main pulp product, paper. The redox and reactivity tuning of polyoxometalates 
has 
led to some complexes, including SiW,lVO:O, that exceed the industrial bleaching 
standard for chlorine. The second step involves complete conversion of the partly

oxidized lignin (Lig in Fig. 4) to CO, and H20, a process catalyzed by the polyoxo- 
metalate, in a separate reactor at high temperature. The polyoxometalate 
is one type 
of homogeneous 
catalyst that can not only function in two reaction conditions as 
different as those in the bleaching and mineralization 
steps but also withstand 
oxidative degradation 
under conditions 
in which nearly all organic compounds 
would be degraded (the mineralization 
reaction conditions of the second step). 
Given the number of other complicated multi-reaction 
processes and the growing 
environmental 
concerns on the part of scientists, administrators, 
legislators and 
others, the landscape in principle is extensive for development of other applications 
that require polyoxometalates 
to fulfil more than one specific molecular chemical 
function. 
3.2. Mechanistic 
overview of reactions 
The dominant mechanism in homogeneous oxidations catalyzed by mixed addenda 
polyanions involves Eqs. (8) and (9) in Fig. 3. While this type of mechanism is highly 


444

M. Presser-McCarthalCoordination Chemistry Reviews 143 (1995) 407-455 
unusual if not unprecedented 
for metal catalyzed oxidations 
by peroxides, it is 
operable in the one case summarized by the rate law in Eq. (26). In contrast, the 
common mechanism for homogeneous 
metal catalyzed peroxide epoxidations, and 
other oxidations, involving heterolytic activation of the peroxide and no reduction 
of the metal complex, a mechanism not shown in Fig. 3, is definitely operable for 
only one polyoxometalate 
catalyzed reaction thus far, that illustrated in Eq. (25). It 
is noted that other systems including the Ishii-Venture110 chemistry (Ishii precur- 
sors = PW,,Oi;, 
for example), as outlined above, involve ready polyoxometalate 
breakdown and are not accurately termed “catalysis by polyoxometalates”. 
When 
more informative mechanistic studies are conducted on a variety of other H202 or 
ROOH 
based oxidations 
catalyzed 
by polyoxometalates, 
mechanisms involving 
heterolytic 
activation 
of peroxides by intact or largely intact polyoxometalates 
may become common. 
For polyoxometalate 
facilitated O2 oxidations not involving aldehydes, carboxylic 
acids or other species that can form electrophilic peracids or peracid-like intermedi- 
ates in situ, the mechanisms are poorly understood 
at best. Kinetics investigations 
of a number of kinds on systems with carefully characterized 
polyoxometalate 
catalysts need to be conducted 
to sort out to what extent multiple mechanisms, 
autoxidation components, and carbocation intermediates (from in situ radical oxida- 
tion) are operable. While we [10,184-1861 and others [187,188] have documented 
and examined the first chemistry involving radicals and polyoxometalates, 
more 
thermodynamic 
and kinetic information is needed here for these common interactions 
to be predicted and to be of predictive value in catalytic processes. While our group 
has documented and investigated to a limited extent the involvement of carbocations 
and carbanions in polyoxometalate 
catalyzed oxidations [ 10,184-1861, less is known 
about these interactions/reactions 
than those involving radicals and polyoxometa- 
lates. As carbocations and carbanions clearly can affect the product determining step 
in catalytic transformations, 
their chemistry with polyoxometalates 
should be investi- 
gated quantitatively. This can be done by generating these intermediates via authentic 
precursors and chemistry in the presence of a range of polyoxometalates 
varying in 
redox potential. 
A key point often overlooked in studies of metal mediated oxidations of organic 
substrates by O2 is that autoxidation 
can sometimes produce particular 
organic 
oxidation products with surprisingly high selectivities, leading to an erroneous con- 
clusion that other generally more selective processes such as oxygenation (Eq. (2)) 
are operable. One case in point is the O2 oxidation of some dienes, including olefinic 
alcohol acetates “catalyzed” by [Fe30(0COR)6L3]’ 
[ 1891. Subsequent research 
indicated that this chemistry was effectively a conventional radical chain oxidation; 
the high selectivity was principally a fortuitous consequence of the reaction conditions 
and particular substrates used [ 1901.

larly the Novosibirsk group of Matveev, Kozhevnikov 
and co-workers, are largely 
responsible for the early development 
of two component 
(nonbonded) 
catalytic 
systems, with heteropoly acid/M, M = Pd or Pt (see reviews of this early research in 
Refs. [ 171 and [ 181). A considerable number of reactions of this type were reported 
in this early literature and in nearly all cases it is the Pd (Pt) and not the polyoxometa- 
late that directly interacts with and oxidizes the substrate. The Novosibirsk group 
also gets credit for some early seminal discoveries in the application of polyoxometa- 
lates in homogeneous 
catalysis, including the fact that vanadium(V) 
in Keggin 
vanadium-substituted 
polymolybdophosphates 
is a dioxygen-regenerable 
oxidant 
that essentially can take the place of copper chlorides in Wacker chemistry. 
Some of the most informative 
and valuable recent research in homogeneous 
catalysis by polyoxometalates 
has been olefin oxidation systems developed by the 
Grate 
group 
at Catalytica, 
Inc. [ 137,139-1411. 
This research 
builds on the 
Novosibirsk system for olefin oxidation, typically - 2 mM PdS04, - 0.2 M mixture 
of Ho +x) PMo~_~) 
VXOdO, 
that was in turn related to the older Wacker technology. 
Extensive kinetics and optimization 
studies by Grate and co-workers led to an 
improved Pd/PMo(,, _Xj VX04,, 
(3+X)- system that overcomes three limitations of the 
Novosibirsk 
system with respect to commercial viability: (1) poor Pd(I1) catalyst 
stability, (2) an ethylene reaction rate ca. an order of magnitude too slow, and (3) 
an oxygen reaction rate ca. an order of magnitude too slow [ 1401. Catalytica’s 
system for ethylene oxidation is typically aqueous -0.30 M in polymolybdophos- 
phate, - 0.1 mM in Pd(II), and - 5-25 mM in Cl-. The concentrations 
of the latter 
two species are two orders of magnitude lower than those in the Wacker system. In 
the Wacker, Novosibirsk, 
and Catalytica systems, it is the Pd(I1) which actually 
oxidizes olefinic substrate; the polyoxometalate 
efficiently reoxidizes the Pd(0) to 
Pd(I1) in the latter two systems. Grate and co-workers evaluated the kinetics of 
their systems over a wide range of conditions. The speciation thermodynamics 
of Pd 
as a function of pH and chloride in the catalytically relevant regime are complex 
and make for complicated rate laws. For details of the rate behavior and optimization 
of chemistry and engineering, one is refereed to the original articles [ 139,140]. 
An important feature of this work involved a collaboration 
between the Catalytica 
group and L. Pettersson and co-workers in Sweden, some of the foremost experts in 
the area of polyoxometalate 
speciation thermodynamics. 
Two recent papers describe 
application of NMR, potentiometric 
and other methods to the quantitative delinea- 
tion of vanadium( V)-substituted polymolybdophosphate 
speciation under conditions 
of relevance to the Catalytica 
research [136,138].

Pettersson and Grate on thermodynamic 
speciation of the aqueous vanadophosphate 
system [ 1371.

none, cyclohexenol, 
and cyclohexene oxide in selectivities of 62%, 32%, and 5%, 
respectively. The rate is solvent dependent, decreasing as follows: dichloromethane

1,2-dichloroethane > acetone > acetonitrile >> 
N, N-dimethylacetamide 
- dimethylsulf- 
oxide [ 1421. Some preliminary kinetics were presented but more points were required 
for significant interpretation 
as the rate law exhibits saturation kinetics. While the 
title and thrust of this paper is that the complexes are catalysts, the product distribu- 
tions are typically those seen in radical chain 0, oxidations. The authors realize 
that this and the kinetics are not inconsistent with the likely situation that these 
complexes are functioning primarily to initiate autoxidation and not actually catalyz- 
ing “oxygenation”, to use the words of the authors. The oxidation processes associ- 
ated with the meticulously characterized polyoxometalate-supported 
organometallic 
species by this group warrant an in-depth examination, and we understand that the 
needed mechanistic studies are in fact nearing completion [ 1941. 
4.2. Reduction reactions 
Finke and coworkers 
reported 
the synthesis, characterization, 
catalytic alkene 
hydrogenation 
activity, kinetics, and mechanistic studies on the polyoxometalate- 
supported organometallic complex 4Q5Na3[( 1,5-COD)Ir*P2W1,Nb,0,,] 
[ 192,195]. 
As polydisperse catalytically active Ir(0) nanoclusters are produced in these reactions, 
this chemistry is discussed below (Section 5, Related literature studies). 
4.3. Other reactions 
Izumi and coworkers reported the high yield synthesis of methyl N-phenyl carba- 
mate from reductive carbonylation 
catalyzed by a mixture of PdCl, and Keggin type 
heteropolyanions 
containing MO or V as addenda atoms; Eq. (27) and Table 4 [ 193). 
Neither PdCl, nor the polyoxometalate 
alone is catalytically effective. The reaction 
rate, calculated from PhNOz conversion 
data based on the empirical zero-order 
dependence of the conversion on reaction time, increased in proportion 
to both CO 
pressure and Pd concentration 
but showed a 0.43-order dependence on the concen- 
tration of PhNO,. The apparent activation energy was estimated to be 38 kJ mall’. 
It is hard to know exactly what these kinetics mean in this complex system given 
the limited data but the authors rightly conclude that the mechanism of this poten- 
tially useful reaction is quite unclear [ 1933.

5. Related literature studies 
Other studies, while not rigorously 
falling under the purview of this article 
on homogeneous 
catalysis by polyoxometalates, 
are related phenomenologically 
and intellectually 
to this subject and thus we would like to address them. The 
first are the recent 
studies by Finke 
and coworkers 
on the decomposition 
of 
electron-rich-polyoxometalate-supported 
Ir 
complexes, 
and 
principally

4QsNa3[( 1,5-COD)Ir-P2W1sNb306J, 
to form polyoxometalate-stabilized 
Ir(0) 
nanoclusters during alkene hydrogenation. 
The term nanoclusters was used as the 
clusters are in this size regime (e.g. 30 &- 
4 A and 20 f 4 A depending on the conditions 
of preparation). 
While these Ir(0) nanoclusters are polydisperse and as such would 
not be included in this review on catalysis by discrete molecules (monodisperse 
systems), this work is of sufficient interest to mention here. Initially, these authors 
argued 
that alkene hydrogenation 
was being catalyzed 
by the discrete well- 
characterized 
molecule, 
4QsNa3[( 1,5-COD)Ir*P,Wr5Nb,0s2] 
[ 192,195]. 
The 
authors initially and reasonably ruled out a [Ir(O),] colloid based on three observa- 
tions: first, evaporation of the catalyst solution to dryness and redissolution produced 
no visible Ir(0) colloid; second, molecular weight measurements were consistent with 
monomer; and third, the reproducibility 
of both the hydrogenation 
curve and the 
reaction rate was high (k 15%) [ 1953. Subsequent work by these investigators, 
however, including transmission electron micrographs of the samples after reaction, 
provided compelling evidence that Ir(0) colloids with unusually uniform particle 
sizes are in fact formed during alkene hydrogenation 
and that these colloidal 
nanoclusters 
are the catalytically competent species [196]. The spatial uniformity 
and stability of these clusters are of interest and these systems provide as good a 
vehicle as any to address the structural and dynamic features of the moleculecolloid 
boundary. 
For descriptions of the thorough 
characterization 
of these Ir(0) nano- 
clusters and their chemistry, one is referred to the appropriate 
papers [ 197,198]. 
The second study, that of Day, Klemperer and co-workers, is included here even 
though it strictly doesn’t involve either an early-transition-metal 
polyoxometalate 
or 
catalysis. These investigators conducted a stoichiometric oxidation of an Ir complex 
with two ligands: 1,5-cylooctadiene, the substrate, and cyclotriphosphate, 
a polyden- 
tate ligand structurally 
analogous 
to the surfaces of some early-transition-metal 
polyoxometalates. 
[(CsHr2)Ir(P,09)J- 
reacts with l/2 O2 to form an oxometallo- 
cyclobutane, 
[(CsH,zO)Ir(P,09)]2-, 
which rearranges to rc-ally1 hydroxy complex, 
[(C,H1rOH)Ir( 
P309)12-. All three complexes were characterized by X-ray crystal- 
lography [ 1991. While it has been intellectually argued and physically demonstrated 
that metal complexes isolated from metal-complex-catalyzed 
reactions usually do 
not lie along the principal catalysis reaction coordinate 
and are hence marginally 
relevant to catalysis [200,201], the extensive work of Burgi and Dunitz [202] argues 
effectively that a series of static structures map out a reaction surface approximating 
a reaction coordinate. 
This initial elegant effort of Day and Klemperer provides 
structural information that is probably of some predictive value. These investigators 
are interested in making this system catalytic. 
6. Ion pairing in polyoxometalates 
One phenomenon that requires significant research is ion pairing in polyoxometa- 
lates and, more generally, ionic interactions of these compounds in solution, where 
nearly all homogeneous 
catalysis takes place. The strength, number, lifetimes and 
other features of cation-polyanion 
and to a lesser extent cation-cation 
and poly-

449 
anion-polyanion 
interactions that affect, to varying degrees, every molecular attribute 
of polyoxometalates 
involved in their solution chemistry and catalysis must be more 
thoroughly 
investigated. These attributes 
include effective charge, ability to form 
hydrogen 
and ionic bonds, ground state redox potential 
and, less importantly, 
effective size (hydrodynamic 
radius) and shape. Only limited information is available 
on polyoxometalate 
ion pairing interactions 
in both aqueous and nonaqueous 
solvents. Some early published work provides quantitative 
and insightful thermo- 
dynamic and kinetic information on ion pairing in V1004; and some Keggin-derived 
complexes in water [203-205-J. Unfortunately, 
this work was terminated before the 
versatility and value of polyoxometalates 
in catalysis and other areas of science 
and technology 
was fully appreciated. 
Static structural 
effects of ion binding in 
Nb,W,O;‘; 
[ 206,207] and V1,02; (careful X-ray diffraction, vapor pressure osmom- 
etry and multinuclear 
solution NMR) [178] have been documented 
by Day and 
Klemperer and co-workers. Hill and co-workers have documented ion pairing and 
solvation effects on the electronic absorption 
and photochemical 
action spectra of 
polyoxometalates 
[208-2101 and protonation 
state effects on the dynamic behavior 
(rates 
and 
selectivities 
of 
products) 
in 
photocatalytic 
alkane 
functional- 
ization 
[ 1851. Finke and co-workers 
reported 
the stepwise deprotonation 
of 
H3SiW,V30i, 
and H,P2W1,V,0& 
in organic solvents and garnered qualitative 
information about proton mobility in these dissolved complexes from documenting 
the effects of protonation 
and the presence of water, pyridine and pyridinum on the 
2gSi, 31P, ‘lV and ‘83W NMR spectra of these complexes [211]. This group also 
addressed the combinatorial 
possibilities associated with multiple cations and highly 
charged polyanions in a footnote to one paper [212]. The only recent study that 
addresses dynamic ion pairing effects in a semiquantitative manner involves examina- 
tion of the electron exchange rates between Keggin complexes in water as a function 
of ionic strength [213]. A surprisingly good fit to an equation derived from Debye- 
Huckel theory was given. Future work must seek to document and understand ionic 
effects in polyoxometalate 
complexes under conditions of homogeneous 
catalysis. 
The strengths and lifetimes of such interactions 
and their effects on association of 
substrates, dissociation of products and other phenomena relevant to catalysis must 
be assessed. This will require simultaneous application of definitive probes of solution 
structure and detailed kinetics studies. 
7. Outlook 
Considerable research, most of quite recent vintage, on homogeneous catalysis by 
polyoxometalates, 
coupled with the continuing development of commercially viable 
systems buttress the points made at the outset: polyoxometalates 
are an extraordinar- 
ily versatile class of complexes with potential catalytic application for a variety of 
attractive processes. These include O2 and H,O,-based 
oxidations

that take place under environmentally 
benign conditions. 
Polyoxometalates, 
as nanoscopic clusters, offer properties not seen in solid hetero- 
geneous catalysts nor in soluble monomeric homogeneous 
catalysts. Their intrinsic

compositions 
enable many to exhibit the stability advantages 
of heterogeneous 
catalysts with the tunability and selectivity advantages of homogeneous catalysts. 
To temper the obvious promise of polyoxometalates, 
we must realize that consider- 
able fundamental work, much of it at a more definitive level of molecular sophistica- 
tion than most reported so far, is needed if this area is to advance to realize its 
promise. 
The knowledge we will garner from such studies will give us more predictive 
power in designing effective and successful homogeneous 
polyoxometalate-based 
catalytic technology of value in synthesis, materials science, and possibly medicine.
