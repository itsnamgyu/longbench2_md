Rory Prince shoved the ice pack against his throbbing eye and tried unsuccessfully to tune out the offensive early morning kitchen sounds. The scratching of his oldest brother\u2019s pencil across the table might as well have been an air horn pressed directly to the center of his forehead\u2014and was way too efficient for nine a.m. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d Rory muttered. \u201cI\u2019m in recovery mode.\u201d \u201cWhen are you not?\u201d Andrew didn\u2019t even bother to look up from the two clipboards on which he seemed determined to make endless notations. \u201cIt\u2019s Memorial Day weekend and I have two schedules to organize. Sorry I can\u2019t accommodate your hangover.\u201d His pencil flew from one set of grids to another. \u201cWhere did the black eye come from?\u201d \u201cYes, I thought you only gave those out,\u201d Rory\u2019s other brother, Jamie, said from behind his raised, open book. \u201cWho got the drop on you?\u201d \u201cSome DFS\u2019s,\u201d Rory responded, shifting the ice pack, and his brothers hummed in acknowledgment, well aware that DFS stood for Down for the Summer. As in, those who didn\u2019t live year-round in Long Beach but showed up for three months out of the year to make hell for the residents. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he ended up with two instead of one.\u201d Jamie sighed and finally lowered his worn-in copy of The Grapes of Wrath. \u201cAren\u2019t physical altercations a violation of your probation?\u201d Rory winked his good eye. \u201cOnly if I get caught.\u201d Andrew tossed aside the pencil and flattened both hands on the kitchen table. \u201cAll right. I tried to give everyone at least one full day off every week\u2014\u201d \u201cJesus, man,\u201d Rory deadpanned. \u201cDon\u2019t spoil us.\u201d \u201cLook. We\u2019ve got a bar to run.\u201d Andrew massaged his eyes with a forefinger and thumb. Not for the first time, Rory noticed the new lines at the corners and the ice pack started to feel heavier in his hand. \u201cI know it\u2019s a lot, lifeguarding during the day and working behind the bar at night. If I could eliminate one of them for us, I would.\u201d He dropped his hand. \u201cThings are different than they were four years ago, though. We should be used to it by now.\u201d Things were different? Christ, what an understatement. Rory, Andrew and Jamie traded long looks over the table, before quickly moving their attention elsewhere. A familiar pit took up residence in Rory\u2019s stomach, but he filled it with cement and pasted a bored expression on his face. \u201cLook, all I know is I\u2019m not working Trivia Tuesdays at the bar.\u201d He pointed at Jamie. \u201cYou herd the nerds this year.\u201d \u201cAs long as I can still participate in the quiz while serving drinks.\u201d Rory\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cGod forbid you miss a chance to blow minds with your bottomless intellect.\u201d Jamie turned the page of his book. \u201cWhat good is being a genius if I can\u2019t make everyone else feel stupid?\u201d Andrew grabbed their attention with a knuckle rap on the table. \u201cAll right, so Jamie, you\u2019re on Tuesday nights.\u201d Their older brother made a notation on one of his clipboards. \u201cI\u2019m taking Sunday and Monday because the sports crowd is belligerent and Rory will knock someone out and end up back in a concrete cell\u2014\u201d \u201cMore than likely,\u201d Rory drawled, taking a few gulps of black coffee. \u201cWe\u2019re all hands on deck Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights\u2014everyone works. So that leaves Wednesday night open.\u201d Andrew speared him with a look. \u201cYou got it covered?\u201d \u201cSure. Wet T-shirt Wednesdays\u2014\u201d \u201cNu-uh. Not happening.\u201d Rory smiled at his strait-laced oldest brother to let him know he\u2019d been joking. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got it, man.\u201d With a nod, Andrew penciled in the final details to the Castle Gate schedule, hoisting it up like Moses probably held the Ten Commandments. \u201cThe next three months are going to be crazy, but when things quiet back down in September, we\u2019ll have a lot less of Dad\u2019s debt to show for it. We\u2019re almost there. Play our cards right and this could be the year.\u201d He didn\u2019t meet their eyes. \u201cHeads down and plow through, okay?\u201d Finally, he ticked a look in both of their directions. \u201cAnd let me know if anyone asks about him.\u201d Rory swallowed. \u201cWill do.\u201d Jamie set his book down, which was as good as an agreement. \u201cNext order of business,\u201d Andrew started, trading a not-so-subtle glance with Jamie. \u201cMom\u2019s birthday is coming up in a few weeks.\u201d \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d Rory drawled, his neck itching. \u201cDamn thing rolls around at least once every single year. Same time, too.\u201d \u201cAre you going to come?\u201d Jamie asked, shifting in his chair. \u201cI don\u2019t think you realize how much she\u2019d like to see you, Rory.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right, I don\u2019t.\u201d He laughed without humor and polished off his coffee, softening his tone when his brothers looked disappointed. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know, huh?\u201d Before anyone could respond, the back door of their kitchen opened and Jiya Dalal, the fourth member of their family, breezed in. \u201cMorning, suckers,\u201d she murmured, flipping her wave of black hair over her shoulder. \u201cWhere\u2019s my coffee?\u201d On cue, Andrew abandoned his almighty clipboards and rose to pour her a cup. Jiya wasn\u2019t technically related, but Rory loved her like a sister. She\u2019d moved with her parents from India to Long Beach the summer before starting fifth grade. One afternoon, Rory and Andrew were playing catch in the backyard\u2014while Jamie read in the shade of their cedar tree\u2014when they noticed a somber brown eye watching them through a hole in the old, rotted fence. That\u2019s when the yelling started inside their house. Not just yelling. Angry, vile words meant to cause pain, coming from their father. In those days, their mother responded in kind, too. Before things had escalated. Slowly, the fence board had slid to one side, revealing a girl Andrew\u2019s age, wearing a pink Punjabi suit\u2014although he hadn\u2019t known what to call her outfit at the time. She\u2019d waved all three Prince boys through, leading them without words to her garage where they\u2019d watched cartoons on an old television set, Mrs. Dalal bringing them ice-cold Pepsi cans with straws stuck in the top. Jiya\u2019s English had only allowed them the most basic communication back then, but eighteen years later, there was only a trace of her accent remaining and she could swear like a goddamn sailor. Jiya slid over a large metal container from its place of honor on their counter and scooped cumin from its smaller compartment into the pressure cooker where Andrew had already started soaking the ghee to make khichdi, their morning staple ever since Jiya had taken pity on three starving men. Knowing she would twist his ear like silly putty if he didn\u2019t get up to help, Rory stood, breathing through his nose when his brain lurched and smacked off the front of his skull. \u201cFuck me,\u201d he rasped, pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cI hate summer.\u201d During the rest of the year, Rory worked the bar five nights a week. He made enough money to be comfortable and contribute to the mortgage he shared with his brothers. His customers were regulars. Friends. Locals. As soon as Memorial Day weekend hit, Long Beach transformed into a whole different animal. For one, lifeguarding season began, which meant waking up at the ass crack of dawn. Everyone on the beach was jacked for the time of their life, which meant they acted like idiots\u2014and he couldn\u2019t even escape them at the end of the day, since they inevitably showed up at the Castle Gate at night. \u201cI love summertime,\u201d Jiya breathed, turning and leaning back against the counter. \u201cMy tips at the restaurant triple. By September, I should finally be able to afford the lessons.\u201d As far back as Rory could remember, Jiya had wanted to fly an airplane, but slow season at the restaurant she ran with her parents always seemed to eat into her funds. Every year around this time, she said the same thing. I should finally be able to afford the lessons. Rory glanced over at Andrew to find him staring at Jiya\u2019s profile, a frown marring his features. \u201cHell yeah.\u201d He moved around Jiya and elbowed Andrew. \u201cThat\u2019s great, Ji. Where are you flying us first?\u201d Andrew handed her a mug of coffee and she breathed in the steam, her dark eyes sparkling. \u201cI\u2019m thinking a pit stop in the Maldives before we hop over to Australia.\u201d \u201cCount me in,\u201d Jamie said, joining them at the counter to grate ginger onto the cutting board. \u201cLet me know when to start packing.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll need three extra suitcases for his books,\u201d Rory laughed, then winced when his cranium protested. \u201cSon of a bitch. Today is going to suck.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s Advil in my purse.\u201d He almost dove for the leather satchel she\u2019d hung on a chair. \u201cYou\u2019re an angel.\u201d \u201cTrue facts.\u201d Jiya took an exaggerated breath, set her coffee down and the four of them fell into their usual routine of making breakfast. \u201cWhat time do you have to be at the Hut?\u201d she asked, referring to the squat, brick headquarters adjacent to the boardwalk where the lifeguards checked in each morning. \u201cEleven,\u201d Andrew answered, saluting the kitchen in general with the spatula. \u201cLong Beach, your lives are in the hands of the Prince brothers.\u201d Rory dry-swallowed a painkiller. \u201cGod help them all.\u201d \n CHAPTER TWO The Prince brothers lived, ate, argued and worked two jobs together, so there was no shortage of face time. Hell, they were never not in each other\u2019s faces. There\u2019d been no formal discussion when deciding that morning not to ride to the Hut as a trio. It had gone unsaid they would find their own way there. Did they love each other? Yeah. Would they have each other\u2019s backs in an alley, even if the odds were three against three hundred? Rory would already be searching the ground for a potential weapon. Did they need some space occasionally? Bet your ass. While Jamie hopped on the bus, Andrew and Jiya had driven together in his pick-up truck toward the boardwalk. Hoping the late-May breeze would clear the vodka cobwebs from his head, Rory walked, instead of taking his motorcycle. The last-minute decision to hoof it had thrown off his morning routine, resulting in him forgetting his cell phone on the kitchen table, but judging from the packed avenues, he should be thankful he wouldn\u2019t have to battle for a parking space with a hangover. At ten o\u2019clock in the morning, there was already a traffic jam at every intersection, college kids staring at their smartphones at stoplights, the nasal voice of their navigation systems drifting out of the open car windows. A news helicopter circled above, probably feeding footage of the filling beach town back to a local station where a newscaster chirped to the audience. This Memorial Day weekend is certainly shaping up to be the busiest yet, Bob! Andrew had been right about the last four years yielding big changes for the Princes. Their mother lived in Bayside, Queens now with her sister. Their father wasn\u2019t around anymore. It was just the three of them, back in the house they\u2019d been raised, working to pay bills. The more things change, the more they stay the same, though, right? The walk down National Boulevard toward the beach felt like it had been recycled from the four previous summers of his life. Wake up after a night of blurry, shit-faced memories, face the guarded disappointment across the kitchen table, while nursing a healthy dose of his own. Fall into the same routine. Beach, bar, bed. Never changing. Never growing or taking on more responsibility. An actor trapped in the reruns of his own life. What would he do if Andrew asked him to help manage the bar? Or hire and train this year\u2019s newest crop of lifeguards? Not that such an occurrence would ever take place, but would he be able to deliver on more, if asked? Rory was distracted from his thoughts when a blonde walked past him on the sidewalk with her face buried in a book. \u201cJesus,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThe female version of Jamie.\u201d When she\u2019d gotten a few feet ahead of Rory, he was powerless to do anything but check out her ass. If there was one perk to summers in Long Beach, it was the abbreviated attire, and this girl was no exception. She wore little, white bun-hugger shorts and flip-flops, gracing Rory with a front row seat to the tight, side-to-side twitch of her backside. It was a superior tush. So superior, he shook out his right hand like it had been burned. Shame he couldn\u2019t see her face. The forward tilt of her head caused short, blonde hair to curtain around her features as she speed walked to the corner, never looking up from her book. Rory\u2019s frown deepened the closer she got to intersection. Traffic might be moving slowly, but the bus lane was wide open and he knew from experience how fast they flew. \u201cHey.\u201d He cleared his throat and raised his voice. \u201cHey.\u201d She continued walking, face in book. \u201cDammit.\u201d Rory gritted his teeth and started to run, not an easy feat considering he\u2019d paired flip-flops with his sweatpants. But he had no choice to sprint, because she was five feet from the crosswalk and showing no signs of slowing down. He caught up with her just as she stepped into the street, wrapping an arm around her waist and yanking her back\u2014 The East Loop bus barreled past blaring its horn. \u201cOh my God.\u201d She dropped her book\u2014about fucking time\u2014and dug her fingernails into his forearm. \u201cDid that\u2026oh God, that bus almost hit me.\u201d \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have made it any easier,\u201d Rory near-shouted at the top of her head, sounding winded. With her back plastered to his front, Rory could practically feel her shock wear off, giving way to a wave of trembling. He heaved a sigh and lowered his voice. \u201cConsider a switch to audiobooks, huh? Maybe?\u201d Her head tipped forward, presumably to look at her fallen book. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the narrator for this one.\u201d \u201cEnough to get hit by a bus?\u201d A few beats passed. \u201cIf I say yes, will you start shouting again?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThen\u2026no?\u201d Realizing he still held the stranger in a death grip, Rory let her go in degrees to assure himself she was steady. The blonde turned around and blinked up at him through round, red-rimmed eyeglasses\u2014and he experienced the most unexpected twist in his chest. He must have run harder and faster than he thought, because he was winded all over again. On a sucked-in breath, an odd sound escaped his mouth. A scrape of noise. What the hell? This girl. She was fucking\u2026amazing. She reminded him of a little sunbeam with summer-kissed skin and big features, especially those dove-gray eyes. Oh fuck. Her lips. They were parted slightly and inviting, the sun bathing them in a sheen. Forget what he\u2019d said about her being the female version of Jamie. \u201cWhoa,\u201d she whispered. Tell me about it. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d If her widened eyes meant she was surprised by the sudden drop in his voice, she wasn\u2019t the only one. \u201cI\u2019m Olive. Cunningham.\u201d \u201cOlive.\u201d For some reason, color climbed her neck when he said her name. \u201cI\u2019m Rory Prince.\u201d \u201cHi.\u201d She smacked a hand to her forehead. \u201cAnd duh. Thank you. For saving me from being road kill. If I had to die horrifically, I would have chosen a different book to be my last.\u201d Rory stooped down and picked up the fallen tome, making no effort to hide his perusal of her bare legs on the way back up. They were covered in goose bumps. \u201cYou\u2019re making it sound like you hate this book\u2026\u201d he said, stepping close until she tilted her head back to maintain eye contact. \u201cBut you were lost in another world reading it.\u201d \u201cI get lost in magazines at the dentist office.\u201d He heard her swallow. \u201cI just have a thing for words.\u201d \u201cWhat else do you have a thing for?\u201d \u201cProbably other stuff,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut I\u2019m having trouble thinking of them right this second.\u201d \u201cWhy is that?\u201d \u201cI almost got hit by a bus.\u201d She jerked a thumb over her shoulder. \u201cDid you miss that?\u201d Rory couldn\u2019t stop his grin. \u201cOh, I caught it.\u201d Up ahead, he could hear the ocean and knew he needed to be at work. He would let down Andrew at some point this summer, no need to make it on the first day. But this girl. He was just supposed to walk away? His grin faded. \u201cI have to be at work soon. I\u2019m lifeguarding today and we start at eleven. But I have a few minutes before I have to run.\u201d He forced a concerned expression onto his face. \u201cYou look shaken up, sunbeam. We should probably get you a coffee and my number.\u201d A laugh burst out of her, loud enough to turn heads on the sidewalk. She slapped her hands over her mouth but continued to giggle behind them. The sound was so contagious, his own low rumble joined it and he couldn\u2019t help but think, there\u2019s never been a morning like this. There\u2019s nothing even remotely recycled about this. \u201cI\u2019m actually meeting a girlfriend,\u201d Olive said finally. \u201cIt\u2019s a study date.\u201d \u201cI have great news. No one studies during the summer time.\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d With a smile that showed off the slight gap between her two front teeth, she pushed her glasses higher on her nose. \u201cAt the risk of sounding like a huge nerd, I\u2019m taking a summer class at Stony Brook. I\u2019m going to be a psychology major there in the fall and I want to be familiar with the course materials. And okay\u2026\u201d She blushed to her hairline. \u201cI didn\u2019t risk sounding like a huge nerd. That was full-on dweeb.\u201d Even though her enthusiasm was adorable, Rory encountered a kick of unease. He\u2019d never been in a serious relationship, but he\u2019d gone out with a lot of different kinds of girls\u2026once. There wasn\u2019t much that could intimidate him. He\u2019d grown up poor and served hard time. But people with book smarts? Yeah, he had the look memorized. That look. The one that said they pegged him as being uneducated with nothing in his future but answering to someone else and making a working man\u2019s salary for it. On those extremely rare occasions Rory spent time with a book-smart girl, he didn\u2019t really give a shit when she gave him the look. The one that said, I\u2019m going to enjoy tonight and never tell a single one of my friends about it. What did he care? He wasn\u2019t exactly planning on telling anyone, either. It was just a basic need being met. A diversion. Olive didn\u2019t seem like a diversion. Not even a little bit. He really didn\u2019t want her to give him the look. \u201cUh, right.\u201d Rory winked at Olive, handed her the book and backed in the direction of the beach. \u201cLook, no more walking without looking where you\u2019re going, all right, sunbeam?\u201d Her smile dropped. \u201cDon\u2019t study too hard,\u201d he said, punching the crosswalk button. Damn, walking away from a girl wasn\u2019t supposed to be hard, was it? His stomach felt like two stones grinding together. When he glanced back, Olive took a step toward him, then changed her mind and retreated. With a weird tightening in his throat, Rory faced the street again. The light changed and Rory started to cross\u2014 \u201cWait!\u201d \n CHAPTER THREE Too bad you couldn\u2019t edit real life. Because she\u2019d definitely just yelled, \u201cWait!\u201d At the hottest guy she\u2019d ever seen in person. A hot guy who\u2019d saved her life. Good thing she\u2019d sounded extra desperate. Olive Cunningham tried not to cringe at the note of desperation hanging in the warm summer air and watched Rory slow to a stop, glancing back at her over his muscular shoulder. Wariness danced in eyes she knew were translucent green and hardened the strong lines of his back, reminding her of an unbroken stallion. What had she said to make him throw up his guard? Olive was positive it could have been any number of things. Having been home schooled straight through the twelfth grade, her experience with the opposite sex was limited to neighborhood boys and the ones she read about in books. When it came time for her to start dating, she\u2019d envisioned herself with a starter boyfriend. Someone non-threatening and endearingly awkward who was still developing the fashion sense that would stay with him throughout adulthood. Rory was the least awkward human being she\u2019d ever encountered. His dark brown hair was finger brushed and somehow perfect, offset by his cut jaw and the beginning shadow of scruff. He was smooth and he lived inside his skin like a worn-in pair of jeans. Not a starter boyfriend. Not a boy anything. Sexual, bold, protective, funny. A man. A man with a black eye. And like, twenty-six tattoos, not that she\u2019d tried to count. His sigh carried on the breeze as he returned to the sidewalk, planting his big hands on narrow hips. \u201cYeah, sunbeam?\u201d Don\u2019t just stand here and moon over him giving you a nickname. Think fast. \u201cPublic access television,\u201d she blurted. \u201cRainstorms, Sting, calligraphy\u2026milkshakes.\u201d He raised a dark eyebrow. \u201cYou asked me what else I have a thing for,\u201d Olive explained, clutching the book to her chest. When his mouth spread into a smile, she realized he had full, beautiful lips. Attached to his angular face, they made him look like an angel who\u2019d spent some time in hell. \u201cSting? Isn\u2019t he a little before your time?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the great thing about music. When you discover it for the first time, it might as well be brand new.\u201d Since he didn\u2019t seem inclined to come any closer, even though they\u2019d practically kissed a few minutes ago, Olive braved up and took a few steps in Rory\u2019s direction. Watched him plant his tongue against the inside of his cheek and breathe slowly. \u201cIf I ask what you have a thing for, will I regret it?\u201d Rory didn\u2019t respond. He was probably wondering why some random chick was on a mission to make him late for work. Honestly, she was pretty impressed by her own bravery. She\u2019d only been living on her own in Long Beach for a week. In that time, she\u2019d learned all about ordering takeout online, assembled a butt load of furniture and explored enough of the town to go out for a walk without getting lost. Apparently she hadn\u2019t quite conquered the ability to avoid death by speeding bus. Baby steps. Everything she\u2019d done since arriving from Oklahoma had seemed small. A tiny tick toward being a fully independent adult, out from under the thumb of her parents. Maybe they\u2019d been more like leaps, though, because she was definitely flirting a little bit with a sexy lifeguard with no clue if she was doing it correctly. The longer Rory went without answering, though, the more her confidence started to wane. She wasn\u2019t his type. He had a girlfriend. She\u2019d shown too much interest. It could have been any number of things that made him back off. Best to chalk this conversation up to a practice run and go back to reading. While stationary this time. \u201cOkay, um\u2026\u201d She shrugged her left shoulder. \u201cHave a good day at work. Thanks again for preventing my early demise\u2026\u201d Olive trailed off as Rory relieved her of the book, tucked it under his arm and presented his hand. \u201cMilkshakes, right? I got you.\u201d \u201cWait. What?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to get a milkshake.\u201d They both watched closely as he wove their fingers together and sparks tickled the length of Olive\u2019s arm. \u201cAnd I\u2019m carrying your books for you while we talk about Sting. We\u2019ve been transported back to another time and place.\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t you going to be late for work?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll drink fast. Come on.\u201d Just like that, Olive Cunningham of Muskogee, Oklahoma was being pulled along National Boulevard by a man who oozed excitement\u2026and some definite danger. Shouldn\u2019t she be more cautious? Yes. Certainly. But why would this man save her life only to kill her? He\u2019d been the one to walk away, too. She\u2019d called him back. Surely it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have a milkshake with him in public in broad daylight. Reassured, Olive allowed her own excitement to take flight. She watched the flex of his back and triceps as they walked, puzzled over the speculative glances he threw at her over his shoulder. Overall, though, she was relieved they hadn\u2019t parted ways back at the intersection. Something told her she wouldn\u2019t have put Rory from her mind easily at all. They had only been walking for a few minutes when Rory pulled Olive to a stop in front of Mike\u2019s Shakes. As she\u2019d seen earlier during her internet search, the old-fashioned sign was faded, the windows were wallpapered in advertisements for local music gigs and milkshake specials. Rory opened the door to the sound of a tinkling bell, as if escorting her into a palace. \u201cAfter you.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d she murmured, passing beneath his arm and feeling his breath on her temple. \u201cTh-this is actually where I\u2019m meeting my study date.\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d She hummed. \u201cIt\u2019s my first time here, though.\u201d As always, when about to try something new or perform an out-of-the-ordinary activity, Olive heard her mother\u2019s voice in her ear. Hello, YouTubers! Today we\u2019re at Mike\u2019s Milkshakes celebrating three million subscribers. Comment down below with your favorite milkshake flavor! Don\u2019t forget to hit the like button. Olive gave a rapid headshake, trying to jostle the voice free. How long would she turn even the most basic event into a YouTube video? Rory, still holding her hand, led her to one of the few booths positioned in front of the window, sliding into the booth beside her. On the same side. He stretched his arm along the back of the seat as easy as breathing, and within those close quarters, his scent hit her stronger than it had outside. Menthol shaving cream, coffee, the faint smell of something sharp. \u201cAt least wait until after we order to sniff me.\u201d \u201cOh God.\u201d She faced forward in a snap. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I was doing it.\u201d The tan column of his neck flexed as he laughed. \u201cMy turn now,\u201d he said, sobering, leaning in. \u201cFair is fair.\u201d The tip of Rory\u2019s nose grazed her neck and Olive\u2019s thighs audibly smacked together, squeezing, her lips popping open on a gasp as he breathed deeply in the space above her pulse. What was happening to her? Had this man reached inside her and found an on switch for her sex drive? As recently as this morning, she\u2019d almost had to talk herself into being horny and exploring her urges, because grown women were supposed to be. Thoughts, fantasies, book scenes inspired her. Never someone in the flesh. Live and in person. Rory pulled back and locked glazed eyes on her, their mouths mere inches apart. \u201cJesus Christ. Barely touched you. Wonder what that body would do if I got my hands and mouth on it?\u201d Faster than lightning, the seam of Olive\u2019s shorts became damp, uncomfortable. Rory\u2019s breaths came faster against her lips. They were going to kiss, right here in this milkshake shop\u2014and even with precious little kissing experience, she wondered if they\u2019d be able to stop. \u201cAll right, you two,\u201d the waiter groused from behind Rory. \u201cAin\u2019t it a little early for this?\u201d Rory\u2019s expression went from hot to cold so fast, Olive shivered. A muscle jumped in his cheek as he sat up straighter and slowly turned to face the waiter, hitting him with a stony look. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d His long fingers flexed on the table top, his fist coming down hard on the surface. Whap. \u201cIs it?\u201d The waiter was suddenly fascinated by his order pad. \u201cIt\u2019s all good, man. Sorry. What can I bring you?\u201d Another handful of seconds passed before Rory answered, the tension building further in the small restaurant. \u201cWhatever your three most popular flavors are,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll take those.\u201d \u201cYou got it.\u201d Olive didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d been holding her breath until the waiter loped off, disappearing through the swinging doors into the kitchen. She let it out silently, her awareness of Rory\u2019s air of danger bigger and more unavoidable than before. What in the world had just happened? This man who\u2019d pulled her out of the path of oncoming traffic seemed capable of mowing people down just as handily. As if reading her mind, Rory shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the smart ones, Olive,\u201d he said, pronouncing smart like smahht. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to call me back.\u201d Her pulse skipped as she processed that. \u201cYou were trying to protect me from yourself?\u201d He searched her face but didn\u2019t answer. \u201cDo I need protecting?\u201d \u201cGod, no, sunbeam. Not from me,\u201d he rasped, frustration shifting his body in the seat. \u201cLook, you asked me if you\u2019d regret it. Finding out what I have a thing for. The answer is yes.\u201d He tilted his face toward the light, giving her a better view of his damaged eye. \u201cAsk me how I got this.\u201d It was so hard not to follow that command, considering she\u2019d been dying to know the source of his injury since they\u2019d crossed paths. She didn\u2019t want to hear the answer now, though. Not when he clearly thought it was going to be a deal breaker. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell me when you\u2019re ready?\u201d That caught him off guard, but he recovered fast. \u201cI was out being a fucking idiot. Looking for\u2026\u201d He trailed off, as if surprised by his own words. \u201cI look for the fights. I go out and find them.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He tapped a fist on the table. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t matter. You shouldn\u2019t be around it. You\u2019re the type of girl who\u2019d realize it sooner than later, so I beat you to the punch.\u201d The expression he turned on her was almost accusatory. \u201cTurns out, it\u2019s not that easy to walk away from you.\u201d The waiter appeared at the side of the table with a tray, moving their milkshake trio one by one in front of them and setting down straws. In Olive\u2019s periphery, she could see the waiter hovering as if wanting to ask if they needed anything else, but she couldn\u2019t manage to rip her attention off of Rory and the waiter eventually left. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to walk away.\u201d He laughed under his breath. \u201cYou going to be trouble for me, sunbeam?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just drink milkshakes?\u201d Still looking troubled, Rory unwrapped three straws and stuck them into their own respective milkshakes. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s pick our favorite. You first.\u201d \u201cWait, no.\u201d Olive\u2019s spine went ramrod straight. \u201cThis feels way too much like a YouTube channel challenge.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what any of that means, but it sounds serious.\u201d \u201cOh, you have no idea. Subscribers hang in the balance.\u201d When his confusion demanded an explanation, she blew out a long breath. \u201cI moved here from Oklahoma a week ago.\u201d \u201cThat explains the cute accent.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have an accent. You do.\u201d \u201cAgree to disagree.\u201d He picked up the chocolate milkshake, his fingers sliding through the condensation on the glass as he gripped it, held the straw to her bottom lip. \u201cTaste, Olive.\u201d Her thighs threatened to smack together again, but she narrowly avoided the action, drinking deeply of the thick, delicious shake, rich cocoa waking up her taste buds and making them sing. All the while, Rory\u2019s gaze tracked a path from her lips to the hollow of her throat and back. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d she managed, letting the straw go. \u201cAnd this is nothing like a challenge.\u201d \u201cGood.\u201d He set the shake down with a smirk. \u201cI think.\u201d Olive picked up the next shake\u2014mint chip\u2014took a sip and handed it to Rory, so he could do the same. \u201cIf you know nothing about the YouTube world, this is all going to sound utterly crazy. But here goes. When I was thirteen, my parents started a YouTube channel. Meet the Cunninghams. They filmed me and my siblings doing everything, during most of our waking hours. Getting ready for school, eating in restaurants, making slime\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a thing.\u201d Knowing uncomfortable feelings were about to surround her like cloud cover, she swapped mint chip back for classic chocolate. \u201cPeople watch. Every day. They subscribe to our family.\u201d She ran her finger vertically through the fogged glass. \u201cBut it\u2019s the sitcom curse, you know? When kids hit a certain age, they kind of run their course. So the videos became mostly about my little brother and sister, Henderson and Pearl.\u201d She forced a smile onto her face. \u201cEight million subscribers at last count, though. That\u2019s\u2026really impressive.\u201d Rory had been sitting with the straw poised in front of his mouth for her entire explanation. \u201cYou said they filmed most of your waking hours. After they took you out of the picture, they kept filming your brother and sister?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cIf you weren\u2019t in the videos anymore, where did you go?\u201d Oh wow. She\u2019d severely underestimated what it would be like to tell someone out loud that she\u2019d essentially been fired from her own family for getting older. \u201cIn my room.\u201d She reached for the third shake\u2014ugh, pina colada? Really? \u201cI stayed out of the way.\u201d \u201cAnd they let you? They wanted that?\u201d Her silence served as an affirmative and Rory\u2019s outrage was palpable. \u201cThat\u2019s extremely fucked up, sunbeam.\u201d \u201cIt is, a little.\u201d She sipped the pina colada even though it was gross. \u201cMaybe a lot.\u201d He leaned in and pressed his lips to her cheek. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have done that to you. I met you fifteen minutes ago and I know you don\u2019t deserve that.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered, trying not to be obvious about inhaling shaving cream smell. \u201cThat must have been a while ago\u2026right?\u201d Rory asked, pulling back and narrowing his eyes. \u201cYou said you\u2019ve been here a week. Where were you before Long Beach?\u201d \u201cLiving with my parents.\u201d He set down the milkshake slowly. \u201cHold up, Olive. How old are you?\u201d Uh oh. Was this going to be an issue? \u201cEighteen.\u201d \u201cChrist.\u201d He dragged both hands down his face. \u201cThat\u2019s young.\u201d Olive reared back. \u201cI\u2019m renting my own apartment. My shower curtain matches my towels. There are serious adult decisions being made here.\u201d Her comeback earned her a quirked male smile and she couldn\u2019t help but return it. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d \u201cTwenty-four.\u201d He seemed to be chewing glass. \u201cHow do you have your own place at eighteen? Long Beach isn\u2019t cheap, especially in the summer time.\u201d She hesitated a moment. \u201cThe thing about eight million subscribers\u2026it means advertisers will pay a ton to run ads on your channel\u2026\u201d He leaned away. \u201cSo you\u2019re not only young and smart, you\u2019re a rich girl.\u201d \u201cHey, I earned it,\u201d she deadpanned. \u201cSliming ain\u2019t easy.\u201d \u201cOlive,\u201d he groaned. \u201cPlease stop being so fucking cute.\u201d Her stomach flipped. \u201cBecause you still want to walk away?\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to. You should be running toward something better.\u201d Rory\u2019s expression was the epitome of conflicted, but he was saved from having to elaborate when the bell dinged over the door and a girl Olive recognized walked into Mike\u2019s Shakes. She looked around at the ancient d\u00e9cor and made a face, hefting her backpack higher on her shoulders. When Leanne spotted her, she waved. Olive\u2019s arm felt like lead, but she managed to lift it and return the greeting. \u201cOh, um. My study date is here.\u201d Rory hadn\u2019t glanced once at the newcomer, continuing to study her face. \u201cI have to get to work, anyway.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d she murmured, reaching into her pocket for money. \u201cLet me help pay\u2014\u201d He caught her wrist. \u201cOn me, sunbeam.\u201d Leanne slid into the booth across from them slowly and Olive didn\u2019t even need to glance over to know her study partner was watching with rapt interest. \u201cH-hey Olive. I brought the Perspectives and Connections book you left in my car on Thursday.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d \u201cPerspectives and Connections,\u201d mouthed Rory with a wry twist of his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d Olive felt like she\u2019d walked into a sub-zero freezer as Rory rose from the booth and tossed some bills on the table. He took one long final look at her and moved in a slow swagger toward the exit. And she couldn\u2019t yell wait this time. Not if she wanted to maintain one ounce of self-respect. Instead, she turned in the booth and faced Leanne, trying desperately to swallow the lump in her throat. \u201cSo, um\u2026where did we leave off last time? I think it was the\u2014\u201d Rory appeared to her left. \u201cI left my phone at home. Write down your number,\u201d he said, pronouncing it numba. \u201cWho leaves their phone?\u201d Leanne mused, playing with her own device. But Olive barely heard her over the sudden palpitations happening in her chest. By some feat of willpower, she managed not to break into song. She signaled Leanne for a pen and wrote her cell number on a straw wrapper, sliding it toward Rory. \u201cAre you going to use it?\u201d He left without answering. Olive smiled through the entire study session. He\u2019d call. He\u2019d totally call. \n CHAPTER FOUR No way Rory could call her. If he called Olive, he\u2019d arrange a time to see her again. If he saw her again, once wouldn\u2019t be enough. Time had stood still from the moment he pulled her out of the bus\u2019s path, right up until he finally left Mike\u2019s Shakes with her number in his pocket. Everything had taken a back seat to what she said next, how she moved, smelled, laughed. He sat on a bench in the Hut\u2019s locker room now, staring down at the ripped straw wrapper, smoothing out the curled ends on his thigh. Around him, the locker room moved in ripples of animated color, the other lifeguards excited to kick off the summer season, already making plans to hit the boardwalk bars tonight. Lockers slammed, cell phones dinged, playful insults rang out. Meanwhile Rory was transfixed by ten digits on a narrow strip of white paper. She\u2019d drawn smiley faces in her zeroes, which was just further proof calling the number was a bad idea. And yet. If he hadn\u2019t left his phone at home, he would have already texted her. There had been an unusual tug in his gut the entire time and it was more than him being turned on. He\u2019d wanted to sit her in his lap and feed her milkshakes and find out what caused all her different smiles. The teasing one was his favorite by far. The one that challenged him to stop being so serious. Funny enough, serious wasn\u2019t Rory\u2019s thing. Definitely not when it came to women. He was a temporary thrill\u2014and it went both ways. Yet he\u2019d found himself\u2026exposed in front of Olive. More than once. And she\u2019d barely pushed. His guard had dropped itself before he knew what happened. Would he take back those moments if he could? No. No, he wouldn\u2019t change a single thing about that morning. An elbow caught him in the side and Rory lifted his head to find Jamie sitting beside him. How long had his brother been there? \u201cHey.\u201d Jamie eyeballed the straw wrapper. \u201cEventful walk to work?\u201d Rory sighed and dragged a hand through his hair. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d \u201cShe smiley faced her zeroes.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d They sat in silence for a moment. \u201cYou going to call her?\u201d Jamie prompted, beginning to dig through his backpack. Rory stood, dropped the phone number onto the top shelf of his open locker and stripping off his shirt. \u201cNope.\u201d \u201cThat sounds pretty definitive.\u201d \u201cHas to be.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d Off came the sweatpants, leaving Rory in his red, standard-issue lifeguard trunks. \u201cShe\u2019s eighteen.\u201d When Jamie winced, Rory made a sound of agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s only the beginning. She\u2019s a smart girl. College coming up. I\u2019m not going to let her waste time on me.\u201d Jamie\u2019s brows snapped together. \u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re not a waste of time, but you wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019ve done time.\u201d His chest knotted thinking of how she\u2019d react. Part of Rory wished he\u2019d told her, just so he wouldn\u2019t have to speculate forever what she might have said. \u201cIt was just a crazy, one-time thing. Nothing happened. We drank milkshakes.\u201d \u201cSince when do your crazy one-time things involve milkshakes?\u201d \u201cSince this morning, okay?\u201d Rory shot back, pounding a fist into his locker. \u201cDrop it.\u201d Jamie adopted his signature cocky pose. Arms crossed, expression bored. \u201cI\u2019ll drop it when you throw her number in the trash.\u201d Rory laughed and shook his head. \u201cYou prick.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t do it, can you?\u201d Not a hope in hell. \u201cWhy is this such a big deal to you?\u201d Jamie lost a degree of smugness. \u201cLook, we\u2019re all busy during the year. I\u2019m teaching, Andrew never leaves the bar.\u201d He shrugged a shoulder. \u201cWe see each other at home, but we\u2019re not around each other non-stop, like we are in the summer. And every time Memorial Day weekend rolls around, you\u2019re a little less\u2026optimistic. About yourself. About everything.\u201d The back of Rory\u2019s neck pinched tight and he rolled the muscles to loosen them. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re an economics teacher and not a counselor?\u201d \u201cPositive. How well do you think I\u2019d handle adolescent feelings?\u201d \u201cNot well.\u201d \u201cNo shit.\u201d Jamie tipped his chin toward the top shelf of Rory\u2019s locker. \u201cAnd speaking of adolescents.\u201d \u201cFuck you.\u201d His brother grinned, but it was short lived. \u201cYou said she\u2019s smart?\u201d Rory swallowed and snatched the whistle out of his locker, dropping it over his head. \u201cYeah,\u201d he rasped. \u201cThen she had a reason for sliding you her digits. Maybe give her a little more credit.\u201d He considered Jamie\u2019s words for all of a second before disregarding them. \u201cYou can be smart and still be na\u00efve. I\u2019m doing her a favor.\u201d His fingers paused in the process of engaging his Master lock. \u201cI\u2019m sitting there talking to her and my fucking eye is killing me from last night. I\u2019m wondering if she smells the vodka coming out of my pores. And she\u2019s so\u2026fresh. And better. The waiter looks at me sideways this morning and I can\u2019t\u2014I couldn\u2019t stop myself from getting pissed. Showing her exactly what I am. It wouldn\u2019t work, Jamie.\u201d A vision of Olive pushing up her glasses drifted into his conscience and stung him. \u201cWe only spent an hour together and I know it\u2019s crazy, but if I went out with her, I\u2019d want her to be\u2026mine. Think about that. Some fucking ex-con locking down this young girl with a successful future her first summer out of her parents\u2019 house. No matter how you slice it, I end up the villain. I don\u2019t want to be her villain.\u201d Jamie opened his mouth to respond, but he was interrupted by the door to the Hut flying open and rebounding off a row of lockers with an earsplitting rattle. \u201cI\u2019m here, cocksuckers.\u201d Marcus \u201cDiesel\u201d O\u2019Shaughnessy stood outlined in the doorway. All shirtless, six foot five inches of him. He swaggered into the Hut, stopping to high-five lifeguards and show off the new naked lady tattoo on his arm to everyone he passed. \u201cFor chrissakes,\u201d Jamie muttered. \u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten about this asshole.\u201d \u201cNope. Turns up every year like a bad penny.\u201d Rory slid his brother a side glance. \u201cYou let me know if he says something stupid to you, all right?\u201d A muscle flexed in Jamie\u2019s cheek. \u201cHe\u2019s a loudmouth, but he\u2019s mostly harmless.\u201d He shoved Rory off balance with his shoulder. \u201cYou have to stop fighting my battles for me\u2014we know how that ends.\u201d Jamie gave him a pointed look. \u201cI can fight them myself.\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d Rory let the subtle reminder of his incarceration roll off his shoulder. \u201cYou going to smother him with your book collection?\u201d Jamie let his locker door swing open, revealing a neat row of novels. \u201cI came prepared.\u201d Rory was still shaking his head when Marcus reached them, rolling to a stop like a goddamn tank and wrapping an arm around Jamie\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAhhh, and who\u2019s this hiding over here? How the hell are you, Jamie Prince?\u201d He only laughed when Jamie muttered \u201cplease fuck off\u201d under his breath. \u201cCome on, man. I know you missed me.\u201d He let go of Jamie, stepped back and flexed, creating the human version of a field goal. \u201cWhere else do you get quality eye candy like this? It\u2019s got to be amazing for you to have me around.\u201d Jamie blew out at breath at the ceiling. \u201cMarcus, don\u2019t make me suggest the quiet game this early in the summer.\u201d Marcus pointed at him and grinned. \u201cI\u2019m going to win this time.\u201d \u201cYou never win.\u201d Even though he was trying to heed Jamie\u2019s request to back off, Rory couldn\u2019t help listening carefully to every word that came out of Marcus\u2019s mouth, waiting for him to slip up and say something out of line. This kind of needling was par for the course with the oversized gym rat. He had a big mouth\u2014and for some strange reason, he was always running it around Jamie. If it was anyone else giving Jamie a hard time, Rory wouldn\u2019t be able to stop himself from stepping in, but Marcus genuinely seemed to like Jamie, though they were exact opposites. Insinuating that Jamie must be thrilled to ogle him, on account of Jamie being gay, was a bad assumption. And kind of offensive. Except it had become obvious over the course of several summers that Marcus had no clue his bullshit came off as rude. Still, why Jamie tolerated it, Rory had no idea. \u201cI have some great news for you, Jamie Prince,\u201d Marcus continued, stripping off his sweatpants and tossing them haphazardly into his open locker. \u201cAndrew hired me as security at the Castle Gate this summer. To check IDs and shit. I\u2019m a bouncer now, son.\u201d \u201cAnd today in self-fulfilling prophecies\u2026\u201d Jamie muttered. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be away from me a single second.\u201d Marcus pulled his red lifeguard shorts on over his briefs, not-too-subtly adjusting his junk. \u201cLucky you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m ecstatic,\u201d Jamie deadpanned, looping his whistle around his head. \u201cI\u2019m heading to my chair.\u201d \u201cHold on, I\u2019ll walk with you,\u201d Marcus said, rushing to grab his gear. \u201cI need some, ah\u2026practice. Acting as a security guard.\u201d Rory couldn\u2019t help but laugh as Jamie staunchly ignored Marcus and bee-lined for the exit, forcing Marcus to lope after him in one flip-flop, the other in his gargantuan paw. Now that Rory was alone, the straw wrapper almost glowed from its position on the top shelf of his locker. Closing the door and leaving it there felt symbolic. That\u2019s exactly what needed to be done with Olive. He needed to shut the door on the connection they\u2019d made this morning and leave this funny, fresh-faced girl with a future alone. No calling her. No dating her. No searching out her face on the beach. He didn\u2019t expect her to search him out instead. In the most unconventional way. \n CHAPTER FIVE Olive heaved a satisfied breath when she saw an open spot on the beach. Memorial Day weekend in Long Beach was pure insanity, and she thanked God her apartment was close enough to walk. Cars were in a dead gridlock around the town, parking spots being fought over like dogs with a bone. Frankly, the atmosphere of competitive relaxation was kind of intimidating, but she hadn\u2019t been to the actual beach since moving in, and the incredible weather demanded she leave her studying behind and bask in the sunshine. It was Saturday, a perfectly acceptable day to be selfish. She would make up for neglecting her school work later and she\u2019d have tan lines as a bonus. I have great news. No one studies during the summertime. Rory\u2019s voice drifted down from the blue sky and she sighed. Since meeting him yesterday, snippets of their conversation seemed to find her at the oddest times. Like when she was using her vibrator on the highest setting last night and remembered him saying, Jesus Christ. Barely touched you. Wonder what that body would do if I got my hands and mouth on it? See? The oddest times. Olive snuck into the sliver of space and plunked down her beach bag. She rolled out her favorite towel, which was a headshot of Sigmund Freud above the words \u201cYour Mom.\u201d After making sure there wasn\u2019t a single wrinkle in the towel, she sat down in the very center and applied sunscreen\u2026beneath her cover up. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t like her boobs. It was that she hated her boobs. And even though she knew logically no one on the beach would pay them any attention, as soon as she removed the gauzy white top that skimmed her thighs, her brain would lie to her, whispering that everyone was staring at her rack. Thanks to homeschooling, she\u2019d never been forced to walk down a high school hallway full of peers with her body\u2019s changes on display. Once when Olive was fifteen, however, a neighborhood guy her age had been helping his mother carry groceries into the house. When he saw Olive waving across the street, he held two cantaloupes in front of his chest and called, \u201cHey, look. It\u2019s Olive and her huge knockers.\u201d She\u2019d gone inside immediately and performed enough Internet research to know that her bust was above average in size and was properly horrified. And without her mother to confide in about her self-consciousness, she\u2019d remained in that state for roughly three years. Now here she was, about to unveil her melons to the masses. Maybe she should have stayed home with her books. They were her solace\u2014and that\u2019s why she studied during the summertime and took bonus classes. She enjoyed it. When her parents asked her to take a step back from Meet the Cunninghams, she\u2019d needed a distraction from the hurt. School work had been the easiest way to continue being productive without a camera on her. Not to mention, she\u2019d had an ulterior motive in focusing on her grades. She\u2019d hoped to win back her parents\u2019 approval, but in the midst of YouTube glory, it had only been fleeting. Keep up the good work, Olive. Then back to their regularly scheduled program. Words on the page was where she snuggled up at night, whether they told tales of historical events, mathematics or dystopian futures with romance thrown in for good measure. She loved all of the words. Every single one. During her senior year of high school, she\u2019d taken psychology as an elective and found herself fascinated by the different philosophies of thought. She\u2019d had so many feelings about being placed in the opposite corner than her family, giving those feelings a more scientific term, such as separation anxiety had helped. She wasn\u2019t just lonely, she was having the appropriate emotional response to isolation. It was right there in her textbooks and it helped to give that emptiness a name. Applying for colleges and choosing psych as her major had been a no-brainer. Why wouldn\u2019t she want to help others deal with the same issues in the future? In the meantime, she would continue to deal with them herself. She was still far from overcoming them. Up until now, Olive had somehow managed to avoid looking at the closest lifeguard tower, but she did so now\u2014and deflated when the guy sitting in the chair didn\u2019t even resemble Rory a little bit. Although she wasn\u2019t sure if it was in relief or disappointment. There was one thing she did know. She wasn\u2019t going to sit around waiting for him to call. Or replaying their morning together and wondering if she could have done something differently. For years, she\u2019d played that what if game with her family and it was a new day. A new day of matching shower curtains and towels, dammit. That burst of pride turned out to be exactly what Olive needed to remove her cover-up. She whipped it off and stuffed it into her beach bag. There. Done. She\u2019d inflicted her breasts on the beach and they\u2019d just have to deal. Tan lines or bust. Olive placed her glasses carefully in her bag\u2019s front pocket and flopped down on her back, dug her heels into the granules of sand and cleared her mind of insecurities and what ifs, letting the sun\u2019s heat bake them away. Salsa music reached her ears from one side, rap music from the other. The beach goers were jovial, calling to each other, their voices dripping with Long Island. Kids squealed down at the water line and occasionally kicked sand onto Olive as they ran past. The chaos somehow took place around her without involving her, though, leaving her to bask in anonymity, the heat nearly putting her to sleep. She wasn\u2019t sure what caused her eyes to pop open. Or what caused a pinwheel to roll down her spine. Something made her sit up, though, fanning herself with a hand to cool her sun-warmed skin. Without fail, her attention drifted to the lifeguard station\u2014and there he was. Rory leaned forward in the elevated chair, his hands clasped loosely between his knees, watching her behind a pair of black sunglasses. Yes, there was no doubt he watched her, a muscle ticking in his cheek. The tattoos hadn\u2019t been fully visible the day before, but they were on full display now, hugging big portions of his skin like spiderwebs. And Olive might as well have been naked for the awareness that crept over her, lifting goose bumps down the length of her arms, making her thighs feel like gelatin, all the way up to her sex. When had he gotten there? How long had he been watching her? How did he reach out and touch her from thirty yards away? Olive turned back around to face the water, forcing her fingers to stop clutching the sides of the towel. He hadn\u2019t even waved. Or smiled. He almost looked mad at her, which made no sense, since he\u2019d been the one to not call. What would a cool, calm and collected adult with a new Bed Bath & Beyond credit card do in this situation? Olive had no clue, but if she sat there much longer, she was going to melt under his close scrutiny. Reminding herself that no one cared about her boobs, Olive stood up, wincing when she had no choice to dust some stray sand off her butt, and walked casually toward the water. Really, she\u2019d been planning to go for a swim at some point. She\u2019d never even dipped a toe into the Atlantic Ocean, so now was a good a time as any. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she croaked when icy cold water rushed up her ankles and licked at her knees. \u201cIt\u2019s eighty degrees. Shouldn\u2019t you be warm?\u201d There was no choice but to wade in farther after coming this far. It hurt, though. She wanted to be back on top of Sigmund Freud cultivating a tan, not courting hypothermia. Olive heard her whining conscience and frowned at the horizon. She\u2019d left the comfort of her parents\u2019 mini-mansion\u2014complete with heated pool\u2014to make a real change. They could cast her aside in the name of Internet fame, but she\u2019d made the decision to leave Oklahoma for New York. She\u2019d taken control of the separation this time, so they couldn\u2019t do it for her. Now that she was on her own in this big, unfamiliar place, she wouldn\u2019t stay stuck in a bedroom listening to life take place on the other side of her door. She took a deep breath, whimpered under her breath, and let her body drop beneath the surface of the water. It covered her head with a rushing foam gurgle, before the world around her turned muted. Bluish green pushed against her lids, allowing her to see the color even with her eyes closed. It was such a glorious and beautiful rush, she forgot to be cold. When she emerged from the surface again, she couldn\u2019t contain the laugh that bubbled up in her throat. Totally worth leaving her books to gather dust for the afternoon. Kids on top of boogie boards were carried toward the shore by waves. They were probably half her age, so she had zero reservations about freestyle swimming farther into the murky blue, letting the sounds of the shore recede, stopping only when her feet could no longer touch sand. After a few minutes of letting herself drift, she decided to swim back to shore, march right up to Rory and\u2026force him into a pleasant conversation. Yup. That would show him. He might have lamented their age gap, but she\u2019d prove being young didn\u2019t amount to being immature. With that plan in mind, Olive let a wave crest over her and started to kick. She couldn\u2019t seem to make any progress toward shore, though. Her position never changed, only shifting her sideways\u2026or farther out. Was she drifting farther out? That\u2019s when she heard a whistle pierce the afternoon air\u2014and she knew it was for her. \u201cOh God. No, no, no\u2026this isn\u2019t happening.\u201d She swam as hard as she could, losing steam after about ten seconds and attempting to reach the bottom of the ocean floor with her toes. She didn\u2019t even scrape it. She did, however, become very aware of a separate current running down near her feet. Undertow. Unbelievable. She\u2019d gotten stuck in an undertow. A wave broke over Olive\u2019s head, but not before she made out the blurry figure cutting toward her in the water at a fast clip, a red flotation device dragging along the surface behind him. Her lack of glasses prevented her from making out exact details\u2014and then she couldn\u2019t see anything. A healthy dose of water was sucked up through her nose when she tried to breathe. Panic made her flail, even though she knew it would burn energy. She couldn\u2019t stop. Couldn\u2019t stop trying to remain on the surface where the oxygen lived. I\u2019m drowning. I\u2019m going to drown. Why did I leave my books? They\u2019ve been so good to me. An arm wrapped around her chest and she instinctively tried to fight the restriction, thinking it would drag her farther down. She twisted, her vision nothing but blurred blues and greens, fear roaring in her ears. \u201cI\u2019ve got you, sunbeam. Easy. I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d The imploring voice near her ear ceased her struggles immediately. Rory. That\u2019s right. It was Rory, not some angry sea monster hell bent on drowning her. Within seconds, he had her face up, the flotation device pressed securely to her chest. \u201cHold onto this while I get you back to shore. Wrap your arms around it. Good girl.\u201d Was it her imagination or did he brush a kiss over her hair? \u201cGoddammit,\u201d he rasped, starting to swim. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me whistling? You just kept\u2026I saw you go under\u2026\u201d If Olive wasn\u2019t totally spent after battling the sea gods, she would have said something to comfort Rory. He sounded so upset. But coming down from her adrenaline surge and landing in a pile of relief made her almost drowsy, so she could only listen, realizing absently that Rory had been required to save her life twice in twenty-four hours. How humiliating. Even more embarrassing was how fast they reached the shore after she\u2019d been unable to swim an inch in the same direction. Her feet slid backward in the sand and then she was hoisted into Rory\u2019s arms, the top of her head finding a home under his chin without conscious thought. They were surrounded by an applauding crowd as Rory walked them up the beach, and the tension in his shoulders told Olive he didn\u2019t like the attention they were getting. \u201cTalk to me,\u201d he said, leaning down to search her eyes. \u201cI got to you in time. Right? Look, I just really need you to talk to me.\u201d Which one of them was shaking? \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just cold.\u201d \u201cCold. Okay.\u201d Seeming relieved that he had a problem to work on, Rory picked up the pace to a stride, leaving their audience in the dust. Water dripped off the ends of his hair and coasted down his shoulder, chest, jaw, dripping onto Olive, but she didn\u2019t mind it one bit, because a couple of drips was easily better than a whole ocean. Also the droplets had been warmed on Rory\u2019s skin before landing on hers and there was something grounding about that. Like he was resuscitating her without trying. His worried expression drifted in and out of the sunlight, keeping his face mostly in the shadows, but occasionally she would get a peek at the set jaw, downward slashing eyebrows. He was on a mission to take her somewhere, but until he unlocked a door and carried her inside a dark locker room, she didn\u2019t speculate on where. \u201cThis is the Hut,\u201d he murmured, adjusting his hold to bring Olive tighter against his chest as they passed through long rows of lockers, a slim, wooden bench running down the middle. \u201cI\u2019m going to catch hell for leaving the beach, but I just need to get you warmed up, sunbeam. You won\u2019t stop shaking.\u201d \u201cYou either.\u201d She heard him swallow. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Olive decided to let him get away with the lie. \u201cYou weren\u2019t on duty when I got to the beach. Where did you come from?\u201d Rory didn\u2019t answer as they passed beneath an arch into another room, separate from the locker area. And darker. He eased her feet to a tile floor. Before she could look around to discern their new location, Rory steadied her with his left hand and punched something above her head with his right\u2014and holy blessed warm water went streaming down her head, shoulders and back, shocking her chilled skin with blissful heat. She backed further into what could only be a shower and Rory followed, his grip reassuring on her elbow. \u201cOhhhh.\u201d Her neck loosened, head tipping to one side. \u201cThat\u2019s perfect. Totally worth almost drowning for.\u201d \u201cAgree to disagree,\u201d came his low voice from the other side of the spray. Olive peeked around the stream of water to find Rory battling concern\u2026and something darker. Hotter. His inked chest lifted and fell in a staggered rhythm, steam from the shower dappling him with condensation. \u201cAre you warmed up?\u201d His gravelly tone of voice turned Olive\u2019s nipples to painful points. I\u2019m wearing a bathing suit. No cover-up. Nothing. Her arms flew up to cross over her breasts, but that only pushed them up more, so she dropped her hands to their original position. \u201cDid everyone see my boobs?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d His gaze sharpened and snapped to hers. \u201cNo. No one saw any part of you they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d He dragged a hand over his eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019m seeing way too damn much right now, Olive. Are you warmed up?\u201d The word yes sprung to her lips, but no sound came out. She was alone in a dark shower with a man who\u2019d stirred something to life inside of her. Something that made her feel\u2026older. Feminine. She\u2019d had crushes on neighborhood boys in the past and swore she\u2019d experienced attraction. Nope. Nothing in her life had come close to the yearning that crawled all over her now, wreaking discomfort and emptiness in places she didn\u2019t know such things were possible. And God. God, it didn\u2019t help that Rory was absolutely gorgeous with his wet hair and cords of tan muscles, topped with tattoos so stark, they seemed freshly painted. That wasn\u2019t what made her ache, though. No, his eyes did that. They betrayed how aware he was of Olive. That this gravitational force between them was not typical. It wasn\u2019t typical at all. She could no more say the words, \u201cYes, I\u2019m warmer now,\u201d than she could go about the rest of her day without drawing Rory closer. Finding some way to touch him. Be touched. Because if she said those words, they would leave this place. He\u2019d put an end to this thing between them that he\u2019d obviously deemed wrong. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d Operating on their own terms, her fingertips traced the edge of her bikini bottoms. Rory\u2019s eyes tracked their progress like a hunter, a violent shudder passing through him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to call me. You\u2019re just going to be my personal rescue service?\u201d Restless hands flexed at his sides. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to answer that, Olive.\u201d \u201cTry.\u201d A beat passed. His nostrils flared. \u201cI made it through a day without calling you. I was trying to make it through another\u2026and then I saw you in front of someone else\u2019s chair, looking like a fuck fantasy that has no place in my head\u2014\u201d He cut himself off with a sharp exhale. \u201cSo I switched. I switched so I could be near you. I couldn\u2019t help wanting to be near you.\u201d Fuck fantasy. Fuck fantasy. The words pinged around in her head like hailstones off a window. \u201cI picked this bathing suit specifically for its modesty.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t work.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d Olive didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d stepped back until her shoulder blades pressed to the steam-covered tile wall and she nearly moaned at the sensation of something\u2014anything\u2014touching her skin. The hard surface made her feel provocative. Trapped. She wanted to be trapped between the tile and Rory. \u201cWill you just come here?\u201d she whispered. A scrape of a sound left his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can stop touching you once I start. I don\u2019t know anything when it comes to you.\u201d The running water sluicing down from above sent wet hair into her face, obscuring her vision, so she pushed it back, let the damp warmth run over her lips. \u201cPlease?\u201d Rory lunged, growling, stopping just short of making contact. His hands slapped the tile above her head, his chest heaving. And then his mouth gave the barest brush of her temple and Olive almost collapsed under the rush of bliss, unable to trap her moan this time. \u201cCome on, Olive,\u201d he said choppily. \u201cBarely touching you and that body reacts like I\u2019m giving it that first hard thrust. You\u2019re killing me here.\u201d Trying to think clearly with a new, unfamiliar motor running deep within her body was a challenge, but Olive sensed she had to lure Rory closer. He was still managing to hold himself away from her and she wanted to snap that willpower in half. With a swallow, she settled the palms of her hands against Rory\u2019s hard stomach and slid them over the muscular curve of his pectorals. \u201cThank you for saving me.\u201d His eyelids drooped, his rough exhale sending the shower steam into a swirl. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me. Just stop almost dying.\u201d He appeared transfixed by her fingers as they splayed over his muscles. \u201cPlease?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll think about it\u2026\u201d Slowly, she went up on her tiptoes and locked her wrists behind his neck. \u201cIf you kiss me.\u201d He advanced on her fast, ripping a gasp from her throat when he sandwiched her between his unyielding body and the tile wall. Oh my God. Every inch of him was created to correspond with every inch of her. Was that possible? \u201cYou think I\u2019m the kind of man you play games with?\u201d His hot puffs of breath fanned her mouth. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me.\u201d \u201cTell me. After you kiss me.\u201d His laughter was harsh and lacking all humor. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to take what you\u2019re offering, Olive. I\u2019ll want more. I won\u2019t be able to stay away from you.\u201d Out of necessity, Olive pushed up and slid their lips together, making his body surge tighter against hers. \u201cThis new life of yours is only beginning, and mine\u2026it never got started, all right? Don\u2019t torture me,\u201d he grated directly against her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re torturing me,\u201d she said breathily, beginning to grow frustrated with the lack of satisfaction. She needed it so badly without even knowing fully what it entailed. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about you.\u201d \u201cStop.\u201d He kissed her. Hard. \u201cStop.\u201d What had been the purpose of Olive\u2019s mouth until this moment? As soon as her lips met Rory\u2019s, they were given a new reason for existing. Despite his harsh command, there was no stopping once the kiss started. Olive was flattened against the wall, Rory\u2019s fingers diving into her hair, weaving the wet strands between them. Olive\u2019s arms went limp, dropping from his hair and remaining kind of suspended in a mid-air surrender as Rory\u2019s mouth moved over hers, mastering it, ruining her for any other kiss in this lifetime. And then she could only use her hands to pull him close. Closer. Closer. Oh God, she couldn\u2019t get him to press her into the wall tightly enough. Her body was crying out for something she didn\u2019t know how to ask for. Couldn\u2019t ask for. Not with his tongue taking blatant, sexual ownership of her mouth. He found her tongue and wound it with his own, the bristle of his beard scraping her chin. Water trickled down between them, making the kiss wetter than it already was. Olive curled her fingers into the waistband of his red shorts, arching her lower body and pulling Rory closer at the same time. Give me what I need. What do I need? At the same time she felt his erection, long and thick against her belly, his mouth let hers go on a guttural groan. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d He teased her upper lip with his tongue. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it unless you say it by name.\u201d \u201cI-I\u2026don\u2019t know. I just want to stop aching.\u201d They fell headlong into a moaning kiss. \u201cI want that, too, sunbeam.\u201d His right hand left her hair, his palm curving to the side of her neck, traveling lower. Lower. \u201cCan I touch you?\u201d Their eyes locked and she couldn\u2019t look away from his combination of hunger and vulnerability. As if she might say no. Or not trust him. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnywhere.\u201d Heat flared in Rory\u2019s face, but he hesitated, shaking his head. \u201cGod help us both,\u201d he muttered, his hands finding her breasts and palming them. Tightly. Like they belonged to him. A line of electricity started at her nipples and rippled to her sex, making Olive\u2019s thighs smack together with a loud sound. \u201cThere it is,\u201d Rory said, cursing. \u201cBeen dreaming about those legs snapping together around my hips. Just like that.\u201d Later she might worry about coming across desperate, but in that moment, she could only care about making Rory\u2019s words a reality. God. Oh God, she needed pressure against that suffering part of her anatomy. Now. She gripped his shoulders and tried to climb his hard wall of muscle, but he peeled her off with a denial, using his left hand to trap her wrists above her head. A willing prisoner. \u201cUh-uh. No,\u201d he gritted, pressing their foreheads together. \u201cNot unless you want to fuck, Olive. If you sit that ripe, little body on my cock, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d The walls of her femininity clenched. Clenched at being spoken to\u2014about\u2014in such a way. To be desired this way\u2026to have the proof of her own appeal prodding her in the stomach was a powerful thing. Especially because his appeal was equally vast. The feel of his skin, the intensity of his eyes, the smell of sunscreen and mint and male. A streak of recklessness she\u2019d never encountered spoke on her behalf. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want. The ache\u2026\u201d A heavy shudder moved through Rory, and since they were plastered together, it vibrated her body along with his. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d he said thickly, his right hand dropping, slowly cupping her sex and pressing, pressing, grinding his palm against it, drawing a shocked sob from Olive. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had a man anywhere near this, have you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she gasped. \u201cFuck.\u201d He pressed his middle finger to her clit, massaging her through the wet material of her bikini bottoms. \u201cTaking this for myself will earn me a place in hell.\u201d \u201cNo it won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not happening,\u201d Rory cut in harshly, quieting her with a hard kiss. \u201cI can take away the ache other ways.\u201d Olive\u2019s knees weakened as Rory knelt down on the tile floor, the spray rushing over his head as he leaned in, exhaling against the triangle of her bottoms once, twice, before tugging them down to her ankles, devouring the sight of her. \u201cSon of a bitch. It\u2019s as beautiful as the rest of you,\u201d he rasped, pressing his mouth and nose to her intimate flesh, breathing her in. \u201cLast chance, Olive. Tell me I shouldn\u2019t lick your virgin pussy, baby, please.\u201d Yeah right. She\u2019d been fantasizing for a long time about having sex, introduced to every aspect of intimacy through books. Even on the page, this kind of foreplay had never really appealed to her. Obviously, she\u2019d been shortsighted since she was practically restraining herself from climbing onto his shoulders. Anything to stop the incessant flames from licking her skin. To stop the churn of frustration inside of her, begging for relief. \u201cRory.\u201d She slipped her fingers into his hair and guided him closer. \u201cI need you.\u201d \u201cYou had to say that.\u201d He pushed his closed mouth up against her softness, his big shoulders lifting and falling on a groan, then his lips began moving in the open-mouthed writhe of a kiss, the action shifting the flesh shielding her core, easing the sides apart, exposing her clit. His upper lip grazed her nub gently, and Olive almost hit the ceiling. Her reaction seemed to drive Rory a little crazy, his fingertips digging into her hips, yanking her lower body closer to his mouth. The hard, slick glide of his tongue separated her flesh further and journeyed over her clit in a slow, deliberate lick. \u201cGoddamn, you taste so fucking sweet. You going to melt on my tongue like a good girl, Olive?\u201d \u201cYes. Yes.\u201d \u201cYou make sure to tell me when you\u2019re going to come.\u201d He razed the inside of her thigh with his teeth, then returned to her private flesh, parting her with another thorough lick. \u201cI want to lap up as much as I can before the shower washes it away.\u201d Olive\u2019s head tipped back on its own, her back arching away from the wall. \u201cOh my God. O-okay. Okay. Oh my God.\u201d Rory formed a V with his fingers, holding her flesh open\u2014and spent a full minute flicking his tongue against her clit without pause or mercy. All the while, Olive babbled begging words, a scream building in her chest, until she finally let it loose. \u201cRory,\u201d she whimpered, growing desperate, the sound of her physical distress still echoing off the walls. \u201cI\u2019m going t-to\u2026\u201d He took his tongue away but used the pad of his thumb to tease her swollen bundle of nerves, never stopping, never letting up. She watched beneath heavy lids as his licked a path straight up the center of her belly, closing his teeth around the string that connected the triangles of her bikini, nudging them aside. They went easily, since her breasts had essentially heaved themselves halfway to freedom. And the shower pelted his head, coasting down her body as Rory closed his mouth around her nipples, groaning as he sucked them, his fingers masterful between her thighs. \u201cThese tits,\u201d he growled, licking across to her other breast. \u201cMade me hard clear across the beach.\u201d Olive\u2019s stomach shuddered, her vision beginning to blur, tension creeping, coiling in her mid-section. \u201cI hate them,\u201d she managed, her legs trembling. \u201cOr I used to? They seem good to go right now\u2014oh.\u201d Rory grazed her nipples with his teeth, and a string pulled taut deep inside of her. She begged him in gibberish to do it again, but his mouth was already journeying back downward, replacing his fingers to suckle her clit gently\u2014and Olive saw stars. That gathering pressure beneath her navel gave way like a collapsing cliff and she tasted blood in her mouth, courtesy of attempting to trap her scream of his name. It got loose anyway, bouncing off the walls and sounding nothing like her. She pressed her hips closer to Rory\u2019s mouth and writhed on his giving tongue, the orgasm gripping her like an iron fist, squeezing, squeezing, her inner walls bearing down, searching for more. \u201cInside me,\u201d she sobbed, meaning it that moment with every fiber or her being. \u201cRory, I-I think I need you inside me.\u201d He made a choked noise and stood, pressing their mouths together and they panted for heavy moments, the steam curling around them. \u201cShhh.\u201d His right hand cupped the juncture of her thighs, massaging it gently with his roughened palm. \u201cEasy, sunbeam. Easy. We can\u2019t go there.\u201d Her thighs tightened around his hand and they groaned into a kiss, the waves of pleasure continuing to coast over her, wracking her with tremors. \u201cGoddammit, I\u2019m not going to survive you,\u201d he muttered thickly against her mouth. \u201cI just have to make sure you survive me, okay? Help me do that.\u201d Finally, the shaking lessened and Olive slumped into Rory\u2019s welcoming arms. She could feel his long erection between them, trapped by the wet material of his shorts, but every time she tried to reach for it, he caught her wrists and distracted her with kisses\u2026until she was incapable of focusing on anything but the give and take of his tongue, the gruff sounds he made in his throat, the hands that smoothed down her hips, tracing the curve of her waist\u2014 A door crashed open somewhere out in the locker room. Rory tensed and pulled away, visibly struggling to become alert, his breathing labored, pupils dilated. His hands shook as he covered her breasts with the bathing suit top and dragged the bottoms back up her legs. Fighting through her lethargy, Olive reached back and turned off the shower in an attempt to be useful, a veil of silence dropping around them, save their heavy breathing. \u201cHe\u2019s too unpredictable,\u201d came a weary male voice from the other room. \u201cI can\u2019t afford him anymore.\u201d A curse. \u201cHe\u2019s not even answering his phone.\u201d A lightly accented female voice responded. \u201cThere has to be an explanation. He\u2019s never just left the beach before, has he?\u201d \u201cNo, but it was only a matter of time. We\u2019re talking about the guy who started a bar fight last summer because a customer snapped to get his attention.\u201d the male voice answered. \u201cOr the time he just didn\u2019t show up at all and called me from a holding cell? I can\u2019t make allowances anymore. If someone were to get hurt or worse while his chair is sitting vacant, I could lose the lifeguarding contract with the town.\u201d Olive didn\u2019t register that the man was talking about Rory until she noticed the distance in his gaze, the hard line of his jaw. \u201cStay here,\u201d he murmured, backing away from her. Olive could only watch in silence as Rory sauntered into the locker room, still dripping from their shower. \u201cYou can stop calling me, Andrew. I\u2019m right here.\u201d A beat passed. \u201cWhere the hell did you go?\u201d \u201cHad to take care of something.\u201d He propped a hand on the archway. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to make allowances for me anymore, just say the word.\u201d \u201cAnd you\u2019d be fine with that.\u201d Andrew\u2019s voice was flat. \u201cJust abandoning ship and leaving me and Jamie to hold everything down?\u201d \u201cJust trying to give you what you want,\u201d Rory shot back, the muscle patterns shifting on his broad back. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t get choices, I get marching orders. Would that work for you?\u201d \u201cYou think I do this by choice?\u201d There was something written in between the lines of Andrew\u2019s incredulity. \u201cWe both know I don\u2019t.\u201d Olive couldn\u2019t resist a step forward to peek at the newcomers. She\u2019d barely managed to see around Rory\u2019s elbow when she locked eyes with the woman. A gorgeous young woman with an apron tied around her waist, her long, dark hair in a braid. Her eyes widened when she saw Olive, but instead of drawing attention to her presence in the shower, the woman snagged a towel from a stack near the lockers and oh-so-casually sidestepped in Olive\u2019s direction, holding it out. Olive took the offering with a whispered thank you, deciding they were going to be friends. They didn\u2019t get away with their covert mission, however. \u201cIs someone in there with you?\u201d Andrew asked. Rory blocked her more completely. \u201cThat\u2019s my business.\u201d \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Rory.\u201d It had taken Olive a minute to regain her wits and process the conversation. Now that she\u2019d come back down to earth, the reality of the situation was hitting home. Rory was in trouble for leaving the beach with her. Was he getting fired? She couldn\u2019t let him lose his job because she\u2019d kept him from it. The guilt would kill her. Not to mention, he was incredible at being a lifeguard. Hadn\u2019t he just proven that? Who did this guy Andrew think he was? Olive wrapped the towel around her shoulders and marched out of the shower. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d She lost a little steam at the sight of Andrew, who was easily the second-hottest man she\u2019d ever witnessed up close, right behind Rory\u2014Rory, who tried to block her from view. Olive dodged him. \u201cThis man just saved my life. He was heroic,\u201d she sputtered. \u201cI would have drowned if he hadn\u2019t reached me in time. It\u2019s my fault he left the beach. I was freezing to death and\u2026pretty scared, okay? If you\u2019re going to blame someone, blame me.\u201d Andrew crossed his arms over his chest and regarded her with curiosity. \u201cYou are aware that rescuing someone doesn\u2019t involve a complimentary shower, right?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Rory said quietly, his hands flexing in a dangerous way that Olive now recognized. \u201cDo not question her, Andrew. I\u2019m warning you.\u201d Oddly, Rory\u2019s threat seemed to drain some of Andrew\u2019s irritation. He split a look between Rory and Olive, a groove forming between his eyebrows. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you men talk about this at home?\u201d The woman gave Andrew a pointed look. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve all calmed down a little.\u201d When no one said anything, she rolled her eyes and approached Olive with a hand extended. \u201cI\u2019m Jiya. I had the misfortune of moving in next door to these stubborn Irish mules.\u201d Olive couldn\u2019t help her smile as they shook. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d She glanced up at Rory to find his expression shuttered. \u201cAre you brothers?\u201d He gave a tight nod. \u201cThis is Andrew.\u201d \u201cAnd you are\u2026\u201d his brother prompted. \u201cOlive.\u201d She rolled her lips together in the following silence. \u201cI should head home so Rory can get back to work.\u201d Andrew nodded curtly. \u201cI\u2019ve only got his chair covered for the next half hour.\u201d \u201cPerfect. That\u2019s enough time to get her home alive.\u201d Rory bent to one side and picked up her beach bag, which she had no recollection of retrieving from the beach. When she saw her glasses and the Freud towel stuffed inside, she almost kissed Rory full on the mouth. Until he said, \u201cShe has a habit of tempting death.\u201d Her sniff of protest hung in the air as Rory threaded their fingers together and pulled her toward his locker. He set down the beach bag on the bench and replaced the glasses on her nose with a look of concentration. With a few twists of his wrists, he sprung the metal teeth of his locker, reached inside and took out a gray T-shirt, dropping it over her head. But not before a piece of white paper fluttered to the ground between them. It was the straw wrapper with her number on it. Forgetting all about their audience, Olive beamed up at Rory as he pulled her hands through the arm holes of the massive shirt. With her heart in her throat, she watched him stoop down to pick up the straw wrapper and place it carefully back on the shelf, like it was a priceless artifact. Then, seeming to realize how telling the action was, he slapped the locker shut and guided her toward the exit. \u201cI, uh\u2026forget that was in there.\u201d \u201cRory?\u201d \u201cWhat, sunbeam?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d \n CHAPTER SIX Rory was going to drop Olive off and get the hell away. That\u2019s what he should have done after pulling her out of the water. Wrapped her in a towel and radioed one of the female lifeguards to bring her somewhere warm. Or called one of her friends to come pick her up. He never should have brought her into the Hut\u2014into their own private world where none of the consequences of touching her existed. Where the weight of his past and the shine of her future were blurred by the steam. Even now, knowing he shouldn\u2019t, Rory couldn\u2019t keep himself from holding her hand. It made him feel like a fucking giant walking down the street, having this girl beside him. And yet it was impossible to miss the way passersby looked at them. Since he\u2019d given Olive his only spare shirt, he was bare chested, his tattoos busier than the intersection they were crossing. Some of the people they passed knew Rory from the neighborhood and averted their eyes, giving him wide berth on the sidewalk. Did Olive notice? He hoped she did. Hoped she realized the local hothead had no business with a pretty blonde angel in thick-rimmed glasses and college courses lined up. He needed to scare her away once and for all, because this crazy connection between them was like an overloaded circuit breaker, capable of setting his world on fire. He\u2019d been worried that spending time with Olive would amount to him feeling\u2026possessive. Or worse, optimistic that something lasting could come out of it. He\u2019d done a lot more than spend time with her, though. And something had happened in the dark of the shower that felt irreversible. They\u2019d communicated things with their bodies he didn\u2019t know how to say out loud. Mine. No. She wasn\u2019t his. Tell that to the organ in his chest that wouldn\u2019t stop racing, though. Tell that to his primed body. His mind, which refused to stop reminding Rory that she screamed when he teased her clit long enough. That she kissed him like she didn\u2019t give a shit about oxygen. Christ, she was incredible. \u201cIs Andrew your only brother?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cNo, there are three of us. Andrew is the oldest, which is why he acts like the king prick sometimes. Not sure if you noticed.\u201d They shared a wry smile. \u201cJamie is in the middle. Then me.\u201d \u201cAre you all lifeguards?\u201d \u201cYeah. Every summer since we were sixteen.\u201d Discomfort crept up the back of his neck. \u201cAlthough I missed a couple of summers a while back.\u201d When Olive looked at him, obviously waiting for an explanation, he changed the direction of the conversation, needing to live in this world a little longer. A world where she didn\u2019t know the extent of his depravity. \u201cJamie teaches during the school year. Economics. He\u2019s smart like you.\u201d Olive opened her mouth and closed it again. \u201cUm, thank you.\u201d She paused. \u201cDon\u2019t tell him, but I hate economics. It\u2019s too cut and dried. Not enough room for theories or gray areas.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m telling him.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She poked Rory in the side with her free hand and the move was so cute, he almost stopped walking to kiss her. Just wanted to yank her up on her toes and work her innocent body into another frenzy, like he\u2019d done in the shower. But he kept walking, jaw clenched. As if sensing Rory trying to create distance between them, she launched into a ramble. \u201cI mean, I guess there is something to be said for gray areas. Right? That\u2019s where light and dark come together. If they always stayed separate, life would be pretty boring.\u201d Was she talking about them? Trying to convince him he had a right to walk beside her on the street? To be with her? He wouldn\u2019t allow himself to be convinced. Rory looked ahead and realized they were entering the more expensive area where the rents ticked up by a couple grand. \u201cHow much farther?\u201d he asked without making eye contact. \u201cA couple of blocks.\u201d Her subdued tone filled him with concern. \u201cYou feeling okay? Cold again?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She regarded him thoughtfully. \u201cI was just thinking about what you said, back in the locker room. When you were talking to your brother.\u201d Rory exhaled hard, trying and failing not to think of Andrew\u2019s disappointed expression. Shouldn\u2019t he be used to it by now? \u201cWhich part?\u201d Olive seemed hesitant, watching him through her lashes. \u201cThat you don\u2019t get choices. You get marching orders. What did you mean?\u201d \u201cThat I don\u2019t get trusted with a lot of responsibility. Andrew tells us where to go. When to be there.\u201d He tried to sound less frustrated but couldn\u2019t pull it off. \u201cJamie has other shit going on, though. Teaching, his books. I just get a schedule and a lot of skepticism that I can stick to it.\u201d \u201cDo you earn that skepticism?\u201d \u201cYeah. I do.\u201d He raked a hand through his hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of being efficient if I\u2019ll never go any higher than where I\u2019m at, you know? This is it. I\u2019m a name on a schedule.\u201d She seemed genuinely confused. \u201cIs that all you want to be?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Rory heard the word come out of his mouth before his brain registered it. Did he want more than lifeguarding and pouring drinks? Was an ex-con wanting more out of the daily grind just wishful thinking? When he started to consider the answer might be no\u2026or at the very least a gray area, hope trickled in\u2014and it alarmed him. He\u2019d been so devoid of hope or light at the end of the tunnel, he didn\u2019t know how to handle it. What if he tried and found out for certain that there had never been a point? For damn sure, nothing he did would be good enough to deserve the girl walking beside him with such trust. Olive blinked up at Rory and he realized he was staring. \u201cAndrew also said\u2026he said you called him from a holding cell once?\u201d His stomach took a dive toward the sidewalk. Had part of him wished she\u2019d missed that part of Andrew and Jiya\u2019s conversation? Why? It would be counterproductive when his goal was to bring this girl to her expensive apartment building and split. To leave her alone for good. That\u2019s why he had her hand locked in a death grip, right? Rory pulled Olive to a stop on the sidewalk and forced himself to untangle their fingers, pushing them through his hair instead. \u201cI should have been more upfront with you, Olive, okay?\u201d He tried to swallow, but his mouth was too dry. \u201cWhen I thought we\u2019d never make it past those milkshakes, I thought I\u2019d get away with not telling you. So you wouldn\u2019t look back and think of me as\u2026that ex-con you almost accidentally dated. I didn\u2019t want that. But here we are. And I still have your phone number even though I damn well shouldn\u2019t. So you need to know, sunbeam, that I\u2019m not lying when I say I\u2019m not a good guy. I\u2019m not good for you.\u201d The breeze blew the blonde hair around her face. \u201cSo you were\u2026\u201d \u201cThe night I called Andrew was a separate occasion. But yeah, Olive. I\u2019ve done time in prison.\u201d Just do it. Cut this off before you fall any deeper for this girl. She would wise up someday down the road, when it was too late, and he\u2019d have to sever an arm to let her go. He\u2019d be her villain. \u201cI put a guy in a coma. With my fists. That\u2019s the kind of man who you just defended back there as heroic. That was real sweet and all, baby, but it\u2019s not true.\u201d He heard her swallow over the rush of traffic on the avenue. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Nothing excuses it, Olive,\u201d he said adamantly. \u201cOr the fact that I\u2019m still not great at controlling my temper. You feel it. You know. I\u2019ve gone looking for fights since I was a kid\u2014it\u2019s a nice, little trait I inherited from my father. Men fight. Men swing their fists and ask questions later. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d Her expression told Rory the times he\u2019d almost lost his cool with the waiter and Andrew hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed. \u201cHow long were you away?\u201d \u201cHow long was I in prison? That\u2019s where I went.\u201d He ground his molars together, hating this after period they\u2019d entered. After she found out. He\u2019d lay odds on her searching for a break in the conversation so she could sprint for safety. \u201cA little under two years, starting when I was eighteen. On an assault change.\u201d A degree of color left her face. \u201cThe man is okay?\u201d \u201cYeah, he\u2019s fine now. Jamie checked. But we don\u2019t exactly exchange Christmas cards.\u201d Even with the passing traffic and the ocean roar in the distance, the silence that dropped over them was deafening. \u201cOkay, I get it, Rory. You\u2019re not ideal boyfriend material.\u201d He didn\u2019t breathe as seconds ticked past. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re trying to tell me?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cYou have to go. You have to get away.\u201d Olive flinched but kept her chin up. \u201cSo, fine. I\u2019m going to walk away now. And you\u2019re going to let me go, right? You\u2019re going to throw away my number and I\u2019ll eventually forget who gave me this T-shirt. Fine with me.\u201d Direct hit. Was there an arrow sticking out of his chest? \u201cIt\u2019s not fine with me. I never said it was fine,\u201d he managed. \u201cI\u2019m just doing the right thing by you.\u201d \u201cBy dropping me? I kind of left Oklahoma to get away from people doing that to me, so it\u2019s a good thing I found out early that this can\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d The light sheen in her eyes made his chest ache. \u201cI\u2019m meeting Leanne in the morning to study. We have a test early Monday morning and\u2026I have to go. Bye, Rory.\u201d When she breezed past him, Rory swore she ripped off a layer of skin. His stomach shot up into his mouth as Olive moved farther away down the sidewalk, the sound of her sandals fading and blending into the traffic. Jesus, he was going to be sick. He started to go after her, already counting the seconds until he could get his arms around her, but he froze in his tracks when Olive stopped in front of the nicest building on the block. A uniformed man opened the door for her\u2014and the dude must have seen them together, because he sent a look of distaste across the street. Olive paused in the entrance, turning back toward Rory and all but imploring him to come and get her. But he hesitated. That doorman had the right idea. He didn\u2019t belong within ten feet of a girl like Olive. Her college career was on the horizon and she was set up, living in the best building money could afford. So although it killed him, he took off down the sidewalk, glancing back a moment later to find her gone. Out of sight. Feeling like he\u2019d been hit by a truck, Rory leaned back against the closest building. She\u2019d compared him to the family that had essentially abandoned her. Couldn\u2019t she see this wasn\u2019t to serve his own self-interest? If he allowed himself to be selfish, they would spend every available second together. He would ride her to classes on his bike. He\u2019d watch over her on the beach and buy her so many milkshakes, she\u2019d get sick of them. No. No, she\u2019d walked away, too, right? He\u2019d told her everything and she\u2019d made the decision that was right for her. She hadn\u2019t argued or tried to make light of what he\u2019d done in the past\u2014because it wasn\u2019t possible. There was no light angle, it was all dark. He\u2019d done the right thing here. Olive was too young, her future too promising, to get caught up with an older man with so little to offer and a reputation for fighting to boot. Go. Turn and go. His feet might as well have been encased in concrete boots, but Rory managed to walk back to the beach, emptiness spreading a little further to the corners of his stomach with every single step. * Rory sat on the top step of the house the next morning, watching oranges and reds thread their fingers into the sky. He\u2019d slept approximately eighteen minutes the night before, so he couldn\u2019t exactly appreciate the beauty of nature. He could only think about Olive having an early study date with her friend. How was she getting there? The bus? Did she have a car he didn\u2019t know about? What if something bad happened and he wasn\u2019t there to save her? He tossed the dregs of his freezing cold coffee into the bushes, set the mug down and scrubbed his hands down his face. She\u2019d called his bluff. No sense in denying it. He\u2019d been awake enough hours and replayed their conversation in his head so many times, he could recite it word for word. Yeah, he\u2019d meant what he said to Olive. There couldn\u2019t be a relationship between them. They lived in different worlds. They were going different places. But he hadn\u2019t really allowed himself to consider what it would be like never talking to her again. Never seeing or kissing her again. A world where none of those things were possible left him lifeless, staring out into the sunrise trying to remember if there was a point to going through the motions every day, like he\u2019d been doing for so long. Since returning home from prison, he hadn\u2019t allowed himself to be ambitious. Wasn\u2019t ambition kind of pointless with a prison record? How far could a man reasonably go with an assault attached to his name? Even without a record, his hair trigger energy made people uneasy. On the nights he bartended at the Castle Gate, conversations were kept to a quieter pitch. Customers chose to sit at tables instead of in front of him at the bar. Every once in a while, a woman would be attracted to the very same energy that made others wary, but until Olive, Rory hadn\u2019t realized how uncomfortable those women made him. They looked at him and saw a novelty. A one-time thrill. No one had ever looked at him the way Olive did. No judgment. Only curiosity, awareness\u2026and that complicated something between them that he didn\u2019t have a name for. Like she wanted to explore him. Like she couldn\u2019t help wanting to. Needing to. What would it be like to have Olive look up at him with such trust and open admiration\u2026and know he\u2019d earned it? To be a good man for her? Pointless thoughts. Rory traced some carvings on the concrete stairs with the toe of his sneakers. His initials, along with Andrew\u2019s and Jamie\u2019s. He could still remember the afternoon they\u2019d used a stick to alter the wet cement. How their father had reacted when he got home that night from running the Castle Gate. Their mother had borne the brunt of his anger. She always had\u2014and they\u2019d been too young to do anything about it. Back then, anyway. As always, when Rory thought of that time, the nape of his neck turned hot, wire seeming to stretch his fingers, curl them into fists. When he\u2019d gotten sentenced, his mother and father had still been living together in the house. Jamie had been a senior in college, on the brink of earning his degree in Education, Andrew was beginning to take over the family business and working constantly. That left eighteen-year-old Rory alone with his parents in the house. By then, he\u2019d grown taller and broader than his father. It went unspoken that he would protect his mother and win. Until the night on the beach when he\u2019d given in to his anger. Hard to protect anyone from inside of a cell. The door of the house opened, saving Rory from his darkening thoughts. When both of his brothers emerged barefoot in sweatpants and hoodies, Rory ignored them, continuing to stare out at the horizon in stony silence. Jamie sat on the bottom step. Andrew took the one beside him. No one said anything, except for the neighborhood, which spoke its own language of cars rumbling to life, seagulls calling to each other on the breeze, the Atlantic Ocean waking up in the distance. Finally, Andrew broke the silence. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I said yesterday. About not being able to afford you. Especially after you\u2019d just been through a rescue. A tough one.\u201d He scratched at his morning beard. \u201cI was just pissed off.\u201d Rory waved a dismissive hand, even though a shift took place in his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, man.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d Andrew shifted on the step. \u201cLook. This girl Olive is obviously important to you and she overheard\u2014\u201d \u201cI said it\u2019s fine.\u201d Hearing her name out loud cracked him straight down the middle, so it took him a few seconds to continue. \u201cMy brother bitching about me and saying I\u2019m unpredictable wasn\u2019t the deal breaker.\u201d Jamie turned to face them with a curious expression. \u201cYou told her about prison?\u201d His jaw clenched \u201cHad to be done.\u201d \u201cI assume you told her how it happened.\u201d Jamie prompted. \u201cWhy it happened.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a difference, Jamie.\u201d \u201cSorry, but fuck that. It makes a difference to me.\u201d A stone lodged itself in Rory\u2019s throat. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to imply it wasn\u2019t important. Only that the outcome is the same, no matter what prompted me to almost kill a man.\u201d No one spoke for a moment, all of them probably recalling the day he\u2019d been cuffed and thrown into the back of a police car. The guilty plea that followed, despite being advised otherwise by his court-appointed attorney. He\u2019d done the crime, hadn\u2019t he? So he\u2019d pay for it. \u201cSo was it a deal breaker?\u201d Andrew asked, easing the building tension with a half-smile. \u201cBecause she came to your defense pretty hard in the Hut. If she\u2019d had a bat handy, I\u2019d be limping behind the bar tonight.\u201d Half of Rory wanted them to stop talking about Olive. The other half? Didn\u2019t want to talk about anything but her. The latter half won by a landslide. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it broke the deal. I think I might have crushed it before she got the chance.\u201d Jamie\u2019s sigh was long suffering. \u201cI didn\u2019t even get the opportunity to judge her.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d have loved her,\u201d Rory said, pressing his thumbs into his eye sockets to try and stop the images of her walking away over and over again. \u201cShe almost got hit by a fucking bus because a book distracted her.\u201d \u201cWhich book?\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019ve seen you read it before. Something by Vonnegut.\u201d \u201cHow dare you mess this up for me,\u201d Jamie deadpanned. \u201cI kind of hate you.\u201d He laughed, but it lacked authenticity. \u201cJoin the club.\u201d The three of them watched as a group of joggers ran past down in the middle of the street, moving in the direction of the boardwalk. Not an unusual sight in Long Beach, but groups of joggers that size didn\u2019t usually route themselves through a residential area\u2014especially one on the lower end of the income spectrum. \u201cYou ever seen them pass through this way before?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Andrew responded with a head shake. \u201cAnd I\u2019m always up at this time working.\u201d Jamie and Rory traded an eye roll. But when they eased back into silence, Rory couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the joggers. They got up every morning, same as him. Odds are, most of them didn\u2019t love their jobs. They were probably tired, needed vacations. But despite all of it, they woke up every morning and achieved a goal. They took different routes to reach it, changed, adapted to the terrain and worked toward something that satisfied them. All right, so maybe the joggers weren\u2019t the first to shake these new revelations loose. He\u2019d spent a lot of time staring up at the ceiling last night. Thinking of Olive, yeah, but he\u2019d also done a lot of wondering about himself. How long could he expect to continue in this same repetitive holding pattern of lifeguarding and bartending with nothing to show for it? He was already tired of it at twenty-four. He never reached a goal, like the joggers did. Hell, like his brothers did. Little by little, Andrew improved the Castle Gate, turning it from a dive to a respected neighborhood staple. No longer the kid who\u2019d one day inherit the landmark bar, he was now a legitimate businessman. Jamie would receive his teaching tenure soon. Sometimes Rory thought their middle brother fell back into their patented routine of lifeguarding and bartending every summer because it was a family custom. Really, though, with his intelligence and college degree, he could do anything. That left Rory. He couldn\u2019t do anything he wanted. But maybe it was time to try something. To set a goal and jog for it. Rory cleared his throat. \u201cI know it\u2019s not the best time to ask, seeing as how I fucked up yesterday, but, uh\u2026\u201d Striving for casual even though his pulse was ticking his ears, Rory shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re stressed out, A. Between the bar and the beach, you\u2019ve got at least sixty employees to juggle.\u201d No matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t make eye contact with Andrew, afraid he\u2019d see wariness there. \u201cI\u2019ve been around long enough to know how to place liquor orders for the bar. Receive deliveries. Make sure the kitchen and bar are stocked. You can show me how to do payroll.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cLet me help.\u201d Rory stared out at the horizon and held his breath, waiting for a response. He could feel Jamie trading a silent look with their older brother, probably shocked out of their minds. That made three of them. As he waited for the verdict that suddenly seemed like the most important one of his life, thoughts of Olive crept in. Chances were slim to none that he\u2019d ever be a college graduate. Or someone who read a ton of books. Odds were he\u2019d never have a nine-to-five. Still. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder\u2026 If he changed his route and worked hard enough, could Olive be proud to be with a guy like him? \u201cCan you get to the bar early tonight?\u201d Andrew asked, squinting one eye over at him. \u201cPayroll is a little tricky, but it shouldn\u2019t take you long to pick it up.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Rory said thickly, relief filtering in, warming him with something that resembled hope. \u201cI can do that.\u201d Several heavy beats passed before Jamie put a hand over his heart and spoke. \u201cHere we are, trapped in the amber of the moment\u2014\u201d \u201cChrist,\u201d Rory muttered, coming to his feet and turning before Jamie could see his smile. \u201cShut up, Jamie.\u201d His middle brother stood, too. \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me when I\u2019m quoting Vonnegut.\u201d Jiya chose that moment to arrive at the bottom of the stoop, an apron dangling from her hand. \u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d all three brothers said at the same time. It didn\u2019t feel like nothing, though. It felt like the beginning of something. \n CHAPTER SEVEN Olive sat in the window of a coffee shop sipping an iced coffee and skipping around between her favorite scenes of Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, her go-to comfort read. Every person who passed by the glass storefront were jovial, relaxed. On their way to the beach. She wanted to follow in their wake and warm herself in the sunshine again, but she remained glued to the chair, shivering in the air conditioning. She reached the part in the book where the reader meets Zaphod Beeblebrox, a two-headed, three-armed former president of the Galaxy\u2014and ship thief\u2014dismayed when she didn\u2019t experience her usual sense of solace. She hadn\u2019t been back to the beach in two weeks. Two weeks since she\u2019d been pulled from the ocean, had a sexual awakening and been cast aside. All in a matter of hours. It was impressive, really, how many peaks and valleys she\u2019d managed to cram into one afternoon. Maybe she should call Guinness and apply for world record status. Olive grimaced into a sip of watered-down coffee. It wasn\u2019t like her to be so negative, but she\u2019d taken a lot longer to recover from Rory Prince than expected. As in, she hadn\u2019t recovered. Hardly at all. Every time she left her apartment, she swore he would be waiting outside, that serious, this-is-a-bad-idea expression cemented on his gorgeous face. Walking through Long Beach, she always had the fresh sense she\u2019d just missed seeing him. Which was crazy. She was crazy. Her focus should be squarely on acing her summer class and beginning a sterling college career. And it had. She\u2019d been more meticulous than usual when writing papers and studying for quizzes, mostly in the name of distraction. She only allowed herself to pine for Rory after she finished her homework, and she almost always stuck to that incentive/reward system. Just kidding. This cavernous feeling in her stomach refused to be filled, no matter how many food truck dinners she fed it. It would, though. It had to, because Rory obviously wasn\u2019t coming back. Nor was he going to call the number she\u2019d scrawled on the straw wrapper. Was it still in his locker? For the millionth time in the last two weeks, she wondered if she\u2019d walked away from Rory too soon. He\u2019d just told her something serious. A majorly serious thing. That he\u2019d been in prison for putting a man in a coma. A smart girl such as herself was well within the parameters of common sense to run away and never look back. Except for two things. One, he\u2019d practically tripped over himself to make sure Olive knew he was bad news. Would someone with a conscience do that? Or would they act selfishly, take what they wanted and let the other person suffer in due course? And the second reason she should have checked herself before turning away? The way he made her feel wasn\u2019t going to come around again. At only eighteen years old, people might laugh at her for being so positive of that notion. Well, so be it. She absorbed a little more knowledge with every book she read. Olive had walked in a million sets of shoes, throughout dozens of unique genres, living through the heartache of others and combing through the world\u2019s philosophies while hidden away on the second floor of her parents\u2019 house. She\u2019d only lived for eighteen years, but her soul held the weight of lifetimes. If she never saw Rory again, she would wonder what they could have been until she grew old. She just knew it. That\u2019s why she\u2019d shouted at him to come back the day they\u2019d met. It\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t sleep anymore. And God, wasn\u2019t that terrifying? All of it. It was so scary, she didn\u2019t think the air conditioner was responsible for making her shiver anymore. Rory, this person she\u2019d felt drawn to so entirely since laying eyes on him\u2026had blown her off. Two weeks later, there was no denying that. The day they\u2019d broken up\u2014because a break-up is exactly how it had felt, even if they weren\u2019t boyfriend and girlfriend\u2014she\u2019d compared Rory to her parents. It had been an emotional response and she\u2019d regretted throwing it in his face. Now, though? She wasn\u2019t so sure she wanted Rory to show up again. One afternoon at age fourteen, after finishing her schoolwork early, she\u2019d gone out to see a movie. When it didn\u2019t hold her interest, she\u2019d left the theater early and come home to find her parents shooting a video with her siblings. They\u2019d turned to find her in the hallway, guilt written all over their faces. Her brother and sister had been covered in finger paint, laughter frozen on their faces. They\u2019d deliberately left her out of a filming session. And that had been the beginning of the family division; Olive on one side, everyone else on the other. She\u2019d tiptoed through her own house so as not to disrupt their progress, chest panging over the distant sounds of giggling, the pride and encouragement in her parents\u2019 voices. Sure, her mother and father had made an effort to engage her after the videos had been filmed, edited and uploaded to YouTube, but those conversations never stopped seeming forced. If they\u2019d left her out of the videos at a younger age, Olive probably would have been relieved. But by age fourteen, they\u2019d been entertaining the masses for years and she\u2019d already become known among people in town as that internet girl. They\u2019d seen her sleeping, brushing her teeth, crying, getting haircuts and having her tonsils removed. To suddenly have that identity taken away after working so hard to live within it\u2026was hard. Really hard. It seemed as though abandonment came in more than one form. Rory dropping her like a bad habit wasn\u2019t on par with her parents losing interest in her. But it left Olive with the same hollowness and uncertainty. She and Rory had only known each other for three days when he\u2019d left her reeling. What would a relationship with him be like? Constantly waiting and worrying for the next time his conscience flared up? She should be grateful he\u2019d ended it sooner rather than later. Olive was rubbing at the ever-present tightness in her throat when her cell phone rang in her pocket. Just like every other time it had rung for the last two weeks, her heart shot up into her mouth. It wasn\u2019t him, though. Thank God. Right? \u201cHey, Leanne,\u201d she answered, twisting the straw of her drink. A line formed between her eyes when laughing male voices could be heard on the other end. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going out tonight,\u201d Leanne squealed back. \u201cYou know that sophomore in our Intro to Psych class? I ran into her while getting takeout tacos and she invited me to hang out\u2014she has a place off campus\u2014and all these freaking senior guys are here. Athletes, Olive.\u201d \u201cWhat kind?\u201d \u201cThe athletic kind.\u201d Olive giggled into the back of her wrist. \u201cContinue.\u201d \u201cThey invited us out tonight. We\u2019re going out. To bars.\u201d \u201cWe are?\u201d \u201cYes. I\u2019m playing the buddy system card.\u201d She\u2019d only known Leanne since the first day of class, but they\u2019d bonded over a love of Pavlov and made each other laugh. It had been a while since Olive had clicked with another girl who hadn\u2019t known her as a YouTube personality first and Olive second. It was refreshing and comfortable and Olive didn\u2019t want Leanne going out with near-strangers alone, whether they went to Stony Brook or not. Especially since they were both lacking in the adult party experience department. Just the idea of dressing up and making small talk exhausted her, though. Not to mention, going out with boys\u2026just the idea of it made her feel unfaithful to Rory. Which was ridiculous. And stupid. Nonetheless, Olive\u2019s knee jiggled under the window bar as she tried to come up with an excuse to not go. She was disappointing herself, but so be it. Two weeks hadn\u2019t been long enough to get the green-eyed lifeguard out of her head and\u2014 A motorcycle rumbled to a stop at the light, across the street from the coffee shop. The rider\u2019s fingers stretched on the handlebars in a way she recognized, along with the tense shoulders, the rangy build. No, it couldn\u2019t be him. Could it? He took off the helmet and shoved a hand through his hair, making some adjustment to the face shield before replacing the protective gear on his head. Olive almost dropped the phone. It was him. Without realizing it, she\u2019d slid off her stool and hidden her body partially behind a pillar. The hair on her skin stood straight up, her pulse in a permanent spike. How dare he look even more gorgeous and masculine than she remembered? She\u2019d never seen him on the bike before and something about the scene excited Olive despite her best efforts. Her palms started to sweat and she dragged her free one down the leg of her shorts, his voice drifting into her head from out of nowhere. Been dreaming about those legs snapping together around my hips. Just like that. What would it be like to ride behind him on that bike? \u201cOlive?\u201d Leanne\u2019s prompt brought her back to the present. \u201cOh I\u2019m, yeah. I\u2019m here.\u201d As if he\u2019d heard her voice, Rory\u2019s head whipped in direction, but Olive drew back behind the pillar just in time, attempting to draw in a calming measure of oxygen through her nose. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Leanne asked. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I don\u2019t know. But as the engine of Rory\u2019s motorcycle revved, the purr moving farther and farther into the distance, Olive got good and irritated. Look at me. Hiding from a guy. Avoiding the beach. Crying at Allstate commercials. Rory Prince should be changing his routine to avoid her. She\u2019d opened herself up to him and he\u2019d rejected the offering. That didn\u2019t mean she should mope around and forget why she moved to Long Beach. This was the summer she embraced new beginnings and prepared to start her college career. Leanne and her other classmates were living their lives and there was no reason she shouldn\u2019t do the same. \u201cLeanne,\u201d Olive said, her spine snapped straight. \u201cWhat time are we going out tonight?\u201d * Wow. Underage drinking wasn\u2019t even a challenge. Were the police aware of this? A senior lacrosse player named Zed passed Olive a foaming second beer in as many bars and she thanked him, saluting as he watched and taking a small sip. He put up his arms in exaggerated victory and she made herself laugh through the bitter taste. Leanne nudged her in the ribs as Zed joined a rowdy conversation with the four other senior guys and girls along for the night. \u201cHe likes you.\u201d \u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Olive assessed Zed, powerless to do anything but compare his Captain America good looks to Rory\u2019s villainous ones\u2014and annoyingly preferring the latter. \u201cCool. Want to share this beer with me?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d Leanne rolled her eyes and took the beer, drinking deeply. \u201cGod, that\u2019s gross.\u201d \u201cI know. I wish he\u2019d stop buying them for me.\u201d \u201cBecause you\u2019re not interested in him? Or the beer?\u201d Both. Instead of voicing that opinion out loud, however, she forced herself to remember her resolve from earlier that day. She had to stop looking for Rory Prince around every corner and start enjoying herself. Zed was a decent sort, if a little boisterous. They\u2019d started on one end of West Beech Street, grabbing food truck empanadas and piling into KJ\u2019s Saloon. After that, they\u2019d taken their beer buzz to the boardwalk, Olive and Leanne hanging back and watching the guys\u2019 antics. Zed had started a bench hopping competition between the guys that had earned them exasperated looks from passersby. Olive could relate, finding Zed a tad on the immature side. Although, maybe she wasn\u2019t in the best frame of mind for exploring new horizons and she should reserve judgment. Leanne leaned in and tapped her arm. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about the guy from the milkshake shop, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Olive\u2019s surprise turned Leanne\u2019s features smug. \u201cThe guy who asked for your numbah.\u201d She started to deny the claim but gave in almost immediately. \u201cHow do you know? I purposely haven\u2019t said a word about him.\u201d \u201cAre you forgetting we\u2019re psych majors? Not mentioning him was the dead giveaway.\u201d \u201cBravo.\u201d Olive nodded, impressed. \u201cYou might as well skip right to graduation.\u201d Leanne considered. \u201cBut then I\u2019d miss gross beer and dick jokes.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not into these dudes, either, are you?\u201d \u201cGod no. And I had such high hopes.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThanks a lot, Hollywood.\u201d They laughed so loud the group of seniors sent them suspicious looks. \u201cDo we just leave? What is the protocol here?\u201d Two hands slapped down on their table. \u201cDrink up, ladies. We\u2019re heading to the next place.\u201d Leanne handed Zed the beer and they watched as he made quick work of the remaining golden liquid, before plunking it onto the table. \u201cAre you not entertained, freshman?\u201d Olive tried not to groan as they followed the noisy group from the bar. She and Leanne walked arm in arm on the boardwalk, pointing out places they wanted to try next time\u2014preferably alone. The guys resumed their bench hopping competition and even though they were twice as drunk and ungainly this time, Olive decided she was having a good time. So two nerds hadn\u2019t meshed well with some senior jocks. So what? It wasn\u2019t exactly surprising. Plus, the awkwardness of the night had allowed her to bond with Leanne. Having been homeschooled, Olive hadn\u2019t grown up with a lot of close friends. Mostly just acquaintances from the neighborhood and church. Her mutual interests with Leanne made it easy to open up, though, and as they walked and Leanne shared details about her upbringing, Olive found herself doing the same, even confiding how YouTube had divided her family. Olive knew talking about it would help. Hello psychology. She just wondered when the memories would loosen their grip on the present. Tonight was about relaxing. A new start. So she set aside the past and tried to enjoy. The wind blew in off the Atlantic and Olive closed her eyes as it rushed over her bare shoulders and legs, lifting the fall of blonde hair off her neck. A new calm encompassed her in a wave as they waded through a crowd of outdoor smokers into a new bar\u2014and that\u2019s where her calm shattered into a thousand pieces. Because there was Rory behind the bar, pulling a pint of beer from a white-handled tap. Just like earlier when she\u2019d seen him through the coffee shop window, his head turned in her direction like she\u2019d called his name. They locked eyes and she sucked in a breath, no way to brace for the impact of having the man\u2019s attention on her again. But it didn\u2019t take any time at all for that attention to drift to Zed who\u2019d thrown an arm around her shoulders to guide her through the crowd\u2026 \n CHAPTER EIGHT One second he\u2019d been in the zone. The rhythm bartenders fall into on a busy night like tonight. Pour drink, take cash, ring it up, drop off the change, move on to the next customer. All while clearing empty glasses, getting them washed and ready to use again. Fast, fast, fast. No time to notice anything but the immediate mob of thirsty patrons crowding the bar. On top of his usual bartending routine, he noticed new things now. Over the last couple of weeks, ordering supplies had been on Rory\u2019s shoulders, so he noticed when the foam heads on his Sam Adams pours started to get smaller and made a notation to order another keg tomorrow from the supplier. The ice machine had started to hum louder, so he scheduled the repair man. He sent the staff on their breaks and took phone calls for larger groups that wanted reserved seating. Having more weight on his shoulders was nice. Not only did it seem to motivate him, increase his focus\u2026these new things helped distract him from the utter fucking agony of not being with Olive Cunningham for fourteen days. Nothing looked the same anymore. The world had changed now that he knew she lived inside of it, the knowledge of her existence carved into every cell of his being. And so he felt Olive the moment she crossed the threshold of the Castle Gate. Felt a twist in his gut, causing his rhythm to hitch. Jesus. Christ. She looked incredible, all drowsy smiles and a silk tank top tucked into her white mini skirt. Her glasses sat perched on her nose, making her adorable on top of sexy. Every man repositioned themselves to watch her enter. As if that didn\u2019t wreak immediate havoc on his sanity, some guy put an arm around her\u2014and Rory saw fucking stars. Bright, blinding, sharp-cornered pings of torture in his direct vision, as if his brain was trying to block out the offensive sight in the name of self-preservation. Beer coasted down over his knuckles and he dropped the glass onto the copper drain with a loud rattle that was immediately absorbed by the pumping music. People waved money in his face and shouted drink orders, but he couldn\u2019t hear any of it. He could only watch in horror as some sweaty, Ralph Lauren polo shirt-wearing asshole leaned down and said something way too close to Olive\u2019s face. Rory growled, his right hand gripping the bar so tight, the wood grains made impressions on his palm. Was that her boyfriend? Did she have a boyfriend? \u201cHey.\u201d Jamie came up beside Rory and handed him a towel. \u201cYou all right?\u201d Olive\u2019s face came into view again as she passed through the crowd and Rory made a choked sound, barely stopping himself from vaulting over the bar to drag her away from another man. He couldn\u2019t even describe how she was looking at him? Half-indignant, half\u2026apologetic? Rory didn\u2019t like it. Was he just supposed to stand there and watch someone paw her? Jesus, he couldn\u2019t do it. He\u2019d lose his mind. \u201cThat\u2019s Olive, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jamie muttered. \u201cFuck, man.\u201d \u201cI have to go get her\u2026\u201d Rory muttered, lunging for the hatch that would let him out from behind the bar. Jamie blocked him, however, before he could reach it. Anyone else would have regretted that move, but Rory would rather lose his limbs than lay a finger on his middle brother, and Jamie knew it. \u201cGet out of the way. He\u2019s touching her.\u201d \u201cListen to me, Rory. She\u2019s not your property.\u201d Jamie laid his hands on Rory\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re not even dating her.\u201d Yet every second that passed was strangling him, making it harder and harder to breathe. \u201cOlive\u2026she\u2019s\u2026I\u2019m not good enough for her,\u201d he managed. \u201cNeither is anyone else. Neither is that guy.\u201d \u201cNot your call.\u201d \u201cMove, Jamie.\u201d \u201cUh-uh.\u201d There was a shout from somewhere deep in the crowded bar. And Rory\u2019s world started to move in slow motion. The customers closest to the bar turned to face the commotion and there was a break in the mass of bodies. The guy who\u2019d had his arm around Olive was now facing off with a Castle Gate regular Rory recognized. Polo Shirt shoved the regular and shouted something Rory couldn\u2019t hear over the music, but it made the regular shove him back. And then the fists started flying. \u201cOlive,\u201d Rory breathed, rattling the shelves of bottles as he dodged Jamie, attempting to reach her before one of those fists came within two feet of her. Before he could lift the hatch, though, he could only watch in horror as Polo Shirt swung on the regular, got blocked and stumbled backwards, running into Olive hard and sending her stumbling. She went down, knocking her head on the side of a table as she went\u2014and a bomb detonated inside Rory. He was only vaguely aware that his angry bellow brought the bar\u2014and the fight\u2014to a standstill, because he could only see her. The way she grimaced and pressed a hand to her head. Hurt. She\u2019s hurt. This time, he didn\u2019t bother using the fucking hatch. He launched himself over the bar, upsetting bottles and spilling drinks, red bleeding into the edges of his vision. People darted out of his way as he stalked toward the man who\u2019d knocked Olive over. His fists were two rocks, shaking at his sides, lifting, ready to do some serious damage and God, it was going to feel so good. He might have cleaned this fucker\u2019s clock just for walking in with Olive. For thinking he could breathe the same air as her. You made some mistakes tonight, asshole. Huge ones. Rory didn\u2019t know what made him glance down at Olive where she sat on the floor, being comforted by her friend, but her expression caused a pause in his stride. Her eyes were wide, her hands curled up under her chin. She looked\u2026scared. What did she have to be scared about? He was here. He was going to take care of everything. Take care of the idiot who\u2019d put her in a position where she could get hurt. Rory tried to tell her that without words, but she only shook her head, fear becoming more prominent on her beautiful, but paling, face. Olive\u2019s friend tried to block her view of Rory. And that\u2019s when Rory realized Olive was scared\u2026of him. She was scared of him. His heart plummeted to his boots so rapidly, he wondered how he remained standing. The rage drained in one fell swoop and all that remained was denial. Shame. He\u2019d felt that combination before but never with enough force to knock the wind out of his lungs. \u201cSunbeam,\u201d he mouthed, halting his progress in the direction of Polo Shirt. He forced his fists to unfold and held up both hands, approaching her slowly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not going to do nothin\u2019,\u201d he rasped, forgetting to phrase his words the right way. \u201cLook, baby.\u201d She sniffed hard and nodded. Rory approached her slowly, swallowing a lump when her friend seemed reluctant to let him touch her. But Olive patted her friend\u2019s hand, never breaking eye contact once as he crouched down and replaced the glasses that had been knocked off her face. Then he scooped her up and cradled her against his chest. Bliss cascaded downward from the top of his head, traveling to his feet as he carried Olive back through the silent crowd toward the bar. Andrew passed him with a shocked expression on the way, finally shaking himself and using his authority to toss out the would-be brawlers and restore order. Christ, it felt so good to hold her. To have her close. His need to punish the ones who\u2019d put her in harm\u2019s way was almost squashed until he noticed the bleeding cut at her hairline. His footsteps faltered on the way into the back office. \u201cJamie,\u201d he said thickly. \u201cI need the first-aid kit.\u201d Rory barely registered his middle\u2019s brother\u2019s bewilderment before he and Olive were inside the dark office. After setting her carefully down on the edge of the desk, he used his elbow to flip on the light switch\u2014and with Olive\u2019s beauty illuminated, he could only stare, his tongue weighted and useless in his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking pretty.\u201d She gasped and sat up straighter, her chin wobbling. \u201cOh\u2026shut up.\u201d How many times could his heart hit the deck in one night? \u201cShut up?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right. Don\u2019t bring your romantic lines around here. I\u2019m not buying them.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not being romantic.\u201d Rory stepped closer, every cell in his body buzzing louder with every inch he traveled in her proximity. \u201cI\u2019m telling you what I see.\u201d \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t seen you in two weeks.\u201d She crossed her arms over her middle, but not before he saw her shudder. \u201cI mean it, Rory. Don\u2019t act like you missed me when you could stay away so easily. Actually, I-I kind of hate you right now.\u201d Feeling like he\u2019d been sucker punched in the gut, he gripped the desk on either side of her thighs and leaned in as close as she would allow, smelling the air above her collarbone. \u201cEasily?\u201d He lifted his head and met her eyes. \u201cYou stayed late yesterday morning after class and missed your bus back to Long Beach. The one I follow to make sure it arrives safely?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI was two seconds from heading into the Burnbaum building and finding you. You never stay late.\u201d Her expression slowly cleared of frustration, making way for disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019ve been following me?\u201d \u201cOnly when you travel to Stony Brook,\u201d he said, bringing their lips an inch apart, letting his thumbs graze the outside of her thighs. \u201cI get nervous when you leave town.\u201d \u201cI knew it. I felt you,\u201d she whispered, eyelids fluttering. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare kiss me, Rory Prince. I\u2019m really mad.\u201d There was nothing worse in the world than staying away from this girl, but having her pissed at him was a damn close second. In that moment, with the gravitational pull between them anchoring him more securely than the Earth\u2019s\u2026he was done keeping a protective distance. Standing in front of her, having her undivided attention, was healing unseen wounds all over his body, making him whole. He needed this. He needed her. No more staying away. He\u2019d been lucky to make it this long. \u201cThat kid isn\u2019t your boyfriend.\u201d Rory\u2019s breath came faster, his fingers twisting in the hem of her skirt, pure willpower stopping him from yanking her against his lap, the cock thickening behind his fly. Preparing to claim. \u201cIs he, sunbeam?\u201d Olive\u2019s eyes flashed, her breath shaky as she shook her head no. \u201cI only met him tonight. There\u2019s nothing there.\u201d Relief adhered to him like a second layer of skin. \u201cGood girl.\u201d \u201cShut up.\u201d Jamie chose that moment to enter, carrying the blue tin first-aid kit. In Rory\u2019s periphery, he saw his brother slow to a stop beside them, but he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the girl sitting atop the desk. How the fuck had he managed to keep his distance? \u201cWhoa.\u201d Jamie laughed under his breath. \u201cAre you going to introduce me?\u201d \u201cOlive,\u201d he managed. \u201cThis is my brother, Jamie.\u201d She put a hand on his chest to push him away, but he intercepted it and pressed his lips to the inside of her wrist instead, noting the way her pupils enlarged. Seemingly with an effort, she managed to turn her head in Jamie\u2019s direction. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI promise I don\u2019t need whatever is in that box.\u201d Jamie nodded once. \u201cUp to you, Olive. You might want to let us take a quick look, though, since it\u2019s bleeding\u2014\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d Olive slid off the desk, bringing herself flush against Rory and he was forced to turn his pained face away, a moan barely subdued in his throat. \u201cI left my friend Leanne out there. We\u2019re buddy system partners. I need to go get her.\u201d Her obvious distress jolted Rory. \u201cI\u2019ll go grab her.\u201d He lightly touched the cut on Olive\u2019s forehead and winced. \u201cWill you let Jamie bandage this? Please?\u201d After a moment, she nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ll be here when I get back, right?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Reluctant to leave her for a second in case she disappeared, Rory kept his gaze on her as long as possible while backing out of the office. Upon reentering the bar, he saw that the summer night energy had mostly returned to normal, pitchers being hoisted, couples making out near the neon internet jukebox, cigarette smoke drifting in from outside. Andrew was swamped behind the bar, but he waved Rory off in the universal sign for fuck off, I\u2019ll manage. It didn\u2019t take Rory much time at all to find Leanne where she leaned on the wall near the exit, looking worried. \u201cYou can\u2019t just carry girls off like that,\u201d was how she greeted him. \u201cWho told you that was normal?\u201d Rory scratched the side of his chin and bit back a smile. \u201cSorry about that. I wasn\u2019t aware the buddy system was in effect.\u201d She huffed a breath. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d \u201cYeah. Yeah, I\u2019m going to make sure she\u2019s okay.\u201d He jerked a thumb over his shoulder. \u201cYou want to come see for yourself?\u201d \u201cNo\u2026\u201d For the first time, Rory noticed the white smartphone she juggled from hand to hand. \u201cShe just texted me to ask if we can stay a while. But I\u2019m going to get an Uber home. Already called one.\u201d \u201cOlive wants to stay, does she?\u201d There was no stopping the kick of pleasure and anticipation from filling his belly. Need to get back to her. Need to touch her. He pushed open the exit with his left hand, gesturing for Leanne to precede him. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll walk you.\u201d \u201cFine.\u201d Leanne groused. \u201cI\u2019ll be the thing that earns your brownie points.\u201d They walked side by side out of the bar and down the ramp of the boardwalk where Leanne\u2019s Uber was waiting. Rory made a quick mental note of the license plate, waved goodnight and turned back toward the bar, already craving the scent of Olive again. But Leanne\u2019s voice drew him up short, forcing him to look back over her shoulder. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you hit that guy?\u201d The image of Olive shrinking away from him on the bar floor hit him hard. \u201cI was scaring her. I never want to scare her.\u201d Leanne opened the rear door of the car. \u201cFighting is only one of the ways you could do that,\u201d she said tonelessly. \u201cI hope you\u2019re paying attention.\u201d Rory spent the walk back to the Castle Gate trying to decipher what Leanne meant, but as soon as he walked through the entrance and the promise of Olive\u2019s presence beckoned, it fled to the back of his mind. Later. He\u2019d definitely figure it out later. \n CHAPTER NINE While Olive tried not to stare at the door and wait for Rory to return with Leanne, she remained still and let Jamie swab some Neosporin onto her cut and place a small Band-Aid over the abrasion. He never touched her skin directly, and Olive got the feeling he made the effort out of respect for Rory. Right or wrong, he was possessive of her, even though he\u2019d cut and run weeks ago. Then again\u2026in truth, he hadn\u2019t completely bailed, had he? Thank God her tingling flesh wasn\u2019t visible because she couldn\u2019t seem to make it stop. She should be righteously pissed that Rory had followed her bus to Stony Brook, but no matter how deep she dug down, trying to find her indignation, she couldn\u2019t locate it. Yes, that kind of behavior was unusual and\u2026intrusive. But if Olive acknowledged the truth? Rory could have had her any time he wanted. Any time he chose to step out of the shadows, she would have become starved for his body heat, same as she\u2019d done tonight in exactly three point eight seconds. He\u2019d truly followed her to class because he was worried. After all, she\u2019d almost walked in front of a bus, come close to drowning\u2026and tonight she\u2019d solidified her standing as World\u2019s Most Accident-Prone Individual. It wasn\u2019t a stretch for Rory to worry, was it? One thing Olive knew for sure. Knowing Rory had been caring for her from a distance shouldn\u2019t be turning her on so much. Even now, when he wasn\u2019t in the room, she had to concentrate to keep her breathing even. The way he\u2019d carried her into the office, the way he\u2019d looked at her, like all he needed was one word of encouragement and she\u2019d be his next meal. I should probably stop thinking filthy thoughts with his brother literally two feet away. Olive watched as Jamie swept the Band-Aid wrappers into his palm and tossed them into the trash. There was no denying she was curious about Rory. She\u2019d had weak moments over the last fourteen days where she\u2019d tried to find him on social media and failed miserably. In the world of Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter, he didn\u2019t even exist. She had a few minutes alone with Rory\u2019s brother now. Would it be so bad to satisfy some of her curiosity while she had the chance? \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d Jamie asked, before she could say a word. He lifted his head and gave her a half-smile, before posting up against the far wall. Until he struck a casual pose and crossed his arms, Olive hadn\u2019t seen a resemblance. But there it was. That head-tilting smirk Rory had employed on more than one occasion. Same green eyes, too, although Jamie\u2019s held more of a knowing twinkle, as opposed to the raw intensity of Rory\u2019s. All three of the Prince brothers were unique, yet each of them was insanely attractive. It really wasn\u2019t even fair. Again, Jamie spoke before she got the chance. \u201cHe\u2019s probably on the way back. Get those questions in while you can.\u201d Olive narrowed her eyes at Jamie, taking his measure. He did the same to her. Should she give him the satisfaction? Oh right, like she could help it. But first. To lull him into a false sense of security. \u201cDo you guys own this place?\u201d \u201cRory didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYeah. The three of us own the Castle Gate.\u201d Something flickered in his expression. \u201cTook it over from my father about four years back.\u201d She absorbed that. \u201cAnd the fight that sent Rory to prison\u2026what was it about?\u201d \u201cSorry, can\u2019t answer that one.\u201d He winked. \u201cHas to be his choice. Nice try, though.\u201d \u201cDamn.\u201d Jamie\u2019s mouth twitched, but his eyes were serious. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019d love to tell you, because it would help you understand him better.\u201d \u201cTell me something else that will help me understand him.\u201d He inclined his head. \u201cHe\u2019s been helping manage the bar for the last two weeks. Running payroll, scheduling deliveries, stocking the bar, even dabbling in online advertising. Took over for Andrew so he could focus on the beach.\u201d His expression was one of pure pride. \u201cHe\u2019s good at it, too.\u201d Two weeks, exactly? The change couldn\u2019t have something to do with her, could it? Jamie pointed at the office door. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen my brother back away from a fight like that. I didn\u2019t think he was physically capable of it.\u201d He raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat have you done to him?\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t been around to do anything. He made sure I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d She picked a piece of lint off her skirt. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know he worked here. We\u2019re only talking right now out of pure coincidence.\u201d \u201cAre we?\u201d Jamie pushed off the wall. \u201cYou guys have ended up in the same place quite a few times. Maybe it\u2019s less coincidence and more the universe trying to tell you something. And that\u2019s hard for a pragmatic economics teacher to admit.\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s the universe talking\u2026I wasn\u2019t afraid to listen to it the first time.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cBut I am now. I am now that he\u2019s left before. Now that I know how it feels to watch him go.\u201d Jamie paused near the door, a line forming between his brows. \u201cTrust me when I say that wasn\u2019t easy for him to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to do it again.\u201d \u201cYeah, exactly.\u201d She gave him a half-smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t think so.\u201d The door chose that moment to burst open, narrowly missing Jamie and careening off the office wall. Instead of Rory, in burst a giant man in a muscle T-shirt with a naked woman tattooed on his forearm. \u201cWhat happened? Someone told me there was a fight.\u201d He deflated when he saw Jamie, doubling over and propping his hands on his knees. \u201cOh shit, man, when I didn\u2019t see you behind the bar I thought you\u2019d gotten caught up in the fight.\u201d He straightened with a too-loud laugh. \u201cSo, uh. Okay. Never mind. All\u2019s well that ends well. And you\u2019re\u2026I mean, you seem well, Jamie Prince.\u201d He scrubbed at the back of his neck. \u201cAre you?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Jamie pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cGo back to work, Marcus.\u201d \u201cYup. Soon as you do.\u201d He crossed his beefy arms, the poster boy for refusing to budge. \u201cWho\u2019s the girl? Did you change your mind about liking dudes?\u201d Jamie clasped his hands together. \u201cWhy yes, it\u2019s just something that happens on a whim.\u201d Marcus squinted one eye. \u201cWait. Really?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Jamie shoved at the man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMove it, dumbass. Andrew is probably ready to kill me for leaving him in the weeds this long\u2014and before you ask\u2014no, my brother isn\u2019t really ready to kill me. It\u2019s just an expression.\u201d A beat passed. \u201cYou called me a dumbass.\u201d Rory\u2019s brother sighed as they both passed through the doorframe. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Marcus. I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d Olive was still trying to absorb both her conversation with Jamie, followed by the oddly endearing dynamic between him and Marcus, when Rory returned. And yeah, wow. Wow, her thighs just kind of melted into the desk and the oxygen in the room turned as thick as soup. Just like that. Olive wanted to maintain her anger at him, but she couldn\u2019t. Not when he looked so relieved to find her still there. \u201cWhere is Leanne?\u201d \u201cPut her in an Uber. She\u2019s good.\u201d He reached out and caught her hand, massaging her palm with his thumb. An action Olive swore she could feel right between her legs. \u201cWill you come out with me, sunbeam?\u201d Rory murmured into her wrist, letting his tongue snake out and brand her skin. \u201cThere\u2019s a place down the street where everyone I know won\u2019t be watching us.\u201d Should she do this? Open herself up for more potential disappointment and pain? When she might have said no and let self-preservation win the day, a little reminder piped up in the back of her mind. That damning certainty that she could walk from one end of the earth to the other and no one might make her feel like Rory ever again. This time, though\u2026 she needed to keep her guard up. \u201cOlive?\u201d She took a bracing breath. \u201cOkay, Rory. For a little while.\u201d * Olive hadn\u2019t found any of the bars that night particularly inspiring. Inside they all seemed to look pretty much the same. Flat-screen televisions in every corner, loud conversation, louder music, the same glowing row of jewel tone liquor bottles on the shelves. Since she\u2019d only been inside the Castle Gate for all of two minutes before Zed picked a fight with a stranger who\u2019d stepped on his foot, she wasn\u2019t afforded much of an opportunity to look around. As Rory led her through the crowd and out the door, however, she couldn\u2019t deny something set it apart. The memorabilia on the walls was from another time. Sawdust decorated the floor and the aroma of it, mixed with spilled beer, made her think of some spirited, medieval gathering. There were televisions, but they weren\u2019t blaring\u2014and one of them actually appeared to be showing classic game show reruns. A traditional Irish song ended and Radiohead began and no one seemed to notice the contrast. Olive did, though. Felt the bass and moodiness of it seep into her veins as they walked out into the cooling night. A hunger she\u2019d only experienced for this man thrummed in all of her erogenous zones and the nearby ocean sounds tickled her with romance. Lust and romance. That combination would make it especially difficult to keep up her guard. Rory pulled her into the warmth of his body, gently kissing the bandage on her head. \u201cPoor sunbeam.\u201d Ah geez. Safe to say she was in trouble. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d He glanced down at Olive, seeming to choose his words. \u201cYou were drinking tonight.\u201d She made a sound of agreement. \u201cA little.\u201d \u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d \u201cKind of. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve found my alcohol soul mate yet, though.\u201d She made a face. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not beer.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d like a white Russian. It tastes like a milkshake.\u201d \u201cAre you taking me to get one?\u201d \u201cNo, underage drinker. I\u2019m not.\u201d He tickled her ribs and she half laughed, half gasped at the contact. \u201cI\u2019m not drinking, either. I rode my bike here tonight.\u201d His fingertips brushed up the side of her arm, then stroked back down. \u201cNormally that wouldn\u2019t keep me from having a beer, but not tonight. Not when I\u2019m driving you home.\u201d Her stomach flipped. \u201cI get to ride on it?\u201d Rory pulled her to a stop at the boardwalk railing and they faced each other, slow, sticky heat meandering down her breasts and belly. They gravitated closer as if unable to help it and Olive\u2019s head tipped back until the ends of her hair tickled her shoulder blades. He wanted to kiss her, she could see it. Her mouth softened at a moment\u2019s notice, but the kiss never came, despite their obvious need of it. \u201cDoes the idea of riding on my bike make you nervous?\u201d With anyone else? Absolutely. With this man? She couldn\u2019t imagine a scenario where he\u2019d allow a hair on her head to be harmed. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not nervous.\u201d Still not ready to let him off the hook for the last two weeks, she tried to pull off a casual shrug. \u201cI saw you on the bike today. At a stoplight. You seemed to handle it proficiently, I guess.\u201d He reared back a touch. \u201cYou saw me. Where?\u201d \u201cOutside that coffee shop on East Park Avenue.\u201d She rolled her lips inward to wet them. \u201cI was on the fence about whether to come out tonight, but when I saw you just going about your business, I said yes. I was finished waiting for a call that would never come.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWhy am I telling you this?\u201d \u201cBecause you want to torture me,\u201d he rasped. True to his words, his expression was pained as he pressed his lips to her forehead, brushing a kiss there. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Olive hummed, digging her fingernails into her palms to keep from tracing every inch of his body with her hands. Tugging him closer and anchoring herself with his heat, like she yearned to do. \u201cThe kids you were with tonight\u2026\u201d He caught her hair where it flew around in the wind, holding it in a light fist. \u201cYou go to school with those guys?\u201d \u201cStop calling them kids. Most of them are older than me.\u201d A single eyebrow went up. \u201cWant to know what I\u2019d prefer to call them?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly, battling a smile. \u201cYes, we go to school together\u2014and once again for the cheap seats, you don\u2019t have the right to be jealous.\u201d His eyelids fell to half-mast. \u201cOh no?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d Rory\u2019s mouth dropped to hers without warning, pushing, his upper lip curling against hers. Their breath collided and hastened, his fingers slipping into her hair and gripping. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this with anyone else. For either of us. Is it?\u201d Olive shook her head once, quickly, in a hurry to get back to their almost kiss. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI want the right to be jealous, Olive. I\u2019m working on it. While I get there, let\u2019s not pretend this thing between us follows the usual rules. It doesn\u2019t.\u201d He kissed her hard. No tongue. Just an unrelenting suction of lips desperate for contact from which he pulled back way too soon, his breathing labored. \u201cI don\u2019t notice girls anymore. Not for weeks. There\u2019s only one.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d she heard herself say, the word emerging from some deep, earthy part of her. \u201cExactly. Good. That\u2019s what you want, whether or not it\u2019s supposed to be too soon.\u201d Kiss me. Kiss me. Kiss me. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cBecause there are no fucking rules for us. So I\u2019m going to wake up in a cold sweat tonight thinking of that kid\u2019s arm around you.\u201d \u201cHis name is Zed and I couldn\u2019t stand him.\u201d Rory puffed a laugh and rolled their foreheads together. \u201cGood girl.\u201d They stayed that way for long moments, swaying side to side, their mouths hovering so close she could taste the mint on his breath. His thumbs massaged her scalp. It was exactly where she wanted to be, even though every second with Rory seemed to hold a fine edge of uncertainty. He was so unpredictable. Every action, every word, his thoughts. She couldn\u2019t even predict herself around him. Yet at the same time, she wouldn\u2019t budge from that spot on the boardwalk if a meteor was hurtling toward earth. \u201cEven though I couldn\u2019t stand him, I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t fight tonight,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you for stopping.\u201d Rory melted into her, pushing his face into the crook of her neck. Inhaling. \u201cYeah?\u201d \u201cUh huh.\u201d \u201cTurns out the one thing worse than watching you fall down is seeing you scared of me. Really scared. Like you didn\u2019t know me.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared of you, Rory. I was scared for you.\u201d He lifted his head, searching her face with a questioning expression. Olive gave in to her impulses, sliding her hands up beneath his T-shirt and resting them on his chest, thrilling at the way his heart kicked into an erratic rhythm under her palms. \u201cWhen you told me about the man you put in the hospital, you were so sad. I don\u2019t think you like fighting. I was scared tonight of you doing something else you\u2019d regret.\u201d Her fingernails moved in a light circle over his heart. \u201cYou got it backwards. I was looking at you like I knew you.\u201d Rory stared down at her. \u201cIf you keep looking at me just like this, I\u2019ll never use my fists again.\u201d Finally, he rode his open mouth over hers, letting their tongues flick together, dance away and stroke back, the kiss deepening on a mutual groan. Olive\u2019s back was pressed to the boardwalk rail, Rory\u2019s right arm sliding between the barrier and her hips, urging her up and into the cradle of his body. When her tummy met the stiffness behind the fly of his jeans, she broke the kiss on a gasp, her head falling back and allowing Rory to raze the curve of her neck with his teeth, his forearm yanking her up on her toes. Closer, close as humanly possible. \u201cRory.\u201d His mouth traveled lower and Olive felt damp heat through the thin silk of her tank top, right over her nipple. Felt his lips close around the bud, a male groan vibrating her head to toe. His hair was a mess by the time their mouths were level again, his eyes glazed. \u201cYeah, baby?\u201d Olive gathered her courage and reached for the thing she needed more than oxygen in that moment. Him. Them. Alone. \u201cDo you have the ingredients at your house to make me a white Russian?\u201d A small fraction of the lust displayed on his face was replaced by hesitancy\u2014and Olive\u2019s stomach twisted at the proof that he was still not a hundred percent into this. Them. Still thought she was too young, he was too wrong. Too bad. That his past had caused too much damage. Whatever the reason, her guard was already shooting back into place to prevent the inevitable hurt\u2014 \u201cYeah. I\u2019ve got the ingredients to make a minor a drink.\u201d With a dry half-smile, he twined their fingers together and tugged her toward the boardwalk steps, which led to the sidewalk and the town beyond. \u201cCome on, sunbeam. Let\u2019s go break the law.\u201d \n CHAPTER TEN Rory inhaled deeply and held his breath, just so Olive\u2019s fingertips would bite into his chest. Fuck, it felt amazing. Her thighs were wrapped around his hips and the purr of his bike\u2019s engine caused just enough friction to poke holes in his self-control. Thank God, too. Lust was distracting him from the possibility of getting in an accident. They were only riding fifteen blocks and he\u2019d given her his helmet. At nearly one in the morning, the avenues were quiet. He\u2019d never been in so much as a scrape on his bike. And yet, there was a fine layer of sweat on his skin over having the responsibility of Olive holding on to him for her safety, his eyes straining while searching for potholes or jaywalkers on the road ahead. Was he actually bringing Olive home? Forget the fact that the Prince bachelor pad needed a serious facelift and Olive was probably used to much finer surroundings. He was more worried about what happened when they arrived. Would she stay the night? Rory\u2019s molars ground together as blood rushed below his belt. Jesus, he hadn\u2019t forgotten over the last two weeks what it was like to kiss Olive, but he must have suppressed the full experience of it so he wouldn\u2019t lose his mind while staying away from her. When her mouth opened beneath his, the rush was potent enough to clear his mind of anything but getting more. Absorbing the texture of her mouth, the flesh under his hands. His sole purpose became giving and taking and giving and taking until normal functions like breathing became an afterthought. She was breathing. A large part of Rory still warned him to stay away from Olive. She was the kind of girl a man worked a lifetime to keep. He\u2019d only been busting his ass for two weeks. That was nothing. He\u2019d done nothing to deserve the trusting hands molded to his chest. The stigma of his past choices would always follow him around and, in turn, Olive, if they stayed together. If they stayed together? Rory laughed silently and without humor. He hadn\u2019t really let her go in the first place, had he? Following her to class, riding past her building on the off chance he\u2019d catch a glimpse. Now they\u2019d found their way back into one another\u2019s lives and she would probably spend the night in his bed. They were together. There was no going back. Not for him. He would die before putting that kind of pressure on her, though. This intelligent girl with the fucking world at her disposal, as it should be. So Rory made a deal with himself. One that made his throat tighten and fear of the unknown take root. He\u2019d allow himself to have Olive. He\u2019d give her everything he knew how. If she decided someday that it wasn\u2019t enough, he\u2019d force himself to accept it. Rory was still having a hard time swallowing as they pulled up in front of the house. He climbed off the bike, unhooking the helmet strap carefully from beneath her chin, his fingers unusually clumsy because he couldn\u2019t concentrate around that smile. \u201cThat was\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cAddictive,\u201d she breathed, running her hands over the body of his bike. \u201cI want one.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cExcuse me?\u201d Rory wrapped his hands around Olive\u2019s waist and plucked her off the bike. \u201cDo we need reminding about the walking in front of a bus incident? How about your near-drowning experience?\u201d He took her hand and led her up the stoop to his front door, which he unlocked with a quick twist of the keys. \u201cNow you\u2019ve got a gash on your head. My heart can\u2019t take it, sunbeam. Don\u2019t do me like this.\u201d \u201cSorry. I\u2019m duty bound as a woman to get a motorcycle now because a man told me no.\u201d She gave him a pitying look. \u201cI already decided on a red one.\u201d \u201cOlive,\u201d he growled, picking her up as they entered the kitchen. She squealed and twisted in his arms, leaving their bodies melded together and her feet off the ground. He opened his mouth to tell her once again, in no uncertain terms, he\u2019d watch her ride a motorcycle over his dead body. Instead, he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I teach you how to ride mine and we\u2019ll see how it goes? Her smile sent his heart up into his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019ll really teach me?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d God, he had it so fucking bad. \u201cYou\u2019re already going to be the death of me. Just make sure you\u2019re not the death of you, too.\u201d There they were again, their bodies straining to get closer, their mouths poised in that just about to kiss position, chests beginning to heave. Rory\u2019s dick was in full protest mode, making its argument for instant gratification with a torturous throb. He could kiss her now, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop\u2026and God help him, he actually wanted to take it slow. Take it slow. Rory wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever played that phrase in his head before, let alone spoken it aloud. So be it. He\u2019d just come home to an empty house with the girl who ruled his every waking thought. They were surrounded in quiet and all time restraints had faded away, making them two people coming home from a long day. Kind of like playing house, except his intentions were far more adult in nature. Simply put, he wanted the experience of witnessing Olive in his kitchen, in his staircase. Wanted to hear her footsteps on the floorboards. Reluctantly, he eased Olive to her feet with a kiss to the forehead. \u201cWant me to show you around?\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d she murmured, visibly shaking herself. \u201cYes.\u201d He laced their fingers together, unable to stop himself from kissing her knuckles, brushing them with his thumb. \u201cThere\u2019s a front door, but we never use it. We just come in through the kitchen.\u201d \u201cWhat is that?\u201d She pointed at the big, dented steel container sitting on the counter beside the stove. \u201cThose are Jiya\u2019s spices.\u201d He led her over to the metal drum and popped off the lid, revealing the compartments within. \u201cThese are kind of the staple Indian spices. Black mustard seeds, dried chili pepper, hardar\u2014that\u2019s turmeric powder\u2014and a cumin coriander mixture.\u201d He smiled. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for her, we\u2019d probably eat nothing but takeout. She makes us help, though, so we\u2019re getting better. I can make khichdi now without looking at the recipe.\u201d She leaned in and sniffed the spices. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be your first.\u201d Olive\u2019s eyes shot to his, drifting low to his mouth. Pink climbed her neck and Rory barely resisted following that color change with his tongue. \u201cUm, speaking of firsts\u2026\u201d Olive said huskily. \u201cI believe I\u2019m owed a white Russian.\u201d Rory sighed through a smile. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d forget.\u201d She leaned a hip against the counter. \u201cYou\u2019re really in a moral quandary over giving me one alcoholic beverage?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d After dragging a hand through his hair, he reached into the cabinet above the stove and took out their resident bottle of Absolut vodka. \u201cI really am.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in college. It\u2019s the designated time for drunken revelry.\u201d Rory took a clean glass out of the dishwasher and filled it with ice from the fridge. He measured out vodka, Kahlua and milk, then dumped all the contents into a martini shaker, watching her through narrowed eyes as he mixed and cooled the ingredients. \u201cI made it light.\u201d She kept her attention on his face as he transferred the icy, light brown concoction back into the glass. \u201cYou know,\u201d she started. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d The pink climbed from her neck to her cheeks, making her skin flushed and even more sexy than usual. \u201cWell, if I\u2019m d-dating someone who works at a bar, I\u2019ll probably have a drink once in a while, right?\u201d His cock grew uncomfortably heavy over the word dating. I\u2019m going to take this girl on dates. Bring her home afterward. Have her all to myself. Was this even reality? \u201cYeah, you probably will,\u201d he said, his voice low. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, he slid her the drink across the counter. \u201cSometimes I equate alcohol with bad decisions. My own, especially. But you helped me make a good one tonight and\u2026I just want to do the same for you. As often as I can.\u201d Her gray eyes were inquisitive, always reading between the lines. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably seen a lot of people make bad decisions in the bar.\u201d A beat passed wherein he said nothing. \u201cWhat about at home?\u201d Rory tried to clear the sudden clutter in his throat. \u201cMy dad drank some,\u201d he said, turning away to put the bottles back in their places. \u201cA lot, actually.\u201d \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Rory answered, still unable to look at her. \u201cMy mother is in Bayside, though. Living with her sister back in Queens where she grew up,\u201d he said, trading one uncomfortable subject for another. He couldn\u2019t seem to keep himself from telling Olive the shit in his head, though. Not when she projected total understanding and a lack of judgment that made him forget things like secrets and uncomfortable truths. \u201cHer birthday is next week, actually.\u201d Olive studied him. \u201cAre you going?\u201d Rory shook his head. \u201cI never go. I\u2026can\u2019t.\u201d Finished with his task of putting away the bottles and closing the cabinets, he stuck his hands on his hips. Breathed in and out. \u201cI haven\u2019t gone to see her since everything happened. Since I went away when I was eighteen. So I\u2019ve missed more than a couple.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a long time.\u201d She slipped her hand around the cocktail but made no move to pick it up. \u201cWhy do you stay away?\u201d As always, when he thought of his mother, he remembered the look on her face in the courtroom the day he was sentenced. She\u2019d raised three boys and lived with an abusive husband, so she\u2019d known disappointment well. Still, he\u2019d never seen it line her face more deeply than it had that day. \u201cJamie and Andrew weren\u2019t living in the house when it happened. I was the only one left here with my parents. I could run interference with my father. Make sure I was home when he was drinking and feeling mean. He\u2019d stopped putting his hands on her by then or he knew what would happen.\u201d Rory rubbed at the ache in his sternum, but the friction only made it worse. \u201cThere was nothing to stop him once I was put away, Olive. I can\u2019t believe I left her alone with him. If I\u2019d been there, I would have saved her.\u201d \u201cRory,\u201d she whispered, her face pained. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for your mother. No one should have to live in fear like that. But you can\u2019t punish yourself for something that happened so long ago. Even if you hadn\u2019t gone away, you couldn\u2019t have stayed here forever. I don\u2019t know your mother, but I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t have wanted to put the responsibility of protecting her on you. Not indefinitely. It wouldn\u2019t have been fair.\u201d Olive kept coming toward him until she laid her head on his chest, wrapping her arms around his waist. \u201cYou\u2019ve been feeling guilty enough to stay away for six years. If you ever tell me again you\u2019re a bad guy, I\u2019m going to\u2026to\u2026\u201d Rory tried to be quiet about letting go of the breath he\u2019d been holding. \u201cWhat, sunbeam?\u201d \u201cPout. I\u2019ll pout.\u201d Jesus. Rory had never felt lighter in his life. He\u2019d just told this girl the ugly truth about his family and how he\u2019d been carrying the responsibility for his mother\u2019s pain\u2026and she seemed to have found something beautiful in the midst of so much ugly. She hadn\u2019t even taken the time to think about whether or not he was to blame, simply declaring he wasn\u2019t. God, how tempting it was to believe her, but he\u2019d been packed to the gills with regret and guilt for so long, he could only let a small degree of it go. \u201cHow will you pout? Show me.\u201d She tilted her head back so Rory could see her duck lips and thunderous frown. \u201cHow is this? Are you scared?\u201d \u201cAh, baby. I\u2019m terrified.\u201d Olive smiled and planted a kiss over his heart. The gesture started casual, but they made eye contact while her lips were still pressed to the spot and the atmosphere changed. There was an awareness on Olive\u2019s face that said she heard the wild rapping of that organ against his rib cage. Both of their breathing changed and in an instant, the closeness of their bodies was no longer meant to comfort. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the birthday party with you,\u201d Olive murmured, shifting her sweet curves against him. \u201cIf you want.\u201d A knot formed in his throat. \u201cYou would do that for me?\u201d She nodded. \u201cPromise.\u201d Trying to disguise how much that offer humbled him, Rory swallowed hard, reaching over to pick up the drink he\u2019d made and holding it to her lips. \u201cTake a sip. I\u2019m not going to inflict my hang-ups on you. Ever. Understand?\u201d When Olive nodded and did as she was told, watching him silently over the rim of the glass, he was jealous over the cool liquid that met and slid across her tongue, down her throat. Fuck, just watching her take the sip made his balls feel twice their usual weight. If he didn\u2019t kiss her soon, he was going to go mad. She licked her lips after she\u2019d taken her fill, and Rory cinched his hips forward, just enough to inform her of the effect she had. Constantly. Her lids fluttered, her pupils blocking out some of the gray of her irises, and she murmured his name like a prayer. Rory set the glass down and plowed his hands into her hair, holding fast as he walked her backward toward the staircase. The one that led to his bedroom. Even as a voice in the back of his head reminded him he wasn\u2019t good enough to be Olive\u2019s first time, the gravitational pull between them wasn\u2019t giving him a choice. He needed her. He needed her. But his conscience forced him to offer one more out. One more, before he lost sight of the right thing to do. \u201cI can bring you home,\u201d he rasped, grazing their lips together. \u201cJust say the word.\u201d Olive\u2019s breath caught as she scrutinized him, the importance of what could happen once they got upstairs written in her eyes. Probably his, too. \u201cI\u2019m staying.\u201d \n CHAPTER ELEVEN Olive was ready to get naked before they reached the top of the stairs. Pretty intrepid for a girl who\u2019d only gone as far as kissing with a member of the opposite sex\u2014and some on-top-of-the-clothes groping once at church camp, but it had been so unskilled and awkward, she\u2019d stricken it from the record. Rory would not be unskilled. One need only to examine the facts to arrive at such a conclusion. Oh God, did she mentally monologue in essay format when she was turned on? Whatever. It was helping keep her focused. And she wanted to remember every single moment of tonight. So. Facts. He wasn\u2019t rushed. Hadn\u2019t even kissed her yet, merely walking her into the dark bedroom and breathing against her lips. Breathing, rubbing their mouths together, humming. Stroking her hair and every so often reminding her of the raised flesh behind his fly. This wasn\u2019t a young, inexperienced guy with his orgasm on a hair trigger. He was seducing her even though there was no need. She\u2019d been seduced the morning they\u2019d shared milkshakes. Rory ran his thumbs in hook patterns behind her ears, massaging the spots she didn\u2019t even know were sensitive. What else did he know about her body she didn\u2019t? When she woke up tomorrow morning, what secrets would she have learned? Excitement raced up and down her arms like spiky pinwheels, clashing with nerves to leave her trembling, breathless. He made her breathless. This man who carried so much weight on his shoulders. She wanted to take it away from him, distract him from it for as long as possible. Remembering his tortured expression back in the kitchen, the sharp ache in her chest flared to life again. He\u2019d been through so much\u2014and while she still didn\u2019t know the extent of it, she knew a man who lamented letting down his mother to such a degree was good at his core. And Olive could feel the truth of his goodness with every treasuring caress of her skin, every awed glance he sent in her direction. She was going to give herself to this man, wholeheartedly, because staying away was impossible. Painful, even. Please, please don\u2019t let me regret it. Don\u2019t let me find out again what it\u2019s like to see him go. Wanting to forget her remaining reservations about the future, Olive wet her lips, her voice emerging in a smoky croak. \u201cUm, so. Are you planning on kissing me soon?\u201d He made a low sound in his throat, just as the back of her legs met the edge of the mattress. \u201cNot yet, baby.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d The husky way he said baby caused moisture to gather between her thighs, making the thin material of her panties cling. \u201cWhy?\u201d Rory pressed their foreheads together. \u201cYou get so hot when we kiss. Trying to climb me and letting out those sexy, little whimper sounds.\u201d He unwound his fingers from her hair, dropping them to her hips and squeezing. \u201cI\u2019m already hard as a fucking rock for you, Olive. Going slow is probably going to kill me, but my mind is set. I\u2019m giving you the best I\u2019ve got.\u201d The threads of yearning and determination in his tone made her nod jerkily. Made her understand. Rory needed to make tonight special, just as much as she needed it to be. Just this once, she needed to trust that someone else\u2019s experience trumped her always-at-the-ready logic, the belief she knew what was best for herself. Just for tonight, she would trust Rory to know and give her exactly what she needed. \u201cOn the bed,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cWant to hold you for a while.\u201d Olive almost sobbed at being denied more kissing, but remembering her resolve to let Rory guide them, she sat down on the bed and scooted toward the headboard. Though the interior of the room was dark, the moonlight coming in through the single window allowed her to watch Rory render himself shirtless and prowl toward her like a sleek, tattooed animal on the mattress. When she swore he was going to climb on top of her\u2014and prayed he would\u2014he carefully removed her glasses and set them on his nightstand. Then he dropped down beside Olive, turned her body and spooned her from behind. His heavy forearm draped over her hip, and after a slight hesitation, he drew her back and pressed her backside tighttighttight to his lap, releasing a long groan into her ear. \u201cThis ass of yours is ruining my life, baby, you know that? So high and sweet it hurts.\u201d His tongue dragged down the slope of her neck, his teeth razing her shoulder. \u201cEvery part of you. Every part is so beautiful, I can\u2019t think straight. Can\u2019t decide what to appreciate first. Do I want to wrap your thighs around my head? Or just get those incredible eyes on me and fucking live there, because I should be grateful you\u2019re looking at me in the first place? It\u2019s a goddamn struggle, sunbeam. You don\u2019t even know.\u201d The pressure Rory always created in her chest multiplied in strength now, pushing outward, robbing her of oxygen. Needing to get as close as humanly possible, she curled her foot around his calf, tucked her head back into the notch of his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s the same for me. I want to do anything for you,\u201d she rambled, her eyes closed. \u201cI want to do anything with you. Maybe it was too soon? I-I don\u2019t know, but it hurt so bad when you went away.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he grated into Olive\u2019s hair, yanking her closer, ever closer, dislodging her foot when he slung a muscular thigh over both of hers. \u201cGod, I\u2019m so fucking sorry.\u201d She shook off the niggling fear of it happening again and changed the subject, refusing to dwell there when they were finally together like this. \u201cTouch me, Rory. Please?\u201d What happened next was the most erotic moment of her life. Which was saying something considering this man had performed oral on her in a public shower. Rory\u2019s fingertips slid slowly, slowly down her hip, moving beneath the high hem of her skirt. His breathing turned shallow at the back of her neck as he drew up the garment, inch by inch. Air kissed the flesh of Olive\u2019s bare backside and she dug her fingers into the flannel bedcovers, feeling his hot perusal of what he\u2019d displayed. A blunt digit tucked under the thin strip of her thong, running back and forth, the action causing his knuckle to drag through the split of her bottom\u2014and oh boy. Still mostly clothed and she was already learning secrets about her body, because she\u2019d had no clue a man\u2019s touch there was supposed to feel good. No, amazing. \u201cRory\u2014\u201d \u201cGive me a minute,\u201d he gritted out, that knuckle continuing it\u2019s back and forth journey, his breath hot on her neck. \u201cI know you\u2019ll go out with friends once in a while, Olive. I want you to. But can you save the short skirt and thong combo for nights out with Rory? Huh?\u201d His possessiveness should have been a turn-off. Right? Lord, it was not. Not even a little bit. It made her feel feminine and powerful and protected all at once. \u201cI was hoping I\u2019d see you.\u201d Halfway through that revelation, Rory let the strap of her thong snap lightly between her buns and Olive saw stars, forcing her to break off in a gasp. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to, but\u2014\u201d Rory\u2019s mouth suctioned hard to the side of her neck, his big hand gripping her right butt cheek in a rough massage. \u201cDo we have a deal, baby?\u201d His tongue licked over the spot on her neck where he\u2019d definitely left a mark. \u201cWhen it\u2019s this easy for someone to get their hands on your beautiful ass, I want to be with you. Because that won\u2019t be happening. Not unless it\u2019s me.\u201d He squeezed hard enough to make her sob. \u201cOnly these hands touch you here. Everywhere. My life flashed in front of my fucking eyes when I saw that guy\u2019s arm around your shoulders, so I\u2019m going to be a bastard about this one thing, Olive. Please. Make the deal.\u201d \u201cNo thong and short skirt combo when I go out,\u201d she hiccupped, pressing back into his touch, craving more of it the more she was given. \u201cNot unless you\u2019re with me. I promise.\u201d \u201cGood girl.\u201d Before she could guess his intentions, Rory rolled Olive onto her back and slid down low on the bed, putting his mouth on level with her sex. His expression was focused and hungry as he stripped off her thong, exposing her for only a second before his tongue found her in a teasing lick that parted her wet folds. \u201cNow I\u2019ll show you my end of the deal,\u201d he said thickly, kissing the lips between her thighs in the same manner he would her mouth. \u201cKeep this all for me and I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s always satisfied.\u201d Rory\u2019s calloused fingers made a V to keep her open for his mouth, and with eyelids at half-mast, he dragged the flat of his tongue over her clit, back and forth, side to side. Side to side. Olive\u2019s vision wavered, a cry of his name sticking in her throat. Lights winked on the ceiling of Rory\u2019s bedroom briefly resembling the big dipper, her fingers tangling in his hair. Rory almost knocked her hold on the strands free when he slung her thighs over his broad shoulders, but Olive held fast, whimpering at the new angles the position made available. \u201cGoddamn, baby. So wet,\u201d Rory growled, his shoulders flexing underneath her thighs, his hips shifting against the edge of the bed. \u201cI spend every second of the day wanting to eat you up for a good reason. Your pussy is a drug. My fucking drug.\u201d A hard shudder went through Olive\u2019s body. She\u2019d always pictured her first time as a necessary evil. A gateway to eventual better things. But here she was, grinding herself onto Rory\u2019s giving tongue, pulling his face closer, babbling incoherently up at the stars that continued to wink on the ceiling. Her thighs alternated between a melted butter sensation and bow-tight quickening, her throat straining with the need to scream. Better wasn\u2019t possible. \u201cOh my God. S-stop. I\u2019m going to\u2026\u201d Rory\u2019s thumb tucked just inside her entrance, rubbing at the flesh beyond. \u201cYou\u2019re going to come? Good.\u201d His eyes were glazed and hot, fastened to Olive\u2019s face as he flickered his tongue against her clit, once, twice. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when I lick your pussy, baby. Just give in.\u201d A tether snapped inside of Olive and a hot river of relief tore through her, throwing her back up into an arch, her fingers tearing at Rory\u2019s hair. His mouth was no longer teasing, no longer finessing. No, he was greedy. While her private flesh seized, released, seized, he lapped at her, making low sounds in his throat, as if he couldn\u2019t get enough of her taste. That visible enjoyment prolonged Olive\u2019s orgasm until her sides started to throb with the strain. When her vision cleared, Rory was above her, his harsh, handsome face shadowed, his hair a wreck from her desperate fingers. \u201cWe can stop now,\u201d he said on a shaking exhale and Olive saw he\u2019d unfastened his pants, one hand out of sight inside the loosened denim, forearm flexing, flexing, as he stroked himself. \u201cI can stop,\u201d he rasped, as if trying to convince himself. \u201cNo,\u201d she breathed, physically aching with the need to have their skin pressed together. So much so that she whipped her tank top off, her shaking fingers fumbling with the front snap of her strapless bra. \u201cCome here. Please? Come\u2026\u201d Rory laid his warm hand on top of hers, lowering his mouth and distracting her with a kiss as he undid her bra, pushing the silky cups aside and palming her right breast. She could feel the weight of his erection drop to her bare belly, full and hard. \u201cI want you on top of me,\u201d she said in a thready rush. She couldn\u2019t decipher his exact expression. It had notes of wonder, disbelief and deep sexual frustration. But it was intense enough to stall the rapid filling and emptying of her lungs. Rory braced his forearms on either side of her and eased down, giving Olive his weight little by little, both of them moaning at the contact. \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he groaned into her neck. \u201cYou\u2019re wrecking me, sunbeam.\u201d Olive hadn\u2019t known the meaning of the word decadence until that moment. Or at the very least, she\u2019d always associated it with chocolate. There was nothing more decadent on the planet than having Rory\u2019s weight pressing her down into the soft mattress, though. His skin was hot and fragrant with his distinct male scent, cut with the sharpness of liquor and fruit, probably because he\u2019d been handling both at the bar. She could feel every shift of muscle in his abdomen, chest, thighs. Needing more\u2014more\u2014Olive slid her thighs wider and hooked her knees around Rory\u2019s legs, conforming the arches of her feet to his calf muscles. While she was busy reveling in the various textures of Rory, his breath was turning more and more shallow in her neck, his hips beginning to grind down, pushing the hard length of his arousal into her pelvis. His mouth opened beneath her ear, pressing seeking kisses to the ultra-sensitive spot. \u201cYou\u2019re so sexy,\u201d he whispered, laving her with his tongue. \u201cSo beautiful. So fucking beautiful. Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m with you like this.\u201d She dragged her palms down the ridges of his back, straight into the loose waistband of his jeans, past the barrier of his boxer briefs. When her hands elevated and slid over the smooth curves of his ass, the decadence reached an even higher peak, because Rory made it obvious he liked her hands there. Liked having her hands anywhere. \u201cI want you inside me,\u201d she murmured, letting her nails score his buttocks lightly, then with more insistence as he panted. \u201cRory, please.\u201d Olive lifted her hips and tugged his lower body closer at the same time. \u201cI can feel how bad you need me.\u201d A vibration ran the length of him. \u201cS\u2019never going to go away,\u201d he half-slurred in her ear, before dragging his mouth down her neck, over her cleavage, where he licked a nipple into his mouth, his hips punching against her on the first suck. \u201cBe sure, Olive. Are you sure?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she moaned as he switched breasts. \u201cI want you. Now.\u201d Rory surged over her, stopping to kiss her mouth hard, before reaching for his bedside table. He took a foil packet out of the drawer and ripped it open with his teeth, his hand vanishing between them to cover his erection. Olive\u2019s relentless curiosity made her anxious to watch the process, but there would be ample time for that later. Watching the pucker of Rory\u2019s forehead and the sweat beading on his upper lip was far more enjoyable. He was suffering. Going through hell in his hunger to be inside her body\u2014how amazing was that? It was even more amazing that she could end that pain, simply by giving her own body what it cried out for. Contact. Rory. Relief. Intimacy with this man. He didn\u2019t push inside her right away. No, he dropped his forehead to Olive\u2019s and rolled it side to side, eyes closed, as if in denial. She was prepared to beg again, to fight against whatever obstacles he\u2019d inflated between them in his mind. In the end, there was no need, though. Rory fastened his mouth to hers and trailed a hand down her stomach, taking hold of his thick sex, rubbing the big head through her wealth of moisture. \u201cGive me the words, sunbeam,\u201d he said, his eyes arrested on her face. \u201cAsk for what you want by name.\u201d She shuddered as his flesh glided over her clit, circling it. \u201cYou, I want you.\u201d \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d He pushed the tip of his erection inside of Olive, his jaw losing power as he groaned. \u201cWhat do you want from this cock?\u201d God above, was she supposed to love it so much when he said that word? Olive licked her parched lips and arched her back, showing him her breasts and watching his eyes glaze. \u201cI want to\u2026\u201d She reached for the basest truth she could find. \u201cI want to watch you enjoy me. Enjoy\u2026fucking m-me. I want you to give yourself an orgasm with my body.\u201d Rory made a hoarse sound and tucked another inch inside of her. Another. Olive\u2019s knees shot up automatically as discomfort threatened, but Rory\u2019s kiss blurred everything. Everything. All she could feel and think about was the slow, wet mating of their tongues, the savoring scrapes of sound in his throat as the kiss turned deeper, deep enough that she grew dizzy, giddiness tickling her ribs\u2026and her thighs dropped open once more. \u201cYou left out the part about you coming again, baby,\u201d Rory murmured in between mind-numbing kisses. \u201cWe fuck, you come. It\u2019s a given, you understand?\u201d Feeling hypnotized by a pair of intense, green eyes, she nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going deeper now,\u201d he groaned, rocking his hips forward and letting loose a string of curses over her head. \u201cOlive. Olive. You\u2019re too tight. You\u2019re so tight.\u201d The sudden pressure wrenched a sob from Olive\u2019s throat. Moisture pricked the backs of her eyelids. It was more the shock of being filled for the first time than actual pain. And the satisfaction of having Rory\u2019s body locked together with her own was so powerful and right, she wanted to lean into the minor ache. Embrace it. \u201cBaby.\u201d Rory studied her face, concern etched between his dark brows. \u201cAh, baby, are you okay?\u201d He made a visible effort to swallow a growl, but it emerged anyway, his hips seeming to plow forward of their own volition. \u201cOh my God, Olive. Christ. You feel incredible.\u201d \u201cYou feel so good, too,\u201d she said, awed, shifting her lower body around so she could memorize every new sensation. \u201cSo hard, Rory.\u201d He barked a humorless laugh, the muscles in his shoulders and chest bunching. \u201cI can\u2019t hold still when you say things like that.\u201d Olive\u2019s hands traveled down his strong back to settle once again on the swells of his ass. \u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t hold still.\u201d Right before her eyes, the final traces of Rory\u2019s control evaporated and he fell on top of her like a starving man. His mouth moved over hers like it held the secrets of the universe, their tongues twining, his flesh leaving her and pumping back in, slow and deep, slow and deep, the erotic rhythm writing itself on her soul instantaneously. The root of his erection ground against her hyper-sensitive clit with such incessant friction, Olive couldn\u2019t stay still. Her thighs circled Rory\u2019s hips, hugging them tight, her hips lifting to meet his thrusts. She didn\u2019t know where the desire for hard and fast came from, only that it was there. And undeniable. When she couldn\u2019t find relief right away, she dropped her legs from around Rory\u2019s body and spread them wide, wide, swallowing a strangled moan when his cock bore down, exploiting her nub of flesh while he watched her from above. There. There it was. \u201cMy brothers won\u2019t be home for hours, baby,\u201d Rory gritted, his pace going from methodical to anxious. Hungry. Desperate. \u201cScream your little heart out.\u201d And she did. He angled his body to rub her more thoroughly and she let a scream rip, her fingernails burying themselves in his tight butt cheeks, holding him fast. Keeping him there. He caught her jaw in his right hand, tilting it up and hovering his mouth right above hers\u2014right above\u2014watching her every reaction like a hawk. \u201cDo you have any idea how fucking perfect you feel?\u201d His thumb tugged her lower lip down, then slipped all the way into her mouth. \u201cGod, a man like me should have to sell his soul to be your first, but you\u2019re giving yourself to me. Saving me. You\u2019re saving this black soul.\u201d He pulled his thumb from her mouth, spreading the wetness over her lips while watching in fascination. \u201cWhat the hell did I do to deserve you?\u201d Olive wanted to tell him he didn\u2019t have to do a single thing to deserve her. He only needed to be his exact self. Just Rory. The man who carried unnecessary pain and tried to save her from himself, even though they were meant to be just like this. Together. And she hoped she conveyed that with her eyes before he dropped his face into the crook of her neck and began bucking into her in rough strokes, his broken grunts filling her ears, turning her on to the nth degree. Finally being given that hard, fast, unfettered sex she\u2019d been craving without even knowing how it felt, Olive\u2019s eyes rolled into the back of her head, her thighs shooting together to ride on Rory\u2019s driving hips. Now she knew. She knew being the object of lust was glorious when you shared that same lust for the man. The mounting pressure in Rory\u2019s body was obvious in his frantic movements, the way he reached between them to tease her clit with the pads of his fingers. He wasn\u2019t long for this world and his touch demanded she come along for the flight up, up and away. \u201cSwollen, little virgin clit. So confused how it got that way,\u201d he muttered hoarsely into her hair. He reached back and gripped the underside of her knees, yanking them high around his hips and grinding her down into the mattress, his flesh entering her with wet slaps. \u201cGoing to come inside you now like God intended. Want you with me. Be with me, baby.\u201d His words pushed her across the finish line, almost as much as the moist friction of their lower bodies. A ticklish tightening in her loins signaled the end and she barreled toward it, her orgasm made brighter and sharper from the knowledge that Rory was going to climax. God, the cords of his throat stood out, his mouth open, eyes blind\u2026and she watched him go over the edge with her name on his lips. It was too quick. It went on forever. She didn\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t know, but witnessing Rory\u2019s pleasure was the single most incredible moment of her life. He went from being rocked with tension to being completely devoid of it, collapsing on top of her on the bed, gathering her so close in his arms, she could barely breathe. Moments later, when Rory lifted his head and searched her eyes, she couldn\u2019t stop the most brilliant smile from spreading across her mouth. He returned it. And Olive Cunningham fell completely and irreversibly in love with Rory Prince. \n CHAPTER TWELVE What\u2019s your favorite color slime?

If you enjoyed this challenge, there are tons more\u2026 Panic trickled into Olive\u2019s veins as her eyelids cracked open, allowing the morning light to reach in and blind her. Which didn\u2019t help her total disorientation one bit. The sounds that had typically reached her ears over the last few weeks were ocean waves crashing, metal store fronts opening, joggers chatting as they ran past her building. Not her parents and siblings and giggling, muffled by her bedroom door. Had she dreamed moving to Long Beach? Had she dreamed Rory? Olive\u2019s heart dropped into her stomach at the thought and she cracked an eye open once again, praying she would find herself lying on flannel sheets that smelled of man and musk. No way she could dream so elaborately. No way she could dream someone so complicated and beautiful, could she? Tune back in next week when we\u2019ll be building a spider web in the backyard and having a family laser tag party. You don\u2019t want to miss it! Like and subscribe\u2026 Please no. Please\u2026 The sun shining through the window dimmed briefly and the outline of Rory came into view. And her heart shifted back into place but made no move to resume its normal rhythm. He was shirtless, standing across the room, sweatpants slung low around his hips, rubbing a towel over his wet hair. Tattoos clung to his skin the way she\u2019d done last night, blacks and blues and a hint of red here and there. God, so hot. So insanely, ridiculously, movie-star-quality hot. There was a line of concentration between his brows, and Olive finally realized where the familiar sounds of family bonding were coming from. Rory\u2019s laptop was open on his dresser. He was watching a Meet the Cunninghams video? Trying to ignore the discomfort that rippled through her chest, Olive sat up slowly. \u201cUm. Why are you watching that?\u201d Rory turned to her with a casual smirk, as if about to make a dry remark, but whatever he saw on her face caused him to slam the laptop shut, concern blanketing his expression. \u201cHey. I\u2026shit, sunbeam. I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d He dropped the towel and crawled toward her on the bed, hitting her nose with clean, soapy, male goodness. \u201cI woke up a while ago and I started worrying\u2026\u201d A beat passed as he shook his head. \u201cThree bachelors live here and we almost never clean. It was never any great shakes to begin with, but we\u2019ve kind of destroyed it over the years. You must be used to much nicer. I was kind of torturing myself by finding out the kind of house you grew up in. But I didn\u2019t think it would be torture for you.\u201d He pressed her back into the pillows with a long, slow kiss. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered, her body screaming to life beneath the sheets. \u201cWhy are you up so early? It\u2019s Sunday.\u201d In the short space of time it took them to kiss, his pupils had bled completely into his green irises. \u201cI\u2019m prepping the bar now almost every day. I have to go marry the liquor bottles, stock the shelves, do some paperwork.\u201d He made a harsh sound. \u201cOf course, as soon as I volunteer for the job, I\u2019ve got a reason for never wanting to leave this bed.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s quite a coincidence.\u201d \u201cNo. Not a coincidence,\u201d he said quietly, laying his lips along her right cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re the reason I volunteered for the job. The reason I wanted more responsibility.\u201d His mouth trailed lightly across her mouth to lay a feathery kiss on her left cheek. \u201cSee, I don\u2019t deserve you. And I\u2019m not even sure I was aware of what I was doing\u2026but I know now. I was trying\u2014I am trying to earn you a little at a time. I just want to earn you.\u201d Olive had to bite her tongue to keep from blurting I love you. That wet, melting sensation was back between her thighs, her mouth was dry, her heart was rapping against her ribs. God, she was a complete mess over this man and he thought he had to earn her? \u201cRory\u2014\u201d \u201cOlive.\u201d Rory brushed her hair back from her face, a harsh laugh scraping out of his mouth. \u201cDo you have any idea how fucking cute you look right now? Hair all messy, mouth puffy, eyes still half closed. If I don\u2019t get out of this room in one minute, I won\u2019t leave.\u201d \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d \u201cStop.\u201d The deep resonance of his sexually frustrated tone made goose bumps rise on every inch of her skin. \u201cGo back to sleep. When you wake up, go next door to Jiya\u2019s house. I\u2019ve already asked her to give you a ride home. Will you do that for me?\u201d No help for it. She felt like a cherished belonging and it was\u2026amazing. Mostly because Olive was pretty positive if she asked Rory to do anything, he\u2019d do it. To make her happy. She wanted to make him happy, too, and all that was required was getting home safely. Letting him take care of her in this one way. \u201cYes. I will.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d His shoulders lost their tension, his hand lifting to cup her face. \u201cI\u2019m on the beach all day, but I\u2019m not bartending tonight.\u201d Green eyes fell to her mouth and darkened. \u201cCan I see you again?\u201d Olive wanted more than anything to be back in his arms. As fast as possible. Not being in them right now was awful. \u201cI have a study group tonight, but I can miss it\u2014\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d The set of his jaw was resolute, but his eyes were soft. \u201cDon\u2019t miss school work because of me. How about I give you a ride to class tomorrow morning?\u201d Butterflies rushed into her chest, wings flapping wildly. \u201cThat sounds perfect.\u201d He caught her mouth in a hard kiss that wanted\u2014so badly\u2014to become more. They breathed heavily against each other\u2019s lips for a few seconds, Olive\u2019s thighs shifting beneath the bedclothes, which Rory obviously noticed, if his groan was any indication. \u201cHow does your body feel, sunbeam? You hurting from what we did?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d She kissed the side of his chin. \u201cNo.\u201d His eyes closed briefly, then refocused on her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the video.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Olive\u2019s lips wobbled into a smile. \u201cI searched for you on social media. So I guess we\u2019re just even now.\u201d Rory reared back a little. \u201cYou did?\u201d He regarded her with a mixture of amusement and confusion. \u201cI\u2019m not on any of that shit, baby.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d She lifted her chin. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cAre you serious? It\u2019s like a\u2026virtual footprint. How else am I supposed to learn about you?\u201d She arranged her features in a horrified expression. \u201cTalking?\u201d Rory tickled her ribs and she sheet dropped from her breasts. He yanked it back up with a bark of pained laughter, covering her up once more. \u201cJesus Christ, if dicks could cry, mine would be sobbing right now.\u201d When he seemed to be debating whether or not to leave, Olive knew she had to help him. He wasn\u2019t letting her miss study group and she wouldn\u2019t let him shirk his new managerial obligations. As much as it hurt. Like seriously, ouch. \u201cGo,\u201d she managed, saying a silent apology to her newly awakened femininity. \u201cYou have to go prep the bar. I\u2019m\u2026\u201d Her breath caught a little as the truth tripped out. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you for taking on new responsibilities. I\u2019m proud of you for not fighting last night\u2026I\u2019m just proud of you. But you don\u2019t have to earn me. I\u2019m right here.\u201d She laid a soft kiss on mouth. \u201cDo it for yourself. You\u2019re worth the effort.\u201d \u201cHow\u2019d I find you?\u201d His gaze cut away, a muscle in his throat working. \u201cI guess I have no choice but to go to work now.\u201d They shared a frustrated laugh as he rose from the bed, pulling on a shirt that had been laid out on his dresser. Before he could leave the room, his hand paused on the doorknob, Rory looking back at her over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, right?\u201d Olive nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d \u201cYeah, still trying to believe it\u2019s real,\u201d he said, walking through the door and closing it carefully behind him. \u201cBye, sunbeam,\u201d she heard through the barrier between them. She must have sat there for fifteen minutes without moving. How could Rory be so polarizing and such a comfort at the same time? Her skin was overly sensitized, as if enveloped in static electricity. Her nipples were in tight peaks, as if in denial that he\u2019d left. Finally, she lay down, turned on her side and took a deep inhale of his scent, letting it carry her back to a fitful half sleep. Groans from last night peppered her mind, memories of Rory\u2019s mouth between her legs, his arousal sliding home inside her, one inch at a time. How he\u2019d lost control at the end, driving into her hard, saying things into her neck she would have thought crude, but were perfectly paired with a man at the end of his rope. A man she cared about. Desired. Still half asleep, Olive turned on to her belly and slipped a hand between her thighs. She found her clit with two fingers and worried the nub in fast, tight circles, breathing erratically into Rory\u2019s pillow. His scent only got her to the precipice faster. We fuck, you come. It\u2019s a given, you understand? She muffled her moan, her hips grinding down on to her fingers. Almost. Almost. God, she would have done anything for Rory to walk back into the room and thrust himself inside her. Hard. Hard\u2014 The storm broke and Olive sank her teeth into her lower lip, limbs shaking as the orgasm rolled through her like thunder, so intense that her calf muscles were immediately sore, her throat strained from trying to stay quiet. \u201cOh m\u2019God.\u201d She turned over and stared up at the ceiling, proverbial canaries circling around her head. \u201cThat has to be some kind of record.\u201d Olive sat up and looked around, fanning her skin to cool the dappling of sweat. She didn\u2019t know about the rest of the house, but Rory\u2019s room was pretty tidy. There were some articles of clothing discarded on the floor\u2014hers included\u2014but there were no dust bunnies running around. He had a calendar hanging on the wall by the door, notations beginning two weeks ago, and her heart tripled its pace, just imagining him going out and buying organizational supplies. Wanting to do better. She got out of bed and dressed in her clothes from the night before, crossing to the dresser so she could look at the one framed photo in the room. It was the three brothers standing on the stoop in order of height, a laughing woman Olive assumed was their mother holding a pizza delivery box\u2026and a serious man staring at them through a window in the background. Last night, they\u2019d talked about Rory\u2019s mother, but not his father. In fact, was it her imagination or had he tried to avoid the subject of his dad? Olive shook off the odd thought. They had plenty of time to talk about everything. And there was a lot to discuss. Olive still didn\u2019t know what had provoked Rory in the fight that sent him to prison\u2014and everyone seemed determined to safeguard that information. Which, unfortunately, only made her want it more. Before Olive left the room, she ran her index finger over the lid of the laptop. Which video had he been watching? With a swallow, she started to lift up the screen, but stopped herself. These videos that made so many people happy only reminded her that she\u2019d been abandoned. Her gaze couldn\u2019t help but drift back to the picture of Rory. Abandoned. He wouldn\u2019t do that to her\u2026again. Would he? Not after last night. After they\u2019d found their way back to each other and proved it was too difficult to stay away. I just want to earn you. Olive held on to Rory\u2019s words on her way to the house next door. And when her phone lit up with a text message from the man himself\u2014I miss the hell out of you, sunbeam\u2014she straightened her spine and shoved the foreboding aside. You\u2019ve fallen in love. Stop worrying and enjoy it. But the fear had already built a nest in the back of her head. \n CHAPTER THIRTEEN Rory let out the breath he\u2019d been holding when he saw Olive waiting outside her building, staring down at the open book in her hands. She was gorgeous in the early morning sunlight, her blonde hair lit up with a halo. Such an angel. She smiled, big and open, when she saw his bike approaching, stowing the book in her bag, and his throat cinched up. Fuuuuck. He wasn\u2019t going to get used to this. The anticipation that had been plaguing his gut since leaving her in his bed yesterday was replaced by trepidation this morning while he got ready. Wouldn\u2019t it\u2026couldn\u2019t it take the smallest thing for her to get over him? His old-ass house. His work schedule. The fact that he didn\u2019t make a ton of money. All of it combined. She was an eighteen-year-old girl. Fickle, right? Then he saw her and remembered. She\u2019s not like anyone else. She\u2019s Olive. A snapping connection reeled him closer, so wild and tangible, he almost forgot she was standing outside of an expensive doorman building. Wearing a backpack. Those things were just enough to remind him of the vow he\u2019d made to himself. No more staying away. God, no. But if she ever decided he wasn\u2019t the best man to make her happy\u2026no matter how much he was willing to bust his ass and try\u2026he\u2019d figure out a way to leave her alone. Even if it killed him. For now, though? For now, he wasn\u2019t going to take a single second of having this girl in his life for granted. In the short time he\u2019d known her, she\u2019d inspired him to see himself differently. Made him ask the hard questions. What am I capable of? Little by little he was finding out. He\u2019d taken to heart what she\u2019d said yesterday morning. About taking on more responsibility and improving his situation for himself\u2014and it made a lot of sense. He was going to work on that, but it was hard to do a goddamn thing at the moment without attributing it to his need to be a better man for Olive. Maybe he\u2019d get there eventually. Rory didn\u2019t know. He just needed to get his hands on the girl who hadn\u2019t left his mind for a single second since yesterday. Hell, for weeks. \u201cHey.\u201d Rory stopped at the curb and took off his helmet, setting it down beside the one he\u2019d brought for Olive. In one quick movement, he climbed off the bike and strode toward her on the curb. \u201cHey. You want to be my girlfriend?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d His mouth crushed down onto Olive\u2019s, his forearm slinging beneath her butt to draw her up onto her toes. Commuters honked as they passed by, but Rory barely heard any of it. He was only there for the little whimpers in Olive\u2019s throat, the rasp of her bare thighs against his jeans. Their mouths wrestled, Olive gripping the collar of his shirt, not only receiving the kiss, but giving it back to him, like she\u2019d been hungry for it, too. More than his next breath, Rory wanted to pick her up by that tight, sexy ass and feel the life-affirming sensation of her thighs locking around his waist, but he heard the doorman clear his throat at the building entrance and somehow managed to lift his head. \u201cH-how\u2026am I supposed to go to class now?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll manage.\u201d Rory flicked a glance over Olive\u2019s head and noted the disapproval in the man\u2019s expression\u2014he was doing nothing to hide it. Olive stared to follow his line of sight, but Rory caught her chin and planted a final hard kiss on her mouth. \u201cCome on. I set up the bar early and bribed someone to cover my chair for the first hour, so I can drive you back.\u201d Just like the other night when Rory rode Olive on his bike, he was a nervous wreck for the entire ride to Stony Brook, but she seemed to sense his tension. The fingers splayed on his chest moved in soothing circles while they ate up the distance on the highway. She planted a kiss in the center of his back and laid her cheek over the spot toward the end of the ride. After that, he wanted to drive another hundred miles, but he wouldn\u2019t let her miss class. They were early, however, which led to them parking behind the Burnbaum building to wait. Rory took off both of their helmets and hung them from the handlebars, but when he would have lifted Olive off the bike, he only turned her sideways on the seat, running his palms up her thighs. Letting his fingertips creep under the hem of her white shorts. \u201cYou were wearing these the day I met you.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI have a test today, so I wore them for good luck.\u201d How was he supposed to stop himself from devouring her when she said things like that? As it was, he couldn\u2019t keep his hands from memorizing the texture of her legs, her arms, her neck and face. She did the same to him, scrubbing her palms on his abdomen, trailing her fingertips up and across his chest. \u201cSo I\u2019m your girlfriend now?\u201d For as long as you want to be, sunbeam. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Pink blew across her cheekbones and he almost proposed. Honest to God. \u201cWhat exactly does this entail? Having a boyfriend.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what having a boyfriend entails for other girls. I only know what it\u2019s going to mean for you.\u201d Rory tangled a hand in Olive\u2019s hair and tongued her lips open, savoring her gasp before sinking them both into a kiss that made the ground move under his feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to want to know you\u2019re safe. All the time. I\u2019m going to be obsessive about it\u2014and I don\u2019t think I can help that.\u201d He pulled back an inch. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you when you\u2019re not with me. When you are, I\u2019m probably going to stare at you. A lot. I\u2019ll be wondering how the hell this smart, funny, sexy girl is all mine.\u201d He set the hair wrapped around his knuckles free, dropping both hands to her knees and easing them wider so he could press closer, watch her eyes widen when his cock met the seam of her shorts. \u201cI\u2019m going to touch my girlfriend all over.\u201d A roll of his hips made her eyelids flutter, her chest shudder. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to fuck her rotten.\u201d \u201cRory,\u201d she gasped. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to mean for me?\u201d he asked her in between soft bites of her neck. \u201cHaving a girlfriend.\u201d Olive stuttered her way through some gibberish, then appeared to give up, scooting her hips closer to the edge of the seat. \u201cI can\u2019t think right now.\u201d Unable to subdue his smile, Rory caught her full lower lip between his teeth and tugged. \u201cYou want me to get on Facebook? So you can tag me in pictures and all that nonsense?\u201d As soon as the suggestion was out of his mouth, he wanted to take it back. What if she didn\u2019t want her college friends to know she was dating a bartender without an education? \u201cForget I said that\u2014\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d She gripped his shoulders, pleasure blowing across her features. \u201cWould you really do that? I know you think social media is stupid, but\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d She seemed to be searching for the right words as Rory held his breath. \u201cI want my profile to say In a Relationship with Rory Prince. Don\u2019t you want that?\u201d His heart started to sprint. \u201cYou really have to ask me?\u201d He cleared the rust from his throat. \u201cDo we have time to do it right now?\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d Olive squeaked, hopping off the bike and whipping her phone out of her backpack. \u201cOh my gosh, this is going to be so fun. I can\u2019t even remember what it\u2019s like to set up a Facebook account. I\u2019ve had mine since I was eleven.\u201d Rory leaned back against his bike and watched her fingers fly over the screen of her phone, her lip caught between her teeth. Given the choice, he would have stood there for the rest of the day telling her the answers to question like, when is your birthday? Where did you go to high school? He got the feeling she skipped over some of the questions about college, but nothing could ruin this chance to make her happy. With something as small as throwing his picture up on a website, no less. Olive shifted in her sandals. \u201cRelationship status\u2026\u201d \u201cWorshipping Olive Cunningham.\u201d Pink climbed her throat. \u201cThat\u2019s not one of the options,\u201d she said softly, not quite hiding her smile. \u201cBut I like it.\u201d \u201cGood. That\u2019s my plan.\u201d They stared at each other for a few beats, the air around them thick. \u201cSo. Okay, we need a profile picture.\u201d She lifted her phone, preparing to shoot, but Rory shook his head. \u201cI want you in it.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d Olive turned and raised the phone again and Rory saw them on the screen, a study in contrasts. In the forefront, she smiled broadly, wreathed in sunshine. Meanwhile, he was buried in a shadow with his arms crossed, watching her underneath the hood of his eyelids. Before he knew his own mind, Rory snagged Olive around the waist with his forearm, dragging her back against front. On a whimper, she snapped the picture while his mouth moved up the side of her neck\u2014and he couldn\u2019t help it. He looked dead straight into the camera and let every man who\u2019d see it know. Touch her and regret it. \u201cHoly whoa,\u201d Olive murmured, looking at the final product and making a few, final taps on the screen. \u201cI\u2019m only going to sneak a thousand looks at this during class.\u201d Rory laughed. \u201cGo, sunbeam.\u201d He pushed off the bike and kissed her forehead, settling his hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re done.\u201d She nodded. \u201cThanks for doing this. I know you have to get to the beach.\u201d \u201cI love doing this.\u201d When she started to look hypnotized by his mouth, Rory turned her around and smacked her butt lightly to get her moving toward the front side of the building. As soon as she was out of sight, he blew out a shaky breath and adjusted his hard dick. As much as he\u2019d wanted Olive all to himself, he\u2019d never be the reason she missed class. Christ, being responsible was fucking painful. Attempting to take his mind off the ache between his thighs, Rory left campus and gassed up his bike, grabbed a coffee and read the newspaper at a diner. While he was sitting there, his phone buzzed with an incoming text from Andrew. Need a head count. You coming to Mom\u2019s party or what? Rory drummed his fingers beside his coffee on the counter. Of course he was going to say no. He always said no. As usual, that memory of her disappointment in the courtroom smoked into his head and occupied it. The other memories followed close behind. Coming home from prison and finding she\u2019d aged a decade in the space of two years. Hollow eyes, lines of misery around her mouth. The way she winced when she moved. The phone creaked in Rory\u2019s fist. He had to say no to the party. He couldn\u2019t look his mother in the eye after abandoning her to such a horrible fate, could he? He could if Olive was with him. Fuck, it was possible he could do anything if Olive was with him. Before he could stop himself, Rory pulled up the text conversation with Andrew. Yeah, I\u2019ll be there. Me and Olive. A full minute passed before Andrew responded. I\u2019m glad, man. You belong there. With a knot in his throat, Rory paid for his coffee and left the diner. His pulse wouldn\u2019t slow down on the ride to campus, his blood buzzing with the decision he\u2019d made. Was it nerves or something else? Something like optimism? That optimism only spiked when Olive exited the door of the building, smiling and surrounded by girls, her books hugged to her chest. The world moved in slow motion as she searched him out, her lips spreading even wider when she spotted him and pushed her glasses higher on her nose. Jesus. What incredible new reality had he been dropped into? She said a few more things to her friends and nodded, jogging in his direction. He was only partially aware of Olive\u2019s friends observing him like a strange new species at the zoo and giggling because Olive\u2019s tits were bouncing around, making him hard as iron all over again in his jeans. \u201cHey,\u201d she greeted him breathlessly, cinching her tight body up against him and sighing, as if having their bodies pressed together restored her. Rory could relate, because he felt the exact same way. Olive was the embodiment of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. \u201cEveryone is going to that pop-up carnival on the boardwalk tonight.\u201d She dropped a sweet kiss onto his mouth. \u201cWe should go.\u201d Rory kissed her mouth long and hard. \u201cYou want to go, we\u2019ll go.\u201d She laid her head on his chest. \u201cI want to go everywhere with you.\u201d And riding back toward Long Beach with the girl he\u2019d never dared dream about clinging to his back, for once it seemed like nothing could go wrong. \n CHAPTER FOURTEEN Olive inhaled deeply of buttered popcorn scent carrying on the warm summer night breeze, barely stopping herself from throwing her arms out and dancing in circles like a lovesick lunatic. Already her friends were way too curious about Rory, but the grin she couldn\u2019t seem to wipe off her face amplified their interest tenfold. There was definitely a part of Olive that wanted to disclose every single detail of the man who\u2019d sent her freefalling into a giant, mushy love pie. But there was a bigger part of her that wanted to maintain the secrets. Keep them all to herself, bundled to her chest like the softest pillow. She walked along the boardwalk with Leanne and two other girls from her study group, trying not to be obvious about scanning the evening crowd for a tall man with wind-whipped dark hair and a smirk. Seriously, it had only been six hours since he\u2019d dropped her off outside her building. Why did it feel like a millennium since he\u2019d growled questionable things into her ear and kissed her mouth? She was a windsock in the breeze, flapping around, and she wanted to wrap herself around his solid, grounding presence. After he\u2019d walked her to the front door of her building, she\u2019d floated upstairs in the elevator, knowing there was a wistful smile plastered to her face. She\u2019d studied, made lunch, dozed off on the balcony in the sunshine dreaming of a wicked half-smile and soulful eyes. When it was time to get dressed for the carnival, she\u2019d taken her time shaving, lotioning, straightening her hair, applying makeup. Putting on the exact right dress, a soft yellow strapless sundress that fluttered at the tops of her thighs. All the while, her stomach flip-flopped and she continually found herself staring into space, almost burning herself with the straightening iron on more than one occasion. Obviously she hadn\u2019t been finished staring into space because Leanne\u2019s elbow caught her in the ribs now, sending her hurtling back to the present; a loud, crowded boardwalk. \u201cDamn, Olive,\u201d Leanne laughed. \u201cYour expression is going to get us all pregnant and I\u2019m way too young for kids. Side note, I\u2019ll be too young when I\u2019m forty. Kids smell.\u201d \u201cI mean, we all saw homeboy today. It\u2019s understandable,\u201d said one of the other girls with a playful smile. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be that friend who hates you out of jealousy. Just be warned that I\u2019m dangerously close.\u201d Olive pressed her hands to her cheeks. \u201cSorry, guys. I\u2019ll probably be back to normal soon. Right?\u201d When they all passed her skeptical glances, she winced. \u201cUh, so\u2026what did you guys think of the lecture today\u2014\u201d \u201cShut up,\u201d Leanne said, giving her a withering look before nodding at something beyond her shoulder. \u201cRory is over there.\u201d A chemical change washed over her, her skin sensitizing, breath shallowing. Even her earlobes and toes started to tingle, as if preparing for a full-body awakening. And it happened as soon as she turned and saw Rory prowling toward her on the boardwalk, one hand in the front pocket of his jeans, the other pushing through his wet hair. Had he just come from the shower? Olive\u2019s thighs snapped together and squeezed, her sex already softening, growing damp. Her fingers twisted in the short hem of her dress, which she was regretting now. How was she supposed to hide her body\u2019s reaction to Rory? If she turned wet upon merely seeing him, a kiss would turn the insides of her thighs moist. \u201cHey,\u201d he said gruffly, stopping in front of her. And she\u2019d been wrong. It didn\u2019t even take a kiss to make her thighs slick. When her greeting emerged as an incoherent whisper, Rory\u2019s eyes filled with amusement. \u201cUh oh.\u201d He leaned down and rolled their foreheads together. \u201cLooks like you missed me. Maybe even half as fucking much as I missed you.\u201d Olive\u2019s knees almost lost power, but her desire to keep their mouths close gave her the strength to keep standing. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to be that girl who gets a boyfriend and ditches her friends. Help me.\u201d His laughter puffed against her lips a half-second before he kissed her, light and tender, but so potent she swayed toward his broad chest. \u201cSomething to drink, ladies?\u201d Rory said, throwing a brief glance over her head. \u201cBeer,\u201d Leanne said without missing a beat. \u201cBeer sounds great.\u201d Rory shook his head but didn\u2019t take his eyes off Olive. \u201cNice try. You\u2019re getting sodas.\u201d He pressed his mouth to Olive\u2019s ear. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a white Russian later.\u201d Heat propelled into her belly like a torpedo. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, wetting her lips. \u201cWhat am I going to make you?\u201d \u201cHappy.\u201d He ran a hand over her hair and backed away, reluctance in every line of his rangy body. \u201cGo have fun. I\u2019ll find you.\u201d A moment later, he\u2019d been swallowed up in the crowd\u2019s current, although his dark head was still visible above the majority of the carnival goers. Olive watched him go, already regretting her plea for help so she didn\u2019t neglect her friends. Still, his willingness to comply when they were both obviously dying to be alone? It made her like him even more. Like the unselfish man he was. Even if she had an intuition that he\u2019d be selfish later to make up for the delay. God, she couldn\u2019t wait for him to be selfish with her. Her friends walked up, flanking her on either side. \u201cJust do it,\u201d Leanne muttered. Olive squealed. Honest to God squealed, turning heads of passersby. \u201cThank you. I just had to get that out.\u201d \u201cUnderstood,\u201d Leanne returned. They continued walking and chatting, taking a right into the carnival entrance, which led them just off the boardwalk, where the rides had been erected in a large plot of empty land. Darkness had fallen completely, the blinking, rainbow assortment of lights turning everything in their path into a dreamy kaleidoscope. The smell of salty ocean air mingled with the scent of funnel cake, the crowd a moving sea of animation. Exhilaration danced over Olive\u2019s arms, like she was walking inside an electrical current, her laughter coming more freely than it ever had. \u201cSo how did you meet Rory?\u201d asked one of the girls from study group. \u201cHe rescued me,\u201d Olive answered, trying not to let her eagerness to talk about Rory show. \u201cI was reading and walking at the same time\u2026\u201d All three girls nodded in total understanding. \u201cAnd I was just about to step into the path of a speeding bus. But he pulled me back.\u201d She tucked some hair behind her ear. \u201cA-and then a couple days later, he rescued me from drowning. I got caught in the rip current.\u201d Everyone had stopped walking, their jaws halfway to the ground. Leanne\u2019s expression was one of pure betrayal. \u201cI\u2019m only finding this out now?\u201d \u201cI was embarrassed! Sorry sorry sorry.\u201d Wincing, she gave Leanne a quick hug and continued weaving her way through the crowd, encouraging the girls to follow. \u201cSo yeah, that\u2019s how we met. And then we took a weird break. But then he had to save me again from a bar fight\u2026\u201d Olive trailed off, feeling a crease form between her eyebrows. Had Rory really saved her three times? Wow. Stringing all those events into a few sentences made her not only seem kind of pathetic and accident prone, but for some reason a niggle of discomfort was crawling up her spine now. She\u2019d wondered since the beginning why Rory seemed so infatuated with her. She was a shrimpy bookworm with a gap between her front teeth who couldn\u2019t even legally buy alcohol. He was drop-dead gorgeous and cool and caring and loyal. He was guilty, too. Carried so much guilt, in fact, the weight was practically visible on his shoulders. If I\u2019d been there, I would have saved her. Hadn\u2019t Rory said that? Was he drawn to Olive because she\u2019d needed saving? The way he hadn\u2019t been able to do with his mother? Now that she didn\u2019t need constant saving\u2026how long until he lost interest? The carnival sounds around Olive grew muffled, her friends\u2019 conversation fading away until she could only hear the dull thudding of her own heart. A cavern opened in her stomach. Or maybe it had never sealed up in the first place. After the first time she\u2019d been disregarded by her parents for not being exactly right. Olive felt a hand on her waist. Breath warmed her neck and a familiar voice broke through the haze that had descended. \u201cHey, sunbeam.\u201d Concern was thick in Rory\u2019s tone. \u201cLook at me. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d A roller coaster trundled past overhead at top speed and a group of children ran by laughing, propelling the world back into its usual rhythm. At first there was only the outline of Rory\u2019s head, surrounded by blinking lights, but he steadily came into perfect view, worry creasing his handsome face. \u201cBaby,\u201d he said urgently. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, then cleared her throat and attempted to be more convincing. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Sorry, I guess I zoned out.\u201d Olive looked around to find three of her friends sipping their sodas grudgingly, but none of them seemed to have noticed her trip to La La land. She wanted to question Rory. The words were right there on the tip of her tongue. Am I just a rescue mission? Using her to fulfill a regret from his past made sense, didn\u2019t it? Her psychology professor would call it repression. Or something equally fancy. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he said, moving closer and wrapping her in body heat. \u201cTell me.\u201d \u201cNothing is wrong, I just\u2026\u201d The suspicion was bad enough\u2014she didn\u2019t need confirmation so soon. And what if she was wrong? The electricity between them wasn\u2019t a fluke. Or a product of the past. It was right now and it was consuming. Stop overanalyzing and live in the moment. \u201cTake me on a ride?\u201d As soon as Rory smiled and twined their fingers together, the fears began to dissipate. It had been nothing more than a weak moment. This man was nuts about her. It went both ways and she wasn\u2019t going to get buried beneath a checklist of how their relationship could go wrong. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Rory said, kissing her knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m stealing my girl,\u201d he called to her friends. \u201cEnjoy your non-alcoholic beverages. We\u2019ll catch up with you in a little while.\u201d \u201cThere are supposed to be perks when your friend dates an older man,\u201d Leanne shouted over the noisy carnival. \u201cI want my perks!\u201d Rory and Olive shared a laugh, settling the chaos in her belly once and for all. He led her to the Ferris wheel, where thankfully there was only a short line. And when Rory wrapped his arms around her waist and rested his chin on top of her head, she wished it would move slower so they could stand that way for longer. Minutes later, Rory helped her onto the moving seat and slid in beside her, pulling down the bar and testing it, not relaxing until it was secure. He threw an arm along the back of the seat, moving close until they were pressed together from shoulder to knee\u2014and Olive had no idea if his proximity or their sudden ascent into the sky caused the ticklish, weightless feeling in her stomach. \u201cHey,\u201d Rory breathed against her mouth. \u201cHey,\u201d she murmured back, letting him ease her lips open with a kiss. A rush went through her, amplified by the air that blew across her bare shoulders, whipping her hair around. There was so much vulnerability in having her feet dangling dozens of feet above the ground while this man\u2019s mouth wreaked havoc on her senses, she had to grip the metal bar where it rested at her waist or risk floating away. After a too-short time, Rory ended the kiss and Olive realized they\u2019d paused at the very top of the Ferris wheel. Gone was Rory\u2019s earlier concern. It had been replaced by nothing short of lust. For her. With a bunched jaw, shallow breath and the wind throwing his hair in ten directions, he was nothing short of magnificent. The endless sky full of stars spread out behind him, making the moment bottomless, no beginning, no end. His gaze fell to her chest and he uttered a husky curse, the muscle of his thigh flexing alongside hers. \u201cGod, Olive, I just want to get my fucking hands on you.\u201d Fevered and filled with sudden mischief, Olive arched her back, feeling the neckline of her strapless dress tug low, so low, revealing an indecent amount of her breasts. \u201cTouch me.\u201d The growl that broke from his throat sent her thighs slapping together in their signature move, and that was before Rory\u2019s right hand swallowed up one of her breasts, squeezing it once, then rubbing his palm in a chafing circle around and around her peaked nipple. Olive let out a cry, turned on by everything at once. Him, mainly, of course. His touch, his hunger for her, his scent, their attraction. Having her breasts exposed at the top of a Ferris wheel turned her wild, reckless, hotter than she ever thought possible. She leaned up and teased Rory\u2019s mouth into a quick, wet kiss, then leaned back to watch his expression change as she slipped a hand beneath the hem of her dress. His nostrils flared. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Biting down on her bottom lip, she tucked a finger inside her panties, using the gathering moisture to fondle her clit. \u201cTouching myself,\u201d she whispered, her words threading together with the wind. \u201cI did this in your bed yesterday morning. After you left.\u201d A shudder rocked Rory, shaking Olive, too. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d He leaned in quickly, their foreheads meeting and rolling together. \u201cYou played with your pussy in my bed? Is that what you\u2019re telling me, baby?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cIt smelled like you,\u201d she gasped, grinding the pad of her middle finger against her clit, rubbing it rapidly. Faster, faster. \u201cYou were around me, everywhere\u2026the second b-best thing to having you on top of me\u2014\u201d \u201cEnough. Please,\u201d he begged through clenched teeth, his hands working her breasts, his fingers pinching her nipples and making lights blink in her vision. \u201cDammit. I came here to be your boyfriend. Buy you cotton candy, hold your hand and treat you like the little sweetheart you are. Now all I can think of is\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Rory caught her right nipple between his knuckles and clamped down hard. \u201cI want to drag you into the shadows and fuck you filthy.\u201d Oh my God. Yes. Olive felt the bolts tightening in her tummy, her thighs beginning to writhe on the fake leather seat. But before she could climax, the ride jolted, beginning to move again. Rory cursed again and tugged up the top of her dress, hiding her breasts from view once more. As soon as he finished the task, he snagged Olive\u2019s wrist, removing it from the space between her legs, catching her mewl of protest by moving his hot mouth over hers. \u201cTake me somewhere,\u201d she said, looking him in the eye. A shadow passed across his face, but he gave a tight nod. And no sooner did the Ferris wheel let them off was Rory guiding her out of the carnival. Hand in hand, they climbed the steps onto the boardwalk, dodging the lively crowds spilling out the beachside bars and restaurants. Olive\u2019s pulse went ninety miles an hour in her ears. Sticky warmth coated the insides of her thighs. Every pulse point in her body hummed like mini generators and they were all pulsing for this man who she trusted to lead her anywhere. So much that when he hopped the boardwalk rail and held his arms up, she had no doubt he would catch her. Olive jumped, landing in his arms. Up against his hard chest, so reassuring, but so sexual in the way it flexed, inviting her to rub her sensitive breasts on him, twine her legs around his hips as they walked. She didn\u2019t even care where they were going\u2014Rory would keep her safe and he would satisfy her, thank God. Ever since meeting this man, her body was relentless in its need to be satisfied. It was an urgent quest now. She required Rory to survive. The erection wedged, thick and hard, between their bodies told Olive she wasn\u2019t alone. She was needed, too, and it was glorious. They\u2019d only been walking for a matter of seconds when Rory walked them beneath the boardwalk, into the darkness, footsteps pounding above their heads. His heart pounded, too. Olive heard it as she slid down his body, his mouth attacking her from above before her toes touched the sand. And Jesus, his hands. They were under her skirt, inside the back of her panties, kneading her bottom with so much potent need, she felt dizzy on the receiving end. \u201cTell me to calm down,\u201d he rasped between kisses. \u201cTell me to bring you home and do this right. It should be right for you every time.\u201d \u201cI love this. I need it.\u201d \u201cOlive.\u201d She went down on her knees, her fingers tangling together in her clumsy attempts to unzip his jeans. The move was unplanned. She\u2019d never gone down on someone before, but the desire to drive him past his breaking point was suddenly so strong, so undeniable, she couldn\u2019t deny it. Rory tried to drag Olive back to her feet, but she wouldn\u2019t go. \u201cPlease?\u201d That single word stilled his actions, but his expression was pained. \u201cI want to so bad.\u201d His hand drifted over the crown of her head. \u201cLet me get on my knees for you instead.\u201d Olive had managed to drag down his zipper while he spoke and she rubbed her cheek now against his hardness where it strained inside his boxer briefs, making him hiss a breath. \u201cYou\u2019ve done it for me every time.\u201d Strong fingers threaded through her hair, shaking but hesitant. \u201cS\u2019because I\u2019m addicted to the flavor you keep between your thighs,\u201d he said, voice deep, words slurring. \u201cIf I could get away with licking it even more, I would.\u201d Her core throbbed at his words. \u201cMy turn,\u201d she murmured, easing down the waistband of his briefs, exhaling in a rush when he sprang free. Huge. Heavy. Long. Knowing Rory would pull her off the ground if she showed the slightest hint of trepidation, Olive wasted no time wrapping both hands around Rory\u2019s wide root and guiding the head of his arousal to her mouth. She licked around the smooth dome and let him slide into her mouth, over her tongue. \u201cChrist,\u201d Rory grated, his fingers tensing in her hair. \u201cOh God, baby. S\u2019good. Oh God.\u201d The praise met her ears like a caress and sent her confidence soaring. She stroked him with eager hands toward her mouth, marveling at the way his flesh swelled with every tight pull of her fists, a hint of saltiness sliding down the back of her throat. So many textures to memorize at once, the abrasive hair of his inner thighs tickling her cheeks, his calloused fingers scraping her scalp, the ridges of his cockhead gliding over the tip of her tongue. The way her throat rebelled when Rory started to flex his hips ever so slightly, introducing his insane hardness deeper than it had gone before. \u201cToo much? It\u2019s too much. It\u2019s too much.\u201d His words ran together, hips stilling, his stomach shuddering and hollowing inside his T-shirt. \u201cOlive. Sunbeam. I\u2019m so grateful. I\u2019m grateful for every fucking inch you get in that pretty mouth, baby. Swear it.\u201d Another earthquake rumbled through him, more of that salty taste finding the back of her throat. \u201cFuuuuuck. You have to get up soon. I\u2019m going to lose it.\u201d If he thought begging would make her stand up, his plan backfired. Watching her boyfriend lose his grip on control was fast becoming her favorite pastime. It turned her nipples to aching spears and amplified the ache between her legs, her wet center quickening and releasing, as if seeking the part of him she eagerly sucked on with her mouth, loosening her lips on the way down and making them tighttightight on the way back up. \u201cSon of a bitch. Enough.\u201d In conflict with his words, Rory\u2019s hands covered hers, squeezing, stroking, both of them pleasuring him now. \u201cGet up. Get up, turn around and lift your skirt before I blow anywhere but that pussy.\u201d The sand under her knees had nothing on the grit of Rory\u2019s voice. It was biting, new, exciting. She\u2019d snapped his tether and wanted to know what happened next. So much that she stood up too fast and went lightheaded. Rory caught her mid-sway, holding her with one arm wrapped around her middle, the other still busy on his erection. They looked down, watching the desperate tugs of his swollen inches, breathing fast together. As if reading her mind and knowing she\u2019d regained her equilibrium, Rory turned Olive toward a wooden post and intuition had her bracing both hands on the rough wood, whimpers falling from her lips, anticipation running amok through her senses. Her body. \u201cPlease please please,\u201d she said, hoping he would hear her over the foot traffic echoing from above. \u201cI need you. Now. Now.\u201d Rory\u2019s mouth pushed against her ear from behind, the sounds of a condom wrapper ripping audible among the muted boardwalk roar. \u201cTold you to lift your little skirt.\u201d A sob caught in her throat, one hand dropping from the post to scramble back to grip the material and drag it up to her waist, the other remaining braced on the wood. Night air kissed her bare backside, and an instant later, Rory was jerking the thin string of her thong to one side and dragging the smooth tip of his arousal through her soaked feminine folds. He didn\u2019t stop, letting it travel over her back entrance, jolting her with surprise, excitement, but she needed him inside her now. Needed that intense joining like she needed her next breath. \u201cYou\u2019re down too low, baby. Stand on my boots,\u201d he said, grazing her neck with his teeth, the swollen length of his hardness continuing to drag up and back through the moisture he\u2019d coaxed, making just enough contact with her clit to frustrate her, drive her lust to a fever pitch. Needy, hungry, Olive took two quick steps back, boosting herself up onto his boots and elevating herself those crucial few inches. She\u2019d only managed to brace both hands on the post once more when Rory drove into her with a growl. He caught her scream with the palm of his hand\u2014Pumping. Hard. Four. Times\u2014as her cries turned into a strangled plea for more. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said gruffly, his hips smacking against her backside as he thrust into her again. Again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I fuck you like a woman when you\u2019re still half girl. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t help it,\u201d she whimpered into his palm. \u201cDon\u2019t stop. Never stop.\u201d He let out the groan of a suffering man into her shoulder\u2026and then he braced his feet wider in the sand, taking hers along with them. Leaving her legs spread wider. So wide. Leaving her flesh impossibly open and vulnerable to the thrusts he inflicted, one after the other. His forearm wrapped around her hips and jerked them back so he could grind upward, into her constricting wetness, and Olive dug her toes into his boots, pushing higher, tilting her hips so she wouldn\u2019t miss one iota of the incredible impact. \u201cYou\u2019re so deep, Rory.\u201d Olive didn\u2019t recognize her own voice. It was hoarse and gasping and vibrating. \u201cIt\u2019s so deep. So deep.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d get deeper if I could.\u201d He drove into her and held, held, his hand dropping from her mouth to play with her clit. \u201cI\u2019d get deep enough to become a fucking part of you so you don\u2019t ever forget me.\u201d Her thighs started to tremble, the glow of her climax growing brighter, rendering her incapable of doing anything but fighting for it. Encouraging it. She wanted to pull apart his words, but the urgencies of her body were too much of a distraction. Almost there. Rory took another sidestep, opening their shared stance even wider, and one thrust later, Olive cried out into the backs of her hands where they gripped the post. \u201cRory.\u201d \u201cYou almost have me convinced I can be a good guy. Every time,\u201d he rumbled into her neck, his teeth razing her, his mouth sucking until she gasped. \u201cThen you spread your tight, young thighs for me and I show you, don\u2019t I? That I\u2019m always going to fuck you like I\u2019ve already earned a place in hell.\u201d His teeth sank into her neck and he thrust hard, lifting her toes from their perch on his boots. \u201cMight as well enjoy it.\u201d Olive climaxed with her feet dangling in the air and a scream trapped in her throat. She shook so hard under the force of the pleasure that her teeth chattered and her vision dimmed, before erupting with light. Light so intense she threw her head back on Rory\u2019s shoulder to avoid it. His fingertips still toyed with her clit, extending the bliss, making it never-ending. But the feeling went from life-changing to nirvana when she sensed him getting closer, too. She needed him with her. Experiencing the same exhilaration. Always. Always. He made a choked sound and she mimicked it as natural as breathing, ordering her inner walls to seize around him, instinctively knowing how to make his peak better. Rory staggered one step to the right, bouncing her in short upward drives of his hips, creating punctuations of Olive\u2019s whimpers\u2014and then heat bloomed inside her, Rory\u2019s broken shout music to her ears. Her feet dug into the sand as he let her down, her arms closing around her, their bodies swaying, mimicking the ebbing and receding of the ocean. Without turning around, she could already sense the thoughts running through his head. He was worried he\u2019d been too rough, too explicit, too everything. She only needed to turn around and show him her dazed, satisfied expression to ease his fears. But she literally could not move. Never wanted to move. So she leaned to the right and kissed his bicep, whispering, \u201cStay at my place tonight?\u201d Tension left him, reminding her of a wave rushing back to the sea. \u201cI have a condition.\u201d A line formed between her brows, some of the worries from earlier in the evening trying to break through her bubble of contentment. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Before she knew his intention, Rory tossed her up into his arms, righting her askew glasses with a nudge from his nose and carrying her from beneath the boardwalk against his chest. \u201cI want to see the famous matching shower curtain and towels.\u201d She tucked her face into his shoulder and laughed. \u201cDone.\u201d Was it possible to fall asleep while being carried by her boyfriend through a sea of people on the boardwalk? Olive was preparing to test the hypothesis when Rory\u2019s muscles turned to concrete. Enough that alarm shivered through Olive, her eyes flying open. She followed his line of sight and found a man staring back at Rory, appearing stunned and uncomfortable. They were roughly the same age, but the man was fair-haired and clean cut, where Rory was a beautiful storm cloud, always ready to throw a bolt of lightning. \u201cWho is that?\u201d Olive asked. Rory\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple rose and fell. \u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d he said, turning on a heel and carrying Olive in the opposite direction from the man. \u201cThat\u2019s the man I put in a coma.\u201d \n CHAPTER FIFTEEN When Rory was seven, his father decided it was time he learned to swim. His mother had already put Andrew and Jamie through swimming lessons, but money was too tight to do the same for Rory. The sun had been blistering that Saturday afternoon and the community pool was packed so tight with locals trying to cool down, you couldn\u2019t see the cracked, concrete bottom through the abundance of bodies. He could still remember standing at the edge, sweat rolling down his spine, wishing Jamie and Andrew weren\u2019t at a birthday party. Wishing they\u2019d come along, so he wouldn\u2019t have to be alone with their father. He hadn\u2019t spoken the entire way to the pool and it was anyone\u2019s guess what mood he was in. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Rory\u2019s father\u2019s voice came from behind him. \u201cI don\u2019t have all day, kid. Jump in.\u201d Rory hadn\u2019t bothered reminding the man he couldn\u2019t swim\u2014he already knew. Already knew that he\u2019d only ever waded into the ocean up to his knees. What he didn\u2019t know was that fear of the unknown scared Rory most of all. Would the water weigh him down? What would it be like to float and not be able to find the bottom with his feet? None of these questions could be voiced out loud, though. He\u2019d be called a sissy boy. Or he\u2019d simply be scoffed at. Maybe even pushed in before he was ready. No, he didn\u2019t want that. He wanted to make sure he had time to gather a big breath. Rory had closed his eyes, inhaled until his chest hurt and jumped into the pool, hoping his body would know what to do. Wishing his brothers were there. The cool wrapped around him, the soles of his feet touching scratchy concrete, and he\u2019d propelled himself to the top, fighting through the panic in his mind, ordering himself to paddle his hands, the way he\u2019d seen Andrew do. Kick. You\u2019re supposed to kick, too. The first sound he heard upon breaching the surface was his father\u2019s laughter. The outline of him had been shadowed, his stocky body outlined by the summer sun\u2014and he\u2019d been holding back the alarmed teenage lifeguard. \u201cWell done, kid,\u201d his father had said, clapping slowly. \u201cWe might make a man out of you after all.\u201d Treading water and trying to keep the panic off his face, Rory remembered the unwanted pride that stole through him. He\u2019d pleased his dad. Had that ever happened before? Jumping first and asking questions later had become a theme in his life after that day. Right now, though? For the first time since the day he\u2019d hurled himself into the community pool\u2026he wasn\u2019t jumping first and asking questions later. Not with Olive. When he found her, he\u2019d wanted nothing more than to devour her. Keep her all to himself. But he\u2019d stepped back, hadn\u2019t he? He\u2019d given her space to make sure he was the right man. He\u2019d started the lifelong journey to improving himself. Staring back at that man on the boardwalk fifteen minutes ago, he hadn\u2019t felt like an escaped animal. Every time he\u2019d imagined running into the person he\u2019d attacked, that\u2019s how he assumed he\u2019d feel. Like he should still be in a locked cell. But he had a new confidence in himself tonight\u2014and it had felt damn good. So good that he didn\u2019t want to keep the past locked inside anymore. As he helped Olive off his bike and they walked toward her building, his pulse ticked loudly in his ears. What would she say if he told her everything? Already he knew the conversation was inevitable, her silent curiosity speaking volumes, but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t nervous as hell to recount the night he acted like an animal. The night he was put away for the safety of the community. When they were a few feet from the entrance, the doorman stepped to one side, holding the door open. Just like the last two times he\u2019d encountered this guy, the doorman\u2019s expression turned distasteful at the sight of Rory\u2014and his confidence dipped momentarily. The guy had every right to regard him like a miscreant. Hadn\u2019t he just fucked his sweet, beautiful girlfriend in public\u2014hard and from behind\u2014like the depraved asshole he was? Olive tightened her grip on his hand and smiled up at him, though, and Rory remembered how she\u2019d sighed into his chest when he picked her up. How she\u2019d begged and gone down on her knees willingly. Eagerly. No, she\u2019d been right there with him. He needed to respect that she knew her own mind, this incredibly intelligent girl. Her smile dipped when she saw how the doorman sneered at Rory, her mouth opening in an outraged O. \u201cMike, this is Rory. He\u2019s going to be here. A lot.\u201d She leaned into Rory\u2019s side and passed through the entrance, her chin raised. \u201cWe bid you goodnight.\u201d As soon as they were in the elevator, Rory let out the laugh he\u2019d been holding, and Olive joined him. \u201cWe bid you goodnight?\u201d She pressed her palms to her pinkening cheeks. \u201cOh God. It seemed appropriate in my head, but then I just sounded like the dad from Mary Poppins.\u201d Rory pulled her into his arms, his body still shaking with amusement. \u201cIt was cute.\u201d Olive tilted her head back to meet his gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s not the first time he looked at you like that, is it?\u201d Reluctantly, he shook his head. \u201cYou should have told me.\u201d She ran her hands up his chest, over his neck and into his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay. He doesn\u2019t even know you.\u201d The elevator slowed to a stop and Rory swallowed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know all of me yet, either. Is that something you really want, sunbeam?\u201d She knew he referred to the truth of the night he was arrested. Her solemn expression made that obvious. \u201cYes. I do.\u201d When the metal door slid open, Olive took Rory\u2019s hand and led him into a carpeted hallway with sconces on the walls and apartment numbers engraved on golden plaques. He was glad to see the cameras located on either end of the hallway. It meant she\u2019d be safe. Which meant he\u2019d sleep soundly at night. The tight security didn\u2019t make him feel any less out of place, but he focused on the hand inside his. How she gripped him so tightly and continued to throw reassuring looks over her shoulder, as if to say, you belong. You\u2019re here because I need you. Rory took a deep breath\u2026and made the choice to believe her. Olive stopped outside the door at the north end of the hallway, sliding her key into the lock and letting them inside. She flipped on the light and the first thing Rory saw was books. So many books. They were color coded and arranged on shelves, stacked on tables, in piles on the floor. Swanky or not, this place had Olive written on every inch of it. So he felt nothing but comfortable as he entered, following her lead and kicking off his shoes near the door. He watched as she flitted from room to room, turning on lights and toeing stacks of books out of the way. She cleared paperwork off her kitchen table and looked at her reflection in the stainless steel refrigerator, patting down little flyaway hairs and fixing smudged eye makeup. They traded a laugh when she pressed a few buttons on her laptop and the sounds of Sting\u2019s voice singing \u201cFields of Gold\u201d filled up the apartment. Watching her set the mood was so fucking enjoyable, he had to tear his attention away to take in the rest of the apartment. Straight ahead was the connected dining room and kitchen, which she\u2019d painted a sunny yellow, two vases of daisies perched on the counter and table. Her Freud towel was drying over the back of a chair, and she\u2019d left a half-drunk mug of tea beside an open textbook. To his left was a small living room, complete with a big trunk that doubled as a coffee table\u2014and a suede couch, a pillow that looked as if it came from her bed on one end. That room led to a balcony with a view of the beach that had Rory whistling under his breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need to walk to the beach to visit me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can probably see me from here.\u201d \u201cNope. I\u2019ve tried,\u201d she returned, swinging around the kitchen\u2019s partition wall and sliding toward him in her socks. \u201cThe up-close version of you is better, anyway.\u201d He leaned down and brushed their mouths together. \u201cYeah?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d She studied him, as if trying to gauge his reaction to the expensive apartment. Rory smiled back, letting her know he didn\u2019t give a shit where they were, as long as it was the same place. \u201cCome on,\u201d she murmured, pleasure softening her features even more. \u201cI believe you requested a shower curtain and towel viewing.\u201d Watching her tush sway on the way down the short hallway, Rory made an appreciative sound. \u201cOn second thought, maybe that can wait.\u201d He reached for Olive, but she evaded him with a giggle, dancing into the bathroom and flipping on the light. \u201cMay I present proof of my adulting skills.\u201d Rory craned his neck to peer into the immaculate bathroom\u2026and dropped his head forward on a chuckle. Her shower curtain was a retro version of Belle from Beauty and the Beast. The cartoon character was naked\u2014except for some well-placed books\u2014and the towels were the exact shade of the purple streak in her hair. \u201cAll right, baby, that\u2019s pretty cute.\u201d He slapped off the light and tugged her out of the bathroom, kissing her as they swayed down the hallway. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve got Disney characters on your bedsheets, we might have a problem.\u201d She nibbled her bottom lip. \u201cHow late is Bed Bath & Beyond open?\u201d Rory narrowed his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m kidding. They\u2019re a tasteful heather gray.\u201d \u201cPhew.\u201d There was another balcony attached to her bedroom, he saw, when the glow from her bedside table lamp was turned on. He went over to inspect, unlocking and sliding open the door to find a deckchair wedged in the corner. \u201cYou sunbathe out here?\u201d He stepped outside and turned in a circle, noting how many other windows looked out onto that exact spot. \u201cAh, baby. You\u2019re trying to kill me.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Don\u2019t be a possessive asshole. \u201cNothing.\u201d He looked back to find her sitting on the side of her huge, fluffy bed, complete with furry throw pillows. So soft and sexy and female in her pretty dress and the muted lamp light. \u201cI can\u2019t help wanting to be the only one who looks at you.\u201d He reentered the room and advanced on her, loving the way her eyes raked over him, her body reclining slightly on the bed, as if she couldn\u2019t help lying down for him. \u201cI want you to know I\u2019ve never been jealous. Not in my entire life. It\u2019s all for you, so it\u2019s\u2026strong.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t want me in my bathing suit on the balcony?\u201d \u201cI want you to do it, even though it makes me crazy.\u201d He stepped between her thighs and eased her all the way down onto the bed. \u201cDon\u2019t give me too many inches, okay, sunbeam? You\u2019ll tempt me to take a mile.\u201d \u201cI can do that.\u201d Her breath caught as he lowered the side zipper on her dress and tugged off the garment, leaving it on the end of the bed. \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he muttered, staring down at perfection in panties and glasses. Nothing but panties and glasses. He trailed his fingertips from her neck, down between her bare breasts, circling them around her belly button. Watching her stomach hollow. \u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen, Olive Cunningham.\u201d Rory stripped off his T-shirt and scooped her up, placing her in the center of the bed and setting her glasses out of harm\u2019s way. Leaving his jeans on so he wouldn\u2019t be tempted too soon, he dropped down beside her onto his back, stacking his hands underneath his head and staring up at the ceiling. \u201cIf I never brought up what happened tonight on the boardwalk\u2026who we ran into\u2026would you ask me?\u201d \u201cNo, but it would kill me,\u201d she whispered, running her fingertips up and down the center of his chest. \u201cJust like you can\u2019t help being jealous, I can\u2019t help being curious.\u201d God, it felt good lying with her there in the near-dark. Talking, touching, no fucking time limit. It wasn\u2019t going to be an easy telling, but he would never be more comfortable unburdening himself than he was there, with Olive, in that moment. \u201cThanks. For letting me get here in my own time.\u201d They traded a long look that made his heart squeeze. \u201cThe night I was arrested\u2026\u201d He tried to clear the discomfort from his throat, but it wasn\u2019t going anywhere. \u201cI was walking home from the Hut. Right there along the boardwalk, where we were tonight\u2014and I couldn\u2019t get a hold of Jamie. We were supposed to meet up for a beer. It\u2019s not like him to flake. He\u2019s always on time, always got something sarcastic to say when I show up late. But I was on time that night and he wasn\u2019t there.\u201d Rory knew he was lingering over the insignificant details to delay what was coming, so he forced himself to push ahead. \u201cI went to Jamie\u2019s assigned chair, thinking maybe he\u2019d stayed late because some kids were still swimming\u2014and I saw some older guys. They were in the water. Looked like they were wrestling or something, so I started to head back up to the boardwalk, but I heard one of them say Jamie. Say my brother\u2019s name.\u201d Rory closed his eyes and tried to breathe through the anger that heated his blood. All these years later, he couldn\u2019t control it. \u201cThat guy we saw tonight. He was holding Jamie under the water.\u201d Olive\u2019s skin turned icy against Rory\u2019s and he instinctively turned and gathered her into his arms, rubbing circles onto her naked back, grateful for the job. It was a distraction from his leftover rage. \u201cThey were letting him back up to breathe. They weren\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t think they were planning on drowning him. But they were drunk. I could tell that a mile away, could hear it in their voices. They could have made a mistake, you know? And there were five of them. Five on one.\u201d His chest felt like it was caving in. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a fighter, baby, but I\u2019ve never fought unfairly like that.\u201d \u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Olive held him tightly, her face pressed into his neck. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that. I know that about you.\u201d \u201cNo. But I would keep hitting someone long after they passed out. I did.\u201d He let out a shaking exhale into her hair. \u201cHis four friends couldn\u2019t pull me off. I was an animal. I might have turned on them, too, if the cops hadn\u2019t shown up. Wrestled me off.\u201d He swallowed hard. \u201cI could have killed him. I think I would have, Olive.\u201d She lifted her head and looked at him, sympathetic and trusting and sad\u2026and he had to get out the rest. Had to get it out before he accepted the comfort he\u2019d never expected and didn\u2019t deserve. \u201cThe guy I attacked\u2026Jamie was the first man he\u2019d been with. And I don\u2019t know, he regretted it. Or hated that he didn\u2019t regret it. But he had some alcohol and decided to take out whatever shit he was feeling on my brother.\u201d He breathed in, breathed out. \u201cWhat I did to him usually comes with a much longer sentence, but Jamie testified in court. Told the judge he could have\u2026he\u2026\u201d \u201cHe could have been killed,\u201d Olive finished for him, a hitch in her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s true, Rory. I don\u2019t think you can let anger make decisions for you. Fighting and injuring someone is never the right answer, but\u2026just hearing you tell the story makes me so mad, I\u2019m not sure I wouldn\u2019t have reacted the same way. I\u2019m not sure anyone could help it.\u201d She gathered him close and he let her, let the fact that she knew everything and still wanted him sink in. Christ, the relief of that made him dizzy. \u201cThey could have killed your brother. Seeing that kind of thing happen right in front of you, it\u2019s no wonder you weren\u2019t in your right mind.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI only remember pieces. Even now.\u201d \u201cGood. I\u2019m think I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t remember every detail,\u201d she said, smoothing his eyebrows with her thumbs. \u201cThank you for telling me.\u201d She brought their mouths together, kissing him softly and Rory made a rough sound. \u201cDammit, Olive. This shit is too heavy for you. I hate that I put any of this in your head.\u201d He tunneled his fingers through her hair. \u201cYou should only hear and see and feel good things.\u201d For several beats, she only regarded him quietly. \u201cThe best endings come after a bad start. Good is only good if you\u2019ve seen enough bad to appreciate it.\u201d If Rory hadn\u2019t fallen in love with her at first sight, it would have happened right there, lying in the center of her bed in that ritzy as hell apartment. He was so fucking deep in love with her, he was never going to reach the bottom. The rest of his life would consist of sinking, down, down, down, further into love with this girl. Olive. His Olive. \u201cTalk to me,\u201d he rasped, running his palm over the valley of her side, resting it on her hip. \u201cTell me about school. Tell me about the last book you read. I want to hear about every second you spent away from me today.\u201d She snuggled closer, the peaks of her tits pressing into his chest hair, and Rory stifled a groan. \u201cUm, okay. While I was in class today, I\u2026was in deep, deep concentration\u2014\u201d \u201cGood girl.\u201d \u201c\u2014listening for your bike engine to come back.\u201d \u201cAh.\u201d He tucked his tongue into his cheek. \u201cShit. Sorry.\u201d \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d \u201cNope, definitely not.\u201d They shared a quiet laugh, their bodies pressing closer, her bare feet tucking between his calves, her warm pussy resting against the bulge behind his fly. Hell and heaven fucking collide. There wasn\u2019t a chance of Rory keeping his right hand from sneaking over her hip to grip that sweet, little butt, molding it in his palm. \u201cUm.\u201d Color stained her cheeks. \u201cThe last book I read was called You Are a Badass.\u201d Rory raised an eyebrow. \u201cI didn\u2019t see that coming,\u201d he drawled. \u201cDid you find out you already are a badass?\u201d \u201cYes. But it never helps to learn new tips and tricks.\u201d \u201cMaybe.\u201d Rory used his grip on her backside to grind her against his lap, taking her mouth in a no-bullshit kiss. When he freed her mouth, he was pleased to find her panting. \u201cLook, Olive. I know I\u2019ve had some issues with you being so young.\u201d \u201cReally? I didn\u2019t notice.\u201d \u201cQuiet, badass.\u201d He slapped her tush and swallowed her resulting gasp with his mouth, drawing her into a kiss that had them both moaning. \u201cYeah, I made your age into a problem, but I want you to know\u2026it isn\u2019t one, anymore. You moved here alone, set up this place exactly how you wanted it. You\u2019re going to school and making friends. You\u2019re killing it for any age, sunbeam.\u201d He kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cAm I allowed to be proud of you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll allow it,\u201d Olive said haltingly. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice, actually. Having someone be proud of me.\u201d She paused. \u201cI know I should be grateful to my parents\u2026the channel allows me to live in a place like this and go to school without worrying about loans, but sometimes I think I\u2019d wish it all away just to hear them say I\u2019m doing a good job.\u201d The sadness in her voice shredded his insides. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a whole lot of money, Olive, but I know there\u2019s no amount that could replace time with you. Proud of you? I\u2019m blown away. As far as I\u2019m concerned, you got here on your own\u2014and thank God you did.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cMy family can be yours. Me, Andrew, Jamie, Jiya. You\u2019ve already got me, but there\u2019s an us, too, when you\u2019re ready.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d Olive blinked a few times, dipped her head and lifted it again. She smiled, slinging a leg over Rory\u2019s hips and straddling him. \u201cNow this,\u201d she breathed, looking down at him from beneath weighted eyelids. \u201c\u2026is badass.\u201d \u201cOh yeah?\u201d he asked, following her lead and changing the subject, because he sensed she needed to. \u201cDepends what you do from up there.\u201d He lifted her with his hips\u2014and Olive let out a yelp of pain. Rory jackknifed, his heart firing up into his throat. \u201cOh my God. What happened?\u201d He ran his hands over her body, searching for injury, his pulse drumming in his ears. \u201cPlease tell me I didn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d She clasped his face between her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it just turns out\u2026well, I wasn\u2019t expecting it, but I\u2019m just a little, uh\u2026sore. Tender. Down there.\u201d \u201cJesus.\u201d He scrubbed at the pain in his chest, but that only made it worse. \u201cWait here. I\u2019m going to go throw myself off the balcony.\u201d \u201cWould you stop it?\u201d She laughed, pushing him back down onto the bed, locking their lips together and gradually pressing their lower bodies together. As if he wasn\u2019t consumed by enough guilt, his cock reacted to the warm pressure of her pussy like a fucking torpedo preparing to launch. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little sore, but\u2026I still want you,\u201d she murmured, gently rolling her hips. \u201cReally bad.\u201d Rory twisted his fingers in the sheets and waited for his eyes to uncross. \u201cAre you sure, sunbeam? You\u2019re not just saying that because I\u2019m hard? Because I hate to break it to you, it\u2019s like that any time you\u2019re around.\u201d He waited until she met his gaze. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do a damn thing. I will lie here and hold you. It\u2019ll be more than I could ever ask for.\u201d \u201cReally not making me want you any less,\u201d she whispered, right before unzipping his jeans and tugging the denim down, along with his briefs, leaving them bunched at his knees. When she crawled back up for a kiss, Rory kicked his garments the rest of the way off, greeting her with his tongue and lips. He didn\u2019t know whether to lose himself in the taste of her mouth or marvel over the gorgeous tits swaying above his chest, the thighs moving restlessly on the outsides of his. Mostly, more than anything on the planet, he just wanted to get her off. Because she needed it. \u201cBaby,\u201d he managed in between long, drugging kisses. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be inside of you. To make you come.\u201d He reached down and fisted his cock, moving it up and back between her thighs, cursing over the slickness between her folds. \u201cRub your little clit on me. Enjoy my cock. It\u2019s there for your personal use.\u201d A shudder wracked Olive and she fell forward onto his chest, her hips shifting as she found the exact right angle\u2026and Rory watched with satisfaction as her eyes rolled back in her head, her hips beginning to pump, sliding her pussy up and down his swollen cock. \u201cRory,\u201d she choked out. \u201cOh God. It\u2019s so sensitive.\u201d \u201cLean into it, baby. Nothing wrong with that.\u201d He gave her bottom a light slap. \u201cGrind.\u201d With their gazes locked, Olive did as he instructed, dropping forward to moan into his shoulder, but she didn\u2019t press down enough to muffle the sound, and he hoped everyone in the surrounding apartments heard it. Heard his girl taking her orgasm. From him. It was his fucking job and everyone would know he did it well, whether they heard her whimpering as they walked down their fancy hallway or spotted her in the elevator with a dazed expression on her face. \u201cOh. Oh.\u201d She threw her head back, mouth open, her hips busy, busy, moving faster. \u201cI\u2019m going to. I\u2019m going to.\u201d \u201cGood girl. Give your wet pussy what it needs.\u201d \u201cI am. Y-you are.\u201d \u201cWho, baby?\u201d \u201cRory.\u201d It took her another few seconds to come, and Rory had to fight to stay still while she rode up and back on his length, tucking her thighs back and rubbing her clit on his dick like she would die without the friction. Sweat formed on his upper lip, his chest, his brow. If his hands wrapped around the sheets any tighter, he was going to rip them to shreds. His balls throbbed, the same thick tempo echoing in his head. Don\u2019t move. Don\u2019t move. She\u2019s going off\u2026 Rory actually shouted when she hit her peak, it was so hot to witness. She bore down on him, trembling violently, eyes blind. \u201cGoddammit, how can you be so beautiful?\u201d Rory gritted out, flipping her over onto her back and standing above her on his knees, cock in hand, stroking himself at the pace a man only hit when he neared the end and wanted the agony over. She panted below him in the sheets, her belly directly below the erection he jacked off, her blonde hair spread out around her like spilled paint. \u201cYou look like a fucking angel, but I\u2019m going to come all over you, anyway. Going to mark what\u2019s mine.\u201d A look of wonder crossed Olive\u2019s face, as if she\u2019d only caught on that he was out of his mind obsessed with her. That wonder turned to innocence as she arched her back and shook her tits for his entertainment and Rory came with a roar, moisture leaving him in white ropes and striping her belly, her breasts, before finally dripping on the ruined thong that covered only a strip of her pussy. Coming that hard twice in one night must have been a shock to the system, because he couldn\u2019t get his shaking body under control. It kept up as he found a towel in her bathroom and cleaned her off carefully. And it was only beginning to subside when he fell onto the bed and gathered Olive up into his arms, raining kisses on her hair, her cheeks, her mouth. \u201cRory,\u201d she said into the darkness. \u201cWill you be here in the morning?\u201d \u201cOf course I will, sunbeam,\u201d he answered, covering her in the light sheet. \u201cI have to prep the bar, but I won\u2019t leave without saying goodbye, all right?\u201d If he\u2019d been more alert or less drained by what they\u2019d just done, maybe he would have noticed how she rapidly deflated in relief. And wondered why. \n CHAPTER SIXTEEN Olive had never been so warm and relaxed in her life. She usually woke to a distinct sense of woe, knowing she\u2019d have to drag herself out of bed, perform hygienic rituals and slog to class. This morning was another story entirely. She might as well have been floating on a river of golden orbs to the soundtrack of babbling water. Her limbs wouldn\u2019t move and that was A-OK with her. Moving seemed totally overrated when Rory had her wrapped in a bear hug and her bare backside was tucked into his lap. A smile curved her lips as she opened her eyes and stared at their reflection in her hanging mirror across the room. Their size difference and\u2026just plain differences were on full display. He was tall, hard-bodied and covered in ink, dark hair in a messy wreath around his head. Olive was small, paler, fair, not a tattoo to be found. Rory had a possessive arm slung over her middle, his softly breathing mouth lost somewhere in her hair. The hair on his thighs tickled the backs of her legs, and somehow that was a wild turn-on. What would they do when he woke up? Would he roll her over onto her stomach and just pressssss inside of her hot and slow? She recalled his gruff morning voice from the last time they\u2019d spent the night together and wanted to hear it again, abrasive and urgent in her ear. Olive closed her eyes and focused on keeping her breathing even, lest she wake up her boyfriend with horny face in full effect. Although, Rory definitely wouldn\u2019t mind. As if his body sensed hers was awake, his erection swelled against her bottom, pressing into the split of her cheeks. Olive mouthed oh my God at her reflection in the mirror, her eyelids fluttering at the new sensations. Not only was she waking up in a man\u2019s arms, she was waking up beside a sexy, caring, sensitive, magnetic man who she also happened to be in love with. So in love she wondered if he could hear the rapid acceleration of her heart. The way it rebounded off her ribs like a ping pong ball in a dryer. I should tell him. At the very notion, her stomach turned over and the beating of her heart took on a different quality. A nervous one. Before she\u2019d fallen asleep last night, she\u2019d dropped from the highest high, down to an unstable precipice. She was falling deeper and deeper in love with Rory, but the fall only seemed to be making her more scared. More apprehensive over how long he\u2019d remain in her life. Sure, the way Rory felt about her was in every touch, every kiss and word. But he had his insecurities and the past to overcome. Her heart believed he would come back to her every night. Her head was a different story, though. He\u2019d walked away once. He\u2019d walked away. And if he did it again, after her feelings for him had gone past the point of return, would she survive it? Needing some air, Olive eased out from beneath Rory\u2019s heavy arm, one corner of her mouth edging up as he rolled onto his back, arms and chest flexing as he stretched and went still again. She could have sat there memorizing every inch of him, but she rose instead and threw on an old T-shirt, wanting to get her head on straight before Rory woke up. Quietly as possible, Olive brushed her teeth, then padded down the short hallway into the kitchen. Upon entering the apartment last night, she\u2019d been so distracted by Rory\u2019s presence, she hadn\u2019t even removed her phone from her purse. If that didn\u2019t prove her infatuation, nothing would, since Olive hadn\u2019t slept without her cell charging on her nightstand since she\u2019d bought it in high school. She found her purse where she\u2019d dropped it on the dining room table and slid out the device, swallowing hard when she saw a text message on the screen from her mother. They hadn\u2019t spoken in a week and only in a cursory how-are-you-settling-in type of way. Their conversations hadn\u2019t been anything but forced in a long time, and every once in a while, Olive sensed her mother wanting to dig deeper. Maybe even apologize for how the family had been divided with everyone on one side and Olive on the other. But it never actually happened. Because of that, every time they hung up from a phone call, Olive only felt worse. Less connected to the people she used to spend every waking moment with. After a moment of hesitation, Olive slid her thumb across the screen, unlocked the phone and went to her messages. Hey sweetie! Just wanted to give you a heads-up, in case you watch the new episode. We needed a new toy unboxing space for the channel and your room was our only option. We\u2019ll make sure you\u2019ve got somewhere to sleep when you come to visit, so no worries! Maybe we\u2019ll even have a resort adventure next time you make it down here! Just didn\u2019t want you to be caught off guard. The new episode is so fun. Gadget Mania! Love you, Mom The numbness started at the top of Olive\u2019s head and spread down, into her belly, through her fingers and toes. She stared at the screen so long, the words started to blur together. Acid crept up the walls of her throat and into her dry mouth, eradicating the minty goodness her toothpaste had left behind. Most of all, there was pure sadness. Emptiness. Exactly how she\u2019d felt the afternoon she\u2019d walked into the house and found them making a video without her. Betrayed. Dumped. They\u2019d finally erased her for good. Olive heard the bed creak down the hallway and dropped the phone. Didn\u2019t even bother picking it up. She wrung the fingers of her right hand in her left, trying to fix the numbness, but it didn\u2019t work. Even her lungs lacked feeling. She couldn\u2019t even be sure she was breathing. When Rory walked into the room pulling on his T-shirt, Olive backed up automatically, her butt running into the kitchen table and jostling the vase of daisies. \u201cMorning, sunbeam,\u201d Rory said in that hoarse morning voice, his head popping through the top of his shirt. \u201cEarly class, right? I can give you a ride there, but I can\u2019t stick around this time to drive you back.\u201d His expression told Olive he was troubled by that fact, but she couldn\u2019t process the reason behind it. Couldn\u2019t think of anything but the text message. How completely untethered she was now to her family. Officially carved out. \u201cY-you know\u2026yeah. I\u2019m, um\u2026I can take the bus both ways.\u201d She crouched down on stiff legs and picked up her phone, leaving it face down on the table. \u201cYou should get to the bar.\u201d As soon as the suggestion was out of Olive\u2019s mouth, she breathed easier. The part of her that wanted nothing more than to spend time with Rory was not in control. Nowhere to be found. And her heart was too bruised to work or stop her. She just wanted away. Away from anything else that could cause damage\u2014and Rory had already caused some. Hadn\u2019t he? Yes. Oh God, she couldn\u2019t open herself up to get set aside again. She\u2019d had her head in the clouds. She\u2019d been na\u00efve to think this was forever. Forever? Seriously? They\u2019d only known each other for a few weeks and he\u2019d broken up with her once already. It was only a matter of time before it happened again. She didn\u2019t want the emptiness anymore. The sense of loss inflicted by her parents was terrible, but she\u2019d put herself on the road to living with it. Functioning despite the hurt. Adding the potential loss of Rory was unwise. It would kill her if it happened. \u201cOlive.\u201d Rory\u2019s dark eyebrows drew together. He took a step in her direction, but she jerked back again\u2014splashing water from the vase onto the table\u2014and her obvious alarm seemed to skyrocket his own. \u201cJesus, baby. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d She exhaled slowly. \u201cNothing.\u201d \u201cLike hell.\u201d His concerned gaze ran the length of her, his tan skin turning chalky. \u201cIs it\u2026worse today? The soreness?\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing like that. It\u2019s nothing at all.\u201d Having regained a small semblance of her equilibrium, Olive moved behind the table, pinched a napkin out of the holder and mopped up the water she\u2019d spilled. \u201cI just have to get ready for class.\u201d \u201cGood.\u201d His eyes stalked her every movement. \u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d \u201cRory\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSomething\u2019s up. You\u2019re scaring the hell out of me.\u201d \u201cMe?\u201d Olive scoffed, hating her tone. \u201cI should be scared.\u201d \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d This wasn\u2019t going to work. She couldn\u2019t tell him the truth. Couldn\u2019t tell him about the news from her family. How it had gutted her. Made her realize how foolish she was being to trust him again. He would convince her otherwise. He\u2019d make promises and kiss her and she would be a goner. Even now, his energy across the room was tugging the low muscles in her belly, the complicated ones around her heart. Every part of this man affected every part of her. She just had to make him go. God, just go, before you make me hurt worse. Last night at the carnival, she\u2019d landed on the theory that Rory was drawn to her because she\u2019d needed saving. Maybe he would lose interest the longer she went standing on her own two feet, neglecting to step in front of buses or almost drown. He could get bored. She wouldn\u2019t be fulfilling that need to save someone, left over from his bad home life. The abuse his mother had suffered when he was in prison. To Olive\u2019s desperate brain, it all made sense. He wouldn\u2019t want her for long. He would leave. He would cut her off, just like her family had done. It would hurt. Too much to survive. \u201cRory, I think\u2026I just think\u2026\u201d Olive\u2019s eyes landed on the textbook lying open on the table. \u201cI think it\u2019s better if I just focus on school right now. I-I shouldn\u2019t have ditched my friends last night. They\u2019re the people I should be spending time with. People who value the same things as me. School. Getting my education. I can\u2019t\u2026this won\u2019t work.\u201d If possible, Rory\u2019s face paled further. \u201cYou\u2019re giving me the smart girl look.\u201d Even though she didn\u2019t have a clue what that meant, Olive didn\u2019t like it. How was she looking at him? She couldn\u2019t even remember what she\u2019d just said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rory,\u201d she said on a trembling exhale. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t be with me,\u201d he rasped, his eyes taking on a far-off quality. \u201cDammit, sunbeam. My gut is telling me to shake you, kiss you, find out why you\u2019re scared of me all of a sudden. Is it\u2026it\u2019s because of what I told you, right? My arrest\u2014\u201d \u201cNo. That\u2019s not it.\u201d The denial burst out of Olive, but he talked right over her, seemingly beyond listening. \u201cI promised myself if you cut me off, I would man up and respect it. Leave you alone,\u201d he said, the words sounding raw as cut glass. \u201cMy bones tell me to do the opposite, though, baby. I\u2019m standing here and you\u2019re in pain for some reason and I don\u2019t know what the fuck to do.\u201d This time, it was Olive\u2019s turn to not listen. Her heart plummeted at the misery in his voice, but her mind snagged on only one part of his ravaged explanation. I promised myself if you cut me off, I would man up and respect it. Leave you alone. \u201cDid you ever think this was going to work out?\u201d Hot tears crowded against the backs of her eyelids. \u201cOr were you just waiting for a signal to walk away again?\u201d Rory\u2019s gaze sharpened. \u201cIs that what this is about?\u201d He made a rough sound. \u201cIf I could go back in time, I would run after you. It kills me that I didn\u2019t.\u201d Olive could feel herself weakening. She had to press her hip into the table until it hurt to keep her feet from moving. Carrying her in his direction, where she knew he\u2019d pick her up, hold her, take away the ache in her chest. \u201cThat\u2019s not what this is about.\u201d She barely managed to whisper the lie. \u201cI have to get ready for school. I have to do what\u2019s best for me. Please, just\u2026\u201d Her throat closed up, refusing to let her say go. Rory filled in the blanks with a desolate expression. \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d he said, rubbing the heel of his hand against the middle of his ribcage. \u201cIf you think me leaving is what\u2019s best for you, I have no choice.\u201d Before she could prepare, he came around the table and moved in close, so close she could feel the kiss of his breath on her lips, the heat of his body caressing her skin. \u201cI\u2019ll go, but you listen to me, Olive Cunningham. Go live your life. I hope you believe me when I say I hope you have the best fucking life, baby. I want everything for you.\u201d In her periphery, she could see his fists clench at his sides, as if he wanted to reach for her but wouldn\u2019t. \u201cWhile you\u2019re out living that life, remember I\u2019ll be out there somewhere. Living for you. And if you want me back for one day\u2014one minute\u2014I\u2019m yours. And I\u2019ll do it over and over again, no matter how many times you decide this is wrong afterward. I\u2019ll wait around to worship you, sunbeam. Any time you want me. Do you understand?\u201d He leaned in and she whimpered, preparing for a kiss, reeling from the vow he\u2019d just made. \u201cI\u2019ll love you with this black soul until God tears it out of me.\u201d Even as her heart soared, a voice doubted in the back of her mind. No. No, she couldn\u2019t know for sure if he loved her. He might just think he did. Rory started to back away slowly. I love you, too. Oh God, I love you so much. Her mind screamed the words at his back as he pivoted and walked out the door. The silence that descended was so loud, she could hear the dull pitch of the ocean, layered beneath her own wheezing breaths. Common sense warred with the crazy, authentic, untamed love inside of Olive, keeping her rooted to the spot. He\u2019s gone. He\u2019s gone, so I can\u2019t get hurt. He\u2019s gone, so I\u2019ll hurt forever. It was a losing battle. And in that moment, shaken, lonely, heartbroken and still in shock from what her family had done, she was too weak to fight. * It was late Friday afternoon when Olive realized she\u2019d been sitting in the student library for\u2026three hours. Really? She\u2019d come in to check out a book and that book still sat in front of her on the polished mahogany table. Unopened. She\u2019d been doing this a lot since Tuesday morning. Zoning out. Forgetting why she\u2019d walked into rooms\u2026or why she\u2019d left the apartment. It was probably better that way, her brain blurring reality and making her surroundings feel like lethargic dreams in which she wasn\u2019t actually participating. Olive opened the book sitting in front of her and closed it again, burying her fingers in her hair, inhaling deeply and trying to block out the stunted sound of her heartbeat. It seemed to follow her every place she went, blaming her for its cracks. How was it possible Rory had walked out of her apartment three days ago? It could have happened an hour ago, the horrible finality of the moment was so fresh and sharp. And yet, it also felt like it happened nine months ago. She no longer had any frame of reference for time, except school. Get up, get dressed, get on the bus, pretend to listen in class, go home and stare blankly at convoluted notes. Olive\u2019s gaze drifted over to the screen of her phone, noticing the date\u2014and not for the first time. This evening was Rory\u2019s mother\u2019s birthday party. She\u2019d told him she would go and now it was only hours away. What was he feeling? Had he backed out? God, she hoped not. Olive was in the process of pushing back from the table, intending to replace the book on the shelf and make her way to the bus stop, but Leanne plopped down at the table with a smack of her gum, earning them an evil look from the librarian. \u201cHey you,\u201d she said, giving Olive a soft punch in the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re here late.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d As she\u2019d been doing all week, Olive forced a smile on to her face that honestly, just felt freakishly unnatural. But it was better than her alternative downer face. \u201cJust doing some reading before heading back to Long Beach. Why are you here?\u201d \u201cHad a meeting with the guidance counselor.\u201d Olive nodded. \u201cYou walking to the bus stop? I\u2019ll tag along.\u201d \u201cIn a minute.\u201d Leanne drummed her fingers on the table, ignoring the exasperated sigh from the librarian. \u201cTagged you in some pictures on Facebook and you haven\u2019t even commented. Are we even friends if people don\u2019t witness it virtually?\u201d \u201cSorry, I\u2026\u201d Olive snatched up her phone and tapped the blue and white icon. \u201cI haven\u2019t been on. I haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d \u201cBeen doing much of anything?\u201d Her friend passed her a half-smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve been behaving like a zombie. I was worried our professor was going to use you as a case study. Classic Incurable Heartbreak-itis, wouldn\u2019t you agree, class?\u201d She massaged her forehead with three fingers. \u201cUgh, we\u2019ve only been friends for, like, a month, and I\u2019ve swung between hormonally charged and despondent. No judgment for cutting your losses and running. Seriously.\u201d \u201cShut up.\u201d Leanne nodded at Olive\u2019s phone. \u201cWell. Comment, dammit. Get back in my good graces.\u201d \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Olive went to her notifications and saw that Leanne had tagged her in four photos. When she clicked on the first one, her heart went flying up into her mouth. Rory. There he was. Behind the bar in the Castle Gate. He looked\u2026devastated. Crazed, even. Whatever he was looking at had upset him greatly. To the point that Jamie was restraining him. \u201cWhen did you take this?\u201d \u201cThe night we went out with those senior douches.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI snapped it when we walked into the bar and I recognized Rory from the milkshake shop. That\u2019s around the time he saw Zed\u2019s arm around your shoulders.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d Olive said, sounding small. Desperate to see more of the man she\u2019d been missing like an amputated limb, she swiped to the next picture and her stomach took a dive. Taken the day he\u2019d picked her up from school, the photo showed Rory leaning against his bike like the world\u2019s most delicious bad boy, grinning as she approached. Olive\u2019s pulse turned choppy, that familiar loneliness stealing over her. Shit. Oh shit. She missed him so badly. How had she not fully realized the way Rory looked at her? Like she was\u2026walking on water or something. Urgency trickled into her bloodstream. As if she needed to get out of there. But she remained in the seat, needing to see another picture of Rory more than oxygen. It was them in the milkshake shop, sitting in the booth. That very first day. Olive didn\u2019t even have the words to describe the shot. It was\u2026 Love at first sight. No arguments. No denying it. Rory\u2019s jaw was flexed, his green eyes awed. Olive looked like she was trying to catch a mouthful of bees. And they both looked a little scared. \u201cWow.\u201d Moisture ran down her cheeks. \u201cY-you take incredible pictures.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I was talking to the guidance counselor about. I\u2019m switching my major to photography.\u201d Leanne smirked to let Olive know she was kidding. \u201cOlive, that fucker is crazy about you. I don\u2019t know what happened, but there has to be a solution.\u201d Olive scrolled to the final picture and the breath clogged in her lungs. \u201cWhen\u2026\u201d \u201cThat afternoon we studied at that outdoor caf\u00e9. Remember?\u201d Barely. There were bits and pieces, but if she recalled correctly, the study date was the day after she and Rory broke up on the sidewalk across the street from her building. And yet there he was, in the background of the picture, watching her from a distance. He was getting ready to turn and leave, seeming almost exasperated with himself. But there was no denying the absolute yearning on his tired, unshaven face. It was stark and obvious and breathtaking. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me he was there?\u201d \u201cMaybe I should have.\u201d Leanne shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d only seen you guys together once before that day. I wasn\u2019t sure if he was stalking you or just\u2026fucking heartsick. Guess I wanted to be sure it was the latter before I encouraged you to get back in touch with him, but that happened all by itself.\u201d She flung her arms out dramatically. \u201cNow here we are again.\u201d Olive stared at the picture until her vision blurred. He\u2019d never really left her, had he? To a degree, she\u2019d known that. Known that he\u2019d escorted her bus to school, driven past her building. Having proof that he\u2019d missed her, that he\u2019d never checked out of their relationship\u2026it was powerful knowledge. She\u2019d never truly been abandoned by Rory. Not even for one single day. Rory\u2019s name was highlighted, meaning he\u2019d been tagged in the pictures. After only a moment\u2019s hesitation, Olive tapped on it and was taken to his profile. Nothing had changed. He still had the same picture of them behind the school. They were still listed as In a Relationship. He probably hadn\u2019t logged on once since she\u2019d made the accounts. He\u2019d never had any use for social media\u2026 No. Wait, he had been on Facebook. Olive\u2019s hand slowly came up to cover her mouth. He\u2019d checked in at the milkshake shop. Every day since she\u2019d thrown him out. Oh God. She\u2019d thrown him out of her apartment. Out of her life. How could she have done that? She was in love with this man. Fierce, unmovable love\u2014and he felt the same for her. Not being in his arms at that very second was agonizing. While you\u2019re out living that life, remember I\u2019ll be out there somewhere. Living for you. And if you want me back for one day\u2014one minute\u2014I\u2019m yours. And I\u2019ll do it over and over again, no matter how many times you decide this is wrong afterward. I\u2019ll wait around to worship you, sunbeam. Any time you want me. Do you understand? Olive stood fast enough to send her chair flying backward. She hadn\u2019t lost him yet. She could fix this. God, please let me be able to fix this. When Rory told her he would wait indefinitely, she believed him. She trusted him. He would never hurt her again. She would never hurt him again, either. And she\u2019d start by keeping her promise. Olive fumbled with her phone until she found the right contact and hit send. \u201cJiya?\u201d A hum of reservation was her only greeting. Fair enough. Jiya was loyal to Rory, and Olive was grateful for that. He deserved to have people in his corner. Still, thank God they\u2019d traded phone numbers the day Jiya had driven her home from Rory\u2019s house. \u201cCan you tell me the address for the birthday party?\u201d Silence passed. \u201cPlease?\u201d A moment later, Olive leapt up from her chair and drew Leanne into a hug. \u201cThank you for helping me pull my head out of my ass.\u201d She squeezed her friend hard. \u201cI owe you big time.\u201d With that, she ran from the library, backpack in hand. \u201cI still don\u2019t see any comments,\u201d Leanne called after her. \n CHAPTER SEVENTEEN Rory\u2019s hands protested as he turned the bolt connecting the table to its base. He was beginning to strip the metal by twisting the screwdriver over and over, but he was enjoying the strain in his hands. It lessened the pressure in his chest by one percent\u2014and for now, that was just enough to keep him from falling off the deep end. Finally, he dropped the screwdriver and sat back on the floor. He looked around at the overturned tables. Old ones that used to grace the dining room upstairs but had since been retired to storage downstairs. Every single one of them had been flipped over, the bases detached and refastened, the tops sanded down. He\u2019d been in the basement of the Castle Gate since last night completing the task. The chair legs were next. That might prevent him for another couple hours from going to find Olive. Just to see her. Just to make sure she was all right. Was one glimpse so much to ask? He buried his head in his hands and felt stickiness oozing from his palms, blood mixed with grease that he quickly wiped on his jeans. Rory was in hell. How he\u2019d managed to survive since Tuesday without seeing Olive was beyond him. Could he manage it for the rest of his life? No. No fucking way. He had to leave town. If he saw her with another guy, rationality wouldn\u2019t be an option. Hell, he was bleeding and sweating in a dark basement\u2014he wasn\u2019t rational now. Just like he\u2019d been doing for the last seventy-eight hours, he replayed the scene in Olive\u2019s apartment. How she\u2019d been white as a sheet when he\u2019d come out of the bedroom. How she\u2019d jumped when he spoke. He still had a suspicion that something happened before he woke up. That he was missing a piece of the puzzle. Still, there was no denying that he\u2019d hurt her. She\u2019d been harboring pain since the first time he\u2019d left\u2014and Jesus Christ, knowing that he\u2019d hurt Olive in any way was like nails driving into his skull. He\u2019d missed it. He\u2019d missed how badly she\u2019d been affected by their break-up. If he\u2019d known, if he\u2019d had a fucking inkling, he would have spent every second reassuring her. Now it was too late. He\u2019d lost the girl of his dreams. No, that wasn\u2019t right. She was the reason he\u2019d started to dream again. Feeling that familiar constriction in his throat, Rory cleared it hard as he could and snatched up the screwdriver, walking on his knees toward the next defunct table. Before he could begin the exhaustive process of unscrewing the ancient, rusted bolts, the light in the basement came on. He squinted toward the stairs to find Jamie and Andrew at the top, identical expression of what the fuck on their faces. When they\u2019d opened the door, sounds from the bar upstairs came flooding in and Rory realized it must be early evening. Jesus, how long had he been down there? \u201cHey, man,\u201d Andrew said, descending the stairs, Jamie behind him. \u201cWe\u2019re on the way to mom\u2019s party. Stopped by to pick you up.\u201d The party was today? Rory swiped the back of his wrist across his forehead, probably leaving a streak of filth behind. Olive was supposed to go with him to see his mother for the first time in years, but there wasn\u2019t a hope in hell of that now. More than anything, he wanted to stay there on the floor, causing himself physical pain to distract from the destruction of his heart. He wouldn\u2019t, though. Olive had woken something up inside of him. The need to be a better man. Not only for her, but himself. That was why he hadn\u2019t immediately gotten shitfaced when Olive kicked him to the curb. He wouldn\u2019t go back to that. He wouldn\u2019t go back to being unworthy of her. Unworthy of respect. Even if he couldn\u2019t have Olive anymore, he wouldn\u2019t squander the spirit of hope and optimism she\u2019d handed him like a selfless gift. If he squandered what she\u2019d given him, he squandered Olive. And the difference she\u2019d made in him was all he had left of her. Though it was difficult, Rory braced a hand on the wall and struggled to his feet, his legs half asleep from being in awkward positions on the hard concrete floor. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said, sounding like his vocal cords had been severed. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Jamie came forward and pried the screwdriver out of his hand, unable to hide his wince at the condition of Rory\u2019s hand. \u201cLet\u2019s swing by the house first and grab you a shower. Maybe a change of clothes.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t. I have to just go like this. If I stop to think, I\u2019ll just stop. I\u2019ll just stop.\u201d After a few seconds of silence, Andrew coughed into his fist. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got some extra shirts down here. They probably say Bud Light on them, but\u2026\u201d While his older brother rummaged through boxes, Jamie went into the small employee bathroom, emerging with a fist full of wet paper towels. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Rory had been caring for himself out of necessity since he could remember. He\u2019d been the last kid to come along, after the bright, shiny idea of a happy family had gone out the window for his parents. After their relationship had gone from occasionally volatile to strictly volatile. So he\u2019d stayed out of the way, got himself ready for school. Fed himself when necessary. But hell if Rory didn\u2019t stand there in the basement of the Castle Gate and let Jamie clean his face and hands while Andrew changed his soiled shirt. He just couldn\u2019t do it himself today. Maybe tomorrow. On the way out of the bar, Andrew stole an order of French fries from the kitchen and ordered Rory to eat them. He sat in the back of Andrew\u2019s car now\u2014Jamie in the passenger seat\u2014eating what tasted to him like cardboard out the Styrofoam container. The Revivalists drifted through the speakers, but the windows were down and the rush of the wind prevented Rory from making out the words. It was overcast outside, getting ready to rain and he was glad for it. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to stand the sunshine and face his mother, his guilt, all in one day. Jamie made eye contact with him in the rearview mirror. \u201cYou good?\u201d Rory managed a nod. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine. You\u2019ll wonder why you stayed away so long.\u201d They drove without speaking for a while. \u201cYou want to talk about what happened with Olive?\u201d Jamie sent their older brother a look. \u201cHave I ever complimented your impeccable sense of timing?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Rory set the fries aside and massaged the bridge of his nose. When was the last time he\u2019d slept? Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Olive backing away from him, so he\u2019d flat out stopped trying. \u201cShe gave me the smart girl look.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Andrew asked. He let his head fall back against the seat, way too exhausted and empty to have the conversation. \u201cShe\u2019s focusing on school. She needs people around her who value the same things. I don\u2019t blame her. I\u2026don\u2019t blame her.\u201d He swallowed the knot in his throat. \u201cShe might have let me try to be what she needed, but\u2026I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t worth the risk when I\u2019d already left and hurt her. Don\u2019t blame her, okay? She\u2019s fucking perfect,\u201d he finished under his breath. \u201cJust don\u2019t let me go see her. I told her I\u2019d let her live her life. If I see her, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d Jamie turned in the passenger seat. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cBeg. I\u2019ll fucking beg to have her back.\u201d He blew out a breath. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need that.\u201d It took another fifteen minutes to reach Queens and they eventually turned down the block to their aunt\u2019s house where Molly Prince had been living for the past four years. Rory couldn\u2019t even remember the last time he\u2019d been there. Probably for Thanksgiving or one of the other holidays they only celebrated casually now. The street had been cleaned up, repaved. Trees lined either side, the same bodega sat on the corner, but it had gotten a new awning. Rain had started falling lightly from the sky now and the windshield wipers squeaked as Andrew parallel parked along the curb. Andrew shut off the engine and met Rory\u2019s eyes in the rearview. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re coming, so why don\u2019t you get your head on straight and come in when you\u2019re ready?\u201d Jaw tight, Rory nodded, grateful for the silence that descended when the car was empty. He\u2019d been dreading the moment he would see his mother again for so long. Now that it was here, though? It wasn\u2019t as daunting. Maybe because he\u2019d unburdened himself to Olive about how he\u2019d left his mother to face the abuse alone\u2026and she\u2019d still wanted him. For a little while, only. But that still counted for something. No, it counted for everything. He could do this. He might be at his weakest today, but overall, he was stronger from his time with Olive. He was a better version of himself. She\u2019d made him take a look at himself in the mirror and realize he didn\u2019t want to be lacking anymore. Made him realize he was in control of the future and could move on from the past, little by little. God, he wished she was there. Rain started to come down heavier on the roof of the car, signaling an imminent downpour. He already looked like shit and didn\u2019t need to resemble a drowned rat on top of his three-day beard and sunken eyes. Better get inside now. After several bracing breaths through his nose, Rory pushed out of the car, not bothering to shield himself from the rain as his long strides ate up the sidewalk. He made it to the end of the walkway leading to the house\u2026and that\u2019s where his head of steam started to evaporate. Everything inside him felt so fucking unsteady. Could he really go in there and come face to face with his mother in this weakened state? What if she resented him? Would he be able to handle that when he\u2019d already been cut off at the knees by Olive not wanting him anymore? The rain started to pick up while he hesitated at the end of the path. Make a decision. His breathing turned choppy, his feet inching backward\u2014 \u201cRory!\u201d His head whipped to the right. And there was Olive, running toward him down the sidewalk, soaked. Soaked head to toe in sandals and a blue and white flowery dress, looking more beautiful than anything he\u2019d ever witnessed in his entire life. He turned on a dime, his skin screaming for contact with hers\u2014but he stopped short, his hands dropping back to his sides. Why was she there? Don\u2019t hope. Don\u2019t you dare fucking hope she came to be with you. It would burn him at the stake if that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cOlive,\u201d he rasped, feeling like a leashed animal being held back by sheer willpower instead of a harness. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d \u201cI\u2026\u201d She took a step closer, pushing wet hair out of her face. \u201cI told you I\u2019d go with you. To the party.\u201d His mind raced, trying to read between the lines. \u201cYou came because you didn\u2019t want to break a promise?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet. That\u2019s just like you, sunbeam. But please go home. Don\u2019t you know it\u2019s killing me to look at you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She covered her face with her hands, then let them drop. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I said, Rory. For making you leave. I was wrong. I-I\u2026\u201d A big hiccup left her mouth. \u201cI miss you so much, I can\u2019t think or eat or sleep or read. Why are you looking at me like I\u2019m a bomb that might go off at any second? I know I deserve it, but\u2026\u201d The words I miss you so much were winging around Rory\u2019s brain like boomerangs. She missed him. She missed him. He opened his mouth to ask her what that meant, but it occurred to him in one fell swoop that she was getting more drenched by the second. What if she got sick? No, he wouldn\u2019t let that happen. Praying the car door hadn\u2019t locked behind him, Rory guided her to Andrew\u2019s vehicle and pulled the back seat door handle, breathing a sigh of relief when it opened. \u201cLet\u2019s talk in here. I can\u2019t concentrate when you\u2019re getting wet.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d As soon as the door closed, Rory was in a potent combination of heaven and hell. He was near enough to Olive in the back seat that their thighs brushed, but he wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to be touched yet. So he just waited. Waited, breathed and stayed as still as possible so he wouldn\u2019t lunge for the girl staring up at him with the most incredible eyes on the planet. The girl he loved so much, he was half-delirious just sharing the same oxygen with her. Olive\u2019s inhale was stuttered. \u201cThe morning I asked you to leave, I woke up to a text from my mother. They\u2019d turned my old bedroom into a toy unboxing space. For the channel.\u201d Her audible swallow mingled with the rain pelting the rear window. \u201cIt was like being abandoned all over again and then I c-couldn\u2019t think of anything but the time you left. And how bad it would hurt if you did it again. And I just got so scared.\u201d Her fingers twisted in the damp hemline of her dress. \u201cI invented reasons you probably like me, because I was so positive you would stop a-and leave again. Maybe you liked me because you needed to rescue someone, because of the time you couldn\u2019t.\u201d She gave him a meaningful look. \u201cI just needed a reason\u2014any reason\u2014to push you away so I could avoid being\u2026dropped. So maybe I am a na\u00efve girl, Rory. Maybe I am. Because being without you is terrible no matter how it happens and I\u2019ve sped it along.\u201d A sob pushed out of her mouth, her body beginning to shake. \u201cAnd I\u2019m in love with you and you won\u2019t even hold me now. I\u2019ve ruined everything. I\u2019ve\u2014\u201d Rory\u2019s arms were around her in a split second, gathering her tightly against his chest and dragging her back across the seat into his lap. She straddled him as natural as could be, their bodies locking together like two halves of a whole. His heart lurched repeatedly, shocked over going from broken to complete so fast, and he pressed a hoarse sound into her hair, running his hands over every inch of her he could reach. Her head, her back, her hips, her face. \u201cDid you just say you\u2019re in love with me?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, nodding. \u201cYes. I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean what I said. About needing only people from school in my life. I was lying. D-did I ruin this\u2014\u201d \u201cOlive.\u201d Every ounce of feeling inside of him\u2014disbelief, honor, relief\u2014went into that single use of her name. His mind raced between every word she\u2019d said, no idea where to land first, returning over and over again to the last part. This girl loved him. She loved him back. Was he dreaming? No. No, the weight of her in his lap was real. She was there. Craving eye contact, he clasped her face in his hands, bringing their heads together. \u201cI love you. I fucking love you. I always will. Always. Let\u2019s get that straight first.\u201d A shudder passed through her and she sagged against his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare be relieved by that. You think I could stop loving you?\u201d Looking into his eyes, she shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t hold you at first because I would have broken if you were just here to keep a promise. And not because you needed me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m here because I need you,\u201d she said against his mouth, scooting closer on his lap. \u201cI\u2019m here because I need you so bad.\u201d Olive\u2019s pussy pressed down, so hot and sweet on his cock and the flesh filled with pressure. That horrible, wonderful weight only she could satisfy. While they breathed against each other\u2019s mouths, faster and faster, her hips starting to roll, the rain began coming down hard, turning the back seat into its own private world where they were the only two people who existed. \u201cLook at me.\u201d Never taking his attention off of her, Rory dug his wallet out of his pocket and tossed it on the seat, his fingers searching for the square foil packet he kept tucked in the billfold. \u201cOlive, baby. Do you honestly think I rescued you? I\u2019m the one who was drowning before you pulled me to shore. Look at me, sitting outside my mother\u2019s birthday party, someplace I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever find myself. All because you believed in me.\u201d Her eyes were soft and damp, running over his face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I doubted how you feel.\u201d \u201cNo. Don\u2019t apologize,\u201d he said gruffly, peeling the wet hem of her dress up, up her thighs, bunching the sodden material around her hips. \u201cI just wish you\u2019d told me about the text message, baby. About what they\u2019d done. I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s hard for me to understand how someone could know you\u2026and not want to keep you close as possible. It makes me feel so fucking helpless because I can\u2019t fix it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t need you to fix anything for me,\u201d she said, brushing their lips together, side to side. \u201cJust\u2026\u201d \u201cJust what?\u201d She looked down. \u201cI don\u2019t like knowing that you were waiting for me to break up with you. That you had some plan to leave me alone, let me live my life, at the first sign of trouble.\u201d Rory understood Olive more in that moment. She didn\u2019t want casual. She needed to be secure in the knowledge that he wasn\u2019t budging. That his presence in her life was as solid and indestructible. If it took from now until the end of time, he would make sure she never questioned that he\u2019d be standing beside her forever. Unable to wait another second, Rory teased her mouth into a reunion kiss that escalated quickly, tongues finding each other and mating, heads slanting. Her thighs turned restless around his hips almost immediately, her fingers tugging at the collar of his shirt to bring him closer. And fuck, he\u2019d missed those little whimper sounds. Rory reached down between their bodies and unzipped his jeans, wincing as he pulled out the source of his ache. He covered himself quickly with the condom, pushing aside Olive\u2019s thong with the head of his dick, leaving himself positioned at her entrance. But not quite inside. Just pressing, pressing, letting her wetness coat the latex. \u201cIt\u2019s yours whenever you want to start riding it,\u201d he gritted out, leaning back so he could watch the lips of her pussy part, hugging his cock and sliding down a few inches, Olive working her hips to take him inside, her fingernails digging into his shoulders. \u201cWhen I\u2019m deep as you can handle me, we\u2019re going to have a little talk.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d she gasped, turning glassy-eyed. \u201cTalk. S-sure.\u201d Rory\u2019s heart swelled with love, but lust surged up and demanded attention as Olive\u2019s tight pussy rippled and squeezed around the entire throbbing length of him. \u201cGood girl,\u201d he managed, finding her taut ass cheeks in his hands, easing her into a rhythm that made her mouth form an O. \u201cThat\u2019s right, baby. It\u2019s a perfect fit.\u201d He slapped her bottom lightly, the smack sound echoing in the back seat. \u201cFuck your man.\u201d \u201cRory,\u201d she moaned, seeking out his mouth for a kiss. He gave it to her and then some, growling deep in his throat as she rolled into a faster pace, learning on the fly exactly how to angle her hips so that sweet clit rubbed on his cock every time she moved. \u201cI\u2019m going to come so fast. I can\u2019t help it. Missed you. Need you.\u201d \u201cTime for our talk, Olive.\u201d The love inside him expanded to include a little darkness. A lot of possessiveness. Those things had always been there, ready to bleed into the intense feelings she\u2019d stirred, but Rory\u2019s instinct rose up and set them free now. To plunder. Because his soul told him Olive needed them. \u201cI\u2019m done being noble. If you ever ask me to leave again,\u201d he rasped against her mouth. \u201cI won\u2019t. Fucking. Go. Is that what you want to hear?\u201d Olive\u2019s nod was jerky, excitement lighting her gray eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d He brought his mouth over to her ear, breathing against it. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to call the cops, Olive. Tell them to bring an army. That\u2019s what it\u2019ll taken to drag me out. Away from my girl.\u201d \u201cIt won\u2019t happen. It\u2019ll never happen.\u201d \u201cIf it does, I\u2019ll still come back.\u201d He kissed her hard, swallowing her sobs with a greedy mouth. \u201cThis is how obsession works. Is. This. What you need?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she cried out, riding him hard. Fast. \u201cThat\u2019s what I need, Rory.\u201d \u201cDone.\u201d Rory began lifting his hips in sharp thrusts, meeting every twist and grind of her hips, and Olive gasped, increasing her pace, gaining more and more momentum. \u201cChrist, baby. Baby. You\u2019re getting me off so good.\u201d Knowing if she didn\u2019t come in the next thirty seconds, he was in danger of peaking first, Rory undid the top three buttons of her dress, pushing aside the wet material to suck her nipples through the thin silk of her bra\u2014and her pussy seized up around him, broken versions of his name filling the car as she shook through an orgasm. Rory surged up into her tightness one final time and roared, the climax pounding through him with such force, his lungs wouldn\u2019t fill for long moments, his vision blurring. There was nothing but Olive and the love overflowing their hearts into the back seat of the car. They clung to each other for several minutes as the rain slowed into a pitter patter, their mouths meeting in slow, meandering kisses, their hearts pounding closely together, as if attempting to merge into one. \u201cI love you, Olive. My God, I love you so much.\u201d \u201cI love you, too, Rory.\u201d She kissed his chin, his cheek, his mouth, resting her cheek on his shoulder with a contented sigh he planned to hear every day for the rest of his life. \u201cAre you ready to go inside?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m ready for anything, as long as you\u2019re mine.\u201d He wrapped her in a bear hug. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not just going to see my family. We\u2019re going to see yours, Olive.\u201d She lifted her head and gifted him with a beautiful smile. And a few minutes later when they knocked on the door and Rory\u2019s mother answered, bursting into tears and pulling him into her arms, he wondered how a man could do anything but succeed with so much love coming at him from two directions. The remaining cracks in his foundation were filled with hope. Knowledge that the future would be nothing but bright, especially when his mother hugged Olive, too, already halfway to loving his girlfriend. As if anyone could help it. Rory vowed to himself that Olive would have a special place with his family. It would be hers, as much as his. Everything he was capable of giving would be hers. For as long as he was breathing. THE END \n Want more from Tessa Bailey? Here\u2019s a sneak peek at RUNAWAY GIRL\u2026 A swoony, sexy romance between a gruff, military man and a beauty pageant coach that just ditched her own wedding\u2026 CHAPTER ONE Naomi I\u2019m fifteen minutes away from marrying the man who ordered me the wrong white wine at our rehearsal dinner last night. There are definitely far better reasons to get cold feet, but the lemony Pinot Grigio clings to all sides of my throat now like a reminder. He doesn\u2019t know you. I scan my reflection in the mirror, looking for flaws. The smallest thing counts. A flyaway blonde hair, a wrinkle in my custom Pnina Tornai wedding dress, my diamond pendant being slightly off center. But no. I may as well have stepped right out of a bridal magazine. A real life Photoshop job, primped, airbrushed and ready to be shipped down the aisle. That\u2019s exactly what this feels like. I\u2019ve been packaged. My attributes were all selected from a pull down menu. Pageant queen. Check. Hostess skills. A must for any southern housewife! Writes a mean thank you card. Why, of course! After all, I\u2019m preparing to marry the next mayor of Charleston. The rest of my life will be lived beneath the finicky microscope of old money and my own peers, who judge twice as harshly. I\u2019ve been groomed for this my whole life. Cotillion. Finishing school. Private tutors. Non-stop critiques from my mother. I am in this to win it. But with ten minutes on the clock, I\u2019m not sure what winning is anymore. What. Is. Winning? I fall onto a cushy divan\u2014gracefully of course\u2014and force air to enter my nose and leave my mouth. In. Out. In the full length mirror\u2019s reflection, I watch my bridesmaids plow through a bottle of champagne behind me, speculating in hushed tones on what my wedding guests will wear to the big day. It\u2019s the tip of spring so yellows, blues and pinks are likely to make an appearance. They talk about it like the weather report. I should get up and join them, right? Any second now, they\u2019re going to realize I\u2019ve been quiet too long. I have been quiet too long. Where are my manners? They\u2019re here for me. I should be thanking them for their support and handing out their wedding party gifts, but all I can do is think of Pinot Grigio. I\u2019m a Sauvignon Blanc girl. Everyone knows that. A little hiccup leaves my mouth, but I disguise it with a polite cough and stand up once more, smoothing creases from the embroidered satin of my dress. I notice my maid of honor watching me with a wrinkled brow and give her a pinky wave, forcing a smile until she returns to a conversation which has now turned to which of the groomsmen are single. Five minutes. Oh God. The sick citrus flavor has now traveled to my stomach, stewing and gurgling. I haven\u2019t thrown up due to nerves since my first pageant at age four. I won\u2019t start now. I can\u2019t. This is a thirty-thousand-dollar dress. A vomit stain wouldn\u2019t exactly match the beading. And worse, my friends have eagle eyes. They would definitely notice and they would know. They would know I\u2019m panicking. I can\u2019t have that. The future mayor\u2019s wife is a cool customer. Unflappable. She makes everything look easy. That is who I am. Not a jittery girl with back sweat. A flash of black outside catches my eye. Not exactly an eye-catching color, but among the pastels, the dark figure crossing the street outside the church draws me closer to the window. It takes me a moment to place the identity of the black-haired woman stomping up the church steps with a defiant expression, but when I do, my feet go from cold to frostbitten. Addison Potts. What is my estranged cousin doing at my wedding? Lord knows she wasn\u2019t invited. Her side of the family hasn\u2019t been welcome at so much as Sunday brunch in decades. I haven\u2019t seen her in Charleston since we were in our twenties. Possibly longer than that, since we never ran in the same circles. My circle is currently popping open their second bottle of champagne\u2014and an answering pop happens somewhere in my midsection as Addison pauses outside the church doors. Not hesitating, exactly. Just giving guests a chance to look at her. Encouraging them. Shaking things up. A small laugh puffs out of me, creating condensation on the window. Where has she been? What has she been doing while I prepared to be the keeper of someone\u2019s social calendar? I don\u2019t know. But I bet whatever she did\u2026she did it for herself. On her own terms. She\u2019s been living. That much is clear. Addison frowns and glances up at the window, but I duck back before she sees me. My heart beats wildly in my throat. What would Addison see if she looked at me? Exactly what I am. A pampered southern belle with the appropriate amount of friends. An inner circle of four, an immediate network of thirty-two and a broader outer circle of two hundred and fifty. A blonde beauty queen whose interests include scrapbooking, creating signature cocktails for parties and fancy gift wrapping. My long lost cousin would probably laugh at me. Maybe she should. When I look back down at the church steps, Addison has disappeared into the church, leaving a stir in her wake. And for the first time in my life, I understand envy. I\u2019ve never caused a stir. Not once. I\u2019ve inspired approval. Matching sweater sets don\u2019t exactly drop jaws, do they? \u201cNaomi,\u201d calls my maid of honor, Harper. \u201cI promised your mother we\u2019d have you walking down the aisle at three o\u2019clock sharp. We should head down.\u201d A bridesmaid leans a lazy hip against the liquor cart, jostling the bottles. \u201cYes, let\u2019s not cross the woman. I want to make it to the reception with my limbs intact.\u201d Despite the cyclone brewing in her belly, Naomi\u2019s tinkling laugh filled the room. \u201cLadies, would you mind terribly if I had a moment alone with Harper? We\u2019ll be down in a shake.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d chirped three bridesmaids, far too brightly. What am I doing? This impromptu meeting is not on the agenda. A quick glance at the clock tells me I am now late for my own wedding. If my mother has to come up the steps, she will be breathing fire and that\u2019s the last thing I need right now. We don\u2019t want to keep Elijah waiting. No. No, we never want to do anything to upset this perfectly perfect ideal life I\u2019ve landed. This is what I\u2019ve always wanted. Wifehood to a rich, respected man. A military hero who inspires sighs of gratitude when he walks down the street. A good man. An honest man who will stay true to his vows. A kind, compassionate human being. That is Elijah Montgomery DuPont, the next mayor of this fine town. He just happens to think I prefer Pinot Grigio. That\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg, though, isn\u2019t it? I spent hours getting coiffed for the rehearsal dinner last night and he looked right through me. Sure, he kissed my cheek and nodded as I spoke. Made sure I arrived to my assigned seat without injury or assault. I love Elijah. He just doesn\u2019t love me. And after seeing Addison Potts outside on the church steps, I know exactly why. Where my cousin is vivacious and exciting, I\u2019m a cookie cutter, boring-as-beige debutante who\u2019s never lived outside of the staunch parameters laid out for her. I haven\u2019t experienced anything, unless someone planned it for me. I\u2019m not interesting or worthy of anyone\u2019s undivided attention. My fianc\u00e9 is probably standing in front of the altar right now, dreading the next fifty years of eye-glazing conversation about the country club and charity planning committees. Me. I\u2019m going to be inflicting the boring. Oh Lord. No. I can\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t want to do it. I have to get out of here. I have to save Elijah. And, more importantly\u2014I think\u2014I have to go do some living. Just for me. \u201cNaomi.\u201d Harper waves a hand in front of my face. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling your name, honey. What did you want to talk to me about?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going down there,\u201d I whisper, wide-eyed. Well, now. There it is. My first dropped jaw. \u201cWhat now?\u201d My gaze bounces around the room, cataloguing everything I need to take with me. Purse. My car keys are zipped in the inner pocket. I definitely need those because my suitcase is in back, packed full of honeymoon clothes. As long as I have them, I won\u2019t need to go home and risk my mother hog-tying me and dragging me back to the church. I can just\u2026go. Excitement is building in my chest. I\u2019m really doing this. I should be terrified, but knots are loosening inside me instead. I\u2019m not getting married today. I\u2019m making this choice. With a shaky swallow, I swish toward the secretary in the corner and scribble out a note with a trembling hand. I\u2019m sorry, Elijah. I couldn\u2019t do it. I hesitate before penning the next part. Am I going to completely sever ties with my fianc\u00e9? Yes. And no. I need to give Elijah his freedom. It\u2019s only fair after what I\u2019m about to do. I can\u2019t ask him to wait while I figure myself out. That wouldn\u2019t be fair. But I know I could search this entire world and not find a more decent man. So while I\u2019m going to break off our betrothal? In my heart\u2026I\u2019m going to keep hope alive that we\u2019ll find our way back to each other. If we\u2019re meant to be, he\u2019ll forgive me one day, won\u2019t he? I didn\u2019t want it to end this way, but it\u2019s for the best. Those final words blur together as I stare down at them, until the clock drags my attention away. I\u2019m now ten minutes late for my own wedding. Unheard of. My mother is probably on the way\u2014no, those are her footsteps coming up the stairs now. I have to move. I shove the folded note into Harper\u2019s hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to do this to you, sweetheart, but I need you to give this to Elijah.\u201d She starts to shake her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a good friend, Harper. I wish I had more time to explain, but right now, I need you to stall my mother while I escape down the back staircase.\u201d \u201cBut why?\u201d Harper breathes, fanning herself with the note. \u201cHe\u2019s just so handsome.\u201d There\u2019s no time to answer, though, and I turn from my wide-eyed friend, snatch up my purse and jog toward the staircase door. Not easy in my crystal embellished pumps I had designed after Cinderella\u2019s slippers\u2014which heavens\u2014seems so trite and clich\u00e9 now. It\u2019s dark on the way down to street level, making it feel like a dream. Or a mistake. I\u2019m not supposed to be in the dark, I\u2019m supposed to be walking down the aisle adorned in refracted stained glass lighting. We tested several different positions of the sun before deeming three o\u2019clock the optimal aisle time. I can already hear my mother grinding her molars. We\u2019re losing the sun. Who cares? I laugh as I throw myself through the exit door and click through the parking lot, purse in one hand, the hem of my wedding dress in the other. There isn\u2019t a soul around. No one wants to miss the upper crust betrothal of the town hero and his trophy wife, do they? While that harsh thought stings like an angry bee, it makes me move even faster toward my white Range Rover, parked in the valet section. I want to be more than someone\u2019s blonde Stepford Wife. I want to be\u2026more like Addison. More like the black sheep cousin who walked with her chin up into a church full of people who dislike her. I want to be brave like that. Before that can happen, I need a reason to be brave. I need to see and learn and do. Go back, says a voice in the back of my head. You can\u2019t really be doing this. You don\u2019t have what it takes to survive. That might be true. But I am doing this, regardless. I\u2019m a runaway bride. Within moments, I\u2019m peeling out of the parking lot and gunning it toward the freeway, my veil blowing in the wind. Before I take the on-ramp, though, I pull over and map a sensible route to Florida on my voice guided navigator. One ditched wedding does not a spontaneous woman make. After that, though, I\u2019m on my way. To what? I guess I\u2019ll find out. Get the rest of RUNAWAY GIRL here: https://bit.ly/2NxXzp6 \n Want Access to FREE audiobooks?
