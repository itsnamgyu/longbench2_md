# Question

Which of the following methods is used in this article to calculate the precision similarity of two documents?

# Choices

- A: After converting the document content to bert embedding, calculate the n-grams that occur in the reference and candidate
- B: For each word in the generated text, select the word in the reference text that is most similar to it, and calculate the maximum cosine similarity of the BERT hidden layer representation
- C: For each word in the reference text, select the word in the generated text that is most similar to it, and calculate the maximum cosine similarity of the BERT hidden layer representation
- D: The evaluation of the generated text is regarded as a text generation task, and unsupervised learning is used to evaluate different aspects of the generated text (e.g. informativeness, fluency, or factuality)

# Answer

B
