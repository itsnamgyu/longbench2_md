    "doc": "Excerpt from After She Wrote Him Prologue On Introductions Reading Group Guide A Conversation with the Author Acknowledgments About the Author Back Cover \n For Barbara \n \u201cOpen me carefully\u2026\u201d \u2014Emily Dickinson, \u201cIntimate Letters\u201d \n Dear Hannah, What are you writing? I expect you\u2019ve started something new by now. If not, consider this a nudge from a fan. You have a following, my friend, desperate for the next Hannah Tigone. To paraphrase Spider-Man: With great readership comes great responsibility. Seriously though, I saw An Implausible Country in the bookstore around the corner, yesterday. A place called The Rook\u2026one of those hipster joints where you can get a half-strength turmeric soy latte, and a wheatgrass and birdseed snack with your book. Anyway, the U.S. jacket pops in the wild, in case you were wondering. Photo of it on the new releases shelf attached. I might have bought myself another copy, just so I could brag to the bookseller that I knew the author! I think she was impressed. There was a definite hint of admiration in the way she asked, \u201cDo you need a bag?\u201d I so regret that I was unable to come to New York when you toured last Fall. We could have met after all these years as colleagues and correspondents. I shall make amends by crossing the seas to you in a few months, unless of course you are coming stateside. Perhaps if you were to set a book here, then a research trip might be justified? Still, there might be something fitting about a friendship based on a common love of words being founded on an exchange of the same. As for your enquiries about how my own book is coming: Well, I spent Friday at the library. I wrote a thousand words and deleted fifteen hundred. Regardless, the Boston Public Library is a nice spot in which to be stood up by the muse. I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s playing hard to get where I\u2019m concerned. I had hoped that the venue might shake loose some inspiration. It\u2019s pretty spectacular\u2014the ceiling in the Reading Room is something to behold. I\u2019m afraid I spent rather a lot of time staring at it. I can\u2019t help but wonder how many frustrated writers have counted the decorative cornices before me\u2026 Perhaps Emerson or Alcott gazed aimlessly at that same plasterwork, or at least its equivalent in the earlier incarnation of the BPL when it was on Boylston Street. It\u2019s vaguely comforting to think that they might have. Anyway, I look forward to hearing about your current project. As always, I\u2019m happy to be a sounding board if you require one\u2014to read chapters as you write, so the feedback is immediate. It\u2019ll give me something to do while I\u2019m in this writing slump, and perhaps your productivity will rub off! And eventually, I might have something for you to read and comment on in return. Regards and so forth, Leo \n Chapter One Writing in the Boston Public Library had been a mistake. It was too magnificent. One could spend hours just staring at the ceiling in the Reading Room. Very few books have been written with the writer\u2019s eyes cast upwards. It judged you, that ceiling, looked down on you in every way. Mocked you with an architectural perfection that couldn\u2019t be achieved by simply placing one word after another until a structure took shape. It made you want to start with grand arcs, to build a magnificent framework into which the artistic detail would be written\u2014a thing of vision and symmetry and cohesion. But that, sadly, isn\u2019t the way I write. I am a bricklayer without drawings, laying words into sentences, sentences into paragraphs, allowing my walls to twist and turn on whim. There is no framework, just bricks interlocked to support each other into a story. I have no idea what I\u2019m actually building, or if it will stand. Perhaps I should be working on a bus. That would be more consistent with my process such as it is. I\u2019m not totally without direction\u2026there is a route of some sort, but who hops on and who gets off is determined by a balance of habit and timing and random chance. There\u2019s always the possibility that the route will be altered at the last minute for weather or accident, some parade or marathon. There\u2019s no symmetry, no plan, just the chaotic, unplotted bustle of human life. Still, ceilings have a wonderful lofty perspective that buses do not. These have gazed down on writers before. Do they see one now? Or just a woman in the library with a blank page before her? Maybe I should stop looking at the ceiling and write something. I force my gaze from its elevated angle. Green-shaded lamps cast soft ellipses of light that define boundaries of territory at the communal reading tables. Spread out, by all means, but stay within the light of your own lamp. I sit at the end of one of dozens of tables placed in precise rows within the room. My table is close enough to the centre of the hall that I can see green lamps and heads bent over books in all directions. The young woman next to me has divested her jacket to reveal full-sleeve tattoos on both arms. I\u2019ve never been inked myself, but I\u2019m fascinated. The story of her life etched on her skin\u2026 She\u2019s like a walking book. Patterns and portraits and words. Mantras of love and power. I wonder how much of it is fiction. What story would I tell if I had to wear it on my body? The woman is reading Freud. It occurs to me that a psychology student would make an excellent protagonist for a thriller. A student, not an expert. Experts are less relatable, removed from the reader by virtue of their status. I write \u201cpsychology student\u201d onto the blank page of my notebook and surround it with a box. And so I hop onto the bus. God knows where it\u2019s going\u2014I just grabbed the first one that came along. Beneath the box I make some notes about her tattoos, being careful not to make it obvious that I am reading her ink. Across from me sits a young man in a Harvard Law sweatshirt. He cuts a classic figure\u2014broad shoulders, strong jaw, and a cleft chin\u2014like he was drawn as the hero of an old cartoon. He\u2019s been staring at the same page of the tome propped before him for at least ten minutes. Perhaps he\u2019s committing it to memory\u2026or perhaps he\u2019s just trying to keep his eyes down and away from the young woman on my left. I wonder what they are to each other: lovers now estranged, or could it be that he is lovelorn and she indifferent? Or perhaps the other way round\u2014is she stalking him? Watching him over the top of Freud? Might she suspect him of something? He certainly looks tormented\u2026 Guilt? He drops his eyes to check his watch\u2014a Rolex, or perhaps a rip-off of the same. To the left of Heroic Chin is another man, still young but no longer boyish. He wears a sport coat over a collared shirt and jumper. I am more careful about looking at him than I am the others because he is so ludicrously handsome. Dark hair and eyes, strong upswept brows. If he catches my gaze he will assume that is the reason. And it isn\u2019t\u2026well, maybe a little. But mostly I am wondering what he might bring to a story. He\u2019s working on a laptop, stopping every now and then to stare at the screen, and then he\u2019s off again, typing at speed. Good Lord, could he be a writer? There are other people in the Reading Room, of course, but they are shadows. Unfocused as yet, while I try to pin a version of these three to my page. I write for a while\u2026scenarios, mainly. How Freud Girl, Heroic Chin, and Handsome Man might be connected. Love triangles, business relationships, childhood friends. Perhaps Handsome Man is a movie star; Heroic Chin, a fan; and Freud Girl, his faithful bodyguard. I smile as the scenarios become increasingly ridiculous and, as I do, I look up to meet Handsome Man\u2019s eyes. He looks startled and embarrassed, and I must, too, because that\u2019s how I feel. I open my mouth to explain, to assure him that I\u2019m a writer, not a leering harasser, but of course this is the Reading Room, and one does not conduct a defence while people are trying to read. I do attempt to let him know I\u2019m only interested in him as the physical catalyst for a character I\u2019m creating, but that\u2019s too complex to convey in mime. He just ends up looking confused. Freud Girl laughs softly. Now Heroic Chin looks up too, and the four of us are looking at each other silently, unable to rebuke or apologize or explain, lest we incur the wrath of the Reading Room Police. And then there is a scream. Ragged and terrified. A beat of silence even after it stops, until we all seem to realise that the Reading Room Rules no longer apply. \u201cFuck! What was that?\u201d Heroic Chin murmurs. \u201cWhere did it come from?\u201d Freud Girl stands and looks around. People begin to pack up their belongings to leave. Two security guards stride in and ask everyone to remain calm and in their seats until the problem can be identified. Some idiot law student starts on about illegal detention and false imprisonment, but, for the most part, people sit down and wait. \u201cIt was probably just a spider,\u201d Heroic Chin says. \u201cMy roommate sounds just like that whenever he sees a spider.\u201d \u201cThat was a woman,\u201d Freud Girl points out. \u201cOr a man who\u2019s afraid of spiders\u2026\u201d Heroic Chin looks about as if his arachnophobic friend might be lurking somewhere. \u201cI apologize if I was staring.\u201d Handsome Man addresses me tentatively. I have enough of an ear for American accents now to tell he\u2019s not from Boston. \u201cMy editor wants me to include more physical descriptions in my work.\u201d He grimaces. \u201cShe says all the women in my manuscript are wearing the same thing, so I thought\u2026 Heck, that sounds creepy! I\u2019m sorry. I was trying to describe your jacket.\u201d I smile, relieved. He\u2019s volunteering to take the bullet. I\u2019ll just be gracious. \u201cIt\u2019s a herringbone tweed, originally a man\u2019s sport coat purchased at a vintage store and retailored so the wearer doesn\u2019t look ridiculous.\u201d I meet his eye. \u201cI do hope you haven\u2019t written down that I look ridiculous.\u201d For a moment, he\u2019s flustered. \u201cNo, I assure you\u2014\u201d And then he seems to realise I\u2019m kidding and laughs. It\u2019s a nice laugh. Deep but not loud. \u201cCain McLeod.\u201d After a second I register that he\u2019s introduced himself. I should too. \u201cWinifred Kincaid\u2026people call me Freddie.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a writer too.\u201d Freud Girl leans over and glances at my notebook. \u201cShe\u2019s been making notes on all of us.\u201d Damn! She grins. \u201cI like Freud Girl\u2026I sound like an intellectual superhero. Better than Tattoo Arms or Nose Ring.\u201d I slam my notebook shut. \u201cAwesome!\u201d Heroic Chin turns to display his profile. \u201cI hope you described my good side and\u2026\u201d he adds, flashing a smile, \u201cI have dimples.\u201d Handsome Man, apparently also known as Cain McLeod, is clearly amused. \u201cWhat are the chances? You two should be more careful who you sit next to.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Marigold Anastas,\u201d Freud Girl announces. \u201cFor your acknowledgements. A-N-A-S-T-A-S.\u201d Not to be outdone, Heroic Chin discloses his name is Whit Metters and promises to sue if either Cain McLeod or I forget to mention his dimples. We\u2019re all laughing when the security guards announce that people may leave if they wish. \u201cDid you find out who screamed?\u201d Cain asks. The security guard shrugs. \u201cProbably some asshole who thinks he\u2019s a comedian.\u201d Whit nods smugly and mouths \u201cspider.\u201d Cain\u2019s brow lifts. \u201cIt was a convincing scream,\u201d he says quietly. He\u2019s right. There was a ring of real mortal terror in the scream. But that\u2019s possibly a writer\u2019s fancy. Perhaps someone simply needed to expel a bit of stress. \u201cI need to find coffee.\u201d \u201cThe Map Room Tea Lounge is the closest,\u201d Cain says. \u201cThey make a decent coffee.\u201d \u201cDo you need more material?\u201d Marigold asks. With coat sleeves covering the ink which had held my attention, I notice that she has beautiful eyes, jewel green and sparkling in a frame of smoky kohl and mascara. \u201cJust coffee,\u201d I reply for both Cain and myself, because I\u2019m not sure which one of us she was asking. \u201cCan I come?\u201d The childlike guilelessness of the question is disarming. \u201cOf course.\u201d \u201cMe too?\u201d Whit now. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be alone. There\u2019s a spider somewhere.\u201d And so we go to the Map Room to found a friendship, and I have my first coffee with a killer. *** Dear Hannah, Bravo! A sharp and intriguing opening. You have made art out of my complaints. The last line is chilling. An excellent hook. I fear that a publisher will ask you to make it the opening line to ensure you catch the first-page browsers. All I can say is: resist! It is perfect as it is. That line, though, is as brave as it is brilliant. Bear in mind that you\u2019ve issued your readers a challenge, declared one of those three (Marigold, Whit, or Cain) will be the killer. They\u2019ll watch them closely from now on, read into every passing nuance. It may make it more difficult to distract their attention from clues in the manuscript and keep them guessing. Still, it\u2019s kind of delicious\u2014particularly as they each seem so likeable. As I said, brave. Dare I hope that since your setting is Boston, you\u2019ll make a research trip here sometime soon? It would be wonderful to suffer for our art face-to-face over martinis in some bar like real writers! In the meantime, I\u2019d be delighted to assist you with sense of place and so forth. Consider me your scout, your eyes and ears in the U.S. A couple of points\u2014Americans don\u2019t use the term jumper (description of Handsome Man). You may want to switch that reference to sweater or pullover. It\u2019s also much less common in the U.S. for women to be as heavily inked as women in Australia. I haven\u2019t seen any full-sleeve tattoos on women, here. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean Marigold can\u2019t have them\u2014perhaps that\u2019s why Winifred notices them particularly. I returned to the Reading Room after I received your email and chapter to check, and I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no explicit rule against talking. It\u2019s more a general civility. Easy to fix. Insert a disapproving shushing neighbour or two on the table and the pressure for silence won\u2019t be lost. I had lunch in the Map Room, so if you need details, let me know. As an Australian, you\u2019ll probably find the coffee appalling out of principle, but since Winifred is American, she is not likely to find it wanting. Do you need somewhere for Freddie to live? If money is no object, you could put her in Back Bay, right in the BPL neighborhood. Many of the apartments are converted Victorian brownstones, but Freddie would have to be an heiress of some sort to afford one! Is she a struggling hopeful, or an author of international renown? The former would probably live somewhere like Brighton or Alston. Let me know if you\u2019d like me to check some buildings for you. I received my tenth rejection letter for the opus yesterday. It feels like something which should be marked. Perhaps I shall buy a cake. This one said my writing was elegant but that they felt I was working in the wrong genre\u2026which I suppose is an indirect way of saying they want my protagonist to be a vampire and the climax to involve an alien invasion\u2026and not the kind with which our President seems preoccupied! I know the repeated rejections are a rite of passage, Hannah, but, honestly, it hurts. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m strong enough for this business. It must be wonderful to be at that stage where you\u2019ve paid your dues, where you know that whatever you write now, it will at least be seriously considered. This stage just feels like a ritual humiliation. Yours somewhat despondently, Leo \n Chapter Two I\u2019m still a little in awe every time I step into the chequerboard foyer of Carrington Square. It\u2019s one of those Victorian brownstones for which Back Bay is famous\u2014a magnificent gabled exterior, renovated to perfection within. My one-bedroom apartment looks out over an internal courtyard featuring landscaped gardens and cast-iron fountains. It\u2019s beautifully furnished and decorated\u2014an address usually beyond the means of a humble writer. In the sitting room, on either side of the marble fireplace, are built-in bookcases in which are stored the works of each of the previous Sinclair scholarship winners who were writers in residence here. The collection is both inspiring and terrifying. Wonderful novels in almost every genre, crafted in the year during which the writer lived in this apartment. In the fifty or so years the scholarship has been running, the apartment has no doubt been refurbished and redecorated several times, but these bookcases remain untouched, sacrosanct. The heart and purpose of this place\u2014sometimes I fancy I can hear it beating. Perhaps it was the bookcases that stilled my pen in the beginning. I had thought that the words would come easily here. A time and place to write\u2014a dream bolstered by the endorsement of the award. And yet I\u2019d felt unworthy, uncertain. I\u2019d choked, and in the first month I\u2019d deleted more than I wrote. But not today. Today I return from the library exhilarated. We had lingered in the Map Room for hours, Cain, Whit, Marigold, and I. It was bizarre, four strangers who seemed to recognize each other, like we\u2019d been friends before in a life forgotten. We talked about all manner of things, laughed about most of it, and poked fun at each other without restraint. It felt like being at home, and I breathed out completely for the first time since I stepped on that flight from Sydney. Cain is a published writer\u2014his first book was reviewed by the New York Times. He doesn\u2019t tell me that last bit; I google him on the way home. The Washington Post called him one of America\u2019s most promising young novelists, and his first book was something of a sensation. Marigold is in fact studying psychology at Harvard, and Whit is failing law. The failing part doesn\u2019t seem to bother him. It is the only way, apparently, that he can avoid being absorbed into the family firm. And so my attention is initially elsewhere when Leo Johnson crosses my path on the stairs. \u201cFreddie! Hello.\u201d Leo is also a writer in residence at Carrington Square. He\u2019s from Alabama originally, though I think he went to Harvard at some point. He holds a fellowship which seems to be the American equivalent of the Sinclair, and occupies an apartment a few doors away from mine. \u201cHow was the library?\u201d he asks. He speaks with a gentle Southern pace that invites you to slow down and chat a while. \u201cGet much work done?\u201d \u201cHow did you know I was at the library?\u201d \u201cOh, I saw you at the Map Room.\u201d He pushes his glasses back up against the bridge of his nose. \u201cI dropped into the BPL to pick up a book I\u2019d reserved, and then I needed coffee. I just happened to see you there. I waved, but I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t see me.\u201d \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t, or I would have asked you to join us.\u201d Leo is the closest thing I have to a colleague. I tell him about the scream. He laughs. \u201cI expect it was some nutcase, or a club initiation of one sort or another. A number of the Harvard clubs are co-ed now.\u201d I raise my brow, uncertain what that has to do with it. \u201cIt seems like the kind of prank that would be conceived in the brain of an adolescent male,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut, of course, a woman would be required to execute it.\u201d I smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t think women might have planned it?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think a woman would have found it that funny\u2026 A man, however, would be delighted with his extraordinary wit.\u201d \u201cRemember that you said that, not me.\u201d I glance up the stairs. \u201cWould you like to come in for a coffee?\u201d Leo shakes his head. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am. There\u2019s a story-cooking gleam in your eyes. I\u2019ll leave you alone to write. Let\u2019s compare notes in the next couple of days.\u201d I agree, relieved. I do feel an urgency to write. And I like Leo even more for the fact that he understands. I open my laptop as soon as I get into the apartment, slipping off my shoes and nesting into the couch. I begin typing, using the monikers Handsome Man, Heroic Chin, and Freud Girl. They appear on my page like a rubbing taken from life, shape and dimension created with words. I\u2019ll give them real names later; for now I don\u2019t want to stem the ideas by trying to work out what to call them. I dwell on the scream. It, too, has a place in this story. The four of us had talked about it at length. How could something like that be unexplained? Someone must have screamed, someone must have had a reason to. Whit brought up spiders again. I think he must have some kind of phobia. We had all agreed to meet at the BPL tomorrow. Actually, Cain and I had agreed to meet, to form a writers\u2019 group of sorts. Marigold and Whit had decided that any group should include them, regardless of its purpose. \u201cWe can be sounding boards,\u201d Marigold insisted. \u201cAnd inspiration,\u201d Whit added. And so it was arranged. It is exciting to have plans, people to meet. I turn on the television, initially for background noise. I\u2019m working, so it\u2019s only sound. A murmur that connects me to the real world as I create one of my own, an anchor barely noticed. Until I hear the words \u201cBoston Public Library today.\u201d I look up. A reporter talking to a camera. \u201c\u2026the body of a young woman was discovered by cleaning staff in the Boston Public Library.\u201d I close the laptop and turn up the volume, leaning forward towards the television. A body. My God, the scream! The reporter tells me nothing more of any use. I switch to another station, but the report is much the same. The body is not identified beyond being that of a young woman. My phone rings. It\u2019s Marigold. \u201cThe news! Did you see the news?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThat scream!\u201d Marigold sounds more excited than frightened. \u201cThat must have been her.\u201d \u201cI wonder why they didn\u2019t find her then.\u201d \u201cMaybe whoever killed her hid the body?\u201d I smile. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say anything about murder, Marigold. She might have screamed because she fell down the stairs.\u201d \u201cIf she\u2019d fallen down the stairs, someone would have found her straight away.\u201d That was true. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll close the library tomorrow?\u201d \u201cMaybe the room she was found in, but surely not the whole library.\u201d Marigold\u2019s voice drops into a part whisper. \u201cIt must have been close to Bates Hall.\u201d \u201cI did think that too.\u201d \u201cWe might have passed him on the way out\u2014the killer, I mean.\u201d I laugh, though it\u2019s possible of course. \u201cIf this were a book, we would have bumped into him at the very least.\u201d \u201cSo we\u2019re still meeting tomorrow?\u201d I don\u2019t hesitate. The cleaner employed by the Sinclair Fellowship comes on Tuesdays, and I prefer to avoid the feeling that I\u2019m in the way, or lazy or unclean, that is part and parcel of having someone clean up after you as an adult. \u201cI\u2019ll be there. We\u2019ll at least find out if the library is closing for any period of time.\u201d We talk for a while longer about other things. Marigold has a paper due on juvenile maternal separation anxiety, which she calls \u201cmommy\u2019s boys and the women who create them.\u201d I\u2019m laughing aloud by the time we arrange a place to meet in case we are not allowed into the BPL. But when the call is over, my mind returns to the scream, the fact that I\u2019d heard it. I\u2019d heard someone die, and however it occurred, I was in no doubt she had been in terror. The fact seems to have a weight of its own, and I feel that weight in the pit of my stomach. The news reports are now labelling the incident a murder. I\u2019m not sure if they have more information or if it is simply an inevitable evolution of sensationalism. Turning up the television, I return to work, guilty that whatever I feel about this poor woman, it does not curtail or slow the words. They are coming quickly, swirling into sentences that are strong and rhythmic, that surprise me with their clarity. It feels a little indecent to write so well in the wake of tragedy. But I do. The story of strangers bonded by a scream. *** Dear Hannah, Well played, my friend, well played! The Sinclair Fellowship is a terrific idea. You can place Winifred in Back Bay without burdening her with vast wealth. And she can be Australian. And you put me in the story! With a Southern accent and my own fellowship. I am overwhelmed! You forgot to mention that Leo was tall and devastatingly attractive, but I suppose that\u2019s a given. Not only that, you\u2019ve introduced a sneaky 4th option into your declaration that the perpetrator was present when Freddie had coffee in the Map Room. Was that your intention? With respect to your first question, yes, I believe Bates Hall would be open the next day. Clearly the murder did not occur there but in one of the surrounding rooms or halls. There are plenty to choose from\u2014I\u2019ve listed a few suggestions below. With some of these you might need to consider the volume of the scream. If it was loud enough to be heard within Bates Hall, then it really would have to have occurred in one of the adjoining rooms. I will be intrigued to read how you are going to explain why a search revealed nothing. I did duck over to the BPL to see if I could spot anything of use. There are some vents that could possibly carry sound from a room farther away, but you would really need some sort of engineering or maintenance plan of the building to be sure. I\u2019m a little wary of asking in case they decide I\u2019m up to no good, but if I get a chance, I\u2019ll see what I can find out. And now the other subject of your email\u2026 God, Hannah, thank you. I really did not expect you to offer to take my manuscript to your agent. I\u2019m embarrassed that you might think that I was fishing for that. I assure you I wasn\u2019t. And though I\u2019m too proud to accept your help, I\u2019m too desperate to turn it down. So, my manuscript is attached with the last of my dignity. Bear in mind that if you think it\u2019s terrible and never pass it on, I\u2019ll never know. And I\u2019ll never ask because there must be a way for our friendship to survive my lack of talent. I\u2019m expressing this badly\u2026which I suppose does not bode well for my manuscript, but I am grateful and touched that you would want to help me. Anyway, I look forward to your next chapter, and I shall see if I can find anything that might be useful in placing your dead body in an appropriate place. Again, with my thanks and admiration, Leo \n Chapter Three I spot Cain in the Newsfeed Caf\u00e9 just inside the Johnson Building, where we\u2019d arranged to meet, and wave. He smiles when he sees me, and I am reminded that he is very handsome. He\u2019s buying coffee and signals madly to see if I want one. I nod, and when I reach him he hands me a macchiato. \u201cNo sugar, right?\u201d I am impressed he remembered. We find a table at which to sip coffee and wait for Marigold and Whit. And, of course, we talk about the body found the night before. \u201cWhere do you think they found her?\u201d I ask. I don\u2019t really know the library that well. I\u2019ve only been using it for a few days. \u201cThat\u2019s what I can\u2019t figure out,\u201d he says. \u201cWe heard her scream, so she had to be in one of the rooms around Bates Hall\u2026but they were searched.\u201d \u201cUnless the scream had nothing, in fact, to do with the body.\u201d He frowns. \u201cTrue. The scream might have been what the crime writers call\u201d\u2014he pauses for effect\u2014\u201ca red herring.\u201d I smile. \u201cStill, a heck of a coincidence.\u201d \u201cThey do occur in reality, even if they are a bad plot device.\u201d Cain rises and excuses himself as he notices a newspaper left on the next table. He returns with the Boston Globe and sits beside me holding the paper between us. The account of the body in the public library is plastered across the front page. We pore over it, shoulder to shoulder, sipping coffee while we read. We learn that the body was found in Chavannes Gallery, which was being prepared for an event the next day. That the woman\u2019s name was Caroline Palfrey. The name means little to an Australian like me, of course, but Cain mutters, \u201cBrahmin.\u201d \u201cAs in the cow?\u201d I ask, a little confused. \u201cAs in the social class.\u201d He explains that the Palfreys are from a long line of Brahmins, members of Boston\u2019s traditional upper echelons. \u201cThey\u2019re rich?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s more than wealth,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Brahmins were integral to the East Coast establishment. They\u2019re a culture unto themselves. Surely Australians have their equivalent\u2014old family names that are prestigious because they declare themselves to be so?\u201d I smile, remembering Margaret Winslow, from the board of directors of the Sinclair Fellowship, who was so proud of being a sixth-generation Australian. In the country of the oldest living civilisation in the world, some sixty thousand years of indigenous history, six generations had seemed a pallid boast. And yet she made it, waxing lyrical about the property near Wagga Wagga that her great-great-great-grandfather had claimed in the mid-nineteenth century, the country he\u2019d cleared and cultivated. Country that belonged to the Wiradjuri. \u201cProbably,\u201d I reply. \u201cBut I don\u2019t move in those circles.\u201d \u201cI believe that\u2019s the point of those circles.\u201d \u201cDoes it say what was going to take place in the Chavannes Gallery?\u201d I ask as I scour the article myself for the answer. \u201cNot really.\u201d He points to the relevant sentence. \u201cShe was found by a cleaner, so the gallery would probably have been otherwise empty.\u201d \u201cI wonder if Marigold or Whit knew her.\u201d \u201cSpeak of devils,\u201d Cain says as they walk into the Newsfeed. He waves. Marigold sees him, grabs Whit, and drags him towards us. Her eyes are bright and her cheeks flushed. She glances at the paper. \u201cSo you\u2019ve seen it?\u201d \u201cYes, did you know\u2014\u201d \u201cNo. But Whit did.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t really know her,\u201d Whit protests. \u201cShe worked on the Rag.\u201d \u201cThe Rag?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a local tabloid.\u201d Whit shrugs. \u201cArts coverage mostly, with an occasional feature on something or other. I wrote a piece for them when I was a freshman\u2026came across Caroline then.\u201d \u201cYou write?\u201d I ask, surprised that he hadn\u2019t mentioned that before. \u201cI tried my hand at a lot of stuff when I was an undergraduate\u2026and it was just an article about football. I wouldn\u2019t call it literature.\u201d Still, the connection, however tenuous, makes it all a little more real. I look at Whit and I imagine that he\u2019s not as blas\u00e9 as he appears. \u201cDid you hear anything about what happened?\u201d He shrugs. \u201cRumors about ex-boyfriends. Some guy who couldn\u2019t let go.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d Marigold asks. \u201cDo you know his name? Is he a student? Where\u2014\u201d \u201cSteady on, Sherlock.\u201d Whit stems the deluge of questions. \u201cWhat do you think I am?\u201d \u201cWell, I thought\u2014\u201d \u201cThat I might go interrogate people at the vigil, so you can rush in and make a citizen\u2019s arrest?\u201d I laugh. Marigold rolls her eyes. Whit and Marigold decide against coffee. Cain and I finish ours, and we all head into the library only to find that Bates Hall\u2014in fact the entire second floor\u2014is closed. A security guard stationed at the base of the stairs maintains the cordon. The Map Room Tea Lounge is full, occupied by those turned out of Bates Hall, as well as reporters and the odd policeman; and Cain and I have, in any case, already had coffee. \u201cDid they discover another body?\u201d Whit takes a step or two towards the stairs. The guard tells us in no uncertain terms to move on. \u201cLooks like today\u2019s a bust,\u201d I groan. \u201cBut we were going to compare notes on our books today,\u201d Marigold protests. I meet Cain\u2019s eye. Were we? \u201cYou and Whit aren\u2019t writing books,\u201d he reminds her. \u201cYou\u2019ve inspired us to start,\u201d she says, smiling. I can\u2019t help but return it. The look on Whit\u2019s face fails to appear particularly inspired. There\u2019s something all-American about Marigold\u2019s smile, wide and quick and optimistic. You can imagine the Stars and Stripes fluttering behind her when she smiles, almost smell the apple pie. Whit\u2019s is similar. Cain\u2019s smile is different. It\u2019s slower, a little wry, and reveals less of his teeth. But they all smile while they talk\u2014that\u2019s the difference, I think, that\u2019s what makes it American. Australians don\u2019t seem to be able to smile and talk at the same time\u2014unless we\u2019re lying, of course. And then the smile is involuntary, a tell of deceit. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Cain asks, regarding me curiously. I tell them. \u201cWow! That\u2019s a bit random!\u201d Marigold is clearly not sure whether she should be offended. \u201cSorry\u2014writer\u2019s mind.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Cain\u2019s head tilts as he studies me and, immediately, I smile. \u201cSo how do you tell when Americans are lying?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe you can\u2019t.\u201d The security guard is glaring at us now. Clearly, we\u2019re loitering and possibly he overheard the conversation. In unison we flash him a smile. \u201cWe could head across the square and find someplace to have a burger,\u201d Whit suggests. \u201cWe can teach Freddie how to smile properly, in case she ever needs to get a job at McDonald\u2019s.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a writer,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s a distinct possibility.\u201d The Boston Burger Company in Boylston Street is quiet at this time of the day. It\u2019s only opened its doors in the last few minutes, and the lunch influx has not yet begun. We claim a table and order onion rings and nachos. Marigold asks me immediately how Freud Girl is faring. \u201cHave you thought about a love interest for her? Someone incredibly sexy. She wouldn\u2019t settle for just any old Joe\u2026 He\u2019s got to have prospects and a stock portfolio.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d It seems incongruent that someone so extensively inked and pierced as Marigold would have such traditional, not to mention fiscal, requirements. She shrugs. \u201cThe heart wants what it wants.\u201d I glance at Whit and Cain. Neither is willing to comment. After a little prompting by Marigold, I tell them about the novel I\u2019ve started to write. I don\u2019t usually share my work at this stage, but as this story begins with a group of people united by a scream, it seems fair, even necessary. And I\u2019m excited. I want to talk about it, discuss the possibilities. Whit and Marigold are immediate with their input. Marigold bubbles enthusiastically; Whit echoes with the odd quip thrown in; and even as they comment on the story, they hand me their own dialogue. Cain is slower, more considered\u2014he asks about points of view, tense, and story arcs. And his questions help give form to the swirling mists I\u2019ve conjured. He\u2019s intrigued by my method, the fact that I don\u2019t plot, but there\u2019s nothing judgemental in the way he asks, and I try to explain my metaphorical bus without sounding like a lunatic. Cain shows us his plot, an intricate flowchart created on his laptop, and explains the themes and subplots which radiate from his central premise. There\u2019s something beautiful about the chart. It\u2019s like a spider\u2019s web spun to catch a story. I\u2019m fascinated by it, and a little regretful that my work does not begin with gossamer webs. Cain\u2019s book is the story of a homeless man called Isaac Harmon who takes up residence in and around the Boston Public Library. Threads of backstory, self-discovery, and social commentary radiate from the novel\u2019s very human centre. His plan defines links, the points at which one thread meets another and entwines or branches again. I ask him about the story\u2019s origins, where he found Isaac Harmon, around whom everything was spun. \u201cI ran away from home when I was fifteen. Ended up in Boston and lived rough for a couple of weeks.\u201d \u201cYou ran away? Why?\u201d I ask. \u201cUsual teenage melodrama,\u201d he replies. \u201cI only lasted two weeks. Would have been much less if I hadn\u2019t met Isaac. He kept me out of real trouble and made sure I didn\u2019t starve until I was ready to go home.\u201d \u201cYou parents must have been insane with worry.\u201d He laughs. \u201cActually, they thought I\u2019d gone on vacation with a friend, so not so much. They were mad but not worried. As far as grand gestures were concerned, it was less than successful. But I did meet Isaac.\u201d \u201cAre you still in touch?\u201d Marigold asks. A darkness flashes across Cain\u2019s eyes. For a while he keeps his own counsel, before he responds. \u201cHe\u2019d ring me every now and then. I\u2019d meet him, take him for a burger. We\u2019d talk. He was killed about five years ago.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I know instinctively that he isn\u2019t talking about an accidental death. \u201cHow was he killed?\u201d Whit speaks reflexively as if he\u2019s asking about where Cain bought his shoes. \u201cSomeone stabbed him.\u201d \u201cOh, shit!\u201d Whit blurts. \u201cHe was murdered?\u201d Marigold seems more intrigued than shocked. Cain nods. \u201cThe police appear to believe it was an argument over a doorway or something. I only know because Isaac still had a piece of paper with my number and address on it, in his pocket. They found it and thought that I might be a relative.\u201d Whit shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s tough, man.\u201d \u201cSo, this is Isaac\u2019s story?\u201d I ask, tentatively, because I\u2019m not sure he wants to talk about it. I know he\u2019s writing about it, but that\u2019s different. Words are put down in solitude; there is a strange privacy to those disclosures. Time to get used to the revelation before readers are necessarily taken into your confidence. \u201cIn a way, I suppose.\u201d He heaps refried beans and cheese onto a corn chip that\u2019s too small for the purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s part him, part me, part stuff I just made up.\u201d \u201cThe magic formula,\u201d I say. Cain smiles at me, and the fact that he\u2019s handsome is again very salient. \u201cDid they ever find him? The man who killed your friend?\u201d Marigold is still curious. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cHow sad.\u201d Marigold looks hard at him. \u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d Cain considers the question. \u201cI guess. But not as much as the fact that he died cold and alone and in pain.\u201d He folds his arms across his chest. \u201cIsaac could be\u2026fierce. Whoever killed him might have been scared, or sick, or angry. There are a lot of scared, sick, and angry people sleeping rough.\u201d I wonder what exactly he saw in the two weeks he was on the streets. I don\u2019t ask him. Those are stories that should be offered rather than elicited. \u201cThere are a lot of scared, sick, and angry people sleeping in beds every night,\u201d Whit observes. Cain glances at him. Whit flinches. \u201cSorry, man; I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, you\u2019re right.\u201d He taps a note into the laptop. \u201cIt\u2019s a good line. You don\u2019t mind if I use it, do you?\u201d I laugh. Cain points at me over the screen. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend you\u2019re not doing the same thing. At least I ask.\u201d Marigold places her elbows on the table and props her chin on her hands. \u201cSo what are we going to do about Caroline Palfrey?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean do?\u201d Whit demands. \u201cWe can\u2019t just pretend it didn\u2019t happen and carry on. Someone was killed mere feet from where we were sitting. It has to change things.\u201d Whit carefully pulls an onion ring from a stack smothered with honey barbeque sauce and cheese. \u201cIf anything is going to make us reveal our true identities as avenging superheroes, surely it\u2019s that.\u201d \u201cThere were a lot of people in Bates Hall that day, Marigold,\u201d Cain says more gently. \u201cIt just seems indecent to not do anything. We heard her die.\u201d There is an earnestness in Marigold\u2019s voice. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what we can possibly do,\u201d Cain admits. \u201cWhat if they never find out who killed Caroline?\u201d Marigold\u2019s voice trembles. \u201cWe heard her scream. A scream is supposed to bring help, and we heard her scream.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, It\u2019s reading well. I feel like I know them all just better enough to be intrigued by their individual stories. I think you\u2019ve struck the right balance there. They all seem much more than they present initially. Again, I really like the last line. It\u2019s haunting\u2014particularly if you\u2019ve ever heard anyone scream. Tiny terminology issue. Americans don\u2019t really use \u201csleeping rough.\u201d We\u2019d probably understand it from the context, but it is a little unusual in an American character\u2019s dialogue. It is quite a nice term, though, less defeated than homeless, and less permanent. With respect to your question as to whether the distance between Harvard and the Boston Public Library is walkable\u2014if you\u2019re a German hiker, yes. If you\u2019re anybody else, you\u2019d catch a cab, an Uber, or a bus. The bus would be a number 57 or 86. The train (subway) would be the Green Line to Park Street, which is the subway stop across the street from the BPL on Boylston and Dartmouth, transferring to the Red Line at Park Street for Harvard Square. That\u2019s probably too much detail, but I\u2019d rather give you too much than too little. Anyway, does this mean you\u2019re going to make Copley Square the center of operations for this novel? I do like that you\u2019ve taken them across to The Burger Company on Boylston, though there are any number of eateries from which you could choose. I\u2019ve attached a list of places which are not too expensive. You should know that there are two churches in the Square\u2014Trinity and the Old South Church. I imagine there could be vigils for Caroline at either or both of them. I\u2019ve attached a couple of photographs. Let me know if you\u2019d like me to take some pictures inside. Depending on the time of year in which you\u2019re setting the novel, your foursome could also easily meet at the Copley Square Fountain with packed lunches. There is also the Fairmont Hotel in the Plaza, but it would be very expensive as an ordinary lunch venue. I do wonder how you\u2019re going to move the story on from this point. They don\u2019t really have a reason to become involved in the investigation. When I read that Caroline Palfrey worked on a paper, I thought for a moment that Cain might have known her or have been interviewed by her, but you don\u2019t seem to be moving that way\u2026or are you? Sorry, I don\u2019t mean to be second-guessing where the narrative is going. Take it as a compliment that I already care. Is there any update on when you might be coming to the U.S.? Not that I mind being your man in Boston\u2014it\u2019s a pleasure, and I really am having fun\u2014but being seen with a famous author would do wonders for my reputation! Now my news: An old friend from my college days happens to play tennis with Alexandra Gainsborough, the agent. Diane\u2019s invited us both to dinner in the hope that face-to-face, in a social setting, I might be able to entice Miss Gainsborough to look at the opus. I must admit I\u2019m a little nervous. Perhaps the poor woman is sick to death of being ambushed by desperate writers while she\u2019s trying to eat. How does one do this sort of thing with any level of social grace and reserve, when what I really want to do is beg her to give my book a chance? Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t do that\u2026unless I have to. Anyway, keep your fingers crossed for me. With a cautious spring in my step, Leo \n Chapter Four The muse and I have been locked in my apartment for three days. Leo is the only other human I\u2019ve seen in that time, and even he was warned off by the distracted haze through which I regarded him. \u201cYou\u2019re writing?\u201d He looks me up and down. Clearly, I look the part. \u201cYes. Would you like to come in for a drink?\u201d \u201cAre you simply being polite?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I admit. He smiles. \u201cThen I reckon I\u2019ll take a rain check.\u201d I feel my face relax. \u201cThank you, Leo. I\u2019m sorry\u2014that\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve begged off\u2026\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t fret none, Freddie.\u201d He takes off his glasses and squints into the apartment behind me. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have even come to the door. Only hope you haven\u2019t let the muse out by doing so.\u201d \u201cI broke her legs\u2026she\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d He stops, a little startled. I grin. \u201cI kid, I kid. I\u2019ve bribed her with Tim Tams.\u201d Leo shakes his head. \u201cYou Aussies have a dark side.\u201d \u201cNonsense. We\u2019re friendly alcoholics who like to barbeque and swear.\u201d He\u2019s already walking away. \u201cI wish your muse the best of luck!\u201d That was two days ago. The story is still coming in waves, surging ideas crashing onto the page faster than I can type. I\u2019ve not yet found actual names for Handsome Man, Heroic Chin, and Freud Girl, but it doesn\u2019t seem to matter. Perhaps it\u2019s because I am not yet ready to diverge them from their inspiration, to stem that momentum of discovery, the excitement of new friendship that seems to form a story of itself. The narrative is strange\u2014unlike anything I\u2019ve written before. The library takes on a consciousness of its own, watchful, patient, dangerous. The scream becomes a motif, an echo of each character\u2019s silent cry for connection and friendship, for help. Freud Girl is the story\u2019s heart, which she wears on sleeves of ink. Forthright, vibrant, and a little romantic, she believes in justice and loyalty and moves through the world with a kind of child-like innocence. But there\u2019s some part of her that wants to warn people to stay back, to clothe her natural warmth in signals of street ferocity. For a while I wonder what it is that makes her wary of strangers: a troubled childhood, a lack of stability, even tragedy. Perhaps it\u2019s simply a matter of taste. I expect Marigold just likes tattoos and piercings, but Freud Girl will have to be more complex than that. Heroic Chin is laid back to almost Australian levels, his defiance passive, but effective. A young man trying to prove he is unworthy of his parents\u2019 ambitions. His infatuation with Freud Girl possibly has roots in that same impulse to thwart expectations. For some reason, although I am centering the story on Freud Girl, I write Handsome Man as a hero. I am self-aware enough to recognise a kind of glow to the way I describe him. I laugh at myself, but still, Handsome Man draws me in. I find myself thinking about the weeks Cain spent on the street, wondering if there was something more than a surge of adolescent temper behind his leaving home. Cain doesn\u2019t seem given to grand gestures for no reason, but I\u2019ve only known him a few days, or perhaps he\u2019s changed, grown up. I scroll down through all the pages I\u2019ve written in the last few days. The manuscript is a bit wild\u2014I wonder if the bus is going too fast, careening out of control. A fleeting sadness that there is no character to hold my place. I feel somehow left out, even though the decision, the omission, was mine. My phone rings, and I spend several flustered seconds trying to locate it beneath piles of books and plates which had once held toast. I barely manage to answer it before it goes to voicemail. It\u2019s Cain. \u201cDo you feel like taking a break?\u201d I hesitate. Not because I don\u2019t want to stop, but because I\u2019m not even dressed. \u201cRight now?\u201d \u201cOh, sorry, have I caught you in the middle of something? I didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d I come clean because I can\u2019t at this moment think of anything aside from the truth. \u201cI\u2019m in my pyjamas\u2026haven\u2019t even showered.\u201d He laughs. \u201cHow long do you need?\u201d \u201cAt least an hour\u2026 We\u2019re looking at a major overhaul.\u201d \u201cOkay, do what you can, and meet me in Copley Plaza at one o\u2019clock.\u201d I check the time. An hour and a half. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee the result.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll keep my expectations low,\u201d he replies. I can hear the smile in his voice, see it in my mind\u2019s eye. \u201cHow about I wait for you at the fountain?\u201d I\u2019m already walking to the bathroom. I must be more beset by cabin fever than I realized because I\u2019m excited about the idea of stepping out, of meeting Cain. Deep down I know this is about Cain, but one should maintain one\u2019s dignity even in conversations with oneself. Three days is enough to make anyone stir crazy, and I probably do need to talk to someone, make sure the work is not embarking in a direction that\u2019s too implausible. And I\u2019m running out of food anyway\u2014this will be a chance to pick up supplies. I shower and get dressed, finally draping a woollen scarf around my neck and pulling on gloves. For a moment, I languish in the childish fleeting pleasure of putting on new things for the first time. The scarf and gloves were both purchased last week as autumn set in. It\u2019s rarely cold enough for such accessories back home, and so they are yet a novelty. I wave bright yellow gloved hands into the mirror. They make me feel a bit more like I belong in Boston\u2014I guess there\u2019s nothing that says \u201cvisiting Australian\u201d more than wandering about shivering. Copley Square is only a brief walk from my building. I take my laptop with me. I don\u2019t like it out of reach at this stage, for reasons that have nothing to do with whether I intend or expect to write. When I\u2019m an old lady, one shoulder will probably be lower than the other after a lifetime of lugging laptops like they are some portable life-support system\u2014which perhaps they are. The fountain in Copley Square is styled on the Roman aqueduct: arches, channels spouting water into a pool. Despite that, it\u2019s not old, particularly in amongst the buildings of the historic square. Nor is it spectacular, but the area is pleasant, and the day is beautiful. Sharp and bright, and softened by the warm blaze of an American fall. Cain spots me as I approach and runs over. \u201cAm I late?\u201d I ask, worrying suddenly that I spent too long fussing over what I was wearing. \u201cNot at all. Did I interrupt your momentum?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cNo\u2026you saved me from myself. It\u2019s nice to walk outside, to be honest.\u201d He looks noticeably relieved. \u201cShall we go for a stroll before we find somewhere for lunch then? Or have you had enough of walking?\u201d I haven\u2019t. Though I did join a couple of guided tours of Boston when I first arrived, it\u2019s different walking those same streets with Cain. He\u2019s not telling old stories attached to landmarks but looking for new ones, places and details which might be spun into the web of Isaac Harmon\u2019s story. It\u2019s like a game\u2014what might have happened here\u2014and soon I\u2019m playing. We come to a doorway, the entrance to an antique store, and though he stops and stares at it, he says nothing. I prompt him. Perhaps there is something in the window which is connected to his hero\u2019s old life. He winces. \u201cThis is where I tried to sleep that first night after I got off the bus from Charlotte.\u201d \u201cOh\u2026I see\u2026\u201d The doorway is wide and sheltered, but it smells unsavoury, and even in the day, this part of the street is shaded and cold. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \u201cThe junkie who usually slept there came along and beat the hell out of me.\u201d \u201cOh, my God!\u201d \u201cIsaac happened to be sleeping over there.\u201d Cain points across the road to a gap between two buildings. \u201cHe came over, calmed the guy down, gave him a couple of cigarettes, and took me with him.\u201d \u201cYou must have been terrified.\u201d \u201cNot terrified enough. Isaac tried to talk me into going home, or at least to a shelter. When I wouldn\u2019t, he let me hang around with him.\u201d Cain glances at me. \u201cYou seem shocked.\u201d \u201cOnly that it took you two weeks to go home.\u201d I meet his eyes. They\u2019re dark, nearly black. \u201cThings must have been bad.\u201d \u201cMy stepfather was a\u2026\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get on.\u201d \u201cAnd when you went back?\u201d \u201cHe wasn\u2019t around for much after I got back.\u201d \u201cAnd your mother?\u201d \u201cMom got over him. She lives in Minnesota now.\u201d I look back at the doorway. \u201cAre you going to write this into your story?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I can\u2019t write me, but what Isaac did for me is important, I think. He wasn\u2019t a saint, Freddie. He didn\u2019t help everyone, and I saw him do things that were downright mean, but he chose to save my life. The choosing is interesting. I can\u2019t leave it out.\u201d \u201cSo don\u2019t. Just change who he chose\u2026a girl maybe\u2026or a dog.\u201d \u201cA dog?\u201d He groans. \u201cYou want me to cast a dog in the role of myself.\u201d \u201cMake it a nice dog\u2014one without fleas or rabies.\u201d Cain glances at his watch. \u201cThere\u2019s a really cool vegetarian place around the corner. Will that do for lunch?\u201d \u201cYes\u2026sure.\u201d I\u2019m surprised that he\u2019s noticed that I\u2019m vegetarian. We\u2019ve shared a couple of meals, but I don\u2019t remember announcing the fact, only not ordering meat. There\u2019s a small crowd on the corner watching a street performer, and Cain takes my hand so we don\u2019t lose each other as we weave through. The restaurant, a couple of doors down from the corner, is called Karma. It\u2019s clearly popular, packed, yet somehow we manage to get at table by the window. \u201cAre you sure this is okay?\u201d I ask as we peruse menus. \u201cI really don\u2019t mind eating in an ordinary restaurant\u2014there\u2019s always a vegetarian option.\u201d \u201cAnd miss out on all this\u2026tofu?\u201d He pulls a face. The grimace seems to summon a waiter, and we order lentil burgers and fruit smoothies. We fall into conversation again, about our work, Boston, and, inevitably, Caroline Palfrey. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that scream,\u201d Cain tells me. \u201cWe all heard it, and yet she wasn\u2019t found right away. I\u2019ve been wondering how that could happen.\u201d I nod. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a locked room mystery in reverse.\u201d He looks at me quizzically. \u201cSorry\u2014I forgot you\u2019re not a mystery writer.\u201d I try to explain. \u201cA locked room mystery is one in which the victim is found in a room locked from the inside. Where the mystery is really about how the murderer got in and out again.\u201d He frowns. \u201cSo when you say it\u2019s locked room in reverse\u2014\u201d \u201cI said a bit like,\u201d I qualify. \u201cBut yes, we heard Caroline scream\u2026as Marigold says, we heard her die. And yet her body wasn\u2019t there when the guards searched. And then, a few hours later, there she was. The mystery is about where her body was between the scream and when she was found.\u201d \u201cPerhaps the scream wasn\u2019t Caroline\u2019s.\u201d \u201cAh, yes, the coincidence theory.\u201d \u201cWhat else could it be?\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019d have to look at the security guards who checked the surrounding rooms.\u201d I\u2019m thinking as I speak. \u201cMaybe Caroline was there all along. Maybe someone had a reason for reporting that the Chavannes Gallery was clear.\u201d We are startled by a tapping at the window against which our table is positioned. We look up to see Marigold and Whit. After a few seconds of frantic signalling and gesticulating, they come in and join us. \u201cWere we supposed to meet for lunch?\u201d Marigold asks. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d \u201cNo\u2026we weren\u2019t.\u201d I feel vaguely guilty. \u201cCain and I just caught up to discuss book stuff.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d Marigold looks a little crestfallen, and I feel terrible. \u201cI was stuck.\u201d Cain volunteers. \u201cI needed to check some locations and thought Freddie might like to come\u2014being an out-of-towner and all. She\u2019s now seen some of the seediest parts of Boston.\u201d \u201cWell that\u2019s a relief!\u201d Whit intervenes. \u201cI thought for a moment I\u2019d forgotten to pass on a message.\u201d \u201cWhat are you two up to?\u201d Cain asks. \u201cI was heading to the library,\u201d Marigold says. \u201cI saw Whit from the other side of the road and crossed to say hello.\u201d Whit grins. \u201cI was going to the donut place down the block a ways, when I spotted you guys in the window\u2026and then Marigold came squealing across the street.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t squeal!\u201d Marigold shoves him. Cain smiles at me. \u201cWe\u2019ll call it a coincidence then.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, Dinner was lovely. Diane went all out\u2014served lobster, seated me beside Alex, and raised the opus because I still hadn\u2019t summoned the courage to mention it myself by dessert\u2014which was a positively decadent chocolate concoction which you would have loved! I had taken the time to devise an eloquent way to summarize the opus into a couple of apparently casual sentences\u2026the dreaded elevator pitch. I added a few thoughtful pauses and an \u201cummm\u201d to make it seem spontaneous. Diane, bless her, kept asking questions so the conversation didn\u2019t move on, and I was able to \u201creluctantly\u201d talk about my work. Anyway Alex gave me her card and asked me to send her the manuscript. So as you can imagine I am so far over the moon I can see Pluto! I remember you telling me that the first time someone says \u201cyes\u201d is unsurpassable. I can\u2019t verify that, but \u201cmaybe yes\u201d is pretty mind-blowing. I\u2019m blaming that for the fact I don\u2019t have any comments on your last chapter. I\u2019m just too happy to concentrate. I\u2019ll read it again tomorrow\u2014I\u2019m sure I will have calmed down a bit by then\u2014and get back to you if I have any comments or suggestions about the Boston bits. I\u2019m going to check the opus one more time for typos etc before I send it out. Keep your fingers crossed for me when you\u2019re not writing. In hope, Leo \n Chapter Five We end up in my apartment that evening, eating delivered pizza and just hanging. Whit pokes around in my kitchen and cobbles together a massive banana split sundae for dessert, which he serves in a salad bowl with four spoons. I\u2019m surprised by how comfortable I am with these people so recently strangers. Today I\u2019m telling them about my crazy family and old boyfriends, moments of mortification, and assorted personal horror stories I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever share. It might have something to do with the wine\u2014not that any of us drink a debilitating amount. Only enough to be a little compromised. And in our mutual, if marginal, inebriation there is a demonstration of trust, in each other, and the fledging friendship between us all. Marigold tells us of the twelve years she spent studying classical ballet and attempts to demonstrate that she can still stand en pointe. It turns out she can\u2019t\u2014not anymore, or at this moment anyway. She speaks of the dance that she loved, the discipline that she loathed. And through these stories, I glimpse a traditional conservative and highly aspirational upbringing. I see a young woman in the process of redefining herself. Marigold shows us her first tattoo, a ballerina in repose, stretched out across her back. Whit is the first to respond. \u201cFuck! Is she dead?\u201d I gag on my wine. Cain freezes, expecting an explosion. But Marigold laughs. \u201cShe was supposed to be resting, but perhaps she\u2019s dead. Perhaps it was an omen.\u201d \u201cIs that Mickey Mouse?\u201d I ask, peering at the image hidden partially by her shirt. \u201cYes,\u201d she says, removing her shirt entirely so that we can see the tattoos which cover every inch of skin below her collarbone. She places her hands on her hips and turns slowly so that we can see every inking. I am aware of her nakedness but I\u2019m too intrigued by her skin to be shocked. Cain takes a breath, while Whit pours himself another glass of wine. \u201cDonald\u2019s there too, above my hip.\u201d \u201cGod, I hope you mean the duck,\u201d Whit mutters. Her small breasts are covered with flowers. The tattoos are eclectic, and yet none stand out from the complex cohesive picture. We ask about individual designs, and Marigold explains the circumstances of their acquisition. Cain questions her about the needles and the level of pain involved with each tattoo. \u201cThe ones around the ribs hurt the most.\u201d She touches the area as she speaks. \u201cI screamed like I was being\u2014well, I screamed.\u201d \u201cWhere are you going to put the next one?\u201d Whit asks, walking around her in search of un-inked territory. \u201cI\u2019m pristine below the waist.\u201d Marigold pulls up the leg of her jeans to show us the untouched skin. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure I will get any more.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d I ask, because I\u2019m curious as to her reasons, not because I think she needs more body art. \u201cAn arbitrary boundary\u2026 It means I\u2019ll always have space for the perfect tattoo should I ever find it. It means I won\u2019t be finished\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be complete\u2026not yet.\u201d She puts her shirt back on. \u201cAren\u2019t you guys inked at all?\u201d She looks at me. \u201cIs it not a thing people do in Australia?\u201d \u201cOh, no\u2014they do. A lot of people do. And a lot of people don\u2019t. I don\u2019t.\u201d Whit flops onto my couch. \u201cThe police questioned me.\u201d For a moment we all just stare at him. Marigold speaks first\u2026or shouts. \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you say?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m saying now.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019d be strange if they didn\u2019t talk to you,\u201d Cain offers. \u201cThey\u2019re probably talking to everyone who knew Caroline Palfrey.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ll probably talk to the three of you now, too,\u201d Whit says apologetically. Marigold looks at him suspiciously. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cTo verify that I was in Bates Hall when she died.\u201d \u201cOh, my God! They asked you for an alibi!\u201d \u201cOnly where I was.\u201d \u201cAre you okay, Whit?\u201d I ask gently. He does look a little shaken. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m fine.\u201d He winces. \u201cI saw a picture of her body.\u201d \u201cThey showed you a picture of her corpse?\u201d \u201cNo\u2026I saw it on the whiteboard as I was going to the interview room.\u201d \u201cWas it really awful?\u201d Marigold asks. \u201cNot particularly. She must have been hit in the head\u2026there was blood in her hair\u2026but otherwise she looked sort of peaceful. Like she was sleeping.\u201d \u201cDid they say anything about why it took so long to find her?\u201d Marigold tops up his glass of wine. I\u2019m surprised when Whit answers. \u201cYeah, apparently the Gallery was being set up for some event the next day. She was under the buffet table\u2014hidden by table linens and rosettes and stuff. They only found her because one of the cleaners was fastidious enough to lift the tablecloth to vacuum.\u201d \u201cGood God! Are you on the case now?\u201d I ask, wondering how he\u2019s come to know so much. He snorts. \u201cNo, but my folks are. The Palfreys have been clients of Metters and Putnam for years.\u201d \u201cThey told you this?\u201d \u201cNot directly\u2014that would be unprofessional. And the parental units are nothing if not professional. But you overhear stuff when you drop by.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cI expect that me being questioned is a little awkward. If you didn\u2019t know them, you\u2019d worry about a conflict of interest.\u201d I\u2019m not sure how to respond, but Marigold, who is possibly a little drunker than the rest of us, embraces him. Whit looks startled. \u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d \u201cI just thought you needed a hug.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine, Marigold. The police questioned me\u2026they didn\u2019t torture me.\u201d Cain returns us to the subject to Caroline Palfrey. \u201cSo, whoever killed Caroline managed to hide her beneath a table without anyone seeing? And before the security guards got there?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the theory.\u201d \u201cPerhaps the murderer was disguised as someone from the catering company,\u201d I suggest. \u201cThe security guards wouldn\u2019t have raised an eyebrow, particularly as the body wasn\u2019t found until much later.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Cain replies. \u201cOr maybe they weren\u2019t disguised at all. Perhaps she was murdered by a caterer.\u201d \u201cAre you making fun of me?\u201d \u201cNot at all. Murderer isn\u2019t a job description, Freddie. It tends to be something you do on the side.\u201d He opens another bottle of wine. \u201cMaybe one of the caterers knew Caroline. Maybe he had reason to kill her.\u201d \u201cOr she,\u201d Marigold points out. \u201cThe murderer might be a woman.\u201d \u201cOr she,\u201d Cain concedes as he hands her a glass of wine. \u201cYou would have thought you\u2019d see blood spatter, or something of the sort.\u201d I still find it odd that Caroline\u2019s body was undetected. \u201cUnless she was under the buffet table when she was killed, you\u2019d expect the security guards to have seen something.\u201d \u201cShe could have been under the buffet table,\u201d Whit says. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cLooking for a dropped earring, or a bit of privacy.\u201d Whit shrugs. \u201cCould be she was trying to avoid someone. I once ran into the ladies\u2019 restroom trying to avoid an old girlfriend.\u201d \u201cWould have thought it\u2019d be more sensible to run into the men\u2019s room,\u201d Cain murmurs. \u201cOh, yeah!\u201d Whit exclaims. \u201cI\u2019ll do that next time.\u201d \u201cWhat are you two doing to your exes that you have to hide from them?\u201d Marigold pokes him. He smiles and raises his brows. \u201cYou\u2019re not asking a gentleman to kiss and tell, are you, Marigold?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not a gentleman,\u201d she says. It\u2019s well past midnight, and they are probably too drunk to go home safely. They\u2019re too drunk to want to go home, anyway. So I gather extra pillows and blankets from the linen closet in the hall and make up beds for Cain and Whit in the sitting room. They toss a coin for the couch. Cain loses and takes the floor. I bring him extra pillows from my own bed. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be all right?\u201d \u201cI lived on the streets, remember.\u201d Whit snorts. \u201cFor two weeks!\u201d He strips down to his underwear without the slightest hint of modesty or self-consciousness. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t mind us staying?\u201d Cain asks. \u201cYou probably want to get back to work.\u201d I glance at Whit, already stretched out on my couch. It\u2019s clear he\u2019s not going anywhere. \u201cIt\u2019s cool,\u201d I reply. \u201cYou\u2019re all material.\u201d Marigold is sharing my bed. It\u2019s big enough that it\u2019s not awkward. She makes us mugs of tea and closes the door so that we can chat without being overheard. \u201cDo you like him?\u201d she asks. \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cCain.\u201d \u201cWhat are we\u2014twelve?\u201d She giggles. \u201cWhit and I busted you.\u201d I sip my tea. Apparently we\u2019re having a slumber party. \u201cCain and I were talking about our books, Marigold. We figured you and Whit would have better things to do than listen to us blither about subplots and themes, or whether adverbs have been unjustly vilified and metaphors overused.\u201d Marigold considers what I\u2019ve said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have better things to do.\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t you both trying to get degrees\u2026or more degrees?\u201d Marigold wrinkles her nose. \u201cWell, yes, but that\u2019s more background noise than something to do.\u201d I laugh. \u201cWe all met only a few days ago\u2026 How can everything else be background noise?\u201d \u201cNot everything\u2026just classes.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter if we attend. Whit wants to fail, and I\u2019m something of a genius.\u201d She smiles as she says it, but I don\u2019t for a moment doubt it. Marigold wraps her arms around her legs and rests her chin on her knees. \u201cBut don\u2019t you think there\u2019s something special about the four of us? I feel like I recognise you all.\u201d It may be that I\u2019m more drunk than I think, because I know what she means. I leave my mug of tea on the bedside table and drop my head back onto the pillow. \u201cDid you and Whit know each other before that first day in the library?\u201d \u201cNo. I had seen him around, but we\u2019d never spoken to each other.\u201d She climbs under the covers. \u201cI wonder if any of us would ever have spoken to the others if we hadn\u2019t heard Caroline scream.\u201d I think about that. It seems inconceivable now that we might have gone our four different ways. Marigold\u2019s voice is low and melodic, and she is still talking when I drift off, something about Whit and sabotage. *** Dear Hannah, I think I may be in love with Marigold! She\u2019d probably drive me nuts in person, but on the page, she is luminescent. She steals scenes. Not that the others are slouches either\u2026but Marigold! I wonder if you should give the reader an idea of what Winifred looks like. She\u2019s given us descriptions of Handsome Man, Heroic Chin, and Freud Girl, but we have no real sense of what she looks like. And I want to know why Cain is more interested in Freddie than Marigold. Sure, they\u2019re both writers, but it\u2019s got to be more than that. Of course, it may not be what she looks like, but when you create a character as beguiling as Marigold, the reader will wonder why the guy is choosing her friend. Unless he\u2019s not choosing Freddie\u2026(cue dramatic music). I see on the news that Australia\u2019s dealing with wildfires again. They must be pretty severe if we\u2019re hearing about them here. We don\u2019t really hear much about Australia. This is probably a dumb question which will demonstrate my appalling lack of knowledge with respect to Australia\u2019s geography, but are you safe? I have images of you typing just one more paragraph as the flames lick at your door. It started to snow in Boston today\u2026not heavily, but enough to warn us all of what\u2019s to come. Big flakes, the kind that grace Christmas cards\u2014does anyone send Christmas cards anymore? I imagine it must be strange to write your gang in a Boston winter when you\u2019re living through a heat wave on the other side of the world. Anyway, I thought of a couple of things Freddie might be dealing with while you swelter. Heat waves in your hemisphere seem to be balanced by ice ages in ours. A place like Carrington Square is bound to have good heating, so it will be a matter of layering on and off every time she leaves or enters the building. If she\u2019s out early, she\u2019ll have to be careful of ice on the sidewalks\u2014they\u2019re great fun when you\u2019re a kid, less so when you break a hip. The scarf and gloves are fine, but most sensible people wear a hat of some sort\u2014remember though that we don\u2019t use the term beanie! Freddie doesn\u2019t have a car so she won\u2019t have any cause to shovel snow\u2026but perhaps Cain will. Or Leo. Because, let\u2019s face it, a character that charismatic deserves a bigger part. I haven\u2019t heard anything from Alexandra Gainsborough as yet, but it\u2019s probably still too early to expect or even hope for a response. Of course, the dream is that Alex will have been so taken by the manuscript that she reads it in one sitting, forgetting all other demands on her time, and that, on finally putting it down, she rings the genius author immediately to sign him to a contract before anyone else can. As I said, the dream. Anyway, I better sign off and return to trying not to think about Alex reading the opus. Yours in eternal and stubborn hope, Leo \n Chapter Six The gift basket is delivered to the reception in the chequerboard foyer. When I go down to collect it, Mrs. Weinbaum and her sister-in-law, Mrs. Jackson, who share an apartment on the ground floor, are discussing the basket which they apparently saw arrive. They are elegantly dressed in smart coats and jaunty hats. If we were in Sydney, I would assume that they were setting off for a day at the races, but here, they might just be going shopping. They don\u2019t notice me come downstairs. \u201cYoghurt? What kind of man sends yoghurt\u2026and eggs?\u201d Mrs. Weinbaum\u2019s pencilled eyebrows furrow as she tsks. \u201cPerhaps she\u2019s ill?\u201d Mrs. Jackson looks closely at the large basket sitting up on the reception desk, taking a careful inventory of its contents. \u201cThere\u2019s coffee, too. And cheese.\u201d \u201cGood morning,\u201d I say. They show not the slightest embarrassment at being caught examining my mail. \u201cThis came for you,\u201d Mrs. Jackson says. \u201cHow lovely.\u201d I extract the card from the bunch of flowers on the top. Because we forgot to pick up supplies yesterday and then Whit ate everything you had left. Get back to work. I don\u2019t want to be responsible for derailing your masterpiece\u2014Cain. I must have mentioned needing to restock when I met Cain, or perhaps he noticed I didn\u2019t have much by way of food in my kitchen. Whit had fried and devoured the few groceries I had\u2014eggs, potatoes, bread\u2014that morning before Cain marshalled them out so I could get back to writing. I smile. I\u2019ve been starving for at least three hours, afraid to ask the muse for time off to buy food. She\u2019s fickle and easily offended, likely to sulk if I don\u2019t give her my complete attention when she\u2019s gracing me with her presence. Perhaps that\u2019s why writers starve in garrets\u2014because the literary muse is a sadistic fascist. Mrs. Weinbaum and Mrs. Jackson titter with satisfaction, reading something into my smile. I chat with them for a while, assure them that I\u2019m not ill, despite the yoghurt. \u201cIt\u2019s good for stomach upsets,\u201d Mrs. Weinbaum tells me, nevertheless. The doorman carries the box up for me because it\u2019s huge and heavy, setting it on the kitchen table and leaving me to unpack its contents. Milk, cereal, eggs, coffee, tomatoes, apples, dried fruit, cheese, almonds, chocolate, three different kinds of cookies, bread, peanut butter, jam, yoghurt, and a posy of yellow hothouse roses. I make myself peanut butter and cheese on rye while I put everything away, savouring both the sandwich and the thoughtfulness of the gesture. I call Cain to thank him, but his phone has been turned off. He\u2019s probably working, too. I leave a voice message and then, the moment I hang up, wonder if it\u2019s too gushy. I flick through the other mail which was waiting with the box. A couple of letters to do with the Sinclair scholarship, and a Christmas card from my grandmother. One of those cheap cards you buy in packets of fifty at the supermarket, for less than what it costs to post them\u2014a red background with a silver snowflake. It\u2019s barely November, but Nana likes to have her cards be the first of the season. She treats each Yuletide like a race, a demonstration of the efficiency on which she prides herself. A fleeting twinge as I think of home. Nan would have a tree up and her house already decorated with plastic Santa Clauses and reindeer cutouts. There\u2019d be a giant inflatable snowman on her front lawn, misshapen after several seasons in the summer sun, its printed face faded, its seams puckered by the heat. Christmas in Australia is sometimes an exercise in irony. I return to the laptop with a cup of coffee and cookies. Freud Girl is centre stage, consumed by the scream and now strange memories of a murdered ballerina. Disjointed images she can\u2019t explain, but which torment her. I write her terror gently, allowing what is unsaid to carry the narrative, aware that overt emotion could well move the story into melodrama. I\u2019m not yet sure what her memories mean. Actually, I have no idea. The bus is still gathering speed and passengers. For a while I play with the image I see in her mind, explore why it might be there. Was Freud Girl a bystander, a surviving victim, or perhaps a killer? I don\u2019t really consider the last possibility seriously. At this stage I don\u2019t want to know, don\u2019t want to risk the knowledge seeping into the manuscript too early and undermining the mystery. And so I ride, almost indifferent to where I\u2019m going as I focus on rhythm and momentum, on who boards and where they choose to sit, whether they chat or read or simply stare out the window. The bus driver is a shadow, a practical necessity of transport, and for now I disregard him entirely. Fortified by Cain\u2019s box of supplies, I don\u2019t leave the apartment that day or the next. I am vaguely aware that Cain has not returned my call, but maybe it\u2019s absurd to expect a call to thank me for calling to thank him. Where would it end? Still, I wonder if I was too gushy with my voicemail\u2026Perhaps he\u2019s worried I\u2019m getting the wrong idea. God, how embarrassing! Why couldn\u2019t I have left something understated and witty\u2026? It\u2019s quite late when I take a video call on my laptop, expecting it to be someone from home. Cain\u2019s face opens on my screen, and I\u2019m startled enough to gasp and pull away. He smiles. \u201cFreddie?\u201d He sounds slightly unsure. I glance at the box in the lower screen which shows me what he can see. I have the hair of a mad woman, and I\u2019m wearing pyjamas that should have been cut up for rags long ago. \u201cSorry.\u201d I try to smooth the untamed curls with my hand. \u201cI thought you were my grandmother\u2026\u201d His right brow moves up, but he doesn\u2019t ask. \u201cI was just checking that you got the box I left.\u201d \u201cOh, yes.\u201d I thank him again and mention that I\u2019d left him a voice mail two days ago. \u201cI seem to have misplaced my phone,\u201d he replies grimacing. \u201cIn fact, I was hoping you might have come across it at your place.\u201d \u201cNo\u2026it can\u2019t be here. I would have heard it when I rang you.\u201d He groans. \u201cI might have to bite the bullet and buy another one.\u201d We talk for a while about where else he might have left his phone. He asks me how my manuscript is going, and I tell him that Marigold\u2019s ballerina has worked its way into my story. He sits back in his swivel chair as he talks to me. I can see the room behind him. The wall is covered with sticky notes in various colours and pictures. Lengths of string interconnect clusters of notes. Cain\u2019s spiderweb. He notices me squinting at the screen and looks over his shoulder. \u201cIs that your plot?\u201d I ask. \u201cMy God, it looks like you\u2019re sitting in a police incident room!\u201d He laughs and holds up his laptop so I can see that the strings run onto the ceiling, where more notes are tacked to the plasterboard. The lines cross and weave around the entire room. \u201cThis,\u201d he says, \u201cis what procrastination looks like.\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s very impressive.\u201d I\u2019m fascinated. It\u2019s like peeking inside his mind. \u201cDoes it help?\u201d \u201cSometimes.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cSometimes when I feel like I\u2019m free-falling, I write in here and the story catches me.\u201d \u201cA net beneath the tightrope.\u201d I understand free-falling. In a way, my work is all free-falling. But I have no net. \u201cI don\u2019t how you do what you do,\u201d he says, turning the camera back to his face. The admission is admiring, and I can\u2019t help but be pleased by the compliment of it. \u201cI suspect I\u2019d get tangled in a net,\u201d I reply. As much as Cain\u2019s web is beautiful, I think I\u2019d find it confining. I tell him about my current bus journey. He listens intently. \u201cThat\u2019s a brave way of writing, Freddie. I\u2019m not sure I have that kind of courage.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re writing stories, Cain,\u201d I say smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s not brain surgery\u2026Nobody\u2019s going to live or die because the bus goes nowhere.\u201d \u201cClearly you have not read Misery.\u201d We talk then about Stephen King and his books and the films made from them, what it would be like to be that iconic as a storyteller. He asks me if I\u2019d like to go see the latest King film later in the week. I say sure. For some reason neither of us mentions Whit or Marigold. When I eventually close the screen, I\u2019m excited\u2014embarrassed that I am, but excited, nonetheless. Though I won\u2019t be seeing anyone that night, I clean myself up\u2026tying back my hair and changing into less ragged pyjamas. I\u2019m making scrambled eggs for dinner when my phone rings. I assume Cain\u2019s found his phone. Thank goodness! I\u2019m not sure I could cope with the pressure of always being video-chat presentable. I answer. \u201cHello again\u2014\u201d The scream that cuts me off is not a man\u2019s. It\u2019s female, and terrified, and familiar. The scream is Caroline Palfrey\u2019s. *** Dear Hannah, Jeepers! That ending sure got my attention! But first, the fires near Sydney! The reports we\u2019re getting look terrifying. But I\u2019m glad to hear you at least, are not on the roof with a garden hose, protecting the homestead from a fire front. I saw images of some Aussies doing just that. It\u2019s been a while since I spent a summer in Australia, but I recall how tinder dry the country became in the heat. Even the air seemed combustible. It was threatening in a way that the summers here never are. But perhaps it doesn\u2019t seem that way to an Australian. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t disappointed that your research trip to the U.S. is being postponed, but considering that your country is on fire, I understand, of course. But there\u2019s absolutely no need to shelve this manuscript. I am happy to continue as we have been and to help however I can. I\u2019m learning more assisting you than I could at any creative writing course. And between us, we can make sure your story rings true, even if you can\u2019t be here. Now, about your manuscript. I do need to say that I still have no idea what Freddie looks like\u2026aside from disheveled hair. You know in the absence of a description, I can\u2019t help but give her your face. Don\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned! Cain\u2019s looking seriously dubious at the moment\u2014is that what you intended? No American snags in this chapter except perhaps that she didn\u2019t tip the doorman for carrying Cain\u2019s box to her apartment. You would tip for that. I\u2019ll send you a list of companies that deliver grocery gift baskets in Boston. That was a nice touch\u2026A basket of groceries is thoughtful but could also be read as overbearing or patronizing. I knew a guy who used to plot his work like Cain. He was a cop, so that might have had something to do with it. And he was a control freak\u2026planned everything, left nothing to chance. His name was Wil Saunders. You won\u2019t have heard of him\u2014he never finished his novel. So, this scream\u2026I don\u2019t want to preempt anything, or be pedantic, but I do wonder if it is possible to recognize a scream. Aside from the difference between genders, don\u2019t they pretty much sound the same? Why is Freddie so sure it\u2019s Caroline Palfrey? Anyway, I\u2019m going to go now so you can get back to work. I\u2019m anxious to read what happens next. I\u2019m not going to send you a box of groceries, but I do want you to write! With bated breath, Leo \n Chapter Seven The Boston PD does not offer to send an officer round. A policewoman takes my statement over the phone. She\u2019s brusque and bored and mildly contemptuous. I realise as I\u2019m talking to her that I\u2019m calling the police over a nuisance call, and I feel idiotic. I try to explain that I\u2019d been there at the BPL when Caroline Palfrey screamed, and this sounded exactly like that, but I succeed only in sounding more pathetic. In the end I apologise and hang up. But I\u2019m still shaking and now my phone feels dangerous, a door through which evil could enter my world. I turn it off and tell myself to calm down, to stop being absurd. It was probably some kid. I open the laptop to write, and I see that Cain is online. The impulse to speak to him nearly overwhelms my resolution to stop being an idiot. But the scream is fresh in my memory, and I can\u2019t shake the sense that it was Caroline. I turn my phone back on and ring Marigold. I\u2019m crying almost before I say hello. \u201cFreddie, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I sob out something about screams and phones. \u201cI\u2019m coming over,\u201d she says immediately. \u201cBe there in fifteen.\u201d \u201cNo\u2026you don\u2019t need to\u2026I\u2019m just being\u2014\u201d \u201cFifteen.\u201d She hangs up. I stare at the phone embarrassed, and ashamed that I am relieved. It was just a prank call\u2026but the scream sounded familiar and that unnerves me. I put on a pot of coffee and tidy up the apartment until the doorman buzzes me that Marigold has arrived. I ask him to send her up. She envelops me in a bear hug as soon as I open the door. \u201cGod, Freddie, are you okay?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine, Marigold. I think I must be drinking too much coffee\u2026 It\u2019s making me stupid and jumpy.\u201d Even so, I pour us each a mug and we sit at the small table in the kitchen to talk. I tell her about the call, the scream. \u201cI don\u2019t really know why, Marigold, but some part of me is sure it was Caroline\u2019s scream.\u201d \u201cWell, no wonder you\u2019re spooked, you poor thing. What happened was bad enough without the fucking spirits learning to use phones.\u201d I look at her blankly for a moment, her beautiful face full of concern and sympathy, and I giggle. And suddenly I\u2019m laughing helplessly, though it\u2019s not that funny. Marigold regards me quizzically and then she too laughs, and we disintegrate like children, unable to stop but not quite sure why we\u2019re laughing. Eventually I sober up. My face and sides hurt. \u201cThank you,\u201d I say. \u201cI needed that.\u201d \u201cI wish I\u2019d done it on purpose.\u201d She tops up our coffee. \u201cIt is probably some brat who heard the news report of the scream and is calling random numbers.\u201d I exhale. \u201cIt sounded the same, Marigold.\u201d \u201cAll screams sound pretty much the same.\u201d I shake my head. And I tell her about my sister. \u201cShe was two years younger than me. At home she was my best friend; at school we barely acknowledged each other. She died when she was eleven.\u201d \u201cOh, Freddie, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \u201cWe were on a school excursion to the Blue Mountains. The entire junior school\u2026so about three hundred kids. They separated us into year groups, and so we went up on different buses, and Gerry and I were hanging with our own friends. I really couldn\u2019t have told you exactly where she was until she fell.\u201d I swallow, wondering if I\u2019ve ever talked about this before. If I have I can\u2019t remember. \u201cThere was a loose safety rail on the lookout, and apparently Gerry was leaning out to take a photo when it gave way. The point is, Marigold, that I knew the scream was hers the moment I heard it. I recognised it. And recognised that it was a real scream\u2026not a joke or a prank.\u201d Marigold puts down her coffee and grabs my hand. \u201cGod, how awful, Freddie. How truly awful. But she was your sister. You\u2019d probably heard her scream, or shout, or squeal, a hundred times. You\u2019ve never met Caroline Palfrey.\u201d \u201cIt sounded exactly like the scream we heard in the library.\u201d \u201cAre you sure you remember it?\u201d \u201cHow could I forget it?\u201d She chews the nail of her pinkie finger for a second. \u201cGive me your phone,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy?\u201d I turn it on and hand it to her. \u201cBecause the little monster might not have turned their number to private. Or better still, they might have used their mother\u2019s phone, in which case it might be interesting to call back and tell the poor woman what her cursed spawn has been up to.\u201d She brings up the call register. \u201cHave you received any other calls this evening?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d She frowns. \u201cWhen did you get this call?\u201d \u201cAbout an hour ago.\u201d \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d She shows me the phone. \u201cThis is the last call you picked up\u2026about an hour ago.\u201d The caller is identified by name. CAIN. I pull back. \u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t talk to him tonight?\u201d \u201cI did.\u201d I take my phone from her and stare at the call record. \u201cHe called me online\u2014via my laptop. Because he\u2019d lost his phone. He wasn\u2019t sure whether he\u2019d left it here.\u201d Marigold blinks, processing. \u201cSo whoever has his phone called you?\u201d \u201cYes\u2026I guess.\u201d \u201cAnd screamed?\u201d I nod. \u201cWell, maybe that makes sense. If some brat picked up his phone, they may be nuisance-calling his contacts list\u2026or even whoever last called him.\u201d Marigold notes on my call register that I had tried to call Cain a few times. I explain that I had been trying to thank him for a box of groceries. The explanation becomes somewhat convoluted, and I realise I\u2019m blushing. \u201cUh huh.\u201d Marigold keeps her thoughts on that score to herself. \u201cWe could ring this number\u2014perhaps the little thief will pick up.\u201d \u201cHe\u2014or she\u2014hasn\u2019t before\u2026and presumably my number will be caller identified.\u201d \u201cYeah, but someone else may hear it ringing\u2026you never know.\u201d I shrug. \u201cSure\u2014we might as well give it a go.\u201d Marigold turns on the speaker and calls, placing the phone between us on the table. The call is picked up. I hold my breath. Silence. \u201cAll right, you thieving bastard\u2026We\u2019re onto you. The police have tracked the GPS on that phone you stole, so you\u2019d better come clean\u2026\u201d A crackle and then a voice. My voice. The message I\u2019d left for Cain thanking him for the groceries. I was right\u2014it was too effusive. And then the connection is cut. So Marigold and I stare at each other without speaking. \u201cWell, that was creepy,\u201d she says eventually. \u201cI was really hungry when the box was delivered,\u201d I explain. \u201cI was probably a bit overexcited by the sight of food.\u201d \u201cI meant that the little asshole played back the message, not what you said.\u201d \u201cOh\u2026yes. It is.\u201d I take a breath and stand to get my laptop. \u201cWe should let Cain know someone has his phone and all his contacts. Obviously, the phone wasn\u2019t password-protected.\u201d Marigold frowns. \u201cJesus, that was careless.\u201d We call Cain from my computer, sitting beside one another, so he can see us both in the camera\u2019s frame. Cain appears on screen without a shirt, and his hair dishevelled. He squints at the screen and checks his watch, and it\u2019s only then I realize it\u2019s past midnight. \u201cFreddie\u2026and Marigold!\u201d He yawns. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I tell him what\u2019s happened. He leans closer to the camera. \u201cThey used my phone?\u201d \u201cYou said you lost it\u2026Whoever it is must have found it.\u201d \u201cAre you all right?\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I glance at Marigold, hoping she won\u2019t give away how unnerved I\u2019d been. Marigold says nothing about the tears. \u201cThe thing is, Cain, your phone is not password-protected, so they\u2019ve got in. They have your contacts and\u2014\u201d \u201cHang on, my phone\u2019s protected by facial recognition.\u201d \u201cWith or without a password?\u201d Marigold asks. \u201cWithout\u2014there\u2019s no point having both\u2026\u201d \u201cFacial recognition can be fooled by a photo.\u201d Marigold shakes her head disapprovingly. \u201cIt\u2019s not really all that secure.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019re saying whoever has my phone also has a recent photograph of me? That narrows it down to my mother.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, Cain. Whoever has your phone is using it to stalk Freddie! For all we know, it could be the same person who killed Caroline.\u201d \u201cWhoa!\u201d I try to wind Marigold back a bit. \u201cI know I was scared, but stalking\u2014\u201d \u201cYou were scared?\u201d Cain looks more awake now. \u201cOf course, you were. God, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll come over\u2014give me a minute to get dressed.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d I say, abashed. \u201cI panicked for a bit, but I\u2019m fine now.\u201d \u201cYeah, and I\u2019m here,\u201d Marigold adds. \u201cWe just thought you should know what your phone\u2019s been up to.\u201d Cain rubs his eyes with the heels of his hands. \u201cHow about I take you both to breakfast tomorrow\u2026as an apology for my delinquent phone? We\u2019ll try to get to the bottom of this over pancakes.\u201d Marigold looks to me for approval. I shrug. \u201cSure.\u201d I make up the couch for Marigold, who has had the foresight to bring an overnight bag with her. \u201cThank you.\u201d I check she has enough blankets. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to drag you out here for something so stupid\u2026\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Freddie.\u201d She pounds a pillow into shape. \u201cFor the record, you\u2019re not overreacting. This is weird and a little creepy. And if we ever find the little monster who\u2019s got Cain\u2019s phone, we should beat the shit out of him.\u201d *** My dear Hannah, I\u2019ll be quick. We tend to say \u201ccell phone\u201d here. Americans like to be specific. And we call it \u201ccrank calling.\u201d \u201cNuisance calling\u201d is fairly self-explanatory, but it appears in Marigold\u2019s dialogue so probably best to use the American. I do wonder if someone should point out that they only have Cain\u2019s word that he\u2019s lost his phone\u2026or will that point readers to the killer too early? It\u2019s a fine line between giving the reader enough information and telegraphing the climax. I forgot to mention in my last letter\u2014I was on the subway, and I saw not one but three separate people reading your latest book. On the subway! Photos attached. Now get back to writing! I need that next chapter as soon as possible! Impatiently yours, Leo \n Chapter Eight Marigold insists we call Whit and tell him we are gathering for breakfast. \u201cHe might be hurt if he thought he wasn\u2019t invited,\u201d she says. I doubt it, but I still suspect that there is something between Marigold and Whit, whether or not they know it yet, and so I don\u2019t object. \u201cHe isn\u2019t answering,\u201d she says after a minute. I detect disappointment, and I am faintly smug that I picked up on this attraction that first day in the library. Freud Girl and Heroic Chin. \u201cYou can text him when Cain tells us where we\u2019re going.\u201d We meet Cain in the foyer. He\u2019s talking to Weinbaum and Jackson, or rather they\u2019re interrogating him. The wily old biddies have worked out he\u2019s behind the box of groceries and are cross-examining him on the yoghurt. I can almost hear him think \u201cthank God\u201d when we arrive. I introduce him and Marigold. They enquire if I\u2019m feeling better, if the yoghurt helped. It\u2019s easier to assure them that it did and make a break for it. Cain whispers an apology as we leave Carrington Square. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize yoghurt would be so contentious.\u201d I laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, actually. They didn\u2019t really talk to me before, but now they\u2019re so concerned for my health, it\u2019s like we\u2019re old friends. It makes me feel more like I belong at Carrington Square.\u201d Cain takes us to a creperie in Boylston Street. It\u2019s styled after a French caf\u00e9\u2014round tables with red-and-white-checked linen, candles in wine bottles, and a wallpaper mural of the Eiffel Tower. The clientele might also be part of the decor. Apparently this is the kind of place to which you can wear your beret without feeling ridiculous, regardless of how absurd you look. Indeed, I can\u2019t help feeling the three of us are underdressed. As we order, Marigold texts Whit. I hand my phone to Cain so he can look at the call register as we discuss what happened. \u201cYou have a couple of messages,\u201d he says. I hadn\u2019t realised. I haven\u2019t wanted to touch my phone since the previous evening. He frowns. \u201cThey\u2019re from my number.\u201d I take the phone from him. Two unopened messages. I very nearly hand the phone back and ask him to open them, but I pull myself together just in time, remember that I am not the terrified damsel type. I tap the first icon and a photograph opens. I stare for a moment to work out what I\u2019m seeing on the small screen. The picture is dark, and grainy, taken in low light. A door with central brass knocker, a gryphon I think, atop an orb. The second message is also a picture\u2014another door. But I recognise this one immediately. It\u2019s my door at Carrington Square. \u201cFreddie?\u201d Marigold asks as I drop the phone. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Cain picks up my phone and looks. \u201cDoors?\u201d He hands the phone to Marigold. \u201cThe second one\u2019s mine,\u201d I say, trying to keep calm. \u201cI don\u2019t recognise the first.\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d Marigold makes the image larger on the screen. \u201cThat doorknocker\u2026this is Whit\u2019s door\u2026at his parents\u2019 house.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve been to his parents\u2019 house?\u201d I ask, surprised. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Cain signals for the bill, though our food has not yet arrived. Marigold nods, standing. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I ask, still a little shaken. \u201cI think we should take this to the police now,\u201d Cain replies. \u201cMarigold, try Whit again.\u201d Marigold is already calling. Cain and I watch her as the phone rings. \u201cHello\u2026Whit? Thank Christ\u2014we\u2019ve been trying to get hold of you\u2014\u201d We see her eyes widen. \u201cOh, my God!\u201d she stutters. \u201cNo\u2026we\u2019ll be right over.\u201d She doesn\u2019t wait for us to ask. \u201cWhit\u2019s at Mass General.\u201d \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Marigold shakes her head as she stands. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026but\u2014\u201d She glances at my phone as if it is possessed. \u201cHe could be having an ingrown toenail removed,\u201d Cain says evenly. \u201cLet\u2019s find out before we panic.\u201d \u201cAnd the police?\u201d I ask. \u201cWe\u2019ll go check on Whit first.\u201d Cain\u2019s car is parked a little way down the street. An old black Jeep. The back seat is piled with boxes of books and files, which he shoves to one side to make room for Marigold. She is unusually quiet. \u201cHe was outside your door last night,\u201d she says finally as Cain drives through Back Bay to Mass General. \u201cAnd he\u2019s put Whit in the hospital.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know that yet,\u201d Cain cautions, though we do. I twist round to look at Marigold. \u201cWhit spoke to you, right? How did he sound?\u201d Marigold closes her eyes for a second. \u201cA bit out of it, actually.\u201d Cain glances at me. \u201cPainkillers, maybe.\u201d I flinch. We enquire at the reception desk and are directed to his room. There are at least a dozen people in the corridor outside it already. A number of students comforting each other, mostly female. Plainclothes policemen asking questions. I recognise the detective dealing with Caroline Palfrey\u2019s case from the news reports. Marigold takes my hand. I understand. This looks serious. A uniformed policeman is stationed outside the door, regulating who goes in and out. Someone asks who we are. Cain explains that we are friends of Whit Metters\u2019 and that we\u2019ve come to see him. Whit\u2019s mother introduces herself. Jean Metters. She\u2019s very thin, very beautiful, and looks no older than thirty-five. She speaks politely but efficiently and neither her upper lip nor her brow moves at all. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Whit is not up to visitors.\u201d \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Marigold blurts. Jean regards her coolly. \u201cThe police are still trying to ascertain that.\u201d A man places his hand on her shoulder. He\u2019s tall, grey hair and sharp blue eyes. \u201cLet them go in, Jean. You could use a break.\u201d He glances over his shoulder through the open door. \u201cWhit invited them, after all.\u201d \u201cWhit appears to have invited half the campus,\u201d Jean replies, looking irritably at the concerned students holding hands in the waiting room. \u201cWhich half-wit gave him back his phone?\u201d They argue back and forth for a few moments and then finally, the man, who I presume is Whit\u2019s father and may also have been the half-wit to whom she referred, convinces her to accompany him to the cafeteria. \u201cThere are no less than five of Boston\u2019s finest here, Jean. He\u2019ll be perfectly safe.\u201d And so we\u2019re allowed into Whit\u2019s room. He\u2019s hooked up to a saline drip and various monitors, and there are dark circles under his eyes, but otherwise he looks like himself. He smiles when he sees us. \u201cHello\u2026\u201d \u201cJesus at the wheel!\u201d Marigold can\u2019t contain herself any longer. \u201cWhat the hell happened!\u201d \u201cI got mugged, I think.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean you think?\u201d \u201cHe took my phone but he left my wallet\u2026but maybe someone came along\u2026\u201d \u201cWho\u2014\u201d \u201cNo idea\u2026 He stabbed me and I think I blacked out. I don\u2019t remember seeing his face.\u201d \u201cHe stabbed you? Are you all right? He might have killed you!\u201d Marigold is speaking, or shouting, for all of us. There are tears in her eyes when she grabs his hand. \u201cRelax, Marigold. I didn\u2019t really know anything about it until they brought me out of the anaesthetic a couple of hours ago. It was probably some junkie.\u201d \u201cIn Back Bay?\u201d Cain asks sceptically. \u201cWe have junkies,\u201d Whit protests. He looks at Cain, frowning. \u201cHow did you know I was in Back Bay? Did my mom\u2014?\u201d Cain tells him about the calls and shows him the images on my cell phone. Whit sits up, wincing and cursing as he does so. \u201cWhen was the image of my folks\u2019 front door sent?\u201d Cain checks the message. \u201cTwenty past ten last night.\u201d \u201cI headed out a little before half past. I didn\u2019t make it a block.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t see\u2014\u201d \u201cNothing at all.\u201d Whit frowns. \u201cNot that I remember anyway.\u201d \u201cWe should tell the police.\u201d I glance at the people in the corridor. \u201cWhit, why is the detective from Caroline Palfrey\u2019s case here?\u201d \u201cOn the off-chance there was some connection\u2026 Harvard students being targeted, that sort of thing.\u201d He meets Cain\u2019s eyes. \u201cAre you sure you want to tell her, man? It was your phone.\u201d \u201cThey might be able to use that fact to track him down.\u201d Whit nods, buzzes for a nurse, and asks her if she\u2019d send Detective Kelly in. Kelly is somewhere between thirty-five and fifty and tall and broad, particularly for a woman. She has a strong face, immaculately made-up, blond hair pulled back in a knot with not a strand out of place. When she smiles, it looks more like a reflex than an emotion. \u201cYou asked to see me, Whit. Have you remembered something?\u201d Whit introduces us. \u201cI met these guys the day Caroline was killed. We were all in the Reading Room when she screamed.\u201d Kelly nods at each of us in turn. A moment of awkward silence, and then Marigold blurts, \u201cWe think the murderer has Cain\u2019s phone.\u201d We explain. Kelly\u2019s face is impassive as she listens. I unlock my phone and hand it to her, so she can see the images for herself. \u201cDid you report the loss of your phone to your service provider, Mr. McLeod?\u201d Cain shakes his head. \u201cUntil last night I was still hoping to find it somewhere.\u201d \u201cI see.\u201d She turns to me. \u201cYou say the scream you heard in the first call sounded like Caroline Palfrey.\u201d I\u2019m unsure now. Logic and hindsight compromise my previous certainty. \u201cYes\u2026I mean, it was a scream. It made me think of the scream we\u2019d heard in the BPL but, I suppose, maybe it was just a scream.\u201d \u201cBut it unnerved you enough to call the police and then Miss Anastas?\u201d \u201cYes, it did.\u201d \u201cHow did you know it was not Mr. McLeod making the call?\u201d \u201cBecause he\u2019d told me he\u2019d lost his phone\u2026when we were speaking earlier online.\u201d \u201cJust before you received a call from his phone?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d I glance nervously at Cain, unsure where her questions are going. She turns to Marigold now. \u201cHow did you recognise the image of Mr. Metters\u2019 door? Had you visited his home?\u201d Marigold blushes. Whit regards her curiously. \u201cNo\u2026not really,\u201d she says. \u201cI dropped by once but I didn\u2019t knock.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWhy did I drop by? Or why didn\u2019t I knock?\u201d \u201cBoth.\u201d I can see Marigold twisting inside. I want to help her, but I don\u2019t know how. \u201cI just changed my mind. I was going to see if Whit was\u2026I can\u2019t remember exactly. Anyway, I changed my mind\u2026but that\u2019s when I noticed the doorknocker. And so I recognised it in the photo\u2026\u201d Even Marigold\u2019s ears are pink now. I glance at Kelly, wondering if she finds pleasure in humiliating Marigold. Whit intervenes. \u201cI keep telling Mom that that fucking knocker makes the place look like Dracula\u2019s castle. I would have run for the hills, too.\u201d Marigold is still unable look at him, but I want to hug Whit for that. Of course, I can\u2019t, because Kelly is watching us all. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to take statements from each of you,\u201d Kelly says carefully, hawkish still. \u201cAnd we will have to take your phone, Miss Kincaid.\u201d I nod. \u201cOf course.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll have one of my officers take your statements and details.\u201d Whit crosses his eyes as the detective walks out of the room. \u201cHow are you really, Whit?\u201d I break the silence in Detective Kelly\u2019s wake. \u201cA bit sore and tired,\u201d he admits, \u201cbut not bad, all things considered. They\u2019re going to let me go home in a couple of days.\u201d He shifts in the bed, gritting his teeth as he moves. \u201cThe worst part is that Mom\u2019s using the incident to get me all sorts of special consideration with my classes, which is going to make it all the harder for me to fail the term.\u201d Cain grins. \u201cYou might have to graduate.\u201d \u201cOver my dead body.\u201d Whit wrinkles his nose in the uneasy silence which follows. \u201cBad taste?\u201d \u201cIs there anything we can bring you?\u201d I ask. Marigold doesn\u2019t seem able to say anything. He looks at Marigold. \u201cDonuts. Marigold knows the ones I like.\u201d \u201cFrom the place near Copley Square?\u201d Marigold finally shakes off her embarrassment. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll grab a box.\u201d \u201cDo you think this could really be connected to Caroline Palfrey\u2019s murder?\u201d Cain asks suddenly. \u201cSurely it has to be.\u201d I think of the scream. Whit shrugs. \u201cThere are probably a dozen little brats ringing random numbers and screaming after the news reports of what happened at the BPL.\u201d \u201cYes, but these brats stabbed you.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten,\u201d he promises ruefully. \u201cBut I still don\u2019t know that the son of a bitch who knifed me had anything to do with Caroline. Rising crime rates and all that\u2026\u201d \u201cMaybe there is someone targeting students,\u201d Cain suggests tentatively. \u201cSomeone who\u2019s got your phone,\u201d Whit adds sharply. Cain\u2019s right brow shoots up. Whit groans. \u201cSorry\u2026that was the morphine talking.\u201d \u201cWe should go.\u201d I reach over and touch Whit\u2019s arm. \u201cYou need to rest, and even if you didn\u2019t, you have other friends who\u2019ll want to see you. We need to buy donuts.\u201d A shadow rises in his eyes. \u201cWhat about your statements?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll give them on the way out.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll come back, won\u2019t you?\u201d He seems anxious now. \u201cWould you rather we stayed?\u201d Marigold asks. Whit smiles weakly. \u201cNah\u2026I\u2019m not dying and I\u2019m protected by the Boston PD\u2026not to mention my mom. But you will come back tomorrow?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \u201cAnd you won\u2019t forget the donuts?\u201d Cain shakes his hand. Despite the circumstances, Whit\u2019s grip seems strong, his handshake square. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick them up in the morning, so they\u2019re fresh.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, While your summer lingers, so too does the glacial period which is passing itself off as winter here. I know you are imagining picture postcards of children playing in the snow, but really, after the first day snow is just work. It\u2019s shovelling and scraping, walking carefully, the tedium of layering on and off each time you go in or out a building. It takes hours out of everyone\u2019s day. And while fresh snowfall can be pretty, the slushy muddy mush left after a day of two is anything but! I really miss the color green\u2014it\u2019s something you don\u2019t experience in Australia, I suppose. The complete absence of green. I will concede, however, that our climate is conducive to keeping a writer on task\u2026 It\u2019s easier to stay at one\u2019s desk than put on four layers of clothing and shovel the driveway so you can leave the house. I took your advice and started something new. Inspired by your descriptions of Cain McLeod\u2019s method, I created my own incident room. I\u2019ve got to admit it was fun. I\u2019m not sure it will actually lead to the production of a novel, but there is a certain satisfaction in being able to see your ideas in three dimensions. I may have gone a bit overboard with the string\u2026 I ended up running it between every single character and every single plot point, so the result looked a little like what one would imagine a nuclear fission reaction. Everything\u2019s connected after all\u2026but I\u2019ve come to the conclusion it does not need to be connected by string. I am now being restrained and sparing with the red twine. There was a murder on Mass Avenue last night. Barely got a mention in the papers here so I\u2019d be surprised if was reported in yours. I happened to be coming back from the library and passed it. It occurred to me that seeing a crime scene would be useful to you, so you could describe the details, cordons, police tape, what the coroner\u2019s van looks like\u2014that sort of thing. Anyway, I took some quiet photos which I\u2019ve attached. The body had been removed by then, so don\u2019t worry that you\u2019re going to open a picture of the deceased\u2026though I suppose that too would have been useful. You mystery writers practice a dark and brutal art, but it\u2019s strangely seductive. It\u2019s also occurred to me that Cain needs to have an accomplice\u2014I know, I know, you haven\u2019t decided it was him yet, but he\u2019s my favorite for the role of serial killer. Unfortunately, he was sitting across from Freddie when Caroline Palfrey screamed, so you will need to explain that. It might be time we learned a little more about him aside from the fact that he\u2019s handsome and spent a couple of weeks pouting on the streets as a troubled adolescent. Please forgive me if I\u2019m overstepping with this\u2026 It\u2019s your book, of course. Please read this as the enthusiasm of a thoroughly engaged fan. On less important matters, I received a letter from Alexandra, who says that while she enjoyed reading the opus, she regrets that she cannot offer me representation. I\u2019m not sure she actually regrets it, but that\u2019s what she wrote. The reality is, I suppose, that I am a straight white man with no diversity or disadvantage to offer as a salve for the fashionable collective guilt that rules publishing. I understand that popular correctness demands that men like me be denied to compensate for all the years in which we were given too much. I just wish I\u2019d had a chance to enjoy a little of that privilege before it became a liability. Anyway, she said no. So there we are. Yours, Leo \n Chapter Nine Detective Kelly asks us to come into the station to give our statements. We each sit with officers who type our accounts into laptops and then print them for signatures. They separate us for the purpose. For me at least, the interview is emotionless, a simple gathering of facts\u2014dates, times, locations. I\u2019m simply punching in information. I get the feeling that I have become part of a process, absorbed into the machinery of the investigation. It\u2019s afternoon by the time we are able to leave. Cain is the last to be released from the interrogation room. He smiles fleetingly at Marigold and me and shrugs. \u201cShall we get out of here?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d None of us speaks until we\u2019re back in Cain\u2019s old Jeep. In fact, even then, we sit there a while in silence. Marigold\u2019s voice trembles at first. \u201cWhat\u2026\u201d She takes a breath. \u201cWhat now?\u201d Cain turns to look at her. \u201cI\u2019m starving. We didn\u2019t actually have breakfast, did we?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re hungry?\u201d Marigold doesn\u2019t seem able to comprehend how he could be so in the circumstances. Cain nods. \u201cI could make us something at home,\u201d I suggest. Cain glances at his watch. \u201cUnless you have somewhere you need to be?\u201d \u201cNo. It\u2019s not that. Just thought that we should probably get new phones while the stores are still open.\u201d \u201cOh, yes. Of course.\u201d I remember that my phone has been retained by the police and Cain\u2019s is probably in the hands of the killer. This doesn\u2019t feel real. Not entirely. And so we go to Walmart to purchase cell phones. He chooses a reasonably able smartphone for himself. I go for a more basic model. It only needs to serve until the police return my cell, which I presume they will\u2026hope they will. And though having to memorise a new number is irritating, it does close the door through which this person\u2014thief or killer or jerk\u2014crept into my life. It\u2019s starting to get dark and cold when we return to Carrington Square. Cain pauses outside my door, stepping back and holding up his phone. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Marigold demands. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out where exactly the clown who has my phone stood when he took that photo\u2026how close he got.\u201d \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d I ask. \u201cWe know he had to have been somewhere within a few feet. Does it make any difference where exactly he stood?\u201d \u201cProbably not.\u201d \u201cHe might have been zooming in, anyway,\u201d Marigold points out. Cain concedes. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Clearly, I\u2019m not a detective.\u201d We go in, and I feel myself relax a little when Cain closes the door behind us. Marigold grabs crackers and cheese from the kitchen which she arranges on a plate with sliced apple to tide us over until I prepare dinner. Cain helps himself. \u201cI like this cheese.\u201d \u201cYou should,\u201d I reply, smiling. \u201cYou bought it.\u201d He looks at the chunk he\u2019s about to put into his mouth. \u201cOh, yes, I forgot. I\u2019ve got excellent taste.\u201d I browse the pantry for beans, onions, and tomatoes and begin on a vegetarian spaghetti Bolognese, while apologising for the fact that it will be vegetarian and that my culinary skills are, in any case, fairly rudimentary. Marigold helps Cain set up his new cell phone with both facial recognition and password. There is a hint of disapproval in her voice, which I assume is directed at his failure to install a password on his previous phone. I hand Cain a bottle of wine and a corkscrew. He opens it and pours me a glass which I stir into the sauce, thinking fleetingly of my dad, who added wine to everything but cereal. For a while they watch me cook, and we talk about food. Clearly, we are all hungry. One of the benefits of vegetarian meals is that they rarely take long to prepare and, motivated by the fact that this will be the first meal of the day we actually eat, I\u2019m ready to serve large bowls of pasta and sauce very quickly. We eat, unsure how to begin talking about what has happened. Marigold takes the first step. \u201cWhat do you think he wants? This guy who stabbed Whit.\u201d Cain swallows and wipes his mouth with a napkin before he replies. \u201cYou think he wants something?\u201d \u201cHe must. Why else would he do this?\u201d \u201cPerhaps he\u2019s crazy.\u201d \u201cEven if he\u2019s crazy, he wants something.\u201d Marigold waves her fork as she speaks. \u201cRevenge, sexual gratification, the approval of the voices in his head\u2026\u201d \u201cSexual gratification?\u201d I ask. \u201cCaroline wasn\u2019t\u2026 And Whit\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what position they were in when Caroline sustained the injury to her head. He may have been lying on top of her, pounding her head against a hard surface in some kind of thrusting movement. And sometimes penetration with a blade is a surrogate of sorts for sexual satisfaction. There are a number of conditions ranging from piquerism to full-blown sadism and lust murder.\u201d I am reminded that Marigold is studying psychology. I try not to look squeamish and nod. \u201cBut Whit\u2014\u201d Cain begins frowning. \u201cSo the killer\u2019s not gender specific.\u201d Marigold preempts Cain\u2019s objection. \u201cCaroline and Whit were both white, the same age, from the same background. They both wrote for the Rag\u2026 There are plenty of links aside from gender.\u201d Cain seems sceptical. \u201cIt isn\u2019t necessarily sexual satisfaction,\u201d Marigold says patiently. \u201cBut it is possible. It could just as easily be any number of reasons, but there will be a reason. He will be doing this because he wants something.\u201d Cain reframes his original question. \u201cDoes it matter what he wants?\u201d \u201cKnowing what he wants might help us work out who he is,\u201d Marigold replies. \u201cGod, how did we wake up in the middle of an episode of Criminal Minds?\u201d Marigold stops. Her eyes well suddenly. \u201cI only meant\u2014\u201d Cain realises that he\u2019s hurt her feelings. \u201cGeez, Marigold, I\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m tired, that\u2019s all. You\u2019re right. Working out what this lunatic wants could be the key to stopping him, but maybe we\u2026\u201d Marigold is crying properly now. Cain looks at me helplessly. I get up and grab Marigold a box of tissues while Cain continues to apologise. \u201cCain, there\u2019s chocolate in the top cupboard,\u201d I say as I put my arm around Marigold. \u201cWould you mind grabbing it for me? I think we might need it.\u201d He agrees quickly, a little desperately. I\u2019m pretty sure that Marigold\u2019s tears have been building all day and probably have more to do with Whit and the questioning than anything Cain said. The poor bloke was just the trigger. \u201cWhit will be okay,\u201d I say quietly as I hug her. \u201cOh, God, what must he think of me?\u201d she gulps. \u201cCain knows it\u2019s been a tough day.\u201d \u201cI mean Whit.\u201d She wipes her nose and tries to steady her voice. \u201cAll that stuff about knowing what his door looks like\u2014he must think I\u2019m some kind of weirdo\u2026\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be daft. You called by and changed your mind about knocking at the last minute. We\u2019ve all done it.\u201d \u201cFive times?\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I try not to sound too startled. \u201cYou went five times?\u201d She nods. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell the police that?\u201d I don\u2019t want to advise Marigold to keep things from the authorities, but this would look odd. \u201cThey knew. Whit\u2019s house has CCTV at the front door. Oh, God, I felt so stupid.\u201d She stares at her empty plate. \u201cThey\u2019ve probably told Whit\u2026and his folks. They\u2019ll think I\u2019m\u2026\u201d \u201cThey might just think you\u2019re shy.\u201d I\u2019m trying to comfort Marigold, ease her panic. I don\u2019t really believe that people whose son has been stabbed a few yards from their doorstep would think anything of the sort. Cain fills my kettle and places it on the stove to heat. He can hear what we\u2019re saying, but clearly he\u2019s trying to give us a little time\u2014or he\u2019s a coward. But tea isn\u2019t a bad idea. \u201cDid you find the chocolate?\u201d I ask him, unsure what to tell Marigold. \u201cYes. There are two bars. Do you want them both?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d I signal for him to toss them over, so that we don\u2019t starve while he\u2019s making tea or doing whatever he\u2019s doing to avoid coming back to the table. I pull back the wrapping. \u201cThis,\u201d I announce, \u201cis Australian chocolate. Unlike American chocolate, it\u2019s edible.\u201d \u201cHey!\u201d Marigold smiles tentatively. \u201cThat\u2019s offensive.\u201d \u201cBut sadly true.\u201d I push the block of Cadbury Dairy Milk towards her. Marigold breaks off a square and pops it into her mouth, tilting her head as she savours it. I notice the slight ecstatic roll of her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I guess.\u201d She snaps off another large portion and takes a bite. I laugh and reach for the remainder of the block. Marigold reaches it first and clutches it to her heart. Cain returns to the table with mugs of tea. He is wary. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Marigold groans. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to lose it.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be a jerk, Marigold.\u201d Cain sits down and takes the chocolate she offers him. Marigold studies him. \u201cWhen your mentor, Isaac, was murdered, didn\u2019t you want to find out who killed him?\u201d I am surprised by the directness of her question, aware that the subject may be a sensitive. Cain laughs. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call Isaac my mentor.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to find out?\u201d Marigold persists. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d Cain chooses his words carefully. \u201cBut the police couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d \u201cSo that was it?\u201d I interrupt but gently. \u201cMarigold, if the police couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d \u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Cain says. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let it go. Isaac had no one else\u2014as far as I know, anyway. I should have done something.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think we can do, Marigold?\u201d I ask. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But we were there when Caroline screamed, and Whit is our friend, and the murderer has Cain\u2019s phone\u2026 We\u2019re in the middle of this, whether we like it or not.\u201d I exhale. She has a point. \u201cWhen was the last time you remember having your phone?\u201d I ask Cain. \u201cPerhaps it would be useful to narrow down where he might have gotten hold of it.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI haven\u2019t really got a clue. I thought it was in my pocket, until I tried to call to see if you liked yoghurt.\u201d I meet his eyes and smile. \u201cSo you ordered the basket of groceries for Freddie\u2026?\u201d Marigold begins. \u201cOn the computer\u2014online.\u201d Marigold frowns. \u201cDid you have the cell phone when we were here?\u201d \u201cYes, I checked for it when I put my jacket back on. I remember thinking I would have to charge it.\u201d \u201cWhere did you go from here?\u201d \u201cHome.\u201d \u201cWhere you realised it was missing.\u201d \u201cI guess so\u2026yes.\u201d \u201cHow did you get home, Cain? Did you drive?\u201d \u201cNo. I caught a bus.\u201d \u201cWas it crowded?\u201d Cain looks at her quizzically. \u201cThe bus? Yes, I suppose it was.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s easier for someone to pick your pocket if it\u2019s crowded,\u201d Marigold explains. \u201cDid you notice anyone in particular standing next to you?\u201d Cain shakes his head slowly. \u201cI was reading,\u201d he admits. \u201cOh\u2026what were you reading?\u201d I ask. He fishes a battered copy of The Great Gatsby out of his inside pocket and hands it to me. \u201cThe Great Gatsby?\u201d \u201cI reread it every couple of years,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cI didn\u2019t discover it yesterday.\u201d \u201cEvery two years?\u201d I rarely reread books. There are too many wonderful books without retreading old ground. \u201cJust Gatsby,\u201d he says. \u201cIt reminds me that flawed people can create perfect works of literature.\u201d \u201cAnd why do you need to be reminded of that?\u201d \u201cIf you were reading\u201d\u2014Marigold is impatient\u2014\u201cthen it\u2019s conceivable that your pocket was picked without you noticing.\u201d \u201cYes, it\u2019s definitely conceivable.\u201d \u201cWhich means the murderer followed you from here.\u201d \u201cHang on, Marigold.\u201d Cain pulls back. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit of a leap, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Marigold shakes her head. \u201cWe know the person who has your phone took photos of Whit\u2019s door and Freddie\u2019s; that he rang Freddie and either screamed or played her a recording of a scream.\u201d \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t mean he killed anybody.\u201d \u201cHe stabbed Whit.\u201d \u201cSomeone stabbed Whit. We don\u2019t know that it was the guy with my phone.\u201d \u201cBut he must have known who stabbed Whit, or was going to stab Whit, at least.\u201d \u201cMaybe he did,\u201d Cain says slowly. \u201cMaybe he was trying to warn you, Freddie.\u201d I look up sharply. \u201cWarn me?\u201d \u201cThat there was danger outside your door, I suppose\u2026and Whit\u2019s. Maybe that\u2019s what the pictures and the recorded scream were about.\u201d \u201cSo we\u2019re looking for someone who doesn\u2019t know how to text. That rules out everyone under sixty I guess.\u201d Cain winces. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that whoever it is might not be trying to scare or threaten you. They might think they\u2019re helping.\u201d \u201cOr he could be a sick son of a bitch who gets off on torturing people,\u201d Marigold counters. Cain rubs his brow. \u201cThat too.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, Finally! I was beginning to fear you\u2019d thrown in the towel and returned to that historical series you were writing. I expect the events of this summer have made it difficult to focus on writing. The coverage of the Australian bushfires here has been horrifying\u2014I\u2019ve been watching in dismay the reports of the landscape lost. I have been hoping to hear from you on that count if nothing else, to know you\u2019re safe. I do worry you might offend your U.S. readership by slandering our chocolate. We do know that our chocolate is inferior, but there\u2019s a kind of national agreement to pretend otherwise. Without it we might have had to invade you. I\u2019m intrigued as to where you\u2019re going with the phone messages. Logic says that Cain is right\u2026they are more likely to be a warning sent by a cryptic good Samaritan. Because why would a murderer show his hand like that? Perhaps because he or she knows that Freddie will talk to Cain about it. Are they trying to warn her without revealing themselves to the murderer? I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve heard from your agent with respect to my manuscript. I know these things take time, but I wonder if she might have mentioned anything to you. I know I must have sounded quite sour about Alexandra\u2019s rejection in my last email. And to be honest, I was. Disappointment is the most caustic emotion. But I have recovered and am more determined than ever to see this dream through, to find my way into print somehow. I shall be looking for your reply, Leo \n Chapter Ten Whit has sent us to Around the Hole, a buzzing, trendy bakery. Slick and modern, with shiny surfaces and small tables which say Stop, but don\u2019t linger too long. It serves coffee, but it\u2019s clear that its patrons come for the donuts, which they carry out in white cardboard boxes tied with twine. Glass cases display raised donuts and cake donuts\u2014which are apparently different\u2014as well as sourdough, vegan, and gluten-free varieties, all in bizarre flavour combinations, both savoury and sweet. Marigold takes over ordering by the dozen in flavours like lavender and truffle, cream cheese and fried onion, shitake mushroom and clover. \u201cThe poor guy\u2019s in the hospital,\u201d Cain mutters as Marigold requests a burnt caramel with lemongrass ganache. \u201cHasn\u2019t he suffered enough?\u201d I laugh. Marigold is less amused. \u201cSo what would you recommend?\u201d Cain turns to me. \u201cChocolate looks good,\u201d I offer. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with jelly,\u201d Cain adds, smiling. The contempt of the young man behind the counter is undisguised. Apparently, this is not the kind of place in which one asks for a jelly donut. Marigold apologises for us, adds a quinoa and liquorice donut and, in a dubious act of compromise, a dark chocolate and jalape\u00f1o jelly confection. We end up leaving with three dozen donuts. Marigold insists upon it and pays for them, but even she realises it\u2019s excessive. \u201cHe might need to share,\u201d she says in an attempt at justification. \u201cHe\u2019s surrounded by cops, I guess.\u201d Cain pulls out to drive to the hospital. I smile. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you should be risking offending the police with tired jokes.\u201d \u201cTired?\u201d Cain frowns. \u201cI think you mean classic.\u201d \u201cNo\u2014I mean tired.\u201d \u201cWhy should Cain be worried about the police?\u201d Marigold leans between us from the back seat. \u201cIt was only a joke,\u201d I reply hastily. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, seriously,\u201d Marigold says. \u201cDo you think the police suspect Cain because of the phone?\u201d \u201cUh\u2026maybe\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d I feel the colour rising to my face. \u201cI was only kidding around.\u201d \u201cThe police wouldn\u2019t be doing their jobs if they weren\u2019t looking at me,\u201d Cain says calmly. \u201cThey only have my word for it that I lost my phone and\u2026\u201d He shrugs off the end of his sentence. \u201cThough, after they see these donuts, they\u2019re bound to think Marigold is trying to poison Whit.\u201d \u201cVery droll,\u201d Marigold flicks his shoulder. Cain stops his Jeep in the parking garage near Mass General, and we transport three dozen ridiculous donuts to Whit\u2019s hospital room. En route, we pass Jean Metters, standing in the visitors\u2019 lounge where the use of mobile phones is permitted. Her free arm is folded across her chest, her voice low and sharp. I hear the words \u201csubpoena\u201d and \u201cdiscovery.\u201d We don\u2019t interrupt, secretly glad we don\u2019t have to face Whit\u2019s mom. The policeman in the corridor recognises us and waves us through. I knock and stick my head in through the doorway. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I bump into Marigold as I pull back. She drops a box of donuts, and matcha, quinoa, and star anise masterpieces scatter and roll onto disinfected floors. The two men by Whit\u2019s bed turn. Their eyes move up from the bouncing donuts to my face and then back down to Marigold, who\u2019s scrabbling to retrieve the carefully selected items. \u201cDon\u2019t step on my donuts on your way out,\u201d Whit says to his guests. The two men are similar to look at, gym stocky, wearing dark suits, closely fitted jackets which strain to button, and monochromatic ties. \u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing you, Metters,\u201d one replies. Whit grunts. They nod as they walk past, making no attempt to hide their scrutiny while their gazes linger on each of us in turn. Whit beckons, holding his arms out expectantly for the donuts. \u201cThis box is the one I dropped,\u201d Marigold says. Whit takes a donut from it. \u201cIf you can\u2019t eat off a hospital floor, what can you eat off?\u201d \u201cThere are two other boxes,\u201d Marigold tells him, placing said boxes on the table beside Whit\u2019s bed. \u201cI have faith in the cleaners.\u201d Whit takes a bite. \u201cThey\u2019re immigrants. They get the job done.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not less offensive because it\u2019s a Hamilton quote,\u201d I say reprovingly. \u201cIs it offensive?\u201d Whit is genuinely surprised. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I admit. \u201cIt just sounds reductive.\u201d Whit rolls his eyes. \u201cWho were those men?\u201d Marigold asks. \u201cOaks and McIntyre, I think they said\u2014Feds.\u201d \u201cFBI?\u201d Marigold is startled. \u201cWhere\u2019s Cain?\u201d Whit asks. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d I notice his absence for the first time. \u201cWhere did he go?\u201d Cain comes through the door. \u201cSorry, what did I miss?\u201d \u201cWhere were you?\u201d Cain hands Whit a slip of paper. \u201cOne of the doctors called me over. She wanted me to get that past your mother.\u201d Whit reads the note and smiles. \u201cMolly,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat does she want?\u201d Marigold asks. \u201cNothing. It\u2019s her number.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have a phone.\u201d Whit glances at Marigold. For a moment I fear he\u2019s going to say something witty and cutting, but he opts to be kind. \u201cI guess not.\u201d He looks for a pocket in his hospital gown and realising that there isn\u2019t one, he places the slip of paper under one of the boxes of donuts. \u201cMolly was on my surgical team.\u201d \u201cSo the number is for\u2026?\u201d Cain leans on the foot of the bed. \u201cI promised I\u2019d keep her posted on my recovery.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nice when they care, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Cain\u2019s lips quirk. Presumably Molly\u2019s interest extends beyond checking Whit\u2019s chart. \u201cYou must be better if the doctors are flirting with you,\u201d Marigold says, rearranging the donuts that had fallen out of the box. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to have one?\u201d Whit asks, taking a donut that seems to be growing its own lawn. Marigold opens one of the other boxes. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the ones from the floor for you\u2014you\u2019re on antibiotics anyway.\u201d \u201cCain, Freddie?\u201d We decline simultaneously, and Marigold explains that Cain and I are both far too lame and conventional to give anything aside from peanut butter and jelly a chance. Cain mutters something about the unfortunate victims of donut scams, and Marigold calls us \u201cold.\u201d It\u2019s true in a way. Cain and I are probably five years older than Whit and Marigold, who couldn\u2019t be much more than twenty-one or two. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d Marigold asks Cain. \u201cThirty.\u201d \u201cJesus, you\u2019re older than I thought!\u201d Cain shrugs. \u201cI can\u2019t be sure about Freddie, but I still have my own teeth.\u201d Whit looks at me. Curiosity struggling against social taboo. I put him out of his misery. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-seven.\u201d \u201cWell, I suppose you have a couple of good years left,\u201d Whit commiserates. \u201cBut I can see why you\u2019re staying away from the donuts. Blood sugar and all that.\u201d I call him an idiot. Whit winces as he chuckles. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d \u201cYeah. My laughing muscles have stitches in them, is all.\u201d \u201cHave the police got any leads on who might have done this to you?\u201d I ask. \u201cHave they said anything?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve decided it was someone I know\u2026or who knows me.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cThey seem to think it was the person who had Cain\u2019s phone. And that to send the messages he did to you, he must have known we were friends.\u201d \u201cHow many people know we\u2019re all friends?\u201d I ask. After all, we\u2019ve only known each other a couple of weeks. Whit shrugs. \u201cNot many. But who knows who might have been sitting near us at the library or at lunch somewhere? It\u2019s only the police who think there\u2019s a homicidal lunatic in my social circle.\u201d \u201cWhat about the FBI?\u201d Marigold asks. \u201cThey were asking about Cain.\u201d \u201cCain? What the hell for?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising, considering what my phone\u2019s been up to.\u201d Cain doesn\u2019t seem nearly as alarmed as I am by the revelation. \u201cWhat exactly did they ask?\u201d \u201cHow long I\u2019d known you, how I\u2019d met you, what you like to do with your time, whether I\u2019d ever seen you stab anyone\u2026\u201d Cain laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny, Whit.\u201d Marigold moves the box of donuts out of his reach. \u201cWho would have thought you\u2019d meet someone wanted by the FBI in a library?\u201d Whit stretches gingerly. \u201cJust because they were asking about Cain doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s wanted by them,\u201d I point out. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Whit looks at Cain. \u201cThey asked if I\u2019d ever known you by any other name.\u201d \u201cLike an alias?\u201d Marigold studies him curiously. \u201cLike a pen name,\u201d Cain says sheepishly. \u201cActually Cain McLeod is my pen name,\u201d he admits. \u201cThey\u2019re probably talking about my real name.\u201d \u201cWhich is?\u201d Marigold demands, exasperated. Cain folds his arms. \u201cCome on, whoever-you-are,\u201d Whit says, grinning. \u201cOut with it.\u201d After a moment Cain resigns. \u201cAbel Manners.\u201d Marigold gasps. Whit guffaws. I try not to let my feelings show so obviously. Cain sighs. \u201cYou can see why I changed it. One of the perks of writing a book is that you can change your name and pretend the publisher made you do it.\u201d \u201cAbel Manners!\u201d Whit roars laughing, choking on a donut as he does so. \u201cGod, that\u2019s wicked awful! You sound like a courteous porn star!\u201d He clutches his side and coughs violently, rolling onto his side. \u201cOh, fuck that hurts.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t want Abel Manners on the spine of my book, so\u2026\u201d he trails off staring at the expanding spot of crimson on the back of Whit\u2019s hospital greens. \u201cDammit, Whit\u2014you\u2019re bleeding.\u201d Whit reaches back to the patch of blood, which is already wet enough for him to feel, and then stares at the blood on his fingers as if it is something incomprehensible. Marigold runs out of the room to find help, and I press the buzzer to summon nurses, someone, anyone who\u2019ll know what to do. Within seconds we are pushed out of the room by the stream of people who pour in. We linger in the hallway, trying to stay out of the way, hoping to catch some fragment of shouted conversation that might tell us what\u2019s happening. We hear \u201chaemorrhaging\u201d and something about \u201cvitals.\u201d Whit\u2019s mother arrives. A doctor speaks with her. She glances at us during the conversation which we cannot hear. Whit is wheeled out to the theatre, and we\u2019re politely but firmly asked to decamp to the waiting room. *** Dear Hannah, I must admit this chapter made me hungry for donuts. I note that you didn\u2019t use a real shop\u2014there are a few in Boston which offer exotic concoctions. And of course there\u2019s Dunkin\u2019, which is something of a Boston institution. I\u2019ve made a list which I\u2019ve attached in a separate file, along with images of their shop fronts and some notes on nearby alleys or places which are conducive to the illicit. I expect, however, that you have created a fictional donut shop so that you may use it as a venue for violence of some sort without ruining anyone\u2019s business. It\u2019s considerate, though to be honest, that type of notoriety might do more to attract customers than repel them\u2026unless, of course, you\u2019re planning on poisoning people. I addressed my own cravings at a bakery in Back Bay. Divine! Honest, their products make you believe in God and willing to forsake him at the same time. The bakery is two miles from my pad so I figure the walk there and back is worth at least two donuts. Now a couple of little things. If Whit is in the latter stages of a law degree, which over here is a postgraduate course, he would be closer to twenty-five than twenty-one or two, unless he was some kind of child prodigy. The same goes for Marigold. I do like that Cain\u2019s name was once Abel. If it is possible to have a favorite biblical story, mine was that of Cain and Abel, the first murder. It adds a kind of ancient weight and tradition to the petty homicides of today, as though even the most base and inelegant dispatch has an echo in time and is a curse of the ages. I promise I\u2019m not completely discouraged by your agent\u2019s decision to pass on my manuscript. I know that you used all your influence on my behalf and will continue to do so. My time will come. Until then, I will bask in the reflected glory of your success. Anyway, I look forward to eating donuts with you in person someday soon. Yours, Leo \n Chapter Eleven Whit\u2019s father approaches us in the visitors\u2019 lounge where we\u2019ve been for over an hour. He\u2019s smiling, and so we are relieved even before he tells us that it was just a burst stitch and that Whit will be okay, though he\u2019ll need to rest quietly to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. Cain apologises for anything we might have done to make Whit exert himself too soon. \u201cHe said he was laughing.\u201d Frank Metters\u2019s lips curve to one side. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t say why, but clearly it was one helluva punch line.\u201d We say nothing. Metters loosens his tie. \u201cLook, Whit\u2019s not going to be able to see anyone for a while\u2014\u201d \u201cI thought he was all right,\u201d Marigold says. \u201cOh, he is. But Jean has swooped in to personally protect her boy. She\u2019s going to work from his room.\u201d Metters\u2019 face is sympathetic. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t bother trying to see him for a couple of days at least.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re sure he\u2019s all right?\u201d Cain asks. \u201cWhit? Oh, the boy is fine. And believe you me, his mother will make sure he doesn\u2019t laugh for a couple of days.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll be on our way then.\u201d Cain offers Metters his hand. Metters accepts the handshake and gives Cain his card. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about Whit, please call, and I\u2019ll give you the latest.\u201d It\u2019s strange leaving without at least seeing Whit to say goodbye, but there\u2019s no point setting up residence in the visitors\u2019 lounge, and Frank Metters promises to pass on our good wishes. It\u2019s only about a half-hour\u2019s walk to Carrington Square from Mass General, and so I decide to send Cain and Marigold off without me. \u201cI\u2019m sick of sitting.\u201d \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s safe?\u201d Marigold frowns. \u201cMaybe I should walk with you.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. It\u2019s three in the afternoon. I just want to walk and think about what I\u2019m writing\u2014get my head back in that space.\u201d Cain nods. \u201cGood luck. Hope the bus stops for you.\u201d For a flash, I\u2019m confused, and then I realise that I\u2019ve told him about my bus. I smile, pleased for some reason I can\u2019t quite identify. Perhaps it\u2019s merely knowing that he understands. \u201cI\u2019ll throw myself under it.\u201d Cain\u2019s brow rises. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be culturally insensitive, Freddie, but in America we just wait at the bus stop.\u201d I snort and call him a hack. Marigold still seems troubled. She hugs me farewell as if I\u2019m going to war, and that in itself gives me the giggles, which is a poor way of repaying her concern. Cain starts his Jeep and tells Marigold to get in. \u201cWe can follow her at a distance if you want,\u201d he says, leaning across and opening the passenger door. I wait and wave them off if only to make sure he was kidding. I tell my phone that I want to go home and wait for it to pull up a map. Thirty-four minutes by foot. Perfect. My mind slips easily into the manuscript as I walk. It feels like breathing out. My footsteps meter my thoughts. I ponder Heroic Chin. There\u2019s a privileged confidence about him. He\u2019s never failed at anything\u2026unless he\u2019s chosen to. I think about Whit\u2019s mother. She sits behind him on the bus, watching his every move while she speaks to her cell phone. Occasionally, she reaches out and smooths his hair. He ignores her but doesn\u2019t move seats either. He stays within her reach. Frank Metters sits beside his wife, reading through a file. He glances up when she touches Whit. There is a passing disquiet in his eyes, but he does nothing. I wonder what it is that Whit wants to do. Failing law appears to take effort, and it doesn\u2019t seem to me that Whit would expend that effort for no reason. I think he\u2019d be more likely to take the path of least resistance, to become a lawyer and make the best of it\u2026unless there was something else. A passion of some sort that did not fit with being a lawyer. Perhaps Heroic Chin wanted to play a sport of some sort professionally\u2014baseball or football\u2026even basketball. Or perhaps something less conventional\u2026 And then it occurs to me. Could Heroic Chin be a dancer? Perhaps that was his connection to Freud Girl, to the dead ballerina who lurked in her past. Could they both have known her, both have loved her? Might one of them have killed her? The last thought jolts me. My characters are too connected to the real people who inspired them, and those real people are my friends. New, but already beloved, wrapped in the excited crush of friendship\u2019s beginning, untarnished by the annoyances, disappointments, and minor betrayals which come with the passing of time. I walk into Copley Square, and for a brief moment I pause to revel in the fact that I am here. In Boston. Despite everything that\u2019s happened in the past couple of weeks, I am still aware of the privilege of the Sinclair Fellowship, still thrilled by it. I stand by the fountain and soak in the sounds of the plaza: traffic, people, American accents\u2014some Bostonian, others not. For a while I meander, happily watching people go about their daily business. \u201cFreddie!\u201d Leo Johnson runs to catch up with me. \u201cHello!\u201d I smile as he removes his baseball cap. His hair is damp and he\u2019s breathing heavily. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d \u201cThey let me out of Carrington Square every now and then. Whew!\u201d He wipes his brow with his sleeve. \u201cI spotted you on the other side of the square\u2026only just caught you, though.\u201d I look at him, bemused. \u201cWhere were you when you spotted me? New York?\u201d \u201cNo ma\u2019am, I was\u2026\u201d He stops. \u201cOh\u2026I see what you mean. I was jogging.\u201d \u201cJogging?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t look so horrified. Writers jog.\u201d \u201cIf they\u2019re being chased.\u201d He laughs. \u201cAre you heading back to the Carrington?\u201d \u201cYes, but I\u2019m not going to race you.\u201d \u201cCoward.\u201d He twists into a stretch as he\u2019s talking to me. \u201cI was thinking we could have that dinner\u2014complain about writers\u2019 blocks and words without synonyms.\u201d I check my watch. I can\u2019t put Leo off again without it seeming intentional, and I would like to talk to him about my work, the reports on our residencies we would each have to present. \u201cYou\u2019re on. Where shall we go?\u201d He scratches his head and replaces the baseball cap. \u201cHow\u2019s about I order something in and we eat at my place\u2026or yours, if you prefer.\u201d \u201cNo, your apartment is fine. My place is a mess\u2026my muse is a bit of a slob.\u201d \u201cThey tend to be.\u201d He begins running on the spot. \u201cHalf past six? That\u2019ll give me time to shower.\u201d \u201cSure, I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d I wave as he jogs away, vaguely realising that I have for some reason assumed Leo was much older than he obviously is. Perhaps it\u2019s his accent\u2026the Southern drawl which conjures Gone with the Wind, or the fact that normally he is quite buttoned down in style. Even now he isn\u2019t really wearing jogging gear. Mrs. Weinbaum is watering plants in the foyer when I get back to Carrington Square. It\u2019s the janitor\u2019s job, she tells me, but she doesn\u2019t think he ever gives them enough. She wonders if I have found the yoghurt is helping, only she might try some for her lumbago. To be honest, I have no idea what lumbago is, aside from it being a condition ascribed to old people in sitcoms. I try to explain that there was never anything wrong with me, that I just like yoghurt, but she will not have it. In the end we agree that yoghurt is worth trying, and she promises to keep me posted on the outcome. I return to my apartment in a good mood after the encounter, which, though absurd, was warm. Shoes off, then coffee brewing and my laptop out. I\u2019ll be able to write for a couple of hours at least. Running into Leo reminds me that I am here to write a novel, regardless of murders and donuts, and I\u2019m grateful that I have a colleague who has no connection with the scream and all it has led to, against whom to pace myself. It\u2019s five to six when I notice the time again. I run into the bathroom and brush my teeth, changing my shirt with the brush still in my mouth. There\u2019s no time for makeup, but I wet my hands and use them to tidy the curls into some sort of order. I put my shoes back on and grab a bottle of wine from the cupboard before walking down the hallway to Leo\u2019s apartment. \u201cDoor\u2019s open,\u201d in response to my knock. Leo\u2019s apartment is a mirror image of mine architecturally, though its aesthetic is more modern. The sitting room is dominated by yellow sofas and a swivelling leather egg chair. Immediately, I want to try out the egg chair. Leo grins knowingly. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody who walks in here is fixed on taking it for a spin.\u201d And so I do exactly that. The chair spins smoothly with very little effort as its curve cradles me. \u201cDo you write in this?\u201d I ask Leo as he comes in and out of view on my rotation. He shakes his head. \u201cI prefer to spread out on one of the sofas. I find the movement is a bit distracting.\u201d \u201cI can imagine it would be, but it\u2019s fun!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve ordered pizza,\u201d Leo says. \u201cI hope you like pepperoni.\u201d I stop the chair and grimace. \u201cI should have mentioned, I\u2019m a vegetarian\u2026\u201d \u201cOh, shoot! I should have asked. There\u2019s so many of you around nowadays, I should have thought to ask\u2014\u201d \u201cI can pull the pepperoni off\u2014\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll do nothing of the sort\u2014I\u2019ll change the order.\u201d He makes a call and adds a vegetarian pizza. \u201cNow that\u2019s sorted, can I offer you a drink?\u201d I hold out my bottle of wine, and soon we are sitting on the yellow sofas with glasses\u2014Leo having warned me that the egg chair and alcohol are a dangerous combination. I ask him about his novel. I fancy that Leo writes historical fiction, and for some reason I\u2019m convinced his era is the Roman Empire. I have no reason to suppose this\u2026it\u2019s just a fancy. \u201cRomance,\u201d he says. \u201cI write romance.\u201d My surprise clearly needs no words because he continues to explain. \u201cMy agent will tell you it\u2019s a story about passionate friendships and reluctant relationships in modern America, but really it\u2019s a romance.\u201d \u201cOh\u2026set today?\u201d I\u2019m still thinking gladiators. \u201cModern America, remember.\u201d \u201cHave you\u2026have you always written romance?\u201d \u201cYes, and what\u2019s more, so have you. The mystery writers, the historical novelists, the political thriller writers, the science fiction writers\u2026everybody but the people who write instruction manuals is writing romance. We dress our stories up with murders, and discussions about morality and society, but really we just care about relationships.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. You\u2019re saying Stephen King writes romances?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201d Leo sits back in the sofa. \u201cThe killer clown is entertaining and all that, but what we\u2019re really interested in is whether the fat kid gets the pretty girl.\u201d \u201cI think that may be a bit simplistic.\u201d A knock on the door heralds the arrival of our pizzas, and we open the boxes between us and arm ourselves with slices before we continue. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what exactly you\u2019d call what I\u2019m writing, but it\u2019s not a romance.\u201d I tell him about my work, the story of three people bonded by a scream. He listens carefully. \u201cClassic love triangle,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about whether Handsome Man or Heroic Chin will win the heart of Freud Girl.\u201d \u201cWhat about the scream, the murderer?\u201d \u201cBackground colour.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. You could use that logic to call any book a romance.\u201d \u201cMy point exactly.\u201d I look at him silently. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhether I know you well enough to call you an idiot while sitting on your couch and eating your pizza.\u201d Leo nods thoughtfully. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I think you do.\u201d \u201cI might wait until I\u2019ve finished the pizza.\u201d \u201cSo these characters of yours, they\u2019re based on the people you met in the library?\u201d \u201cYes. We were together in the Reading Room when we heard the scream.\u201d \u201cDoes Handsome Man know you call him Handsome Man?\u201d \u201cNo\u2026that would be embarrassing for both of us.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it. Good-looking guys know they\u2019re good-looking. We have mirrors, after all.\u201d I look up sharply. Did he just say what I think he said? There\u2019s laughter in his eyes, and I realise he\u2019s teasing me. \u201cSo what do you all do with this knowledge? You and the other guys.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s all about distraction.\u201d \u201cYou are an idiot.\u201d He laughs out loud now. We talk about my work and then his. He asks me a few hypothetical questions about how I\u2019d react against some very specific situations. \u201cLeo, are you using me for research?\u201d \u201cMaybe a little,\u201d he admits sheepishly. \u201cI\u2019m having trouble with a scene. Do you mind?\u201d \u201cNot at all. Do you want to show me the scene? Maybe I could help.\u201d \u201cSure. Though it\u2019s still first-draft rough.\u201d We work on his manuscript while we eat the rest of the pizza. The draft is rough with patches of beauty. Leo\u2019s characters are ethereal, a little idealised, which is probably why he wanted help. Well, perhaps not help exactly. Rather a friendly wall against which to bounce his thoughts, and the insight of my gender. The story he\u2019s calling a romance is a gothic tale about rejection and obsession, and his prose, haunting. It makes me yearn to be working on my own manuscript. I glance up at the clock projected onto the ceiling and spin slowly to orient the face. \u201cIs it eleven o\u2019clock?\u201d Leo nods. \u201cDid you have to be somewhere?\u201d \u201cNo, but it\u2019s late. I\u2019d better make tracks.\u201d He offers me coffee. I shake my head and get up to go. \u201cThanks for the pizza, Leo.\u201d \u201cThanks for helping me out. I appreciate it. If you ever need me to do the same\u2014\u201d \u201cI might just take you up on it if you quit trying to tell me that I\u2019m writing romance,\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201d He walks me to my door and wishes me good night. A moment of awkwardness as we say goodbye. We end up shaking hands, laughing because it\u2019s a little weird. We have just shared pizza and talked for hours\u2014but about our work. We\u2019re more colleagues than friends, I think. He waits until I\u2019ve unlocked my door before he leaves me to it\u2014Southern gallantry, possibly. Or perhaps it\u2019s the fact that there\u2019s a murderer somewhere. *** Dear Hannah, I can\u2019t tell you how thrilling it is to walk into your work. Thank you\u2014this chapter cheered me up no end! I do like Leo. There\u2019s a real chemistry between him and Freddie. I promise he and I will be there to console Freddie when she finally discovers the awful truth about Cain. I love the way you describe Leo\u2019s writing. I dare to hope you took that from life as well. The chapter is perfect. Change nothing. And thank you. You have done me an honor. In answer to your question about cinemas, I\u2019d recommend The Brattle. It has an interesting culture of its own. And, incidentally, by way of interest, I read in the Globe yesterday that Alexandra Gainsborough\u2014that agent who turned down the opus\u2014passed away. An accident of some sort. Two days ago she was vibrant and mighty, she had the power to realize or kill dreams, and today she herself is dead. I sent condolences, of course. It\u2019s funny how things work out sometimes. Yours, Leo \n Chapter Twelve Another box of groceries is delivered the next morning. The doorman brings it up for me. \u201cThank you, Joe.\u201d I take the box from him and grab ten dollars from my wallet. \u201cYou have a fiver in there, ma\u2019am?\u201d \u201cOh, of course, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I splutter, mortified. I\u2019m never sure how much to tip for things without a bill, and it horrifies me that Joe would think I was mean. He takes the five and gives me back the ten. \u201cLet\u2019s not get carried away\u2014I just brought it up.\u201d \u201cOh\u2026yes\u2026sorry. We don\u2019t really tip in Australia. I\u2019m having a hard time getting used to it.\u201d \u201cNo tips, eh? Can\u2019t say I understand how that would work.\u201d \u201cI guess we pay people more for the kind of jobs that you tip people for here.\u201d \u201cWe?\u201d \u201cEmployers. It\u2019s the law.\u201d Joe shakes his head. \u201cI can\u2019t see it working\u2026how do you show your appreciation?\u201d \u201cGenerally we say thank you.\u201d Joe laughs. \u201cWell, maybe that\u2019s worth something.\u201d \u201cThank you, Joe.\u201d \u201cI ain\u2019t giving you back the tip, you know.\u201d His laugh is deep and kind of round. I like Joe. It\u2019s taken a little while to be able to kid around with him, but he\u2019s always been thoughtful and warm. \u201cHey Joe, I don\u2019t suppose you noticed anyone who mightn\u2019t have been a resident at Carrington or shouldn\u2019t have been here last Friday?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d He says absolutely and without hesitation. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my job to stop anyone who isn\u2019t a resident or with a resident and ask their business, Miss Kincaid. I haven\u2019t stopped anyone aside from your friends and Mrs. Weinbaum\u2019s granddaughter for more than a week.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d \u201cIs there something wrong, Miss Kincaid?\u201d \u201cNo\u2026well, maybe.\u201d I tell him about the photograph of my door without going into the rest. \u201cIt\u2019s only a picture, but it\u2019s freaked me out a little.\u201d \u201cWho sent it\u2014the picture of your door?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. It was sent from Cain\u2019s phone. He\u2019d lost it the day before.\u201d Joe frowns. \u201cWell, I reckon it could be one of your friend Cain\u2019s buddies. He\u2019s found the phone and he\u2019s playing a joke.\u201d \u201cWouldn\u2019t a friend have come forward by now?\u201d \u201cMaybe he intended to fess up but chickened out.\u201d \u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d I\u2019m not really convinced, but I don\u2019t want to go into everything else that had gone on. \u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye out, just in case,\u201d he assures me. Joe leaves me to unpack my box of groceries. Its contents are different from the ones in the last box. The foodstuffs more luxury items than essentials\u2014fine cheeses, Quince paste, wine, and sweets. Definitely no yoghurt. I call Cain to thank him. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2014you\u2019re actually the heir to Whole Foods?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cI mean thank you, Cain. It\u2019s so kind, and very generous, but you don\u2019t have to send me a box of groceries every time you have a meal at my place.\u201d \u201cYou got another box of groceries?\u201d \u201cWell, more gourmet than groceries\u2014\u201d \u201cFreddie, I didn\u2019t send it.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d \u201cMarigold?\u201d I laugh, a little sheepish. \u201cProbably. I should call her.\u201d \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a card?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I peer again into the box in case I missed it. \u201cJust cheese, wine, and chocolate\u2026that sort of thing\u201d \u201cI guess that beats yoghurt. How\u2019s your novel coming?\u201d \u201cI wrote heaps last night, actually.\u201d After returning from Leo\u2019s I had worked until three in the morning. \u201cYou?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not really focusing, to be honest.\u201d \u201cWhit?\u201d \u201cProbably.\u201d \u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you feel like seeing a movie tonight? North by Northwest is playing at The Brattle.\u201d \u201cCary Grant? Oh, my God, yes, please!\u201d Cain chuckles. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2014he\u2019s still a big star in Australia.\u201d \u201cMy dad was a classic film buff\u2026 I\u2019d watch with him sometimes. Especially if it was a Cary Grant film.\u201d \u201cHis real name was Archibald, you know. Archibald Leach.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t care.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at six, then.\u201d I switch off my phone, smiling. Excitement bubbles against my determination not to behave like a giddy teenager. I return to work, telling myself that this will be no different than having dinner with Leo. A meeting of colleagues, nothing more. But I suspect it is more. Regardless, denying the possibility is a necessary defence against disappointment\u2014protection against making a fool of myself. The words are coming today. Heroic Chin beckons me. His relationship with Freud Girl is tantalising. There\u2019s a kindness to the way he treats her, a care, and yet the sexual tension, at least on his part, seems a little cavalier. He is sexually interested in her, but that interest is casual. The care comes from a different place. Of course that\u2019s not so for Freud Girl. I wonder if Leo might not be right. Am I writing romance? Even as I focus on Heroic Chin and Freud Girl, thoughts of Cain McLeod come upon unguarded moments. They surprise me. And without knowing where exactly the thought began, I find myself contemplating him. And I feel guilty. Because I should be concentrating on my manuscript. I call Marigold in the hope the conversation will be a kind of circuit breaker and begin by thanking her for the box of fancy groceries. \u201cWhat groceries?\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t send them either.\u201d \u201cEither?\u201d \u201cI thought it might have been Cain again, but it wasn\u2019t.\u201d I stare at the box as I speak. \u201cWhat exactly was in it?\u201d \u201cChocolates, wine, cheese\u2026\u201d \u201cWow! I\u2019m on my way\u2014\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t, I\u2019m going out\u2026\u201d \u201cOh. Where?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s weird? There was no card.\u201d \u201cNo, that\u2019s not weird\u2026people forget to include a card all the time.\u201d \u201cI guess.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll probably realise who it is in a couple of days.\u201d I give myself an internal shake. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s only that I feel rude not thanking someone\u2026 What are you doing?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m buying donuts.\u201d A pause and then Marigold continues hastily. \u201cI\u2019ve become a little hooked on the chai custard and coffee ones.\u201d I laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll keep your secret. At least until you start mugging people to support your habit.\u201d \u201cI can stop anytime\u2026after tomorrow.\u201d Another pause. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard anything from Whit\u2019s dad about how he is, have you?\u201d \u201cNo\u2026 He gave Cain his card. Maybe\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, yeah\u2026 Do you think\u2014?\u201d \u201cI spoke to Cain a few minutes ago. He didn\u2019t mention anything, and I\u2019m sure he would have.\u201d \u201cI might call the hospital.\u201d Cain arrives at ten to six. He\u2019s wearing a collared shirt and sports coat, and I am relieved that I decided on a skirt rather than jeans. Perhaps it\u2019s because the film is vintage, but it seems appropriate to dress more formally than I would for the latest Marvel Universe offering. Cain waits while I grab my coat and gloves. He\u2019s looking at the old picture in a small silver frame on the mantelpiece, when I emerge from the bedroom ready to go. \u201cWhich one are you?\u201d he asks. There are two barely adolescent girls in the photograph. \u201cI\u2019m the taller one on the right.\u201d \u201cSo this is your little sister?\u201d \u201cWas my little sister. Gerry died about a month after than photo was taken.\u201d I tell him about the accident. \u201cGod, how awful. I\u2019m sorry, Freddie.\u201d I look at the photo, wondering what Geraldine would have thought of Cain. She\u2019d been scathing of most of the boys who had caught my eye back then\u2026but I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019d have any objection to Cain. \u201cDo you have any siblings?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI was it.\u201d \u201cWas that lonely?\u201d \u201cProbably. If I\u2019d stopped to think about it.\u201d I tell him about Gerry on the way out to the car, my tomboyish, smart- aleck sister. \u201cOf course, most of us have changed a bit since we were eleven, so maybe she would have been different if she lived.\u201d \u201cAre you different?\u201d I think about it for a moment. \u201cI began to write after Gerry died. Letters to her at first\u2014I expect some counsellor suggested it. Then poems and stories as part of those letters. Even now, I think I\u2019m writing for Gerry.\u201d The Brattle Theatre is near Harvard Square and specialises in classic and international films. It\u2019s a single-screen repertory theatre, and its runs are short. Cain tells me that North by Northwest is showing for one night only. \u201cHave you come here before?\u201d The Brattle has a kind of hidden feel about it, like a speakeasy known only to trusted patrons. A life-size poster of Alfred Hitchcock with his finger on his lips greets us at the end of the stairs to the main theatre. Murals from Casablanca grace the walls. Cain nods. \u201cSince I came back to Boston\u2014a few times. They had a Bogart marathon here a few weeks ago.\u201d We choose seats. There are a few people there, mostly couples, but it is by no means full. Cain leans in to point out the old signs and other movie paraphernalia around the hall, and I am aware of something fluttering inside me. I nearly laugh out loud at the clich\u00e9 of me. Cain notices. \u201cSorry\u2014I didn\u2019t mean to sound like a tour guide. I just love this old place.\u201d I nudge him. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying the tour. Thank you for bringing me here.\u201d He takes my hand. At that moment the house lights dim, and I\u2019m so glad because I\u2019m sure not what my face is doing. My heart is pounding like a schoolgirl\u2019s, and I\u2019m afraid to move lest the moment pass. His hand feels large and strong, the pressure is gentle, casual. The opening credits begin and we watch. Occasionally, he leans down to whisper something about a shot, and by the time Cary Grant is clambering around Mount Rushmore, our fingers are interlaced. When the lights come up, I\u2019m not sure what to do. Do I let go first? Will he? Cain looks at me. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d I nod. He squeezes my hand before he releases it to retrieve his coat, which he\u2019d left on the empty seat beside him. I calm the flutters. This is silly. I\u2019m twenty-seven, not fourteen. We walk from The Brattle to an Italian place in Harvard Square. It\u2019s called Jake\u2019s, which admittedly does not immediately evoke the Mediterranean, but inside the aroma is rich and tantalising. The decor is simple and traditional, small tables draped in checked linen, bentwood chairs, candles in bottles. A basket of bread, still warm from the oven, and a pat of butter are placed on the table as we sit down. I realise I\u2019m starving. \u201cAt the end of the night,\u201d Cain says quietly, \u201cJake\u2019s leaves the leftover food in the back alley in takeaway boxes, so you don\u2019t have to rummage through the bins. Believe it or not, it\u2019s almost as good cold.\u201d \u201cAre there a lot of people sleeping rough in Boston?\u201d Cain nods. \u201cMore than you\u2019d think. Not all of them sleep in the streets\u2014a lot live in their cars or move from shelter to shelter. There are always more than enough people to take what Jake\u2019s put out anyway.\u201d \u201cSo how does it work?\u201d I ask. \u201cI can\u2019t be certain about now, but back then it wasn\u2019t always pleasant\u2014there\u2019d be shoving and pushing, threats, though it stayed basically civilised. We all knew Jake\u2019s didn\u2019t have to do it\u2026you didn\u2019t want them to stop because fights were breaking out in their alley.\u201d I choose vegetarian cannelloni for what I call mains and Cain calls entr\u00e9e. We both order panna cotta for dessert, committing at the outset to lingering, and when the waiter retreats, we talk about the film, Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, and Hitchcock, then Weinstein and the revolution and what it\u2019s changed. We discuss Tippi Hedren and the problem of loving Hitchcock\u2019s work. \u201cWould my book, my words, be different if I were a murderer, for example?\u201d Cain asks carefully. I think about it for a moment. \u201cWords have meaning. I suppose who the author is, what he\u2019s done might change that meaning.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t meaning more to do with the reader?\u201d \u201cNo\u2026a story is about leading a reader to meaning. The revelation is theirs, but we show them the way. I suppose the morality of the writer influences whether you can trust what they are showing you.\u201d \u201cEven if you don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve done?\u201d \u201cEspecially if you don\u2019t know. If you are aware, then you can account for it in your interpretation of the work. Is it a manipulation, a defence? Is it an expression of guilt?\u201d Cain\u2019s quiet for a moment. \u201cI guess so.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t agree.\u201d \u201cNo\u2026you\u2019re right. But I still like Hitchcock\u2019s work.\u201d I sigh. \u201cYes, so do I.\u201d I ask him to tell me more about himself. \u201cI know you spent time on the streets in Boston, but are you from here?\u201d \u201cNo\u2014it was just where I ran out of bus money. I grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina.\u201d \u201cAnd you had a stepfather, so your own father\u2014\u201d \u201cHe died.\u201d Cain takes a sip from his wineglass. \u201cWhen I was about six. He had a heart attack.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t remember too much about him. He rooted for the Red Sox, and he liked broccoli\u2026at least he used to tell me he did.\u201d \u201cAnd your stepfather?\u201d \u201cMom married him when I was eight. He was great at first. Took me to games, played ball with me. He wanted a large family\u2014was always telling me what we\u2019d do when my brothers and sisters came along.\u201d Cain pauses. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t come along\u2014he and Mom tried but they couldn\u2019t get pregnant. He started to drink. He blamed Mom first and then me.\u201d \u201cOh, Cain.\u201d I want to reach out to him but there\u2019s a table between us. He smiles. \u201cIt was a long time ago, Freddie. Isaac used to say, \u2018Everybody\u2019s got a sad story, boy, and yours is a boring one!\u2019\u201d I can feel my head moving back. \u201cReally?\u201d Cain\u2019s smile broadens. \u201cI told you, he wasn\u2019t cast by Disney.\u201d \u201cSo, did it change when you went back?\u201d \u201cNo. But I had.\u201d Our meals arrive and the next moments are taken up with welcoming them to our table, thanking the waiter, and comparing dishes. Cain asks about my work and, for a fleeting absurd moment, I think of Leo asking me if Handsome Man realises I\u2019m calling him that. I can feel myself blush for apparently no reason, but if Cain notices he does not mention it. And I talk to him about everything aside from what I\u2019ve named him. He listens as I describe how the characters in my work are growing and mutating from their real inspiration. \u201cAt what point are you going to untether your characters?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhen are you going to let them diverge from the people you know?\u201d \u201cWhen I know you all enough to know I\u2019m diverging, I suppose. Or when your real stories become boring.\u201d He laughs. I see his eyes widen suddenly. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d I glance over my shoulder. \u201cNo\u2014not wrong,\u201d he begins. I see then what\u2019s caught his eye. Marigold. *** Dear Hannah, Some may find a tendency to stalk people a negative trait, but on Marigold it is somehow alluring. Who knew a hint of psychosis could be so attractive? And we find out just a little bit more about Cain. Not a lot\u2026he remains elusive. But we know now he\u2019s from the Tar Heel State! He, too, would have a Southern accent\u2014not as marked as that of my namesake. You may wish to add a bit of dialect. For example, Cain would probably refer to Jake\u2019s as a \u201cjoint\u201d rather than a \u201crestaurant.\u201d He might also use \u201cy\u2019all\u201d and \u201cyonder\u201d occasionally. I must say I do like the sounds of Isaac. It a shame he\u2019s already dead. I read this morning that Australia has now closed its borders to non-citizens, as has the U.S. It\u2019s a strange and tedious new world. I suppose this means your postponed trip stateside will not be undertaken in the near future. Fortunately, I remain willing and able to be your American informant. I am excruciatingly aware of the moments of history through which we are living. It seems to me that we are seeing the dying days of democracy\u2014at least here in America. And perhaps the beginning of a new Dark Age. I find myself more intrigued than despondent about the notion. The world is on the cusp of being overwhelmed by fear and rage, a dystopia beyond any we might have imagined in our writings. Stay safe. Yours, Leo \n Chapter Thirteen Marigold picks up a bag of takeout and hands over her card. She doesn\u2019t appear to have seen us. My eyes meet Cain\u2019s. Guilt, and uncertainty how to proceed. Cain speaks first. \u201cShould we?\u201d I nod, swallowing my reluctance. Cain stands and catches Marigold\u2019s attention. She looks at us blankly at first and then with surprise. He beckons for her to join us, and Marigold makes her way to our table. \u201cWhat are you two doing here?\u201d She asks before I can ask her the same. Cain is unflustered. \u201cThere was a film on at The Brattle that I thought Freddie might find useful for her book.\u201d \u201cThe Brattle? Was it a documentary?\u201d She groans. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d Cain replies. He pulls a chair out for Marigold. \u201cAre you going to have dessert with us, Marigold?\u201d He glances at her takeout bag. \u201cUnless dessert is preemptive.\u201d Marigold takes a seat. \u201cEating dessert last is a ridiculous social dictate. Gosh, it\u2019s lucky I ran into you.\u201d \u201cA happy coincidence,\u201d I say, thinking for the first time that it is, indeed, a coincidence. Marigold agrees. \u201cI come here all the time. Funny that of all the places in Harvard Square, you\u2019d pick this.\u201d \u201cClearly, we all have good taste.\u201d I change the subject. \u201cDid you get through to the hospital?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Marigold communicates with the waiter on the other side of the room via elaborate charades that she\u2019ll have whatever we\u2019re having. \u201cThey\u2019ve released him.\u201d \u201cWhat? Already?\u201d Marigold thanks the waiter. \u201cApparently.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s terrific, I guess.\u201d I am admittedly a little bewildered by this sudden return to health. \u201cThey\u2019ve probably decided Whit can recuperate at home,\u201d Cain suggests. \u201cBetween the police and his mother, he was turning the ward into a circus.\u201d Marigold screws up her nose, but she agrees. \u201cI think Whit\u2019s mom is suing the hospital for negligence\u2014because the stitch broke.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I shake my head slowly. \u201cI suppose we could consider ourselves lucky she\u2019s not suing us for making him laugh.\u201d \u201cUs?\u201d Marigold points at Cain. \u201cHe told Whit that his name was Abel Manners!\u201d Cain grimaces. \u201cIn hindsight, I agree I should have kept my fool mouth shut. But not because Whit broke a stitch.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad Whit\u2019s home safe.\u201d I take my first bite of panna cotta and savour it unashamedly. \u201cOh, he\u2019s safe,\u201d Marigold says. \u201cThere are at least a dozen security guards stationed outside his parents\u2019 house.\u201d I swallow. The pause is just a beat too long as both Cain and I process her words. \u201cMarigold,\u201d I put down my spoon and look at her, \u201cdid you go to Whit\u2019s house?\u201d She nods, smiling conspiratorially. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t knock or anything. I only walked past a couple of times.\u201d \u201cThat mightn\u2019t have been the best idea at the moment,\u201d Cain says quietly. Marigold\u2019s face falls a bit. \u201cI know. But I needed to see if he was there.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d She says nothing for a moment. When she speaks her voice is thick, forced. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Sometimes it\u2019s like I can\u2019t breathe if I don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d \u201cOh, Marigold.\u201d There\u2019s something so young and confused about her, so fragile, despite everything. \u201cDoes Whit know you feel this way?\u201d Cain asks. She regards him with horror. \u201cOf course not!\u201d I wonder. It seems to me that he might have an idea, but I don\u2019t raise it. \u201cStill, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be hanging around Whit\u2019s house right now,\u201d Cain says gently. Marigold\u2019s giggle is nervous. \u201cI wasn\u2019t hanging around. Just passing.\u201d She shakes her head firmly. \u201cI didn\u2019t even pause.\u201d Cain glances at me. \u201cThat might look a bit suspicious, Marigold, if they notice you.\u201d I\u2019m worried about her. \u201cNext time, maybe stop and call in. It\u2019s not strange that Whit\u2019s friends want to know how he is.\u201d Marigold\u2019s eyes brighten. \u201cDo you think I should?\u201d \u201cI think it would be better than lurking on the street outside.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t lurking\u2014\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cHave you heard anything more about Caroline Palfrey?\u201d Cain asks. He\u2019s changing the subject ever so slightly, and both Marigold and I are grateful. Marigold frowns. \u201cNo, not really. There are a lot of reporters asking questions for stories\u2026you know, the \u2018all-American girl slain\u2019 type. They\u2019re looking for some kind of double life, I think.\u201d \u201cAnd was there?\u201d Cain asks. \u201cDid she have a double life?\u201d \u201cNo. Not that I\u2019ve heard. Unless you count writing for the Rag a double life.\u201d We return to our desserts in silence for a while, until Marigold offers a further fact. \u201cThat\u2019s where she met Whit. At the Rag.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right. Whit wrote once,\u201d I remember. Marigold shrugs. \u201cHe reported\u2014and it was more than once.\u201d For a moment I think of Heroic Chin and his secret love of dance. Cain is looking at Marigold thoughtfully. \u201cHad you and Whit met before that day in the library?\u201d Marigold hesitates. \u201cWe literally bumped into each other once. But he doesn\u2019t remember.\u201d It occurs to me that Cain is only this evening fully realising that Marigold is in love with Whit. I\u2019m a little bemused that it has taken him so long. As we finish dessert and drink coffee, Marigold asks about The Adventures of Freud Girl, as she is fond of calling my manuscript. \u201cWill you let me read it when you\u2019re finished?\u201d I\u2019m touched by the way she asks. Like reading the work of a writer is a privilege and not the purpose for which we write. \u201cYes, if you\u2019d like.\u201d \u201cOf course I\u2019d like! And I promise I won\u2019t get upset if it\u2019s not all about Freud Girl.\u201d I laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll bear that in mind.\u201d She turns to Cain. \u201cI was thinking about your novel.\u201d \u201cYou were?\u201d \u201cI was wondering if it might help to know more about Isaac\u2014where he was from, what he might have done before he was on the streets?\u201d Cain looks startled. \u201cYes, I suppose it might.\u201d \u201cHarvard\u2019s got some awesome research facilities for students. I could do some research for you if you like\u2014his last name was Harmon, right?\u201d \u201cYes\u2026but I\u2019ve already looked, Marigold. There are no records of Isaac before he died.\u201d \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to try. Maybe you need fresh eyes.\u201d Cain\u2019s brow furrows. \u201cThank you, but it\u2019s really not necessary. I have everything I need for the book. It\u2019s a novel, not an autobiography.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll give me something to do.\u201d Marigold is typically difficult to dissuade. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a degree to keep you entertained?\u201d \u201cDegrees do not entertain, Cain.\u201d Marigold sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t really sleep well\u2014it means I have extra hours to fill when normal people are asleep.\u201d \u201cTo be honest, Marigold, I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d Cain is blunt. \u201cWhy? I could\u2014\u201d \u201cThis is my novel. I\u2019d rather do it myself.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d Marigold looks crushed, and I am startled by Cain\u2019s words if not his tone. He is immediately contrite. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Marigold, I didn\u2019t mean to snarl. It\u2019s just that I feel like Isaac is entitled to his privacy. He didn\u2019t have much else.\u201d Marigold\u2019s gaze is searching. Cain holds it. Eventually, she looks away. \u201cOf course; I understand.\u201d Cain relaxes. \u201cThank you.\u201d He offers to drive her home. \u201cMy Jeep\u2019s parked over yonder, near The Brattle.\u201d Marigold shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019m on Athens Street. I can walk.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll walk you home then and come back for the car,\u201d I insist, as Cain signals that we\u2019re ready for the bill. \u201cYou should be careful, at least until Caroline Palfrey\u2019s murderer is found.\u201d Marigold scoffs. \u201cI keep forgetting you\u2019re Australian. I\u2019d bet there are probably a dozen unsolved murderers within a block or so of here. They\u2019re more common than spiders.\u201d \u201cAll the more reason then.\u201d The waitress comes to the table to tell us the bill has been taken care of. \u201cBy whom?\u201d Cain asks perplexed. The waitress looks down at her digital notebook. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know, sir. It just says here that the bill\u2019s been paid.\u201d \u201cCould there be some mistake?\u201d \u201cMaybe. But the bill has been paid.\u201d \u201cHow about I leave you my number?\u201d I\u2019m concerned that if there is a mistake the waitress might end up being asked to pay for any shortfall. \u201cIf there is a problem, then you can call me, and we can sort it out.\u201d She takes the number but assures me it will be unnecessary. \u201cSometimes folks do this sort of thing\u2026pay it forward, or pay for a stranger or whatever meme is doing the rounds. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.\u201d And so we thank her, grab our coats, and leave a generous tip before stepping back out into the square. The cold is immediately invigorating, and I\u2019m glad we have reason to walk somewhere. Marigold directs our path to her apartment on Athens Street off Mass Avenue, and we talk about the stars as we walk the well-lit streets, which make seeing them here impossible. I tell Cain and Marigold about the blazing night skies out west in Australia, under which you can truly feel the immensity of the universe. A prick of homesickness as I remember locking my eyes on the Southern Cross to reorient myself among the stars. Marigold leads us to an elegant, old weatherboard building sporting large bays on either end, so that it\u2019s shaped a little like a bone. This is a nice part of town, and the buildings here all have a similar old world charm. Marigold\u2019s apartment is on the second floor. We can hear music as we climb the stairs. \u201cThat\u2019ll be Lucas,\u201d Marigold says. \u201cLucas?\u201d \u201cMy flatmate. Come on, I\u2019ll introduce you.\u201d She unlocks the door and waves us into the apartment which is pulsing with heavy metal played at a thousand decibels. We walk into a living room decorated in a kind of edgy urban chic. The couches are large, worn leather pieces. One wall is lined with what appear to be lockers. The television is massive and sits above the mantel of the fireplace, which defies its industrial surrounds with delicate craftsmen details. Marigold grabs a remote control from the arm of the couch and turns off the music. \u201cHey, what the fuck\u2014\u201d A man emerges from one of the other rooms protesting. He\u2019s huge, at least six and half feet. His hair is long and dreadlocked, and various parts of him are pierced. He\u2019s wearing nothing but boxer shorts. For a moment we all just stare at each other. Then Marigold groans. \u201cFor Chrissake, Lucas, put on some pants, at least.\u201d \u201cNot on our account,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI mean, we aren\u2019t staying\u2014we were only seeing Marigold home.\u201d Lucas nods. In greeting or perhaps agreement that he will not be putting on pants. Marigold rolls her eyes. \u201cThis is Lucas, my flatmate. Lucas, my friends Cain and Freddie.\u201d \u201cPleasure,\u201d Lucas grunts. He eyes the bag of takeout. \u201cWhat took you so long? I\u2019m starving.\u201d She holds out the bag to him. \u201cGo on, then. Don\u2019t forget to say grace.\u201d Lucas smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re real funny, Anastas.\u201d His face falls. \u201cIt\u2019s cold!\u201d \u201cI was a little longer getting home than I expected.\u201d Marigold wrinkles her nose. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right cold.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not savages,\u201d Lucas mutters. \u201cI\u2019ll heat it. You better set the table.\u201d \u201cThat might be our cue to go,\u201d Cain whispers. We wish Marigold good night and call a tentative farewell to Lucas as he bustles in the kitchen. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to stay for something to eat?\u201d Marigold asks. \u201cWe\u2019ve barely finished dinner,\u201d Cain reminds her. He lowers his voice. \u201cUnless you\u2019re fixing to tell us that Lucas is dangerous\u2014which I could believe\u2014we\u2019d better go.\u201d Marigold smiles. \u201cLucas can\u2019t even dress himself\u2014he\u2019s not dangerous.\u201d We wave as we descend the stairs and set out into the evening, and for a while we stroll in silence. \u201cDid you know Marigold had a housemate?\u201d Cain asks eventually. \u201cNo, she\u2019s never mentioned him.\u201d \u201cDo you think they\u2019re\u2014\u201d \u201cOf course not.\u201d \u201cBecause she\u2019s in love with Whit?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cWhy do you think she\u2019s so hooked on Whit?\u201d I think about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Marigold said it herself, I suppose\u2014the heart wants what it wants.\u201d I shrug. \u201cAnd Whit\u2019s very boyishly charming\u2026\u201d Cain laughs softly. \u201cWas it the gender or the age aspect of boyish that made your nose wrinkle when you said it?\u201d \u201cHow could you possibly see what my nose was doing?\u201d It is dark, after all. \u201cI heard it in your voice.\u201d \u201cI really like Whit,\u201d I hedge. \u201cBut here is something very Dennis the Menace about him.\u201d \u201cWhich bugs you?\u201d \u201cNo\u2014not at all. But I\u2019m a little surprised Marigold is so attracted to it.\u201d \u201cDo you think it was a coincidence that Marigold walked into Jake\u2019s?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d Cain doesn\u2019t reply, curses, and breaks into a run as we approach the Jeep. \u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201d There\u2019s a man bent near the rear passenger-side of the jeep. He\u2019s tall, wearing a knit cap pulled down over his brow, and he reeks. Cain stops. \u201cBoo?\u201d The man straightens. \u201cI reckoned it was your car. That\u2019s Abel\u2019s jalopy, I thought.\u201d \u201cWhat are you doing here, Boo?\u201d \u201cLooks like someone stuck a knife into your tyre. A big knife. Maybe they twisted it.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, Of course Marigold would keep a naked man in her apartment! I fall more deeply in love with each chapter! The mystery benefactor at the restaurant was a master stroke. Could be they\u2019re being followed, could be nothing. It\u2019s unsettling but does not take over the narrative. The term weatherboard is an Australian one, I believe. I can\u2019t think of an American equivalent. It\u2019s not used in an American\u2019s dialogue, so you can probably get away with it, or you could just change the reference to \u201cwooden.\u201d I made face masks today. Anonymous black. I know the trend is to make some kind of statement with fabric, but I have no desire to bring attention to myself. Perhaps that\u2019s my statement. I am no one and everyone. I am no longer going to tell you to stay safe, because staying safe does not make great writing. So take risks, my friend! Yours, Leo \n Chapter Fourteen Cain moves closer to have a look at the tyre, Boo explodes, slamming Cain hard into the side of the Jeep and pinning him. I try to help, but Cain signals me to stay back. \u201cHow many times I gotta tell you, Abel, you don\u2019t approach a man from the left. Murderers jump you from the left. I won\u2019t always be around to protect you.\u201d \u201cSorry, Boo,\u201d Cain says evenly. \u201cI forgot. I was just fixing to look at the tyre.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s cut up, and if you come from the left again, you will be too, you understand?\u201d \u201cYes, I do. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u201cDo you have any money? I\u2019m hungry.\u201d \u201cLet me up.\u201d Boo backs off. Cain takes a note out of his wallet and hands it to him. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the library tomorrow, okay.\u201d \u201cOutside. I\u2019m not going into that place no more.\u201d Boo clenches the money in his fist and walks away. I stare after him, horrified and confused, before I turn my attention to Cain, who is standing with his hands in his pockets as if being attacked by a large, smelly man was the most ordinary thing in the world. \u201cGod, Cain, are you\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine. Boo has a few quirks.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a friend of yours?\u201d \u201cHe was a friend of Isaac\u2019s. I tracked him down when I came back\u2014thought he might be able to tell me something.\u201d \u201cAnd he slashed your tyre?\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t say that. But someone did.\u201d Cain removes his coat and rolls up his sleeves. \u201cWho else would slash your tyre?\u201d \u201cWho knows?\u201d He kicks the tyre and pulls a jack from the boot. \u201cDrunks, kids\u2026some moron who doesn\u2019t like Jeeps.\u201d He exhales. \u201cOr it might have been Boo. I couldn\u2019t tell you.\u201d I open the door and toss his coat and mine into the back seat so I can help, but to be honest, I\u2019m wearing a skirt so I really just stand there, holding the lug nuts he hands me, and watching in case Boo returns. I could put my coat back on since divesting myself of it serves no purpose beyond being an act of solidarity, but already embarrassed by the fact that I\u2019m not doing much of use, I tough it out. By the time the tyre\u2019s changed, Cain is warm with the exertion, and I\u2019m shivering. \u201cWhat happened to your coat?\u201d Cain asks as he returns the jack and lug wrench to the boot and wipes the grease off his hands with what appears to be an old bandana. \u201cYou look frozen.\u201d He fetches my coat from the back seat, and once I\u2019ve put it on and climbed back into the car, he places his coat over my knees. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about all that, Freddie. I\u2019m pretty sure Boo is harmless; he\u2019s just angry with me at the moment.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cHe blames me for Isaac dying.\u201d Cain rubs his jaw. \u201cHe\u2019s not\u2014Isaac used to say Boo was troubled.\u201d \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask gently. \u201cHe nearly pushed you through the door.\u201d Cain grins. \u201cGimme a break, I was letting him win.\u201d \u201cCain\u2026\u201d \u201cI really am fine, Freddie.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re meeting him at the library?\u201d Cain starts the Jeep and turns up the heat. \u201cHe sleeps near the library. I sit on the steps outside and he finds me sometimes\u2026if he\u2019s hungry, or wants to talk.\u201d \u201cWhat do you talk about?\u201d \u201cYou name it. The government agents following him, the French Mafia, the conspiracy to sedate Americans by way of subliminal messages in reality television\u2014he may be right about that one\u2014but sometimes he\u2019ll talk to me about Isaac.\u201d \u201cDo you have any idea who Isaac was before he was on the streets?\u201d Cain shakes his head. \u201cBoo says he was an important man, but what that means\u2026\u201d \u201cDoes it matter for your story?\u201d I place my hands beneath the coat on my knees. \u201cWill what Isaac was change it?\u201d \u201cNo. It won\u2019t.\u201d He smiles faintly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t about the book anymore. I do want to know more about Isaac, who might have killed him, even if it was only some other poor disturbed vagrant who wanted his coat, or his sandwich or his doorway.\u201d I take Cain\u2019s hand. It\u2019s impulsive, unthinking, but once it\u2019s done I can\u2019t really take it back. And so I just sit there holding his hand, a little shocked by what I\u2019ve done and not sure what to do next. If Cain is startled, he doesn\u2019t show it. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that in a more lucid moment, Boo might give me a clue to Isaac\u2019s past\u2026maybe his family.\u201d \u201cDid Isaac never hint at anything himself?\u201d \u201cI got the feeling that he was from Boston, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a sensible reason for that. It might simply have been that I was lost, and he knew his way around the streets here.\u201d The bang on the window jolts the both of us. It\u2019s Boo back again. He\u2019s agitated, angry. Cain winds down the window. \u201cBoo\u2014\u201d \u201cDoes she know?\u201d Boo pounds on the Jeep as he shouts into the window. \u201cDoes she know what you did? Bet you didn\u2019t tell her. Does she know what you did, Abel?\u201d \u201cBoo, calm down, man.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll do it again. He paid me to do it again\u2026and I did. Below the ribs and towards the spine.\u201d \u201cStay here,\u201d Cain says quietly as he winds up the window and moves to get out of the car. \u201cCain\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be all right\u2014I just need to calm him down. But don\u2019t get out.\u201d He opens the door, pushing Boo back as he does so, steps out, and slams the door shut behind him. Boo is still shouting and gesticulating as he follows Cain away from the car. I can see them in the headlights and though I can no longer hear what they\u2019re saying, it\u2019s clear they are arguing. Boo points at me. Cain hands him something. Boo takes it and then, without warning, he swings at Cain, catching him on the side of the head. Cain goes down. I grab my phone to call the police, and as I open my door and jump out, Boo looks up. For a moment I\u2019m sure he\u2019s about to come for me. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what he did,\u201d he says feverishly. \u201cI saw it. I couldn\u2019t stop it, but there is always a reckoning, a punishment.\u201d I step slowly towards Cain, and Boo turns and runs. \u201cCain?\u201d I kneel beside him. It\u2019s only then I see the shattered glass, and the blood on the side of Cain\u2019s head. Cain groans and touches the gash above his temple. I begin to dial for an ambulance while trying to talk to Cain. I should keep him conscious, I think. Pop culture medicine. Anyone who\u2019s ever watched television knows that keeping an injured person conscious is imperative. \u201cCain, speak to me!\u201d \u201cWho are you calling?\u201d Cain sits up slowly. He\u2019s still dazed and bleeding quite profusely. \u201cAn ambulance\u2026the police.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding!\u201d \u201cReally, Freddie, don\u2019t.\u201d He staggers to his feet. I forget phoning anybody so that I can help him. His hand is heavy on my shoulder, but he\u2019s standing. \u201cHe won\u2019t come back,\u201d Cain says as I look behind us for Boo. \u201cYou said he wasn\u2019t dangerous,\u201d I mutter as we move back to the Jeep. I manoeuvre him into the passenger seat. He protests weakly. \u201cYou\u2019re in no condition to drive.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019re some cloths in the glove box,\u201d he says, still trying to staunch the bleeding with his hand. I look. A bunch of rags he\u2019s obviously being using to work on the Jeep. \u201cYou can\u2019t use these, Cain; they\u2019re covered in grease.\u201d I rummage in my bag and find a near full purse pack of clean tissues. \u201cPull your hand away for a second?\u201d He does as I ask. The wound is about two inches long and deep enough to make me feel light-headed just looking at it. I press the wad of tissues against it and then get Cain to replace his hand and apply pressure. \u201cI think this will need stitches, Cain.\u201d He winces. \u201cI\u2019ll see a doctor in the morning.\u201d I shut the passenger door and run around the car to climb in behind the wheel. \u201cI think I should drive you to the Emergency Room, Cain.\u201d \u201cI have a first aid kit at home\u2014are you okay?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the one that\u2019s bleeding!\u201d He almost smiles. \u201cYou clearly don\u2019t like blood?\u201d \u201cNot this much blood.\u201d I reach over and secure his seat belt. \u201cI really think I should take you to the hospital.\u201d \u201cFreddie, I\u2019m not insured. Believe me, this is not serious enough to warrant going to the ER and into bankruptcy.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d The Sinclair Fellowship came with medical insurance, and so I am woefully ignorant of how the American system works, but Australian travellers have long been warned about the danger of entering the United States without insurance. I slip the Jeep into gear and close my eyes briefly to visualise driving on the opposite side of the road before pulling out. \u201cI\u2019m taking you back to the Carrington so that we can at least see how bad it is.\u201d Cain does not reply. But he is still conscious. I check. Then, and several times on the way to the Carrington. Joe looks up from his desk as we walk into the chequerboard foyer. He puts down his book and stands up. \u201cI\u2019ll call an ambulance\u2014\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s okay, Joe.\u201d I glance dubiously at Cain, who, despite the blood, seems steady on his feet. \u201cMr. McLeod insists it\u2019s not that bad.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d Joe shakes his head as he looks at Cain. \u201cYou let me know if you change your mind.\u201d Leo is leaving his apartment as I open my door. He looks startled. I mouth \u201cIt\u2019s all right\u201d before he says anything. He hesitates for a moment. I smile to reassure him without explanation, though I suppose the explanation itself is not all that reassuring. I sit Cain on a stool in the kitchen and fetch some towels to replace the tissues which have long since soaked and disintegrated. The bleeding seems to have slowed, though. I grab the first aid kit from under the sink and inspect its contents for the first time. \u201cIs there any Tylenol in there?\u201d Cain asks. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s start with that.\u201d I hand him the bottle and get him a glass of water. He puts down the towel and takes a couple of tablets while I find antiseptic and a packet of steristrips. Thankfully, there are instructions on the packet. I check the wound carefully for any remnant glass, but it seems clean. Cain tenses as I apply the antiseptic. There\u2019s a knock at the door. I answer with the intention of sending whoever it is on their way as soon as possible. It\u2019s one of the old ladies from downstairs. She\u2019s holding a doctor\u2019s bag. \u201cMrs. Weinbaum.\u201d \u201cActually it\u2019s Dr. Weinbaum\u2026but since Jerry died, I like to be Mrs. He always wanted me to be Mrs\u2026 He didn\u2019t harp on about it, but when you\u2019re married to a man for fifty-three years, you know.\u201d She smiles sadly. \u201cGladys Jackson says she saw you walking in with a gentleman who might be in need of sutures.\u201d \u201cYes\u2026but\u2026\u201d \u201cWell, lead the way; let\u2019s have a look at him.\u201d I take her into the kitchen. Cain looks at me questioningly. \u201cThis is Mrs\u2026Dr. Weinbaum.\u201d Dr. Weinbaum, as she now declares herself to be, waits expectantly until I realise she wants me to finish the introduction. \u201cThis is my friend Cain McLeod.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s have a look at you, young man.\u201d Dr. Weinbaum sidesteps me to examine both Cain and the contents of the first aid kit. \u201cYou could use steristrips,\u201d she says approvingly, \u201cbut it will heal quicker and leave less of a scar if I stitch it.\u201d She looks closely at the wound. \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to risk spoiling that face. I\u2019d better sew it.\u201d She motions towards the living room. \u201cSit in that armchair, Mr. McLeod\u2014the stool\u2019s too high. Winifred, fetch a lamp over here so I can see properly.\u201d I glance at Cain. He shrugs and does as she asks. So I fetch the lamp and plug it in near the armchair. Dr. Weinbaum pulls on a pair of latex gloves and opens a sealed packet which contains a sterile suture needle and thread. She has me hold the lamp, tells Cain not to move, and then brings the edges of the wound together and stitches it. I can see Cain\u2019s grip tighten on the arm of the chair, but otherwise you wouldn\u2019t know someone was sewing his head without anaesthetic. It all takes just a few minutes. She raises the yoghurt issue again as she ties off and snips the sutures. \u201cI was thinking, Winifred, that your problem might be lactose intolerance, in which case yoghurt would exacerbate it. Perhaps you should give it up.\u201d \u201cOkay\u2026I\u2019ll try.\u201d She removes the gloves and places them with the needle in a zip-lock bag, which she returns to her medical bag. \u201cJust take the usual precautions\u2014keep the wound clean and dry. Come and see me if there are any problems. Winifred, make him a cup of tea. Now I really must go.\u201d She waves away our thanks and is on her way with a reminder to avoid yoghurt until I know for sure about the lactose intolerance. I close the door behind her and return to Cain in the living room. I sit on the coffee table opposite him. He looks at me. \u201cI suppose you want to talk about what happened.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, Interesting thing. Generally speaking, Americans say trunk rather than boot, but it is a North Carolinian quirk to say boot as well, and since it\u2019s in the narrative, not dialogue, you could probably leave it. Why on earth is Cain not insured? Is he crazy? I know many self-employed people are not insured, but there are writers\u2019 associations and the like that offer insurance. It\u2019s possible he simply let it lapse, I suppose, or he has some preexisting condition that means they won\u2019t cover him, or he\u2019s broke. Are you trying to let the reader know he\u2019s broke? Maybe you are. I suppose he\u2019s a writer\u2026most of us are broke for large periods of our lives. That said, I do like Dr. Weinbaum, and it does make sense that a place like Carrington Square would have at least one retired doctor in residence. Certainly, Boston could use all the doctors it can get right now\u2014retired or not. We are not faring as badly as New York, but we are well up there on the pandemic league tables, and I think there is a sense of doom about the place. The schools have been closed, of course, and Copley Plaza seems to have an echo about it nowadays. Still, there\u2019s a kind of eerie beauty to abandoned streets and public places. I am writing more fluidly than ever. Perhaps my muse is fear. Yours, Leo \n Chapter Fifteen \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d I ask. Dr. Weinbaum\u2019s sutures are neat, evenly spaced on a bruised canvas. Cain\u2019s eye is beginning to blacken, and the upper arm of his shirt is torn where I presume he hit the ground. \u201cA little embarrassed, to be honest.\u201d \u201cBecause you let Boo win twice in one night?\u201d He smiles. \u201cWhat did he hit you with, Cain?\u201d \u201cHe was holding a bottle, I think.\u201d \u201cYou do realise he might have killed you?\u201d \u201cIf he had, he wouldn\u2019t have meant to, Freddie. Boo lashes out when he\u2019s frustrated or scared.\u201d \u201cWhat does he think you\u2019ve done?\u201d I ask, recalling the man\u2019s demands as to whether I knew. \u201cNothing\u2026everything.\u201d Cain flinches. \u201cI should get going.\u201d \u201cDo you have a pet?\u201d \u201cA pet?\u201d \u201cYou know\u2026a dog, a cat, an iguana\u2026\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThen no one\u2019s going to starve if you don\u2019t go home tonight. You can have my bed. I\u2019ll take the couch.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d \u201cIt is, for my peace of mind.\u201d I\u2019m trying not to bully him, but I\u2019m firm. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should drive just yet.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t turn you out of your bed.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be fine on the couch.\u201d \u201cHow about I take the couch?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re taller than me. For you, the couch won\u2019t be comfortable.\u201d I wear him down. The aftereffects of his injury are clearly worse than he\u2019s letting on, and in the end, Cain gives in. I direct him to the bedroom and make tea as instructed. It was probably not a prescription, but I prefer to be safe. If not for the transformation of one of my neighbours into Dr. Weinbaum, I might have insisted upon taking Cain to the hospital. I take the tea in to Cain. He\u2019s already under the covers, his jeans and bloody shirt folded over the end of the bed. I grab my laptop from its place by him on the bedside table. He apologises again for taking my bed and for Boo. \u201cWe probably should report this to the police.\u201d I sit on the bed as I talk to him. \u201cBoo is violent, volatile. He might hurt someone\u2026else.\u201d Cain is quiet for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll try and find him tomorrow. See if I can talk him into turning himself in. Maybe there\u2019s some kind of program he\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cFreddie,\u201d Cain reaches for my hand, \u201cwhat happened was not entirely Boo\u2019s fault. I should have known not to give him money. I should have bought him a meal, but I was with you, and I just wanted him to go away. I should have realised he\u2019d score within seconds.\u201d Cain\u2019s eyes are piercing. \u201cI know Boo. He\u2019ll go somewhere now, hide and sleep it off. I\u2019ll find him tomorrow.\u201d I sit there for a while, studying the beautiful man in my bed. I know there is something he\u2019s not telling me. I\u2019m not so dazzled by him not to recognise that. But we are all still new friends and there is probably a great deal we have not yet told each other. He sits up, leans over, and kisses me on the lips, gently. I\u2019m so surprised I stare at him mutely. I\u2019m pretty sure my mouth is hanging open. It feels like it is, but I\u2019m not yet capable of closing it. \u201cThank you for tonight,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it derailed a bit.\u201d I pull myself together. \u201cI should let you get some sleep.\u201d Cain looks unsure now. Uncertain. \u201cGod, Freddie, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d \u201cKiss me?\u201d I try not to sound too dismayed by the change of heart. \u201cTo take advantage of the situation.\u201d I smile. \u201cYou\u2019re the one with a head injury.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to kiss you since well before Boo hit me on the head.\u201d \u201cYou have?\u201d I\u2019m aware I sound like a doe-eyed teenager. I take a breath and remind myself that I\u2019m twenty-seven. \u201cI\u2019m glad. And I don\u2019t object. Far from it\u2026I\u2019m a little worried that you may be concussed.\u201d He laughs. Oh, what the hell\u2014I kiss him now. And we linger in the tingling discovery of it. And then I am staring at him again and he at me, like we\u2019re locked into each other. I break the spell, pulling away and standing up. \u201cGet some sleep, Cain. But tell me if you feel nauseous and/or if the headache gets worse or if you lose consciousness.\u201d \u201cLosing consciousness is the point of sleep, I would have thought. You still think I\u2019m concussed?\u201d \u201cI hope not.\u201d I grab my pyjamas from the dresser and pick up his shirt from the end of the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll throw this in the washing machine before the blood stains set.\u201d I write. I\u2019m not going to sleep anyway. There\u2019s too much to think about, to roll over in my mind. Working is both a distraction and a way to focus. Boo looms in my thoughts, his volatility, his anger. I remember that Cain gave him something. I wonder what\u2014more money? And what was it Boo thought I should know? And should I have kissed Cain? Eventually I allow myself to think about Cain alone. The way he laughs. The pressure of his lips against mine. And the scars on his chest and back\u2014more than the usual signs of unremarkable surgery. I had noticed them silently. I want to ask him about them, but I don\u2019t know that a kiss entitles me to his medical history. I am aware that I am falling in love with Cain McLeod. That I have been falling since that first day in the Reading Room. I cringe a little at the idea. Marigold\u2019s guileless obsession with Whit has made me a little shy of admitting to anything similar. And yet I cannot deny I am drawn to Cain, intrigued by him. Boo called him Abel\u2014knew him when he was Abel Manners. Cain killed Abel. Had Cain done that? Had he eradicated his former self? If so, why? I could understand changing Manners, but he\u2019d removed Abel too. I think about what it would be like to be called something other than Winifred\u2014being Freddie is being me\u2026 But maybe I could be someone else\u2026 I\u2019ve always like the name Madeleine\u2026perhaps I could be Madeleine\u2026 I am woken by a knock on my door. I check my watch. It\u2019s nine in the morning. My first thought is that I haven\u2019t checked on Cain. He might have died in the night, for all I know. Another knock. I stumble off the couch and answer the door in my pyjamas. There are two gentlemen outside. They wear sharp dark suits and carry briefcases. \u201cGood morning. Can I help you?\u201d \u201cAre you Winifred Kincaid?\u201d \u201cYes, I am.\u201d \u201cIs there a Mr. McLeod here?\u201d Now I\u2019m alarmed. \u201cYes. Who are you gentlemen?\u201d \u201cJarod Stills and Liam McKenny from Zackheim and Associates.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re solicitors?\u201d \u201cAttorneys. We\u2019d like to speak with Mr. McLeod if that\u2019s possible.\u201d Lawyers. Maybe they\u2019re Cain\u2019s lawyers. How else would they know he was here? \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in? I\u2019ll fetch Mr. McLeod.\u201d I bring them into the living room, snatching up the sheet and pillows from the couch as I do so and trying not to wonder what they think of it or me. I walk into the bedroom. Cain is still asleep, but breathing. I place my hand on his shoulder. \u201cCain. Wake up.\u201d He smiles when he opens his eyes. \u201cFreddie\u2026hello.\u201d \u201cThere are lawyers here to see you,\u201d I whisper. \u201cZackheim and Associates.\u201d He squints at me. \u201cLawyers?\u201d \u201cYes. They\u2019re waiting on the couch.\u201d He sits up. \u201cHow did they know I was here?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll get your shirt out of the dryer\u2026while you get the rest of yourself dressed.\u201d He nods vaguely. \u201cSure. Did you say lawyers?\u201d I run into the bathroom which houses a little built-in laundry and pull his shirt out of the dryer. He has his jeans and shoes on by the time I return. Again I notice the scars, several on his back and one beneath his ribs. \u201cThank you.\u201d He buttons and tucks in the fresh shirt, and we return to the living room. I\u2019m still in my pyjamas, but we can\u2019t leave two lawyers unattended in my living room for any longer. They stand and introduce themselves to Cain. \u201cWe have been retained by the estate of Dr. Elias Weinbaum to represent Mrs. Irma Weinbaum from time to time as the need arises,\u201d Jarod Stills informs us. I look at Cain, not sure what\u2019s going on. He seems equally bewildered. \u201cWe are given to understand that Mrs. Weinbaum was here last night. That she might have rendered certain assistance?\u201d \u201cHow did you know\u2014\u201d \u201cJoe\u2014your doorman called us this morning. Our client mentioned it to him. He understands the situation.\u201d \u201cWhat situation?\u201d I demand. \u201cDr. Weinbaum sutured a wound on Cain\u2019s brow.\u201d Wait, are these men delivering a bill for services? Liam McKenny points at the stitches. \u201cShe did that?\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d \u201cHow do you feel, Mr. McLeod?\u201d \u201cFine. What is this about, Mr. McKenny?\u201d The lawyers glance at each other. \u201cTo put it frankly, Mr. McLeod, we\u2019re here to ask you if you are going to take action, and perhaps to persuade you to deal with the matter via settlement instead.\u201d \u201cTake action? Why would I? Dr. Weinbaum helped me.\u201d Jarod Stills sighs. \u201cI\u2019m afraid, Mr. McLeod, that Irma Weinbaum is not, nor has ever been, a doctor.\u201d \u201cBut she said\u2014\u201d I begin incredulously. \u201cI\u2019m afraid our client is occasionally subject to the delusion that she is a medical practitioner. It\u2019s generally not dangerous, but she is neither trained nor qualified to be suturing anyone.\u201d \u201cI see.\u201d \u201cOur client will, of course, bear the expense of any and all remedial medical work required as a result of her well-meaning but misguided intervention.\u201d Cain turns to me, his eyes wide. \u201cRemedial? What exactly has she done to me?\u201d I can feel my mouth twitch. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you. You\u2019re hideous!\u201d \u201cI wondered why you covered up all the mirrors.\u201d He cackles in a terrible impersonation of Jack Nicholson\u2019s Joker. I get the giggles. The lawyers seem confounded, and to be honest I can\u2019t blame them. We should be appalled. McKenny clears his throat. He pulls some papers from his briefcase and pushes them across the coffee table to Cain. Cain scans the document. I read over his shoulder. It\u2019s a legal waiver that precludes Cain McLeod from taking any further action again Mrs. Irma Weinbaum in respect of anything she might have or might not have done on the named date. Stills pushes over a business card. Dr. Lemarr. A downtown address and a phone number. \u201cAs I said, all your medical expenses will be met by our client, including any cosmetic procedures which may be required. We are further authorised to offer you the sum of\u2014\u201d \u201cDo you have a pen, Mr. McKenny?\u201d Cain puts the documents down on the coffee table. McKenny obliges. Cain signs. \u201cWherever your client learned her needlework skills, she did employ them in my aid. I have no intention of pursuing her on that count.\u201d McKenny nods happily, but Stills is at pains to point out, \u201cMrs. Weinbaum has no medical training, sir. In fact, I doubt very much that our client has ever even had cause to darn a sock.\u201d McKenny casts a dark look in his colleague\u2019s direction and takes the documents in case Cain should change his mind. \u201cI\u2019ll keep Dr. Lemarr\u2019s card in case my head becomes septic,\u201d Cain concedes. \u201cBut I think I\u2019m okay.\u201d He pauses. \u201cWould you mind telling me where Mrs. Weinbaum acquired her doctor\u2019s bag\u2026the needle and suture thread\u2026 It was suture thread, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Jarod Stills\u2019 eyes go to the stitches before he confirms, \u201cYes. She acquired the items on eBay, I believe.\u201d Cain begins to laugh. McKenny grins now, but Stills remains appropriately concerned. \u201cWe will all feel better if you would allow Dr. Lemarr to check you over, Mr. McLeod, whether or not your head becomes septic.\u201d \u201cRest assured, Mr. Stills. The stitches will have to come out at some point, and since I presume you won\u2019t be allowing Mrs. Weinbaum to make house calls again, I will need to see Dr. Lemarr for that purpose.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve been very understanding, Mr. McLeod,\u201d McKenny cuts in before Stills can advise further caution. Cain takes advantage of the goodwill. \u201cCan I ask you, Mr. McKenny, are Mrs. Weinbaum\u2019s delusions only about being a doctor?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean?\u201d \u201cDoes she ever become a lawyer, for example?\u201d \u201cOccasionally she imagines she is a plumber.\u201d \u201cAnd does she have plumbers\u2019 tools as well?\u201d \u201cShe does.\u201d \u201cA plunger? A wrench?\u201d \u201cAnd various brushes, clamps, and washers.\u201d Cain nods thoughtfully. \u201cAnd people allow her to come in and fix their pipes?\u201d \u201cLess often than they allow her to conduct medical procedures.\u201d McKenny glances at Stills, who is obviously unhappy by his lack of discretion with respect to Mrs. Weinbaum. \u201cCan I ask why you wish to know, Mr. McLeod?\u201d \u201cProfessional interest.\u201d \u201cYou are a psychologist?\u201d \u201cA writer.\u201d Both lawyers react, tensing immediately. \u201cThere is a confidentiality clause in that document you just signed, Mr. McLeod.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a novelist, Mr. Stills, not a reporter. Your confidentiality clause does not preclude me using your client as inspiration.\u201d *** My dear Hannah, It\u2019s like an old-fashioned melodrama! I want to shout at Freddie\u2014look behind you! The villain\u2019s in your bed! As for Mrs. Weinbaum\u2014I love it! I really want her to attempt an appendectomy! I took myself to a dive bar last night, to absorb the atmosphere while I wrote. Made me feel like Hemingway. Ordered a mojito and took a seat at the bar. It was, to be honest, a little more divey than I had anticipated. There was a fight during which one thug hit another thug over the head with a beer bottle\u2014knocked him unconscious and then left. The barman called an ambulance and the other patrons just kept on drinking. Some of them had masks\u2014they were wearing them like bandanas around their necks and foreheads. Anyway, I took a couple of photos of the unconscious guy\u2019s head, in case you wanted to describe Cain\u2019s wound in more detail. There were bits of glass embedded in the wound\u2026I don\u2019t think you mentioned that in your description. The shards caught the light and glinted in the blood. In case it isn\u2019t obvious, I\u2019m really enjoying watching this story unfold, and maybe helping just a little. Yours, Leo \n Chapter Sixteen \u201cI saw her first! In fact, I\u2019ve known her for weeks!\u201d \u201cIf I recall accurately, it was my head she stitched. I think that gives me a prior claim.\u201d \u201cRubbish!\u201d I count off my points. \u201cI let her in, the procedure was conducted in my living room, and I held the lamp! You just sat there.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Cain agrees. \u201cI am her victim. Victims have rights.\u201d We continue to bicker over which of us gets to write Mrs. Weinbaum into our work, while we make toast and coffee. \u201cHow are you, really?\u201d I ask as he spreads peanut butter on his toast. \u201cFine. It hurts a bit if I frown, but otherwise I barely feel it at all.\u201d Another knock on the door. \u201cWhat now?\u201d Cain sips his coffee. \u201cMrs. Weinbaum to fix that dripping tap?\u201d More knocking. Then Marigold\u2019s voice. \u201cFreddie\u2026Cain! It\u2019s me!\u201d I let her in. \u201cHello. I thought that was Cain\u2019s Jeep outside\u2026Christ on a bike!\u201d Marigold catches sight of Cain. I offer her a cup of coffee. She sits down opposite Cain and scrutinises his face. \u201cFuck. What happened?\u201d \u201cI got hit in the head with a bottle. One of Freddie\u2019s neighbours put in the stitches.\u201d \u201cWho hit you?\u201d \u201cSomeone I once knew. He was bearing a grudge.\u201d \u201cDid you call the police?\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t yet.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cNot really sure.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s probably best not to\u2026with the FBI looking into you.\u201d I hand Marigold a cup of coffee and a plate of toast. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She looks me up and down and smiles. \u201cAm I interrupting something?\u201d \u201cI slept late,\u201d I murmur. Marigold grins. Cain stands. \u201cI\u2019d better get going.\u201d He takes his car keys from where I left them last night on the kitchen bench and smiles at me. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re satisfied that I\u2019m not concussed, of course.\u201d \u201cYou seem well enough, but then, I\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d \u201cNo, there\u2019s a bit of that going around.\u201d I grin, and Marigold demands to know what we\u2019re talking about. \u201cYou tell her.\u201d Cain rubs my arm. A warmth that might be more than friendly. Or perhaps he\u2019s still hoping I\u2019ll give him Mrs. Weinbaum. \u201cI had better go.\u201d \u201cSo?\u201d Marigold asks once he\u2019s gone. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I hesitate, unsure as to what I have permission to tell. I start with the slashed tyre and tell Marigold about Boo, his accusations, and what he did. Marigold listens agape. \u201cJesus Hopping Christ! You got out of the car? Are you out of your mind?\u201d \u201cCain was on the ground. What else could I do?\u201d \u201cYou could have screamed! Why didn\u2019t you scream?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I wonder about that for the first time. Why didn\u2019t I scream? \u201cI don\u2019t scream,\u201d I say in the end. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t remember ever screaming. It\u2019s just not something I do.\u201d Marigold is interested in that. \u201cNever?\u201d \u201cThat I can remember.\u201d \u201cI scream all the time\u2026when I\u2019m scared, or happy or frustrated.\u201d I clear my throat and test my vocal cords. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I know how.\u201d \u201cI can give you lessons,\u201d Marigold assures me. I laugh. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s an education I require.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean? Of course it is!\u201d Marigold is aghast at my suggestion. \u201cA scream is the most human and primal of things, a siren call which binds all those in hearing to help, as it did us to each other and to Caroline.\u201d I stop laughing and smile at the poetry in Marigold\u2019s conviction. Her need to link us all by a greater power and cause, to somehow believe that our coming together was more than mere coincidence. I am the writer, but it is she who seeks theme and motif in life, and I am captivated by the earnestness with which she regards the world. \u201cYou\u2019re right. But perhaps we could conduct lessons somewhere more soundproof than here.\u201d Marigold\u2019s smile is guileless and beautiful. \u201cSo\u2026you and Cain?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t let him drive home with a head injury, Marigold. I was worried that he might have been concussed. It seemed easier for him to stay here, to make sure.\u201d She nods. \u201cI\u2019m glad you took him to a doctor at least.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t, exactly.\u201d I tell her about Mrs. Weinbaum and her ministrations and the gentlemen of Zackheim and Associates. \u201cJesus H! I take my eyes off you two for a moment\u2026\u201d She becomes serious again. \u201cYou know, I did some research on Isaac Harmon.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cLast night, online. You can find out quite a lot if you know how to look.\u201d \u201cMarigold, I think Cain would prefer if we\u2014\u201d \u201cIsaac Harmon was wanted for murder.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d \u201cIsaac Harmon was wanted for the murder of a young woman in Virginia about twenty years ago. He disappeared before the police could apprehend him and remained on America\u2019s most wanted list until the body of a homeless man found on the banks of the Charles River was identified as him.\u201d \u201cYou found this online?\u201d \u201cRelatively easily.\u201d \u201cSo Cain probably already knows this.\u201d \u201cHe has to.\u201d \u201cGood.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cThen we don\u2019t need to tell him.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t you think it odd he didn\u2019t tell us?\u201d I pour another cup of coffee. \u201cHe did tell us most of it. And being wanted for murder doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re guilty.\u201d Marigold is already following another thread. \u201cPerhaps his man Boo killed Isaac Harmon. Oh, fuck! Maybe he\u2019s come back for Cain. Does he know where Cain lives?\u201d \u201cNot as far as I know.\u201d I\u2019m uneasy now. Cain was going to try to find Boo. I pick up my phone to call Cain, but I stop before I dial. What would I tell him that he doesn\u2019t know already? How could I call and suggest that Boo might have killed Isaac Harmon and was now after him? It would sound absurd. It was absurd. I breathe and caution myself against being caught up in Marigold\u2019s enthusiasms. Nothing she says is untrue or impossible, but still, she has a way of igniting into action without pause, of taking the wheel of the bus and slamming the accelerator to the floor. I text Cain instead: Be careful. The answer is almost immediate: Always. And I decide that\u2019s enough. I shower and change while Marigold cleans up my kitchen. She shouts conversation at me from the other room\u2014general observations about current affairs, things she\u2019s read about Australia, the latest gaffes of the American president. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s too early to see if Whit wants to have lunch?\u201d she says as I pull on my socks. \u201cHe\u2019s been recuperating at home for three days now.\u201d \u201cWould you like me to call him and ask?\u201d \u201cWould you?\u201d We\u2019re still in different rooms, so I smile without fear of offending her. Marigold is no poker player. The relief and elation in her voice are obvious. \u201cI\u2019d ring myself, but you know, I don\u2019t want Whit to think\u2026\u201d \u201cNo, it would be terrible if Whit were to think.\u201d Marigold looks at me hopefully, pleadingly. \u201cShall we make it a spur-of-the-moment invitation?\u201d I walk back into the kitchen, looking for my yellow scarf. It\u2019s on top of the refrigerator. \u201cWe could find somewhere and call from there.\u201d \u201cDo you think we should?\u201d \u201cIt might seem less orchestrated. And if he can\u2019t come, the two of us can still have lunch.\u201d Marigold nods. \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cHave you tried calling him?\u201d I ask. \u201cA few times. His mother answered the first time. She said he was resting. After that I couldn\u2019t get through\u2026 The service was unavailable.\u201d I say nothing. We both know it means her number was blocked. I hope it was by Whit\u2019s mother. \u201cLet\u2019s find somewhere close to Whit\u2019s place, so he can sneak out easily. What\u2019s his address?\u201d I type it in and use an app to find restaurants nearby. \u201cThis place sounds good\u2026 It\u2019s called Oh My Cod! and it\u2019s only a few hundred yards from Whit\u2019s gate.\u201d We decide to walk to the restaurant in preparation for an indulgent lunch, whether or not Whit joins us. On the way we discuss whether Oh My Cod! is a play on piety or pleasure. When we arrive, the decor speaks to the latter. The restaurant is fitted out like a luxurious bordello\u2014each table sits between chaise lounges and is curtained into privacy with fringed velvet drapery. The candelabras feature entwined people with their backs arched in ecstasy, and the menu is titled \u201cSelection de Aphrodisiac.\u201d I get the giggles. Marigold too. Thank goodness for the chaises and the curtains, because in the end we are rolling round cackling like children. Perhaps this is not an unusual reaction, because the waiters allow us to get over the worst of it before peeking through the curtain to take our drink orders. We both request Virgin Ambrosias. \u201cChrist!\u201d Marigold whispers when the curtain closes behind the leather-clad waiter. \u201cWe\u2019re asking Whit to have lunch with us in the sex shop!\u201d \u201cAre you sure we should still\u2026\u201d \u201cYes. We can\u2019t chicken out now.\u201d I call Whit\u2019s number. He answers. \u201cFreddie! I was beginning to think you guys had forgotten about me.\u201d I issue the invitation and tell him where we are. He obviously knows the place, because he laughs loud and long. \u201cStop it\u2014you\u2019ll burst another stitch,\u201d I warn, concerned that he might indeed. \u201cCan you come?\u201d He breaks up again and I flinch as I realise what I just said. \u201cI\u2019ll be about twenty minutes,\u201d he promises. We drink our Virgins and amuse ourselves by reading out items from the menu. It\u2019s silly, but there is a relief in the juvenile nonsense of it. A comfort in childish things. When Whit comes through the curtain, he regards us, amused. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to ask for your table\u2026I merely followed the screeching.\u201d \u201cWhit!\u201d Marigold stands up. \u201cHow are you? We\u2019ve been so worried about you.\u201d \u201cI could hear you worrying.\u201d Taking a seat beside Marigold, he summons a waiter and orders a Forbidden Apple without so much as looking at the drinks menu. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here before,\u201d I accuse. \u201cOf course I have. All the cool kids used to come here once. They have a great baked cod with pepper sauce\u2026it\u2019s called a Multiple Orgasm. You should try it.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI\u2019m a vegetarian.\u201d Marigold finds that hysterical. Somehow we manage to order from the ridiculous menu and sit eating surprisingly decent food within our velvet enclave. Whit complains about his mother, the lockdown she\u2019s instigated. \u201cShe\u2019s personally\u2014no, professionally\u2014offended by whoever stabbed me. You\u2019d think she lost a case or something.\u201d \u201cShe nearly lost a son,\u201d I remind him. \u201cCut her a bit of slack.\u201d \u201cMom\u2019s in court today. She delegated my incarceration to my dad, who is rather more reasonable\u2026and he might be a bit drunk.\u201d Marigold raises her glass. \u201cTo your dad!\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s Cain?\u201d Whit clinks his glass against Marigold\u2019s. \u201cDid he turn up his nose at this fine establishment?\u201d Marigold tells him about the previous evening\u2019s events as I had told them to her. Whit is shocked, perhaps excessively so for someone who had himself been stabbed. \u201cGet outta town! Who is this guy? Did you say his name was Boo?\u201d \u201cCain called him Boo,\u201d I say. \u201cI assume it\u2019s a nickname of some sort.\u201d \u201cAnd he just walked up and hit Cain on the head with a bottle.\u201d \u201cNot initially. He came back. Cain tried to talk to him and Boo hit him.\u201d \u201cAnd then what did he do?\u201d \u201cBoo or Cain? Boo ran away\u2026\u201d \u201cSo now Cain\u2019s trying to find him? Man!\u201d Whit shakes his head. \u201cIs he trying to get himself killed?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the half of it!\u201d Marigold pipes in now with what she\u2019s discovered online about Isaac Harmon. \u201cHe was a murderer?\u201d Whit\u2019s brow rises. \u201cAnd Cain knew this?\u201d \u201cHe was wanted for murder. It\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d The conversation makes me feel vaguely disloyal. \u201cI doubt Cain knew when he first met him\u2014how would he?\u201d \u201cBut he\u2019d know now?\u201d \u201cUnless his research skills aren\u2019t as good as Marigold\u2019s.\u201d \u201cThey probably aren\u2019t.\u201d Marigold is reflective rather than arrogant. \u201cBut he would have found this.\u201d \u201cMaybe we should find Cain,\u201d Whit suggests. \u201cIt sounds like he could be in trouble.\u201d \u201cIn trouble?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s hanging out with junkies and\u2014\u201d \u201cHold on a minute.\u201d I stop Whit before he gets too far ahead of himself. \u201cCain\u2019s not hanging out with them\u2026and even if he was, he\u2019s not a child.\u201d \u201cBut he clearly\u2014\u201d His eyes widen suddenly and he chokes. Marigold pours him a glass of water. \u201cWhit? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d He looks stricken. I stand ready to call for help. Whit pats his chest and clears his throat. \u201cI nearly said Cain doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him. I have officially become my mom. I\u2019d better have a drink.\u201d He summons a waiter and orders something called Carnal Knowledge with a wedge of lime. \u201cAren\u2019t you even a little bit worried about Cain?\u201d Marigold asks me as Whit treats the momentary possession by his mother with alcohol. I am. I have been since he left to find Boo. Worried that he might find him still high or deranged or both. Worried that perhaps we should have taken the advice of Mrs. Weinbaum\u2019s lawyer more seriously. But short of calling the police, there isn\u2019t a lot any of us can do. \u201cFreddie?\u201d \u201cNo. I\u2019m not worried.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, I love that Marigold checks out whose car is parked out front. I do that. So many people nowadays pretend they aren\u2019t in. I dearly wish that Oh My Cod! was not a product of your imagination. I would dine there tonight! In fact, once this book becomes a bestseller, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone opens a restaurant along those lines! I haven\u2019t quite decided if Whit is a player or a complete nerd. He does have mommy issues, though to be fair his mother does seem to be some kind of dragon. And though he doesn\u2019t appear to be coming on to either Marigold or Freddie, there\u2019s a kind of sexual confidence about him that makes me wonder. I\u2019ve attached a map of downtown Boston and the surrounding areas, where I\u2019ve marked alleys and places hidden from passing view in which one might kill someone without risk of witnesses. I thought since Cain is \u201cat large\u201d this might be a good time for another body to be found. I have finally been able to bring myself to look at the opus again without heartbreak. And I can see places where I might have pulled my punches, and bits that could be cut. Should be cut. It may be time to sharpen my knife again. Yours, Leo \n Chapter Seventeen Cain calls in the evening. He sounds tired. I don\u2019t know how I sound, but I am relieved. \u201cWhere are you? Are you all right?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026 Mrs. Weinbaum\u2019s needlework held.\u201d \u201cYou probably should have yourself checked anyway.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll see her doctor when I have the stitches out.\u201d \u201cHave you eaten?\u201d I glance at my watch. It\u2019s only half past seven. \u201cDo you want to come over? I could cook something\u2026I think\u2026\u201d I survey my pantry for anything which could become a meal. \u201cI\u2019d love to, Freddie, but I\u2019ve got a bit of work to do\u2026and I\u2019m beat. Rain check?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d I\u2019m both disappointed and mildly relieved that I don\u2019t have to make good on my offer to cook. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d \u201cYes. Just frustrated. I couldn\u2019t find Boo. He\u2019s made himself scarce\u2014probably thinks I\u2019m looking for him to get even.\u201d \u201cDoes he have anyone else he can go to for help?\u201d \u201cNot that I know of.\u201d \u201cCain\u2026\u201d I broach the subject hesitantly. \u201cMarigold did some research on Isaac Harmon.\u201d \u201cDid she?\u201d Immediately his voice is hard. I\u2019m unsure now if I should have brought this up. But it\u2019s too late. \u201cShe found out that Isaac Harmon was wanted for murder in Virginia.\u201d Silence. \u201cLook, Cain, I know you probably already know. I just thought you should know that we do.\u201d I can hear him exhale. \u201cYes, I knew. The police told me after he died.\u201d \u201cI absolutely understand that this is none of our business, Cain. But you know Marigold\u2014she really wants to help. She doesn\u2019t mean any harm.\u201d \u201cYes, I know.\u201d His voice is still tense. \u201cWhat else did Nancy Drew find out?\u201d \u201cNothing really. She speculates that Boo might have killed Isaac and come back for you.\u201d Cain laughs now. It sounds different from the one I\u2019ve come to know. Cut bitter with regret. \u201cBoo was Isaac\u2019s best friend. He would never have hurt him. And I went looking for him\u2014not the other way round.\u201d I don\u2019t argue. \u201cMarigold wants to help, Cain. I guess after seeing you this morning\u2014\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d His voice relaxes. \u201cI\u2019m only surprised Marigold didn\u2019t conclude I\u2019d crossed the mob.\u201d \u201cWell, she hasn\u2019t yet.\u201d His laugh is more recognisable now. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was snappy, Freddie. It must seem weird that I didn\u2019t mention that the hero of my story was wanted for murder.\u201d I don\u2019t actually think it\u2019s weird at all. But I don\u2019t get a chance to say that before he continues. \u201cI never believed he was guilty, so it didn\u2019t seem like I was leaving out anything important.\u201d \u201cCain, you don\u2019t owe any of us the details of your life or Isaac\u2019s.\u201d \u201cI know\u2026 I want you to understand that I\u2019m not trying to mislead you.\u201d \u201cYou haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d \u201cI left the past behind a while ago.\u201d \u201cCan you do that?\u201d \u201cApparently not. I was probably tempting fate writing about Isaac.\u201d \u201cThe good news is we all have pasts.\u201d Two days later the body of Shaun Jacobs, sometimes known as Boo, is found on the banks of the Charles River. His throat had been cut. I read about it in the Boston Globe on a Thursday morning. I call Cain\u2019s number with my eyes still glued to the article. He doesn\u2019t pick up, and I leave a message. \u201cCain, I\u2019ve just read the paper. Are you okay? Call me, please.\u201d I read the article again, not sure quite what to do or to think. I\u2019m horrified and strangely grieved for this man I encountered only fleetingly. And for some reason I can\u2019t explain, I\u2019m in tears. The picture printed with the article is a mug shot, apparently taken a couple of years before when he was picked up for a misdemeanour of some sort. The man who stood by Cain\u2019s Jeep, shouting, accusing, stares out at me from the paper with that same wide-eyed confusion. And I wonder if that is how he died\u2014in bewilderment with the world, confused by its violence and his own. I try Cain again, and this time there are tears in my message. \u201cPlease call me, Cain. I really need to talk to you.\u201d There\u2019s a knock at my door. I answer it hoping to see Cain\u2014perhaps he thought to come to me before I even called. It\u2019s Leo. \u201cFreddie? Is this a bad time?\u201d I wipe my sleeve across my face. \u201cNo\u2026not at all.\u201d \u201cYou look upset. Does it have anything to do with the bleeding man you were with a couple of days ago?\u201d I step aside and sweep my arm into the apartment. \u201cCome in. Would you like a cup of coffee?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d I pour him a cup from the pot already made, and another for myself. I had been meaning to explain about that night, but somehow the last few days have slipped away. I\u2019ve been working intensely on the manuscript and have seen no one but Marigold, who finds a reason to drop by each day. Over coffee and the last of the fancy chocolates that came in the gourmet hamper, I tell him that Cain had been hit on the head with a bottle on the night Leo saw us at my door. \u201cDang! Was it a bar fight? Why didn\u2019t you take him to the hospital?\u201d \u201cNo. It wasn\u2019t a bar fight. And Cain didn\u2019t want to go to the emergency room. Mrs. Weinbaum patched him up.\u201d Leo smiles. \u201cDid she tell you she was a doctor?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cShe isn\u2019t, you know.\u201d \u201cI do now. How did you\u2026?\u201d \u201cThe first week I was here, I tried to pet a squirrel. It bit me. Mrs. Weinbaum treated the wound and made sure it didn\u2019t give me rabies or plague or whatever it is that squirrels carry these days. The next morning I get a visit from her lawyers, who make a contribution towards my student loans.\u201d \u201cShe did suture Cain\u2019s head very well,\u201d I offer. \u201cAnd I have neither rabies nor the plague.\u201d He helps himself from the plate of cookies I\u2019ve placed between us. \u201cSo since your buddy Cain has not died of septic shock, why were you crying?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just feeling a little homesick today.\u201d It\u2019s not a complete lie. With Thanksgiving coming up it makes me very aware that I am here and not at home. Not that Thanksgiving means anything in Australia, but the gathering of clans here does make me feel the absence of my own. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do?\u201d His concern makes me feel guilty that I am at least inflating my homesickness. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s nice to have a neighbour to have coffee with.\u201d He glances at the Globe I\u2019ve left on the bench. \u201cDid you read about that poor guy they found by the river? I jog past there every morning. I wondered what was going on.\u201d \u201cYou saw him?\u201d \u201cNo, ma\u2019am. I would have had no cause to wonder if I\u2019d actually seen a body. I only saw police, crime scene tape, reporters\u2014I assumed it was more than a cat up a tree, but I didn\u2019t know for sure until I read the paper.\u201d \u201cHave you ever seen him on another morning?\u201d I push the Globe towards him. Leo looks closely at the mug shot. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine there are many places to sleep on the riverbank in winter\u2014mostly I see other joggers or people walking their dogs. He doesn\u2019t look familiar.\u201d He looks at me sharply. \u201cDo you know him?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I reply perhaps a half beat too quickly. \u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t. Sorry\u2014stupid question.\u201d I laugh. \u201cI pretty much asked it first.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to drive up to Rockport this weekend. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d like to come?\u201d \u201cRockport?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about an hour\u2019s drive,\u201d he says apologetically. \u201cThat\u2019s not really an issue for an Australian,\u201d I assure him. \u201cEverything at home seems to be at least an hour away. But why are you going?\u201d \u201cResearch. I\u2019m setting a scene outside its famous fish shack\u2014thought I should check it out myself so I get the details right. Authenticity and all that.\u201d Leo picks through the chocolates. \u201cI\u2019ve organised a car for the purpose. I thought I\u2019d ask all the other residential fellows if they\u2019d like to come, do a bit of sightseeing\u2026so I can add collegiate collaboration to my acquittal report.\u201d I laugh. Leo is ever strategic. \u201cI thought you and I were the only fellows here.\u201d \u201cNo, there are two others. From Europe and Africa.\u201d I\u2019m embarrassed that I don\u2019t know that, that I\u2019ve been here for two months and not come across my counterparts. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll come. A road trip to see a fish shack in the winter is too absurd to turn down.\u201d Leo nods. \u201cIt\u2019s a date, then.\u201d \u201cLeo, where exactly did you come across the crime scene?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2014oh, you mean this?\u201d He picks up the paper. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d \u201cBecause I walk along the river all the time. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t walk past somewhere where a man died without knowing or thinking about it.\u201d Leo pulls up a map on his phone and points to a place on the bank in Cambridge. \u201cI expect it will be cordoned off for a while, so I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to walk past it without knowing for the next few days, at least.\u201d He squints at me thoughtfully. \u201cI could show you.\u201d \u201cNow?\u201d \u201cSure. If you\u2019d like to stretch your legs. It\u2019s a couple of miles from here.\u201d For some reason I say yes. I\u2019m not sure why. Perhaps it\u2019s a need to orient myself in what is occurring, to slap myself with the reality of it, and accept that it is really happening. Caroline, then Whit, and now this. Could it be that they are unconnected\u2014random acts which have nothing to do with each other or me? I want them to be that, an accidental confluence in a dangerous city, because the alternative is terrifying. I set out with Leo, who, though he has been in Boston only as long as I, has learned the city by jogging it. We cross the river at Harvard Bridge and walk through the parklands of Magazine Beach. Even now, closer to the middle of the day, there are joggers and people using the outdoor gym. The park is beautiful, though the best of the fall has long passed. Defoliated trees are a quiet, stark backdrop to the focussed activity of exercise. Near the boathouse, police officers move on the curious from a section of the beach which has been sectioned off with police tape. A young woman with a camera waves at Leo and beckons him over. I hang back, taking in the area as he runs over to talk to her. They chat for a minute or two, and then she returns to taking photographs, and he to me. \u201cLauren\u2019s with the Rag,\u201d he says by way of explanation. \u201cThis is her current assignment apparently.\u201d \u201cCaroline Palfrey worked for the Rag,\u201d I say, distracted momentarily by the fact. \u201cWhen I was here this morning there was a kind of a tent over there\u2026over the body, maybe.\u201d Leo points. \u201cI expect he was either trying to sleep in the boathouse or his body was washed up on the beach here after being dumped upstream.\u201d He turns to look at me. \u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t know him, Freddie?\u201d \u201cI ran into him once,\u201d I admit. \u201cRan into?\u201d \u201cI was with someone who knew him, who talked to him.\u201d Leo studies me. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean the night I saw you with Cain. God, Freddie, was it the dead guy that hit Cain with a bottle?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014I think he was high.\u201d \u201cHave you told the police?\u201d \u201cNo\u2014Cain didn\u2019t want to have him arrested,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mean then\u2026I mean now. The man was murdered, Freddie. They\u2019re probably trying to retrace his last hours.\u201d I know he\u2019s right. I should call the police and tell them. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting until I can get hold of Cain so that we can go in together. He\u2019ll be able to tell them more than I will.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t get hold of Cain?\u201d Leo frowns. \u201cHe didn\u2019t pick up when I called this morning, that\u2019s all,\u201d I reply firmly. \u201cHe probably turned his phone off so he could get some work done.\u201d Leo shrugs. \u201cOr he\u2019s already talking to the police.\u201d \u201cIn which case, I suppose the police will get in touch with me.\u201d Leo pauses. \u201cFair enough.\u201d He motions me towards a pretzel cart. \u201cLet\u2019s get some supplies for the walk home.\u201d We purchase warm pretzels drizzled with mustard, which we eat on the way back to Carrington Square. \u201cIf you do decide you want to go into the police station,\u201d he says almost shyly as he drops me outside my door, \u201cI\u2019d be happy to come with you\u2026for moral support or as a character witness\u2026or whatever you need.\u201d I dust the pretzel crumbs off my lapel. \u201cThank you, Leo. I\u2019m sure it will be fine, though. I\u2019ll find out what Cain\u2019s doing or what he\u2019s done and then do my bit. I\u2019m sure Boo talked to dozens of people in the couple of days before he died.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, I sense my Marigold is in danger. Killing her would certainly enhance the sense of tragedy and tension, but it does run the risk of feeding into the clich\u00e9 that the quirky best friend is there to be killed off. If you are going to take her (and I will mourn that), make sure you don\u2019t waste the opportunity to tear the reader apart with the horror of it. Marigold should not go quietly. For example, Cain might violate her sexually. It\u2019ll be a poignant contrast to the gallant manner in which he is dealing with Freddie. Marigold\u2019s death scene should be brutal and extended, she should fight, and do her own damage before she goes. Cain should not be able to snuff out her life unscathed, as he did Caroline\u2019s. But what am I writing?\u2014I forget the master to whom I speak. You will write a death scene that is worthy of her, I know. I went down to Magazine Beach to take some photos for you, in case you want to describe the crime scene in more detail. Coincidentally, there was a man passed out on the bank. I took a picture of that too in case it helps you visualize the scene. Of course this man wasn\u2019t dead, merely sleeping off whatever he\u2019d been taking. He might have died of hypothermia since, of course. Must say I love the way you are underplaying Cain\u2019s fury. There\u2019s a visceral restraint about the man that is so exciting! Yours, Leo \n Chapter Eighteen Marigold and Whit arrive about half an hour before the police. Marigold\u2019s eyes are bright and excited. She has the paper. \u201cThis is your Boo, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She points to the article. \u201cThis is the guy who attacked Cain.\u201d I nod. Whit puts his arm around me. \u201cYou okay? It must be a bit unsettling.\u201d \u201cIt is.\u201d \u201cWhat does Cain say about it?\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to reach him.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Marigold\u2019s brow furrows. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say he was looking for this dead guy? You don\u2019t think\u2026maybe we should try to find him?\u201d I stay outwardly calm. \u201cI think we should at least give Cain a chance to answer his phone before we panic.\u201d \u201cHow long\u2019s it been?\u201d Whit asks. \u201cA couple of hours since I left my last message.\u201d \u201cDo you know where Cain lives?\u201d \u201cIn Roxbury somewhere. I\u2019m not sure exactly.\u201d The internal phone from the doorman\u2019s desk buzzes. I pick it up, and Joe informs me that two detectives are asking for me. \u201cI\u2019ll come down.\u201d I shudder to imagine what the other residents of the Carrington will think about a police visit. I expect they\u2019re here to verify Cain\u2019s story about the other night, and I\u2019m relieved that he\u2019s not missing, though a little hurt that he didn\u2019t call me before he went in. I tell Whit and Marigold to make themselves comfortable. \u201cI should be only a couple of minutes.\u201d Whit already has his head in my refrigerator. \u201cAsk them what they did with Cain.\u201d \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to come down with you?\u201d Marigold follows me to the door. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re allowed to bring friends to a police interview.\u201d \u201cWhat about Whit\u2014he\u2019s Harvard Law.\u201d Whit sticks his head up over my refrigerator door to indicate he\u2019s willing. \u201cIt\u2019s a few routine questions, Marigold. If I start bringing lawyers\u2014or law students\u2014I\u2019ll look suspicious or at least ridiculous.\u201d Marigold pulls a face. \u201cFine, but if you\u2019re not back in fifteen, we\u2019re coming down.\u201d The detectives are standing by Joe\u2019s desk when I arrive in the foyer. They begin by flashing their badges, introducing themselves as Detectives David Walker and Justine Dwyer. Walker is about fifty, buzz-cut grey hair, tall, broad, and bearded. Even in plainclothes he looks like he\u2019s wearing a uniform. His partner is a brunette, and there\u2019s an edge of style to the practicality of her pantsuit and low-heeled shoes. She smiles when she says hello, and I can feel the knot in the pit of my stomach loosen a little. They are, as I suspected, here to ask me about the night Cain and I encountered Shaun Jacobs. I confirm locations and times, that I saw Boo attack Cain, and that Cain did not retaliate. I worry that they\u2019ll ask who treated Cain\u2019s wound, which will mean trouble for Mrs. Weinbaum, but they do not. They ask how long I\u2019ve known Cain and the nature of our relationship. \u201cI met Cain about a month ago at the library. We\u2019re friends.\u201d \u201cAnd you were with Mr. McLeod until what time, Ms. Kincaid?\u201d \u201cHe left at about half past ten the next morning.\u201d I glance at Walker and read what he thinks in his face. \u201cI didn\u2019t want Cain to drive while there was a chance he might be concussed, so he stayed here the night. I slept on the couch.\u201d Detective Dwyer nods. \u201cA sensible precaution.\u201d \u201cMr. McLeod is a lucky man to have such thoughtful friends,\u201d Walker says tersely. \u201cIsn\u2019t he?\u201d I\u2019m annoyed. Walker\u2019s smile is not quite hidden by his facial hair. \u201cI mean, there are not many folks who\u2019d be comfortable having a man like Cain McLeod spending the night, whether or not he was concussed.\u201d I assume he\u2019s trying to goad me, so I don\u2019t give him the satisfaction of a response. Walker continues. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve only known him a month, and the man did serve seven years.\u201d \u201cServe?\u201d I\u2019m confused now. Dwyer glances sideways at her partner. I know they are noting my reaction. \u201cCain McLeod served seven years for murder.\u201d I feel cold inside, and hot and flushed at the same time. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d It\u2019s a ridiculous question to ask of the police, and I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019m asking anything. It\u2019s more an expression of shock and disbelief. And then I remember that Cain changed his name. Perhaps this is some kind of misunderstanding. \u201cYou know Cain McLeod is not his real name\u2014\u201d \u201cYes, we do. Abel Manners changed his name to Cain McLeod when he was released.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d Detective Dwyer sounds almost sympathetic. I pull myself together. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come up.\u201d \u201cUh huh.\u201d Walker is sceptical. \u201cSo is there anything you wish to change about your statement with respect to the evening of 18 November?\u201d Somewhere in the distance, behind the feeling that I\u2019m reeling, comes a realisation that they think I\u2019m lying to protect Cain. About what, I\u2019m not sure. \u201cNo. That\u2019s what happened.\u201d Dwyer hands me her card. \u201cI know this is a lot to take in. We\u2019ll be in touch, but in the meantime, if you remember anything at all, just call.\u201d I stand in the foyer for a few minutes after they leave. Joe asks me if I\u2019m all right, and his voice shakes me back. \u201cYes, thank you, Joe. They just needed to ask me a few questions.\u201d \u201cAbout what happened to your friend the other night?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d I remember then that he saw Cain and me come in. \u201cHave they arrested someone?\u201d \u201cNot yet.\u201d I force a smile. \u201cDid they ask you about that night?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I told them you and your friend came in at about eleven. That he was bleeding and you were taking care of him.\u201d Joe lowers his voice. \u201cI mentioned Mrs. Weinbaum may have called on you, but I didn\u2019t say why.\u201d Whit and Marigold are lingering in the stairwell just above the foyer. They walk with me back to the apartment. \u201cSo what happened?\u201d Marigold demands when I close the door. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear?\u201d \u201cNope. Couldn\u2019t hear a thing,\u201d Whit says unashamedly. I falter. I don\u2019t want to keep anything from them, but telling them what the detectives revealed feels like talking behind Cain\u2019s back\u2026I want to speak to him first. \u201cThey\u2019re corroborating Cain\u2019s account of what happened, that\u2019s all.\u201d Marigold frowns. \u201cAre you sure? You look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bit weird talking to the police\u2026 I need a cup of tea.\u201d \u201cYou sound like you could use something stronger,\u201d Whit says. \u201cIt\u2019s not even midday.\u201d He sighs. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in you, Freddie.\u201d Marigold continues to look at me. She knows there\u2019s something I\u2019m not saying. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Freddie?\u201d I pick up my phone. \u201cI\u2019m going to try Cain.\u201d They both watch as I dial. Again there\u2019s no answer and I leave a message. \u201cCain, the police have just been here. Please call me.\u201d \u201cWhere do you think he is?\u201d Marigold asks. \u201cHe might still be with the police.\u201d \u201cFreddie, what did the police say that\u2019s got you so shook up?\u201d Whit answers for me. \u201cThey told her that Cain\u2019s been in prison. That he\u2019s a murderer.\u201d Both Marigold and I turn to Whit aghast. \u201cWhat?\u201d Marigold speaks first. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny, Whit.\u201d \u201cYou knew?\u201d I gasp. \u201cHow?\u201d \u201cOne of the FBI guys told me after I was stabbed\u2026 They have some crazy theory that Cain killed Caroline and then came after me.\u201d \u201cWe were all together, sitting across from one another when Caroline screamed.\u201d \u201cWhich is why I told them they were on a bad trip.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything\u2026\u201d \u201cYou weren\u2019t going to, either.\u201d Whit shrugs. \u201cAnyway, he\u2019s served his time.\u201d I sit down. \u201cWhat exactly did the FBI tell you, Whit?\u201d Whit falls onto the couch beside me. \u201cCain was convicted of murder in the first degree. He served nearly eight years. Got out about seven years ago, changed his name, and wrote a novel.\u201d \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think this was something Freddie and I needed to know?\u201d Marigold has recovered enough from the shock of the news to shout at Whit. I interrupt. \u201cIf he got out seven years ago, and he served nearly eight, he must have been very young when this happened.\u201d \u201cUnless he lied to us about his age, along with everything else.\u201d Marigold folds her arms. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that he\u2019s ever lied to us,\u201d I protest. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell us anything about prison!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the same thing as lying. None of us has told each other everything.\u201d Marigold studies me. \u201cIt\u2019s a big thing to leave out, Freddie.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s also a big thing to confide.\u201d \u201cFreddie\u2019s right,\u201d Whit says. \u201cIf Cain\u2019s thirty, he must have gone away when he was sixteen.\u201d \u201cCan you even go to prison when you\u2019re sixteen?\u201d Marigold asks. \u201cFor murder you can.\u201d \u201cSo Cain killed someone when he was around sixteen,\u201d I say almost to myself. It sounds ludicrous. Of all of us, Cain always seemed the most sane\u2014the least felonious. \u201cI wonder if that was why he ran away?\u201d Whit says. \u201cPoor Cain.\u201d Marigold is back to her dogged loyalty. \u201cDid the police say where he was, Freddie? Have they arrested him?\u201d \u201cNo, they didn\u2019t say, but they must have talked to him.\u201d \u201cSo what do we do?\u201d Marigold asks. I shake my head. I feel loss and lost, a hole in the place of what I believed, what I should believe. Marigold checks her phone for the time. \u201cI\u2019d better get Whit back before his mom realizes he\u2019s gone.\u201d I turn to Whit. \u201cStill?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d He makes his disgust plain as he stands up to go. \u201cLuckily, she goes to work for a few hours every day, and Dad covers for me.\u201d \u201cHow are you, anyway?\u201d I forced my thoughts away from Cain. Whit pulls up his sweater and T-shirt to show me the scar. \u201cThey took the last stitches out this morning. I can go back to the gym next week.\u201d \u201cIs it sore?\u201d \u201cNo. Not anymore.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s good news at least.\u201d He hugs me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Cain. There\u2019ll be an explanation.\u201d \u201cFor going to jail?\u201d He pulls on his jacket. \u201cYou never know, Freddie. Our Cain could be the mythical innocent man.\u201d *** My dear Hannah, What a beautiful reveal! It becomes clear now why Cain seems not to be disturbed by the fact that Isaac Harmon was wanted for murder. You\u2019ve upped the ante magnificently! Talking of which, I came across another crime scene yesterday. I don\u2019t know if it was the mask and anonymity it affords, but I was feeling bold, and so I grabbed some pictures of the body for you. I must have got there only moments after the police\u2014they hadn\u2019t even got the crime scene tape up. Anyway, the victim seems to have been partially disemboweled. All that dark area is blood. I imagine it took him a few minutes to die, and judging by the smearing in the blood, he struggled. I know you don\u2019t generally write such graphic scenes, but this novel might call for a little extra realism\u2026and this could be your inspiration. I\u2019ll keep my eye out for more. Waiting anxiously for your next installment. Yours, Leo *** Dear Miss Tigone, Thank you for contacting the authorities with your concerns regarding the man you know as Leo Johnson with whom you have been corresponding, and who has been progressively commenting and advising on the manuscript of your novel. The images you attached, which you say Leo Johnson sent you yesterday, do indeed evidence an unusual and alarming access to a real and recent victim, whose body, according to our forensic experts, seems to have been reported to police only after these images were taken. The older images you sent of other crime scenes also relate to recent unsolved murders. The matter has been referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation as possibly pertaining to a number of cases currently under investigation. We have dispatched our agents in Sydney who, with our colleagues in the Australian Federal Police, will make contact directly, if they have not done so already. Please do not have any further communication with Leo Johnson until you have been briefed. Sincerely, Special Agent Michael Smith Federal Bureau of Investigation *** Dear Sir/Madame, We represent Ms. Hannah Tigone, who contacted you about correspondence from a party she knows as Mr. Leo Johnson. Whereas the FBI has requested Ms. Tigone\u2019s assistance in the apprehension of Leo Johnson, whom you believe to be responsible for a number of homicides in and around Boston, Massachusetts, and perhaps further afield, but about whom you have little or no information, and with a view to the urgency of establishing the parameters of Ms. Tigone\u2019s cooperation, to enable you to identify and locate Leo Johnson, we confirm the following agreements and arrangements arising out of the meeting between your agents and our client. Ms. Tigone will continue to correspond with Leo Johnson, with the aim of establishing his identity and location without revealing that he is under suspicion for any criminal act. She will attempt to obtain from Leo Johnson an image of himself as well as a physical address. To this end Ms. Tigone will continue to send Leo Johnson chapters of her manuscript so as not to arouse his suspicions. Ms. Tigone will give your agents immediate access to any and all such correspondence. Ms. Tigone will make you immediately aware of any impressions she may have gained through her contact with Leo Johnson as to his location, true identity, or any future criminal acts or intentions. You will indemnify Ms. Tigone and ensure that she is held harmless against any action, criminal or civil, which arises out of her continued correspondence with Leo Johnson regardless of whether that action is initiated in Australia or the United States. You will use your best endeavours to ensure Ms. Tigone\u2019s physical safety and also the commercial confidentiality of her manuscript. Yours faithfully, Peter Kent Abercrombie, Kent and Associates \n Chapter Nineteen The decision to return to the library early the next morning is made in desperation and frustration. I need to work. Cain is still not picking up and, in the apartment, I\u2019m tempted to try again repeatedly, to think about him and nothing else. When things get stuck, change the scene. And so I go back to where it all began, reset to a time before I met Whit and Marigold and Cain, before we heard a young woman die. I cast my eyes upwards and anchor myself in the magnificent vaulted ceiling of the Reading Room, determined to make that my memory of this place. But Heroic Chin, Freud Girl, and Handsome Man look out at me from my own manuscript. Most of all Handsome Man. The bus is crowded now, so much so that I can\u2019t see who\u2019s driving it. Handsome Man sits in the back, behind Shaun Jacobs. Perhaps he is, as Whit says, innocent. Wrongly accused, wrongly convicted. God, I hope so. I remember what it was like to kiss him and, when I think about it, I believe completely that he is innocent. And in my manuscript he can be. Perhaps it\u2019s time for my Handsome Man to diverge from his inspiration. And yet I\u2019m not ready to leave Cain behind, to remove him from my manuscript or my story. I step out at midday because I\u2019m vexed and hungry. I don\u2019t feel like going to the Map Room on my own, and so I head out in search of a pretzel vendor. The cold hits me like a wall the moment I leave the building. The temperature has plummeted in the time I\u2019ve been inside. The clouds are a vague green colour. \u201cIt\u2019s going to snow.\u201d I turn sharply. Cain. \u201cHello, Freddie.\u201d My voice comes on the second attempt. \u201cHow did you know where I was?\u201d \u201cI went by your place first, and since then I\u2019ve been looking for you. This was my third guess.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve just got here?\u201d \u201cNo, I saw that you were in the Reading Room. I was waiting for you to come out.\u201d \u201cWhy? Why didn\u2019t you simply come in?\u201d \u201cI thought we should talk\u2026 We can\u2019t really do that in the Reading Room.\u201d I say nothing. \u201cFreddie\u2026you\u2019re not afraid of me, are you?\u201d I\u2019m not sure what to say, or how I feel. \u201cShould I be?\u201d The first flakes of snow fall, large and soft and wet. I begin to shiver. He raises his hand and then pulls back without touching me. I am relieved and disappointed. \u201cHow about we go and have lunch\u2026somewhere warm\u2026and public? And I can explain.\u201d I nod. \u201cSomewhere close; I\u2019m freezing.\u201d We find a diner in Copley Place and take a booth. We order hot chocolate and pancakes like any other couple. And we eat and drink and talk about the snow. I am aware that despite everything, I am happy to be with him. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling you,\u201d I say. \u201cThey police took my phone again, Freddie. They let me go at midnight.\u201d \u201cThey arrested you?\u201d \u201cNo. They just held me for questioning.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI found Boo\u2019s body.\u201d \u201cAnd you have a history.\u201d I take a deep breath. We can\u2019t avoid talking about this. \u201cA record\u2014they call it a record.\u201d He stops and looks as me silently as if he\u2019s trying to see something in my face. \u201cFreddie, when I was fifteen, I killed my stepfather.\u201d I notice a head turn in the neighbouring booth. He waits until I\u2019m ready. \u201cWhy?\u201d I ask eventually. His eyes flicker. \u201cIt was self-defence, Freddie. They didn\u2019t believe me, but it was.\u201d \u201cWas this why you ran away?\u201d \u201cNo. This was after I came back.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they believe you?\u201d \u201cMy stepfather was a policeman. I was a delinquent kid.\u201d Two heads now, and a whisper between them. I stand. Cain looks down and exhales. \u201cI understand\u2014\u201d I lean across to him and whisper. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to my place. We can talk without being overheard.\u201d He looks surprised. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t ask me that, Cain. Just come.\u201d Joe opens the door of the Carrington foyer and welcomes us in. \u201cI wondered if you\u2019d get caught in this storm when you went out, Miss Kincaid. I\u2019m glad Mr. McLeod found you.\u201d Joe hands me a cake box which was reportedly delivered a few minutes before. It\u2019s full of beautifully decorated cupcakes. But again there\u2019s no card or any indication who might have sent it. Joe volunteers to contact the bakery with which the box is branded, to check, assuring me that couriers are always losing the card. I leave two cupcakes for him to have with his coffee, and Cain and I take the rest of the box up. On another day I would have wondered more about my mysterious benefactor, but today they\u2019re only cakes. I shut the door to the apartment and listen to the lock click into place. So now I\u2019m alone with a murderer. But then, it\u2019s not the first time. Cain puts the box down on the coffee table. I curl up on the couch. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s do this.\u201d He sits on the other end of the couch. \u201cWhat do you want to know, Freddie? I\u2019ll tell you anything.\u201d I choose my words carefully. \u201cWhy did you kill your stepfather, Cain? I know you say you were defending yourself, but I\u2019m not sure I understand how a boy of fifteen finds himself in a place where his only option is to kill a man.\u201d Cain frowns. \u201cIt didn\u2019t begin that night. In a way, it was years in the making. My stepfather had, as I told you, always wanted a large family. When he realised that wasn\u2019t going to happen\u2014that I was it\u2014things changed. He became mean, brutal. By the time I was fourteen, I\u2019d become the proverbial \u2018clumsy kid\u2019 who was always walking into doors and falling down stairs.\u201d He swallows. \u201cI still loved him for the longest time. I tried, I really did. And then one day I couldn\u2019t take any more, and I hit back. It was the world\u2019s luckiest punch\u2026or maybe the unluckiest, because it landed, and then\u2026\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI panicked. That\u2019s when I ran.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand. You didn\u2019t kill him?\u201d I move closer to Cain. \u201cNot then. Isaac convinced me to go back eventually.\u201d Cain smiles faintly. \u201cSaid he couldn\u2019t nursemaid me forever, and I\u2019d never survive without him. And so I went home.\u201d \u201cAnd your stepfather\u2026\u201d \u201cSaid he was glad I was back. That all was forgiven and that we would make a new start as a family.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cGod, I wanted to believe it.\u201d \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Cain\u2019s face clouds, and for the first time I can see that however much he doesn\u2019t want to scare me, he\u2019s not calm. That this isn\u2019t without pain. I reach out and take his hand and hold it tightly. Cain looks at my hand in his, focuses on it as he continues. \u201cHe misses dinner one night and calls to say he\u2019s at a bar. But he\u2019s coming home because he and I need to have a man-to-man. And I know\u2026and I should have run again but\u2026my mom\u2026 Anyway, I stayed.\u201d He doesn\u2019t take his eyes off my hand. \u201cHe gets back, liquored up and angry. And immediately he drags me off to my bedroom. I should have known then. He would normally have belted me right where I stood. He\u2019s screaming about me running away, what a disgrace I am, how the whole force knows his son had been selling his ass all over Boston.\u201d Cain tries to laugh, but he doesn\u2019t quite. \u201cIt had never occurred to me that he thought that was how I\u2019d survived. I\u2019m too surprised to deny it\u2026though I don\u2019t know if it would have helped at that stage. He starts slapping me around. I\u2019m expecting that.\u201d Cain\u2019s hand is cold in mine. I hold on tighter trying to warm it somehow. \u201cHe knocks me onto my bed facedown and pins me with my left arm twisted behind my back. I hear him slide his belt out of the loops, and I think he\u2019s going to use it to hit me. He\u2019s done that before\u2014I could have endured that. It\u2019s not until he starts fumbling with my jeans that I realise what he actually intends to do.\u201d A strange, strangled sound leaves my throat. I feel sick. He looks up at me now, and it\u2019s only when he wipes the tears from my cheek that I know that I\u2019m crying. \u201cI fight, but he\u2019s got at least a hundred pounds on me.\u201d Cain stops to breathe. \u201cIsaac taught me to sleep with a knife under whatever I was using as a pillow. He called it a \u2018teddy bear\u2019\u2014said it was the only thing that would keep away anything that went bump in the night. I didn\u2019t stop sleeping with a teddy bear when I got home. I feel my stepfather\u2019s grip loosen as he tries to pull down my jeans, and I remember the knife. I can reach it with my free hand. I twist and swing.\u201d Cain shifts slightly, flinching unconsciously as it replays. \u201cHe pulls back\u2026makes a kind of gurgling sound. And I don\u2019t know where the knife has gone. And then he falls, and I see that the knife is in his neck and there\u2019s blood everywhere.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s dead?\u201d Cain nods. \u201cAnd then the police arrive.\u201d \u201cHow could anyone think it was not self-defence?\u201d \u201cBecause I\u2019d hidden a knife under my pillow. And he was a decorated cop.\u201d The darkness has lifted a little from Cain\u2019s face. His hand feels warm again. \u201cI was sixteen by the time it all got to trial. I was convicted\u2014served two years in a juvenile facility and was transferred to adult prison on my eighteenth birthday.\u201d I must be gazing at him in horror\u2026I feel completely in horror. \u201cI served another five years before I was paroled. In that time, I finished school and studied literature through UNC. When I got out, I worked whatever job I could get and wrote a novel.\u201d He holds my gaze as well as my hand. \u201cFreddie, I didn\u2019t mean to deceive you, any of you, but this is not the kind of thing you tell people if you can avoid it.\u201d \u201cWould you ever have told us?\u201d Cain considers it. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe eventually. I\u2019m not sure I regret what I did, but I am ashamed of it. I don\u2019t expect people to understand. Whit\u2019s biggest problem is how to actually avoid graduating from Harvard Law, and Marigold thinks expensive tattoos make her street.\u201d \u201cAnd me.\u201d \u201cYou?\u201d His smiles ruefully. \u201cYou, I might be trying to impress.\u201d \u201cHow did you find Mr. Jacobs?\u201d \u201cI asked around his old haunts. One of the old men he drank with told me that Boo sometimes sleeps in the boathouse on Magazine Beach. I went over there looking for him.\u201d Cain exhales. \u201cI get there and find him facedown on the bank. I assume he\u2019s just passed out until I turn him over and see that his throat has been cut.\u201d \u201cBloody hell!\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve that, Freddie. He was a junkie and a drunk but\u2026\u201d He stops and shrugs. \u201cI called the police.\u201d \u201cAnd they kept you for questioning?\u201d \u201cYes. Given my record, it follows.\u201d \u201cBut they let you go, so they realise you had nothing to do with it.\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t have enough to arrest me, and there\u2019s a limit to how long you can question people without actually arresting them, so yes, they let me go.\u201d My phone rings. I can see it\u2019s Marigold. I decline the call, but I send her a text to say I am writing and will call when I take a break. \u201cIn case she decides to come over here to see why I\u2019m not answering my phone.\u201d Cain smiles. \u201cNo in case about it.\u201d He closes his eyes and opens them again. I can see the shadows beneath them. \u201cI suppose the police told Whit and Marigold too,\u201d he says, yawning. \u201cWhit\u2019s known for a while.\u201d I slide off the couch and fetch one of the blankets folded neatly on the bentwood chair by the heater. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d \u201cNo, he\u2019s inclined to believe you\u2019ve paid your debt.\u201d \u201cI like Whit.\u201d I laugh and pull the blanket over him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he murmurs. \u201cYou\u2019re exhausted. Close your eyes for a while.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you need your couch?\u201d \u201cNot for a couple of hours. Sleep. We can decide what to do later.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, I can\u2019t tell you how happy I was to hear from you again. I know it was only a couple of weeks, but I\u2019d begun to fear I\u2019d offended you somehow. I hope you know I wouldn\u2019t do that for the world. I so value our friendship, our shared vision and craft\u2014I was bereft with the idea that I would not hear from you again, and frantic with the thought that I had inadvertently insulted or upset you. If not for global lockdown, I might have flown to Sydney to make amends for any transgression. I did fear that perhaps I had become too strident in my interest in the lives of your characters, too enthusiastic in my suggestions. But you assure me that your absence was simply the result of a computer crash. So I am relieved that we are still as we were and that you managed to retrieve your precious manuscript from the abyss of cyberspace. It surprises me that you don\u2019t back up to the cloud, but you wouldn\u2019t be the first to distrust it. But perhaps now that you have come so close to losing your novel entirely you might consider an online depository of some sort. Now, Chapter 19! I think Americans are more likely to say police officer than policeman. It\u2019s just a small thing. I do like that you are not painting Cain McLeod as a simple monster. Of course they do exist, but understandable damage is much more interesting as a motive for murder. As Marigold said earlier, even the monsters have a reason. Anyway, making him sympathetic will make his actions all the more shocking. There was a march through Boston yesterday. I thought about joining it just to get out. The most trying thing about the pandemic is that it\u2019s boring. If not for your chapters, I would have little to look forward to. Already watching my inbox for your next. Yours, Leo \n Chapter Twenty Cain sleeps for most of the afternoon. On his stomach, one hand under the cushion he uses as a pillow, as if even now he\u2019s reaching for a knife. I sit in the armchair opposite, pretending to read and watching. My vigilance is not based on fear of him, but for him. The horror of what happened is difficult to take in, and I wonder how he could be so calm, so reasonable, so not bitter. If it had been me, I would never have stopped screaming. And yet he sleeps so soundly. I wonder if he\u2019s forgotten that he kissed me and that I kissed him. I hate myself for thinking about that moment after everything that\u2019s happened since. It seems selfish. A text from Marigold: Are you still writing? I message back. Give me another couple of hours. I open my laptop in a vague attempt to not be a complete liar. The words take me by surprise. I don\u2019t expect to do any more than stare at the text I\u2019ve written, a story faded and made trivial by unfolding reality, but suddenly my Handsome Man speaks to me of secrets, of pain and injustice. The scream that connects him to Freud Girl and Heroic Chin echoes the silent one in his head. I understand his need to link every thread into a web of story, his distrust of letting things unfold. He understands, probably better than I, that a story can turn on you. When I look up again, Cain\u2019s eyes are open, watching me. I smile. \u201cHello. Do you feel any better?\u201d He nods slowly. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I glance back at the laptop screen. \u201cAbout five.\u201d He sits up. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Freddie. I only meant to close my eyes for a few minutes.\u201d I move because he seems too far away. Because I want to be closer. And as I sit beside him he turns and kisses me. I\u2019m surprised and then consumed by it. And exhilarated. I respond so completely, so intensely that I am shaking. And then he pulls away, his breath ragged, and I hear myself gasp in protest. He stares at me. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d I pull him back towards me. I\u2019m not sure about anything except that certainty is overrated. But Cain is afraid I will be caught in the web around him. I reach out and touch his face, trying to think of some way to reassure him that I am choosing this with full knowledge of what he did. In the end, I just kiss him honestly, and I trust the act to say all those things for which words are tricky and inadequate. The moment extends into forever, deepening with the quickening of our pulses. He fumbles with the tiny buttons on my shirt and manages in frustration to tear off a couple. \u201cYou\u2019d better be handy with a needle and thread,\u201d I warn as a spinning button rattles to rest on the floorboards. \u201cFor you, I\u2019ll learn,\u201d he murmurs into my neck. I unbutton Cain\u2019s shirt with less haste and slightly more care for the fastenings. My fingers linger on a scar above his hip. \u201cHow did you get this?\u201d He seems amused that I would ask this now. \u201cThat\u2019s an appendicitis scar.\u201d \u201cAnd this one.\u201d I can feel a raised scar on his lower back. \u201cAre you trying to change the subject?\u201d He kisses me before I can deny it. I stop asking questions. And we lose ourselves to feeling\u2014skin and warmth, breath and heartbeat. Discovery and pleasure and all the searing urgency of new love. And afterwards I lead him to my bed and we make love there as well, taking our time, coming to know each other\u2019s bodies. I am kissing the scar on his back when I ask about it again. \u201cThis is not the appendicitis scar, is it?\u201d \u201cFreddie, I really can\u2019t answer questions while you\u2019re doing that,\u201d he says, pulling me round and against his chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t like my interrogation methods?\u201d \u201cOh, I like them\u2026 They are, however, somewhat counterproductive.\u201d He kisses the undersides of my breasts. \u201cIt would be like asking you why you were so interested in that scar while doing this.\u201d I wait until he\u2019s finished. \u201cPoint taken. It\u2019s in the exact same place Whit\u2019s scar is.\u201d \u201cIs it?\u201d He stops what he\u2019s doing. \u201cI was stabbed when I was in prison\u2026with a knife fashioned out of a part of a bed frame.\u201d \u201cOne of the other inmates tried to kill you?\u201d \u201cNot on that occasion.\u201d He pulls me closer into his arms. \u201cIt was a punishment\u2026a fairly minor one. They stabbed me in a safe place.\u201d \u201cIs there such a thing?\u201d \u201cIf the man doing the stabbing was once a surgeon, there is. No organ damage or permanent injury, and they called the guards and had me taken to the infirmary when they were done.\u201d \u201cWhy were you being punished?\u201d \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not entirely sure. Sometimes the smartest thing to do is accept and keep your eyes down.\u201d \u201cThey could have killed you!\u201d \u201cNo, they knew what they were doing. As I said, the guy who used the knife was a surgeon\u2014if you didn\u2019t move, you\u2019d live. If you struggled\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, God.\u201d He kisses the top of my head. \u201cBefore you start imagining the worst, the correctional facility in which I served adult time was on the whole quite progressive. It wasn\u2019t summer camp, but neither was it Alcatraz.\u201d \u201cBut they stabbed you when you stepped out of line?\u201d He laughs. Pressed against his chest, I can feel it more than hear it. \u201cIt was not an official reprimand, Freddie.\u201d \u201cBut it happened.\u201d \u201cEven progressive prisons have their own societal rules, their own hierarchy. And men in prison are not necessarily fair or reasonable.\u201d \u201cSo nothing happened to them\u2026there was no action?\u201d \u201cThe official version was that I slipped and injured myself in the kitchens.\u201d \u201cBut you knew who stabbed you?\u201d \u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t remember.\u201d \u201cBut\u2014\u201d His lips are on mine. It is a gentle but effective way of cutting short my outrage. \u201cI appreciate that you care, Freddie.\u201d He laces his fingers with mine. \u201cIt means a lot that you do. But it was a long time ago now. I made the best decision I knew how\u2026and in the end I got by.\u201d I settle against his shoulder, content to enjoy the moment, the feeling of him, for now. Cain tells me about the germination of his first novel while he was still in prison. The idea that lingered with no reason for existing until he found that very few people wanted to employ an ex-con. The book he wrote while he was trying to work out how to be in the free world. I may have remained there in his arms forever, or at least until we got hungry, if someone hadn\u2019t pounded on the door. Even before she calls my name, I know it\u2019s Marigold. I groan. \u201cI told her I\u2019d call. You distracted me.\u201d Cain grins. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d By the time Cain and I have scrabbled into our clothes and answered the door, a few of my neighbours have responded to Marigold\u2019s pounding by peeking out to see what\u2019s going on. Marigold embraces me the moment I open the door. \u201cWhen you didn\u2019t call and stopped responding I thought something might have happened\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine, Marigold. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I turned off my phone.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d She tenses when she sees him. \u201cCain!\u201d \u201cHello, Marigold.\u201d Cain greets her from the living room, where he has very recently found and pulled on his clothes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mention Cain was here,\u201d she says accusingly. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance\u2026\u201d \u201cYou said you were writing.\u201d I hesitate, unsure what to say. \u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d Cain resolves it all by taking my hand. \u201cThat was my fault.\u201d Marigold gapes at us. \u201cReally?\u201d To be honest, I feel a bit ridiculous. We\u2019re all adults, for God\u2019s sake, but Marigold has raced over here to check on me out of genuine if misplaced concern. \u201cHow did you get here? Tell me you didn\u2019t walk?\u201d \u201cOf course not. We have these things called Ubers.\u201d Marigold hasn\u2019t taken her eyes from Cain. \u201cI take it the police had their wires crossed\u2026I knew it!\u201d I glance at Cain. Cain sighs. \u201cIf they are alleging I\u2019ve killed anyone recently, then yes, they have their wires crossed.\u201d \u201cRecently?\u201d I announce that I\u2019m going to make coffee. Cain and Marigold sit in my kitchen, and he tells her more or less what he told me. Marigold is quiet for a while. \u201cYou didn\u2019t intend to kill him,\u201d she says. \u201cYour stepfather?\u201d Cain pauses before he replies. \u201cNo, but I didn\u2019t intend not to. I just wanted to get him off me.\u201d She throws her arms around him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Cain.\u201d Cain barely manages to save his coffee from being sent flying. \u201cWho the fuck were your lawyers?\u201d she demands without letting go. \u201cWhat kind of dumbass lawyers would let you go to jail for that?\u201d \u201cI had a few lawyers. I barely saw any of them, to be honest.\u201d I notice a shadow cross his face. \u201cMy stepfather was a cop, Marigold. It was bad enough that I killed him; they were not going to let me smear his good name.\u201d Marigold shakes her head. \u201cYou should sue! It\u2019s preposterous!\u201d \u201cMaybe, but I\u2019d rather just move on.\u201d \u201cBut\u2014\u201d \u201cDo me a favour, Marigold. Would you tell Whit? If I have to go through it again, I\u2019m going to feel like the Ancient Mariner.\u201d Marigold nods. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d She looks at me. \u201cCan I tell him about you two as well?\u201d Cain looks bemused, but he leaves the reply to me. I open my last packet of Tim Tams and sit down. \u201cSure, but don\u2019t embroider it.\u201d \u201cEmbroider it!\u201d Marigold is indignant. \u201cYou two are the writers!\u201d Her eyes well up. \u201cI\u2019m very happy for you both.\u201d I hand around my precious chocolate biscuits, trying to make the moment a little less awkward. We work our way through the packet. I show Marigold and Cain how to suck coffee through a Tim Tam, a practice which many Australians consider perhaps our greatest contribution to culinary culture. But there\u2019s a skill to completing the draw before the biscuit disintegrates, and Marigold and Cain are both novices to the art of the Tim Tam Slam. The instruction at least alleviates the gravity of the conversation. It\u2019s not quite a celebration, but there is joy in chocolate, coffee, and absurd modes of consumption. \u201cWould you like a ride home, Marigold?\u201d Cain takes my hand as he stands up. \u201cI probably should get going and put my apartment back together.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your apartment?\u201d \u201cThe police searched it. I think Boston\u2019s finest had a competition to see who could make the biggest pile of my stuff.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s awful\u2014can they do that?\u201d \u201cYep.\u201d Cain nods regretfully. \u201cThey can. And they are nothing if not thorough.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll help you clean up!\u201d Marigold declares. \u201cThank you.\u201d Cain picks up the used coffee mugs and takes them to my sink. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d \u201cNo, you won\u2019t be,\u201d Marigold is adamant. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to be. Come on\u2026many hands and all that.\u201d Cain is beginning to look a bit trapped. I suggest that we give him a bit of space. \u201cHe can call if he needs us.\u201d But Marigold will not be deterred. \u201cNeither Freddie nor I will be able to sleep with the thought of you cleaning up that mess on your own.\u201d \u201cThis is really something I need to do on my own, Marigold.\u201d \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. This is when you need your friends!\u201d Again Marigold\u2019s eyes well up. And again I am struck by the fragility that lurks just below. Perhaps Cain sees it too because he gives in to Marigold\u2019s determined camaraderie. \u201cSure. Thank you.\u201d I grab my coat and change into a shirt that is not missing buttons, and we head out to Cain\u2019s old Jeep. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whisper as soon as Marigold is out of earshot. \u201cDo you want me to tell her to\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. My biggest secret is already out.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, I hope you\u2019re okay. I caught a story on CNN that Australia was flooding now. Weren\u2019t you on fire yesterday? Anyway, I hope that you remain undefeated if not unaffected by the natural disasters assailing your fair nation. So, our heroine beds the villain. A classic trope! Classic because it works. Her eventual disillusionment will be all the more powerful. And so too, I suspect, will be the disillusionment of Marigold and Whit. Well, maybe not Marigold\u2014she seems to be on to him, but Whit will be shattered. With respect to the scene in which Freddie and Cain become intimate: I wonder if it might be better to have it not go so well. Perhaps Cain is impotent\u2014a symptom or the cause of his homicidal rage\u2014or perhaps he has a sexual need to humiliate or be humiliated. I think a scene along those lines could add a certain raw intensity to the plot. Re: my address. I am so touched that you would want to send me something, but honestly Hannah, I have an idea of what postage costs between Australia and the U.S., and I cannot in good conscience allow you to go to such expense. Whatever it is, hang on to it, and I will collect it in person one day. Fondly yours, Leo \n Chapter Twenty-One Cain\u2019s apartment is in Roxbury, in an old building, which, if renovated, might be lovely. Several young men linger on the sidewalk outside the entry. A couple of them greet Cain as we pass. They speak loudly, with casual and entirely unaggressive profanity. His response is friendly, but he doesn\u2019t stop or introduce us. The inside of the building is crumbling and faded but clean. The elevator clunks up to the third floor and Cain opens the door to 319. If we hadn\u2019t known the police had done this, we might have called them. The apartment is trashed. Every shelf cleared, every drawer upturned, every cushion removed. The items are all heaped in a pile in the centre of the room. For a while, all we can do is stare at the mess. \u201cWe\u2019ll begin with the books.\u201d I choose a place to start. \u201cLet\u2019s get them back onto the bookcases. Cain, how were they shelved?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cAlphabetically?\u201d \u201cNovels and poetry there, and nonfiction and research materials there.\u201d He points out the relevant bookcases. \u201cAnd, yes, alphabetically by author.\u201d I smile. My books are shoved wherever they fit. They\u2019re quick to put away, less quick to find. \u201cWhat about your plotting room?\u201d I ask suddenly. \u201cGod! Did they take that apart too?\u201d \u201cThey took most of that with them. My computer, too.\u201d His voice is controlled, but I can hear the frustration, the anger. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for some kind of manifesto, I expect.\u201d The horror must be apparent on my face. He puts his arm around me. \u201cIt not as bad as all that,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI backed up the manuscript and photos of the plot diagrams and emailed them all to myself.\u201d I lean into him. His eyes meet mine, and for a moment we are lost in each other. \u201cHey, you two\u2014get back to work!\u201d Marigold takes a stack of novels to the appropriate shelf. Between the three of us, we return the living room to some semblance of order. I savour Cain\u2019s taste in books as I slide each into alphabetical place. Intelligent, diverse, eclectic. Battered classics with notes in the margins. Recent releases. Prize-winners and pulp. The occasional graphic novel. A thesaurus and a couple of books on grammar. \u201cFuck!\u201d Marigold stands at the bedroom door. I leave the bookcase to see what\u2019s wrong. The bedroom, too, is in disarray, clothes and bedding, shoes and more books in a heap by a stripped bed. The mattress had been slashed, foam and fabric pulled away from exposed springs. \u201cOne of the officers thought he saw a tear in the cover.\u201d Cain sighs. \u201cApparently people often hide things in mattresses.\u201d \u201cAnd they just left it like this?\u201d Marigold is livid. \u201cWhere do they expect you to sleep?\u201d \u201cI think they were hoping it would be a cell.\u201d \u201cBut surely they can\u2019t do this\u2014\u201d \u201cThey left me some paperwork to fill in\u2014\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t sleep on paperwork, Cain.\u201d Marigold\u2019s outrage is rising exponentially. \u201cYou need to speak to your lawyer about this\u2026 You do have a lawyer, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d Cain squeezes my hand. \u201cIs anybody hungry? We could order a pizza.\u201d \u201cI am,\u201d I volunteer, to help him change the subject and because, now that it\u2019s been mentioned, I am actually ravenous. \u201cDo you have a favourite pizza place?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a place a couple of blocks away that delivers.\u201d He reaches into his pocket and then grimaces as he realises. \u201cDamn\u2026 Freddie, can I borrow your phone? They took mine again.\u201d I hand him my phone and he dials. \u201cTell me what you want, Marigold, or we\u2019re all going to be eating vegetarian.\u201d Marigold asks for pepperoni with anchovies. I request pineapple and jalape\u00f1os on the vegetarian. \u201cYou want me to ask for fruit on pizza?\u201d Cain whispers. \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s delicious,\u201d I assure him. He makes the order, albeit sceptically. In the meantime, we begin work on Cain\u2019s galley kitchen in case we need plates. Cain seems to own a minimum of cooking implements, and so it does not take long. By the time the pizzas arrive, the kitchen is nearly sorted. We sit on the floor in the living room and eat straight out of the boxes. I make Marigold and Cain try the vegetarian pizza to demonstrate the virtue of pineapples. Marigold is revolted. Cain eats a slice, though I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s entirely convinced. \u201cWhit might like it,\u201d he offers. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like one of his weird donuts.\u201d I laugh at their poor American taste buds and tell them about the perfection of beetroot and fried egg on a hamburger. For a while we all valiantly ignore the fact that we are here to tidy up a house that has been taken apart by police searching for a murder weapon. But, inevitably, the conversation reverts to this. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they think you\u2019d want to kill Shaun Jacobs,\u201d Marigold says as she picks the pineapple off a slice of pizza. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Cain shrugs. \u201cThey think I might have wanted revenge for him slugging me with that bottle, I guess.\u201d \u201cDid you?\u201d Marigold asks. \u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019m incredulous that she would ask or even think such a thing. Cain simply looks at her. \u201cI mean, weren\u2019t you even the littlest bit angry with him?\u201d she clarifies. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t kill him, but weren\u2019t you angry? It would be natural to be angry.\u201d I remember that Marigold is a Psych postgrad\u2014Freud Girl in the flesh. \u201cHe was high,\u201d Cain replies. \u201cI\u2019m angry at myself for getting into that situation. I should have been watching for it\u2014I should have at least ducked.\u201d He shakes his head, leaning back against the bookcase. \u201cIf I\u2019d called the police when you told me to, Freddie, he might have been in prison, but he wouldn\u2019t be dead.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d I slide over to sit beside him. Marigold agrees. \u201cThere must be dozens of fights and assaults in Boston every night. It wouldn\u2019t rate to get the Boston PD to look up from their Dunkin\u2019 glazed jellies.\u201d I glance around the wrecked apartment. \u201cThey\u2019re looking now.\u201d Marigold frowns thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s a murder now.\u201d Cain drops Marigold off at her place on Athens Street first. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to let him go back to his place, are you?\u201d Marigold whispers to me as she gets out of the Jeep. \u201cThat bed\u2026\u201d I laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll offer him my couch.\u201d She opens her mouth, thinks better of it, and turns to go. But she pivots back to kiss my cheek and whisper in my ear, \u201cBe careful.\u201d I watch after her, bemused, yet also a little startled by the warning. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Cain asks. \u201cMarigold is concerned about where you\u2019ll sleep tonight.\u201d \u201cOh, I see.\u201d He glances at the backpack in which he had hastily stuffed a change of clothes when I quietly suggested he sleep at my apartment earlier. \u201cWhere exactly is she afraid of me sleeping?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s worried about the violence done to your mattress.\u201d I don\u2019t mention her last fleeting counsel\u2014I don\u2019t quite know what that meant myself. \u201cAre you sure about this, Freddie?\u201d I nudge him. \u201cHave you forgotten how we spent the afternoon?\u201d He smiles. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten. But I don\u2019t want to presume.\u201d He shifts. \u201cI am aware that I haven\u2019t given you any time to think about what you now know about me, to decide how you feel about what I did.\u201d It occurs to me at that moment. \u201cIs that what Boo meant when he said \u2018Does she know what you did?\u2019\u201d Cain\u2019s knuckles whiten on the steering wheel. \u201cHe said that? Yes, I guess that\u2019s what he meant.\u201d \u201cWhy did he care?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d \u201cHe seemed outraged.\u201d Cain shrugs. \u201cThat may have been more to do with whatever he was on.\u201d He pulls into the visitors\u2019 carpark at Carrington Square. \u201cI mean it, Freddie. If you need more time to think about getting involved with me, I understand.\u201d I don\u2019t look at him, aware that doing so is going to compromise the cautious, rational part of me. I can almost hear his heart pounding as he waits, or perhaps that\u2019s mine. I exhale and look up. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve thought about it. I\u2019m fine with it.\u201d His smile is surprised. A little puzzled. \u201cFreddie\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m already involved with you, whether or not we\u2019re lovers.\u201d I gather my courage and ask. \u201cAre you having second thoughts?\u201d His eyes widen. \u201cNo!\u201d He takes my hand firmly. \u201cNot about being with you. But, Freddie, I\u2019ve been through this before. I\u2019m a convicted felon. The police are going to make my life hell for a while, and I don\u2019t want you to be caught in the damage.\u201d I nod, moved that he wants to protect me. \u201cI understand. But I believe you, and I trust you. At the risk of being too honest, I think I\u2019m falling in love with you. The point of no damage is already passed. So let\u2019s just be what we are to each other, and we\u2019ll deal with the rest when it happens.\u201d He kisses me then, fiercely, and I am awash with the intensity of what he feels, and what I feel in return. We linger in the Jeep for a few moments before we head in because we\u2019re too old to be making out in a car. As we pass his station, Joe flags me down and thanks me again for the cupcakes. \u201cI\u2019ll bring another couple down.\u201d I had until that moment forgotten about the cupcakes. They are, as far as I know, still on the coffee table. \u201cOh, no, Miss Kincaid. You enjoy them. I could do with a few less cakes.\u201d He pats his ample belly. \u201cMy shift\u2019s finished now anyway.\u201d He picks up a business card from his desk and hands it to me. \u201cThat policewoman came back while you were out. Said she\u2019d like you to call her.\u201d I slip the card into my pocket and glance at my watch. It\u2019s almost midnight. Joe did say \u201clike\u201d\u2014a request, not a demand. Surely it is not urgent enough to call at this hour. \u201cI\u2019ll ring her in the morning.\u201d Cain and I sit up eating cupcakes and talking. There are so many things I want to ask, but I don\u2019t wish to interrogate him\u2026or seem like I\u2019m interrogating him. I\u2019m curious about the civility of Cain McLeod. He\u2019s not loud, or brutish, or cynical, and yet he survived years in an adult prison. How did he do that? \u201cI was released over seven years ago,\u201d he reminds me. \u201cJail wasn\u2019t the only influence on my life.\u201d \u201cEven so, it doesn\u2019t seem to have marked you at all. I went to yoga for a few months five years ago and I\u2019m still traumatised\u2026\u201d He laughs softly. I savour the sound. There\u2019s a trust, an intimacy in it. \u201cYou haven\u2019t read my first novel, have you?\u201d Immediately, I\u2019m mortified. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t think to get hold of a copy. \u201cI haven\u2019t yet, but\u2014oh, God, there\u2019s no excuse\u2026\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be absurd, Freddie.\u201d He wraps his arms around me. \u201cIf reading a writer\u2019s books was a requirement, none of us would ever have any friends.\u201d \u201cNo\u2026it is a requirement. When I have a book, it will be a requirement.\u201d He smiles. \u201cActually, I\u2019m glad you haven\u2019t read it. It may have scared you away.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause it\u2019s not civil. It\u2019s angry and hurt and hard. It sounds like it was written by an ex-con.\u201d \u201cBut the New York Times called it a brilliant debut,\u201d I remind him. He shrugs. \u201cPeople liked it\u2026or hated it enough to make it a success. Believe me, I was as surprised as anyone.\u201d \u201cBut you don\u2019t want to write like that anymore?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve told that story\u2014I can\u2019t tell it again.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d better read it,\u201d I say almost to myself. I look at him. \u201cUnless you\u2019d rather I didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cGo ahead. Just don\u2019t let it give you nightmares.\u201d I study him gently, certain of him, despite what he has done. \u201cHow could it?\u201d *** Dear Hannah, Ah, yes, the autobiographical first novel! Mine, thankfully, is still in a drawer. It served its purpose, expelled the demons, said all those things I felt I had to shout rather than say. The first book is something of a literary tantrum. Anyway, I\u2019m glad I had the good sense to never show it to anyone\u2014they\u2019d probably have had me arrested or committed. I give you, it\u2019s a stroke of genius to publish one\u2019s darkest secrets as a novel. Hide in plain sight, if you like. And it makes sense. While killers do not wish to be caught, they must yearn for some recognition of what they did, what they got away with. Having your deeds detailed in a novel would be perfect. I wouldn\u2019t mind reading Cain\u2019s novel myself! Now a couple of chapters ago we were talking about another murder. You may have forgotten or been distracted when you had that computer crash. I know I\u2019ve sent you some images of a crime scene, but I\u2019ve attached another set from a different incident to this email. I\u2019ve become quite good at finding and photographing crime scenes unnoticed. As you\u2019ll see this victim is a woman. She died of a head injury, probably beaten with a blunt object of some sort\u2014something like a brick or a hammer. I wondered if a victim similar to Caroline, and murdered in the same manner, might help connect the crimes and perhaps show the evolution of Cain from a man who initially murdered out of necessity and then simply discovered he liked it. I\u2019m sure it must happen. After all, how are you to know you like killing people until you have taken a life and in doing so discovered the incomparable thrill of holding existence in your hands and snuffing it out? I\u2019m projecting, of course. Anyway, have a look at the images and let me know what you think. I must say this is getting very exciting. Yours, Leo \n Chapter Twenty-Two I call Detective Justine Dwyer at nine. \u201cDetective Dwyer? I was told you wished to speak to me. Would you like me to come in?\u201d \u201cOh, no\u2014that won\u2019t be necessary. There are a couple of things I need to clarify. Are you at home, Winifred?\u201d \u201cYes\u2026\u201d \u201cI have to pass by there on my way to court. I could stop by\u2026in, say, half an hour?\u201d I hesitate. Cain is still in my bed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll only take a couple of minutes. I could meet you in the foyer, if you prefer.\u201d \u201cYes, okay, I suppose that would be all right.\u201d I place my phone on the bedside table, and Cain pulls me drowsily into his arms. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get dressed,\u201d I moan. \u201cDetective Dwyer is coming by to speak to me.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026I\u2019m meeting her in the foyer.\u201d He rubs his face. \u201cI should make tracks,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to talk to my agent about what\u2019s happening, call my mother, and buy another phone\u2026not in that order obviously\u2026\u201d I make coffee while he showers, and he makes toast while I do the same. A couple of sips in, it\u2019s nine thirty, and we abandon the attempt at breakfast. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you down to the foyer,\u201d Cain volunteers as he pulls on his jacket. I grab a notebook, write my phone number on a clean page, and hand it to Cain. \u201cCall me when you get a new phone, so I have your number.\u201d I hesitate a moment before blurting out, \u201cCain, I really think you should also call a lawyer.\u201d His face clouds a little. \u201cI had lawyers last time, Freddie. Good ones. My mother sold her house to pay for them. And I was still put away for seven years.\u201d I pull him towards me. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean lawyers couldn\u2019t help now.\u201d I lock my arms around him. \u201cJust think about it.\u201d He kisses my brow. \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cOkay, you\u2019ll call a lawyer?\u201d \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d \u201cYou could talk to Whit\u2014\u201d \u201cIf I were to retain a lawyer,\u201d he says sharply, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t involve Whit in the circus. Now I really should get going.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ll see you tonight?\u201d I add, hoping it doesn\u2019t sound too clingy. \u201cThat depends.\u201d \u201cOn what?\u201d \u201cOn whether you still want to.\u201d Detective Dwyer is climbing the stairs as Cain and I are about to go down. She looks startled. \u201cI was coming up to see if you\u2019d forgotten our appointment.\u201d She glances at her watch. \u201cWe did say half past nine?\u201d \u201cYes, we did. I\u2019m sorry\u2014I\u2019m running late.\u201d Cain presses my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d He nods at Dwyer as he passes her on the stairs and then waves at me from the bottom tread. I return my gaze to the detective. \u201cShall we go down?\u201d \u201cActually, it might be better if we go up to your apartment. It\u2019ll be more private.\u201d I think about asking her why a few questions need to be private, but in the end I just invite her in. She looks around, assessing my circumstances. Nervously, I tell her about the Sinclair Fellowship. \u201cI could never afford an address like this if not for the trust.\u201d She smiles. \u201cI did wonder if you were an heiress of some sort.\u201d \u201cI wish!\u201d I offer her a cup of coffee which she accepts, insisting I call her Justine rather that Detective Dwyer. \u201cI always thought Australians drank tea,\u201d she says as I duck into the kitchen. \u201cWe can drink tea and coffee\u2014we\u2019re fickle when it comes to beverages. How do you take it?\u201d \u201cBlack and strong.\u201d I bring two mugs of coffee into the living room and set the black one before her. She picks it up with both hands and sips. \u201cChrist, I need this. It\u2019s been one of those mornings.\u201d I say nothing, but I\u2019m aware of a sense of relief that has no cause except perhaps that the detective seems so human\u2014an ordinary person despite the fact that she wields the authority of the Boston PD. \u201cIt must be hard sometimes, even living here,\u201d she says. \u201cYou must get homesick.\u201d \u201cOccasionally,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut less than I expected.\u201d She nods. \u201cDid Cain McLeod spend the night here?\u201d I am momentarily wrong-footed by the question. \u201cYes.\u201d She doesn\u2019t react particularly. \u201cYou said you were just friends.\u201d \u201cWe are\u2026were\u2014\u201d \u201cBut now you\u2019re involved?\u201d \u201cI guess so.\u201d \u201cDespite his past?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHe committed cold-blooded murder.\u201d \u201cHe was defending himself.\u201d \u201cIs that what he told you?\u201d Justine shakes her head. \u201cHe was fifteen and that man was trying to\u2014\u201d I stop. \u201cThat man was a decorated policeman who was doing everything he could to be a good father.\u201d She speaks slowly, with conviction. \u201cAbel Manners waited until he came in to say good night and then stabbed him in the neck.\u201d \u201cCain was fighting him off. He didn\u2019t ever intend\u2014\u201d \u201cIf he didn\u2019t intend to kill his stepfather, if he hadn\u2019t planned it, why was the knife under his pillow?\u201d My voice rises. I can\u2019t believe it isn\u2019t obvious. \u201cBecause he didn\u2019t feel safe! He kept it there for protection.\u201d \u201cOh, Winifred.\u201d Justine\u2019s voice is sympathetic. \u201cIf that\u2019s true, why did Abel lock his mother in her room until after he\u2019d killed his stepfather?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cAbel locked his mother in her room before his stepfather returned. To make sure she couldn\u2019t interfere with his plan to murder the man. To make sure she couldn\u2019t stop him.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d \u201cWinifred, she called the police.\u201d For a few breaths I\u2019m speechless as I try to think. Did Cain lie to me? I drag myself back from panic, from the doubt that accompanies it. \u201cIf Cain\u2019s mother was locked in her room, she couldn\u2019t possibly have seen what happened.\u201d I\u2019m surprised by how confident I sound. I fix my gaze on the detective. \u201cWhat was it you needed to clarify with me, Justine?\u201d Justine exhales. \u201cI got the distinct impression that you were completely unaware of who the man who calls himself Cain McLeod actually was, and I wanted to warn you\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry you got that impression. It\u2019s not the case. You don\u2019t need to warn me.\u201d Justine\u2019s head tilts to one side. \u201cYou\u2019re aware that Cain McLeod is a dangerous man, that he\u2019s a person of interest in the deaths of Caroline Palfrey and Shaun Jacobs?\u201d \u201cI was sitting across a table from Cain McLeod when Caroline was killed, and as for Shaun Jacobs, Cain didn\u2019t even want to call the police when Shaun attacked him.\u201d Once more I sound deceptively calm\u2014to myself, anyway. It\u2019s possible I\u2019m not fooling Justine at all. \u201cWhy would he then kill him?\u201d \u201cMaybe he had a reason for not wanting the police involved that had nothing to do with protecting Mr. Jacobs.\u201d \u201cCain has been out of prison for seven years, Justine. Why would he suddenly decide to start killing random people?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re assuming he hasn\u2019t killed anyone before Caroline Palfrey.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t kill Caroline Palfrey. He didn\u2019t even know her.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s just a coincidence that her grandfather was the trial judge who sentenced Abel Manners?\u201d \u201cI\u2026what?\u201d My voice sounds squeaky. \u201cCaroline Palfrey\u2019s grandfather was Judge Andrew Keaton, who sentenced Abel Manners to ten years\u2014seven without parole.\u201d Justine\u2019s eyes are fixed on me as she watches intently for my reaction. \u201cDid Cain know that?\u201d I ask when I can make my voice work again. \u201cWe think he did. We think that\u2019s why he organised for her to be killed while he made sure he had an irrefutable alibi.\u201d \u201cThat alibi being us\u2014Whit and Marigold and me?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cBut you have no evidence of that\u2014or else you would have arrested him already.\u201d I exhale. \u201cI want you to be safe. I don\u2019t want you to get in over your head.\u201d She folds her arms and rests them on her knees, leaning forward. \u201cWhatever sob story he\u2019s told you about why he killed his stepfather, he did kill him. The man who now calls himself Cain McLeod is dangerous.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t see it.\u201d Justine is clearly frustrated. \u201cHave you read his novel?\u201d This again. \u201cNo. Not yet.\u201d \u201cI have, and you might want to before you decide whether or not you want to continue your friendship with Mr. McLeod.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cCain already told me it\u2019s\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about an ex-con who exacts revenge on those who sent him away\u2014the jury, his lawyers, the DA, the witnesses.\u201d \u201cOh\u2026really?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re surprised?\u201d There\u2019s only the tiniest hint of triumph in her voice. I shrug. \u201cWell, it\u2019s such a tired old trope and I know it was a bestseller\u2026\u201d \u201cWinifred\u2014this is not a joke.\u201d \u201cI know, but you can\u2019t seriously be telling me you think Cain is acting out his novel. Novelists make stuff up\u2014that\u2019s what we do.\u201d I place my mug on the coffee table, still full, now cold. \u201cJust what is it you want from me, Detective?\u201d Justine swallows. \u201cYou have my number. If Mr. McLeod says or does anything that changes your mind about his innocence, I\u2019d like you to call me.\u201d \u201cYou want me to spy on Cain?\u201d \u201cI want you to not become his next victim.\u201d For several beats we face each other in silence. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say in the end. \u201cReally?\u201d Justine seems surprised. \u201cIf I change my mind about Cain\u2019s innocence, I will call you.\u201d The promise costs me nothing. If I ever came to believe Cain had killed someone, aside from his stepfather, of course I\u2019d call the police. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m some kind of gangster\u2019s moll. The undertaking seems to satisfy\u2014or at least mollify\u2014Dwyer. She remembers she has to get to court, and after ensuring I have her number and know that I can call her any time of the day or night, she takes her leave. Afterwards I don\u2019t move for a while. I\u2019m just not sure what to do. In the end, I elect to clean up the remnants of our aborted breakfast. I feel unfairly wrenched from a morning in which I woke in Cain McLeod\u2019s arms. It is not until I\u2019ve wiped down the bench and washed all the dishes that I am ready to think about what Dwyer told me. I had not thought to ask Cain where his mother was the night he\u2019d killed his stepfather. I suppose I\u2019d assumed she\u2019d gone out. My phone rings and I answer, hoping it\u2019s Cain. \u201cHey, Freddie!\u201d \u201cWhit, how are you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m good. Doc\u2019s given me the all clear\u2014I was looking for Cain.\u201d \u201cThen why are you ringing me?\u201d \u201c\u2019Cause his phone is being answered by some police officer, and I thought he might be with you. Marigold said you two were\u2026you know\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat are you\u2014fourteen?\u201d \u201cThen you are?\u201d I sigh. \u201cCain isn\u2019t here. He left this morning to buy a phone and see some people.\u201d \u201cWhat people?\u201d \u201cI think he said his agent, but I\u2019m hoping he sees a lawyer too. Why are you trying to track him down?\u201d \u201cGuy stuff.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYou heard me.\u201d I can tell he\u2019s kidding but also that he does want to speak to Cain. \u201cHe\u2019s buying another cell phone today\u2014he said he\u2019d call me with the number,\u201d I offer. \u201cI could text it to you. Failing that, he\u2019ll probably come back here tonight.\u201d Whit thanks me. He sounds a little agitated. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d I venture carefully. He\u2019s already told me to mind my own business\u2014albeit in not so many words. \u201cNah\u2026just been under house arrest for too long. Getting a little stir crazy is all.\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s company you\u2019re after\u2014\u201d \u201cThanks, but that\u2019s okay.\u201d \u201cOnly Cain will do?\u201d I ask, bemused. \u201cYes.\u201d He hangs up. I don\u2019t remember that I am supposed to be driving up to Rockport with Leo and the other Fellows until Leo knocks on my door. He holds up a picnic basket. \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I realise it\u2019s snowing. These are snacks for the drive.\u201d \u201cOh, God, Leo, I\u2019m so sorry\u2014I forgot.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m five minutes early, so no damage. Grab your coat.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI can\u2019t go.\u201d His face falls. \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s so much going on\u2014I have to be here in case Cain\u2014\u201d \u201cBut we\u2019ve just been invited to luncheon by one the Sinclair Fellowship board members. You can\u2019t not go!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll have to take my regrets\u2014\u201d \u201cThe others are waiting downstairs, Freddie. They were looking forward to meeting you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll come down and meet them\u2014I can apologise in person.\u201d I feel dreadful. I don\u2019t want to stand Leo up, but how can I go out of town today? What if Cain called and\u2014I catch myself. Realise I\u2019m being pathetic. Waiting around in case someone needs me is not how I\u2019ve ever lived my life. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back today, right?\u201d \u201cSure. Rockport is only an hour\u2019s drive. We\u2019ll be back before dinner.\u201d I waiver for a moment. \u201cHonestly, Freddie. You\u2019ll be back by five\u2014basically a day at the office.\u201d He opens the basket so I can peer in. \u201cI made cookies.\u201d I can smell the veracity of his claim\u2026or at least that there are cookies. I relent. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch my coat.\u201d *** My dearest Hannah, What a splendid fellow Leo is! I am very pleased to give him my name. First the little things. In the States you\u2019d \u201cwipe down a counter\u201d rather than a bench. So, our Cain is not just an ex-con, but he has a motive for killing Caroline Palfrey as well as Shaun Jacobs! Of course he would have required an accomplice to pull it off, but accomplices are not impossible to acquire. One wonders why he was at the library at all\u2026surely it would have been better to be alibied in a bar across town? But then I suppose, if he\u2019d not been in the BPL, he would not have been able to at least hear his victim scream. And there is satisfaction in that\u2026though I imagine it would not come close to the completion of taking her life himself. Perhaps that\u2019s why he needed to stab Whit? So now the question is the identity of the accomplice. It has to be someone introduced at the outset. One of the security guards possibly or\u2026OH MY GOD\u2014LEO! I\u2019m not sure if I should be offended\u2026but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m delighted. And what a wonderful twist! But why should I be surprised. You are, after all, Hannah Tigone and I am Your Leo \n Chapter Twenty-Three Katerina Wolanski is from London, about fifty, tall, slim, and dressed entirely in black. She embraces me in greeting, kissing each cheek\u2014the left twice. She smells like gardenias. Dr. Briton Ibe is from Somalia. He\u2019s small, walks with a limp, and wears a bright yellow puffer jacket and a Cossack hat. His smile is broad and easy, his teeth incandescently white. I like them both immediately. Leo introduces us, by name and a sentence or two on our work. Katerina is writing a speculative novel set a thousand years in the future, and Briton, a political satire which comments on the hypocrisy of post-colonial diplomacy. They both seem excited to meet a mystery writer. Leo directs us to the car he\u2019s borrowed from one of the other residents of Carrington Square\u2014a Mercedes SUV with heated seats that recline electronically. \u201cSomeone lent you this?\u201d I gaze at the buttons on the console in the passenger door which control the precise height, angle, and temperature of the seat. \u201cMrs. Weinbaum,\u201d Leo confirms, grinning. \u201cShe drives this?\u201d The SUV is huge and Mrs. Weinbaum is tiny. Leo shrugs. \u201cApparently.\u201d Briton and Katerina have claimed the back seats. I climb into the front beside Leo and check my phone in case Cain has sent through a number. Leo waits until I put the phone back into my pocket. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d I nod, deciding to stop fretting. There will be time enough to talk to Cain, to ask him about Justine Dwyer\u2019s allegations. I don\u2019t doubt him, but I wonder. And I wish I could speak to him now, wish I\u2019d asked more, so that I had an answer for the detective. Leo marshals the conversation, subtly drawing out similarities between us in our work and our lives. Talking is easy and listening easier, and while I do not quite put Cain out of my mind, I am able to maintain enough social function to uphold my share of the exchange. As Leo promised, Rockport is about an hour from Boston. A little longer because the road is covered in snow and the journey is broken by a stop at Smith\u2019s Point to lunch with Chase Perkins, who is on the board of the Sinclair Fellowship, and his wife, Becca. We might in fact have lingered longer at the beautifully catered affair, chatting with our benefactors over delicious finger food, if Chase\u2019s golden retriever had not demolished the immaculately laid out meal while we were taking a tour of his house. We leave hungry but determined to write that overfed golden retriever into our manuscripts. Indeed, we make a pact to do so\u2014the shared motif of this year\u2019s Fellowship holders. We\u2019re still laughing about it when we arrive in Rockport. I take a photo of my companions in front of the famous red fish shack on the wharf. The cold has deterred enough tourists that it\u2019s not a picture of three people in a crowd. I laugh at Briton, who is jumping up and down to warm himself. Katerina does not feel the cold in the same way, but neither is she as taken with the winter townscape as I am. I have seen snow before, but on ski fields. There\u2019s a special magic to the way snow settles on the sail lofts and fish shacks of Artists\u2019 Row. Picture postcard and frozen in time. I am overwhelmed with a reminder that I am living in the U.S., writing, and I am amazed anew that this is my life. I won the fellowship with a story about Geraldine, and the kind of destructive grief left in the wake of shock, the long road to rebuilding family without her, the inconsolable rage of my mother, the withdrawal of my father, my determination to find sense and purpose where there was none. The resultant novella had been a kind of scream, pain and guilt and hope with a denouement of desperate and exhausted hope. That it had won the Sinclair had stunned me as much as anyone, and now, if I allow myself to think about it, I worry that it was all I had. There is no more pain to draw upon. Perhaps that\u2019s what Cain meant about his first novel. Though, clearly, what he expended was not something he wished to reharness. I loiter outside taking it all in while Leo leads Katerina and Briton into the gift shop. He doesn\u2019t try to persuade me to come with them into the warmth, whispering, \u201cIf I had my druthers, I\u2019d stay out here with you, but Briton\u2019s going to do himself a spinal injury if he keeps jumping around like that.\u201d \u201cYou go ahead,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI want to try and describe this to myself\u2026so I remember.\u201d He nods, understanding my need to lock the images in words, and escorts Briton and Katerina into the storefront. I walk down a driveway behind the building and onto the wharf. Someone has salted the ice on its surface so walking is not as treacherous as it might have been. The wind which blows in off the water is bitter and gusty. I can almost believe Gerry\u2019s standing beside me, seeing what I see, feeling the cold and tasting the faint salt in the air. I\u2019ve felt her presence often since I came to the U.S.\u2014it\u2019s almost as if she gave me the story that won the Sinclair so she could see this through my eyes. I can hear her laughing at me, mocking the fanciful need to conjure her, to find meaning in luck and fate. My phone rings, and I see Cain\u2019s name. I assume he has finally procured a new phone and am relieved at the luck of being alone to receive his call. Hastily, I pull off my glove and answer. \u201cHello\u2014Cain?\u201d A scream. Caroline\u2019s scream\u2026or Gerry\u2019s. I don\u2019t know anymore. \u201cWho are you?\u201d I shout into the phone. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Three, four, five beats and I begin to think the caller might speak, and I\u2019m terrified. And the call is ended. The ding of a text arriving. Again it tells me it\u2019s from Cain. A photograph of my door at Carrington Square. I stand there staring, horrified and angry and unsure what to do next. A second message alert. Cain\u2019s door now\u2026maybe. The same style and colour, but nothing about Cain\u2019s door is particularly distinctive. But it could be his. Distracted, I don\u2019t look up to see Leo approach, and so he is standing beside me with hot chocolate before I realise he\u2019s there. \u201cFreddie? I thought you might like\u2014is something wrong?\u201d I don\u2019t know what to say to him. I show him the texted images. I tell him about the scream, what had happened on the other occasions I\u2019d heard it. \u201cLeo, I think I need to go back\u2026now.\u201d Leo swallows. \u201cI had a few things planned for today\u2026\u201d \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a bus I could catch?\u201d He glances at his watch. \u201cNot for a couple of hours\u2026 You might as well\u2014\u201d \u201cI really have to get back.\u201d I suddenly feel trapped, forced to sightsee in Rockport while some lunatic stalks Cain. And irrationally, unfairly, I\u2019m angry with Leo for bringing me here. \u201cI promised Briton and Katerina a clam chowder lunch\u2014\u201d I snap. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Leo!\u201d Furious tears threaten to make me lose my grip entirely. \u201cPlease. I know I\u2019m ruining things, but if our places were reversed, I would help you!\u201d He looks down at me and nods slowly. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I reckon you would.\u201d He put the hot chocolate into my hand. \u201cYou drink this. I\u2019ll get Briton and Kat. You can ring the police on the way.\u201d I am utterly ashamed now that I shouted at him. I use the moments he\u2019s away to wipe away tears, to pull myself together. I\u2019m not sure what Leo\u2019s told Briton and Katerina, but they don\u2019t seem resentful or put out that I am cutting our excursion short. They emerge with souvenir red fish-shack T-shirts and novelty pens and floating crabs in snow globes. They look at me sympathetically. Leo suggests very tentatively that we grab sandwiches for the drive back since we won\u2019t be stopping for lunch, and I feel like the biggest jerk. \u201cLet me grab them,\u201d I plead. \u201cAn apology for wrecking the day. Does anyone have anything they don\u2019t eat?\u201d It turns out Briton is a vegetarian too, and Kat doesn\u2019t like eggs. I run into the diner on the corner and order two fried clam sandwiches, two egg salads on rye, and four servings of hand-cut fries to go before returning to the Mercedes. As we leave Rockport, I call Justine Dwyer and explain what has happened. I tell her what happened the last time I received similar messages and phone calls. She asks me for specifics. \u201cDid the scream sound like the last time?\u201d \u201cYes, exactly like the last scream. A woman\u2019s scream.\u201d \u201cAnd you\u2019re sure the second door is Mr. McLeod\u2019s?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut it could be his. To be honest I didn\u2019t really pay much attention to Cain\u2019s door, and there was nothing particularly memorable about it. It\u2019s just a door.\u201d \u201cOkay. Bring your phone in as soon as you get back to Boston. I\u2019ll send a car round to check on Mr. McLeod as a precaution.\u201d When I hang up there is an awkward silence in the car, and I realise that of course my companions all heard at least my side of the conversation. Briton and Katerina must be wondering what on earth I\u2019m involved in. And so I explain briefly\u2026about Caroline, the strange calls, and Whit being stabbed. Briton and Katerina listen, gasping and tsking occasionally. For some reason, I want to leave Cain out of it as much as possible, and so I don\u2019t mention Boo. Leo meets my eye, brow raised. He has an idea of what I have failed to mention. The moment disappears and Briton and Katerina ask questions and express concern about the rest, but I am aware that he knows. Regardless, he keeps his own counsel. Leo drives straight to the police station and runs around to open my door as I say goodbye to the others. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you inside,\u201d he says as I get out. \u201cThank you, but it\u2019s okay.\u201d I smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a police station\u2026I couldn\u2019t possibly be safer.\u201d Leo\u2019s sigh is uncommitted. \u201cI\u2019ll take these guys home and come back for you\u2026or what\u2019s left of you.\u201d I laugh. \u201cI\u2019m going in to make a complaint, not to turn myself in.\u201d I embrace him. \u201cThank you for today\u2026I am sorry I ruined it. Don\u2019t come back for me. I have no idea how long this will take, and I can take a train or catch an Uber home if Justine can\u2019t give me a ride.\u201d He frowns. \u201cJustine?\u201d \u201cDetective Dwyer.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t realise you were friends.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not. Barely first-name acquaintances.\u201d He relents. \u201cIf you need me to come get you, just call.\u201d \u201cThank you, Leo.\u201d The officer at the front desk takes me to an interview room and asks me to wait. Detective Dwyer comes in about five minutes later. \u201cIs Cain okay?\u201d I blurt as she walks in. \u201cI sent a car around to his apartment to wait for him. But there\u2019s been no sign of him.\u201d I\u2019m relieved\u2026I think\u2026 \u201cDo you have any idea where he might be, Winifred?\u201d \u201cHe was going to buy a new phone and call his mother and his agent\u2026or maybe he was going to see his agent. Perhaps that\u2019s where he is.\u201d \u201cDo you have a name for this agent?\u201d \u201cNo, but I expect his publishers would know.\u201d I show her the text images of the doors, and she takes the phone. I plead with her to copy the texts and return the cell. \u201cAll my friends and family have that number, and I\u2019ve already had to change it once.\u201d Justine has a word with a colleague before informing me that my request will be granted. I wait for about an hour while they do whatever it is they need to do, and my phone is returned. \u201cLook, Winifred, all we can determine is that the texts and the phone call were made from the cell that Cain McLeod claims to have lost.\u201d \u201cThat makes sense,\u201d I reply carefully. \u201cWhoever took the phone and sent me the warning last time\u2026\u201d \u201cWarning? You see it as a warning?\u201d I shrug. \u201cWhat else would it be?\u201d \u201cA threat.\u201d I concede. I don\u2019t want to argue about semantics. \u201cThe thing is, Winifred, you\u2019ve changed your number.\u201d Justine watches me carefully as she speaks. \u201cThat rules out any notion that this might be kids or pranksters.\u201d \u201cI never thought it was.\u201d \u201cWhoever made the calls had your number both times. The first time it would have been saved on McLeod\u2019s cell, but this time that\u2019s not the case. The call was made by someone who knew your number.\u201d I nod slowly. The logic is undeniable, the conclusion sickening. She places a notepad and pen before me. \u201cWinifred, I want you to write down everybody who has your new number. Don\u2019t leave anyone out, no matter how absurd you may think they may be as a potential suspect.\u201d I comply. The length of the list surprises me. It doesn\u2019t seem possible to give out your number so many times in a couple of weeks, but I have. To my family, naturally, and several people back home. Whit, Marigold, and Cain, of course, but also to Whit\u2019s father, Leo, the trustees of my fellowship, Joe, and the custodian at the Carrington, and several of my neighbours including Mrs. Weinbaum and her lawyers, the Boston Public Library, two different pizza delivery places, the Australian Embassy, and the Consulate. Finally, the Boston PD and Detective Justine Dwyer. Justine glances at the list. \u201cIf you think of anyone else\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll let you know immediately.\u201d Justine stands. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you home, check your apartment to be on the safe side, and have a word with your security man.\u201d I get to my feet, pleased the interview is finally over. I need to think, and I can\u2019t do that under the scrutiny of a detective. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure a patrol car keeps an eye on your building,\u201d Justine continues. \u201cAnd should Mr. McLeod get in touch, we would like to know immediately for the sake of his own safety.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2014\u201d \u201cIf these images are to be read as a warning or a threat, and given what happened to Mr. Metters on the last occasion, then Mr. McLeod could be in danger.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, I notice that you have not once in this novel made any reference to the global pandemic. I understand of course. We\u2019re all sick of it and all it entails. But I think it is the responsibility of writers to bear witness to the darkness as well as the light. Without any mention of the virus, your novel risks being dated before it\u2019s released. You could of course be setting this novel in the future, at a time when all this is behind us. But if you don\u2019t mind me saying so, that\u2019s exceedingly optimistic. I suspect that a world without disease will need to feature flying cars and victims dispatched by laser guns. Writing a contemporary novel without the pandemic is surely more fantasy than mystery. I\u2019m not suggesting you rewrite the entire book, just make an occasional nod to the fact that the world does not look like it did. In this last chapter, for example, Freddie and her colleagues would be careful to mask up. Freddie might choose between styles of masks rather than jackets. And you could illustrate the rising tensions between maskers and anti-maskers by having them witness an altercation between the two groups. In fact, pursuant to the suggestions in my last letter, the altercation could become fatal. I promise you it\u2019s not beyond the realms of plausibility that a masker would end being garroted with their own mask by someone from the opposite camp. Witnessing that level of violence might also bring home to Freddie the kind of man with whom she has become involved. It might give her a comparison as she runs over in her imagination the scene in which Cain thrust a knife into his stepfather\u2019s jugular. That must play over in her mind. Surely, she must think about that. Does it terrify her, or does she find it strangely exciting, erotic even? I think we need more of that in her internal monologue. Do not be afraid of taking your writing to dark places, my dear. The world is getting darker, and murder now needs to compete with disease, neglect, and the inherent selfishness of man. Yours, Leo \n Chapter Twenty-Four The search of my apartment does not leave the same upheaval it did at Cain\u2019s, but it is thorough. All rooms and closets, anywhere an intruder might be hiding. Leo ducks his head in, and I introduce him to Justine Dwyer. He doesn\u2019t stay long, or say anything, beyond bracing my shoulder and asking if I\u2019m okay. Justine speaks to the doorman on duty, who is not Joe today, warns him to be vigilant for any unauthorised visitors to Carrington Square, and asks him to ring her if he encounters anyone acting suspiciously. The man, whose name I can\u2019t remember, seems a little affronted by the idea that any undesirable would get past him. Once Justine has gone, I return to my apartment and bolt the door behind me. I\u2019m trying not to be too alarmed by the fact that Cain has not yet called. I think of all the reasons that he might not have done so, why he might have been delayed. I curl up on my couch and try to sort the befuddled, slightly panicked state of my mind. I woke up this morning with Cain. I remember the weight of his left arm resting across my shoulder, his right under the pillow, the contours of his face boyish in sleep. My thoughts linger on the scars on his body, punishment, violence, and an operation for appendicitis. And yet I am in awe that he is so undamaged. Not bitter or resentful. I rub my face and shake myself out of contemplation, aware I could spend the rest of the day thinking about Cain if I allowed myself to do so. I open my laptop and force my attention back to my manuscript. I write Justine Dwyer into the narrative. I had been planning to avoid reference to the police because it requires specialist knowledge about how they do things. But I suppose, now, I\u2019m acquiring that expertise, whether I like it or not. I sketch out my policewoman, ambitious, dedicated, by-the-book, but human. Her face is, despite the training, open and animated. She smiles when she says hello. She has a husband who likes to paint fantasy figurines, and three Siamese cats. The afternoon crawls into evening with me listening for Cain\u2019s call. My pulse jumps when the doorman\u2019s buzzer goes off. \u201cThere are two people for you, Miss Kincaid. They claim to be friends of yours. A Mr. Whit Metters and Ms. Marigold Anastas. Shall I send them up or call the police?\u201d \u201cPlease send them up\u2026Chris.\u201d I finally remember the occasional doorman\u2019s name. It comes out a little too loud as it breaks through the failure in my memory. I grimace, hoping it isn\u2019t too blatantly obvious. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Marigold asks as I open the door. \u201cWhy is the Gestapo checking everyone who comes into the Carrington?\u201d I bring them in and tell them about the call, and the text messages sent from Cain\u2019s old phone. Whit puts his arm around me. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d I nod. \u201cThe last time this happened, it was your door, and then you were attacked\u2014\u201d \u201cWhere is Cain?\u201d Marigold asks. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He was going to call me as soon as he\u2019d bought a new phone, but I haven\u2019t heard from him.\u201d Whit and Marigold glance at each other, and I see something unspoken and tentative pass between them. \u201cPerhaps he just lost your number,\u201d Whit says vaguely. \u201cI wonder why Cain didn\u2019t mention it was his mother who called the police,\u201d Marigold says slowly, \u201cwhy he didn\u2019t mention that she was there?\u201d \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d I ask sharply. I have not yet mentioned what Justine Dwyer told me. \u201cMarigold looked up the court records and read them,\u201d Whit says wearily. I can\u2019t tell if it is the reading of legal records per se, or their subject, about which he most disapproves. I stare at her. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand how he could go to jail for defending himself\u2014I thought I might find something that might help him.\u201d \u201cSomething that his lawyers missed?\u201d I challenge. Marigold smiles faintly. \u201cHave I mentioned that I am something of a genius?\u201d I refuse to allow her to lighten the discussion. \u201cCain\u2019s mother locked herself in her room while he was being attacked\u2014perhaps he didn\u2019t want us to think badly of her.\u201d \u201cNo, he locked her in and hid the key before his stepfather got home,\u201d Marigold says calmly. \u201cHe said he knew the mood his stepfather was in and was afraid his mother would try to protect him and take the brunt of it herself. They both claimed that Officer Manners was violent.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean claimed?\u201d I\u2019m getting angry now. \u201cOf course he was violent.\u201d Marigold grabs my hand. \u201cOf course. I didn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d She takes a deep breath. \u201cLook, Freddie, I decided to look up Cain\u2019s defence attorney in the hope they might be able to tell us why he was dealt with so harshly. According to the records, his attorney was Jean Le Marque from a firm called Hockey Cole.\u201d \u201cSo did you find her?\u201d Again Marigold\u2019s eyes meet Whit\u2019s. \u201cEventually. It took a bit of digging.\u201d \u201cWell.\u201d \u201cJean Le Marque still practises law, but she married and took her husband\u2019s name. She\u2019s now Jean Metters.\u201d I choke, turning immediately to Whit. \u201cYour mother? Cain\u2019s lawyer was your mother?\u201d I stand up, too agitated to remain still. Whit doesn\u2019t say anything. \u201cYes, Whit\u2019s mom.\u201d Marigold answers for him. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing Cain didn\u2019t mention.\u201d \u201cNeither did Whit\u2019s mom.\u201d Again it\u2019s Marigold, not Whit, who responds. \u201cIt was fifteen years ago, Freddie. He was one of thousands of cases she\u2019s defended, and Cain\u2019s changed his name. It\u2019s understandable she might not recognise him. It\u2019s a little harder to believe he\u2019d have no idea who she was.\u201d \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Marigold looks up at me as I pace. \u201cIt makes you wonder if us all meeting in the BPL the way we did\u2014Cain and Whit anyway\u2014whether it was really just a coincidence.\u201d I feel like I\u2019m reeling. The bus has crashed. \u201cDid you speak to Whit\u2019s mom?\u201d I ask finally. Whit shakes his head. \u201cNo. If she gets a sniff of who Cain is, she\u2019ll have him arrested for stabbing me.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d \u201cI know. I don\u2019t think he did,\u201d Whit says firmly. Too firmly. He\u2019s telling Marigold, who is obviously not so sure. I am outraged by her inconstancy. \u201cDon\u2019t hate me, Freddie,\u201d she pleads. \u201cI love Cain, you know I do. I simply don\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t tell us any of this. Whit\u2019s mom was his lawyer, for fuck\u2019s sake! But he didn\u2019t say a thing.\u201d I sit down and, for a moment, struggle for reasons. In the end I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Cain wanted to put that part of his life behind him. Perhaps he thought that since Whit\u2019s mom didn\u2019t recognise him, there was no point raising it. Or maybe he didn\u2019t recognise her either.\u201d Whit comes to my aid. \u201cMom\u2019s had a bit of work done in the last five years. I\u2019ve heard Dad say she looks more like the cat than the woman he married.\u201d I smile faintly, gratefully. Whit is still on Cain\u2019s side. It settles me a little and I think more clearly. Justine had not mentioned this. She\u2019d told me about the connection between Caroline Palfrey and Cain but not this. \u201cDo the police know?\u201d \u201cNot as far as we know,\u201d Marigold says. \u201cThey would presumably be protecting Whit\u2019s mom if they\u2019d worked it out.\u201d She swallows. \u201cWe haven\u2019t mentioned it.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cHonestly,\u201d Marigold says, rubbing a hand through the razor cut of her hair, \u201cbecause Whit won\u2019t let me.\u201d \u201cI think we should speak to Cain first.\u201d Whit sits back, relaxed. \u201cMaybe this is a coincidence. They do happen.\u201d \u201cThey do,\u201d I say uncertainly. \u201cYou hear about it all the time,\u201d Whit continues. \u201cTwins separated at birth who end up living on the same street.\u201d Marigold regards us both dubiously. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping Cain by refusing to acknowledge the obvious, you know.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not denying the facts, just the conclusion.\u201d I appeal to the Marigold who was sure that the four of us were special, that our friendship was one for the ages, a destiny in itself. \u201cYou can\u2019t think that Cain is capable of murder.\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she replies urgently. \u201cBut I also know my judgement is not infallible. Cain is charming and funny and handsome, but so was Ted Bundy.\u201d \u201cBundy!\u201d I am shocked by the comparison. \u201cYou think Cain is a serial killer?\u201d Marigold sighs. \u201cNo,\u201d she says patiently. \u201cNot necessarily. I only mean that you can\u2019t judge guilt or innocence by whether a person is likeable or not. Sociopaths are often charming; they know how to make you love them. But they don\u2019t operate by the same rules\u2014they don\u2019t feel remorse or guilt, they know how to manipulate people and situations.\u201d I groan. This is ridiculous. \u201cCain spent seven years in jail for defending himself. That hardly seems to be the result of a master manipulation!\u201d \u201cWhat do you want us to do?\u201d Whit asks me quietly. \u201cI\u2019m happy to go with your instincts on this, Freddie.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI know that this doesn\u2019t look good, but there will be an explanation. Whatever\u2019s going on, it\u2019s not Cain.\u201d My voice sounds loud, even to me. I recognise an underlying uncertainty in the volume, in the intractability of my declaration. And it terrifies me that I might be beginning to doubt Cain, and yet, I know I\u2019m in love with him. It\u2019s Marigold who breaks the silence that follows. \u201cOkay,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019ll proceed.\u201d She smiles, loyal and warm again. \u201cI\u2019m starving. Have you eaten?\u201d I shake my head, set off-balance by her sudden retreat. \u201cI\u2019ll fix us something. Do you mind if I poke about in your kitchen?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. Can I help\u2014\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be in the same room when I cook. It\u2019s not pretty.\u201d And so Marigold thumps around my kitchen while Whit and I sit in the living room. I direct him to the bottle of port on my bookshelf, and he distributes drinks. Marigold hums as she continues to clatter and thump. \u201cWhere do you think Cain is?\u201d Whit asks me. \u201cDo you want to go look for him?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d have no idea where to start,\u201d I reply, realising that above everything I am worried about Cain. His physical safety rather than any threat of prosecution. I have no right to expect he would call, except that he said he would. I smile at Whit, still grateful for his support, his trust in Cain. \u201cI think I\u2019m better waiting here for him.\u201d Whit nods. \u201cWhat about if I drive to his place after dinner? Have a look around for any sign of him. I\u2019ll call if I find him.\u201d I reach out and grab his hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, Are you setting up for Whit to pick up the pieces of Freddie\u2019s broken heart? But what about Marigold! Say it isn\u2019t so! Seriously, my friend, crime novels should observe a general morality. Characters should reap what they sow. Freddie has chosen to fall in love with a murderer\u2014she\u2019s done this knowingly. She should suffer the consequences. I can\u2019t help thinking that having Whit waiting in the wings is cheating. Perhaps my namesake is right and we are all writing romance. All the rules of fair play in love tell me that Freddie should not be able to be saved from her own choice. There\u2019s an increased police presence in the streets over here at the moment\u2014in response to the protests, I think, rather than the recent spate of murders by people other than the police. Tedious outrage about the natural order of things. Citizens in masks and police in number. It\u2019s a very strange new world. It makes me melancholy at times and, at others, exhilarated. I understand that it\u2019s still before Christmas for Freddie and co, Virus Eve, if you like, but I really think you\u2019re making a mistake. Although you started this story before the end game began, it seems such a waste not to take inspiration from the new order, not to have this book take place a little later so that you can bring in the ambient fear and the denial of our times. If you ask me, the current state of the world is the ideal cloak for a man of Cain\u2019s proclivities, the perfect cover for death delivered in other ways. And perhaps it will make Freddie\u2019s complicity more relatable\u2014after all what are a couple more bodies? I know you want to tell a story about friendship, love, and suspicion, that you don\u2019t want Freddie\u2019s bus to stop for the pandemic, but I say let the virus drive! And tell Freddie to stop flirting with Whit! Yours, Leo \n Chapter Twenty-Five Marigold serves up pizza made with flatbread rather than dough. Unable to find a pizza tray, she uses an ordinary oven tray and so the pie is rectangular, but it is delicious. We eat it with salad and wine, talking about ordinary things and feeling the absence of Cain\u2019s voice in our party\u2026 We are, as a group, off-kilter, out of balance. As we wash up, Whit mentions that he\u2019s going to look for Cain. I can see that Marigold wants to go with him. \u201cTake Marigold with you,\u201d I suggest. \u201cYou\u2019ve only just recovered. I\u2019d feel better knowing she was with you.\u201d \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Marigold asks. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m going to work and wait for Cain to call.\u201d Marigold wavers, but I insist. \u201cGo.\u201d \u201cYou know that what I said before doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care about\u2014\u201d \u201cOf course I know. Now go away and let me get back to work.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll find him,\u201d Marigold says earnestly. I embrace her because she needs to know that there are no hard feelings. And there aren\u2019t. Everything Marigold said was rational and sensible and well meant. I may have lost my heart to Cain, but I haven\u2019t lost my mind. I get back to work and try to get my bus back onto the road. My concentration is ragged, and now, alone in the quiet, I am able to at least acknowledge the fear that I have been taken for a ride, that I\u2019ve been an infatuated fool. For a while I cry, frustrated, humiliated, and scared that it doesn\u2019t change how much I still long for Cain. Preoccupied with my own misery, I barely register the call alert on my computer at first. I\u2019m not sure why I check it\u2014the last thing I want to do is to speak to someone, but I do open the app. The profile has no name or picture, but I can see now that the same number has attempted to connect with me three times. I accept the call and Cain\u2019s face appears on screen. He\u2019s outside. Somewhere reasonably well-lit because I can see him, the tree behind him, the people in the distant background. \u201cFreddie! Thank God.\u201d His expression changes. \u201cYou\u2019re crying. Oh, Freddie, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t call,\u201d I blurt, aware of how pathetic the words sound. \u201cFreddie, listen to me. The police tried to arrest me this morning after I left your place.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean tried?\u201d \u201cI guess I\u2019m a fugitive. I couldn\u2019t call you in case they\u2019d bugged your phone.\u201d \u201cWhy are they trying to arrest you?\u201d \u201cThey think I killed Caroline Palfrey and stabbed Whit.\u201d He takes a deep breath. \u201cApparently, Caroline was the granddaughter of the judge who sentenced me. I didn\u2019t know that, Freddie. I swear I didn\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cAnd Whit\u2019s mother?\u201d He\u2019s clearly startled. \u201cI recognised her at the hospital, but she didn\u2019t seem to know me. I couldn\u2019t say anything without telling you all everything, and so I said nothing.\u201d He closes his eyes. \u201cThat was a mistake.\u201d \u201cCain, what are you doing? You can\u2019t run from the police.\u201d \u201cI need to figure out what\u2019s going on, Freddie. Someone\u2019s setting me up\u2014as soon as I figure out who, and why, I promise, I\u2019ll turn myself in.\u201d I need to ask. \u201cCain, why did you lock your mother in her room?\u201d He blinks. \u201cBecause I expected my stepfather to give me a hiding that night, and I knew she would try to stop him, and then he\u2019d beat the hell out of her. I was trying to protect her.\u201d \u201cShe called the police.\u201d \u201cTo save me, not him.\u201d I pull myself together. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d He smiles wearily. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what I can do.\u201d \u201cWho would want to do this to you Cain? Someone from when you were in prison?\u201d \u201cAs far as I know, I didn\u2019t make any enemies. I kept my head down for the most part.\u201d \u201cWhat about the man who stabbed you?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s dead, Freddie.\u201d I don\u2019t ask Cain where he is, but I tell him that Whit and Marigold are out looking for him. \u201cThey know about all this?\u201d he asks. \u201cYes. They were just here\u2026Whit\u2019s completely on your side.\u201d \u201cBut not Marigold?\u201d \u201cShe thinks that you and Whit happening to meet on the day Caroline Palfrey was killed is too much of a coincidence.\u201d Cain says nothing for several beats and then, \u201cShe\u2019s right.\u201d He looks directly at the camera so I can see his eyes. \u201cFreddie, I swear, I didn\u2019t know who Whit was until I met his mother at the hospital.\u201d And I believe him. Because I\u2019m in love with him, and I don\u2019t want to believe I could love a murderer, but mostly just because I believe him. I\u2019m crying again because this is so impossible. \u201cMy God, Cain, what are we going to do?\u201d Cain waits for me to be ready. \u201cDo you think you could find out what you can about Caroline Palfrey?\u201d he asks in the end. \u201cThis all began with her\u2026with her scream. If we can figure about who might want to kill her, perhaps\u2014\u201d \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll find out what I can.\u201d I have no idea how, but that\u2019s irrelevant. I\u2019ll work it out. \u201cThat day when we all heard Caroline scream, did you just happen to go to the library?\u201d \u201cI use the library fairly regularly.\u201d He frowns as he tries to recall. \u201cThat day, I came in particularly to look through a book they\u2019d sourced for me. One of the librarians had called me that morning to say it was in.\u201d \u201cAnd was it?\u201d \u201cNo, actually. When I came in they couldn\u2019t find it. I went to the Reading Room while they tried to track it down. What are you thinking?\u201d \u201cIf the fact that you and Whit were in the Reading Room when Caroline screamed was not a coincidence, then someone must have organised for you both to be there.\u201d Cain exhales. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Maybe someone brought Whit to the BPL too.\u201d \u201cWhere are you going to sleep tonight, Cain?\u201d He smiles. \u201cI have somewhere to sleep, Freddie. Don\u2019t worry about me\u2026I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I don\u2019t ask him where. I need to be able to say I don\u2019t know where he is. \u201cThere\u2019s a nine o\u2019clock feature at The Brattle tomorrow,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll watch for you.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t that risky?\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t see me it\u2019s because I\u2019ve spotted a cop.\u201d I nod, already looking forward to seeing him, to being able to touch him. \u201cWhat are you going to do, Cain? Tomorrow, I mean.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to see if anyone knows anything about Boo\u2014who might have killed him, who may have had a grudge. There\u2019s something that connects all of this\u2026some reason for it all. I just have to find it.\u201d \u201cIs there anything I can bring you tomorrow?\u201d He looks embarrassed. \u201cI can\u2019t use any of my cards with the police watching for\u2014\u201d I cut him off before he has to ask. \u201cNo problem\u2026I have a pile of cash I haven\u2019t banked.\u201d He grimaces. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Freddie.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d I smile. \u201cA late-night tryst with a desperate fugitive\u2014what writer worth her salt wouldn\u2019t give her eye teeth for that kind of material?\u201d He laughs. \u201cYour manuscript frightens me a little. How\u2019s it shaping up?\u201d For a few minutes we talk about my work in a way that is surreal for its ordinariness. He says good night quietly, warning me to be careful. And when the screen closes, I sit for a while, feeling wrapped in him, savouring this sensation, the warm intensity of it, despite the circumstances. I\u2019m a little surprised by the totality of my trust in Cain McLeod, my conviction that he is innocent. The writer in me observes my own reactions with a kind of distance. Is this faith based on instinct, a judgement of Cain\u2019s character? It makes sense that I would love a man I believe in, surely. But does being in love compromise that judgement? It\u2019s a bit of a chicken and egg argument\u2014unanswerable and pointless. The fact is that I believe Cain, and I\u2019m in love with him. There may be a causal link between the two, but that would not make either any less true. I pull an unused Japanese notebook from the shelf above the writer\u2019s desk in the drawing room. The pages of the notebook are made of a single sheet, concertina-folded. I generally use them after the novel is written, to map out the narrative so that I can see the whole story in a glance and make sure that those threads that need tying up are in fact tied up. Now I plot everything I know from before and since the scream, drawing lines of connection between events and people. Lines between Cain and Boo, Cain and Caroline, Cain and Whit, Whit and Caroline, Marigold and Whit. It begins to resemble one of Cain\u2019s story webs. Beside the details of the night Boo attacked Cain, I draw a box, and into it I write in what I can recall of what Boo said. The words which have set seed in my mind. \u201cDoes she know what you\u2019ve done?\u201d He must have been talking about Cain killing his stepfather. I hadn\u2019t known then, of course. And there was something else\u2014what was it? He said \u201cI\u2019ve done it again\u201d or words to that effect. I remember that Cain said once that Boo slept near the Boston Public Library. Could he have killed Caroline? It\u2019s possible, I guess, but while he might have struck out as he did the night he hit Cain with a bottle, I can\u2019t see him committing careful murder, one in which he managed to hide the body and himself in a matter of seconds. And how would Boo have known about Whit\u2019s mother, or orchestrated the presence of Whit and Cain in the Reading Room? I find myself pondering Marigold. Is she somehow connected to Cain\u2019s past as well, or is she, like me, a random bystander who happened to choose a seat beside impending turmoil? I think about Marigold\u2019s determination that the four of us were destined to be friends, her offer to help Cain research Isaac Harmon, and the manner in which she\u2019s researched Cain himself. And a little part of me begins to wonder. Could her interest be more than a natural exuberant nosiness? The thought makes me feel disloyal. No. If Marigold, too, is connected to Cain, then she, like the men, was manipulated into being in the Reading Room that day. I open the notebook I was using back then and glance over my first notes of Handsome Man, Heroic Chin, and Freud Girl. And there it is. A speculation that Heroic Chin was stalking Freud Girl or vice versa. I force myself to relax, deciding to trust that first instinct: Marigold was in the library because she\u2019d followed Whit, taken a seat near him in the hope a conversation, a friendship, perhaps a relationship would begin. It had worked, in part. It\u2019s late. I should go to bed, probably to lie awake and toss and turn and think, but at least in a bed. I notice the folded piece of paper that has been slipped under my front door. It\u2019s from Leo, a note that hopes that I\u2019m over the shock of the text messages and that I feel safe, written with his usual charm, his old-world thoughtfulness. He offers a sympathetic ear and red wine, should I need to talk. Instead, I call my parents. We are no longer the type of family that has long conversations about the meaning of life or the meaning of anything at all. A strange detachment set in after Geraldine died. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t love each other\u2014we do\u2014but that our lives don\u2019t seem particularly entwined or reliant on one another anymore. We never bother to tell each other about hopes or dreams, nor do we ever touch upon disappointments and fears. Our conversations stay in that safe, removed middle ground, and we talk to each other like someone is listening. They ask about the weather, I tell them about the cold. They mention they\u2019ve bought a new car, and I enquire about make, model, and colour. There\u2019s comfort in the banality of the conversation. Like the ticking of a clock, metered and unchanged by the mayhem into which it sounds. *** Dear Hannah, She\u2019s giving him money? To quote my friend Marigold, CHRIST on a bike! With respect to your request, fair enough. I do know what you look like. I have for years because, of course, you\u2019re famous! But it is probably time to even the scales. I have attached what is referred to in modern parlance as a selfie, taken in all my masked glory. The baseball cap adds a certain redneck chic and, according to the American film industry, makes the wearer invisible. I like to think of this as my bank-robbing outfit. Please send the next chapter forthwith! Yours, Leo \n Chapter Twenty-Six I am at Leo\u2019s door, though it\u2019s not yet eight in the morning. He answers in his jogging gear. \u201cFreddie! What a pleasant surprise. Come on in.\u201d I step inside and begin as he fetches mugs and pours coffee. \u201cLeo, I need your help.\u201d \u201cWell, of course. What can I do you for?\u201d \u201cDo you remember when you took me to Magazine Park? There was a journalist there taking photos\u2014\u201d \u201cLauren.\u201d \u201cYes. She works for the Rag, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, she does.\u201d \u201cI was wondering if you could introduce me.\u201d \u201cTo Lauren? Why?\u201d I inhale slightly and begin the story I\u2019ve prepared. \u201cCaroline Palfrey worked on the Rag. I\u2019ve decided to write a piece on her murder for a paper back home\u2014an \u2018Australian in America\u2019 type piece. I thought someone who worked with her might be able to tell me a little about her.\u201d \u201cWhy do you need to know about Caroline for a piece about your experiences in the U.S.?\u201d \u201cBecause being in the library, hearing her scream changed everything about my time here. I want to use her as a symbol of America at its most aspirational cut down by the violence which runs through it.\u201d I hold my breath, hoping that it sounds plausible enough. Leo nods slowly. \u201cIs your novel not going well?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s stalled a bit. I\u2019m hoping writing this article might unblock me a little\u2026 And a decent newspaper feature will give me a profile as a writer.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s not a dumb idea.\u201d \u201cThe only problem is I don\u2019t have an in of any sort. I want to write Caroline as a real person rather than just a victim\u2014and to do that, I need to know who she really was.\u201d Leo studies me, and I hope the guilt doesn\u2019t show. It\u2019s not that I think he won\u2019t help me if I tell him the truth\u2014I\u2019m reasonably sure he would. And then he, too, would be involved. While I am more than willing to risk my own freedom in helping Cain, it would not be fair to drag Leo into this. \u201cSo I was hoping you might be able to ask Lauren if she\u2019d be willing to talk to me.\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I guess I could. And I reckon she\u2019d talk to you. You might need to talk to her too, though. She\u2019ll probably be real interested in what you heard at the library.\u201d \u201cSure, that seems fair,\u201d I reply, confident that I can tell her enough without compromising Cain. \u201cI\u2019ll give her a call.\u201d I smile sheepishly. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could call her now?\u201d \u201cWhat? Right this minute?\u201d I nod. \u201cThe muse,\u201d I explain. \u201cI want to begin before she leaves in a huff.\u201d Grinning, he picks up his phone. \u201cLauren? It\u2019s Leo. I\u2019m sorry to call so early\u2026 What are you doing this morning?\u2026 I have a friend I\u2019d like you to meet. We thought we might take you for breakfast. Sure\u2026you choose the place. The Friendly Toast? Yes, ma\u2019am. Nine o\u2019clock? We\u2019ll see you there.\u201d He hangs up with a triumphant flourish. \u201cThank you, Leo. I won\u2019t forget this.\u201d \u201cIt was a phone call, Freddie.\u201d \u201cStill, thank you.\u201d He checks his watch. \u201cGo grab your coat. We\u2019d better head off.\u201d The Friendly Toast is a popular breakfast venue in Back Bay. The decor is modern, the colour scheme primary. Lauren Penfold is already there when we arrive. She is dressed casually, jeans, a fisherman\u2019s sweater, and a knit cap over long, dark hair. A khaki down jacket hangs over the back of her chair. She smiles, kisses Leo\u2019s cheek, and shakes my hand warmly. Leo introduces me in grand fashion as the embodiment of all Australia\u2019s literary hopes and the holder of the Sinclair Fellowship. I tell Lauren to ignore him and call me Freddie. We order French toast on Lauren\u2019s urging, and I tell her about my interest in Caroline Palfrey, and its fabricated cause. \u201cI thought you guys might be able to help each other,\u201d Leo says. \u201cLauren, Freddie met the homeless man who was murdered near the boathouse, and you could tell her about Caroline.\u201d I\u2019m a little startled by this barter on my behalf, but I keep that to myself. \u201cSure,\u201d Lauren says. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d \u201cWhat kind of stories did Caroline write for the Rag?\u201d Lauren rolls her eyes. \u201cCaroline was a serious feature writer\u2026fancied herself a future contender for a Pulitzer.\u201d \u201cWas she working on anything in particular?\u201d \u201cSome secret project with Whit Metters\u2026though I\u2019m not sure they were exactly simpatico.\u201d Whit? \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cShe was a lot more serious about it than he was. But then, Whit\u2019s not really serious about anything.\u201d Lauren\u2019s smile broadens unconsciously when she says his name. \u201cThey were an item for a while, weren\u2019t they?\u201d I venture tentatively. \u201cYes, but I think Caroline was too ambitious for Whit.\u201d She lowers her voice. \u201cWhit\u2019s a bit of a slut. There were always half a dozen girls calling the Rag looking for him. Occasionally, he\u2019d pretend he was with Caroline to get rid of them\u2026 Some of them were a bit crazy.\u201d I don\u2019t react, and Leo does not give me away, though he knows that Whit is my Heroic Chin, that he is my friend. And for his discretion I\u2019m grateful. \u201cDo you know who these girls were?\u201d Lauren snorts. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Whit, though I can\u2019t guarantee he\u2019ll know their names. He\u2019s one of those guys that has groupies. Some kind of animal magnetism, I suppose\u2014the boy that puppies follow home.\u201d \u201cDo you think Caroline might still have had feelings for Whit?\u201d \u201cI doubt it\u2026\u201d She stops and reconsiders. \u201cMaybe. She was always bailing him out of trouble.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of trouble?\u201d \u201cJust stupid things. Whit was always trying some mad scheme or other\u2026nearly got kicked off the Rag I don\u2019t know how many times. Caroline would stick up for him, talk the editor into giving him another chance.\u201d \u201cSo they were good friends, at least?\u201d I ask, perplexed that Whit would keep this from us. \u201cI guess.\u201d Lauren grimaces. \u201cI didn\u2019t really hang out with either of them. Caroline was a bit stuck-up, and Whit was barely around\u2026which is why we found ourselves taking messages from the poor girls who imagined it was true love.\u201d \u201cCan you think of anyone who might have wanted to kill Caroline?\u201d Leo asks. \u201cWould any of these girls have\u2014?\u201d \u201cKilled Caroline? For Whit?\u201d She raises her brow sceptically. \u201cWho knows? The heart wants what it wants, I suppose.\u201d I\u2019m jarred by the memory of Marigold using those exact words. But there is also a growing sense that this means something, that it could lead somewhere. \u201cHave the police spoken to you about this, Lauren?\u201d \u201cNot this specifically,\u201d she replies, regarding me sharply. \u201cThey wanted to know what Caroline was working on for the Rag, whether there was a story on drug cartels or something that might have got her killed. They spoke to Whit directly, but I can\u2019t imagine he told them he was a player and Caroline was his front.\u201d Harshly put. \u201cYou don\u2019t like Whit Metters?\u201d Lauren shrugs. \u201cI felt a little sorry for some of the girls.\u201d It\u2019s my turn to answer questions now. I tell Lauren about Boo, what he looked like, the way he talked, his volatility, that he slept near the Boston Public Library, though I wasn\u2019t sure exactly where. I leave out mention of Cain. Again, Leo must realise this, but he doesn\u2019t call me on the omission. Lauren takes notes. She and Leo talk about the boathouse, the details of the crime scene, which he clearly remembers better than I. \u201cSo what exactly are you writing, Lauren?\u201d Leo asks in the end. \u201cA cautionary riches-to-rags story,\u201d she says. \u201cShaun Jacobs, more recently known as Boo, was a doctor\u2014a surgeon\u2014once. He started taking painkillers, which became a full-blown habit. Lost everything, kicked the addiction in prison only to return to it and ended up a corpse on the banks of the Charles.\u201d \u201cFreddie?\u201d Leo is looking at me. \u201cAre you okay? You\u2019ve just gone white.\u201d \u201cYes\u2026I\u2019m fine.\u201d I scramble for composure. \u201cI think I might have had a few too many coffees today.\u201d It\u2019s nonsense, of course. I could mainline coffee with no reaction. I smile. \u201cIt sounds like a great story, Lauren. It could be a book, really.\u201d She frowns. \u201cOf course I only write novels,\u201d I add hastily, in case she thinks I might steal the idea. Leo scoffs. \u201cI admit it\u2019ll make a great article. A surgeon\u2019s fall from grace\u2026but a book? Where\u2019s the romance, the sexual tension?\u201d Lauren laughs, and any territorial awkwardness passes. We finish breakfast, and I try not to be noticeably quiet, though I am preoccupied with what I\u2019ve learned. I need to be alone to think about it properly, when I can allow what I feel to show without fear of being found out. It\u2019s nearly eleven by the time we return to Carrington Square and another half hour before I can take my leave of Leo without appearing rude or ungrateful. I bolt the door, let out all the breath in my lungs, and then gasp for air. Shaun Jacobs was a surgeon. Could he have been the surgeon who stabbed Cain? Surely Cain\u2019s past could not include two fallen surgeons? Maybe I\u2019m wrong\u2026perhaps surgeons are predisposed to criminality. Maybe it\u2019s not unusual to find them in prisons assaulting fellow inmates. But if it was Boo, why did Cain leave that out? Why would he not mention that? I put on a pot of coffee, more because I need to do something, slow down my thoughts with something ordinary. I find the Japanese notebook in which I tried to plot what was happening earlier, and turn to my notes on the night Cain and I encountered Shaun Jacobs. I close my eyes\u2014it\u2019s still vivid in my memory. Cain remained so calm throughout. Surely he wouldn\u2019t have been if he knew the man was capable of plunging a knife into his back. I think about Cain\u2019s scar. I can almost feel it under my fingers. Raised, no more than two inches wide, and perfectly straight. A clean wound, precisely placed, and healed without infection. And in the exact place that Whit was stabbed. I shake my head. Why would Shaun Jacobs stab Whit? I\u2019m overthinking this. It\u2019s just a coincidence. I return to my laptop and spend a couple of hours going over what I\u2019ve already written, correcting typos, inserting missing words and, of course, commas. It makes me feel like I\u2019m doing something useful without demanding a great deal by way of concentration. It works, in part. Marigold calls by at about three. Her face is flushed, her eyes bright and her smile contagious. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask, smiling too. \u201cWhat have you won?\u201d \u201cNothing\u2026everything.\u201d She grabs my hands and pulls me towards the couch to sit with her. I laugh, happy for her, though I have no idea why she is so happy. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Marigold?\u201d \u201cYou know Whit and I went looking for Cain last night.\u201d \u201cDid you find him?\u201d \u201cOf course not. We would have called.\u201d \u201cThis is a lot of joy for a failed quest.\u201d \u201cFreddie, Whit and I, well we\u2026 He came back to my place afterwards.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d Suddenly we\u2019re teenagers, and Marigold is telling me about a first kiss, the incomparable exhilaration of love returned, and the glory of the often imagined, taking flesh. And she is so, so happy. For a while I\u2019m swept away in the flood of her excitement. \u201cYou and Whit?\u201d She nods vigorously. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d In the back of my mind I can hear Lauren Penfold telling me about the girls who would ring for Whit. The broken hearts who called the Rag, to be pitied by his colleagues. But who am I to sow doubt into Marigold\u2019s happiness? I listen as she tells me the details of her evening, every loaded glance and utterance that ended with her and Whit in each other\u2019s arms. I am drawn in by her guileless elation. Marigold holds nothing back, reserves nothing for caution or dignity. Surely Whit can see this, surely he is a charmed by it as I am. Surely this unmitigated love of hers will not lead to disaster. \u201cWhere is Whit?\u201d I ask when her praise of him finally slows long enough for me to get a word in. \u201cHe went looking for Cain again.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cHe wanted to go alone. Said I should check on you.\u201d I want to tell Marigold it\u2019s okay, that Cain has called me and he\u2019s alive, and for the moment safe, but I don\u2019t. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m aiding and abetting a fugitive, or at least I will be. There\u2019s no need for Marigold and Whit to break the law too\u2014yet, anyway. So I say nothing. \u201cHas Cain called you?\u201d Marigold asks. \u201cMy phone hasn\u2019t rung all day.\u201d \u201cOh, Freddie, I\u2019m so sorry. Men can be bastards!\u201d I change the subject. \u201cMarigold, that day at the library, when we all first met\u2026\u201d \u201cWhen Caroline was killed?\u201d \u201cYes. Why were you there? Honestly?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cDid you just happen to come to the library that day?\u201d Marigold blushes. \u201cI suppose it doesn\u2019t matter now. I followed Whit.\u201d She hugs a cushion in front of her as she confesses. \u201cI was following him\u2026\u201d \u201cYou were stalking him?\u201d \u201cNo\u2026well, maybe\u2026 I was trying to run into him.\u201d She swallows. \u201cI followed him to the Reading Room and sat down opposite him, hoping that he\u2019d talk to me or that I\u2019d have a reason to talk to him.\u201d \u201cAnd then Caroline screamed.\u201d \u201cYes. We might never have spoken to each other if not for that.\u201d \u201cDo you know why Whit was in the Reading Room that day?\u201d Marigold shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 Maybe he was working on a story for the Rag. I\u2019ve never known him to go to the BPL before. I remember being surprised when he went that way.\u201d I tap my finger on the arm of the couch. Could Whit, too, have been lured to the Reading Room that day? But it was more than that. Whit and Cain were sitting beside each other. \u201cMarigold, do you remember if Cain was already there when you arrived or if he sat down after the two of you did?\u201d She frowns and then shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t remember, Freddie. I know you arrived last and spent a lot of time looking at the ceiling.\u201d I smile, recalling how this all started. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying to work out if it was a coincidence that Whit and Cain ran into each other\u2026or if someone orchestrated it.\u201d \u201cHow might they orchestrate it?\u201d \u201cThey could ask both Whit and Cain to meet them there, for example,\u201d I reply vaguely. \u201cBut why?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t really know. But I\u2019m a writer. I mistrust coincidence as an explanation for anything,\u201d Marigold concedes. \u201cWe can ask Whit at dinner tonight.\u201d \u201cDinner?\u201d \u201cYes. Whit says there\u2019s an amazing Dominican restaurant in Roxbury, so we thought we\u2019d go tonight. We can check on Cain\u2019s apartment again while we\u2019re there.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t come,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cYou and Whit.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve just discovered each other. I\u2019m not going to be a third wheel.\u201d \u201cBut we can\u2019t leave you on your own!\u201d \u201cMarigold, I\u2019m fine. I have work to do, and there\u2019s a chance that Cain will come here. I want to be here in case he does.\u201d Marigold\u2019s looks at me sympathetically. \u201cHoney, you can\u2019t sit here waiting for Cain forever.\u201d I laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s one night, not forever. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Marigold. I\u2019m so happy for you and Whit, but I really don\u2019t want to come tonight. You should have some time together.\u201d She studies me intently, and for a moment I think she\u2019s going to continue her crusade to have me join them. But she relents. \u201cYou\u2019ll say if you change your mind?\u201d \u201cI promise.\u201d \u201cOkay\u2026I have a favour to ask.\u201d She looks embarrassed. \u201cCould I borrow a dress? I don\u2019t own one, and I thought I should wear a dress tonight\u2026just because\u2026I could buy one but\u2014\u201d I grab her hand to stop her blithering. \u201cOf course. But Marigold, you don\u2019t have to wear a dress. Whit clearly likes the way you look.\u201d \u201cI want him to know that I can look less\u2026out of place,\u201d she says earnestly, and I am reminded that she is only twenty-three. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s beguiled with the fact that you don\u2019t look like everybody else, but if it makes you feel any better, my wardrobe is your wardrobe.\u201d Marigold spends the next hour trying on everything I own in various combinations. In the end she chooses my most conservative wool skirt suit. I rarely wear it myself, reserving it for job interviews. Paired with Marigold\u2019s close-cropped hair and body piercings, the tattoos visible at her collarbone, it\u2019s strikingly incongruent but strangely alluring. \u201cI can say with absolute certainty that this outfit has never looked so good on me.\u201d \u201cI feel like a princess,\u201d Marigold says, swirling. She actually looks more like an edgy librarian, but if she feels like a princess, fair enough. \u201cAre you sure you won\u2019t come?\u201d she asks at the door. \u201cAbsolutely sure. You two have fun.\u201d *** My dear Hannah, I\u2019m embarrassed. How could I ever have questioned the moral integrity of your work? I\u2019m very happy for Marigold and a little jealous of Whit. This last chapter was what I call the \u201cyes, of course\u201d moment. Yes, of course Whit is in love with Marigold. How could he not be? It all seems more real now. I should never have doubted you. With my abject apologies, Leo PS\u2014\u201ccalls by\u201d is an Australianism. Americans would say \u201cdrops in.\u201d PPS\u2014I note you\u2019ve aged Marigold a bit to account for her being a postgraduate. \n Chapter Twenty-Seven It\u2019s only after Marigold has gone that I think about the police. Detective Dwyer saw Cain leave my apartment. If they\u2019re looking for him, they\u2019ll be watching Carrington Square. I curse. I now want so badly to see Cain. But I know that if I leave at eight thirty for The Brattle, they\u2019ll follow me straight to Cain. That can\u2019t happen. There\u2019s no way I can leave Carrington Square without being seen, but perhaps if I were not here, if I was leaving from somewhere else. I step into the bathroom for a three-minute grooming. Teeth, a hasty check that my hair is not too unruly and a smear of lip gloss. From my bedroom I grab the nearly five hundred dollars in cash stashed in my sock drawer\u2014cash I exchanged before I moved to the U.S. but somehow never used\u2014and slip it into the inside pocket of my navy overcoat. Gloves, scarf, wallet. I glance at the Boston Red Sox cap hanging on the coat rack and think fleetingly of all the recent American films in which a character is rendered invisible by donning a baseball cap. Would that it were true. But I suspect it might be slightly more difficult than that to ensure I\u2019m not followed. I leave my phone behind because I\u2019m not sure if it can be used by the police to track me. Leo comes out of his door as I\u2019m heading for the stairs. \u201cFreddie, hello. Where are you off to?\u201d I smile and wait for him to catch up. \u201cI\u2019m going shopping.\u201d \u201cRetail therapy? Excellent. I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d \u201cNo, you can\u2019t!\u201d Leo pulls back, clearly startled by the force with which I refused his offer. \u201cI\u2019m shopping for underwear. It\u2019s the kind of thing a girl does best alone.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to spend the entire evening shopping for panties?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very particular. And there are also items of corsetry\u2026they need to be fitted. It\u2019s not an expedition suited to company.\u201d He holds up his hands in surrender. \u201cWell, then I wish you a successful quest.\u201d He pauses. \u201cHow\u2019s your article coming?\u201d \u201cArticle?\u201d \u201cOn Caroline Palfrey?\u201d \u201cOh, yes\u2026okay, I think. I need a break from it\u2026and I need underwear\u2026So two birds.\u201d \u201cWell, let me know if you need a proofreader.\u201d \u201cI will.\u201d I feel suddenly guilty about brushing him off. \u201cI need to thank you properly for introducing me to Lauren\u2026 Let me take you out for lunch on Saturday.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI\u2019d be delighted to break bread with you anytime, Freddie, but you\u2019ve already thanked me, and it was no big thing anyway.\u201d \u201cYou really are a lovely man, Leo. Let\u2019s do Saturday. We\u2019ll discuss the progress of our respective romance manuscripts.\u201d He turns to walk back to his door. \u201cBe careful, Freddie. I don\u2019t need to tell you there\u2019s a murderer on the loose.\u201d I leave Carrington Square aware of the police car parked across the street. I presume there are a couple of officers on foot somewhere too. I have with me a backpack. It contains the change of clothes Cain left in my apartment, which I\u2019d laundered the day before, an extra muffler, a razor, some basic toiletries, and several bars of chocolate. I try not to be self-conscious and head for the Back Bay subway station on Dartmouth. At this time it\u2019s particularly busy with people heading home at the end of the workday or coming downtown for dinner. I spend a few minutes browsing in the small shops outside the front entrance. I purchase a couple of apples from the tiny vegetable market and generally merge into the concentration of people. I stop to give money to one of the street people hanging about the station. He thanks me and I wonder if Cain ever begged here. I feel guilty as I walk on because I\u2019m walking on, because I don\u2019t know what else to do. Slipping back into the crowd past the Amtrak depot, I pick up my pace. My Charlie card is in my hand ready to tap at the ticket gates. I spot my tail. Middle-aged, a little portly, leather jacket. He\u2019s about twenty feet behind me and has had to abandon keeping out of sight in order to keep up with me. My heart is pounding. There\u2019s something about being followed, even when you know the person in pursuit means you no harm, that makes you want to run. I suppress the instinct because increasing my pace will only draw attention and make me more visible. I step onto the escalators and descend to the Orange Line subway tracks. The platform is packed as I make my way into the middle of the press of people. Still, I catch sight of Portly Leather Jacket pounding down the escalators. I wait until a train pulls into the platform, until his eyes are fixed on those boarding; I take off my coat and run up the stairs and leave the station entirely via the bus depot. From there I make a dash for the Copley subway station. I think I\u2019m clear, but to be on the safe side, I hop onto the next train from the Green Line. It\u2019s difficult to keep the smile off my face. I just shook a police tail! It\u2019s absurd, but I feel proud. I alight at Park Street Station and transfer to the Red Line, getting off again at Harvard Square. The Brattle is busy. The nine o\u2019clock feature is An Affair to Remember. The theatre is full of couples of every age. It feels a little strange to be walking in alone. I take my popcorn, trying hard not to look around for Cain, and find a seat in an unpopular row. I remove my coat and place it onto the seat next to me, hoping nobody will object. Nobody does. I suppose lots of couples meet at the theatre. And I wait. The house lights dim. \u201cDo you mind if I sit here?\u201d It\u2019s all I can do not to leap out of my seat and throw my arms around Cain. He picks up my coat and sits down. My hand is in his, and his lips are on mine as the opening credits roll. \u201cWe\u2019ll slip out in about half an hour,\u201d he whispers into my ear. I nod, happy to be near him again. My questions will wait. Here in the dark anonymity of the theatre I feel hidden and safe. About forty minutes into the film, Cain and I make our way out into the dazzling light of The Brattle\u2019s foyer. He helps me on with my coat, takes the backpack for me, and we walk up the steps into Brattle Street. The night is cold and damp. Cain still has my hand. \u201cCome on, I know somewhere we can talk.\u201d Zoe\u2019s is on Mass Avenue about half a mile from the Brattle. Large and busy. Rows of booths with red vinyl upholstery, a dozen waiters and waitresses, extensive menus. We take one of the inside booths, away from the window. Cain orders a burger; I choose a bagel with cream cheese. We\u2019re blandly pleasant in our conversation with the waitress, giving her nothing of note to remember. The food arrives almost immediately with bottomless cups of coffee and a jug of water. Under the bright lights of the diner, Cain looks weary. I reach across the table and lace the fingers of my right hand with those of his left. For a few beats we just look at each other. I start. \u201cAre you okay? You look exhausted.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep well. But I\u2019m fine.\u201d I resist asking him where he slept. I tell him about Lauren Penfold and Caroline\u2019s work on the Rag. \u201cShe and Whit were working on a joint project, apparently. He seems to have known her better than I thought.\u201d \u201cIt might explain why the police interrogated him initially.\u201d He frowns. \u201cI wonder if that\u2019s why he was stabbed. Could they have been working on something that put them both into danger?\u201d \u201cThe FBI came to see Whit in hospital. Perhaps that\u2019s why.\u201d I swallow. \u201cCain, Lauren Penfold also mentioned that Shaun Jacobs had been a surgeon.\u201d He stares at me for moment. \u201cYes,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cShe\u2019s right. When I was moved to the adult facility, Boo was there. I\u2019m not sure what he\u2019d been doing in North Carolina at all, let alone what he\u2019d done to land him in prison, but he was there. He\u2019d been inside for over a year by then, so he was sober.\u201d \u201cAnd he stabbed you.\u201d \u201cOn direction.\u201d Cain\u2019s hand tightens around mine. \u201cBoo had aligned himself with a prisoner called Conroy, who basically ran things. Conroy had him take me out. They cornered me. Boo told me if I didn\u2019t struggle or move he could stab me in the back and I would survive. It would hurt, but I would be okay. If I fought, there were no guarantees.\u201d \u201cSo you let him stab you?\u201d \u201cNo, I fought like crazy. But Boo waited until the others had pinned me properly.\u201d He laughs quietly. \u201cHe always claimed he\u2019d saved my life.\u201d \u201cBut why? Why did this man Conroy want him to stab you?\u201d \u201cI really honestly don\u2019t know, Freddie. I\u2019d offended him somehow\u2026or it may not have been about me.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWhen I arrived, Boo tried to look out for me\u2026for Isaac\u2019s sake. He recognised me as the kid who had been Isaac\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 for a couple of weeks. Conroy may have been testing Boo\u2019s loyalty to him.\u201d \u201cOh, God!\u201d He lifts my hand to his lips. \u201cIt was long time ago, Freddie.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me it was Boo?\u201d \u201cBecause I was trying to seduce you.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to talk about my prison scars.\u201d I shake my head and pull my hand away. \u201cFreddie, I\u2019m sorry\u2026Freddie\u2026look at me, please.\u201d His eyes are very bright. \u201cEver since Caroline died, I\u2019ve felt like my past is trying to suck me back in. I didn\u2019t want to lie to you, I didn\u2019t think I had\u2026\u201d \u201cYou left a lot out.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot I\u2019m trying to leave behind.\u201d He reaches for my hand again. \u201cBut I am sorry. I never wanted you to feel like you couldn\u2019t trust me. You can.\u201d I breathe out slowly. \u201cI do trust you. I just want you to trust me. To tell me the truth, however ugly you may think it is.\u201d He waivers and then he nods. \u201cOkay, what do you want to know?\u201d I think for a moment. \u201cCan I have some of your chips? I\u2019m still hungry.\u201d A beat and then he sighs. \u201cThey\u2019re called fries.\u201d I help myself. \u201cSo what now? How long are you going to be able to evade the\u2026\u201d I stop, realising that we might be overheard and that the word \u201cpolice\u201d may by itself attract auditory attention from amongst a background hum of many conversations. \u201cGladys. How long are you going to be able to avoid Gladys?\u201d He looks confused for only a second. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I want to see what I can find out before I meet up with Gladys.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Whit\u2014ask him what he and Caroline were working on together.\u201d I take another one of his fries. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s odd that he didn\u2019t mention that he and Caroline were close?\u201d \u201cThey were working together; they might not have been close,\u201d Cain replies. \u201cThe\u2026Gladys interviewed him\u2026perhaps he was afraid that admitting to a connection would make him a suspect.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s absurd. We were all sitting together in the Reading Room when Caroline was\u2026when Caroline left.\u201d \u201cGladys suspects me of having worked with an accomplice\u2026 She might suspect the same thing of him, I guess.\u201d \u201cWhat accomplice?\u201d He lowers his voice. \u201cI gather that they believe Boo asked Caroline to leave on my instruction, and then I asked him to leave to make sure he didn\u2019t tell anyone, and because I was angry that he\u2019d not managed to get rid of Whit.\u201d He finishes, clearly relieved he\u2019s managed to maintain the code. \u201cIt\u2019s a good theory\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201c\u2014except for the fact that Caroline wasn\u2019t found for hours.\u201d I think about the library, the beautiful stately halls. \u201cCould a man who looked and smelled like Boo really have walked into the BPL, killed Caroline, and hidden her body in less than two minutes without anyone noticing?\u201d \u201cWhoever killed Caroline also knew exactly where the security cameras were,\u201d Cain adds. \u201cThey picked up nothing.\u201d \u201cOur locked room in reverse.\u201d I gaze at him. \u201cI miss you. Whit and Marigold are terrific, but I miss you.\u201d He leans across the table and kisses me. And for a time we say nothing. Then I tell him about Whit and Marigold to keep from dissolving into tears. And about Lauren\u2019s account of Whit\u2019s conquests. He doesn\u2019t seem particularly surprised by either revelation. I confide that I am worried Marigold might end up like those girls who ring the Rag in search of him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too worried about that,\u201d he says. \u201cMarigold knows where he lives.\u201d I smile, though that worries me even more. I recount Marigold\u2019s suspicion that Whit was in the library to meet someone the day Caroline died. \u201cDo you think someone might have orchestrated for you both to be there on that day, at that time?\u201d His brow furrows as he considers the possibility. \u201cMaybe. But to what purpose?\u201d \u201cTo scare you off maybe?\u201d \u201cFrom what? The library?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cThat scream didn\u2019t really do anything aside from give us a reason to talk to one another.\u201d Cain signals for the check. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that anyone had died until later.\u201d I grab the wad of cash from my coat, cover the bill and tip with a couple of twenty-dollar notes, and quietly slip the remainder into the pocket of Cain\u2019s jacket. We walk out of the diner in silence and make our way towards the river away from the bustle of people around and about Zoe\u2019s. It\u2019s still bitterly cold and miserable, but I\u2019m not thinking about that. Cain hands me a cell phone\u2014a model so basic I\u2019m surprised they make it anymore. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone know you have it,\u201d he warns as he places his arm around my shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s a prepaid burner. I can call you. The one number programmed into it is this one.\u201d He holds up a similar phone. \u201cSo you can reach me whenever you need to\u2026or want to.\u201d \u201cWon\u2019t the police be able to trace you?\u201d \u201cNot if they don\u2019t know about the phone.\u201d I slip the cell into the inside pocket of my coat. \u201cThank you.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s set on silent so I don\u2019t give it away by calling at the wrong time.\u201d I nod. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it close.\u201d I lean into him as the wind cuts through my coat. \u201cWhere are you staying tonight?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll find somewhere.\u201d \u201cNot on the streets?\u201d \u201cNo\u2014I\u2019ll get a hotel room. The police can\u2019t be watching them all. I\u2019ve just got to buy a duffel bag first.\u201d \u201cA duffel bag? Why?\u201d \u201cNothing more suspicious than a man checking into a hotel with no luggage.\u201d He draws me to him. \u201cI should buy a change of clothes anyway.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got you covered.\u201d I tell him what\u2019s in the backpack he\u2019s been carrying for me. He laughs. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d assume you\u2019ve aided and abetted before.\u201d \u201cPlease be careful.\u201d I hesitate. \u201cPerhaps you should leave Boston, Cain. Get out of Massachusetts.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t find out who\u2019s doing this if I leave,\u201d he says gently. \u201cI\u2019ll never get my life back if I don\u2019t find out.\u201d \u201cYes, but you\u2019d be less likely to be shot by the police.\u201d He pulls me closer. \u201cI\u2019ve served my time, Freddie. I made my peace with it, because whatever the reason, I did kill a man. But I don\u2019t think I can go to prison for something I didn\u2019t do\u2026not without fighting like hell anyway.\u201d I hold on to him, aware I don\u2019t want to let go. \u201cOkay, so we fight.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, I must admit I\u2019m a little uncomfortable with Freddie lying to Leo. I feel deceived\u2026as though you could be lying to me. It\u2019s ludicrous, of course. I must remind myself that Leo is a character and not actually me. That I need to do so is a testament to your talent! It did just occur to me when I read the end of this chapter. Is Cain Black? Is that why he lives in Roxbury? This whole time I\u2019ve assumed he\u2019s white. If he is Black, the likelihood of being shot by the police is quite high, and this whole fugitive-from-the-law caper is a great deal more dangerous. Now I\u2019m wondering if Freddie is Black. And Marigold. Whit looks like the \u201chero from an old cartoon,\u201d so I know he\u2019s white. But I realise now there\u2019s nothing in the manuscript which says one way or the other with respect to Freddie, Cain, and Marigold. I just defaulted to white because no one mentioned they were Black. I know you\u2019re not white, so maybe your characters aren\u2019t either, and it is only my inherent bias that makes me see them as white unless you tell me otherwise. Wow! My head\u2019s spinning. Yours, Leo PS: It is nice to see Leo again even if he\u2019s being lied to. Jesus, is he Black, too? You\u2019re really upsetting my sense of self. Perhaps he should find the next body. *** Dear Hannah, In answer to your question, yes it does matter what color your characters are. As I\u2019ve already explained, the police over here are a lot more dangerous if Cain is Black. Even if he walked into a police station with his hands up, they might shoot him. It matters for other things, too, in ways that may affect the story line. I admire your determination to ignore skin color, but it\u2019s a bit like ignoring the virus. It\u2019s not realistic. Whether or not a character is Black will affect his story arc\u2026but perhaps that\u2019s the point you want to make by ignoring it. Do you want readers to say this couldn\u2019t happen to Black people, and then wonder, why not? Is that what you\u2019re saying? Okay, I see your point. But it\u2019s risky. You\u2019re betting on a level of self-awareness in the reader that might not exist. People who\u2019ve assumed these people are white may feel betrayed and tricked if they realise that the people they\u2019ve invested in could be Black. Some folks only want to read about their own kind, and even the idea that a character could possibly be Black means he\u2019s not white enough. It\u2019s simply the way it is. And, take it from me, you don\u2019t want to tick those folks off. I really wouldn\u2019t do this. But it\u2019s your book. Yours, Leo \n Chapter Twenty-Eight Marigold is waiting in the lobby of Carrington Square when I walk in. Her face is tear-streaked, and she is furious. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she demands. Joe looks at me wide-eyed and shrugs. \u201cShe\u2019s been waiting a couple of hours,\u201d he whispers. \u201cShe won\u2019t go. I was thinking I\u2019d have to call the police.\u201d Marigold removes the suit jacket she\u2019s wearing and throws it at me. \u201cI thought I\u2019d better return this to you.\u201d A little alarmed that she might divest the skirt too, I say, \u201cLet\u2019s go up. We obviously need to talk.\u201d Her eyes glitter fiercely, but she follows me to the stairs. Neither of us says anything until I\u2019ve closed the door of the apartment behind us. And then Marigold explodes. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d She\u2019s crying. \u201cYou said you were staying home.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re upset because I went out? Marigold, what happened?\u201d I try to put my arms around her, but she pushes me away. \u201cWere you laughing at me? You and Whit?\u201d \u201cWhit?\u2026Marigold, what are you talking about? Where is Whit?\u201d \u201cHe left!\u201d She shouts. \u201cAs soon as he realised you weren\u2019t joining us, he made an excuse about something he\u2019d just remembered and left.\u201d \u201cSo you put two and two together and got twenty-seven?\u201d I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the turn of phrase that confuses her or the fact that I know nothing about why Whit might have run out on her. I hold out my hand. \u201cCome into the kitchen. I\u2019ll make hot chocolate and we can figure this out.\u201d She takes my hand like a small child and comes meekly with me. I seat her at the counter and start heating milk and cocoa. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d Marigold wipes her eyes with the back of her hand. I place a box of tissues in front of her. \u201cWhit and I met at the restaurant. When I told him you hadn\u2019t wanted to join us, he was upset. He tried to ring you\u201d\u2014her lip trembles again\u2014\u201cto make sure you knew it wasn\u2019t a date.\u201d I flinch. I\u2019d left my phone in the apartment to make sure it couldn\u2019t be used to track me. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible\u2014I hadn\u2019t wanted to take the risk. If I\u2019d answered, I might have been able to tell Whit to stop acting like a jerk. \u201cWhen you didn\u2019t pick up, he made an excuse and left. We hadn\u2019t even ordered starters.\u201d Tears again. I push a steaming mug of hot chocolate towards her and open a packet of marshmallows. Marigold looks up at me. \u201cI sat there like an idiot for a while, and then I began to wonder if he\u2019d come here. I came over and your doorman told me you\u2019d gone out. After you said you were staying in. And I thought that you\u2019d gone to meet Whit.\u201d I look at her. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve said it out loud, I hope you realise how idiotic it sounds, how idiotic it is. I went to a movie, that\u2019s all. I forgot my phone. It\u2019s on the coffee table in the other room.\u201d \u201cWhat movie?\u201d Marigold is still a little suspicious. \u201cAn Affair to Remember. It was showing at The Brattle at nine.\u201d \u201cYour doorman said you left before eight.\u201d Poor Joe! Marigold had obviously interrogated him. \u201cI did. To be honest, knowing you and Whit were together made me lonely for Cain. I didn\u2019t want to sit here feeling miserable, so I went out.\u201d \u201cTo look for him?\u201d \u201cTo shop.\u201d \u201cWhat did you buy?\u201d \u201cNothing. Maybe I was looking for him a bit. Either way, I came back empty-handed.\u201d Marigold comes around the counter and hugs me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve just waited so long for Whit\u2026it made me a little crazy.\u201d \u201cI promise you, Marigold, I haven\u2019t seen Whit. Even if I was inclined to regard Whit as more than a friend, which I\u2019m not, I wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d \u201cI know\u2026I am being hysterical.\u201d She returns to her stool and adds a handful of marshmallows to the hot chocolate. \u201cI was so happy yesterday, and then tonight was so strange. I\u2019m afraid I lost my mind for a moment\u2026but it\u2019s back.\u201d She studies me. \u201cWhy are you not more upset?\u201d she asks. \u201cAbout Cain. I\u2019d be broken.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m older than you.\u201d \u201cAnd that makes you care less?\u201d \u201cNot at all. It just makes me more inclined to wait and see.\u201d I change the subject. \u201cWhat are you going to do about Whit?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cHe walked out on you, Marigold.\u201d The girls who called the Rag linger in my imagination. I don\u2019t want Marigold to become one of Whit\u2019s discarded conquests. \u201cHe should at least tell you why.\u201d Marigold inhales. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll call him now.\u201d The call is short. All Marigold manages to say is \u201cHello, Whit, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m at Freddie\u2019s.\u201d And then it\u2019s finished. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask, wondering if there\u2019s been a quarrel that Marigold hasn\u2019t mentioned. \u201cHe said he was coming over and hung up.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d It\u2019s past midnight. I really want to go to sleep, but it seems I will be required to referee young love. Whit arrives about twenty minutes later. By then I\u2019ve made coffee because hot chocolate just doesn\u2019t cut it at one in the morning. Whit hugs me as soon as I open the door. \u201cFreddie, thank Christ!\u201d I push him away, confused and not a little concerned about how Marigold will take this behaviour. \u201cWhat the hell is going on, Whit?\u201d He looks at Marigold and embraces her next. \u201cHello, Gorgeous. I\u2019m sorry about tonight.\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d The hour has made me impatient. \u201cWhit, sit down and explain yourself so you two can make up and I can go to sleep. Actually\u2026\u201d I change my mind. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to explain yourself to me. I might go to bed now.\u201d Whit shakes his head. \u201cNo, Freddie, stay. This concerns you.\u201d I sink into the armchair so they can have the couch. Whit sounds serious, and I notice for the first time that there is no sign of his customary flippancy. \u201cAt about seven this evening,\u201d he says, \u201cmy mother was attacked. She was working alone in the office\u2014there was no one else about. She seems to have surprised someone trying to break into the files. He left her for dead.\u201d \u201cJesus on a bike!\u201d \u201cBut she\u2019s not dead?\u201d I ask, terrified of the answer. \u201cNo. He just knocked her out. She came to and called the police.\u201d He turns to Marigold. \u201cI had just arrived at the restaurant when I got the call. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t tell you\u2026I was spinning.\u201d Marigold wraps her arms around him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She glances at me sheepishly. \u201cI knew there was a good reason.\u201d \u201cHow is your mum\u2014is she okay?\u201d I ask. \u201cMom\u2019s a tough cookie. And she\u2019s on the warpath now.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cFreddie, she thinks it was Cain.\u201d I stare at him. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d \u201cWhy? Why is it impossible?\u201d I falter. It was well after nine when Cain joined me at the Brattle. It\u2019s not impossible. I can\u2019t alibi him. \u201cBecause he wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d \u201cWhere were you tonight, Freddie?\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d \u201cWhen Marigold told me you were staying home tonight, I was worried that you were in danger\u2014\u201d \u201cFrom Cain? That\u2019s absurd.\u201d \u201cFreddie, he attacked my mom!\u201d \u201cAre you sure\u2026is she sure?\u201d \u201cShe says she is.\u201d \u201cHow would he have gotten into a legal office? That doesn\u2019t sound possible.\u201d Whit shrugs. He rubs his face. \u201cMom swears it was him. Freddie, where were you?\u201d \u201cI went shopping and then to see a film at The Brattle.\u201d \u201cI wonder why the police haven\u2019t been here looking for Cain,\u201d Marigold says. \u201cThey probably realise Freddie wouldn\u2019t risk losing her Fellowship by harbouring a fugitive.\u201d \u201cMore likely because they\u2019re watching the building.\u201d I don\u2019t comment on whether or not I\u2019d harbour a fugitive. \u201cThey\u2019ve probably deputised Mrs. Weinbaum and Joe. There\u2019s no way Cain could come here without them knowing\u2026 And they\u2019re following me, so I\u2019m safe,\u201d I add by way of alibiing myself. \u201cThey lost you tonight,\u201d Whit replies. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d \u201cYou weren\u2019t answering your phone, so I came by to check on you. When there was no answer, I called the police. They said they\u2019d lost you in the subway.\u201d \u201cThey told you that?\u201d \u201cMy mom\u2019s contact in the Boston PD told me.\u201d \u201cIf they\u2019d let me know they were tailing me, I would have worn yellow and walked slowly.\u201d I am terse now. Angry, though I\u2019m not quite sure with whom. Marigold leaves Whit to come to me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Freddie. We loved him too.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not dead,\u201d I say quietly. I turn to Whit. \u201cI take it you don\u2019t believe him anymore?\u201d \u201cHe attacked my mom, Freddie.\u201d A thought occurs. \u201cWas he caught on the security footage?\u201d Whit frowns. \u201cNo. The office archives don\u2019t have security cameras\u2026that\u2019s where Mom was attacked.\u201d \u201cCain avoided the cameras in the BPL too,\u201d Marigold adds. I can\u2019t halt the resentful flicker of my eyes. \u201cFreddie, I don\u2019t want to believe this of him either, but I don\u2019t think we have any other choice.\u201d I nod, tight-lipped. I need to think. Marigold is holding my hand, and Whit is watching me carefully. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014this has all been a bit of a shock.\u201d I swallow and meet Whit\u2019s eyes. \u201cI gather you and Caroline were working on something together.\u201d Whit\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d \u201cOne of the reporters at the Rag mentioned it.\u201d \u201cWhy were you talking to a reporter from the Rag?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s doing a story on Shaun Jacobs\u2026and since I\u2019d met him\u2026 Anyway, she said you and Caroline were working on a project.\u201d \u201cYes, we were,\u201d he says carefully. \u201cYou said you barely knew her!\u201d Marigold\u2019s accusation has nothing to do with Caroline Palfrey\u2019s murder. Whit sighs. \u201cThat was my parents. They told me to downplay my involvement with Caroline.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause they know how this sort of thing goes. They didn\u2019t want the proud name of Metters dragged into the investigation of the death of a client\u2019s daughter. Our project had nothing to do with anything\u2014so I didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d \u201cWhat was it about? The project, I mean?\u201d \u201cWe hadn\u2019t decided. Caroline had all sorts of stupid ideas\u2026 As I said, it was a very under-baked notion that we\u2019d write a long-form investigative feature together. And, to be honest, I wasn\u2019t that keen.\u201d \u201cWhy were you in the library that day?\u201d I ask. \u201cWere you there to meet Caroline?\u201d \u201cYes, actually,\u201d he replies frankly, like he\u2019s relieved. \u201cShe was supposed to meet me in the Reading Room. I was pretty ticked off she didn\u2019t show\u2026And then I met you guys, and I figured it wasn\u2019t a wasted afternoon after all.\u201d He swallows. \u201cOf course, when I realised what happened to her\u2026\u201d His face crumbles fleetingly. Marigold returns to him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, Whit. You didn\u2019t know where she was. You couldn\u2019t have done anything.\u201d \u201cAnd neither could Cain,\u201d I point out. \u201cWe were all there when she screamed. He couldn\u2019t have killed her.\u201d Whit pauses. \u201cThe police now think the scream wasn\u2019t Caroline\u2019s. They believe it might have been a cleaner or someone who looked under that table and saw the body. That Caroline had been killed sometime before we heard the scream.\u201d \u201cIf that\u2019s so, why didn\u2019t this person who discovered the body tell anyone?\u201d \u201cThe police think that perhaps she was frightened. Or maybe that she realised who the killer was and ran. They\u2019re looking into any woman who may have been associated with Cain.\u201d I close my eyes, trying to keep calm, but I\u2019m so tired that it\u2019s a struggle to open them again. \u201cYou go to bed, Freddie,\u201d Whit says. \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep on your couch tonight, just in case.\u201d \u201cMe too,\u201d Marigold adds. I smile. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Whit. The police are watching the building. I\u2019m perfectly safe. You take Marigold home and go and be with your mother. You should be with her.\u201d We argue back and forth for a couple of minutes until I announce that I am officially throwing them out. Marigold suggests we meet for lunch, and I agree to get of rid of them. I need to be alone with this mess, to figure out what I\u2019m going to do. Finally, I shut the door on them, relieved and shattered. I turn out all the lights, strip, and climb into bed with the cell phone Cain gave me. And for some reason I can\u2019t explain, I pull the covers over my head before I call him. His voice is thick and sleepy when he answers. \u201cFreddie?\u201d *** Dear Hannah, Wow! Was that just a literary slap? Did you just put my concern over Freddie\u2019s flirtation with Whit into Marigold\u2019s head? Just to show me how ridiculous I sounded? Well, I deserved that, I suppose. I see you remain committed to not mentioning the plague. This is a grave mistake, not to mention a missed opportunity. Just think how much easier it would be for Cain to elude the police if he and everyone else were wearing masks. None of us are identifiable. That, combined with the current civil unrest, is a crime writer\u2019s dream! This time, this horror, is a gift, Hannah. It would be arrogant and rude to refuse it. In the hope of showing you what this work could be, I have amended your earlier chapters to set them firmly in the midst of this disease. Please find a new version of your manuscript attached. Give it a chance, read it carefully, close your eyes and see what I see. I know you\u2019ll come around. Writing in an attack on Whit\u2019s mother, however, is a brilliant move! It shakes Whit out of his adolescent loyalty to his buddy and makes him finally choose a side. To that end, I wonder if it would work better if Jean Metters was tortured and brutally murdered rather than merely assaulted by Cain. I know you\u2019ve left her alive so that she can finger Cain, but there may be other ways around that. Killers tend to escalate. It makes sense that Cain\u2019s crimes would become more vicious. And I think it might heighten the pace and sense of danger at this stage of the novel. I\u2019ve attached a few pictures of a murdered middle-aged woman. As you can see she was clearly tortured before her throat was cut. The injuries to her breasts and pubic region suggest a sexual element to the attack. The mask she\u2019s wearing might have made it easier for her killer. I expect that behind it she was no one. It occurs to me as I\u2019m writing this that Marigold is underused. She\u2019s a psych student. If you were to bring her face-to-face with the body of Whit\u2019s mother, perhaps she could find a clue in the manner of slaying that identifies Cain as clearly as a victim statement. Looking forward to seeing what you do with these suggestions. Remember, I\u2019m happy to read rewrites. Yours, Leo \n Chapter Twenty-Nine Even alone in my apartment, with all the windows and doors locked and under the bedcovers, I whisper when I speak. And when I cry, I do so silently so he is not aware of the tears which are soaking my pillow under the covers. I ask him where he was before he met me at The Brattle. \u201cI was trying to find a woman called Mouse. She and Boo were friends of a sort. I was hoping she might be able to tell me if anyone wished him harm.\u201d \u201cDid you find her?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cSo there\u2019s no one who could attest to where you were earlier this evening,\u201d \u201cNo\u2026why?\u201d I tell him about the attack on Whit\u2019s mother, her allegation that it was him. For a moment he says nothing. Then, \u201cFreddie, I swear I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d \u201cI know, but she\u2019s saying you did, and we have nothing to prove otherwise.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019ll be no fingerprints or DNA evidence to corroborate her story because I wasn\u2019t there, Freddie.\u201d \u201cWhy would she say it was you, Cain?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. A mistake? Perhaps she realises who I am and she assumes it was me who attacked her\u2026\u201d He curses. \u201cWho would have thought this could get worse?\u201d \u201cCain, you need to make sure you have a lawyer.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get one before I turn myself in. I promise. But not yet.\u201d I pull myself together and wipe my eyes, hoping Cain can\u2019t tell I\u2019ve been crying. I\u2019m no use to him weeping and falling apart. \u201cI\u2019m going to speak to Jean Metters,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cShe may be mistaken, as you say, or she may be lying. If it\u2019s the latter, we need to find out why.\u201d \u201cFreddie, I\u2019m not sure if you should\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Cain, I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d \u201cDone this before, have you?\u201d I can hear the smile in his voice. \u201cAt least a dozen times.\u201d \u201cFreddie, seriously, you will be careful? Someone has killed two people\u2026Please don\u2019t give them reason to even look at you.\u201d \u201cThat would be easier if I knew who the hell they were.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m nearby,\u201d he says. \u201cCall and I can be there in minutes. I can\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d I promise him that I will. We wish each other good night and eventually hang up. And I fall asleep wrapped in the idea that he\u2019s close. I don\u2019t stir until nine the next morning, and when I rise it is with purpose. Sometime in the night it occurred to me how I was going to speak with Jean Metters, and I wake knowing what to do. Whit, Marigold, and I have agreed to meet at Marigold\u2019s apartment and to go on to lunch from there. I leave Carrington Square at eleven and walk to a nearby florist where I purchase a bouquet of hot-house roses. A moment of wistfulness as I\u2019m reminded that the roses will be coming out at my nana\u2019s place. Her garden would look like a box of smarties right now, bright, clashing colour. Nana collected and planted new colours each season, yellow, red, orange, blue, all embedded with no scheme whatsoever. With the bouquet in hand, I hail a cab and give the driver Whit\u2019s parents\u2019 address. It\u2019s not far, but I\u2019m carrying flowers. The Metterses\u2019 home is beautiful\u2014a Back Bay mansion with formally groomed grounds. Whit had moved home to housesit while his parents were abroad some months ago, and had been about to return to his own apartment when he was stabbed. Events and comfort colluded, and somehow he has not yet left. There are security guards and cameras at the door with its gothic knocker. I give the security guard my name and tell him I\u2019m a friend of Whit\u2019s, with an appointment to meet him for lunch. He regards me in a way that makes me wonder if he thinks I am one of the women who phone the Rag for Whit. He makes a phone call and then tells me it\u2019s all right to knock. I\u2019m surprised when Jean Metters answers the door. There\u2019s a bruise above her right temple, but she is dressed and made-up for the office, and immaculately so. \u201cMrs. Metters.\u201d I hand her the flowers. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you weren\u2019t seriously injured. Whit told us what happened\u2026 It must have been terrifying.\u201d She looks from me to the flowers as if it is some strange custom she doesn\u2019t understand. \u201cMarigold and I arranged with Whit to meet here for lunch,\u201d I explain. I glance at my watch. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not embarrassingly early.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in?\u201d she says, frowning. \u201cWhit\u2019s already left\u2014I\u2019ll give him a call and find out what\u2019s gone wrong.\u201d She places the flowers on a hall table and takes me through the house, into a courtyard with a swimming pool. As we walk, she phones Whit. I hear her say, \u201cWell, clearly there\u2019s been some mix-up because she\u2019s here. Really, darling, I don\u2019t know why you need to go out today of all days\u2026 Shall I send her on? Yes, all right. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have time to entertain, so just come and get her as soon as possible.\u201d I am starting to regret this plan. It probably wasn\u2019t that well thought out. Jean opens the door to what appears to be a separate guesthouse on the other side of the pool. \u201cIt seems there has been some misunderstanding as to where you kids were to meet,\u201d she says, offering me a seat in the sitting room. \u201cWhit will be back to collect you in a couple of minutes if you\u2019d care to wait here. Excuse me while I go find a vase for your flowers.\u201d This may be my only chance, so I take it. \u201cWhit said you thought it was our friend Cain McLeod who attacked you. I can\u2019t say how shocked and sorry I am to hear that.\u201d \u201cCain McLeod is a very dangerous young man,\u201d she says curtly. \u201cI\u2019m very happy I was able to identify him before he hurt someone else.\u201d I nod. \u201cI\u2019ve been terrified since I heard. How did he get into your office?\u201d She looks at me sharply. \u201cI wonder whether the security in my building is enough, if he managed to get past yours,\u201d I add hastily. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry too much. McLeod seems to be targeting people, and the families of people, associated with his previous incarceration.\u201d She walks towards the door. \u201cBut, yes, he does seem adept at evading security and avoiding cameras.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to believe he struck you like that.\u201d \u201cHe tried to kill me, Winifred.\u201d \u201cI assure you, we had no idea that Cain was so violent.\u201d \u201cBut you knew about his past?\u201d she points out archly. \u201cEventually, but the incident he described sounded like self-defence.\u201d Jean rolls her eyes. \u201cYes, it\u2019s always self-defence and a bad childhood.\u201d She looks me up and down. \u201cAt fifteen Abel Manners was already a hardened thug who responded to his father\u2019s attempts at disciplining him by stabbing the poor man in the neck with a knife he\u2019d secreted within reach for the purpose, and then watching him bleed out on the floor. There was no way to defend him. If he hadn\u2019t been so young, he would have been facing the death penalty!\u201d I want to defend Cain, but now is not the time. I say nothing. \u201cPlease, for my son\u2019s sake, call the police if you ever see him again.\u201d \u201cFor Whit\u2019s sake?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Whit\u2019s mother, Winifred. He\u2019s my primary concern, and McLeod has already stabbed him once. Clearly, he feels that I should have got him acquitted, and he is low enough and vicious enough to attack me through my only child as well as directly.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll say goodbye. The guesthouse has its own entrance, so Whit will be able to collect you without coming through the house. He should be here very shortly\u2014you\u2019ll see him pull up through the drawing room window.\u201d I sit primly until she crosses the courtyard again and reenters the main house. The guesthouse seems to be where Whit lives, judging by the masculine, frat-house decor. There\u2019s a vague disorder about it, though a marked lack of dust makes it clear that the place is regularly cleaned. It smells faintly of Whit\u2019s cologne. There are photographs, both framed and simply pinned to the wall, of Whit playing football, drinking, and draped over smiling women, Harvard memorabilia, and various pieces of technology. I\u2019m impressed by the books on Whit\u2019s bookshelf. He is better read than I expected. Literature and the biographies of Pulitzer Prize-winners in the main. A framed article from the Rag\u2014his first, I expect\u2014a piece written in investigative style on the use of steroids in college sports. Again I\u2019m surprised. Whit is good writer, and judging by the article, he went undercover for the piece. The name on the spine of one of the books stacked on the table near the armchair catches my eye. It\u2019s Cain\u2019s first novel. I slide it out from the stack. There\u2019s a white barred prison cell depicted on the black jacket. The cell door is open. The book is called Settling, and Cain\u2019s name appears smaller than the title. I open it to the title pages. A quote from the New York Times describes the novel as \u201cprimal rage in print\u201d; the Wall Street Journal calls it \u201ca visceral tale of incarceration and retribution\u201d; there are starred reviews from the trade journals and terms like \u201cstunning debut\u201d and \u201ctour de force,\u201d and a list of awards. The volume is well-thumbed, and a first edition. Whit had read Cain\u2019s book before we all met, or perhaps it\u2019s a secondhand copy, passed on by someone who\u2019d read it often. Whit\u2019s SUV pulls into the driveway beside the guesthouse. I open the door and step out. He and Marigold are in the front seats. I climb into the back. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2014I thought we were supposed to meet here, Whit. I\u2019m so embarrassed. Your mother must think I\u2019m a total flake.\u201d Whit shrugs. \u201cNo big deal. And Mom thinks I\u2019m a total flake, so join the club.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad to see she\u2019s okay, though.\u201d \u201cYeah, you\u2019d need some kind of missile to kill Mom. She\u2019s part Terminator.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry to have disturbed her.\u201d \u201cShe said you took her flowers. That was kind\u2014she probably didn\u2019t even say thank you, but it was a nice thought.\u201d I avoid Marigold\u2019s gaze. There\u2019s suspicion in her eyes. Does she realise what I was doing? \u201cI\u2019m starving. Have you chosen a place for lunch?\u201d \u201cWhit knows a Mexican place in Cambridge,\u201d Marigold says, still watching me carefully. \u201cUnless you have an objection?\u201d I flash her a smile. \u201cI love Mexican food. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Guadalupe\u2019s in Cambridge is a high-end Mexican restaurant. \u201cThis is my treat,\u201d Whit says as we are seated at a linen-draped table. \u201cTo make up for standing you up yesterday.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t actually stand me up,\u201d I point out. \u201cJust Marigold.\u201d Whit ignores my protest. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you both try all my favourites,\u201d he says, \u201cso it\u2019s only fair I pay for the pleasure of introducing you to the best tacos in Massachusetts.\u201d He summons the waiter and orders a jug of strawberry margaritas, and then, without even looking at the menu, a series of dishes. Marigold reminds him that I\u2019m a vegetarian and he adds few more. It seems like an insane amount of food for a Mexican restaurant, but the dishes, when they arrive, do so in small, elegant portions. Even so, the table is laden and we struggle to keep up with Whit\u2019s demands that we try this or that. The meal is sensational and the conversation mainly about the food. It\u2019s not until we\u2019re attempting to fit in dessert that the focus moves to Cain. \u201cWhere do you think he is?\u201d Marigold asks. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019s left Boston,\u201d I suggest, mostly because I have to say something. \u201cNo.\u201d Whit says firmly. \u201cI think he\u2019s still here.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cMy mom\u2019s okay. So am I. He waited all these years for revenge; I can\u2019t see him leaving before the job\u2019s done.\u201d \u201cWhatever happened to \u2018he\u2019s served his time\u2019?\u201d I demand, hurt for Cain. \u201cThat pretty much evaporated when he tried to kill my mom.\u201d Whit grimaces. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Freddie. I was on his side, you know that, and if Mom hadn\u2019t positively identified him, I would still be giving him the benefit of the doubt\u2026but she\u2019s certain.\u201d My nod is designed to pacify, not agree. \u201cDid your mom know who he was before this happened?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cHad she realised that Cain was Abel Manners who she\u2019d defended as a boy?\u201d \u201cThe police told her a couple of days ago.\u201d His eyes narrow. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause people make mistakes, especially when they\u2019re scared or panicked.\u201d I explain carefully. \u201cIf your mom knew who Cain was, she might have assumed he\u2019d tracked her down and be expecting him to exact some kind of revenge. So when she was attacked, she saw him.\u201d Marigold speaks first. \u201cI think you\u2019re clutching at straws, Freddie\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, Freddie\u2019s got a point,\u201d Whit interrupts, \u201cif my mom was an ordinary person. But she\u2019s an expert witness\u2026like a cop. She knows what to look for, how to identify someone.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t panic, that she can\u2019t make mistakes.\u201d I stay calm. \u201cWas there any other evidence to identify Cain as her attacker? Security footage, fingerprints, DNA?\u201d \u201cHe was pulling out my mom\u2019s files on his old case, on the trial of Abel Manners,\u201d Whit replies. I falter for only a second. \u201cHow did he know where they were? The case was fifteen years ago\u2014any sensible person wouldn\u2019t expect your mom to still have a file for a trial conducted in another state fifteen years ago, let alone know where to look. Doesn\u2019t that strike you as odd?\u201d Whit bristles. \u201cWhat are you saying, Freddie? That my mother\u2019s lying?\u201d \u201cNo\u2026I\u2019m saying she might be mistaken. She was hit in the head\u2026she might have been confused.\u201d \u201cFreddie,\u201d Marigold intervenes, \u201cwe know you want to believe in Cain, but this is absurd. He\u2019s dangerous. Isn\u2019t it obvious he\u2019s the common link in all of this? If you know where he is\u2014\u201d \u201cI have no idea where he is,\u201d I say truthfully. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come stay with me for a while?\u201d Marigold says. \u201cWe have an extra bedroom. I worry about you being alone.\u201d I smile. \u201cWell don\u2019t. I\u2019m fine. Carrington Square is being watched by the police, and it has security.\u201d \u201cSomeone got past all that security to take a picture of your door,\u201d Whit reminds me. \u201cAssuming you believe Cain when he says he lost his phone.\u201d I sigh. The conversation is getting more and more tense. I change the subject before it derails completely. \u201cI read your article for the Rag\u2014the one that\u2019s framed on your wall. It\u2019s excellent\u2014I didn\u2019t realise you were such a wonderful writer, Whit.\u201d Both Whit and Marigold look surprised; Marigold, a little disgruntled. \u201cYou read that?\u201d Whit asks. \u201cWhile I was waiting for you to come back for me. You\u2019re a sensational journalist.\u201d \u201cA servant of fake news and the gutter press,\u201d Whit says ruefully. \u201cI take it your mother does not approve of a career in journalism.\u201d \u201c\u2018Not when you could do so much more with your life, Whit. You were born to make the news, not report it.\u2019\u201d Whit imitates his mother bitterly. \u201cShe\u2019ll come round after your first Pulitzer,\u201d I reply. \u201cAre you going to continue with your project without Caroline?\u201d \u201cMaybe. It was my idea\u2014I\u2019m not actually sure how Caroline became involved in it. One shouldn\u2019t speak ill, but that girl wasn\u2019t going to let anyone win a Pulitzer if she could steal it.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d I try not to sound too interested, because I know they\u2019ve already decided Cain is responsible for Caroline\u2019s death. \u201cOh, yeah. Caroline was one those people who was always in the right place at the right time to take the credit, regardless of whose talent or work it really was.\u201d \u201cGosh\u2014I thought everyone loved Caroline.\u201d \u201cAfter she was dead\u2014sure. Before that, not so much.\u201d \u201cOh\u2026anybody in particular?\u201d He looks at me sharply. He\u2019s worked out that I\u2019m interrogating him. \u201cLauren Penfold.\u201d I try not to react visibly. \u201cPenfold\u2014great name for a writer.\u201d \u201cShe thinks so.\u201d He\u2019s still staring at me. \u201cIf Cain wasn\u2019t in the picture, I\u2019d suspect Lauren.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, Are you planning that Lauren Penfold was involved? Working with Cain? Isn\u2019t that breaking at least a couple of Knox\u2019s commandments of detective fiction? I don\u2019t think Lauren was introduced early enough to allow her involvement to be fair play. Of course, rules exist to be broken! I see you\u2019ve decided not to kill Jean Metters. It\u2019s a pity, but I suppose it is your book, however involved I may be in its writing. Or perhaps you intend for Cain to try again. Perhaps Whit returns home to find his mother murdered in the way I described earlier. Perhaps part of Cain\u2019s torture is to ensure Whit finds her. As always, I will be checking for your next. Yours, Leo \n Chapter Thirty I have Whit drop me at the Barnes & Noble on Boylston Street instead of taking me directly back to Carrington Square. \u201cI can wait,\u201d he offers. I shake my head. \u201cI want to forget everything and browse the shelves. I could be hours.\u201d \u201cAre you sure?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely. Thank you so much for lunch.\u201d Marigold reaches out and grabs my hand. \u201cIf you change your mind about staying at my place, just call. I\u2019ll tell Lucas he has to wear clothes while you\u2019re around.\u201d I laugh. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure how to take that, but I\u2019ll be fine. You two have fun.\u201d I wave them off and make my way into the bookstore. It is always possible that if I allow myself to start browsing I will in fact spend the rest of the day that way, but I don\u2019t have the time. So I ask the bookseller for Settling by Cain McLeod. It turns out that he is a fan of the book, and throughout the transaction he regales me with how the story will \u201cblow my mind.\u201d The jacket is not the same as that on Whit\u2019s first edition. The background is still black, but the graphic is a small, barred window in the upper right of the cover. The words \u201cNew York Times Bestseller\u201d have been added above the title, and Cain\u2019s name is bigger than it was in the first edition. I purchase the book and return home, pausing to chat briefly with Joe, who beckons me over. \u201cI found out who\u2019s been sending you cupcakes,\u201d he says, grinning triumphantly. \u201cIt was Mr. Johnson who ordered them.\u201d \u201cLeo.\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. You might have yourself a secret admirer\u2026well, not so secret now.\u201d I laugh. Of course. I should have realised. \u201cLeo\u2019s just thoughtful.\u201d I stop by Leo\u2019s apartment to thank him, but he\u2019s not home. I mark the visit for later and return to my own place. There\u2019s a quiet relief to be alone. I slip into my pyjamas, intent on climbing into bed with Settling. But first I fish the Japanese notebook out of my satchel and update the timeline I\u2019m building. I write in Lauren Penfold, what she told me about Whit, and what Whit said about her. I go over the meeting with Lauren in my mind, looking for any sign of deception, any indication that what she\u2019d told me might have been self-serving somehow. But to be honest, I can\u2019t tell. I also extend the timeline to write in the attack on Jean Metters and her allegation that it was Cain. I wonder what reason she might have to lie, because I do think she is lying. She has to be. But why would she lie? To return Cain to prison? Why would she want that? To prove that she was not negligent in letting him go to prison in the first place, perhaps\u2026 That sounds like a stretch. To protect someone? My timeline is becoming crossed with lines pointing to possibilities, but there\u2019s no pattern. I remember suddenly that Caroline Palfrey\u2019s parents are clients of Jean Metters\u2019. Could it be their interests that she is trying to protect? I fold the notebook back into its cover. I need to walk away before the puzzle drives me crazy. I grab Cain\u2019s book and climb under the covers. The cell phone Cain gave me is beneath my pillow\u2014I never let it out of my reach. I think about calling him, but for some irrational reason I feel safer doing so at night. So, I open Settling. There\u2019s no author photograph on the back jacket, which is unusual for American hardcovers. I wonder if that was Cain\u2019s decision. I read for the next seven hours, though I\u2019m unaware of the passing of real time. The story is clearly autobiographical in parts\u2014a boy unjustly incarcerated who grows into a man within the prison system. The text is taut with barely repressed rage, which seethes onto the page, exploding occasionally in a scene of particular violence. When released, the protagonist, Caleb St. John, embarks on a quest for vengeance against those he holds responsible for the loss of his freedom. The novel is seeded with a dry black humour. The acts of retribution escalate in violence and yet, despite this, Cain manages to make Caleb sympathetic. The language is raw and authentic, though lyrical in its way, and completely unlike the Cain I know. But he\u2019d warned me as much. It\u2019s half past nine or thereabouts when I finish, exhausted and sobbing. The book is dark but it is a velvety darkness, sumptuous somehow. And it isn\u2019t really about revenge but the manner in which judgment can shape both judge and judged. Caleb St. John\u2019s anger was honest, his struggle reflective of society\u2019s struggle to civilise its own destructive instincts, to disguise vengeance as rehabilitation. And for seven hours I have thought of nothing else. But now\u2026now I want to talk to Cain, about his book and Jean Metters, Caroline Palfrey and Whit, and us. I\u2019m intrigued and startled by what was inside him once, and I miss him. I get up, shower, change into fresh pyjamas, and make the bed for the few minutes that I\u2019ll be out of it. Still a bit full from lunch, I fix myself a bowl of cornflakes for dinner\u2026or its American equivalent, which is sweeter straight out of the box. I eat standing up while I flick through my phone for the news. Shaun Jacobs\u2019 murder has been superseded by more recent killings. Caroline is still news. There\u2019s no coverage of the attack on Jean Metters, but there is mention that novelist Cain McLeod is wanted for questioning in connection with the death of Caroline Palfrey. A knock on the door startles me. I open it a crack because I\u2019m wearing pyjamas. They\u2019re perfectly respectable, and I am not generally so coy, but these days it could be the police.\u2026in which case I\u2019ll need to be fully dressed, preferably with a cardigan I can pull over my head. It\u2019s Leo. I open the door properly. \u201cI saw a light under your door so figured you were still up.\u201d \u201cI am. Would you like a cup of coffee\u2026or a bowl of cereal?\u201d He peers into the bowl in my hand, which by then contains only a few sodden flakes in leftover milk. \u201cThink I\u2019ll pass, unless you have tea.\u201d \u201cI do, as a matter of fact.\u201d Leo sits at the counter as I steep a tea bag. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to come by and ask how you got on with the police,\u201d he says. \u201cYou were in a bit of a panic when we came back.\u201d The text message, with the image of my door and Cain\u2019s. I\u2019d almost forgotten. \u201cThe police haven\u2019t been able to establish anything beyond that it was sent from the phone Cain lost weeks ago.\u201d \u201cBy Cain, you mean Handsome Man?\u201d I laugh. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAnd he\u2019s the guy the police want to question for the Palfrey murder.\u201d \u201cYes, but as a witness, I expect.\u201d I\u2019m lying. Leo probably knows I\u2019m lying. \u201cThen where is he?\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d \u201cI read that the police are looking for him\u2026usually means they can\u2019t find him.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure where he is\u2026he had some research he needed to do.\u201d \u201cAnd he\u2019s uncontactable?\u201d \u201cWell, the police took his phone.\u201d \u201cHe should turn himself in,\u201d Leo says firmly. \u201cFor your sake, if not his own.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not in any danger,\u201d I reply lightly. He meets my eye. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d I know that he is not talking about that danger emanating from anyone other than Cain. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Leo shakes his head. \u201cFreddie, you and I are buddies, right?\u201d \u201cYes, of course.\u201d \u201cAs your buddy then, I\u2019m a bit worried about you.\u201d \u201cYou really don\u2019t need to be, Leo.\u201d \u201cBut I am. Your good sense is compromised by the fact that you\u2019re in love.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d \u201cYou are. Let\u2019s not pretend. And being in love is a bit like finding God. You start to act on blind faith. Let me be the voice of reality before you find yourself in Jonestown.\u201d I pull a face. \u201cAll right, Voice of Reality, what wisdom do you wish to impart?\u201d \u201cIt seems to me, Freddie, that people have a tendency to mysteriously die when in the vicinity of Handsome Man. So it follows that in his vicinity is not an advisable place to be.\u201d \u201cThe people who died mysteriously in his vicinity were also in mine,\u201d I point out. \u201cWell, I suppose you should only worry if you\u2019re not a murderer, then. If you aren\u2019t, then someone near you is.\u201d He finishes his tea. \u201cFace it, Freddie. You believe this guy because you want to, because for some reason beautiful, intelligent women seem drawn to dangerous men\u2014\u201d He stops short as he realises what he\u2019s just said. \u201cNot that you\u2019re\u2026I mean you\u2019re\u2026you know what I mean. Quit laughing!\u201d But it\u2019s too late. The giggles have set in. Who would have thought that in a conversation about whether my lover was a murderer it would take an accidental compliment to make things awkward? \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Leo,\u201d I say, still grinning. \u201cI promise, I\u2019m not about to drink the Kool-Aid. And Cain isn\u2019t dangerous.\u201d \u201cNo, ma\u2019am, he isn\u2019t. As long as you ignore his conviction for murder.\u201d \u201cHow did you know about that?\u201d I ask sharply. \u201cI have a friend who works for the Globe, who\u2019s working on the story of Caroline Palfrey\u2019s murder. I\u2019m afraid the whole world will know very soon. So even if Handsome Man is, as you clearly believe, the victim of a miscarriage of justice, he should turn himself in now.\u201d Damn! I\u2019m aware Leo is watching me. \u201cI really have no idea where Cain is.\u201d He nods slowly. \u201cYou know, if you ever feel like you\u2019re in over your head, you can turn to me. I know I don\u2019t cut the same dashing figure as Handsome Man, but I would do whatever I could to keep you safe, Freddie. Whatever you need, just ask.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s that he\u2019s so sincere, or that it\u2019s now past midnight, but I feel fraught and emotional. I blink hard and look away to keep the tears from spilling. \u201cThank you. You really are a mate.\u201d Perhaps he\u2019s afraid I\u2019m going to start crying, because Leo stands hastily to say good night. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have called so late\u2014you look exhausted.\u201d He pauses at my door and turns back. \u201cFreddie, please be careful. Cain McLeod has proved himself to be a violent man. You may not have seen it yet, but you know he\u2019s capable of it. If he tries to contact you, call the police. In America, innocent men get lawyers, they don\u2019t go on the run.\u201d I don\u2019t argue with him because there\u2019s no point. Leo doesn\u2019t know Cain. He has nothing to weigh against the allegations, to counter the circumstantial evidence. I close the door behind Leo. His concern is a little unnerving. I\u2019m tempted to be irritated with him, but I know he\u2019s only trying to look out for me. And perhaps on the face of it, my belief in Cain does seem crazy. I realise then that I have completely forgotten to thank Leo for the cupcakes. Perhaps this wasn\u2019t the right time. Perhaps I\u2019ll bake him some sort of thank you instead. Tomorrow. I turn out all the lights and climb back into bed, drawing the covers over my head. The phone vibrates uncannily on cue. \u201cCain?\u201d \u201cHello.\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound drowsy as he did when I called yesterday. \u201cIs it a bad time? I know it\u2019s late.\u201d \u201cNo\u2014it\u2019s a perfect time. I have things to tell you, and I\u2019ve just climbed into bed.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d I ask, startled. \u201cI saw your lights go out.\u201d \u201cYou can see my lights?\u201d \u201cYes\u2026I thought if I waited until they went out, I could be sure you were alone.\u201d I smile. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit presumptuous.\u201d The thought that he\u2019s close enough to see the lights in my windows feels strange. Tantalising and frustrating. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d \u201cNearby.\u201d \u201cThe police are watching Carrington Square.\u201d \u201cI know\u2014I can see them.\u201d I\u2019m intrigued and a little alarmed. \u201cWhere exactly are you? Actually scratch that. I need to be able to say I don\u2019t know where you are. But Cain, isn\u2019t it a bit risky to be so close?\u201d \u201cA calculated risk.\u201d There is no background noise. He\u2019s somewhere quiet. I make myself stop trying to guess where he is, in case I do. \u201cI spoke to Jean Metters today.\u201d \u201cHow on earth did you manage that?\u201d I tell him what I did, and about my conversation with Jean Metters. \u201cShe\u2019s lying, not mistaken, Cain. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d \u201cWhy would she lie? I\u2019m nothing to her\u2026an old case she lost.\u201d \u201cMaybe she thinks you\u2019re going to sue or something.\u201d Cain laughs. \u201cShe\u2019s a lawyer. Half her clients probably want to sue her. But I doubt that the idea of me doing so is threatening enough to risk her career and possibly jail by fabricating a charge.\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly what she did\u2026there has to be a reason.\u201d \u201cYes, there will be. What else did she say?\u201d \u201cShe wanted me to call the police if I saw you, said that a mother\u2019s duty was to protect her son, and that I should turn you in for Whit\u2019s sake if not my own.\u201d \u201cA mother\u2019s duty,\u201d Cain murmurs. \u201cCould she be trying to protect Whit from me?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s possible, I suppose. The police told her who you were. She told me you\u2019d come to Boston to exact some sort of revenge against her through Whit.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a bit Marvel Universe, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cMaybe. Whit was stabbed and Jean Metters does fit the supervillain mould.\u201d \u201cAgain, she\u2019s a lawyer\u2026 But you\u2019re right, it\u2019s a reason.\u201d I tell Cain about lunch with Whit and Marigold, and Whit\u2019s opinion of Lauren Penfold. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible?\u201d he asks. I screw up my nose, though he cannot see it. \u201cIf what Whit says is true, she might have had reason to kill Caroline, perhaps even to stab Whit, but why would she kill Boo, or attack Jean Metters?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve decided all four crimes are connected then?\u201d \u201cThey are connected\u2014through you. And since I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re a murderer, there must be something else at play.\u201d \u201cThere must be,\u201d he says quietly. He sounds despondent. I desperately want to put my arms around him, to tell him it will be okay. \u201cI wish I knew if the police were watching all the time\u201d I say, frustrated that he is so close. \u201cThere\u2019re a few minutes every now and then when they go for coffee, but it\u2019s hard to tell when that\u2019ll be. It\u2019d be impossible to get past your doorman, anyway.\u201d \u201cSo you could get into the building, just not past Joe?\u201d \u201cI think so.\u201d \u201cThen I could leave without the police knowing too.\u201d \u201cYour doorman may be under instructions to alert them if you leave.\u201d \u201cI could use the fire escape\u2026 You can get out of the building but not into it via the fire door.\u201d I sit up, excited now. \u201cI could be ready, you could call me when they next go for coffee, and I could simply walk out.\u201d Silence for a moment. And then, \u201cOkay. When I call, walk out of your building and into the alley one block down. I\u2019ll find you there. If I don\u2019t show up within a couple of minutes, don\u2019t wait. Walk back.\u201d I agree, already scrabbling into clothes by the light of the phone. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this, Freddie?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \u201cThen dress warmly.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, I\u2019m truly touched. You\u2019ve mirrored our relationship in that between Freddie and my namesake. He is her advisor, honest and true. She can turn to him as you can turn to me. I\u2019m moved to tears to know that this is the way you feel. Corresponding with a celebrated author like yourself is a privilege that I feel keenly. I have learned so much from you; I hope you have learned a little from me. And I have been content to simply be your devoted beta reader. But the idea that we could be more, that we are more, is a dream. Oh, fuck this pandemic. If not for it, you would be here. I would have been your guide; I would have shown you the unimaginable. Yours always, Leo \n Chapter Thirty-One I stuff a backpack with the travel blanket I bought for the flight to the U.S. It rolls up impossibly small. I throw in a box of crackers, cheese, cookies, and a bag of candy, a small thermos of coffee, the notebook I\u2019ve been using to plot events, a couple of changes of underwear, and a toothbrush. I realise that I\u2019m not planning on returning for at least a couple of days, though I\u2019m not sure when I decided that. I slip my computer into its sleeve. Perhaps it\u2019s absurd to be taking it, but I can\u2019t bring myself to leave it behind. I find the cash I took out that day and slip it into my inside pocket, and I take my passport, just in case. I\u2019m not sure if what I\u2019m about to do is illegal. It\u2019s probably aiding and abetting, but I\u2019ve been doing that all along. I change the message on my usual phone to say that I\u2019ll be incommunicado for a couple of days working on some crucial scenes of my book, so please leave a message. It\u2019ll buy me time with family and Marigold, I hope. I leave that phone plugged into the recharger beside my bed, knowing it could be used to locate me. Breathe, Winifred! I sit down. When I was eight, I packed a bag to run away from home. I never left the backyard, but the excitement of planning the adventure was enough. This is not a child\u2019s game. This will have consequences. But still, I am exhilarated by the idea of seeing Cain, of getting out from under the surveillance of the police. Cain\u2019s call comes an hour later. \u201cYou have about five minutes.\u201d I slip out into the corridor and make my way to the internal fire stairs. At this time of night the lights in the hallway have been dimmed. The door to the escape is near Leo\u2019s, so I am particularly careful to be quiet lest he poke his head out. I walk down the stairs and out of the building. It\u2019s weirdly simple. The street is quiet. The streetlights seem very bright. I don\u2019t run or look for Cain but walk evenly down the block. The alley is about twelve feet wide, unlit and silent. It smells rank. Large steel garbage skips sit outside the back entrances to the businesses on either side. And, for the first time, my excitement flags against the reality of what I\u2019m doing. I hear someone and turn hopefully. But it\u2019s not Cain. An old man shouts profanities at me as he goes through one of the bins, and I want to run. I stop, not sure what to do now. Terrified to do anything. Where the hell is Cain? I back deeper into the alley away from the street, away from the man and his bin. I can barely see now. There\u2019s a sound at the head of the alley. Footsteps in between the shouting. Thank goodness. I open my mouth to call Cain\u2019s name, and a hand a claps over it and pulls me back. I fight, and an arm wraps around me effectively pinning and immobilising me. And my blood chills because though I can\u2019t see his face, I know it\u2019s Cain. He drags me down. The old man is shouting again, screaming obscenities. There\u2019s someone talking to him. A whisper in my ear. \u201cFreddie, it\u2019s me. I didn\u2019t mean to scare you, but that\u2019s a cop talking to Zeke.\u201d I stop struggling. In fact, I\u2019m positively limp with relief. \u201cZeke saw me walk in.\u201d \u201cHe won\u2019t say anything to the cops. I think the officer is trying to move him on anyway.\u201d A couple of minutes and the policeman runs Zeke out of the alley. We crouch lower as he swings a flashlight in a cursory check before heading back into the street. I turn finally to face Cain. He kisses me gently. \u201cHello.\u201d \u201cYou scared the wits out of me!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was afraid he\u2019d see you.\u201d He has my hand. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t blame you if you want to go back.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cIs this where you\u2019ve been hiding out?\u201d His brow rises. \u201cHere? God, no! I wouldn\u2019t invite you to come live in an alley.\u201d We leave through the rear of the alley and weave through back streets. Cain knows where he\u2019s going; I have no idea. Eventually, I recognise that we have doubled back to the block on the other side of the street from Carrington Square. We cross a small park and climb over a fence, and, suddenly, we\u2019re in someone\u2019s backyard. Then Cain simply opens a door and we walk into the house. I\u2019m terrified that we are about to be shot by a justifiably angry homeowner for breaking and entering. Cain bolts the door behind us. My eyes adjust slowly. We seem to have come in through a kitchen. \u201cThe guy who owns this place spends the colder months in the Bahamas. Even in the summer, he\u2019s barely here.\u201d \u201cHow do you know?\u201d \u201cHe told me. My agent brought me to a party here about three years ago.\u201d \u201cWhy do you have a key?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a statue of Venus in the garden, with a hidden cavity where he keeps his spare key. You have to press Venus\u2019s breasts to make it reveal. He was so pleased with it, he showed me. In fact every guy who was at that party knows where the key is.\u201d Cain grimaces. \u201cHe was a bit of a jerk, to be honest.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve been here this whole time?\u201d \u201cNo. I remembered this place and the key last night and tried it on a long shot. As I said, it\u2019s been years\u2014he might have sold the house, for all I knew. I come in after dark and leave before dawn, and make sure I don\u2019t turn on any lights in the rooms with windows so that no one knows I\u2019m here. When this is all over, I\u2019ll tell him and apologise.\u201d \u201cWon\u2019t the police think to look here?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a friend. This was just one of hundreds of parties I went to on tour. Larry, the owner, is some kind of dot-com tycoon. He seemed to think this place was a bit of a dump\u2026 He hasn\u2019t bothered to install security. It\u2019s a wonder there aren\u2019t a bunch of people living here.\u201d He grabs my hand. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll show you something.\u201d He takes me upstairs and through the house to a bedroom. The curtains are drawn. He directs me to peer through the tiny part in the fabric. I gasp, surprised, though I knew vaguely where the house was. We\u2019re almost directly across the road from Carrington Square. I can see my window. I can also see the police car parked outside, and I realise that Cain must have been here when he called. He takes me then to an internal room and turns on a lamp. It\u2019s a media room with a television screen on one wall and a massive couch against the other. Judging by the blankets folded on the couch, that\u2019s where he\u2019s been sleeping. Cain\u2019s laptop and phone are charging on the floor by an outlet. The room is cold but a respite from the frigid air outside the house. I smile as I remove my backpack. \u201cI packed for a doorway or park bench. I even brought food.\u201d Cain smiles at me. \u201cFood is good. There\u2019s nothing in Larry\u2019s cupboards but vodka and truffle oil, and we can\u2019t really call out for pizza.\u201d I unpack my supplies. Cain teases me when he sees the thermos but he does not refuse the coffee, and we huddle under blankets on the couch and spread out the folded pages of my notebook. We go over everything together in the hope that our collective memories might shake loose some pattern from the notes I\u2019ve dutifully made. I remember talking about Marigold and Whit and Jean Metters, the firmness of Cain\u2019s chest beneath my cheek and the warmth of him. I\u2019m not sure which of us drifts to sleep first. I wake because I can feel that Cain has. It\u2019s freezing and still dark. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to hurry if we want to shower and be out of here before dawn.\u201d \u201cWe can shower?\u201d \u201cSure. I\u2019ve been using the en suite in the main bedroom. There\u2019s hot water\u2014it might warm you up a little,\u201d he adds as I begin to shiver. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you have towels?\u201d I ask, stretching. \u201cThere are fresh towels in the cupboard in there.\u201d He stands up and offers me his hand. \u201cYou go first. I\u2019ll follow.\u201d The en suite is expansive and luxurious. White tiles and brushed chrome fittings. I grab a couple of towels out of the cupboard and shower quickly. The soap is honey-scented and the shampoo a boutique brand I\u2019ve never seen. The hot water halts the shivers and blasts away the fuzziness of too little sleep. By the time I emerge, Cain has packed up any signs of us in the media room. I go back to the window while he showers and peer through the part in the curtains again. A police car is still parked on the street within sight, though I cannot say whether it\u2019s the same one. I wonder how long it will take them to suspect that I\u2019m not there. I probably have until this evening when I expect they\u2019ll wonder why there are no lights on in my apartment\u2026or Marigold calls the police because she can\u2019t reach me\u2026which is entirely possible. *** My dear Hannah, How are you? I\u2019ve been thinking of our novel incessantly for the last few days. I went for a test yesterday at the pop-up testing station in Copley Plaza. I wasn\u2019t sick\u2014just thought I\u2019d try it. I wonder if impaling someone via the nostril would make for an interesting death scene? Perhaps you can\u2019t kill someone that way. Maybe lobotomy is the only danger. I\u2019ll see if I can find any images of a similar killing. Purely for interest. I suspect you\u2019re determined to avoid the subject of the virus. I have given in on that count. I really liked the last chapter. Finally, momentarily, Freddie wavers in her ridiculous trust of Cain. You could make the scene in the alley even more poignant if Cain was a little rougher with her. Perhaps he punches her or strangles her a little. He might explain it away by saying he thought she was someone else, but for a brief moment we would see his true character. The more I think about it, the more I am convinced that Cain is Black. You really do need to let people know at the outset. If you don\u2019t want to say it outright, perhaps you could have him wear hoodies throughout. Think about it, Hannie, and think about me. Ever yours, Leo \n Chapter Thirty-Two The sky has not yet begun to lighten when we leave. Cain locks the door and slips the key into his pocket and we leave via the route by which we came. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I ask, plunging my hands into the pockets of my hoodie. My knowledge of Boston\u2019s layout is shaky at best, and traversing alleys, cutting across and doubling back, I am completely lost. But Cain seems to know where he\u2019s going, where we\u2019re going. He grabs my hand. \u201cBreakfast.\u201d \u201cOh, God\u2026and coffee.\u201d \u201cSure. Don\u2019t say I don\u2019t know how to show a girl a good time.\u201d The Old Mate is run by Australians. It serves lattes and cappuccinos, smashed avocado and Vegemite toast. The serving staff all wear brown hoodies which boast an embroidered joey emerging from the pouch, and kangaroo ears. It\u2019s a bit cringeworthy, but the place is buzzing with breakfast-goers, many of them Australian. Cain pulls out a chair for me at a table in the corner. \u201cI thought we could talk here without your accent being noticed particularly.\u201d I might have been impressed if I weren\u2019t focussed on real coffee. Cain signals a waitress who takes our orders. I request a double latte and avocado on Vegemite toast, which, because this is America, comes with fries. Cain orders bacon and eggs, a dish which is apparently made Australian by the addition of a fried banana. I\u2019m vaguely affronted, but I\u2019m hungry and not about to sit on culinary indignation. After months in the U.S. I find the Australian accents all around us strange and ear-catching, and I realise that my voice would, anyplace else, make Cain and me noticeable. Here we disappear into the buzz. We talk about Caroline Palfrey\u2019s murder first. It seems to be the epicenter of everything that\u2019s happened since. I am still reluctant to believe that there is any coincidence to the fact that Cain and Whit met that day. \u201cAssuming that\u2019s true\u201d\u2014Cain pokes the deep-fried banana on his plate like he\u2019s checking for signs of life\u2014\u201cthe person who brought us all into the library would have known about me, and Whit\u2019s and Caroline\u2019s familial connections to my case.\u201d \u201cIs any of that a secret?\u201d \u201cNot really, but as you know, it\u2019s not something I talk about. You could find it all on record somewhere, but you would have to know to look.\u201d \u201cJean Metters would not have even needed to look,\u201d I point out. \u201cBut why would Jean want to kill Caroline\u2026or to stab her own son? It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d \u201cMight Whit have been stabbed by someone else in revenge for Caroline? Perhaps this is between the Metters and the Palfreys.\u201d Cain smiles. \u201cThis is Boston, not the Ozarks.\u201d I refuse to let him dismiss the theory. \u201cOne thing we know for sure is that Jean Metters is lying about you attacking her. Not mistaken, lying. Why would she do that if she wasn\u2019t involved?\u201d Cain frowns. \u201cUnless she\u2019s afraid of me.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t follow.\u201d \u201cIf she believes I\u2019m a threat to her, or to Whit, she might have decided to help the police find evidence against me.\u201d He decides to try the banana. \u201cThe police told her who I was a couple of days before she was assaulted, so the timing fits.\u201d \u201cWhy would you be a threat to either of them?\u201d \u201cPerhaps she recognizes she did a lousy job defending me and assumes, as she told you, that I\u2019m vengeful.\u201d He looks up and meets my eye. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d \u201cI know, though I\u2019m not sure why. I would be.\u201d I sip my latte and savour the first infusion of caffeine. It\u2019s so good it might have been made in Melbourne. \u201cCain, they\u2019re not going to able to convict you, are they? They may suspect you, even arrest you, but they haven\u2019t got any actual evidence you killed anybody. Surely it will be thrown out of court?\u201d \u201cYou have a great deal of faith in the American legal system, Freddie.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I? Everything they have is circumstantial, and they won\u2019t find anything more concrete because it wasn\u2019t you.\u201d I become convinced as I say it. \u201cThey haven\u2019t got anything.\u201d \u201cI expect they\u2019re working on the premise that you don\u2019t need evidence if you have a confession.\u201d \u201cBut they don\u2019t\u2014you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, of course I didn\u2019t. I just mean that\u2019s why they may be less concerned about the lack of concrete evidence than you seem to be. They expect that they\u2019ll be able to get me to confess.\u201d \u201cWe still need to find you a lawyer,\u201d I tell him firmly. He nods. \u201cThe moment I retain an attorney, I\u2019ll have to turn myself in. I want to make sure that I\u2019ve found out everything I can before I\u2019m taken off the streets.\u201d He puts down his knife and fork. \u201cBoo had come by some money recently. He used it to go on a bender, of course, but apparently he had something on someone.\u201d \u201cHe was blackmailing someone?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what it sounds like.\u201d \u201cWould he have done that?\u201d \u201cWithout a second thought. Boo\u2019s moral compass was somewhat pragmatic.\u201d Cain frowns. \u201cOne of Boo\u2019s buddies thinks Boo knew something about Caroline Palfrey\u2019s murder.\u201d \u201cIs that likely?\u201d Cain shrugs. \u201cMaybe. Boo liked the BPL. He might have been there that day.\u201d \u201cSo if he did see something, and he was blackmailing the murderer, it follows that the murderer might want to kill him.\u201d \u201cYes, maybe.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cThere\u2019s a guy called Darryl Leonowski\u2014runs a kind of soup kitchen in East Boston. Apparently Boo was a regular there, played chess with Darryl.\u201d \u201cHave you spoken with him?\u201d \u201cI was contemplating it.\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019re afraid he\u2019ll call the police.\u201d \u201cThere is that chance.\u201d \u201cI could speak with him. The police might not even be looking for me yet.\u201d \u201cWould you? I hate involving you in\u2014\u201d \u201cI thought we established that I was already involved.\u201d I pull a notebook out of my backpack. \u201cWhat do I need to ask him?\u201d We discuss questions for a while and then I ask, \u201cWouldn\u2019t he have told the police everything he knows already?\u201d \u201cMaybe. My experience is that it\u2019s hard to run a soup kitchen if the police are hanging about. He may be more willing to take his time with you.\u201d \u201cShould I lose my Aussie accent, you know, to be less identifiable?\u201d I ask the question in my best imitation of Cain\u2019s inflection. He laughs. \u201cNo\u2026please don\u2019t do that. Ever, if possible.\u201d \u201cHow rude! That\u2019s exactly what you sound like, you know!\u201d We pay the cheque and catch a bus across the bridge to East Boston. Cain remains vigilant, constantly scanning for police uniforms, or anyone who might be watching us particularly. I speak as little as possible. The soup kitchen is in an old church. I leave Cain outside and go in by myself. The church hall is set up with trestle tables and most are filled. Many of the clients are elderly, though some look to me like teenagers. The gathering is quiet. Few people converse as they eat, or if they do, it\u2019s in whispers. I walk up to the counter where hot food is being served. The young man in a sauce-stained hoodie grabs me a plate. \u201cThank you, but I\u2019m here to see Darryl,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have a last name. But it\u2019s very important that I speak to him. You\u2019re not Darryl, by any chance?\u201d I add hopefully. \u201cNo, I\u2019m Jack,\u201d he replies, pointing to the large name tag pinned to his chest. I feel stupid for not having noticed it. Jack looks around. There\u2019s nobody waiting in line. \u201cStay here\u2014I\u2019ll get him. If anyone arrives looking for grub, tell \u2019em I\u2019ll be back in a sec.\u201d And so I wait, trying not to let my eyes rest on anybody. Jack\u2019s back pretty quickly. \u201cDarryl\u2019s in the storeroom,\u201d he says, pointing out the doorway. \u201cJust go through there.\u201d I thank him. The door opens to a long, dark corridor, off of which are several rooms. A voice from the end. \u201cI\u2019m in here\u2026last door on your left. Watch yourself\u2026the light isn\u2019t working.\u201d The hairs of the back of my neck rise, but I tell myself not to be silly. It\u2019s an old church. I find Darryl in the end room. He is man of substantial girth, and indeterminate age. His hair is that pale strawberry blond that speaks of a ginger youth. He wears a black hoodie which declares Know Christ, Know Life and is sweating profusely as he opens boxes and stacks cans of foodstuffs on shelves. I introduce myself. He shakes my hand. \u201cPleased to meet you, Winifred. Jack said you want to talk to me.\u201d \u201cI do. I\u2019d like to ask you about Shaun Jacobs.\u201d He looks up sharply. \u201cShaun? You know he\u2019s\u2014\u201d \u201cYes, sir, I do. That\u2019s the reason I came to see you.\u201d \u201cYou knew Shaun?\u201d \u201cI met him, but I can\u2019t say I really knew him. But I believe you did.\u201d He smiles softly and sighs. \u201cYes. He was something of a curmudgeon and an excellent chess player, even when he wasn\u2019t sober.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cWhy are you interested in Shaun?\u201d Cain had prepared me for this. \u201cYou can\u2019t lie to people who work with the homeless. They\u2019ll know.\u201d And so I tell Darryl the truth. \u201cThe man who the police think murdered Shaun is a friend of mine.\u201d \u201cAnd you think he\u2019s innocent.\u201d \u201cI know he\u2019s innocent.\u201d \u201cAnd how do you know that, Winifred?\u201d I tell him about the night Cain and I encountered Shaun Jacobs. \u201cIf Cain had wanted to kill Boo, he could have done so then, and it would have been self-defence, but he didn\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t even call the police or go to a hospital for fear it would mean Shaun would be arrested.\u201d Darryl looks dubious. \u201cLook, Darryl, in the end I believe Cain. And I know that Shaun had come upon a source of money not long before he died\u2026that he claimed to know something about Caroline Palfrey\u2019s murder.\u201d Darryl\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cCaroline Palfrey\u2026the woman in the library?\u201d I nod. I can see he\u2019s realised something. \u201cShaun told me a story about a girl who screamed and made everyone think she was dead.\u201d \u201cIn the library?\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t say. I thought at the time it was just another one of his \u2018women are the root of all evil\u2019 stories. I didn\u2019t pay a lot of attention.\u201d I try to contain my excitement. This is something. \u201cIs that all he said about the girl who screamed?\u201d \u201cHe said she got hers, and now he was getting his.\u201d \u201cWhat did he mean by that?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. You gotta understand, Shaun was not always rational or even coherent.\u201d \u201cDo you think he might have killed her\u2026the girl who screamed?\u201d Darryl thinks and then he shakes his head. \u201cI dunno. Shaun lashes out, but murdering a young woman and hiding the body doesn\u2019t seem like him.\u201d I remember Cain saying something similar about Boo lashing out. Could Shaun Jacobs simply be an underestimated murderer? \u201cDid he do or say anything else that you thought was odd?\u201d \u201cMost things Shaun said and did were odd\u2026but he did bring me a box of donuts. He\u2019d never done that before.\u201d \u201cDonuts?\u201d \u201cYes, fancy ones. Flavours devised by someone who was obviously high, but they were good.\u201d He smiles sheepishly. \u201cI confess, I\u2019ve bought the odd box myself since then.\u201d \u201cWhat was the shop called\u2014where the donuts came from?\u201d \u201cAround the Hole.\u201d It hits me strangely because I\u2019m not sure what it means, not sure what to think. But suddenly everything from the beginning is uncertain. I thank Darryl for talking to me. He shrugs. \u201cNo big thing. Shaun wasn\u2019t a good man, but he wasn\u2019t all bad either. I hope it turns out that you\u2019re right about your friend. It\u2019s hard to come to terms with being in love with a killer.\u201d And I wonder fleetingly if he\u2019s talking about me or himself. Cain puts his arm around me about two blocks from the church. He was waiting for me outside, but we didn\u2019t acknowledge each other in case Darryl or someone else was watching. By the time I can talk to him I am ready to explode with what I have discovered. We walk down to LoPresti Park on the waterfront to talk. There is barely anyone there\u2026a few determined joggers pounding the frozen promenade and the occasional dog walker. It\u2019s cold and clear and still, and the view of the Boston skyline is spectacular. We stroll along the pier, Cain shielding me from the wind coming off the water. I begin to tell him what Darryl told me. \u201cShe screamed? But why?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, but it explains why no body was found when they searched. It was Caroline who screamed, but she didn\u2019t die then.\u201d Cain nods thoughtfully. \u201cIt makes sense, I suppose. But it also means I no longer have an alibi for Caroline\u2019s murder.\u201d \u201cBut neither does anyone else,\u201d I point out. I tell him about the donuts from Around the Hole. \u201cMarigold\u2019s donut shop?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d I swallow. \u201cWe know she\u2019s been in love with Whit since well before we all met. And Lauren Penfold said that sometimes he would pretend to be with Caroline to blow off girls.\u201d \u201cYou think she stabbed Whit?\u201d \u201cWhat if she felt he betrayed her with Caroline? We know she knew where he lived, and initially, before they got distracted by you, she was the police\u2019s prime suspect, if you remember.\u201d Cain exhales. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll concede that\u2019s possible, but Boo? She\u2019d never met him.\u201d \u201cPerhaps she had. Perhaps he was blackmailing her because he somehow saw her kill Caroline.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cDoes she love Whit that much?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. I love you, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d kill anyone to get your attention\u2014\u201d I stop, mortified by what I\u2019ve just said. I look at him like a rabbit in headlights. Cain laughs softly and draws me into his arms. \u201cMe too,\u201d he says before kissing me. We resume walking in silence, letting the moment be untouched for a while. \u201cWe need to talk to Whit,\u201d I say finally. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cIf Marigold is our killer, he\u2019s in danger. She\u2019s already stabbed him once, and if he disappoints her\u2026\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right. Call him.\u201d *** Dear Hannah, I am a little concerned that you are making Freddie a little too naive. Surely she realises by now that Cain is the murderer\u2014even if she\u2019s in love with him. I am also, to be honest, quite appalled by her disloyalty to Marigold. It\u2019s understandable that Cain wants to cast suspicion on someone else, but Freddie is supposed to be Marigold\u2019s friend, for Chrissake! Forgive me if my protest is strident, but I abhor disloyalty. It is in my opinion the lowest violation and should be punishable in only the most punitive way. I can only warn you against going down this path, Hannah. You have disregarded many of my previous suggestions, and so I wonder if you might even conceive of making Marigold your ultimate perpetrator. Perhaps you have become jealous of my fondness for her. But rest assured, she is no threat unless you do this. I cannot tolerate disloyalty. Yours, Leo PS: I didn\u2019t fail to notice the proliferation of hoodies in this chapter. I\u2019m hurt by the churlishness of it\u2014I\u2019m only trying to help. You\u2019re setting this book in America\u2014you cannot ignore race. It needs to be declared. If a character is not white, you cannot treat him as though he is. It\u2019s simply absurd. And if he\u2019s white, he cannot live in Roxbury without comment as to why. I note that even after the hours I put into correcting your earlier chapters, rewriting them to include the disease, you have neither acknowledged my efforts nor rectified the omissions in your work. I\u2019m disappointed in the extreme. I wonder if perhaps jealousy is at play here too. Do you fear I can write your story better than you? Needless to say, I suggest you remove all the hoodies and replace them with some fucking masks! *** Dear Ms. Tigone, To confirm our earlier conversation by phone, we have identified the man you know as Leo Johnson. We believe it is possible that he has recently entered Sydney, in spite of restrictions, posing as a returning citizen, medical consultant, or diplomatic official. In the latter case, he might evade mandatory isolation requirements. We have, of course, mobilized our agents and the Australian authorities to ensure your protection. Please find attached images of Wil Saunders, aka Leo Johnson. Mr. Saunders has a background in law enforcement which we believe has allowed him to elude the authorities to date. He is a person of interest with respect to several murders in the Boston area. Should you see this man, please do not approach him, or allow him to approach you, and inform our agents immediately. I assure you this will be over soon. Sincerely, Special Agent Michael Smith Federal Bureau of Investigation \n Chapter Thirty-Three I find the notebook into which I scribbled Marigold\u2019s and Whit\u2019s numbers, and I call. \u201cFreddie! You\u2019re speaking to me.\u201d \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be speaking to you?\u201d \u201cI thought you might be upset at me over Cain. Honestly, Freddie, if he hadn\u2019t attacked Mom, I\u2019d still be giving him the benefit of the doubt. But sometimes you have to cut your losses and give up on people.\u201d \u201cWhit, where are you?\u201d \u201cAt home.\u201d \u201cAre you alone?\u201d \u201cYeah. Though Marigold is watching the house.\u201d \u201cWhat? She\u2019s spying on you? Call the police.\u201d He scoffs. \u201cIt\u2019s just Marigold. It\u2019s a little edgy but kind of sexy.\u201d \u201cWhit, it\u2019s stalking. You can\u2019t\u2014\u201d \u201cFor Marigold it\u2019s foreplay. She\u2019ll come in once she\u2019s worked herself up a bit.\u201d \u201cNo. Whit, don\u2019t be alone with Marigold!\u201d \u201cFreddie, I don\u2019t know how you do dating in Australia, but being alone is kinda the point\u2026\u201d \u201cWhit, I think Marigold killed Caroline.\u201d A beat of shock. \u201cWhat? Are you out of your mind?\u201d \u201cListen to me, Whit. Caroline\u2019s scream had nothing to do with when she died\u2026that was afterwards. I think Shaun Jacobs saw something and was blackmailing Marigold\u2026 She\u2019d meet him at that donut shop, Around the Hole. It\u2019s been Marigold all along.\u201d For a moment nothing. And then, \u201cFreddie, you\u2019re clutching at straws. I know you want it not to be Cain, but\u2014\u201d \u201cDammit, Whit, don\u2019t let her in! Call for help.\u201d \u201cI think you might be the one that needs help, Freddie.\u201d His voice is hard, angry. \u201cI know you\u2019re upset about Cain, but you can\u2019t turn around and accuse your friends.\u201d He pauses and when he speaks again, he\u2019s less hostile. \u201cLook, just come over. I promise I\u2019ll listen to whatever it is you think you\u2019ve found out. And if you\u2019re right, you can protect me from Marigold.\u201d I can almost see him rolling his eyes as says the last. A passing dog barks. \u201cIs that a dog?\u201d Whit asks. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d I hang up, suddenly panicked. Cain, who\u2019s been standing close enough to have a good idea of the substance of the conversation, gently takes the phone from me. He removes the SIM card and powers off the phone. \u201cCome on,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can flag a cab on Summer Street.\u201d \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I ask, though I know the answer. What else can we do? Cain face is grim. \u201cTo save Whit,\u201d he says. I hold Cain\u2019s hand tightly as we sit in the cab, aware that whatever happens, Cain will probably have to turn himself in as a result. In fact, it\u2019s likely that if police are watching the Metters\u2019 house, Cain will be arrested the moment we arrive. I suggest that he drop me off and keep going, but he won\u2019t countenance the idea. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure Whit\u2019s okay, and then we\u2019ll tell the police about what Darryl told you,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s another explanation.\u201d I concede. Perhaps we owe Marigold a chance to defend herself. We get out of the cab in front of Whit\u2019s house. There is no police presence which, to be honest, surprises me. I would have expected at least a couple of officers to be watching the house, but perhaps it would be stretching the resources of Boston PD too far to have a car stationed with each of us day and night. Even the private security I encountered at the front door when last I was here is absent. Cain glances at me. Clearly, he too finds the absence of any security odd. Especially since Jean Metters has so recently been assaulted. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a detail with Whit\u2019s mom at her legal offices\u2026or wherever she is,\u201d he says, frowning. I direct Cain to the second driveway, and we walk past the main house and the pool to the guesthouse at the back. I knock. There\u2019s no answer. \u201cWhit, it\u2019s Freddie.\u201d Still nothing. Cain tries the door\u2014it\u2019s open. Now we\u2019re both becoming alarmed. Cain goes in ahead of me. And then everything happens at once, though the seconds stretch so that each thing is distinct in its horror. The crack. An explosion when the bullet leaves the barrel and the thud when it enters Cain. He twists back and falls before me and my line of sight is cleared for Whit and his gun, and Marigold, ashen and shaking. I drop to my knees beside Cain and someone is screaming. It might be me, I\u2019m not sure. I look for the source of the blood and press my hand over where I think the bullet entered. And I shout at Whit. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going to hurt you, you idiot! We came to help you!\u201d Marigold goes into another room and returns with towels, then kneels down beside me. \u201cMove your hand, Freddie.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cA towel will work better than your palm,\u201d she says, folding one into a compress. Slowly, I pull my hand away. She claps down the towel and presses. Cain is conscious, surprisingly calm, though he\u2019s clearly in pain. \u201cGet away from him.\u201d Whit has not put down the gun. \u201cHe\u2019s dangerous\u2026a murderer.\u201d Marigold recoils automatically. I ignore him, replacing the pressure Marigold has released. \u201cFreddie, get away from him!\u201d Whit screams. \u201cIf I take my hand away he could bleed out.\u201d \u201cHe came here to kill us!\u201d \u201cHe came here with me to help you!\u201d \u201cFreddie!\u201d Cain gets my attention through gritted teeth. \u201cFreddie, Whit sent Marigold to the donut shop\u2026do you remember?\u201d He curses. Probably the pain, possibly the realisation. And then I remember too. Whit directed Marigold to Around the Hole\u2026it was his haunt before it was hers. I might not have thought anything of it if he hadn\u2019t shot Cain. I turn to stare at Whit. \u201cMy God, it was you. It was you from the beginning.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Marigold responds first. \u201cAre you out of your fucking mind?\u201d But Whit looks almost relieved. He steps across to stand over me and Cain. \u201cYou always knew, didn\u2019t you, Cain? I could tell you always knew.\u201d Cain clamps his own hand over the towel, rolls onto his side, and drags himself up into a sitting position against the wall. He catches his breath, and then, \u201cI had no idea till just now, you fucking moron. I thought you were too dumb to do anything more complicated than eat donuts!\u201d \u201cCain\u2026\u201d I know Whit shot him, but for God\u2019s sake, Whit\u2019s still holding the gun. Whit kicks him. Cain swears, and I try to protect him with my own body. \u201cGet away from him, Freddie.\u201d Whit motions with the gun. \u201cWhy did you kill Caroline, Whit?\u201d I ask, playing for time. Surely a neighbour has heard the gunshot and called the police by now. \u201cIt was just a stupid argument,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2026 We were talking and then\u2026then she was dead.\u201d I hear Marigold whimper. \u201cWhat were you arguing about?\u201d \u201cShe wanted to pull out. She set it all up, and then she pulled out.\u201d \u201cSet what up?\u201d \u201cThe inside story of Cain McLeod, the bestselling murderer.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cIt was her idea\u2026she organized it all. Getting him to the library, giving us a reason to talk\u2026\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why she screamed\u2026\u201d \u201cShe said nothing bonds strangers better than a shared mystery. It was simple, and she was right. Suddenly, we were all pals.\u201d He explodes, furious again. \u201cThat\u2019s what she couldn\u2019t stand, that it was me, not her. That I\u2019d be getting the story, the recordings. It would be my observations, my friendship with a murderer. She suddenly decides that it would be better if she got close to Cain instead.\u201d He shakes his head in disgust. \u201cWe met up at the BPL again that night to go over my notes, and she tells me she\u2019s changed the plan and I\u2026she\u2026I didn\u2019t mean to, but I couldn\u2019t let her just step in and take you guys.\u201d Marigold has a phone in her hand. Whit is focussed on Cain and me. I push on. \u201cBut Shaun Jacobs somehow saw you kill her\u2026and he blackmailed you.\u201d \u201cYeah, who knew they let people like him into the library?\u201d Despite his bravado, there are tears in Whit\u2019s eyes. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Jacobs and his god-awful smell, the security guard might have noticed me\u2026and Caroline. As it was I was able roll her under that table and simply walk away while they were trying to throw him out.\u201d \u201cBut then he found out where you lived and he stabbed you?\u201d \u201cYeah\u2026he went Batman. Decided he needed to get justice for Caroline. That\u2019s when I realized I couldn\u2019t simply pay him off.\u201d \u201cSo you killed him,\u201d Cain snarls. \u201cWell, considering he had already stabbed me, I\u2019d say it was self-defence.\u201d Whit chokes. \u201cHe didn\u2019t suffer. He didn\u2019t even wake up.\u201d \u201cWhit,\u201d I say gently. \u201cI get it\u2014Caroline was an accident and Shaun Jacobs was self-defence, or something like it. But what are you doing now? You know Cain wasn\u2019t trying to hurt you.\u201d \u201cBut he is!\u201d Whit is sobbing now. \u201cYou and Cain\u2026even Marigold\u2026digging into things like some kind of idiotic Scooby Gang. You wouldn\u2019t leave it alone. You kept talking to people, investigating\u2026 It was only a matter of time before you found something. Why couldn\u2019t you leave it alone?\u201d \u201cThey want to arrest Cain for what you did!\u201d \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have been able to prove anything\u2014he didn\u2019t do it!\u201d Whit is screaming again. A frustrated, thwarted child. \u201cWhit, we\u2019ve got to call Cain an ambulance.\u201d The towel is now saturated with blood, but the bleeding has not stopped, and I can see Cain fading. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to hide him under a table and walk away.\u201d \u201cSelf-defence,\u201d he says desperately. \u201cHe\u2019s wanted for murder! Who\u2019d blame me?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d blame you. I\u2019ll tell them everything\u2014\u201d \u201cFreddie, no!\u201d Cain gasps. He pleads with Whit. \u201cShe won\u2019t say a word. They won\u2019t believe her anyway. She\u2019s been on the run with me since yesterday. And Marigold\u2019s loyal to you. There\u2019s no need to worry about them. For God\u2019s sake, man, let them go.\u201d Whit hesitates. Sirens. Cain swears. \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d Whit is weeping again. \u201cYou got hold of my gun and shot the girls before I was able to wrestle the gun back and end it. Jesus!\u201d He aims at my head. And again the moment seems to stretch. Perhaps last moments do. I look at Cain as I wait for it. He reaches for me. Marigold launches herself at Whit from behind. She is small against his bulk but ferocious. He twists to rid himself of her. I leap up and grab his arm, with no idea what I\u2019m doing but kicking and punching and clawing. I bite his wrist and he loses his grip on the gun, and then Marigold and I become some kind of screaming dervish as we fight to keep him from retrieving it. I slip on blood and lose my footing. And so I\u2019m on the ground when the shot is fired, with no idea where it came from. Another shot, and I crawl to Cain. He\u2019s barely conscious. I huddle against him and close my eyes, braced for the end. But there is no third gunshot, only shouting. When I\u2019m pulled off Cain, I fight, refusing now to die quietly. Someone puts their knee on my back and cuffs my hands behind it, and I realise it\u2019s the police. I\u2019m not sure if the Boston PD had ever been thanked by a prisoner before, but I am insane with relief and grateful and terrified. I beg them not to let Cain die. I hear Marigold resisting, cursing, Whit crying like a heartbroken child, and then Jean Metters demanding rights and wanting to know why her son is in restraints. *** Dear Hannah, I regret that I have been out of touch. The penitentiary rules are somewhat Draconian, and my communication has previously been quite restricted. Still, as Cain once said, prisons have their own societal rules, and I have employed them to enable me to renew our correspondence. I hope you got the basket of cupcakes I sent you. They should have been left on your kitchen counter. I would love to know how your latest book turned out. Did the awesome foursome all survive the finale? How did Freddie come to terms with the fact that her lover was a murderer? I suppose I shall have to request a copy from the prison library when it is released, in order to find out how it ends. For them at least. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be unable to get back to Australia in the immediate future. We had barely laid eyes on each other when I was apprehended. I was wounded that you didn\u2019t visit me before I was extradited. I asked for you several times during the two days I was in Australian custody, but you didn\u2019t come, and we missed our chance to be with each other while we talked about our work and our lives. No matter. I am a loyal man, and patient. We will encounter each other in the flesh eventually. I look forward to that. In the meantime, know that I\u2019ll be there if you need me. Your Leo. \n Chapter Thirty-Four Justine Dwyer brings me a cup of tea at the station. I ask about Cain for the hundredth time. \u201cHe\u2019s in surgery,\u201d she says. \u201cWill he die?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. They\u2019re doing everything they can.\u201d She asks if anyone has offered me anything to eat. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d She hands me a bags of crisps. \u201cI grabbed these in case you were. Do you feel up to answering a few questions?\u201d I tell her everything. It doesn\u2019t feel like a police interview. I\u2019m not aware of her asking questions\u2026I just talk. I suppose Cain is not a suspect anymore, and so I\u2019m not a hostile witness or whatever it is you call someone who believes in a suspect\u2019s innocence. She tells me about the plan Whit and Caroline had devised to write an investigative piece for the Rag. \u201cThey were aware of Cain McLeod\u2019s past through their family connections. Of course, any investigative journalist could have produced a story on McLeod\u2019s conviction, and his incarceration. Though it isn\u2019t public knowledge, it\u2019s not a state secret. Caroline and Whit wanted to go one better. They intended to get close to Cain, and then to put him under pressure\u2026a story on whether a murderer could in fact be reformed.\u201d \u201cHow were they going to put him under pressure? Was that why Caroline screamed?\u201d \u201cNo. That was supposed to give Whit a reason to initiate a friendship with Cain. Caroline\u2019s idea, apparently. Then they were going to essentially gaslight Cain with similar pranks to\u2014\u201d \u201cTo see if he\u2019d kill someone?\u201d I ask incredulous. Justine nods. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d \u201cBut the messages, the images of doors, were sent to me, not to Cain.\u201d \u201cWhit was apparently trying to sow distrust. He\u2019s had Cain\u2019s phone all along.\u201d \u201cBut that means he sent the photograph of his own door the night he was stabbed\u2014\u201d \u201cBeing stabbed wasn\u2019t part of the plan. The text was meant to unnerve you, make you wonder if Cain was sending them. My partner has a theory that perhaps Whit intended to attack his mother that night.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cWithout Caroline he was making it up as he went\u2026terrified that he would be discovered, unwilling to give up on what he considered his shot. Whit told us he had no idea who attacked him because he was afraid if Jacobs was arrested, he would tell us what he\u2019d seen.\u201d I rub my face. \u201cHe told you all this.\u201d \u201cOnce his lawyer, who by the way, is also his mother, directed him to say nothing.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cSome families.\u201d Marigold and I are released while Cain is still in surgery. The police take us both to the hospital to wait. As first neither of us says anything. Marigold holds my hand in the car. As we walk up to emergency, she apologises for thinking Cain was a murderer. I apologise for believing that of her. And I tell her I am sorry about Whit. She laughs through tears. \u201cI fell in love with a murderer.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the part you fell in love with.\u201d We are escorted through the media pack outside the hospital. The waiting room is crowded. Marigold and I find seats and wait. A surgeon comes down and speaks to an older couple. Perhaps the woman is Cain\u2019s mother and the man her partner. I realise that despite the past few days, I have no claim on Cain, no right to know how he came out of surgery, or even if he came out of the surgery. The woman is crying, the man comforting her. I watch in horror. Has Cain died? Oh, God\u2014is this how it ends? Marigold swears quietly and stands up. She walks over and talks to the couple. Even as I watch her do so, I\u2019m not really registering any of it. They all turn and look at me and then Marigold beckons me over. I force my muscles to work, to walk. Perhaps Marigold sees me struggling, because she shouts, \u201cCain\u2019s not dead. He\u2019s in post-op!\u201d A few others turn and look relieved. It seems there are a number of people here for Cain. I\u2019ve reached them by now. Marigold isn\u2019t finished. \u201cThey took out the bullet.\u201d She embraces me joyfully. \u201cHe\u2019ll be okay.\u201d I want to cheer and weep, but I\u2019m not as uninhibited as Marigold, and so I hold myself together, only barely. The woman grabs my hand. She is, as I imagined, Cain\u2019s mother. She thanks me. \u201cThe police said that my son might be dead if two young women had not held off his attacker.\u201d Her voice is soft. I tell her that even as he lay bleeding, Cain tried to convince Whit that Marigold and I were not a threat, that he tried to protect us. Marigold tells her than Cain loves me. Just like that\u2014a five-year-old blurting a secret. \u201cCain is in love with Freddie, you know.\u201d I stare at Cain\u2019s mother, whose name I don\u2019t even know, embarrassed. She is clearly startled by Marigold\u2019s declaration, but she recovers admirably. \u201cI gathered there was someone in his life.\u201d She still has my hand. \u201cI am Sarah Manners. This is my brother Bill. We\u2019re very pleased to meet you.\u201d Bill shakes my hand once his sister releases it. \u201cWe\u2019re beholden to y\u2019all,\u201d he says. \u201cAbel didn\u2019t tell us he was in trouble. The first we heard of it was when the police knocked on Sarah\u2019s door looking for him.\u201d \u201cI expect he didn\u2019t want to worry you,\u201d I reply in tentative defence of Cain. \u201cAnd it all happened so quickly.\u201d \u201cAbel\u2014\u201d Sarah stops, smiles, and begins again. \u201cCain has always tried to solve his own problems.\u201d \u201cYes, and we all know where that got him,\u201d Bill mutters. \u201cPay Bill no mind,\u201d Sarah tells me. \u201cHe loves Cain like he was his own boy.\u201d As Cain will be in post-op for a while, we go to the hospital cafeteria. There, over coffee, Marigold and I tell Cain\u2019s mother and uncle what happened. Marigold is frank about her relationship with Whit, declaring it like some kind of confessional penance. \u201cWe all liked Whit,\u201d I qualify. \u201cEven Cain. We were all fooled by him.\u201d \u201cHe sounds like a troubled boy,\u201d Sarah says. Bill grunts. Eventually, Cain comes out of the anaesthetic and is transferred to a room and a bed. Sarah and Bill are allowed in to see him. Marigold and I sit in the waiting room, not sure what to do. When Sarah and Bill return, she tells us that his doctor has agreed that Marigold and I be allowed to see him too. \u201cHe was asking for you,\u201d she whispers as I thank her. Marigold pauses at the door to his room. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a couple of minutes alone first,\u201d she says, shoving me forward. Subtlety of a brick, that one. Cain is hooked up to multiple drips and machines. He turns his head towards me and smiles, and I am nearly overwhelmed. \u201cI\u2019m still kinda high.\u201d His voice is hoarse. \u201cSo don\u2019t pay too much attention to anything I say.\u201d \u201cNever did,\u201d I reply, taking his hand. There\u2019s a cannula in it, so I do so very carefully. \u201cMom says we all made it out alive.\u201d \u201cWe did.\u201d I feel a faint pressure on my hand. \u201cGood.\u201d Marigold comes in then. \u201cJesus at the wheel!\u201d she whispers, looking at Cain. She seems suddenly shy. We talk quietly for a while. I\u2019m not sure we say much. What is there to say? I am aware of feeling deeply happy. Anguished by what\u2019s happened, unsure about what\u2019s next, but happy. In time a nurse comes in to gently throw Marigold and me out. I kiss Cain and promise we\u2019ll be back as I release his hand. It leaves a kind of emptiness against my fingers, and I have to resist the impulse to touch him again. The nurse buzzes around him, cheerily checking vital signs as we leave. \u201cGod, how are we going to get past the reporters?\u201d Marigold says as we wait for the elevator. I look down at myself\u2014the blood on my jacket and shirt. Marigold, too, is splattered. There\u2019s little chance of slipping past the media throng unnoticed. But right now, I just haven\u2019t got the strength to run that gauntlet. Marigold and I are discussing the logistics of escape when the elevator doors open. And so we don\u2019t notice the man in the corner until the doors close again behind us. And then we do. Leo. I stare, thrown off balance by the fact that he\u2019s here. \u201cWhat are you\u2014?\u201d He smiles. \u201cI thought you might need me.\u201d \n If you\u2019ve enjoyed The Woman in the Library, you won\u2019t want to miss After She Wrote Him, another great stand-alone mystery by Sulari Gentill! Dean Koontz calls the captivating psychological thriller a \u201cpure delight, a swift yet psychologically complex read.\u201d After She Wrote Him is a marvel of meta-fiction\u2014a wildly inventive twist on the murder mystery that takes readers on a journey filled with passion, obsession, and the emptiness left behind when the real world starts to fall away. Read the prologue and the first chapter on the following pages! \n Prologue When the man was murdered, the gallery was full of voyeurs. They\u2019d come to see and be seen, to admire and be admired. In their finery they\u2019d postured and praised the artist, considering each canvas, looking carefully at every mark of the brush, discerning nuance and tone and meaning. They\u2019d eyed each other as rivals in fashion and wit, in the sycophantic ability to recognise artistic genius. The show belonged to art and artists and art lovers. And so no one noticed the writer. When the body was discovered, there were screams of horror. Some sobbed upon seeing the corpse; others could barely contain their glee. The gallery staff soothed and apologised, management called insurers, the authorities barked orders and asked questions. They listened for guilt, for motive and lies. And no one heard the writer. When the dead man was identified, many claimed intimacy. Some had worked with him; others had danced in his arms. Several people purported friendship, a few admitted to a mutual loathing. They offered opinions and insights, analyses of character. And yet no one knew the writer. \n On Introductions What if you wrote of someone writing of you? In the end, which of you would be real? In the beginning she was a thought so unformed that he was aware only of something which once was not. And there was the idea. The embryonic notions of story. Fragile, swirling mists that struggled to find patterns; sense that was made and unmade and made yet again. In time there were shapes in the clouds and there was her. They were shy with each other at first. Stiff. It took the longest time to exchange names. Many were considered and discarded until, finally, one was familiar. One rang true. She wrote books\u2014quirky, whimsical mysteries with an eye for the absurd. Her pen was light and her voice assured. Even so, she had not been born with the knowledge that she would write, but happened upon storytelling accidentally while seeking some unknown distraction. In writing, she found meaning and purpose and a kind of spiritual joy. And, like many who come late to religion, her devotion to the craft was absolute, her conviction in its power unshakeable. Yet she hesitated before calling herself a writer lest it seem presumptuous, or affected, or just plain silly. Some small part of her recoiled from claiming her place aloud too absolutely. Her work had achieved a modicum of success, though she was by no means a household name. He called her Madeleine d\u2019Leon. Her husband would call her Maddie. She was thirty and\u2014when they first came to know of one another\u2014happy. Madeleine was a lawyer. She\u2019d been a lawyer first. She practised in the corporate sector, but she didn\u2019t like to talk of work or even think about work when her time was her own. \u201cMy concern is billable,\u201d she\u2019d proclaim when asked about some matter she\u2019d left at the office. \u201cIf I\u2019m not being paid, I just don\u2019t care.\u201d But she\u2019d married a man who cared all the time. Hugh Lamond was the doctor. Not just a doctor, but the doctor. Ashwood was not large enough or gentrified enough to have more than \u201cthe doctor\u201d and Hugh Lamond was it. Every man, woman, and child in Ashwood knew who he was and assumed he cared about each small twinge or ache or concern, regardless of whether it was his anniversary or his wife\u2019s birthday. They were right. In the beginning, Madeleine had thought it funny: the god-like status of the country doctor. And Hugh was, after all, charming and committed. If anyone deserved to be a small-town god, it was him. Now, it niggled just a little that she had been lost in his divine glory, a handmaiden to his social deity. But still, she was proud of him. So Madeleine worked, commuting when she had to and advising from home when she could. During her non-billable hours, she painted and sewed and built a garden that would grow to be worthy of the grand home they would have\u2014whenever they finally got around to renovating. And then, one day, whilst sitting in a particularly tedious meeting about some technical matter for which a lawyer\u2019s presence was merely decorative, Madeleine d\u2019Leon had an idea for a story, and the very first thought of him. The moment of genesis was strong, a cell of creativity that divided and multiplied until there was life. He had barely any substance at all. Just a space in the narrative for a protagonist of some sort. She began writing then and there, raising her head occasionally to nod so her colleagues would think she was taking notes about the meeting itself. Every now and then she would arch a brow and shake her head or rub her chin while frowning, or tap the table with her lips pressed tightly together. She called it her boardroom technique: the kind of lawyerly intimations of consideration that made people feel better regardless. It was Madeleine\u2019s conviction that her clients demanded the presence of their lawyers at these meetings not because they needed them, or even planned to listen to them, but because the legal profession was a kind of security blanket. She was paid for what she called corporate hand-holding, and the nature of Madeleine was such that she was not too proud to admit it. In that meeting she discovered just one thing about him, but, oh, what a thing! What a perfect link! He was a writer. It was their connection. He would see the world as she did: in stories, or potential stories, in vignettes and themes. He would judge people as characters, each with their own story. They would look upon his world together. She called him Edward McGinnity. His friends would call him Ned. He was twenty-eight when she found him, a young man with the world at his feet and no idea of how he should step into it. Edward McGinnity had always known he would write. It was as natural to him as breathing, and he suspected the consequences of stopping would be as dire. In his mind there had always been epics, tales that carried on the books he could not bear to end, and new stories with conglomerate characters and modified plots. Eventually he\u2019d picked up a pen. At first he\u2019d written poetry, as adolescents do. Learned to weave words with angst and defiance and heartbreak. Those old verses embarrassed him now\u2014melodramatic, flowery, pretentious\u2014but every so often there was one line, one phrase that was clear and strong and perfect. As he grew into a man, Edward McGinnity learned to pull back, to leave the louder things unsaid, to call out to the whispers once drowned in waves of passionate literary excess. And he found new stories and a desire to be read. Maintained by an inheritance, an income born of tragedy, Edward lived well. He did so quietly, aware that the ability to write unencumbered from the first was too enviable to be broadcast, too likely to invite failure as a karmic balancing of luck. He was sitting on his deck with a notebook and a glass of red when her story first struck him. He knocked over the glass in his haste to grab the pen beside it, allowing the wine to soak and stain the decking timbers as he tried to pin the thought onto his page with ink. In time he stood and paced as he wrote, stopping occasionally to laugh, so giddy was he with the discovery of her. He knew she was a writer before he knew her name. *** Madeleine called Hugh that evening, as she did every evening that work took her away. The custom was more utilitarian than romantic\u2014should she pick up milk in Ashwood?\u2014that sort of thing. But this night she was exhilarated, and she loved Hugh Lamond more for the fact that she could share it with him. She knew she was babbling, but the idea was powerful now. It pulled new ideas towards it, building a world of characters and themes and events around itself. Hugh seemed a little bewildered at first, but perhaps whatever it was that possessed Madeleine was infectious, for soon he had suggestions and thoughts. She told him about Edward McGinnity, her well-heeled writer. \u201cBut this is going to be a murder mystery, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Hugh asked. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cSo he\u2019s a crime writer?\u201d \u201cNo. Edward writes literary novels\u2026the kind of worthy, incomprehensible stuff that wins awards.\u201d Madeleine paced with the phone, unable to physically contain her excitement. \u201cThat\u2019s the irony, you see. The hero of my crime fiction wouldn\u2019t lower himself to read\u2014let alone write\u2014the stuff himself. He\u2019s a serious artist.\u201d \u201cBut if he were a crime writer, he\u2019d know what to do to solve the crime.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s too predictable, Hugh. The fact that he is so out of place in crime fiction will make it interesting.\u201d \u201cFair enough. Perhaps his family shouldn\u2019t approve of his writing?\u201d Hugh ventured. Madeleine smiled, touched that he was so interested. \u201cBut why wouldn\u2019t they approve?\u201d \u201cThey might want him to be a doctor. You know, there aren\u2019t enough books about doctors.\u201d Madeleine laughed. \u201cNo, I think his family is dead,\u201d she said. \u201cAn accident of some sort. The story will work better if he\u2019s alone in the world.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026there\u2019s something alluring about the lonely hero.\u201d \u201cHe can\u2019t be too lonely. He\u2019ll need a love interest of some sort.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause he\u2019s a man. It\u2019s what we do.\u201d Madeleine groaned. \u201cIf he has a love interest, I\u2019ll have to write a sex scene.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s to be avoided at all costs,\u201d Hugh agreed. \u201cShe could be dead too\u2014the love interest, I mean,\u201d he said helpfully. \u201cHe could be a grieving husband.\u201d \u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d Madeleine considered the idea. The death of Edward McGinnity\u2019s family was probably grief enough. She didn\u2019t want her hero to be completely withdrawn and bitter. \u201cWhat if he loves someone who doesn\u2019t love him back, but who might one day?\u201d she said. \u201cThat way I won\u2019t have to write a sex scene because she won\u2019t have him. Perhaps Edward is so in love with her that he can\u2019t move on.\u201d \u201cWon\u2019t that make him look pathetic?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll make him look deep.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m thinking pathetic.\u201d \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t married you, you would have pined forever.\u201d \u201cHmmm\u2026yes\u2026forever. Or at least a week. What time will you get home?\u201d \u201cShould be back before lunch tomorrow.\u201d \u201cGrab some milk on the way in, will you?\u201d *** Madeleine spent the evening in the familiar, generic solitude of a hotel room. She discarded her board reports onto the small table by the window and heaved her bag onto one of the twin beds. Changing into pyjamas, she ordered room service, settled into the other bed, and opened her laptop. The novel would begin with him. It had to. That was how crime fiction worked\u2014subplots, clues, red herrings all channelled through a single literary device: the protagonist. The reader would have to know him and trust him for the story to work. So she would open with him and worry about the murder later. Madeleine closed her eyes. She could see him: sitting on the open deck of his expensive beach house, oblivious to the ocean view as he worked on the great Australian novel. She smiled. Of course he would write longhand, every word chosen after consideration, deliberation, and requisite suffering. The man she saw was handsome. For a moment she wondered when she\u2019d decided that. His hair was dark, blown wild by the salt breeze against which his collar was turned up. The sky and the sea were both grey and turbulent. And yet he continued to write, muttering to himself as he tapped the pen against his chin. It was not until the first fat drops fell that he seemed to notice. Cursing, he closed his notebook against the rain and stepped through the French doors into the house. The house itself would be tastefully furnished. Modern designer pieces complemented by what might be called sentimental junk. A large basin made of kilned glass was filled with old matchbox cars in anything but collectible condition. An assortment of old cameras\u2014Box Brownies, AGFA Isolettes, leather-cased Kodaks\u2014took up several bookshelves. A professional-quality digital SLR sat on the kitchen bench beside the wine rack. There was no dust\u2014because, of course, he would have a housekeeper. A quietly spoken, motherly woman called Mrs. Jesmond. Madeleine paused, pleased by the detail. Jill Jesmond had worked with Madeleine at Morrison McArthur. She was anything but quietly spoken, but she\u2019d love being in Edward\u2019s story, even as his housekeeper. There were several picture frames on the sideboard\u2014an eclectic collection of the kind of beautiful frames bought as particular gifts: silver, etched glass, tooled leather. Only one contained a picture, a family photo from the decade before. That must have been his family\u2014parents, brother, little sister\u2014all now gone. Madeleine lingered over that photo, the anguish of losing everybody at once, the loneliness of it. The rest of the frames were empty, blank. He was a man: Perhaps he had just not got around to filling them. Perhaps it was something else. The rain was heavy now. It curtained off the world around the house with a fall of water, blurring everything without. Edward checked his watch and cursed. It was a gentle, old-fashioned way of cursing that reminded Madeleine of her grandfather. Words not even considered swearing in this age. It was interesting, given the sleek modernity of the d\u00e9cor. He ran up the iron staircase to the bedrooms on the floor above. Edward McGinnity\u2019s bedroom was neat, no random deposits of clothes, the bed made and taut, a dozen or so notebooks of various style and size stacked in an orderly tower on the upended trunk beside his bed. It was a masculine room, functional and unadorned except for one painting: a nude in oil in an Art Deco frame. The composition was simple and the pose direct. The brushwork evoked a certain wistfulness. Somehow Madeleine knew the artist had loved his model: it was perfect. Edward stripped as he walked into the en suite to shower. The water did little to soothe the tension from his body. Every muscle was tight, wound, ready to begin. He loved this part. Discovery yawned before him, and it was glorious. The sheer possibility, exhilarating beyond measure. How seductive the existential strain between writer and character\u2014almost erotic. Edward was charged with the liminal intimacy of it. Not only would he know her, she would come to know him. And therein would be the danger and the essence of story. She\u2019d be a crime writer. Edward smiled. He\u2019d always considered authors of detective fiction an interesting breed. They identified with their genre more than other novelists, inhabiting a definite subculture in the literary world. There was a naivety about crime writers that intrigued him, an underlying belief in heroes and justice, despite the darkness of their work. And sometimes, just sometimes, a crime writer would be accepted into the literary elite, lauded for style, despite a dogged commitment to plot and pace. It would allow him to test her sense of literary self, as he intended. Madeleine d\u2019Leon would begin as a vignette of middle-class success. Professionally and personally contented. A lawyer, with a lawyer\u2019s detachment and dedication to reason, she would live in the country in fulfilment of the bourgeoisie yearning for views of trees and cows. But there was an honesty about Madeleine d\u2019Leon, a humour that recognised absurdity. Hers was a mind he wanted to know. Hers was a life suited to prose. He\u2019d been searching for her all afternoon. In the beginning, she had been elusive, soft, but she was clear now. Small, not conventionally beautiful, but with a smile that made her so. She possessed the kind of face that seemed always to be thinking. She laughed sometimes for no outwardly discernible reason, but because something in the perpetual movement of her mind had amused her. Edward dressed quickly, knowing he was late. Shirt, cuff links, watch, bow tie, dinner suit. He checked his breast pocket for the invitation, stopping to glance at the naked woman on his wall. He\u2019d purchased her in a small gallery just outside Paris, and she had owned him since then. His muse. Edward thanked her for Madeleine d\u2019Leon. Want more Sulari Gentill?

Why did you decide to use it as a frame? I was writing another novel, to be honest, when the frame of this one was conceived. That novel, too, was set in the U.S. I live in Australia, and so, to ensure I wrote the details of place correctly, I enlisted the help of a friend of mine\u2014also a novelist and, importantly, an American who was in the U.S. at the time. We\u2019d exchange emails, and he\u2019d do the legwork whenever I needed to research anything to do with location. Now my friend (let\u2019s call him Leo) is a very earnest and thorough researcher. He would send me not only information but pictures and maps and footage of things he thought might enhance the sense of place in my story. And so, to this end, he sent me a video file of a crime scene\u2014a murder that had taken place a couple of blocks from where he was staying. The footage was mainly of coroners\u2019 vans and police cordons (no bodies), but when I mentioned the video to my husband, his response was \u201cGood grief, I hope Leo\u2019s not killing people just so he can send you research.\u201d Hmmm. Of course, he wasn\u2019t\u2014I promise\u2014but it did strike me as an excellent idea for a novel. So I guess the decision was made while I was in the middle of writing another book. I put the idea to the back of my mind where it brewed until I finished the novel I was writing. When I was ready to start the manuscript that would become The Woman in the Library, I knew it would begin with \u201cDear Hannah\u2026\u201d As the emails point out, in the upcoming years, contemporary novelists will have to carefully choose whether to include the coronavirus pandemic or not. How are you thinking about that for your own writing? In addition to being a disaster on a planetary scale, the coronavirus pandemic presents contemporary novelists with a dilemma. Coronavirus is part of contemporary reality\u2014ignoring it is a little like ignoring cell phones or computers. At best, it dates the novel, and at worst, it makes the story entirely implausible. Even so, there is a real temptation for writers to, henceforth, set all our novels in 2019. Doing so would avoid the complications and distraction that COVID-19 introduces to a story. It\u2019s difficult to confine something like the pandemic, to allow it to play any small part without it taking over the narrative. It\u2019s like trying to write a novel set in France in 1917 without it becoming a war story. It can be done, but it is problematic. Moreover, the pandemic is not yet history and may not be for a long time\u2014we are not at this point sure how it will turn all out. It is a changing backdrop to everything, so it\u2019s almost impossible to write a contemporary story that will still be contemporary a year from now, and setting a novel in the near future, with the pandemic being over, is a gamble. That said, just because it\u2019s hard, just because it\u2019s risky, doesn\u2019t mean that one should not try. The challenge is, I suppose, to write about the pandemic in a way that\u2019s creative enough that it complements rather than dominates the story you\u2019re trying to tell, that is somehow timeless and contemporary, not just now but a year from now and ten years from now. In The Woman in the Library, I included the pandemic through this very dilemma. Leo demands its inclusion, Hannah refuses to let it into her story, but through them, I allowed it into mine. Cain becomes a suspect in Caroline\u2019s murder in part because of his first novel. Do you ever worry about something similar happening to you? Ha! All mystery writers probably have very incriminating google search histories! Publishing a novel is a scary proposition for so many reasons. A novel isn\u2019t just the product of a writer\u2019s mind\u2014there\u2019s a lot of the writer\u2019s heart in it too. Putting that out into the world and hoping that readers will like it is a little like sending your child to school and hoping they\u2019ll find friends. It\u2019s exciting and kind of wonderful, but also terrifying. You care more than you ever thought you would, and you worry\u2014about bad reviews, slow sales, and most of all, that readers won\u2019t like it. Arrest for murder pales by comparison! It does also occur to me that if I were a murderer, being a novelist would be a great smokescreen. There\u2019d be so much normally incriminating evidence I could explain as research. You also write the Rowland Sinclair mystery series. Does it feel significantly different to write a standalone project like this one as opposed to an ongoing series? In some ways, writing a standalone novel is like writing the first book of a series. Anything could happen because you\u2019re not building on a history established in previous books. Every character\u2019s past is a mystery to unearth. Each of them has to gain the reader\u2019s interest, make the reader care, without the benefit of past adventures together having created a bond. I suppose the big difference is that a standalone novel, as opposed to the first book of a series, requires you to say goodbye. You have to be able to finish with your characters, take them to a place where you are happy to walk away, and leave them to their own devices. For writers, at least, that can be tough. By the time a novel is written, a writer has spent hundreds of hours with the characters of her book\u2026 She has been through all manner of peril with them, so it\u2019s hard to give them up. I expect there are a few unexpected sequels that exist for no other reason than the writer missed the characters too much to stay away. \n Acknowledgments This story was sparked by a letter from Boston, written by my dear friend and colleague L. M. Vincent, whose correspondence, guidance, and encouragement I have shamelessly twisted into something sinister. For your generosity and your insight, Larry, thank you. That glimmer of a story was the recipient of a Create Grant from the Copyright Agency\u2019s Cultural Fund, which supported me to write in a year that was, to say the least, difficult. I was honoured to be awarded the grant and remain very grateful for it. The manuscript was tested for all those things that a story should be by Michael Blenkins, Leith Henry, and Robert Gott in Australia and the wonderful Barbara Peters in the U.S. I can\u2019t thank you enough for your time, your support, your advice, and your enthusiasm. My brilliant, passionate agent, Jill Marr, championed the manuscript and found it the perfect home with Anna Michels and Diane DiBiase at Sourcebooks, who have nurtured it into the best story it can be. Thank you all so much for your belief in my work and your input into this novel. I am truly grateful. Beth Deveny edited the copy into shape and in doing so ensured readers would have no evidence of my typos. Thank you, Beth. And then the extraordinary, talented Sourcebooks team turned my story into a book. And here it is. Thank you so much for picking it up. \n About the Author \u00a9 Edmund Blenkins Sulari Gentill is the author of the multi-award-winning Rowland Sinclair WWII Mysteries, a series of historical crime novels set in 1930s Australia about Rowland Sinclair, the wealthy gentleman artist cum amateur detective.
