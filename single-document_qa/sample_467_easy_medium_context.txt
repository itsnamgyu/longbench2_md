productive. The overall level of health attained is one of the key measures of the success of our 
country. Good health enables Malaysians to lead productive and fulfilling lives. In addition, a 
high level of health contributes to increased prosperity and overall social stability.
POPULATION STRUCTURE
The population of Malaysia in 2022 was estimated at 32.70 million with an annual population 
growth rate of 0.37 per cent. The total population in 2022 showed an increase of 0.12 million 
as compared to 32.58 million recorded in 2021. The geographical distribution of population

Annual Report 
 
MOH 2022
In 2022, the male population in Malaysia outnumbered the females at 17.0 million and 15.7 
million respectively, with the sex ratio recording 109 males for every 100 females. The population 
was predominantly urban, with 75.5 per cent of the total population living in urban areas, and 
24.5 per cent of the population living in the rural areas (Table 1.2). The economically-active 
(working age) population which consists of population aged 15 to 64 years was 22.8 million or 
69.6 per cent of the total population. Meanwhile, young age and old age population were 7.6 
million (23.2%) and 2.4 million (7.2%) respectively.

The dependency ratio is the number of people in the young and old age groups that must be 
borne for every 100 people in the working age group. This ratio can be disaggregated into 
the total dependency ratio, young age dependency ratio and the old age dependency ratio. 
The total dependency ratio decreased to 43.7 in 2022 compared to 44.1 in 2021. The young 
dependency ratio also showed a declining trend to record 33.3 from 34.0. Meanwhile, the 
old age dependency ratio recorded an increasing trend at 10.4 as compared to 10.1 in the 
previous year.
HEALTH STATUS
Health status is measured by the health condition of the individual and the population as a 
whole. It can be measured through some health status indicators such as life expectancy at 
birth, mortality and morbidity.

Annual Report 
MOH 2022
Life Expectancy at Birth
Life expectancy is the average remaining age (years) for a person is expected to live at the 
beginning of the certain age. Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn 
infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth are to stay the same 
throughout its life. In 2022, the life expectancy at birth for Malaysian population decreased by 
0.6 years to 73.8 years as opposed to 74.4 years in 2012. A similar situation was observed for 
males and females. The life expectancy for males has decreased by 0.7 years to 71.5 years in 
2022 as compared to 72.2 years in 2012, whereas for females also decreased by 0.5 years to 
76.4 years from 76.9 years. The declining trend observed in life expectancy for the period of 
2020 to 2022 was attributed to the increase in the number of excess deaths during pandemic 
COVID-19 in 2021. (Figure 1.1).

Mortality 
Mortality data provides a useful endpoint for measuring health. These data provide a 
comprehensive picture of the health of the community, for each individual. 
The trends for crude mortality rate (CDR), neonatal mortality rate (NMR), infant mortality rate 
(IMR) and maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Malaysia for the period of 1990 to 2021 are shown 
in Figure 1.2. From 1990 to 2021, the CDR in Malaysia has increased from 4.6 per 1,000 
population in 1990 to 6.9 per 1,000 population in 2021. The significant increase was also 
reflected in the ratio of maternal mortality from 18.6 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 68.2 per 
100,000 live births in 2021. However, neonatal and infant mortality rates showed a decline from 
8.5 to 4.1 per 1,000 live births and 13.1 to 6.1 per 1,000 live births respectively during the same 
period. The trends for other mortality rates are shown in Table 1.3.

Morbidity 
The health status of a community is usually measured in terms of morbidity, which focuses on the 
incidence or prevalence of disease.
Hospitalisation indicates the severity of disease that needs further treatment, stabilisation of 
patients or the need of isolation in order to prevent the spreading of the diseases to others. 
The number of admissions in Ministry of Health (MOH) Hospitals in 2022 showed an increase 
of 165,462 or 6.99 per cent to record 2,532,126 as compared to 2,366,664 in the previous year. 
The 10 principal causes of hospitalization in the MOH Hospitals for 2022 are shown in Table 1.4. 
The diseases were classified based on the International Statistical Classification of Disease 10th 
Revision (ICD10). In 2022, Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium remained as the top cause 
of admissions in MOH hospitals at 19.71 per cent, followed by Diseases of the respiratory system 
(13.43%) and Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period (9.19%).

MOH has launched a cashless payment system at its facilities starting from October 2022, as part 
of the Malaysian Digital Economy Blueprint 2021. This blueprint has mandated all federal and 
state government agencies to switch to cashless transaction for greater efficiency for year 2022.
Furthermore, this initiative aligns with MOH Anti-Corruption Plan 2021 - 2022 which highlights 
the adoption of cashless payment methods in KK as means to prevent fraudulent activities in the 
government’s revenue collection process. To facilitate this transition, 1,911 Terminal Point-of-
Sale (TPOS) were initially installed at MOH’s facilities in October 2022, the number of installations 
subsequently increased to 3,675 TPOS terminals by the end of December 2022. 
Figure 4.2 illustrates the increase in the number of recorded cashless payment transactions 
within a three-month period of implementation (October to December 2022) compared to the 
same period in the previous year, prior to the implementation of the cashless payment initiative 
in MOH facilities.

In 2022, MOH has undertook procurement amounting to RM6,059,494,450.62 and obtained 
savings of RM500,405,873.37 or 8 per cent which covered the procurement of pharmaceuticals, 
medical equipment, services, ICT, vehicles, outsourcing and concession. Table 4.5 shows the 
achievement of MOH Procurement in year 2022 by categories.
In line with the national resource optimisation policy, MOH had secured savings in procurement 
expenditure to ensure the allocation received is sufficient to cover core services and patient care 
needs. This was also to ensure health care services were not affected. The savings obtained were 
based onthe comparisons between the department’s estimated price with the contract prices 
offered as well as negotiated prices from companies.

e-PROCUREMENT (eP) SYSTEM
The eP Ssystem which was developed in the year 2000 serves as an online platform to enable 
government agencies to procure online supplies and services from the gGovernment-registered 
vendors. The eP Ssystem is one of the largest Government-to-Business (G2B) virtual markets in 
ASEAN with two (2) million online catalogues. Starting from January 2018, MOF has introduced 
an improved eP System. Based on the records, MOH is the largest eP System user compared 
to other ministries and has been using the eP System optimally. Table 4.6 shows the Ministry’s 
achievement in the use of the eP System for the years 2020 to 2022.

Annual Report 
MOH 2022
There was an increase in the use of the eP System in 2022 compared to the previous year. MOF 
has stipulated that procurement be fully implemented 100 per cent using the eP System. However, 
some procurements such as the procurement for Hospital Support Services have been exempted 
and implemented manually. Similarly, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 at the end of 2019, it 
hasrendered that some of the planned procurements were unable to be conducted and immediate 
procurement needed to be implemented as an Emergency Procurement basis under Treasury 
Instruction (AP) 173.2.
OUTSOURCING HEALTH SERVICES OF NON COVID-19 PATIENTS TO 
PRIVATE HOSPITALS
MOH has been providing healthcare services for non-COVID-19 patients via outsourcing starting 
in 2020. Between April to August 2021, there was a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases and MOH 
neededs to provide more beds for COVID-19 patients. This resulted in the vast majority of non-
COVID-19 patients being referred to private hospitals. 
The implementation of outsourcing patient healthcare services from MOH hospitals to private 
hospitals has continued in 2022 with the main focus is to resolve backlog cases due to the previous 
outbreak of COVID-19. Through this initiative, a total of 5,108 surgical cases, 20,632 non-surgical 
cases and 735 follow-up treatment cases had been successfully outsourced to private hospitals 
with an expenditure of RM44.64 million. 
CONCESSION AGREEMENT
The Procurement and Privatisation Division is responsible for managing three (3) privatisation 
projects and two (2) outsourcing services-based projects as follow:
Service Privatisation Projects
i.	
Hospital Support Service (PSH);
ii.	 Medical Equipment Enhancement Tenure (MEET)); and
iii.	 Concession of Makmal Ubat & dan Stor.
Outsourcing Projects
i.	
Foreign Workers Medical Examination Coordination & Surveillance System (FWMES) in 
Peninsular Malaysia and Federal Territories of Labuan; and
ii.	 Supply and Delivery of Hologram Safety Labels for Registered Pharmaceutical Products under 
MOH.
These projects have provided various benefits to the government. The implementation of The PSH 
and MEET projects have enabled comprehensive maintenance on the facility and biomedical 
equipment. The concession of Makmal Ubat dan Stor has facilitated the supply of drugs and 
non-drugs to all MOH facilities. The FWMES project has assisted MOH in ensuring only healthy 
foreign workers are eligible to work in Malaysia. The Supply and Delivery of Hologram Safety Label 
project on the other hand has prevented unregistered pharmaceutical products from being sold 
in the market.

SPECIAL PROGRAMME SECTOR 
The establishment of Flying Doctor Services (FDS) for the Orang Asli (OA) in the rural area of 
Peninsular Malaysia back in year 2013 had become one of the main measures addressing 
healthcare accessibility issues for the population. It links efforts to address communicable 
diseases and maternal, infant and child health to the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) agenda 
among marginalised populations including the OA. 
Ever since the first flight in the year 2013 until current years, the FDS unit which is based at Hospital 
Bahagia Ulu Kinta under Kinta District Health Office (PKD) in Perak operations, continued to 
provide health services for marginalised people in 17 remote OA villages which are difficult to 
reach by land or water as showed in the following Table 5.1.  Data has recorded fluctuation in 
percentages of FDS number of visits to the OA villages proxy by the number of flying days by the 
FDS team as projected in the following Figure 5.1.  There was a good response received from 
the local OA population for each clinic session run by the FDS team as portrayed in Image 5.1.

The long-term planning is to reduce 
dependency on this FDS service which 
involves major financial implications. 
With the progress of infrastructure in 
terms of land road facilities, health 
services for the OA inland will be 
focused on the OA Mobile Team (Land) 
which is more cost-effective with longer 
contact time with patients than via FDS 
visits.

PROCUREMENT AND SUPPLY OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE)
PPE is an equipment worn to minimise exposure to hazards and for protection against infectious 
materials that caused serious workplace injuries and illnesses. The supply of suitable and sufficient 
PPE is very important especially in the implementation of disease prevention, control and treatment 
activities in the hospitals and health clinics. Malaysia has entered the transition to endemic 
phase following the effectiveness of public health preventive and control measures in managing 
transmission of COVID-19 infection in the country since 1 April 2022. However, all MOH facilities 
still need to ensure the healthcare system’s preparedness is always strengthened to face any risk 
of COVID-19 resurgence cases or threat of another epidemic in the future. 
A total of 18 types of PPE items were required by healthcare personnel for the management of 
COVID-19 outbreak. In year 2022, total of RM85.4 million allocated under the COVID-19 Fund had 
been distributed for PPE procurement and supplies to all MOH facilities. Until 31 December 2022, 
all State Health Departments including Hospital Kuala Lumpur managed to keep at least one (1) 
month stock for all types of PPE. Continuous monitoring of PPE stock is always implemented to 
ensure continuity of supply for healthcare workers, especially frontliners.

TOBACCO CONTROL SECTOR  AND FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON 
TOBACCO CONTROL (FCTC) SECRETARIAT
IMPLEMENTATION OF GENERATIONAL ENDGAME (GEG)
A productive nation starts from a healthy generation. Tobacco products have been proven to 
cause the death of more than 27,000 Malaysians every year and cause various complications of 
NCDs such as lung cancer, heart problems, and chronic lung problems. Therefore, in the MOH 
efforts to curb the problem of NCD the control over tobacco and smoking products use must start 
from a young age.
The MOH had introduced the proposal for the implementation of GEG. This initiative is a lifelong 
protection for the generation born from 1 January 2007, onwards, from the dangers of any tobacco 
and smoking products, including electronic cigarettes or vaping under the new MOH Act. This 
proposal was announced by the Minister of Health, at the 150th World Health Organization 
Conference in Geneva, Switzerland on 27 January 2022. It had received support from many 
societies and NGOs in Malaysia. This noble effort is also supported and will be continued by the 
current Minister of Health.

KOSPEN WOW PROGRAMME 
Previously known as KOSPEN Plus, the KOSPEN WOW programme is a comprehensive workplace 
health intervention programme developed by the MOH aimed at reducing the burden of NCD and 
related risk factors among employees by empowering employers and employees to the direction 
of a healthy lifestyle. It is a platform that targets employees and environmental change to support 
behaviour modification of health in the workplace both in the public or private sector with the motto 
of Towards Wellness of Workers. The KOSPEN WOW programme commenced  seven (7) years 
ago and has encompassed 84,547 workers from 1,298 agencies.
In year 2022, 185 new agencies have successfully enrolled into the programme and acting as a 
platform for health screening of the National Health Screening Initiative (under the Agenda National 
Malaysia Sihat), a total of 12,002 (91 per cent) workers were screened for NCD risk factors through 
the KOSPEN WOW programme this years. Despite the challenges faced during the COVID-19 
pandemic, this programme managed to sustain and remained relevant in continuing to provide 
health intervention and prevention activities at the workplace. The official KOSPEN WOW portal 
(www.moh.gov.my/kospenwow) was updated and improvised to be the one-stop source to obtain

TB AND LEPROSY  CONTROL SECTORS
NATIONAL TUBERCULOSIS (TB) PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAMME 
Malaysia is classified as an upper moderate TB burden country with an incidence rate of TB in 2022 
was 75 per 100,000 population. WHO estimated TB incidence for Malaysia in 2022 was 97 per 
100,000 population that was higher than our achievement. Therefore, Malaysia needs to increase 
Active Case Detection (ACD) activities, which include enhancing high risk group screening and 
out-reach screening at the high prevalence TB area in order to achieve this target.
Contact tracing is one of the core activities and has been implemented in Malaysia to control TB 
transmission. The identified contact will be screened for latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB 
disease. For 2022, a total of 60,396 (59 per cent) of contacts of pulmonary TB smear positive 
were screened for LTBI and 167,659 (81.6 per cent) contacts of all TB cases were screened for 
active TB disease. Total of 852 cases were detected TB positive. Initiatives to increase TB case 
detection were as below:

In July 2022, Pahang State Health Department conducted its first pilot project on Post Exposure 
Prophylaxis – Single Dose Rifampicin (PEP - SDR) for the high-risk community at Kampung Sawah 
Batu in Pekan district, Pahang. The OA village is one of the endemic localities with a population 
of 688 people. The prophylaxis treatment was given to 484 (70 per cent) villagers who fulfilled the 
criteria. They then will be monitored for signs and symptoms of leprosy as per schedule. Based 
on a study (COLEP Study), PEP - SDR treatment isvassociated with a reduction in risk of leprosy 
of 57 per cent over two (2) years and of 30 per cent over 5 to 6 years. Administration of PEP - SDR 
by blanket approach is a prevention method especially among communities living in endemic 
locality with high burden of leprosy. Beginning in 2023, PEP - SDR will be a programme under the 
leprosy preventive activity for closed contacts and identified high-risk groups.

children, polio vaccine in the form of hexavalent combination vaccine Diphtheria-Tetanus-Acellular 
Pertussis-Polio-Hepatitis B-Haemophilus Influenzae Type B (DTaP-Hep B-Hib) is given free of 
charge to all non-citizen children aged seven (7) years old and below from January 2022 onwards, 
to optimise polio vaccination coverage in the country. 
Malaysia remains measles endemic in 2022 with a rise in cases reported following the opening of 
all economic sectors. An increase in Rubella, Pertussis, Diphtheria, and Hepatitis B cases were 
also reported. However, a downtrend number of neonatal tetanus was recorded in year 2022. 
THE NATIONAL COVID-19 IMMUNISATION PROGRAMME (PICK)
PICK which commenced on 24 February 2021 is one of the most important milestones in controlling 
the COVID-19 pandemic in this country. Along with other public health interventions, PICK 
succeeded in reducing the COVID-19 cases, especially the severe cases including death and 
subsequently restored the public health burden of the country. In year 2022, the scope of PICK 
was extended to children aged five (5) to under 12 years old which started on 2 February 2022. 
The first booster dose started on 14 April 2021 while the second booster dose started on 18b July 
2022. By the end of year 2022, all residents aged 12 years and older are eligible to receive the 
second booster dose, while residents aged five (5) to under 12 years are eligible to receive the first 
booster dose. As of 31 December 2022, 85.3 per cent of the population have completed primary 
dose, 49.8 per cent have received the first booster dose while 1.9 per cent of the population 
received second booster dose.
SURVEILLANCE ON FOOD AND WATER-BORNE DISEASES
In year 2022, we have seen the increase in the incidence rate by 100 per cent and episodes of food 
poisoning from 202 in 2021 to 392 in 2022 (94 per cent increment) after the opening of schools 
and workplaces in April 2022. Out of these 392 episodes, 137 (35.9 per cent) episodes occurred 
in MOE schools, 43 episodes (10.9 per cent occurred in Non-MOE schools, 55 episodes (14 per 
cent ) in institutions besides schools, 83 episodes (21.2 per cent ) occurred at homes and 74 
episodes (18.9 per cent ) occurred in other localities.
Since 2016, the annual IR for Typhoid, Cholera, Dysentery, Hepatitis A was lower than 1.0 per 
100,000 population. However, there were no significant changes between 2017 and 2022.  
VECTOR BORNE DISEASE SECTOR
NATIONAL DENGUE CONTROL PROGRAMME 
In year 2022, Malaysia has reported a total of 66,102 dengue cases with 56 deaths compared to 
26,365 cases with 20 deaths in the same period of 2021. This shows there is an increase of 150.7 
per cent of dengue cases and an increase of 180.0 per cent of deaths this year.


86
Annual Report 
MOH 2022
Dengue remains a public health threat at both national and global level which requires commitment 
from various stakeholders to deliver strategic measures in handling this dynamic vector borne 
disease. In view of this,the National Strategy Plan for Dengue Prevention and Control (NSPDPC) 
has been introduced in year 2022 to outline the national dengue plan for five (5) years until 2026. 
The formulation of this strategic plan is based on three (3) main thrusts and two (2) supporting 
elements which entails 22 strategies with a total 41 initiatives and 54 indicators. 
The three (3) thrusts are set to focus on consolidation of existing dengue surveillance systems, 
to emphasise the accessibility to dengue detection, diagnosis, treatment as well as to priorities 
dengue prevention and control efforts. In addition, the two supporting elements to these three 
(3) thrusts aim to strengthen catalytical factors of sustainable health systems and dengue related 
research. Overall, this NSPDPC serves to empower the implementation of field dengue prevention 
and control activities to reduce dengue burden, including death in Malaysia. 
Until year 2022, Wolbachia Mosquito Operation (WMO) has been introduced in 28 localities 
with high dengue burden across seven (7) states. Initial analysis shows dengue case reduction 
between 33 per cent to 100 per cent among localities that have implemented WMO for at least 
two (2) years. 
ZERO INDIGENOUS MALARIA INFECTION
In year 2022, Malaysia had successfully maintained zero indigenous human malaria for the fifth 
consecutive year. However, there were 286 cases of imported and 15 introduced human malaria 
reported in 2022. Zoonotic malaria remained the main malaria species in Malaysia with 2,514 
cases reported, giving the total of malaria reported in the country to 2,815 cases. Importation of 
human malaria remains a challenge to the malaria elimination programme which is contributed 
by either an influx of foreign workers or Malaysian workers returning from endemic countries.
Zoonotic malaria has become the main malaria burden as human infections with P. knowlesi now 
account for the majority of malaria-related morbidity and mortality in Malaysia. The programme has 
introduced a new vector control strategy for zoonotic malaria by implementing Outdoor Residual 
Spray (ORS) using a new insecticide formulation which is weather resistant namely the K-othrine 
Polyzone. In year 2022, 39 localities in Sabah were selected to implement ORS and all localities 
reported significant reduction of zoonotic malaria cases.
Currently, the malaria elimination programme has entered the Prevention of Malaria Re-
establishment (POR) phase and it continues to strengthen strategies that have proven to be 
effective during the elimination phase. Under this phase, the malaria stratification strategy is based 
on malaria foci classification and malariogenic potential of localities. Apart from proactive case 
detection, populations living in active foci, residual non-active foci and cleared foci with high or 
medium malariogenic potential are given protection with Long Lasting Insecticide Net (LLIN) and 
Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS).

The MOH has renewed prevention strategies across multiple sectors which are educational, 
social and healthcare systems. The PROSTAR 2.0 programme is a school-based programme 
to increase teenagers resilience and awareness about HIV, sexually-transmitted infections and 
effective preventive options. The PROSTAR 2.0 module was launched in year 2022. Training of 
trainers workshop had been conducted for 42 representatives from all state health departments 
from 11 to 13 October 2022.
The young people who are sexually active and at-risk of HIV infection would benefit from improved 
access to sexual health services, including HIV testing. In year 2022, the MOH Public Health 
Programme Policy and Exco Committee had approved the HIV Self-Testing Guideline for national 
implementation.
MOH had rolled out Quality Improvement (QI) interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination 
experienced by People Living with HIV (PLHIVs) in health settings. The intervention package 
includes improved quality of care via: people-centred care delivery, knowledge management, 
decision support. After implementing the QI strategies, revaluation showed general reduction 
in discrimination against PLHIV in participating health facilities. The programme has expanded 
since year 2020, from 11 MOH facilities to 55 MOH facilities in year 2022.

reported in Malaysia. In year 2022, 2,268,591 COVID-19 cases have been reported with 5,366 
deaths (0.2 per cent). This represents a reduction in 15.2 per cent COVID-19 cases and 82.7 per 
cent death cases respectively compared to year 2021. 
Three (3) peaks were observed throughout year 2022 which was during Epidemiological Week 
(EW) 10/2022, EW 29/2022 and EW 44/2022. The first peak is an extension after Malaysia first 
detected the Omicron variant in December 2021, which led to sharp increase of COVID-19 cases 
in the begninning of year 2022. With the widely transmitted Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus, 
Malaysia reported the highest number of daily new cases, which was 33,406 cases on 5 March 
2022. To address the surge number of cases, the National COVID-19 Rapid Response Task Force 
(RRTF 2.0) was reactivated, jointly led by the Deputy Director General of Health (Public Health) 
and the Deputy Director General of Health (Medical). Among the strategies implemented were:
i.	
Ensuring the availability of essential infrastructure and facilities; 
ii. Strengthening the PICK by focusing on vaccinating children aged five (5) to below 12 years 
old and booster doses administration;

MOH 2022
iii.	 Ensuring the management and distribution of resources and assets at optimal level; and
iv.	 Delivering effective strategic communication to reduce and ease anxiety among the general 
public. 
Later, following the relaxation of measures implemented during the Transition to the Endemic 
Phase; and re-opening of our international borders in April 2022, the peak of the second wave 
was observed in July 2022. Meanwhile, the third wave was observed starting from EW 42/2022 
following detection of the new subvariant of Omicron, which is known as XBB. The overall Malaysia 
COVID-19 incidence rate for year 2022 is 6,626 per 100,000 population. Age group between 20 
to 29 years old has recorded the highest incidence rate with 9,492 per 100,000 while the lowest 
was from the age group of five (5) to 19 years old with 4,492 per 100,000 population. In view of 
this, the campaign for COVID-19 booster dose among those eligible aged 18 and above, has 
been intensified to prevent severe complications of infection of COVID-19.

DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC NATIONAL CENTRE FOR DISEASE CONTROL 
(eNCDC)
eNCDC is being developed as an integrated and comprehensive Public Health Information 
System. This project was approved under 12th Malaysian Plan (12MP) as a part of National 
Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) project. Development of eNCDC is very crucial to support 
main functions of NCDC, as Public Health Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) and Public Health 
Reference Laboratory (PHRL). There are two (2) main objectives for this project which are:
i.	
Development of comprehensive Public Health Information System integrated with MOH, non 
MOH related system, laboratory analyser, health, and surveillance devices; and
ii.	 Development of mobile application of eNCDC for health managers and healthcare workers.
There were three (3) main activities held by eNCDC team during the year of 2022, which are:
i.	
Completion of EA document for Disease Control Division (Figure 5.11);
ii.	 eNCDC Market Survey activities; and
iii.	 eNCDC budget application submission via Rolling Plan 4, 12MP.
The Planning Phase of eNCDC will start in 2023 with the advice and consultation from MAMPU 
ICT team.

FAMILY HEALTH DEVELOPMENT DIVISION (BPKK)
APPOINTMENT SYSTEM USING MYSEJAHTERA IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE 
BPKK is always committed to support efforts towards the digitalisation of the health system, in 
line with the PSP KKM 2021-2025 and MOH agenda to make MySejahtera application as a public 
health application. In relation to that, for the standardisation of the appointment system at health 
facilities, the appointment system using the MySejahtera has been introduced and will gradually 
replace other existing online appointment systems. The direction for this change considers the 
current situation where there are multiple appointment systems in primary healthcare facilities 
with limited numbers of facilities that have access to the online appointment system.
This appointment system aims to improve service efficiency and facilitate client access to services 
provided at primary health facilities. Initially, the system was opened for appointments booking 
at primary health facilities for the National Health Screening Initiative (NHSI) and Skim Peduli 
Kesihatan untuk Kumpulan B40 (PeKa B40) Health Screening. The Quit Smoking Service (KBM) 
was also added and can be booked from October 2022.
On 28 December 2022, additional health services were added to the list following the demand and 
traffic usage data analysis of the MySejahtera appointment function. Currently, there are eight (8) 
types of main health services displayed in the MySejahtera as follows: 
i.	
Outpatient Treatment;
ii.	 National Health Screening Initiative (NHSI);
iii.	 PeKa B40 Health Screening;
iv.	 Pre-Employment and Education Medical Screening;
v.	 Pre-Marital Screening;
vi.	 Quit Smoking Service (KBM);
vii.	 Family Planning Services; and
viii.	Procedure.


94
Annual Report 
MOH 2022
There is also an additional function in the MySejahtera appointment system whereby follow-up 
appointments can be allocated following the assessment by medical officers at the clinics, for 
more than 50 types of health services such as Diabetic Treatment, Asthma Treatment, Geriatrics 
Services, Physiotherapy and others. This appointment system also helps the healthcare facilities 
to arrange service schedules based on their respective capacities to avoid congestion at the 
registration counter and waiting area. However, for emergency cases, patients can walk-in to the 
health facility as usual and do not need to make an appointment.
NATIONAL HEALTH SCREENING INITIATIVE (NHSI)
NHSI was launched on 16 July 2022 by the Minister of Health under the third pillar of Agenda 
Nasional Malaysia Sihat (ANMS) to empower individual self-health control. This initiative was 
aimed to increase public awareness of the importance of regular health screening, to increase the 
number of Malaysians getting regular health screening and to establish a population screening 
database through MySejahtera. 
From July to 31 Disember 2022, a total of 893,519 screenings were conducted in public health 
clinics under NHSI with 801,864 clients screened using basic NCD screening with Point of Care 
Testing (POCT) and 91,655 clients received Benefit Package 1: PeKa B40 Health Screening. 47 
per cent of individuals screened were known to have NCD diseases, 38 per cent were in the pre-
disease stage of NCD, 5 per cent were at risk of developing NCD and 10 per cent were healthy.

ADULT HEALTH
CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING AND BREAST CANCER EARLY DETECTION 
PROGRAMME YEAR 2022
The women’s reproductive cancer screening programme includes screening for cervical and 
breast cancer. Currently, Pap smear or liquid-based cytology test and HPV test are the main 
screening methods in the MOH. The cervical cancer screening is targeted at women between the 
age of 30 to 65 who are sexually active. For the breast cancer prevention programme, the early 
detection through clinical breast examination and mammogram were implemented in the primary 
healthcare. Women aged 20 and over are eligible to undergo clinical breast examination at all 
health facilities whereas mammogram test is recommended for every two (2) years for women 
over 40 years old whose mammogram results are normal.


99
Annual Report 
 
MOH 2022
A total of 323,035 women have undergone cervical cancer screening tests in 13 states (except 
Perak, Pahang and FT of Labuan) up to September 2022. This amount contributes to 15.4 per cent 
coverage of women who have been screened. From this number, a total of 49,616 (15.4 per cent 
of the total screened) underwent an HPV test while 273,419 (85.6 per cent) were screened using 
the cytology method. From the HPV screening test, a total of 3,461 (4.0 per cent) were detected 
positive for high-risk HPV which referred for follow-up and further intervention. A total of 775 cases 
were referred for colposcopy where 183 cases (45.3 per cent) were found to have precancer and 
seven (7) cases (1.7 per cent) had cancer.
For breast cancer screening programme, a total of 1,222,596 (20.6 per cent) women aged 20 
and over have undergone clinical breast examination until September 2022. A total of 29,113 
women aged 40 who are at high risk for breast cancer have been registered for mammogram 
screening. Out of these, a total of 10,658 (36.6 per cent) women have undergone this screening. 
Mammogram results found that 85 (0.8 per cent) women had breast cancer who were referred 
for further treatment.
MATERNAL HEALTH
In year 2022, activities continued to emphasize on COVID-19-related activities among pregnant 
women; creating public awareness on its complications and importance of booster dose of 
COVID-19 vaccine. Specific sessions of enquiry into death related to COVID-19 were conducted 
to determine the cause of death and remedial actions. The task force has compiled selected 
content in relation to pregnancy and COVID-19 infection to form a special report on COVID-19 
in Pregnancy and Puerperium: Lessons from The Malaysia Confidential Enquiry Maternal Death 
Report 2021. The targeted approach of Pre-Pregnancy Care (PPC) aiming at high-risk women 
was implemented in KKs in year 2019. 
In July 2022, BPKK initiated a discussion and consensus with the Medical Development Division, 
Obstetrics & Gynaecology (O&G) fraternity and other relevant specialties, with the development of 
PPC guidelines in hospitals.  BPKK has also shared this concept during the training programme 
with member countries of OIC for Thematic Area 3: Maternal Health, New-Born & Child Health and 
Nutrition. The online training was conducted on 23 to 24 November 2022 in collaboration with the 
Policy and International Relations Division (BDHA). In tandem with amendment to the postnatal 
visit schedule, BPKK has revisited the reporting format for Postnatal Care Nursing (PNN). A virtual 
briefing was conducted to key health personnels at the state and clinic on 22 February 2022.
ELDERLY HEALTH 
In year 2022, priority was given to the preparation of the Elderly Health Service Action Plan 
2023-2030 (PTPKWE 2023-2030), the Dementia Action Plan 2023-2030 and the Programme for 
Expanding the Role of Community Nurses (JM) in Elderly Healthcare in the Rural Clinics (KD).
PTPKWE 2023-2030 was revised to ensure it remains relevant in facing the country’s ageing 
challenges, in line with the concept of Healthy Aging in the Life Cycle (From Womb to Tomb) and 
the 10 Decade of Healthy Aging. The Dementia Action Plan 2023-2030 has been prepared to 
ensure dementia patients can lead optimal lives. The JM role expansion programme at KD is a 
strategy to expand services through Community Based Primary Healthcare. It was implemented 
in stages involving 10 states where Johor, FT of Labuan, Sabah and Sarawak will be implemented 
in year 2023.

HEALTHCARE FOR PERSON WITH DISABILITIES (PWD)
STRENGTHENING OF DOMICILIARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES (DHC) 
The planning and implementation of DHC in primary healthcare is carried out comprehensively 
which includes the scope of palliative care medicine. The implementation of the scope of palliative 
care medicine which was started in four (4) states with residential Palliative Medicine Specialists 
from year 2016, was expanded to five (5) more states in year 2022. Currently, a total of 94 KKs 
in 11 states are providing palliative care medicine services for patients in the community. The 
DHC programme was further strengthened with the addition of 177 KKs, making it a total of 337 
healthcare throughout Malaysia.
For year 2022, a total of 7,500 patients and their family members have benefited from the DHC 
programme in which 70 per cent of the patients were the elderly. Meanwhile, 120 patients have 
been enrolled in the palliative care medicine programme. Holistic health services delivered by 
multi-disciplinary health personnel in the community are fully supported by the medical specialists 
at the hospital. This collaboration facilitates the implementation and improves the quality of 
services for the patient.
EARLY DETECTION OF DISABILITY IN CHILDREN AND EARLY INTERVENTION 
PROGRAMME 
Early detection of disability in children is a crucial element in health services which indicates that 
more children are screened at an early age and subsequently given holistic intervention as early 
as possible. This is one of the initiatives to identify the risk of disability among children and thus 
planning of intensive care to reduce severe complications due to disability. 
To ensure that this initiative is prioritised, the outcome indicator for the early childhood intervention 
programme namely the Percentage of Detection of Disability Among Children Aged 0-1 Years is 
used as one of the main key performance indicators of MOH. The achievement of this indicator 
shows an upward trend yearly following the consistent screening of every child by health personnel.
For year 2022, 650 (0.1 per cent) children aged 0 - 1 year old from 470,195 estimated live births 
were identified with disabilities in Malaysia. Those children were given appropriate treatment, 
early intervention and were referred to the respective multidisciplinary team for further evaluation 
and rehabilitation.
NUTRITION DIVISION
PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAMME FOR ANAEMIA AMONG PREGNANT 
MOTHERS
Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the common cause of anaemia among pregnant mothers. 
It occurs due to the increment of iron and other vitamin requirement for the development of 
foetus and maternal physiological changes during pregnancy. The percentage of anaemia with 
Haemoglobin (Hb) less than 11 gm/dL among pregnant mothers who attended government 
health clinics at 36 weeks of gestation decreased from 15.0 per cent in year 2012 to 5.5 per cent 
in September 2022. The trend of achievement is as shown in Figure 5.15.

PERCENTAGE OF EXCLUSIVELY BREASTFED SIX-MONTH-OLD INFANTS 
THAT ATTENDED HEALTH CLINIC
Exclusive breastfeeding referring to the baby who is given only breast milk. Babies are not given 
any other food or drink except Oral Rehydration Salt (ORS), vitamins, minerals and medicine in 
the form of drops or syrup on doctor’s advice or due to medical necessity. In order to identify 
breastfeeding practices among mothers who attend health clinics, the MOH monitors the percentage 
of breastfeeding exclusively for babies aged six (6) months up to six (6) months a week.
The achievement trend of exclusively breastfed babies from birth to the age of six (6) months in 
Malaysia is increasing every year starting from year 2009 until now as shown in Figure 5.16. In 
year 2022, 73.1 per cent of babies are exclusively breastfed. This achievement has already met 
the target of the KPI 2022 and the National Plan of Action for Nutrition in Malaysia, NPANM III 
2016 – 2025, which is ≥ 70 per cent of babies were exclusively breastfed from birth up to six (6) 
months of age. This increasing trend shows a positive achievement of promotion, protection, and 
support of breastfeeding activities in Malaysia.

Annual Report 
MOH 2022
Figure 5.17 showed the achievement trend by the state for three consecutive years, 2020, 2021, 
and 2022. Based on the figure, almost all states have achieved the NPANM II and KPI 2022 targets 
except for six (6) states which were Perlis, Pulau Pinang, Perak, Melaka, FT Labuan and Sarawak. 
Overall, the trend of exclusive breastfeeding for the last three (3) years in most states experienced 
a relatively slow increase in the percentage and there was a decrease in some states such as 
Pulau Pinang, Perak, Melaka, FT Labuan and Sarawak. This situation is particularly noticeable 
in the FT Labuan where there was a significant decrease in the percentage of babies who are 
exclusively breastfed from year 2021 (60.9 per cent) to 2022 (40.3 per cent) which is 20.6 per cent.

State-specific and strategic action plans need to be developed especially for states that experience 
a slow decrease or increase in the percentage of exclusive breastfeeding. This is important to 
organise activities and planning actions according to the factors that have been identified as the 
main problem to achieve the target that has been set.

The WHO and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) had launched the BFHI, a global initiative 
that aims to provide every baby the greatest start in life by creating a hospital environment that 
supports breastfeeding. The hospital must comply with standards given by WHO and UNICEF to 
be recognised as a Baby-Friendly Hospital. Every three (3) years, Baby-Friendly Hospital will be 
reassessed. The percentage of Baby-Friendly Hospitals successfully to be recertified as BFHI is 
used as an indicator to evaluate the management of this initiative at the operational level. 
In year 2022, a total of 53 hospitals from 14 states except for Perlis and the FT Putrajaya have been 
reassessed. The national achievement for this indicator is 95.3 per cent exceeding the set target 
which is ≥ 90 per cent. Three (3) states FT of Kuala Lumpur, Perak, and Kedah. The achievement 
of year 2022 by the state is shown in Figure 5.18.

NUMBER OF NEW CASES REGISTERED UNDER REHABILITATION PROGRAMME 
FOR UNDERNOURISHED CHILDREN (PPKZM)
PPKZM aims to improve the nutritional status of children aged six (6) months to six (6) years old from 
low-income families who attend government health clinics. Interventions under this programme 
involve special monitoring where registered children will be given basic food aid on monthly basis 
and education related to children’s and nutrition, personal as well as environment hygiene and 
home visit done by health personnel. Progress of nutritional status of these children is assessed 
monthly using weight, length/height measurements. In addition, family of the children who received 
food aid under this programme also being referred to other relevant agencies for other support 
services that outside the jurisdiction of MOH. In year 2022, children with undernutrition other than 
underweight such as children with wasting, stunting, at risk of undernutrition and anaemia has 
been registered to the programme.  
The number of new cases under this extended scope were based on cases registered from April 
to December 2022. During that particular period, total of 4,245 cases has been registered. The 
largest portion of new cases registered was children with underweight problem which were 2,925 
cases (68.9 per cent) followed by stunting, 901 cases (21.2 per cent) and wasting, 310 cases 
(7.3 per cent). The percentage of new cases according to nutritional problems is as Figure 5.19.

This initiative also aims to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target to end all 
forms of malnutrition by 2030, in line with National Policy which is National Children Policy and 
National Nutrition Policy of Malaysia 2.0.
PERCENTAGE OF UNDERWEIGHT CHILDREN WITH WEIGHT INCREMENT IN 
PPKZM BASED ON WHO GROWTH STANDARD 2006
Early monitoring and effective case management in PPKZM will help to speed up the case recovery 
period. Therefore, every new registered case with moderate underweight problem will be assessed 
for weight gain in the first three (3) months while children with severe underweight problem will 
be assessed for weight gain in the first six (6) months. This indicator is used as a performance 
indicator for case management at the field and national level. 
In year 2022, national achievement for this indicator was recorded at 73.2 per cent, exceeding the 
set target of ≥ 70 per cent. At state level, all states have achieved the set target except Sarawak, 
Sabah, Melaka and FT Labuan. The achievement for year 2022 by state is as shown in Figure 5.21.

EMPOWERMENT OF PIBG/PIBKS TO COMBAT OBESITY IN SCHOOL - INISIATIF 
CARA HIDUP ANDA TERBAIK (C-HAT) 2022
The C-HAT initiative is a smart collaboration between the MOH and MOE as one of the strategies 
to combat obesity among school students by using PIBG/PIBKS who are trained as ambassadors 
or agents to implement C-HAT activities towards healthy eating and lifestyle at school. Health 
knowledge and awareness among parents and teachers is very important to create behavioral 
changes towards school students. Schools are also the best place to implement health intervention 
programmes with a multidisciplinary approach, including nutrition education, behavior modification 
and training. This is because the children have started to be independent with their own food and 
activity selection.
The C-HAT initiative becomes the KPI of the Director of the Nutrition Division in year 2022, the 
percentage of PIBG that have a C-HAT Lead Trainer (JU) (Cara Hidup Anda Terbaik) implement

Because the C-HAT Initiative’s 
KPIs have been changed since its 
implementation, the 3-year achievement 
trends cannot be compared. The KPI of 
the C-HAT Initiative in 2019 and 2020 is 
the Percent of Districts Implementing 
At Least 1 C-HAT Activity, with the 
target of 100 percent of districts 
implementing this activity. The KPI of 
the C-HAT Initiative in 2021 and 2022 
is the Percentage of PIBG JU C-HAT 
Implementing Nutrition and Health

EXPANSION OF EXCISE DUTY IMPOSITION ON SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES
Overweight and obesity had become a major public health concern. In year 2019, NHMS 
conducted by the MOH indicates that half of Malaysian adults (50.1 per cent) were overweight 
(30.4 per cent) and obese (19.7 per cent). The prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults 
was increased over the years from 21 per cent in year 1996 to 43.5 per cent in year 2006, 45.5 
per cent in year 2011 and 47.7 per cent in year 2015. In the same study, 29.8 per cent of children 
aged five (5) to 17 years were overweight (15.0 per cent) and obese (15.8 per cent). Prevalence 
of overweight and obesity in both adults and children were rising at alarming rate. 
The excise tax on Sugar Sweetened Beverages (SSB) tax has been enforced in 1 July 2019. In 
Malaysia, RM0.40 excise tax was subjected to every liter of sugar sweetened beverage includes 
carbonated and non-carbonated drink with sugar content >5g/100ml, flavored UHT milk-based 
drinks with sugar content >7g/100ml and fruit and vegetable juices with sugar content >12g/100ml.
The SSBs tax encourages the beverage companies to carry out more research and development 
on their products in order to meet the sugar threshold level. Manufacturers still can produce the 
same products but with better nutritional value or small portion size. To date, 344 ready to drink

MOH 2022
products had been reformulated to less sugar products to avoid from paying the tax. Therefore, 
healthier or less sugar products are more available at the market and perhaps, sugar consumption 
among the consumers is declined.

account to determine the direction of public health such as:
i.	
Re-strengthening the public health function through setting directions in the Health White 
Paper being developed by the Planning Division;
ii.	 Ensuring effective health spending through potential services outsourcing;
iii.	 Early detection and intervention of individual and family health and dental status;
iv.	 Empowering intervention and person centreed care oriented treatment for the whole life course 
(from womb to tomb);
v.	 Effective coordination and cooperation between the private and public sectors, especially in 
handling epidemic; and
vi.	 Expanding the use of digital technology.
A framework for the success of the healthy living culture has been developed to monitor and 
evaluate the improvement of the culture of healthy lifestyle among Malaysians. In addition, to 
strengthen the governance strategy in the healthy lifestyle culture initiative in Malaysia, the National 
Health Literacy Policy (DLKK) will also be develop.

HOUSEMANSHIP TRAINING PROGRAMME UNIT 
Housemanship is a two (2) years training programme that encompasses six (6) different disciplines 
to produce safe and competent medical practitioners. Upon successful completion of the training, 
the House Officers (HO) are eligible to obtain full registration certificates and provide healthcare 
services. A total of  3,252 new HOs were appointed in 2022.
Accreditation of Housemanship Training Hospitals
In January 2022, the Housemanship Training Programme Unit conducted a visit to Lahad 
Datu Hospital to be accredited as a new Housemanship Training Hospital (HLS). The hospital 
management was given an in-depth briefing on the implementation of the Housemanship 
Programme at the hospital level. With the accreditation of Hospital Lahad Datu, there are now 51 
hospitals in Malaysia that are designated as HLS.
Audit of Housemanship Training Programme Implementation
Every year, a few hospitals are selected for audit sessions to make sure the Housemanship 
Training Programme is carried out in accordance with the set guidelines and policies. In 2022, 
Tuanku Ampuan Najihah Hospital and Ampang Hospital were selected for this purpose. The 
Housemanship Programme Unit also held engagement sessions with HOs during the audit 
sessions at both hospitals to get feedback on their training.
Housemanship Assessment Module
During housemanship training, HOs are required to complete a logbook during each posting 
to ensure optimal competency levels. Since 2021, the logbook was adapted for the COVID-19 
pandemic situation. Therefore, in 2022, the Housemanship Training Programme Unit held several 
engagement sessions with stakeholders to develop a new and comprehensive housemanship 
assessment module. In May 2022, a workshop was held with Heads of Services (HOS) and 
specialists to finalize the format and content of the new housemanship assessment module. 
Subsequently, the module was approved by the Medical Qualifying Committee (MQC). The 
module will also be developed in the CPRC Hospital System in line with the PSP KKM 2021-2025.
In addition, the Housemanship Training Programme Unit also carried out a pilot project for the 
implementation of an e-logbook with representatives from HOs, medical officers, and specialists 
from Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah (HTAR). The project aimed to test the effectiveness and 
ease of use of the e-logbook integrated into the CPRC Hospital System.
Housemanship Programme Organisation at Hospital Level
The Housemanship Training Programme Unit is proactive in improving programme implementation. 
Based on previous audits and feedback received, there is a need to revisit the mechanism of 
managing the Housemanship Training Programme at the hospital level in a more systematic 
manner. Several engagement sessions have been conducted to restructure and strengthen the 
role of the Housemanship Training Programme organization at the hospital level. In June 2022, 
a workshop was held with deputy hospital directors and hospital management representatives 
to finalize this goal.

COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF MALAYSIA AND THE 
REPUBLIC OF INDIA IN THE FIELD OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE
Since the signing of the MoU between the Government Malaysia and the Republic of India on 
Cooperation in the Field of Traditional Systems of Medicine on 27 October 2010, the MOH received 
enormous support and cooperation from the Government of the Republic of India to strengthen 
the field of Traditional Indian Medicine (TIM) in Malaysia. The MoU has lapsed since October 
2020 and is expected to be renewed in 2023.
Among the long-term collaborations between both governments are the provision of TIM 
services (Shirodhara, External Basti Therapy and Varmam Therapy) at the MOH hospitals by 
TIM practitioners and assistant practitioners deputed under the Indian Technical and Economic 
Cooperation (ITEC) programme since 2011. On top of providing TIM consultation and treatment, 
the TIM practitioners also shared their knowledge and experiences at various conferences, 
seminars and courses. They also served as subject matter experts in the development of guidelines 
on education and training as well as practice in TIM. 
Following the end of the deputation period of the TIM practitioners, the Varmam therapy at Hospital 
Sungai Buloh, the Shirodhara and External Basti Therapy at Hospital Rehabilitasi Cheras and 
Hospital Port Dickson have been put on hold since July and October 2021 respectively. The MOH 
is in the process of renewing the MoU and matters related to the ITEC program with the Ministry 
of Ayush and the Indian High Commission to Malaysia so that applications for the deputation of 
new TIM practitioners and assistant practitioners can proceed in the near future.
The Government of the Republic of India offers the AYUSH Scholarship Scheme for interested 
students to further their studies in the field of TIM at universities in India. This scheme has benefited 
16 Malaysian students as of 2022.  
The 7th Bilateral Technical Meeting (BTM) on Cooperation in the Field of Traditional Systems of 
Medicine Between the Government of the Republic of India and Malaysia was held on 9 December 
2022 in Goa, India. The annual BTM meeting is hosted alternately by India and Malaysia. Among 
the items discussed in the 7th BTM were existing collaborations and proposals for new areas of 
collaboration in the practice, education and training, research, planning for MoU renewal and 
many others. Both counterparts have agreed to collaborate in activities such as organising 
workshops relating to the development of a Pharmacopoeia Commission for TIM and Homeopathy, 
approaches of TIM in disease management and prevention as well as technology transfer on the 
development of the herbal industry. The Indian counterpart has also agreed to be a source of 
reference for matters regarding TIM research.

PILOT PROJECT ON THE PROVISION OF T&CM SERVICES 
 A public-private partnership pilot project on the provision of T&CM services by Malaysia Holistic 
and Herbal Organisation (MHHO), a non-governmental organization was developed by the MOH 
at the KK Jinjang as one of the initiatives to integrate T&CM services into primary health care 
level. This project was implemented with the aim of developing, implementing and evaluating the 
public-private partnership model developed.
The MoA for this pilot project was signed on 28 November 2020 where the implementation period 
of the project was set for two (2) years from 1 January 2020  to 31 December 2022. However, due 
to the COVID-19 situation which caused a delay in the project implementation, the subsequent 
data collection and analysis process has also been affected. A policy decision was made to extend 
the MoA period for one (1) year to ensure that this project can run smoothly, so that sufficient data 
collection can be done before it is presented to the higher management of MOH.
Below are activities organised under this collaboration:
Workshop on Implementation of the Pilot Project between MHHO and KK Jinjang in the Provision 
of T&CM Services (Second Series) was held on 4 July 2022. Participation in the workshop is one 
(1) of the requirements MHHO practitioners and volunteers must meet before being allowed to 
provide services in the pilot project. The objective of the workshop was to train MHHO members 
on the work procedures in the implementation of this pilot project, specifically in the delivery of 
T&CM services according to the guidelines and SOP that have been set. The workshop was 
attended by 57 MHHO members and nine (9) MOH officers.
Appreciation Ceremony and Presentation of Certificates to MHHO Members was held  on 20 
October 2022. The ceremony was attended by representatives from BPTK, PKD Kepong and KK 
Jinjang. The objective of the ceremony was to present certificates of appreciation to the members 
of MHHO who were involved in this pilot project.

GOVERNANCE, MONITORING AND EVALUATION COMMITTEE (GMEC)
NHF Section as GMEC Secretariat has successfully produced an 
Executive Report entitled Laporan Eksekutif Pencapaian Prestasi 
ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn. Bhd. & ProtectHealth Malaysia 2019-
2021. The report aims to present an analysis of the performance of 
PHCorp and ProtectHealth Malaysia (PHM) as well as suggestions for 
improvement to Minister of Health. The scope of this inaugural report 
includes the performance of three (3) programmes implemented 
by the PHCorp which are PeKa B40, Electronic Service Provider 
for SPIKPA (ESP-SPIKPA) and PICK from year 2019 to 2021. This 
Executive Report will be produced yearly to ensure that PHM dan 
PHCorp are managed prudently, effectively achieve their social 
objectives and are sustainable in the long term.
COVID-19 CARE PACKAGE (PPC) 
On 19 September 2021, the former Prime Minister had announced 
that the government will be distributing PPC, which is expected to 
benefit 3.53 million Keluarga Malaysia B40 (household category 
recipients of Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat). These efforts among others, 
were aimed at easing the financial burden of B40 households and 
helping them cultivate the new norms, at the same time helping to 
protect their families from COVID-19.
Each PPC pack contained four (4) reusable face masks, four 
(4) COVID-19 self-test kits, one (1) pulse oximeter and one (1) 
thermometer, as well as leaflets containing health information and 
user guides. The PPC distribution had been carried out by Pos 
Malaysia starting from 30 November 2021. NHF as the secretariat 
of the PPC project together with representatives from other sections 
in the Planning Division, monitored the end-to-end PPC distribution 
process throughout the project period which includes supplying, 
packaging and delivery of PPC. In addition, we also conducted 
quality control measures such as the Supplier Corrective Action 
Report (SCAR) and Complaint Management. Data received from 
Pos Malaysia and delivery status reports by state are prepared 
periodically to ensure the project runs smoothly.

MNHA HEALTH EXPENDITURE 2011 - 2021
The 2022 MNHA Steering Committee Meeting was chaired by Director-General of Health and 
the latest time-series report from 2011-2021 was presented for approval. The findings of this 
report showed that in 2021, Malaysia’s Total Expenditure on Health (TEH) was estimated at 
RM78,220 million or 5.1 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This was an increase of 17 
per cent compared to RM67,022 million spent in 2020. In year 2021, per capita expenditure of 
health calculated using constant value of TEH based on population compared to 2020, showed 
an increase of 10 per cent from RM2,186 to RM2,401. The notable boost in total expenditure on 
health and the increase in TEH was a reflection of high priority given to COVID-19 related health 
expenditure, especially in view launching the nationwide National COVID-19 Immunisation 
Programme.

THE ONLINE HEALTHCARE SERVICES REGULATORY LAB (OHS REGLAB)
Online Healthcare Service (OHS) refers to new healthcare service models provided to a client or 
patient by healthcare professionals intermediated by a specialised digital platform. To date, there 
are no standards or regulations to ensure that the business entities providing OHS adhere to the 
five (5) guiding principles of healthcare services, namely safety, quality of care, accountability, 
traceability and confidentiality. 
The Planning Division and BAP is currently working with Futurise Sdn. Bhd., an agency under the 
MOF, in the OHS RegLab. The OHS RegLab is a controlled environment where participating OHS 
platform providers, refer to companies providing digital platforms in OHS, operate under specific 
conditions and guidance from the MOH and relevant regulators. The objective of the OHS RegLab 
is to study various OHS models in order to co-create appropriate regulatory and non-regulatory 
instruments through discussions with stakeholders, particularly companies and regulators. 
Stakeholder engagement sessions were held in February and August 2022.  A total of 33 OHS 
platform providers were selected to participate in the first and second cohorts of the OHS RegLab. 
The OHS RegLab Guideline is to guide OHS platform providers during their participation in the 
RegLab. This guideline is a dynamic document that is being improved through feedback from 
various stakeholders. The final version of the OHS Guideline is expected to be ready by the end 
of 2023.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY ON MORTALITY AND SELECTED MORBIDITY RATES 
PRE AND POST COVID-19 VACCINATION IN MALAYSIA
Excess mortality is widely accepted as the gold 
standard to determine the true burden of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. IKU carried out the estimation 
of excess mortality in Malaysia, from March 2020 to 
June 2022. Time series forecasting models were used 
to determine the expected deaths and were compared 
with the number of actual deaths that occurred 
during the time frame. The findings of the study were 
presented to the Minister of Health, leading to public 
dissemination of the findings via a press release. The 
findings of the study were also endorsed by the WHO 
and presented at the International Association of 
Official Statistics (IAOS) Conference in Poland in April 
2022. The study reported that during the first two (2) 
years of the COVID-19 pandemic, Malaysia recorded 
low excess mortality with a P-score of 2.8 per cent. 
Excess mortality was observed particularly among 
males of Malay ethnicity with aged 40 and above.

THE 2022 UPDATE FOR POST-VACCINATION COVID-19 IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 
SURVEILLANCE IN MALAYSIA (IMSURE) STUDY
IMSURE study started in June 2021 to primarily monitor 
the immune response over time following COVID-19 
vaccination among more than 2,600 vaccine recipients 
from the general population in Malaysia. It serves as 
an evaluation of the COVID-19 National Immunisation 
Programme and aims to provide evidence for booster 
policy. The study found that the immune response to 
the first vaccination waned after three (3) months and 
this waning was more prominent in some people. A 
further waning of the immune response was observed 
at six (6) months but a booster dose substantially 
increased antibody levels even exceeding previous 
peaks among heterologous vaccine recipients. 
The follow-up study was concluded at the end of 
November 2022, when almost all participants still 
had detectable COVID-19 antibodies due to either a 
booster dose or prior infection. IMSURE highlights the 
importance of evidence in health policy making and 
demonstrates the extent of MOH’s concerted effort to 
ensure success of the largest immunisation campaign 
in Malaysia.

MALAYSIAN FOOD COMPOSITION DATABASE (FCD) PROGRAMME
IMR began developing the Malaysian FCD in 1980. The Malaysian Food Composition Table was 
published in 1988 and revised in 1997.   Malaysia is a member of the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations network of food data systems (ASEANFOODS) which has good collaboration with 
the International Network of Food Data System (INFOODS). The Malaysian FCD was updated 
with additional nutrients due to the importance of nutrients in the aetiology and prevention of 
diseases. Sugar content in foods were needed for reformulation for food products and nutritional 
advice. The updated Malaysian FCD provides better quality nutrient data especially for health 
professionals, scientists, food preparation and food industries. A total of 26 agencies including 
MOH, universities, Department of Chemistry Malaysia, Malaysian Agricultural Research and 
Development Institute (MARDI), Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) and Department of Fisheries 
are involved in this work. The current updated version of Malaysian FCD contains 29 mandatory 
and 11 optional nutrients that are important to human health. It also includes the addition of 441 
raw and processed foods and 668 prepared foods.

BIOBANKING INITIATIVE FOR IMPACTFUL BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH
Impactful biomedical research is crucial for the advancement of healthcare in Malaysia. This 
requires a large number of high-quality biospecimens and associated data. MOH hospitals and 
facilities are valuable resources for the procurement of diverse biospecimens for biomedical 
and translational research. In year 2022, the MOH Biobank located at IMR started a national 
level biobanking initiative to organise, manage and oversee the collection of biospecimens from 
consenting patients/donors at MOH hospitals and facilities. 
The primary focus of collection in year 2022 was non-communicable diseases, such as cancers 
of national interest (colorectal and breast cancers). The initiative involved hospital surgical teams, 
pathology services, CRC network and the MOH Biobank. Preceded by meetings, seminars, and 
hands-on training sessions, the biobanking initiative began at HKL followed by Hospital Sultanah 
Bahiyah, Kedah. This initiative will be expanded to other hospitals in the Northern Region of 
Peninsular Malaysia in year 2023.

GENOMIC MEDICINE TO EXPLORE PERSONALISED TREATMENT IN INDIVIDUALS 
WITH RARE DISEASE OR CANCER
Genomic medicine holds immense potential in 
significantly improving healthcare outcomes 
for individuals diagnosed with rare diseases 
or cancers. The Primary Immunodeficiency 
Unit at IMR is actively utilizing whole exome 
sequencing (WES) techniques to identify 
specific gene mutations in pediatric patients 
with unidentified Primary Immunodeficiency 
Diseases (PID). This innovative approach not 
only enables early and accurate diagnoses 
but also allows for genotype-based risk 
stratification and personalized treatment 
options. 
In year 2022, IMR initiated a project that aimed 
to produce and validate the efficiency of clinical 
grade CD19 CAR-T cells for ALL treatments. 
IMR obtained an automated cell-processing 
platform that offers advanced integrated 
solutions to streamline cell processing 
workflows from cell separation and culture to 
formulation of the final product.  This makes it 
possible to generate gene-modified T cells in 
a standardised and automated process. IMR 
envisages expanding the production of CAR-T 
cells to explore effective therapies for various 
malignancies and other diseases in Malaysia.

DRUGS FOR NEGLECTED DISEASES INITIATIVE (DNDi) DENGUE ALLIANCE
Malaysia is currently participating in the 
Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative 
(DNDi) Dengue Alliance with Thailand, India 
and Brazil. The project aims to repurpose 
compounds/drugs that are already in use 
by conducting relevant preclinical studies, 
which could lead to future clinical trials. This 
follows a similar model which was used in 
the development of Ravidasvir, a Hepatitis 
C medication, via another South-South 
Cooperation. The collaboration increases 
the capacity of sharing knowledge, skills and 
techniques, enabling countries to pool results 
for better understanding of dengue therapy.
The current preclinical research in 
dengue focuses on antiviral activities. This 
encompasses in vitro studies, in vivo studies, pharmacokinetic studies and pharmacokinetic-
pharmacodynamic modelling. IMR is establishing its own data on the local dengue viruses 
(DEN1-4) and also contributing to available data. In vitro efficacy studies are conducted by the 
Virology Unit and the Bioassay Unit at IMR.

NATIONAL ORAL HEALTH POLICY (NOHP) AND NATIONAL ORAL HEALTH 
STRATEGIC PLAN 2022 – 2030
NOHP is the first ever national policy produced by the OHP MOH in collaboration with the dental 
fraternity and key stakeholders. This document acts as a reference towards a better oral health 
outcome and quality of life for all Malaysians. This policy was approved by the Cabinet on 18 May 
2022 and implemented via the National Oral Health Strategic Plan 2022-2030. The monitoring of 
the strategic plan achievements will be undertaken annually with all stakeholders to improve and 
strengthen the implementation in order to achieve the goals by 2030.
NATIONAL HEALTH AND MORBIDITY SURVEY 2020: NATIONAL ORAL 
HEALTH SURVEY FOR ADULTS 2020 (NHMS 2020: NOHSA 2020)
NHMS 2020: NOHSA 2020 is the fourth national oral health survey of adults aged 15 and above 
which is conducted periodically every 10 years. For the first time, this survey was conducted 
under the NHMS cluster in collaboration with the IKU and was supposed to be conducted in 
2020. However, its implementation was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey has 
been successfully implemented with a response rate of 82.5 per cent in 2022. There was a total 
of 16,173 respondents who were successfully examined and interviewed by 65 state research 
teams trained specifically for this survey. The results of this survey will be used as baseline data 
in the National Oral Health Strategic Plan 2022-2030.

WORLD CAVITY-FREE FUTURE DAY 2022
Symposium Sugar and Early Childhood Caries was held in conjunction with the celebration of 
World Cavity-free Future Day 2022 at the International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuantan, 
Pahang on 31 October 2022. This programme, with the theme Let’s Get Brushing! was hosted by 
the Alliance for a Cavity Free Future Malaysia Chapter. This global organisation aims for a cavity-
free generation in 2026 in Malaysia. 
Kuantan Declaration 2022 on Sugar and Dental Caries-Cavities was announced in conjunction 
with the celebration of World Cavity-free Future Day 2022 which urges the need for urgent action 
by the Malaysian Government, non-governmental organisations and private sectors to come 
together in protecting and promoting the health of all Malaysians.
IMPLEMENTATION OF PROOF OF CONCEPT (POC) IN FABRICATING 
DENTURES USING 3D TECHNOLOGY 
Timely delivery of dentures particularly to the 
elderly is a challenge in busy dental clinics 
as the process requires between five (5) to 
seven (7) visits. As a standard procedure, 
all dental technologists in 531 government 
dental laboratories employ the conventional 
method to fabricate dentures. In year 2022, the 
OHP MOH introduced an initiative to fabricate 
dentures using 3D printing technology for 
patients who have lost their natural teeth. This 
initiative was implemented as POC for three 
(3) months in two (2) dental clinics, namely 
Bandar Botanik Dental Clinic, Klang, Selangor 
and Kuala Lumpur Dental Clinic, FT of Kuala 
Lumpur from 15 August to 15 November 2022.

Annual Report 
 
MOH 2022
This POC approach was done in collaboration with two (2) private companies providing 3D 
technology equipment and free training throughout the POC period. Through this initiative, a total 
of 150 patients have received dentures faster with an average period of less than two (2) weeks 
compared to the existing period which is eight (8) to 10 weeks. Meanwhile for simpler cases, 
patients could have the dentures fitted within one (1) week. The frequency of visits could also be 
shortened from five (5) visits to only two (2) visits.
EXPANDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD 
(EMR) SYSTEM
Teleprimary Care - Oral Health Care Information System (TPC-OHCIS) is a clinical information 
system used at 31 dental clinics in Negeri Sembilan. In year 2022, procurement process for 
the Deployment, Configuration and Testing of TPC-OHCIS project at 23 dental clinics with the 
necessary IT infrastructure in Johor, Selangor and FT of Kuala Lumpur was initiated with installation 
expected in year 2023. As part of the project preparation, a Change Management and User 
Awareness Workshop was conducted in June 2022. 
COMMUNITY SERVICE IN SCHOOL DENTAL CLINIC (PPKPS)
The concept of PPKPS was introduced in 
schools with School Dental Clinics (SDC) 
where the delivery of dental services is not only 
limited to school children but is also extended 
to the local community, parents, teachers, 
supporting staff and their family members. The 
rationale for the PPKPS initiative is to optimise 
the use of dental facilities in SDC, expand the 
role of dental staff in SDC and promote the oral 
health services to the local community.
In July 2022, the PPKPS pilot project was 
carried out in 30 schools involving seven (7) 
states. Approval was granted by the MOE 
for the PPKPS pilot project until April 2023. 
Following this, 30 SDCs were selected based 
on several criteria, namely complete dental 
equipment and assets, water supply and 
electrical power source that complies with 
the standards, adequate human resources 
as well as the approval and permission from 
the school authorities. The scope of services 
delivered through PPKPS includes promotion 
and prevention of dental diseases, basic dental 
treatment and referrals for specific cases for 
further management. 27 additional SDCs were 
identified on 20 December 2022, bringing the 
total number of 57 PPKPS in 2023.

A total of 23 raids involving illegal practices within unregistered premises were successfully 
conducted. Various methods are used to publicise and disseminate information related to illegal 
dental practice activities that need to be eradicated, especially in making the public aware of 
the dangers of this activity. Collaboration has been done with the printed media such as national 
newspapers (Harian Metro, The Star and Sinar Harian) and electronic media such as coverage 
by the 999 TV Programme for several series of raids as well as interviews on the Malaysia Hari Ini 
(MHI) TV Programme on TV3 and on several radio stations.
The highlight for 2022 was the beginning of a strategic collaboration with the e-commerce 
company, Shopee Malaysia being one of the main platforms for selling products online. As the 
result of the discussion held on 13 December 2022, Shopee Malaysia agreed to work hand in hand 
with OHP MOH in curbing the illegal dental practices by restricting the sale of dental equipment 
on their platform and to support efforts to enhance awareness regarding professional dental 
services to the people.

COCHRANE SEMINAR ON ORAL HEALTH
OHP MOH collaborated with Cochrane Malaysia in organising Cochrane Oral Health Seminar 
for dental officers in public and private sectors on the 3 and 10 August 2022. The seminar aimed 
to provide exposure on Cochrane Library and systematic reviews, empowering knowledge of 
Cochrane systematic reviews of clinical cases and improving delivery of dental health services 
to citizens in both public and private sectors. 
The online seminar was conducted over two (2) sessions with 206 participants during the first 
session on 3 August 2022 and 104 participants during the second session on 10 August 2022. 
These seminars were beneficial for all dental officers in understanding the use of Cochrane 
systematic reviews in daily clinical cases thus, helping each category of participants to empower 
appropriate systematic review searches on the Cochrane Library website.
GLOBALISATION AND LIBERALISATION OF ORAL HEALTH SERVICES
The ASEAN Joint Coordinating Committee on Dental Practitioner (AJCCD) meeting was held 
online on 9 February 2022 and 28 October 2022. The meetings were held twice a year to discuss 
matters related to facilitating cooperation in Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) on Dental 
Practitioners. In addition, officers from the Oral Health Accreditation and Globalisation Section 
also attended a workshop on foreign equity participation in private healthcare facilities from 8 to 
9 June 2022 in Putrajaya. Among the issues discussed were the proposed improvement of the 
Foreign Equity Participation Policy from the policy agreed in 2015. This section was also involved 
in providing feedback for dental services in bilateral or multilateral negotiations between Malaysia 
and countries such as Türkiye, United Kingdom and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). 
Input was also provided for the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA) 
negotiations.
ACCREDITATION OF POST-GRADUATE DENTAL DEGREE PROGRAMME

PERIODONTAL SCREENING FOR SECONDARY SCHOOL CHILDREN 
 
(15-17 YEARS OLD)
Periodontal disease is one of the most common oral diseases contributing to the global burden 
of chronic disease and are associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPDs) through tobacco use, particularly smoking. 
In year 2022, a feasibility study was conducted in four (4) secondary schools in Selangor on the 
implementation of periodontal screening as part of incremental dental care among 15 to 17 years 
old school children. The study was carried out from August to October 2022 involving eight (8) 
dental officers with 416 students being screened. 
The benefit of periodontal screening would far outweigh the cost of periodontal probe. As such, 
implementation of periodontal screening year 2023 will start in in stages, to enable enough 
time for states to purchase additional periodontal probes. With the introduction of periodontal 
screening among secondary schoolchildren, management and treatment are tailored to individual 
periodontal conditions. It is hoped that the prevalence of severe periodontitis among Malaysian 
will be reduced in NOHSA 2030.
PROPOSAL FOR LATERAL ENTRY OF DENTAL OFFICERS
Proposal paper for application of lateral entry requirement for the Dental Officer’s scheme in MOH 
was submitted to the Central Agencies for approval with the existing provision to be amended 
for the creation of grade UG41, UG43/44, UG47/48, UG51/52, UG53/54 and Specialist UG55/56. 
The creation of lateral entry requirement will:
i.	
Provide more space for MOH and PSC o identify and select the best talents from the market 
towards strengthening the delivery of the services in accordance to todays and future needs; 
ii.	 Enable permanent or contract appointments to be offered at a higher grade, taking into 
consideration relevant experience, academic qualifications and the rate for the job; and 
iii. To enable PSC to offer appointment that is parallel to the officer’s career pathway.
EXTENSION OF CONTRACT FOR DENTAL OFFICERS
Beginning year 2022, contract Dental Officers who have completed compulsory services have 
been offered extension of contract for a further two (2) years for continuity of services and 
preparation for specialist training. Officers who received training offers will be offered extension 
of contract for further four (4) years maximum to complete their training. This decision was agreed 
upon during the Ministries Council Meeting on 14 July 2021.

DISPENSING OF MEDICINES IN MOH HOSPITALS AND HEALTH CLINICS
Pharmacy Value Added Services (VAS) was aspired through the principle delighting the customer. 
The implementation was done by following the new norm in order to reduce congestion and 
patients’ number of visits to the outpatient pharmacy as well as to facilitate patient in obtaining 
their follow-up medication supply. The available VAS are Integrated Drug Delivery Service (SPUB), 
Appointment System, Medicine by Post (UMP), Drive-Through Pharmacy, Locker4U and the latest 
is the Supply of Repeated Medicines Through Third Party (UM3).
UM3 service is introduced in 2022 to deliver patient’s follow-up medication supply from healthcare 
facilities to desired location within the same day by the third party with minimal delivery charges 
paid by patients. This service includes more variation of medicinal products to be delivered such 
as cold chain medications and it was first implemented in Perlis and subsequently expanded to 
HKL.
In year 2022, there was an increment about 6.7 per cent following the COVID-19 pandemic in the 
number of outpatient prescriptions received in hospitals and KK as compared to the previous 
year. The number of prescriptions received at MOH facilities was 52 million, of which 33.3 million 
prescriptions were received in KK and 19.7 million prescriptions in hospitals, respectively. Number 
of inpatient prescriptions received at the hospital showed slight increase by 4.0 per cent from 
14.3 million in year 2021 to 14.9 million in year 2022.

IMPLEMENTATION OF PHARMACY INTEGRATED COMMUNITY CARE (PICC) 
PROGRAMME FOCUSING ON DIABETES
PICC is an initiative introduced by the Pharmaceutical Services Division, JKN Terengganu 
to optimise the treatment of diabetes patients in the community. From year 2020, it has been 
improved and expanded to the whole country to allow the people to benefit from this initiative. 
PICC includes medication management activities, healthy lifestyle practices and a balanced 
diet. PICC is implemented through the collaboration of healthcare professionals and Know Your 
Medicine Ambassadors.
The National Pharmacy Practice Conference 2022 highlighted the exemplary methods of 
implementing PICC. Notably, in the state of Kelantan, the implementation of PICC has been 
identified as a best practice based on the decrease in HbA1c readings observed in 84 per cent 
of participants after completing the PICC session. The PICC best practice was also presented 
in the Post-Cabinet Meeting on 29 July 2022 and Mesyuarat Khas Ketua Pengarah Kesihatan on 
23 August 2022.
The PICC programme has been selected as one of the indicators for KPI Dimensi Daya Saing 
Agensi 2023, which is the percentage of type 2 diabetes patients who achieve a reduction in 
HbA1c after completing the PICC session ≥ 65 per cent.
DETERMINATION OF COVID-19 VACCINE MAXIMUM PRICE 
The free vaccination of the COVID-19 vaccine began in Malaysia in February 2021, followed 
by the sale of the COVID-19 vaccine in the private sector in May 2021, as a public option and a 
government’s effort to boost vaccination rates. The government has implemented the Maximum 
Pricing of the COVID-19 Vaccine to control the price of the vaccine as a result of the high demand 
during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as to increase accessibility and to promote vaccine price 
sharing through price transparency as an informed choice to the people.  
The Medicines Pricing Panel consisting of government agencies including the Ministry of Domestic 
Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), consumer associations and insurance associations 
have been established to carry out the function of assessing and proposing the price control for 
the COVID-19 vaccine.
The maximum price for the two (2) COVID-19 vaccine, namely CoronaVac and COVILO, were 
gazetted, effective 15 January 2022 through the Price Control and Antiprofiteering (Maximum 
Price Determination) Order 2022 under the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011 [Act 
723]. Thereafter, the Amendment of Maximum Price for COVILO came to effect on 20 May 2022.
MOH Pharmacy Officers have been appointed as Deputy Price Controller and Assistant Price 
Controllers to obtain information and carry out price control enforcement specific for the COVID-19 
vaccine effective 15 January 2022.

COVID-19 VACCINE SAFETY MONITORING
Close monitoring of the COVID-19 vaccines continued into year 2022 to ensure that the benefits 
of these vaccines persist to outweigh the risks. Communicating accurate safety information was 
crucial to allay safety concerns from the public and to ensure successful roll-out of the vaccination 
programme to this group of recipients. Pharmacovigilance activities conducted by the NPRA in 
year 2022 to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and to disseminate the relevant safety 
information are outlined as follows: 


269
Annual Report 
 
MOH 2022
Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) Reports Collection and Monitoring
In year 2022, the NPRA continued to monitor the safety of all registered vaccines used in Malaysia, 
including COVID-19 vaccines, mainly through passive surveillance of AEFI reported locally. 
Monitoring of AEFI reports also included the PICK for five (5) to 11 years old children (PICKids) 
to monitor the adverse effects experienced by children who received the COVID-19 vaccine.
AEFI reports collected are spontaneous reports received from healthcare professionals, 
pharmaceutical companies and vaccine recipients via the existing Reporting System in NPRA 
(PhIS-QUEST3+). Additionally, vaccine recipients may also self-report or notify common and 
minor adverse events in the MySejahtera. This information enables NPRA to monitor the trends of 
documented adverse events among vaccine recipients and to identify any safety issues during 
vaccine administration.
There are five (5) COVID-19 vaccines currently used for the PICK, which are Comirnaty (Pfizer), 
CoronaVac (Sinovac), Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca), Convidecia (CanSino) and Covilo (Sinopharm). 
The summary of AEFI reports received since the inception of PICK on 24 February 2021 up to 31

Annual Report 
MOH 2022
Safety Signal Detection and Risk Management
AEFI reports recorded in the databases are constantly reviewed to identify unexpected adverse 
events or potential safety signals for further evaluation, including Adverse Events of Special 
Interest (AESI) for COVID-19 vaccines. In addition to that, NPRA with the cooperation of Product 
Registration Holders (PRH) continuously monitor and identify any emerging safety issues locally 
and globally. PRH are required to provide monthly safety summary reports and Periodic Benefit 
Risk Evaluation Reports (PBRERs) every six (6) months. This reporting is crucial to ensure that the 
balance of benefits and risks of the COVID-19 vaccines used in Malaysia remains positive and 
that NPRA is promptly informed of any new risks pertaining to COVID-19 vaccines. 
The systematic and comprehensive approach in detecting safety issues pertaining to COVID-19 
vaccines ensures that appropriate and timely administrative or regulatory actions can be taken 
to mitigate the new risks identified.
COVID-19 Vaccine Special Pharmacovigilance Committee (JFK)
As part of the pharmacovigilance preparedness for PICK, the JFK was established in early year 
2021 under the National Immunisation Policy and Practice Committee. JFK members include 
health experts from various disciplines from both public and private health sectors. 
Dissemination of Information on COVID-19 Vaccines
The NPRA played a significant role in relaying timely and accurate facts concerning COVID-19 
vaccines selected for use in PICK to provide assurance on their safety, quality and efficacy. 
Communication of various regulatory and safety information pertaining to COVID-19 vaccines to 
the general public, healthcare professionals and the industry also continued in year 2022 to ensure 
the smooth roll-out of PICK. Efforts include the set-up of COVID-19 vaccine-specific information 
page on the NPRA website, which links the visitors to the relevant frequently ask questions (FAQ), 
circular and directives, press statements, safety alerts, bulletins and infographics on COVID-19 
vaccines.  
NPRA had published summary reports and press statements on the AEFIs of COVID-19 vaccines. 
The intention is to inform the public on the latest safety data on COVID-19 vaccines as well as the 
efforts undertaken by NPRA in vaccine safety monitoring. The summary reports presented the 
analysis of AEFI data collected by NPRA and the processes involved in COVID-19 vaccine AEFI 
reports and safety monitoring. 
In year 2022, NPRA had successfully organised two (2) training workshops for healthcare 
professionals virtually on how to improve COVID-19 vaccine-specific AEFI reporting, case 
investigation and risk communication. Additionally, to combat infodemics, NPRA participates 
in talks and seminars to provide accurate information on COVID-19 vaccines to healthcare 
professionals. NPRA officers also participated in numerous public engagement and educational 
activities through a variety of media channels including interviews on television, radio, live on 
social media and webinars.

COVID-19 VACCINE QUALITY MONITORING
MANAGEMENT OF QUALITY REPORTING OF COVID-19 VACCINES 
Besides pharmacovigilance activity, NPRA continuously monitor the quality of registered vaccines 
in the market through the management of quality reporting of registered COVID-19 vaccines 
in Malaysia.  Vaccines with a quality defect, including suspected defect are assessed and 
investigated by relevant parties to ensure there are no safety concerns arising from the defective 
products. It is important for such cases to be notified to NPRA in a timely manner for requisite 
actions to be carried out effectively. 
Since the inception of the PICK on 24 February 2021 to date, NPRA has received 2,497 quality 
defect reports of registered COVID-19 vaccines. Quality defects may be defined as attributes of 
a product or component which may affect the quality, safety and/or efficacy of the product which 
were not in line with the approved specifications or regulatory requirements. Based on investigation 
and assessment, 201 (9.1 per cent) of the cases reported were concluded as minor quality defect 
that has no impact on the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. Although no regulatory or market 
action taken for the defective products, manufacturers were required to take appropriate actions to 
prevent recurrence of the defect. On the other hand, 2,296 (92.0 per cent) of the reports received 
were associated with handling and unsubstantiated issues.

NPRA INVOLVEMENT IN THE NATIONAL VACCINE DEVELOPMENT 
ROADMAP (NVDR)
Malaysia launched the NVDR on 1 November 2021 to guide the country in achieving its vision 
for self-sufficiency and security in vaccine manufacturing and research & development (R&D) 
within 10 years. The aim is to ensure the country’s readiness for future pandemics and to reduce 
dependency on vaccine producing countries.
The governance structure of the roadmap consists of the Malaysian Vaccine Sectoral Working 
Group (MVSWG) which is led by the MOSTI with MOH, overseeing technical aspects of the 
strategies such as clinical infrastructure and taking the role of the regulator. 


272
Annual Report 
MOH 2022
While there are many different departments within the MOH who are actively involved in the NVDR, 
the NPRA plays an important role within the framework by providing regulatory approval for vaccine 
development, manufacturing and logistics. Below are some of the subcommittees established 
and activities conducted under the MVSWG which the NPRA officers has participated in:
i.	
Malaysian Vaccine Sectoral Working Group (MVSWG)
	
While the working group meeting is jointly chaired by the Secretary-General of MOSTI and 
MOH, the Director of NPRA is also a member in this working group which monitors the 
implementation of strategies and initiatives outlined in the NVDR.
ii.	 Vaccine Collaborative Network (VCN)
	
This subcommittee is led by the IMR. The VCN helps the MVSWG in identifying the research 
direction and become the platform for manufacturers and researchers to collaborate in vaccine 
R&D. Four (4) officers from NPRA with varying expertise in Clinical trials, Good Manufacturing 
Practice (GMP) and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) inspections as well as registration of 
vaccine products were appointed as members to this subcommittee.
iii.	 Expert Council Consortia (ECC): National Vaccine Research and Development
	
The Malaysian Genome and Vaccine Institute (MGVI) which functions as the National Vaccine 
Research Centre has established the ECC which consists of experts from various fields to 
assist in the vaccine development. Several NPRA officers were appointed to the consortia to 
contribute to vaccine discovery, pre-clinical, clinical and process development.
NPRA’S ROLE IN STRENGTHENING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF MEDICINE 
SUPPLY DURING NATIONAL HEALTH CRISIS
In May 2022, Malaysia experienced shortages of fever, cold and cough medicines. The rise of 
COVID-19 and HFMD cases in early year 2022 contributed to the overwhelming demand for 
those medicines. The shortage of these medicines is also attributed to consumer preferences on 
a certain brand despite availability of other brands on the market. 
Other factors contributing to global pharmaceutical supply chain disruptions include delays in 
the supply of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API), excipients and packaging materials due 
to the war in Ukraine and lockdowns imposed in China.
PSP had undertaken early measures to mitigate the impact of medicines shortage which include 
sharing information on the list of medicines that have been disrupted and alternative product 
recommendations for those medicines to government and private hospitals, private medical 
practitioners as well as community pharmacies.
The immediate actions that have been taken to reduce the impact on the current situation as 
follows:
i.	
MOH had released the buffer stock of Paracetamol Tablets 500mg from Pharmaniaga Logistic 
Sdn Bhd for purchase by the private health facilities;
ii.	 Obtaining stock level status of products reported to experience supply issues or shortages 
by communicating with Product Registration Holders (PRH) involved; 
iii.	 Monitoring of existing medicines supply stock level and requesting all PRH to update their 
product stock levels regularly; and


273
Annual Report 
 
MOH 2022
iv.	 Allowing the importation of fever, cough and cold medicines via the Special Approval 
Medicines mechanism.
The PSP has also begun planning long term initiatives to ensure medicines security and self-
reliance especially in crisis situations as follows:
i.	
Encouraging local pharmaceutical companies to produce their own medicines including API 
through public-private partnership;
ii.	 Development of the QUEST5 Online Registration System as an upgrade from the current 
Registration System (QUEST3+) which would allow the PRH to update marketing status of 
products in real-time to enable monitoring by authorities on the availability of products in the 
market;
iii.	 Development of a Pharmaceutical Track & Trace System to improve the traceability of the 
drug supply chain as well as to monitor the availability of products in the market;
iv. 	 Strengthening ASEAN Regional Cooperation through the ASEAN Drug Security and Self-
Reliance Framework (ADSSR) which is a Malaysian-led project that aims to improve access 
to medicines. One of the strategies under the ADSSR framework is the method of bulk 
procurement of medicines for countries in the ASEAN region; and
v. A framework is being refined to establish strategic cooperation with the world’s leading API 
producing countries such as India and China to guarantee the supply of API for national use 
including during a crisis.
EMPOWERMENT OF LEGAL PROVISIONS AND ENFORCEMENT
POISONS (AMENDMENT) ACT 2022 [ACT A1666]
The Poisons (Amendment) Act 2022 was enacted to amend the Poisons Act 1952 [Act 366] to 
ensure that Act 366 remains relevant to current needs. This amendment to Act 366 involves 
amendment of 16 sections, amendment of one (1) Schedule and delete one (1) section as well 
as insertion of 12 new sections. Act A1666 was passed in the House of Representatives on 21 
July 2022 and in the Senate on 10 August 2022. The royal assent of the Seri Paduka Baginda 
Yang di-Pertuan Agong was obtained on 7 September 2022 and subsequently gazetted on 20 
September 2022. Act A1666 will come into operation on 1 January 2023 (except provisions relating 
to compounding of offences).
OPERATION PANGEA XV
BPF coordinated the operation in Malaysia that involved collaboration between MOH and other 
agencies including INTERPOL Malaysia, the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMC), 
the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), Pos Malaysia and 
CyberSecurity Malaysia. A total of 2,438 websites, including those on the Dark Web, were identified 
for selling pharmaceutical products that violated existing laws. Requests were made to MCMC and 
platform providers to block access of these links. The list of Dark Web links has been submitted 
to INTERPOL for further action. The operation revealed an increase in the illegal sale of controlled 
medicines such as psychotropic substances, painkillers, antibiotics and others. Additionally, 686 
medical devices like face masks, thermometers, pulse oximeters and sphygmomanometers were 
found to be sold online without approval from the Medical Devices Authority.

MEDIA AND PUBLIC RELATIONS
In the year 2022, MDA implemented a strengthened strategy to effectively communicate with 
stakeholders through multiple platforms, including awareness programmes, mainstream media, 
and social media.  MDA organised two (2) awareness programmes in Sabah and Sarawak to 
target the public for public awareness and understanding.
For the users of Act 737, such as medical practitioners, doctors, and nurses, MDA conducted six 
(6) programmes in Johor, Kedah, Sabah, Sarawak, and Kelantan. These programmes specifically 
addressed the needs and concerns of this professional group.
MDA recognised the importance of gathering feedback from the public. To facilitate this, two 
(2) mediums were available: the Sistem Pengurusan Aduan Awam (SISPAA) and the MDA 
Feedback Management System (MDAFEMES). In 2022, 58 feedback entries through SISPAA 
and 626 through MDAFEMES were received, enabling them to address concerns and improve 
their services.
Social media and MDA’s official website played crucial roles in providing up-to-date and accurate 
information to stakeholders. In 2022, MDA uploaded 294 posts on their social media platforms 
(Facebook and Instagram) and shared 27 videos on their YouTube channel, ensuring continuous 
engagement and dissemination of relevant information.

Annual Report 
MOH 2022
WAY FORWARD
The rapid development of high-tech and innovative medical devices has become one of the 
significant challenges for regulatory bodies including MDA. New technologies such as Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning in medical devices have improve Malaysia’s health system 
with better treatment option on offer. In line with the rapid development of technology, MDA as 
a regulatory body needs to be prepared in to regulate new technologies that will emerge from 
time to time.
Besides that, differences in regulatory requirements between Malaysia and other countries is one 
of the challenges faced to provide certification to medical devices internationally and contribute 
to trade barriers globally. These obstacles are expected as every country has its regulatory 
requirements.
To overcome these situations, extensive planning should be done to strengthen Malaysia’s medical 
device regulatory system to ensure future activities implemented are in line with MDA’s vision 
to become a regulatory body recognized worldwide. To achieve this vision, MDA has already 
identified its mission through our 2019 - 2023 Strategic Plan.

Annual Report 
MOH 2022
INTRODUCTION
Malaysia’s healthcare travel industry is well on its way to achieving post-pandemic recovery. Under 
the guidance of MOH, Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) became a strategic anchor in facilitating 
the industry’s recovery and swift transition into endemicity. Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council 
(MHTC) together with the industry players forged an enhanced collaboration to provide continuity 
of care for patients and implement proactive measures, setting the foundation for transitioning 
into the industry Rebuilding phase in year 2023, as outlined in the Malaysia Healthcare Travel 
Industry Blueprint 2021 – 2025.
Malaysia’s healthcare travel industry achieved over 100 per cent increase in Healthcare Traveller 
(HT) revenue in 2022 compared to the previous year, surpassing RM1.3 billion, reaching more than 
76 per cent of its pre-pandemic performance of RM1.7 billion in 2019. The industry successfully 
surpassed its target of RM1 billion set for the year, contributing over RM5 billion in economic 
impact, which accounts for air travel, accommodation, food and beverage, leisure activities, and 
more. The industry demonstrated an encouraging recovery rate, surpassing both the global and 
Asia-Pacific tourism recovery rates of 63 per cent and 23 per cent respectively.

Employing whole-of government and whole-of-society approach, the achievement is a result of 
the success in implementing industry-wide recovery efforts, that were centered around the three 
(3) key strategic pillars of the blueprint; healthcare travel ecosystem, Malaysia Healthcare brand 
and markets for further elevating the seamless end-to-end patient experience and propelling 
Malaysia’s position as a safe and trusted destination.

Staying true to Malaysia Healthcare’s commitment in providing seamless end-to-end healthcare 
travel journey, MHTC joined forces with various local, regional, and international partners to 
further strengthen the Malaysia Healthcare ecosystem by exploring new avenues in enabling 
more synergistic collaborations and the adoption of digital solutions. 
ENHANCE PATIENT EXPERIENCE AND SEAMLESS JOURNEY THROUGH

MHTC’s collaborative efforts with the Immigration Department of Malaysia have led to the 
reintroduction of the eVISA (Medical), an electronic visa for medical purposes that facilitates

PHASE 1 REALISATION PROJECT (P1RP) 2.0
Following the success of the P1RP in 2021, CRM continue to develop the early phase clinical 
research ecosystem in the country through its P1RP 2.0. The objective is to further cement the 
foundation laid and enhancing the current capabilities in conducting early phase clinical trials by 
investing in investigator and study team capability development, site development and attracting 
more early phase trials into the country. 
ACTIVITIES
One of the major highlights of 2022 is the CRM Trial Connect 2022 conference that was conducted 
in October and has gained many tractions from stakeholders and important key players in clinical 
research in Malaysia and other countries. The first-time event was a huge success in showcasing 
Malaysia’s capabilities and outstanding achievements in multinational clinical research and 
sponsored clinical trials. The 2-day event saw up to 400 delegates and provided an excellent 
platform for building networks and understanding the clinical research setting in Malaysia. 
Additionally, CRM participated and conducted numerous activities and events throughout year 
2022, with close collaborations with both local and global stakeholders. In efforts to maintain and 
form new business collaborations, CRM has executed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
with both Novartis and Syneos Health, to further establish Malaysian trial sites within the footprint 
of global trials conducted. In enhancing early phase capabilities, CRM established a partnership 
with Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PMCC), Canada. Collaboration with Japan-led institutions 
were also acknowledged through the inking of partnership with the National Centre for Global 
Health and Medicine (NCGM) and renewal of partnership with Remedy & Company Corporation. 
CRM has also conducted numerous trainings, dialogues and workshops to ensure CRM’s SCs 
continually receive the necessary training that will ensure quality delivery of clinical trials (Table 
21.2).
