 Conclusion
 Introduction
 Trade secret law is a puzzle. Courts and scholars have struggled for over
 century to figure out why we protect trade secrets. The puzzle is not i
 understanding what trade secret law covers; there seems to be widespre
 agreement on the basic contours of the law. Nor is the problem that peop
 object to the effects of the law. While scholars periodically disagree over t
 purposes of the law, and have for almost a century,1 they seem to agree t
 misappropriation of trade secrets is a bad thing that the law should puni
 Rather, the puzzle is a theoretical one: no one can seem to agree where tra
 secret law comes from or how to fit it into the broader framework of le
 doctrine. Courts, lawyers, scholars, and treatise writers argue over whet

 law.2 None of these different justifications has proven entirely persuasiv
 Worse, they have contributed to inconsistent treatment of the basic elements

 suggest that this theoretical incoherence indicates that there is no need for 
 secret law as a separate doctrine at all. He reasons that whatever purpos
 served by trade secret law can be served just as well by the common
 doctrines that underlie it, whichever those turn out to be.4
 In this Article, I suggest that trade secrets can be justified as a form, n
 traditional property, but of intellectual property (IP). The incentive justifi
 for encouraging new inventions is straightforward. Granting legal protectio
 those new inventions not only encourages their creation, but enables
 inventor to sell her idea. And while we have other laws that enco
 inventions, notably patent law, trade secrecy offers some significant advan
 for inventors over patent protection. It is cheaper and quicker to obtain, s
 doesn't require government approval, and it extends to protection of ty
 business and process information that likely would not be patentable.
 It seems odd, though, for the law to encourage secrets, or to encourage
 those inventions that are kept secret. I argue that, paradoxically, trade
 law actually encourages disclosure, not secrecy. Without legal protec
 companies in certain industries would invest too much in keeping secrets. 
 secret law develops as a substitute for the physical and contractual restrict
 those companies would otherwise impose in an effort to prevent compe
 from acquiring their information.
 The puzzle then becomes why the law would require secrecy as an eleme
 of the cause of action if its goal is to reduce secrecy. I argue that the s
 requirement serves a channeling function. Only the developers of some kin
 inventions have the option to overinvest in physical secrecy in the abse
 legal protection. For products that are inherently self-disclosing (the whee
 or the paper clip), trying to keep the idea secret is a lost cause. We don't n

 the result would be less, not more, diffusion of valuable informatio
 secrecy requirement therefore serves a gatekeeper function, ensuring that
 law encourages disclosure of information that would otherwise be kept sec

 My argument has a number of implications for trade secret policy. Firs
 the theory works only if we treat trade secrets as IP rights, requiring pro
 secrecy as an element of protection. If we give the protection to things th
 public, we defeat the purpose and give windfalls to people who may n

 I. Trade Secret Doctrine
 A. The History of Trade Secret Law
 Trade secret law is a relative latecomer to the IP pantheon. While patent
 and copyright law were well established in Europe by the founding of th
 Republic, and trademark law had common law roots in various trade doctrines,
 trade secret law in its modern form in Anglo-American jurisprudence is 
 common law creation of the nineteenth century. English and American courts
 first recognized a cause of action for damages for misappropriation of trad
 secrets in 1817 and 1837, respectively;6 injunctive relief against actual or
 threatened misappropriation came later still.7 These early decisions concerne
 issues that are still debated in trade secret cases today: the circumstances i
 which an employee may continue her business after departing her employer, th
 circumstances in which a competitor may copy another's publicly sold product,
 and whether courts will enforce a contract requiring that business information
 be kept confidential. While there were forms of trade secret protection on the
 Continent dating perhaps as far back as Roman times,8 modern trade secret law

 8. One scholar traces the earliest legal protection against "misappropriation of trade
 secrets" to the Roman Empire. See A. Arthur Schiller, Trade Secrets and the Roman Law
 TheActio Servi Corrupti, 30 COLUM. L. Rev. 837, 838-39 (1930). The Roman courts create
 a cause of action called actio servi corrupti - literally, an action for corrupting a slave
 According to Schiller, the actio servi corrupti was used to protect slave owners from third
 parties who would "corrupt" slaves (by bribery or intimidation) into disclosing their owners
 confidential business information. The law made such third parties liable to the slave owne
 for twice the damages he suffered as a result of the disclosure.
 While more recent scholarship has cast some doubt on the enforcement of trade secret
 protection in the Roman Empire, see Alan Watson, Trade Secrets and Roman Law: Th
 Myth Exploded, 1 1 Tul. EUR. & Civ. L.F. 19, 19 (1996), the concept that so-called busine
 or "trade secrets" were entitled to legal protection spread rapidly throughout the world. A
 early as the Renaissance, most European nation-states had laws that protected businesse
 (notably, the guild cartels) from those who used their secret processes and ideas withou
 permission. These early laws were translated during the Industrial Revolution into statutes
 that protected "industrial secrets." Many of these statutes are still in force today, albeit in
 modified form.
 The roots of trade secrecy in slavery law were further evident in the treatment of
 employees in the centuries before the Industrial Revolution. Both commerce and foreig
 policy included a strong dose of "mercantilism." Governments and private guilds attempted
 to keep "their" IP within their grasp, using a combination of rewards to inventors and rul
 that reduced employee mobility. These developments are tracked in Carlo M. Cipoll

 is primarily an Anglo-American doctrine. Indeed, even to
 not well established outside of common law countrie
 treaties that require most countries of the world to 
 protection.10
 The doctrine of trade secrets evolved out of a series of related common law
 torts: breach of confidence, breach of confidential relationship, common law
 misappropriation, unfair competition, unjust enrichment, and torts related to
 trespass or unauthorized access to a plaintiffs property. It also evolved out of a
 series of legal rules - contract and common law - governing the employment
 relationship. In the nineteenth century, courts periodically spoke of trade
 secrets as property rights, though it is not clear that they meant by that term
 what we mean today.11 By the early twentieth century, the paradigm had
 shifted, and misappropriation of trade secrets was treated as a tort based on the
 confidential relationship between the parties or the misbehavior of the
 defendant.12 The standards for trade secret law were collected in the
 Restatement of Torts in 1939,13 and that Restatement was strongly of the view
 that trade secrets were not property rights but torts based on bad-faith
 competitive conduct. By the 1980s, a view of trade secrets as based in some
 combination of contracts and property was on the ascendancy, both in the
 Supreme Court14 and in state legislatures, the overwhelming majority of which
 have adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) within the last twenty-
 five years.15

 provides some interesting thoughts on why Japan considered such a trade secret statute
 unnecessary for so long. He argues that cultural norms of assumed trust made it socially
 uncomfortable to insist on formal confidentiality agreements, and that long-term or lifetime
 employment eliminated many trade secret issues associated with employee mobility.

 defendant, who was considering buying the plaintiffs company.21 
 departing-employee cases take the same form, though in the modern world it
 rare for such employees not to have an employment contract. As with t
 competitive-intelligence cases, trade secret law takes a basic common la
 principle (there tort, here contract) and supplements it in certain cases in the
 interest of fairness.
 Misappropriation of trade secrets, then, does not simply require use o
 trade secret, but acquisition, use, or disclosure of a secret in a way that r
 afoul of the prohibitions of trade secret law. Further, some conduct wil
 protected even if it discloses a trade secret. For example, a defendant w
 acquires a trade secret by developing it on her own or by reverse engineering
 is free to do what she wants with the secret.
 Proof of trade secret misappropriation gives rise to a panoply of remedies
 whose origin is as diverse as the original sources of trade secret law. Dependin
 on the circumstances, trade secret owners can obtain criminal penalties
 remedy based in criminal law), an injunction (a remedy that sounds in proper
 law), damages measured by the greater of the owner's loss or the defenda
 gain (a remedy based in tort law), or a limited "head start" injunction2
 designed to put the parties back in the same situation they would have been i
 had the misappropriation not occurred (a remedy that sounds in 
 expectation-damages rule of contract law).
 II. Efforts to Understand Trade Secret Theory
 Legal protection for trade secrets has been premised primarily on two
 theories that are only partly complementary. The first is utilitarian. Under this
 view, protecting against the theft of proprietary information encourages
 investment in such information. This idea is sometimes associated with the
 view that trade secrets are a form of property. The second theory emphasizes
 deterrence of wrongful acts and is therefore sometimes described as a tort
 theory. Here the aim of trade secret law is to punish and prevent illicit behavior,
 and even to uphold reasonable standards of commercial behavior.23 Although
 under the tort theory trade secret protection is not explicitly about encouraging
 investments, it is plain that one consequence of deterring wrongful behavior
 21. 203 F.2d 369, 376 (7th Cir. 1953).
 22. A "head start" injunction precludes the defendant from working on a project for a
 limited period of time, to put it back in the position it would have occupied had
 misappropriation of the plaintiffs trade secrets not given it a head start on competition. See,
 e.g., Winston Research Corp. v. Minn. Mining & Mfg. Co., 350 F.2d 134, 142 (9th Cir.
 1965).

 Common Law 263, 308, 312 (1988) (arguing that cases involving legal secrets - including
 trade secret cases - are better explained in terms of principles all would be willing to agree
 to rather than in the efficiency terms of law and economics).

 A. Tort Law
 A primary explanation for trade secret law throughout the twentieth
 century is what might be described as a "duty-based" theory, or what Melvin
 Jager calls "[t]he maintenance of commercial morality."24 The Supreme Court
 adopted this view in E.I. du Pont de Nemours Powder Co. v. Masland, a
 famous early decision, albeit one that bore only a tangential relationship to
 trade secret law:
 The word "property" as applied to trademarks and trade secrets is an
 unanalyzed expression of certain secondary consequences of the primary fact
 that the law makes some rudimentary requirements of good faith. Whether the
 plaintiffs have any valuable secret or not the defendant knows the facts,
 whatever they are, through a special confidence that he accepted. The property
 may be denied, but the confidence cannot be. Therefore the starting point for
 the present matter is not property or due process of law, but that the defendant
 stood in confidential relations with the plaintiffs
 This tort-based view gained significant currency at t
 twentieth century, in part because of Masland but also
 conceptions of property.26 By 1939, the American Law Ins

 That vagueness in itself wouldn't necessarily be a problem; we have vague
 standards in other areas of law where needed to achieve efficient results. And
 some would argue that the case itself is sui generis. But the Christopher case
 begs a larger question: why is it bad to acquire information in this way? We
 don't always or even often punish efforts to obtain competitive intelligence
 through legal means. One reading Christopher's standard might reasonably
 wonder, for example, why reverse engineering a chemical, or learning a
 competitor's prices by walking through their store during business hours, or
 attempting to predict a competitor's business strategy based on their market
 behavior, aren't similarly cheap efforts to acquire knowledge that would be
 expensive to protect. And yet those activities are clearly legal.
 The courts applying the tort standard are effectively defining certain acts as
 "unfair competition" or "free riding." But there is a growing tendency in the
 courts to treat the term "unfair competition" as redundant, using the doctrine to
 punish aggressive competition in the name of protecting "fair" business
 practices. Without some reason to protect a secret, the tort theory of secrecy is
 likely to devolve into challenges to a variety of competitive information-
 gathering, with courts unable to resolve those challenges on any principled
 basis, instead making ad hoc judgments based on their perception of the
 defendant's intent.35 And that in turn leaves a zone of uncertainty around

 B. Contract Law
 Courts and commentators have periodically suggested that trade secret law
 is (or more commonly, should be) coextensive with contract.37 The problems
 with contract as a stand-alone explanation for trade secret law are two-fold.
 First, contract theory cannot explain an important subset of trade secret cases:
 those determining legal rights between strangers. This includes not only the
 improper-means cases, but also those in which a trade secret is acquired by
 accident or mistake,38 and those in which liability extends not merely to those
 in privity with the trade secret owner but also to those who deal with one who
 is in privity.39 At best, then, contractual relations could be only a partial
 explanation for trade secret law.40 Second, even in the subset of cases dealing
 with parties in a contractual relationship, contract theory cannot explain the
 various ways in which trade secret law departs from enforcing the bargain those
 courts have struck.41 Nor can a contract theory explain the strong remedies

 secret owner is entitled to control certain information even once it has left the
 owner's possession. Why? "Because I possess it" cannot be the answer. The
 answer instead must be instrumental. We grant rights over secret information
 for the same reason we grant rights in patent and copyright law - to encourage
 investment in the research and development that produces the information.5
 Treatment of trade secrets as property rights vested in the trade secret
 "owner" is consistent with a view of trade secret law as providing an additional
 incentive to innovate beyond those provided in patent law. Trade secrets protect
 types of information that are not eligible for patent protection.52 They also
 provide immediate protection, while it takes years to get a patent. The Supreme
 Court has offered some support for this incentive view in cases such as
 Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp.^ But protecting secrecy seems an odd way
 of encouraging innovation. As a result, a number of commentators have
 suggested that if trade secret law is an IP right, it is a misguided one.54
 relationship to punish some conduct vis-Ã -vis strangers, and overstates the relationship-
 independence of other IP rights. Copyright in particular requires copying, and therefore a
 "relationship" with the plaintiffs subject matter in just the same way trade secret law does.
 Cf. Risch, supra note 1, at 18-23 (discussing a distinction between "collateral property" and
 "substantive property" rights).
 Whether IP rights should be thought of as property rights is a matter of some dispute. It
 seems clear that IP rights differ in fundamental respects from land and other forms of
 tangible property. See, e.g., Lemley, supra note 47, at 1033-46. A number of scholars have
 argued that the concept of property is much broader than its tangible instantiations, and that
 it should include IP rights even though they are properly treated very differently than other
 forms of property. See, e.g., Michael A. Carrier, Cabining Intellectual Property Through a
 Property Paradigm, 54 Duke L.J. 1 (2004); Richard A. Epstein, Intellectual Property: Old
 Boundaries and New Frontiers, 76 Ind. L.J. 803, 804 (2001). But see Peter S. Menell, The
 Property Rights Movement's Embrace of Intellectual Property: True Love or Doomed
 Relationship?, 34 Ecology L.Q. 713 (2007); Stewart E. Sterk, Intellectualizing Property:
 The Tenuous Connections Between Land and Copyright, 83 Wash. U. L.Q. 417 (2005). For
 purposes of this Article, it does not matter whether IP is property. It is sufficient to say that
 when trade secret courts speak of property, they mean IP.
 51. Richard Epstein conceives of trade secrets as property, but minimizes the
 difference between real property and IP. Richard A. Epstein, The Constitutional Protection
 of Trade Secrets Under the Takings Clause, 71 U. Chi. L. Rev. 57, 58 (2004). My
 disagreements with the latter point are set out in detail elsewhere. See Lemley, supra note
 47, at 1033-46.

 incentive provided by trade secret law in areas patent does not reach, and that that incentive
 comes at too great a cost. Bone, supra note 4, at 266-70. As I explain in Part III, I believe
 Bone is mistaken about the choice set facing technology companies absent trade secret law,
 and accordingly about the relative costs of having and not having that law.

 E. Bone 's Challenge: Does Trade Secret Law Serve a Purpo
 Finally, Robert Bone has surveyed this doctrinal morass
 the game isn't worth the candle. Bone's argument is that none
 trade secret law work. He claims:
 Those who tout economic efficiency either ignore the broader legal context
 within which trade secret law operates or fail to take into account all the costs
 of a trade secret system. Those who argue from rights and fairness are unable
 to identify a right or a coherent conception of fairness that fits trade secret law.
 And those who point to conventional norms - so-called "generally accepted
 standards of commercial morality and reasonable conduct" - do so without
 citing empirical support for the conventions thev invoke and without
 explaining why trade secret remedies are needed to enforce these norms.
 He argues that most of the positive virtues of trade secret law can be found
 in other legal doctrines, notably contract and tort law.64 To the extent that trade
 secret law goes beyond those doctrines, as in the Christopher case, he argues
 that it is unjustified.65 The common law, says Bone, can do just fine - and
 accomplish most of the same ends - without a doctrine of trade secret law.

 November 2008] TRADE SECRETS AS IP RIGHTS 329
 Bone's criticism has particular bite for those who claim that trade s
 law doesn't really have a single theoretical basis, but a multitude of them: 
 it is part tort, part contract, part property, part commercial morality. Pe
 this is fair enough as a descriptive matter,68 but it begs Bone's questi
 trade secret law is simply a compilation of bits and pieces of other laws, w
 good is it to speak of trade secret law at all, and how can one justify the p
 that law that don 't track their common law sources?
 In Part III, I suggest that trade secrets are best conceived as IP rights, a
 that, as IP rights, they work - they serve the basic purposes of IP laws.
 III. Constructing an IP Theory of Trade Secrets
 Trade secrets are best understood not as applications or extensions of
 existing common law principles (warranted or unwarranted), but as IP rights. In
 this Part, I explain the two critical features trade secrets share with other IP
 rights - they promote inventive activity and they promote disclosure of those
 inventions. I then seek to explain the most significant anomaly - the
 requirement of secrecy.
 A. Incentives to Invent
 Trade secret law confers an exclusive right on the possessor of valuable
 information not generally known to or readily ascertainable by competitors.69
 Exclusivity is the hallmark of an IP right. Both patents and copyrights confer
 similar rights to prevent use by others on the developers of new and valuable
 information. In so doing, patents and copyrights are generally acknowledged to
 serve a utilitarian purpose - the grant of that legal control encourages the
 development of new and valuable information by offering the prospect of
 supracompetitive returns, returns possible only if the developer does not face
 competition by others who use the same idea. In this way, patents and

 wait perhaps four years for the Patent and Trademark Office to decide 
 to grant protection.80 That significant delay renders patents unavai

 then, that economic literature suggests that some firms, particularly st
 rely heavily on the incentive to invent provided by trade secret law. In 
 cases patents are simply not an adequate substitute.
 Trade secret law also reaches where contract alone cannot. Trade secret
 law precludes acquisition of information by strangers using improper means -
 77. But see Chiappetta, supra note 1, at 74 (referring to incentives to invent as "solely

 business methods, see State St. Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Fin. Group, Inc., 149 F.3d
 1368, 1375-77 (Fed. Cir. 1998), it does not reach information not embodied in some

 B. Incentives to Disclose
 Patent and copyright law do not exist solely to encourage invention,
 however. A second purpose - some argue the main one84 - is to ensure that the
 public receives the benefit of those inventions. Patent and copyright law
 address this goal in various ways. Patent law requires that an applicant describe
 her invention in sufficient detail that a person of ordinary skill in the field can
 make and use it,85 and requires that that information be published.86 As a
 result, the public is free to read the patent and use the invention once the patent
 expires twenty years after it is filed, and even before that time scientists can
 learn from the patent disclosure and use that information to improve on the
 invention or to design around it.87 Further, patent law discourages secrecy in a
 number of ways.88 It is not clear that patent law serves this disclosure function

 U.S. 17, 36 (1997), which contrasts "the intentional copyist making minor changes to lower

 inventor, at least until they start down the path to public disclosure. 35 U.S.C. Â§ 102(g);
 Paulik v. Rizkalla, 760 F.2d 1270 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (en banc). As a result, patent law
 discourages reliance on secrecy, to the point that a first inventor who maintains that
 invention as a trade secret may not only lose the right to claim patent protection, but may
 even be sued for patent infringement by a second inventor who did disclose the invention.

 intellectual property; you can't patent a new cereal. All you can hope for is to have the
 market to yourself for a few months to establish your brand before a competitor knocks off
 the product. So we're very careful not to show our hand."). To be fair, this example can cut
 both ways - apparently cereal companies don't trust trade secret law enough to disclose
 information. But it is consistent with the idea that companies will opt for excessive secrecy
 in the absence of what they consider adequate legal protection.
 102. The reverse can sometimes be true, however. If a single fence can protect a host
 of secrets that the owner would have to sue individually to protect in court, fencing might be
 cheaper than legal protection. But when secrets are released to third parties - as most of the
 good ones generally must be - that becomes less likely.

 that the possibility that companies will keep information secret anyway means that the
 marginal social cost of legal protection for withholding information from the public is
 "minimal"). As I discuss in the text, I think Risch is right, but does not take this point far
 enough. It's not just that the possibility of secrecy without protection reduces the net social
 cost of trade secret law; eliminating the secrecy that would occur without the law is an
 affirmative social benefit of having trade secret law.

 always true, of course; the inventors of Coca-Cola could have chosen to pat
 it but didn't. But importantly, weakening trade secrets means that those in

 together, the secrecy requirement and the relative weakness of the trade s
 law help ensure that the law protects those who would otherwise rel

 Put another way, the secrecy requirement channels particular inventors to
 form of IP protection that best achieves the goals of society.
 Trade secret law may or may not get this judgment right. The enforcem
 of trade secrets has costs as well as benefits, and as with all IP rights
 hard to know whether we are getting the balance right.127 Further, as I su
 below, not every trade secret case fits this framework neatly. But the the
 trade secrets as IP rights coheres, in the sense both that the fundam
 features of trade secret law fit quite nicely within the goals and framewor
 IP law more generally and that the same arguments and concerns that aris
 other areas of IP arise in trade secret law. Further, as I will argue, thi
 about trade secrets as IP rights can help us to improve the doctrine 
 Resolving those arguments, and striking that balance, is the subject of Par
 IV. Implications for Trade Secret Law
 How does this understanding of trade secret law translate into policy? As a
 preliminary matter, the articulation of a solid theoretical basis for trade secret
 law helps defuse Robert Bone's criticism of the doctrine. Trade secret laws
 promote the goals of IP rights more generally, and it is the doctrines specific to
 trade secret law rather than those borrowed from contract or tort that help it do
 so.

 Corp.: Notes on a Closing Circle, 1974 Sup. Ct. Rev. 81.
 126. See Bone, supra note 4, at 272-81 (detailing some of those costs). One cost often
 taxed to trade secrecy - the encouragement of wasteful duplication of inventive effort in
 races by competitors who don't know that the other is working on the same problem - I do
 not in fact think qualifies as a cost. First, it is far from clear that "races" to innovate are a bad
 thing; they can speed up the invention process, see John F. Duffy, Rethinking the Prospect
 Theory of Patents, 71 U. Cm. L. Rev. 439 (2004), and they often produce valuable new
 insights that a single approach would not, see Conigliaro et al., supra note 87. Second, as
 Friedman, Landes, and Posner observe, the prospect of stronger patent protection may
 encourage racing to a greater extent than legal rights in secrets, as companies spend money
 in rent seeking. Friedman et al., supra note 1, at 65.

 the flow of non-trade secret information.
 C. Other Implications for Trade Secret Doctrine
 Besides the centrality of secrecy to trade secret law, and
 to preempt torts that undermine that requirement, an IP 
 law may have other implications for trade secret d
 implications I discuss in this Subpart are more speculative; 
 necessary implications of the IP theory of trade secrets, b
 seem to fit uneasily with the IP theory or that are li
 sustenance from that theory.
 1 . Reasonable efforts to protect secrecy
 First, while proof that the plaintiffs information is sec
 role in channeling towards trade secret protection only th
 best served by trade secret law, the same is not necessarily
 requirement that trade secret owners take reasonable ef
 secrets.159 That requirement seems to stem from tradi
 contributory negligence, under which plaintiffs were barr
 themselves contributed to the tort.160 The explanation I h
 secret law (and for the secrecy requirement) is not one tha
 end in itself; far from it. The benefit of trade secret 
 investment in secrecy compared to what would happe
 there is no reason we should want to establish a minimum investment level as
 of Federal Preemption, 12 Marq. Intell. Prop. L. Rev. 299, 355-57 (2008). That shouldn't
 be necessary if the UTS A will do the job, except perhaps in states that still apply common
 law doctrines.
 159. On that requirement, see Unif. Trade Secrets Act Â§ l(4)(ii); Rockwell Graphic
 Sys., Inc. v. DEV Indus., Inc., 925 F.2d 174 (7th Cir. 1991); Electro-Craft Corp. v.
 Controlled Motion, Inc., 332 N.W.2d 890 (Minn. 1983).
 160. See, e.g., Elizabeth A. Rowe, Rethinking "Reasonable Efforts" To Protect Trade
 Secrets in a Digital World 38 (July 19, 2008) (unpublished manuscript), available at
 http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161166 (relying on a tort conception of trade secrecy to justify
 strengthening the reasonable efforts requirement in the online environment).

 an end in itself.161 And it may have negative consequences in pa
 circumstances.162
 The question then becomes whether reasonable efforts serve so
 end. For example, some courts suggest that efforts to protect informa
 secret are a sufficiently strong proxy for the secrecy of the invention
 should rely on them as evidence in support of the existence of a secret
 they are surely not perfect evidence; any litigator will tell you that co
 regularly label as secret lots of things that clearly are not secret. Even
 that reasonable efforts at secrecy do offer such evidence, that doesn't ju
 imposition of reasonable efforts as a separate requirement, 
 consideration of that evidence in the overall secrecy inquiry. Alternati
 may be that efforts to protect secrecy serve to put potential defe
 notice of the claim of secrecy, and therefore prevent inadv
 misappropriation. This may be true of some, but not all, efforts at sec
 again, it seems to justify reasonable efforts only as evidence, not as a 
 requirement. More to the point, it will be true only as to some de
 others may be aware of the secrecy of the information they take wheth
 those secrets were reasonably protected. It seems more logical to cabin 
 of liability for inadvertent misappropriation by imposing some kind o
 requirement than through this kind of constructive notice through en
 efforts.164
 Reasonable efforts to protect secrecy, then, may make sense as evidence of
 secrecy or even as evidence of scienter, but they probably don't make sense as
 a separate requirement. In this case it is the Restatements that have it right and
 the UTS A that has it wrong; both the Restatement of Torts and the Restatement
 161. See, e.g., Kitch, supra note 1, at 698. One author has argued that "[cÄ¼ourts should
 require firms to invest in precautionary measures until the marginal cost of those measures
 equals the marginal expected economic loss in the event of misappropriation." Note, Trade
 Secret Misappropriation: A Cost-Benefit Response to the Fourth Amendment Analogy, 106
 Harv. L. Rev. 461, 473 (1992). But that makes no sense. It would essentially require
 dissipation of all the rents that might be gained from protecting trade secrets. This leads to
 the conclusion that any expenditure on secrecy is wasteful unless it serves some identifiable
 social purpose.
 162. See, e.g., Harry Wingo, Dumpster Diving and the Ethical Blindspot of Trade
 Secret Law, 16 Yale L. & Pol' y Rev. 195 (1997) (arguing that "dumpster diving" for
 discarded secrets should be illegal regardless of the efforts to prevent it, albeit on a
 "commercial morality" theory).
 163. Rockwell Graphic Sys., Inc., 925 F.2d at 178.
 164. Trade secret law does have such a requirement, though it rarely becomes an issue,
 probably because the requirement of misappropriation by improper means limits the number
 of cases in which defendants act in good faith but still meet the test for infringement. See
 Rohm & Haas Co. v. Adco Chem. Co., 689 F.2d 424, 433 n.9 (3d Cir. 1982) (imposing a
 negligence requirement as to whether the information taken constituted a secret and
 concluding that "[a] good faith belief, even if credited, is no defense to an action for
 misappropriation of trade secrets"); Pooley, supra note 1, Â§ 6.04[l], 6-30 ("Knowledge on
 the part of the defendant is an element of liability for misappropriation.").

 Indeed, in the case of secrecy itself, they are fundamental to the point

 over time it is likely to be revealed to the world. But it is not clear
 indefinite term properly strikes the balance between providing inc
 invent and ensuring that the world benefits from the new invention. 
 that after a certain period of time the additional incentive from the p
 secrecy is marginal, while the costs of maintaining secrecy are not. Co
 for example, surely did not count on over a century of trade secret pr
 when it made the choice between patent and trade secret law. On
 implication of treating trade secrets as IP rights, then, is that the 
 provide that trade secrets "expire" after a certain period.181 Certai
 view of trade secret rights requires us to give thought to striking
 balance between encouraging innovation and unduly limiting disc
 question that - whatever its proper resolution - might not arise at all u
 different conception of trade secrecy. That doesn't mean we should
 term for trade secrets. It may be too hard to decide on a start date, and
 an end date, and compelling disclosure of information at the end of
 may also prove problematic. But thinking of trade secrets as IP rights 
 gives us a perspective from which to think about the question.
 Conclusion
 Trade secrets are IP rights. They serve the same purposes as patent an
 copyright law - they encourage innovation and the disclosure 
 dissemination of that innovation, though they sometimes serve those purpose
 in surprising ways. Trade secret law reduces investments in secrecy an
 encourages the dissemination of the secret to more people who can ma
 productive use of it. Indeed, trade secret rights may serve the purposes o
 law better than more traditional IP rights, at least for certain classes o
 inventions. The public disclosure function of the patent system doesn't w
 very well in most industries, and doesn't work at all if inventors opt out of 
 patent system.
 Understanding trade secrets as IP rights allows them to take their pro
 place in the pantheon of social policy designed to encourage innovation. It also
 gives us a way to think about how those rights are designed, a way that
 significant implications for how trade secret law looks and how it interacts w
 other laws. Most surprisingly, those implications are ones that offer greater,
 lesser, latitude for competitors and departing employees than the unfa
 competition rationale most commonly articulated as an alternative.
 181. Cf. Simpson, supra note 1, at 1 156-58 (arguing for a defense applicable to secre
 that cannot be reverse engineered, and so might last forever). This isn't a necess
 implication; trademarks are similarly protected for an indefinite term so long as they are us
 in commerce and renewed every ten years. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1059 (2000).
