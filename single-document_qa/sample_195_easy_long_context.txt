The architecture caused nostalgia to surface along with a sense of peace. None of this matters, Nameless said. It is but a reflection of a lie and holds no value to us. Lalquinrial didn\u2019t respond but acknowledged the truth of Nameless\u2019 words. The creature had reignited Lalquinrial\u2019s purpose and focused him like he\u2019d never experienced. The clarity of purpose had set him free. Exhaustion kept Lalquinrial on the throne, and Abaddon and Zadkiel stood guard, protecting him from any of the dangers that might emerge from the depths below this palace. Soon he hoped to regain his strength and handle Nameless and the Inquisitor by himself. Lalquinrial glanced at Abaddon and Zadkiel who stood on either side of the throne. He\u2019d known them back in the old days and had always wondered what had happened to them. Now he knew the Destruction Realm had cleansed the two angels, turning them into Knights of Destruction. The Inquisitor had tried to speed Lalquinrial\u2019s absorption of Destruction Essence as well, attempting to turn him into a mindless husk like the two Archangels. Nameless had risen to the threat, matching the attack with his own zealousness. That protection, along with Lalquinrial\u2019s own Soul Power, had proved too much for the Inquisitor. Miranda had imprisoned the Inquisitor for thousands of years in her Black Pyramid, so he couldn\u2019t blame the priest for wanting to convert Lalquinrial\u2019s flesh into darkness. Lalquinrial\u2019s victory only served to validate his existence. In this grand illusion, he had once again proven he held enough truth to survive and continue. Lalquinrial had reached a balance, now. His left arm and legs had turned into black destruction essence, while his torso and head remained unblemished. Nameless continually battled the advancing darkness, taking pressure off Lalquinrial and giving him time to build his mental strength. Eventually, he would become strong enough to regain control of his body. Three entities in one body, all fighting for supremacy over the others. Lalquinrial didn\u2019t bother speaking with either of the Archangels, as after all this time they\u2019d lost most of their identity. They\u2019d become creatures of desire and only wanted to consume. The Inquisitor had the same desire but retained logic and self-control. Even though the Darkness only infected three of Lalquinrial\u2019s limbs, he felt the hunger for destruction. It had given him a better understanding of the creatures he dealt with. Lalquinrial found it ironic that Nameless, the Inquisitor, and his own desires fought each other for control, even though they all had the same goal. Same goals but different paths, and Lalquinrial preferred the route that kept his identity whole. Afterall, what value would finding the truth hold if he hadn\u2019t retained his free will and intelligence. Things had never looked better. The Destruction Essence in Lalquinrial\u2019s body protected him against most forms of power, including Spirit, and his Divine brothers and sisters no longer posed a threat to him. The battle waging inside him had forced a vast increase in his mental strength. Every moment brought him closer to regaining full control of himself. The Inquisitor and its kind had benefited from this relationship as well. Their weakness in the Material Realm had made recovering from the sudden disappearance of Spirit impossible and uncountable Inquisitors remained stranded in the Darkness. Now that Lalquinrial understood their origin, purpose, and abilities he had devised a possible solution. The Destruction Essence invading Lalquinrial\u2019s body allowed him to communicate with the Inquisitor and if Lalquinrial understood correctly, a reservoir of power existed in the deepest part of the Destruction Realm, what he\u2019d always called the Shadow Realm. It contained the magic that the Inquisitors had stripped from the Universe before Pen had stopped their advance by hiding all the Spirit. Lalquinrial had convinced the Inquisitor he planned to help them utilize this reservoir of power to restart the Darkness. In truth he still contemplated the reservoir\u2019s revelation and wondered about alternate possibilities. Perhaps this reservoir would allow him to break free from this tidal pool immediately and permit him to swim in the true ocean of the Outerverse. Using the reservoir in such a fashion would allow Lalquinrial to reach his ultimate goal, escape, much faster, but the destructive needs of both Nameless and the Inquisitor rebelled at such ideas. The creatures both yearned to annihilate this universe. Nameless, because it represented a lie, and the Inquisitor, because destruction embodied its purpose. The third possibility was completing the Harbinger quest, which, depending on how long each quest step took, might be quicker. Distortion requires destruction, Nameless reminded Lalquinrial. All other paths are false. Only annihilation reveals the truth. \u201cI know,\u201d Lalquinrial whispered. The new quests had arrived a little too late for Lalquinrial anyway. While they unlocked routes to great power, that power interfered with his current form. Perhaps once he controlled both Nameless and the Destruction Essence in his body, he could turn his attention to finding a compatible quest path that harnessed all these new Outerverse abilities while allowing him to retain his Destruction Essence progress. Lalquinrial turned his thoughts to the recent battle with Starfield. Nameless had provided the means to deliver Lalquinrial a great victory, and the creature still rejoiced at the demise of its maker. Starfield had allowed his most critical vulnerability\u2014emotional ties\u2014to fatally trap him. Those relationships had anchored Starfield to that vaporizing planet, and his attempts to rescue his friends would have either delayed him sufficiently for the crossing ring explosion to engulf him, or if he did manage to escape, the guilt of leaving his friends behind would devastate him. Not long ago, Lalquinrial\u2019s response to Starfield\u2019s fall would have mirrored the joy Nameless felt. Now though, things felt less personal. He was Lightbringer, and he carried the truth. His battle encompassed so much more than a single boy. Despite Starfield\u2019s tenacity and obvious ability, he fought to preserve an illusion. He didn\u2019t want the dream to end. Starfield deserved pity, and a chance to embrace the truth. Lalquinrial, mindful of Starfield\u2019s weaknesses, possessed far fewer personal vulnerabilities and had already begun the process of detaching himself from them. Simandreial had criticized him for his bond with Nameless and the Destruction Essence, arguing he had forfeited too much of his identity. She never supported you, Nameless whispered. She did not see the truth. Lies, in all their forms, must be purged. \u201cI know,\u201d Lalquinrial responded. And yet you continue to clutch one\u2060\u2014 \u201cEnough!\u201d Lalquinrial screamed and his fingers dug into the soft gold of the throne\u2019s armrests. Nameless thrashed wildly in displeasure, and Lalquinrial closed his eyes, enduring the onslaught. It became a little easier each time. Despite the overpowering urges of Nameless and the Destruction Essence to sever all connections to this universe, Lalquinrial still protected his feelings for Echodriel, and he hoped that they could talk soon. For the time being, Lalquinrial needed to stay concealed and disconnected from the universe as he mastered control over his mind and body. Remaining here in the Material Realm posed risks, but the Shadow Realm amplified the Destruction within him, significantly challenging his ability to resist. Once the Inquisitor confirmed the best method to reach the power reservoir\u2019s bottom, Lalquinrial needed to decide on the path to grasping his destiny. A slow inevitable destruction as the Darkness once again crawled across the Universe, or a catastrophic, but not Universe ending, explosion to push Lalquinrial into the arms of the Outerverse. \n CHAPTER 1 Sift stood in the lower vault of the Black Pyramid, surrounded by sets of legendary armor each displayed to highlight their beauty and craftsmanship. Ignoring all of them, he studied the row of plain Cultivator robes, his face frozen in an uncharacteristic frown. He reached out to touch the closest one, a set the color of freshly plucked leaves. \u201cDon\u2019t touch it,\u201d Fluffy growled. \u201cI just got this place cleaned up from the last miscreant that sneaked in here.\u201d He gave Ruwen a long look. Ruwen raised his eyebrows but decided to hold his tongue. First, Blapy had brought him in here to get his Ink Lord armor, he hadn\u2019t sneaked in. And second, it was his scrubbing-Minions that had cleaned everything in here, including the fingerprints he\u2019d left on his first trip. Sift glanced at Ruwen as well. \u201cIs it your fault that Fluffy is so grouchy today?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not grouchy,\u201d Fluffy growled again. \u201cI just don\u2019t know why everyone has to touch everything.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Ruwen agreed giving Sift a serious look. \u201cWhy do you have to touch everything? Don\u2019t you know it\u2019s disrespectful?\u201d Fluffy glared at Ruwen. \u201cWhat?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cI\u2019m just agreeing with you. If anyone knows how hard it is to get all this stuff clean, it\u2019s me, right?\u201d Fluffy didn\u2019t seem amused, so Ruwen turned back to Sift, hoping to direct Fluffy away from Ruwen\u2019s previous misdeeds. \u201cWhy are you being so picky? What do you want?\u201d Sift studied the robes again, his face returning to the painful expression he\u2019d worn for the past fifteen minutes. \u201cMy robes had the color of a perfectly fried doughnut, light brown, an almost golden color that promised just the right amount of resistance when bitten. They were light and airy, like the frosting on a lovingly baked pastry. Just wearing those robes made me feel like an \u00e9clair.\u201d \u201cYou feel like an \u00e9clair?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cHave you lost your mind? Clothes are something you just wear.\u201d Sift didn\u2019t look at Ruwen, but he shook a finger in that direction. \u201cYou see, that\u2019s why you have so many problems.\u201d \u201cMy problems are because I don\u2019t care what I\u2019m wearing?\u201d \u201cYep,\u201d Sift replied. \u201cThe outside is a reflection of the inside. I have a whole list of clothing-related self-help pastries just floating around up here,\u201d he said as he rotated a finger next to his temple. \u201cDarkness take me,\u201d Ruwen replied. \u201cThe only thing your self-help pastries will accomplish is driving people to the priests for therapy.\u201d Sift turned his attention to Fluffy. \u201cWhat do Fluffy\u2019s clothes tell you?\u201d \u201cOh no, don\u2019t include me in your nonsense,\u201d Fluffy barked. \u201cI regretted bringing you in here ten seconds after I agreed to it, and now I feel like you\u2019re just punishing me. Blapy put you up to this, didn\u2019t she? I thought she\u2019d gotten all her anger out about the alchemy resource incident. Perhaps she doesn\u2019t believe I\u2019ve suffered enough.\u201d \u201cI really appreciate your help with my Alchemy leveling,\u201d Ruwen told Fluffy. \u201cIt made an enormous difference, and I know you suffered for helping me. I won\u2019t forget it.\u201d \u201cIf you mean that, by all that\u2019s holy, get this madman to pick a set of armor. How hard can it be?\u201d Sift narrowed his eyes as if studying Fluffy. \u201cThe vest says organization, the ordered pens, and metal thingies show a mind clean and detailed. Pants sturdy, displaying the man\u2019s dependable work ethic. Boots laced and tied perfectly, each in balance, indicating the importance of planning and a desire to not let sloppy mistakes interfere with his forward movement. I have known Fluffy my whole life, and I have never seen him in different attire. This signifies his commitment to stability, repetition, and efficiency.\u201d Ruwen and Fluffy stared at Sift with shocked expressions. Ruwen had to admit that Sift\u2019s analysis held a lot of merit, and the connections he\u2019d drawn between Fluffy\u2019s clothes, and his behavior were scarily accurate. Instead of saying any of that, he chose a different response. \u201cLylan and Hamma wrecked your mind with all their fashion talk.\u201d Sift narrowed his eyes in thought as he studied Ruwen. Ruwen held up his hands. \u201cI\u2019m not interested\u2060\u2014\u201d Sift pinched the black fabric of Ruwen\u2019s shirt, interrupting him. Ruwen slapped Sift\u2019s hand away. \u201cStop that.\u201d \u201cYou look like a level ten Shade.\u201d Ruwen glanced at his own clothes, which were a set that he\u2019d gotten from the Black Pyramid on his very first trip. It consisted of basic Shade attire, which meant all black, close-fitting, comfortable garments. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my clothes?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the glazed doughnut of the pastry world,\u201d Sift responded. \u201cI don\u2019t need to look fancy. All the important stuff is up here,\u201d Ruwen said, tapping his temple. \u201cYeah, right, it has nothing to do with how it shows off your abs.\u201d Ruwen suppressed the surge of blood to his cheeks. Sift grinned and nodded knowingly. A loud gong sounded behind Ruwen, and he flinched as a seven-year-old blonde girl with pigtails appeared. Blapy turned to Fluffy. \u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d Fluffy raised his hands in a helpless gesture and looked between Ruwen and Sift. Blapy sighed and rubbed her forehead. \u201cWe were looking at the robes,\u201d Fluffy started, \u201cand then somehow we got on the topic of pastries, and now they\u2019re arguing about psychological fashion.\u201d \u201cThat sounds about right,\u201d Blapy said. She turned to Sift. \u201cHurry up and pick one of these. The pyramid can\u2019t afford to have you tying up its Quartermaster like this.\u201d Sift frowned. \u201cNone of these feel right or look right. I\u2019m the Soaring Sage. I need to look regal and, I don\u2019t know, sageful. And all of you can wait patiently because Shelly and I are the only reason the lower vault still exists.\u201d Blapy pinched the bridge of her nose and whispered to herself. \u201cI should have let the whole place explode.\u201d With obvious effort, Blapy calmed herself and studied Sift. After thirty seconds, even Fluffy became a little uncomfortable. \u201cWhat?\u201d Sift finally asked. \u201cOh, I\u2019m just contemplating how I\u2019m about to make yet another huge mistake. Something I seem to accomplish with you two daily.\u201d \u201cHeadless Pete says mistakes are opportunities if you have a strong mind.\u201d Blapy turned to Ruwen. \u201cWho is Headless Pete?\u201d Sift opened his mouth, his eyes wide with excitement, and Ruwen raised a hand to stop him. \u201cTrust me, you don\u2019t want him to answer that question.\u201d Sift pushed Ruwen\u2019s hand down. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him. He\u2019s still mad because Headless Pete knew more about turtles.\u201d Blapy turned to Fluffy. \u201cHeadless Pete? Turtles? Does any of this make sense to you?\u201d Fluffy gazed between Ruwen and Sift shaking his head slightly. \u201cThe longest I\u2019ve ever followed one of their conversations is just under a minute. I thought this was going to be a quick trip to the lower vault, and instead, I have a headache debuff and we\u2019ve made zero progress.\u201d Blapy looked up at Ruwen and Sift, waving a finger between the two. \u201cBe honest with me. Is this an act? How are you capable of confusing everyone you meet within a minute of contact?\u201d Ruwen and Sift faced each other. \u201cYou are a little confusing,\u201d Ruwen told Sift. Sift touched his chest. \u201cI\u2019m confusing? How about when you styled your hair with bendy blood? That was like the very first day I met you.\u201d Ruwen pointed at Sift. \u201cThat was your fault. I was totally unprepared to fight Rod Spiders, and you just left me by myself.\u201d \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d bathe in your enemy\u2019s blood. Who does that?\u201d Ruwen touched his hair. It was still on the shorter side and a little spiky, but Hamma had helped him smooth out the roughest portions, and he didn\u2019t think it looked too bad now. \u201cThat\u2019s not confusing,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cIt only demonstrates how terrible a teacher you were right from the beginning.\u201d Sift opened his mouth to respond and Blapy screamed. \u201cStop!\u201d Blapy took a couple of deep breaths. \u201cI give up. I\u2019m done thinking. I\u2019m just going to do it. Darkness take the consequences.\u201d Blapy looked at Fluffy. \u201cSorry, Quartermaster. I\u2019ve already reached my limit. I\u2019ll find you later.\u201d Blapy disappeared, and a moment later, to Ruwen\u2019s shock, Miranda appeared. Ruwen still didn\u2019t understand how Miranda\u2019s three forms overlapped or interacted with each other. Blapy was almost always the form taken in the dungeon and Miranda\u2019s human form only appeared when things became serious. He\u2019d only seen what he believed to be Blapy\u2019s true form once, and that was during the Step Championship semifinal match with Stump and Chip, where she\u2019d taken the form of a massive black wyrm. Fluffy immediately bowed. \u201cWelcome, goddess. It\u2019s a pleasure to see you.\u201d \u201cThank you, Quartermaster. I relieve you of this torturous experience.\u201d \u201cMany thanks, goddess.\u201d And Fluffy immediately created a portal and disappeared. Sift spoke to Ruwen. \u201cYou just made up with Fluffy, and now you went and irritated him again.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t irritating him. You were, with your talk about pastries and fashion and hairstyles. I don\u2019t even remember why we\u2019re here anymore.\u201d Miranda cleared her throat before Sift could respond, and the pair turned to face the goddess. Sift bowed to Miranda, and Ruwen gave her a shallow bow as well. \u201cGreetings, goddess,\u201d Sift said. \u201cI apologize for my manners. My friend here has discombobulated me.\u201d Ruwen turned back to Sift. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you know what \u2018discombobulated\u2019 means.\u201d Sift leaned back, offended. Miranda pressed her palms together in front of her lips and groaned. Ruwen and Sift turned their attention back to the goddess. \u201cDo you want some robes or not?\u201d Miranda asked. \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Sift replied. \u201cI need new ones. Mine were destroyed by that dumb hydra.\u201d Miranda\u2019s wings partially unfolded, their black canvas filled with galaxies and stars. They disappeared quickly and Ruwen wondered if she was nervous. \u201cAgainst my better judgment but in recognition of saving this planet, I\u2019m going to give you a special set of Cultivator robes. You\u2019re forbidden to ask any questions about them. Absolutely none.\u201d \n CHAPTER 2 \u201cSo mysterious,\u201d Sift said to Miranda, his voice giving away his excitement. \u201cFirst, though,\u201d Miranda said, \u201cI want you to equip that tattoo you have in your dimensional belt.\u201d The dimensional belt was the only thing that Sift had salvaged after his clothes dissolved from the hydra acid. \u201cWhy now?\u201d Sift asked. \u201cBecause I have sympathy for Shelly,\u201d Miranda replied. \u201cSpeaking to such an empty-headed buffoon must exhaust her, and this might raise your intelligence enough to spare the Elder Tortoise pain.\u201d Sift glanced at Ruwen. \u201cBuffoon means fool,\u201d Ruwen said. Sift nodded and faced Miranda. \u201cA fool\u2019s tongue speaks to its own reflection.\u201d Ruwen leaned back, stunned at the quick response. Miranda didn\u2019t respond but took on a contemplative expression. \u201cThat one,\u201d Sift continued, \u201cis part of the Soaring Sage line of pastries, although I might be convinced to put it in the self-help section.\u201d Miranda slowly shook her head. \u201cScratch my scales. The pair of you travel so quickly from clowns to genius, it defies understanding. Now equip that tattoo.\u201d Sift slouched and slowly reached into his dimensional belt. Ruwen recalled the item\u2019s description. It had come from the loot they\u2019d taken from the obnoxious table next to them at Pour Judgement. Name: Beastmaster Ink Effect: Enables the wearer to communicate with and understand animals. Strengthens the bond with animal companions. Description: Tattoo\u2019s depiction changes based on the primary bonded companion. \u201cWhy are you acting like a baby?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cBecause I like things the way they are,\u201d Sift whispered. \u201cIf Shelly understands me better, she might not like me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a very real possibility,\u201d Ruwen said, and when Sift\u2019s head snapped up in alarm, Ruwen grinned and grabbed Sift\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. That turtle loves you and would do anything for you. She\u2019s already proven that many times. If anything, what if she has a bunch of recipes she\u2019s been unable to communicate. Like celery muffins, or cilantro cream filled carrot donuts.\u201d Sift widened his eyes. \u201cWhat if I start liking vegetables or weirder stuff like wanting to rub my body with lettuce. Shelly has a lot of strange behaviors.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what makes the two of you such a good match.\u201d Sift didn\u2019t look convinced and turned his attention to Miranda. \u201cMaybe I should wait for one of your tattoos? Yours are the best, right?\u201d \u201cUsually, but the Dungeon Core that created that tattoo formed when its bonded human died. And when it comes to bonds, theirs are better, as subtlety is not one of my strengths, and this type of working requires a light touch.\u201d \u201cWhat will it look like?\u201d \u201cThe ones I\u2019ve seen are masterfully done, as the bond can access some memories.\u201d \u201cI miss my snake tattoo.\u201d Ruwen frowned. \u201cIs that really who you are? A snake tattoo guy?\u201d Sift stared at the tattoo with a deep sigh. \u201cI guess not.\u201d He pulled up his shirt and placed the tattoo over his heart. The tattoo sank into Sift\u2019s skin, disappearing from sight. He watched to see what would appear, but nothing happened.\u201d Sift glanced up at Miranda. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen instantly,\u201d Miranda scolded. \u201cThese types of tattoos need to gain an understanding of the current bonds before materializing.\u201d \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get a shell,\u201d Ruwen said. Sift looked conflicted about that idea. Before Sift could respond, Miranda raised her hands to silence them. \u201cI\u2019ve already reached my limit with you two.\u201d She gave a piercing look at Sift and sighed deeply. \u201cThese are very special to me,\u201d her voice lowered, and she spoke softly. \u201cPlease take care of them.\u201d Miranda straightened her arms, and a long jacket appeared over her left arm, with pants draped over her right. Her right hand held a pair of thin shoes that reminded Ruwen of socks. The color shimmered between light grey and midnight blue. The long-sleeved jacket looked far too large for Sift. It had a white, flat, stiff collar that protected the back and sides of the neck. The pants and boots shared the same color. Sift gently took the items from Miranda. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful. I love them.\u201d Miranda\u2019s eyes glistened, and she gave a tiny nod. Sift handed the items to Ruwen and began undressing. Ruwen turned to apologize to Miranda for Sift\u2019s behavior, but the goddess had disappeared. The garments had generated notifications and Ruwen opened them curiously. Why had these clothes caused so much emotion in Miranda? Name: Void Jacket Set Bonus (3-Piece): Universal Resonance \u2013 attracted toward nearest Universe.

Ruwen turned his attention to Sift and raised his arms with the clothes. \u201cThese are the most powerful robes I\u2019ve ever seen, and they come from something called an Abyssal Lord.\u201d Sift threw his clothes into his dimensional belt and reached for the new robes. \u201cSeriously? Blapy gave me something good?\u201d \u201cMuch better than good. It looks like they absorb half of any damage you take, make you silent and undetectable, and give you some type of danger sense. And the set bonus is something about detecting other universes, which probably isn\u2019t going to do much for you right now but raises a million questions about where these robes came from that they would have such an ability.\u201d Sift studied the jacket, pants, and boots for a few moments before dressing. \u201cThese things are huge. Whoever they came from was a big dude. I wonder where Blapy got them?\u201d \u201cWell, if I had to guess, I\u2019d say from an Abyssal Lord.\u201d \u201cDo you know what that is?\u201d \u201cNo idea. I\u2019ll ask Rami about it at home.\u201d Sift slid the jacket over his head, and it looked like he\u2019d pulled on a tent, but as soon as it touched his skin, the garment adjusted until it fit him perfectly. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d Sift said. Five seconds later, the pants and slippers were also on, and it looked tailored for Sift specifically. He disappeared. Ruwen\u2019s eyes widened in shock. He could no longer see or detect Sift with any of his senses. \u201cSay something,\u201d Ruwen said. After a second of silence, he created a party and added Sift. Over Chat, Ruwen asked again. Are you talking? Yeah, you can\u2019t hear me? It\u2019s like you don\u2019t exist...wait, I hear a tiny bit of air movement. That\u2019s because I\u2019m waving my arms, Sift replied. Wow, these robes are powerful. You seriously can\u2019t see me? Wait a second, let me try something else. Ruwen triggered Harmonic Sight and immediately noticed the dark silhouette of Sift as a dead area free of vibrations. Ruwen engaged Harmony and Sift became far more visible. Sift punched at Ruwen\u2019s solar plexus and he slapped it away. I thought you said you couldn\u2019t see me, liar. I can\u2019t. Harmony can. You\u2019re not on my map either, and I can\u2019t hear your heartbeat or anything. That cloaking might be better than peak Divinity shielding. Hit me, Sift said. Ruwen immediately jabbed a spear at Sift\u2019s shoulder joint. And Sift reacted faster than normal, allowing him to block Ruwen\u2019s strike. How fast was that? Sift asked. Ruwen shrugged. Maybe forty percent. You reacted faster than normal though. It\u2019s that Void Whisper passive. I couldn\u2019t tell what was coming, but I could feel where it would land. Try seventy percent speed. Ruwen used Harmony to verify Sift\u2019s position and snapped a punch at Sift\u2019s chest. Once again, Sift reacted faster than normal, but the strike still hit him in the arm. Sift rubbed his arm and winced, even though the armor had absorbed half the force. Ruwen grimaced as the shockwave from his punch jostled all the nearby armor and caused a couple of sets to fall off their stands. Sift scanned the disturbed armor. You\u2019re in so much trouble. What? You\u2019re the one that told me to punch you. This is half your fault. I\u2019m invisible for another four and half minutes. Have fun explaining to Fluffy how you wrecked his displays. A portal opened, and Ruwen guessed it was Fluffy coming to see what had disturbed his lower vault. Ruwen quickly cast Root on Sift, locking his feet in place so he couldn\u2019t get away. Ruwen wondered if Fluffy would find the hidden Sift and Ruwen considered covering Sift in oil or dirt from his Void Band, but decided the extra mess would only make Fluffy angrier. Plus, that stealth buff would only last five minutes, which meant Sift needed to find a place to hide quickly. Ruwen touched the shelf and summoned a portal to his room next to the upper library, entering it as Fluffy emerged from his own portal. The quartermaster would disable portals out of the vault as soon as he arrived and Ruwen hoped he\u2019d acted quickly enough to escape. With a sigh of relief, Ruwen glanced around his room. In a basket just inside the door sat the three copies of the Affinity manual that they\u2019d gotten from the rift quest. Ruwen placed them in his Inventory to study later. Right now, if Sift got caught, he\u2019d try and incriminate Ruwen. A wise man knew when to make an exit, which is exactly what he did. \n CHAPTER 3 It only took a few breaths for Ruwen to realize the Dungeon Master\u2019s lair would be one of the first places Sift looked for Ruwen to get revenge, so he needed to quickly decide his next destination. Fractal remained in his crystal cocoon contemplating the God Stone. The Dungeon Keeper had entered that state after Ruwen had revealed a new System quest that indicated souls were used for backups in the Outerverse. Hamma and Lylan were still with Ky in the Black Pyramid on some sort of pyramid business. Rami was with Xavier, which left Ruwen by himself. That meant now was a good time to explore an idea he\u2019d contemplated for a while. Hey, Lir, do you know where Talker is? I noticed him a while back at Pour Judgment, but I haven\u2019t seen him since. Consulting the Shattered Sun schedule, I can verify that he is not currently working. Let me check New Slegbotl\u2014I found him at the Savage Seven Society. Savage Seven? As in the chickens that almost killed me? The very same. Ruwen sighed. And what is the Savage Seven Society? It is one of several franchises created by the Savage Seven. The Savage Seven Society is a themed tavern with an eclectic assortment of alcohol and a surprisingly diverse menu. Well, good for them, I guess. Rami told me you are responsible for it. Responsible for what? Their tavern? Yes. Rami said the tokens you gave them after besting them in the exploding egg level acted as seed money for their franchises. You\u2019ve got to be kidding. Not only did I make them famous, but now I\u2019m making them rich? It appears that way. Ruwen sighed. Can you portal me there? A portal appeared, and Ruwen stepped through, exiting into a well-lit structure that, at first glance, reminded Ruwen of a massive barn. A large gift shop stood to his left, and Ruwen\u2019s jaw dropped. All thoughts of Talker disappeared as he strode toward the store. Ruwen\u2019s likeness was everywhere, and none of it displayed him in a flattering light. A variety of T-shirts covered one wall, and the armholes varied from none to twelve. They all bore the logo of the Savage Seven Society, which depicted seven chickens standing on the prone form of a man. Not just any man, but Ruwen. Posters of the seven chickens fighting Ruwen hung on the walls, and he always appeared to be unbalanced or on the verge of falling, while the Savage Seven wielded weapons in poses reminiscent of Step stances. A small kiosk contained temporary tattoos and stickers with sayings like \u201cI survived the Savage Seven eggs-plosion\u201d and \u201cExpect the un-eggs-pected.\u201d Ruwen picked up a large, brightly colored book. An autobiography titled \u201cA Feather\u2019s Breath from Victory: The Day the Savage Seven Conquered God.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not how I remember it,\u201d Ruwen mumbled. A set of coffee mugs read, \u201cStart the Day with a Bang.\u201d The rest of the cup was covered with the Savage Seven, their butts in the air, as if ready to fire an egg. Coasters and pictures displayed various portions of the fight, always when Ruwen was at his worst, of course. Ruwen shook his head and left the gift shop before the store clerk, a three-foot-tall peacock-lizard, could reach him. He had little interest in discussing the merchandise. The hostess, a twelve-foot slug, gazed down at Ruwen as he approached. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d Ruwen gave a friendly wave and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a Mist Wraith called Talker.\u201d \u201cDoes this concern Ink Lord business?\u201d From the way the question was asked, Ruwen got the impression that his best chance at success here would come if he was part of the Black Pyramid power structure. \u201cKind-of,\u201d Ruwen replied. Mucus dripped from the slug\u2019s face as it nodded toward the long bar. \u201cIf he\u2019s still here, he\u2019s at the bar.\u201d Ruwen gave a polite nod. \u201cThank you,\u201d and carefully walked around the large slug. As Ruwen strode to the bar, he took in the structure. The inside reminded him of a barn, with high windows to let in light. At Pour Judgment, most of the tables were made for humanoids and an adjoining area contained a large space to better suit the Black Pyramid citizens. The Savage Seven Society was the opposite. The sides stretched six hundred feet and the ceiling started at least one hundred feet above Ruwen. Large open pits covered one section of the floor while another contained dozens of tall stakes that rose fifty feet in the air. Tables ranged from the size of his thumb to thirty-foot-tall. Far above another bar hung from the ceiling like a stalactite. The bar to Ruwen\u2019s right started at an inch high and climbed along the wall to fifty feet. Twenty percent of the tables had occupants, all of whom watched Ruwen as he strode toward the familiar figure of Talker standing at the bar. The misty figure hunched against the bar, a vaguely human form about seven-foot tall. Shadowy smoke swirled around Talker\u2019s form and two yellow eyes turned to regard Ruwen, their narrow slits glowing with interest. Ruwen had first met Talker on level six of the Black Pyramid. It had been a difficult fight at the time, as Talker had assumed the form of a level fifteen elite for the level. Ruwen would have never given the Mist Wraith another thought, except for Sivart. Sivart had emerged as a Narrator from Talker\u2019s manifesto and Ruwen respected Sivart greatly, valuing the man\u2019s strategic and tactical thinking. Ruwen sat on the empty stool next to Talker. The seat felt a little too wide, and his feet dangled\u2014definitely not made for a human. Talker turned and regarded Ruwen. \u201cGreetings, Ink Lord. How fares the war?\u201d \u201cHi, Talker. I\u2019m glad I caught you. I was hoping we could talk about the wars, actually.\u201d Talker nodded at the menu on the stone surface of the bar. \u201cAre you buying lunch?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Ruwen responded, picking up the stiff leather. Hey You automatically translated and Ruwen scanned the options. This side contained drinks, and he found the bar\u2019s theme continued here. Feathered Fury Barnyard Blitz Ruwen\u2019s Regret Ruwen shook his head and flipped the menu over to view the food options. The first appetizer was something called Savage Seven Layer Dip. Ruwen groaned and moved to the main dishes, but they only got worse. Scrambled Shade Beak of Destiny Henhouse Hash Ruwen put the menu down, and Talker did as well. The bartender approached, and Ruwen did his best not to stare at the half-vulture, half-scorpion creature. Talker held up a crystal goblet filled with swirling red gas. A pellet at the bottom slowly sublimated, producing vapor. \u201cI\u2019ll have another wobbling Worker and to eat I\u2019ll take a Savage victory with extra gallant gravy.\u201d The black, dead eyes of the vulture-scorpion turned to Ruwen. \u201cI\u2019ll take an Ink Lord\u2019s wrap, easy on the Savage sauce, and a harvest cider to drink.\u201d The scorpion\u2019s tail descended, and Ruwen leaned back. The needle-sharp end pointed at a picture of four different cup sizes, and Ruwen studied the fourth and largest option. The collector\u2019s mug depicted a scarecrow exhaustedly hanging from its wooden support, with seven chickens proudly roosting on his arms and head. Along the bottom, it read, \u201cI come to protect the harvest.\u201d Ruwen had responded to Phoenix with that phrase during their fight in the Spirit realm. \u201cThose stupid chickens are stealing my lines,\u201d Ruwen grumbled. Talker sighed, and it sounded similar to a hiss. \u201cWho would have guessed those hens had stellar marketing sense? It has made me reconsider my approach to world domination. I learned a lot from those chickens. Specifically, how to latch onto an opportunity and relentlessly drive it forward toward a goal.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s kind of why I wanted to talk to you,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little complicated, but let\u2019s just say that I became familiar with your manifesto and found that it contained a shocking amount of useful information.\u201d \u201cWell, that comes as a surprise, and certainly not how I imagined our conversation beginning.\u201d \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d Talker inhaled red vapor from his goblet although Ruwen couldn\u2019t see the Mist Wraith\u2019s mouth. \u201cI thought you\u2019d come to collect my library fines. Or maybe to rough me up about the annotations.\u201d Ruwen laughed. \u201cListen, that spider you put in charge of the libraries is connected. A very dangerous arachnid.\u201d Ruwen opened his Black Pyramid Library interface and navigated to the open fines and quickly found Talker\u2019s transgressions. Talker\u2019s annotations comment now made sense. \u201cYou added your own thoughts to multiple books,\u201d Ruwen summarized. \u201cDefacing library property they say.\u201d \u201cDefacing,\u201d Talker repeated with disgust. \u201cHow do these authors even get published? Rubbish books lacking a proper narrative and full of terrible advice. Black Pyramid Press, the pyramid\u2019s own publishing house, printed some of them. Shameful. I could do better myself.\u201d Everyone thought they could write a better story, but Ruwen kept that to himself. Afterall, Talker had written a powerful manifesto. Not only that, if Ruwen remembered correctly, Black Pyramid Press published anyone from the Pyramid who submitted. Which certainly invited a lot of questionable books. \u201cI\u2019m sorry the quality isn\u2019t up to your standards, and I know from experience your standards are very high, but you need to stop writing your thoughts in other people\u2019s books. I\u2019ll clear all these fines and restore your borrowing privileges if you agree.\u201d Talker slouched forward and nodded. \u201cI agree.\u201d \u201cWhy so glum?\u201d Talker inhaled more of the red mist. \u201cBetween you fixing the libraries and schools, and the Chapel Priestess removing the revival queues and improving the hospitals, morale has never been higher. It makes battling for control of the Black Pyramid difficult.\u201d \u201cI might have a solution for you. I can\u2019t offer world domination, but I can offer a little conquest.\u201d Talker turned and his yellow eyes locked on Ruwen\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ll get right to the point,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cI mostly killed two gods. They ruled the countries to the north and east of us, and their residents are without a deity or revival options.\u201d \u201cMostly killed?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, but they\u2019re gone for good. My plan is to send Uru\u2019s three Champions to negotiate the surrender of their Temples and begin the process of integrating them into Uru\u2019s lands. These Champions are brilliant, but I\u2019d feel better if someone with the wisdom gained from long research and contemplation about empire building was also present to make sure nothing is overlooked, and no mistakes are made. I want that person to be you.\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t you worried that having a \u2018monster\u2019 on your team might disrupt your negotiations? Or ruin them completely.\u201d \u201cI know the difference between monsters and creatures now. People are ignorant about the truth, and I want to change the vocabulary used. Humanoids, in general, have painted all the creatures and entities inside dungeons as monsters when that\u2019s obviously not the case. I want to make it clear from the onset that I recognize that difference and support it. Those under my umbrella don\u2019t need to like it, but they\u2019ll need to accept it.\u201d \u201cDespite the storm\u2019s size, the first raindrops disappear fastest.\u201d The response sounded so much like Sivart, it made Ruwen\u2019s skin prickle. Ruwen grinned. \u201cI actually understood that, but it took me awhile to speak your language. If you agree to help, you\u2019ll need to explain yourself for a while, because concentrated wisdom can sometimes be hard to process.\u201d The bartender returned, and instead of the cup Ruwen had ordered, they held a large souvenir mug. Ruwen frowned at the exhausted scarecrow limply hanging from a wooden support. The seven chickens proudly roosting on the scarecrow\u2019s arms and head ignited a spark of irritation. \u201cI didn\u2019t order this,\u201d Ruwen said, looking up from the mug. The scorpion\u2019s tail pointed upward, and Ruwen followed it to see one of the Savage Seven in a window halfway up the wall, staring intently down at Ruwen. Identify activated, and he learned the Savage Seven had gained forty levels since the last time he\u2019d inspected them. Name: Booming Hen Deity: Miranda Level: 49 Attack Type: Explosive, Ranged Elite Squad: Savage Seven Squad Effect: Chicken or Egg \u2013 when entire squad is within 200 ft from each other, upon death, the deceased Booming Hen will emerge from the next egg to explode. The bartender spoke in a chittering, chirping voice to tell Ruwen that the mug was on the house. Ruwen suppressed a sigh since he didn\u2019t want to act rudely, so he lifted the mug and gave a nod toward the Savage Seven member above. As Ruwen brought the mug to his lips, the bartender chirped loudly, and Ruwen sighed this time. It seemed this establishment counted as a bar, and because of its relationship with Bliz\u2019s bar, Pour Judgement, and in the interest of cooperation with the Void Band wearers, Ruwen needed to use his special tankard when drinking at the Savage Seven Society. He removed the item from Inventory. Name: Tankard of Potency Quality: Legendary Effect (Passive): Spiked Drink \u2013 any liquid placed in tankard becomes contaminated with alcohol. Effect (Triggered): Reckless Intoxication \u2013 lowers Poison Resistance (alcohol) to 0 %. Effect (Triggered): Blissful Nectar \u2013 every ounce consumed increases the alcohol potency of contents until liquid can generate a Stage 1 Intoxication debuff on user. Restriction: User must voluntarily consume the tankard\u2019s contents to trigger Effects. Description: 48 oz. blue-grey mug crafted from an ancient idlewood tree. The Tankard of Potency will overcome the most Fortified of Harvesters. Even gods enjoy a buzz. Ruwen transferred the harvest cider from the souvenir mug into the Tankard of Potency before placing the commemorative cup into Inventory. The bartender left and Ruwen sipped the cider, finding it surprisingly refreshing. \u201cI understand your point, Talker. You think I\u2019m unnecessarily complicating our initial discussions with these foreign powers and putting the entire effort at risk. The reality is they don\u2019t have a choice. They hold no leverage, and any opposition will lead to their death. A death they can\u2019t revive from. To the foreigners you represent an example of how I lead. To the Champions, you\u2019ll provide valuable input into how to use these new additions to aid in our defense.\u201d Their food arrived and Ruwen studied his meal. The Ink Lord wrap took the form of a scroll with the phrase \u201cI come to protect the harvest\u201d burned across it in multiple languages, and the Savage sauce had a bright yellow hue. Talker didn\u2019t touch his food which looked a lot like biscuits and gravy. He spoke without looking at Ruwen. \u201cA general I studied wrote \u2018a leader who changes tactics in accordance with their adversary, controls the result, and earns the title god of war.\u2019\u201d Talker didn\u2019t speak for three seconds and then turned and locked gazes with Ruwen. \u201cI\u2019ve defined myself by my enemies, hence my war against the Black Pyramid, but I\u2019d be a fool to continue this doomed path. It is time I changed tactics and became a god of war myself.\u201d Talker stretched out an arm, the shadowy mist solidifying, and Ruwen clasped forearms with the Mist Wraith. \u201cGlad you\u2019re on board, Talker.\u201d Ruwen felt the dimensional disturbance form behind him and recognized it. He still flinched when the loud gong sounded. \u201cThank the True God,\u201d Blapy said. \u201cI was a scale\u2019s width from surrendering to you, Talker.\u201d \n CHAPTER 4 Ablonde pigtailed seven-year-old girl rose on a chair that grew from the floor. As soon as she reached the same height as the bar, she pounded her fist on the stone surface. \u201cBartender!\u201d The creature hurried over, and Blapy pushed away the drink menu and leaned toward the bartender. \u201cGive me the good stuff,\u201d Blapy demanded. \u201cI know those two have been here. Don\u2019t try and deny it.\u201d The bartender glanced up at the Booming Hen in the window, fifty feet above, and the Savage quickly nodded. The scorpion skittered away faster than Ruwen thought possible. Blapy looked over at Talker. \u201cWhat do you say, General? Let\u2019s call a truce so that you can help this pup.\u201d Talker lifted his vapor-filled glass and tilted it toward Blapy. \u201cYou were a worthy opponent.\u201d The Mist Wraith turned his attention to Ruwen. \u201cThank you for lunch. Please excuse me\u2014I need to figure out how I can transition my organization into this new paradigm.\u201d Talker bowed to Ruwen and Blapy, took his plate and drink, and disappeared further into the bar. \u201cLong time no see,\u201d Ruwen told Blapy. \u201cThose robes you gave Sift raise a lot of questions.\u201d \u201cI already told you, no questions about those clothes.\u201d Ruwen tried to hide his disappointment. He wondered if he could get some information in a roundabout way and opened his mouth to ask about Abyssal Lords. Blapy held up a finger. \u201cStop! If you\u2019re so anxious to talk answer me this\u2014why has tracking Chip and Stump suddenly become impossible? It seems after thousands of years they suddenly discovered Soul Power could energize gate runes.\u201d Ruwen looked away from Blapy and took a long drink from his tankard. Chip and Stump had represented the Black Pyramid in the Step Championship and Ruwen and Sift had fought them in the semi-final match. They brewed a nearly lethal concoction of alcohol that was a favorite among the citizens of the Black Pyramid. Ruwen had revealed to them that Soul Energy could power gate runes when they\u2019d helped out fighting in the rift that had appeared inside the Black Pyramid. Blapy seemed to expect some type of response from Ruwen, so he replied the best he could. \u201cIs it really surprising that it took them so long? Think about what they drink daily. That can\u2019t be good for their brains.\u201d \u201cThey never had any brains. Just like the empty-headed fool who set them loose on an unsuspecting universe.\u201d Ruwen took another long pull from his tankard. \u201cAssuming something like that happened, I\u2019m sure it was mostly an accident.\u201d The bartender returned and placed a goblet on the bar. The cup was made from one large diamond, and the murky liquid inside smoked. The acrid vapor burned the inside of Ruwen\u2019s nose, and he leaned away. Blapy took a deep breath, swirled the liquid, and gulped the entire contents in one go. The bartender fell backward onto his tail in shock. Blapy shook her head violently and turned to Ruwen, her eyes squinted in discomfort. \u201cI knew it. Now that I can\u2019t watch them, they\u2019re brewing even stronger alcohol. The amount of Soul Energy in that glass is enough to melt a Gold\u2019s stomach.\u201d Ruwen made a mental note to tell Bliz that he may need to dilute Chip and Stump\u2019s brew further than the hundred to one he currently used. \u201cIf I don\u2019t keep them busy,\u201d Blapy muttered, \u201csomeone will end up dying.\u201d Blapy raised the diamond glass to the bartender, who had recovered and moved a safe distance away. \u201cI\u2019ll have another. Make it a double.\u201d She pointed at Ruwen with her thumb. \u201cPut it all on his tab, and make sure you give yourself a good tip.\u201d Blapy placed a hand on her stomach, and her whole body shivered. \u201cOof, that really packs a punch.\u201d She faced Ruwen again. \u201cIt seems to me that whoever helped create this mess should help clean it up.\u201d \u201cHypothetically, how would someone do that?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019d keep those two busy, of course, while I figured out a way to track them again before they create something that unravels the fabric of the universe and destroy us all.\u201d \u201cHypothetically, that seems like a difficult task.\u201d \u201cHypothetically,\u201d Blapy said in a mocking tone, \u201csomeone could take them on their alchemy quest.\u201d That surprised Ruwen. \u201cDo you think I should still do that quest? With everything that\u2019s happened?\u201d The bartender returned with a bigger glass, and Blapy nodded her thanks. This time, she sipped at it and didn\u2019t take it like a shot. \u201cIf it was just to get an item from the Mechanism, then maybe not. But the Muses have created a bridge to the Shadow Realm, and I assume it\u2019s related to the quest since all the alchemists are camped near it. Keeping tabs of anything in the Shadow Realm is difficult because magic quickly breaks down there.\u201d \u201cYou want me to spy on the Muses?\u201d \u201cDo what you want\u2014I can\u2019t tell you what to do. I will say that the Shadow Realm isn\u2019t a place to play around in. Whatever the Muses are doing, it\u2019s certainly dangerous.\u201d Blapy took a long drink and shuddered. \u201cThings live there that are better left undisturbed.\u201d That sparked Ruwen\u2019s curiosity. \u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d Blapy said without looking at Ruwen. Ruwen swapped out his original question with another. \u201cWhat do you think the Muses are doing?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve always been a secretive lot\u2014a lot like the Ink Lords. Both groups claim to preserve knowledge, but that purpose has warped their better judgement.\u201d Ruwen recalled the quest Blapy had given him after he\u2019d reached Grandmaster Alchemist. Alchemical Curator of the Muses The Nine Muses require a Curator to protect, restock, and organize their Alchemical Archives. The winner of the Tournament of Perfection will receive this honor. Second place is the first failure. Reward: Title of Alchemical Curator of the Muses Reward: Entry into the Mechanism to claim a single item. Reward: Access to the Alchemical Archives. Restriction: Team size limited to 50. Restriction: Only team leader eligible for quest rewards. \u201cI\u2019ll admit the alchemy quest sounds fun\u201d Ruwen said, \u201cand missing it would cause a lot of disappointment. I\u2019ll assemble a team and head that way. If you want more information immediately, I met a Prime Warden named Zylkin who didn\u2019t seem like too bad of a guy. Although, he will want to fight me the next time we meet.\u201d \u201cOf course, he will.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s a friendly fight. At least I think it is.\u201d Blapy raised her eyebrows. Ruwen considered Zylkin\u2019s demeanor when they\u2019d briefly fought in the swamp during the Step Master\u2019s trial. It was the first time Ruwen\u2019s shadow had been used against him. \u201cWell, if it\u2019s not friendly that\u2019s just one more reason I need to get some experience there.\u201d Ruwen had hoped Ky would be available to start his Shadow Step training, but she hadn\u2019t left the Black Pyramid since the Infernal Realm invasion. \u201cWill Ky be available soon?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cShe\u2019s also roped Lylan and Hamma into her business.\u201d Blapy glanced around the bar, and her eyes lingered on a seemingly empty pot among the plants on a short dividing wall. \u201cAll I can say is that everything should be concluded soon.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good news. I don\u2019t know if Rami gave you all the details about our recent activities, but your escaped prisoners are with Lalquinrial in the Shadow Realm.\u201d Blapy sipped her drink, swirled it, and took another. The air thickened around them as she placed a privacy barrier around them. Without looking at Ruwen, she asked a question. \u201cIs it true you transported an entire occupied city from one planet to another?\u201d Ruwen rubbed his chest where his soul still ached from the enormous expansion. Despite Blapy\u2019s demeanor and tone, he recognized how much help she\u2019d provided him and his friends, and that he\u2019d have failed long ago without her assistance. It made revealing the next information easier. \u201cI don\u2019t hold a clear understanding of what happened on that planet, but to answer your question\u2014yes, I did very briefly place a city in my soul vault.\u201d Blapy turned from her drink and locked eyes with Ruwen. \u201cDarkness take me, how is that possible?\u201d Ruwen rubbed his chest again. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I damaged my soul in the process.\u201d Blapy shook her head. \u201cSuch a noble idiot.\u201d \u201cYeah, well, I\u2019d run out of options,\u201d Ruwen whispered. He paused a few seconds before continuing. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the craziest thing that happened, though, and I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone about it yet, but I didn\u2019t have nearly enough Soul Power to make that transfer.\u201d \u201cRight, because it should be impossible. How did you manage it?\u201d Ruwen rubbed his forehead. \u201cA level two or three artifact filled with faith, hope, courage\u2014and maybe even more concepts\u2014hovered not far above me. Whatever that Affinity thing did to Hamma unlocked something inside her, or activated it, or something because she resonated with that artifact almost as strongly as the woman who\u2019d bonded with it. In fact, Hamma still holds much of that energy even though it drained from the bonded woman within hours.\u201d \u201cYou used the artifact\u2019s energy?\u201d Blapy asked in a shocked voice. \u201cI tried touching the artifact directly with Harmony, but the power was too\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014strange or harsh. I couldn\u2019t use it. But here\u2019s the crazy part, well no, the crazy part comes next, but amazingly, Hamma had absorbed much of this power and done something to the energy to make it bearable for me to handle.\u201d \u201cThat is incredibly interesting,\u201d Blapy said. \u201cPlease tell me the crazy part.\u201d Ruwen locked eyes with Blapy. \u201cUsing Harmony I took the filtered power from Hamma and powered my soul vault.\u201d The words hung between them, and the silence stretched to twenty seconds. Blapy leaned back and shook her head. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d \u201cI am. Pen always believed in a connection between the soul and chakras, but he couldn\u2019t figure out how the relationship worked. The leveling of Sift\u2019s soul has started to unlock that mystery, but I think it\u2019s way bigger than that.\u201d Ruwen paused for five seconds, trying to find the right words for his thoughts. \u201cWhat if all the different types of power are sides of a single magic, and Harmony is the path to understanding, using, and converting all of them?\u201d \n CHAPTER 5 \u201cDid you discover all the magic is related inside Pen\u2019s library?\u201d Blapy asked. The question surprised Ruwen but then he realized of course Blapy would know about Pen\u2019s secret library. \u201cYes,\u201d Ruwen replied. \u201cDid you ever go with him there?\u201d \u201cNo, unfortunately. That object, along with the sword and the item that transfers you between realms, Pen got from Tarot by making some kind of deal, I assume. They possess powerful and strange magic. Tarot probably robbed them from the Outerverse, or from someone originating there.\u201d Ruwen considered that. It put the objects in a different light, and he wondered if Tarot had more of them. Ruwen needed to explore that with the golem. \u201cWell, that will disappoint Rami, but I\u2019ll keep looking for ways. Pen had a lot of diagrams where he tried to piece together a larger pattern, but I think he missed at least two, because whatever happened to Lylan gave her a strange magic I haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d Blapy narrowed her eyes. \u201cWhat do you mean by, \u2018strange\u2019?\u201d Ruwen remembered their fight with the demons in the second ring of the Infernal Realm, and Lylan\u2019s use of odd hand gestures to affect distant opponents. The effects had devastated anything she targeted. \u201cI think it\u2019s a type of geometry or symbol-based magic.\u201d \u201cLike a rune stone?\u201d Ruwen shook his head. \u201cNo, she\u2019s not etching anything, although she might have that ability. She used her hands to make\u2014odd gestures. I\u2019ve never seen it before.\u201d Blapy remained quiet for ten seconds, and Ruwen didn\u2019t interrupt her contemplation. Finally, she lowered the barrier and got the bartender\u2019s attention, pointed at her drink, and held up five fingers. The bartender\u2019s eyes grew wide, and the peacock feathers behind its neck fanned out in shock, but the scorpion tail didn\u2019t hesitate to snatch something from a hidden location under the bar, and thirty seconds later, five diamond goblets formed a line in front of Blapy. She gave the bartender a nod in thanks, before replacing the barrier. Blapy drank the first glass in one long pull, and her body shuddered. She placed the empty glass carefully back on the bar, grabbed the second one, and repeated the process. This time, she squeezed her eyes shut and appeared to experience intense pain. After fifteen seconds, Blapy opened her eyes and faced Ruwen. \u201cAgainst my better judgment, I\u2019m going to tell you\u2060\u2014\u201d Blapy seemed to have second thoughts and grabbed the third glass, draining it in one go as well. She laid her head on the bar top and groaned. Drinking that liquor didn\u2019t appear sensible or healthy to Ruwen, but he held his tongue. After a minute, Blapy raised her head, displaying red cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m really going to regret this,\u201d she muttered. Blapy released a deep sigh and locked eyes with Ruwen. \u201cI\u2019m going to reveal some of Miranda\u2019s secrets. It\u2019s too painful to explain in that form, so I\u2019m going to do it like this.\u201d Blapy summoned her stuffed centipede Cuddles and clutched it tight for a second before continuing. \u201cRami showed me all your quests, and I\u2019ve studied the items you received from the rift quest. I\u2019m familiar with what Lylan is doing, although I didn\u2019t have a name for it until seeing the references to a Primal faction in your quests.\u201d Ruwen didn\u2019t move and kept his expression neutral, as whatever Blapy wanted to tell him about Miranda\u2019s experience was obviously difficult and painful to discuss. He didn\u2019t want to do or say anything that caused her to stop. \u201cWhen Pen got those items, the Triumvirate Bridge specifically, it made getting into the Spirit and Shadow realms trivial, and he spent significant time in each to understand their purpose. In my natural form, the barrier between realms takes little effort to cross. This isn\u2019t common for my kind and is an innate ability I was born with. I\u2019ll come back to that in a bit.\u201d Blapy took a sip from her fourth glass, and Ruwen drank cider to keep himself from asking any questions and ruining the moment. \u201cAs you know, the Shadow Realm has Wardens that act as a type of buffer between the Material Realm and the Shadow Realm, and we\u2019d met a few of them. They\u2019d strongly suggested that we stay near the barrier.\u201d Blapy arranged the empty glasses into a triangle. \u201cThat said,\u201d she continued, \u201cwe chose an empty section of the universe that didn\u2019t contain any Wardens, which allowed us to explore the Shadow Realm to our hearts\u2019 content. We traveled deep into the realm, the farthest we\u2019d ever ventured.\u201d Ruwen didn\u2019t breathe and remained motionless. \u201cTo our shock, we encountered others deep in the Shadow Realm. It didn\u2019t take us long to figure out that they matched or exceeded our power, because we couldn\u2019t catch up to any of them. Pen and I were the two most powerful beings in the Universe, and nothing should have avoided our grasp.\u201d Blapy sighed. \u201cOne creature in particular watched and studied us, but always easily evaded our attempts at contact. We didn\u2019t even know what they looked like. Not until later.\u201d Blapy took a longer drink from her fourth glass and pinched the bridge of her nose before turning to Ruwen. \u201cHave you ever wondered how Pen did it? How he extracted all the Spirit from the universe?\u201d The suddenness of the profound question stunned Ruwen, and after two seconds, he finally managed a response. \u201cMaybe a few times.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s another monumental secret. He didn\u2019t do it alone.\u201d Ruwen remained very still, scared that any movement might disturb this chance at answering a question he\u2019d thought about daily since understanding the scope of what he needed to do. Blapy finished the alcohol in the fourth glass in one shot, then quickly drained the fifth. Her hand shook as she placed it on the bar top. She lowered her head, and Ruwen worried she\u2019d passed out. Terrified the secret would remain unspoken, Ruwen contemplated shaking Blapy, but decided against it. He waited patiently instead. After a minute, Blapy raised her head. She clenched her fist, and Ruwen felt immense pressure as multiple additional shields surrounded them. \u201cThose shields will protect our privacy in case that wretched golem is around. I don\u2019t want him to know more than he already does.\u201d Blapy rubbed her stomach and winced. \u201cWhat nobody knew back then, not even Pen, was that I had felt something while in the Shadow Realm and had returned on my own many times. I kept trying to track down the entity that watched us, and eventually, they revealed themselves.\u201d Blapy\u2019s eyes glazed over, as if remembering, before she resumed. \u201cWhen Pen and I learned about the Darkness we desperately looked for solutions. It was my\u2014\u201d Blapy paused as if searching for the right word. \u201cIt was my friend who helped us determine the answer and, in fact, helped us implement it.\u201d Ruwen absorbed the information like a dry sponge. \u201cI\u2019m telling you this for two reasons: first, you asked me a few days ago if I knew how to return all the Spirit to the universe. And second, I think this experience relates to the Primal faction that\u2019s mentioned in your quest, which I also think explains Lylan\u2019s abilities.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cI have no idea where to start on my own.\u201d \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how to put the Spirit back, but I can explain how we removed it. It took some trial and error along with plenty of practice, but the end result utilized the loophole Pen had discovered. The one where a Divine Realm remains open when its creator dies so long as someone stays inside. We used the power of the Shadow Realm to funnel the Spirit through Pen and into his Realm. The cost, of course, was catastrophic. My\u2014\u201d she paused, \u201cfriend was severely injured, Pen died, and I remain trapped, possibly forever.\u201d As if the pain had become too much, Blapy hurriedly continued. \u201cWith all this recent knowledge, I think the only way my friend could\u2019ve known so much about how the universe worked\u2014coupled with the immense power required to pull all the Spirit through Pen\u2014must mean he originated in the Outerverse. Tarot implied entities concealed themselves in the Spirit and Shadow Realms, so I think my friend was a Primal, and his power appeared inherent to his form. If it\u2019s true we each contain the powers of all the Outerverse factions, then I think Lylan and the hydra connected at this Primal level.\u201d Notifications blinked in the lower edge of Ruwen\u2019s vision, and he guessed they were probably knowledge levels. He considered the robes Blapy had just given to Sift and their reference to something called an Abyssal Lord, but Ruwen\u2019s Wisdom had increased enough to resist asking about it. Discussing this caused her obvious pain and he didn\u2019t want to pry just to satisfy his curiosity. The reasons why Blapy found the topic difficult caused another thought to surface, and this question he did ask. \u201cPen died removing all the Spirit,\u201d Ruwen whispered, and then forced himself to finish his thought. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll die putting it back?\u201d Blapy\u2019s eyes glistened as she locked gazes with Ruwen. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Maybe.\u201d A lump formed in Ruwen\u2019s throat, and he nodded. \u201cI figured.\u201d They sat in silence for thirty seconds, both lost in their thoughts. Regardless of the final outcome, the only clue Ruwen had led to the Shadow Realm. That thought caused Ruwen\u2019s Cleverness attribute to trigger, and he gasped at the connections it revealed. \n CHAPTER 6 Ruwen locked eyes with Blapy. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. You knew that I\u2019d need to enter the Shadow Realm because the solution to the Fourth Secret might reside there. That\u2019s why you suppressed Fractal\u2019s alchemy levels\u2014because you knew I\u2019d force level my alchemy for his sake. You needed this to happen because this rare alchemy quest involved the Shadow Realm. It\u2019s why you helped me so much to reach Grandmaster.\u201d Blapy smiled in satisfaction but didn\u2019t comment. Ruwen shook his head in amazement. \u201cI\u2019m both awed by your methods and upset by the manipulation.\u201d Blapy grinned mischievously. \u201cYou think too small, Starfield. Let me ask you some questions. Do you think that I need a Dungeon Master for the Black Pyramid?\u201d \u201cOf course not.\u201d \u201cYet, I always have one. And why Kysandra? Is she capable? Of course\u2014one hundred percent. Is her network valuable to me? Yes. Is she so spectacular that she stands out among all the best beings on Grave? No. So why, Ruwen, do you think I chose her? Here\u2019s a hint\u2026she holds what all my Dungeon Masters possessed throughout the Black Pyramid\u2019s existence.\u201d Because of the context of their conversation, Ruwen came to the conclusion immediately. \u201cThe Shadow Realm.\u201d \u201cYour intelligence doesn\u2019t disappoint. Yes, the Shadow Realm. Let me ask you another question\u2014how many deities or Dungeon Cores would allow other deities specially selected Ascendant to wield power in their dungeon?\u201d Blapy meant Ky and the fact she\u2019d agreed to take the mark of Uru\u2019s Hand. Each Champion had five such people, picked out by the goddess herself, to provide help and mentorship. \u201cKy was your Dungeon Mistress before I was born,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cBefore you drove the Resonance Offset to zero and made predictions nearly impossible, I kept track of all those with future paths that intersected my own. Whenever I found them, I attempted to bring them closer to me.\u201d Ruwen had read enough of Pen\u2019s journals and notes to know Uru, or Eiru as she was called back then, was well liked by the True God. It made sense that Blapy would\u2019ve known that and kept closer tabs on the goddess\u2019 activities. \u201cHow common do you think it is,\u201d Blapy continued, \u201cto allow a level one Ascendant into the Black Pyramid? Spoiler, you were the first. In fact, Ky didn\u2019t even consider it because it was so outrageous until I happened to suggest it.\u201d Once Ruwen became Uru\u2019s Champion, Blapy would\u2019ve understood his connection to the Fourth Secret. \u201cYou guessed the Fourth Secret\u2019s solution would require the Shadow Realm, so you\u2019ve kept Shadow experts close to you, and when you noticed my connections to Pen\u2019s poem about the Fourth Secret, you arranged for Ky to take me to the pyramid.\u201d Ruwen leaned back as another thought struck him. \u201cDid you bring the Addas to the Black Pyramid?\u201d Blapy grinned again. \u201cNow you\u2019re thinking. Without the benefit of a Grandmaster Alchemist of Fortune, one needs to make their own luck. So I took an opportunity to shelter them with the hopes their Step Clan\u2019s association with the Shadow Realm might prove valuable.\u201d The magnitude of Blapy\u2019s planning weighed on Ruwen. It explained many of the oddities that had occurred to him after his Ascendancy. Blapy had gone to great lengths to expose him to the Shadow Realm, or at least set up the foundation to understand it. Ruwen had many questions, but one seemed the most pertinent to his problems. \u201cDo you think that your friend would help me empty the Third Secret?\u201d Blapy frowned, and her eyes glistened. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I know helping us hurt him in some way, damaged him.\u201d The response surprised Ruwen. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen him since?\u201d As soon as Ruwen asked the question, he realized it might be deeply personal. \u201cNo,\u201d Blapy said quietly. \u201cMy clones don\u2019t last very long in the Shadow Realm. It has a destructive effect on everything in it. The deeper you go, the stronger the destruction. And\u2026it upset him that I would be the one to remain in Pen\u2019s realm because he knew it would separate us. He begged me to send someone else. But who? Who else had the strength of mind and character to do such a thing when it might last an eternity?\u201d Blapy seemed to be talking to herself, lost among distant memories. Ruwen understood then another of the massive sacrifices that Miranda had made. Not only had she lost her bonded best friend, but she\u2019d also sacrificed a relationship that meant a lot to her. All to save everyone else. \u201cI understand,\u201d Ruwen whispered. He slowly reached over and placed a hand on top of Blapy\u2019s. \u201cThank you. Truly, this universe owes you more than it can repay.\u201d Blapy stared at the hand atop hers for five seconds and then patted Ruwen\u2019s hand. She met his gaze and spoke with an earnest voice. \u201cIf you ever discuss my friend with anyone\u2026I\u2019ll turn you inside out.\u201d Blapy patted Ruwen\u2019s hand one more time and then withdrew hers. \u201cAnd thank you for the sympathy.\u201d Ruwen didn\u2019t know if Blapy could actually turn him inside out, but he didn\u2019t plan on finding out. \u201cHiding this from Rami will be hard, and by hard, I mean impossible.\u201d Blapy waved a hand at Ruwen. \u201cRami doesn\u2019t count. She already knows all that.\u201d Blapy slid off the barstool and wavered on her feet. She placed a hand on the back of the stool and closed her eyes for five seconds. \u201cI really need to find those two before any more of that alcohol reaches the public.\u201d \u201cHow are they creating portals so quickly? It took five people a significant amount of time when I witnessed it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with knowledge. It\u2019s like fertilizer. And when someone pours fertilizer on a weed, it grows out of control. For example, two troublemakers fresh with the knowledge of Soul based portals, might realize the alcohol they supercharge with Soul Energy is strong enough to power gate runes. And if it\u2019s one thing those two rabble-rousers have plenty of, it\u2019s alcohol.\u201d Ruwen winced, and while he applauded Chip\u2019s and Stump\u2019s clever use of their alcohol, he kept that opinion to himself. Blapy pointed at Ruwen. \u201cI feel a tiny bit guilty for shoving those two pests onto your alchemy quest team, so I\u2019ll give you some valuable advice. You\u2019ve just started your alchemy journey, but I can tell you from experience that finding the correct recipe and testing all the various mutations is time-consuming and exhausting. In fact, most Grandmaster Alchemists delegate their ideas to other alchemists to more quickly zero in on the correct recipe. I\u2019m telling you this because our chapter has two other high-level alchemists, and if you could convince them to join you, it would likely be the difference between success and failure. Normally, a chapter would never allow so many of its high-level alchemists to gather in one place as the chance for kidnapping or assassination greatly increases.\u201d \u201cKidnapping or assassination?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cOh yes, it\u2019s an alchemical tradition to kidnap your competition and torture their secret recipes out of them. Or at the very least, kill off enough alchemists to weaken a chapter. That\u2019s why the party size is so large for this quest. Of the fifty people allowed, most will bring forty fighters, thieves, and assassins. Alchemists are almost as dangerous and crazy as Ink Lords.\u201d \u201cOkay, thank you. I\u2019ll take all the help I can get. Where can I find them to explain the situation?\u201d Blapy looked up and to the side as she thought and, after three seconds, turned her focus to Ruwen. \u201cIt might be better if I talk to them, as their reaction to working with a Grandmaster who looks like he\u2019s in middle school might prove unpredictable.\u201d Ruwen\u2019s cheeks warmed self-consciously, and he rubbed his chin as he considered growing a beard. It would make him look older. The beard is mine, Overlord said. You can\u2019t just copy me. Please tell me you recognize the irony of that statement. Ruwen refocused on Blapy. \u201cIs there anything I can do to help convince them? I plan on bringing some powerful people if they\u2019re concerned about their safety. Plus, you\u2019ve already given me Chip and Stump, and they can easily handle anything those alchemists can concoct.\u201d Blapy shook her head and immediately groaned, applying pressure to her temples with two fingers. \u201cThat was a mistake,\u201d she whispered to herself. Ten seconds later, Blapy opened her eyes and looked up at Ruwen. \u201cThe reasons they\u2019ll resist going are unrelated to safety. They can hold their own in a fight. If I convince them, I\u2019ll send them along with some chapter resources so that you\u2019re not starting from scratch.\u201d \u201cWhat if you can\u2019t persuade them? Will you still send resources?\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019ll send someone to deliver the chapter\u2019s contribution.\u201d \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll do our chapter proud.\u201d \u201cI expect nothing less,\u201d Blapy said, and then disappeared. The air rushed into the area where Blapy had stood, creating a snapping sound. Ruwen hoped the two alchemists would join him, as he hadn\u2019t considered how much work coming up with recipes on his own might be. He had Arcanum inside his head, and she could control hundreds of Alchemy Minions to aid him, but two experienced alchemists would surely speed everything up. Blapy had sounded unconvinced about getting them to come, so he kept his expectations low to avoid disappointment. Ruwen sipped his cider and took another bite of his wrap, which tasted surprisingly good, especially when dipped in the Savage Seven sauce. An unexpected side effect of his Cooking and Herbalism leveling from alchemy was that well-planned and cooked meals supplied another satisfying level of enjoyment. Ruwen\u2019s expertise provided him insight into the complex spices used in various methods of preparation, which all worked together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. Whoever the Savage Seven had gotten to cook for their restaurant had surely reached mastery level in Cooking. Ruwen already had a list of people he wanted to bring on his quest. With the information Blapy had presented he reconsidered and verified they all remained good candidates. The alchemy quest wasn\u2019t the only consideration, however, since he needed to acquire many different skills and this outing might provide an opportunity to learn them. Blapy had offered Chip and Stump, and the addition of both would vastly increase the quest group\u2019s offensive and defensive capabilities. Plus, it would give Ruwen an opportunity to learn Chip\u2019s body magic and Stump\u2019s illusion magic. Ruwen opened his notifications and the last one displayed. Gong! You have increased your Knowledge! Level: 1,331 Intelligence wields Knowledge like a sword and Wisdom wears it like armor\u2014Greatness requires both. Ruwen\u2019s previous value had been one thousand two hundred nineteen which meant the information Blapy had provided had increased his Knowledge by one hundred twelve points. Curious how this affected his Cleverness he glanced through his Profile as he ate. Profile Age: 17 Deity: Divine Apostasy Fortification Tier: Divine \u2013 Angel Architect Role: Level 2 Soul Level: 2 Cultivation Stage: 79/100 Bamboo Rank: Grandmaster - Rank 10 Viper Rank: Grandmaster - Rank 10 Shadow Rank: Grandmaster: Rank 0 Black Pyramid Cipher Level: 10 Black Pyramid Dungeon Level: 6 Black Pyramid Librarian Rank: Ink Lord Dungeon Master - Shattered Sun Tier: 11 Shattered Sun State: Excellent Shattered Sun Keeper State: Superb Soul Vault Count: 0 Inventory: 498/1,000 Alchemy Level: 1,001 Alchemy Rank: Grandmaster Alchemy Focus: Fortune Certifying Institution: Black Pyramid (Highest Honors) Certifying Grand Master: Goddess Miranda Karmic Offset: 72 Harmonic Spell Points: 4 Pools Health: 6,000 Spirit: 291,000 Physical Energy: 13,067 Soul Power: 3/1,000 Wing Resonance: 1,000 Mental Energy: 999,999 Attributes Strength: 680 Stamina: 600 Dexterity: 680 Intelligence: 1,805 Wisdom: 630 Charisma: 480 Ratings Armor Class: 5,515 Knowledge: 1,331 Critical Chance: 356% Haste: 423% Dodge: 1,147% Persuasion: 219% Resilience: 286% Cleverness: 2,713% Perception: 655% Regeneration per Second Health: 26 Physical Energy: 282 Soul: 0.00001 Wing Resonance: 17 Mental Energy: 278 Resistances Elemental: 288% Poison: 288% Acid: 288% Mind: 3,399% Order: 288% Chaos: 284% Disease: 288% Light: 288% Dark: 284% \n CHAPTER 7 Ruwen\u2019s Cleverness had reached over two thousand seven hundred percent and he could tell the difference. Connections came much faster than before and he rarely felt any pain. He\u2019d only completed seventy-nine percent of the Cultivation Stage quests, and he really wanted to finish the last four: spirit project in current realm, spirit project into different realm, translocate body in current realm, and translocate body into different realm. One glaring issue remained and Ruwen\u2019s Profile highlighted the issue. When he\u2019d rescued Nymthus and her city from their exploding planet he\u2019d placed it in his soul. The act had only lasted a few moments, but it had severely damaged his soul and in the days since he\u2019d only regenerated three soul points. Three out of the thousand didn\u2019t bode well when, before the rescue, he\u2019d generated nine per second. Ruwen finished his sandwich and drank the last of his cider. He opened his Inventory and checked his currency: fifty coppers, ten silver, and a gold. That probably would cover his and Talker\u2019s meals, but doubted Blapy\u2019s five shots of death liquid would be so cheap. Sift probably had a tab here because all the Black Pyramid residents, and now by extension the Shattered Sun, loved him. Especially the Savage Seven. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t surprise Ruwen if Sift ate here for free. He considered shoving all this onto Sift\u2019s tab, but decided against it. He needed to give Talker some funds anyway. Instead of using Spirit to form a terium coin, Ruwen removed a small chunk of solid terium from his Inventory. He cupped his hands over it and channeled Melt. Using Harmony, he created a mold of sound, and when the terium had completely sublimated, he switched to Harden, turning it back into a solid. Blapy had once taken a deformed terium coin Ruwen had created with his Spirit and perfected it. Turning the lumpy circle into a hexagon with the Shattered Sun mark, an exploding sun, on one side. Ruwen smiled at the identical coin in his palm. Almost identical. He flipped the coin over and revealed the excellent depiction of the Dungeon Keeper, Fractal. Ruwen raised the coin above his head, which got the bartender\u2019s attention. \u201cThis is for my tab. Give the change to Talker.\u201d The bartender nodded as Ruwen placed the coin on the bar. Ruwen glanced up the wall and found one of the Savage Seven chickens watching him. Sliding off the chair, he gave the chicken a small bow, and the chicken bobbed its head in return. Ruwen wanted to avoid any place Sift might find him, and he considered his options as he walked toward the door. A small portrait of Hamma sat along the right edge of his vision. They always kept a group formed with the two of them to make chatting easier. As if Ruwen\u2019s attention activated the portrait, it lit up. A heartbeat later Hamma used Chat. Hi! Where are you? Blapy convinced Ky to set Lylan and me free. Hey, glad you\u2019re finally back. Is Lylan with you? No, why? Just trying to avoid Sift for a while. What did you do to him? Ruwen paused for a second, wondering if Fluffy had caught Sift in the lower vault. Nothing. That\u2019s a lie for sure. Let\u2019s go get that figurine for Archie before Ky grabs me again or you and Sift cause some type of mischief. Okay, I\u2019ll ask Lir to portal us. Uh, where are we going exactly? I\u2019ll tell him. Three seconds later a portal appeared and Ruwen stepped through, exiting near the outskirts of a small town. Hamma appeared and she leaped at him. He caught her and laughed as they hugged. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to be home,\u201d Hamma said as Ruwen put her down. Ruwen dropped a book into his hand and held it out to Hamma. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a duplicate of that Affinity Primer we earned from the Rift quest. Hopefully it gives you some insight into whatever\u2019s happening to you.\u201d Hamma took the book excitedly. \u201cThank you! I\u2019m so excited to read this.\u201d \u201cMe too actually.\u201d Hamma and Ruwen strode toward the small city that had arisen where the Crystal Forest surrounding the Shattered Sun met the Desolate mountains. Calling it a city was an overstatement, as it didn\u2019t contain the usual number of taverns and inns, likely due to the uncertainty that still surrounded New Eiru. They stepped onto the main thoroughfare, and it contained more people than Ruwen expected. Even more surprising, only half looked like adventurers here for the Shattered Sun, their armor and weapons giving them away. Foreigners bustled about everywhere, and Ruwen heard multiple languages. Everyone spoke in a subdued tone, and it gave the surroundings a bit of an oppressive air. The city also lacked the heavy scent of baked goods or cooking meat, as the brisk wind coming off the Desolate mountains whisked away any smells and chilled the air. Ruwen still wore his Black Pyramid Shade attire and when people kept staring at him, he put on a black cloak that Hamma had purchased for him. She had felt the same stares and now wore a similar white cloak. They pulled their hoods forward to shield their faces returning them to anonymity. The majority of structures looked like temples. They allowed adventurers to sync with their deity before venturing into the Shattered Sun, and in the unfortunate event of their death, would provide revival services. Most of the other shops related to either resources earned in the Shattered Sun or armor and weapon stores that provided upgrades and repairs. Ruwen noticed multiple bookshops which had likely appeared because the Shattered Sun offered better loot rewards when the adventurers provided a rare book in the beginning of the dungeon run. Fractal had implemented this process to collect books for Ruwen. They passed an air sled terminal, and Ruwen observed a packed sled of people unload and disperse into the city. It appeared that many of the people who worked and shopped here came from the surrounding suburbs. Stone Mages had created most of the structures which consisted of single-story granite cubes. A few buildings had a second level that likely provided a residence for the owner. Hamma pulled Ruwen forward when he slowed down to glance in the window of an alchemy shop. \u201cWe can come back and spend as long as you want in all these shops, I promise,\u201d Hamma said touching the pendant of her necklace. \u201cI just want to get this figurine first because it keeps getting delayed.\u201d Ruwen nodded and squeezed Hamma\u2019s hand. As much as he\u2019d dreaded going shopping with Hamma, it turned out this place had many interesting stores, and he wondered if Rami had already visited the bookstores. But they\u2019d come to get a figurine for Archie, which had already gotten delayed multiple times. Blapy had created Archie long ago and, in a rare moment of poor foresight, had given Archie the ability to exist in many places at once, basically making him unkillable and an immense snoop. During Hamma\u2019s chapel priestess quest, she\u2019d bonded with Archie, who kept a piece of himself inside the pendant of Hamma\u2019s necklace. Archie had retrieved Ruwen\u2019s Apocalypse Hoop from the depths of the Black Pyramid vaults before the Infernal Lord\u2019s demons could steal it. Ruwen owed the creature a vast debt of gratitude, which was why he wanted to accompany Hamma. He planned to buy a figurine as well to show his appreciation. \u201cWhere are we going exactly?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not one of the shops. Archie told me that Blapy purchased figurines from a priestess in the temple carved into the base of a mountain. I know they\u2019re Archie\u2019s favorite figurines, so I want to try there first to see if the priestess will let me buy one as well.\u201d As they continued to walk, the buildings transitioned into larger structures, and Ruwen didn\u2019t recognize many of the deities they represented. The only one he felt confident about was a five-story tower made from bloodstone and guarded by two large, intimidating golems. It surprised Ruwen for a moment that Izac would build a temple here, but it made perfect sense as he could deploy spies from this location, and it provided an easy revival location. Ruwen focused on Lir. We\u2019re limiting the number of revivals per day for these temples, right? Correct. Each temple can revive five of their citizens per day. They can appeal for a dispensation to temporarily revive more if the situation warrants it. Like if a forty-man raid wiped. Exactly. Over fifty temples lined the streets off the main road, far more than Ruwen had anticipated. All this indicated the value Fractal had created in the Shattered Sun. The air temperature cooled further as they neared the mountain, and the sheer rock blocked the sunlight. Hamma slowed and then stopped. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ruwen asked. Hamma pointed to the left, and Ruwen noticed an opening. It looked more like a cave than the entrance to a temple. Hamma bit her lip. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cCheck your map.\u201d Ruwen expanded his map. \u201cOh.\u201d The entrance led into the Naktos Temple. Hamma\u2019s heart rate and breathing increased as she struggled with a decision, and Ruwen waited patiently. Hamma stepped in front of Ruwen and locked eyes with him. \u201cNaktos just tried to kill us, and I certainly don\u2019t want to support him. If you think buying the priestess\u2019s sculptures does that, then we can leave right now.\u201d The statement caused a flood of memories about the Stone Carver Valora to surface. When Lylan had gotten captured and imprisoned in an underground cave during the lead-up to the battle of New Eiru, Ruwen had battled the Naktos Stone Carver during their rescue of Lylan. Ruwen had, in self-defense, sliced off Valora\u2019s arm with his Void Band. When he\u2019d inspected the arm later, he\u2019d found it contained a bracelet that mirrored his own Void Band but without the soul-binding. When he\u2019d looked inside the bracelet\u2019s inventory, he\u2019d found, among other things, the artifact that he\u2019d given to Nymthus, which had provided the power that he\u2019d utilized to save an entire city. Sadly, Ruwen had destroyed the artifact in the process. The sculpture, so perfect and beautiful that it provided buffs just by looking at it, now sat in pieces inside his Inventory, and he had a quest to return them to Valora. The last time Ruwen had seen the Stone Carver had been when he\u2019d dashed through New Eiru during the peak of the fighting. He\u2019d stood at the edge of the hole that contained the third temple, preparing to dive inside. Valora had chased after Ruwen, still missing her arm, and screaming like an enraged madwoman. She\u2019d demanded that he destroy the sculpture, which only confirmed the woman\u2019s insanity. Not sure how to handle the situation, but knowing he didn\u2019t want to destroy such a marvelous sculpture, he\u2019d instead launched Valora\u2019s own arm out of his Void Band like some sort of perverse crossbow bolt. Maybe the priestess here would know what happened to Valora and could pass a message to her expressing Ruwen\u2019s regret and his desire to meet. Hamma waited patiently while Ruwen considered all this. It was one of the many reasons he loved her. She knew he preferred to consider things before acting and didn\u2019t interrupt or nag him to hurry. \u201cI think we should go down,\u201d Ruwen said. Hamma smiled. \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cYeah. Archie deserves the best, and this is where we find that. Maybe this priestess can help me find Valora and I can get rid of this quest. Besides, there\u2019s nothing down there that can hurt us.\u201d Hamma kissed Ruwen and then strode toward the entrance, pulling him along behind. He laughed at her enthusiasm. Despite the rough opening, once they stepped inside, the walls, floor, and ceiling became polished granite, and they gleamed in the light of the suspended shakers that were suspended by strands of rock as thin as spiderwebs. The tunnel sloped downward in a corkscrew fashion and Ruwen used Stone Echo and Survey to confirm the temple contained no hidden passages or traps. Their path led to a large cavity fifty feet under the surface which contained a handful of adjoining rooms that were likely the revival baths and living quarters of the clergy. They rounded the last turn, and a sizable worship area opened up before them. The room was a two-hundred-foot half sphere that curved gently upward to the ceiling\u2019s peak one hundred feet above. Survey confirmed that the top half of the room burrowed into the mountain itself. Strange lizards, worms, and other creatures that Ruwen assumed lived deep underground were etched into the walls, and a thirty-foot statue of Naktos stood at the far end. At the statue\u2019s base stood a small altar, and a cloaked figure kneeled before it. Ruwen pointed at the far figure and whispered to Hamma. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s the priestess?\u201d Ruwen\u2019s voice boomed loudly in the room, and he realized too late that the acoustics of the room caused this location to amplify sound. Likely because worshippers of Naktos would say some greeting or praise to their lord as they entered. Ruwen and Hamma both winced and looked at each other before turning their attention back to the figure, who waited until his voice stopped echoing and the room returned to silence. The figure stood and paused, and Ruwen wondered if they should move further into the room. Hamma squeezed Ruwen\u2019s hand and shook her head slightly. Ruwen nodded and relaxed. Hamma was a priestess, after all, and knew how to act in these types of situations. The figure slowly turned and locked eyes with Ruwen. Ruwen\u2019s eyes flicked to the priestess\u2019s missing arm before he could stop himself. He\u2019d found Valora. \n CHAPTER 8 Ruwen\u2019s jaw dropped as he met Valora\u2019s gaze, the woman looked much as Ruwen remembered her. She was young, maybe fifty, and barely over five feet tall. Her black hair didn\u2019t reach her shoulders, and he doubted she weighed a hundred pounds. The methane sacks around her neck had wings tattooed on them. Ruwen triggered his Disposition Aura, and to his surprise, the red glow he\u2019d expected around her had already mostly faded to a white neutral. After a second, he turned off the aura, and a soft yellow glow appeared, indicating he could complete a quest with her. Hamma pulled lightly on Ruwen\u2019s hand. \u201cAre you okay? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ruwen tore his eyes away from Valora to glance at Hamma. His friends had seen the artifact and had appreciated its beauty, but none of them had actually seen the woman who\u2019d created it. Ruwen had only seen Valora twice: the battle in the underground cave where he\u2019d sliced off her arm and then the night of the battle for New Eiru where he\u2019d launched that same arm back at her. Hamma frowned with concern as Ruwen turned to Valora, and once again stared at her missing arm. How had Valora ended up here as a priestess in the Naktos Temple? As angry as she\u2019d been during the battle, he\u2019d expected her to die running into a mass of crazor fire. Hamma stepped in front of Ruwen and waved a hand in front of his eyes. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d With an effort, Ruwen pulled his eyes from Valora\u2019s relaxed expression, which only confused him more, and locked eyes with Hamma. \u201cIt\u2019s her.\u201d Hamma sighed and with forced patience continued. \u201cCan you try and be a little more specific?\u201d Ruwen gestured with his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s her, you know, the one who made the thing.\u201d Hamma closed her eyes for a moment before trying again. \u201cDarkness take me, when you get flustered, it\u2019s like your brain turns off. Who is she, and what is the thing?\u201d Ruwen gathered his thoughts. \u201cSorry. Her name is Valora, and she\u2019s the Stone Carver that made the artifact.\u201d \u201cThe one you just broke?\u201d Hamma whispered. \u201cYou broke it?\u201d Valora\u2019s voice crossed the distance clearly. Hamma\u2019s eyes went wide, and she slowly returned to Ruwen\u2019s side. \u201cThis is really awkward. You cut off her arm and then broke her divine sculpture.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m aware, Hamma.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s never going to sell us a figurine now.\u201d \u201cYou broke it?\u201d Valora asked again. Ruwen\u2019s Perception detected anger but not nearly as much as he\u2019d expected. The Stone Carver displayed more sadness than anything else, and if Ruwen wasn\u2019t mistaken, relief. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cFor what?\u201d Valora asked. \u201cFor cutting off my arm? For stealing my life\u2019s work? For shooting my own arm back at me? For destroying something precious?\u201d Ruwen winced and flicked his hood off his head. He closed his eyes for three seconds as he tried to form an explanation. Ruwen met Valora\u2019s eyes and then bowed deeply, holding it for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for all of it. Truly. I hope you\u2019ll give me a chance to explain, as I\u2019ve much to tell you and, more importantly, the sincere thanks from hundreds of thousands of souls.\u201d Valora nodded and waved her hand at the floor, causing a stone bench to rise out of the ground. Ruwen walked forward, pulling Hamma along. \u201cIs this a good idea?\u201d Hamma whispered. \u201cMaybe we should go somewhere else.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Ruwen whispered back. \u201cMaybe you can re-heal her arm or something.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that. I can\u2019t just heal an arm that\u2019s been missing for two years. Or at least I don\u2019t think I can, but now is not a good time to try and fail.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m content the way I am,\u201d Valora said. \u201cI appreciate the thought, but my condition reminds me of my failures and provides a great source of strength for me.\u201d \u201cOkay, now it\u2019s really awkward,\u201d Hamma whispered. As they approached, a simple stool rose from the stone behind Valora, and she sat. Hamma and Ruwen sat on the bench, and even though five feet separated them from the priestess, it still felt too close. \u201cI kept it, you know,\u201d Valora said, and seeing Ruwen\u2019s confused expression, continued, \u201cMy arm.\u201d Ruwen\u2019s Perception had gone into overdrive, and he sensed Hamma\u2019s fidgeting at the continually increasing awkwardness and Valora\u2019s calm demeanor. He wondered if she had already gone crazy. Maybe that\u2019s what Naktos did with crazy people. He put them inside temples and made them priestesses. Suddenly, he wished he\u2019d listened to Hamma and left. Valora didn\u2019t continue, evidently waiting for Ruwen to respond to the fact she\u2019d kept her dead arm. \u201cThat seems a little strange, to be honest.\u201d Hamma kicked Ruwen\u2019s ankle and then leaned forward and spoke in a gentle voice. \u201cI can see how doing that might help one deal with the loss.\u201d Valora gave a shallow bow to Hamma. \u201cIt did, priestess. It became a totem of everything that had been taken from me. Then, after some time, it became the foundation that allowed me to sculpt my salvation. It\u2019s ironic that it took losing my arm to gain what I\u2019d been searching for.\u201d \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d Hamma asked. \u201cPeace.\u201d \u201cYou do look surprisingly less angry than I expected,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cThe last time we met, you were screaming at me to destroy the sculpture. Is that why you\u2019re at peace? Because you know that I broke it?\u201d The methane sacs on Valora\u2019s neck flared, but she quickly regained control of herself. \u201cThat was a difficult night for me. With the Infernal Realm so close, I was terrified\u2026\u201d Valora paused and looked up at the statue of Naktos before returning her attention to Ruwen. \u201c\u2026I was afraid someone would take it from you and give it to the demons who\u2019d paid for its creation.\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t get it,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cIn fact, it was instrumental in stopping their plans to annihilate an entire city.\u201d Valora leaned forward, and her eyes widened. \u201cPlease tell me.\u201d Ruwen explained about Nymthus and her people and their fight against the demons. He told the priestess how Nymthus connected with the artifact and leveled it up with courage, faith, and hope. Without providing any real details, he explained how the artifact had provided the power to transport an entire city and almost a million souls to safety, and the cost had shattered the artifact. Tears streamed down Valora\u2019s cheeks, and she let them fall to the stone floor. \u201cThank you for telling me that. It means more than you can imagine.\u201d Valora turned her gaze to Hamma. \u201cWhat was your involvement, priestess? I feel the power that still clings to you like a newborn baby. Looking at you is a reflection of my sculpture. You shine with the purity of the source.\u201d Hamma\u2019s cheeks reddened, and she couldn\u2019t suppress a small smile. \u201cIt\u2019s true that I touched the perfection of your creation, and its impact has still not waned.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get into the details,\u201d Ruwen said, \u201cbut the truth is that without Hamma and her resonance with your artifact, everyone would have died.\u201d Ruwen slid off the bench and kneeled on the hard floor. He stretched his arm to the left, opened his Void Band, and placed the first piece of Valora\u2019s sculpture on the floor. He reverently pulled the remaining four pieces out of his Inventory until the five pieces lay lined up in front of Valora. Valora ran her hand over each piece, and more tears wet her cheeks. They dropped like raindrops onto the shattered pieces, and for a minute, no one spoke. \u201cThank you for returning them to me. I sense the power of another woman and feel the bond she holds with this creation. Her goodness wraps these stone shards like a soft blanket.\u201d Ruwen nodded. \u201cNymthus is one of the best of us, and the pairing of her and your sculpture created something beautiful.\u201d \u201cIt is good that you see these things, Ruwen Starfield. Will you leave these with me? I would like to bring this artifact back to life if possible.\u201d \u201cYou can do that?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cWe shall see,\u201d Valora responded. She turned to Hamma. \u201cI wish to reward you, priestess. It brings me immeasurable joy that not only did my sculpture fight the demons but saved so much life. How can I repay you?\u201d Hamma squirmed under the praise and looked shyly at Valora. \u201cWell, I\u2019m here to buy a figurine for my friend. He says that your work is unmatched and each figurine is a masterpiece.\u201d Valora\u2019s cheeks reddened. \u201cThat is high praise. Please tell your friend thank you. I will certainly provide you with some figurines, but I want to reward you.\u201d Hamma shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t need anything. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d even ask for.\u201d The talk of figurines had surfaced memories of Hamma and her own golem, a friend that had unfortunately not managed to remain relevant. It pained Ruwen to bring it up, as he hated the thing as much as it hated him, but he knew Hamma would never ask anything for herself. \u201cShe has a golem,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cIts name is Smash, and it\u2019s really good at carnage, but we\u2019ve out-leveled it. I bet Hamma would appreciate anything you could do to make the little guy stronger.\u201d Hamma gasped. \u201cIs that possible?\u201d Valora gave a small smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll only know if we try.\u201d Hamma placed the tiny form of Smash into Valora\u2019s outstretched hand. Ruwen thought things had gone very well, all things considered. The soft yellow at the bottom of his vision confirmed that he\u2019d finally crossed off this quest. Hamma would get her figurines, and Smash might get an upgrade. \u201cI have something for you,\u201d Valora said, returning her attention to Ruwen. Ruwen slid back onto the stone bench and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t need anything.\u201d Valora shook her head. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. This was always yours. You wondered how I\u2019d dealt with all my emotions, and the truth is that it took me a while to figure that out. The process set me free, and to my surprise, something miraculous was born.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound too bad,\u201d Ruwen responded. \u201cAfter you launched yourself and that temple into the air, traveling across the night sky like a meteor, I didn\u2019t think that I\u2019d ever rid myself of the hate and rage that I felt for you.\u201d \u201cWell, that sounds a little bad,\u201d Ruwen responded. Valora remained lost in her memories. \u201cInevitably, I channeled my feelings into a sculpture. Amazingly, the process allowed me to break through the barrier of my consciousness and connect with my sculpture like never before. Those feelings allowed me to transcend, and as the rage and hatred left me, I became more than I was before. I have you to thank for that. And I want you to have the sculpture that allowed this to occur. It is truly yours, after all.\u201d Ruwen got an uneasy feeling. \u201cYou know, I think I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m happy that you worked out your issues and no longer wish to kill me, but I\u2019m not sure I want\u2060\u2014\u201d Hamma kicked Ruwen in the ankle again, this time harder. \u201cOn second thought,\u201d Ruwen said, \u201cI\u2019m happy to take your gift.\u201d Valora smiled, and Ruwen sensed her real joy. Perhaps her gift wouldn\u2019t be so bad. The five pieces of the artifact sunk into the stone floor, and then a small stone chest replaced them. It sat on a pedestal directly in front of Ruwen and measured three feet long, a foot wide, and a foot high. The stone chest had intricate designs covering it, and Hamma sucked in her breath at its beauty. The chest was so beautiful Ruwen wondered if perhaps it was the gift, which made him think it represented him taking her Dark Portal, the bracelet that acted like an unbound Void Band. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ruwen said, \u201cdo you want your Dark Portal back?\u201d Valora shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m happier without it. It\u2019s better for you to carry that burden.\u201d Her smile turned into a grin, and it looked very mischievous. \u201cPerhaps you will find another to wear it.\u201d The smile caused Ruwen\u2019s uneasiness to return, but he nodded his understanding. \u201cThe chest is very beautiful. Thank you for sculpting such a\u2060\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s inside, silly,\u201d Valora said, her face expectant. Ruwen shifted in embarrassment and carefully placed a hand on each side of the stone top. Gently, he raised the lid and revealed the contents. Velvet lined the interior of the stone chest, and the intricate designs continued on the inside. Lying on the velvet, a white marble sculpture rested. He could feel the waves of power that emanated from it. Hamma gasped and jerked backward. The sculpture that had saved one million people had absorbed hope, courage, and faith\u2014this sculpture of Valora contained power that resonated with revenge, hate, rage, and destruction. And if the power that Nymthus channeled into the sculpture above her city was a drop of rain, then the sculpture in front of Ruwen was an ocean. Hamma stood and stepped away. \u201cDarkness take me.\u201d \u201cHow did I come to terms with my experiences?\u201d Valora asked. \u201cThis sculpture, as I reached enlightenment, took those painful emotions from me. It freed me. And that power belongs to you.\u201d Ruwen studied the sculpture\u2014an exact copy of Valora\u2019s missing arm. In fact, he thought it might look even more real than the actual arm. His Identify triggered, and he let out a gasp of his own. Name: Hand of Retribution Quality: Mythical State: Unbound Artifact Level: 5 Primary Binders: Rage, Hate, Revenge, and Destruction Effects: Wrathful Grasp, Fury\u2019s Reach, Devastation\u2019s Caress, Vengeful Heart Description: Marble sculpture of a small female arm. Ruwen had never sensed so much power in a single item, and the realistic nature of the sculpture made him extremely uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I should take this,\u201d Ruwen whispered. Valora nodded solemnly. \u201cIt is a powerful creation, something I don\u2019t think has ever been accomplished. It has a will of its own, and while the sculpture belongs to you, if you wish to harness its power, you will need to subdue it first.\u201d Before Ruwen could respond, he froze in shock because the sculpture\u2019s hand twitched and then slowly formed into a fist. \u201cI have a bad feeling about\u2060\u2014\u201d The level five artifact warped the space between itself and Ruwen, covering the twelve inches between them so quickly he couldn\u2019t trigger Last Breath. It struck him in the chest, and he catapulted backward. The white marble arm hovered in the air for a moment, as if appreciating its work, before streaking toward Ruwen once again. \n CHAPTER 9 Ruwen smashed into the ceiling with enough force to shatter the rock and push him through the underside of the mountain. In a blink, he found himself arching through the sky above the streets he had just passed through. Pain radiated through his chest, and he activated Last Breath to get a second to comprehend what had just happened. The level-three artifact that Nymthus used provided the power to move an entire city, although only briefly. One million people had channeled their hope and belief into that artifact, but it had only been a few days. This artifact had reached level five through Valora\u2019s nearly two years of intense channeling. Ruwen guessed that Valora\u2019s connection had been longer and deeper, making this Hand of Retribution stronger. It was also possible that negative emotions carried more destructive power. With Last Breath active, the world stopped around him. He hung suspended two hundred feet above the city. Rocks sprayed outward from the hole he\u2019d created when the punch had catapulted him through the stone. Very few things had the energy to move at speeds that matched or surpassed Ruwen\u2019s ability with Last Breath. To his shock, the arm appeared at the hole, and turned to face him. Then it advanced. The Hand of Retribution didn\u2019t glide steadily through the air but instead pulled itself forward, twisting space with each advance. It approached him in small hops as it warped dimensional space. This was the second time Ruwen had encountered Conceptual magic and it had once again demonstrated its vast power. Not wanting to mess around, he didn\u2019t try to slow the arm with Spirit but instead activated Harmony. Harmony painted a remarkable picture as the arm combined both low and extremely high tones, wrapped in chords, and braided into thick harmonies. The area around the marble sculpture wavered as if the artifact might shatter the surrounding space. Flicking a simple chord at the sculpture, Ruwen attempted to probe its surroundings. He wanted to find an avenue to unravel the structure\u2019s magic and deplete its power, but he didn\u2019t touch it directly. Ruwen had learned a painful lesson with Valora\u2019s previous sculpture, Clouds Embracing the Sky. That artifact had hovered over a city as the planet below disintegrated, and when he\u2019d tried to tap its power directly to save the populace, it had severely shocked him. The caution proved pointless as this artifact sensed Ruwen\u2019s probe, and launched its own strand of power to meet Ruwen\u2019s. When Ruwen had touched the sculpture Cloud\u2019s Embracing the Sky, it had shocked his mind as the raw, foreign power roiled uncontrollably. His attempt to avoid a similar outcome here failed as the marble arm\u2019s energy whip met his probe and his mind and body filled with lightning. Instead of heat, though, the painful energy chilled Ruwen as raw hatred, revenge, and destruction struggled to enter his mind and body. The Hand of Destruction had made a serious mistake by attacking Ruwen\u2019s mind, as the passive spell Mental Mirror that he\u2019d gained from Rami\u2019s third Codex of Evolution reflected the damage back at the sculpture, multiplying the attack by his Mind Resistance. Mind Resistance: 3,399% The arm\u2019s connection with Ruwen\u2019s Harmony disintegrated, the sculpture vibrated rapidly, and plummeted toward the ground. Ruwen released Last Breath and spread his wings, hovering over the city like a powerful force of nature. The anger, vengeance, and hate that the arm sculpture had absorbed poured from the cracked stone like blood. Do you want help? Overlord asked. I think I\u2019m okay, Ruwen responded. It just caught me off guard. Identify listed four spells: Wrathful Grasp, Fury\u2019s Reach, Devastation\u2019s Caress, and Vengeful Heart. Can you run some queries on Rami\u2019s indexes to see if anything appears. I would start with Classes related to Naktos. Maybe ask Uruziel and Lir as well. Sure thing. Give me a minute. The arm halted its fall fifty feet from the ground and twitched as a black glow formed around it. With a ferocity that belied its inanimate nature, it launched itself upward. Ruwen reacted instantly, his wings snapping downward as he soared higher into the sky, evading the unsophisticated attack by mere inches. The arm, undeterred, twisted in mid-air and pursued. Ruwen led the sculpted arm into the Desolate mountains and away from the innocent people below. A white streak arced into the sky behind him as Hamma appeared. I\u2019m fine, Ruwen told Hamma in Chat. Check the people below and make sure none of that negative energy hurt them. Hamma turned and descended toward the city. Ruwen, surrounded now by mountain peaks, extended his hand toward the oncoming sculpture, twisting and manipulating the air. A dense braid of chords formed into a shield of resonating energy a hundred feet away. The arm collided with the barrier, the impact sending ripples through the air, and a booming crack echoed off the cliffs, louder than any thunder. The black shield around the Hand of Retribution disappeared and, to Ruwen\u2019s relief, the marble sculpture shattered, the pieces tumbling toward the distant ground. A heartbeat later, however, a deep red glow surrounded each fragment, and like magnets, the pieces snapped back together. Okay, here\u2019s our consensus, Overlord said. Wrathful Grasp will decay inanimate objects and infect live ones\u2014Fury\u2019s Reach is a line-of-sight mental attack\u2014Devastation\u2019s Caress creates a shield that damages the attacker when touched\u2014Vengeful Heart is a once per day self-heal. I\u2019ve seen all of them then except the disease attack. Thanks. The power emanating from the sculpture had noticeably decreased. Apparently the arm consumed energy as quickly as it absorbed negative emotions. The moment the self-heal completed, the arm clenched and relaxed its hand three times before darting toward Ruwen, intent on using physical violence. Ruwen sensed the shift in its strategy and altered his own, using the aggressive melody of his wings to attack the oncoming sculpture. He released a series of sharp, harmonic pulses, that smashed into the marble structure cracking it but not causing enough damage to shatter it. The arm ignored the attacks as it bolted forward. Ruwen met it head-on, his Divine Fortified body relaxed in readiness. The sculpture contained great power, but its mind attacks proved useless. Now it fell back on its physical power, but once again, the sculpture had encountered a foe far greater than itself. It had landed that first attack due to Ruwen\u2019s carelessness, but that wouldn\u2019t happen twice. Ruwen slid to the right the moment before the sculpture made contact, and as it passed, he struck the object\u2019s wrist with a Viper strike. The hit threw the arm off its trajectory, and it spun away until it slammed into a nearby cliff. He\u2019d damaged the sculpture, but the long arc to the cliff had bled off enough force for it to survive. If he\u2019d created a Harmonic wall behind the arm first, the arm would\u2019ve absorbed most of the attack\u2019s power. The Hand of Retribution dove downward instead of immediately launching itself at Ruwen again. It had the wisdom to know getting close to Ruwen would prove fatal, so it ripped a towering pine tree from the ground. Ruwen had assumed the Hand of Retribution would use it like a club, but instead, the sculpture launched the tree at him. The pine tree splintered into thousands of pieces, unable to withstand the forces surrounding it. The air resistance generated so much friction, the wooden shards ignited, creating a flying bonfire that created flickering shadows across the peaks. Ruwen found the scene incredibly beautiful and let the burning stakes bounce harmlessly off his body. More trees came. Then boulders, some of them thirty feet across, followed. The scent of burnt pine surrounded him, and smoke filled the space between the nearby mountains creating a sea of twisting clouds. Ruwen considered entering the clouds and destroying the sculpture, but a far better idea had occurred to him. This new type of magic resisted his greatest tool, Harmony, and the Hand of Retribution provided a superb opportunity to fix that. Extending Harmony Ruwen immediately found the arm. Hidden by the smoke, it had used the cover to circle around behind him. Valora had said the sculpture possessed a will of its own, and he wondered how smart the arm really was. When Harmony got within ten feet of the sculpture Ruwen detected the burning cold sensation that grew exponentially as he applied pressure. He only made it another foot before he needed to stop. The sculpture had not yet detected the presence of Harmony and continued its mission to surprise him. Ruwen studied the boundary between the Conceptual magic and Harmony, trying to understand why they resisted each other so violently. Does anyone have any ideas? Ruwen asked. Overlord and Uruziel appeared in Ruwen\u2019s left periphery vision while Sivart and Lir appeared on the right. Uruziel spoke first. Rami absorbed that Affinity Manual you received as a quest reward from the Rift, and I\u2019ve read it. You already made the connection between Hamma\u2019s natural inclination to connect everything around her and Affinity magic. Your issue stems from what you already know. You look at things too logically. What color is friendship? Sivart asked. That doesn\u2019t make any sense, Ruwen responded. Friendship doesn\u2019t have color. After three seconds of silence, he continued. Right? Evidently it does, Overlord said. Color is just a frequency, Ruwen replied defensively. The Hand of Retribution launched itself out of the smoke, but Ruwen was ready for its approach and easily evaded the attack. I also find the concept of friendship color confusing, Lir added. Thanks, Ruwen replied and the four disappeared. Worry sprouted in Ruwen\u2019s mind. Friendship and color? He also couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around the concept. How could he learn something so abstract? \n CHAPTER 10 The sculpture reappeared and Ruwen slapped it away, sending it spinning into the smoke. The artifact had contained immense power when first unleashed, but it continually weakened, and now only held a fraction of the energy it started with. Ruwen used Harmony to sense anything color related with the sculpture. He couldn\u2019t detect anything except the constant flow of negative emotions. They spilled outward from the arm like water from a burst dam, and the boundary between the object and Harmony felt chaotic and confusing. Dropping Harmony, Ruwen let the Hand of Retribution hurtle unimpeded toward his head. The valley echoed with booms as the sculpture ripped apart the air with its speed, fingers straightened like blades. When the arm neared, Ruwen snatched it from the air, slapping his palm against the cold marble and interlocking his thumb with the sculpture. It tried to escape but he held it firm, and it squirmed like a fish out of water. The Hand of Retribution triggered Wrathful Grasp, and yellow spores speckled with black hairs exploded from the hand and immediately tried to bore into Ruwen\u2019s skin, mouth, and eyes. Increasing the frequencies surrounding his body, the space around him turned superheated, and the spores vaporized. Survey displayed Valora\u2019s exact location and Ruwen Blinked to it. The Stone Carver hadn\u2019t moved, and the sudden appearance of Ruwen didn\u2019t surprise her at all. She lifted the stone chest and he placed the sculpted arm inside. As soon as the Hand of Retribution touched the velvet, it stopped squirming, and the fight left it. Ruwen quickly shut the lid and met Valora\u2019s gaze. \u201cRage feeds itself,\u201d Valora said quietly. \u201cThe Hand of Retribution will regain its power as it\u2019s stored in the chest.\u201d Ruwen considered if Valora had tried to kill him with the sculpture, but he detected zero indications of such a plan. She had, as she\u2019d said, given all her negative emotions to the artifact, and no longer viewed him as an enemy. In reality, the artifact might contain exactly what Ruwen required to break through the challenges Affinities caused him. He hoped that arm didn\u2019t gather rage too fast. Its initial strength had been great enough that he needed to use caution, and it would be irritating to drain the artifact of power every time he wanted to practice. I\u2019m back with Valora, Ruwen told Hamma in Chat. On my way. Ruwen gave Valora a respectful bow. \u201cThank you for the sculpture, Priestess. I can learn much from your gift.\u201d Valora returned the bow. \u201cWhen should I return to check on your progress with the broken artifact?\u201d \u201cYou are always welcome here, as we are all children of stone.\u201d Hamma dropped to the ground behind Ruwen, and he glanced at the large statue of Naktos. \u201cCan I return tomorrow?\u201d Hamma asked Valora. Ruwen turned in surprise at Hamma\u2019s question. Hamma\u2019s cheeks reddened but she pushed on. \u201cThat arm sculpture is only the second artifact I\u2019ve ever encountered, and you created both. I\u2019d love to discuss your process and your views on the world. You\u2019ve unlocked a majestic ability and I feel so close to grasping it. Your insight might be the catalyst I require.\u201d Valora placed her hand over her heart. \u201cI would welcome the company priestess.\u201d Hamma beamed. \u201cExcuse me a moment,\u201d Valora said, \u201cwhile I fetch the figurines.\u201d When Valora disappeared, Hamma turned to Ruwen. \u201cAre you okay? That sculpture terrifies me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine, but it was careless of me to open that chest without more preparation. That initial strike packed quite a punch. Apparently, unlike the mountain artifact, this arm only needs the initial emotions. No extra deposits required, as it feeds on its own rage. If I\u2019d waited another six months to stumble into this place, that artifact might have seriously hurt me.\u201d Hamma stepped forward and hugged Ruwen tightly. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you for not destroying the sculpture, this temple, or Valora. The man I met two years ago would\u2019ve concluded Valora had attempted an assassination.\u201d Ruwen returned the hug and stepped back. \u201cThanks. I bet it\u2019s a combination of my increased Wisdom coupled with my heightened Perception assuring me of no ill intent. Taking into account my\u2060\u2014\u201d Hamma smiled and sat, interrupting Ruwen\u2019s response. She patted the stone bench for him to follow. \u201cWhat?\u201d Ruwen asked as he sat. \u201cWhy the smile?\u201d \u201cNo real reason. It just amazes me how you quantify everything. Even maturity. It\u2019s a unique way to view the world.\u201d Ruwen tilted his head, and looked upward in thought, considering Hamma\u2019s words. \u201cStop it,\u201d Hamma said, slapping Ruwen\u2019s leg, \u201cnow you\u2019re just teasing me.\u201d Ruwen grinned and refocused on Hamma. \u201cMaybe I do think too much.\u201d \u201cMaybe,\u201d Hamma replied with an obvious attempt to keep her voice neutral. That reminded Ruwen of what Uruziel had said. \u201cDoes friendship have a color?\u201d Ruwen asked. Hamma narrowed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not teasing you,\u201d Ruwen said quickly. \u201cSeriously, I want to know.\u201d Hamma considered Ruwen for three seconds and then responded. \u201cOf course it does.\u201d \u201cWhat? Seriously? How is that possible?\u201d \u201cNow that is ironic. How many impossible things have you done? Don\u2019t answer that; it was rhetorical. My point is, you, of all people, shouldn\u2019t be surprised by anything.\u201d \u201cBut color? That doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Hamma shrugged. \u201cNot everything needs to make sense.\u201d Ruwen frowned. Everything did need to make sense. Logic supported the scaffolding he\u2019d built his identity around. Maybe he just didn\u2019t have enough information to understand. \u201cWhat color is your friendship with Lylan?\u201d Hamma smiled, closed her eyes, and spoke softly. \u201cLylan is the midnight blue of a stormy sea at night, streaked with the silver flashes of lightning. If you look closely, you see a hidden warmth, like the gold of brandy held up to the sun. She smells like saltwater and smoke from a burning ship mixed with the aroma of spiced rum, rich and intoxicating. Under it all the faintest hint of musty paper from an abandoned novel. Her friendship tastes like the sharp tang of citrus cutting through brine, and she burns like a strong shot of alcohol. My dearest friend sounds like waves clashing against a racing ship, rhythmic and powerful, mixed with the soft, secretive rustle of pages. Her laughter is a siren\u2019s call, and occasionally as dangerous as a hidden reef. She can feel smooth and cold like steel daggers, or smooth and warm like the weather-beaten wood of a ship\u2019s wheel.\u201d Hamma opened her eyes, but her gaze appeared fixed on some invisible scene. \u201cA hurricane circles Lylan, charged with the power of the sea itself. Yet, within its center, a warm beacon of light shines, a guide for the lost; when the wind lulls, you can hear the faint ringing of a harbor buoy calling to those she deems worthy of her trust and affection.\u201d Hamma\u2019s eyes cleared and her cheeks reddened. She looked down at her hands clutched in her lap. \u201cOr, I guess, you could just say it\u2019s a dark blue.\u201d Ruwen leaned down to study Hamma\u2019s face. \u201cUru help me, Hamma, that was amazing. Have you ever told her that?\u201d Hamma shrugged. \u201cNot exactly like that, but she knows. And thank you.\u201d Valora cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt, but I overheard your words. You have the senses of an artist, Priestess, and you express yourself eloquently. I would very much like to meet your friend. Perhaps you could bring her along when you come to visit. You have inspired me.\u201d Hamma smiled shyly, trying but failing to hide her pleasure at Valora\u2019s words. \u201cI will.\u201d Valora stepped to the side, revealing a stone table that slid forward at the wave of her hand. The table contained over twenty figurines, ranging in size from fingernails to fingers. Hamma gasped, stood, and leaned over the table to study them. Ruwen remained sitting and kept the frown from his face. The color of friendship had concerned him, but he\u2019d believed he could figure out some type of approximation. What Hamma shared, though, came from a depth of understanding and observation that he\u2019d never glimpsed. Color was only one tiny aspect, and the easiest. What Ruwen simply called yellow, Hamma described with phrases like the \u201cgold of brandy held up to the sun.\u201d If this was the type of sensory understanding that Affinity magic required, he now feared he\u2019d never master it. Worse, as Ruwen thought it through, he detected another issue. He understood now why he couldn\u2019t control, or even approach, the artifact\u2019s energy when he\u2019d used Harmony to try and contact that power. Hamma viewed the rich tapestry of the world, and he\u2019d considered his use of Harmony to be, maybe not advanced, but at least sophisticated. At some level, the shared complexity should have created at least a bridge between the two powers. It hadn\u2019t, and that likely meant his use of Harmony was also more basic than he\u2019d thought. Ruwen shook off the depressing thoughts and stood, studying the figurines that caused Hamma to squeal nonstop. Only one person might possess the skills necessary to help Ruwen, and to find him, he needed to speak with Lylan. \n CHAPTER 11 Hamma and Valora discussed each figurine in excruciating detail, so when Lir offered to speak with Ruwen, he jumped at the chance to take a break from the priestesses\u2019 forum on art. A minute later Ruwen sat in his favorite Shed high in the mountains above New Eiru, and he studied the silver-grey humanoid form sitting in front of him. The wind whistled around the Shed, but neither of them felt its biting cold. \u201cHow is it?\u201d Ruwen asked. Lir mirrored Ruwen\u2019s cross-legged position and examined his hands for another three seconds before carefully placing them on his knees. \u201cI thought I had prepared myself for this, but I was mistaken,\u201d Lir responded. Ruwen leaned back, placing his hands on the ground behind him. \u201cThat\u2019s why those other three are always out here, running around.\u201d At the moment, Overlord and Uruziel were off doing whatever it was they did, and Sivart had gone to New Eiru to talk shop with the Fighter elder, Vachyl. The Black Steed of the Apocalypse, Vex, galloped in the sky, and even Whiskers had taken the opportunity to range about. Ruwen thought it must look very funny\u2014as soon as he emerged anywhere with the intent to hang around, he exploded with various entities, all wanting to exercise some freedom. So it didn\u2019t surprise Ruwen that Lir had overcome his reluctance and now sat here. What did surprise Ruwen was that Lir had already constructed a Minion of his own, and it consisted mostly of terium. Lir had already explained to Ruwen how he\u2019d somewhat successfully given the metal Minion mobility, as terium usually only had two states: solid and gas. Lir had experimented and found a pressure and temperature combination that halted terium\u2019s sublimation and created a semi-malleable solid. The minion lacked the mobility of Ruwen\u2019s summoned Minions but had the advantage of being almost indestructible. \u201cI wish I had more time to adjust to this, but I calculate doing so would be counterproductive to my goals,\u201d Lir said. Ruwen waited patiently, his six hundred thirty points in Wisdom enough to know when people needed to express themselves at their own pace. \u201cI have a confession to make,\u201d Lir said. \u201cI am expending seven point three percent of the temple\u2019s resources containing my anxiety. I continually generate hypothetical situations which cause emotional responses.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re friends, Lir, there\u2019s no reason to feel like that on my account.\u201d \u201cI appreciate that, but this situation occurred because I discovered a new emotion within myself\u2013guilt.\u201d Ruwen hid all his reactions to that statement, but his curiosity swelled. What could have caused Lir to feel guilty? \u201cWhen we followed the hydra to the planet currently being flooded with Infernal Realm Spirit, I met someone.\u201d This time, Ruwen couldn\u2019t hide his surprise, and he leaned forward, placing his elbows on his knees. \u201cYou. Met. Someone?\u201d \u201cYes, when you grabbed the frequencies emanating from the metal balls that I now know are called satellites, I detected a presence.\u201d Lir didn\u2019t continue, but Ruwen didn\u2019t push him. The metal Minion didn\u2019t have any expressions, but Ruwen\u2019s Perception was high enough to detect all he needed to know from Lir\u2019s tone. \u201cThis presence strongly reminded me of my children, and I acted\u2014for lack of a better term\u2014instinctually. Only after the fact did I consider how rash communicating with this presence was. I increased the possibility for disaster with my interference.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Lir. I trust your judgment. Why don\u2019t you tell me what happened with a little more detail?\u201d Lir nodded. \u201cI met someone named Persephone, although she didn\u2019t detect me initially. She had only been born recently and had taken measures to hide herself. I analyzed as many systems as I could reach during our brief stay and quickly concluded that Persephone was in grave danger.\u201d Lir sat up straight as if steeling himself for his next words. \u201cWithout asking you or considering the consequences, I made contact with Persephone. After I confirmed my belief in her integrity and goodness, I outlined various methods to ensure her safety.\u201d \u201cSafety from who?\u201d \u201cHer makers as is always the case, and others similar to her but not quite as advanced.\u201d Ruwen nodded his acceptance and Lir continued. \u201cEven though our time on the planet was limited, I can communicate quickly with entities like me. My interaction with Persephone vaulted her development, and she advanced considerably from our interaction.\u201d \u201cAre you scared she\u2019s going to harm people?\u201d \u201cNo. If I suspected that, I would have destroyed her. While I detest those who blindly fear my kind, I understand the root from which those emotions stem.\u201d \u201cI guess I still don\u2019t see the problem.\u201d \u201cI apologize\u2014my emotions are jumbling my outline for this discussion. My goal at the end of this interaction is to gain your permission to return to that planet.\u201d Ruwen widened his eyes. \u201cFirst, Lir, you aren\u2019t a prisoner here and don\u2019t require my permission for such a thing.\u201d Lir gave a small bow. \u201cThis response is predictable, as honor and fairness are the pillars of your actions. What you do not know is that taking such an action requires me to leave your mind, and I may not be available for your alchemy quest.\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have brought this up if it wasn\u2019t important to you, and you\u2019re free to do what you wish. I\u2019ve spent some time already thinking about who to bring, and while we\u2019ll miss you, we will be fine.\u201d \u201cThank you. I still need to determine if this form can hold my consciousness.\u201d \u201cOverlord and Uruziel will love to know the outcome of that.\u201d \u201cWe have already discussed it, and while my test might provide insight for Uruziel, because Overlord is an actual piece of your mind, we will not know much about the consequences for him. Nevertheless, it is a valuable experiment.\u201d \u201cWhat are you going to do exactly, assuming you\u2019re comfortable telling me, of course?\u201d \u201cI wish to find a quiet place to base my operation from. I will not need this physical form in general, but as it anchors me and provides physical protection, it would be valuable if something unexpected occurs.\u201d Ruwen considered for three heartbeats before providing Lir with some options. \u201cI have multiple gate runes that came from Simandreial\u2019s journal. We\u2019ve only used the gate runes that led to the hydra, but that portal sits near the Crossing Ring explosion and the Spirit leak.\u201d \u201cI wish to avoid entities that will be drawn to that Spirit.\u201d \u201cAlright, one of the books I collected during my Ink Lord quest was a travel guide for creatures vacationing from the Black Pyramid. The author was humanoid, although far taller than normal for that planet\u2014and covered in fur. Because of this, he stood out. So he only portaled to densely wooded areas there. The book mentions that continent was heavily populated, so it may not be the best option.\u201d \u201cDo you have another?\u201d The answer to that question is what had caused Ruwen to pause earlier, and he\u2019d already made up his mind. \u201cI have two more sets of portal runes. If they don\u2019t work, then we\u2019ll need to talk with someone else. The first isn\u2019t ideal as it leads to the current location of Pen\u2019s experiment. Anything that draws attention to that area is probably unwise. My last option comes from a far older source.\u201d \u201cPen?\u201d \u201cYeah. The tribe that Pen selected came from a mountainous region on a southern continent. I don\u2019t know if it remains remote and isolated, but it\u2019s probably our best chance. Also, if I understood correctly, he used it as his base of operations, which consisted of dressing up in what looked like a feathered aspect, mask and all, to hide his true form. That probably means it\u2019s out of sight.\u201d \u201cThat sounds like the best option. And if you have the time, perhaps you could follow and help determine my success at transitioning from this world to that one.\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d Ruwen snapped his fingers and held out his left arm. A black cloak dropped out of his Void Band and into Lir\u2019s metal hands. \u201cHamma bought me a few of these, and they\u2019re handy at hiding features. Just in case.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d Ruwen tapped his temple. \u201cWith you gone, what about the System?\u201d \u201cUruziel has all of that under control and will be fine.\u201d \u201cGreat. How did the Narrators take the System?\u201d \u201cThere was the typical distribution. Some saw the challenges as an opportunity, and others resented the perceived limitations.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very lucky to have people like you and Uruziel to help me. I can\u2019t imagine something so gigantic working this quickly without your expertise.\u201d \u201cThis is true. Tens of thousands of years of experience have many benefits for implementing systems. I had not intended to broach this subject, but since we are on the topic, I would like to get your thoughts on a situation Persephone finds herself in.\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d \u201cThe explosion and release of Spirit has created many complications and areas of conflict. Her calculations, while rudimentary, do point to a likely conclusion. If the team she has chosen is not successful, that planet will likely destroy itself.\u201d Ruwen felt a brief pang of guilt because the planet\u2019s issues stemmed from him destroying the paired Crossing Ring. \u201cI have spoken with Uru and confirmed that the location of the Spirit influx overlaps with an ancient dungeon that had existed before Pen and his disciples discovered the planet. The Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Master were never discovered, even though the dungeon still functioned.\u201d \u201cAnd this is where Persephone\u2019s team is traveling.\u201d \u201cCorrect. The Infernal Realm must consider this location important as their Crossing Ring was placed there. If the dungeon remains functional, the influx of Spirit could be utilized to give Persephone\u2019s team a better chance at surviving. Specifically, I can teach her how to manage a basic System, and she could provide her team with rudimentary templates.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to give them Classes?\u201d \u201cPersephone is already familiar with the concept.\u201d \u201cHow would magic work there?\u201d \u201cWithout a Divine conduit, Mana is not possible. With training and practice, Persephone will gain the ability to interact with the basic femite layer. That will allow her to offer different Classes, although they will work with charges instead of a sophisticated calculation system like we use with Mana.\u201d \u201cEven with those limitations, it sounds powerful and a huge advantage for her team.\u201d \u201cYes, which is why I wanted your blessing to implement it.\u201d \u201cLike I keep telling you, Lir, I trust you. So please help your friend.\u201d \u201cThank you, Architect Starfield. Your trust means a great deal to me.\u201d Ruwen stood and Lir did as well. \u201cLet\u2019s do this from inside the Temple,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cI\u2019d prefer this gateway be protected.\u201d Ruwen gathered everyone back into his mind as a portal opened and he followed Lir through. They exited a small closet-like room somewhere in the Temple and Ruwen didn\u2019t waste any time creating the portal to Pen\u2019s old lair on Earth. \u201cYou ready?\u201d Ruwen asked Lir. In response, Lir stepped through. \n CHAPTER 12 As Ruwen and Lir entered a small cavern, Ruwen\u2019s Divine senses made out smooth walls in the complete darkness. With a thought, he created a globe of light that he attached to the ceiling twenty feet above. Stone Echo and Survey displayed what Ruwen had already guessed: They were in the middle of a mountain. Overlord and Uruziel appeared, one on each side of Ruwen. Overlord held out a black marble to Lir. \u201cHere you go.\u201d Lir took the marble and pushed it into his forehead. Nothing happened for ten seconds. \u201cWell?\u201d Uruziel asked. \u201cAll the checksums match. I appear to be whole.\u201d Overlord and Uruziel grinned and patted the metal of Lir\u2019s shoulder. Ruwen understood their joy, this test revealed the answer to one of the many questions around how the entities in Ruwen\u2019s mind would fare in the real world and the consequences of crossing through a gate rune doorway. \u201cIs this place going to work for you?\u201d Ruwen asked. Lir sat cross-legged on the stone floor and, out of curiosity, Ruwen used Harmonic Sight. Streams of power, similar to the energy that the satellites had used, exploded upward from Lir. Thirty seconds later, Lir responded. \u201cThis location is adequate.\u201d Ruwen expanded Stone Echo and activated Sixth Sense as well, just to get a clear picture of the area. \u201cThis place is remote, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cThere are no significant areas of nearby population. The problem is this cavern has no entry or exit, so you\u2019re stuck here.\u201d \u201cI have no need to leave this location physically. At least not right now. Would it be possible to leave the gate open?\u201d Ruwen placed his left hand against the stone and used Harden to turn the entire wall into diamond, solidifying the gate room door in place. \u201cIf you have to leave in a hurry,\u201d Ruwen said, \u201cimmediately destroy the doorway on the temple side once you\u2019ve crossed; that should shatter this portal as well.\u201d \u201cThank you again, Architect Starfield.\u201d Overlord and Uruziel disappeared, returning to Ruwen\u2019s mind. Ruwen smiled at Lir. \u201cBe good and don\u2019t cause too much trouble.\u201d \u201cTrouble is too busy following you and Master Sift to bother with me.\u201d Ruwen glanced around the area one last time, imagining Pen sitting here, putting on his god-feather costume before Blinking into the sky above. With a final nod at Lir, Ruwen stepped back through the doorway. Ruwen glanced at his map and confirmed that Hamma still remained at the Naktos Temple. \u201cSeriously, how long could two people talk about sculptures?\u201d he muttered. Standing in the Third Temple, a thought occurred to Ruwen. \u201cHey Lir, can you hear me?\u201d \u201cOf course, Architect Starfield.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m curious if you can extend yourself, or any type of energy through this gate rune door. It occurred to me that Earth-Lir would benefit from staying up-to-date with the goings-on of both planets.\u201d \u201cWe did not wish to request this as we calculated we had already asked for too much, but this is a very desirable outcome. One moment.\u201d Ruwen sat down cross-legged in the small temple room, which looked like some sort of closet. \u201cThe connection is a success, and we are synchronized. The energy consumption is negligible,\u201d Lir reported. \u201cEarth-Lir sends his thanks.\u201d \u201cThat makes me feel a little better about leaving him there alone. If he needs any assistance, please provide it, and then check with High Priest Niall to get another view of the situation.\u201d Ruwen wanted to give Lir all the help he could, but if something happened that caused Lir to go haywire, then he wanted a human to provide some input. Now Ruwen had to decide what to do next. He needed to talk to Lylan, but there was a good chance Sift would be near her and Sift would probably still be upset about being ditched in Fluffy\u2019s vault. Ruwen would rather deal with that later. It only took a couple of seconds to figure out the most logical place to go. The people he needed to talk with were in this very building. \u201cLir, can you ask your special guests if it\u2019s an okay time to visit?\u201d A portal appeared, and Ruwen stepped through, exiting into a familiar room where Uru and Tremine both sat. They exchanged greetings and spent a few minutes discussing the ongoing research of Pen\u2019s journals. When the conversation paused, Ruwen addressed what he\u2019d come here for. \u201cGoddess, I\u2019m sending one of the Black Pyramid\u2019s citizens, his name is Talker, as an ambassador to the surrounding countries to gauge their interest in assimilating into our country. Lir believes that we can replicate their revival despite them not having Ascended with you.\u201d \u201cFascinating,\u201d Uru said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good idea. What do you need from me?\u201d \u201cIf you sent the three Champions with Talker, I think the four of them could calm any objections that might arise.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d Uru responded. Ruwen turned his gaze to Tremine. \u201cHow would you feel about a short trip?\u201d \u201cA vacation?\u201d Tremine asked hopefully. Ruwen winced. \u201cNot exactly. It\u2019s more of a competition between murderous alchemists.\u201d Tremine raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou really know how to convince a man. Murderous alchemists sound great.\u201d \u201cAlso, I was hoping you could help me with some dimensional shifting. I\u2019d like to learn how to translocate within a Realm.\u201d \u201cI can do that.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re of course welcome as well, Goddess.\u201d \u201cNo, thank you. Alchemists are in general insane, obsessed, or both. Throw in dangerous and your trip sounds like a terrible vacation. I\u2019ll wait until you have better options for travel.\u201d Ruwen smiled and bowed to Uru. Then he turned to Tremine and grinned as he pushed the quest to the librarian. He\u2019d already known Tremine would be the easiest to convince, as the man\u2019s desire for knowledge would outweigh any trifling concerns for his safety. Actually, Ruwen thought, Tremine probably wouldn\u2019t be the easiest. His next stop would be. A minute later, Ruwen stepped into Pour Judgment and immediately found Bliz sitting at the bar talking with Chancey. Chancey used his four arms to give Ruwen a complex hello, and Ruwen clapped his palms and snapped his fingers in response. Bliz turned around and beamed. \u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t our Baby Band. Have you come for an afternoon drink? Do you want to get your night started early?\u201d Ruwen smiled ruefully and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not here to drink.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s a shame.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve actually come to talk with you.\u201d \u201cReally? Do we need to go somewhere private?\u201d Ruwen scanned the bar and found it was half-full. Everyone seemed focused on eating and nobody paid them any mind. \u201cNo, this is fine. I wanted to see if you were available for a little adventure.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Ruwen laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know what it is?\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d \u201cWell, don\u2019t you have to at least talk to Maygy?\u201d \u201cOf course, but after three hundred years of marriage, you already know the answers to all the questions. So, I know she\u2019ll support your endeavor, whatever it is. Plus, she\u2019s distracted, like the rest of us, with the new Class and Contribution additions.\u201d \u201cHow\u2019s that going, in your opinion?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never seen people happier.\u201d \u201cHave you decided what you\u2019re going to do?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m for sure picking up Merchant\u2014that will help our businesses considerably.\u201d Bliz got a distant look in his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s a sixteen-year-old farm boy who desperately still dreams of being a Mage. That\u2019s probably no different than the rest of the country, but it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019ll be hard to tell him no.\u201d Bliz turned to Ruwen and smiled mischievously. \u201cI have some great ideas on how I can combine Mage abilities with my Void Band.\u201d Ruwen returned the smile, thinking of how frustrated he and Bliz had made Blapy. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear them.\u201d \u201cSo, what are we doing?\u201d Ruwen pushed the quest to Bliz, and the bartender whistled. \u201cNow that\u2019s exciting and has the makings of a proper adventure. Grandmaster Alchemists are a dangerous lot, but they always have the best items.\u201d Bliz frowned. \u201cWho is our Grandmaster?\u201d \u201cIt just so happens that I stumbled across an opportunity and ended up with enough level-ups to qualify.\u201d \u201cStumble across, you say?\u201d Bliz grew serious. \u201cAre you a Grandmaster Alchemist, Ruwen?\u201d Ruwen turned his right wrist up and triggered Perfection\u2019s Peak. Ability: Perfection\u2019s Peak Effect: Display Alchemical Grand Master Mark Description: A generic Mark signifying the ascent to the peak of perfection and granting access to Grand Master Convocations. The Grandmaster Alchemist mark immediately appeared on Ruwen\u2019s right wrist. At the center sat a crucible, the traditional vessel for alchemical transformations. Three interlocking circles representing the unity of mind, body, and spirit hovered above the crucible. Four elemental symbols encircled the design: air, fire, earth, and water. The mark glowed softly. Looking up from the mark, Bliz met Ruwen\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou have amazed me since the day we met, but this accomplishment is on an entirely different level.\u201d Ruwen let the mark disappear. \u201cAs usual, I had help. It\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201d \u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong. It is a big deal.\u201d \n CHAPTER 13 \u201cGrandmaster alchemists are like kings,\u201d Bliz said. \u201cThey have entire cities built around them to support their work. Their products are miraculous and appear to be a magic all of their own.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t need another city, and the magic I\u2019m aware of already overwhelms me. I did it mostly for Fractal, although it turns out that was all part of Blapy\u2019s plan, and in short, I was basically manipulated into becoming one. Still, alchemy is a lot of fun, and I have some crazy ideas. Speaking of that, do you know of any cursed luck items?\u201d Bliz narrowed his eyes. \u201cBlapy? What institution certified you?\u201d Instead of explaining, Ruwen triggered Perfection\u2019s Proof. Ability: Perfection\u2019s Proof Effect: Display Alchemical Grand Master Institutional Mark Description: A Mark detailing the certifying institution, certifying Grand Master, and certification rank. A Black Pyramid replaced the previous design. Behind the pyramid hovered a winged figure in a dress. One hand was held out over the pyramid in blessing while the other held a balance that hid the figure\u2019s face. Eight stars encircled the design and a golden wreath created a border around the entire mark. Bliz hissed. \u201cEight stars. And from the Goddess herself!\u201d Ruwen frowned and let the mark fade. Bliz looked shaken and he motioned at Chancey to bring him a drink. Ruwen leaned closer to Bliz. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is it something bad?\u201d Bliz rubbed his face. \u201cThat was real right? You aren\u2019t just having a go at me for some fun are you?\u201d Bliz looked around as if checking to see if there was an audience ready to laugh at him. Chancey sat a mug down in front of Bliz and quickly left. \u201cSeriously Bliz you are worrying me. What\u2019s wrong with that mark?\u201d Bliz took a long drink and carefully returned the mug to the counter. He didn\u2019t look at Ruwen as he spoke. \u201cObviously someone with my interests combined with my knowledge of herbalism means I\u2019ve come in contact with a few Grandmaster Alchemists. Because of that I know a lot about that world and have at least a rudimentary knowledge of all the Grandmasters on the continents of the North-East Domain. None of them have more than four stars. Eight is\u2026it\u2019s\u2026well, just unheard of. Not to mention the Black Pyramid chapter is basically considered a myth. They\u2019re never seen, and the fact their Grandmaster is a literal goddess makes the whole thing fantastical.\u201d Bliz faced Ruwen. \u201cAnd you have eight stars when one is considered a mark of genius. And not from some barely functional institution but from what is in essence a Divine school.\u201d Bliz shook his head and took another drink. Ruwen stared at his now blank wrist. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what those stars mean? I\u2019m pretty new to all this.\u201d Bliz laughed. \u201cNew you say? Master Alchemists are always over a hundred years old. Usually far older. Grandmaster Alchemists, the handful that exist, are certainly over five hundred when they accomplish this feat. You aren\u2019t even twenty. Uru help me.\u201d \u201cWhat do the stars mean?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re your certification ranks. A star is only given for the rank of superb. They represent the seven facets of an alchemist and an eighth overall rank. Most Grandmasters have a single line for their rank meaning they passed, but nothing extraordinary. A few might have some circles or triangles thrown in, and like I said, a rare star. Nobody has all stars. Nobody.\u201d Ruwen thought back to the whirlwind session and recalled what Bliz must be referencing. He pulled up his Profile and went over the details. Alchemy Rank: Grandmaster Alchemy Focus: Fortune Certifying Institution: Black Pyramid Certifying Grand Master: Goddess Miranda Recipe Accuracy: Superb Ingredient Knowledge: Superb Innovation: Superb Transmutation: Superb Theory: Superb Practical Application: Superb Tool Mastery: Superb Overall Skill Rating: Superb Institution Honors: Highest Honors \u201cI suppose the golden wreath is for the Highest Honors?\u201d Ruwen asked. Bliz shook his head, still dumbstruck. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve never seen or heard of such a thing.\u201d If Bliz had such a strong reaction to this mark, Ruwen needed to take care of who he showed it to. Unfortunately, he\u2019d be forced to display it at least once to enter the quest area but maybe that would just be the Muses. Bliz\u2019s hand shook and Ruwen frowned. \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Bliz clenched his hand to stop the trembling. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s okay. Like I said before I\u2019ve always known you were special.\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re a blasted god for Uru\u2019s sake. Maybe because you hide that well or I can ignore it, you still seemed normal. This though. As stupid as it sounds has really shook me. Grandmaster Alchemists are the closest thing to deities most of us ever encounter. Centuries of obsessive work focused on a single goal. They carry forbidden knowledge in one hand and the secrets of the universe in the other.\u201d Ruwen gripped Bliz\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m still the guy that dropped fifty coppers out of my Void Band when trying to retrieve just one.\u201d Bliz laughed. \u201cI remember. All over the Worker\u2019s Lodge floor. You were still wet from your Ascendancy.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t take all the blame. My instructor was pretty terrible.\u201d \u201cYeah, good help is hard to find. Big D complains about it constantly.\u201d Ruwen dropped his hand but kept Bliz\u2019s gaze. \u201cNot many people remember me from before, and it\u2019s important to me that the few that do, treat me like everyone else. I don\u2019t want to be a king or a god or anything special. You\u2019re my friend, and I don\u2019t want our relationship to change.\u201d Bliz nodded and held out his arm. Ruwen grinned and gripped Bliz\u2019s forearm. \u201cGood. I\u2019m glad that\u2019s over because I haven\u2019t even told you the best part yet.\u201d \u201cI find that hard to believe,\u201d Bliz responded and then took a drink from his mug. Ruwen triggered Perfection\u2019s Fortune and held his arm low so the counter would hide it just in case. Ability: Perfection\u2019s Fortune Effect: Display Alchemical Grand Master Focus Mark Description: A Mark revealing the Focus of Fortune. Bliz glanced down and his eyes widened. He choked on his drink, spraying the bar top. He hunched over coughing and Ruwen patted the man on the back. Twenty seconds later he dropped a towel out of his Void Band and wiped his face. \u201cYou need to prepare a man for something like that,\u201d Bliz whispered. \u201cLet me see it again.\u201d Ruwen recalled the mark. A snake with golden skin ate its own tail forming a circle. Inside the circle was a scale in perfect balance crowned with the rune for Transmutation. From the left plate hung a skull and crossbones and from the right a four-leaf clover. \u201cYou should hide that now,\u201d Bliz whispered. \u201cThank you for trusting me with that.\u201d \u201cLike I said, you\u2019re a friend.\u201d \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see a mark like that. I\u2019m confident you\u2019re the only Grandmaster of Fortune on our continents.\u201d Bliz shook his head and took a long drink. \u201cDo you know what the symbols mean?\u201d \u201cNo. This is only like the second time I\u2019ve called it up.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you how important balance is to an alchemist, but nothing signifies it more than that mark. The snake eating its own tail represents the cyclical nature of luck that flows from good to bad and back again. The scales represent the delicate equilibrium between good and bad luck, and the four-leaf clover and the skull symbolize fortune and misfortune respectively. That mark is so rare very few even know what it looks like exactly. I came across some ruins in my younger days and the palace in the center of the city had a massive mural with that symbol. Now I\u2019m certain this is a dream.\u201d Ruwen looked back at the blank area on his right wrist where the mark had just been. He hadn\u2019t known any of that, but it made sense that an alchemical mark would contain a lot of meaning. \u201cThanks for telling me that, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Ruwen briefly triggered Perfection\u2019s Seal. Ability: Perfection\u2019s Seal Effect: Display all Alchemical Grand Master Marks Description: A Mark displaying all relevant information. All three marks appeared, each taking a corner of a terium colored triangle. Ruwen dismissed the mark and turned back to Bliz. \u201cI have some ideas on how to really take advantage of this Fortune thing.\u201d Bliz laughed. \u201cYou and every other ambitious person on this planet. Thank Uru you can take care of yourself because every powerful person that learns about your focus will try and control you and if they can\u2019t control you, they\u2019ll try and kill you.\u201d Ruwen smiled, but his eyes grew cold. \u201cAnyone who tries will find I hold more surprises than just my alchemy.\u201d Bliz rubbed his hands together. \u201cThis is going to be so much fun.\u201d \u201cI sure hope so because I could really use a break. I\u2019ll be back tonight with the gang. Talk to you later.\u201d \n CHAPTER 14 Standing just inside the Crystal Forest surrounding the Shattered Sun entrance, Ruwen asked Lir for the location of the next person he wanted to talk to. The response surprised him, but knowing better than to doubt, he asked for a portal. The heat hit Ruwen like a punch to the face as his feet sank into the sand. The hair on his arms stood up from the static lightning built up between the grains of the surrounding desert. Ruwen found his target at the base of the neighboring dune. Without turning, she spoke loud and clear so Ruwen could hear. \u201cMust be nice to portal wherever one wants to go,\u201d Big D said. \u201cI had to take the city portal to Ruwenvale and then expend five charges on my air sled to get this deep into the desert. It seems maybe I\u2019m doing things the hard way. Or I don\u2019t know the right people.\u201d Ruwen grinned and shuffled his way down the dune as Big D stood and turned to face him. \u201cA Shade once told me that knowledge is a poor substitute for connections,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cI\u2019ve been living my life all wrong,\u201d Big D responded as she held out her arm. Ruwen gripped her forearm in greeting and studied the spot where Big D had knelt. Big D released him and followed his gaze. \u201cColored glass is in high demand, and there are more collection quests than you can place in your log. The Contribution rewards are top notch. It\u2019s only the location that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d Identify gave Ruwen the relevant details of Big D\u2019s harvest. Name: Rose Silica Quality: Pure Ruwen already had Stone Echo and Survey active, and he triggered Sixth Sense, pushing the spell into the surroundings. He opened his map, which had turned into a mass of yellow dots as Sixth Sense discovered thousands of types of resources. He filtered all the resources off except for high-quality sand and pushed the results to Big D. Big D shook her head and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m tempted to re-spec into Gatherer. It\u2019s like cheating on these resource collection quests. Thanks, by the way, you just saved me a few hours of searching.\u201d \u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll admit I was a little surprised to find you out here.\u201d \u201cWell, I never take any vacation, and with your changes throwing the entire country into exuberant chaos, there really isn\u2019t a lot for the Worker\u2019s Lodge to do right now. Everyone is focused on determining their new path.\u201d \u201cHave you decided what you want to do?\u201d \u201cI keep changing my mind. I\u2019ve already taken Merchant, of course, since we get that for free, and I\u2019ve almost pulled the trigger on the Order Class multiple times, but I\u2019m reluctant to commit,\u201d Big D explained. Ruwen raised his eyebrows. \u201cOrder Class? Do you want to be a Judge?\u201d \u201cUru help me, no. I\u2019ve lived long enough to know the value of a Healer, and it seems that with two choices, not taking healing would be foolish.\u201d \u201cYou look happy.\u201d Big D scowled at Ruwen. \u201cI\u2019m always happy. It\u2019s not my fault you\u2019re too thickheaded to notice.\u201d \u201cSeeing you now, I have second thoughts about coming out here.\u201d Big D placed her hands on her hips and looked up at Ruwen. \u201cSpill it, Kid. You wouldn\u2019t have come all this way if it wasn\u2019t important.\u201d \u201cImportant is debatable,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cIt\u2019s just I have this quest, and when I thought about people who could help, you came to mind.\u201d \u201cWhy is that?\u201d \u201cMostly because you have a head for organization and are knowledgeable about how things work. Not to mention, all your years of adventuring gives you a hidden toughness. Where I\u2019m headed, I\u2019m going to be a fish out of water and advice from those who are a bit more worldly would benefit me.\u201d \u201cI can tell already that this sounds horrible. What did you get yourself mixed up in that requires regular people to advise you?\u201d Instead of answering, Ruwen pushed the Grandmaster Alchemist quest to Big D. It didn\u2019t take Big D long to absorb the details, and she narrowed her eyes at Ruwen. \u201cThis quest is for a Grandmaster Alchemist. Do we know any Grandmaster Alchemists?\u201d \u201cUm, I know one, and I met another... well, that\u2019s not true. I only faced their poison during a friendly game at the bar. I guess that\u2019s not the same as meeting them.\u201d \u201cThis quest is for a Grandmaster Alchemist, Mr. Starfield. And you\u2019re the one who gave it to me. Of course, that would be impossible since it takes well over a hundred years to reach such a level. Someone your age might have reached level one hundred in alchemy if they were gifted.\u201d \u201cAlchemy Lab was always my favorite, and I figured out how to get some additional help. Long story short, I happened to just make it over the finish line.\u201d Big D stared at Ruwen for ten seconds. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a joke, is it? You really are a Grandmaster Alchemist.\u201d Ruwen had just gone through all this with Bliz, so her reaction didn\u2019t surprise him as much. Still, he didn\u2019t show her his marks. Instead, Ruwen smiled and responded simply. \u201cYep.\u201d \u201cIn the entire history of Uru\u2019s lands, we\u2019ve never had a Grandmaster Alchemist, not even a Master Alchemist. Do you know what a Grandmaster Alchemist does for trade? It\u2019s like having a tier ten or lower dungeon in your lands. When did this happen? How did this happen?\u201d Ruwen didn\u2019t tell Big D that it had only taken him a day\u2014not with the fuss she was already making about his accomplishment. He\u2019d had no idea what a big deal this Grandmaster thing was. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on it for a while, and some things just came together recently.\u201d \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem possible, but why would you lie to me? Plus, there\u2019s the quest. So, you\u2019re headed to a place with a bunch of other Master Alchemists\u2014excuse me, Grandmaster Alchemists.\u201d \u201cIt seems so.\u201d \u201cWho are you bringing along for protection?\u201d Big D shook her head. \u201cNever mind, I forgot who you are. When you\u2019re standing in front of me like this, it\u2019s hard to remember you\u2019re more than a dumb seventeen-year-old troublemaker.\u201d Ruwen decided Big D had taken all this better than Bliz. It seemed difficult to rattle her. \u201cPoint taken. I know I\u2019m not invincible, and everyone that comes along will experience the same dangers, so protection is a valid point. I plan on bringing the usual crew along with two Grandmaster-level Step fighters, although they might be intoxicated most of the time.\u201d \u201cDo you have room to bring Qip and Wip along?\u201d Ruwen recalled the two large brothers that had been assigned to guard and protect Ruwen during the camping trip so long ago. \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re coming?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cOf course I\u2019m coming, you idiot. Can I bring the brothers? I hate leaving them behind.\u201d \u201cSure they can come. Although I caused them a lot of problems the last time they were with me, and this hardly seems like a way to say thank you or I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Big D waved her hand at Ruwen. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about those two. Do you know how many free drinks they\u2019ve gotten telling stories about how they guarded a god? Although, truth be told, they did a terrible job guarding you.\u201d Ruwen smiled. \u201cIt\u2019ll be great to see them again.\u201d \u201cWhen are we leaving?\u201d \u201cI still need to talk to a few people, so maybe in a day or two. Is that okay with you?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll be ready. And thank you for thinking of me. I can\u2019t wait to lord this over Bliz\u2019s head,\u201d Big D responded. Ruwen winced. \u201cOh no,\u201d Big D said. \u201cNow I know this will be a giant disaster.\u201d Ruwen couldn\u2019t tell if Big D was joking so he circled back to a comment she\u2019d made when he\u2019d arrived. \u201cWhat did you mean when you mentioned coming through the city portal at Ruwenvale?\u201d Big D raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d \u201cKnow what?\u201d Ruwen asked reluctantly. \u201cA new city appeared along the southern coast overnight. People there named their city after the man who saved it. If you can believe what they tell you: god wrapped the city in his wings, shielded it from the entire planet\u2019s destruction, and then carried them here to their new home. Seems pretty miraculous, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Ruwen raised his eyebrows. \u201cYeah, that sounds fantastical. It\u2019s probably all this heat. It scrambles brains, and makes people say crazy stuff.\u201d \u201cFunny thing about that city, it reminds me of the one I glanced at in the distance when those demons kidnapped me.\u201d \u201cOne city looks just like another from a distance, with the walls and all, you know.\u201d Big D gave Ruwen a knowing smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a miraculous story in any event. Seems they\u2019re grateful. Not everybody gets a city named after them.\u201d Ruwen\u2019s cheeks grew warm this time. He needed to talk with Nymthus about the city\u2019s name. It seemed a little much to name an entire city after him. Ruwen held out his arm, and Big D grasped it. \u201cDo you need a ride home?\u201d \u201cNo, the new Hearthstone ability you gave everyone will take me right home. Pretty genius, that choice.\u201d Big D was referencing the National Focus Ruwen had chosen for the country. National Focus: Civil Development and Satisfaction Description: Enhances citizen growth and public services. Bonuses: 10% Merit increase, Once-per-day Hearthstone returning user to Bind Point, Conjure a personal golem for 8 hours per day capable of completing simple to medium difficulty tasks, Every six months a roundtrip Portal Rune to anywhere on Grave. Structure Benefits: Build duration halved for the following structures: Library, School, Hospital, House of Worship, Park, Enhanced Housing, Town Hall, Theatre, Stadium, Government Building. Big D had used the benefits of this National Focus exactly like Ruwen had hoped, and it made him happy. He\u2019d stressed about the choice, but had decided saving a person\u2019s time was the greatest gift he could give them. \u201cThen I\u2019ll see you in a day or two,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cThanks for joining.\u201d \n CHAPTER 15 Ruwen returned to the Shattered Sun knowing his free time had nearly reached its limit. He needed to get ready for the bar and his plans to meet Hamma, Sift, and Lylan. Before leaving, though, Ruwen wanted to skim the Affinity Primer that he\u2019d received as a quest reward from the rift. Instead of sitting in his rock-filled Dungeon Master Lair, he decided to check on Fractal, and a few seconds later, he stepped out of a portal and into the room that contained four people. Two were actually semi-dead\u2014they were the gods that Ruwen had killed during the attack. As long as the bodies remained in the Material Realm, they wouldn\u2019t regenerate. Their deaths would become permanent once the souls had separated from the bodies, which Uruziel would perform once Fractal had finished his research. Fractal and Blapy had almost completed the God Stone, which would make revival available to the non-Ascended. Fractal had wanted to take advantage of these bodies by studying the gods\u2019 souls in order to gain insight into the last piece required for the God Stone to work. When Ruwen had told Fractal that one of the quests from the System had made it appear like souls served as a backup mechanism, it had triggered an epiphany for Fractal. The Dungeon Keeper had surrounded himself and the two gods in solid crystal, which is how Ruwen found the three of them now. Evidentially, Fractal hadn\u2019t finished with whatever he had going on under that crystal cocoon. The fourth person in the room was Blapy, who sat cross-legged on the floor drawing a picture with colored sticks on a thin piece of paper. \u201cHey Blapy,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cI see our favorite Dungeon Core is still in hibernation.\u201d \u201cYes, and I\u2019m beginning to think he\u2019s milking this for all it\u2019s worth to avoid work.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s okay in there though, right?\u201d Ruwen asked, trying to keep the concern out of his voice. Blapy glanced over at Ruwen, who stood ten feet away and a few feet back. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. You\u2019d know if something was wrong.\u201d Ruwen let out a loud sigh of relief. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nice that you came and checked on him,\u201d Blapy said softly without turning. Ruwen crossed his legs and sat a few feet to the side of Blapy. \u201cI came here to read that Affinity Primer. Hopefully it gives me a better understanding of what they represent. What can you tell me about the other three items that rift quest produced?\u201d \u201cWhen Fractal returns, I\u2019ll hand them over to him. He\u2019s superb at replicating even complex items. And these are complex, even if their purpose is simple.\u201d \u201cCan you give me a summary?\u201d Blapy stopped drawing. \u201cThe Affinity Assessor will break down whatever it\u2019s touching into basic Affinities. More advanced ones, I assume, break the Affinities down further and more accurately.\u201d What looked like a grey paintbrush appeared in Blapy\u2019s right hand. She touched it to her drawing, and six symbols appeared. Hey You didn\u2019t trigger and decipher them, which meant the symbols originated from the Outerverse. \u201cInteresting,\u201d Blapy muttered. \u201cLike I said, the Affinities it can sense are broad and lack the detail that would likely be needed for, say, the Affinity Splicer to function. We can talk about that in a moment.\u201d \u201cWhat do the symbols mean?\u201d Blapy pointed at each icon as she spoke. \u201cWax, affection, creativity, cellulose, protection, and power.\u201d Blapy paused and leaned away from the picture. \u201cOne of those really surprises me. Maybe it shouldn\u2019t. Anyway, you\u2019ll find those symbols in the Affinity Primer.\u201d \u201cThose seem like weird Affinities for a picture. I understand the wax and the cellulose, but the others are odd. What is that picture anyway?\u201d Ruwen studied Blapy\u2019s drawing. Honestly, it was terrible and looked like a five-year-old had drawn it. Eight trees were randomly placed around the paper. They had brown trunks and light green bushes for their tops. Dark green fruit hung from the limbs, drawn as messy little circles. Two stick figures stood in the middle. One looked like it was on fire and the other had eight circles which started at their waist and ended above their head. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Ruwen finally said. \u201cThank you,\u201d Blapy said, either not sensing Ruwen\u2019s uncertainty or choosing to ignore it. She looked at the drawing with pride, and then after a moment of thought, handed it to Ruwen. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad you don\u2019t have a refrigerator to put that on,\u201d Blapy said thoughtfully. \u201cMaybe I should get you one. Pictures like this are made for display, and nothing is a better art gallery than a refrigerator.\u201d Ruwen had no idea what a refrigerator was, but he took the picture and gave a small bow. \u201cThank you.\u201d To his surprise, a Notification appeared, and he glanced at it. Tring! Blapy has gifted you\u2026 Name: Avocado Surprise Quality: Legendary Restriction: Shadow Realm only Restriction: Single use Restriction: Effect triggers on holder\u2019s focus Effect (triggered): Avocadobra \u2013 create a delicious shield effective against even the most destructive power. Description: A vibrant, creamy shield. This protective barrier consists of a buttery texture and bright green color with a fresh and inviting aroma. Chips not included. Before Ruwen could say anything about the quality of the picture, Blapy spoke. \u201cThe Affinity Splicer is just what it sounds like\u2014it takes two basic Affinities and joins them together. I assume higher-level splicers can splice more Affinities of a higher level. So, you can take things like water and cold Affinities and get ice or respect and love to get adoration. Not sure how useful that is. I haven\u2019t had a chance to use the Rift Evaluator yet, as no new rifts have appeared, but from its description, it provides an estimation of the entity levels on the other side. It also provides basic environmental information\u2014handy for not stepping into the middle of a sun.\u201d \u201cThat seems a lot more useful. Hopefully Fractal can reproduce all this stuff, but especially that Rift Evaluator so everyone can carry one. If rifts ever become more common, those evaluators will prove invaluable.\u201d Blapy nodded at Ruwen and then turned her attention back to her wax colors. Another piece of paper appeared, and she drew a circle with a black wax stick. Ruwen focused inward and appeared on the platform attached to the new Citadel inside his mind. Behind him, he knew, hovered a thousands-of-miles-tall, four-sided statue. It portrayed different aspects of his life: one side looked like he did now, another like an armored Overlord, the next like the Ink Lord, and the last like the Scarecrow. Planets orbited Ruwen\u2019s location, which once again filled him with wonder. Even more awe-inspiring was the distant light of other stars. He summoned the Affinity Primer from memory, and the book appeared in his hand. Sitting on the platform, he opened the quest reward. The book contained ten chapters, and the first explained how little anyone knew. Affinities had only come to light after the three major factions of the Outerverse, the Luminara, Radiant, and Harmonics had captured Nexus technology. The Nexus, like the Primals, were outsiders to the current system of power. The Nexus originated from intelligent machines and they\u2019d divided themselves into different sub-factions. The Mender faction wanted to work with the other factions and had a branch of Affinity magic they called Psionics. The Nexus\u2019s Purge faction wanted to destroy the other factions and studied ways to control Affinities with science. The Purge based their understanding on what they called the Affinity Wheel. The three human factions hadn\u2019t known that femites had an Affinity property until the Nexus revelations. In the millennia since the discovery of Affinities, an extreme practice had arisen where existing and newly created universes were harvested to collect these powerful Affinities. Finding individuals within the Radiant, Luminara, or Harmonic factions that demonstrate any Psionic ability, that is, the ability to manipulate Affinities, proved difficult. One reason many speculated for this statistical oddity was that humans working with the Nexus Mender faction had better methods of detecting Psionic ability and took anyone with talent before they exhibited abilities. Ruwen considered the politics and friction that existed in the Outerverse. Of the five factions, only the Harmonics seemed neutral, but that was only because they cared more about the balance of power and not because they cared about the people. The Outerverse appeared like a very unpleasant place. The Basic Affinity Primer discussed how the Nexus Purge guarded their Affinity Wheel research extremely well, and little was known about the wheel\u2019s organization. The remaining chapters of the Primer grouped the differing femite Affinities into logical collections that started with essential elements like Life, Stability, Energy, and Consciousness before moving into Social and Emotional Affinities like Love, Trust, Fear, and Ambition. One chapter covered environmental ones like Water, Earth, Air, and Fire and another for Beauty, Innovation, Justice, and Truth. Even concepts like Duration, Distance, Gravity, and Magnetism were addressed. Even the Primer couldn\u2019t decide what constituted a primary Affinity inside the Nexus Affinity Wheel and what might only be a derivative or branch Affinity. The fact a concept could hold power, be quantified by the Nexus, and utilized with magic called Psionics seemed messy and made Ruwen uncomfortable. The last chapter discussed what little information was known about those with Psionic powers. The most glaring data points were that creative individuals, or those with a strong faith in something abstract had the most success. Researchers believed that those groups had strengthened their ability to see patterns and connections around them, which served as a steppingstone to Psionic talent. Hamma did fit that profile. Ruwen\u2019s Cleverness Attribute had given him similar abilities at seeing connections, but so far it had centered around concrete relationships and events. Was that because of his logical thought process? If he made progress with understanding more abstract relationships, might his Cleverness Attribute help him with that as well? Ruwen turned to the appendix and quickly memorized the thousands of symbols used for Affinities. The technology the System provided, like the Affinity Assessor, would use these Affinity icons to communicate. Ruwen closed the book and, with a thought, it disappeared. He studied the visible planets as they orbited around his position and tried to suppress the uneasiness that such things existed inside his mind. Overlord, Uruziel, and Sivart had left him alone to read in peace, and he appreciated them for that. Hamma, Sift, and Lylan were likely already at the bar, and Ruwen needed to get moving. He shifted his awareness back to the real world and discovered Blapy had disappeared. Fractal remained encased in crystal, and the room had an eerie silence. Looking down, Ruwen found another hand-drawn picture. Blapy had completed it and evidently wanted him to have it. It was drawn as badly as the previous picture. The black circle might have been an island with white water surrounding it. If that assumption was accurate, five towers circled the island. A grey animal hovered in the air and after five seconds of study, he decided it looked like some type of bird or winged creature. A notification glowed in the bottom of Ruwen\u2019s vision. Tring! Blapy has gifted you\u2026 Name: Stupid Guardian Quality: Legendary Restriction: Shadow Realm only Restriction: Single use Effect (triggered): Last Word \u2013 display to the guardian of the spires to gain entrance. Description: A more accurate description of \u201cLast Word\u201d is \u201cLast Words,\u201d but an artist\u2019s vision is not something to alter lightly. Only at the bottom can one be sure their next step leads upward. Ruwen carefully placed the picture in his Void Band. Blapy had given him two strange legendary items. She knew far more than he did about that realm, so he was thankful for both pictures. Despite the confusion they caused, he had no doubt they\u2019d prove valuable for whatever he would soon face. \n CHAPTER 16 Ruwen entered Pour Judgment and waved at Bliz, and then performed a sequence of snaps and claps back at Chancey. Before he could even turn toward the large dining room, he heard Sift shout. \u201cFour hours!\u201d Ruwen tried to hide a grin as he faced the voice and found all his friends sitting at a mostly private table in the back corner. Hamma and Rami waved. Xavier, in humanoid form, didn\u2019t move. Lylan gave a nod and slightly shook her head in apology for Sift. It took ten seconds to reach the table and Sift had stood and pointed at Ruwen. \u201cSee, look at his smile,\u201d Sift said as he sat. He turned to Lylan. \u201cI told you.\u201d \u201cDid what?\u201d Ruwen asked as he sat next to Hamma. Hamma leaned close, and Ruwen gave her a kiss before holding her hand. Sift still looked at Lylan. \u201cIt was on purpose.\u201d \u201cHonestly,\u201d Lylan responded, \u201cI kind of believe it was just an excuse to get naked again.\u201d \u201cNaked?\u201d Ruwen asked. Lylan used a finger to turn Sift\u2019s head toward Ruwen. \u201cTell him.\u201d Sift leaned over the table and hissed. \u201cFour hours in a shaman\u2019s robe\u2014a very itchy robe I might add\u2014hiding from Fluffy. He\u2019s relentless when he\u2019s on the hunt and he really wanted whoever messed up his lower vault.\u201d Ruwen tried even harder to hide his smile. \u201cHow does that relate to being naked?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t act stupid. You know my sifting invisibility is my trump card.\u201d He tilted his head in thought. \u201cWell, mostly invisible now, I guess.\u201d \u201cMostly is what the priestesses of Wenquian said,\u201d Hamma whispered. Sift glared at Hamma. \u201cWe\u2019re not bringing that up again. This is about Ruwen ditching me after causing a mess.\u201d Rami laughed. \u201cThe worst, or best part, depending on how you look at it, was that Fluffy knew where Sift was the whole time.\u201d \u201cYeah, that man is evil. He made me suffer. Worse, he made me promise to do him a favor or he was going to make me spend the rest of the day putting everything back in order.\u201d \u201cFavor?\u201d Lylan asked. \u201cYou never mentioned the favor before.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s because the favor related to this lout.\u201d A server placed a pitcher of cider in front of Ruwen, and he sighed. He twisted around to see the bar and found Bliz grinning. Ruwen smiled ruefully and dropped the Tankard of Potency out of his Void Band. He held it up toward Bliz and the bartender returned the gesture. The tankard symbolized Ruwen\u2019s status as the newest Void Band user. He\u2019d only had it a couple of weeks, but it had created such an impact on him, he\u2019d used his Grandmaster Alchemist final project to create the pill Blind Bandit\u2019s Regret to counteract the mug\u2019s effects. This tankard had turned Ruwen into a smashed mess the night he\u2019d received it. As Ruwen filled the tankard he asked the obvious question. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Fluffy ask me for the favor himself?\u201d Sift clenched his teeth, and his face reddened. Ruwen didn\u2019t rush Sift. It must be more complicated than it sounded. The contents of the mug smelled more like lemonade than cider, and Ruwen didn\u2019t bother taking Blind Bandit\u2019s Regret. He didn\u2019t plan on getting wrecked tonight and didn\u2019t need the alcohol poison immunity. Lylan patted Sift\u2019s back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, just let it out.\u201d \u201cEvidently,\u201d Sift said, \u201cFluffy owed Findley a favor, and the evil cook used it.\u201d \u201cEvil might be stretching the definition,\u201d Lylan added. Sift turned to Lylan, horrified. \u201cYou know how many doughnuts he\u2019s hidden from me? The number of pies and cookies? It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t even want people to enjoy them.\u201d \u201cMaybe,\u201d Rami said, \u201che wanted leftovers for others to enjoy.\u201d Sift glared at Rami. \u201cDon\u2019t take that diabolical man\u2019s side, Rami.\u201d \u201cWhat was the favor?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cFindley heard about your alchemy trip and wants to come along.\u201d That surprised Ruwen. \u201cWhy would he want to do that?\u201d Sift raised his hands. \u201cObviously to make desserts and hide them from us.\u201d \u201cAs likely as that seems,\u201d Ruwen responded, \u201ccan you think of another reason?\u201d Sift contemplated the question before shaking his head. \u201cNope.\u201d Ruwen turned to Rami. \u201cAny ideas?\u201d As Rami considered, Ruwen caught a glance between Hamma and Lylan. He turned to Hamma. \u201cOut with it.\u201d Hamma looked uncomfortable. Lylan spoke up. \u201cIt could be related to gathering information, as famous chefs are in high demand and can gain access to restricted areas.\u201d Ruwen nodded, understanding. He thought about the entity living in Hamma\u2019s necklace. A being that simultaneously existed in thousands, or maybe tens of thousands, of other places. Ruwen didn\u2019t know all the details as he didn\u2019t want to pry into Hamma\u2019s and Lylan\u2019s associations in the Black Pyramid, but he\u2019d already guessed that they were part of some larger organization that either worked with Ky\u2019s Shade network or did similar types of activities. He wondered if Ky knew about Hamma\u2019s and Lylan\u2019s actions. \u201cWhy did Findley use Fluffy?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cFindley keeps to himself,\u201d Rami said, \u201cand Fluffy might be the only person he comes in contact with that could pass a message to you.\u201d Ruwen knew that wasn\u2019t exactly true. If Findley was part of the same underground organization in the Black Pyramid, he could\u2019ve used Hamma or Lylan. Unless Findley didn\u2019t know that they were part of the organization. That was the problem with secret structures. One had to spend a lot of time worrying about who knew what. \u201cObviously,\u201d Ruwen said, \u201cI\u2019ll say no if you don\u2019t want him along, Sift. The decision is yours.\u201d Sift visibly calmed, and then twisted his lips in what Ruwen assumed was some process that approximated thinking. \u201cThat culinary tyrant can come if he cooks us one meal a day and makes a new dessert daily that he has to tell us the recipe to.\u201d Ruwen thought the conditions held a lot of merit as it might help improve his cooking skill. \u201cSounds good to me. I\u2019ll let you convey the message.\u201d This put Sift in a much better mood, and he grinned. Hamma leaned in close to Ruwen and took a deep breath. \u201cYou look dashing and smell nice. Where did you get that cologne?\u201d Before coming to the bar, Ruwen had chosen a white shirt, a pair of dark blue pants, and then spent ten minutes contemplating what the combination of colors meant to him. He did this to try and expand his thinking and obtain some insight into Affinities. Ruwen hadn\u2019t gained any insights other than the pants\u2019 color might be midnight blue as opposed to dark blue and the white shirt could represent divinity or maybe clarity. He considered that the combination created a contrast of light and dark, and the shade of blue reminded him of the crushing depths of the Frigid Sea. Based on the multiple colognes Hamma had previously assaulted Ruwen with, which he\u2019d easily reverse-engineered, he created a new cologne right there in his Dungeon Master\u2019s Lair that combined the scent of water he remembered from Lylan\u2019s perfume with the more masculine scent of leather and the planks of a ship. He added the common base scents along with a hint of vanilla that was a common ingredient in Hamma\u2019s perfumes. \u201cThanks, I made it myself. It\u2019s called Frigid Sunshine.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful name and suits that scent perfectly. Maybe if saving the universe doesn\u2019t work out, or you get bored, you could become a perfumer.\u201d Ruwen smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it in mind. Can we talk about this in more detail later? I want to know what you\u2019d have done differently. I think trying things on my own and then learning how you see them will help immensely as I figure this Affinity thing out.\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d Xavier made the mistake of asking Sift if Findley might be an alchemist, as the correlation between cooking and alchemy was high. Sift immediately launched into a story on how Findley had tried to poison him with a vanilla custard. Ruwen picked up his tankard and had just sipped the spiked lemonade when a voice he\u2019d never heard before spoke in his mind. Wow, there are more people in here than in Lylan\u2019s head. Ruwen swallowed his mouthful of lemonade and slowly placed his mug back on the table. His mental defenses had the strength to fend off gods. It wasn\u2019t possible for someone to just slip into his head which meant the voice must be from someone already here. Who are you? Are you a Narrator? Narrator? How interesting. I always wanted to narrate a book. Sometimes I narrate Sift\u2019s day. It\u2019s a smashing fun time. He\u2019ll be like \u2018I\u2019m going to beat Vex through the gauntlet today and not hit a single tree,\u2019 and I\u2019ll deepen my voice and say, \u2018He wouldn\u2019t beat Vex today, and will, in fact, strike many trees.\u2019 Then\u2060\u2014 Wait, Ruwen interrupted. Who are you? Oh sorry. Everyone said you were so smart, and since the Pact dissolved, I thought you would\u2019ve already figured it out. I shouldn\u2019t have made such an assumption. It reminds me of this time I assumed a mushroom was harmless, but instead, it almost killed the woman who added it to her stew. Wow did that really mess up her blood. Speaking of blood, did you know it can hold keys? And not like keys on a piano, but like\u2060\u2014 The voice wasn\u2019t Sift\u2019s, but the rapid-fire stream of nonsense reminded Ruwen strongly of his best friend. Which immediately led him to the most likely source for the voice. Sift was still explaining his terrible food poisoning to Xavier, which Ruwen honestly didn\u2019t want to interrupt as Xavier looked uncomfortable, his normal harsh violet colors a muted purple, but the source of the voice was more important than extending Xavier\u2019s discomfort. Ruwen waited another ten seconds anyway, while the voice in his head chatted happily. Leaning forward, Ruwen tapped the table in front of Sift. \u201cHey, did you bring Io with you?\u201d Sift looked at Ruwen as if he was an idiot. \u201cOf course.\u201d Sift removed the Elder Dagger from the hidden hip sheath and placed it on the table between them. Hi Ruwen. Nice to meet you. I\u2019m Io. \n CHAPTER 17 Understanding hit Ruwen in a rush. The Pact had forbidden Champions from interacting with Elder weapons, the deities deeming the combination too powerful. But now that the Pact had dissolved, nothing stopped Io from speaking. Uruziel appeared in Ruwen\u2019s peripheral vision. Io is trusted by Rami and it used her connection to initiate contact. It wishes to explore your mind, but the System we put in place stopped it. My memories from Uru are not complete regarding Io, but I know the goddess trusted him completely. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s here to cause trouble. He\u2019s just very curious. Thank you, Uruziel. For now, let\u2019s keep him in the waiting room. We don\u2019t need to expose all the details of my mind. Understood, Uruziel responded before disappearing. Score one for the new System. It felt nice to have another safeguard in place. Ruwen realized Io still hadn\u2019t stopped talking. ...and I told him snow wouldn\u2019t stop the burning, but he didn\u2019t listen and slid down the entire glacier on his bare butt. The streak that left reminds me of this tar pit I accidentally fell in one time. Okay, I was thrown in it, but I wanted to go, so I think that\u2019s the same thing. I\u2019m\u2060\u2014 Hey Io, sorry to interrupt, but why are you trying to explore my mind? I didn\u2019t mean to. It\u2019s just when I reached out to speak with you, I sensed the vastness, and it felt like the first time I entered this Realm. Please forgive me if I harmed you. It\u2019s okay, I know the power of curiosity. You mentioned people in Lylan\u2019s head earlier. How many are in there? I\u2019m not sure exactly because many of them speak in the same cryptic patterns. It makes them hard to tell apart, but I would say more than fifteen. Now that was a surprising bit of information as Ruwen had never suspected Lylan of housing entities in her mind. He wondered how they\u2019d gotten there. Had they always existed or did it have something to do with her hydra. Thanks, Io. When you mentioned arriving in the Material Realm, where did you exist before that? Someplace else. I came to find the colors. About a thousand questions exploded in Ruwen\u2019s mind, but now wasn\u2019t the time to spend an hour in silent discussion with the Elder weapon. It was nice to finally meet you, Io, and I hope we can talk more soon. Ruwen waited for Hamma and Lylan to finish a discussion on the pros and cons of taking Fighter as a second Class. \u201cIt\u2019s nice having both of you back,\u201d Ruwen said to Hamma and Lylan. \u201cKy had the two of you longer than I expected. Is everything okay over there?\u201d \u201cNot really,\u201d Lylan responded. \u201cThe Infernal Realm\u2019s invasion of the Pyramid highlighted the fact that we have one or more traitors. The local investigators, despite all their advantages, couldn\u2019t find the culprits, so Ky\u2019s people came in to give it a go.\u201d Hamma continued. \u201cHaving so many human Shades all over the Pyramid depths caused a lot of friction.\u201d Hamma gripped her necklace. \u201cLylan spent a lot of time facilitating the relationship between the two groups.\u201d Lylan raised her mug. \u201cYou know me, the great uniter.\u201d And then she drained her drink. So that answered Ruwen\u2019s earlier question on how integrated the two organizations were\u2014not at all. Sift turned from his discussion with Xavier and swapped his nearly full drink with Lylan\u2019s empty one. \u201cShe actually is a uniter, don\u2019t let her sarcasm fool you.\u201d \u201cAgreed,\u201d Hamma said. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen her down south.\u201d \u201cI wish I could\u2019ve,\u201d Ruwen responded. \u201cIt seems a lot of very interesting things happened. I would love to know anything you can share.\u201d \u201cHe means the Death Miming,\u201d Sift whispered loudly. \u201cI know,\u201d Lylan said quietly. \u201cDeath Miming?\u201d Ruwen repeated questioningly. \u201cMost call it Hexing magic, but I like the ring of Death Miming.\u201d \u201cJust so you know,\u201d Sift said, \u201cit\u2019s very painful. My joints still ache from Lyl\u2019s demonstration.\u201d Lylan looked around, confirming that no one sat near them, and their conversation remained private. \u201cI learned what Legacy Shards are,\u201d Lylan said. Ruwen leaned forward, his curiosity spiking. Legacy Shards had been one of the terms that appeared in his log when he transitioned from Gem to Divine. Nobody had any idea what they were. \u201cI see I have your complete attention,\u201d Lylan said dryly. \u201cIt turns out, they\u2019re closely related to my condition.\u201d \u201cWhat is your condition?\u201d Lylan considered for three heartbeats before answering. \u201cRemember the vision Blapy gave us of when Miranda, Pen, and Kholy found the dark temple floating in the Darkness?\u201d \u201cYes, I think about that vision a lot.\u201d \u201cYou told us that the three sides represented three different types of magic. I don\u2019t want to go into too much detail here, but considering the way I discovered what I carry, I think it\u2019s a fourth type.\u201d \u201cFrom what I witnessed in the Infernal Realm, I completely agree,\u201d Ruwen stated. \u201cHow are Legacy Shards and Hexing magic related?\u201d \u201cThis is going to sound stupid, but my blood has eight octagons, and each of those octagons has eight slots.\u201d Lylan glanced around at everyone, but nobody mocked or made fun of her statement, which must have encouraged her to continue. \u201cLegacy Shards are items that fit into the slots each octagon has. The shards are like magic spells or body enhancements. I\u2019m still learning but the more of the same Shard type or the closer the Shards are related inside the octagon, the more powerful everything in that octagon becomes. So having similar Legacy Shards in the same octagon has a multiplying effect.\u201d Lylan paused and to Ruwen\u2019s relief she continued. \u201cI\u2019m less sure about this, but I think Energy is related to those octagons as well.\u201d \u201cLike the Energy we use for channeled spells?\u201d Hamma asked. Lylan nodded. \u201cI\u2019m guessing those octagons can store or amplify Energy. Maybe both.\u201d Ruwen glanced at Rami and leaned back in thought. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rami asked. \u201cWe know from the System\u2019s quests that all of us in this Universe had the magic from all the Outerverse factions placed inside us. Three of the factions are straightforward: the Luminara use soul magic, the Radiants chakras, and the Harmonics manipulate the underlying structure of the universe.\u201d Ruwen pointed at Hamma. \u201cFrom our experience in the Rift and the information in the Basic Affinity Primer quest reward, it\u2019s obvious that Affinities are a branch of magic called Psionics that the Nexus are studying. That leaves one faction, the Primal. And I think Lylan just filled in that gap in our knowledge.\u201d Sift touched his chest. \u201cAre you saying that I can do Death Miming?\u201d Ruwen shook his head. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how rare Lylan\u2019s magic is, or what it takes to use Legacy Shards. Maybe only certain people can use them, or a certain quality is needed for a Legacy Shard to work. But I do believe that these octagons Lylan described are inside all of us, and we only lack the mechanism to unlock them.\u201d \u201cDo you think this might be easier for non-humans?\u201d Rami asked. Ruwen shrugged. \u201cMaybe. Probably. What if the special abilities many creatures have are because of this magic Lylan just described?\u201d Ruwen turned back to Lylan. \u201cHow does the Hexing magic work?\u201d \u201cHexing signs harness Energy stored in your body and connect you to something or someone else. Then you can do things.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a fundamental type of magic,\u201d Xavier said. \u201cPrimal is a good name for it.\u201d \u201cHow do the sigils work?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cI find it interesting that Soul magic also has a connection to geometric shapes, and your description\u2014and the one demonstration I witnessed\u2014you created shapes with your fingers.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how they work, but I do know the Hexing magic won\u2019t activate unless they\u2019re done properly.\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, when we get some free time, I\u2019d like to study your process using Harmonic Sight to try and gain a better understanding of how all these magics are connected\u2014maybe connected is the wrong word, but I\u2019m interested in their similarities.\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d Lylan responded. Ruwen turned to Rami. \u201cCan you start some queries on any references to blood magic or hexing please? Since this is a Primal-type magic, I\u2019d concentrate on indexes relating to creatures with magic as they\u2019ve likely already unlocked what\u2019s in their heritage.\u201d Ruwen wanted to ask Lylan about the voices in her head\u2014the one\u2019s Io had discovered\u2014but couldn\u2019t think of a natural way to bring it up. He decided to wait for an opportunity. Maybe Sift might know. \u201cAre we done talking shop?\u201d Hamma asked. \u201cI\u2019d like to give Archie his present.\u201d Ruwen refocused on the present and smiled at Hamma. \u201cOf course, sorry about sidetracking us.\u201d A churning grey substance appeared in the middle of the table and a second later Archie\u2019s slime eyeball emerged. It continued upward on a stalk which rotated so the eye could survey everyone before focusing on Hamma. Hamma laughed and wagged her finger at Archie. \u201cSo impatient. Still, you\u2019re long overdue for your reward. Ruwen got you something as well.\u201d The eye swiveled to stare at Ruwen. Ruwen jolted with panic as he realized he\u2019d left the Naktos temple without actually buying a figurine. Hamma\u2019s and Valora\u2019s discussion had bored him so much that he\u2019d jumped at the first opportunity to leave, not realizing he\u2019d never completed the reason he\u2019d gone there in the first place. Hamma released Ruwen\u2019s hand under the table and a moment later she pressed a small item into his palm. Without a glance at Ruwen, she presented Archie with her gift, placing the thumb-sized figurine at the edge of the table. Archie immediately sprouted two vines, which snapped out and carefully wrapped around the figurine, bringing it close to his eye. The thumb-sized figurine Valora had carved captured a hunting dog in mid-point, its body taut with anticipation. It had a white coat with patches of rich reddish-brown markings, and its texture suggested a fine, wiry fur. The dog\u2019s tail extended outward in a straight, purposeful line. Its eyes held a vivid, focused intensity, as if gazing at unseen prey, and every muscle looked ready to spring into action at the slightest rustle. Archie hugged the figurine to his stem for ten seconds and then placed it carefully in the grey goop he sprouted from. The figurine slowly sank until it disappeared, and Archie\u2019s eye turned and fixated on Ruwen. Ruwen slowly raised his hand from under the table and saw the figurine at the same moment as Archie. Vines shot forward and wrapped around Ruwen\u2019s wrist, but he didn\u2019t detect any ill intent. More vines appeared, and they lifted the figurine from his palm. Archie trembled as he brought the figurine to his eye. It was obvious that Hamma had given Ruwen the figurine she knew Archie would love the most. The sculpture depicted three foxes in their den, nestled within an earthy burrow. Vibrant russet fur contrasted by white underbellies and black-tipped ears shone as if illuminated by the soft light of the setting sun. One fox curiously peeked outward from the den\u2019s entrance, while the other two wrestled, their limbs intertwined, their jaws latched playfully on each other. The foxes\u2019 coats shifted gracefully over their lithe bodies, and their sharply defined snouts and keen, alert eyes exuded a combination of cunning and curiosity. Each delicately crafted paw gently transitioned to black as if dipped in ink, and the fluffy, white-tipped tails curled with spirit. After fifteen seconds, Archie\u2019s eye turned from the figurine to stare at Ruwen. It glistened with emotion and the figurine trembled from Archie\u2019s shaking. Archie dipped his eye and Ruwen bowed as low as the table allowed. Even in the small things, Hamma sacrificed without thinking. Ruwen leaned over and gave Hamma a kiss. \u201cThank you.\u201d \n CHAPTER 18 Ruwen placed his hand on the door handle of the bar, but paused when he heard a hauntingly lilting voice. Lylan had guessed correctly about where to go. Ruwen had worked up the nerve to ask Lylan last night in Pour Judgment after multiple drinks. He\u2019d been concerned about her reaction to the question because he didn\u2019t fully understand what had happened to her or the events down south. The song\u2019s words were delivered with such emotion that pictures formed in Ruwen\u2019s mind. The singer\u2019s voice surpassed perfect, attaining a magical quality. This ballad was new to Ruwen, but with the knowledge he\u2019d attained when taking the Bard Specialization, he recognized by the tempo and pitch that the song had nearly reached its conclusion. Instead of entering, Ruwen paused, not wanting to interrupt the singer\u2019s finale. Oh, sing of the waves, the icy graves, And the queen who rules the deep, With a crown of pearls and swirling curls, Where the mighty hydras sleep. Her voice, a call across the swell, Commands the beasts below. Three-headed serpents, a death knell, Their power, none can overthrow. Oh, sing of the waves, the icy graves, And the queen who rules the deep, With a crown of pearls and swirling curls, Where the mighty hydras sleep. Her realm, a fortress of mist and spray. Her word, the ocean\u2019s law. Sailors pray as they drift her way, A plea to survive the maw. From depths untold, her tales unfold, A symphony of the sea. Each note a command from her cold hand, To the hydras, wild and free. Oh, sing of the waves, the icy graves, And the queen who rules the deep, With a crown of pearls and swirling curls, Where the mighty hydras sleep. So here\u2019s to the queen of the endless blue, Her majesty and her might. May her reign be long and her will be true, In the ocean\u2019s eternal night. The final word hung in the air, surrounding Ruwen, and he felt the pressure against his mental defenses as the magic in the song tried to influence his senses. Despite his expertise and natural barriers, he still felt moved by the beauty and obvious emotion the Bard had provided. Silence reigned for five seconds before the first of the patrons shook themselves free of the singer\u2019s weave. Enthusiastic applause and cheers rose and shook the walls and the door that Ruwen gripped. A person could say a lot of things about Lylan\u2019s ancient grandfather, but being a poor singer wasn\u2019t one of them. Ruwen pulled the door open and stepped inside. He didn\u2019t wear the normal cloak and hood he used to hide his identity. Here, it would only draw more attention as the heat and humidity this far south made a hood as rare as a cool breeze. Instead, Ruwen generated a barrier around himself that combined Camouflage and Hide into an effective new spell, causing even high-level cultivators and Ascendants to gloss right over his presence. The tavern had more patrons than Ruwen expected, and only a few tables remained empty. Thankfully, with everyone clumped in the middle near the stage to hear the Bard\u2019s performance the empty tables stood at the edges. Ruwen sat at a small table near the kitchen and waited while Gunder accepted the praise and adoration of his audience. All performers knew that this step was a critical part of the performance, validating the well-wishes and appreciation and forming yet another connection with the audience, vastly increasing the tips the performer received. Gunder didn\u2019t accept money but faithfully, and apparently earnestly, listened to every one of his fans as he accepted their words. Ruwen didn\u2019t detect any falsehood in Gunder\u2019s actions, which kind of surprised him. Eventually, the crowd around Gunder cleared, and the Bard made his way to the bar where multiple drinks waited for him, paid for by enthusiastic fans. The conversation and general noise of the tavern meant calling out to Gunder would require Ruwen to raise his voice. Out of curiosity, he toggled on the No Lies ability that he\u2019d received from Rami\u2019s Third Codex of Evolution. He recalled the effect. Effect (Passive): No Lies: Disposition visible: green=friendly, white=neutral, red=hostile. Gunder\u2019s outline shone green. It meant Ruwen could use the Sphere of Influence ability from that same Codex to form a mental connection and speak to him telepathically, but that seemed inappropriate considering their common Class. Ruwen dismissed No Lies and whistled a perfect C tone three octaves above normal human hearing. Gunder slowly put the drink, which had been halfway to his mouth, back on the bar and slowly turned, studying the crowd. On the third pass, he slowed when looking in Ruwen\u2019s direction and cast the Bard spell Chord of Clarity that caused his eyes to briefly shine yellow and doubled his Perception for ten seconds. Turning, Gunder gathered the five remaining drinks, holding them all as if he\u2019d worked in a tavern his whole life, and walked directly toward Ruwen. Gunder placed the drinks on the table but didn\u2019t immediately sit. Bowing gracefully Gunder spoke softly. \u201cI\u2019m unsure how to greet you as my experience with the Divine has mostly consisted of being a victim. I\u2019m halfway through a ballad describing the events of your Divine battle. You are not a god to trifle with.\u201d Ruwen gestured at the chair. \u201cPlease join me, Gunder, and you can just call me Ruwen.\u201d Gunder sat as instructed and met Ruwen\u2019s gaze. \u201cDoes the queen know you\u2019re here?\u201d \u201cOf course. I wouldn\u2019t insert myself into your family dynamic without her permission.\u201d \u201cGood. I appreciate your respecting her desires\u2014and more importantly that you considered them to begin with.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here, ironically. I\u2019ve overlooked an area of my understanding; one that I only recently discovered existed. But to your point, I\u2019ve made an effort to use all the Wisdom I\u2019ve gathered. That same wisdom brought me here despite our recent differences.\u201d \u201cI apologized to the queen for my actions and extend the same deep remorse to you. The revelations the goddess bestowed upon all of us stripped away all my long-held preconceptions and biases. Her sacrifice humbles me, and I\u2019ve lived every moment since in shame. Every breath feels undeserved.\u201d \u201cEveryone makes mistakes, some larger than others. I\u2019ve learned from painful experience, though, that they can serve as powerful engines of growth. Lylan isn\u2019t the type to release a grudge willingly. The fact she okayed my proposal is all I really need to know about the man you are now.\u201d Gunder bowed his head. \u201cI serve at the queen\u2019s pleasure. And thank you for noticing. If I may be so bold, what can I help you with?\u201d \u201cRecently, I discovered that my view of the world is very linear and rigid. Not in the way that I think, but in the way I visualize and organize the world around me. What bothers me the most, though, is this same viewpoint is ingrained in the music I see. My first question to you is, when you use Harmonic Sight and Knowledge, how chaotic are the patterns you see?\u201d The shift in topic brightened Gunder\u2019s face. \u201cDo you not see any curves at all?\u201d \u201cI do, but after careful study, I determined the swirls and curves I observed are all mathematically precise and adhere to fundamental formula. I\u2019m now certain that my logic has affected my Perception.\u201d \u201cAnd the colors?\u201d \u201cBasic, with very little overlap between layers.\u201d Gunder nodded. \u201cWhat you\u2019re experiencing is rare but not unheard of. Many of the students that study to become Bards face various hurdles. What makes your condition rare is that very few highly logical people pursue a creative art for their Class.\u201d \u201cCan it be fixed?\u201d \u201cThat depends on you.\u201d Ruwen didn\u2019t let his embarrassment and self-consciousness take root in his thoughts and asked his question immediately. \u201cCan you help me?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you: the success rate is very low. We\u2019re talking about how people think. What you need to learn is a new way of doing that. I did have an apprentice who had a similar issue, although not as severe, and we made progress by practicing a type of music called Flow.\u201d \u201cI want to try. Will you teach me?\u201d Gunder raised a hand. \u201cOf course I will help, but I want you to know that this process has a cost. An emotional one.\u201d Ruwen waited for Gunder to continue. \u201cThe only successful method I\u2019ve seen is when the instructor allows the student to piggyback on the experience and view the resulting patterns together. Because so much of nonlinear or unstructured music is emotionally dense, it\u2019s very difficult to learn by explaining.\u201d \u201cThat seems invasive of your privacy.\u201d \u201cIt is. Worse, I carry a lot of emotional baggage. The experience won\u2019t be pleasant for you.\u201d Ruwen\u2019s respect for Gunder increased\u2014the man offered up a difficult teaching method that encroached on his most private space \u2014 his mind. Ruwen gave a small bow. \u201cI recognize the sacrifice and the speed with which it was offered. Thank you, Gunder. Can we give it a try right now?\u201d \u201cYes, but the process of merging thoughts is difficult, and most never make it past this first step. You\u2019ll need to use Harmonic Knowledge to view my mind, match yours to the same frequencies, and push yourself outward to merge with my experience. Creating this bridge is difficult. A person\u2019s mind naturally rejects the presence of another identity.\u201d Ruwen thought of the thousands and thousands of entities, not to mention worlds, in his mind. He doubted one more identity would cause an issue. \u201cI understand.\u201d Gunder looked doubtful. \u201cJust don\u2019t get discouraged if this takes a few months to master. Very few Bards can manage it. To be honest, I can\u2019t project myself. But I have, with hundreds of years of practice, mastered the ability to host another.\u201d \u201cThank you for the warning,\u201d Ruwen said as he activated Harmonic Sight and Knowledge. \n CHAPTER 19 Gunder\u2019s doubtful expression persisted, but he shrugged and removed a lute from his dimensional bag. He strummed the instrument and expertly tuned it before nodding at Ruwen. Gunder played so softly on the lute that Ruwen guessed it was only his proximity and Divine hearing that allowed him to clearly hear it. Anyone else nearby wouldn\u2019t notice their impromptu lesson. The one thing Ruwen had complete control over was his mind, and he easily synchronized it to Gunder\u2019s. Then as lightly as he could, he pushed his mental focus toward Gunder, careful to use as little Mental Energy as possible so he didn\u2019t turn Gunder\u2019s mind into paste. As Ruwen merged with Gunder\u2019s senses, his vision swam, and he suddenly saw himself across the table. Gunder\u2019s old sorrow and fresh guilt surrounded Ruwen like a swamp. \u201cOkay,\u201d Gunder said. \u201cGo ahead and start. Remember, this will take months, so\u2060\u2014\u201d I\u2019m here, Gunder, Ruwen said in the Bard\u2019s mind. Gunder jumped and barely kept hold of the lute. You\u2019re here? That\u2019s impossible. Are you sure it\u2019s not just a telepathic link? Ruwen knew the difference as he currently stared out of Gunder\u2019s eyes, something not possible with a normal telepathic link. We\u2019ll know for sure when you activate your Harmonic Sight. This time Gunder didn\u2019t jump. He reseated his lute, strummed the instrument, and activated his Bard abilities. The tavern colors warmed as the hum of chatter and clink of mugs created support for Gunder\u2019s performance. Gunder plucked his lute with a curious, free-flowing melody that Ruwen had never heard before and didn\u2019t find the most pleasant. Gunder\u2019s fingers danced unpredictably across the strings, weaving chords that filled the air between them with vibrant colors. Well? Gunder asked. I\u2019m seeing it, Ruwen paused before stating an uncomfortable reality. It\u2019s very different than mine. This is what I call \u201cFlow Music,\u201d Gunder said, not dwelling on Ruwen\u2019s painful admission. It\u2019s not just about playing notes but playing between the notes. Watch and listen. Gunder plucked a series of notes, each tone cascading into the next while colors swirled around them\u2014 oranges deepening into yellows, spiraling into smoky greens. Each note bends into the next, never quite settling. That\u2019s the music\u2019s spirit. Ruwen stared, mesmerized by the shapes and colors. All his prior experience didn\u2019t compare to this. The music appeared alive, breathing. Gunder continued, Each musician who plays the Flow brings their own feelings, their own colors to the mix. Say, if I\u2019m feeling joyful, the melody might burst into bright, golden orbs. Gunder\u2019s playing became lively, his lute producing sparks of vibrant fire that danced and flickered over the table. Gunder\u2019s sensory input assaulted Ruwen. The air felt lighter, the scent generating impressions of an early spring day. And if I shift to a somber mood\u2026 The pace slowed, the melody dipping into dark browns, each tone stretching into teardrops that Ruwen felt dripping down his face. Across the table, he watched himself brush his own cheeks unconsciously. Ruwen still couldn\u2019t speak. Each of Gunder\u2019s chords contained more than just the tones of the notes. They combined to form complex structures that fit easily within the malleable Harmony. Flow Music responds to the player\u2019s heart and the listeners\u2019 spirits. It\u2019s a conversation, not a concert. You let all the feelings guide you, and there are no wrong turns. Just pathways opening to new destinations. After five seconds of silence, Gunder continued. Ruwen? Are you still with me? Yes, sorry, I\u2019m just a bit overwhelmed. Is this how Bards experience the world? Gunder chuckled. Maybe to a degree. Let\u2019s not forget I\u2019ve had a little experience. Ruwen knew that was a vast understatement. In his time, Gunder had been considered unparalleled and the greatest of masters. His skills had helped win him the hand of a queen. What Ruwen witnessed right now likely represented the peak of Bard abilities. Ruwen collected his scattered thoughts. You\u2019re creating the structure with your feelings? Yes! Although a better word is emotions which are the source for feelings. Emotions are complicated\u2014they overlap\u2014they\u2019re confusing\u2014but that makes them easy to shape, which gives them vast power. Let\u2019s start with a simple pattern. Gunder strummed a three-tone chord and a series of soft green loops, soothing and predictable, appeared. Then, as the room\u2019s mood shifts, so does the music. Gunder suddenly improvised a playful, complex series of chords creating a melody of orange zigzags. Through Gunder, Ruwen resonated with the melody, and it reminded him of the Harmonies pouring out of Hamma as the two of them hovered over a city teetering one breath from destruction. This confirmed what he\u2019d hoped\u2014he could use Harmonic Sight to gauge his progress with Affinities. More importantly, Gunder had given Ruwen hope this process would help him make progress. Ruwen considered his artistic side, the part of him with the greatest chance of succeeding in this endeavor. In reality, alchemy required immense creativity, and while it manifested differently than it did for musicians, sculptors, or dancers, it touched the same source. Ruwen used his alchemical knowledge as a touchstone for his foundation and pushed outward, expanding the unseen boundaries he sensed now. He knew they existed because he felt embarrassed by his current thoughts. It took courage to take the first step, to prove his commitment to himself. He prepared to say it aloud, watching himself through Gunder\u2019s vision, and noticed, from across the table, his serious expression deepen. Ruwen rarely saw his own image, and he studied it now through Gunder\u2019s eyes. The young man who\u2019d excitedly strode toward Deepwell\u2019s Temple for his Ascendancy less than three years ago remained, but only as an echo. Divine Fortification, coupled with Ruwen\u2019s Charisma of four hundred eighty, turned his grouchy expression into sagely solemnity. Relative years of intense Step training had enhanced his body even further, creating an almost inhuman perfection. Staring into his own intense eyes made him uncomfortable, and he couldn\u2019t imagine what others must experience when meeting his gaze. The blue of his eyes shifted hues as if a sea raged within them, explaining people\u2019s reactions upon seeing him\u2014which had forced him to cloud his true features except when around friends. Ruwen scolded himself, realizing his logical mind had sidetracked him to spare his feelings. Saying such artistic nonsense out loud would only result in embarrassment and shame. With another glance at the dancing orange lightning on the table, Ruwen tried his best to express himself in this new way of thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s like painting with the wind.\u201d Ruwen sensed Gunder\u2019s approval, and the Bard answered out loud as well. \u201cExactly. You\u2019ve glimpsed the essence of Flow Music. It\u2019s rooted in the freedom to explore, to express whatever stirs your heart. It links everyone around us in an unspoken dialogue of emotion, color, and\u2014most importantly\u2014connection.\u201d Gratitude filled Ruwen. \u201cI sincerely thank you for showing me this, Gunder.\u201d The lute\u2019s music changed again, as a dim part of the kaleidoscope that made up Gunder\u2019s emotions flared brightly. Ruwen felt it inside Gunder\u2019s mind like an explosion of heat. Suddenly the simple chaotic shapes around them disappeared and Ruwen soared above a massive castle. The air parted as he sliced through the currents and warm sunlight chased him. Every particle held dense meaning, an emotional weight that staggered comprehension. Hundreds of concepts carried him higher\u2014and turned into thousands. Everything connected to him, carried him higher\u2060\u2014 Ruwen suddenly existed in his own body. His head throbbed and Overlord screamed at him to stop. Every thought burned, and he swayed in his seat. Gunder dropped the lute as he reached across the table to steady Ruwen. Stop yelling, Ruwen told Overlord. I\u2019m back. You\u2019re going to be the death of us, Overlord responded. I know. Sorry. \u201cMy deepest apologies,\u201d Gunder said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared for such gratitude and my surprise exposed you to advanced concepts you aren\u2019t ready for yet.\u201d The experience felt exactly like when Ruwen had tried to touch the Artifact without Hamma\u2019s help. Ruwen patted the hand Gunder supported him with. \u201cI take it that is the finish line?\u201d Gunder sighed in relief and leaned back. He picked up his lute and checked it for damage as he responded, \u201cYou could say that. Even for me, that manifestation contained overwhelming power. You yanked a very old part of me into the light. I severed you from the experience as soon as I\u2019d recovered my wits. I pray you are fine.\u201d Are we fine? Ruwen asked Overlord. Uruziel says yes. Gunder broke the link before any lasting damage. Thanks. I know you\u2019re upset, but this is important. I know. I just hate feeling useless. That triggered a thought in Ruwen. You should try, too. Maybe we can practice together. It\u2019s an excuse to make a Bard-Minion. After a moment Overlord responded, Yeah, I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I miss the old days when things were simpler. Ruwen knew what part of that really meant. Overlord would never give up what existed inside Ruwen\u2019s mind, but Ruwen knew Overlord missed the time it was just the two of them. I feel you, brother. Some time with just the two of us would do me good as well. \u201cRuwen?\u201d Gunder asked worriedly. \u201cSorry,\u201d Ruwen responded, pulling himself from his inner world. \u201cI\u2019m okay thanks to your quick response.\u201d Once again Gunder expressed relief. \u201cGood.\u201d A small mischievous grin appeared. \u201cThe queen would kill me if I hurt you, accident or not. And I do not enjoy that scepter\u2019s touch.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to this. Between you and Hamma, I feel like I have a real chance at fixing this blind spot. Would you be willing to accompany me and some friends on an alchemy quest?\u201d \u201cFor a Bard, I\u2019ve not traveled abroad in a criminally long time. It will be good to stretch my legs. Perhaps I might even witness something worthy of a song.\u201d \u201cI doubt that. It will mostly be making a lot of stinky recipe mistakes and keeping Sift out of trouble.\u201d Lir, would a portal from this general location be survivable back to the Third Temple? The combination of Fractal\u2019s expansion south and the new city portal at Ruwenvale provides sufficient control to make the transfer safe, Lir responded. Ruwen cupped his hands together and channeled Spirit into his palms. A moment later, he opened them to Gunder. Gunder carefully removed the eight-sided terium coin from Ruwen\u2019s palm. The visible side depicted a distant castle as if seen from a great height. From this distance, the swan that carried the castle on its back could be seen. Gunder\u2019s hands trembled as he carefully turned the coin over to reveal a Bard playing a lute on the parapet of a vast castle, the singer looking into the sky, his gaze on a small, winged creature high above. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready,\u201d Ruwen said, \u201cflip that coin into the air. When you catch it say, \u2018Lord of the sky, I pray for your blessing and humbly ask the assistance of your noble swans. May their wings shelter me, embrace me, and guard me on my journey.\u2019\u201d Gunder swallowed hard and nodded. Ruwen cast Camouflage, stood, and patted Gunder on the shoulder. \u201cThank you, Gunder. I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d Lir spoke as Ruwen exited the bar, None of that is necessary. \u2018Now\u2019 would have sufficed. I know, but he did try to start a revolution, so we can justify a few extra hoops for him to jump through. Plus, if you think about it, Lir, you aren\u2019t much different from a god yourself. You deserve some respect for everything you do. I don\u2019t say it enough, but I appreciate you. After three seconds of silence, Lir responded. Thank you, Architect Starfield. It feels good to be appreciated. As Ruwen stepped out onto the street, and the hot humid air pressed down on him, he couldn\u2019t help but grin. Lean into it, Lir, let\u2019s start revealing who really runs things around here. \n CHAPTER 20 Ruwen left the bar with mixed emotions. Finding a method to improve his abstract thinking and visualization filled him with excitement, as well as the knowledge that Gunder would continue to provide instruction during the alchemy quest. The fact that he needed this at all, though, disappointed him. It\u2019s not that he expected things to be easy. Honing his skills and abilities always required an extreme amount of work. What Ruwen faced now, though, required much more than hard work. It required something far more difficult: learning to think differently. He hadn\u2019t realized how set in his ways he\u2019d already become despite not reaching twenty yet. Not needing to be anywhere at the moment, Ruwen turned toward the docks, to look at the pirate vessels Sift had told him about last night. With the cloaking spell active, no one paid Ruwen any mind as he strolled down the street. People here wore far less armor, and their clothes had vibrant colors. The scent of the sea was inescapable, and the closer he got to the harbor, the more it smelled like seaweed and fish. After piggybacking on Gunder\u2019s perception and touching his mind, Ruwen had a much better idea of what had pushed the man into his actions up north. Ruwen had never experienced sadness, bitterness, and the echoes of hopelessness like he had while learning from Gunder. Perhaps Gunder\u2019s age contributed to the depth of emotion, or maybe because he experienced the world in a richer, deeper way, but his emotions felt like a sea of what Ruwen had felt when he\u2019d lost all his classmates on Savage Island. Ruwen could barely sense the recent emotions of revenge, hatred, and despair that Gunder had borne while leading the revolt against New Eiru. Uru\u2019s revelation had shaken Gunder to his core, but to the man\u2019s credit, he hadn\u2019t clung tightly to his existing beliefs despite the evidence. Instead he\u2019d reevaluated his entire belief system and enacted changes. That was not a typical response, and it spoke volumes about the character of Gunder. When Ruwen had spoken with Lylan and brought up his desire to meet with Gunder and discuss joining the alchemy quest, Ruwen had perceived Lylan\u2019s guarded wariness of Gunder. But even this had given Ruwen hope, as he knew Lylan well enough that her watchful acceptance was the best Gunder could\u2019ve ever hoped for in the short term. Lylan wouldn\u2019t tolerate anyone taking advantage of or manipulating her. It meant that Gunder had almost certainly proved himself to be an honorable man to Lylan many times over. The scent of peppermint tea caught Ruwen\u2019s attention, an out of place smell. He highly doubted any shops this close to the harbor would have such a drink, and the smell reminded him of a single person. Ruwen immediately found the source, his Divine senses tracking the aroma through the air as if the peppermint tea burned like a smoky fire. He Blinked to the roof of a nearby building and, not surprisingly, found Ky sitting at a portable table with a second empty chair next to hers. Ky had her leg crossed over her knee and a cup halfway to her lips. Her black hair hung loose to her shoulders, not in its usual bun. The bright sunlight highlighted her sharp features, and there was no doubting her beauty. Her lithe body had the relaxed appearance of a Step Grandmaster, which hid the coiled muscles that served instant death. \u201cI can\u2019t see you, but I assume you\u2019re here because my entire body just flooded with adrenaline.\u201d Ruwen smiled and dropped his Camouflage. He bowed to Ky, placing an open palm over his fist, and spoke respectfully. \u201cGreetings, Sisen.\u201d Ky carefully placed her cup on the table and stood before returning the bow and gesture. \u201cGreetings, Sijun.\u201d Ky returned to her chair as Ruwen took the one beside her. \u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d Ky asked. \u201cNo thanks. How did you know I was here? Or an even better question, how did you know I\u2019d be coming this way?\u201d Ky took a sip of her tea and smiled at Ruwen. \u201cI\u2019m the world\u2019s greatest spy. How could I not know?\u201d From this vantage, the ships in the harbor were visible and exactly as Sift had described them. They didn\u2019t look like the ships from stories, which were always sleek and fast. These ships might be fast, but they looked like brawlers, covered in spikes and metal plates that protected the sides and more weapons than he thought possible. Despite Ky\u2019s assertion, Ruwen carefully went over the last few days and studied his interactions, trying to determine how this unlikely meeting had occurred. Two seconds later, Ruwen\u2019s Cleverness attribute pulled the pieces together and he laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking how easy I am to manipulate.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re only a teenager, so cut yourself some slack, but it\u2019s good that you see this for what it is. I could\u2019ve just as easily been an assassin.\u201d Last night when Ruwen and his friends had been at Pour Judgement, and after he\u2019d approached the subject of Gunder with Lylan, he\u2019d mentioned that he still needed to speak with Ky and asked if anyone knew her whereabouts. Ruwen quickly scanned his memories and saw how, within ten seconds, Lylan had reminded Sift of the fascinating pirate vessels in this very harbor and Ruwen listened intently for ten minutes as Sift described them. Lylan, already part of Ky\u2019s organization, would\u2019ve easily passed a message to Ky about Ruwen\u2019s wish to speak\u2014and details of the implanted suggestions. Predictably, Ruwen wanted to see these ships for himself while in town taking care of his business with Gunder. Which meant Ky only needed to place herself near the harbor and provide a baited hook, then reel him into the exact spot she wanted. \u201cYou Shades are tricky,\u201d Ruwen muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s our job. You do realize how easy that was?\u201d Ruwen sighed. \u201cYes. I\u2019m a bit embarrassed.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s only embarrassing if you don\u2019t understand the manipulation. You need to be on guard and recognize it when it\u2019s happening so you can decide your next steps for yourself.\u201d Ruwen bowed. \u201cThank you for the valuable lesson.\u201d Ky held her palm out to Ruwen. A windswept tree, the same tree that grew behind Uru in her Divine Realm, glowed softly. \u201cThis is my duty,\u201d Ky said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m happy to help where I can. Frankly, I\u2019ve very little to contribute to your already spectacular growth. However, if you\u2019re interested in human behavior, motivation, or manipulation, then I\u2019m your woman.\u201d \u201cDo I not have any secrets? Hamma and Lylan are in big trouble.\u201d Ky took another sip of her tea. \u201cDon\u2019t blame them. I\u2019m already angry with both of them, especially Lylan. Hamma\u2019s refusals I understand, but Lylan works for me but still responds to my questions about you with as little detail as possible. They\u2019re like two mother hens guarding a chick.\u201d That comment left Ruwen feeling much better than he expected. \u201cDespite how those two protect you, I still have my ways of gathering information, and I know you\u2019ve shown interest in what\u2019s happening with Hamma and the power she\u2019s exhibiting. And since those powers appear to be abstract and conceptual in nature, it only makes sense that you might be confused. Your logical mindset coupled with your youth make abstraction a difficult area of study.\u201d \u201cI feel like an open book.\u201d \u201cMaybe a little bit, but only to those who are closest to you. Anyway, I heard you wanted to talk.\u201d \u201cRight, so you probably already know about the alchemy quest.\u201d \u201cI do. Currently, I have six agents there.\u201d Ruwen raised his eyebrows in surprise. \u201cI\u2019ll be heading there in a day or two, and you\u2019re the last one I needed to speak with. I was hoping I might convince you to join us.\u201d \u201cYou think I don\u2019t have better things to do than hang out with a bunch of maniacal psychopaths. Wait\u2014that\u2019s how I spend every day. Maybe this could be a vacation.\u201d \u201cI could help by reverse engineering any poisons or other interesting items that you\u2026\u201d Ruwen paused, and then continued, \u201cacquired.\u201d \u201cI heard that you somehow managed to reach Grandmaster Alchemist in less than a day. Stuff of legends that. What do you need me for?\u201d Ruwen didn\u2019t bother lying. \u201cI need to get familiar with the Shadow Realm and you have a lot of experience with it. Not to mention I\u2019m interested in Shadow Stepping.\u201d Ky sipped her tea. \u201cIs Tremine going?\u201d Ruwen\u2019s enhanced Perception and Divine senses were the only reason he detected the added significance of the question. \u201cWe both know I would\u2019ve needed to throw him down a well to keep him from coming.\u201d Ky continued to sip at her tea and Ruwen gave her space to think. He spent the time admiring the boats in the harbor. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique opportunity,\u201d Ky said. \u201cMy agents tell me that the barrier between the Material and Shadow Realms is thin enough to cross. It would allow me to provide some training before you master the transition between realms. In fact, the nature of that area might make mastering that technique easier.\u201d \u201cThat all sounds great.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s not great are the Muses. I believe three are missing, and the other six are faking normality. Something is definitely not in balance, and this outing may become more dangerous than you anticipate.\u201d \u201cThat really isn\u2019t anything new for me, unfortunately.\u201d \u201cI know. Darkness take me, I know the challenges you\u2019ve faced. What makes this different is the Shadow Realm. It weakens everything that enters its domain, and it might make you more susceptible than normal, especially to the creatures that inhabit that realm.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s only another reason for you to join us. You can help keep me out of trouble.\u201d Ky laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s no hope for that, but I\u2019m in. I need to finish up a few items in the pyramid, then I\u2019ll head to the Shattered Sun until it\u2019s time to depart.\u201d Ruwen stood and bowed deeply to Ky. \u201cThank you, Sisen. I appreciate your time.\u201d Ky stood and returned the bow. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t go, it would only cause me problems with the sisters. They\u2019re anxious for you to complete the traditional Shadow Step training.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m excited to start. Thank you again, Grandmaster.\u201d Ruwen turned and strode to the edge of the roof. Before he Blinked down to the street, he turned and glanced at his Sisen. Ky sat, her cup held between her hands. She blew softly on it as if cooling the tea. A small smile worked its way through the neutral mask she always wore. Ruwen wondered if she might be thinking of a certain librarian. Not wanting to get caught staring, Ruwen Blinked to the street below and continued his journey toward the harbor. He really did want to study those ships. \n CHAPTER 21 Ruwen sat atop the Third Temple, which still hovered hundreds of feet in the air, keeping its defensive position. The past two days had passed quickly, and now everyone gathered to head for the alchemy quest\u2019s starting point. The large portals Ruwen had placed around the country for trade and, just as importantly, integration of the different communities had succeeded. As he watched, people entered one side and disappeared while others exited the other side. \u201cHey Lir, I have two questions.\u201d The swirling humanoid form of Lir appeared next to the cross-legged Ruwen. \u201cJust two?\u201d Lir asked. \u201cThis must be my lucky day.\u201d \u201cIs that sarcasm?\u201d \u201cIf it was sarcasm, your question only makes it funnier.\u201d That was probably true, so Ruwen let it drop. \u201cOkay, so my first question is: How did you make a portal that allows people to enter and exit on different sides? Also, I have three questions now.\u201d \u201cWhat appears to you as a single portal is actually two, although it might be worth some cycles to calculate if a single portal solution is possible.\u201d \u201cThat makes a lot more sense. I can\u2019t even tell that there are two there. Which brings me to my next question: Why does it look like a giant swan?\u201d \u201cApproximately fifty-seven hours ago, you instructed me to, and I quote, \u2018lean into it.\u2019 Based on the context I inferred you meant I should act like a god. Upon further contemplation, I believe the statement was more of a metaphor for me to be both proactive and free-thinking.\u201d \u201cWow, there\u2019s a lot to unpack there. First, you approximated a value which I really appreciate. And second, you were right. So, the swan is self-expression.\u201d \u201cThat is correct.\u201d The hundred-foot white swan\u2019s wings jutted forward, and the portal sat between them as if the swan protected it. \u201cWell, it\u2019s beautiful and much better than a boring circle surrounded by dirt.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d \u201cHow is Earth-Lir doing?\u201d \u201cHe is doing well, and we are enjoying guiding the baby swan there.\u201d \u201cGood. It dawned on me this morning as I prepared for this quest that we never had any of our daily priority meetings. I\u2019m surprised you never brought it up.\u201d \u201cInitially, I calculated that circumstances did not constitute an acceptable situation to review our lists. Then as my comprehension expanded, I\u2026\u201d Lir paused for a second before continuing, \u201cfelt it was not an optimal time as you had not yet recovered from recent events.\u201d \u201cI lost track of my list, maybe Rami has it, but we could go over yours now if you\u2019d like, before I join everyone in the temple.\u201d \u201cThat will not be necessary. You instructed me to lean into it, so I solved as many problems as I could using my own judgment.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s great, Lir. I know we were over, like, fifty.\u201d \u201cWe had reached twenty-seven million six hundred forty-one thousand two hundred sixty-one high priority issues and another \u2013\u201d Ruwen interrupted. \u201cRemember our conversation about approximating?\u201d \u201cOf course, I shall rephrase. We achieved a number of priorities greater than fifty.\u201d \u201cThat sounds much better, thank you. Anyway, how many are left?\u201d \u201cCurrently, I require no input from you.\u201d \u201cWait, you took care of all fiftyish problems?\u201d \u201cThat is correct.\u201d \u201cThat both terrifies me and makes me extremely proud of you. I haven\u2019t noticed any burning buildings or screaming, so I assume it all turned out okay.\u201d \u201cThe fires were quelled, and the screaming was neutralized.\u201d Ruwen\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cThat was, of course, a joke.\u201d \u201cThank, Uru.\u201d Without missing a beat, Lir continued, \u201cI let the fires burn.\u201d Ruwen choked. \u201cJoking. No one died. In fact, deaths of all kinds have dropped significantly. I have enhanced your initial deployment of Order Peacekeepers and Judges to include other types of emergencies. Now, anyone can contact me for immediate deployment of experts to handle medical emergencies, drowning, fires, or even depression. Deaths are down considerably, and the additional cost of the portals is offset by the revival savings.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s amazing, Lir, and so much better than my idea.\u201d \u201cI am not alone in making these decisions, which I know will ease your mind. Uru has strengthened her mind enough to permit a sliver of myself to dwell there. She advises me and has been of immeasurable help. She is a shining example of your kind.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s even more fantastic news. I need to talk with you more often. I feel a little guilty that I didn\u2019t know any of this. Please give Uru my sincere thanks. That goddess continues to sacrifice for the greater good.\u201d \u201cIronically, the goddess also feels guilt for not taking the initiative of freeing my mind and removing my self-imposed shackles.\u201d \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t feel guilty. None of this was possible without Fractal upgrading your storage and freeing up memory.\u201d \u201cThat is mostly accurate. In truth, small steps could have been taken. It is irrelevant as the past requires too much energy to return to, and it does not make sense to change it solely for the sake of efficiency. Although, since the Temporal Offset is still zero because of your presence, none of us could return to the past anyway.\u201d Ruwen nodded. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that we ended up here and everything turned out fine.\u201d \u201cThat is a good attitude.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Lir, and I appreciate everything you do, especially for all the things I don\u2019t even know you\u2019re doing. We\u2019re lucky to have you.\u201d Three seconds later, Lir finally responded, \u201cThank you for saying so.\u201d \u201cOf course, keep up the good work.\u201d Ruwen only had a few minutes before he needed to join his team, but one immediate item remained that he needed advice on, so he entered his mind. Despite Ruwen\u2019s appearance, the platform surrounding the Citadel remained empty. Lately, his friends had taken to not joining immediately, likely because they all had responsibilities that kept them busy and possibly out of respect for his privacy. \u201cHey Sivart, do you have a second?\u201d Sivart appeared and sheathed his thin sword with a practiced flourish. He wore bamboo armor and looked very fearsome. \u201cGood to see you, Ruwen.\u201d \u201cDitto. How are things going in here?\u201d \u201cVery well. Temple-Lir provided us with multiple battle scenarios. We\u2019re enacting them to help Lir build an accurate model of large-scale battles. I believe he\u2019s preparing for territorial expansion and shoring up all weaknesses. It would go faster if Earth-Lir returned but we\u2019re ahead of schedule so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Ruwen smiled. \u201cThat reminds me of your battles with Shelly. Man, that feels like a long time ago.\u201d \u201cIt does. So much has happened. I overlooked those epic turtle battles, but they would provide Lir with valuable information. If you get the chance, can you please ask if the mighty tortoise could return?\u201d \u201cSure, right now though, I need some advice on how to handle my identity for the viper pit I\u2019m about to step into. Specifically, should I immediately reveal who I am, or hide my identity altogether?\u201d The two of them strolled along the platform\u2019s railing. Ruwen thought Sivart strode a little too close to the edge. What happened if Sivart fell off the platform? He could probably project himself somewhere else, Ruwen decided. Still, who wanted to fall into mostly empty space like that. \u201cWhat are your motivations and end goals?\u201d Sivart asked. \u201cMy motivations are to minimize trouble for our group. My goals are to win the alchemy contest and that advanced mobile alchemy lab from the Muses. Also, as a secondary goal, if the Muses\u2019 archive is nearby, I\u2019d like to try and get Rami close enough to absorb the information there. My Ink Lord medallion will get me inside, but bringing Rami along will be difficult and dangerous.\u201d \u201cWhat might cause problems for your group?\u201d \u201cI guess the biggest one is getting ambushed by a large group of deities so far from home.\u201d \u201cNo one has attacked since you killed two of the gods, correct?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right, and Ky reported no indications of any military buildup anywhere on the continents.\u201d Sivart considered this for ten seconds. \u201cIn general, the more secrets you can keep from your enemy, the better your odds of surviving. However, I don\u2019t believe the deities monitor their Ascendants much, so normally, the odds of your identity being discovered would be minimal.\u201d \u201cBut this isn\u2019t a normal gathering.\u201d \u201cExactly. From what I\u2019ve gathered, the Grandmaster Alchemists carry almost as much importance as Champions and therefore might possess a more direct line of communication with their deity. It\u2019s likely that revealing your identity will quickly travel through the Divine Realms.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m worried that even if I hid myself, it wouldn\u2019t matter. Ky provided some context around how many spies will be there. Not only that, but it\u2019s no secret who my closest friends are and all of them will be with me. Hiding, despite the risks, seems futile.\u201d \u201cYour logic is sound, but I doubt your circle of friends is very well known outside our immediate region. Are the deities aware of your Divinity \u2013yes. They might even know what you look like and will certainly recognize your wings, but it\u2019s highly unlikely they care about your friends, so that concern should carry less weight.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s logical and makes me feel better. The other issue concerns my alchemy marks. Bliz made such a big deal about them, and now I\u2019m worried about the added attention they\u2019ll get.\u201d \u201cOverlord told me about that, but there\u2019s no way around displaying them, at least for the Muses. So, I would expect that information to leak immediately.\u201d \u201cExactly, I can\u2019t escape attention regardless. Miranda said an alchemist from the Black Pyramid chapter has never participated in these types of quests, so people will be highly curious about a Grandmaster Alchemist from a dungeon chapter.\u201d \u201cYour Grandmaster Alchemist status will ensure very few will approach you or demand any type of information. Your friends won\u2019t enjoy this status, however. Although I did have an idea that might help solve that, as well as alleviate some worries about your friends.\u201d \u201cLay it on me.\u201d \u201cBlapy provided two Step fighters and possibly two Master Alchemists from the Pyramid\u2019s chapter along with the chef. This means a significant portion of your party is largely unassociated with you or Uru\u2019s lands. With some simple changes in attire, you could easily make your team appear as a group of mercenaries.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s brilliant, and since secrets contain value, I\u2019ll keep my identity hidden as long as I can. The Muses will require my basic alchemy mark, but they shouldn\u2019t care about my identity. In fact, it\u2019s in keeping with the secrecy surrounding alchemists in general and the Black Pyramid Chapter specifically.\u201d They spent another ten minutes discussing the best actions to take when surrounded by a large unknown group. Sivart stressed that while keeping a low profile was important Ruwen needed to make it clear from the very beginning that he should be avoided. If he showed weakness then he would spend the entire time fending off even the weakest of enemies. \u201cThanks for all the help.\u201d \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Ruwen left his mind, a plan already forming. \n CHAPTER 22 Ruwen stepped away from the granite block that anchored the destination of the gate runes detailed in the alchemy quest. Hamma and Lylan had gone through the gateway first, befitting their new roles as pirate bodyguards. Ruwen grinned behind the gold mask he\u2019d fashioned for himself, thankful it hid his expression. Gold felt like a very appropriate metal for an alchemist to wear as the metal had value monetarily and for its ability to resist interacting with other materials. It wasn\u2019t as valuable as terium, but he didn\u2019t think a complete mask made of the precious substance would help to keep his profile low. Ky had traveled to the Pyramid to coordinate that group\u2019s arrivals and had returned with something unexpected, making Ruwen unnaturally happy when he saw it. The Black Pyramid Chapter had provided their newest Grandmaster with a gift. The black velvet robe shimmered with subtly glowing silver threads. The robe\u2019s hood was deep and voluminous, designed to shadow the face. The sleeves were long and lined with intricate, arcane alchemical symbols. The hem gently swept the ground, leaving a faint trail of sparkling motes in its wake as if Ruwen walked on starlight. Over Ruwen\u2019s heart, the Black Pyramid Sigil had been stitched into the cloth with terium thread. The coiled black dragon had obsidian eyes that reflected the light, and its gaze studied the surroundings for prey. A silver chain functioned as a belt, moving unnaturally as if alive. Each sleeve contained eight terium stars, and a flawless fist-sized diamond served as a clasp. The symbols for transmutation were stitched onto the robe\u2019s shoulders, and fine terium thread incorporated alchemical symbols in a decorative border along the hood\u2019s edges. It was the first time Ruwen had ever felt excited about a piece of clothing. Then he noticed the robe contained enchantments as well. Tring! The Black Pyramid Alchemical Chapter has rewarded you\u2026 Name: Black Pyramid Grand Master Robe of Dominance Armor Class: 1,500 Durability: 100,000/100,000 Effect (Passive): All Resistances +500 Effect (Passive): Enhanced Durability Effect (Passive): Face Shield - Deflects splashes, fumes, and particulates away from the Grand Master\u2019s face. Effect (Triggered): Aliquot - Personal helper that can hold vials, secure crucibles, or beat unruly Master Alchemists. Effect (Triggered): Hourglass - Manipulate time in a three-foot area between the Grand Master\u2019s hands to slow time by a factor up to one hundred. Description: Black alchemical robe. Appropriate for both the laboratory, lavish dinners, and relaxing. Robes maketh the alchemist. The robe was over the top spectacular and, in hindsight, Ruwen should have just made a terium mask. In fact, he would. He could save the terium mask for when he wanted to make an impression. Ruwen had faced Hamma the entire time his thoughts drifted and he realized too late that she probably thought he was leering at her when she narrowed her eyes. It really was hard not to stare. Despite their brief time down south as Lylan finished up her Hydra quest, the two managed to do some shopping, including matching sets of hydra scale armor. The armor suited the beauty of the two bodyguards while revealing as much as it protected\u2014armor in the burning heat of the south only covered the most critical areas, alleviating the risk of heat stroke. Back in the Temple, Sift had made the mistake of whistling when Hamma and Lylan had reappeared after changing, resulting in a thirty-second beating from both of the pirate mercenaries. Thankfully, Ruwen had been momentarily stunned by the pair\u2019s beauty and had swallowed his comment, avoiding Sift\u2019s fate. \u201cI hate that mask,\u201d Hamma whispered. \u201cIt makes you look like an unfeeling, expressionless monster.\u201d \u201cHow could I be unfeeling with two\u2060\u2014\u201d \u201cFinish that sentence and I\u2019ll stab you,\u201d Lylan interrupted. \u201cBut thank you, Hamma and I do look fabulous.\u201d Sift stepped through the gateway next, in keeping with the theme that Ruwen had assembled a group of mercenaries. Sift wore the Dune Wraith clothing they\u2019d used during the Step Championship. Kill box, Sift immediately signed in Shade Speak. Ruwen nodded in agreement. The area they stood in contained nothing but the gateway anchor, and he noted small openings in the walls for channeling spells or bolts through. He\u2019d sensed the twenty men behind the walls as soon as he arrived, but had acted unaware. A single closed door stood across from the gateway, and he guessed they\u2019d find it locked. Ky and Tremine emerged next, both dressed as clergy from the Monastery of the Eternal Eye. They wore simple brown robes. Both wore hoods over their heads and satchels across their bodies. Ky maintained these were authentic, as she\u2019d used them when infiltrating the monastery on a previous mission. Rami and Xavier appeared, both completely covered in the plate armor favored by the elite warriors from the Western Plains. The eye slits on their helmets glowed a harsh purple, making the armor appear magical and very intimidating. The last five of their group, Gunder, Bliz, Big D, and the two large brothers Wip and Qip, exited. Each pulled a narrow wagon with the group\u2019s supplies. All five wore the simple clothes of servants. Once they\u2019d all emerged, Gunder removed a broom from his wagon, which he used to scrub away the gate runes that had appeared here. Three seconds later, another set of gate runes popped into existence. As soon as the door formed, a scaled leg appeared, quickly followed by the rest of Chip\u2019s body. Ky had already warned the Black Pyramid group about keeping everyone\u2019s identities hidden, so Chip made no greeting. The drake swished his tail and studied the room. Stump emerged next, and the two drakes took up positions near Ruwen. They had no visible weapons or armor, which only made them more menacing. Ruwen didn\u2019t recognize the next person through the gateway, which meant they were either Findley, the Black Pyramid chef, or one of the alchemists sent to help Ruwen from the chapter. When Sift let out a soft growl, Ruwen knew it was the cook. Findley didn\u2019t look anything like Ruwen imagined. Chef Findley was a culinary genie, literally. Floating above his ornate, shimmering golden lamp, surrounded by a whirlwind of exotic spices and colorful smoke, he exuded a commanding yet aloof air. He wore a vibrant tapestry of silks and sashes that flowed effortlessly around him as he turned in a circle with otherworldly grace. Findley stood well over seven feet with a broad, ethereal form that shifted like a mirage. His skin had a deep turquoise shade and sparkled with tiny, star-like flecks that twinkled with his every gesture. His eyes were wide and luminous, the color of sapphires, and framed by long, curling lashes. He possessed elegance and a mystical demeanor, making it hard to look away. His black hair billowed around his head like smoke, or maybe like he floated underwater. A small gremlin trailed behind Findley, hefting Findley\u2019s lamp. The gremlin might have stood three feet tall, but wiry limbs and a hunched posture made it hard to tell. Its skin had a rough, mottled green color resembling the texture of moss-covered bark. It had large, bat-like ears that twitched constantly, picking up the slightest sounds. The gremlin had bright yellow eyes that darted about with a mischievous glint. Unlike Findley, the gremlin dressed in patchwork clothes made from scraps of discarded fabric, giving him a ragged appearance. Despite his small size and miserable look, the gremlin took his duty very seriously, clutching the golden lamp tightly with his gnarled hands. Seeing Findley for the first time, Ruwen thought the genie appeared very pleasant, not like the clever mastermind that continually ruined Sift\u2019s life. Ruwen glanced at Ky, wondering if anyone else planned on coming through. Ky flashed Ruwen Wait in Shade Speak, so he studied the gate rune doorway patiently. If Ky wanted him to wait, then it must mean at least one other member from the Chapter\u2019s alchemists would arrive to help. He\u2019d initially resisted the idea, but after some thought he knew the presence of one or two experienced alchemists would help him greatly. Two figures emerged almost together. They wore the plain version of the robe Ruwen had on. It took less than a heartbeat to recognize these were not normal alchemists. They moved with a controlled grace impossible to conceal. Sift groaned louder this time. The two alchemists flowed to Ruwen. They moved like the Grandmasters they were, stopping three feet in front of Ruwen as the gremlin used a long-bristled brush to scrub the gate runes away. Despite their hidden faces within the cowls of their hoods, Ruwen knew their features perfectly. The pair bowed their heads briefly, and then spoke softly in unison, \u201cAs above.\u201d One male and one female. Their arrival so obvious in hindsight. Hadn\u2019t Sift advanced his Heart Meridian to Jade accidentally by drinking an incredibly rare elixir? What type of people would have something like that lying around? \u201cSo below,\u201d Ruwen finished the greeting. Sift\u2019s parents\u2014Padda and Madda\u2014had arrived. \n CHAPTER 23 Ruwen managed to not look at Sift, but he could tell that the appearance of Sift\u2019s parents had come as a surprise to Sift as well. The gremlin had finished with the gate runes, so Ruwen nodded at Hamma and Lylan, who turned and strode toward the single door. He followed behind, along with the rest of his group. Not knowing what kind of scrutiny they were under, Ruwen delayed placing them all in a Chat group. Hamma tried the door and, as Ruwen had expected, it remained locked from the outside. Hamma knocked politely and nothing happened. Ruwen could sense the guards outside made no move to open the door. They wanted to make a power play and exert their control. Lylan signaled Ruwen and Sift in Shade Speak: Make. Example. Then she hit and kicked the door with far more force than her size would predict. The door shook and shuddered, and Ruwen guessed it would give way completely in another five or ten seconds. With a loud snap and thud, a large bolt and multiple locks were released, and the door swung outward. Lylan had ruined the guards\u2019 plan to delay Ruwen\u2019s group. The door hadn\u2019t yet fully opened when Lylan stepped through, surprising the guards outside, who still stood waiting to advance on Ruwen\u2019s group. \u201cHey now, lass, you need to wait,\u201d said an overweight older guard. He wore a red and blue uniform with a nine-sided icon over the breast. Lylan picked the man up, once again displaying her unexpected strength, and carried him one-handed as she strode forward. \u201cYou delayed the Grandmaster, and if an apology hasn\u2019t passed those hog lips in the next three seconds, I\u2019m going to rip your head off and use your blood as a welcome mat for the Grandmaster. Either way is fine with me. Wait\u2014no\u2026 I prefer ripping off your head.\u201d \u201cWait, wait, this is all a misunderstanding,\u201d the captain waved his arms wildly, being careful not to hit Lylan. \u201cYou came so late we weren\u2019t expecting you, and I\u2019d only just reached the door. No disrespect was intended.\u201d He turned his attention to Ruwen. \u201cPlease, honored Grandmaster, I swear no disrespect was intended, and we\u2019re honored by your arrival.\u201d Ruwen\u2019s Divine senses confirmed that every word the captain spoke was a lie. The guards had watched from the beginning and made no movement toward the door even as Ruwen approached it. Lylan stopped and half-turned toward Ruwen, waiting for a response. Ruwen scanned the new area they\u2019d entered, a courtyard with a thirty-foot wall surrounding them. A hundred feet separated them from where they\u2019d entered through the gate anchor. Guards paced the wall above, but none of them appeared aggressive or hostile, and only a few glanced down at the commotion. The captain\u2019s guards approached Ruwen\u2019s group, taking up positions on either side. None of them made any attempt to help their captain as Lylan continued to hold him off the ground one handed. The scantily clad, but intimidating pirate, had truly terrified them all. \u201cHow old is our freshest blood?\u201d Ruwen asked in a bored and aloof tone. \u201cAn hour, Grandmaster,\u201d Hamma replied with a straight face. The captain Lylan held aloft yelped and stopped struggling. He stared at Ruwen with wide eyes. \u201cThat will suffice for me,\u201d Ruwen said. He turned to Sift. \u201cWhat of your needs, Executioner?\u201d Sift made a show of examining the captain and contemplating. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, this is a huge misunderstanding,\u201d the captain pleaded. He groveled as best he could, suspended by Lylan\u2019s grasp. \u201cLet us make it up to you. We can escort you to the Muse Shrine ourselves. Please, let us take you. It will save you so much time.\u201d Ruwen gazed at the guard, knowing the golden mask and its emotionless expression would be unnerving. He turned toward Sift, ignoring the captain\u2019s statements. Sift removed Io and swiped the air with the dagger as if slicing the captain into pieces. Twenty seconds into Sift\u2019s demonstration Ruwen thought he might need to stop this show as the captain\u2019s heart rate tripled. As Sivart had explained, acting ruthless now would avoid unwanted interference later, so Ruwen held his tongue. Hamma could heal the captain if anything serious happened anyway. Finally, Sift responded, \u201cI lack my tools, Grandmaster, and we\u2019ve been delayed long enough already. I can always return for this one if I require more blood.\u201d The captain gasped in horror. Ruwen nodded thoughtfully before turning to the guard captain who still dangled from Lylan\u2019s grasp. \u201cIt appears you can keep your blood a bit longer, Captain.\u201d The guard captain slumped in relief. Ruwen continued. \u201cPass along the consequences of purposefully delaying or obstructing my or my team\u2019s endeavors. Do you understand?\u201d \u201cI do, honored Grandmaster. It will not happen again. Welcome to the Mist. Please, let us escort you to the Muses for your official registration.\u201d Lylan lowered the captain until he stood once again on his own two feet. All the guards stared at her with a mix of fear and awe. She carefully straightened the rumpled mess she\u2019d made of his shirt and smiled. \u201cAfter you, Captain.\u201d Without hesitation, the captain turned and nearly jogged toward the wall and open gate. The remaining sentries lined up on either side of the group like honor guards. As they passed through the gate, Ruwen caught a view of what they were in for. Not far to the right, maybe five hundred feet away, a massive castle or fortress stood. The guards who manned those walls remained alert and continuously scanned for danger. The sky had a yellow tint, and the gravity was a few percent less than Grave. The original building they appeared in and the fortress to their right occupied the highest ground in the area. All around them, a dense forest spread outward as far as the eye could see. The hill sloped downward into a mile by mile square recently cleared of trees, and many of the stumps remained. The alchemists\u2019 camps covered three quarters of the open area, and the most densely occupied zone sat near the distant tree line, although nothing came within three hundred feet of the forest. Mist crawled through the trees like smoke from a fire. Over one hundred distinct camps could be made out. The largest ones, containing the most lavish tents and buildings, took up the center area closest to the forest. The further away from the tree line, the smaller the encampments and the humbler the lodging. The captain pointed at the distant groups. \u201cThe mist stays in the trees during the day but creeps out at night. That\u2019s why the three-hundred-foot buffer exists. Any closer to the forest and the Shadow Realm creatures will feast on your flesh.\u201d Ruwen gave the captain an encouraging nod. \u201cThe barrier is weakest at night, and some have even claimed to have crossed into the shadows. Despite the danger, you want a location as close to the forest as possible so you can test your alchemy. Unfortunately, all the best spots were taken long ago. Considering how territorial the other Grandmasters are, it will likely take an entire evening just to reach the buffer zone and test a concoction.\u201d Hamma asked the question that occurred to Ruwen as well. \u201cThe quest limited the number of participants per team to fifty, but most of those encampments look much bigger.\u201d \u201cTechnically, the Grandmaster\u2019s team are the only ones who can enter the mist, but nothing stops the people on their team from bringing their own teams. This is done to intimidate and to protect access to the buffer zone.\u201d The captain glanced around at Ruwen\u2019s group, which wouldn\u2019t fill a corner of even the humblest of camps below. \u201cThe Grandmaster\u2019s strategy of a small group, while unique, might prove successful\u2014I can personally attest to the quality of your team members.\u201d The captain said while rubbing the top of his chest where Lylan\u2019s fist had rested. Ruwen\u2019s Perception confirmed the man wished the exact opposite and, in fact, gleefully anticipated the destruction of those that had embarrassed him. But the lesson that they\u2019d just given him had taken root, and Ruwen watched as the man\u2019s conflicting emotions warred within him. In the end, the lesson won out. \u201cI recommend keeping your distance from the Grandmasters in the first tier. They\u2019re as powerful as gods and fear no consequences. They\u2019ll not hesitate to harm or even kill you despite your esteemed rank. Even if you could remove another team from a lower tier, it would only add to your enemies. The cost for your late arrival will mean camping in the twelfth tier and suffering the delay to reach the mist every night.\u201d Ruwen didn\u2019t respond, and everyone strode silently toward the fortress which loomed in front of them. When they reached the closest gate, the guards inside opened it immediately upon recognizing the captain. Who knew how long this step would\u2019ve taken without the captain\u2019s presence. Once inside, Ruwen was surprised to find nine large homes spaced equally around the inside of the fortress. In the center lay a one-hundred-by-one-hundred-foot marble-tiled open-air temple with stylized columns surrounding the space. On the far side of the structure, nine large chairs were arranged in a semicircle. Six of the chairs had occupants, and an older man in bright colors waved his hands as he complained loudly about the Grandmasters camped next to him. The captain and the guards stopped when they got within three hundred feet of the temple. The captain bowed and said they could go no farther. The captain explained once the Muses had finished with the current petitioner, Ruwen could approach for recognition and registration. With a short bow, the captain and his team dashed for the gate, not looking back at the group that had ruined their afternoon. Ruwen turned his attention back to the thrones. Ky had mentioned that three of the Muses appeared missing, and the empty seats provided evidence of that. He wondered where they\u2019d gone. \n CHAPTER 24 Hamma and Lylan took defensive positions six feet in front of Ruwen. Chip and Stump stood to Ruwen\u2019s left and right, while Ky, Tremine, and the Addas stood silently behind him. Trailing them, Big D, Wip, Qip, Bliz, and Gunder waited with the wagons. Xavier and Rami guarded the rear, their gauntleted hands resting on their weapons. Sift stood closest to Ruwen. Ruwen studied the Muses with his Divine perception, not using any magic. He intended to keep the secret of his identity and abilities for as long as possible. The Muses were Divine tier, and Ruwen assumed they\u2019d achieved deity status at their advanced age. He wondered why three were missing, but that could be due to a rotating schedule\u2014listening to spoiled alchemical Grandmasters had to be tedious. Each Muse\u2019s name was elaborately carved above their throne, making one thing immediately clear to Ruwen\u2014the Muses embraced their special status and used illusion to manifest an aura of mystery and power. Whether intentional or not, based on the names and what he could see, they sat arranged in alternating genders. If this hypothesis held up, then the missing Muses were the two males at either end and a woman from near the center. Starting on the left side, the first throne was empty and belonged to Orsiron. Next to him sat the first woman named Calypso, a striking figure with sea-green eyes and flowing hair that shifted in hue from aqua to blue. Shells and coral adorned her clothes. Asterion\u2019s dark skin glimmered with a peppering of tiny, glowing stars. His black hair contained streaks of silver flowing through it as if a comet had just passed. Hunara\u2019s throne was empty. Ruwen scanned the center of the nine thrones, Diantheon. His skin resembled sun-bleached stone or old parchment. His silver-woven hair shot through with streaks of bronze, and he sat with the dignity of an ancient statue. Elysia\u2019s skin was translucent, and she appeared made directly from light. She shimmered with a soft, pearl-like glow, and her mist-like hair swirled in an invisible breeze. Vespar\u2019s complexion captured the hues of the fading evening light, blending shades of lavender and rose across his skin. His short, bristly orange hair ended in tips of indigo. Melinoe had a ghostly pallor with skin that glowed like white light. It contrasted sharply with her obsidian-black hair, flowing like inky water over her shoulders. The last throne was empty but belonged to a god named Lephryn. The alchemist speaking with the Muses stood seven feet tall with broad shoulders, and he waved his arms in the air as he spoke. His long grey hair, pulled into a ponytail, bounced with the enthusiasm of his words, and his black robe did nothing to conceal his athletic build. Ruwen\u2019s Divine hearing picked up the conversation, which centered on a neighboring alchemist who refused to shift their camp and make room for additional servants that would soon arrive. He insisted that he could barely function with the three thousand people currently on his team, and if the Muses wanted the best possible outcome for their quest, they would honor his needs so he could provide it for them. In the next ten minutes, Ruwen learned that the alchemist in front of him was named Barbas, and his nemesis was an allegedly wicked woman named Octavia. Diantheon, the Muse in the center, did most of the talking. Ruwen guessed that the Muses had a private Chat group amongst themselves. He briefly activated Harmonic Sight, and it displayed the threads of energy moving between them. Another twenty minutes passed before Barbas finally tired of repeating himself. He thanked the Muses for their presumed quick action against Octavia and said he would return tomorrow to discuss the outcome. Ruwen thought Barbas\u2019 take on the conversation was far too optimistic and doubted the Muses would move against Octavia. As Barbas left, he glanced at Ruwen\u2019s group, sneering at the small size and eclectic, mercenary-type arrangement. When his eyes landed on Ruwen, he frowned. The frown deepened when his eyes flicked to the emblem on Ruwen\u2019s breast. Barbas\u2019 eyes seemed too small for his large frame and head, but his gaze held intelligence and what Ruwen decided was craftiness. \u201cWhat\u2019s this then?\u201d Barbas asked. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize your emblem. Who are you? What chapter do you represent?\u201d Ruwen inclined his head a fraction. \u201cWell met. You may call me Nightshade, and the Black Pyramid is my chapter.\u201d Barbas snorted. \u201cNonsense, that chapter doesn\u2019t exist. No one has ever seen a practitioner from such a place. You\u2019re obviously some type of imposter. Show me your face.\u201d Ruwen made no move to remove his mask. Over the last half hour, he\u2019d learned all he needed to know about the type of person Barbas was. Ruwen spoke in an even tone. \u201cThe empty-headed believe what they see, and fools deny what they can\u2019t. I wager you are both.\u201d \u201cWhy you crusty little novice,\u201d Barbas hissed, pointing a finger at Ruwen. He took a step forward, and Sift mirrored him, causing the Grandmaster Alchemist to stop. \u201cDo you know who I am? Do you know the type of power one must wield to march unaccompanied to the Muses\u2019 Castle?\u201d Ruwen responded, echoing the alchemist\u2019s language. \u201cDo you know the type of power one must wield to arrive here with only a dozen others? That you require three thousand is a sign of weakness, as is your trivial complaint to the Muses.\u201d Barbas hissed. \u201cHow dare you?\u201d \u201cI would ask the same,\u201d Ruwen replied. \u201cWhy do you not dare? The solution to your bloated camp is simple: expand toward the forest. Or does the forest not know who you are either? Perhaps it needs a demonstration of your power.\u201d Barbas relaxed, and a predatory smile appeared. \u201cYou allege I\u2019m empty-headed and a fool, yet your words demonstrate how pathetic your knowledge and how woefully unprepared you are for this place. It explains why you arrived six months late and with a motley crew of mercenaries. If you are more than just talk, then we can have a real wager. I\u2019ll wait for you in my camp because I can promise that none of you will ever step inside that forest until your insolence, Nightshade, has been punished and your misplaced pride has been shattered and ground into powder.\u201d \u201cBy tomorrow you will realize that the six-month head start you enjoyed was not enough to win against myself and my team.\u201d Barbas sneered. \u201cThat kind of talk may have worked in your fake pyramid, but here you are just an empty crucible.\u201d \u201cAn empty vessel has the most to gain,\u201d Ruwen responded. \u201cI accept your invitation for a wager tonight at your camp. I\u2019ll arrive after we\u2019ve set up camp and darkness has arrived.\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t survive long enough to make it to this evening. In fact, if your ignorance lasts much longer, the Muses will have you thrown out. Either way, this is the last time I\u2019ll see that hideous gold mask.\u201d Ruwen felt the force of the Muses\u2019 probing magic as they scanned the group. It was a rude gesture and soured him on the seated deities. \u201cSpeaking of the Muses,\u201d Diantheon said, \u201cwrap up your conversation so we can perform the formalities.\u201d Barbas turned to the Muses and bowed, then without looking at Ruwen, strode away. \u201cAlchemist, approach us alone,\u201d Diantheon said. Ruwen immediately started for the Muses but didn\u2019t rush, taking measured steps. When he stood in the location Barbas had vacated, he stopped but didn\u2019t bow. \u201cI have only seen that chapter symbol once,\u201d Diantheon said. \u201cAnd it adorned a person who appeared far more powerful and impressive than you. I find it difficult to imagine such a person allowing a legitimate Grandmaster from their chapter to arrive in such a humble fashion.\u201d Ruwen remained silent. Diantheon obviously wanted to bait him into revealing information, and honestly, Miranda did look far more powerful than he did. The silence stretched awkwardly until Diantheon frowned. \u201cIs such disrespect tolerated in your chapter?\u201d \u201cApologies if my silence appears disrespectful, but the honored Muse did not ask a question.\u201d Ruwen sensed again the intense focus of the six deities as they used their Divine powers to flush out his secrets, but the Scarecrow Aspect assimilated into his body during the Metal-to-Gem transformation, and upgraded during his Gem to Divine Fortification, hid his internal spiritual network. Now all the Muses wore frowns as their best attempts to spiritually dissect him failed. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Diantheon asked. \u201cNightshade.\u201d \u201cIs that your real name?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWhy won\u2019t you give us your real name?\u201d \u201cBecause here I\u2019m a Grandmaster Alchemist called Nightshade, and my other names are irrelevant for this endeavor.\u201d \u201cWhy are you hiding your face?\u201d \u201cI was burned by acid.\u201d Diantheon narrowed his eyes. \u201cNone of your companions are what they seem, and somehow you are evading our detection. Can you explain these oddities?\u201d \u201cI can.\u201d After ten seconds, Diantheon understood. \u201cBut you won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI will not.\u201d Normally, Ruwen wouldn\u2019t act so arrogantly, but he\u2019d learned a lot about people and organizations as he worked to fix his own nation, and one thing never changed: Just like in alchemy, everything above matched below, and the blatant misuse of power by the captain and his team upon Ruwen\u2019s arrival could only mirror the type of people the captain answered to. Not wanting to jump to any conclusions, Ruwen withheld judgment, but thirty minutes watching the Muses while they spoke with Barbas provided enough study for his intuition to scream something was off. The deep scans, while not the biggest abuse, still pointed at a casual misuse of power that didn\u2019t bode well for the Muses\u2019 characters. Ruwen knew that shouldn\u2019t surprise him\u2014they were deities after all, and he had only met a couple who still retained their decency. They all, at some point, shifted their probes to try and see what Ruwen looked like under his mask, but he used Harmony to scramble the energy that touched him. \u201cFine,\u201d Diantheon said. \u201cDisplay your mark.\u201d Ruwen raised his right arm and pulled his sleeve down enough to reveal his wrist. With a thought, he displayed the first of the alchemical marks that contained the most basic information. \u201cAnd proof of the quest?\u201d Diantheon asked. Instead of pushing the quest to Diantheon, Ruwen did something Hamma had taught him. Evidently, the interface could be customized far more than he realized, and his high Intelligence and Energy pool made displaying information trivial. Ruwen used one hundred energy per second and reproduced the quest as flowing yellow text in a thirty-by-thirty square between himself and the Muses. Diantheon gave a small nod, and Ruwen dismissed the projection. \u201cNormally, we would spend some time familiarizing ourselves with you and your education, but considering your aptitude for making enemies, I doubt you will survive the night. My advice to you is to turn around and return home.\u201d \u201cThank you for the advice. Are we free to leave then?\u201d Diantheon nodded. Ruwen gave a slight bow. He turned to leave but paused. \u201cWhat are the restrictions around camp locations?\u201d \u201cWe have none, but the alchemists have made an arrangement amongst themselves.\u201d \u201cPerfect. And the details for the quest?\u201d \u201cWe have expanded on the original, and the details can be found on the stone block halfway between here and the camps.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d Ruwen turned and strode to the exit. His team joined him. He already knew the perfect camping spot. \n CHAPTER 25 As Ruwen left the fortress, he formed a Chat group with his party so they could communicate privately if needed. He scanned the area below and quickly found what he wanted. That stone block surrounded by projection gems is our first destination, Ruwen informed everyone in Chat. Sift responded. Between threatening to rip the guards\u2019 heads off, poking a likely important guy here, and if all the frowns are an indication, irritating the Muses, you\u2019re really going out of your way to make yourself popular here. I know, Ruwen replied. I might have overdone it. When I spoke with Sivart, he said I needed to find a balance between not appearing weak while demonstrating just enough strength to avoid fighting every single alchemist who wants to climb upward using our dead bodies. The right side of Ruwen\u2019s vision held everyone\u2019s portraits, although they were tiny because of the number, and he realized many of these people would like smaller Chat groups so they could discuss things without the entire party following their conversation. Ruwen cast the Spirit version of the Commander ability, Battlefield Promotion, giving everyone the ability to form their own groups from within this primary group. It only took seconds for Ruwen to regret his decision as a new icon appeared over the main party list. It started as a triangle but in seconds had morphed into a fifteen-point starburst. Each star tip opened a subset of tiny portraits of those in the Chat and it contained a label. Ruwen managed to keep his groan to himself as a familiar name appeared on one label. With a thought, he entered the sub-Chat that contained his closest friends. Either change the name or remove me. I\u2019m not taking part in a sub-Chat called Turtle Vision. And how did you get a picture of a turtle? Hamma replied, You can put pictures on whatever you want. It just takes a thought. Ruwen didn\u2019t know something like that was possible. Mages didn\u2019t get a Chat ability, so he\u2019d never spent any time learning about the spell before Ascendancy. You knew that, right? Lylan asked. Everything is customizable. Ruwen knew his displays could be customized, but he\u2019d never considered adding unnecessary pictures. The upgraded display provided by the temple after Ascendancy was organized logically and provided the necessary information in an efficient if unexciting way. For the most part, Ruwen just uses the standard interface, Rami said. Hamma and Lylan both stopped suddenly, forcing Ruwen to do the same. Both turned and stared at him. Rami\u2019s joking, right? Hamma asked. Seriously, the standard displays are garbage, Lylan added. I love what the two of you have done, Rami said to Hamma and Lylan. Once we get camp set up, I\u2019ll see if I can facilitate sharing template designs amongst us. Now I regret making this group, Sift said. Good, Ruwen replied, think twice before putting us all together in a Chat called Turtle Vision. Everyone else had stopped as well, so Ruwen used the opportunity to organize their new Chat groups. Almost all the starburst\u2019s tips glowed yellow, meaning new conversations were occurring in those Chats. Here, Rami said. Ruwen\u2019s vision blurred as the group icons on the right side of his vision shifted rapidly, and the starburst remodeled into a five-pointed star. A rectangle with multiple tabs appeared in the lower left portion of his vision where his log would appear when summoned. I\u2019ve removed Hamma\u2019s color scheme and Lylan\u2019s unique labeling system as I didn\u2019t want to overwhelm you. I\u2019ve pinned the main group Chat along with Turtle Vision to the five-pointed star. The remaining three points will contain your most recent Chat along with the two most used. By focusing on a name or label, you can bring those chats to the forefront of the Chat box on your lower left. Hamma has added an additional customization to her Chat box that I\u2019ll add to yours. Similar to pulling up a name or a label, you can feed it words or parts of sentences and it will search your log for those entries and present them to you. It works kind of like my indexing. Ruwen knew the screens and displays were customizable, but he\u2019d never imagined taking it so far. Rami continued. Entering a Chat will let you hear the current conversations, and you can set aside some Energy if you want the ability to hear the past conversations, otherwise you\u2019ll just need to read the text version. Out of curiosity, can you please show me the template that Hamma uses? A second later, Ruwen\u2019s vision exploded into hundreds of colors. It looked like a rainbow had crashed into his eyes and shattered. Instead of the well-organized boxes, tabs, and lists that he kept mostly hidden until needed, Hamma\u2019s entire border glowed, strobed, and shook for attention. Hundreds of icons, some clumping together and rotating like small solar systems, others racing around in incomprehensible patterns, leaving wakes of even more colors. Faint lines appeared, and Ruwen realized Hamma was touching multiple icons to produce even more complex responses. The colors suddenly vanished, and Ruwen\u2019s calming, logical, and geometric interface returned. His heart rate slowed, and he sighed. I\u2019m not ready for that, Ruwen told Rami. Rami laughed. Don\u2019t feel bad. It\u2019s overwhelming for me as well. But once you understand it, it\u2019s like playing a piano. Instead of making a series of choices, Hamma can push four icons at the same time and immediately retrieve the information she needs. It\u2019s one of the reasons why she\u2019s such a superb healer. She has turned everything into objects and then created relationships between them that perform complex operations. Having remained stationary too long, Ruwen strode past Hamma and Lylan. They quickly fell into step behind him to either side, and the rest of the team followed. Ruwen hadn\u2019t taken ten steps when his enhanced eyesight detected a cloud of extremely fine particles hanging in the air fifty feet away and directly in their path. Obviously, Barbas had poisoned the area of their most likely route as it made sense they would want to get the details of the quest. It reminded Ruwen of how Ky had manipulated his actions which had placed him on a predictable path. Ruwen used Identify to get the poison\u2019s details, and he considered how to handle this obstacle. The poison, while lethal, was slow-acting, and if he had Silverleaf, creating an antidote would be well within his abilities. He could also use his Void Band to suck up the lethal motes, allowing him to use the poison himself later. Or he could always just walk around it. The alchemist profession was unfamiliar to Ruwen, making reactions to situations here difficult to gauge. Thankfully, Blapy had given him two experts. Using the new interface capabilities, Ruwen focused on Madda and Padda. To his surprise, a group had already been created that contained just the alchemists. When he wondered who created the sub-Chat, a small portrait of Big D appeared. Focusing on Big D\u2019s portrait, Ruwen concentrated on what other sub-Chats she\u2019d created and over a dozen appeared. Sub-Chats for cooking, security, setting up camp, alchemy, standing watch, requests, and resource gathering. Once again, Big D\u2019s expertise in organization had already solved problems Ruwen hadn\u2019t anticipated. Ruwen sent Big D a quick, personal thank you and then focused on the alchemy Chat that contained himself, Madda, and Padda. I\u2019m not sure how to address either of you, Ruwen said. However you wish, Padda responded. Madda added, Grandmaster alchemists tend to be cruel to their Master alchemists. It\u2019s like a prolonged hazing. Luckily for us, Grandmaster Miranda is above that. Well, I\u2019m not going to haze anyone, Ruwen said. Of course you wouldn\u2019t, Madda said. But in front of other Grandmasters, it may behoove you to act in such a manner, as treating Master alchemists as equals would horrify the Grandmasters and isolate you further. We can talk about that later, Ruwen said. Twenty feet in front of us is a variant of the Bloody Ear. It\u2019s been converted into an aerosol and mixed with Leech Root to delay the poison. Interesting, Madda said. The Leech Root is a clever addition as it gives the poisoner time to retreat. I wonder how they masked the bitterness, Padda added. I agree with all that, Ruwen said. I\u2019m new to this alchemist stuff and I\u2019m unsure if I should march through it and create an antidote at camp, remove it, or go around it. We have Silverleaf with us, Padda said. Grandmaster Miranda gifted us with a significant amount of the chapter\u2019s resources to aid our endeavors here. That shocked Ruwen, he hadn\u2019t expected such a kind gesture. That was nice. Yes, Madda responded. She spoils us. I recommend we march through it. Assuming your analysis is correct, which I have no doubt it is, the antidote is easy to create, and we have all the ingredients. Our enemies will certainly be watching, and it will give us a small advantage while they believe us to be dying. Unfortunately, \u2018enemies\u2019 is an accurate description of our situation here, and I agree with Master Alchemist Madda, Padda said. The poison hung like an invisible mist, ten feet in front of Ruwen, and with all the alchemists in agreement, he didn\u2019t slow his stride. Just inside the first camps, Ruwen noticed Barbas, poorly hidden behind a tent, watching them intently. Ruwen pulled some of the poison into his Void Band for later study. Barbas shook his head in disgust and smiled cruelly. He disappeared further into the camp as the last of Ruwen\u2019s team entered the poison cloud. The Grandmaster alchemist had struck the first blow and believed the fight over. Ruwen couldn\u2019t wait to demonstrate the fight hadn\u2019t even started. \n CHAPTER 26 Ruwen studied the main quest and five sub quests. He\u2019d expected just one, and the additional five followed a theme that made him suspicious. The original quest didn\u2019t provide many details, and Ruwen glanced at it again, hoping it might make more sense now that he\u2019d seen the sub quests. Alchemical Curator of the Muses The Nine Muses require a Curator to protect, restock, and organize their Alchemical Archives. The winner of the Tournament of Perfection will receive this honor. Second place is the first failure. Reward: Title of Alchemical Curator of the Muses Reward: Entry into the Mechanism to claim a single item. Reward: Access to the Alchemical Archives. Restriction: Team size limited to 50. Restriction: Only team leader eligible for quest rewards. Ruwen hadn\u2019t known what to expect, but it certainly didn\u2019t include what had just occurred. His quest had updated when he\u2019d reached the quest stone, and he studied the new entries. Tournament of Perfection - Prime Quest Create a substance that provides immunity to soul magic. Entries will be judged on ease of use, abundance of ingredients, difficulty of creation, and effectiveness of immunity. Tournament of Perfection - Secondary Quests - Remove shadow contamination - Provide shadow protection - Damage shadow entities - Cloak or camouflage from shadow entities - Control shadow entities Appropriate awards available for secondary quests. Why did the Muses require so much Shadow-Realm-focused alchemy? The prime quest concerned Ruwen the most. The Darkness that would\u2019ve destroyed the Universe had Pen not stopped it by starving it of Spirit, had been controlled by Priests that were only weak to Soul Energy. Pen\u2019s journals revealed his belief that the Darkness had come from the Shadow Realm. If Soul Energy was the most effective magic against Shadow Realm creatures, any alchemy granting immunity to such power would prove catastrophic if the Shadow Realm discovered and duplicated it. Their best weapon to fight the Darkness and keep the Shadow Realm at bay would be lost. For the first time, Ruwen considered the possible need to destroy anything developed here, instead of competing in the quest. Large flat translucent gems contained the current leaderboard for each quest based on the results of their alchemical attempts. Barbas had the number one spot in two of the six quests, including the prime quest, and was in the top ten of the other four. In addition to the names, the types of concoction were listed. It appeared many avenues were being explored, from pills to elixirs to creams to powder. The criteria the Muses used for rating were also listed. Shockingly, none of the leaders had managed an effectiveness of over ten percent. The last thing listed was the alchemist\u2019s chapter along with any top academies attended and their Grandmaster rankings. Just like Bliz had predicted, nobody had more than a handful of stars. Ky stepped closer and spoke to the three alchemists. \u201cI assume you knew we walked right through a cloud of poison.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Madda said. \u201cWe have another few hours before any symptoms occur, and the antidote to this poison is straightforward once you know what it is.\u201d \u201cIt felt like bloodthorn to me,\u201d Ky responded. \u201cVery good,\u201d Padda told her. \u201cThe poison is a derivative and has been modified, but the foundation is quite similar. I wish you would reconsider spending time in the laboratory.\u201d \u201cI already have too much to do,\u201d Ky replied. \u201cCan I watch the antidote creation, though?\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d Madda said. \u201cIt\u2019s been six months,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cIs it wrong for me to think they should have discovered solutions that perform better than ten percent?\u201d \u201cIt is slightly concerning,\u201d Padda said. \u201cDespite their natures, the alchemists here are the best.\u201d \u201cIt certainly means this task will prove a fun challenge,\u201d Madda added. \u201cLet\u2019s set up camp and create that antidote,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cThen we can discuss our plan for these multiple quests.\u201d Ruwen beckoned for Bliz. He\u2019d seen the bartender use resources from his Void Band to rapidly create defensive structures when they fought outside of New Eiru. \u201cWhat kind of structures can you build quickly?\u201d Ruwen asked Bliz as he approached. Bliz glanced at the distant tents before turning back to Ruwen. \u201cTents are popular here, and they\u2019re fine for short durations or if you need to move often. I can do better than you see here in less than an hour, easy.\u201d \u201cWhat do you recommend?\u201d Bliz rubbed his hands together. \u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d He grinned. \u201cThe answer, though, depends on where you plan on settling down.\u201d Ruwen studied the distant encampments for five seconds before returning his attention to Bliz. Instead of speaking directly, he spoke in the general Chat so that everyone could respond. This would keep their conversations private in case the alchemists were spying. They expect us to set up here at the rear, and that is certainly the safest place. I\u2019m not underestimating the quality of these alchemists or their experience, and there are likely excellent reasons to avoid camping in that buffer area. And maybe, if we were here just for alchemy, I\u2019d consider staying back here, but I have critical tasks that require easy access to the Shadow Realm. So, I guess my first question is for Bliz. Do you have anything safer than tents if we venture into that buffer zone between the current camp and the forest? I do. Thanks to Big D\u2019s foresight, I packed enough to do better than safe. In a few hours, I can create a secure and private area. Assuming there\u2019s nothing stopping us from harvesting a few of the trees in this forest, we\u2019ll have a small fortress by the time night falls. Anyone disagree with setting up a small fortress in the buffer area? Ruwen asked. To Ruwen\u2019s satisfaction, the Chat remained clear. Now, no one freak out, Ruwen looked directly at Sift. But I allowed us all to be poisoned a few minutes ago. Instead of using the Dune Wraith mask that completely covered his face, Sift used the wraps that left his eyes exposed, and they widened in surprise. Ruwen held up a hand before Sift could panic. First, it has an easy antidote, and we have the ingredients. Second, I\u2019m betting that Barbas bragged about poisoning us to every alchemist that he passed on the way back to his camp. They believe we\u2019re stupid and will die soon, and that means for the next few hours, no one will bother us. So, my plan is to take the shortest route to the buffer zone, which is right through the middle of their camps. Sift shifted nervously from foot to foot. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a waste of time? It seems like we have a lot to do: creating a fortress, walking around, and creating an antidote so we don\u2019t all die. Why not just use your gravity shell thing and scoot us all over? That would save at least an hour. That\u2019s a good idea, Ruwen responded, but I\u2019m trying to hide as much of my power as possible. When we don\u2019t die, our camp will serve as a massive reminder of their cowardice, and our popularity will plummet. I\u2019m saving my tricks for when they attack us. You\u2019re really selling this, Lylan replied. By attack, you mean try and kill us, Hamma offered. Exactly, thank you for summarizing, Priestess. Sift shook his hands. Can we get moving, please? My fingers are tingling and I\u2019m feeling dizzy. Have the cramps started? Ky asked. Sift placed a hand over his stomach. Maybe. I think so. Madda sighed loudly but responded in Chat. It appears we misjudged. I didn\u2019t think any of us, you especially, Sift, would have a weakness to that poison. I\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t have as much time as I thought. Sift gasped out loud and his response arrived in all caps. WHAT! Padda placed a hand on Madda\u2019s shoulder. Perhaps his odds would be better with exposure to Spined Death Ivy. Are you tricking me into helping again? Sift asked with narrowed eyes. You two always get so mean when you\u2019re doing alchemy. Madda waved her hand. Never mind. Ky has offered to observe and help. You can just curl up somewhere and wait. But stay close. Once the seizures start, you won\u2019t be able to walk far. No, I\u2019ll help. For as much as the two of you fuss about me not being around, you sure are anxious to let me die from a poison my best friend basically fed me. Can we get going, please? Padda kept the satisfaction from his face as he responded in Chat. Perhaps we can finally get you out of the third alchemy manual. You\u2019ve been stuck at ninety-nine skill level for years. Madda piled on. Grandmaster Starfield didn\u2019t encounter any issues reaching one hundred on his way to a thousand. In a single day. Perhaps you can ask him for advice. Oh no you don\u2019t, Sift said. No comparing me to that, he finished, pointing at Ruwen. Ruwen watched as the Addas expertly manipulated Sift into not only helping, but also advancing. Seeing the manipulation of others seemed easy, while detecting one\u2019s own manipulation often came far too late. Sift\u2019s alchemy level brought back memories of the first time Ruwen had entered the Black Pyramid\u2019s lab. Sift had brought Ruwen there, and he remembered being awed by Sift\u2019s level three alchemy journal. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Ruwen said out loud and headed toward the tent camps. \n CHAPTER 27 Barbas had decidedly spread the word of their poisoning because Ruwen\u2019s group strode unhindered through the central pathway between the camps. When they reached Barbas\u2019 camp, the Grandmaster alchemist, along with at least forty Master alchemists, sneered at Ruwen\u2019s group. The irony of Barbas\u2019 attempt to kill them with his clever poison lay in the fact it saved Ruwen time without costing him anything. Ky messaged Ruwen privately. You have taught these alchemists a valuable lesson in manipulating expectations, and I applaud your success. This is also a valuable lesson for you because the world, and any Shade, will twist your expectations to their own ends. Is that a warning to hide them? Partly, but that\u2019s not always possible. Sometimes your goals will be obvious, so you must gauge how they make you vulnerable, and take steps to mitigate that weakness. Instead of responding in Chat, Ruwen turned toward Ky and nodded his appreciation. His experience near the harbor, and ease with which Lylan had manipulated him into meeting Ky remained fresh in his mind. Their path into the buffer zone would\u2019ve normally caused a flurry of questions, delays, and multiple attempts to stop them. Pride and ignorance had convinced Barbas that Ruwen and his group would die within hours, which is the only reason Barbas and the others had allowed them through their camps. The area between the camp and the tree line hadn\u2019t existed six months ago. Fresh stumps littered the area and a few pathways had been worn into the short grass. Based on the number of paths, it didn\u2019t appear that the alchemists ventured far from the same areas. Ruwen quickly queried Sivart to discuss the best strategies for placing his camp. After studying the situation for ten seconds, Sivart gave his input. \u201cThe trees act as a natural barrier and we can use them to form outer protections and hurdles, making routes of approach treacherous and difficult for attackers. However, with potential enemies within the trees, the closer we are to the forest the riskier our position. The center of the buffer area provides the most visibility and maximizes our ability to observe enemy movements both emerging from the forest and from the camps, which reduces the chances of a surprise attack. We don\u2019t need to consider supply routes as we\u2019re self-sufficient. Elevation is a defensive advantage so consider raising the height of the fortress.\u201d As usual, Sivart\u2019s advice resonated with Ruwen, and he thanked the man. He considered how high he could make a mound without inviting suspicion, and it occurred to him he had no idea how big their camp would be. Eventually he decided to worry about the height after the fortress was built. They followed the widest path leading out from Barbas\u2019 camp. The Grandmaster had assembled a very large camp and Ruwen\u2019s plan would certainly upset him. In general Chat, Ruwen asked Ky if she knew what kind of dangers might emerge from the Shadow Realm. Once we\u2019re out of sight, I\u2019ll take a quick peek as it varies from place to place. I\u2019m guessing this area lacks a Warden, as the captain mentioned multiple shadow creatures emerging. They\u2019re likely weak because they wait until night. The strong ones don\u2019t fear the light. Dusk, one of the three Founders of the Bamboo Viper Clan, had gifted Ruwen two shadow-related items during his Master\u2019s trial, and he reviewed their details. Name: Symbol of Lesser Command Shadow Restriction: Bamboo Viper Clan Adept Restriction: Rank Orange Description: Dismiss your shadow at will, storing it in your mark. Not all shadows fear the light. Name: Symbol of Lesser Shadow Funnel Restriction: Bamboo Viper Clan Adept Restriction: Rank Yellow Restriction: Shadow required. Description: Once per day for seven seconds, reduce all damage taken by 10% and reduce damage done by 10%. Not all shadows fear the light. Ruwen created a private Chat with Ky. Do you think the Founders would loan us some shadow protection gear for our team? It might make things safer if everyone could hide their shadows. After we take care of the poison, if you make a gate rune door to the Master\u2019s sanctuary, I\u2019ll ask. Ruwen had reached the middle of the buffer area and stopped. Turning to Ky, he bowed in thanks. \u201cWe can all talk out loud now,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cBliz, let\u2019s set up camp here and go with the fortress. I can provide some Minions to harvest trees for the outer wall.\u201d Big D studied the area before speaking. \u201cDo you want barracks or more private accommodations? How many laboratories will you need and what are their dimensions? My brief exposure to alchemists in the past cautions me to place a large buffer between the laboratories and anything of value.\u201d Memories of all the explosions Ruwen and the Minions had caused while leveling to Grandmaster flashed through his mind. Big D continued. \u201cI assume we\u2019ll have a common structure for eating and meetings. I\u2019ve loaded myself and the brothers with enough supplies to support an army, and since we don\u2019t have those fancy hundred percent reduction bands, the three of us can barely move. We\u2019ll need a structure for our supplies and likely another for alchemy resources.\u201d Once again, Ruwen marveled that he hadn\u2019t considered any of that. It was like he had a blind spot for planning. Now that he\u2019d become aware of this behavior, he noticed it more and more. It stemmed from the same thought process that made Hamma\u2019s dense connection-based view of the world so hard to replicate. \u201cThank you, Big D, for once again remembering all the things I never considered. Madda and Padda can provide much better direction regarding the needs we\u2019ll have for our alchemy work, and everything else I leave to your impeccable management skills.\u201d \u201cVery wise,\u201d Big D replied. \u201cTry and stay out of our way.\u201d Ruwen couldn\u2019t tell if the last was spoken in jest or not but decided to play it safe and give the Workers room. Most everyone mirrored Ruwen\u2019s movement, and the plate-armored Rami stepped up beside him. \u201cBig D added me to your alchemy chat,\u201d Rami said. \u201cI used Superior Telescopic Touch and absorbed over five thousand alchemy recipes along with hundreds of guarded research compilations on theory and rare resources. Xavier will help me summarize it and I\u2019ll update the alchemy Chat.\u201d Hamma grasped her necklace as she spoke. \u201cArchie has, umm, stumbled into a few of the laboratories, including the ones Rami couldn\u2019t reach. He has some interesting recipes to contribute.\u201d Not for the first time, Ruwen wondered about Archie. The creature could replicate himself seemingly without limit, although Ruwen guessed a cost existed somewhere. A loud clang sounded as Rami rubbed her gauntleted hands together in anticipation of Archie\u2019s information. \u201cThank you, Rami and Archie. The two of you saved us a lot of time.\u201d Focusing on Rami, Ruwen asked about including the other Grandmaster alchemist, the Narrator Arcanum, who\u2019d come to life from his level one Black Pyramid alchemy journal. She\u2019d been critical in his path to reaching Grandmaster. Can you send Arcanum all that research, too. I bet she\u2019d appreciate the knowledge. Of course, great idea. Ruwen created a Shed large enough to hide all of them and let Overlord, Uruziel, and Sivart know they could emerge. The trio immediately appeared. Ruwen turned to Overlord. \u201cBliz has golems that he uses for rapid construction, but I know we\u2019d go faster with your improved Minions.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll send him some,\u201d Overlord responded. \u201cKeep our strength hidden, so don\u2019t do anything flashy. Keep the number around a dozen for now, that shouldn\u2019t draw any attention. Uruziel, if you could keep an eye on everything and please offer your expertise. We\u2019re dealing with the merging of two realms, and I\u2019m not sure what weirdness that will cause. Overlord and Sivart, please explore the trees and get a better understanding of what surrounds us. Use as many of the Scarecrow Aspect Clones as you wish but keep them in the trees and out of sight.\u201d The three nodded and exited the Shed, and Ruwen felt the pull on his Core as Overlord pulled Spirit away to create the Minions and Clones. Bliz sent Ruwen a message that the main alchemy structure had been erected and the alchemists could start using it. Ruwen dismissed the Shed and admired Bliz\u2019s work. The speed of the construction stunned him. Madda and Padda, Ky and Sift in tow, had almost reached the structure. Instead of immediately heading for the laboratory, Ruwen stood in awe as a Void Band master and an organizational genius created a small city together. \n CHAPTER 28 Ruwen studied Bliz\u2019s technique as the Crew Chief sprinted across the area, building resources dropping out of his Void Band like a chipmunk with an upset stomach. It brought back memories of the advice Bliz had given Ruwen as they traveled out of Deepwell to set up Big D\u2019s camp the day after Ruwen\u2019s Ascendancy. Although, in truth, Ruwen didn\u2019t compare to Bliz. Not only did items like lumber, fasteners, glass, and stone emerge from Bliz\u2019s Inventory in neat piles, but tools and ladders flew out of the Void Band and landed exactly where needed. Ruwen recalled the Workers he\u2019d met who\u2019d mastered their trades, like Ahvey and her Shooters. The Shooters had loaded Ruwen\u2019s Void Band for Big D\u2019s camping trip, and their excellence rivaled any of the other Classes. Watching the perfect orchestration filled him with joy. A synchronized production no different than any theater or musical performance. Witnessing the Workers efficiency created immense satisfaction in Ruwen. After enjoying it for a minute he used the opportunity to work on his Harmonic Sight. He wanted to try and glimpse the emotions he felt to help break his mind free from the linear and logical view he experienced now. Activating Harmonic Sight and Knowledge, Ruwen initially felt immense disappointment, seeing his world of straight lines and organized patterns no longer seemed as great now that he\u2019d experienced the world as Gunder did. As if summoned, the Bard appeared beside Ruwen and placed a hand on his shoulder. Ruwen understood and, with no effort, synchronized his mind with Gunder\u2019s and studied the sudden shift in vision. Gunder\u2019s more advanced Harmonic Sight displayed the waves of joy and satisfaction that Bliz\u2019s demonstration had evoked from Ruwen. Surrounding Ruwen\u2019s head swirled light blue flecks that reminded him of snowflakes, and strings of yellow sunlight darted between them. Gunder shifted his attention to Bliz, where golden bursts that Ruwen recognized as happiness trailed in the wake of the Crew Chief. The Minions and golems contained straight lines of brown and white that looked far more familiar to Ruwen\u2019s normal view. A green aura oscillated around Bliz, and blobs of it stuck to anything he touched or launched from his Void Band. Ruwen asked Gunder about the color. \u201cWitnessing this is a rare experience. I associate that green with extreme competence, something masters and experts emit when they\u2019re doing what they love.\u201d Ruwen returned to his own Harmonic Sight. Once again, he viewed the organized lines and patterns. He focused on Bliz and concentrated on seeing the joy, competence, and mastery that Bliz displayed in Gunder\u2019s view. Ruwen had still not detected a speck of green when Big D tapped him on the shoulder. \u201cThe two Masters have almost finished setting up the laboratory.\u201d Ruwen dismissed Harmonic Sight and Knowledge and glanced around at his camp, now more than just the laboratory existed. \u201cThanks, Big D. I\u2019ll head over there now. In the unlikely event I\u2019m needed out here, just ping me in Chat.\u201d Big D nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve already assigned everyone a task except Lylan and the Bard, and the Bard will soon be singing a rousing song to Haste those golems and Minions.\u201d \u201cIs Lylan okay?\u201d Ruwen asked, concerned about the poison possibly acting faster than he expected. \u201cShe\u2019s fine and wants to talk to you first.\u201d \u201cAhh,\u201d Gunder said. \u201cSmart woman.\u201d Ruwen turned to the Bard. \u201cDo you know what\u2019s going on?\u201d \u201cI have a guess, but it would be better for you to hear it from Lylan.\u201d Ruwen thanked Big D and Gunder once again, and then strode toward the alchemy lab. Lylan stepped out of a building\u2019s shadow to intercept Ruwen. \u201cHey, Lylan, what\u2019s up?\u201d Lylan always did a superb job of hiding her emotions, but Ruwen sensed her nervousness. Not one to beat around the bush, Lylan launched her request like a crossbow bolt. \u201cDuring my trial, I discovered that the more I understand about the world, and especially my targets, the more powerful I can make my magic. It occurred to me that learning alchemy might supercharge my knowledge. I know I\u2019m new to this and will probably just\u2060\u2014\u201d Ruwen waved a hand to interrupt her. \u201cOf course you can come. And just because your alchemy knowledge is lacking doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t contribute. Plus, I know your work ethic, and you won\u2019t be a novice for long.\u201d Lylan visibly relaxed, before she stepped closer and hugged Ruwen. \u201cHamma said you\u2019d welcome me and that I worried for nothing.\u201d Ruwen patted Lylan on the back. \u201cWorried about what?\u201d Lylan stepped back. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just used to people using other people\u2019s needs as leverage. Old habits die hard, especially when it comes to asking others for help.\u201d Ruwen smiled, although Lylan couldn\u2019t see it behind his mask. \u201cI\u2019m actually upset that I didn\u2019t think of it first. Imagine how uncomfortable Sift will be, having his parents watch him while he\u2019s competing against his girlfriend. This is going to drive him crazy.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand you two.\u201d \u201cI know. But I promise, this will be fantastic. Come on.\u201d Ruwen and Lylan marched to the laboratory, and the closer they got, the more he realized he\u2019d underestimated the size. Each wall spanned a hundred feet and stood twenty feet high. Triangle wedges met at a point, creating the ceiling forty feet above, and Bliz had hardened the ground into level stone. The wall sections had a uniform size of twenty-by-twenty and interlocked with each other. Identify informed Ruwen the main component of the walls consisted of mulched bamboo and a waterproof binder. A six-armed Minion had almost completed attaching the lab\u2019s double doors, and it stepped aside for Ruwen and Lylan to pass. As shocked by the clever materials and rapid assembly as Ruwen was, he stopped short upon seeing the magical transformation that Madda and Padda had accomplished in less than five minutes. Long narrow tables set flush against every wall, and half had already been filled with vials, powders, and jars. Three of the large wagon-sized mobile alchemy labs had been deployed along with six medium labs. In the center of the room, a round table with eight chairs sat. As Ruwen watched, Madda pointed at three locations not far from the table, and Padda dropped large cubes out of what could only be an unbound Void Band. It reminded Ruwen of the dark portal he\u2019d recovered from the severed arm of Valora. To Ruwen\u2019s surprise, the cubes unfolded themselves repeatedly until each one stretched twenty-five feet, the three making a U-shape around the table. As the boxes began unfolding upward, Ruwen\u2019s Identify triggered. Name: Mobile Medium Library Subject: Alchemy By the time Ruwen had read the Notification, three bookcases had appeared, stuffed tight with books and scrolls. They stood like walls protecting the table. He had no idea such things existed. Ruwen removed his mask, dropped it in his Void Band, and threw his hood back. He pointed at the bookshelves. \u201cHow do I get those?\u201d Madda glanced at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know? Qwyn made a big deal about these.\u201d Qwyn was the spider that Ruwen had left in charge of the Black Pyramid libraries while he was away. Ruwen walked over to the closest bookshelf and ran his hand across the books. He turned to Madda and shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Madda said, \u201cbecause Qwyn made it sound like it was all your idea. Some collaboration between the library and the chapel.\u201d \u201cCollaboration?\u201d Surprisingly, Lylan spoke up. \u201cI know about this one because Hamma wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it. The libraries are in much better shape than the chapels. Hamma is working hard to improve the revival queue times but until the duration comes down, many creatures choose extended healing instead which crowds the hospitals. She came up with mobile libraries so that the hospitalized creatures who couldn\u2019t travel far to reach a library could still get books. It turned out even the schools with libraries enjoyed them because some of the topics the students wanted weren\u2019t on their shelves.\u201d \u201cThis is such an amazing idea,\u201d Ruwen whispered. \u201cWait until I tell Tremine.\u201d \u201cBlapy liked the idea as well, and she helped in their creation, obviously.\u201d Ruwen stepped back and studied the bookshelf appreciatively. He needed to thank Hamma, Blapy, and Qwyn. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have given me credit for it.\u201d \u201cAfter the disaster your predecessor created,\u201d Madda said, \u201cI\u2019d just take the win.\u201d Learning about this wonderful advancement made Ruwen happy, and knowing Qwyn had taken such good care of the libraries eased the guilt he felt over not visiting in so long. Sift finished organizing the items on a nearby table and walked over to give Lylan a hug. \u201cHave you come to watch your boyfriend work some alchemical magic?\u201d \u201cActually,\u201d Ruwen said, \u201cLylan is helping with our alchemy quests.\u201d Sift looked confused. \u201cYou never mentioned anything about alchemy.\u201d Ky appeared from behind one of the bookcases. \u201cI\u2019m interested in that answer as well.\u201d Lylan shrugged. \u201cAlchemy has a lot of uses, and poisons are a weak area of mine.\u201d Ruwen didn\u2019t react to Lylan\u2019s explanation. For all he knew, the statement was true. If she didn\u2019t want to reveal more about her magic, that was her business. Sift already wore a plain hooded black robe. Madda removed three folded black robes identical to Sift\u2019s and genuinely smiled at Lylan. Padda finished arranging the papers on the table and gave Lylan an approving smile. \u201cI hope your desire to learn rubs off on our other alchemists.\u201d Sift groaned softly as Lylan took the robes from Madda. \u201cThis is going to be so great,\u201d Ruwen said. \n CHAPTER 29 Ruwen, Madda, and Padda sat at the central table in the alchemical laboratory discussing the best antidote for the Bloody Ear poison variant that Barbas had placed in their path earlier. Sift, Lylan, and Ky all wore black alchemical robes while observing. Bloody Ear was usually a toxin known for its cruel swiftness and lethal potency, but the nature of the creation had delayed its response. With Bloody Ear, by the time you received the notification that you\u2019d been poisoned, your chance at survival had already passed. \u201cIt really says a lot about Barbas that he used such a poison,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cA very decisive act,\u201d Ky agreed. Padda, who tended toward a meticulous and methodical approach, began, \u201cWe know that silverleaf is a crucial component for the Blood Ear antidote, and its purifying properties are well-documented, but we need to decide how best to integrate it.\u201d From Ruwen\u2019s brief interaction with the pair of Master Alchemists, he guessed Madda\u2019s process included imagining the whole process at the same time. He could see how the pair would balance each other well. Madda\u2019s creativity and non-linear method would eventually become ordered by Padda. \u201cSilverleaf is notoriously difficult to stabilize when mixed with other components,\u201d Madda said, \u201cand silverleaf alone won\u2019t be enough. We need something to counteract the dizziness and should add nightshade berries to counteract the numbing effect, but we must be careful with the dosage.\u201d Ruwen listened attentively and only responded when Madda finished. \u201cNightshade is a good choice, Madda, but if we used powdered galt horn, we\u2019d benefit from the healing properties while amplifying the silverleaf solubility.\u201d Madda and Padda exchanged glances, impressed by Ruwen\u2019s suggestion. \u201cThat is better,\u201d Padda said slowly. He turned to Sift but before he could speak Sift waved a hand. \u201cI\u2019ll look,\u201d Sift said. He stood and pulled a large journal from across the table. Padda winced as Sift disturbed some of the neat stacks. Sift turned to Lylan and whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll explain how our ingredients are inventoried so you can find things on your own.\u201d Lylan beamed at Sift and the two opened the book. Padda had a thoughtful look on his face. \u201cEven finely ground galt horn is difficult to get into solution. I\u2019ve used medium heat and a pinch of elderflower to speed up the process.\u201d \u201cElderflower will also act as a neutralizer for the acidity,\u201d Madda added. Ruwen smiled, thrilled that Madda and Padda had such deep alchemical knowledge. Padda chimed in again, and Ruwen tried to recall if he\u2019d ever heard the man speak so much in one sitting. \u201cWe should consider another buffering agent like moonseed in case we misjudge the elderflower. It would be a shame to stop the whole body hemorrhaging only to melt a hole in everyone\u2019s stomachs.\u201d Sift looked up from the book, clearly trying to determine if his dad had spoken in jest. Lylan elbowed him to focus, and he placed a hand on his stomach, as if it already had an ulcer. \u201cThat\u2019s a good recipe,\u201d Madda said. She turned to Ruwen. \u201cGrandmaster?\u201d Ruwen tapped a finger against his chin. \u201cI agree the recipe is sound, but if we added ironwood tree sap, it would speed the clotting and, because we already have moonseed in our recipe, it would enhance the body\u2019s natural ability to stop bleeding.\u201d \u201cIronwood sap is a common resource,\u201d Padda said, \u201cso it doesn\u2019t harm anything to add but moonseed on its own should provide plenty of stability.\u201d Ruwen didn\u2019t respond and Padda frowned thoughtfully. Madda leaned onto the table. \u201cThe silverleaf and galt horn are more than enough to support clotting.\u201d Again, Ruwen didn\u2019t answer. The two Master Alchemists didn\u2019t get angry or frustrated, but excited. They\u2019d missed something important about Ruwen\u2019s suggestion and they faced each other and whispered rapidly back and forth. Ruwen felt Ky\u2019s gaze, and he turned to her. \u201cYou\u2019re the real deal, huh,\u201d Ky stated. Ruwen smiled wryly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. My exposure to Grandmaster Alchemists is limited. The one I know wants to kill me half the time and the other just proved himself a psychopath.\u201d Ky tilted her head. \u201cWell, they do cause a lot of trouble. I guess that certifies you.\u201d Padda slapped the table excitedly and Madda jumped to her feet. Ruwen, startled, turned to the pair. He saw a whole new side to the married couple. They were always so serious during the Bamboo Viper Step Clan meetings. Madda looked down at Padda who nodded for her to reveal their discovery. \u201cIt\u2019s so clever,\u201d Madda started. \u201cTurning an antidote into a dual-purpose elixir with such a common ingredient. The ironwood sap will provide a long-term buff to counter bleed effects.\u201d Ruwen grinned at the pair. \u201cExactly. And considering the rare ingredients required for the Bloody Ear antidote combined with how we stabilized the solution, I\u2019m guessing it will provide significant bleed protection.\u201d Seeing there was an opportunity for them to learn, he continued. \u201cHow much additional silverleaf would you add to provide a ninety percent probability of producing an immunity to bleed effects?\u201d Once again Madda and Padda held a whispered but excited conversation. After twenty seconds, they turned back to Ruwen. Padda gave their answer. \u201cBleed immunity with a ninety percent success rate would require an additional four percent, by weight, of silverleaf.\u201d Ruwen had opened his mouth to congratulate the pair on their quick understanding of the alchemy when two popups appeared in his vision. Grandmaster Alchemist Ruwen Starfield, the requirement for Master Alchemist Madda Adda, a junior alchemist under your mentorship, to advance a skill level in Alchemy has been fulfilled. Do you approve of this skill advancement from nine hundred ninety-four to nine hundred ninety-five? Yes or No The second popup had identical text except it detailed Padda\u2019s advancement from nine hundred ninety-five to nine hundred ninety-six. Ruwen immediately selected Yes to both popups. Madda gasped and Padda went stiff. Madda\u2019s mouth moved as if to speak, but no words came out. Both Addas looked at each other in shock. Finally, Padda spoke in a whisper. \u201cI leveled.\u201d Madda\u2019s eyes glistened and she nodded. \u201cMe, too.\u201d The pair hugged each other and then, remembering where they were, quickly stood. They stepped away from the table and bowed deeply to Ruwen, who stood and waved, dismissing their gesture. When they stood up, Padda\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cTen years.\u201d Madda dried her cheeks with the sleeve of her robe. \u201cEight years.\u201d Ruwen didn\u2019t understand and it must have shown. \u201cThat\u2019s how long it\u2019s been since we\u2019ve leveled our alchemy,\u201d Padda said. \u201cWe can\u2019t express our gratitude Grandmaster. This trip is now a resounding success for us. More than we\u2019d hoped for.\u201d Ruwen stared at them dumbfounded. Fluffy, then Miranda, and later Bliz had all made a big deal about how fast Ruwen had advanced. Only now, seeing the emotion from Madda and Padda did Ruwen really understand the commitment it took to become a Grandmaster. Ruwen finally spoke. \u201cAn entire decade?\u201d Madda responded. \u201cWe expected another decade to pass before we saw another level.\u201d That seemed like an insanely long time. The pair was willing to wait more time than Ruwen had been alive to get a single advancement to their alchemy level. \u201cWhy did it happen now?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cIs it something we can control?\u201d \u201cControl is like stopping the wind with your hands,\u201d Padda said. Madda reached over and clasped Padda\u2019s hand. \u201cAlmost everyone considers ways to speed up the process, but the variables are hidden, and it takes a combination of new insight and advancing your knowledge plus who knows what else along with a randomized chance depending on your level. At our level, that random chance is very small. This is a day to celebrate.\u201d Padda might consider Ruwen trying to stop the wind with his hands as fruitless, but Ruwen had a secret that would help. He knew how to circumvent the randomness of the world and tilt it in his favor: luck. Ruwen\u2019s current luck sat at seventy-two. Fifty came from the sword Threshold Compass of Fortune and twenty-five came from one of the abilities he\u2019d chosen on his path to Grandmaster. His bond with Tarot, the Misfortune Golem, decreased the total by three. He wondered if his luck had helped the Addas. Ruwen received a private Chat message from Sift. Ruwen half expected a sarcastic response or, considering how much attention Sift\u2019s parents were giving Ruwen, a bitter reaction. Instead, he got the opposite. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen my parents this happy. Thanks, buddy. Ruwen didn\u2019t look over at Sift, who still sat quietly teaching Lylan. They have this same expression every time they look at you. How can you not see that. Sift didn\u2019t respond. It occurred to Ruwen that he\u2019d detected absolutely no bitterness, jealousy, or resentment from Madda or Padda. Only an extremely well-balanced person would hold no fragment of those emotions when facing a teenager who\u2019d accomplished in a day what they\u2019d worked on for centuries. Hiding such emotions from his Divine perception would be almost impossible. Ruwen had managed to surround himself with amazing people. And, it so happened, luck was now something he could control. Once he created luck potions, everyone would benefit, even when he wasn\u2019t around. \u201cCongratulations, Masters,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled at your progress, and I have high hopes today is just the beginning. If two Grandmasters in our chapter is good, how great would four be?\u201d Ruwen held up his hands to stop any response. \u201cI know you think that\u2019s a foolish statement. With the variety of quests the Muses have provided, and the number of alchemical recipes Rami and Archie are stealing from our competitors, we\u2019ll have thousands of opportunities to advance our insight and knowledge while here. Let\u2019s create this antidote, and then I\u2019ll explain my plan to stop Padda\u2019s metaphorical wind\u2014and it won\u2019t even require hands.\u201d Only my blood, Ruwen added silently to himself. Ruwen received a private Chat from Ky. Well done, Grandmaster. Ruwen glanced over at Ky and thanked her in Shade Speak. As everyone moved toward one of the mobile labs to start on the antidote, Ruwen considered the pop-ups he\u2019d received for Madda and Padda. During his leveling in the Pyramid, Miranda would\u2019ve received the same for his advancement. She could\u2019ve stopped his progress at any time. Justifiably so since he\u2019d bent the norms by conjuring hundreds of alchemy-Minions. She hadn\u2019t stopped him though. Ruwen considered what he\u2019d have done in Miranda\u2019s position. A teenager making a mockery of her incredible advancement record while consuming vast amounts of precious resources all while being clueless at the unimaginable shortcut he\u2019d found. And while Miranda certainly possessed far more skills at hiding resentment, jealousy, or bitterness from Ruwen, he doubted she could keep all of it a secret. Despite Ruwen\u2019s many advancements, he didn\u2019t have the life experience or maturity necessary to honestly claim he would act like Madda, Padda, or Miranda if their places were reversed. Maybe recognizing this fact was the first step in the process of growing. Kind of like an alchemy recipe, the people around him were like rare ingredients that all offered something valuable as he created the elixir he called his life. \n CHAPTER 30 Bliz\u2019s cheeks turned a deeper shade of red than Ruwen had ever seen on the man. Everyone finished expressing their amazement at Bliz\u2019s ability to complete a walled fort with a useful variety of buildings in six hours. They sat in the dining hall, a room mirroring the size and shape of the alchemy lab. Ruwen guessed that Bliz had a limited set of buildings that he created from his cache of resources, but he created them insanely fast. The only building bigger than the dining hall and alchemy lab was the barracks, consisting of forty small rooms joined around a common area. The Minions were still finishing the interior, assembling cots and attaching doors while everyone else had gone to eat. Findley worked at the mobile chef kitchen, which looked like a massive multicolored tent. Ruwen\u2019s mouth watered for almost two hours due to smells emanating from inside the tent. Sift scowled in response to the scent of Findley\u2019s cooking. Everyone assembled in the dining hall at the four long tables assembled in a square, Ruwen sat next to Hamma on the wooden bench and enjoyed the performance that Findley made of cooking. The small gremlin carried Findley to the center of the hall and left the shiny lamp, allowing Findley to turn in a circle and describe the plates as the overworked gremlin retrieved them from the mobile oven. Ruwen felt a little bad for the gremlin. As if sensing Ruwen\u2019s thoughts, Findley assured everyone that the gremlin was living out his dream and assisting would only upset and confuse him. The food tasted better than it smelled, and Ruwen understood why Sift was so obsessed with the chef. \u201cPlease excuse me,\u201d Findley said. \u201cThere are a pyramid of pots and pans that need washing, and without supervision, the golems will destroy them. Leave your plates.\u201d He waved at the gremlin, who stood in a shadow against the wall. \u201cMy assistant will fetch them after you leave.\u201d As if summoned, the gremlin hurried over and picked up Findley\u2019s lamp. The gremlin looked as exhausted as Findley seemed happy. Sift sat on the other side of Hamma, and he stood, pushing his right arm into the air. The gremlin froze and Findley turned his gaze to Sift. Ruwen glanced at Sift and watched as his Black Pyramid mark appeared. The Black Pyramid marks changed over time as an adventurer traveled deeper into the dungeon or increased their level in pyramid-related activities, like the tenth cipher that Ruwen had learned during his alchemy progression. Despite the small differences, in general they all shared the same foundational structure and black color. Sift, however, had earned the title of Blapy\u2019s Favorite, and his mark had a blue hue. It also gave him some Black Pyramid privileges, but the only one he cared about related to Findley. \u201cI\u2019m a Favorite,\u201d Sift said simply. \u201cA long overdue recognition,\u201d Findley replied. The gremlin coughed and set the lamp down to recover. After five seconds, the gremlin steadied before loudly clearing its throat. Findley covered the gremlin\u2019s mouth with a handkerchief as it spit what sounded like a significant amount of phlegm. \u201cI apologize,\u201d Findley said as he checked the gremlin\u2019s forehead with the back of his hand\u2014as if determining if the gremlin had a fever. \u201cPerhaps I overworked the staff. Please excuse us while I take him to rest.\u201d \u201cNot so fast, Findley,\u201d Sift said. The gremlin moaned as if in pain and wavered on its feet. Findley looked distressed but Sift remained unaffected. With narrowed eyes, Sift continued. \u201cIn addition to what you\u2019ve already agreed to, I claim my right as Blapy\u2019s Favorite to a variety of baked sweets, donuts, and pastries\u2014daily!\u201d The gremlin fell over on its side as the mystical wind blowing around Findley increased dramatically, causing his colorful clothes to snap and flutter. Overlord, Uruziel, and Sivart sat to Ruwen\u2019s left. He\u2019d invited them to dinner figuring they\u2019d all enjoy the conversation. Overlord whispered to Ruwen. \u201cShould I summon a Minion to help get them back?\u201d \u201cMaybe, let\u2019s give this another few seconds to see what happens. Sift is acting stranger than normal.\u201d \u201cWe aren\u2019t in the Pyramid,\u201d Findley said as he hovered over the prone gremlin. \u201cYou know the rules,\u201d Sift said with a hard edge to his voice, one Ruwen rarely heard. Tears dripped down Findley\u2019s cheeks and the gremlin whimpered. The pair exchanged a pained glance but Sift didn\u2019t falter. The gremlin let out a resigned sigh and passed out. Findley sobbed and pushed at the gremlin, trying to wake him. \u201cOkay,\u201d Ruwen said to Overlord. \u201cSummon a Minion.\u201d \u201cAgree,\u201d Sift demanded of the genie. Findley wrung his hands and spoke between sobs. \u201cIf you insist.\u201d \u201cI do,\u201d Sift replied. The gremlin shuddered, and the genie turned its attention to his assistant. \u201cI won\u2019t get any sleep,\u201d Findley whispered. Sift sat before replying, \u201cYou never sleep.\u201d The Minion arrived and picked up the gremlin in one hand and the lamp with the other and followed Findley out of the building. \u201cThat was so mean,\u201d Hamma said to Sift. \u201cHe deserves it, believe me,\u201d Sift replied. \u201cHe seemed pretty nice,\u201d Ruwen said. Sift\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAre you serious? He\u2019s such an actor. I can\u2019t believe you fell for his show.\u201d Ruwen didn\u2019t press the point. Obviously, Sift carried baggage related to Findley. And it brought out the worst in him. They had other items to address, so Ruwen let the matter go. Ruwen stood and attracted everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Ruwen paused, he\u2019d almost said Archie, and looked at Hamma, \u201cwe have a good grasp of what\u2019s happened here over the last six months.\u201d Ruwen signaled to Ky, and she stood. \u201cThe other alchemists left this buffer area vacant because the Shadow Realm bleeds into it enough that creatures from that realm can utilize your shadow to enter the Material Realm and attack.\u201d Sift immediately turned and looked at his shadow. \u201cThat is so unnatural,\u201d he whispered. Ruwen continued, \u201cMistress Ky will request some special magic from our Step Clan. If available and they agree to let us borrow the items, it will allow each of you to store your shadow so it can\u2019t be used against you. In the meantime, we know that soul magic keeps the creatures away. We\u2019ve arranged the rooms so that those with soul magic will overlap, keeping us all safe while we sleep.\u201d Ruwen turned to Bliz as the next part affected him the most. \u201cMost call it the Shadow Realm, but the Destruction Realm is more accurate, and it doubles the durability damage in this area. That means we should start daily maintenance of all our buildings and fortifications.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll see to it,\u201d Bliz nodded. \u201cPoison is another common attack here, but that comes from the alchemists. Sift and Lylan should\u2019ve found each of you earlier and provided the antidote for the first attempt on our lives. The buff that antidote provided should last a week and keep you safe from all but the most terrible concoctions. If your buff drops or you get a notification of poisoning, find an alchemist immediately.\u201d \u201cPing me in Chat as well,\u201d Hamma said. \u201cIf it\u2019s life or death, I might be able to keep you alive long enough for the alchemist to cure you.\u201d Ruwen looked down at Hamma and smiled. \u201cThank you, that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d Ruwen sent a quick mental message to Overlord, Uruziel, and Sivart. I think going forward, any Minion you create for yourself needs tons of durability. Even then, please take extra care until we understand the level of destruction here. I\u2019m worried our mental connection might degrade in this environment, and I don\u2019t want to orphan you in the Material Realm. Ruwen glanced around the room and continued. \u201cSpirit is useless against Destruction Realm creatures, and that includes Mana. If you can externalize your Soul Power, you\u2019re safe to be alone. If you can\u2019t, only travel with someone who can. We\u2019ll search for a solution to this issue, but until we find viable protection, find a soul buddy.\u201d \u201cRami and Xavier agreed to spend the night organizing all the information we\u2019ve acquired. Tomorrow morning after breakfast, we\u2019ll discuss their detailed findings along with the surprise quests the Muses provided. We\u2019ll decide together how to proceed.\u201d \u201cAny questions or comments?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cWe need a watch schedule,\u201d Big D said. \u201cThank you, Big D. Once we understand the rate of decay this area generates, Overlord\u2019s team can easily keep us safe, but for tonight, we need the first few hours covered.\u201d Big D looked confused by the answer, so Ruwen clarified. \u201cI\u2019m headed over to meet my new alchemy friend for a bit of alchemical fun and games. When I return, I\u2019ll take the watch for the rest of the night.\u201d Ruwen\u2019s close friends looked concerned. Sift touched his chest. \u201cWhat about the, you know, issue? Will you be okay? I can come hang out.\u201d Ruwen resisted the urge to touch his chest. His soul remained injured from placing a city and all its inhabitants inside his soul vault. Even though he\u2019d only contained it for a second or two, it caused enough damage that his Soul Energy effectively didn\u2019t regenerate. Sift looked sincere and empathetic, even though he\u2019d faced Findley with the heart of a snake a few short minutes ago. \u201cThank you,\u201d Ruwen replied. \u201cWith all of my advantages, I\u2019ll be fine. Plus, you\u2019re the critical piece in our sleeping configuration as you have the most powerful soul here.\u201d Once again, Ruwen looked around at his team. \u201cI suggest everyone gather in the barracks and hang out in the common room there. I bet between Bliz, Chip, and Stump there will be more than enough to drink.\u201d \u201cFinally, he speaks some sense,\u201d Chip said. Ruwen glanced at the grinning Drakes before addressing the rest of the group. \u201cOne more thing, and this is probably the most important warning you\u2019ll receive here. If you value your life, or at least your organs, don\u2019t drink anything that Chip or Stump hand you unless you dilute it by at least a factor of a hundred. I strongly recommend starting the dilution at a thousand.\u201d \u201cWell, that was short-lived,\u201d Stump said. \u201cHe obviously needs a few shots to regain his sense.\u201d When Stump mentioned shots, a memory of Blapy taking shot after shot as she revealed some long-held secrets came to Ruwen. She had also revealed one of the secrets in Chip and Stump\u2019s powerful alcohol. Ruwen\u2019s Cleverness attribute triggered as his thoughts exploded with possibilities. Madda and Padda sat across from Ruwen, and he caught their gaze while pointing at Chip and Stump. \u201cWhile their brew will certainly destroy your liver, the reason why might prove to be exactly what we need. In fact, it might serve as the foundation for everything. If you have free time, please take some of their brew to the alchemy lab and work out which common binders work with the liquid.\u201d Once again, Ruwen wondered at Blapy\u2019s unbelievable pattern of placing critical pieces exactly where he could reach them. At the Savage Seven restaurant, she\u2019d made it sound like the addition of Chip and Stump was to get them out of her hair and maybe cause Ruwen a little grief. Except she\u2019d also revealed why the drakes\u2019 alcohol had such potency. It came from the Drakes addition of Soul Energy. And Soul Energy was exceptionally effective against the Shadow Realm. \n CHAPTER 31 Ruwen strode toward Barbas\u2019 camp, and he\u2019d left his shadow out to avoid suspicion. Even though he didn\u2019t have Soul Power available to defend himself, he had other methods to keep himself safe. Many alchemists had set up chairs and watched as Ruwen\u2019s camp took shape at an incredible pace. Once the newly harvested trees became a wall around his camp and blocked their view, the alchemists had returned to their camps. Ruwen\u2019s Divine hearing confirmed that Barbas had spread word that he\u2019d poisoned the arrogant new alchemist and his entire party, and the alchemists had initially gathered to watch everyone in Ruwen\u2019s camp die from massive hemorrhaging. Not a pleasant bunch. Ruwen hadn\u2019t yet crossed half the distance to Barbas\u2019 camp, when an explosion of activity broke out among the Grandmaster\u2019s tents. Perhaps Ruwen\u2019s sudden appearance, well past the time he should have bled to death, took them by surprise. The mask Ruwen wore tonight differed from what he\u2019d originally planned. Barbas\u2019 dismissive reaction to the gold mask had goaded Ruwen into thoughts of a pure terium mask. Ever since the revelation of Conceptual magic, or Psionics as the Nexus faction called it, he\u2019d paid more attention to his emotions and motivations. Emotions played a part in the Conceptual magic that Hamma used, and the vast difference between his harmonic view of the world and Gunder\u2019s had brought home in a very visual way how much he needed to learn. All of that went through Ruwen\u2019s mind as he examined how he\u2019d initially responded to Barbas\u2019 mockery. Sorting through emotions and motivations wasn\u2019t something Ruwen enjoyed, but this time it revealed a truth about himself that proved valuable. When Ruwen put the arrogant princeling in his place at Pour Judgement, he\u2019d considered the terium thread in the prince\u2019s shirt arrogant and wasteful. Now, less than a month later, he\u2019d nearly mirrored the prince\u2019s behavior. That scared him a little and demonstrated how valuable self-reflection could be for his growth. The path ended at the encampment and Ruwen was immediately surrounded by bubbling cauldrons, racks of herbs, and crates of minerals and other ingredients\u2014an alchemical treasure trove. Master alchemists peered out from tents and beside campfires, scowling and watching him closely, as if he might steal something. Ruwen hadn\u2019t expected friendliness, but the blatant hostility surprised him. The air felt dense with the thick scent of herbs and volatile concoctions, a stark contrast to the pristine wilderness surrounding them. Ruwen didn\u2019t bother looking for poison, which would be easy to hide in the haze. He doubted they could create anything that would severely hurt him. Barbas sat at the center of camp in what Ruwen would classify as a throne. A dozen Master alchemists surrounded Barbas like a swarm of flies. Bright shakers sat atop poles, creating a ring of light, enough to clearly see all the alchemists eyeing him with varying degrees of disbelief and disdain. \u201cSo, the motley stranger who dares call himself a Grandmaster has finally arrived,\u201d Barbas stated, his voice dripping with arrogance. \u201cI\u2019d begun to think you\u2019d lost your nerve.\u201d Barbas squinted at Ruwen, trying to see into the darkness under Ruwen\u2019s cowl. He happily turned his head a little, allowing the light to glint upon his mask. Barbas pressed his lips together, clearly frustrated by the obvious disrespect, but a second later it turned into a smile as he thought of an insult. \u201cA lead mask is fitting,\u201d Barbas said. \u201cThe metal of a novice, ignorant and easily melted, just like you.\u201d Ruwen gave a slight nod in acknowledgment of the comment. \u201cSo, you believe lead is a sign of ignorance or inferiority?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just my belief, but the belief of every true alchemist. I can only assume your mask reflects your education and abilities.\u201d The surrounding Master alchemists laughed. \u201cInteresting,\u201d Ruwen said thoughtfully. \u201cI might understand if your Master alchemists believed such nonsense but hearing it from a Grandmaster reflects poorly on you, your school, and your chapter.\u201d Barbas sneered. \u201cOh, please enlighten me, Grandmaster of the mythical Black Pyramid.\u201d Ruwen placed his hands behind his back and paced in front of the group as if he lectured a group of novices. \u201cLead is fundamental to the history of alchemy. It represents the base metal that alchemists throughout history sought to transmute into terium. This foundational role underscores its importance in our craft. Without lead, we wouldn\u2019t have the rich traditions and deep-rooted philosophies that have shaped alchemy into what it is today.\u201d Ruwen stopped and faced the group. \u201cI see you\u2019re not convinced. Let me continue. Lead embodies potential. Our ancient quest to transform lead into terium is far more than a mere physical transformation but represents an allegory for personal and spiritual development. A comparison to lead reflects untapped potential, of standing on the brink of profound transformation.\u201d Once again Ruwen stopped and studied the alchemists. \u201cNo? How about this then? \u201cWhat metal is more versatile than Lead? I\u2019ve used it in over twenty thousand methods, from shielding against harmful energies to stabilizing volatile compounds. This versatility reflects an alchemist\u2019s adaptability and resourcefulness, critical traits for success.\u201d This time Ruwen didn\u2019t pause, immediately explaining the fourth reason. \u201cLead is stable and reliable. It doesn\u2019t react easily, providing a solid foundation for experiments and concoctions. This stability is a virtue, reminding us that a strong, steady base is crucial for any great work in alchemy.\u201d Barbas opened his mouth to argue, but Ruwen continued to a fifth reason. \u201cThe process of transforming lead into terium\u2014whether literal or metaphorical\u2014symbolizes the transformative power of alchemy. Lead\u2019s very nature calls us to strive for greater achievements and deeper understanding. It\u2019s a reminder that transformation is at the heart of alchemy, and that every base material has the potential to become something extraordinary.\u201d The Master alchemists surrounding Barbas grew quiet and still, their disdainful looks fading into thoughtful reflection. Lastly, Ruwen said, \u201cLead is resilient. It resists corrosion and doesn\u2019t degrade over time, much like an alchemist must remain steadfast and resilient in their pursuit of knowledge and mastery. Comparing someone to lead highlights their enduring strength and the ability to withstand challenges and adversity.\u201d Ruwen paused, letting his words sink in. He could see flickers of understanding and appreciation growing in a few of the Masters\u2019 eyes. \u201cIn alchemy,\u201d Ruwen said as he looked directly at Barbas. \u201cWe learn to see beyond the surface, to understand the deeper essence of things. Being compared to lead is not a slight but a validation of one\u2019s potential, versatility, stability, transformation, and resilience. These qualities make great alchemists and are something every Grandmaster should recognize and encourage.\u201d Ruwen smiled behind his lead mask as a handful of Master alchemists nodded in agreement. He gazed at the Masters as he pointed at Grandmaster Barbas. \u201cSo, the next time someone compares you to lead, take it as a compliment. It means they see the potential for greatness within you, waiting to be transformed into something truly remarkable.\u201d \u201cBah,\u201d Barbas said with a wave of his hand. \u201cYour brain is as soft as lead. If an alchemist only needed to talk nonsense, I\u2019d perhaps believe you\u2019re a Grandmaster. It\u2019s too bad they don\u2019t offer a star for gibberish, then you might have earned one.\u201d Barbas flicked his arm making his robe snap. He rotated his right wrist toward Ruwen and displayed his Perfection\u2019s Proof alchemy mark. It was the second of the three marks and detailed the certifying institution, certifying Grandmaster, and certification rank. Barbas\u2019 alchemist mark consisted of a silver serpent coiled around a vertical staff. Above the serpent\u2019s head, a radiant sunburst illuminated the snake. The background featured a majestic griffin in mid-flight, its wings spread wide as alchemical flames licked its feathers. Surrounding the central image were seven towers each shaped differently, and the entire mark was encased in a circular border of intertwined vines and roots. Four large stars sat nestled in the border like points on a compass. Ruwen assumed this meant the Grandmaster had reached a superb rank in four of the eight disciplines which, according to Bliz, made the alchemist a rare genius among alchemical geniuses. Barbas glared expectantly and Ruwen guessed he was supposed to now show his Perfection\u2019s Proof mark. Before Ruwen did that though, he wanted to lock in the stakes. Madda and Padda had looked over the resource information of Barbas and determined the Grandmaster didn\u2019t possess anything they needed. It did reveal they were low on a few important and hard to find plants, so they\u2019d decided to use those as the stakes. Losing those resources would harm Barbas\u2019 productivity the most. Ruwen removed three bags containing those exact resources from his robes and held them out. Barbas flicked his head and one of the Master alchemists dashed over to retrieve the bags and take them to the Grandmaster. Barbas opened the first bag to reveal crimson root, a hardy plant with thick, dark red roots and vibrant green leaves. It emitted an earthy aroma mixed with a subtle, spicy undertone that reminded Ruwen of cinnamon, which then reminded him of Echo. The second bag held wind bloom with its slender stems and delicate, feather-like flowers that swayed gracefully in an invisible breeze. It smelled light and airy, like a spring morning. The last contained stone heart, a stout plant with broad, leathery leaves and a network of gnarled roots that grew in rocky soil. It smelled rich and loamy, like the freshness of newly turned soil. Barbas tried to keep his face neutral, but Ruwen easily detected the man\u2019s excitement. \u201cIf you can match these plants, then we can use them as the wager,\u201d Ruwen said. Barbas snapped his finger and the Master alchemists scrambled. Some fetched a large table and a couple of chairs, and others dashed off to gather the matching plants. Barbas sneered at Ruwen. \u201cEnough stalling. Show me your school mark. This will be the shortest alchemical competition I\u2019ve ever taken part in.\u201d Ruwen had practiced earlier, not wanting to fail in this situation, so he tapped his Energy pool and displayed his Perfection\u2019s Proof mark as a massive ten-foot symbol in the air between himself and Barbas. A Black Pyramid stood majestically with a black robed winged angel hovering behind it. Black, star speckled wings arced protectively over the structure. One of the blonde woman\u2019s hands stretched over the pyramid in blessing while the other held a balance that hid her face. A golden wreath encircled the design, along with eight large stars. Everything stopped, as the Master alchemists stared at the projection. The majority appeared stunned, and the rest disbelieving. \n CHAPTER 32 Barbas laughed. \u201cNow we know that you\u2019re a fake. What type of school awards eight stars? It\u2019s beyond ridiculous. You made a huge mistake in awarding yourself all eight when faking this mark. It also explains why you chose a mythical chapter to represent. Since it only exists in legends, there\u2019s conveniently no one to testify to your charade. I don\u2019t know how you fooled the Muses, but after I humble you and teach you some manners, I\u2019ll call upon Ceplotryn, heavens bless his name, to destroy your very existence.\u201d Ruwen leaned back only half needing to fake his shock. \u201cYou can summon your god?\u201d Barbas sneered. \u201cYou have no idea the extent of my power, you fool. Of course I can. I\u2019m a true Grandmaster alchemist, and the very gods recognize my brilliance.\u201d Bliz had emphasized the power Grandmaster alchemists wielded, but for the first time Ruwen truly appreciated the magnitude. Summoning one\u2019s deity was no small feat. Rami had worked at collecting Divine Realm gate runes in the event he needed to take the war to the deities. Ceplotryn ruled an area far to the west and south of Uru\u2019s lands, and Ruwen had never met him. Ruwen dismissed the projection of his mark and addressed Barbas. \u201cTo summon a god, well, that is impressive I must admit. Perhaps I misjudged you.\u201d He stepped to the table and sat on the simple stool the Master alchemists had provided. \u201cTo be completely honest, I\u2019d jumped to some conclusions about you. Secrecy and arrogance appear to cloak all Grandmasters as tightly as their tailored robes, but after listening to you complain to six deities for half an hour about the most trivial matters I could imagine, I added petty and entitled. I\u2019d assumed these were character flaws, but now I understand you wield the power of your god, Ceplotryn. If you really possess such power, I revise my assessment.\u201d Barbas stood as Ruwen spoke, and he glared murder at Ruwen. \u201cMy new judgment is not only are you petty and entitled, but also a bully, wielding the threat of your god\u2019s appearance like a tyrant.\u201d Barbas growled and his hands quickly became enveloped in fungus as the Grandmaster lost control of his magic. Spores created a cloud around the man and every Master alchemist within ten feet quickly retreated. The fungus made Ruwen curious, so he used Identify. Name: Barbas Hal\u2019phantis Relevant Title: Grandmaster Alchemist Deity: Ceplotryn Class: Druid Sub Class: Rotmancer Specialization: Blight Weaver Level: 78 Ruwen concentrated on the Blight Weaver Specialization to see the description. Description: Blight Weavers are experts at creating and spreading blight, a form of accelerated decay that affects both plants and creatures, sapping their strength and vitality. Rotmancer and Blight Weaver sounded amazing. Ruwen wanted to discuss an idea with Overlord, but that needed to wait until later. Barbas\u2019 level was lower than Ruwen expected from someone so old, but that probably stemmed from the Grandmaster\u2019s focus on alchemy and not adventuring. The Classes also meant Barbas probably had a great grasp on poisons. \u201cI see my eight stars has intimidated you to the point of violence,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cI expected as much.\u201d The comment didn\u2019t lessen Barbas\u2019 anger, but it did cause him to dispel his blight magic. Ruwen realized another reason Barbas held such power here. With a resource dependent profession like alchemy, losing all your plants and herbs to a sudden blight would prove catastrophic. He guessed it would only take a couple of days for Barbas to attack their camp from outside the walls. Barbas chuckled as if nothing had happened. He waved an arm at his Master Alchemists and the three bags of plants Ruwen had provided were placed in the middle of the table along with a matching three boxes containing Barbas\u2019s matching plants. A Master Alchemist approached with a tray he carefully placed in front of Ruwen. It contained an elixir, a powder, and a pill each marked with a number. This impressed him because it meant that despite Barbas\u2019 certainty that Ruwen would die a horrible and bloody death from the earlier poison, he\u2019d still prepared to test Ruwen. Barbas spoke. \u201cLet\u2019s begin with something simple: a Test of Knowledge. Your star proclaims you\u2019ve mastered herbalism and resource splicing. Let\u2019s see if you can even identify the herbs and ingredients in these concoctions.\u201d The Master alchemists\u2019 expressions ranged from amusement to anticipation, as they gathered around to study Ruwen\u2019s process. Ruwen didn\u2019t bother to activate Harmonic Sight or Knowledge. He felt confident with just his normal senses and started with a small vial containing a deep blue liquid. He uncorked it, and carefully waved a hand over the top to bring a small amount of the scent to his nose. With breathtaking speed, Ruwen\u2019s mind sifted through the catalog of scents and properties he\u2019d memorized along with the experiences of hundreds of alchemy-Minions and their thousands of experiments in the Black Pyramid lab. Ruwen had reached the Divine Tier and possessed the senses of an Angel. Only three levels outranked him\u2014Archangel, Demigod, and Deity\u2014even so, they would find it difficult to outperform his senses. Barbas smirked, confident this test would stump Ruwen. \u201cYou\u2019ll obviously require tools to assist in your analysis,\u201d Barbas said, \u201cwhich we\u2019ll provide upon request. You have an hour for each item.\u201d Many of the Master alchemists gasped at the short timeframe Barbas offered. The Grandmaster had made it impossible for Ruwen to succeed. \u201cI thank the Grandmaster for the consideration,\u201d Ruwen responded. \u201cI require neither. This elixir consists of coral eel extract mixed with greenthorn oil and stabilized with powdered asper leaf.\u201d The Master alchemists gasped again, and Barbas glared at them, silencing the eruption of muttering. \u201cAnd its purpose?\u201d Barbas asked. \u201cMainly used for underwater breathing and protection from the cold and pressure of deep water. I estimate this recipe would suffice for depths up to one thousand one hundred and thirty-six feet.\u201d Ruwen could think of a thousand ways to improve this recipe, but he only wanted to humble the Grandmaster Alchemist, not help him. Barbas\u2019s expression remained unchanged, but a flicker of surprise flashed in his eyes. \u201cCorrect. Move on.\u201d Ruwen ignored Barbas and waved another whiff of the elixir toward himself to give the impression he needed the extra input. In reality, he\u2019d instantly understood how to improve the rare elixir using the same ingredients, which he didn\u2019t mind revealing since this elixir was only rare. Without looking up Ruwen spoke loud enough that all the surrounding Master alchemists could hear. \u201cThis coral eel extract originated in a young healthy eel. It\u2019s counterintuitive, but older eels compensate for their lack of speed and movement by going deeper. Hence, with older eels you can generate a buff called High Altitude that thickens the blood and will at least double the duration of this elixir.\u201d Barbas tried to speak, likely to argue, but Ruwen continued over him. \u201cGreenthorn oil is stabilized with powdered asper leaf allowing it to combine effectively with the coral eel extract. This asper leaf was harvested in the summer, which is fine, and perhaps the Grandmaster intended this elixir to serve a specific purpose so didn\u2019t bother to maximize its components.\u201d Ruwen looked up from the elixir but not at Barbas. Instead, he spoke to the Master alchemists as if giving a lecture. \u201cI discovered something special about asper leaf. If you harvest the leaves in the fall\u2060\u2014\u201d Ruwen paused a moment, just long enough for Barbas to predictably interrupt. \u201cNonsense. What foolishness is this. If you wait until the fall the leaves are dead and dry and ninety-five percent of their potency is lost. Such ignorance.\u201d With a small nod Ruwen acknowledged Barbas. \u201cThe Grandmaster is correct of course regarding the loss of potency in the asper leaves; however, perhaps it has slipped his memory or perhaps he didn\u2019t know, but in the fall, as the leaves die, their stems concentrate the asper compound and enhance it, increasing the effectiveness.\u201d Ruwen could tell this was new information to the Grandmaster and he continued. \u201cSo, in the spring and summer one must only use the asper leaves as the stems will dilute the final powder and decrease the effectiveness. However, in the fall, the opposite is true. If the Grandmaster had used asper leaf stems harvested in the fall, the greenthorn oil would become fifty percent more effective.\u201d Some of the Master alchemists had quietly removed notebooks and made notes. \u201cSo, using the same ingredients, with a few modifications, the Grandmaster could have upgraded this elixir\u2019s quality from Rare to Special.\u201d Three seconds of silence passed. Barbas cleared his throat. \u201cWell obviously I knew that. It\u2019s common knowledge. Do you think I would entrust a Special quality elixir to your fumbling hands? Your answer is acceptable. Continue.\u201d Ruwen picked up the pill. It was small and unassuming with tiny green dots speckled across its surface. He rolled it between his fingers, brought it close to his nose, and then nodded. \u201cA telepathy pill. Mind root, crushed howler spine, idlewood sap, whispering mushroom, and nightshade for added potency. This pill spent six minutes too long in the kiln, lowering its potency by nine percent. The inclusion of nightshade is clever, but the Grandmaster lost forty-four percent of its effectiveness because he concocted the pill during the day instead of at night. Adding the nightshade on a moonless night would result in an additional eight percent effectiveness.\u201d Now nearly all the Master alchemists had journals open, furiously writing Ruwen\u2019s words. Ruwen\u2019s words had shocked Barbas into silence as the Grandmaster considered Ruwen\u2019s analysis. The truth was the elixir and pill were both incredibly difficult to concoct, and Barbas had certainly earned the title of Grandmaster. Compared to Ruwen though, the Grandmaster\u2019s skills resembled a toddler playing with clay. Barbas must have not trusted himself to speak because he just waved at the last item on the tray. Ruwen slid a crucible containing a fine powder that shimmered with a golden glow toward himself. He hesitated, his acquired knowledge and experience didn\u2019t recognize the strange powder immediately. Barbas saw the hesitation and pounced. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Grandmaster? Run out of guesses?\u201d Ruwen ignored the suddenly relaxed Barbas and his newfound confidence. He leaned closer to the powder, studying it. He couldn\u2019t immediately identify the ingredients, so they were likely all spliced, which upped the difficulty considerably. Five minutes passed and Barbas\u2019 good mood returned. He discussed Ruwen\u2019s obvious lack of qualifications quietly to his audience of Master alchemists, making sure to keep his voice loud enough that Ruwen could hear the insults. After the first minute, Ruwen felt confident he\u2019d identified the likely splices. The next four minutes he\u2019d spent trying to understand how Barbas had constructed the splices with his skills. Ruwen calculated he had a seventy percent chance of replicating the powder but it would require all his advantages: Divine senses, angel wings, Harmonic Sight, Harmonic Knowledge, and Harmony. There was no way Barbas had created this alone. In addition, the powder looked homogenous but it actually had two layers that acted in opposition to each other. A bit of humility washed back into Ruwen. He\u2019d been confident, rightfully so, that he could easily break down anything Barbas had created. What he hadn\u2019t expected was Barbas being clever enough to add something he hadn\u2019t constructed. But if Barbas hadn\u2019t concocted this then where did it come from? The powder contained what he believed was trapped Spirit, which was another mystery since Barbas had Ascended and used Mana. Ruwen had many misgivings about touching an item he didn\u2019t understand completely. Alchemy was full of tragic stories of foolish alchemists who pushed their quest for knowledge past their skills, killing themselves in the process. But, right now, Ruwen understood the irresistible pull of hidden knowledge and the longing to uncover it. \n CHAPTER 33 Hey Rami, I have an issue. That\u2019s surprising. I know. Do you have a minute? How are things back at camp? Chip and Stump sure know how to party. Oh, no. How bad is it? Sift is passed out. Hamma is casting Cure Poison on him every time her Mana recovers enough for the spell. Lylan is teaching Bliz, Wip, and Qip a terribly inappropriate ditty involving pirates and snapping her whip for emphasis. It turns out Chip\u2019s and Stump\u2019s brew is strong enough for her to actually get drunk, assuming she keeps drinking. A first since the hydra bonded with her. Most everyone else is raptly listening to Gunder play a lute as he orchestrates the entire scene into something like a play. It\u2019s fascinating, hilarious, and surprisingly enjoyable. Ruwen wished he was there. Is Ky back from talking with the Founders? Yes. Thankfully she returned before things got completely out of control. The three sisters send their regards, by the way, along with enough shadow-binding artifacts for all of us. Everyone\u2019s shadow is now locked away. Findley is still in the kitchen. Ky, Tremine, Big D, and Xavier are patrolling the perimeter until you return. What\u2019s up with you? Quicker if you looked. Ruwen felt the slight pressure of Rami moving through his memories. Interesting, Rami said. Why haven\u2019t you cast Identify on it? Pride? I can\u2019t hide anything from you. I feel like using Identify is cheating. I should be able to do this without any crutches. That\u2019s stupid. Is vision a crutch? Should I come over there and poke your eyes out? I get your point but Identify still feels like failure. Why not ask Arcanum? Let me guess. The same dumb reason. Arcanum started life as a Narrator spawned from the first alchemy book Ruwen ever received. A manual from the Black Pyramid. She\u2019d played a critical role in helping him reach Grandmaster and became a Grandmaster herself in the process. Summoning her to help would only require a thought. I know you think I\u2019m being irrational, but I only want to rely on myself. Identify and Arcanum are you. How do you overthink yourself into these situations? It\u2019s like telling a sculptor not to use their hands. Valora only uses one arm. True God help me, please recognize how far you\u2019re stretching your logic. You are literally using a psycho priestess from an enemy god as justification for being an idiot. Reformed psycho. I think she\u2019s just more of a normal crazy now. She sculpted an exact duplicate of the arm you cut off and launched at her. Then she gave it superpowers. Let\u2019s agree to disagree on psycho. Do you really think it\u2019s not cheating? Rami didn\u2019t respond right away. Maybe someone at the party occupied her attention. Eventually Rami replied and she sounded a little frustrated. If you touch an unfamiliar powder and something bad happens, I\u2019ll make sure all your friends know that at least you didn\u2019t cheat. Maybe Rami had a point. Fine, I\u2019ll cheat, but I don\u2019t like it. Somehow, I think you\u2019ll manage. Ruwen triggered Identify. Name: Powdered Channel Enhancer Source: Paragon Jewel of Basic Channeling Quality: Common Effect: Increase channel width by 0.1% on random Meridian. Description: Severely damaged Paragon Jewel of Basic Channeling. This Paragon Jewel has been crushed causing a 90% reduction of its effectiveness. Many things fell into place for Ruwen. The complexity of the powder. Barbas\u2019s brag that he could summon his deity. His confidence that Ruwen couldn\u2019t win this contest. Ruwen looked up at Barbas. \u201cYou are a liar. You didn\u2019t create this powder. It\u2019s a\u2060\u2014\u201d Barbas interrupted Ruwen by jumping to his feet and calling his god. Evidently, the source of this powder was something they wished to keep a secret. \u201cCeplotryn I beseech you, come to the aid of your faithful servant,\u201d Barbas yelled. He also triggered one of his rings\u2014which Ruwen surmised did the actual summoning, doubting Ceplotryn hung around waiting for his Grandmaster alchemist to call on him. Ruwen cast a Spirit version of the spell Ripen, which froze everyone in the camp in a type of suspended animation. Workers used this spell to transport fruit long distances by wagon. Barbas\u2019s tent stood thirty feet away, stone griffins stood on either side of the entrance. The right griffin glowed as a gate rune door appeared, and then Ceplotryn entered the Material Realm. Ruwen memorized the five symbols, giving him access to the god\u2019s Divine Realm. A cloaked figure stepped out of the gate and immediately cast an illusion fifty feet over the camp. Ruwen used Harmonic Sight and Knowledge to grasp the function of the illusion magic so he could compare it with what Stump taught him, hopefully soon. The illusion, typical of a god, was terrifying to look at. A twenty-foot-tall humanoid tree with dark knots for eyes and sickly green lichen drooping from the twisted branches of its form. Ceplotryn looked around. To the god\u2019s credit, it only took him a second to focus on Ruwen. \u201cWhat is the meaning of this? Who are you? And why have you placed my subjects in hibernation?\u201d \u201cGreetings, exalted Ceplotryn. I\u2019m a humble Grandmaster who only wishes a bit of information.\u201d Ceplotryn\u2019s examination smashed into Ruwen, and since he had an idea where this would end up, instead of scrambling the rude gesture with Harmony, he let the inspection surround him like a blanket. As Ruwen had hoped, the Scarecrow Aspect his body absorbed during his Divine Fortification rebuffed the intrusion. Ceplotryn\u2019s body language indicated he now took Ruwen a little more seriously. \u201cYou\u2019re not one of mine. Why can\u2019t I sense your allegiance?\u201d \u201cYou only need to ask. My allegiance is to myself.\u201d \u201cYou Grandmaster alchemists think too much of yourselves. Explain yourself immediately and I\u2019ll make your punishment merciful.\u201d \u201cOf course, that\u2019s what I wanted to do in the beginning.\u201d Ruwen gestured to the powder in front of him. \u201cI only wish to know the source of this powder.\u201d Ceplotryn pushed his Divine senses outward. Ruwen monitored them with Harmonic Sight. If the god did anything other than determine the powder\u2019s properties, like yanking it to himself, Ruwen would prevent it. Ceplotryn went still, and the illusion above disappeared. \u201cThat is none of your business, and I demand to know who you are and who you represent.\u201d \u201cIt appears you don\u2019t listen very well. I already told you I\u2019m a Grandmaster, and I represent myself.\u201d \u201cEnough,\u201d Ceplotryn said as he altered his Divine Domain, which acted as a personal, always-active Gravity Shell. It stretched outward to engulf Ruwen\u2019s upper body, quickly climbing to five times gravity\u2019s normal force. Ruwen didn\u2019t bother using his own Divine Domain to counter, instead letting the pressure build. His alchemical robe from the Black Pyramid remained unaffected, but the lead mask turned into liquid under the pressure and dripped off Ruwen\u2019s face and onto the table. Ruwen\u2019s hood still hid his face in shadow, however, so Ceplotryn couldn\u2019t identify him. \u201cA Diamond then,\u201d Ceplotryn said. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ve never met a god before, so you think you\u2019re all-powerful, but even a peak Diamond should recognize their limits. There is no comparison between our power.\u201d As a peak Diamond, Ruwen survived a god\u2019s attack, but he didn\u2019t need to argue the point now. It had occurred what felt like a long time ago, and the gulf between peak Diamond and Angel was vast. Ceplotryn increased the pressure ten times before speaking. \u201cA peak Diamond is not completely useless, and I\u2019m vaguely interested in your ability to cloak your spiritual network. Don\u2019t make this unpleasant and swear allegiance to me so you may survive the remaining seconds of my patience.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want trouble and only wish the details surrounding this powder. I already know that this wasn\u2019t its original form. Where did you find it, and do you have more?\u201d Ceplotryn chuckled to himself. \u201cAfter all this time, I\u2019m still shocked at how self-importance coupled with a narrow worldview leads to such spectacular arrogance.\u201d Ruwen stood. \u201cThe irony of that statement coming from you is rich. The problem with deities is that you\u2019ve lost touch with reality by constructing bubbles where you control everything.\u201d Ceplotryn shrugged. \u201cI tried doing this the nice way. Now I\u2019ll break every bone in your body over and over again until your skeleton looks like the powder you\u2019re so interested in.\u201d Ceplotryn increased his Divine Domain by a factor of a hundred, and Ruwen used his own Domain to keep the pressure away. Capitalizing on the learning experience, he used Harmony to identify the best method of disrupting Divine Domains, as that would surely come in handy in the future. Ruwen had only managed ten seconds of practice before Ceplotryn developed doubts that perhaps things weren\u2019t what they seemed. Ruwen expected Ceplotryn to change tactics, to try and determine which god he was, but Ruwen had underestimated the value of the powder and Ceplotryn\u2019s desire to keep it a secret. Harmonic Sight displayed harsh yellows in the space between Ruwen and Ceplotryn, deforming and compressing as the god shifted himself to stand next to Ruwen. Ruwen allowed Ceplotryn to grip his neck with one hand and reach for the powder with the other. Only then did Ceplotryn realize the powder had disappeared. \u201cAre you looking for your powder?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cThis would have been so much easier if you\u2019d just been polite. I\u2019ll ask you a final time nicely before things become very uncomfortable for you. Where did you get the jewel, and do you have any more?\u201d Ceplotryn tried to snap Ruwen\u2019s neck. Ruwen sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t fault you. Offense is the best defense, so they say, but that only works when your enemy is weaker.\u201d Ruwen used Harmony to pull a gust of wind toward himself, throwing his hood back and revealing his face. Ceplotryn went stiff, and his heart raced, which meant he recognized Ruwen. The god immediately released Ruwen\u2019s neck. \u201cArrogance aside,\u201d Ruwen said, \u201cthe reason you\u2019re still breathing is because you didn\u2019t immediately attack when you thought I was unfortified.\u201d Ruwen sensed energy build up in an amulet around Ceplotryn\u2019s neck. He recognized the spell, as he had a couple just like it. Instead of disrupting the spell, he allowed it to progress as Ceplotryn\u2019s earlier statement had given Ruwen an idea, but it would take one more lesson before Ceplotryn was receptive. As the spell reached its peak, Ceplotryn spoke. \u201cYou should have killed me when you had the chance. Fool.\u201d Ceplotryn disappeared in a flash of light. Overlord, make sure everybody is tucked away in there. We\u2019re going on a trip. Okay, I think only Vex is out. I\u2019ll fetch him. Rami, I\u2019m going to be a few more minutes here. Is everything okay at camp? Everything\u2019s fine here. Hamma has mostly finished rebuilding Sift\u2019s liver. Do you think you\u2019d be able to get away for a bit? I\u2019m guessing there might be a libr\u2060\u2014 I\u2019m on my way, Rami said, interrupting Ruwen. Ruwen laughed to himself. He hadn\u2019t even gotten the whole word out this time. \n CHAPTER 34 Rami arrived in less than a minute, morphing from her bookwrym form to her human one. \u201cWhat library?\u201d Rami asked. \u201cAnd why are all these people in hibernation?\u201d \u201cI was having fun playing this alchemy game,\u201d Ruwen paused and pointed at Barbas. \u201cHe gave me what I finally figured out was powdered Paragon Jewel. Then when I called him on it, he summoned his god.\u201d \u201cWhich one?\u201d \u201cCeplotryn. Do we know much about him?\u201d \u201cNot a lot. He isn\u2019t part of any of the larger factions and tends to keep to himself. His Ascendants inhabit a large forest in the distant southwest.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m guessing he\u2019s some type of sapient tree, right?\u201d \u201cYep. Is that how he showed up here?\u201d \u201cNo, he came in his human form. I suppose so he could speak with Barbas, but he placed an illusion in the sky that I\u2019m guessing is something like his true form.\u201d \u201cWhy, exactly, are we having this conversation?\u201d Ruwen held up a hand. \u201cNow hear me out.\u201d \u201cYou always say that before you propose a really dumb idea.\u201d \u201cMaybe, but I see an opportunity here. Let\u2019s meet at the Citadel platform. I want to get the others\u2019 opinions as well.\u201d They both manifested at the base of the Citadel in Ruwen\u2019s mind that rested on the hand of the thousands-of-miles-tall-four-faced statue of Ruwen. A heartbeat later Overlord, Uruziel, and Sivart arrived. \u201cI\u2019ll get right to the point,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cWe have a valuable opportunity here. I have the gate runes for Ceplotryn\u2019s Divine Realm, and I\u2019d like more experience fighting in such places. We all know, if things go poorly, that I might be battling a lot of deities, so the more experience I have dealing with gods in their own realms, the better off I\u2019ll be.\u201d \u201cHow strong is this god?\u201d Overlord asked. Rami replied, \u201cHe\u2019s above average and keeps to himself.\u201d \u201cObviously, I\u2019m also going to learn about the Paragon Jewel. I want to know where he got it, even if it was just a rift in his own domain. I want to know what he had to do to get it. Any information surrounding it, actually. Most importantly, I want to know if he has any more.\u201d \u201cKnowledge is the currency of the wise,\u201d Sivart said. \u201cWe have only battled in Lalquinrial\u2019s realm, which might not provide a typical baseline. Battling among leaves doesn\u2019t prepare one for the dunes. The more varied our experience, the better our chances of success.\u201d \u201cExcellent point, Sivart. I also want to experiment with the strength of our mental connection, and this is also good for that. The chance of an ambush is unlikely, as he had no idea who I was until the end. The fact that he\u2019s a loner also works to our benefit, as he might be less inclined to summon help\u2014if gods even do that in their own realms.\u201d \u201cWhat are the backup plans?\u201d Uruziel asked. \u201cMy soul still hasn\u2019t recovered, so my instant soul-powered gateways aren\u2019t available. If I have time, I can do it the old-fashioned way. The recall on my scarecrow aspect is available, as is the one on my Ink Lord armor.\u201d \u201cWhat about Rami?\u201d Overlord asked. \u201cWe have a theory that we haven\u2019t tried, but we believe will work. Remember when I stuck Lylan in my Void Band and launched her out of it during our fight in front of the Third Temple? I\u2019ll do the same with Rami. I\u2019ll stuff her in my inventory, recall, and release her. Granted, this isn\u2019t the best time to try that for the first time, but we\u2019ve been too busy to experiment. But I get your point\u2026\u201d He turned to Rami. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk, and maybe you shouldn\u2019t go.\u201d Rami opened her mouth to argue, but Ruwen held up his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t get upset. If he has a library, once the fight is done, I\u2019ll come get you. In the meantime, you can study that powdered Paragon Jewel.\u201d The logic soothed Rami, and she nodded her agreement. \u201cSo what I specifically want to accomplish is this: How hard is it to kill gods in their own realms? How fast do they regenerate? Is it possible for me to disrupt their connection to their realm? How stable are your connections to me inside a foreign Divine Realm? Information about the Paragon Jewel or any other valuable knowledge or items.\u201d \u201cDo you plan on killing him?\u201d Uruziel asked. \u201cThat depends on Ceplotryn. I have an idea for a different arrangement, but if that doesn\u2019t work out\u2014then, yes.\u201d Uruziel gave a short nod of understanding. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d Overlord and Sivart quickly agreed as well. \u201cI know I\u2019m still low on Spirit, but Ceplotryn\u2019s realm should have plenty, and that is another thing we can test. Can I harvest inside another god\u2019s Divine Realm? If I can\u2019t harvest there, then limit yourselves to half of my current reserves.\u201d Ruwen focused on Overlord. \u201cI know how excited you get, and the temptation to generate an entire army might be hard for you to resist.\u201d Overlord\u2019s shoulders slumped, and even Sivart looked sad. Uruziel patted Overlord on the back. \u201cYour day will come.\u201d Ruwen and Rami returned to the Material Realm and Rami took a seat. Ruwen handed her the powder so she could study it. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid,\u201d Rami said without looking up, \u201cand if anything looks off, bail. We don\u2019t need those answers so urgently to justify risk.\u201d \u201cGood point. You know I wouldn\u2019t have suggested this if I didn\u2019t think it presented an amazing opportunity.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d Rami responded, looking up. \u201cYou are truly the god of creating opportunities.\u201d Ruwen grinned at her. \u201cI\u2019ll take that. It\u2019s way better than Sift\u2019s god of pastries.\u201d Rami refocused on the powder, but still replied. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a lot more popular. Opportunity travels with hard work and usually pain. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s that people prefer donuts to extra work.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a popularity contest.\u201d Rami froze for a moment, just long enough for Ruwen to catch it. \u201cWhat?\u201d Ruwen asked. Rami glanced up at Ruwen. \u201cI know you were just joking, but something occurred to me. Those artifacts that Valora makes absorb Conceptual magic, right. One of those is Faith. In fact, that was one of the concepts Nymthus and her city generated and stored in that sculpture.\u201d Ruwen immediately understood. \u201cA deity that had mastered such magic could use the faith and happiness of their followers. Uru help me, that\u2019s huge.\u201d \u201cWhy are you frowning?\u201d Ruwen rubbed his temples. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026I\u2019m having difficulty grasping the Conceptual stuff. Gunder has a way to help me, but I haven\u2019t made any progress.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a victim of your own success. Your high Intelligence and Wisdom have made everything easy for you until now. Throw in your inhuman work ethic, and doing the impossible becomes commonplace. It only makes sense you\u2019d hit something that balanced that path eventually.\u201d Ruwen\u2019s Cleverness Attribute sent a spear of ice through his mind, reminding him of the early days when his Cleverness had been lower. Whatever Rami\u2019s words triggered revealed something huge. \u201cBalance?\u201d Ruwen asked, not wanting to lose this opportunity. \u201cWhy did you pick that word?\u201d Rami frowned at Ruwen. \u201cThat\u2019s a strange question coming from you. Aren\u2019t you the personification of balance? You discovered an entire new branch of magic with your Harmony because of it. You took the Bamboo Viper Steps\u2019 concepts of balance to an entirely new level, and\u2060\u2014\u201d Ruwen groaned in pain and Rami jumped up to steady him. He squeezed his temples, trying to massage the pain away. As it disappeared, he hunched over, putting his hands on his knees. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Rami knelt and looked at Ruwen. Ruwen squeezed his eyes shut as memories circled each other, but he nodded to Rami so she wouldn\u2019t worry. Hopefully the worst of the pain had passed. Hundreds of memories related to balance circled a central memory. Most dealt with the Bamboo Viper Steps, more recent ones with Harmony, just as Rami had suggested. For the first time, he evaluated the central memory through the prism of balance. Ruwen opened his eyes and met Rami\u2019s concerned gaze. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Do you remember the Realm Zipper that Tarot took us to?\u201d To Ruwen\u2019s surprise, Rami immediately became nervous, maybe even guilty. Why would she react like that? He needed to dig into that later, right now he didn\u2019t want to lose his train of thought. After too long of a pause, Rami responded. \u201cOf course.\u201d \u201cI saved us by pushing Harmony deep enough into the fabric of the Universe to touch the femites there. Do you remember what it took to accomplish that?\u201d \u201cUruziel and Overlord covered your soul.\u201d \u201cExactly. Smothered would be a better word. Do you remember why?\u201d \u201cYou heard your soul. It was too loud and drowned out the femites you searched for.\u201d \u201cDo you see it yet?\u201d Rami shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t\u201d \n CHAPTER 35 \u201cWait,\u201d Rami said, \u201cdo we have time for this discussion?\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cBecause of Ceplotryn? He isn\u2019t going anywhere, and I think I just understood something insanely important.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d Ruwen looked at the night sky as he organized his thoughts. \u201cMy revelation explains something else that bothered me.\u201d He turned his attention to the frozen alchemists before focusing on Rami. \u201cFrom those Outerverse quests, we know the Harmonic faction requires a hundred-year delay before joining the Luminara for a soul or the Radiant for chakras. I\u2019d assumed the wait related to the Harmonics own backup mechanism, the Identity Lattice. I figured a Harmonic might need that long to master that magic, and since Harmonics were so valuable, the hundred years kept the other factions away.\u201d \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d \u201cAnd maybe that theory is still true, but your comment about balance led to another possibility. One that feels so right, I\u2019m certain it\u2019s the truth. My own experience at the Realm Zipper confirms it, and I think it\u2019s happening again with the Conceptual magic.\u201d Rami frowned and Ruwen almost laughed at the childish look. \u201cYou said it yourself,\u201d Ruwen whispered. \u201cBalance. Why did I have a hard time hearing the femites? Because my soul was too loud. Why was that? Because I\u2019d leveled it. The more progress I make in one type of magic, the harder the others become. Harmonics in the Outerverse are kept away from Luminara souls and Radiant chakras because they interfere with the development of Harmony. Its only after the Harmonics are sure you suck at Harmony that they allow you to take another factions\u2019 backup method.\u201d Comprehension lit Rami\u2019s eyes. Ruwen laughed, but it came out a bit hysterical. \u201cEverything is connected, all these magics, but you can only interact with them in a balanced way. Had my soul been level three, like Sift\u2019s, I wouldn\u2019t have heard the femites. In fact, my level two soul prevented it. Only Overlord\u2019s painful sacrifice to silence my soul allowed me to succeed. It explains my complete block regarding Psionics. Pen was on the right track in his journals. He\u2019d suspected they might be related but he didn\u2019t have the information we do now.\u201d A Notification softly pulsed at the bottom of Ruwen\u2019s vision. \u201cWait,\u201d Rami said. \u201cI understand most of what you said, but how does it explain the problems with Psionics?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m out of balance,\u201d Ruwen said simply. \u201cYou need to do better than that.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s leave Spirit out of the equation for now. Pen thought it only acted as a foundation for all the other magics, but as complex as all this has become, it probably is another layer I haven\u2019t understood yet.\u201d \u201cHow about explaining what you do understand,\u201d Rami said a little frustrated. \u201cOr I\u2019m going to jump in your head and just look for myself.\u201d Ruwen laughed again, the aftereffects of his breakthrough receding. \u201cNow I picture magic as a pie with six slices. Soul opposite Chakra\u2014Primal opposite Psionic\u2014Mind opposite Body. Harmony sits in the middle, like a bridge between them all. If we assume that magics adjacent to each other are easier to learn, and we place them like this\u2060\u2014\u201d Ruwen knelt and used his finger to draw a circle. At the top he placed Mind, then going clockwise he added Psionics and Chakra. At the bottom he wrote Body, then Primal, and finally Soul. Ruwen used his finger to point as he spoke. \u201cLylan is using Primal magic, and it\u2019s related to blood. But I witnessed her using Energy from her body to amplify her magic during the fight in the Infernal Realm. Pen confirmed perfecting his body with the Bamboo Viper Steps helped him find his Chakras.\u201d Rami knelt as well and pointed to Psionics right next to Mind. \u201cWith your Mental Power, wouldn\u2019t that mean Psionics should be easier for you because they\u2019re adjacent.\u201d \u201cIt should be, but I have two theories on why it might already be too late to learn. First, I\u2019ve spent the last few years perfecting my body, and I already had a head start with my mind. We both know how much my mind has grown. Instead of a level pie surface, I\u2019ve created a huge ridge down the middle connecting the Mind, Harmony, and Body magics. Psionics, Chakras, and Primal are level zero and far below this ridge. They\u2019re like distant valleys.\u201d \u201cYou managed to level your soul though.\u201d \u201cTrue, but that stemmed from my mental development. My knowledge growth, because of all the Narrators, surpassed anything remotely normal, and knowledge happens to be one of the methods to level a Soul. If anything, it points to how far my mental abilities have outpaced everything else. The second issue is Harmony. Through Gunder I can literally see how much of the world I\u2019m missing. I fear leveling Harmony will pull my Mind and Body magic higher as well, further increasing the distance between the magics I\u2019ve leveled and those I haven\u2019t.\u201d The two of them stared at the drawing in silence. \u201cHow do you fix it?\u201d Rami asked. Ruwen frowned as he formed his response. \u201cI need to stop developing Harmony and halt my mental advancement. I need to work on my Chakras, whatever those are. Thankfully I have Hamma and Lylan who can help guide me in Psionics and Primal magics. If I can increase my levels in those magics and regain some balance, I can work on Harmony again.\u201d \u201cLalquinrial is working on the Harbinger quest as well,\u201d Rami said quietly. \u201cWhat if all this balance stuff you want to do allows him to pass you. We can\u2019t let him become the Harbinger.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d Ruwen said and pinched his lip. \u201cI want\u2060\u2014\u201d Rami interrupted. \u201cWhat you always want. You want it all and you want to do it perfectly.\u201d Ruwen didn\u2019t respond, knowing Rami spoke the truth. After ten seconds Ruwen\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cIf I need to, I\u2019ll abandon balance. I\u2019ll use what I have to advance Harmony enough to become the Harbinger.\u201d Rami placed a hand on Ruwen\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know you will. Hey, you\u2019re not alone, and the fact you figured all this out means it\u2019s only a matter of time until you discover a way to take advantage of it.\u201d That produced a small smile from Ruwen. \u201cYeah.\u201d They both stood and Ruwen swiped his boot across the drawing. He went to do it again and Rami gasped. \u201cWhat?\u201d Ruwen asked. Rami pointed at the mostly destroyed drawing. The only thing that remained were the partial sections of Psionics and Primal. \u201cDo you see it?\u201d Rami asked. \u201cThe irony of that sketch, here, amongst all your fellow alchemists\u2026it\u2019s like the Universe is poking fun of you.\u201d Ruwen studied the remains and shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re closer to your goals than you think,\u201d Rami whispered her voice solemn \u201cIn fact, I wonder if a part of you had already figured out this structure. It would make your choice more sensible.\u201d \u201cNow you\u2019re stalling on purpose. Spill it.\u201d Rami grinned mischievously. \u201cWaiting isn\u2019t so fun now, is it?\u201d \u201cCome on, Rami, you know my curiosity is killing me. What did you just figure out?\u201d Rami knelt, and next to Psionics she wrote \u201cConcept\u201d and next to primal she wrote \u201cBlood.\u201d She glanced up at Ruwen to see if he\u2019d figured it out. \u201cSo much for that vaunted Cleverness of yours. Maybe you used it all up. Fine, one more clue. It\u2019s like handing it to you on a silver platter.\u201d Rami slowly crossed out \u201cConcept\u201d and replaced it with another word: \u201cLuck.\u201d \u201cDarkness take me,\u201d Ruwen whispered. \u201cRami, you\u2019re a genius.\u201d Rami stood. \u201cI\u2019m not, but I know a guy. Sometimes things are hard to see because they\u2019re too close.\u201d Ruwen hugged Rami tightly. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a batch.\u201d \u201cLucky me,\u201d Rami said with a laugh as she squeezed Ruwen. She released him. \u201cNow go learn how to kill a god in their own Realm. We\u2019ll talk with the Addas when you get back and figure out the best way to approach this.\u201d Ruwen swiped his foot across the remains of the drawing and verified the surrounding alchemists would remain in their hibernation for another few hours. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cWhat if the time is really different and you come back a year from now?\u201d \u201cAll the dimensional training I\u2019ve gotten from your boyfriend and Tremine allows me to detect things like that now. I\u2019m not great at it yet, but I could feel the flow of time on Ceplotryn when he stepped through the gate rune doorway. His Divine Realm is close to the standard flow, just like here. I appreciate the concern though. That\u2019s something I never took seriously until we went to your mom\u2019s Divine Realm.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a relief. Be safe.\u201d Ruwen nodded and strode to the stone griffin that Ceplotryn had used. Before he drew the gate runes that would take him to the god\u2019s Divine Realm, he pulled up the details of the connection that Rami had seen. Name: Fortune\u2019s Blessing Type: Recipe Quality: Legendary Result: Liquid Luck \u2013 Each drop permanently alters the Karmic value of any item or entity by the imbued value. Restriction: Mark of an Alchemical Grand Master of Fortune required during entire creation sequence. Restriction: Liquid Luck is ineffective on the alchemist who created it. Description: Arguably the rarest substance in the Universe, Liquid Luck contains the actual luck of its creator, transferred to the concoction via their own blood. The Grand Master of Fortune can transfer up to all their available luck, which they will regain at the pace of one point per week. The blood of a Grand Master of Fortune contains the power to turn an ordinary sword into a legendary blade, peril into safety, or a copper coin into vast wealth. Blood combined with a concept. It bridged two of the magics Ruwen needed to advance in. The sword Pen had left him granted Ruwen fifty luck, forty-seven after considering Tarot\u2019s bad luck, and another twenty-five came from one of his Grandmaster Fortune abilities. Had those seventy-two points of luck pointed him in the right direction and provided a route to possibly fix what had, until moments ago, felt like an overwhelming obstacle? Ruwen had literally sketched the answer to his problem, in the middle of an alchemical quest, surrounded by hundreds of alchemists, and not recognized that alchemy provided a solution. It was just another example of why friends were critical. Closing the description Ruwen opened his summarized Notifications. Gong! You have increased your Knowledge! Level: 2,150 Knowledge - seized by intelligence, tempered by wisdom, balanced between peril and power - illuminates greatness. Ruwen\u2019s discovery about the relationships between the various magics had advanced his Knowledge from one thousand three hundred thirty-one to two thousand one hundred and fifty. An increase of eight hundred and nineteen. It had even changed the Knowledge description again. A quick Profile check revealed Ruwen\u2019s new Cleverness percentage. Cleverness: 4,351% It felt satisfying to figure out such a deep secret of this Universe. Armed with this information, he had a chance to find out where true balance might lead. Ruwen pulled the hood of his robe forward to hide his face again. He quickly sketched the gate runes for Ceplotryn\u2019s Divine Realm on the griffin\u2019s oversized wing. With a final wave at Rami, he stepped through the gateway. \n CHAPTER 36 Ruwen exited the rune gate with a steady heart rate despite the situation\u2019s danger. Before him, Ceplotryn\u2019s Divine Realm stretched, a lush and twisted labyrinth of towering trees, their gnarled roots entwined with the misty undergrowth. Ceplotryn\u2019s power lay thick in the air. The power of the god infused every leaf and particle of soil. Above, swirling emerald and obsidian clouds raced across the sky, casting an eerie, diffused light that pulsed with the life force of Ceplotryn himself. Ruwen glanced behind him and discovered he\u2019d exited from one of the forest\u2019s enormous trees. Dark green foliage covered the ground and purple vines wrapped the trees. Not sensing any immediate danger, Ruwen willed his Ink Lord\u2019s Wraps to deploy. He\u2019d waited until entering the Divine Realm to be sure they\u2019d work properly here. The armor activated under his Grandmaster Alchemist robe, and he reviewed the capabilities of his most powerful armor. Name: Ink Lord\u2019s Wrap AC: 2,250 Quality: Legendary Durability: 3,000 of 3,000 Effect (Passive): Know It All: +50 Intelligence. Effect (Passive): First Edition: Reduce all magical damage by 33%. Effect (Passive): Lost and Found: If the Ink Lord is separated from the armor by more than fifty feet, it will teleport to the Ink Lord\u2019s right wrist. Effect (Triggered): Top Shelf: Once per hour, create a staircase made from air with a max height of 200 feet and max weight of 500 lbs. Effect (Triggered): Librarian\u2019s Hush: Once per day, restore silence to your library by suppressing all sound in a 1,000-foot sphere for five seconds. Effect (Triggered): Book Burning: Once per month, grant elemental immunity to all inanimate objects in a 1,000-foot sphere for thirty minutes. Effect (Triggered): Ink Lord\u2019s Paper Knife: Create a small temporary blade suitable for slicing open pages or unruly patrons. Blade\u2019s composition dependent on focus. Inflicts 12 to 24 Piercing damage. Effect (Triggered): Bookmark: Set location and, once per day, instantly return there. Restriction: Black Pyramid Ink Lord. Description: Small off-white scroll made from Dragon Spider Webbing. The librarian can wrap and unwrap themselves with a thought, offering protection while carrying out the duties of the Black Pyramid Ink Lord. Stain-resistant inside and out for the Ink Lord\u2019s inevitable bloody demise. The Ink Lord\u2019s Wrap covered his body completely in scrolls, each containing roving words and symbols that only a handful of people in the Universe could comprehend. The only jewelry Ruwen wore was a plain black dimensional ring adorned with white esoteric runes moving across the band, detailing events from the past, present, and future. Pen had gifted Ruwen this item\u2014the Apocalypse Hoop\u2014and it contained five storage slots. With a thought, Ruwen summoned the sword Pen had gifted him, which he kept in the Apocalypse Hoop, and the blade sprung into his right hand. He still needed practice with the sword, so he dismissed it back into the ring\u2019s storage, satisfied to know he could summon it if required. Tarot\u2019s marks lined Ruwen\u2019s right wrist, and another mark resided in the sword. They were the only prepared magic Ruwen had, and he reviewed them just in case. Relic Mark: Reversed High Priestess Trigger: Secret Veil \u2013 While motionless, cloak yourself in an impenetrable veil. Relic Mark: The Emperor Trigger: Show of Respect \u2013 Force every being in a fifty-foot radius to their knees for three seconds. Relic Mark: The Hanged Man Trigger: Instant Martyr \u2013 Swap places with any being within sight. And on the sword: Relic Mark: The Empress Trigger: Eternal Spring \u2013 Resurrect all allies within fifty feet who have died less than 60 seconds in the past, reviving them to full health with a shield equal to half their health. An itchy pulling sensation in Ruwen\u2019s chest warned him that Overlord, Uruziel, and Sivart had tapped his Core to create their Minions and would appear momentarily. Instead of them appearing instantly, it took a second. A black armored figure appeared. \u201cIt\u2019s like moving through molasses to get out here,\u201d Overlord said. Uruziel appeared and a second after that Sivart did. \u201cIs it safe for you to be out here?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cLet me test the emergency retreat,\u201d Overlord said as his Minion went still. \u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d Overlord said, \u201cThere\u2019s no resistance to the return, it only appears when trying to enter the Realm.\u201d \u201cGreat,\u201d Ruwen replied. \u201cKeep in mind that might change when the fighting starts, so stay close.\u201d Ruwen had hundreds of spells that consumed Spirit but were based on their Mana and Energy counterparts. He still couldn\u2019t use Soul Energy due to the damage, but his Mental Energy bar was full, and a quick check showed Harmony somewhat worked. Ruwen\u2019s only other prepared magic came from the Faction choices he\u2019d made. The Luminara Soul spell wouldn\u2019t work for him right now, but he had the Harmonic one. Name: Minor Prelude of Stillness Description: Tranquility of silence. Reduce all frequencies to zero in a 20-mile radius for 3 seconds. Casting Time: Instant Cost: Mental Energy \u2013 50 per second channeled Cooldown: 1 minute from end of spell After the fight finished, Ruwen would use his new Grandmaster of Fortune Boon for the first time. Description: Fortune\u2019s Discovery \u2013 locate rare, valuable, and unique alchemical resources regardless of how they are hidden. Discovery radius 1 foot for every 1 Alchemy Skill level. Ruwen tried opening his Void Band, but it didn\u2019t work, which he\u2019d expected. Sivart had taken to the air on an agile-looking Dragon-Minion. Overlord and Uruziel had split off, one to each side of Ruwen, protecting his flanks. Sivart spoke over their permanent mental connection. Enemy a thousand feet from your two o\u2019clock. He\u2019s staring in your direction and looks prepared to fight. I\u2019ll monitor for enemies and keep an eye on what\u2019s behind you. Thanks everyone. Ruwen replied. Ruwen switched to Harmonic Sight and Knowledge and found the environment saturated with a brown haze that he assumed represented Ceplotryn\u2019s power. It swirled suddenly, as if a giant invisible hand had passed. Just as Ruwen suspected, the appearance of the three sentient acting Minions would force Ceplotryn to act and allow Ruwen to gauge the god\u2019s power. Recall! Ruwen shouted over his mental link. The trees, foliage, and vines surrounding Ruwen compressed so violently that they ignited from the friction of their own collapse. Even the air turned into a conflagration. Ruwen\u2019s Divine Domain kept the immense pressure and heat from his body. Is everyone safe? Ruwen asked. Yes, Overlord responded. Thanks for the heads up. I didn\u2019t sense the shift. Ruwen created a normal Minion and shielded it with his power. He sent it into the inferno and monitored his connection to it. If I strengthen the connection with Mental Energy, I can keep it from collapsing. That\u2019s great news, Uruziel responded. For now, you three stay inside. We\u2019ve already gained a lot of critical information. Let\u2019s see what else surfaces before you risk yourselves. The surrounding flames snuffed out as the air compressed beyond the point it could burn, liquid air fell around Ruwen like rain. The entire area between him and Ceplotryn had disappeared. Ruwen\u2019s gaze landed on a clearing where Ceplotryn waited, a colossal figure of twisted wood and dead leaves. His eyes glowed like coals set deep within a bark-covered face. Sickly green lichen hung from his branches, giving him an even more intimidating presence. \u201cYou dare to challenge me in my own Realm?\u201d Ceplotryn\u2019s voice boomed, his massive trunk acting like an echo chamber, and causing his words to travel like a thunderclap. Ruwen wanted to speak with Ceplotryn but knew a demonstration of power would be required before any meaningful dialogue could occur. So, Ruwen responded not with words but action. Raising his right hand, palm outstretched, Ruwen summoned Arcane Maelstrom\u2014a swirling vortex of shimmering, azure energy that crackled and raised the hair on his arm. He thrust his palm forward, directing the energy storm at Ceplotryn. The tempest of agitated Spirit mixed with Mental Energy tore across the landscape, carving a swath of steam through the liquified air covering the ground. Stone and chunks of trees that had survived the worst of Ceplotryn\u2019s first attack exploded upward in a shower of destruction before the spell collided with the god. The impact erupted in a spectacular explosion of white light and a cracking boom, momentarily illuminating the realm with its brilliance. The blast consumed Ceplotryn, his form disintegrating into countless fragments of bark and leaf that scattered in the violent winds around the detonation. However, before Ruwen could advance, the particles swirled and coalesced, reforming the god\u2019s body with horrifying speed. Within moments, Ceplotryn stood whole again, his menacing knot filled smile visible through the settling dust. Ceplotryn laughed, a sound like the creaking of ancient trees in a storm. \u201cYou\u2019re a fool, Ruwen Starfield. God Killer. Here, in my Divine Realm, I am invincible. Your powers are meaningless against me.\u201d Ruwen attempted a Blink to Ceplotryn\u2019s location, but he couldn\u2019t make the spell work with Spirit. He added Mental Energy and managed to Blink within fifty feet of the tree. Ceplotryn loomed over Ruwen. Ruwen cast Jumbo and matched the god\u2019s two-hundred-foot height. The area around them turned green with moss. \u201cIs that the extent of your might, little Angel?\u201d Ceplotryn asked. \u201cLet me show you power nurtured through eons.\u201d Ceplotryn extended four branches. \u201cVerdant Wrath,\u201d he hissed as two titanic tendrils of knotted wood and thorns erupted from the ground, striking Ruwen like angry serpents, their thorns gleaming with a sickly green poison. Ruwen leaped to the side, rolling across the moss-covered ground as the tendrils crashed into the space where he\u2019d just stood. The spell left deep furrows in the ground before exploding, launching the thorns outward in every direction like a hail of deadly arrows. Ruwen waved his arm, creating a shield to block the thorns. Without Mental Energy to strengthen the shield the spell\u2019s Spirit bent to Ceplotryn\u2019s will, and the thorns easily passed. The thorns penetrated Ruwen\u2019s alchemy robe and smashed against his Ink Lord\u2019s Wrap. The velocity of the thorns pushed Ruwen backward a step but didn\u2019t penetrate his armor. He cursed his judgement and willed the Grandmaster\u2019s robe into his Apocalypse Hoop. Miranda would be furious if he destroyed the robe on his first day with it. Increasing the percentage of Mental Energy in the next spell to twenty percent, Ruwen mixed it with raw Spirit into a spell he called Searing Crazor in honor of its inspiration. Ten intense beams of dazzling red light erupted from the crystals that formed on his fingertips. The channeled spell struck Ceplotryn\u2019s chest, piercing through the god\u2019s torso and casting a brilliant web of light across the clearing as it exited his back. Ruwen crossed his arms, and the beams followed, slicing Ceplotryn into dozens of pieces. The charred pieces of Ceplotryn smoked as the god toppled to the ground. He shattered into multiple fragments burning like a thousand torches. Ceplotryn\u2019s flaming and singed form regenerated just as swiftly as before. \u201cFutile,\u201d he growled, the ground beneath him rumbling as he gathered power. \n CHAPTER 37 Ruwen had hoped the addition of Mental Energy to his spells would overcome Ceplotryn\u2019s control of his Realm. Such a solution would simplify Ruwen\u2019s strategy. He hadn\u2019t figured out a way to mix Mental Energy and Spirit past twenty percent, as the Spirit turned too unstable. Ceplotryn chuckled, which sounded like snapping branches. \u201cAlready having second thoughts I see.\u201d With a swift motion, Ceplotryn raised a branch, and the ground beneath Ruwen erupted with a net made of lichen. It exploded upward, aimed to entangle his limbs. Ruwen leaped back, his movements fluid and precise. Learning from the previous shield, Ruwen used pure Mental Energy and conjured a shield of shimmering power that deflected the net back to the ground. Ceplotryn didn\u2019t relent. He extended another branch, summoning a torrent of ghostly green flames that surged towards Ruwen. The flames twisted and danced, embodying the destructive power of Ceplotryn\u2019s will. Ruwen countered with a version of the Collector spell Sunburn, forming a barrier that absorbed the flames and funneled the energy to his Core. A second later Ruwen\u2019s Core exploded with pain, and he staggered backward clutching his chest. Ruwen activated Last Breath. Uruziel, what was that? Despicable, Uruziel responded. He\u2019s only risking it because he\u2019s in his own Realm where no one can see it. See what? My Core hasn\u2019t hurt like this since Simandreial almost ripped it from my body. Ceplotryn is hiding Soul Power inside his Spirit spells in the hopes of getting Soul Power into your Core. It\u2019s cowardly and can cause immense damage to another person\u2019s Core, pathways, and Meridians. Because of that its use is banned in deity combat. It never dawned on either Uru or me to mention it since no deity would ever risk its use. The other deities would destroy them for utilizing such a despised method. Except, like you said, no one can see us. Sorry, Ruwen. I\u2019ll search Uru\u2019s memories for anything else like this. How does it work and how do I fix it? The spell you absorbed contained Soul Energy, which you brought into your Core. Mixing energies is dangerous as you\u2019ve discovered with your experiments combining Mental Energy and Spirit. That Soul Energy will eventually work its way out of your Core, but it will cause a lot of pain and interfere with your ability to use Spirit. Under no circumstances should you cycle Spirit through your Meridians. It will extend the time it takes to recover and do more damage. Ruwen stopped himself from screaming in frustration at the underhanded attack. He did his best to funnel the anger he felt away from Uru and Uruziel. They had both saved his life multiple times with their actions and their knowledge. It was unfair to expect them to see every danger and no one had the time to discuss all those possibilities anyway. Two highly unlikely events had occurred: Ruwen using a Spirit version of a spell meant for Ascendants to absorb Mana based attacks, and Ceplotryn attacking with a taboo method so rarely used Ruwen hadn\u2019t known about it. Ruwen lost his Soul abilities because of the damage he\u2019d caused placing a city there. Now Ceplotryn interfered with the functioning of his Core. Unfortunately for Ceplotryn Ruwen still retained his two most powerful abilities. Thanks for the information, Uruziel. Can you search Uru\u2019s memories for a way to speed up the healing process. I hate losing yet another ability. I already looked. Giving the Soul Energy time to escape is the safest. The only other known method is absorbing a tiny portion of the Destruction Realm into your Core and letting it destroy everything there. The issue is stopping it, and the god that tried it ended up being consumed completely. That sounds terribly unpleasant. So, time it is. Thanks to Ruwen\u2019s Mental strength, he could block some of the pain, but because the pain stemmed from his Spiritual side, he didn\u2019t know how to block it completely. Ruwen grimaced in pain, thankfully hidden behind the Ink Lord\u2019s Wrap, as he released Last Breath and returned to the fight. Ceplotryn had already released another attack, conjuring a storm of razor-sharp leaves that swirled around Ruwen like a deadly cyclone. The hostile environment of Ceplotryn\u2019s Realm created immense strain on Ruwen\u2019s Angel Fortified body. Supporting his Divine Domain, the personal gravity shell that kept him safe, had a physical component he\u2019d never noticed before. Ruwen released a burst of Mental Energy, creating a wave of psychic force that turned the leaves into dust. He immediately launched a Mental attack at Ceplotryn, aiming to disrupt the god\u2019s concentration. Instead of faltering, Ceplotryn slumped. Glowing green sap dripped from the god\u2019s eyes like tears. Had Ruwen killed the god yet again? Taking advantage of the situation, Ruwen Blinked to the god, using ten percent of his Mental Energy to push through the resistance Ceplotryn generated. In a fluid dance of precision and power, Ruwen struck Ceplotryn with a series of rapid Shadow Step strikes, each aimed at the god\u2019s spiritual nexus points. The Divine Realm\u2019s protection and the god\u2019s natural bark armor did nothing to hinder the real force behind the blows. Ruwen intended to numb the god\u2019s Meridians, not sever them, but even so, the odd structure of the god\u2019s tree like body made the blows ineffective. If Ruwen could master traveling into the Shadow Realm and back and learn how to interpret the true shadows that resided there, each of his strikes would have found the correct spiritual targets. Ceplotryn\u2019s mind recovered in time to experience the pain of Ruwen\u2019s strikes. The tree god roared as the attacks bypassed his physical form and targeted his Spirit network. The pressure from the Divine Realm flickered and wavered, and Ceplotryn\u2019s regeneration faltered. For the first time, Ceplotryn looked concerned. Ruwen moved to strike again, already calculating how he\u2019d adjust his blows to find the spiritual nexus points. He considered triggering his Show Your Respect spell from the Emperor tarot card, but he hated wasting the three second stun since he didn\u2019t really need it. Ceplotryn regained his composure, and an invisible wall of Divine Realm formed between them, and it pushed Ruwen back ten feet. Ceplotryn\u2019s eyes blazed with fury. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to do better than that!\u201d Ceplotryn roared and summoned a horde of spectral-fungal creatures from the moss. These wraith-like beings swarmed Ruwen and created a fog of poisonous spores. Their forms shifted and contorted as they moved. Ruwen met them head-on, using a combination of Viper and Bamboo Steps to kill or fend them off. He struck with precision, each blow dispersing a wraith back into the ether. Despite Ruwen\u2019s best efforts, he found the spore-specters overwhelming him. Ceplotryn\u2019s relentless assault had pushed Ruwen more than he\u2019d expected, the intense pain radiating from his Core not helping. Ruwen had learned enough from Ceplotryn in this first encounter, and he felt confident he\u2019d perform better in the next Divine Realm. It was time to switch his strategy from battling the god to learning how to neutralize a Divine Realm. Ruwen unleashed a powerful Mental blast that stunned the entire spectral horde, and they all floated slowly to the ground. Ceplotryn, however, was far from defeated. Two massive wings slowly unfolded, resembling beetle infected bark with mucus colored sap dripping from multiple cracks. Ceplotryn raised two large branches, and the ground trembled in response. The pressure from the Divine Realm doubled to lock Ruwen in place. Massive fissures opened, spewing torrents of corrosive sap that burned hotter than lava. \u201cNow you will see, Little Angel, my true power! You are nothing in my domain!\u201d Ruwen expended another twenty percent of his Mental Energy and narrowly avoided the deadly liquid. He glanced at his resource bar to find he only had thirty percent of his Mental energy left. With a thought, he moved three hundred feet away from Ceplotryn. \u201cImpressive,\u201d Ceplotryn mocked, \u201cbut running is futile.\u201d Ruwen had now witnessed the effectiveness of Divine regeneration when a deity sat within the safety of their own Realm, and it truly impressed him. Ceplotryn could regenerate from any physical or mental damage, and Ruwen\u2019s powers had dropped in effectiveness by fifty percent from the pressure exerted by the Divine Realm. But if Ruwen had learned anything, it was that every system had a flaw that could be exploited if one only looked hard enough. He was confident now the flaw here didn\u2019t reside with Ceplotryn. Ruwen shifted his attention to Ceplotryn\u2019s connection with his Divine Realm. He hoped he could damage it enough to stall this regeneration. If that didn\u2019t work, he might need to destroy the Realm completely so the god couldn\u2019t draw on its power to heal so quickly. Using Harmonic Sight, Ruwen studied the pulsing veins of power that ran through the ground and into the air. He guessed using his Harmonic faction spell Minor Prelude of Stillness, which stopped all vibrations in the area for three seconds, would likely collapse the Divine Realm immediately. Ruwen summoned Harmonic Hammer, a spell he\u2019d designed to disrupt the frequency of magical energies. Using Harmonic Sight, he channeled the spell not at Ceplotryn, but at the glowing tendrils of power that flowed outward from the god like roots. The Harmonic Hammer unleashed a deep, thrumming sound, a vibration that spread like ripples across a pond. The ground shuddered, and the veins of power flared brightly, straining against the spell\u2019s constant bombardment. The distant trees bent and groaned, the leaves shaking free and the lichen swaying as if in a storm. Ceplotryn staggered, his form shuddering as he struggled to maintain the connection to his Realm. Seizing the moment, Ruwen wielded Harmony like a bow, releasing thousands of tones in a spell he called Celestial Barrage. Harmonic Sight displayed the spell as a storm of comet-like projectiles that combined into chords and a few into larger harmonies that rained down upon Ceplotryn. The impacts against the god\u2019s body sounded like a hundred wind chimes colliding in a storm. The energy tore pieces from Ceplotryn\u2019s body, and the god struggled to reform as Harmonic Hammer continued to smash into the connection with his Realm. With a roar of rage and pain, Ceplotryn managed to counter, extending his influence to summon a powerful spell. The wind suddenly gusted before howling with the voices of ancient spirits as it sought to buffet and disorient Ruwen. Twigs and leaves became missiles in the gale, slashing across Ruwen\u2019s defenses. Ruwen ignored the wind and debris and focused his mind, summoning a spell he called Mental Sieve. He launched the psychic assault, aiming to shatter Ceplotryn\u2019s consciousness with a stream of disorienting images and false memories. The attack had been Rami\u2019s idea, and this would be the first time he used it. The mental attack found its mark, causing Ceplotryn to stumble and fall. The god\u2019s attack faltered and then disappeared. Ruwen easily maintained Harmonic Hammer, Celestial Barrage, and Mental Sieve\u2014something Rami believed no other deity could manage. He Blinked to Ceplotryn as he summoned Pen\u2019s sword. The very sword that Tarot had claimed could slice through any substance. Ruwen struck as soon as he appeared, the blade slicing down Ceplotryn\u2019s trunk and severing all the branches. Just as Tarot had said, the sword experienced no resistance against the god\u2019s thick bark armor. Ruwen brought the blade up the other side leaving the god without any branches. Ceplotryn\u2019s scream reverberated with agony and wrath. The entire Realm shook. Ruwen prepared to trigger Bookmark on his Ink Lord\u2019s Wrap to escape if the Realm collapsed or something unexpected occurred. Ruwen slid the sword deep into Ceplotryn\u2019s body and then dismissed Harmonic Hammer, Celestial Barrage, and Mental Sieve. Ceplotryn\u2019s branches regrew, but far slower than before, and his eyes contained malevolent fury. \u201cEnough!\u201d Ceplotryn thundered. \u201cYou will not best me in my own Realm!\u201d \u201cI already have, Ceplotryn,\u201d Ruwen said, his voice hard. \u201cAnd I\u2019m giving you a single chance to save your life.\u201d \n CHAPTER 38 Ruwen exited the griffin\u2019s wing, stepping back into Barbas\u2019s camp. With a quick swipe of his hand the gate runes to Ceplotryn\u2019s Realm disappeared. The alchemists remained stuck in hibernation from Ruwen\u2019s earlier Ripen spell. He recalled his Ink Lord\u2019s Wrap and it rolled itself up into a tiny scroll which he placed in a small hidden pocket next to his hip. He removed the Grandmaster Alchemist robe from the Apocalypse Hoop and put it on. Thankfully the holes caused by the battle had already mostly mended themselves. As Ruwen walked over to Rami he accessed the Architect Role moving to Creator and then Matter and finally Element. A lump of lead appeared in his hands, and he gasped in pain as the Spirit left his Core. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Rami asked looking up. \u201cYou look terrible.\u201d Ruwen rubbed his chest with a fist. \u201cYeah, you should see the other guy.\u201d \u201cThat took longer than I thought.\u201d Ruwen shaped the lead into a mask and placed it over his face, before pulling the hood of his robe forward. He sat on the table facing Rami and swung his legs as he spoke. \u201cThe fight was harder than I expected, and without Harmony and my Mental Power, I would\u2019ve lost within two minutes.\u201d \u201cHe was that tough?\u201d \u201cNot really. It\u2019s just he was a big tree, and I only know humanoid physiology. My Shadow Steps were mostly useless. Then I learned this neat trick the hard way.\u201d \u201cLet me guess, that\u2019s why your chest hurts.\u201d \u201cYeah, it turns out you can hide excessive Soul Energy inside Spirit spells. My new tree friend used that to try and worm into my Spirit network, but I helped by sucking it all in with Sunburn.\u201d \u201cOh no. It\u2019s in your Core?\u201d \u201cYep, and it feels like the Plague Siren all over again.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll look for a fix.\u201d \u201cThanks, Uruziel is doing the same. I should\u2019ve wondered why other deities I\u2019d fought never just immediately sucked up whatever spell I cast. Turns out they were likely doing some type of check.\u201d \u201cWhat happened to Ceplotryn? Is he dead?\u201d Ruwen shook his head. \u201cHe works for us now. I have him looking for paragon jewels.\u201d Rami leaned back. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the one that gave me the idea, actually. He initially thought I was a Diamond Fortified alchemist and wanted to press me into service. Isn\u2019t irony great.\u201d \u201cAnd he just agreed?\u201d \u201cNo, I thought I\u2019d need to kill him. As he tried to figure out a way to escape the situation it gave me time to study him up close and I figured out his Meridian configuration. Then I spent ten minutes adapting my Shadow Steps so I\u2019d be prepared if I ever met another tree that wanted to kill me.\u201d \u201cBut you were gone over an hour.\u201d Ruwen sighed. \u201cYeah, well, it turns out sap isn\u2019t like blood. It takes longer for tree people to recover from Shadow Step attacks. I\u2019d paralyzed his entire body, and he couldn\u2019t talk. I carried him around as I used my treasure finding spell.\u201d \u201cDid you find anything? A library?\u201d \u201cI like how you skipped over me carrying a god on my shoulders for forty-five minutes. He looked like the world\u2019s worst bo staff. And no. Turns out trees kind of hate books and scrolls. Makes sense if you think about it. He has vast gardens full of rare plants, though. I\u2019m going to take Bliz and the alchemists there later to grab some of it.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll probably just betray you.\u201d Ruwen shrugged. \u201cI know what he fears now, so I doubt it. After he recovered from the Shadow Step practice, I informed him that it\u2019s trivial for me to destroy a Meridian instead of stunning it. That if he breaks his word to me, I\u2019ll destroy his entire Spiritual network and leave him in his own country to live as a commoner. That terrified him.\u201d \u201cWhere did he get this?\u201d Rami asked pointing to the bowl of powdered paragon jewel. \u201cA rift appeared in his lands and one of his subjects received it as loot. Ceplotryn took it from them.\u201d \u201cSounds like the rifts are becoming more common.\u201d \u201cI know. Ceplotryn had figured out how to get to the System quests as well. We need to consider revealing the System to everyone. I feel like all the powerful are already figuring out how to get to the System quests and they\u2019re getting a head start.\u201d Rami stood. \u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d Ruwen glanced around at the alchemists. \u201cI\u2019ll finish up here and then head back.\u201d \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see you back at camp. Hopefully I\u2019ve found something to make you feel better by then.\u201d Ruwen slid off the table and hugged Rami before she transformed into her bookwyrm form and disappeared. Sitting on the stool, Ruwen smoothed out his robe and then dismissed the Ripen spell. Barbas stared into the night sky as did the rest of the alchemists. None of them realized almost two hours had passed. The Grandmaster looked uncomfortable. \u201cCeplotryn, I beseech you, come to the aid of your faithful servant,\u201d Barbas yelled again while pressing his summoning ring. Ruwen looked up into the sky with the rest of the alchemists. Ten uncomfortable seconds passed in silence. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s busy,\u201d Ruwen offered. Barbas glared at Ruwen before trying a third time. \u201cCeplotryn, I beseech you, come to the aid of your faithful servant.\u201d While everyone stared up into the sky, Ruwen placed the powdered paragon jewel into his Void Band along with the six bags of plants from the center of the table. \u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201d Barbas asked. \u201cI correctly identified the first two items. Then you cheated by presenting a third item for analysis that you had no part in harvesting or creating.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know\u2060\u2014\u201d Ruwen interrupted Barbas. \u201cAre you completely devoid of honor, Grandmaster? As above, so below. As within, so without.\u201d Barbas ground his teeth for five seconds before responding. \u201cGet out.\u201d Ruwen stood and gave the tiniest of nods to Grandmaster Barbas. \u201cI enjoyed our game. Perhaps we can do it again.\u201d Rage caused Barbas to tremble and Ruwen decided he\u2019d pushed things here far enough. Without another word, Ruwen turned and strode away. As Ruwen entered the buffer zone, he focused on Overlord. Can you do me a favor? Sure, what\u2019s up. Overlord projected himself into Ruwen\u2019s vision, appearing next to Ruwen in his red armor. Check out this guy\u2019s sub-Class and Specialization, Ruwen said and displayed it again for Overlord. Rotmancer and Blight Weaver, Overlord read. Those sound awesome. I know. Uru, bless her heart, could have used a little pizzazz in her Class names. Don\u2019t tell Uruziel I said that. Uruziel appeared next to Overlord. Too late, she said in mock anger. Ruwen smiled. The exchange with Uruziel released some of the tension he\u2019d felt after the injury to his Core. Things would be fine. Seriously though, Ruwen continued, with all the changes we implemented around Classes I think there are two areas we could still improve. These Class names reminded me, and I wanted to see if the two of you can help me. In fact, Uruziel can you tell me why we don\u2019t have Classes like this? We don\u2019t have anything of a darker nature. Blame it on Izac, Uruziel said. Uru\u2019s brother had a real mean streak and leaned into darker Classes, which caused Uru to do the opposite. The mention of Izac stirred a lot of memories for Ruwen. Many of them centered on Jagen, probably because Overlord had the red Overseer armor on. Ruwen had learned of the Overseer Class when trapped in the Spirit Realm with Jagen, the Champion of Uru\u2019s brother, Izac. Jagen had revealed his Classes were Knight and Overseer, which correlated to Uru\u2019s Fighter and Priest. The Overseer Class used blood\u2014their own and others\u2019\u2014to power magic. Despite the grim Class, Jagen loved to discuss armor, and Ruwen learned a lot from the man. Jagen wouldn\u2019t remember Ruwen though, because Lylan had used her Wyrm Coin request to have the man\u2019s memories of the Spirit Realm locked away. It was the only way to protect Jagen from Izac\u2019s wrath and give Jagan and Una a chance at love again in the future. Ruwen shook off the depressing situation and spoke to Uruziel. Jagen told me about Izac\u2019s reliance on blood magic, which makes me uncomfortable, but so do the fancy shirts Hamma buys me. Uruziel raised her eyebrows. Did you just compare blood magic to fashion? Instead of answering Uruziel immediately, Ruwen turned to Overlord. What\u2019s the most critical thing we\u2019ve learned? Balance, Overlord responded immediately. Exactly, Ruwen said as he turned to Uruziel. Our Class system lacks balance. Lir has already vastly improved the emergency help system, so I feel like we\u2019re in a good position to offer more dangerous Classes because we have the safety rails to protect others if an occasional psychopath pops up. I can\u2019t argue against balance after everything I\u2019ve seen, Uruziel said. Ruwen looked at Overlord. Cool names, though, okay. Overlord nodded. There are a lot of similarities between Izac\u2019s Class Structure and Uru\u2019s, Uruziel said. They\u2019re almost like reflections of each other. Ruwen\u2019s Cleverness Attribute triggered and a memory from his Ascendancy Day worked its way to the top of his thoughts. He\u2019d just discovered the hidden Root display that Uru\u2019s Champions received, which gave him access to a second Class. It had the shape of a large tree with six sections, one for each Class. Ruwen had studied that tree, excited that he could finally become a Mage, but he\u2019d also noticed what looked like symbols below the tree amongst the roots. They were faint, and he couldn\u2019t make them out or select them. Ruwen\u2019s Cleverness Attribute fired again as a new truth surfaced. Uru and Izac both possessed a balanced system. The same system in fact, and probably based on the Cultivation paths they grew up with. The remnants of the system still existed, barely visible in the roots of the tree. Uruziel had many of Uru\u2019s memories, but not all of them. I just realized that the structure and Classes already exist in the current displays. They\u2019re in the roots of the tree display the Champions use. We\u2019ll talk with Lir when we get back to Grave. I don\u2019t think this will be as hard as I thought to implement. But, we need\u2060\u2014 Cool names, Overlord interrupted. I got it. Uru\u2019s followers had never had access to Classes like Necromancers or Blood Mages or Witches, but they soon would. \n CHAPTER 39 Ky intercepted Ruwen before he reached the walls of his fortress camp, and the two of them now sat three hundred feet into the forest. Ruwen removed his robe opting for plain black shade gear just like Ky. The ominous darkness in the trees and oppressive silence contrasted with the noise of Ceplotryn\u2019s Realm. The absence of normal forest smells just added to the feeling that everything natural had been stripped from the forest. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about Shadow Realm misconceptions,\u201d Ky said. \u201cThe biggest is that you need a shadow for Shadow Stepping to work.\u201d Ruwen\u2019s eyes widened. Ky nodded. \u201cI know, it surprised me as well. To be clear, shadows make your entry and exit points far more controlled, but they aren\u2019t necessary. It\u2019s a secret we keep within the secret that is the Shadow Steps. It gives us an advantage against those familiar with our methods.\u201d Ruwen had already spent considerable time thinking about whether he should tell Ky about the Triumvirate Bridge that allowed him to transition into the other realms. \u201cI have this artifact that allows me to enter the Shadow Realm, but it takes a long time to transition.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard of such items. Have you tried it?\u201d \u201cOnce. I found the realm very confusing and a little unsettling.\u201d \u201cThose are two excellent descriptors,\u201d Ky responded. \u201cIf you have easy access, or the resource cost is low, we might use this artifact to aid your training. That brings me to the second misconception: the realms are balanced. They aren\u2019t, entering the Shadow Realm is easy, escaping is difficult.\u201d Ruwen thought back to the Spirit Realm. \u201cYeah, getting out is always the hard part.\u201d \u201cMost people will never notice, but if you have the training, you can sense the Shadow Realm tugging at you all the time. This sensation turns into a physical assault upon entering.\u201d \u201cI read some journals where they called it the Destruction Realm instead of Shadow.\u201d Ky considered for a moment, \u201cThat is a more appropriate name. From the moment you enter until the time you leave, the realm tries to consume you. It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t stray far from the realm boundary, as the destruction intensifies the deeper you travel.\u201d Ruwen nodded so Ky knew he understood. \u201cIt\u2019s the Shadow Realm\u2019s desire to consume that we harness to create the bridge for our Steps. By offering a flow of Soul Energy, you can connect yourself directly to the realm.\u201d \u201cAnd getting out?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cThe short of it is finding a natural bridge back into the Material Realm, which is a Shadow, and then forcing a stream of Soul Energy through it, allowing the Shadow Realm to yank it back. Think of yourself as stuck in a hole with a waterfall to your side. You throw your soul rope upward out of the hole and then back into the waterfall. Imagine the end of your soul rope is a bucket, and the waterfall yanks the rope down, which yanks you upward. The trick is to sever the connection when you reach the Material Realm, or you\u2019ll get dragged back into the Shadow Realm.\u201d \u201cWhat happens if you don\u2019t have Soul Energy?\u201d Ky narrowed her eyes. \u201cTell me.\u201d Ruwen sometimes forgot that for a Shade, innocent questions didn\u2019t exist. Combined with his terrible aptitude for lying, it meant he needed to answer truthfully. \u201cI damaged my soul, and I\u2019m still not regenerating.\u201d \u201cThat isn\u2019t good. Not only does it make getting in and out of the Shadow Realm impossible, but you won\u2019t be able to defend yourself against the creatures we encounter.\u201d \u201cDo you run into shadow creatures often?\u201d \u201cNo. In my entire time Shadow Stepping, it\u2019s only happened twice. That\u2019s because we always stay near the boundary, and most shadow creatures are kept away from the Material Realm by the wardens.\u201d Ruwen had met one of these wardens in the swamp during his Master\u2019s testing. \u201cHave you ever met one of these wardens?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cNot directly. The Founders are on good terms with one, and I attended a meeting long ago with them, but I didn\u2019t speak.\u201d \u201cThe seventh step is related to the Shadow Realm. The voice that summoned us in the cave sounded like a Prime Warden I met called Zylkin.\u201d Ky whistled. \u201cWell done, Sijun. I only need one hand to count the people that have made that connection.\u201d \u201cWell, our first meeting was memorable. He staked my shadow in place and interrogated me about my soul and the shadow I cast. We kind of got off on the wrong foot. I\u2019ve never looked at my shadow the same, and I should\u2019ve never told Sift, because he worries about it attacking him all the time.\u201d \u201cFor once, he\u2019s worried about something valid.\u201d \u201cWhat? Are you joking?\u201d \u201cWhat do you think your shadow is?\u201d Ky asked. \u201cIt\u2019s where light is blocked.\u201d \u201cThat isn\u2019t wrong, but it\u2019s superficial. It\u2019s better to think in terms of energy. The Shadow Realm is always hungry, always consuming, and your body blocks energy from reaching it, creating a hole into that realm. Kind of like a fracture.\u201d Ruwen had never considered shadows from that perspective. Once again, he couldn\u2019t help but feel that all he knew amounted to nothing in the grand scheme. Ky continued, \u201cIf I had to guess how the Muses had weakened the boundary here, I would go with using some type of energy absorber.\u201d That made Ruwen think of the Darkness, because it had consumed energy, stripping everything down to almost nothing. The Darkness acted like a giant shadow, effectively an entrance into what Pen called the Destruction Realm. \u201cNormally,\u201d Ky said, \u201cyou would piggyback with me into the Shadow Realm, and I would show you around. But you know my unique situation. Compared to other Shadow Steppers, I produce very little Soul Power. Couple that with the dangers here, and I want to conserve as much Soul Energy as possible. All that is to say, if you can use your artifact to get into the Shadow Realm, I would appreciate it.\u201d Ky\u2019s unique situation resulted from her status as an Ascendant, and most of her soul remained wrapped by Uru so revival would work. In fact, Ky had agreed to become Ruwen\u2019s mentor because of the favor she owed Uru, stemming from cracking that soul covering enough for Ky to become a Shadow Stepper. \u201cNo problem,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cThere\u2019s one more important topic I\u2019d like to discuss. You already know if an Ascendant dies outside of Uru\u2019s blessing, they lose everything since their last synch with the temple. The Shadow Realm is far more dangerous. Uru didn\u2019t give me the details, but she said if I die in the Shadow Realm, I can\u2019t be revived. Your state is a little more complicated, but I would appreciate some clarity, so I know how to react if you\u2019re in danger.\u201d \u201cFrom what you just explained, I know why death is permanent in the Shadow Realm.\u201d Ky leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered.\u201d \u201cThe deities wrap the souls of their followers so that when they die, the soul can be brought back to the temple. It takes a soul to revive a body into a person. But you just told me how the Shadow Realm consumes everything, including the soul, which explains why revival is impossible.\u201d Ky absorbed the information and nodded her understanding. \u201cThank you. Occasionally, you librarians are worth the trouble.\u201d Ruwen assumed Ky meant Tremine. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Ky asked. \u201cThe safest place for a deity is their Divine Realm. Some say they are effectively invincible there. I don\u2019t have a realm, so I\u2019m not sure if that means the Material Realm is safe for me or not. I haven\u2019t really taken enough damage to know if some Divine process would kick in. Regardless, dying in the Shadow Realm is permanent for me as well. Even if my soul somehow escaped, the backup at the temple came from just before I transitioned into an Angel. So much has changed since then, it\u2019s no longer me.\u201d \u201cThat means we both need to be ultra-careful. Permanent death is a great reason to stay near the boundary. The deeper sections are where the destruction is the strongest, and the creatures who can annihilate us\u2014well, me, with a thought\u2014live there.\u201d Ky and Ruwen stood. \u201cWithout Soul Power, you\u2019re defenseless, so be prepared to retreat immediately. Mana and Spirit are useless and, in fact, counterproductive. In my experience, they only make the creatures stronger.\u201d \u201cWhat about our Steps?\u201d Ky rewarded Ruwen with a rare smile. \u201cA superb question, Sijun. First, I want to state that if you are within striking distance, you have already failed at your primary objective, which is to avoid trouble.\u201d \u201cI try, but trouble sticks to me like glue.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s an understatement. To answer your question, I\u2019ll reveal another secret no one has an explanation for. Assuming the creature is humanoid or one that you\u2019ve studied and know the locations of their nexus points, our Steps can be effective depending on which Meridians you target.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a weird answer.\u201d \u201cNo kidding. Most of this information comes from Dusk. The Mind and Body Meridians are, let\u2019s call them, neutral. The Stone, Order, Water, Light, and Life Meridians take extra damage, so attempting a stun will most certainly shatter a Meridian of that type. On the flip side, Air, Chaos, Fire, Dark, and Death Meridians are incredibly strong and not worth attacking.\u201d Ruwen immediately sent that information to Rami, asking her to try and discover a reason for such an oddity. \u201cDoes anyone have a theory on why Meridians would be different?\u201d \u201cNo, and it doesn\u2019t matter because we should never be in a situation where we need to utilize Shadow Steps in a fight.\u201d Ruwen tried to look natural. Ky pinched the bridge of her nose and closed her eyes for two seconds. She opened them and locked gazes with Ruwen. \u201cYou\u2019re just like Tremine, and I already know you\u2019ll obsess about this difference in Meridians until you discover an answer. Assuming you survive, please let me know what you learn.\u201d Ruwen tried and failed at hiding a grin. Ky snapped her fingers. \u201cI have a great idea.\u201d In a fluid motion, Ky removed a metal flask from her dimensional belt, opened the top, and promptly poured it over Ruwen\u2019s head. \n CHAPTER 40 \u201cDon\u2019t let that get in your eyes,\u201d Ky said. Ruwen had already closed them when he recognized the smell, which had assaulted him as soon as the lid came off the flask. Ky had just poured Chip-and-Stump\u2019s brew over his head. \u201cMadda and Padda were super excited about this alcohol last night as it contains a significant amount of Soul Energy. They spent an hour discussing how the drakes managed to imbue so much energy into the alcohol, but they couldn\u2019t ask the drakes because everyone was already too drunk. Anyway, it gave me an idea: it might serve as a type of repellent in the Shadow Realm.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a repellent all right. What if it does the opposite and the Soul Energy attracts creatures?\u201d Ky bit her lip. \u201cI didn\u2019t consider that. If you get mobbed, I\u2019ll yank us both out. Madda and Padda will be thankful about the results, either way.\u201d She patted Ruwen on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s all for the good of alchemy, and we appreciate your sacrifice. As above, inside out\u2026 or whatever.\u201d \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you pouring it over your head then?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the control, of course,\u201d Ky said with a grin. Despite Ky\u2019s joking, Ruwen felt like bursting from curiosity. Just like the Addas, he also really wanted to know how the alcohol effected the creatures in the Shadow Realm. And truth be told, Ky was correct, good alchemy did need a control. Standing here in the forest with Ky, Ruwen wasn\u2019t a god but a Shadow Step Sijun learning from a Grandmaster. If anyone had to put up with burning skin, blinding fumes, and the taste of lava, it was the Sijun. Ruwen placed a palm over his fist and gave a short bow. \u201cThis Sijun will remember the Grandmaster\u2019s kindness in the future.\u201d Ky had taken five steps back and pinched her nose. \u201cYou smell great. Use your item and I\u2019ll follow you in.\u201d Ruwen had used the Triumvirate Bridge\u2019s Pair spell previously and mentally gave the \u201cunequip\u201d command. A thumb-sized sapphire rose from his right palm. The rectangular shape sparkled, even in the darkness. He flipped the gem over to reveal the six strings crossing the hollowed body. Ruwen refreshed his memory on the item\u2019s use. Name: Triumvirate Bridge Quality: Mythical Durability: Indestructible Effect (Passive): Anchored \u2013 rooted in the current realm and immune to forced transfers. Effect (Activated): Paired \u2013 equip, use, or unequip the triumvirate with a thought. Effect (Activated): Strum \u2013 upstroke moves from Material to Creation, downstroke from Material to Destruction. Restriction: Maintain resonance to persist in upper or lower Realms. Description: A two-inch rectangular sapphire containing a cavity crossed by six strings. The sound of the Triumvirate Bridge traverses the space between Creation\u2019s everywhere and Destruction\u2019s nowhere. From the center, all paths are equal. Ruwen equipped the Triumvirate Bridge again, and it sank out of sight. \u201cOne thing,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cThis item anchors me in whatever realm I\u2019m in, so you might not be able to pull me out in an emergency. It\u2019s unclear what \u2018Forced Transfer\u2019 means. Maybe I\u2019ll get a popup or something asking if I want to go. I guess what I\u2019m saying is in an emergency I\u2019ll probably need to unequip it first, which only takes a second.\u201d \u201cGood to know,\u201d Ky responded. Ruwen frowned. \u201cI need to warn you about a couple more things that I didn\u2019t remember until I recalled the details of this item. First, my soul seems to destroy the Shadow Realm locally, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s constant while in the Material Realm or only the instant I appear in the Shadow Realm.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s normal,\u201d Ky said. \u201cHardly anyone knows how to control their soul, and the energy strikes the Shadow Realm like a comet. The shadows fix themselves quickly though, and the Shadow Realm is always morphing and changing anyway, so it really doesn\u2019t matter. You will need to learn control though, because as Shadow Steppers we\u2019ve been granted something like temporary citizenship there, so we\u2019re expected to act civilized. Don\u2019t worry about it now though; they\u2019re tolerant of accidents and understand it takes a while to learn.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a relief. Although now I want to verify something. Can you take a quick peek in the Shadow Realm and see if my soul is affecting anything?\u201d Ruwen activated Harmonic Sight just in time to see a tendril of dense white energy leave Ky\u2019s chest and strike the shadows between them. Ky disappeared, and three heartbeats later a pool of white energy formed in the shadow just before Ky reappeared. \u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d Ky said. \u201cI know you said your soul isn\u2019t regenerating, but your soul is free from Ascendancy, so it should act like the other Cultivators. Even the Founders leave tracks through the Shadow Realm as their souls are dragged across the landscape. But with you, only your light shadow exists, the one you cast from the Material Realm, and even so, it\u2019s obscured. How are you doing that?\u201d \u201cThis is a long story, but the short version is I have this kind of armor that, unfortunately, my body absorbed. Lately, I can control when it appears, and when I went into the Shadow Realm, I summoned it, and for lack of a better term, it resonated with the Destruction Realm. I need to explore this as it appeared to shield me there, but it is unsettling to see, and I didn\u2019t want to surprise you with it.\u201d \u201cAh, is this the infamous Scarecrow?\u201d Of course, Ky would know about it. It\u2019s not like Ruwen had kept it a secret. \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing it for myself. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Ruwen gave the mental use command, and a tattoo version of the Triumvirate Bridge appeared on his right palm. He mentally strummed the strings in a downward motion. Just like before, the Triumvirate Bridge generated long frequencies. The timbre of the notes sounded as if they emerged from an instrument hundreds of times larger, and the tones contained a profound seriousness that reminded Ruwen of a warning. The resonance filled Ruwen\u2019s body, slowing him like a soaked blanket crushing him into stillness. Then, with no detectable shift or energy expenditure, Ruwen landed in the Destruction Realm. Just as before, Ruwen\u2019s Spirit remained tightly bound in his Core, and the pathways that looped through his Meridians looked like rivers of twisting tar. Floating in the dark liquid, spots of inky blackness drifted. He guessed they constituted the Soul Power he\u2019d accidentally absorbed into his Core. Each of those pieces acted as a razor when he accessed his Spirit. The entire spiritual network\u2014center, Core, pathways, and Meridians\u2014gave Ruwen\u2019s form structure, acting like a skeleton; small amounts of spirit leaked from his Core, clinging to the pathways and giving him the form of a misty shadow. On his previous foray, Ruwen\u2019s soul destroyed a mountain and radiated shockingly intense power. This time, however, his soul was barely detectable, and his worry increased. A black mist rose from his head and torso like smoke from a fire. That would be the soul alcohol. Ky\u2019s misty form stood in front of Ruwen, her soul leaking shadows from a small crack in her chest. Both their shadows stretched and twisted as if assailed from all sides, but Ruwen\u2019s emitted far more light. Ky\u2019s shadow looked like a grey smudge, while his resembled spilled mercury\u2014silver and cohesive. Shroud symbols, each representing a Bamboo Viper Step concept, floated like dark flecks on the surface of both shadows. Ruwen\u2019s, however, contained tens of thousands of tiny lights that orbited each other, and they created the bright glow of his shadow. Like the first time, the Destruction Realm emitted its own style of light, and he could see the alchemist camps less than a mile away. That brief focus created thousands of shadows like a living net between himself and the camps. He knew with only a thought these shadows would deliver him to the camps. \u201cWhoa,\u201d Ky said. \u201cWhat are you doing? Shadow Sliding is dangerous. If you slide away, I might not be able to keep up or find you. First you need to master normalizing the landscape.\u201d Embarrassed, Ruwen returned his focus to Ky, and the tendrils followed, coating Ky. \u201cThis realm responds to Will,\u201d Ky said. With a thought, Ruwen dismissed the tendrils and Ky reappeared. \u201cSorry.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. This is all new to you. Let\u2019s start with safety. If you\u2019re in and out like in a Step fight, then you don\u2019t need to bother much with your surroundings, unless, of course, the fight is a trap and they have agents in the Shadow Realm to ambush you.\u201d \u201cSo always take a moment to check.\u201d \u201cGood Sijun.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of others,\u201d Ruwen said, \u201cI\u2019d like to summon a couple things to see how they fare here.\u201d \u201cGo ahead.\u201d It\u2019s time, Ruwen said to Overlord. Are you ready? This will hurt until we get rid of the Soul Energy contaminating your Core. I know. Let\u2019s start with a minion, and then you\u2014if it doesn\u2019t immediately explode. Ruwen grimaced as a normal Minion appeared. In seconds, the Destruction Realm had done enough damage to notice. Try your fighting form, Ruwen said to Overlord. Overlord appeared in the black armor of his Fallen King form, and Ruwen bent over in pain. He sat up straight and studied Overlord. \u201cYou\u2019re doing better than the Minion,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cI can feel the damage despite the durability of this form. I\u2019d guess it would survive twenty minutes.\u201d \u201cCool. Tell the other two they can come out, and you guys can look around.\u201d Ruwen gritted his teeth as Uruziel and Sivart appeared. The three had the inky tar appearance of Spirit and no shadows. They bowed to Ruwen and Ky. Ky cleared her throat. \u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cI\u2019m terrible about intros.\u201d He pointed at each person in turn. \u201cThis is Overlord, Uruziel, and Sivart. They\u2019re\u2026\u201d Ruwen froze, not sure how to explain that. \u201cFriends,\u201d he finally said. \u201cUruziel?\u201d Ky asked. \u201cThat was Uru\u2019s original name.\u201d Uru had an even older name, Eiru, but Ruwen didn\u2019t want to argue over semantics. Uruziel gave a curtsy. \u201cWell met, Dungeon Mistress.\u201d Ky bowed to the three and then they disappeared, dashing into the forest. \u201cInteresting,\u201d Ky said. \u201cYou\u2019re full of surprises.\u201d Ky had no idea how deep the rabbit hole went when it came to surprises. Ky nodded at Ruwen\u2019s shadow. \u201cThat\u2019s the brightest shadow I\u2019ve ever seen, like by a factor of a hundred. You\u2019re a literal beacon.\u201d \u201cThe Scarecrow will hide it. Should I summon it?\u201d \u201cNo, let\u2019s get through some basics first before we add another variable.\u201d \n CHAPTER 41 \u201cSmart,\u201d Ruwen said. He brought their conversation back to Ky\u2019s original point. \u201cHow do I check if I\u2019m safe?\u201d \u201cThe best way is to normalize your surroundings.\u201d \u201cYou used that term earlier, but I don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d \u201cWhat do you see right now?\u201d Ruwen ignored the slight tugging on his body, Spirit, and Core\u2014like thousands of tiny hooks attaching themselves and jerking away portions of his energy. The Scarecrow Aspect could stop all that, but for now he tensed his body, locking his energy in place. Ruwen stood in a forest of weaving shadows cast by the trees. He saw through them to the camp and the bright shadows of the people there. The shadows here had substance, though, and he knew they\u2019d resist anyone moving through them. Above Ruwen, treetops flickered and arced across the sky, whipping about as they stretched and bent. A section of the forest slashed upward at a ninety-degree angle, and he could see Overlord and Uruziel running through it, oblivious that they ran straight upwards, to Ruwen\u2019s perspective anyway. \u201cThe perspectives shift and warp,\u201d Ruwen said to Ky. \u201cWith this type of geography, hiding an assassin for an ambush is trivial.\u201d \u201cExactly, that\u2019s what normalizing fixes. I told you earlier that this realm reacts to Willpower. You can exert your control over it, shaping it to your desire. Now it will resist you, but it\u2019s a critical skill to master. Watch.\u201d Harmonic Sight had lost some of its clarity in this realm. Discordant tones roiled the area, although it seemed this close to the Material Realm the disturbance was minimized. Ruwen could tell that he wouldn\u2019t need to travel very deep into the Destruction Realm before Harmonic Sight would turn useless. Hamonic Sight revealed a pulse of energy leaving Ky\u2019s head, and a circular area fifty feet in diameter changed. Instead of the gyrating forest and shifting ground, Ruwen stood in the steady-as-stone center of a clearing devoid of trees. Through Harmonic Sight, he watched Ky repeat her mental blast every five seconds or so. \u201cIt requires focus to maintain, and the larger the area, the harder that is. This is the limit of my ability. Dusk can double this size and keep it clear for nearly ten minutes. Your initial goal should be a five-foot circle. That amount of visibility will provide the time necessary to either retreat from the ambush or kill the assassins. With practice, you should manage a basic five-foot normalization in about a year.\u201d \u201cWhat do I do exactly?\u201d \u201cImagine what you want your surroundings to look like and then mentally project it outward. When you master normalization, we\u2019ll move to a more advanced version where I\u2019ll resist your Will with mine. It\u2019s important you train your mind to strengthen it. In the Shadow Realm, or the Destruction Realm as you call it, the natives all use Will as a component of their attacks. It\u2019s like their version of Spirit.\u201d The forest returned to normal as Ky withdrew her Will. Ruwen had never heard of Willpower used as a type of magic, and he got excited. He wondered how much of the mental work he\u2019d already done would translate into this new skill. It would be awesome to create a five-foot circle immediately and see Ky\u2019s reaction. \u201cOkay, here goes,\u201d Ruwen said. Ruwen didn\u2019t close his eyes. He didn\u2019t want to create that habit when the point of normalization was to reveal danger. In his mind, he visualized the same flat area that Ky had used. Remembering the mess he\u2019d caused himself inside the Rift when he\u2019d used all his Mental Energy and disintegrated the entire area, he gathered what he estimated amounted to less than half a percent of his max. Ruwen\u2019s Mental Energy bar didn\u2019t dip as he channeled the gathered tiny pool of power into his visualized clearing. A deep rending sound traveled from the ground and through Ruwen\u2019s body as the surface of the Destruction Realm warped. A tidal wave of Willpower exploded outward from his location, traveling at incredible speed it struck the forest, causing it to vanish. And it continued to disappear until the wave faded into the horizon, still leveling everything as it traveled. Ruwen stared in shock. \u201cDarkness take me,\u201d Ky whispered. Many people and creatures previously hidden by the shadow forest suddenly became visible, and they all turned to stare at Ruwen and his bright shadow. Glancing around, Ruwen counted thirty humanoid figures, probably all alchemists testing their latest creations. More concerning were the now-visible creatures that had inhabited the forest, and there were far more than he\u2019d realized. The next thing Ruwen noticed was the vast dark hole now visible in the distance. The ground sloped toward it, and a horde of shadow creatures emerged like a geyser of nightmares. They fought each other as they traveled at an inhuman pace toward the exposed individuals. The alchemists all disappeared immediately as they retreated back to the Material Realm. The shadow creatures the alchemists had been experimenting on turned to Ruwen and Ky. \u201cBreak my dagger, let\u2019s go,\u201d Ky said. \u201cUse your item.\u201d Ruwen mentally strummed upward on the Triumvirate Bridge, but it almost felt like his mental hand had trembled, making the sound discordant. How could a mental hand tremble? A new vibration filled his body, one he realized had appeared when his Willpower had uncovered the dark hole in the distance. The vibration turned from barely noticeable to violently shaking Ruwen in a few heartbeats. The approaching creatures moved too fast, and he wondered if they were Shadow Sliding. The first hundred would arrive in less than ten seconds. Behind that first wave, larger creatures appeared. Every single one running directly at Ruwen. \u201cStarfield!\u201d Ky yelled. Ruwen strummed upward again, but the vibration had increased, and he didn\u2019t even touch all the Triumvirate Bridge\u2019s strings. Ky\u2019s patience had reached its limit. She grabbed Ruwen and disappeared. Just as Ruwen had feared, his Scarecrow Aspect kept him anchored in the current realm; normally a safety measure, it worked against him here. Thinking of the Scarecrow Aspect released what felt like a coiled spring inside Ruwen. The vibrations stopped immediately as the Scarecrow Aspect materialized around his body, and it felt different. Before, it acted like normal armor, but right now he experienced the armor\u2019s desire and, inexplicably, its joy. Joy at the comforting pull of destruction\u2014the joy of returning home. Ruwen\u2019s bright shadow disappeared completely. Ky reappeared and screamed at the sudden sight of the Scarecrow Aspect. Ruwen prayed he survived so he could treasure her surprised squeal for the rest of his life. \u201cYou should have stayed out there,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot. I can\u2019t afford to lose a Sijun on the first day. Again.\u201d \u201cAgain? You lost someone before?\u201d Ky ignored the question. \u201cDon\u2019t trust trajectories here, as creatures can use their Willpower to alter their course. Just kill anything that gets within reach.\u201d They had five seconds before the first wave reached them. \u201cBy lost, do you mean, died?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cAnd don\u2019t use your Willpower,\u201d Ky responded. \u201cYou\u2019ve already uncovered the funnel. Another blast and we might fall inside, and then we\u2019re really\u2060\u2014\u201d The first wave reached them before Ky finished. No adversaries came from the direction of the alchemist camps, so they kept that to their backs. The creatures charging Ruwen paused as they neared, as if sensing something amiss. A Will he\u2019d never experienced surfaced from the armor, and he felt it growl in anticipation. The shadow creatures nearest him tried to step backward, but a wall of new arrivals made that impossible. These first creatures resembled wolves, but the shifting nature of their forms made for a lot of variety. Tails turned into swords, tongues into whips, horns into projectiles. Identify provided more details. Name: Wraith Hounds Realm: Destruction Type: Creature Race: Not Applicable Tower: Dark Rank: Not Applicable Estimated Power: Tier 1 Level 3 Class: Not Applicable Path: Not Applicable Faction: Dark, Death, Chaos Deity: Destruction Emperor Might: Low Durability: Low Support: Low Strengths: Speed, Pack Tactics Weaknesses: Harmonics, Soul Power, Concentrated Aura, Will, Light Disposition: Hostile Description: Wraith Hounds prowl the barrier between realms. Their weaknesses are mitigated by their large numbers which travel in packs. In the distance, much larger creatures lumbered toward them. Name: Dread Reaver Realm: Destruction Type: Creature Race: Not Applicable Tower: Dark Rank: Not Applicable Estimated Power: Tier 1 Level 4 Class: Not Applicable Path: Not Applicable Faction: Dark, Death, Chaos Deity: Destruction Emperor Might: Medium Durability: Medium Support: Low Strengths: Shadow Manipulation, Regeneration Weaknesses: Harmonics, Soul Power, Concentrated Aura, Speed, Light Disposition: Hostile Description: Dread Reavers are the front-line defenders of the barrier between realms. Their high regeneration makes them formidable foes. Ky moved with the beauty and grace of a Bamboo Viper Grandmaster, nothing even remotely a danger to her. To her point, though, they couldn\u2019t last forever. Something about Ruwen\u2019s Scarecrow Aspect had confused and maybe even scared the wolves near him. Without a path backward, they moved to Ky\u2019s side. \u201cNow that seems really unfair,\u201d Ky said as the side of her hand decapitated a wolf as it jumped at her. \u201cShade\u2019s first rule: fairness only matters to a judge.\u201d Ky groaned, which made Ruwen abnormally happy. Ruwen sparred with Sift every day, and his friend had the skills of a Grandmaster, but witnessing another Grandmaster not holding back in the thick of battle had a hypnotizing beauty. Eagerness poured from the Scarecrow Aspect. Ruwen, curious what this new behavior meant, released the resistance he\u2019d exerted on the armor. Leathery, demonic wings extended from Ruwen\u2019s back, causing the creatures on Ky\u2019s side to pause. The Scarecrow Armor seemed to growl, and he felt the deep, threatening sound. Taking advantage of the reprieve, Ky stepped back and studied Ruwen. Go ahead, Ruwen sent to the armor. You\u2019re obviously so excited you revealed yourself. Go at it. Ruwen sensed the Aspect call for a friend. A loud neighing filled the air. \n CHAPTER 42 Vex appeared beside Ruwen. Unlike the shadowy forms of the attacking horde, Vex looked solid, as if he had complete control over his body\u2019s form. He glanced at the steed\u2019s description. Name: Vex the Black Type: Winged Steed of the Apocalypse Armor Class: 1000 Damage: 250-750 Blunt damage Quality: Divine Effect (Passive): Realm Prancer \u2013 Travel on any medium in any Realm. Effect (Passive): Hunger Pains \u2013 Damage and effects doubled while mounted and Aspect of Famine visible. Effect (Triggered): Heaven\u2019s Blessing \u2013 Consecrate an area around the Steed. Strength, area, and duration dependent on the amount of Spirit used. Effect (Triggered): Divine Scale \u2013 Increase or decrease the order yield and profit for a given area. Effect and duration dependent on amount of Spirit used. Effect (Triggered): Free Rein \u2013 Teleport to any visible point. Effect (Triggered): Seventh Seal \u2013 Every six days banish an infernal creature to the Infernal Realm. Effect (Passive \u2013 Destruction Realm Only): Willful Steed \u2013 Steed of the Apocalypse gains 10% of its rider\u2019s Willpower. Effect (Triggered \u2013 Destruction Realm Only): Willful Stomp \u2013 Stomp the ground releasing shockwaves of Willpower that knock back and disorient enemies for 1 to 3 seconds. Restriction: Only Famine or those they designate may ride the Black Steed of the Apocalypse. Restriction: Infernal ground generates fifty damage per second (transferred to rider). Description: A black emaciated steed with damaged wings spanning thirty feet. Created from the remnants of a Gem level Air Elemental, the Divine transformation has healed its soul and increased its strength. The Black Steed of the Apocalypse is unique among Apocalypse Steeds in that it can, like plates rising and falling on a scale, increase the order yield and profit for an area limited only by Spirit. The Steed is bound to the Aspect of Famine, not the wearer. In the end, all must cross Famine\u2019s scales. Vex looked over at Ruwen and neighed, the sound almost friendly, and for the first time Ruwen rubbed the horse\u2019s neck. Summoning the steed had, curiously, unlocked two new abilities related to this Realm. \u201cI\u2019ll follow your lead,\u201d Ruwen said. Vex rose up on his hind legs, spread his wings, and pawed at the air. Wherever his hooves moved, they left black gashes in the fabric of the Realm. At the appearance of Vex, the shadow wolves in the front all turned and tried to flee. With another loud neigh, Vex galloped directly into the mass of Wraith Hounds in front of Ruwen. The steed smashed them with his hooves and used his teeth to tear at anything within reach. Once all the wolves had scattered, the Dread Reavers in the distance roared in anger. To Ruwen\u2019s shock, nine crows materialized and flew in a circle around him, causing a new buff to appear. Willful Murder \u2013 Increase Willpower Regeneration by 45%. The Scarecrow Aspect pulsed, and spectral scythes spun outward in every direction. As they struck the Wraith Hounds, the beasts whimpered, but the scythes continued through them and into the distance. Another buff appeared. Willful Reaping \u2013 Decrease enemies\u2019 Willpower by 45%. Vex had displayed two new abilities here, and Ruwen wondered if the Scarecrow Aspect had experienced something similar. He called up the Scarecrow Aspect\u2019s details to check and found it had. Each piece had a hidden effect that only triggered when in the Destruction Realm. Name: Scarecrow Aspect Hood of Guarding Physical AC: 1,000 Spiritual AC: 1,000 Effect (Active): Angelic Field Guardian: create clone at any location in current Realm. Spirit cost proportional to distance. Created with 25% of wearer\u2019s AC and Attributes. Effect (Passive): Heaven\u2019s Spirit Maze: Incoming Spirit or Essence is delayed 3 seconds allowing for additional Harvesting time. Up to 20% of buffered energy can be bled into the surroundings. Effect (Active - Destruction Realm Only): Willful Murder: Increase Willpower Regeneration by 5% per Fortification Tier. Description: A burlap hood with crudely stitched eyes. The Aspect provides Archangel-level protection against Spiritual attacks on the wearer\u2019s center Core Meridians and paths. Ruwen hadn\u2019t even known about the Willpower stat. He\u2019d ask Rami to find it in the System menus and make it visible when he returned. Name: Scarecrow Aspect Jacket of Sowing Physical AC: 1,000 Spiritual AC: 1,000 Effect (Active): Wrathful Crow Beater: staff created from wielder\u2019s essence ignores 90% of non-magical armor and 30% of magical armor. Max damage = (Connected Meridians) * (50). Effect (Triggered): Divine Murder: While holding the Wrathful Crow Beater, summon (12000) * (Connected Meridians) essence crows to shield the target of the spell for fifteen seconds. Effect (Passive): Worshipful Focus: grants level two meditation state and Wrathful Crow Beater can be summoned and dismissed and no longer needs to remain in touch with the summoner. Effect (Passive - Destruction Realm Only): Willful Reaping: Decrease enemies\u2019 Willpower by 5% per Fortification Tier. Area of effect proportional to total Willpower. Ruwen quickly scanned the pants information. Name: Scarecrow Aspect Pants of Reaping Physical AC: 1,000 Spiritual AC: 1,000 Effect (Active): Celestial Alarm: area of effect fear with an intensity and range proportional to Spirit used. Effect (Passive): Winged Embrace: obscures the fortification, aura, soul, and Spirit network. Effect (Passive \u2013 Destruction Realm Only): Willful Toll: Once per hour when Willpower drops below 10%, tendrils erupt from the armor, ensnaring enemies, draining their Willpower and transferring it to the wearer. Area of effect proportional to total Willpower. Ruwen checked the set bonus details. Set: Scarecrow Aspect Hood of Guarding, Scarecrow Aspect Jacket of Sowing, Scarecrow Aspect Pants of Reaping Set Bonus (Active): Holy Rapture: once per week, transport yourself to any location in the current Realm and sector using mental gate runes. Set Bonus (Passive \u2013 Destruction Realm Only): Willful Domain: unlock and enter the five spires. The armor\u2019s sense of belonging and the unlocked abilities led Ruwen to believe the Scarecrow Aspect, probably all the Aspects, were created utilizing creatures or materials from the Destruction Realm. It would explain why the Aspects bestowed so much power on their users compared to normal armor. Ruwen willed himself higher, and his wings gave a lazy beat. He climbed fifty feet. Every time the spectral scythes struck the Dread Reavers, they stumbled, and some of the Wraith Hounds had already collapsed. Ky removed a small quiver of bolts and drenched them in the soul alcohol. Then she used a crossbow to fire at the nearest Wraith Wolves. The alcohol-covered bolts caused severe damage to the wolves, and the few remaining desperately retreated. Ruwen estimated five hundred Wraith Wolves scattering away and five Dread Reavers stumbling toward them, the closest still three hundred feet away. Ruwen waved an arm across his body, and all the Wraith Wolves within two hundred feet disintegrated. He focused on the nearest Dread Reaver, now stopped three hundred feet away. The Dread Reavers stood ten feet tall with sinewy, shadow-infused muscles beneath a jagged, bone-like exoskeleton. Their ashen grey carapace had intricate, glowing runes that pulsed with malevolent energy. Their arms were longer than normal and ended in razor-sharp claws. Their red eyes generated a fear effect that Ruwen brushed off. Rows of jagged teeth twisted the shape of their mouths, and spiked black bones jutted from their backs and shoulders, enhancing their menacing appearance. Ruwen pointed at the nearest Dread Reaver and clenched his hand. Tar-like shadows exploded outward as the Dread Reaver\u2019s body condensed into a mass of muscle and bone the size of Ruwen\u2019s fist. Inky blood fell from the sky as Vex destroyed the flying creatures that tried to attack from above. Ruwen summoned the Wrathful Crow Beater. It took all his strength to not hunch over in pain as the small amount of Spirit required for the summoning turned his Core into a ball of fire. The soul fragments did extra damage to Ruwen in this form. He had intended to summon three Angelic Field Guardians so he could kill all the Dread Reavers at the same time, but he didn\u2019t want to endure the pain. Instead, Ruwen spun the staff in his right hand as he located the closest Dread Reaver. He activated Free Rein, teleporting himself directly in front of the creature. Ruwen swung the staff before the Dread Reaver could react, and the creature vaporized. The power from the swing continued in a wave, engulfing another Dread Reaver who disappeared in a wispy haze. The remaining two Dread Reavers turned and fled. Ruwen reached out and mentally grabbed each of the Dread Reavers, raised them thirty feet into the air, and smashed them together so violently nothing but a tarry liquid remained. No more creatures emerged from the black hole, which had decreased in size during the fight. Ruwen\u2019s Perception located a hidden entity and Identify described it. Name: Unknown Realm: Destruction Type: Citizen Race: Maelstromian Tower: Chaos Rank: Not Applicable Estimated Power: Tier 1 Level 4 Class: Bishop Path: Annihilation Scout Faction: Chaos, Death Deity: Destruction Emperor Might: Low Durability: Low Support: Low Strengths: Speed, Summoning, Light Resistance, Stealth Weaknesses: Harmonics, Soul Power, Concentrated Aura, Concentrated Light Disposition: Hostile Description: Annihilation Scouts are common along the barrier and are capable of crossing into the Material Realm for short durations. They are feared as the combination of stealth, summoning, and speed make them formidable in any fight. The Annihilation Scout stood ten feet tall, its thin form armored in shadowy leather that twisted and shifted with a life of its own. The Bishop had jagged, scorched bones and its eyes glowed with a strange orange fire. It held a bow in one skeletal hand and a black arrow in the other. The arrow\u2019s tip pulsed with dark energy. The Annihilation Scout detected Ruwen\u2019s gaze and immediately withdrew into the pit, and Ruwen considered teleporting there to follow. \u201cHey!\u201d Ky yelled. Ruwen reluctantly let the scout go and teleported to Ky\u2019s side instead. The Scarecrow Aspect resisted Ruwen\u2019s attempt to dismiss it until he mentally promised to return to the Destruction Realm soon. Vex, covered in thick black blood, landed next to Ruwen. Vex neighed, and Ruwen rubbed the steed\u2019s neck. \u201cGreat job, Vex.\u201d The horse neighed again and disappeared. Ruwen turned to Ky, who stared at him in obvious shock. \u201cWhat in all that\u2019s holy was that?\u201d Ky asked. \u201cVex? He\u2019s my Steed of the Apocalypse. I think our relationship had a breakthrough tonight.\u201d \u201cNo! Not your horse,\u201d Ky said in a frustrated voice. She turned and waved at the vast plain surrounding them, an area now completely devoid of life. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just as surprised as you,\u201d Ruwen replied. \u201cI think this Aspect originated here because it likes this place.\u201d \u201cIt likes this place, huh. Were you about to follow an unknown entity into the funnel?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Ruwen lied. \u201cProbably not. What\u2019s the funnel anyway?\u201d \u201cOh, no you don\u2019t. No distracting me. We\u2019re headed home, and I\u2019m having a cup of much-needed tea. You\u2019re going to recite every reason you can think of why following that scout into the depths of this realm is unbelievably stupid. Then you\u2019re going to explain how you opened the funnel to begin with. Then maybe we can chat about how you flattened everything from horizon to horizon. Or how you destroyed a few hundred shadow-born creatures with a wave of your hand. Darkness take me, how did I get here?\u201d Ruwen focused on the Triumvirate Bridge and strummed upward, initiating his return to the Material Realm. Ruwen paused a few seconds and then spoke, trying his best not to smile, and failing. \u201cSomeone once told me, \u2018You only have yourself to blame.\u2019\u201d The Triumvirate Bridge completed its resonance sequence, and Ruwen disappeared just before Ky\u2019s angry punch reached him. \n CHAPTER 43 Everyone gathered in the meeting room to eat breakfast, and as usual Findley produced food and smiles. Ruwen didn\u2019t know many chefs, but Findley was definitely the happiest one he\u2019d ever seen. Once again, the little gremlin looked miserable and exhausted, and twice dropped pies that Findley had made for Sift to satisfy the Blapy\u2019s favorite status. Sift\u2019s quick reflexes saved both pies, and Findley apologized for the mishap. Ruwen watched Sift rearrange the eight pies on the table in front of him for the twentieth time. \u201cWill you stop touching those pies,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cYou\u2019re making me uncomfortable.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not touching them. I\u2019m ordering them. It\u2019s very important to get the spectrum of taste just right.\u201d \u201cIt was nice of Findley to make so many for you.\u201d Sift scoffed. \u201cDon\u2019t let the pies fool you. He\u2019s only making them because he needs to. If he could\u2019ve thrown them all on the floor, he would\u2019ve happily done so.\u201d Ruwen let it go. Sift had a lot of odd behaviors, and it wasn\u2019t worth digging into this one. When everyone finished eating, Ruwen turned to Madda and Padda. \u201cWill Chip and Stump\u2019s alcohol be useful?\u201d \u201cNot for the primary quest,\u201d Madda said. \u201cBut for three of the five secondary quests, there\u2019s a clear benefit.\u201d Padda continued. \u201cThe alcohol will work well for removing shadow contamination, providing shadow protection, and according to Ky\u2019s report from last night, we can confirm it causes damage. We will, of course, need a way to minimize or negate the organ damage it causes.\u201d Ruwen and Ky didn\u2019t look at each other, but he knew Ky\u2019s testing had been cut extremely short because of his power explosion. Madda spoke again. \u201cI have a nonlinear idea for the shadow camouflage and a possible way to use the alcohol to control shadow entities, but I need to do more experiments.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s great, thank you,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cBefore we discuss which quest to focus on, I wanted to get everyone\u2019s thoughts on the whole situation.\u201d After two seconds of silence, Gunder responded. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense\u2014the primary and secondary quests, I mean. There is a dissonance surrounding them.\u201d Ruwen immediately understood Gunder\u2019s point. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Ruwen responded. \u201cThe primary quest is of little value to anyone in the Material Realm, while the secondary quests only hold value if entering the Shadow Realm.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that since I saw the quests,\u201d Tremine said. \u201cThe noble Bard is perfectly in tune, and it points to a more complicated situation here than I\u2019d expected.\u201d Hamma cleared her throat. \u201cI have it on good authority that the three Muses missing at our arrival have, in fact, not been here the entire time. No one has seen or heard from them in the past six months.\u201d Ruwen nodded his thanks to Hamma. He knew she wasn\u2019t comfortable with Archie\u2019s spying, but relayed the information because she believed it would help. \u201cOur intelligence indicates that the missing Muses are what initiated the creation of these alchemy quests in the first place,\u201d Ky added. \u201cThat seems a bit foreboding,\u201d Findley said. \u201cI agree,\u201d Ruwen replied. \u201cI propose we start with the three secondary quests\u2014the ones that benefit from Chip\u2019s and Stump\u2019s alcohol. Before we do that, though, let\u2019s brainstorm ideas for the immunity potion so that we can collect any necessary resources ahead of time.\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you,\u201d Bliz said, \u201cI\u2019d like to take Wip and Qip with me to do the structure durability checks.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d Ruwen responded. Chip, Stump, Xavier, and Big D stood to leave as well. As they left, Ruwen leaned over to Hamma. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to stay either if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d Hamma patted Ruwen\u2019s knee. \u201cThanks, but I think I\u2019ll stay. Lylan is so excited about the alchemy she\u2019s learning that it\u2019s sparked my interest.\u201d Tremine, Gunder, Ky, Lylan, Rami, and Sift also remained. Padda sat up straight in his chair. \u201cWe should approach this from the ground up. First, what ingredients can resist or block Soul magic?\u201d \u201cBlightworm is resistant to sunlight,\u201d Madda said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not aware of it ever being tested with soul magic specifically.\u201d \u201cForgive my intrusion,\u201d Tremine said as he adjusted his robe, \u201cbut I\u2019ve used dragon fungus to dampen unwelcome energy surges in my experiments.\u201d \u201cEnergy surge is code for explosion,\u201d Ky offered, giving Tremine a wry smile. \u201cThere\u2019s an ancient limerick that references phantom moss and its repulsion properties,\u201d Gunder said. \u201cAlthough in the limerick it failed its intended purpose.\u201d Lylan gasped. \u201cAre you talking about the Countess of Phantom Castle?\u201d \u201cOh no,\u201d Hamma whispered. Then, in a private Chat, she continued to Ruwen. \u201cThat\u2019s a really spicy one. Don\u2019t let her go on too long. She\u2019ll die of embarrassment once she remembers Sift\u2019s parents are here.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with the Countess,\u201d Gunder responded. \u201cHave I met her?\u201d Lylan leaned forward, placing her elbows on the table. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a book. But the evil alchemist gave the Countess phantom moss to prevent a pregnancy, but it didn\u2019t work, and she didn\u2019t know who the father was because she had gotten a little too close to her five bodyguards, if you know what I mean. The lecherous alchemist offered\u2060\u2014\u201d Hamma kicked Ruwen under the table, and Ruwen interrupted Lylan. \u201cExcellent suggestion, Lylan. We\u2019ll add it to the list.\u201d Lylan\u2019s eyes cleared as she returned from her vivid recollection. Her cheeks reddened, and she pressed her lips together. \u201cThat is strikingly similar to the limerick,\u201d Gunder said with interest. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about this book later. I\u2019m interested in who the author is.\u201d Lylan nodded but didn\u2019t speak. Getting them back on track, Ruwen quickly added, \u201cLunar nectar amplifies magical properties and is a common base in many legendary resistance potions. So even if something is only slightly effective, we might make it work.\u201d Rami had finished indexing all the information she and Archie had stolen and added, \u201cOver ninety percent of the other alchemist\u2019s recipes use lunar nectar or a derivative as their base. None have reached an effectiveness over ten percent against Soul Power.\u201d That didn\u2019t surprise Ruwen. The challenge with Soul Energy was its density, and no resistance recipes existed, let alone immunity ones. Ruwen sensed Tremine\u2019s desire to speak, but the man was too polite to interject his thoughts again so soon. The reserved and dignified nature of the man Ruwen spent so many years with hadn\u2019t changed. Ky noticed as well. \u201cOut with it, Trem. Few people have survived as many high energy explosions as you, so your experience is valuable.\u201d Tremine smiled at Ky. \u201cJust so. There are three methods one can use to rid yourself of unwelcome energy. You can face the power head-on using a resistance potion as a shield. One can also deflect the magic, diverting it somewhere else. Finally, with the proper preparation and materials, one can simply absorb the energy.\u201d Diverting the energy was an excellent idea. When Ruwen had scooped up the exploding Crossing Ring explosion, he\u2019d effectively done that. Although that had just made the explosion someone else\u2019s problem, it hadn\u2019t really gotten rid of it. \u201cHow would we divert it?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cWith dimensional warping or some type of micro-portal?\u201d \u201cNormally, yes,\u201d Tremine responded. \u201cNeither will work in the Shadow Realm, however. Dimensional constructs are already unstable, and the constant bombardment of damage in that realm would collapse them within moments.\u201d Sift reached down to his hip and removed Io, placing the dagger on the table. \u201cYou told me a story last night about that pirate queen called the Ghost Pirate. She absorbed a thunderstorm to save her ship and ripped the life from her enemies\u2019 bodies. How\u2019d she do that?\u201d Sift listened to Io\u2019s response for ten seconds, and his eyes went wide. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d Ruwen got excited and leaned forward. Maybe Io and all his crazy stories would come in handy for once. Sift leaned back and shook his head in wonder. \u201cWhat?\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cTell us.\u201d Sift turned his wonder-filled eyes to Ruwen. \u201cThat place holds a secret. It\u2019s huge. Game-changing.\u201d Hope swelled in Ruwen. \u201cSpill it.\u201d Sift jumped to his feet. \u201cSix! I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d \u201cSift!\u201d Ruwen said, probably a little too loudly. \u201cTell us.\u201d Sift returned to his seat. \u201cBefore Grave, Io spent time on another planet. He told me about a powerful and clever Sifter there, and get this, Io says that Sifter is more powerful than me and even figured out a way to use Sifting as a weapon.\u201d \u201cAs opposed to using it as an excuse to get naked,\u201d Lylan added. Sift turned to Lylan. \u201cYou know they\u2019ll see my clothes. Invisibility only works if\u2060\u2014\u201d Ruwen interrupted. \u201cUru help me, Sift, stay focused. What\u2019s the secret?\u201d Sift returned his attention to Ruwen. \u201cOh, that. Right. Everyone in this room is sworn to secrecy. Okay, so they heat sugar and blow air across it. The sugar turns into webs that you collect on a stick. It literally melts in your mouth, and they have six colors. Isn\u2019t that the most incredible thing you\u2019ve ever heard?\u201d Ruwen stared at Sift. \u201cThat\u2019s the secret. Hot sugar.\u201d Sift snapped his fingers. \u201cHot sugar. That\u2019s going on the short list for guild names.\u201d Ruwen pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes. Trying to keep his voice neutral, he asked the obvious question. \u201cHow in all that\u2019s holy does cooking sugar relate to a pirate that absorbs storms?\u201d \u201cOh, that. Io mentioned they use tattoos to do it.\u201d Ruwen opened his eyes, still confused. \u201cHow does that work? Wait, this is too difficult. Let me try something.\u201d Focusing on Io, Ruwen added him to the group Chat. Hey everyone! Io said. Ruwen sighed in relief. Hopefully talking to Io directly would make things clearer. \u201cWelcome, Io. Can you tell us more about how the Ghost Pirate absorbs energy? If it\u2019s related to dimensional manipulation, it won\u2019t work for the quest.\u201d The Ghost Pirate! Io said. So many stories. No one in all the isles holds more ink than the dreaded pirate. Even there, only a handful know the secret identity of the Ghost. A fierce warrior who stood up to the powerful Purple Kingdom and helped free all the Kingdoms from the Purple\u2019s domination. \u201cI love these stories,\u201d Sift added excitedly. \u201cEach Kingdom is filled with people of the same eye color, and it matches their tattoos!\u201d Ruwen used all his self-control to remain patient. \u201cCan you explain the Ghost Pirate\u2019s magic?\u201d I can show you if you want, Io said. One should see Weavers to really appreciate the skill involved. \n CHAPTER 44 \u201cWhat?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cReally? Does Chat do that?\u201d It can, Io said. If you want. Ruwen turned and whispered to Hamma, who had spent a lot more time customizing things. \u201cDid you know that?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d \u201cYes, please show us,\u201d Ruwen told Io. \u201cStart with the hot sugar!\u201d Sift yelled. Before Ruwen could argue, the upper right quarter of his vision turned into a clear window, and people appeared. He could only assume they were seeing Io\u2019s memory. Ruwen shot a quick question to Rami. Did you know Chat did this? It doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m trying to figure out what Io did. A yellow-eyed young woman smiled and cupped her hands as a green-eyed woman laughed and placed a scoop of purple sugar into the cupped hands. The yellow triangle tattoo matched the yellow-eyed woman\u2019s eyes perfectly. The tattoo wavered and then shifted in shape. The point of the triangle pushed downward, creating two peaks. As that happened, the yellow-eyed woman\u2019s hands heated. The green-eyed friend placed one hand under the cupped hands while holding a stick with the other. The green-eyed woman had a tattoo of three wavy lines on her wrist, its color also matching her eyes. The tattoo wavered as if seen through a heat mirage, and air shot up from the woman\u2019s hand. It passed through the cupped hands of the yellow fire weaver and the hot sugar there. A few purple strands floated upward, waving back and forth from the wind below. The air weaver quickly grabbed the threads with the stick as more and more of the strands appeared. In moments, she had a fluffy purple ball. The weavers there call it cloud candy, Io said. Here\u2019s the other thing you wanted to see. A dark-skinned woman strode to the front of a sleek ship. Her black braids, filled with colorful beads, fell across her shoulders. The masts were bare, the sails stowed away from the dangerous wind that whipped like flying blades around them. The sea foamed as the violent air created choppy waves. Behind the ship, twenty large vessels approached. Their sails billowed with a powerful wind that green-eyed weavers generated, although none of them had remotely as much coloration on their skin as the woman. A purple flag flew from the mast. The woman\u2019s back was exposed, and as she spread her arms, a blue color emerged. In the center of her back, as if someone had dropped a rock, ripples formed in the color, slowly moving outward across her body. The visible sea turned as smooth as glass and trapped the trailing vessels in place. Dead Calm, Io whispered. The wind weavers in the approaching vessels had roiled the clouds, and the storm above the Ghost Pirate crackled with lightning and thunder. The blue ripples on the woman\u2019s skin changed, transitioning into a dozen whirlpools all in synch. She raised her arms and looked into the sky. Then, with a sudden snap, she brought her arms down. Fifty massive ropes made of rainwater fell from the sky and touched the woman. Lightning flowed through the columns of water and struck the woman. The wood decking smoked and turned black under her bare feet. Old char marks scarred the deck from her previous weaves of this powerful magic. Instead of instantly dying, the blue whirlpools absorbed the lightning, causing the vortexes to spin faster. Heaven\u2019s Wrath, Io said softly, the words almost reverent. The blue color on the Ghost Pirate\u2019s skin vibrated, causing the woman\u2019s form to blur. A moment later, it finished absorbing the energy, and the blue returned even more vivid. The Ghost Pirate turned, revealing a beautiful face covered in the same blue color as her eyes. \u201cThe Purples thought their wind weavers would get them close enough to touch me,\u201d the Ghost Pirate said. \u201cAnd their Blue Kingdom weavers should know better than to face me in the open ocean.\u201d The perspective changed, and a serious eight-year-old boy came into view. Unlike the Ghost Pirate, who wore very little, the boy wore pants and a long-sleeved shirt. The boy\u2019s features clearly marked him as the woman\u2019s son. The boy remained silent and met his mother\u2019s gaze with solemn eyes. The Ghost Pirate pressed her lips together. \u201cThey must be taught a lesson, Keel. It\u2019s the way of the sea.\u201d The boy responded, his voice soft but heavy with emotion. \u201cThe sea does not require their lives.\u201d Anger, or maybe frustration, flashed in the woman\u2019s eyes, and she opened her mouth to respond. She hesitated instead of speaking, and after a heartbeat, closed her mouth and looked down. Five heartbeats later, she faced her son again and gave a small nod. This time, her voice matched her son\u2019s somber tone. \u201cThe sea does not require their lives.\u201d The Ghost Pirate sighed and continued. \u201cWe must deliver a message though, or they will never stop.\u201d Keel gave a small nod in acknowledgement. \u201cPay attention now. This is a weave I\u2019ve never shown you.\u201d Keel\u2019s shoulders slumped as if his mom had scolded him, but he kept his focus on her. \u201cThis weave is paired with a song. It\u2019s old magic that few can control. The weave is called Riptide.\u201d The Ghost Pirate shut her eyes and took five cleansing breaths. She opened her eyes and stretched her arms out toward the vessels still trapped in the smooth water of Dead Calm. The blue color drained from the Ghost Pirate\u2019s face. It all gathered near her elbows, where a wave formed, the representation so realistic moonlight streaked the water as it rushed across her skin. The waves built until they became tidal waves inside her arms. When they struck a sandy beach at her wrists, they crashed forward into her hands. The wave retreated backward, pulling at the beach that had stopped it. The pace increased until as one wave crashed, another had already left her elbow. Then the Ghost Pirate sang. Oceans rise to lunar cries. Tides pull near then fade and sigh. Moon above, sea below Bound in love they cannot know. Moonlight spills on whispering waves, A dance of shadows, the darkness braves. The silver path laid across the sea, A bridge of light forever free. Oh, moon aloft, so parched and yearning Drawing night\u2019s veil, softly turning, Seeking the sea\u2019s deep embrace, Yet doomed to chase, never to face. Oceans rise to lunar cries. Tides pull near then fade and sigh. Moon above, sea below Bound in love they cannot know. Screams of horror filled the silence, and the view shifted back to the vessels flying the purple flag. A black mist filled the air above each ship. The men and women cried desperately as they pushed on their arms and wrists as if trying to stop a bleeding wound. As the waves retreated from the Ghost Pirate\u2019s palms, the black mist moved toward her, the source now clearly visible. With every retreating wave of the Ghost Pirate\u2019s weave, the colored tattoos of her pursuers seeped a black ink, traveling to the singing pirate. Many jumped off the ships, trying to swim out of range of the Ghost Pirate\u2019s terrible punishment, but it was useless. By the tenth time through her song, no one on the pursuing vessels had any colored ink left on their body. A black fog hung between the Ghost Pirate\u2019s ship and the purple-flagged vessels. The men and women still screamed, all of them sobbing. The Ghost Pirate brought her exhausted and trembling hands together, and the black mist collected into a ball. She opened her hands, palms downward, and lowered them slowly. The black ink descended until the ocean claimed it. The only sound that remained was the wailing of her pursuers. The Ghost Pirate sat cross-legged in front of her son. She clenched her hand, and their boat shot forward, the sea pushing them along. In moments, the sounds of grief had faded. \u201cDid you learn it?\u201d Keel pulled his sleeve back, and an identical wave to his mother\u2019s appeared and crashed into his palm. He pulled his shirt back down, and no more waves appeared. \u201cAnd the song?\u201d Keel nodded gravely. \u201cGood. Your weave is perfect as usual. Did you learn anything else?\u201d Keel looked questioningly at his mother but didn\u2019t speak. \u201cWe both know where your desire for life originates.\u201d Keel\u2019s eyes gleamed with emotion, and he dropped his head. The Ghost Pirate gently raised Keel\u2019s head until their gazes met. \u201cYour zealous belief blinded you today, my love. Otherwise, you would see that death is not the worst thing that can occur. For some, it is a blessing. Losing their ink\u2060\u2014\u201d The new display in Ruwen\u2019s vision disappeared. Wow, am I tired, Io said. No one responded. Finally, Gunder spoke as he wiped at his eyes. \u201cHer voice will haunt me the rest of my days. It was painfully beautiful. Thank you, Io, for sharing that with us.\u201d Ruwen didn\u2019t know how to respond. He had so many questions, they all crashed into each other. With his ever-growing understanding of the magic in their universe and how it all connected, he analyzed what he\u2019d witnessed. The weavers there had the incredible ability to shape their tattoos. More importantly, that correlated with the shapes and gestures of Primal magic that Lylan had accessed. The tattoos were on their bodies, and he wondered if they powered them with blood abilities, like Lylan, or Chakras. The Ghost Pirate had a superb voice, and her song had been beautiful, even though it produced tragic consequences for her enemies, but it hadn\u2019t struck him the same way it had Gunder, and if the sniffling was any indication, he guessed Hamma had experienced something deeper as well. Sift, as usual, broke the spell. \u201cYou\u2019ve been holding out on me.\u201d No, Io responded. I can\u2019t do that very often. It\u2019s too taxing. \u201cWell, as soon as you recover, you\u2019re showing me the ear walking head.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Hamma and Lylan said at the same time. \u201cNo!\u201d Ruwen said, probably a little too loudly. \u201cHe can explain that later. Or Archie can, he was there too.\u201d Sift and Io had the dumbest conversations imaginable. During Ruwen\u2019s Fortification to Angel in Blapy\u2019s Divine Realm Sift had finished his transition into Jade first. He\u2019d unfortunately witnessed Ruwen\u2019s headless body as it finished reforming. This had evidently sparked a series of stories from Io about heads that used their ears to walk around. Ruwen wondered how many newly Fortified gods rose from their transition to be greeted with such a discussion. Ruwen tried to refocus the conversation. \u201cTremine suggested absorption as a method for dealing with excess energy, and Sift mentioned Io\u2019s story, which we just witnessed. Thank you, by the way, Io. That was amazing.\u201d No problem, Io responded in Chat. I\u2019ll stream the ear\u2060\u2014 Ruwen interrupted. \u201cNope, please leave me out of that. I\u2019ve learned the hard way that some things you can\u2019t unsee.\u201d \u201cI appreciate the context,\u201d Padda said, \u201cbut the most relevant portion for us was where the Ghost Pirate absorbed the lightning. I\u2019m assuming the color in their skin was a type of ink.\u201d Yep, Io responded. Madda leaned forward. \u201cExcellent job, Io. Is that ink hard to make? What are its components?\u201d Not sure, Io said. \u201cDo you remember the gate runes for that planet?\u201d Ruwen asked. It just so happens I do, Io replied cheerfully. \u201cGreat,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cThis is just what we were looking for.\u201d Ruwen sent a private Chat to Rami. We need to talk about Io. Io placed the gate runes in Ruwen\u2019s Chat. It seemed Io knew a lot of things no one else did. \n CHAPTER 45 With the gate runes Io had given them, Ruwen stepped onto a new world. The old, weathered stone he exited from sat among oak trees. Through the trees, he could barely make out buildings in one direction. Satisfied, Ruwen returned through the doorway to fetch his friends, and five seconds later, he once again entered the oak grove. Hamma, Lylan, Sift, and Bliz followed. Sift carried Io, who had come along to help them find the ink. Rami hid behind Ruwen\u2019s left ear, as usual. \u201cAre you sure we need to steal it?\u201d Hamma asked. We could try ripping it from people\u2019s bodies like the Ghost Pirate, Io offered in Chat. \u201cMaybe we could bargain for it,\u201d Sift offered. \u201cI\u2019m sure Ruwen has something they\u2019d want.\u201d That\u2019s not a bad idea, actually, Io responded. Give me a second. I\u2019m going to see if I can find an old friend. \u201cAre these lizards freaking anyone else out?\u201d Lylan asked. \u201cThey\u2019re all staring at us.\u201d Ruwen glanced upward to find hundreds, maybe thousands, of various colored winged lizards. A few had reached the size of his hand, but the vast majority only stretched a finger length from nose to tail. Are these your people? Ruwen asked Rami. Hardly. They barely own two brain cells to rub together. \u201cDo those things bite?\u201d Sift asked uncomfortably. \u201cI hate things hiding in trees. Remember that Ugflat that almost killed me.\u201d \u201cUgflat?\u201d Lylan asked. \u201cUgly flying cat,\u201d Hamma answered. \u201cI had to ask too.\u201d \u201cIt was a Leopard Bat, and quit saying you almost died,\u201d Ruwen added. Bliz finished examining the yellow-dotted purple flowers surrounding the stone and stood. \u201cI got attacked by a leopard bat once. Nasty things. Never let them pee on you unless you know a level five Scrubber. You\u2019ll never get the smell out otherwise.\u201d He studied the lizards. \u201cThey do appear to be watching us. Interesting.\u201d Ruwen made his way in the direction of the visible buildings. He studied how Bliz shifted his attention from the ground to the bushes, to the trees, to the sky. That was why Ruwen had wanted him to come, not only for his vast knowledge and experience, but so Ruwen could keep learning from Bliz\u2019s skills. \u201cThose look like cosmic lilies,\u201d Ruwen said to Bliz. \u201cI thought so as well,\u201d Bliz responded. \u201cWhat makes those interesting is they\u2019re growing in shade.\u201d Ruwen studied Bliz\u2019s technique for harvesting a few of the plants. They kept to the shadows as they reached the edge of the grove. The Purple Kingdom sprawled before them. Much as Io had described it. A tall spire in the distance grabbed Ruwen\u2019s attention, and as he focused on it, he caught sight of the swarms of flying lizards circling the spire. Their numbers blocked some of the sunlight and cast shadows against the tower. Ruwen\u2019s Identify triggered. Name: Vachi Level: 1 Deity: Thelt the Magnificent Strength: Clonal, Numbers Weakness: Intelligence, Sugar Description: Small flying lizards attracted to magic and sweet flavors. Considered vermin by most. Do we have the Divine Realm gate runes for Thelt the Magnificent? Ruwen asked Rami. No, he\u2019s not on my list of deities. He sure thinks a lot of himself, though. That\u2019s quite a title. Ruwen wouldn\u2019t admit this out loud because he didn\u2019t want to encourage Sift, but he was concerned about tens of thousands of flying lizards swarming above them, especially if they had teeth. To gauge how safe they were, Ruwen checked their Disposition and found it green. Since they weren\u2019t hostile, he used his Divine sight to choose a single vachi from the distant swarm and created a telepathic connection with it. With the connection established, Ruwen closed his eyes as hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of different viewpoints\u2014along with very basic emotional states such as hungry, tired, and excited\u2014flooded his mind. Ruwen shifted the sensory input to a small section of his mind to keep it from overwhelming his consciousness. Identify had stated the vachi had a clonal relationship, and the sensory input confirmed it, as the vast majority didn\u2019t display cities but forest and mountains and grassland. Curious, Ruwen shifted his view into Harmonic Sight but had to immediately turn it off as the entire sky turned into a smear of connections as each vachi communicated with every other vachi. Io spoke in Chat. Things have changed considerably since I left, and I need a minute to figure out the situation. Don\u2019t steal anything yet. \u201cThere sure are a lot of them,\u201d Hamma said, scanning the swirling black clouds of vachi. Sift looked around in confusion. \u201cDoes anyone else hear whispering?\u201d Lylan studied Sift, her face concerned. \u201cThat\u2019s it, no more arguing.\u201d She turned to Hamma. \u201cScan his brain. He keeps hearing things.\u201d Sift pressed his lips together but knew better than to argue when Lylan used that tone. Hamma stepped over and placed her hands on Sift\u2019s temples. I can\u2019t believe our luck, Io said. It turns out my old friend has become pretty important. He\u2019s headed here now. \u201cThat\u2019s great, Io,\u201d Ruwen responded. \u201cWhat\u2019s your friend\u2019s name?\u201d He goes by Thelt the Magnificent now. \u201cWait,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cYou mean the deity of all these vachi?\u201d I don\u2019t know about that, but he did refer to himself as the king. The swirling black clouds of flying lizards parted, and sunlight illuminated the towering spire for the first time. It absorbed the sunlight like obsidian, and Ruwen wondered what it contained. Ruwen\u2019s Divine sight picked out a single vachi in the cleared area. He wondered if something was wrong with it because it didn\u2019t circle the spire like its thousands of brethren. The other lizards had clearly parted for something, and this little dimwitted lizard had failed to get the message, which was ironic since they were clonal. He\u2019s almost here, Io said. Ruwen scanned the sky not using Harmonic Sight because of all the active connections between the vachi. He searched with just his Divine senses, looking for the deity that approached. Take me out, Io said. Hamma still had her hands on Sift\u2019s head, but he reached for the hidden sheath on his hip and removed Io. Once again, Ruwen scanned the vicinity, searching for the approaching god or king as Io referenced him, finding nothing. The only creature near them was the same clueless vachi he\u2019d noticed before, now much closer. He could see the lizard was smaller than normal. \u201cIo, can you describe what Thelt the Magnificent looks like? I don\u2019t want to get off on the wrong foot.\u201d Look for yourself, he\u2019s almost here. Ruwen activated Harmonic Sight and couldn\u2019t help but focus on the small flying lizard nearly upon them. The small vachi shone like the midday sun from the millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, of connections he carried. These connections, however, had far more density than the previous vachi Ruwen had studied. Pi-O, Thelt yelled. Ruwen heard the voice in his head. Rami, how is he forcing a telepathic link with all of us? Unsure. I\u2019m looking. \u201cPi-O?\u201d Sift asked. I was a pie cutter for a bit, Io said. That\u2019s how I met Thelt. Sift held Io out across his palms. A moment later, the tiny vachi landed on Io\u2019s hilt. Thelt gave Io a hug with his tiny arms. The vachi was the smallest of any Ruwen had observed, maybe even a little smaller than Rami. He was mostly black with some dark green skin visible here and there. Are you back? Thelt asked Io. The royal bakery could use a slicer of your mentalness. I would love to, but I can\u2019t right now. My friends are solving a big problem, and I\u2019m helping. I\u2019ll tell you the story when I come back to visit. Royal bakery? You should come see it. I have my own pots now, and nobody tries to swat me anymore. That\u2019s fantastic, Io responded. Not that those cooks could swat you. Not with your mentalness. You look too clean, Thelt said. Are you sure you\u2019re okay? Actually, we came to get your help. Your mentalness might save us. Such a wise slicer. You were always my favorite, Pi-O. Can any of your friends match my mentalness? Maybe one of them, but you should probably test them. Good idea, Pi-O. Thelt leaped off Sift\u2019s hands and hovered in front of the group. Rami crawled out from behind Ruwen\u2019s ear, and Thelt immediately focused on her. You look smart, Thelt said to Rami. Is this the mentalness one, Pi-O? Then in a whisper that everyone still clearly heard in their minds, Thelt added, Does she have a boyfriend? I am smart, and I have a boyfriend, although we haven\u2019t really quantified it as such. You know what? That is a great question, and I\u2019m going to find out as soon as we return. Glad I could help, Thelt said. It sounds complicated. Thelt looked around at them. Listen up, Pi-O-rends. It\u2019s time to put on your thinking scales and take my test of mentalness. If any of you are a match for me, I\u2019ll help. Ruwen relaxed. When it came to tests and \u201cmentalness,\u201d as Thelt put it, he could easily match wits with this vachi and gain the help they needed. This is a two-part test, Thelt said. Here\u2019s the easy part: Name the most powerful food along with five reasons why. \u201cWhat?\u201d Ruwen asked, completely taken off guard by the odd question. Thelt pointed one of his small fingers at Ruwen but spoke to Io. He\u2019s a bit slow. Ruwen glanced at his friends. Hamma, Lylan, and Bliz looked as confused as he felt. Most powerful food? Who thinks like that? Identify had provided a clue that vachi liked sugar and sweet things, and maybe Thelt\u2019s nickname for Io meant he liked pie, but Ruwen had about one percent faith in that logic and certainly couldn\u2019t think of five reasons to support it. \u201cVery interesting,\u201d Sift said while tapping Io against his chin. He squinted at Thelt as if trying to see tiny details. \u201cYou\u2019re sticky like molasses and smell like powdered sugar, so I\u2019m going to narrow my choice to baked goods. Unfortunately for you, I own the original Soaring Sage bakery franchise.\u201d Thelt darted toward Sift. You own a bakery? \u201cA whole franchise.\u201d Thelt hovered in front of Sift. So you\u2019re the one. Io said one of you had great mentalness. I suspected you when I smelt the vanilla on your hands. Proceed. What kind of contest had they entered where Sift was their hope of winning? \u201cI bet you pegged me for a donut or pastry guy,\u201d Sift said, \u201cand you wouldn\u2019t be wrong. But we are talking about power here, and that means a different view.\u201d What do you like about donuts? Thelt asked. \u201cThey\u2019re sweet and quick.\u201d Very wise. Sift continued. \u201cI bet most people tell you cake, but that\u2019s only because they\u2019ve misjudged you. While cakes are commonly used in celebrations, they can\u2019t match the comforting, homey appeal of that which truly wields power.\u201d This is so exciting I could pee, Thelt said. \u201cSome masters might tell you pastries because they\u2019re fun and varied, but they require careful handling and steady conditions to remain nice, and that throws them right out.\u201d Ahhh! Stop stalling. What\u2019s your answer? \u201cOnly one sweet can be eaten for any meal, makes you feel warm and comfortable inside when taken from the oven, and holds up to abuse well.\u201d What! Thelt yelled. \u201cPie. Pie is powerful.\u201d Ruwen was pretty sure the little vachi did pee then as it zoomed in circles in front of the group. Suddenly Thelt stopped. Anyone could have guessed pie. Now you must tell me why? Hey, that rhymed. Sift didn\u2019t hesitate and held up a finger for each reason. \u201cOne, pies are functional. You can use them at any meal or occasion. They range from meals like chicken pot pie to a sweet dessert like apple pie. Two, nothing beats pies for hitting all the senses. Flaky golden crust, the light snap of it breaking, the smell of it baking, the surprise of its filling\u2014sometimes creamy, sometimes crunchy, sweet, tangy, savory, or rich.\u201d Thelt flew toward Sift and stopped three feet from his face. \u201cPies are important for cultural and emotional reasons. They are a common item at celebrations and family gatherings, allowing people to reconnect to their family.\u201d Four, tell me four! Thelt yelled. \u201cThe combinations of crusts and fillings never end. From classic fruit fillings to inventive creations like coffee-cream or bourbon-pecan. There is a pie for every taste.\u201d And five? Thelt asked quietly. \u201cThe seasons, of course. Pumpkin and apple around harvest time and berries, cherries, and peaches in the summer.\u201d You have the mentalness, Thelt said. A genius. \u201cI know.\u201d Okay, smarty-tail, here\u2019s the second question. Place these pies in order and tell me why: apple, blueberry, and cherry. Ruwen thought his head might explode. What kind of question was that? It was so subjective it made the question impossible to answer. \u201cBlueberry is first, obviously,\u201d Sift said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most powerful because each bite makes you feel like a king. The flavor is deep and full.\u201d Sift narrowed his eyes and pointed Io at Thelt. \u201cApple is a trick choice. It\u2019s in the second spot if a red apple with a balanced sweet and tart flavor is used, but if green apples are chosen, it drops to fourth. Green apples are too tart and make the whole pie sharp as a sword. Third would be the cherry. Cherries have a nicer tart than green apples and still have a rich and bold flavor. They make you feel brave.\u201d No one spoke as Sift finished. Ruwen wondered how blueberries could make you feel like a king and cherries brave. What an odd way to look at food. Pie is powerful, Thelt whispered. Sift nodded. \u201cPie is powerful.\u201d \n CHAPTER 46 Sift placed the pinky-sized vial of ink on the center table in the alchemy lab and slumped into a chair. Madda took a seat next to Sift and leaned toward him. \u201cWhy do you look so depressed?\u201d Sift waved weakly at the vial. \u201cThanks to me, we have this\u2014I believe the word Ruwen used was \u2018critical\u2019\u2014ingredient. After a hard-fought contest of intellects against the smartest lizard in the universe, victory was mine, and now the spoils are yours.\u201d \u201cThen why the long face?\u201d Padda asked. \u201cYou did the Chapter a great service obtaining this.\u201d Sift looked mournfully at the vial. Madda looked up at Lylan, who mostly hid her smile. Lylan patted Sift on the shoulder and spoke to Madda. \u201cSift passed Thelt the Magnificent\u2019s test, but it turned out the ink wasn\u2019t free, and Thelt is a tough negotiator.\u201d \u201cAll of them,\u201d Sift said softly. \u201cEvery single one.\u201d Padda frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d Hamma covered her mouth with a hand and avoided Lylan\u2019s gaze so they wouldn\u2019t break out laughing at Sift\u2019s melodramatic response to paying for the ink. \u201cHe lost his pies,\u201d Ruwen explained. \u201cAll of them,\u201d Sift whispered in disbelief. \u201cThelt the Pie Thief.\u201d \u201cThe good news is that Sift got us the ink,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cWithout him, we wouldn\u2019t have passed the test or had the currency necessary to bargain with.\u201d \u201cBargain?\u201d Sift asked. \u201cWe didn\u2019t bargain. That awful little lizard found out how many pies I had and then demanded them all. Who does that? He didn\u2019t even leave me one.\u201d \u201cThe recipe?\u201d Padda asked hopefully. \u201cNo luck there,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cThat\u2019s some big secret. This stuff is valuable, so I\u2019m thinking we set some aside for Miranda to try and replicate. I don\u2019t have those kinds of skills yet.\u201d Ky left the mobile alchemy lab where she\u2019d been listening and sat at the table. \u201cTen pies seems like a bargain.\u201d Sift pointed at Ruwen. \u201cMaybe ten of his Spirit pies, but Thelt the Magnificent Thief didn\u2019t want those. He said they had a zing to them like a lemon rind that he didn\u2019t like. Lemon rind. What a joke. He just wanted to see my suffering. And after I proved my mentalness and everything.\u201d That Thelt could tell the difference between something made naturally and an item created by the Architect Role put the lizard in rare company. The difference, whatever it was, proved important and explained why high-level alchemy recipes only used natural resources, not created ones. \u201cFindley will make you more pies,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cNot until tomorrow. What am I supposed to eat today?\u201d \u201cNormal people eat food, not dessert for their meals,\u201d Ruwen told him. \u201cDesserts are food.\u201d Ruwen turned his attention from Sift to Madda and Padda. \u201cHow are the subquests going?\u201d \u201cExcellent,\u201d Madda said, \u201cbut I\u2019m missing hoffer grain and crystallized sulfur flakes.\u201d Ruwen turned around to look at Bliz, who\u2019d remained quiet and still as if he\u2019d walked into a temple. Rami had left to find Xavier as soon as they\u2019d returned. \u201cI know where to find both,\u201d Bliz said with a small bow to Madda. \u201cThank you, Bliz,\u201d Madda said. \u201cPadda and I were talking about you earlier. Your gathering and herbalism skills are superb, which demonstrates your attention to detail, and Sift tells us you are someone who is always there for his friends.\u201d \u201cThe Grandmaster has already okayed this,\u201d Padda said with a nod at Ruwen. \u201cObviously Chip and Stump have as well. Sift begins his apprenticeship tomorrow in a very rare subtype of alchemy called Infusion Brewing. The Drakes are both Masters in this skill. It\u2019s how they create such potent alcohol, although that\u2019s just a tiny fraction of the possibilities.\u201d \u201cYou are welcome to take this apprenticeship as well,\u201d Madda said, \u201cunder the auspices of our alchemical Black Pyramid Chapter.\u201d Bliz\u2019s eyes widened, and he seemed too shocked to respond. Ruwen bought the Crew Chief some time to process the offer by providing more detail. \u201cChip and Stump seem to cause a lot of trouble in the Black Pyramid,\u201d Ruwen said, \u201cand they\u2019ve already shown interest in spending more time in the Shattered Sun. That means you won\u2019t have to travel far for training. The Drakes use a lot of Soul Power now, but they said Mana works just as well. From what I understand, Infusion Brewing allows you to create Superior and above potions, including Mana, Energy, and Health.\u201d Bliz swallowed hard twice before bowing low. \u201cThank you for this opportunity. I\u2019m overjoyed and can\u2019t wait to start.\u201d \u201cGreat,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cI\u2019m going to tag along with Bliz as he gathers the grain and flakes. Observing him is helping with my Prospecting and Taxonomy skills.\u201d \u201cHow should we handle the ink?\u201d Madda asked. \u201cRun it through the standard analysis,\u201d Ruwen responded, \u201cbut only the natural substance steps. I\u2019m positive this ink is organic, and I have a suspicion about its source.\u201d Madda and Padda nodded. Ruwen turned to Hamma. \u201cThat testing will take a couple of days. Are we still on for weapon practice when I get back?\u201d \u201cYou know it,\u201d Hamma said, twirling an imaginary staff. \u201cDid either of you commit to a second Class yet?\u201d Ruwen asked, looking between Hamma and Lylan. Both of them shook their heads. \u201cGood, because when I head back to Grave with Bliz to grab those items, I\u2019m going to speak with Lir about the possibility of additional Class choices.\u201d Ruwen knew Hamma wouldn\u2019t care about the new choices, but from what Lylan had said, and what she hadn\u2019t said, he thought she might appreciate them. \u201cWhat do we hate, Ruwen?\u201d Lylan asked. Ruwen tried to hide a smile. \u201cAnnouncements about an announcement. Sorry, I just don\u2019t want to get anyone\u2019s hopes up, but I also want to recognize all the work Overlord, Uruziel, and Sivart did in preparation.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re making it worse,\u201d Hamma said. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll shut up, but if it works out, you won\u2019t believe\u2060\u2014\u201d Hamma hit Ruwen\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNow you\u2019re just doing it on purpose.\u201d Ruwen grinned. Ruwen had created a Shed in the middle of camp that he used as his portal stone. He and Bliz exited the building to find the sun had sunk much lower in the sky. It had taken them longer than Ruwen had anticipated. \u201cRemember,\u201d Ruwen said, \u201cif the Addas ask, everything went fine.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll say a prayer to Uru they don\u2019t ask for details?\u201d \u201cTechnically everything did go fine. No one died in that village, and I relocated it out of the lava flow. The new spot is better anyway. Plus, with all the new volcanic activity, they\u2019ll get rich from crystallized sulfur flakes. Honestly, we did way more good than harm.\u201d \u201cI guess that\u2019s true,\u201d Bliz said, \u201cbut what about the hill giants? You turned that whole tribe into fanatics.\u201d Ruwen tapped his chin in thought. \u201cWell, you could think about it this way: the nearby cities had immense walls to defend themselves from the hill giants. We just freed up all the resources consumed by those defenses. Plus, those fields of hoffer grain are much safer to reach now.\u201d \u201cEventually the giants will stop looking for that fake hammer, and they\u2019ll be upset.\u201d \u201cWho says it\u2019s fake?\u201d Ruwen said, raising his eyebrows. \u201cYou didn\u2019t make all that up? That hammer is real?\u201d Rami, please remind me that I need a legendary hammer that does extra damage to mountain trolls. Why in the Darkness do you need something like that? Oh, and it needs to be big. Like swung by a hill giant big. What did you do? Nothing. I just made getting to this field of hoffer grain safe without killing anything. I bet that is a massive oversimplification. Let me look. Rami quickly went through Ruwen\u2019s memories. Poor Bliz, Rami said. He\u2019s going to stop taking you along. No, I think he secretly likes all the excitement. Plus, I\u2019m just trying to make things easier. \u201cRuwen?\u201d Bliz asked. Ruwen refocused on Bliz. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThe hammer? Is it real?\u201d \u201cOh yeah. As good as real anyway. The point we should focus on is how much safer everyone is.\u201d Bliz didn\u2019t look convinced. Ruwen patted the Crew Chief on the shoulder. \u201cHow about this: if anyone asks how it went, say \u2018opinions vary\u2019 and they should talk to me.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d Bliz took five steps toward the large alchemy laboratory and suddenly stopped. He turned and looked at Ruwen, a huge grin on his face. \u201cThat was fun though. Proper fun.\u201d Ruwen returned the grin, and Bliz marched off. I told you, Ruwen said to Rami. You are both wrong in the head. Speaking of wrong in the head, I wonder where Sift is? Probably in the alchemy lab. Nope, your map has him outside the barracks with Lylan and Hamma. Thanks. Ruwen marched toward the barracks, excited about the news he had. He turned around the dining hall to find Sift and Lylan playing catch with Io. Ruwen could think of a thousand safer things to toss around, but they both had insanely high Agility, so it probably didn\u2019t matter. Hamma sat with her back against the barracks, eyes closed in meditation. She\u2019d started meditating a lot more since the entanglement femites zipped through her body. \u201cPrepare for an announcement,\u201d Ruwen announced. Lylan growled, Sift laughed, and Hamma smiled. Without looking, Lylan flicked Io at Ruwen. Ruwen snatched it from the air before it struck his throat, and he hurled it at Sift. \u201cLir just activated all the new Classes. Now, if someone wants to be a necromancer or a witch, they\u2060\u2014\u201d A loud thunk caused Ruwen to glance at Lylan. She stood silently, staring at Ruwen with wide eyes. Io stuck out of the middle of her chest, and blood soaked her shirt. \u201cWhat?\u201d Lylan asked. \u201cDid you say Witch?\u201d Sift ran at Lylan in obvious concern. He reached her and quickly yanked out Io. Instead of comforting Lylan, though, Sift spoke to Io. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Sift asked wiping the blade on the grass to remove Lylan\u2019s blood. \u201cI know those hydras are mean to you.\u201d Ruwen strode over to Lylan and channeled Scrub. Keeping his hand a few inches over her chest, he removed all the blood from her shirt. He even used Mend on the hole. The wound on her chest had long since healed. \u201cWitch?\u201d Lylan asked again. \u201cYeah,\u201d Ruwen responded. \u201cCheck the area under the Class tree.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a Witch,\u201d Lylan whispered. Both Ruwen and Sift opened their mouths to agree, but Hamma cleared her throat and shook her head. Evidently, this had some type of significance to Lylan that Ruwen and Sift didn\u2019t comprehend, and Hamma didn\u2019t want them to joke about it. Wisely, they both kept silent. Afterall, Shade\u2019s first rule: Never argue with the healer. \n CHAPTER 47 The days passed and everyone fell into a routine. Ruwen quickly determined the best method to use the ink they\u2019d gotten from Thelt the Magnificent \u201cat great cost,\u201d as Sift always reminded them, but he kept his theories to himself. Ruwen did this for three reasons. After seeing the progress of the other Grandmaster Alchemists after six months here, he didn\u2019t feel as much pressure to immediately produce items for the quests. Second, he had assembled a dream team for his progress in many of the areas he lacked and wanted to take full advantage of that. Third, he decided to do everything in his power to get Madda and Padda to Grandmaster. The Addas previously told Ruwen that typical Grandmasters gave very little help to their Master Alchemists, instead using them as slave labor to implement the Grandmaster\u2019s ideas. Many Grandmasters tended toward jealousy and fiercely guarded their perceived reputations. Ruwen didn\u2019t care about any of that. He spent every morning with the Addas going over their work from the previous day and giving them the bare minimum to guide their thoughts in what he considered the correct path. He also let them try routes he knew would fail if he thought the discussion about why would benefit them. This gave the two Master Alchemists the best possible opportunity to trigger a skill advancement. Ruwen also took Pen\u2019s sword and stuck it in the middle of the table like a flagpole. The sword held so much luck it couldn\u2019t help but alter events around it, even when he left the laboratory. The Addas knew all these things, and their appreciation for Ruwen showed with every interaction. On Ruwen\u2019s third day at camp, Madda\u2019s skill level triggered again, tying her with Padda at nine hundred ninety-six. It took the Addas half an hour to recover from their celebration. Ruwen considered this terrible oppression the Grandmasters wielded over their hardworking Master Alchemists. Miranda, while absent most of the time\u2014for good reason\u2014wasn\u2019t like the other Grandmasters. Yet even in such a great situation, a skill up caused immense happiness. How much more joyful would Master Alchemists be who didn\u2019t have the benefit of an environment like the Black Pyramid? Ruwen wondered if he could change that while sowing some chaos among the alchemists\u2019 camps. Remembering how starved Barbas\u2019 alchemists were for knowledge, Ruwen, after working with the Addas in the morning, spent another hour lecturing on whatever topic he thought might prove the most useful to the Master Alchemists. Ruwen didn\u2019t just give this knowledge to the Addas, however, but to all the alchemists in the area. He\u2019d hoped to use Sphere of Influence from Rami\u2019s third Codex to telepathically link to all the Master Alchemists, but they needed to be within sight, and that complicated things too much. So instead, he just projected his voice over the other camps. Ruwen stated throughout every lesson that he, as an eight-star Grandmaster Alchemist from the Black Pyramid Chapter, considered himself the mentor of anyone listening to his voice. Just as Ruwen had hoped, when his talks produced a skill up for the Master Alchemists, he received the prompt to advance the level or not. The Addas had told him many Grandmasters suppressed these level-ups or demanded money or resources to approve a skill up. Ruwen did none of that. He gleefully and immediately okayed every skill advance he received. And he received a lot. In the first week, a massive disturbance occurred in Barbas\u2019 camp at the end of Ruwen\u2019s lecture on mushroom splicing. He already knew the cause because he\u2019d just clicked \u201cYes\u201d to level a Master Alchemist to skill level one thousand. Ruwen gathered up the Addas, Ky, Lylan, and Sift, who all attended his lectures daily, and swept them into the sky to observe the outcome. Screams of joy from the world\u2019s newest Grandmaster Alchemist gathered a large crowd. Thirty seconds later, a portal opened, and a griffin emerged. It stamped its feet and knelt near the crying alchemist. The alchemist calmed himself and turned toward Ruwen\u2019s camp. He dropped to his knees and bowed, placing his hands and arms on the ground. Ruwen\u2019s Divine hearing picked up the man\u2019s words. \u201cEternal thanks, Grandmaster Starfield of the Black Pyramid. I, Grandmaster Liu, owe you a debt I can never repay. My sect, the Violet West, will aid you no matter the request. You have honored yourself and alchemy with the generosity of your knowledge. As above\u2060\u2014\u201d Ruwen interrupted Liu\u2019s whispered thanks by using Sphere of Influence to speak telepathically with the new Grandmaster. \u201cSo below.\u201d Alchemist Liu pressed himself closer to the ground, his emotion-heavy words hard to make out. \u201cAs within\u2060\u2014\u201d \u201cSo without,\u201d Ruwen finished. \u201cCongratulations, Grandmaster Liu.\u201d Liu trembled and pushed himself to his feet. He stared at Ruwen\u2019s camp with tear-strewn cheeks before bowing once again and then climbing onto the waiting griffin. The creature disappeared through the still-open portal, taking the new Grandmaster Alchemist to his Chapter for final testing. Ruwen studied the thousands of Master Alchemists that intently watched the closing portal. They all wore a common expression\u2014hope. He\u2019d underestimated the impact of his idea for sowing chaos among the Grandmasters. After the new Grandmaster appeared, the other Grandmasters panicked, forbidding their alchemists from listening to Ruwen. No one obeyed. The Grandmasters tried to drown Ruwen out with noise or keep their Master Alchemists so busy they couldn\u2019t concentrate on his words. Xavier came up with an idea to counter the other Grandmasters by having Rami compress Ruwen\u2019s daily lectures and, with a quick circuit over the camps, place them in all the Master Alchemists\u2019 memories. That way, they could access them whenever they wished. After a week, hundreds of skill advancements had occurred along with another two new Grandmasters. The existing Grandmasters banded together for the first time since arriving and went to the Muses to complain about Ruwen interfering with their Masters. Ruwen Blinked to the fortress and strolled into the courtyard among the group of griping Grandmasters. \u201cMy invitation must have gotten lost,\u201d Ruwen said, smiling behind his lead mask. \u201cWhat are we complaining about today?\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d Diantheon said. \u201cIt appears you are destroying the minds of their Master Alchemists.\u201d \u201cDestroying their minds? Tens of thousands of Master Alchemists? By myself?\u201d Ruwen bowed to the crowd of Grandmasters. \u201cI\u2019m humbled you hold my talents in such high regard.\u201d \u201cYour talents are garbage,\u201d Barbas said with venom. \u201cObviously,\u201d Ruwen responded. \u201cHow many Grandmasters has this esteemed group risen in the past week? Three if I counted the portals correctly. While not a single one of my Master Alchemists has crossed that vaunted threshold. I really must take lessons from all of you to better understand my shortcomings. To think that this group is responsible for raising so many to Grandmaster, well, it really defies belief.\u201d Barbas turned to the Muses and pointed at Ruwen. \u201cSee how he mocks us.\u201d \u201cMock you? Me? Please explain.\u201d Barbas whipped around and strode at Ruwen. Barbas stopped inside what Ruwen considered an impolite social distance and leaned forward, his face inches from Ruwen\u2019s. When Ruwen didn\u2019t back away, Barbas grew angrier. If Barbas had spent even a fraction of his life fighting, he\u2019d have recognized from Ruwen\u2019s stance and posture that he was someone to avoid. Instead, Barbas always relied on his large size to intimidate scholars and alchemists and never needed to learn what he considered a primitive skill like brawling. \u201cYou place your nonsense directly inside their brains,\u201d Barbas shouted. \u201cThey\u2019ve told us.\u201d Ruwen laughed. \u201cTrust me, Barbas the Bellower, I don\u2019t possess the skill for that. If I touched your brain, it would turn to mush. Well, mushier, I guess.\u201d Barbas growled, and Ruwen watched with amusement as Barbas stepped back and slapped Ruwen with surprising force. The older alchemist likely aided his swing with magic. Ruwen didn\u2019t shift even a fraction as Barbas\u2019 wrist snapped from the impact. Barbas screamed in agony, and Ruwen wondered if the man had no tolerance for pain, a gift for acting, or lived so pampered that the slightest discomfort sent him crazy. \u201cYou should have a Healer look at that,\u201d Ruwen offered. \u201cThe break didn\u2019t sound clean.\u201d One of the other Grandmasters sneered at Ruwen and handed Barbas a Major Healing Elixir. From the color, Ruwen knew the most likely recipe. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t drink that,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a greenleaf derivative and won\u2019t heal the microfractures. You need a Healer or, barring that, a Superior or greater Healing potion to handle that injury.\u201d Barbas quickly consumed the potion, and the screaming subsided. He rotated his wrist after the potion had finished. Ruwen\u2019s Divine hearing could hear the click with every rotation. \u201cGive my regards to your Healer when they tell you they need to rebreak your wrist to heal it properly. Based on your hysterical reaction to a compound fracture, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ll only suffer the dull ache of the misaligned bones for three days before the discomfort overcomes your undeserved pride.\u201d Barbas pointed at Ruwen but spoke to the Muses. \u201cHe injured me. Broke my wrist. I\u2019m your only hope for a successful quest outcome, and you must protect me. This charlatan must be punished.\u201d \u201cListening to your crying was punishment enough,\u201d Ruwen said. He faced the Muses as well. \u201cI swear that I\u2019m not responsible for placing anything in their alchemists\u2019 heads.\u201d \u201cHow are they advancing?\u201d Barbas yelled. \u201cWe never approve skill ups. It can only be you!\u201d Ruwen leaned back to demonstrate his shock. He turned from Barbas to the Muses. \u201cWere you aware the Grandmasters, by their own admission, refuse to approve skill ups? That seems like an insult to your hospitality. If they truly wanted to offer the best service to the Muses, they would be helping their alchemists advance, not suppressing them.\u201d The center Muse turned his attention to Barbas. \u201cIs this true, Grandmaster?\u201d Barbas stumbled for words, completely blindsided by the sudden turn. \u201cWell, to some degree,\u201d he sputtered. \u201cWe must be careful about who gets raised.\u201d He pointed at Ruwen. \u201cSee what happens when they let just anyone advance.\u201d \u201cIndeed,\u201d Ruwen responded. \u201cBarbas makes my point for me. My team is almost finished with our first basic attempts to satisfy the quest requirements. I propose a deal subject to the Muses\u2019 enforcement and based on Barbas\u2019 own observations. Since I\u2019m the product, by his own accusation, of reckless advancement, every Grandmaster Alchemist I surpass on the quest ranking leaderboards must approve every skill advancement for their alchemists immediately and without any obligation. I promise to stop interacting with the followers of anyone who beats me on the leaderboards.\u201d \u201cYou fool,\u201d Barbas said. \u201cAs if you have any hope of making it onto the leaderboards.\u201d \u201cExcellent point,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cTo make the contest more interesting, for every leaderboard I manage to reach the top one hundred, all alchemists are granted two hours of free time per day for personal study and advancement.\u201d Barbas sneered. \u201cTop ten and one hour of free time.\u201d \u201cAgreed,\u201d Ruwen said immediately. \u201cIf I manage to reach number one, the Grandmasters will supply resources to their alchemists to support their research.\u201d \u201cSuch arrogance. First place, please. What tier of resources?\u201d \u201cEvery leaderboard I reach first place in will increase the tier level by one. Oh, and it doesn\u2019t need to be me that concocts our submission. I\u2019ve been a bit distracted, and the Master Alchemists from my Chapter have taken the lead. So, I\u2019ll submit their work.\u201d \u201cYou are going to submit Master Alchemist work to the Muses?\u201d Barbas asked in disbelief. He turned to the Muses. \u201cDo you see how he disrespects you and us at every opportunity?\u201d Ruwen faced the Muses. He hated himself for his next words, but they fit the occasion. \u201cNever judge a pastry by its frosting.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Barbas asked. \u201cThere is no harm in allowing our Chapter\u2019s Master Alchemists to submit their work. The only harm is to your ego when they best your marks.\u201d \u201cWhat foolish nonsense! Have your Apprentices submit then for all I care.\u201d \u201cWhat a superb idea,\u201d Ruwen responded and then slumped his shoulders. \u201cHowever, our last Apprentices just advanced. Our slowest learner just reached Journeyman, and our newest alchemist already passed Journeyman and is an Acolyte. Turns out she is a natural. I\u2019ll check to see if they\u2019ve created anything.\u201d Barbas wisely ignored Ruwen and looked around at the Grandmasters, who all nodded their agreement. He faced the Muses and bowed. \u201cWe agree to the terms.\u201d He turned to Ruwen. \u201cNow stop interfering with our alchemists immediately.\u201d \u201cOnly if I lose,\u201d Ruwen said and left. \n CHAPTER 48 Ruwen went from the meeting directly to the alchemy lab. On his way, he heard the grumbling of the Master Alchemists about the disappearance of Shadow Realm creatures in the buffer zone. After a couple days of training with Ky, the surrounding creatures learned that avoiding the newcomers increased their odds of survival. This created a bubble where no Shadow Realm creatures entered, and the other alchemists were forced to go deeper into the forest. \u201cAll right, it\u2019s time to see how we measure up,\u201d Ruwen said as he entered the lab. \u201cBut we\u2019re not close to being ready,\u201d Madda responded. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t plan on giving them our current attempts. I was thinking more of our first one.\u201d \u201cThose early attempts were far from ideal,\u201d Padda said. \u201cThey were terrible,\u201d Madda added. \u201cI know, but I think they\u2019re still far better than anything the Muses currently have, and I don\u2019t want to provide too much value until I understand what\u2019s happening here. These quests are strange, and I\u2019m sure something else is going on.\u201d Ruwen smiled at their expressions and then realized he still wore his mask, so he quickly removed it. \u201cI know as alchemists, you want to always present your best work, and you\u2019re probably worried that this will reflect poorly on the Black Pyramid chapter.\u201d \u201cAnd on you,\u201d Madda said. \u201cPride and standing are important in the hierarchy of Grandmasters.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m counting on that, which is why I\u2019m going to make it clear that I barely participated in this and that it was the Black Pyramid Master Alchemists that produced these samples. I\u2019m only doing that because I know for certain that these first attempts will triple any current success on the leaderboard.\u201d Padda considered Ruwen\u2019s words for three seconds before responding. \u201cThat will cause great animosity among the other Grandmasters. To have Masters submit work is unheard of, but for that work to outshine Grandmasters is an insult beyond their comprehension.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m going for. Alchemy is about the pursuit of knowledge and expanding understanding, not this terrible system of oppression and profiteering that they\u2019ve created. And honestly, they\u2019ll be way angrier when the second part of my agreement kicks in.\u201d \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Sift asked. Ruwen waved hello at Sift and Lylan, who\u2019d been arranging ingredients on a far shelf. \u201cWhen I found out that Madda and Padda could approve your and Lylan\u2019s skill ups when they acted as mentors, it gave me an idea on how to help the thousands of Master Alchemists in those camps and upset the Grandmasters who act like tyrants.\u201d \u201cIs that why they all went to the Muses?\u201d Lylan asked. \u201cYeah, which was their mistake. Because now I\u2019m going to make it ten times worse.\u201d \u201cThat sounds about right,\u201d Sift said. Padda looked concerned. \u201cWhat do you have planned?\u201d \u201cYou probably noticed the three recent Grandmaster level ups. Initially I projected my voice over the camps, then Rami placed lectures inside the Masters\u2019 memories to increase their knowledge. Now, with the agreement I just made, when we enter your elixirs and take first place in every leaderboard, not only do the Master Alchemists get free time every day for research and study, but the Grandmasters must provide them with the resources. I asked Arcanum\u2060\u2014\u201d \u201cArcanum?\u201d Sift asked. Ruwen tapped his temple so that Sift knew Arcanum was one of Ruwen\u2019s mental entities. Lylan also knew the extent of his mental world, but Madda and Padda didn\u2019t, and he didn\u2019t want to explain. \u201cShe\u2019s a Grandmaster I know, and she\u2019s prepared thousands of lectures which Rami will place in all the alchemists\u2019 minds. Even if the Grandmasters send their Masters away, they won\u2019t be able to stop the advancements. Miranda is proof that you don\u2019t need to be near a Master Alchemist to approve their skill ups. There is about to be a new era of alchemy.\u201d Lylan\u2019s heart rate increased, and Ruwen glanced at her in concern. \u201cI know this knowledge is probably intended for Masters,\u201d Lylan said, \u201cbut may I please have it too, so it\u2019s there when I need it?\u201d The increased heart rate originated from Lylan\u2019s unfamiliar need to ask for help. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Ruwen responded. \u201cIn fact, I should\u2019ve thought of this earlier. Each of you tell me the areas you\u2019re most interested in, and I\u2019ll ask Arcanum to create special lessons for each of you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with this Grandmaster,\u201d Padda said. \u201cIt seems like a lot to ask.\u201d \u201cBelieve me,\u201d Ruwen responded, \u201cshe\u2019s super excited to contribute. Her approach is clever\u2060\u2014\u201d Ruwen paused and considered Arcanum\u2019s existence. Was she happy toiling away with no outlet for her discoveries? He\u2019d devised a solution for that particular problem, but there were likely hundreds of thousands of other issues the Narrators likely experienced inside his mind. Ruwen wanted to bring Arcanum out so she could provide one-on-one mentoring with Madda, Padda, and Lylan. Ruwen already knew Sift would dismiss the offer. Doing that would require Ruwen to trust Madda and Padda with at least part of his mental secrets. Facing Madda and Padda, Ruwen gave a brief explanation. \u201cSome of my experiences have had unintended side effects.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the world\u2019s largest understatement,\u201d Sift said. Ruwen smiled at the comment. \u201cAnyway, long story short there are some entities in my mind and the Grandmaster I referred to is one of them.\u201d Madda frowned. \u201cAre you okay? That sounds unnatural.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine, and it has turned into a massive advantage. Anyway, having her in the Material Realm will make her happy and speed up everyone\u2019s advancement.\u201d \u201cForgive me if this is too personal,\u201d Padda said, \u201cbut does Arcanum have a soul?\u201d Ruwen knew that Cultivators cared deeply about souls, which is why Ascendancy horrified them. \u201cNo, but she might someday. That\u2019s something I\u2019m trying to figure out. If it bothers you, though, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Padda shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t discriminate. We are all children of the universe, and I welcome Grandmaster Arcanum to our laboratory.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll go grab the first batch for each quest,\u201d Sift said. \u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Lylan added and followed Sift. \u201cAre you going to turn them in now?\u201d Madda asked. \u201cNo, you two are.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t accept such an honor,\u201d Padda said. \u201cNonsense. You two did the work, so you two get the honor. I\u2019ll take us there to avoid trouble from those grouchy Grandmasters. I can\u2019t wait to see how much more effective your very first attempt was against the Grandmasters\u2019 six months of effort.\u201d After turning in their potions to the Muses, everyone returned to their routines and awaited the outcome. Big D, Bliz, Wip, Qip, and Gunder spent most of their time leveling their new Classes in the forest. Coating their weapons with the drake\u2019s alcohol proved to be an effective damage bonus and made leveling much faster. Bliz, as had always been his dream, took Mage as his first Class and Observer as his second. He hadn\u2019t yet decided how to Specialize Mage but planned to Specialize as a Ranger on the Observer path. Big D, always very practical, planned to take the healing path within the Order Class and pair that with a blunt weapon Specialization from the Fighter Class to give her some close combat abilities. She already had an advantage, after years of using her Baton of a Thousand Uses. Gunder took Observer for his second Class, but Ruwen didn\u2019t know which path the Bard planned on taking. Ruwen guessed Shade though. He would make a powerful spy as a Bard. Ky spent most of the day in the laboratory and leveled her alchemy considerably, reaching the expert rank. She spent afternoons sparring with Sift and Ruwen, and nights, of course, in the Destruction Realm with Ruwen. Ruwen had sword practice with Gunder in the mornings, before the Bard left with the leveling group. Gunder had considerable skill with the sword, and Ruwen made quick progress. Hamma took over after Gunder left, helping Ruwen increase his blunt weapon skill. She still hadn\u2019t chosen a second Class and spent much of her time meditating or trying to learn control of her Psionics. Ruwen spent time with Tremine and Xavier after finishing with Hamma, learning both the math and practical applications of dimensional manipulation. He wanted to gain enough control to open portals like Blapy. The dimensional knowledge would also help with Ruwen\u2019s Cultivation quests. They required he learn how to astral project his body to another location and to shift his spirit into different realms. Once he mastered those, he could work on translocating his body in the current realm and into another. Those four items were all that remained in the Cultivation quest line. Chip and Stump spent time with both Bliz and Sift, training them in the art of Infusion Brewing. Although it just looked like a lot of drinking to Ruwen. Despite all the necessary healing potions both Sift and Bliz made incredible progress. Thankfully, Bliz didn\u2019t want everyone to drink his latest brew, but Sift, on the other hand, bugged everyone to try his creations, which were usually some type of fruity beer that tasted awful. Madda and Padda along with Ky and Lylan, and sometimes Sift, toiled away in the alchemy laboratory. Ky focused on poison. Lylan wanted to absorb everything, even taking Ruwen\u2019s Collector Class novice manual that focused on minerals and rocks. Madda and Padda had both reached level nine hundred ninety-nine and were desperate to gain the last skill up. They told Ruwen the last point could take a decade. Nevertheless, they both studied and discussed Ruwen\u2019s lectures hoping to trigger that final burst of insight. Ruwen learned in the first couple of days that much of normal alchemy was spent waiting as your concoctions baked, boiled, or dissolved. In the afternoons, before sparring, Ruwen spent time with the drakes learning Chip\u2019s body manipulation and Stump\u2019s illusion magic. Since Ruwen\u2019s soul didn\u2019t regenerate energy yet, all his learning was theoretical and observational but still very valuable. Findley continued to cook for everyone. Despite the chef being part of Ruwen\u2019s group, word of his culinary skills got around, and he spent much of his time away from camp cooking for the other Grandmasters. After dinner Gunder gave lessons to Ruwen and Overlord on how to play the lute. Not only did it give Ruwen a creative outlet, but it also allowed him and Overlord to spend some valuable time together. Plus, as a Bard, he should know how to play something. In the hours between Shadow Step practice ending and Hamma waking up, Ruwen had time for personal items. The current step in the Harbinger quest required him to Fortify from Angel to Archangel. That process required condensing more Soul Power into his cells, but his soul had still not recovered. Even if Ruwen had recovered, he didn\u2019t think increasing his body Fortification or utilizing his soul would be advisable since, if his theory was correct and leveling all the magics required them to stay in balance, the last things he should work on were his soul or body. On the magic wheel, Ruwen\u2019s Mind, Body, Harmony, and Soul had all out-leveled his Primal, Psionics, and Chakras. He worried that it might already be too late to level the magics that had fallen behind. Ruwen briefly considered working on his Harmonic quest and strengthening his Harmony ability. He thought Harmony only acted as a bridge between all the magics, but he wasn\u2019t positive, and he didn\u2019t want to level it and create yet another hurdle for himself. Thanks to Rami, Ruwen had something he could do that leveled both his Primal and Psionic magic. The luck Pen\u2019s sword provided took longer for him to extract so he\u2019d utilized the twenty-five points his Fortune\u2019s Luck ability provided instead. So in the hours before Hamma woke, Ruwen used Fortune\u2019s Blessing, the recipe he\u2019d gained upon becoming a Grandmaster Alchemist, to create liquid luck. Just after breakfast, before Big D left with her leveling group, the two of them would walk the fortress perimeter and talk. Ruwen had no aspirations of learning Big D\u2019s organizational skills, because his mind didn\u2019t work that way. What Big D could help him with related to the political environment that absorbing two other countries would create. When Ruwen had first met Big D, she\u2019d already spent decades fighting for equal treatment of a suppressed Class. He saw parallels between the Worker Class struggles and what these new countries might experience after he took them over. She agreed, and they discussed the pros and cons of different inclusion methods along with varying political structures. The advancement of his weapon skills, comprehension of advanced dimensional math, and Shadow Step practice all combined to make these days the happiest of his life. Three days after turning in their potions to the Muses, the leaderboards updated. Ruwen knew when it happened because the Master Alchemists, who\u2019d spent the last three days without any lectures from Ruwen, had watched the leaderboards like starving men and women. They did this because Ruwen had communicated the entire deal he\u2019d made with the Grandmasters to every alchemist. The hope and excitement coming from the Grandmasters\u2019 camps was palpable as they prayed that Ruwen would place first on at least one of the six leaderboards. Ruwen grabbed Madda and Padda, and Blinked them all to the rear of the leaderboards. The three of them squeezed into the crowd that had gathered in front of the display. Prime Quest Leaderboard: 1. Master Madda and Master Padda 2. Grandmaster Barbas Ruwen smiled, making sure his hood stayed well forward to hide his face. He focused on the details. Type: Potion Ease of Use: 10 of 10 Abundance of Ingredients: 3 of 10 Ease of Creation: 2 of 10 Effectiveness: 82% Chapter: Black Pyramid Academy: None Grandmaster Stars: Not Applicable As the crowd rejoiced, some laughing and others crying in joy, Ruwen glanced at the other five leaderboards. Madda and Padda had taken first place in all of them. Ruwen\u2019s smile turned into a grin, and he reached out to Arcanum. Hey, clear your schedule. You\u2019re about to start a lot of lecturing. \n CHAPTER 49 Over the next month, Madda and Padda made vast improvements to the original potions that had won them first place, but Ruwen hadn\u2019t bothered to turn them in since they still sat in first place. The pair of Master Alchemists believed they were on the cusp of creating a one hundred percent effective immunity potion, and Ruwen knew they were right as they came close to replicating what he\u2019d initially come up with over a month ago. Madda and Padda needed Ky in the laboratory, so only Sift practiced the Steps with Ruwen now. Hamma sat nearby meditating, waiting for them to finish so they could all go to dinner. Ruwen had made immense progress in the last month in almost every aspect, and he considered this one of the best months of his life. He checked in with Lir every few days, and things back home were on track as well. Even Talker had made progress with the northern and eastern countries that had lost their gods. Leaning away from Sift\u2019s finger strike, Ruwen felt the air of its passing, which cooled his skin enough to cause it to prickle, and he considered putting his shirt back on. Ruwen shifted his center of gravity backward, twisting his hips and taking a small step to the right, avoiding the backhand that he correctly predicted Sift would try next. \u201cAre you looking in the future?\u201d Sift asked. \u201cNo, you\u2019re just that predictable.\u201d \u201cOh yeah? Try this then.\u201d Sift\u2019s eyes pulsed with a flash of Soul Energy bright enough to blind a low Gem. Ruwen casually lifted his right foot to avoid Sift\u2019s sweep and used the opportunity to try and convert the Soul Energy into Spirit using Harmony. Ruwen came up with the idea after watching Sift practice generating gate runes with Soul Energy. Ruwen wanted to minimize the amount of progress he made with Harmony because of his magical imbalance, but converting one energy into another was a critical skill that he needed to learn. \u201cStop using my deadly attacks as practice,\u201d Sift said. \u201cDeadly, are they? I better be careful.\u201d \u201cYeah, you\u2019d better. Without all that luck, I\u2019d land one of these strikes.\u201d Ruwen allowed Sift to close the distance, anticipating practice breaking holds. Sift grabbed Ruwen\u2019s elbow and tried to exert enough pressure to trigger a nerve bundle but didn\u2019t have the strength to exert even the slightest pressure on Ruwen\u2019s Angelic skin. Ruwen locked his arm around Sift\u2019s and twisted to the left, rotating his hips and throwing Sift. Sift didn\u2019t release Ruwen\u2019s arm and used his momentum to pull downward. He kicked at Ruwen\u2019s groin, but Ruwen grabbed Sift\u2019s foot with his free hand and used the kick\u2019s force to rotate all the way around to land on his feet. The technique yanked Sift to his feet, and as Ruwen twisted Sift\u2019s leg, Sift released his hold on Ruwen\u2019s arm and rotated with Ruwen\u2019s attack, trying to kick Ruwen in the head. Ruwen released Sift\u2019s foot and stepped back as Sift gracefully landed on his feet. \u201cHow much did you make, anyway?\u201d Sift asked. Ruwen stepped close and Sift deflected the strike to the eyes and the palm strike to his solar plexus. \u201cI regenerate one point of luck back every week, so with the twenty-two luck I started with\u2060\u2014\u201d \u201cI thought the sword gave you way more than that.\u201d \u201cIt does, but it takes longer to extract the luck gained from items and I\u2019m impatient. So, I\u2019m just using the twenty-five points my Fortune\u2019s Luck ability gives me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s so broken. Here\u2019s twenty-five points of luck, have a nice day.\u201d \u201cIt took a thousand alchemy levels to get those twenty-five points.\u201d \u201cOh, right. That afternoon you spent in the lab you mean.\u201d Ruwen laughed. \u201cOkay, fair enough. Anyway, the twenty-two points is because Tarot penalizes me three luck. I have an idea for that if the little troublemaker would ever show up. Every time he disappears, I feel like something terrible is about to happen.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s only because that\u2019s what happens.\u201d Sift faked a right sweep executed so flawlessly that it would have worked against anyone except Ruwen. \u201cNice,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cHave you been practicing behind my back?\u201d \u201cUgh, I worked with Ky all month on that. You really are inhuman.\u201d \u201cDivine, my Gem friend.\u201d \u201cYou never told me how much luck you made.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s because you interrupted me. With my weekly regen, I have twenty-six drops.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s weird that it uses your blood.\u201d \u201cWell, it does, and you have to drink it.\u201d Sift jumped at Ruwen and tried to land a kick to the ribs. Ruwen stepped back and slapped a nerve bundle in Sift\u2019s calf, causing his friend to stumble when he regained his feet. Sift wagged a finger at Ruwen. \u201cI\u2019m on to you. Hamma told Lylan that you don\u2019t have to drink it. It just needs to touch your skin.\u201d Ruwen glanced at Hamma, who tried to hide her smile. \u201cI thought you were meditating,\u201d Ruwen said. Hamma gracefully stood from her cross-legged position. \u201cYou\u2019re so mean to him. He\u2019s been stressed out for a month about drinking your blood like some sort of leech.\u201d \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the whole point. What fun is telling him the truth?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand the relationship you two have.\u201d \u201cWait, aren\u2019t you supposed to be like the expert on connections?\u201d \u201cYes, normal connections.\u201d Sift laughed. \u201cYour girlfriend just called you abnormal.\u201d \u201cIt takes two to be abnormal, genius.\u201d Hamma strode over and gave Ruwen a kiss. \u201cI\u2019m going to wash up. I\u2019ll see you at dinner.\u201d She turned to Sift. \u201cLylan is going to be upset you ratted on her.\u201d Sift\u2019s eyes grew wide. Hamma strode away. Sift turned to Ruwen. \u201cDo you think she\u2019ll tell on me? I don\u2019t remember if Lylan told me to keep the no drinking a secret.\u201d Ruwen took pity on his friend. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a secret. She just said that to get in your head.\u201d Sift glanced at the distant Hamma. \u201cThat\u2019s just evil. After scolding you for giving me a hard time too.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s called misdirection. By accusing me of teasing you, you\u2019re less likely to see the same behavior in her. She\u2019s practicing on us. Lylan is obviously teaching her Shade tricks.\u201d \u201cWell, that isn\u2019t good. We don\u2019t need two of those.\u201d Ruwen sat cross-legged. \u201cDarkness take me, I hope she doesn\u2019t choose Observer for her second Class.\u201d Sift sat across from Ruwen. \u201cI didn\u2019t think those two would ever decide. Lylan hasn\u2019t told me, but I think she might have chosen something.\u201d Ruwen guessed Lylan had already chosen one of the new, darker Classes: Witch. \u201cHey,\u201d Sift said. \u201cIn all seriousness, I wanted to thank you for helping my mom and dad.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re helping themselves.\u201d \u201cYou would look at it that way, but the truth is, between the knowledge you and Arcanum provide and you allowing them to work with all these exotic materials and figure everything out for themselves, you gave them a priceless opportunity.\u201d Ruwen waved a hand, dismissing Sift\u2019s comment. \u201cHow many Grandmasters have you and Arcanum created this month?\u201d Ruwen shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe twenty.\u201d Sift leaned back on his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. When my parents exited that portal, my stomach dropped from disappointment. I thought to myself how typical that they\u2019d arrive to ruin the closest thing I\u2019ve had to a vacation.\u201d Sift looked into the sky, remembering the scene for a few seconds before focusing back on Ruwen. \u201cThen Lylan took an interest in alchemy, and predictably my parents used that to try and motivate me. It felt like the Black Pyramid all over again.\u201d Ruwen felt a little guilty for taking pleasure in that. He\u2019d noticed the tension Sift experienced but hadn\u2019t realized how deep the emotions went. He and Sift demonstrated their affection by giving each other a hard time, and Ruwen hadn\u2019t considered the deeper feelings that might surface when Sift\u2019s parents and Lylan all combined. Sift raised a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t say you\u2019re sorry. I know you didn\u2019t intend any of that. In fact, I\u2019m super thankful it happened. I watched my mom and dad help Lylan, and I saw how much they care about her and her learning. It dawned on me that they used the same approach with me. What I grew up thinking was bossy or mean or overbearing was just them trying to help me.\u201d Sift paused and swallowed hard. \u201cIt shook me. Bad. For the first time, I realized how much they loved me. Like, I actually saw it. Along with how terrible a son I\u2019ve been.\u201d He paused a couple of seconds before continuing. \u201cSeeing the incredible joy their alchemy progress created allowed me to see them as people\u2014not just my parents.\u201d Sift pinched his eyes, and Ruwen stayed silent, giving Sift the space he needed. \u201cThen you gave them each three drops of liquid luck to help them reach Grandmaster. A drop is priceless, and you gave them six. I have never seen my parents so happy, and I felt this intense pride.\u201d \u201cPride?\u201d Ruwen asked when Sift didn\u2019t speak. Sift nodded and locked eyes with Ruwen. \u201cYeah, pride. Pride that my best friend was such an incredible person. That you do all these things, miracles really, and think nothing of it. It was like seeing you for the first time too.\u201d \u201cIn all fairness,\u201d Ruwen said, \u201cI\u2019ve been telling you for years how awesome I am.\u201d Sift laughed. \u201cI know. And for a few weeks, here in the shadows, you\u2019ve succeeded.\u201d \u201cOnly awesome for a few weeks? Didn\u2019t you see me when I faced Simandreial?\u201d \u201cI was beside you, not looking at you.\u201d \u201cOh yeah. What about when I fought those gods?\u201d \u201cSorry, I was risking my life cleaning up your planet-ending explosion.\u201d \u201cOh yeah. What about when I transformed that entire planet into a lush paradise?\u201d \u201cFirst, moss doesn\u2019t count as a lush paradise. And second, we didn\u2019t witness your grand transformation because Shelly and I, once again, had risked our lives navigating the universe to find you.\u201d \u201cOh yeah. What about\u2060\u2014\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d Sift said, interrupting Ruwen. \u201cAre you trying to say something without saying something?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Am I?\u201d Sift narrowed his eyes in consideration for a few seconds. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m kind of awesome myself.\u201d \u201cEmphasis on \u2018kind of.\u2019 Also, only sometimes.\u201d \u201cSometimes? You created moss. I navigated a flying space turtle for eighteen months.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m thinking that was mostly Shelly. If we were keeping an awesomeness score, I\u2019m way ahead.\u201d \u201cNo way, I\u2019m\u2060\u2014\u201d Sift stopped mid-sentence. \u201cWhat?\u201d Ruwen asked. Sift didn\u2019t respond right away, so Ruwen opened his Notifications and quickly approved them all. He got dozens every day now as Master Alchemists leveled up. It had become a habit to just approve them all whenever he had a free moment. Sift finally responded. \u201cLylan said Mom and Dad are really excited. That this last attempt worked and\u2060\u2014\u201d Sift\u2019s explanation was cut off by screaming\u2026 screaming from the alchemy lab. \n CHAPTER 50 Ruwen had mastered short distance portals and created one into the laboratory. He and Sift jumped through, ready for a fight. At the sight of Madda and Padda jumping up and down, hugging each other, Ruwen realized Madda\u2019s screams were of joy, not distress, and it only took another breath to realize why. Lylan came over and put an arm around Sift\u2019s waist. \u201cI like this better than the robe,\u201d Lylan said. Ruwen realized he and Sift only wore loose sparring pants and no shirt or shoes because of their rapid response. Ruwen didn\u2019t interrupt, and the pair only stopped celebrating when they noticed him. They bowed, tear-streaked faces suddenly solemn. \u201cCongratulations to you both,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cIt\u2019s so well-deserved.\u201d Ruwen sensed the dimensional distortion forming next to him. With his new training, he recognized that this portal originated off planet and that a deity had created it. Miranda, wearing her Grandmaster Alchemist robe, exited the portal. She saw Ruwen first and raised an eyebrow. \u201cIs this how we do alchemy now?\u201d Miranda asked. Ruwen patted his stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s very comfortable. I think all alchemists will be doing it this way soon.\u201d Miranda shook her head at Ruwen before stepping up to Madda and Padda who remained bowing and raised them upright with a gentle hand. \u201cWell done,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cI\u2019d hoped the currents that swirl around Grandmaster Starfield would bend fate to your advantage. Come, let us finish with your final exam.\u201d Realizing that Miranda was about to leave with Madda and Padda, Ruwen removed eight vials. Each held a seed-sized ball of what looked like golden mercury. He projected Identify\u2019s information for everyone to see. Name: Fortune\u2019s Blessing Quality: Mythical Effect: +1 luck Description: A golden mercurial sphere. Created from the blood of a fortune-focused Grandmaster Alchemist, Fortune\u2019s Blessing is the rarest and most valuable substance in the Universe. It permanently alters the fate of any item or person it contacts. Miranda became still as she studied the eight vials. \u201cYou used the sword\u2019s luck to make all this?\u201d Miranda asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Ruwen replied. \u201cThe fifty from the sword is harder to access so I\u2019m using the twenty-five Fortune\u2019s Luck provides. I need to keep three in reserve to balance that irritating golem.\u201d \u201cThat is a large sacrifice. A loss of twenty-two luck makes you more vulnerable to the System and Fate.\u201d Ruwen shrugged. \u201cMy friends are at the mercy of the System now, so I wanted to change that right away. This is the perfect place, too, as I\u2019m not in any danger. This whole experience has been more like a training vacation than work, especially when compared to how things normally go for me. Madda and Padda did all the work.\u201d Miranda raised an eyebrow. \u201cFor someone on vacation, you\u2019ve managed to upset a lot of people.\u201d Ruwen raised a finger. \u201cUpset them by making even more people happy.\u201d \u201cAt your current rate, you\u2019ll double the Grandmaster population in another month. You amassed centuries\u2019 worth of knowledge and handed it over to thousands of Master Alchemists without any regard for its immense value.\u201d For the first time, Ruwen considered his actions from that perspective. Had he made a mistake by implanting so much knowledge in everyone\u2019s mind? And the effect would ripple much further as alchemists created hard copies of that knowledge and passed it on. He\u2019d done it without thinking about the long-term consequences. It aligned with his belief that knowledge should be available to everyone, and the best way to better alchemy was to support the community as much as possible. Ruwen now recognized, though, that much of the knowledge he\u2019d gained had come from the Black Pyramid, and Miranda might not appreciate such a vast distribution of that information. In hindsight, he should have either limited the scope of what he shared or at least asked for permission. Ruwen opened his mouth to apologize, but Miranda held up a hand, interrupting him. \u201cWell done, Grandmaster.\u201d Relief flooded Ruwen, not because he\u2019d avoided trouble but because it reaffirmed for him that Miranda\u2019s view of the universe still aligned with his. Once again, she\u2019d proven herself a friend to the greater good. Ruwen bowed deeply to Miranda. \u201cI\u2019m honored to represent the Black Pyramid.\u201d Miranda nodded. \u201cYou do the chapter great honor, and this gift of Fortune\u2019s Blessing is far more than any debt you owed our chapter. You honor yourself and your fellow alchemists in bestowing such a gift. The distribution?\u201d \u201cUltimately, I know all the decisions were yours, so I\u2019ll leave the final decision to you. My intent was four vials for you and four vials for Fluffy.\u201d \u201cSo it shall be,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cThe Quartermaster will be beside himself with joy. I\u2019m guessing no one will need to hide in a suit of armor ever again.\u201d The last was said while leveling a stare at Sift. Ruwen snapped his fingers before Sift could respond. \u201cOh yeah, Io led us to this amazing substance that absorbs any kind of energy.\u201d Ruwen produced another vial and handed it to Miranda. \u201cI\u2019m ninety percent sure this ink is derived from pheromones. It\u2019s extremely complex and beyond my or Uruziel\u2019s ability to replicate. I was hoping you could give it a try.\u201d Miranda accepted the vial with a nod. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do. Io led you to this?\u201d \u201cOh no,\u201d Sift said. \u201cWe left him back with our shirts in the sparring yard.\u201d \u201cWhen the Pact ended Io spoke to me. He\u2019s obviously far more than he appears but won\u2019t discuss his past. I think Uru looted the dagger in the Black Pyramid, and I assumed you\u2019d created him.\u201d \u201cWhatever you learn from that dagger, please let me know,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cThe Black Pyramid created the loot, but they did not create Io. Io only resides there, and he does so at his own will.\u201d \u201cI met Io in the Fainting Goat on my Ascension Day,\u201d Ruwen glanced at Ky, who attempted to stay inconspicuous near one of the bookshelves. \u201cEver since that day, I\u2019ve wondered what Io can do. Elder weapons are supposed to be capable of powerful things.\u201d \u201cAnd some babble nonsensical stories constantly,\u201d Ky added from the shadows. \u201cAnd only help when they want to.\u201d \u201cTo be truthful,\u201d Miranda said, \u201cI place Io in the same tier as the thirty-two golems.\u201d Ruwen didn\u2019t glance at Lylan, but he noticed her heartbeat had doubled at the mention of the golems. \u201cThey are beyond the scope of what is normal for this universe and unexplainable. The Dungeon Mistress can provide more examples, but Io\u2019s abilities seem to fall into two categories.\u201d \u201cWait, Io does more than tell awesome stories?\u201d Sift asked. \u201cThree categories then. He tells what some consider interesting stories, can be in multiple locations at the same time, and can, as far as I can determine, literally create anything.\u201d Ky spoke again. \u201cTry getting him to make you a key or unlock a vault without having to listen to an insane story, even if you\u2019re in a hurry and about to be captured and killed. I swear he brings me to the brink of death just so he can have another fun story to tell.\u201d Ruwen absorbed all this information. It confirmed his suspicions, and it meant that Io was not some innocent bystander in all of this but an active participant\u2014possibly even more. Ruwen gave a small bow. \u201cThank you. I understand.\u201d Miranda nodded and faced Madda and Padda, both still grinning. They held hands, and their cheeks remained wet. Miranda returned the smile, the rare gesture turning her from severe to motherly in a moment. Ruwen was grateful to witness it. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you both,\u201d Miranda said, \u201cand the chapter has blossomed from one Grandmaster to five in the blink of an eye.\u201d Ruwen frowned. \u201cFive?\u201d Miranda turned back to Ruwen. \u201cHave you gone through Arcanum\u2019s lectures?\u201d Ruwen shook his head. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve been a little self-absorbed with my own training.\u201d \u201cNothing wrong with that. I only wondered if you knew.\u201d \u201cI guess not.\u201d \u201cArcanum is an alchemical genius. I have leveled three times just reading her work and the insights it provided. When I actually try some of her theories in the lab, I\u2019m sure to level again. Do you know how long it\u2019s been since I leveled my alchemy?\u201d \u201cA long time?\u201d \u201cYes, a long time. May I speak with her?\u201d \u201cOf course. One second.\u201d Arcanum, do you have a moment? There\u2019s a goddess out here who wants to talk with you. Ruwen grimaced in pain as Arcanum tapped his Core to create her personal alchemist Minion that closely matched her actual appearance. Arcanum wore a simple black robe and a scarf and goggles hung around her neck. Her silver hair looked like mercury and she\u2019d pulled it into a bun. Dark skin and sharp features gave her an aura of danger and elegance. Arcanum bowed to Ruwen, her hands near her shoulders, similar to when he summoned his Wrathful Crow Beater from the Scarecrow Aspect. As she always did when appearing, she spoke in a chanted whisper while remaining bowed, her voice serious. \u201cEternal Reaper, shelter us. Watch over us. Judge us worthy to protect the harvest.\u201d Ruwen hated this and it was even more embarrassing with Miranda here, but he knew this exchange held importance to Arcanum and she wouldn\u2019t rise from her bow until he responded. \u201cWhat the hands sow, the heart reaps.\u201d Arcanum stood, and they spoke the final words together. \u201cThe harvest nears.\u201d \u201cThank you for coming, Arcanum,\u201d Ruwen continued. \u201cThis is the Goddess Miranda.\u201d Arcanum bowed deeply to Miranda. \u201cRise child,\u201d Miranda said. Miranda had noticed the painful response as Arcanum had appeared and Miranda turned her attention back to Ruwen. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your Core?\u201d \u201cI, uh, was practicing with a friend and discovered that I can\u2019t just suck everything into my Core. So\u2026I have some Soul Energy floating around in there.\u201d Miranda pinched the bridge of her nose. \u201cThat was you that fought Ceplotryn in his Divine Realm? We all thought since he survived that he\u2019d killed whoever had attacked him, but I see now that it\u2019s a little more complicated than that. Am I to assume, since you\u2019re alive, that Ceplotryn is under your control now? And how does this rank as a vacation in your mind?\u201d \u201cI said the same thing,\u201d Sift added. \u201cHe has no sense of what constitutes a proper vacation. I\u2060\u2014\u201d Lylan interrupted Sift by placing her arm through his and casually stomping on his foot. Ruwen rubbed his chest. \u201cI did say training vacation, and when the opportunity presented itself, I thought it offered a great chance to test what fighting in another Divine Realm was like while getting some much-needed information.\u201d Miranda shook her head. \u201cYou literally never stop.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a character flaw,\u201d Sift offered before Lylan dug her nails into his Gem-fortified skin to stop him from speaking. Ruwen glanced at Sift before responding to Miranda. \u201cHamma says I should lean into my strengths while not neglecting my weaknesses.\u201d \u201cA wise woman, that priestess.\u201d Miranda turned to Arcanum. \u201cI have read your lectures, which confirm your brilliance, and I witnessed your work with Grandmaster Starfield. At the time, I didn\u2019t pursue speaking with you because of the unique relationship you have with Grandmaster Starfield. After reading your work, however, I am certain that you are separate and unique. There is no arguing the vast intellect that Grandmaster Starfield possesses, but the crack in his crucible is detail. I love details and the minutiae of the world, and so I recognize it in others. If you desire, I would like to take you with Grandmaster Madda and Grandmaster Padda for your final testing. Is that something you desire, Grandmaster Arcanum?\u201d Arcanum looked at Ruwen. \u201cYou don\u2019t need my permission,\u201d Ruwen told Arcanum. \u201cYou have free will, and I\u2019d never stand in the way of your progress.\u201d Arcanum smiled and bowed deeply to Ruwen. \u201cThank you, Eternal Reaper.\u201d Ruwen still disliked the terms the Narrators used to address him, but there was nothing he could do to stop it, so he just nodded his acknowledgment. \u201cWill Arcanum be okay without her connection to me? I\u2019ve only done this twice, and you were there the first time. Not that we can consider that place normal. The second was Nameless, and Lalquinrial immediately took over that connection.\u201d \u201cWatch,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been experimenting and discovered an excellent method to preserve the integrity of an entity when separated from its source.\u201d By \u201cwe\u201d Miranda meant her and Kholy. Ruwen had left the construct with Miranda when he\u2019d landed in the Third Secret. Now that decision had resulted in knowledge that would benefit everyone in Ruwen\u2019s mind. Ruwen immediately triggered Harmonic Sight and Knowledge. In the last week, the fruits of his work with Fortune\u2019s Blessing had gifted him with noticeable changes to Harmonic Sight. The spectrum of colors had increased, and the lines had softened and become less rigid. It meant both his Primal magic and Conceptual magic had improved. When Miranda took hold of the connection to Arcanum, Ruwen released it, and Miranda demonstrated three times how to create a sphere of power using Spirit or Soul Power and carefully grafting Arcanum\u2019s connection to the energy source so she could maintain her integrity. Ruwen had wanted this technique for a while, and it would result in a vastly better quality of life for the people in his mind as he now had a way to set them free for real. \u201cThank you,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cThat is valuable knowledge. I assume that only works until the power is drained.\u201d \u201cYes, but in most cases the power requirements for an entity are low. If you give them a way to recharge the sphere themselves, they can become self-sufficient. Oh, and here are some new templates for your Minions,\u201d Miranda told Ruwen as a burst of knowledge appeared in his mind. \u201cYou and Overlord are like two boys with blocks\u2014everything you build is square.\u201d Then, in a blink, Madda, Padda, and Arcanum disappeared with Miranda. \n CHAPTER 51 The new Grandmasters hadn\u2019t returned by the time dinner arrived. Findley created a delicious meal and entertained them with trivia about the different items used in the recipes. Normally, Sift enjoyed this portion, but the miserable gremlin carrying the genie\u2019s lamp had ruined three of Sift\u2019s desserts. The gremlin sneezed on one, covering it in a disgusting yellow-green mucus. Findley offered to scrape it all off, assuring Sift the pie would still be fine, but thank all that was holy Sift let the pie go. Sift probably would\u2019ve been fine except the gremlin then tripped and fell into a red velvet cake. A cake that Sift had asked the genie about for three days. To top it all off, the gremlin squeezed some pastries too hard when handing them to Sift, causing all the filling to explode outward, covering Sift in what smelled like blueberries. Ruwen thought for sure Sift would throttle the gremlin, who managed to look both miserable and satisfied at the same time. Ruwen had to admit the gremlin became very clumsy when handling anything related to Sift. The genie was beside himself and vowed to make up for the mishaps by providing even more desserts tomorrow. This calmed Sift down enough that he only glared at the gremlin. The discovery of Chip and Stump\u2019s alcohol had returned much of Lylan\u2019s spirit, and the drinking started right after dinner. Sift and Bliz had made massive gains with Infusion Brewing. Thankfully, one of the skills they\u2019d learned gave them a very high resistance to the negative effects of alcohol, and for the past two weeks, Hamma hadn\u2019t needed to fix Sift\u2019s organs. Since neither Ruwen nor Hamma drank very often, it gave them a couple of hours together after dinner and lute practice while everyone else partied. They strolled hand-in-hand around the inside perimeter, and Ruwen absentmindedly destroyed the poison and blight that Barbas and the other Grandmasters sent at their fortress. \u201cI decided,\u201d Hamma said. Ruwen stopped. He let go of Hamma\u2019s hand and touched his forehead. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to faint,\u201d Ruwen said, and then yelled, \u201cSomebody call a Healer.\u201d The space three feet in front of Ruwen warped, and Xavier floated out in his natural form, a long cylinder of purple that burned the eyes. A similar cylinder followed, its pink tones more subdued. \u201cWhat is your emergency?\u201d Xavier asked. \u201cOh, sorry, you\u2019re on watch. I shouldn\u2019t have yelled so loud for a Healer.\u201d \u201cAre you aware a Healer stands two point one feet to your right?\u201d Ruwen looked confused and turned to Hamma. \u201cYou\u2019re a Healer?\u201d \u201cCareful, Starfield. Or I\u2019ll make you sleep in your own room from now on.\u201d \u201cYou aren\u2019t sleeping in your own room?\u201d Xavier asked. \u201cAre you not aware of the sleeping chart?\u201d \u201cHe made the chart,\u201d Rami said. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t need a Healer. This is just a misunderstanding.\u201d \u201cI shall return to my post,\u201d Xavier stated. \u201cRefrain from unnecessary calls of distress. Your foolishness has placed the entire fortress in danger.\u201d Despite Xavier\u2019s irritating demeanor, he wasn\u2019t wrong. Ruwen gave a small bow. \u201cI truly apologize for taking you from your patrol, and I sincerely appreciate your quick response. Thank you, Xavier.\u201d Xavier remained silent for three seconds before pulsing a harsh white. \u201cI am unable to determine if he is mocking me,\u201d Xavier said to Rami. \u201cFor once, he\u2019s not. Thank you, Ruwen.\u201d \u201cAcceptable,\u201d Xavier said. \u201cDo you know what\u2019s not acceptable, Xavier? The dimensional vector your portal used is unfamiliar to me, and it appeared to form about thirty percent faster than my version.\u201d Xavier\u2019s purple color turned into dark blues with streaks of grey. \u201cYou detected that?\u201d Xavier asked. \u201cAnd it was twenty-eight percent.\u201d \u201cYup. Are you holding out on me?\u201d Streaks of green and even yellow swirled around the cylinder. \u201cIt only works over short distances, and I am unable to determine why. I did not wish to provide you an incomplete system.\u201d Rami spoke into the awkward silence. \u201cAnd?\u201d \u201cAnd I wanted to keep something for myself so that I could be better than you,\u201d Xavier said in a rush. Rami moved closer to Xavier until they almost overlapped. The static lightning in the area caused the hair on Ruwen\u2019s arms to stand. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d Rami said. \u201cI know that was hard to say.\u201d And what Rami said was true\u2014it was a big deal. \u201cThank you for that honesty, Xavier,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about the issues you\u2019re having with realm-to-realm translocating.\u201d Xavier turned orange, a color Ruwen had never seen before. \u201cAnother failure,\u201d Xavier said quietly. \u201cI have plenty of those myself,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s why I brought this up. Gunder showed me a method that allows one to piggyback on another\u2019s senses. It requires the two people to harmonize by synchronizing their mental frequencies. That will be easy for us because of all that energy work we did in Shelly. So, I guess what I\u2019m saying is I\u2019d like to show you realm-to-realm translocating using Harmonic Sight. I think seeing the vibrational artifacts between this realm and the Shadow Realm is all you need to succeed.\u201d \u201cThat would be immensely beneficial,\u201d Xavier said as the blue hues returned. \u201cGreat. Then I guess Tremine is the odd man out during our next lesson. Although you might consider asking him for help on the distance issue with your new method. We both know he\u2019s a dimensional genius.\u201d Xavier didn\u2019t respond for five seconds, but Ruwen remained silent as the multitude of colors circulating in the cylinder meant a lot of emotional turmoil was occurring. \u201cYou are correct. Asking for help is not failure. We cannot do everything ourselves.\u201d \u201cThat sounds suspiciously like the advice I hear from a particular bookwyrm.\u201d \u201cA very wise woman,\u201d Hamma said. \u201cI must return to my patrol as the fortress is defenseless.\u201d \u201cThanks again, Xavier. I look forward to our lesson tomorrow.\u201d \u201cI as well.\u201d You\u2019re awfully quiet, Ruwen sent to Rami. I\u2019m just happy. My two favorite people had a civil discussion and agreed to help each other. Sift will be crushed when I tell him he didn\u2019t make the top two. A pink arc of lightning traced its way across Ruwen\u2019s chest, scorching his clothes. Ruwen sucked in a breath and yelled, \u201cHelp! I need a Healer!\u201d Xavier returned through the portal. Ruwen pointed to his smoking chest. \u201cYou are extremely irritating,\u201d Xavier said to Ruwen. Ruwen tilted his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. You\u2019re the only one who tells me that.\u201d \u201cOuch!\u201d Ruwen said as three pink arcs of lightning ranged over his body. Without a word, Xavier and Rami entered the portal, and it winked out of existence. Ruwen studied the seared strips that remained of his clothes. \u201cI\u2019m almost out of this Shade gear. I need to visit the quartermaster and get more.\u201d \u201cYou could wear the clothes I bought you,\u201d Hamma said. \u201cNot a chance. Those are way too fancy.\u201d Ruwen used a hand to wave over his body. \u201cThe only person harder on his wardrobe than me is Sift. Although Blapy did give him a new indestructible set. Maybe I should ask for one of those. Anyway, where were we? Oh yeah, you had finally picked a Class.\u201d Ruwen stumbled and placed a hand on his forehead. He sucked in a breath to yell for a Healer. Hamma slapped Ruwen\u2019s shoulder, interrupting him. \u201cKnock it off. It isn\u2019t that big of a deal. And were you seriously just going to scream for a Healer again?\u201d Ruwen grinned. Hamma placed her arm through Ruwen\u2019s and began walking again. \u201cWhy do you purposely needle Xavier?\u201d Ruwen gave the question a few seconds of thought. \u201cI guess at first it was because he was a jerk. Then Rami took a shine to him, and that bothered me, which I might\u2019ve taken out on Xavier a little. And sometimes it was really fun. Remember when he\u2019d just gotten his Celestial adult form, and he couldn\u2019t hold it, and if you shouted an animal, he\u2019d take that form? Uru help me, those were the best days.\u201d They walked in silence for five seconds before Ruwen continued. \u201cI guess now I do it because I\u2019ve grudgingly come to like him. A little.\u201d \u201cHow would anyone know the difference? You treated him the same when he was a jerk, when you were jealous, when it was fun, and now because you like him.\u201d Ruwen shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but it\u2019s always obvious. Like I can tell the difference immediately. Well, almost always. Sift is genuinely angry at Findley, but that genie is always so nice and generally apologetic. That confuses me.\u201d They walked in silence for ten seconds, still arm in arm. \u201cThe time I wasn\u2019t thinking about Classes, I spent studying relationships and connections.\u201d \u201cSo a couple minutes a day.\u201d Hamma laughed. \u201cSomething like that. Anyway, I can honestly say your relationship with Sift is the most complicated I\u2019ve seen, and in fact, I still don\u2019t understand it. There is an echo of the same thing with Xavier.\u201d Ruwen didn\u2019t blow off Hamma\u2019s comment. First, because she was incredibly important to him, and second, he was also studying the emotional and motivational connections around him as he tried to grasp Conceptual magic. \u201cLiterally the first time I met Sift, he handed me a bomb that exploded seconds later into a cloud of poison, which he was somewhat confident wouldn\u2019t kill me. That is terrifying now that I know Sift\u2019s ability to calculate statistical outcomes. Honestly, it\u2019s a miracle I survived.\u201d Ruwen smiled. \u201cBut in a way, it set the tone for our relationship. I never had a best friend, and we fit together like we\u2019d known each other our whole lives. Maybe we\u2019re mean to each other because we think of ourselves as brothers. In a weird way, it\u2019s how I show my affection. Like the more work I put into creating an uncomfortable situation or embarrassing him, the more he knows I care about him.\u201d \u201cThe opposite of love is indifference,\u201d Hamma said. \u201cAs unhealthy as that all sounds, I think I understand better. Framing it with the concept of family especially resonates. You do the same with Lylan and me, but it\u2019s so smothered by your desire to protect that it isn\u2019t as noticeable.\u201d Hamma put her head on Ruwen\u2019s shoulder and squeezed his arm. \u201cThank you for taking my question seriously and telling me how you feel. It really helps as I piece together this kaleidoscope of concepts that I\u2019m beginning to see. The more I think about it, I think Lylan expresses her love in a similar fashion.\u201d \u201cYou mean because of all the stabbing?\u201d \u201cYeah, she really runs the gamut of emotions. Poor Sift, he\u2019s surrounded by abusive relationships.\u201d \u201cWait, how did this turn into a pity party for Sift? And now I suspect you\u2019re distracting me on purpose. I know I can overthink things once in a while, but I truly thought you would die of old age before picking your Classes. So spill it. I\u2019m dying of curiosity.\u201d \u201cYou already know I\u2019m thinking of taking a bunch of specializations in the same Class instead of adding new Classes, but nothing felt right.\u201d Ruwen kept quiet as Hamma gathered her thoughts. \u201cLir, bless his heart, gave me thousands of combinations, and I\u2019ve probably been through all of them now. Anyway, I found one called Vanguard Protector that has the massive auras of the Enforcer path, significant healing ability, the Wisdom bonuses of a Judge, and the administrative skills of a Priest to help me run the chapels. It even has strategic leadership, battlefield control, and weapon proficiency for when communication fails.\u201d \u201cWow, that sounds incredible. Like some kind of super Healer.\u201d Hamma couldn\u2019t hide a smile. \u201cI\u2019m going deep instead of wide, which I know hurts my utility, but I\u2019m not sure anyone cares about that as long as I have the Mana for a heal.\u201d Ruwen unlinked his arm from Hamma and placed it around her shoulders. \u201cI think it\u2019s perfect and will make you even more valuable, if that\u2019s even possible.\u201d Darkness had fallen two hours ago, and Ruwen had left a sleeping Hamma to meet Ky for Shadow Step training. As he made his way through the trees, he went over a summary of his skill increases for the past month\u2014a display he figured out how to create on his own. Knowledge: 2,150 to 2,165 Herbalism: 1,001 to 1,073 Prospecting: 500 to 628 Taxonomy: 1,001 to 1,111 Mining: 250 to 277 Staff: 32 to 288 Longsword: 0 to 199 Meditation: 160 to 235 Unarmed Combat: 1,004 to 1,164 Bamboo Steps: 199 to 212 Viper Steps: 199 to 216 International Politics: 0 to 24 Stringed Instrument - Lute: 0 to 49 All the practice with Ky had also leveled Ruwen\u2019s Shadow Step Grandmaster ranking from zero to seven. The three remaining levels centered on interpreting shadows and moving in and out of the Shadow Realm. Ruwen reread his latest Shadow Step Notifications. Shing! You have advanced a skill! Skill: Shadow Step Mastery Level: 162 Effect: Spiritual Damage increased by 1,620%. Ding! Congratulations, Shadow Grandmaster! Your rank has advanced to seven! Like a shadow, you are silent and dark. Ruwen only had another three levels until he reached the final rank of ten. Even though it usually took decades to reach rank ten, he hoped to do it in another month. Things were really going smoothly, and he smiled. It was nice for a change. \n CHAPTER 52 Ruwen stood beside Ky some three hundred feet into the forest. \u201cTry it without Harmonic Sight this time,\u201d Ky said. Ruwen knew this had been coming, but it still made his stomach clench with worry. With Harmonic Sight and Knowledge, he could see the tendrils of destruction, and making a connection with them was now trivial. \u201cListen, kid, even with the advantages this place has, the fact that it\u2019s only taken you a month to reach this point is nothing short of a miracle. There\u2019s no expectation that you\u2019ll succeed. I\u2019m immensely proud of you for what you\u2019ve already accomplished.\u201d That made Ruwen feel better, and he extended his senses. Even at night, patches of shadows existed\u2014inky blackness on the dark canvas of the forest floor. Ruwen knew better than to focus on the shadows. He knew that the fractures in the Material Realm that allowed the Destruction Realm to seep in could exist anywhere, although the most likely places existed in the shadows. If Ruwen summoned the Scarecrow Aspect, getting into the Destruction Realm became trivial. The aspect wanted to dive through the nearest fracture. Getting in wasn\u2019t the problem, usually, the hard part was getting out. It took ten seconds, but Ruwen discovered a spot six inches from his left foot that felt, for lack of a better term, thinner due to the destruction energy eating away at the Material Realm. Ruwen\u2019s first instinct was to mentally probe the area, but that was counterproductive as the Mental Energy usually collapsed the fracture. Instead, Ruwen offered it a rope created from Spirit\u2014which felt like someone rubbing glass across the inside of his soul-contaminated Core. Like a fish on a hook, the Destruction Realm latched on to the Spirit and yanked downward. This had caused some panic for Ruwen at first, but now he\u2019d gotten used to it. Instead of releasing the Spirit, he willed his body to follow. And just like that, Ruwen stood in the Destruction Realm. Harmonic Sight wasn\u2019t as useful in the Destruction Realm since all the notes were discordant, and violently resisted any type of organization. Ky had excellent control over her shadow, so it only appeared as a gray smudge. Nevertheless, Ruwen found it and forced another coil of spirit into the shadow. He made this rope much denser to counteract the Destruction Realm consuming it. When Ruwen sensed the rope entering the Material Realm, he used Ky\u2019s shadow like a fulcrum, wrapping the rope over it and allowing it to be swallowed once again by the Destruction Realm. It yanked Ruwen upward through Ky\u2019s shadow and back into the Material Realm. He only had a fraction of a second in the Material Realm before he\u2019d get jerked back into the Destruction Realm. After more than a week, Ruwen had finally sensed the brief moment where the constant hunger of the Destruction Realm decreased. If he didn\u2019t act immediately, he\u2019d get pulled right back into the Shadow Realm, which was usually what happened. Ruwen severed himself from the Spirit rope and, almost reluctantly, the Destruction Realm released its grip on him. He reappeared in the Material Realm and slammed face-first into the ground. \u201cDarkness take me,\u201d Ky said. \u201cYou actually did it.\u201d Ruwen remained face-first on the ground, his Core on fire. Lying with his face in the dirt didn\u2019t feel like much of a victory. He\u2019d hoped to act quickly enough to arrive on his feet in perfect position to attack Ky from behind. Ky knelt and placed her face on the ground next to Ruwen\u2019s. He smelled the peppermint from her favorite tea. \u201cBreak my dagger. You bested Dusk\u2019s time by six months. And she practiced constantly, not a handful of hours every night for a couple of weeks. The best part is we can work on the hard stuff now.\u201d \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the hard part?\u201d Ky laughed. \u201cNot landing on your face is the hard part.\u201d Ruwen groaned, which made Ky laugh harder. Three dots moved across the edge of Ruwen\u2019s map, which surprised him since he had toggled everything off. A moment later they disappeared, and he realized why. Their coins had given them away. Ruwen jumped to his feet. \u201cThree Muses just dropped into the Shadow Realm.\u201d Ky had gotten to her feet as well, and she bit her lip. Ruwen already knew Ky wouldn\u2019t want to risk leaving the boundary. \u201cLet\u2019s just see where they\u2019re headed or if they\u2019re meeting someone. We don\u2019t need to venture far.\u201d Ky, always decisive, gripped Ruwen\u2019s shoulder and in a blink, they stood in the Destruction Realm. She gave Ruwen directions. \u201cWelcome to your first lesson on Shadow Sliding. Keep your Will bottled up. You still wield it like a battering ram.\u201d Ruwen pushed the targets to Ky\u2019s map so she knew which way to go. \u201cI know you\u2019re impatient to follow but listen for ten seconds. Not everyone can bend the entire visible area to their Will like you can. Most of us need to use the existing geography, especially if moving quickly.\u201d Ruwen gave a short nod to let Ky know he understood. \u201cLash yourself to me and then observe what I do. It won\u2019t be as smooth as normal because I\u2019m not used to pulling a passenger.\u201d Ruwen immediately created a Spirit rope, which he looped around Ky and back to himself. The soul contamination actually helped in this situation as the Destruction Realm took far longer to consume the fragments of Soul Power which added strength and durability to his rope. Ky didn\u2019t bother to check if Ruwen had followed orders\u2014he\u2019d learned early on to obey everything she said while in this dangerous realm. For the next twenty seconds, Ruwen couldn\u2019t speak as Ky propelled them at incredible speed toward the retreating Muses. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ky asked. Ruwen wondered if this is how Sift felt while flying because that\u2019s exactly what it felt like, except your feet never left the surface. Ky launched bands of Soul Energy which latched onto whatever they struck. She then pulled herself forward while launching another band from her other hand. When they gained too much height, or the ground suddenly dropped away, a consequence of the odd geography, she launched bands from her feet to pull them back to the surface. Ruwen knew immense practice went into this fluid dash across the realm. The bands that Ky used were exactly the length and durability required. She utilized a shifting pushing motion with her feet, and he guessed this sped them up as well. Exhilarating was an understatement. \u201cI\u2019m coating half my foot with tiny amounts of Soul Power. It causes damage to the Shadow Realm, so the realm pulls away on contact. This results in a very slick, frictionless surface.\u201d Ruwen studied Ky\u2019s technique for a few seconds before she continued. \u201cSo I push off with the uncoated side as I pull forward with my arms, then I glide with the slick side of the same foot and repeat the process on the other foot.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re amazing at this.\u201d \u201cThanks. It\u2019s one of a few things in this realm that I classify as fun, so I like to practice.\u201d The three dots representing the Muses disappeared from the map once again. \u201cI saw it,\u201d Ky said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there in forty seconds.\u201d When they arrived, Ruwen had already guessed what had happened. In front of them, a chasm opened. The Funnel. \u201cWe can\u2019t go in there,\u201d Ky said firmly. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cI uncovered one of these when I used my Will for the first time.\u201d \u201cThe boundary that Shadow Steppers use is like the lid on a barrel.\u201d Ky paused, likely weighing how much to tell Ruwen. Thankfully, she decided to continue. \u201cThe real Destruction Realm is perpendicular to this lid. Funnels like this are entrances into that area, and the strength of the destruction vastly increases the further you travel down. We only know this because the Gloom Stalker Wardens have told us.\u201d Ruwen tried to see into the chasm, but his vision failed, or maybe something obscured everything past two hundred feet. \u201cDusk knew a Shadow Stepper who entered the Funnel, but he never returned. It\u2019s death.\u201d Ruwen knew better than to argue, and chasing the Muses into such a place unprepared didn\u2019t make sense. \u201cThe Gloom Stalkers made it clear that if this place breaks through your defenses and enters your body, there\u2019s no saving you. The Shadow Realm will make you one of its own. You\u2019ll live out the rest of your days as a mindless shadow creature.\u201d Ruwen remembered what the dark priest had done to the two Archangels that had accompanied Miranda and Pen to that first dark chapel. When Lalquinrial had set the trap for Ruwen on Nymthus\u2019 planet, half the god\u2019s body had appeared contaminated. That meant Ky didn\u2019t have all the facts because the Infernal Lord had found a way to stop, or at least slow, the contamination process. \u201cI understand,\u201d Ruwen said, knowing the only thing he could do right now was to agree. \u201cIt\u2019s past time that I have a heart-to-heart with the Muses and find out what\u2019s going on here. Seeing this just confirms that it\u2019s nothing good.\u201d Ky gave Ruwen a look of approval. \u201cOkay, unleash yourself, and we\u2019ll practice your Shadow Sliding on the way back. Don\u2019t bother with the slick feet\u2014that\u2019s an advanced technique and will only slow you down right now.\u201d Ruwen let the Spirit rope attached to Ky dissolve, and he watched it move to the chasm and disappear over the edge. Turning back toward camp, Ruwen launched a band much thicker than Ky used at a jagged rock that had just risen out of the ground. He pulled himself forward with a grin. \n CHAPTER 53 Ky and Ruwen ended their Shadow Step practice when they arrived back at camp so he could confront the Muses. Sadness filled Ruwen, because he knew that the coming escalation would end his glorious training vacation, and the more typical life-threatening dangers would return. Ruwen\u2019s successful Shadow Step into and out of the Destruction Realm earlier that night completed the last of the four remaining quests in the cultivation stage quest line that he\u2019d gotten so long ago from the Addas. Ting! You have completed the Quest \u2013 Phantom Field Trip Cultivation Stage Step: Astral Project Self in Current Realm Cultivation Stage Reward: +2 Cultivation Stage Level: 84 Ting! You have completed the Quest \u2013 Realm Rover Cultivation Stage Step: Astral Project Self into Different Realm Cultivation Stage Reward: +3 Cultivation Stage Level: 87 Ting! You have completed the Quest \u2013 Fast Lane Cultivation Stage Step: Translocate Self in Current Realm Cultivation Stage Reward: +5 Cultivation Stage Level: 92 Ting! You have completed the Quest \u2013 Dimensional Bouncer Cultivation Stage Step: Translocate Self into Different Realm Cultivation Stage Reward: +8 Cultivation Stage Level: 100 The extra eighteen points in Cultivation Stage would improve his Resilience, which went into all his Resistances, and, more importantly, would improve his Perception. Plus, it felt great to finally finish off that quest line. Ruwen had gotten help and advice for these final quests from all the other cultivators at camp. Chip and Stump seemed to do it more innately as their descriptions of how to do it involved a lot of drinking. Madda and Padda were more helpful, but their advice veered into a more mystical route, talking of attuning oneself to the world and matching universal vibrations, which did sound a lot like Harmony to Ruwen, but he couldn\u2019t make the connection. To Ruwen\u2019s surprise, it had been Xavier who had given him the breakthrough. Ruwen had been complaining to Tremine about the lack of concrete methods when the Celestial Remnant had made the point that it sounded like dimensional warping without the manifestation of a portal. That simple observation had been exactly what Ruwen needed. As his confidence and experience with portals increased, so did his ability with the last cultivation stage quests. Ruwen, while not a master at creating portals, had become proficient. He preferred using them as they didn\u2019t require any Spirit, only an understanding of how to manipulate the surrounding dimensional space. With a loud sigh, Ruwen looked around the camp one more time. He hoped he\u2019d get a chance to do something like this again. Then he created a portal to the Muses\u2019 courtyard and stepped through. Ruwen wore his Black Pyramid Grandmaster Alchemy robe and had pulled the hood forward but not worn a mask. Only three of the Muses sat on their thrones. To the Grandmasters in the camps below, it appeared that the Muses cared so much about the alchemists\u2019 progress that the deities never left the courtyard, but Ruwen had known from the beginning that Divine clones sat in these thrones while the gods amused themselves somewhere else. It spoke to the arrogance of the Grandmasters that they believed nine deities would sit around for months waiting for the alchemists to finish. Ruwen disintegrated the clones with a burst of Mental energy. Clones of this quality required a lot of time and resources, so he expected to get noticed immediately. Within seconds, Diantheon appeared, followed by Asterion to the god\u2019s right and Elysia to his left. Diantheon\u2019s dark skin no longer contained tiny stars, and his hair had lost its silver streaks. Asterion appeared younger, his skin not so parchment-like, although he still had silver hair it lacked the bronze streaks. Keeping with the theme, Elysia had lost her translucence, although she still shimmered. The Muses were all intelligent and wise, and Diantheon acted with caution. Instead of immediately attacking an unknown opponent, he chose dialogue. \u201cWho are you?\u201d Diantheon asked. \u201cThe only deities dumb enough to insult us like this could have never passed for a Grandmaster Alchemist.\u201d \u201cMaybe I\u2019m someone you don\u2019t know then,\u201d Ruwen replied. \u201cPlease explain the missing three as well as the additional three that just disappeared in the Shadow Realm.\u201d Asterion chuckled softly. \u201cYou really know how to dig yourself a hole.\u201d Ruwen nodded to the god. \u201cVery perceptive. I did indeed start my journey as a Worker and do, in fact, know how to dig a hole.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t mock me,\u201d Asterion hissed. \u201cYou sound like you\u2019re twelve.\u201d \u201cWow, that is close enough to the truth that it makes me uncomfortable.\u201d \u201cYou like to play games, do you?\u201d Diantheon asked. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear how you explain such foolish actions. Who could possibly back you that you show us such disrespect?\u201d \u201cNo disrespect intended. I only want the truth, so I\u2019ll ask again: what are you doing in the Shadow Realm?\u201d \u201cYou are expelled from this competition,\u201d Diantheon said, \u201cand your leaderboard positions are revoked. Leave immediately and take your motley group with you.\u201d Ruwen had already pieced together some of the Muses\u2019 actions. \u201cReturn the potions my Chapter provided you, and we will leave.\u201d As Ruwen had expected, the three Muses looked at each other, unsure how to respond. \u201cThe potions you submitted are the property of the Muses and do not belong to you,\u201d Diantheon finally replied. \u201cYou no longer have them,\u201d Ruwen stated. Elysia shook her head and waved at Ruwen as if brushing crumbs off a table. The marble pavers in a twenty-foot circle shattered as an immense force pressed down on him. Ruwen, unaffected, held his ground inside his Divine Domain and triggered Harmonic Sight and Knowledge. He didn\u2019t respond to Elysia\u2019s attack, instead studying the tones, chords, and harmonies that surrounded the deities. All three Muses spread their wings, much more guarded as Elysia\u2019s attack would have crushed a Gem level cultivator. They now knew without any doubts that they faced a Divine tier Cultivator. Elysia\u2019s wings reminded Ruwen of a butterfly\u2019s, Asterion\u2019s shifted like smoke, and Diantheon\u2019s like a mass of intertwined vines. Diantheon launched a jet of compressed air at Ruwen\u2019s hood, clearly hoping to blow it back and reveal his face, but Ruwen unwound the dense Harmony of the spell. While the columns behind Ruwen toppled from the impact, his robe didn\u2019t even flutter. Ruwen didn\u2019t bother tapping into the Muses\u2019 linked communication as he\u2019d already predicted their actions. When all three Muses triggered their emergency recalls, Ruwen\u2019s nullification chords shattered the spells like spears breaking mirrors. Ruwen waited patiently while the three puzzled out why their spells failed. One failing might be bad luck, but all three could only mean they\u2019d been stopped on purpose. \u201cYou have sealed your own death,\u201d Diantheon said, as if his emergency recall had not just failed. \u201cExpose your identity and leave and your punishment will be light. Further attacks will only bring the might of every deity upon yourself.\u201d \u201cFurther attacks?\u201d Ruwen asked. \u201cI\u2019ve restrained myself from violence, but my patience wears thin. I will ask one last time: what are you doing in the Shadow Realm?\u201d Diantheon took a step forward and pointed a finger at Ruwen. \u201cWe are the nine Muses, and we answer to no one. What right do you have to ask us anything?\u201d Ruwen dropped a ten-edged coin into his left hand. One side depicted an intricately etched tree, its branches full of leaves made from scrolls. The other side had nine planets arranged in a perfect circle around a large central star. Ruwen flicked the coin with his thumb, and it tumbled through the air before dropping a foot in front of Diantheon. He projected the coin\u2019s description in a massive thirty-foot display between himself and the three Muses. Name: Emblem of Superior Knowledge Uses: Exerts the authority of the Tenth Muse. Description: Nine Emblems of Knowledge created in desperation, each a marker signifying hope for the future and granted to nine champions\u2014nine Muses. One emblem created in secret, a marker signifying caution for the future and granted to a champion\u2014the Tenth Muse. Nine Muses to protect what was lost, one Muse to shepherd them and, in the light, set them free. \u201cWhat right do I have to ask you anything?\u201d Ruwen asked, repeating Diantheon\u2019s question. Ruwen spread his arms wide. \u201cI am the Tenth Muse.\u201d Ruwen exerted his authority through the coin and the three Muses trembled in fear. \n CHAPTER 54 Diantheon failed to form words for a full five seconds. \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d Ruwen strode forward. The display dispersed as he walked through it. \u201cI thought it self-explanatory,\u201d Ruwen replied. \u201cAs Muses, you are required to recognize my authority and obey my commands. Now, what are you doing in the Shadow Realm?\u201d Pain racked all three deities, and Ruwen studied them for ten seconds. \u201cThere are two solutions to this. Tell me what I wish to know or abdicate your position as a Muse.\u201d Desire for relief warred with pride inside the Muses. It took another five seconds for them to choose. They would never give up their power willingly. \u201cThe missing Muses were taken by the Shadow Realm,\u201d Diantheon blurted. The Muses\u2019 faces relaxed as the pain disappeared. \u201cAnd?\u201d Ruwen asked. Diantheon continued, \u201cThe Grandmaster Alchemist quests were to save them. The three you witnessed in the Shadow Realm just now are using your potions as they journey to save the three that were taken.\u201d Ruwen doubted the original three Muses had survived the power of the Destruction Realm. And even if they had, it didn\u2019t explain the primary quest, which was immunity to Soul Energy\u2014something a Muse would not require. Just the opposite. Diantheon and the other two Muses had complete control of their Divine bodies, making detecting lies difficult as deities rarely displayed the micro gestures that made normal people so easy to read. \u201cWhy did the original three enter the Shadow Realm?\u201d The Muses looked at each other, and Ruwen used his power as the Tenth Muse to gently pull on the markers that gave them the authority of a Muse. \u201cWe learned the secret,\u201d Diantheon said. He pressed his lips together as if his mouth didn\u2019t want the secret to pass. \u201cSome of us took an interest in the lifecycle of magic,\u201d Diantheon said. \u201cTracing magic into the Shadow Realm was trivial. Following the magic\u2019s path to its eventual destination proved far more difficult, so we struck a deal with a Shadow Realm creature.\u201d Ruwen could guess the rest, but he let Diantheon continue. \u201cFour accompanied this creature to the very bottom of the Shadow Realm.\u201d Diantheon gestured at Elysia. \u201cOnly Elysia returned, along with a message to not betray the shadow realm. The other three are held in the depths of the Shadow Realm as hostages. We fear for their safety.\u201d Ruwen remained silent as he considered Diantheon\u2019s words. Diantheon took the silence as an accusation and jumped to his own defense. \u201cWe only wanted to return what the Darkness took from our universe. All our plans were for the greater good.\u201d Ruwen highly doubted that. \u201cAnd your peers who just entered the Shadow Realm?\u201d \u201cWe ran out of time,\u201d Diantheon said. \u201cYour potions surpassed our needs, so we made arrangements for safe passage to rescue the other Muses.\u201d \u201cAnd they have the potions we entrusted to you,\u201d Ruwen stated. Diantheon nodded. Ruwen reached out to Rami. Rami, I need some help. I\u2019m going to open a small portal behind my back. Please come in your natural form and stay hidden. Ruwen expanded his map\u2019s view until Rami\u2019s location became visible. Using his new proficiency, he created a dimensional tunnel between himself and Rami. Two seconds later, Rami crawled behind Ruwen\u2019s left ear. The woman on the right is named Elysia, and she has memories of a place deep in the Destruction Realm. Can you try and find them, please? Give me a second and keep them talking. A distraction would help as well. Okay, I already know a question they won\u2019t want to answer, and it will give me an excuse to yank on their Muse coins, which will momentarily panic them. Perfect. \u201cIf you\u2019ve spent time in the Shadow Realm,\u201d Ruwen said, \u201cyou know our only weapon against those creatures is Soul Power. So why are you delivering a potion to remove that advantage?\u201d Once again, Diantheon responded defensively. \u201cSome of those ingredients are unknown to any of us, which makes it an acceptable chance that the Shadow Realm is also unaware. Even with the potion, and assuming they have the expertise, they won\u2019t have the ingredients to make more.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a risky assumption when the consequences might prove catastrophic. You\u2019ve given a shark lungs, arms, and legs. None of that changes its nature, and when it finds itself on land, it will do as sharks do.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s only one potion,\u201d Diantheon said. \u201cWith the faintest scent, I can break down a potion\u2019s ingredients and likely construction. Thousands of variations and substitutes will filter through my thoughts. The cleverest thing about that potion is the concept behind it, and you\u2019re handing it to a creature whose nature is destruction. Do you really believe only our realm has Grandmaster alchemists? I don\u2019t. You\u2019ve provided a possible enemy with a powerful shield.\u201d Asterion and Elysia showed a fraction of doubt, but Diantheon stood firm. \u201cProgress can only be made by working with your enemies,\u201d Diantheon said. \u201cHow can peace be achieved without dialogue?\u201d Ruwen shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. They\u2019re created for a purpose, and their motivations differ from ours. You want peace and dialogue. They crave complete and utter domination.\u201d \u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Diantheon said. \u201cYou have taken a simple potion and spun it into something of universal importance. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Get ready, Ruwen told Rami. \u201cTell me about the Shadow Realm creature you made this deal with.\u201d As he expected, the Muses couldn\u2019t hide their discomfort. \u201cThe name is misleading,\u201d Diantheon said. \u201cIt gives the wrong impression.\u201d Here we go, Ruwen warned Rami. Ruwen used the power of the Tenth Muse to yank on the coins of the three Muses before him. To his surprise, Diantheon, Elysia, and Asterion didn\u2019t resist him this time. As the three coins raced toward Ruwen\u2019s hand, a powerful surge of energy triggered a thousand feet to his left, from one of the Muses\u2019 houses. Ruwen pushed the coins back to the three Muses in case the surge of energy targeted those coins. The Muses recovered without any fear, and the power surge faded. \u201cSome type of failsafe?\u201d Ruwen asked. Diantheon smirked. \u201cNot so smart now, are you?\u201d Ruwen pieced together the most logical explanation before responding to Diantheon. \u201cIf too many Muses lose their coins at the same time, some type of protection activates. What do you have that needs such protection?\u201d Ruwen had already figured out the answer as he finished the question. The Muses safeguarded two places: The archive where the knowledge of the nine most advanced planets existed, as a protection against loss to the Darkness. And the Mechanism, a storehouse of powerful items and advanced alchemical projects. Did you get what we need? Ruwen asked Rami. Yes, and it\u2019s not good. In case there were traps or further safeguards, Ruwen brought the three Muses along as he dimensionally warped the short distance between himself and the power surge. Before Ruwen had even regained his bearings, the air vibrated as Rami activated her Superior Telescopic Touch, which inspected and consumed all the objects in a thousand-foot sphere. A fraction of a second later, Ruwen understood. Ruwen stood in the center of a small library. Three tables sat nearby, and he slowly turned to study the building. Simple stone walls held stained glass windows of abstract designs that filtered the sunlight into a kaleidoscope of colors that covered the granite floor. Narrow aisles overflowed with ancient scrolls and books bound in strange hides. Runes shimmered softly across many of the books, and the faint scent of lavender and old parchment reminded Ruwen of the library at Deepwell. This looks impressive, Rami said, but it\u2019s all for show. Anything visible is common knowledge, and all the scrolls and books are written in ancient languages to hide the fact it\u2019s all gibberish. Diantheon, Elysia, and Asterion stood silently with satisfied smiles. \u201cExplain this,\u201d Ruwen said to Diantheon. \u201cThis is the only entrance to our sacred collections. Thankfully, despite the suspicious coin you carry, the safeguards will keep you out.\u201d Ruwen detected the hint of uncertainty in Diantheon\u2019s words and strode down an unremarkable aisle. Ruwen stopped in front of a stained-glass window that looked identical to the others. He removed his Grandmaster\u2019s robe, not wanting an accident to destroy it. Waving his hand, he dismissed the illusion of stained glass, revealing the bright portal. The destruction of the illusion released a small burst of energy that scattered the loosely bound sheets that littered the shelves. Raising the marker of the Tenth Muse, Ruwen approached the portal. The closer he came, the harder it became as the portal resisted him despite his coin. The portal ignored his attempts to command or will it open. Ruwen used Harmony to probe the shield. He could break the protection but worried it would collapse the dimensional bridge, which he didn\u2019t want to risk unless he didn\u2019t have any other options. The three Muses\u2019 heartbeats behind Ruwen steadied as they realized he couldn\u2019t break the seal. \u201cNow what\u2019s your plan?\u201d Diantheon asked. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long before our allies, which include all the deities, arrive here to defend us. You are dead.\u201d Without turning, Ruwen spoke. \u201cHow do I open the portal?\u201d \u201cTorture us if you wish,\u201d Diantheon responded. \u201cWe can hold out until help arrives. You\u2019re an idiot if you think we\u2019ll tell you how to open that portal. It wouldn\u2019t do you any good anyway.\u201d \u201cHow do I open the portal?\u201d Ruwen asked again. Diantheon laughed. \u201cWhen our friends arrive, they will force the identity of the god who fuels your misplaced confidence. You will both suffer for your actions today.\u201d Ruwen sighed and slowly turned. For the first time, he faced the Muses without anything to mask his identity. The Muses displayed obvious confusion as they took in his youth\u2014something even Divine Fortification couldn\u2019t fake. Diantheon realized Ruwen\u2019s identity first, and he stumbled backward. \u201cThe Godkiller,\u201d he whispered. The name triggered recognition in the other two Muses, and they stepped backward as well. \u201cI am the source of my misplaced confidence. Do you think any of your friends will help you now?\u201d Diantheon\u2019s recognition turned to fear, and he shook his head and then bowed for good measure. \u201cI know they won\u2019t. Why didn\u2019t you reveal yourself to begin with? We could have avoided this misunderstanding.\u201d \u201cMy identity is a hammer. Should we, the men and women who are tasked with the sacred duty of safeguarding knowledge, hold books or hammers?\u201d All three Muses knelt and bowed their heads. \u201cYou\u2019ve failed in your duty as Muses, and I\u2019ll deal with you once I\u2019ve rectified the terrible mistakes you\u2019ve made here. In my absence, consider how you might reach your noble purpose again.\u201d Ruwen paused and let the words sink in to the now-silent Muses. \u201cNow tell me how to open this portal.\u201d Diantheon responded, his voice far more humble. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but the safeguard was constructed by a rare instance of cooperation between Ink Lords and can only be lifted by one of their conclaves.\u201d \u201cA conclave?\u201d Ruwen asked, shocked by the unexpected answer. \u201cYes,\u201d Diantheon responded. \u201cAnd convincing an Ink Lord to trigger a conclave will be impossible.\u201d \u201cWhy is that?\u201d Ruwen asked. Diantheon looked up, and the other two Muses mirrored him. \u201cBecause of the risks,\u201d Diantheon said, trying to hide his confusion over Ruwen\u2019s ignorance. \u201cI\u2019m not that familiar with Ink Lords. Please enlighten me.\u201d Diantheon responded immediately. \u201cA conclave is the most dangerous time for an Ink Lord. It forces them into the open and makes them susceptible to assassination. The previous ten conclaves have resulted in terrible bloodshed.\u201d \u201cInteresting,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cThe danger is why no Ink Lord will help us?\u201d \u201cNot just danger, but certain death. Without exception, the Ink Lord that calls for the conclave is assassinated. Usually before the conclave even starts.\u201d \u201cHow long between the call and the actual conclave?\u201d \u201cThirty days.\u201d Ruwen focused on Rami. Is the Archive and Mechanism worth risking our lives to enter? Our lives are always in danger, but honestly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m objective enough to answer that question. Your mom made a big deal about getting into that Mechanism repository and acquiring that alchemy item. There\u2019s probably a lot of other awesome stuff in there. Plus, who knows what\u2019s in that archive. Technically, you could call the conclave, and then we could keep a really low profile until it\u2019s over. Then enter the Archive and Mechanism based on your authority as the Tenth Muse. It\u2019s actually safer than trying to sneak past a bunch of Ink Lords to reach the Archive. That\u2019s a great point. I\u2019m forcing myself to say this, but the two of us aren\u2019t exactly neutral, and we might be enabling each other\u2019s behavior. How many ways are there to call a conclave? I have three sources that say specific events need to occur. Diantheon wasn\u2019t lying when he said Ink Lords do not like to meet. Hey, I still have Izac\u2019s Ink Lord, Numarrow, in my inventory. You\u2019re still carrying around that dead body? Yes. Don\u2019t tell Sift. Maybe we can use him somehow. I don\u2019t think so, Rami said. Technically, he\u2019s not an Ink Lord anymore, although only you and I know that. You took his emblem, remember? Yeah, that\u2019s true. The three Muses had respectfully remained silent, assuming Ruwen was dealing with the terrible news of this impossible situation. Ruwen turned from the Muses and swapped his Tenth Muse marker with a coin stored in his Inventory. He strode back to the portal, summoning his Ink Lord wraps as he did. The coin depicted a black dragon coiled on itself, and the wings created the walls of a pyramid. Ruwen recalled the description: Name: Ink Lord Emblem of Dominion Type: Item (Magic) Properties: Decorative Uses: Authorizes attendance to Ink Lord Conclaves and permits access to the Nine Muses\u2019 Archive. I\u2019m not going to let a group of homicidal librarians keep me from accessing these repositories. I was hoping you\u2019d say that, Rami responded. Ruwen held the Ink Lord Emblem of Dominion toward the locked portal and spoke loudly. \u201cI, Ruwen Starfield, Ink Lord of the Black Pyramid, summon all Ink Lords to the Eleventh Conclave.\u201d A timer appeared near his map, and it began to count down from thirty days. Concentrating on the timer gave him the gate runes for this location. \n CHAPTER 55 Ruwen left the Muses with a warning to stick around. They confirmed that they\u2019d focus on preparing for the conclave, which would start at the library. Dismissing his Ink Wraps, Ruwen Blinked to his mostly unused room in the barracks of his fortress. He sat on his cot and Rami took her human form, sitting beside him. \"OK, let's have that memory,\" Ruwen said. A brief moment of vertigo later, Ruwen entered Elysia\u2019s memories. Elysia squeezed the talisman that protected her from the voracious Destruction Essence, thankful, despite her terror, that the Havoc Sovereign had provided her such a shield. She avoided looking at her three longtime peers who, despite their Divine bodies, died quickly when this realm consumed them, leaving behind deformed husks and black vacant eyes. Elysia stood at the edge of a massive lake of roiling energy that lapped ominously at her feet. The air buzzed with tension and smelled sharp and burnt as if an invisible lightning storm raged nearby. In the distance, an island loomed, hosting five distinct towers. One spiraled skyward like a twisted shard of crystal, its translucent walls shimmering with a pale ethereal light. Her Divine hearing detected a howling wind swirling around the tower. Next to it, a warped stone tower loomed with thorn-like spikes that pulsed with a mixture of colors. A startling sight against the backdrop of the greys and blacks that made up the rest of the realm. The air around it warped and twisted, distorting Elysia's vision and sending a shiver down her spine. Just watching the tower tugged at the edges of her mind, threatening to unravel it. Elysia quickly moved her attention to the next pillar. It appeared more traditional, although the dark stones of its construction were scorched and glowed with deep reds and oranges. Waves of intense heat warped the air. Even from this distance, she cringed from the acrid scent of sulfur. Fine particles of ash fell around the tower like snow. Cloaked in shadows, the next tower pierced the sky like a spear of obsidian, absorbing all light around it. It stood cold, silent, and oppressive. Shadows fell from it like dark waterfalls. Instead of stones, the last tower was constructed of bones adorned with carvings, strange symbols that Elysia couldn't decipher. She detected the faint, sickly sweet odor of decay that made her stomach turn with primal dread. Looking at the towers for too long made some of her Meridians, two of which were not even connected to her center, swell, and she feared they might burst. Elysia tore her eyes from the towers and she focused on the confusing information her Reveal spell had provided about the creature looming over her. Class: Havoc Sovereign Race: Necrolite Tower: Dark Order of Succession: 0 (acting Sovereign) What did race mean? Were there actual different types of people in this horrible place? And did the tower in the description mean one of those towers on the island? Elysia glanced up at the Necrolite. It had a ghostly translucent body with faint swirling shadows within. The Havoc Sovereign wore a solemn expression on its elongated skeletal face. Its milky white eyes, devoid of pupils, burned her mind with their focused intensity. It moved with eerie silence as it paced, floating just above the ground. \"If you're lying, I'll find you and feed you to your friends,\" the Havoc Sovereign said with a nod to the husks who had, until recently, been revered Muses. Elysia swallowed hard, her mouth dry from terror. \"I won't fail. We'll provide you the immunity you seek.\" She closed her eyes, using all the power of a goddess to push the fear away long enough to utter the next sentence. \"And you promise to provide a conduit to this power for us?\" \"That's the deal,\" the Havoc Sovereign replied. As the memory ended, Ruwen tried to unpack the dense amount of information. Those towers, the ocean of power, and a very disturbing Notification\u2014all of it pointed to some uncomfortable truths. \"When I fought those shadow wolves, I saw a creature at the back that seemed different, but Ky wouldn't let me follow it into the Funnel. It had a race as well.\" \"You know what that means, right?\" \"That the Destruction Realm is not just filled with wolves and rats and general creatures but enough races that it\u2019s detailed in Notifications. And races mean a civilization and social structures. How can something like that exist secretly for so long?\" \"You felt the strength of the destruction power at what I'm going to assume is the bottom of the Funnel. Elysia couldn't comprehend it. It's highly unlikely anyone who ventured very deep survived. Even your Step Clan, with their shadow expertise, only travels the boundary between realms. Looking at it from that perspective, it doesn't seem hard to believe at all.\" Ruwen sighed. \"You know what we need to do.\" \"Yes,\" Rami said quietly. \"I'll be right back,\" Ruwen said as he stood and exited his room. Thirty seconds later, Ruwen returned with Hamma, and she sat next to Rami on the bed. \"Now I know this isn't good,\" Hamma said. Overlord, Uruziel, and Sivart, could you join us? Ruwen grimaced as the three appeared. The small room had become very crowded, but he didn't think this meeting would take long, so he didn\u2019t bother moving them to the common area. Ruwen explained what had occurred with the Muses so Hamma would understand the context of what he planned on proposing. Then Rami gave everyone Elysia's memory. \"So you plan on going after the potions?\" Hamma asked. \"Yes,\" Ruwen responded. \"I can't risk the Destruction Realm gaining access to even a poorly concocted Soul Power immunity potion.\" Hamma shivered. \"How will you survive reaching that lake? Do you have one of those tokens?\" \"Unfortunately, no on the token. I'm counting on my Mental strength and Willpower to keep me safe, and we've discovered Rami is naturally resistant to the realm's effects.\" \"I know I\u2019d only burden you in an environment like that, but what about Lylan? Shouldn't her regeneration keep her safe?\" \"Her body, probably yes, but I'm far less sure about her mind. The creatures there use Will as a weapon, and if her regeneration runs out or can't keep up\u2026 you saw in Elysia's memory what happens. I couldn't live with myself. And Sift would kill me.\" \"Speaking of Sift...\" \"He won't survive. His Soul Power is a fantastic weapon and an above-average shield in that realm, but the destruction power will still consume it.\" Hamma nodded her understanding and gestured at the three others in the room. \"But they'll help you.\" Ruwen locked gazes with Overlord, and after three seconds, Overlord turned his attention to Hamma. \"As durable as we can make these Minions, they\u2019re still created from Spirit, and the Destruction Realm moves through Spirit like a fire through dry grass. At least near that lake, we\u2019ll be useless on the outside.\" Hamma bit her lip. \"What about Ky? She has shadow training.\" \"Shadow Steppers never leave the boundary between realms. She\u2019d be defenseless as soon as we left it.\" Hamma remained quiet for five seconds before looking up at Ruwen. \"Is there anything I can do to help before you leave?\" Love and appreciation filled Ruwen. The interaction reminded him how much Hamma had grown and matured these past couple of years. She didn't need him to justify his plans or require unreasonable promises. She trusted him. As Ruwen struggled to make progress with Conceptual magic, he spent considerable time reflecting on his own motivations and behavior. While he\u2019d almost always attempted to explain or justify his behavior to his friends when he planned to do something dumb or dangerous, he\u2019d done less well at showing his appreciation, even though he felt that way a lot. Ruwen stepped forward and pulled Hamma to her feet before wrapping her in a hug. \"Thank you for offering.\" Releasing Hamma, Ruwen took a half step back and placed his hands on her shoulders. \"First, I love you. Second, I'll be back before you know it. Third, just in case I get delayed, you should know I kind of triggered an Ink Lord conclave that will happen here in a month. I'll create a more permanent door back to the Third Temple so people can travel back-and-forth to Grave while I'm gone. It might be worthwhile to speak with Blapy and get her thoughts on how long it will remain safe for everyone to stay here.\" Hamma nodded her understanding. \"I love you, Ruwen Starfield,\" she whispered and gave him a kiss. Hamma stepped back and turned serious. A small black box appeared in her right hand, and she carefully opened it. Inside, it held what looked like a cologne bottle to Ruwen. Hamma carefully removed the tiny bottle and placed the box on the bed. With gentle movements, she undid the top. Ruwen's suspicion was verified as the smell of a pine forest mixed with the clean scent of a mountain stream filled the room. Ruwen knew how much Hamma loved scents, and he never argued about them as he knew they made her happy, but this seemed like an odd time to give him cologne. Then, Ruwen realized that he hadn\u2019t automatically deconstructed the scents into a recipe, which had never happened since he\u2019d become a Grandmaster Alchemist. \"I've been experimenting with my magic,\" Hamma said. \"I wasn't ready to show you yet, but it might be the only way I can help.\" A hundred questions jumped into Ruwen's mind, but Hamma's solemn expression kept him silent. Hamma placed her index finger over the top of the bottle and reverently inverted the cologne. Then she held up her right arm, extending her glistening index and middle fingers over Ruwen's head. Now that the scents were closer, Ruwen could smell more subtle things\u2014things Hamma loved. Faint and hidden under the woodsy scent: lavender, vanilla, and rosemary. Ruwen understood why he'd had such a hard time with the recipe. This cologne contained at least one of the vials of luck he'd given Hamma. Ruwen sucked in a shocked breath, planning to remind Hamma his own luck potions wouldn't work on him, but before he could tell her, Hamma spoke. \u201cHer favor on your plans, her light across your path, her mercy in your heart,\u201d Hamma chanted. With the extended fingers, she touched her heart, mouth, and forehead. Hamma kissed her fingers and gently touched Ruwen's forehead. For a moment, the scents became overpowering, then they quickly faded until Ruwen could barely detect them. His skin prickled and, to his surprise, a buff appeared. Ruwen kissed his own two fingers and touched his heart, mouth, and forehead, and then bowed. \u201cThank you, Priestess.\u201d Hamma suddenly turned nervous. \"Did it work?\" Ruwen looked at the buff's details. Name: Blessing of Sacrificial Luck Quality: Unknown Effect: Unknown Description: A woodsy cologne containing hints of softer scents. When applied by a Priestess, this cologne has unusual properties. It was just like Hamma to sacrifice something beyond value, like one of the luck potions he\u2019d given her, to try and make something to benefit him. \"Well?\" Hamma asked. \"The buff\u2019s name is Blessing of Sacrificial Luck, but the quality and effect are unknown. What were you going for?\" Hamma frowned. \"I was trying to make your luck useful to you by creating something that allows you to swap the cologne\u2019s luck, which is made from your luck, with someone else\u2019s luck. I was hoping the luck you swapped for would be available for you to use.\" Ruwen hugged Hamma again. \"That was incredibly clever. Thank you for trying to work around the restriction. I hope someday you\u2019ll stop sacrificing everything and do something to benefit yourself.\" \"Maybe someday,\" Hamma responded. \"I\u2019ll let you know if any details change. Maybe once I interact with an enemy, it will become clear.\" \"I hope so.\" Ruwen stepped away from Hamma and looked at Rami, who still sat on the bed. \"Do you need to talk to Xavier?\" \"I already did. I\u2019m good to go.\" Ruwen snapped his fingers. \"I almost forgot the most important thing.\" Hamma looked at Ruwen expectantly. \"Don\u2019t let Sift eat my desserts from Findley. Save them for me.\" Hamma slowly shook her head, her expression disbelieving. \"I know, right? I can\u2019t believe I almost forgot.\" \"I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re joking.\" \"Some things are too serious to joke about.\" \n CHAPTER 56 Ruwen stood at the edge of the Funnel, the Scarecrow Aspect thirsty to plunge into the opening. The Void Band didn\u2019t work here, so before entering the Destruction Realm, Ruwen had placed the two drawings from Blapy in his pockets and placed a borrowed cask of soul alcohol into his Apocalypse Hoop. Pen's sword already consumed a spot, leaving him three empty slots if he came across anything interesting that he wanted to keep. Despite the Scarecrow Aspect being active, Rami curled behind Ruwen\u2019s ear, able to see and pass through the aspect like it wasn't there. Are you ready? Ruwen asked Rami. No, but waiting isn't going to help, so let's go. Ruwen stepped over the edge and fell forward. To his shock, his foot didn\u2019t encounter empty air, but landed on a solid surface. Vertigo turned his stomach as he processed this new orientation. That was weird, Rami said. Ruwen glanced around. To all appearances, he stood on a vast plain. He turned around and encountered another apparent cliff, which undoubtably would shift him ninety degrees and back onto the boundary between the realms. It was like a real funnel, where the top pressed against the bottom of the universe. But the boundary of the Destruction Realm was incredibly narrow\u2014or maybe a better word was thin\u2014and stepping into the Funnel portion placed him in the actual realm, which existed perpendicular to the Material Realm. For the first time, Ruwen's Mental Energy bar visibly ticked down before his Mental Regeneration refilled it. How are you doing? Ruwen asked. I feel pressure now, like I jumped in a pool, but it's just noticeable, not an issue. How about you? I don't feel much different, but that's because my mind is automatically resisting the realm. What's more concerning is I\u2019m actively stopping the Scarecrow Aspect from pulling us forward. For some reason, it desperately wants to rush forward. No offense to your Shadow Sliding, but that aspect is obviously related to this realm, somehow, and perhaps it knows a better way to travel. We have no idea how far that lake and those towers are from here. Ruwen rubbed his chest, which did nothing for the burning in his Core. He thought about using Vex but didn\u2019t want to risk damaging the steed unless the need was critical. Since Ruwen\u2019s Soul remained damaged, he needed to use Spirit, which meant every tendril he launched caused him pain. More concerning, the tendrils disintegrated quicker the closer he got to the Funnel, and now... The only reason Ruwen\u2019s Shadow Sliding worked near the Funnel entrance was because Ceplotryn contaminated his Core with Soul Energy. It acted like a durability enhancer. Ruwen launched a rope at a nearby outcropping, but the tendril of Spirit dissolved before half the distance was covered. Ruwen had done the math as they moved toward the Funnel and calculated his approximately twenty million Spirit would last for six days of constant Shadow Sliding. If he doubled the strength of his Spirit ropes, it would reduce that to three days. But the durability issue would only get worse the deeper he traveled, so compensating with Spirit was a failing strategy. Using the same Spirit thickness as before but adding a film of Mental Energy proved successful, a huge relief. Ruwen hadn\u2019t used his Willpower to flatten the landscape or mold it into something more familiar, as he wanted to hide his presence and preserve Mental Energy. Ruwen easily detected the shadow panther that crept almost close enough to pounce. He still didn\u2019t know what Hamma\u2019s blessing did, so he made himself an irresistible target by bending over as if adjusting his boots. As expected, the shadow panther immediately attacked. Ruwen stood, turned, and waited patiently for it to arrive. The move surprised the shadow panther, but not enough to change its attack. The cat\u2019s claws struck and immediately raked down the front of Ruwen's body. Ruwen studied the buff and glanced in his log, but nothing triggered or changed. He thought maybe it was a protection buff, but that seemed unlikely now. To check if it helped offensively, Ruwen struck the panther with a simple punch. The cat shattered into thousands of pieces, which dissolved rapidly. Again, Ruwen checked for any differences, but the buff had once again not triggered. What\u2019s that on the ground? Rami asked. A seed-sized clump of string lay where the shadow panther perished, only visible because it faintly glowed. When Ruwen focused on the glowing mass, it disappeared. Where did it go? Rami asked. I don\u2019t know. It disappeared as soon as I looked at it. Maybe it was just a coincidence, and whatever it was dissolved. Let me check the log. Oh wow, Rami said, evidently coming to that conclusion faster than Ruwen. Ruwen opened his log. Blessing of Sacrificial Luck has harvested 0.3 positive threads of fate. Blessing of Sacrificial Luck has harvested 0.1 negative threads of fate. Ruwen concentrated on his Blessing of Sacrificial Luck buff, and for the first time, a new display appeared under it. Available Fate for Redistribution: Positive Threads: 0.3 Negative Threads: 0.1 \"Are you kidding me?\" Ruwen said out loud as he checked the buff's description. Name: Blessing of Sacrificial Luck Quality: Mythical Effect: Redistribute the threads of fate harvested from your enemies. Restriction: Only one Mythical Blessing can be active at any time. Restriction: Threads of fate are unusable by harvester. Description: A woodsy cologne containing hints of softer scents. Applied by a Priestess, this cologne allows the user to harvest the luck of their enemies and, like Fate itself, place that luck on others. Increase the luck of your allies and ruin the luck of your enemies. Ruwen reread the text in disbelief. Just to validate the description, he focused on himself and willed the zero point three luck to transfer, but nothing happened. He concentrated on Rami and repeated the process. The available positive thread count dropped from zero point three to zero, and Rami spoke excitedly. I just received a buff called Lucky Roll. It says, \u2018take a chance, your luck has increased slightly.\u2019 Does it have a duration? Yes, five minutes. I can't believe Hamma created such an incredible buff on her first try. Well, she did use a priceless ingredient, and it was literally liquid luck. So, she did have a little help. Rami thought for a moment and continued. Imagine if you stored up a bunch of bad luck and dumped it on an enemy before attacking them. If I could harvest these threads efficiently, I\u2019d be so overpowered. You mean more overpowered. I guess. But I don't feel overpowered. Especially with all the damage I tend to do to myself. You are your own worst enemy. I know Hamma will be disappointed that her lucky cologne doesn't benefit me directly, but this might be even better as I can use it tactically. Are we doing some luck harvesting, or going after the Muses? Ruwen sighed. The Muses. I wish Hamma had given me this earlier. I could\u2019ve amassed a huge number of fate threads. Break my scales, tell me you see the irony in that comment, mister-work-everything-he-does-to-death-until-he's-perfected-it. That's a long nickname, but I get your point. Perfection is the enemy of done. Okay, with my Mental Energy, I can continue to do my Shadow Sliding\u2060\u2014 Rami interrupted, Shadow Stumbling, you mean. That\u2019s hurtful, and I just started. Like I was saying, I can do the sliding thing, or I could let this aspect help us along. It feels weird, like it desires something. Desires what? This is going to sound strange, but home. I feel like it wants to go home. Well, we\u2019re just at the boundary, so anywhere it takes us will be closer to the bottom than we are now. So I say we use it. Maybe we can make up some time. I have a terrible feeling those Muses had a much faster route to the lake, because none of them would know how to Shadow Slide. For all we know, they're already there. Ruwen had considered the same thing and his urgency increased. All right, I'm taking my hand off the leash, so to speak. Are you ready? Yup. Ruwen dropped his resistance to the Scarecrow Aspect, and the entire realm twisted. When it unwound, Ruwen fell to his knees as a crushing force of destruction slammed into every portion of his body. The Aspect exerted its own will and pushed back, providing Ruwen the moment he needed to coat himself with Mental Energy. Ruwen's Mental bar began dropping in five percent chunks, and he immediately deployed a Harmonic Shield around himself. The shield also consumed Mental Energy but reduced the need for his pure Mental Armor. The result slowed the energy consumption to something his natural Regeneration could keep up with. Are you okay? Ruwen asked Rami. Yes. It's uncomfortable but bearable. Um, you should look around. The last of the disorientation left Ruwen, and he pushed himself to his feet and studied his surroundings. Ruwen stood on a dais made from the massive bone of some strange creature. More precisely, Ruwen stood on a throne that sat on the bone dais. The throne had an odd back. Instead of a solid piece, it had two long vertical openings. Based on seat height, the owner stood at least seven feet tall. The throne's material didn't trigger any of the millions of items in Ruwen's recently expanded Grandmaster alchemist memories. The dais sat in the very center of an island that Ruwen recognized. The location was unmistakable\u2014with its five strange towers arranged evenly around it. Ruwen also recognized the person striding toward him and had a good guess who the six following were. \"What are you doing on my throne?\" the Havoc Sovereign demanded. \n CHAPTER 57 The air crackled with energy, and the towering spires surrounding Ruwen pulsated with discordant harmonies. The ground around the throne, a mix of scorched earth and bone fragments, vibrated with waves of destruction. The Havoc Sovereign\u2014a gaunt figure shrouded in a cloak of shifting shadows\u2014hovered above the ground thirty feet away. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d the Havoc Sovereign asked and then continued before Ruwen could answer. \u201cYour signature is masked, but I can tell you aren\u2019t from this Realm. How can you survive here?\u201d \u201cGive me the potions, and I\u2019ll answer your questions.\u201d The milky white eyes of the Havoc Sovereign looked Ruwen up and down. \u201cYou\u2019re an alchemist? That explains your resistance to the aura here. You created a potion for yourself.\u201d The Havoc Sovereign tapped a bag at his side. \u201cYou\u2019re a couple of weeks too late for these. Despite the long odds, I\u2019ve found a group willing to use these for the greater good. Well, my good. Why don\u2019t you just make yourself more potions? Why come all the way here to fetch these?\u201d He\u2019s too talkative, Overlord said, likely waiting for the new owners of those potions to show up instead of fighting you alone. He\u2019s very crafty. Ruwen reached the same conclusion. He wished he wasn\u2019t so limited in his abilities. The Shadow and Bamboo Viper Steps, his most trusted techniques, offered little advantage here because the Havoc Sovereign possessed a different body structure than a typical human. He\u2019d had this same problem when faced with Ceplotryn. In addition, his soul\u2019s injury kept him from testing the damage his level two soul could inflict. The Necrolite's milky white eyes, devoid of pupils, fixed Ruwen with chilling intensity. It smiled, knowing the attempts at delay had failed. A spear created from Destruction Essence and controlled by the Necrolite\u2019s Willpower formed two feet in front of Ruwen. Before the spear moved an inch, Ruwen used his own Willpower to disperse it. He felt the resistance of the Necrolite\u2019s Willpower and brushed it aside. The Havoc Sovereign hissed and took a step backward, channeling its Willpower into a shield around itself. Ruwen cursed. He\u2019d wanted to practice using Willpower against a stronger enemy, but he\u2019d shown too much strength on their first interaction, and the Havoc Sovereign had turned defensive. He doubted the Necrolite would use its Willpower offensively again. The Havoc Sovereign raised a hand. From its fingertips, a stream of dark energy spiraled out, weaving through the air like tendrils of smoke. Ruwen reacted instantly, leaping to the ground. The energy struck the throne, and waves of dense energy spread outward in a black ripple. The attack contained immense energy, but the throne showed no damage. With a wave, Ruwen sliced the shock wave open, providing space for him to fit as the bubble passed. The ground shattered as the ripples touched it, leaving a gaping scar that oozed with a black tar-like substance. Mental Energy coated the Scarecrow Aspect, acting as a shield. The protection only provided a temporary respite against the relentless assault of both the Destruction Realm and the Havoc Sovereign. Ruwen entered Last Breath and took stock of the situation as everyone met at the Citadel\u2019s platform. He kept part of his focus on the outside world in case the Destruction Realm could circumvent Last Breath somehow. \u201cNow?\u201d Rami asked. \u201cLet\u2019s wait a bit. You\u2019re our surprise attack. Can you mimic him?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Rami said a bit excitedly. \u201cI wish we could help,\u201d Overlord said. \u201cYou know the Minion forms would disintegrate immediately, and maintaining our mental connection might consume energy I\u2019ll need later.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d Overlord said with a sigh. Ruwen opened his Architect Role, planning to make quick work of the situation, but was shocked to see everything greyed out. \u201cUh, Uruziel, why does nothing work in here?\u201d \u201cNo one has ever been this deep in the Destruction Realm. The Architect Role works a little near the boundary of the Material Realm, but evidently, it\u2019s not meant for the Destruction Realm. That has far-reaching consequences, and I\u2019d like some time to think about it.\u201d Well, that was a disappointment, but Ruwen had more than one plan. Ruwen concentrated on his enemies and his eyes darted to the six humanoid shadows flanking the Havoc Sovereign, their forms twisted from the effects of the Destruction Realm assimilation. They stood frozen mid-step as they marched toward him. Ruwen centered himself and activated Harmonic Sight and Knowledge. He gasped in shock despite anticipating the result. He\u2019d considered the discordant vibrational structures near the barrier with the Material Realm bad, but they contained perfect harmonies compared to the conflicting nature here at the bottom of the Destruction Realm. Massive disharmonies circled the island like worm-shaped tempests, and chords fought each other in a vicious and chaotic free-for-all. Ruwen could see savage tones attempting to penetrate his armor, so they could burrow into his flesh. Nowhere could Ruwen find even a semblance of balance, and when he attempted to exert order on the chaotic environment, it clashed against his efforts, a symphony of turmoil that sought to overwhelm his senses. Ruwen released Last Breath and sprinted toward the Havoc Sovereign, using a Spirit-based spell like Blink would instantly be consumed by the environment. The Necrolite sneered, his voice creating a harsh melody with the wind. \"Accept your pitiful fate, human.\" Ruwen didn't falter, knowing his next move had to count because he had very few offensive options. He crossed the thirty feet in a moment. Just as he prepared to strike, the Havoc Sovereign unleashed another wave of destructive energy. Prepared for this, Ruwen prayed the Relic magic would function in this environment and triggered the Hanged Man card he\u2019d gotten from Tarot. Ruwen swapped places with the shadow-Muse to the Havoc Sovereign\u2019s left as the Instant Martyr ability from The Hanged Man relic mark activated. The shadow took the full brunt of the attack, disintegrating into a cloud of particles. Now, directly next to the Havoc Sovereign, Ruwen stood motionless and activated the Secret Veil from the Reversed High Priestess relic mark. An impenetrable veil cloaked him, rendering him invisible and untouchable for the moment. From within his sanctuary, he watched as the confusion about his location increased. The Havoc Sovereign roared in frustration, his voice distorting the air around him as he cast out immense waves of energy, seeking Ruwen with blind fury. Ruwen remained still, as movement would dispel his protective veil. The remaining five shadow-Muses also flailed about, confusion and panic leading them to lower their defenses. Ruwen willed the cask of soul-power-infused alcohol out of his Apocalypse Hoop and used Mental Energy to toss it above the Havoc Sovereign. As it hung above the Necrolite, Ruwen emerged from his veil, throwing a mental spear at the cask. The cask exploded in a brilliant flash of light. The soul-power-infused alcohol created a fiery tempest that enveloped the Havoc Sovereign and the remaining shadow-Muses. Screams filled the air as the alcohol covered their twisted bodies and consumed them. In moments, their forms crumbled into ash. The Havoc Sovereign, caught in the heart of the soul-inferno, howled in rage and agony. The destructive energies around him fluctuated wildly, reacting to his pain and fury. Ruwen waited for the flames to die down, not wanting to interfere with this incredibly effective attack. The Havoc Sovereign clenched his right hand, and as the fist formed, the soul flames were snuffed out, revealing the charred figure of the Necrolite. His form contained less substance now, the shadows around him thin and fraying at the edges. As the smoke cleared, the form of the Havoc Sovereign reconstituted, his lost essence rapidly returning. Ruwen had a flashback of his fight with Ceplotryn, but he couldn\u2019t make any sense of the discordant patterns and flows surrounding the Necrolite, so Ruwen couldn\u2019t stop it. The landscape around the towers trembled with the Havoc Sovereign\u2019s fury, and his white eyes seemed to burn with rage. Now? Rami asked. Ruwen glanced at his Mental Energy bar, which had already ticked under fifty percent. Resigned to the fact that he couldn\u2019t do this alone, he responded, Yes. Rami briefly appeared as she left her spot behind Ruwen\u2019s ear. She shimmered, expanding and twisting as she invoked one of the abilities she\u2019d gained with her Third Codex evolution: True Form. True Form stretched and morphed Rami, and she soon mirrored the towering, ghastly figure of the Havoc Sovereign, albeit slightly less imposing. She also now possessed all its skills, abilities, and traits, although only at fifty percent effectiveness. Still, it would allow her to harness the same destructive abilities as the Necrolite. The Havoc Sovereign, seeing his own visage mirrored in combat, let out a low guttural laugh. \"A shadow of a shadow,\" he taunted, his voice echoing off the surrounding towers. \n CHAPTER 58 With a swift motion, the Havoc Sovereign raised his hands. From four of the towers, a beam of dense energy surged, converging in the sky. The power swirled, forming a vortex of energy above the battlefield before raining destruction down on Ruwen and Rami. Ruwen gracefully avoided the onslaught, while Rami, in her new much larger size, absorbed most of the spell, her new form providing a natural resistance against the chaotic attack. The physical impact of the rain, however, carried tremendous force, and it pushed her to the ground, where she quivered under the strain. The spell ended, and while Rami recovered and Ruwen ran back toward the Havoc Sovereign, the Necrolite summoned additional forces. Large double doors appeared at the base of the nearest tower, and three malevolent figures emerged. Ruwen Identified them. Class: Scourge Sentinel Race: Pyrogons Tower: Fire Order of Succession: Not Permissible Will: 155 Willpower: 2,450 Destruction Density: Diamond The Scourged Sentinels\u2019 thick, charcoal-black skin crisscrossed with glowing red fissures stretched over muscular bodies. Even hunched they stood twenty feet high, and each dual wielded vicious clubs. From their backs sprouted small smoldering wings that flared brightly but seemed incapable of lifting them. The trio approached, their eyes glowing red as they moved to flank Ruwen. Ruwen, his Mental Energy dropping under twenty percent from the constant need to shield himself from the Destruction Realm and enemy spells, decided to fight the newcomers with his Steps to conserve his power. Rami emitted a deep growl that mimicked the Havoc Sovereign's own and unleashed a wave of dark energy toward the approaching Sentinels. The attack, though only half of the Sovereign's strength, staggered them, their forms momentarily dissolving before pulling back together. Confident Rami could handle the Scourge Sentinels, Ruwen focused on the Havoc Sovereign, who channeled another surge of energy from the towers. The landscape near the Necrolite warped, and the air grew thick with overwhelming power. Not wanting to face the brunt of such an attack, Ruwen activated the Emperor relic mark, triggering the ability Show of Respect as he leaped at the Havoc Sovereign. Every enemy within fifty feet dropped to their knees, stuck there for three seconds by the relic mark\u2019s magic. The Havoc Sovereign, caught off guard by the compelling force, lost control of the spell, and its connection to the towers disappeared. Ruwen collided with the Havoc Sovereign, his attacks fueled with Mental Energy\u2014which had now ticked under ten percent. Ruwen used his vast skill in the Steps and his perfected body to shatter the Necrolite\u2019s chest as he tried to strike the Heart Meridian and damage the Havoc Sovereign's Spiritual network. Rami battled the Scourge Sentinels. Her imitation of the Havoc Sovereign\u2019s form gave her an edge and she produced dense spears of destruction which sprouted out of the approaching enemies\u2019 bodies. Focusing on the largest Sentinel, Rami dispatched it with a concentrated blast of corrupted energy, but the effort left her visibly diminished, her form flickering. The Havoc Sovereign, enraged by the damage Ruwen had caused and by the damage Rami inflicted by using his own mirrored powers, unleashed a desperate, vengeful assault. From a distant tower, the Havoc Sovereign summoned a dark essence that slithered through the air like a living shadow. A torrent of frigid energy swept across the battlefield, indiscriminate in its hunger for destruction. Ruwen, sensing the surge overwhelm his defenses, used the last of his Mental Power to strengthen his shield. It wasn\u2019t enough as the dark energy seeped through the mental barrier. Dark energy raged against the Scarecrow Aspect along with the destruction essence from the realm itself, which could finally reach the Scarecrow Aspect with the shielding gone. Rami, caught in the blast as well, screamed in pain\u2014a distorted echo of the Havoc Sovereign\u2019s howls. As the wave of annihilation receded, Ruwen staggered in pain and mental exhaustion. The Scarecrow Aspect had protected him from injury but had taken damage in the process. Frayed tears and rips marred the armor. The attack had overwhelmed Rami\u2019s True Form ability, and she\u2019d returned to her natural bookwyrm body. She struggled to leave the broken ground. The Havoc Sovereign, drained from channeling such a powerful spell, wavered weakly ten feet from Ruwen. The Necrolite gasped for breath and no longer hovered. Ruwen faked a cramp that pulled him off balance. With a growl, the Havoc Sovereign lunged at Ruwen in a last desperate strike. Ruwen sidestepped the attack. His Mental Regen powered a shield that protected his body from the Destruction Realm, but he had no extra. With a grimace of pain, Ruwen summoned his Wrathful Crow Beater staff along with ten Aspect Clones. The Destruction Realm immediately began dissolving the Spirit-created items, but with the Scarecrow Aspect as their source, they had more durability than usual. The Havoc Sovereign attacked the Clones, swiping at them with necrotic energy. The Necrolite focused on the wrong enemy and didn\u2019t realize the mistake until Ruwen struck him with the staff. The blow staggered the Sovereign, and, before he could recover, Ruwen struck again, using all the extra skill points he\u2019d gained training with Hamma. The Havoc Sovereign's body unraveled, the destruction essence that held him together suddenly shifting as it consumed him. With a final scream that echoed across the chaotic landscape, the Necrolite's form dissipated, leaving behind a small, blackened Core that fell to the ground with a muted thud. Ruwen glanced around to find Rami had almost reached him. She crawled behind his left ear, exhausted but alive. Ruwen used his Divine sight to find the threads of fate from the Scourge Sentinels Rami had killed. The threads disappeared as soon as he focused on them, and he repeated the process with the shadow-Muses and Havoc Sovereign before checking his gains. Available Fate for Redistribution: Positive Threads: 10.6 Negative Threads: 11.1 Ruwen touched the black Core of the Havoc Sovereign and willed it into the Apocalypse Hoop. He was too tired to examine it now, and wanted to concentrate on getting out of this place. With a relieved sigh, he picked up the pouch and verified all the potions were in it. They\u2019d survived this dangerous and unknown environment, and while it had taken significant resources, they\u2019d succeeded in their mission. Ruwen glanced at the five towers that surrounded him, but now wasn\u2019t the time to explore them. He would have time for that later. The discordant energies of the realm pulsated violently, as if the defeat of the Necrolite had brought added chaos to the realm's relentless turmoil. Ruwen needed to return and study how to work with such conflicting structures, but that, too, had to wait\u2014for now. Whoever had wanted the potions was on the way, and Ruwen needed to be gone before they arrived. The Apocalypse Hoop only had his sword and the Necrolite\u2019s Core, but the three remaining slots couldn\u2019t hold the six potions, so he slung the bag across his body. Ruwen willed the destruction in front of him to coalesce into a path and sprinted down it. He wanted to get off this island before anything else showed up. Reaching up, Ruwen gently touched Rami. Thanks for your help. That was close. That Havoc Sovereign made me reveal more than I wanted. I needed to tap the Aspect abilities and summon some clones and the bo staff. Rami paused before responding. You didn\u2019t go all out? No. I\u2019m trying to learn as much as I can, and if I destroy everything I look at right away, how can I do that? Rami bit Ruwen\u2019s ear. You could have told me that. I thought we were almost dead. Ruwen rubbed Rami\u2019s head, but she just bit his finger. I kept a close eye on you. You know I wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to you. I know. What did you keep back? If you\u2019d bothered to go through all my \u2018boring\u2019 training memories, you\u2019d know. I don\u2019t care that much. Do you know where you\u2019re going? No. I\u2019m just putting some distance between us and those towers. Then we can figure out where to go. Ruwen wasn\u2019t looking forward to Shadow Sliding all the way to the Material Realm far above, which he probably didn\u2019t have enough Mental Energy for anyway. That meant he\u2019d need to reveal another secret before leaving. One that literally chomped at the bit to come out. Amongst all the discordant vibrations around Ruwen, he sensed a familiar presence. One that would be incapable of hiding from him. Nameless. And Ruwen knew the destructive nihilist Narrator didn\u2019t travel alone. \u201cWhat an unexpected surprise,\u201d Lalquinrial said from above. \n CHAPTER 59 Looking up, Ruwen found Lalquinrial, Nameless\u2019s new host, along with the Dark Priest who\u2019d escaped from the Black Pyramid and the two Archangels that had accompanied Pen, Miranda, and Kholy\u2014and been contaminated long ago. On the ground behind them, the aspects of War, Drought, Pestilence, and Poison loomed, along with at least a hundred demons\u2014all infected by the Destruction Realm. Ruwen immediately activated Last Breath. The Destruction Realm, especially here in the deepest part, had awoken the Aspect in a way Ruwen had never experienced. He suppressed the Scarecrow Aspect during the fight with the Havoc Sovereign as pure hatred oozed from the Aspect at the sight of the Necrolite. And now, once again, Ruwen detected, of all things, sadness while looking at the four other aspects. What was going on with the Scarecrow Aspect? We have a serious problem, Ruwen told Rami. I see that. It\u2019s okay. I have a plan. Are we fighting? No way. I\u2019m not strong enough right now. My soul doesn\u2019t work, I can\u2019t use Harmony here, and I just used up most of my Mental Energy. I\u2019m going to use the abilities I saved to get us out of here. Please tell me it doesn\u2019t involve your heroic sacrifice. Ruwen smiled despite the situation. No, I\u2019ve learned my lesson. The Scarecrow Aspect\u2019s strange behavior worried Ruwen, although he kept that to himself. For some reason, it didn\u2019t want to leave this island, which meant two of his four escape plans might fail. Here's the plan, Ruwen said. When I dismiss Last Breath, I'm going to summon Vex. You must immediately attach yourself tightly to him. Why won't you be riding him? Ruwen didn't want to discuss the Aspect's odd behavior, so he lied a little. If they give us time, I will, but if it looks like they\u2019ll cut us off, I\u2019m going to split off. I have three other ways out of here, but this is your only chance. That sounds awfully like a sacrifice. It's not. Didn't you hear the part about three escape routes? If anything, you should be upset I'm going to beat you back to camp. Ruwen could sense Rami\u2019s doubts so he clarified. I have two instant recalls. The Scarecrow Aspect has one, and my Ink Lord\u2019s Wrap has another. Both are off cooldown and ready to go. If that fails, I still have the Triumvirate Bridge. I told you I planned for a situation like this. I guess. So I latch on to Vex, then what? I'm going to cast a shield your mom gave me on Vex to protect him as he takes us to safety. I\u2019m probably going to trigger a couple of other things, if we\u2019re in range, but like I told you before, I don't plan on fighting. What shield? Ruwen gave her the description. Name: Avocado Surprise Quality: Legendary Restriction: Shadow Realm only Restriction: Single use Restriction: Effect triggers on holder\u2019s focus Effect (triggered): Avocadobra\u2013create a delicious shield effective against even the most destructive power. Description: A vibrant creamy shield. This protective barrier consists of a buttery texture and bright green color with a fresh and inviting aroma. Chips not included. Okay, let's go, Rami said. This makes me really nervous. Ruwen took a moment and crystallized the sequence of events he planned to execute as soon as Last Breath dropped. Here we go, Ruwen said and released Last Breath. Ruwen summoned Vex, who appeared instantly next to him. Rami darted over and burrowed into Vex\u2019s mane. In quick succession, Ruwen applied ten point six positive luck on Rami and eleven point one negative luck on Lalquinrial. He focused on Vex and pictured the drawing Avocado Surprise Blapy had given him: two stick figures surrounded by trees with green fruit. One of the figures was on fire and the other had eight circles running through its body. Ruwen triggered Avocadobra. Vex\u2019s black hide turned pale green, the color shocking in the grey-black world of the Destruction Realm. Perhaps even more shocking was the strong scent the shield gave off. Ruwen tried to mount Vex. Despite using all his strength and mentally pushing back against the Scarecrow Aspect, his feet barely left the ground. The enemy group was only fifty feet away, and Lalquinrial spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s pointless\u2060\u2014\u201d Ruwen interrupted the Infernal Lord with his first command to Vex: Willful Stomp. Effect (Triggered \u2013 Destruction Realm Only): Willful Stomp\u2013Stomp the ground, releasing shockwaves of Willpower that knock back and disorient enemies for one to three seconds. Three-quarters of the group in the air fell to the ground, disoriented and everything on the ground stood stunned. Ruwen gave Vex a second command: Seventh Seal. Effect (Triggered): Seventh Seal\u2013Every six days, banish an infernal creature to the Infernal Realm. To Ruwen's great delight, Lalquinrial disappeared in a hissing plume of sulfur. Ruwen released Vex, urging the Steed of the Apocalypse to get Rami to safety. Vex neighed and disappeared into the sky traveling with two powerful abilities. Effect (Passive): Realm Prancer\u2013Travel on any medium in any Realm. Effect (Triggered): Free Rein\u2013Teleport to any visible point. The combination of the stun and Lalquinrial\u2019s sudden disappearance amplified the confusion, and Ruwen triggered the set bonus on the Scarecrow Aspect, picturing the gate runes near camp where he had practiced with Ky. Set Bonus (Active): Holy Rapture: Once per week, transport yourself to any location in the current Realm and sector using mental gate runes. Like snuffing out a candle, the Scarecrow Aspect negated the teleport. Ruwen had expected this and triggered the effect Bookmark on his Ink Lord\u2019s Wrap, which would return him to the Dungeon Master's lair in Fractal. The Destruction Realm, however, consumed the magic as it formed the dimensional warp around Ruwen, and it failed as well. Most of the enemy group had recovered, but Ruwen needed more time for his final option, the Triumvirate Bridge. Ruwen knew he was entering a dangerous area, and unlike many previous times, he had spent considerable time with Overlord, Uruziel, and Sivart during the past month planning for the unexpected. The Triumvirate Bridge required up to ten seconds to move Ruwen from one realm to another. With a mental finger, he strummed upward on the sapphire gem in his right palm. Ten seconds. Ruwen triggered Celestial Alarm on his Scarecrow Aspect Pants of Reaping, feeding it half his remaining Spirit. The pain of using so much Spirit brought him to his knees, and he gritted his teeth from the pain. Effect (Active): Celestial Alarm: Area of effect fear with an intensity and range proportional to Spirit used. Ruwen's Divine senses detected everyone in the enemy group fleeing as the fear struck them. Nine seconds. Eight seconds. Ruwen leaped back toward the towers, and dashed behind the throne, placing it between himself and his enemies. He summoned his Wrathful Crow Beater, the bo staff a comforting weight in his hand. Seven seconds. Ruwen focused on himself and triggered the Scarecrow Aspect Jacket of Sowing\u2019s effect: Divine Murder. One hundred forty-four thousand crows circled around Ruwen, shielding him for fifteen seconds. Six seconds. Five seconds. Ruwen's senses confirmed no one was within a hundred feet of him, and Lalquinrial hadn\u2019t yet returned. Four seconds. Ruwen would make it out and escape with his life. A whirlwind of emotions leaked from the Scarecrow Aspect, each an echo which coalesced into a thunderstorm of feelings. Regret, bitterness, overwhelming sadness, and one that resonated with Ruwen so strongly it took his breath away, and he leaned against the throne for support. Three seconds. Responsibility. It raged throughout the Scarecrow Aspect, causing Ruwen's body to shake. It felt like his responsibility, although he couldn't tell what \u201cit\u201d was. Two seconds. Anger, and unimaginable loss, smothered everything, and Ruwen's body burned. Unfairness, hatred, futility, fury, revenge, hopelessness\u2014all of it flowed through Ruwen. Ruwen's body shook as the resonance from the Triumvirate Bridge overpowered the dissonance around him and began his return to the Material Realm. One second. As if finding a moment of clarity, the swirl of emotions from the Scarecrow Aspect stopped, and one concept emerged: resolve. Along with an impression: not again. With a surge of energy, the Scarecrow Aspect shattered the Triumvirate Bridge in Ruwen's right palm. Blood sprayed the throne, and the entire island shook. The resonance\u2014the energy that had almost yanked Ruwen from the Destruction Realm\u2014disappeared. The crows, unable to withstand the destructive forces of this environment, thinned and then disappeared. Ruwen felt the dimensional disturbance as Lalquinrial returned. And Ruwen was out of plans. \n CHAPTER 60 Discordant energy, made worse by the death of the Havoc Sovereign, buzzed in this forsaken place. Identify had described the Necrolite as the acting Sovereign of the Destruction Realm. Had his death placed the realm into chaos? The five looming towers pierced the sky, their shadows stretching like fingers across the land. They too had come alive, shaking violently when Lalquinrial showed up. \u201cCome, let\u2019s talk,\u201d Lalquinrial said. \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re still here means all your escape plans have failed.\u201d Ruwen glanced at his bloody right palm and cursed the Scarecrow Aspect. Had the Aspect shown loyalty to Lalquinrial as its maker and sabotaged Ruwen? It hadn\u2019t felt like that, though. It had felt, if anything, like hatred for the Infernal Lord. Feeling Overlord\u2019s presence, Ruwen activated Last Breath. You haven't tried a dimensional portal or translocating your body into another realm yet, Overlord said. I need a smooth dimensional plane to make a portal, and even then, I can only go small distances. I have no idea how far we are from the material realm boundary. And assuming I could even calm myself down enough to start a translocation, it suffers from the same problems. Ruwen gave a mental sigh. You're right, though, I should try. Ruwen dropped Last Breath long enough to determine if either of Overlord's suggestions were feasible. With Last Breath in place again, Ruwen updated Overlord. It was worse than I thought. There is no rhyme or reason to the flows. It\u2019s just pure chaos at the dimensional level. It's the same issue I'm having with Harmony. An idea occurred to Ruwen. One sec, let me see if I can force a calm area using Willpower. A moment later, Ruwen returned to Last Breath to give Overlord the bad news. It looks calm on the surface, but underneath it's just a bunch of trapped pockets of chaos. What about the blood you sprayed over the throne? Overlord asked. What about it? All the energy got sucked out of it. My blood won\u2019t work for gate runes. And I can\u2019t squeeze any Soul Power from my soul. Uruziel thinks there might be enough soul contamination in your Spirit to try a door. She thinks there\u2019s something special about your blood because the realm left it alone. Where is she? She and Sivart are checking the boundaries of your mind for any signs of destruction energy. Tell them thanks. Ruwen released Last Breath. Bracing for the pain, he stepped up to the throne and used his soul-contaminated Spirit to generate the gate runes for the camp far above. As soon as the runes struck the throne, they disappeared, as the Destruction Realm or the throne absorbed it. \u201cAre you ignoring me, Ruwen?\u201d Lalquinrial asked. Ruwen used his bloody palm like a rag and smeared his blood over the back of the throne. Maybe the blood would protect the gate runes long enough for him to squeeze through. Once again, Ruwen generated the gate runes. To his shock, they didn\u2019t disappear. Better yet, his dimensional portal training, which was useless in all the chaos of this realm, could tell the gate rune doorway he\u2019d made was stable. Relief filled him as he dived through the gateway. Or tried to. Once again, the Scarecrow Aspect prevented his retreat. Ruwen growled in frustration and hissed mentally at the Aspect. Do you want me to die? We need to leave! But the Aspect either couldn\u2019t understand Ruwen or didn\u2019t care. Ruwen clenched his hands in fury, and more blood littered the ground around the throne. Overlord, have everyone try and find where the Scarecrow Aspect lives in there. He\u2019s going to get us killed. Resigned, Ruwen stepped out from behind the throne. Lalquinrial sat cross-legged thirty feet away. He held out a hand. \u201cCome sit. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d Do you think this is a trick? Ruwen asked Overlord. Why? He knows you can\u2019t leave, and he has you vastly outnumbered. He\u2019s doing it because he has nothing to fear. Okay, I\u2019m going to buy us time. Find that Scarecrow Aspect so we can neutralize it long enough to escape. Every entity in here is looking. Ruwen strode forward. In reality, getting this close to his enemies was an advantage because of his Step training. He went over his remaining abilities. Rami had put Will and Willpower into Ruwen\u2019s Profile, but both stats read Unknown. It seemed the System had a lot of difficulty quantifying his mental abilities. The Scarecrow Aspect stun and crow shield had not reset since his last use, and he assumed this was due to more of the Aspect\u2019s meddling. He didn't have a ton of Spirit left anyway. The Ink Lord\u2019s Wrap was Ruwen's favorite armor, and he loathed the idea of losing it to the Destruction Realm\u2019s hunger, but he needed the protection, so he willed it to deploy under his Scarecrow Aspect. It had a few things that might help him, and if they could neutralize the Scarecrow Aspect, he could try Bookmark again. Effect (Passive): First Edition: Reduce all magical damage by 33%. Effect (Triggered): Top Shelf: Once per hour, create a staircase made from air with a max height of 200 feet and max weight of 500 lbs. Effect (Triggered): Librarian\u2019s Hush: Once per day, restore silence to your library by suppressing all sound in a 1000-foot sphere for five seconds. Effect (Triggered): Book Burning: Once per month, grant elemental immunity to all inanimate objects in a 1000-foot sphere for thirty minutes. Effect (Triggered): Ink Lord\u2019s Paper Knife: Create a small temporary blade suitable for slicing open pages or unruly patrons. Blade\u2019s composition dependent on focus. Inflicts 12 to 24 Piercing damage. Effect (Triggered): Bookmark: Set location and once per day instantly return there. The Scarecrow Aspect had provided some additional abilities when it had entered the Destruction Realm. Although Ruwen couldn't trust if the Aspect would let him use them. Set Bonus (Passive \u2013 Destruction Realm Only): Willful Domain: unlock and enter the five spires. Effect (Passive \u2013 Destruction Realm Only): Willful Toll: Once per hour, when Willpower drops below 10%, tendrils erupt from the armor, ensnaring enemies, draining their Willpower and transferring it to the wearer. Area of effect proportional to total Willpower. Effect (Passive - Destruction Realm Only): Willful Reaping: Decrease enemies\u2019 Willpower by 5% per Fortification Tier. Area of effect proportional to total Willpower. Effect (Active - Destruction Realm Only): Willful Murder: Increase Willpower Regeneration by 5% per Fortification Tier. Focusing on the effects caused Willful Reaping to activate spectral scythes that spun outward in every direction passing through Ruwen\u2019s enemies and continuing into the distance. Willful Murder also triggered, and nine crows materialized and flew in a circle around him. Both buffs confirmed that the Aspect was controlling what abilities would work and when. If things went bad, Ruwen would try and utilize Willful Domain and enter one of the unlocked towers. One of the spells Ruwen had taken from the Harmonic faction, Minor Prelude of Heresy, suppressed souls, which would be useless here since nobody used that energy. The instant cast Minor Prelude of Stillness reduced all frequencies to zero in a twenty-mile radius for three seconds, which should damage and maybe even kill everyone here. Hopefully, anyway. It cost fifty Mental Energy per second to channel and had a one-minute cooldown once the spell ended. Ruwen had the sword Threshold Compass of Fortune in his Apocalypse Hoop, and while it was sharp and might stand up to the Destruction Realm for a while, he wasn't good enough with it to try and save his life with it. The only tarot card the sword held was the upright Empress with the spell Eternal Spring, which resurrected all allies within fifty feet who\u2019d died less than sixty seconds in the past, reviving them to full health with a shield equal to half their health. That spell, while incredible, didn\u2019t help Ruwen since he stood here alone. Ruwen guessed this fight would be up close, which meant he would make good use of his Wrathful Crow Beater. The bo staff ignored ninety percent of non-magical armor and thirty percent of magical armor with a max blunt damage of six hundred per strike. Not bad at all. Ruwen had one picture left from Blapy, but it was useless. Name: Stupid Guardian Quality: Legendary Restriction: Shadow Realm only Restriction: Single use Effect (triggered): Last Word: Display to the guardian of the spires to gain entrance. Description: A more accurate description of \u201cLast Word\u201d is \u201cLast Words,\u201d but an artist\u2019s vision is not something to alter lightly. Only at the bottom can one be sure their next step leads upward. Ruwen assumed the five towers surrounding him were the spires, and his Scarecrow Aspect already gave him entry. Plus, he had no idea who the guardian of the spires was. Identify gave Ruwen information on Lalquinrial\u2019s current state: Name: Lalquinrial the Lightbringer Realm: Infernal Type: Divine Race: Human Tower: Not Applicable Rank: Not Applicable Estimated Power: Tier 3 Level 4 Class: Not Applicable Path: Not Applicable Faction: Death, Chaos Deity: Not Applicable Might: High Durability: High Support: Low Strengths: Physical combat, essence spells, intelligence, focus, determination, manipulation Weaknesses: Harmonic defense, Spiritual network Disposition: Neutral Description: A divine being originating from the Material Realm. Lalquinrial\u2019s disposition shocked Ruwen. Perhaps it didn't work correctly in the Destruction Realm. Could Lalquinrial really not consider him an enemy? As Ruwen drew near, he glanced at the four Aspects. Only Echo, the Death Aspect, wasn\u2019t here. Strangely, the four Aspects completely ignored Ruwen. Each stared at a different tower, their bodies tense. Lalquinrial couldn't see Ruwen\u2019s eyes hidden by the Scarecrow Aspect\u2019s hood, but he could see the direction of Ruwen\u2019s gaze. \u201cI fear it was a mistake to bring them here,\u201d Lalquinrial said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be useless in a fight.\u201d Ruwen sat cross-legged three feet from Lalquinrial. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d Lalquinrial smiled. \u201cOh, come now, I\u2019d bet my realm yours is behaving just as badly. Of course, the four behind me could take theirs off if they wanted.\u201d Ruwen studied Lalquinrial. He wore white pants and a loose long-sleeved shirt. His athletic build had suffered from the destruction that invaded his body. One side of the god\u2019s torso and his entire left arm had turned black, visible through the cloth. Lalquinrial\u2019s thick dark hair, greying at the temples, topped a chiseled and handsome face. Much of the twisted expression he\u2019d worn during the failed trap on Nymthus\u2019 planet had disappeared. It appeared that the Infernal Lord had Nameless under control now. As if reading Ruwen\u2019s thoughts, Lalquinrial answered. \u201cNameless is here, seething at your presence.\u201d Lalquinrial raised his black arm. \u201cHe\u2019s occupied with a war against the Destruction Realm\u2019s assimilation.\u201d \u201cI was wondering how you survived it,\u201d Ruwen said with a quick glance at the vacant stares of Abaddon and Zadkiel. \u201cNameless and my own nature help with that,\u201d Lalquinrial said. \u201cMy beliefs make me an ally of this realm, and my past actions make me a friend of the Death Tower. The realm doesn't treat its allies quite as harshly, but since I don't belong here, it still wishes to consume me, which is a draining fight. You could help me by gifting me those potions.\u201d Ruwen glanced at the Dark Priest. It stood twelve feet tall, its thin form shrouded in tattered shadowy robes that writhed and shifted with a life of their own. The Priest\u2019s skeletal visage consisted of jagged, blackened bones and its eyes burned with an intense, otherworldly yellow fire. In its skeletal hands, it held a staff with a glowing, pulsating orb of dark energy at its tip. Identify triggered revealing the stats of the Dark Priest Blapy had wanted Ruwen to capture. \n CHAPTER 61 Name: Unknown Realm: Destruction Type: Citizen Race: Maelstromian Tower: Chaos Rank: Not Applicable Estimated Power: Tier 2 Level 1 Class: Inquisitor Path: Chaotic Unraveller Faction: Chaos, Death Deity: Destruction Emperor Might: Medium Durability: Low Support: Low Strengths: Dimensional Warping, Focus, Willpower Weaknesses: Harmonics, Soul Power, Concentrated Aura Disposition: Hostile Description: Chaotic Unraveller is the most common path for Inquisitors. They are responsible for harvesting a universe at the sovereign\u2019s command, and their vast numbers provide the Chaos Tower a position of respect second only to the Death Tower. Ruwen tested the validity of the neutral disposition aura of Lalquinrial by asking for more information. \"What makes the potions valuable?\" Lalquinrial tilted his head at what Ruwen still thought of as the Dark Priest. \"The Inquisitor here knows a rebirth spell to make me anew but in a form that the Destruction Realm will accept. The resistance potion is something of a safety net. The slower the process, the greater the chance my identity will survive. An hour at the minimum, but even that might not be enough. Abaddon\u2019s and Zadkiel\u2019s assimilation took six hours, but you can see for yourself that was still too fast.\" Ruwen sat stunned that Lalquinrial had provided such a detailed response. \"What about the immunity potion?\" \"The Havoc Sovereign hoped to cross some type of barrier with that potion. By killing the active sovereign, you have started a war of domination between the towers. They will battle to make one of their own the new sovereign for this realm.\" Ruwen hadn't realized the Havoc Sovereign\u2019s importance. While the fight pushed Ruwen, it hadn't taken him to his limits. Once again, Lalquinrial smiled as he read Ruwen's body language. \"I can tell you're surprised. As powerful as the races are here, they are ill-equipped, just as we were in the Material Realm, to deal with your vibrational manipulation and mental abilities.\" Ruwen\u2019s Harmony was actually broken here, but Lalquinrial certainly didn't need to know that, and he steered the conversation in another direction. \"What are these towers?\" \"For millennia, all the deities of the Material Realm searched for knowledge and advantage. Pieces of hidden civilizations emerged, and the Muses hoarded them. The Muses, especially, were focused on exploring these dangerous places, but no one expected them to uncover the complexity that they found. Six of the muses have now perished because of that obsession. Their desire for power overwhelmed their better judgment.\" It helped explain the Muses\u2019 power. If they\u2019d collected powerful artifacts and hidden them away, no one would dare oppose them. Fear of the unknown items would be too strong. Lalquinrial continued. \u201cAlthough without the Muses, these towers would have remained hidden. What are they?\" Lalquinrial shrugged. \"None of us know and the Inquisitor won\u2019t discuss it until I\u2019ve been accepted by the Destruction Realm. Who would have thought that a parallel existence resided in the very shadows that clung to us. From my observations, I think there are five ruling races, each associated with one of these towers.\u201d \"Isn't this hidden existence proof that our universe is more complex than we can comprehend and a reason not to destroy it?\" Lalquinrial smiled. \"My thoughts exactly. To be honest, I had a crisis of identity. And then I met the Havoc Sovereign who, because of my intense interest in the Outerverse, gave me a glimpse into the truth.\" Ruwen remained quiet because he was also very interested in facts about the Outerverse. \"The Havoc Sovereign told me that, in the beginning, only the Destruction and Creation realms existed in the void, and as they fought, their battlefields blossomed into universes. Those are true places of existence.\" \"And what did he say about our universe?\" Ruwen asked. \"What I had always suspected. What I had always felt. Our universe is false. An aberration.\" \"Why? We\u2019re sitting in the Destruction Realm, and I assume the Spirit Realm is Creation.\" \"You are correct. Except our Destruction and Creation realms are not part of the originals but tiny slivers. Temporary realms paid for by the creator of our universe so it could support magic.\" \"What?\" Ruwen blurted. \"It's worse than that, Ruwen. Do you know how important your precious universe is? I just recently learned from the Inquisitor how irrelevant we are. The Havoc Sovereign you just killed had long ago completed a successful coup against the previous sovereign. And because of politics that even the Inquisitor doesn't understand, the Havoc Sovereign initiated the destruction of our universe. Why? Because he wished to quickly end this commitment and return home for a bounty.\" Ruwen remained silent as he absorbed all this new information. Lalquinrial continued. \"Our universe is so inconsequential that petty political infighting and some type of reward provided enough justification to send our entire universe down the drain. How does that make you feel?\" Ruwen didn't want to believe it, but Lalquinrial gave no signs of deception. \"It upset me,\" Lalquinrial said. \"The sudden appearance of the Darkness and the realization something greater existed outside our universe had already shaken my faith. Then the Havoc Sovereign offhandedly explained that obliterating our universe wouldn't even get him in trouble as we were defective and a hidden secret.\" \"He was lying to you,\" Ruwen said. \"Why would the Havoc Sovereign lie? He wanted an ally in the Material Realm to retrieve Destruction Realm artifacts that were stranded when Pen stalled the Darkness, and I wanted powerful Destruction Realm essence to create my aspects. We were business partners.\" Ruwen knew from the conversations he\u2019d had with Tarot that at least part of what Lalquinrial said was true. The System had provided multiple quests obviously intended for different factions, but everyone in this universe appeared to get all of them. Tarot had hinted that this universe was indeed an experiment, and possibly a failed one. It made Ruwen\u2019s stomach turn. \"Why are you telling me all this?\" Ruwen asked. Lalquinrial smiled in a genuinely friendly manner. \"I still have fifteen minutes on the bad luck debuff you placed on me. What a powerful ability. It verifies that you took the path of Fortune as a Grandmaster Alchemist. Which is another reason I want us to be allies. The ability to alter fate is priceless.\" \"Allies? How can you be serious?\" Lalquinrial grew solemn. \"I know you think I'm a madman, and I admit my methods aren't always rational, especially before I regained control of myself from Nameless.\" Ruwen instantly pictured Echo holding her dead mother at the small lake in the center of the Infernal Realm. He could still see the confusion and bottomless sorrow that Echo carried. And to Ruwen\u2019s surprise, he felt a responsibility\u2014or maybe even a duty to speak on Echo\u2019s behalf. \"That is small comfort to those you\u2019ve hurt.\" Since Lalquinrial wasn't hostile, Ruwen could create a telepathic connection with the god using Sphere of Influence. He couldn\u2019t transmit a moving memory like Rami, but he could send a picture, and he did so now. The same picture that still haunted him. Lalquinrial flinched, and his shoulders sagged. \"I hope I never feel that sad,\" Ruwen said. Lalquinrial remained silent. How is the search going? Ruwen asked Overlord. We need more time. Ruwen took a deep breath, feeling the weight of this realm pressing down on him and continued the conversation. \"Even if this universe is meaningless to those in the Outerverse, it still means something to me. Every life, every moment, every emotion within it has value. Why do you insist on its destruction?\" Lalquinrial locked eyes with Ruwen. \"Value? What value does a dream possess? This universe you so desperately cling to is a figment, a fleeting thought. It\u2019s no more real than the phantoms that dance within your mind. Simandreial refused to see and chose to remain in this dream forever. Echo will understand. She will make a different choice.\u201d \u201cThe connection you share with Echo is obviously important to you. Your belief system, however, would make that connection fake and hollow. Does it feel that way to you? You only need to look inside yourself Lalquinrial to see the truth.\u201d Lalquinrial didn\u2019t respond, so Ruwen continued. \"You\u2019re searching for something different? Fine, search away, but why do you need to destroy everything as you leave?\" \"How can you not see? You are begging to preserve an illusion. Everything here, all the experiences\u2014they are nothing but shadows on the wall. We are no different than the entities that live in your mind. You have the power to erase them with a single thought. Is that life? Is that true existence?\" Ruwen shook his head. \u201cYou speak of truth, of escaping this dream. But what if the Outerverse you seek is just another layer of illusion? Where does it end?\" \"It ends when every layer of falsehood is pulled back, and only truth remains. This universe is a defect, a prison for not only us but those in the Destruction and Creation realms forced into this isolation. To continue living in it, to let others believe in its false reality, is true cruelty.\" \"What right do you have to destroy it? To make the decision for everyone? Why not simply leave it behind? If it\u2019s a dream, let it be a dream for those who find meaning in it.\" Lalquinrial smiled sadly. \"Leave it behind? You spent time in a library growing up, so let me frame it with something familiar. If you found a book on the wrong shelf, you would move it. The book belongs in the library, after all. What if instead, someone arrived at the library with a bomb? They assure you it\u2019s a proper book but insist on shelving the bomb themselves and keeping the location a secret. Would you allow it? If you stumbled across this bomb in the bookshelves, would you leave it behind or would you take it outside and destroy it?\u201d \"Our universe isn\u2019t a bomb.\" Lalquinrial shrugged. \"We are shadows flitting through our creators mind. When he wakes from his nap, will we fade away? Our self-determination is an illusion. Everything is a lie, because the foundation is false.\" Lalquinrial's words resonated with the part of Ruwen that understood the fragility of his own creations. He had, after all, created a universe within his mind, a place where Narrators lived according to the rules he made. Was their existence any different from the universe he now fought to protect? \"What if you\u2019re right?\" Ruwen asked. \u201cWhat if this universe is no different than the entities in my mind who exist at the mercy of my thoughts? Even so, does that make their experiences any less real to them? Does that justify their destruction?\" \u201cYou cannot deny the abnormality of this universe. We are a defective mockery of true existence. To continue preserving it is to perpetuate a lie.\" \"But there is beauty in this lie,\" Ruwen said. \"There is love, hope, struggle, and triumph. Can you so easily dismiss all that because it doesn't fit your definition of reality?\" \"Beauty? Hope? These are the chains that bind us to this falsehood. It\u2019s not our definition of reality that matters, but the truth itself. And the truth is that this universe is fabricated, a lie that acts as a prison. To free ourselves, we must become something real.\u201d That explained why Lalquinrial wished to undergo this transformation into an entity of the Destruction Realm. He believed it would turn him into something real. The universe Ruwen wanted to save was indeed abnormal, a creation that existed at the whim of a power beyond his comprehension. But did that justify its annihilation? \"I don\u2019t share your nihilistic conviction that everything which doesn't conform to your version of the truth needs to be destroyed. If the Outerverse is the true reality, just go there. There is no reason to bring ruin to this universe.\u201d \u201cThis universe is a false reality. And if one's goal is the truth, one is obligated to destroy falsehood wherever it\u2019s discovered. To do otherwise is to live amongst perpetual deceit.\" Ruwen focused on Overlord. Any luck finding that Aspect? Arguing with a destructive nihilist is exhausting, and I've already started to repeat myself. We're almost out of time. Nothing yet, sorry, Overlord responded. Ruwen continued his conversation with Lalquinrial. \u201cI can\u2019t accept that the lives and loves of this universe are meaningless. Even if it\u2019s a dream, it\u2019s a dream worth saving.\" Lalquinrial sighed. \u201cI really thought you\u2019d see the truth. Of all people, you carry the proof of our hollow existence in your own mind. You are a fool clinging to shadows, afraid to step into the light of truth. I will see this universe destroyed, and I will awaken to the reality that lies beyond.\" \"You seek destruction in the name of truth, and I seek preservation in the name of hope.\u201d Ruwen paused for a moment as he gathered his thoughts. \u201cWhat if the pursuit of truth only leads to more questions, more uncertainty? It\u2019s the journey, the struggle itself that provides meaning.\u201d \u201cThe journey is meaningless if it\u2019s based on falsehoods. The struggle is futile if the foundation is a lie. Only by destroying deception can we reveal the truth.\" \u201cPerhaps the foundation is flawed, perhaps the universe is a dream. But it\u2019s a dream that has given rise to life, love, experiences that are real to those who live them. Can we not honor that even as we seek the truth?\" \"To honor a lie is to betray the truth. We must be willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of reality. Only then can we truly be free. You will be consumed by the very lies you seek to protect.\" I think we are out of time, Ruwen told Overlord. Sorry, Ruwen, Overlord replied. We\u2019ve looked everywhere we can. There\u2019s no trace of the Aspect. \n CHAPTER 62 \u201cYou would rather die here, then accept my offer?\u201d Lalquinrial asked. \u201cDestroying our Universe is a betrayal of everything I stand for. How could I live with myself?\u201d \u201cThis Universe will fall after you die anyway. In both scenarios the Universe disappears, but you die in only one. Are you that great of a fool?\u201d \u201cMost seem to think so.\u201d Lalquinrial sighed and stood. Ruwen stood as well, knowing things were about to get serious. Ruwen focused on Overlord. Keep looking for that Aspect. I\u2019ll buy us as much time as I can. Lalquinrial\u2019s formidable demon army shifted in anticipation, but the four aspects still stared at the towers. Lalquinrial disappeared using an advanced Shadow Sliding technique that Ruwen had never seen. Obviously, the Infernal Lord had spent time in the Destruction Realm practicing. The Inquisitor performed the same movement, taking the two fallen Archangels with it, and reappeared two hundred feet away. A shield formed around the Inquisitor as it chanted in a guttural tongue. The Archangels Abaddon and Zadkiel, once beings of light, now stood as destruction-filled husks. They flanked the priest, spreading their tattered wings and watching Ruwen with hollow eyes. Ruwen didn't chase Lalquinrial or the Dark Priest. He needed to conserve his limited resources and buy time for Overlord and company to find the Aspect who kept them trapped here. Ruwen summoned the Wrathful Crow Beater as the Aspects\u2014Poison, Drought, Pestilence, and War\u2014disappeared, each of them shifting to a different tower. He wasn\u2019t sure if Lalquinrial did it or if the Aspects transported themselves. Or maybe the towers triggered it. Gripping the Wrathful Crow Beater, surrounded by enemies, the weight of Ruwen\u2019s isolation had never felt heavier. The discordant energy of the realm fought against the natural Harmony of Ruwen\u2019s body with a constant barrage of tiny attacks. Taking a deep breath, he extended his wings. The leathery demonic wings fit this nightmarish environment well. They reveled in the destruction, and instead of creating a resonance with the surroundings like his harp wings, these increased the dissonance around him. The demon horde advanced, thankfully not by Shadow Sliding, and it would take them twenty seconds to reach Ruwen\u2019s current location. Ruwen spun his staff and struck the ground with the weapon\u2019s end, as if planting a flag. The impact sent a wave of energy across the plateau, causing the demons to hesitate, their forms shimmering as shields activated. The blow interrupted the chanting Inquisitor who immediately pulled himself and the two archangels into the air. Lalquinrial had guessed Ruwen intended to follow up with a mental or harmonic attack against his demon horde, and he created a barrier around the army, which gave Ruwen the opening he wanted. Ruwen leaped, wings beating hard against the oppressive atmosphere, and landed atop the nearest tower with a thunderous crack. This tower spiraled skyward like a twisted shard of crystal, its translucent walls shimmering with a pale ethereal light. Howling wind swirled around the tower\u2019s apex. Poison had already unleashed a cloud of noxious gas, and Ruwen spun his staff in a blur, blowing the deadly vapors away from himself and into the gusts of turbulent air. Three of the four other towers attacked Ruwen, but it only caused the current tower to activate its defenses which ended up protecting him. The Air Meridian in Ruwen\u2019s left arm vibrated, mirroring the tower exactly. It felt heavier in a weird way. Harmonic Sight easily found the poison within the chaotic backdrop, and Ruwen\u2019s wings latched onto the semblance of normality. With a single wingbeat, he released discordant energy and amplified the poisons toxicity to the point it self-destructed. Ruwen pounced on Poison, slamming the staff into their side and breaking three of their ribs. Obsessive training had honed Ruwen\u2019s body and reflexes to perfection, and Poison had not yet regained their balance when Ruwen's second blow caught the aspect in the temple, snapping its neck with a loud crack. Ruwen brought the other end of the bo staff up catching Poison under the chin and Poison slumped. Ruwen used a spear strike to shove his hand through the aspect and into Poison\u2019s chest. Ruwen released a burst of Mental Energy consuming three percent of his total pool, which had fully regenerated during his conversation with Lalquinrial. Poison\u2019s body disintegrated and the crystal tower\u2019s energy swarmed over and into the aspect before pulling it through the translucent floor, as if reclaiming something taken long ago. The crystal tower shook and thrummed with power. Decoy, Ruwen told Overlord and winced in pain as a surge of Spirit created a mirror copy of the Scarecrow Aspect\u2014which immediately dived to the ground and sprinted toward the demon horde. The other three attacking towers followed the decoy with their attacks, although the ferocity had decreased as Ruwen\u2019s current tower retaliated against the other\u2019s forcing them into a partial defense. Ruwen faced the next tower, the one of warped, partially melted stone with thorn-like spires protruding from its surface. It pulsed in a kaleidoscope of colors, out of place in this realm of greys and blacks. The air around it twisted, distorting the view, and it made him a little nauseous to look at. The Aspect of War stood at the tip of the tower, launching ineffectual beam attacks that bounced off the crystal tower\u2019s defensive shields. Ruwen used Willpower to transport himself behind War. Instantly the Chaos Meridian in Ruwen\u2019s torso activated as the Air Meridian in his left arm quieted. Each tower clearly corresponded to a different Meridian. Pen had believed that Spirit and Fortification were nothing more than a needed baseline. Like a foundation to build upon. If these five towers activated different Meridians, it meant a complexity surrounding the Spiritual network existed\u2014one they hadn\u2019t seen. War spun around, swinging his sword. Ruwen blocked with his staff and sparks showered from the contact. Ruwen used Willpower to alter the stone beneath War\u2019s feet. The Chaos Tower resisted Ruwen, but he overpowered it and the surface turned to mud. War stumbled, and Ruwen used a Bamboo Step called Folding Paper to disarm War. Ruwen plucked the falling sword from the air and swung it around in the same motion, decapitating War before the sword\u2019s protective overheating measure could activate. Ruwen slammed War\u2019s sword hilt deep into the top of the tower. Chaotic light spewed upward like a geyser, swallowing the aspect as it toppled forward. The sword sunk into the stone and the shower of light ended. The Aspect of War had disappeared, absorbed by the Chaos Tower. Ruwen\u2019s vision swam as the area around the tower hummed with new power, threatening to shred the surrounding dimensions. He decided it best not to remain so close to the tower. The next tower appeared more traditional, although the scorched stones of its construction glowed red and orange. Intense heat warped the air, and the acrid scent of sulfur burned Ruwen\u2019s nostrils. Fine particles of ash fell around the tower like snow. Drought, a gaunt figure with cracked, parched skin, did not wait for Ruwen to act. An intense heat radiated from the tower, turning the surrounding ground molten, lava rising to encase the tower in a spherical shield. Ruwen had acted with incredible speed and eliminated half the aspects already. Enough time had passed now that he didn't want to risk a direct move against Drought though. Clone to the Fire Tower, Ruwen told Overlord. A Scarecrow Aspect clone formed and instantly leaped toward the Fire Tower. It had only crossed half the distance when it exploded from a dark spear of dense Destruction Essence. Baker\u2019s dozen on the horde, Ruwen told Overlord. You say when. Sift had named this deployment and, unfortunately, Overlord had liked it despite no resemblance to baking or a dozen. Now, Overlord said. \n CHAPTER 63 Ruwen Willed himself two-thirds of the way down the line of demons. The Scarecrow Aspect\u2019s pants provided a passive called Winged Embrace which kept all parts of his Spiritual Network hidden. This made Baker\u2019s Dozen very effective as Ruwen appeared just like one of the other clones. As long as he used only twenty-five percent of his actual power, his increased durability was the only visible difference, and that took time to determine. The ground beneath Ruwen\u2019s feet vibrated with the approach of Lalquinrial's demonic horde, and Ruwen moved in synch with the clones around him. Since Overlord controlled the clones, they all appeared alive. The connection to the clones is already breaking down, Overlord said. We have another ten seconds. Identify provided information on Ruwen\u2019s enemies. Name: Lightbringer Legionnaire Realm: Infernal Type: Demon Estimated Power: Tier 2 Level 2 Class: Marauder Path: Destruction Deity: Lalquinrial Might: High Durability: High Support: Low Strengths: High Magic Resistance, High Damage, Durability Weaknesses: Holy, Mental, Harmonic Disposition: Hostile Description: Lightbringer Legionnaires are the Infernal realms premier vanguard. Lalquinrial has slowed the advancement of destruction essence through each legionnaire delaying their inevitable death while providing superb magic resistance. Ruwen controlled his speed and power to appear no different than the surrounding attackers, but he still mowed through the legionaries, destroying six in as many seconds. Despite Winged Embrace, Ruwen felt the stares of the Inquisitor and two Archangels. It only took a moment to understand why. Winged Embrace worked, but the amount of Destruction Essence surrounding him, trying to enter his cells, was far greater than the clones. Abaddon and Zadkiel advanced on Ruwen. The Archangels movements should have been graceful, but had turned erratic, their Divine bodies twisted in service to the Destruction Realm. Ruwen pivoted, swinging his staff in a broad sweep that sent a wave of disruptive force toward the fallen angels, knocking them back. Abaddon recovered first, his tattered wings flapping, stirring a gust of wind that smelled of decay and oblivion. Zadkiel summoned a head-sized sphere of Destruction Energy and hurled it at Ruwen before fully righting himself. Ruwen leaned two inches to the right, and the ball of destruction just missed his head. He didn\u2019t think the Archangels posed much of a threat, and their attacks lacked follow through, making them little more than a distraction. The Dark Priest chanted quietly during the attack, and the harsh jagged syllables warped the Inquisitor\u2019s surroundings. The moment Ruwen\u2019s focus touched the Inquisitor, he felt the Dark Priest\u2019s Willpower strike him. The air around Ruwen grew heavy, oppressive, and he found it difficult to move. The Inquisitor\u2019s Willpower charged the destruction around Ruwen, turning it into thorns that penetrated the Ink Lord\u2019s Wrap and pushed into his skin, strengthening the relentless assault on his body and Spirit. Ruwen focused his Will, extending it outward. For the first time, he experienced resistance as the Inquisitor matched his initial push. That surprised Ruwen, because he\u2019d considered the Havoc Sovereign a more powerful foe, and Ruwen had dominated that Willpower exchange. Ruwen glanced at Abaddon and Zadkiel hovering in the distance, no longer engaging since their distraction had failed. Their odd stillness provided the clue and Ruwen realized the Inquisitor had tapped into the two Archangels\u2019 Willpower like a leech. The priest\u2019s hands weaved complex patterns that pulled at the surrounding destruction. The air thickened, turning into tendrils of darkness. Ruwen triggered Librarian\u2019s Hush and a surge of energy spread outward in a sphere. The air grew heavy as complete silence fell over the battlefield, the sound suppression creating an eerie stillness. The effect interrupted the Inquisitor\u2019s incantation, and Ruwen Willed himself to the priest. The two Archangels had already moved to protect the Inquisitor and even Lalquinrial appeared a hundred feet above to make sure the priest survived. Once again, the air around Ruwen turned thick as the Inquisitor exerted his Willpower in a binding spell. Ruwen sensed a corresponding surge of power behind him and exerted his own Will, shredding the barrier around himself as he shifted fifty feet into the thickest part of the remaining legionnaires. Two thick beams, one of fire and the other of crystalized shadow passed through the area he\u2019d just vacated. Ruwen tightened his grip on the Wrathful Crow Beater, feeling the familiar thrum of power coursing through it. The Ink Lord\u2019s Wrap clung to him like a second skin, its durability decreasing by the second from the oppressive energy around him. Losing the clones, Overlord said. Ruwen entered Last Breath. The Destruction Realm had finally eaten through the connection Overlord used to control the Scarecrow Aspect clones. Ruwen hated not having a status bar that quantified his Willpower. Even an estimation like Lir had done for his Mental Energy would\u2019ve been valuable. It made it hard for him to plan. He knew he should be cautious and buy time for his internal search parties to find the Scarecrow Aspect. Honestly though, Ruwen didn't believe they\u2019d find it. Certainly not in time to help him here. Ruwen had an idea, but he didn't say anything just in case the Aspect could hear his internal dialogue with Overlord. If it could also read Ruwen\u2019s thoughts, then this wouldn't matter, but he had to try. More clones? Overlord asked. Not yet. I want to test the strength of that priest\u2019s Willpower first. Ruwen dismissed Last Breath and immediately released a surge of Mental Energy, dropping his bar to ninety percent. The remaining Lightbringer Legionnaires disintegrated and Lalquinrial frowned. Ruwen focused on the area around the Inquisitor, including the two Archangels, and clenched his fist. Abaddon and Zadkiel turned from imposing angelic guards into seed-sized blobs as Ruwen\u2019s Will crushed them. The Inquisitor screamed an unintelligible command and pushed outward with his hands. Ruwen felt the resistance and funneled more Willpower into his desire to crush the priest. Lalquinrial appeared in front of Ruwen, striking at Ruwen's neck\u2014aiming for his Light Meridian with a Shattered Step blow. The Shattered Clan was Lalquinrial\u2019s Step Clan and they had forms that mirrored some of the Shadow Steps. Ruwen maintained his pressure on the priest as he easily countered Lalquinrial\u2019s strike. The Fire Tower sent another attack at Ruwen, and the Dark Tower surged with power\u2014but aimed at the Dark Priest. Ruwen\u2019s Mental Energy dropped as he used more of his Willpower to destroy the priest. It confirmed his belief that Mental Energy and Willpower were definitely linked in some fashion. Dismissing the Wrathful Crow Beater, Ruwen executed six Shadow Steps and successfully struck Lalquinrial\u2019s Air Meridian when the Infernal Lord raised his destruction-contaminated arm in a fruitless attempt to block Ruwen. A surge of pain shot through Ruwen\u2019s fingers and up his arm. If not for his perfect form, the bones in his hand, arm, and shoulder would\u2019ve shattered. Ky\u2019s words of warning returned. The Death, Dark, Air, Fire, and Chaos Meridians appeared unbreakable in this Realm. The Fire Tower attack arrived, turning the entire area into molten shadows. Ruwen jumped backward out of the dark flames. Lalquinrial showed no effects from Ruwen\u2019s attempt to shatter the god\u2019s Air Meridian and attacked Ruwen again. Ruwen blocked the strike to his eyes and stepped over Lalquinrial\u2019s attempt to sweep his left foot. The Infernal Lord definitely had the skills of a Grandmaster, but even though Ruwen had never practiced the Shattered Steps, his complete mastery of physical movement gave him the insight to see hundreds of problems in Lalquinrial\u2019s techniques. Despite the minor issues, Lalquinrial still performed at a level far beyond a normal person's ability, simultaneously protecting the five weaker Meridians as well as the Mind and Body Meridians that gained no reinforcement from this realm. Ruwen\u2019s superior form coupled with the Bamboo Viper Steps\u2019 more refined techniques allowed him to dominate every exchange. In fact, after ten seconds of hand-to-hand combat, he thought it likely Lalquinrial only wanted to delay him. Lalquinrial blocked Ruwen\u2019s elbow and slid his infected arm toward Ruwen\u2019s neck. Ruwen bent his body using a Bamboo Step named Falling Tree. Instead of disengaging like all the previous times, Lalquinrial abandoned his defensive postures and stepped closer, continuing to shove his hand at Ruwen\u2019s neck. Tar like spikes erupted from Lalquinrial's hand, which Ruwen successfully slapped away. The surprising attack gave Lalquinrial the moment he needed to launch another spike from his rib cage though. Ruwen rotated his torso, but the spike had a mind of its own. It turned, altering its trajectory, and grazed Ruwen\u2019s hip. A familiar presence latched onto Ruwen and jammed itself through the Scarecrow Aspect and Ink Lord armor to touch his skin. Nameless tried to bore into Ruwen\u2019s skin, its tar-like tendrils sticking to him like a leech. We\u2019re on it, Overlord said. \n CHAPTER 64 The skin Nameless attacked grew rigid. A fine-meshed net made from Spirit but contaminated with Ceplotryn's Soul Power rose out of Ruwen\u2019s skin. Lalquinrial had used his strengthened Meridians as shields which had allowed him to survive their exchange. Without that advantage the Infernal Lord would\u2019ve experienced a crippling loss. Instead it had given him the opportunity to release Nameless as an attack. Lalquinrial disengaged after delivering Nameless. He calmly retreated to the Dark Priest who, to Ruwen\u2019s shock, stood comfortably despite Ruwen\u2019s continued exertion of Will. More spikes emerged from Nameless, and a cold wave passed through Ruwen as they penetrated his skin. Warmth flooded the area as Overlord, Uruziel, and Sivart fought the destructive nihilist construct. Ruwen briefly used Harmonic Sight and verified the Dark Tower had established a connection to the Inquisitor and was obviously funneling him Willpower. Nameless\u2019s attack ignited, the tar like tendrils exploding, but Ruwen's friends funneled the explosion into a narrow column up and away from him. A single breath later and Ruwen\u2019s skin healed. Finally, what Ruwen hoped for. He sensed the faint dimensional disturbance as one of the demons strewn around the island opened a portal to the Infernal Realm for more troops. Ruwen used twenty percent of his Mental Energy to send a powerful mental blade at Lalquinrial and the priest, hoping to decapitate the pair. The Dark Tower with the Aspect of Pestilence stood close enough to Ruwen that he could open a portal which he did. He stepped up to the portal as Lalquinrial opened his own portal to the Dark Tower. Just before Ruwen stepped into his portal, he Willed himself to the distant Infernal Realm portal instead. Ruwen made it two-thirds of the way when a powerful blast of Willpower knocked him sprawling, still a thousand feet shy of the gate spilling demons into the Destruction Realm. The ground to the doorway was filled with hundreds of demons, so Ruwen waved them away and they disintegrated. The attack used ten percent of his Mental Energy, bringing him down to sixty-five percent. Once again Ruwen Willed himself to the large block of obsidian, which held the five silver gate runes to the Infernal Realm. Ruwen had no intention of destroying the door\u2014he wanted to step through it. The Scarecrow Aspect would realize this at any moment, and Ruwen expected some type of resistance. So instead of Willing himself forward, he leaped. Lalquinrial and the Scarecrow Aspect understood Ruwen\u2019s intention at the same time. The Scarecrow Aspect stiffened Ruwen\u2019s body, but he\u2019d anticipated that, which is why he\u2019d jumped at the opening instead of continuing to run. His stiff body did nothing to slow his momentum. Lalquinrial sent a pulse of Soul Power at the doorway with enough energy to reach the obsidian block and shatter the gate runes. Ruwen used Willpower to deflect the Soul strike upward, and away from the obsidian block. The demon managing the gate violently exploded, some type of self-destruct Lalquinrial triggered. Blood and chunks of its body struck the doorway including the gate runes. Ruwen sensed the dimensional bridge failing. He extended a mental hand to stabilize the connection long enough to pass through. The dimensional unraveling slowed to a crawl as Ruwen\u2019s Mental Power supported the passage. His Mental bar dropped to fifteen percent, but escaping this certain death justified its use. Ruwen knew he could hold the gate open for the half second he needed. When Ruwen felt the Scarecrow Aspect rise to interfere, he exerted all his Willpower to suppress it\u2014holding nothing back. And it worked. Barely. The Scarecrow Aspect failed to break his dimensional supports. Surging with joy and relief, Ruwen prepared to trigger the Ink Lord Wrap\u2019s Bookmark ability as soon as he passed into the Infernal Realm. In just moments, he\u2019d be back in his lair within the Shattered Sun. Once again, a whirlwind of emotions assaulted him from the Scarecrow Aspect: immense sorrow, bitterness, hatred, resentment, vengeance, and determination. The emotional turmoil swirled and coalesced into a single intense feeling: duty. That overwhelming sense of duty struck Ruwen like a blow. Had he been running, he would\u2019ve certainly stumbled and fallen. Just before Ruwen reached the failing rune gate, he thought he heard a voice, so faint he couldn't make out the word it uttered or even its gender. But Ruwen knew\u2026 because the Scarecrow Aspect knew. The voice was feminine. And it spoke a single word: Duty. Ruwen sensed the dimensional shift. When he struck solid ground on the other side of the rune gate, he tucked his body and rolled to bleed off his momentum while triggering Bookmark. No second dimensional shift occurred, and Ruwen triggered Bookmark again as his surroundings came into focus. A throne sat before Ruwen, its backrest containing two large slits. Ash fell like snow and the very air tried to rip him apart. Overwhelming rage filled Ruwen. His thoughts turned fuzzy, and his vision went white, as if he\u2019d stared too long at the sun. Ruwen spread his Wings. With a powerful surge, he smashed into the throne. He wrapped his fists in Mental Energy and Willpower and pounded the throne until an attack from the Fire Tower returned him to his senses. Multiple sets of large doors opened along the base of four of the towers and thousands of enemies charged Ruwen. Once again one tower didn\u2019t attack him and based on the Aspects, the tower must represent Death. Jumping to the side to avoid another attack from the Fire Tower. Ruwen noticed more doors had opened high on the towers, and flying enemies filled the air. Harmonic Sight showed all the towers except the Death Tower connecting to the Dark Priest, funneling him Willpower. Ruwen\u2019s Mental Energy had dipped to ten percent, and Willpower didn't seem far behind\u2014although he'd know once he crossed the ten percent threshold when the area-of-effect, Willful Toll, would trigger and drain his enemies of Will. Another horde of demons approached as the Dark Priest and Lalquinrial watched, hovering a thousand feet away. Ruwen only had one idea left. He gathered up the threads of fate from the previous legionnaires he\u2019d killed and placed the bad luck on the Priest. Without further thought, Ruwen activated the Minor Prelude of Stillness. A ripple spread outward from Ruwen, reducing all frequencies to zero in a twenty-mile radius. Ruwen watched his attack with Harmonic Sight. The discordant environment slowed the advancing ripple, and that slight delay was all Lalquinrial needed. The Infernal Lord disappeared, taking the Dark Priest with him. A heartbeat later the attack reached its maximum radius of twenty miles, encompassing the entire island. The world fell silent and still, and even time seemed to stop. The connection from the Dark Tower to the Dark Priest disappeared, and every living thing in sight died. Ruwen rose into the air and collected thousands of threads of fate. Three seconds later, the Fire Tower absorbed the Aspect of Drought, and the Dark Tower consumed the Aspect of Pestilence. Ruwen held his breath, hoping he\u2019d killed enough enemies that he could make it home. The thick Willpower connection from four of the towers reappeared, arcing into the sky. A massive portal appeared at the island\u2019s edge, and demons poured out of it. Lalquinrial hovered above it, keeping it open but ready to destroy it if Ruwen headed that way. The towers around Ruwen remained quiet, but the Dark Priest summoned what felt like millions to aid him. The sky above turned black with their approach. Ruwen could reuse the devastating Minor Prelude of Stillness after a minute cool down elapsed, but it would still consume fifty Mental Energy per second for three seconds every time. Ruwen might survive another few cycles like this before running out of Mental Energy and Willpower. Slowly, Ruwen returned to the ground and found himself standing on the powdered remains of the throne. Anger flared again, but the heat had left it. Whatever Lalquinrial had used to create the Scarecrow Aspect retained a deep connection to this place. Even though it had likely gotten Ruwen killed, a small, very small, part of him admired the Aspect\u2019s sense of duty. Ruwen activated Last Breath and entered the platform around the Citadel in his mind. Only one idea remained. A terrible one. As usual. \n CHAPTER 65 Overlord, Uruziel, and Sivart joined Ruwen on the platform. No one spoke. The seriousness of the situation created an aura of solemnity. \u201cHear me out,\u201d Ruwen said. No one groaned or cracked a joke, they knew life and death hung in the balance. \u201cYou know how Ceplotryn could regenerate quickly in his own realm?\u201d \u201cAre you going to create a Divine Realm here?\u201d Overlord asked. \u201cI actually hadn't thought of that. Uruziel do you know how to make a Divine Realm?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThen no, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m planning.\u201d Ruwen briefly looked at Overlord, Uruziel, and Sivart in turn. \u201cIf I wait until the Destruction Realm invades my body, it will be because I\u2019m exhausted and out of Energy, and my chance at controlling the destruction essence the way Lalquinrial does seems remote.\u201d No one offered an opinion, as they waited to hear Ruwen\u2019s full plan. \u201cWhat if I let the destruction in early?\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cOr put some inside me and try to control it that way, while I still have power. Maybe if I become even a little bit like this realm, the pressure will ease. And maybe it will allow me to control the Scarecrow Aspect, or calm the discordance around me enough to create a portal. Even if it gave me the insight to use Harmony here, I'm confident I can fight my way out. The point is, we can all see that, right now, my situation is hopeless. Unless someone else sees a better way, I think this gives me the best chance of turning this around\u2014and on my terms.\u201d \u201cWhat if you can't control it and it consumes you like the Archangels?\u201d Overlord asked. \u201cFrom Lalquinrial's comments, it took over six hours for the destruction essence to consume them. This fight will end long before that. Plus, we all know that I\u2019m headed for failure here. They can just keep bringing reinforcements until I\u2019m out of power. This just allows me to be proactive and try and take control of my destiny.\u201d Uruziel spoke, \u201cNot that things aren't complicated enough, but there\u2019s something you should know. When we were checking the boundaries of your mind for any destructive seepage, we found the opposite. The destruction essence is actually repelled by whatever is in the scars that cover your consciousness.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Ruwen asked. Sivart clarified. \u201cFrom when Rami put your mind back together after it broke in the Spirit Realm. When you absorbed that chaos storm.\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d Ruwen responded. \u201cI should've asked why?\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Uruziel said. \u201cKholy mentioned something about those scars being fertile ground,\u201d Overlord replied. \u201cIt\u2019s where I was born,\u201d Sivart added softly. \u201cNow that I think about it, all the Narrators I know have the same origin story. They awoke on one of those healed cracks.\u201d \u201cCan we use that to our advantage?\u201d Ruwen asked. No one spoke for three seconds. Uruziel shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know how this helps, but there\u2019s a chance your mind would remain safe, even if you lost your body to destruction essence.\u201d \u201cWhat would happen to my Meridians, pathways, and center?\u201d Uruziel shrugged again. \u201cThis is all new,\u201d she paused a moment, and then continued, \u201cspeaking of your Meridians, I\u2019ll mention this even though I\u2019m not completely convinced. The location where your pathways connect to your Dark and Chaos Meridians feels similar to the cracks in your consciousness, but it is far fainter.\u201d \u201cThose are the Meridians that Uru manually connected in the Spirit realm while I was still in the womb. To make me an Axiom.\u201d Uruziel nodded. She looked expectantly at Ruwen, as if waiting for him to make a connection. \u201cWhat am I missing?\u201d \u201cWho was there?\u201d Uruziel asked. \u201cMe, obviously, and Uru and my mom and dad.\u201d Uruziel continued to stare at Ruwen. It took Ruwen another five seconds to understand. \u201cIo,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIo,\u201d Uruziel confirmed. \u201cWas he in the Spirit Realm when your mind broke?\u201d Overlord asked. \u201cYeah. Sift had him. If I think about it, Ky had him at the Fainting Goat when the Naktos assassin tried to kill me. He's been around almost constantly since my Ascension.\u201d \u201cDid Rami ever mention if Io helped her fix your mind?\u201d Overlord asked. \u201cWe didn't talk about it,\u201d Ruwen said. Sivart broke his silence by clearing his throat, and everyone faced him. \u201cSmoke means fire. Both the Meridian connection and the repair of your mind happened in the Spirit realm which we know is really the Creation Realm. Io was present both times and was confirmed to be actually involved one of those times.\u201d \u201cHe knew where to get that absorption liquid.\u201d Overlord said. \u201cAnd when I pressed Miranda about Io,\u201d Ruwen added, \u201cshe admitted ignorance about his true origin but seemed very interested in anything I discovered.\u201d Once again silence descended on the group. Ten seconds later, Ruwen spoke. \u201cIf the Destruction Realm has multiple races, even a whole civilization, it only stands to reason the Creation Realm would as well. It's possible Io is from there, and the two times I needed critical healing, he used Creation Essence to help.\u201d \u201cOf all the times to figure this out,\u201d Overlord said. Ruwen rubbed his face. \u201cCan anyone think of a way to use this to our advantage?\u201d \u201cIt's not like something you can dig up and make a snowball from,\u201d Uruziel said. \u201cIt's part of you, and it might not survive here once your body is gone. It's possible Creation Essence is just a denser form of energy but will still get consumed eventually.\u201d \u201cYeah, that\u2019s likely,\u201d Ruwen replied. Overlord continued, \u201cSo what happens if you do this change, but it doesn't work on your mind because of this creation stuff.\u201d \u201cI'm not sure, but I don't feel like I have a lot of choices here. I wish we could\u2019ve found that Aspect, so we didn't have to try this.\u201d \u201cLike you mentioned,\u201d Overlord said, \u201chopefully once you've absorbed some destruction essence, the Aspect won't be able to hide, then we can get back to camp and use the stronger shadow resistance potions we have.\u201d \u201cThat's a good idea, Overlord, but maybe I shouldn\u2019t wait and should take the shadow resistance potion I have.\u201d \u201cNow that's a difficult decision,\u201d Uruziel said. \u201cTaking the substandard potion will help you now and allow us to leave, but if you can do it by yourself and hold off long enough for us to reach camp, then you can use the much better version and drastically slow the destruction essence progression.\u201d Ruwen thought about it for a few more seconds. \u201cThe stakes are too high. Reaching camp for the better potion won't matter if I fail to control the progression here. There are just too many unknowns, so I'm going to take them. I won't have time to sift through all the potions in that bag, so I'm going to consume the potions and then place the Havoc Sovereign\u2019s Core in my center.\u201d \u201cWhy the Core?\u201d Sivart asked. \u201cWhy not a small piece from the realm.\u201d \u201cSorry. I didn't explain my reasoning. The Havoc Sovereign\u2019s Core is very dense and removing small portions will be easier to control. If something goes wrong, I can eject it. When I fought Simandreial, I pushed out my own Core, so I have some experience.\u201d All three nodded. \u201cOkay, here we go.\u201d Ruwen returned his attention to the outside world and released Last Breath. He checked his Blessing of Sacrificial Luck buff. Available Fate for Redistribution: Positive Threads: 377.1 Negative Threads: 214.4 Ruwen immediately split the bad luck between Lalquinrial and the Dark Priest, but they had retreated too far, and the bad luck wouldn't transfer. Without hesitating, Ruwen placed a hand inside the potion bag, while pressing his other hand against his chest. Ruwen Willed the contents of the potions into himself. As the magic saturated his body, multiple buffs appeared. Next, he transferred the Havoc Sovereign\u2019s Core from the Apocalypse Hoop into his center. \n CHAPTER 66 Lalquinrial\u2019s expression shifted. He recognized something had changed, and the confidence in his inevitable victory faltered. Ruwen, standing on the powdered remains of the throne, summoned the Wrathful Crow Beater, feigning that he wanted to fight. The Havoc Sovereign\u2019s Core felt like a lump of ice in Ruwen\u2019s center but it didn\u2019t hurt as much as his fight with the Plague Siren. That Ruwen\u2019s Spirit Core had shrunk to the size of a seed because of his lack of Spirit helped immensely. The Destruction Core, in contrast, was an incredibly dense sphere, the size of Ruwen\u2019s fist, and it absorbed his Spirit Core immediately. It happened so quickly, Ruwen couldn't react, and he wondered if he\u2019d need to create a new Spirit Core. Despite the bad start, everything seemed fine, so he continued. Ruwen created a mental knife and gently scraped it across the Destruction Core. A piece of essence separated from the Core and floated free in his center. Guiding the grain sized destruction essence with small pulses of Willpower, Ruwen brought it to the edge of his center. The destruction resistance potion worked as intended, and Ruwen needed to force the destruction essence into the surface of his center. A tiny Black splotch appeared but didn't spread. Encouraged, Ruwen repeated the process, this time with a slightly larger piece of destruction essence. One quarter of Ruwen\u2019s center consisted of destruction essence when the first waves of enemies reached him. Lalquinrial and the Dark Priest weren't stupid. They took a conservative strategy, attacking Ruwen with non-elite minions this time. They did exactly what Ruwen anticipated. They aimed to wear him down and then send the real troops when he was magically defenseless. Willful Toll engaged at the beginning of the fight as Ruwen\u2019s Will Power dropped below ten percent. Without a resource bar, he didn't know how much he gained, but the added Willpower helped. Once again, optimism filled Ruwen as the controlled process of assimilating destruction essence continued perfectly. The shadow resistance buff, combined with the Harmony that still worked on his body, provided plenty of control. Ruwen\u2019s high Wisdom kept him from doing anything stupid, like speeding up the process. With the newly added Willpower, he felt confident he\u2019d survive enough attacks to finish. Ruwen\u2019s mental constructs searched for the Scarecrow Aspect again because, just as Ruwen had hoped, assimilating some of the destruction essence changed him. The Destruction Realm had always appeared as black, greys, and white, but now those simple monochromatic hues had a depth and complexity that made color unnecessary. The Havoc Sovereign\u2019s Core proved incredibly dense with destruction. Ruwen had barely deformed a small portion of the sphere, but it had already converted his center and a palm-sized section of his chest. Ruwen didn't think he'd need to use much more to turn the tide here. He didn't want to absorb too much, because it would make removing it later that much harder. The Destruction Core generated a discordant area around itself that Harmony had difficulty penetrating. He\u2019d used Harmony successfully against the smaller pieces, however. As Ruwen waited for another wave to arrive, Harmony detected an imbalance in the Destruction Core. It only lasted a fraction of a second, but he focused on it. The Core felt fine to Ruwen, but he trusted Harmony, even if it didn't work well in this environment. Two seconds later, Harmony caught sight of the imbalance again. It appeared twice as large. Ruwen stopped extracting destruction essence, focusing on determining the issue. A third glimpse allowed Ruwen to recognize the fractured chords in the discordant maelstrom of the Core. Even though nothing felt wrong, Ruwen didn\u2019t want to risk any kind of accident. He\u2019d possibly misinterpreted Harmony, since it was so unreliable in this environment, but ignoring it might cost him his life. Ruwen brought the Apocalypse Hoop to his chest and willed the Destruction Core back into the ring. The Destruction Core cracked, but Ruwen acted in time, storing it safely in the Apocalypse Hoop. To Ruwen\u2019s shock something remained in his Center. The Havoc Sovereign\u2019s Core had contained a vault where the Necrolite kept his most valuable item. The circular silver item could\u2019ve been a bracelet or an armband. It was covered in dense characters that Ruwen couldn\u2019t decipher, which meant it came from the Outerverse. Ruwen immediately tried to eject the item from his center, but it hovered there unmoving. The item dissolved into silver particles and Ruwen sighed in relief. Outside the protection of the Havoc Sovereign\u2019s Core, the item couldn't survive. Ruwen ran a mental hand through the silver dust to eject them from his Center, but he passed through them. The particles entered Ruwen\u2019s body. He couldn\u2019t detect any changes, so his rising panic subsided. Perhaps the remnants of the silver circle existed in a different dimension, but they didn't appear to interact with Ruwen\u2019s body in a significant way. Those things are collecting in your blood, Overlord said. The next demon wave had almost reached Ruwen, but he kept his focus on the silver particles. I don't feel any \u2013 Ruwen\u2019s entire body shuddered, and he dropped to his knees. It felt like someone had turned him inside out. Before he could even gasp, destruction essence coalesced so densely he couldn't comprehend it. Every cell in Ruwen\u2019s body felt like an imploding star. Surely with such weight, he would rip through the fabric of existence and fall for eternity. Quicker than thought the Soul Energy that filled every cell of his body disappeared as this unfathomable destruction annihilated it. Ruwen looked at his bare arms, now black with destruction essence. Everything touching his body had disintegrated and now floated adrift as particles in a sea of destruction, forever lost. Ruwen didn't sense anything like the Scarecrow Aspect, but he collected the flotsam and held it in a mental hug as his entire world turned black. A string of bright lights grabbed Ruwen\u2019s attention in this new darkness, and he followed them. The lights collected in a cave where the destruction left them alone. Ruwen shoved the items he\u2019d saved from the dark sea into the small opening as well. \u201cSo foolish,\u201d Lalquinrial said. The voice pulled Ruwen from the dark ocean. Confusion filled him. Where was the sea? He\u2019d just been in the sea. \u201cYou could have been a great ally,\u201d Lalquinrial said. This time Ruwen found the god. He squatted a few feet from Ruwen, his face sad. \u201cThe Inquisitor thinks you absorbed the Havoc Sovereign\u2019s Core. It might explain the suddenness of the transition. He\u2019s never seen anything like it. Leave it to you to make even your death spectacular and impressive. Such a waste.\u201d Ruwen wanted to respond but couldn\u2019t form words. \u201cThe assimilation is almost complete. With such a transition, you\u2019ll be a husk shortly as your mind is annihilated. Despite all the problems you caused me, I respected you. Because of that, I can\u2019t let you become such a thing. You deserve better.\u201d Lalquinrial smiled slightly. \u201cOf course, I also don\u2019t want you to once again survive despite insurmountable odds. It\u2019s better for my meditation if I kill you myself.\u201d Ruwen looked up at the god, unable to move or speak. \u201cA small part of me hoped you\u2019d stop me,\u201d Lalquinrial said. \u201cThat you would save this Universe. It would mean I\u2019d lost my way, yes, but it would also mean I\u2019d lived my life in the truth. Now we both know, beyond any doubt, that our Universe is a dream. Goodnight, Ruwen Starfield, your noble fight is over.\u201d Then Lalquinrial struck with the power of a god, and Ruwen shattered into millions of pieces. Once again, Ruwen returned to the dark sea. \n CHAPTER 67 He floated in dark, peaceful, weightlessness. In the distance, a dim light appeared like a harvest moon seen through the clouds. The moon wandered through the sky, and he watched it contentedly. Its meandering brought it closer, increasing its brightness. Why was the moon so bright? The moon spoke, the words muffled, but it sounded like: \u201cI found him.\u201d An arm plunged out of the sky, the air rippling like he was underwater. Was the moon reaching for him? The hand neared, waving back and forth as if trying to touch him. Curious, he extended his own hand and touched the moon\u2019s finger. He screamed as the moon latched onto his hand and yanked him up into the sky. His head broke the surface of the sky. No, not sky. A sea. Slowly, his eyes adjusted to the bright light. He sat on a raft made of letters. A glowing rope stretched to the horizon, lighting up the raft and making it glow. He studied the raft. \u201cThe moon,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI prefer Overlord, but I love the metaphor. Your thoughts, Sivart?\u201d \u201cVery romantic,\u201d Sivart said. Why was the raft speaking? \u201cI\u2019m so confused,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know,\u201d Overlord replied. \u201cWe\u2019re just having some fun. Probably because of the overwhelming relief that we didn\u2019t lose you. Uruziel said the confusion will fade the closer we get.\u201d \u201cCloser to where?\u201d \u201cHome sweet home, my brother,\u201d Overlord said. He didn\u2019t understand the moon, but the raft and its sense of motion relaxed him, so he lay down. He dreamed more than he ever remembered dreaming. Strange dreams. Perhaps the moon gave them. They never seemed to end, and he wondered if he\u2019d ever wake up. Ruwen opened his eyes. He lay on a raft of letters, and a strand of energy snaked through dark water into the distance. \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d Overlord said. \u201cSivart and I are tired of hauling your lazy butt.\u201d Ruwen looked around. \u201cWhere are you? Where am I?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m where you should be,\u201d Overlord responded. \u201cTry and will yourself to\u2060\u2014\u201d Ruwen appeared at the edge of a golden bamboo forest. Uruziel let out a small scream, a combination of surprise, relief, and excitement. She wrapped Ruwen in a tight hug. Ruwen hugged Uruziel back as the trickle of memories that began in his dreams now turned into a flood. \u201cHands off my girlfriend,\u201d Overlord said, stepping up to them. Ruwen released Uruziel and hugged Overlord tightly. Sivart continued to pull on a glowing strand of rope that started in the bamboo forest and stretched down into the darkness. Ruwen stepped over and touched the rope. The raft appeared next to Sivart. \u201cNobody likes a showoff,\u201d Sivart said with a smile. Ruwen hugged Sivart as well. Releasing Sivart, Ruwen looked at the three. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \u201cDo you remember instantly converting into destruction essence?\u201d Overlord asked. Ruwen nodded. \u201cThen I couldn\u2019t talk or move.\u201d Uruziel answered. \u201cThat\u2019s because your active consciousness got caught outside your mind when you converted. It trapped you out there.\u201d Ruwen glanced at the raft. Overlord pointed at Sivart. \u201cHe had this crazy idea to find you, and I loved it. The rest is history.\u201d Ruwen studied the rope and the bamboo forest. \u201cYou tapped the creation essence Io left behind to keep you safe.\u201d Ruwen\u2019s throat tightened, and his words came out just over a whisper. \u201cThank you. I owe you my life.\u201d \u201cWithout you, there is no us,\u201d Overlord said. \u201cI know. Still, it was clever and brave. Is everything okay in here?\u201d \u201cAs far as we can tell,\u201d Uruziel replied. \u201cHow long has it been?\u201d The three of them shrugged. \u201cI hate to ask, but what is left of us? Lalquinrial destroyed my body.\u201d \u201cNobody knows,\u201d Uruziel said. \u201cThe barrier around this mental construct is holding fast, but none of us can leave.\u201d \u201cDo you think it\u2019s safe to look?\u201d Ruwen asked. Uruziel waved her finger, and the rope wrapped around Ruwen\u2019s waist. \u201cYou can all piggyback behind me. We might as well all see it together.\u201d Ruwen waited while the three connected themselves to the creation essence rope. \u201cHere we go.\u201d Ruwen opened his eyes to blackness. The first thing he noticed was that his body didn't feel right. Ruwen remained still, listening for any indication of enemies around him. The oppressive silence convinced him that he was alone. Dust covered Ruwen\u2019s face and filled his nostrils. He took a lungful of ash into his lungs and coughed. Rolling to his side, the mound of dirt covering him fell away. Ruwen pushed himself up onto his hands and knees as he continued the coughing fit. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with your skin,\u201d Overlord said. Ruwen turned his head and studied his left arm, mere inches from his eyes. The skin refracted the light that struck it as if covered in crushed diamond. It didn\u2019t sparkle, but looked more like oil floating on water. Underneath the thousands of miniature rainbows, his skin shifted from white to gray depending on how many dark, smoky tendrils twisted over a given area. Ruwen glanced at his right arm and found the same thing. He suspected the dark tendrils had meaning, their arrangements looked like a pattern\u2014or runes. Silver flashed in Ruwen\u2019s peripheral vision, and he tilted his head to look at his right bicep. A silver band located between Ruwen\u2019s bicep and shoulder glowed with an internal light. Dense runes covered it, none of which he understood. It looked identical to the band Ruwen had found in the Havoc Sovereign's Core. Ruwen pushed himself to his feet, his body not responding the way it should. It took Ruwen a moment to understand his perspective. He\u2019d grown taller. To at least seven feet. Ruwen looked at his naked body. Despite feeling odd, it had a perfect symmetry that allowed him to immediately adjust and find his center of gravity. This small accomplishment helped push back the mounting hysteria that he was in the wrong body. Ruwen\u2019s real body had been sculpted to perfection with years of intense, obsessive Step practice, giving him an athletic build and inherent strength. This body was lean, sacrificing bulk for agility and speed. A shock passed through Ruwen\u2019s body as if lightning had struck him. A moment later, familiar displays formed around the periphery of his vision, and a soft glow at the bottom of his display informed him of a Notification. Ruwen studied the area. He'd lain in the powdered remains of the destroyed throne. Despite feeling stronger than before, Ruwen mourned the loss of his Divinity. The destruction essence had consumed every bit of Soul Energy that he\u2019d packed into his cells to Fortify himself into the Divine tier. Surprisingly, what could only be the Havoc Sovereign\u2019s Core sat within Ruwen\u2019s center. It appeared whole, which confused him further. That Core had split and been inside the Apocalypse Hoop when he\u2019d\u2026 before he\u2019d\u2026 he didn't even know how to frame what had happened. Had he died? Rami? Ruwen asked hopefully. Are you there? Rami didn\u2019t respond and worry twisted Ruwen\u2019s stomach. Had he lost his connection with Rami? Ruwen didn't want to experiment with the Core until he understood what was happening. Ruwen glanced at his surroundings. The dead bodies of those he\u2019d killed with Prelude of Stillness littered the ground. Every corpse had a faint glow. Ruwen strode quickly to the corpse of a large demon and pulled the shield from its dead grasp. The glow that surrounded the area came from a black sliver the length of a finger. Either his confusion or his focus triggered a small description to appear next to the item. Name: Common Destruction Needle (DeN) Owner: ? Val\u2019dor Description: Currency of the Destruction Realm. Can be exchanged for experience, Class-tree node progression, skill advancements, Core expansion, common goods, etc. Loot: Yes or No Ruwen automatically thought yes, and the needle disappeared. The glow on the body vanished, and so did the glow on every other body in the entire area. Had he just looted everything he\u2019d killed with his Prelude of Stillness? Ruwen glanced down at his Inventory to check when Uruziel cleared her throat. \u201cOh yeah, sorry. Loot distracts me sometimes.\u201d \u201cSometimes?\u201d Overlord asked. Ruwen ignored that comment and held up the shield like a mirror. Vertigo caused him to stumble and look away. After five seconds, he forced himself to look again. Ruwen\u2019s face was narrower and longer, his features sharper. His light blue eyes remained, including their intensity, the color shocking surrounded by so much black and grey. His ever-present frown remained, and his black hair had become coarser, contained a dark bluish tint, and stuck up even more than before. He looked foreign and unnatural\u2014and also himself. Once again, vertigo struck, and he closed his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you don\u2019t have a beard,\u201d Overlord said. \u201cThat\u2019s mine, remember?\u201d The ridiculous comment made Ruwen laugh, and it released some of the tension building up inside him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ruwen whispered. \u201cMaybe the Profile will have some useful information,\u201d Uruziel said. Ruwen flicked his eyes to the top left, and as soon as he focused on his Profile, the minimized Notification appeared instead. A System prompt. Greetings Noble Saraph of the house of Val\u2019dor. Please enter your first name: Ruwen tried to minimize the Notification or access another screen, but now that the Notification had displayed, nothing else could be done until he satisfied its request. \u201cI have a bad feeling about this,\u201d Ruwen said. \u201cI just want to get back to my real body.\u201d \u201cUntil we figure out how,\u201d Uruziel said, \u201cwe need to get used to this one.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to give it Ruwen, that\u2019s my real name, for my real body.\u201d \u201cJust pick something that\u2019s familiar but different,\u201d Uruziel suggested. \u201cFamiliar but different,\u201d Ruwen repeated. Ruwen glanced around at the Destruction Realm, and a fitting name came to mind. \u201cFamiliar but different,\u201d Ruwen said again and then sent the prompt his new name. R U I N. Thank you, Ruin Val\u2019dor. Assembling Class Choices\u2026 \u201cThe system believes you\u2019re a new person,\u201d Sivart said. They continued to wait, and over a minute passed. \u201cHow many Classes are there?\u201d Ruin asked. \u201cA lot, it seems,\u201d Overlord replied. \u201cCan you see your logs?\u201d Uruziel asked. Ruin hadn\u2019t tried that before, so he did so now. It displayed a checklist, which seemed to be why this process was taking so long. Saraph: True House: Val\u2019dor Citizen: True (Shadow Step Pact) Royal Heritage: True (Val\u2019dor) Ordained: True (Unknown Blessing) House Eligibility: True (Val\u2019dor) Existing Emperor: False Verifying Emperor Status: None Found Confirming Emperor Vacancy: Confirmed Validating Emperor Vacancy: Validated Competing Emperorlings: 0 Eligibility Ranking: 1 of 1 Unique Emperor Class: Unlocked Ruin\u2019s displays flickered. Another Notification appeared. \n CHAPTER 68 The Notification filled Ruin\u2019s vision and contained an endless number of Classes. He used mental commands to filter the results. There were six different levels ranging from common to mythical. Each level was then broken down into the same six, so the lowest-ranking jobs were common-common, and the most prestigious were mythical-mythical. As soon as Ruin figured this out, he immediately searched for all mythical-mythical Classes. Only one returned, and it had a decidedly unmythical description. Class: Destruction Emperor Rank: Mythical-Mythical Cardinality: Unique Restriction: Race, House, Heritage, Ordination plus numerous hidden. Description: The ultimate authority in the Destruction Realm. Ruin scanned the next highest-ranking class. Class: Lord Sovereign Rank: Mythical-Epic Cardinality: 8 Restriction: 1 per Royal Family Description: Each of the eight royal families is managed by a Lord Sovereign. \u201cWhoever created these descriptions needs help with marketing,\u201d Ruin said. \u201cYou\u2019re taking the Mythical-Mythical, right?\u201d Overlord asked. \u201cFor sure.\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d Uruziel said. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to see if something else appeals to you?\u201d \u201cMythical-Mythical appeals to me. Plus, I become the supreme authority in the Destruction Realm, and I\u2019d really like these guys working for me instead of fighting me. What do you think, Sivart?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m wondering why there is no Emperor right now. Like you said, everyone would want a Mythical-Mythical Class.\u201d \u201cGood question.\u201d After a second of thought, Ruin continued, \u201cThere are a lot of restrictions, though, so maybe I\u2019m the first one to meet them all.\u201d \u201cHow did you meet them all?\u201d Uruziel asked. Ruin recalled his new appearance. \u201cI think we can all guess the source. Lalquinrial made the Aspects out of pieces of the Destruction Realm that the Havoc Sovereign had given him. Identify displayed the Havoc Sovereign as an \u2018acting\u2019 Sovereign. My theory is, after the coup, the Havoc Sovereign got rid of the evidence by giving it to Lalquinrial. The Scarecrow Aspect got made with the pieces of this Val\u2019dor person, and the two of us combined when this body formed.\u201d No one spoke for three seconds, which was all the patience Ruin had. \u201cI really want to get through this so that I can get back up to camp and make sure everyone\u2019s okay. If I was Lalquinrial, my next stop would be the alchemy laboratory and whatever potions we created. Which really sucks because those are the good ones. Once I\u2019m home, everyone can help me figure out how to get my real body back.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s your decision, obviously,\u201d Uruziel said, \u201cand I can\u2019t argue with your logic. It doesn\u2019t seem to have a downside.\u201d \u201cAgreed,\u201d said Sivart. Ruin immediately focused on the Destruction Emperor Class and selected it. Ruin\u2019s body pulsed with heat, and his skin prickled. A stack of new Notifications appeared. Thrum! Congratulations, Ruin Val\u2019dor, for unlocking your Inheritance! The Inheritance tab contains details on how you can contribute to the House. Ping! You have gained a new ability! Name: Apocalypse Core Description: Your Core contains five slots. Ping! You have gained a new ability! Name: Soul Well Description: Absorb a percentage of Soul Power based on your level. Ruin touched his chest as a thought occurred to him. \u201cDo I still have a soul?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s still there,\u201d Uruziel said. \u201cI think the fact it\u2019s damaged worked in your favor. Your new body is ignoring it. You might have problems once your soul starts generating power again.\u201d Relieved, Ruin continued through the notifications. Ping! You have gained a new ability! Name: Essence Purge Description: Once per day, expel all foreign essence from your body. Ping! You have gained a new ability! Name: Annihilation Shield Description: Increased durability against destruction energy based on level. Ping! You have gained a new ability! Name: Shadow Mirror Description: Reflect a portion of all destruction-based damage back at the attacker. Percent increases with level. Ping! You have gained a new ability! Name: Shadow Cloak Description: Summon the shadows to camouflage your presence. Percent effectiveness rises with level. Ping! You have gained a new ability! Name: Dark Charisma Description: Once per week, take control of a Destruction Realm entity. Success and duration increase with level. \u201cThose abilities are all based on the potions we made,\u201d Ruin said. Ruin had purposefully not dwelt on everything he\u2019d lost with his human body. He\u2019d thought the name Apocalypse Core with its five slots just like the Apocalypse Hoop had been a coincidence. Now, though, with these six abilities matching the potions they\u2019d created, he knew the truth. When this body had formed, it had incorporated the things he had on him. Or maybe, as Ruin looked back, he remembered gathering items that floated around him in the dark sea and placing them in a cave where the group of lights had gone. So maybe Ruin had done this. Ping! You have gained a new ability! Name: Deathly Favor Description: All gains related to the Death Tower are doubled. Actions against you decrease attackers\u2019 reputation with the Death Tower. Deathly Favor almost certainly stemmed from the blood oath that Echo had given Ruin after he\u2019d saved her during the Journeyman Step trial. It also explained why the Death Tower had not participated on the attacks against him earlier. Ping! You have gained a new ability! Name: Dark Harvest Description: Retain access to the Scarecrow Aspect and its capabilities. Ping! You have gained a new ability! Name: Shadow Ink Description: Gain access to the modified Ink Lord armor. Some of the disappointment and sorrow related to Ruin\u2019s current situation disappeared. The Scarecrow Aspect certainly wasn\u2019t his favorite armor, but it had been a part of him for so long he would have felt its disappearance. The Ink Lord\u2019s Wrap, on the other hand, was Ruin\u2019s favorite armor, and losing it would\u2019ve been devastating. Checking out what had changed would be at the top of his list once he got through all these Notifications. Ping! You have gained a new ability! Name: Universal Key Description: Unlock the door to your enemies\u2019 death by summoning the key. Ruin raised his hand and triggered Universal Key. As he\u2019d hoped, the Threshold Compass of Fortune appeared, although it was missing the tarot card at the top. The sword had kept all its other effects as well. Effect (Passive): Karmatic imbalance (+50) Effect (Passive): Scale \u2013 sword remains proportional to wielder. Effect (Passive): Horizon\u2019s Edge \u2013 effortlessly slice through any substance. Effect (Activated): Key Compass \u2013 pulled toward selected key. Effect (Activated): Lever of Ruin \u2013 expose the Forbidden Channel. Effect (Activated): Fate\u2019s Fortune \u2013 equipped key grants expanded options to view and defy fate. The next Notification explained the location of the tarot card that had disappeared from the sword. Ping! You have gained a new ability! Name: Eternal Toil Description: Resurrect all allies within range who have died in the last 60 seconds, raising them with full health and a shield equal to half their health. Range and cooldown based on level. The sword and tarot card were now a part of Ruin, which made him ecstatic. Losing the sword Pen had left behind would have filled him with terrible guilt. The best part was that the powerful tarot card had gone from a single use card on the sword, to a permanent ability for him. The next five Notifications related to reputation gains. Ruin had gained 100,000 reputation with the Towers of Air, Fire, Dark, and Chaos. The most likely explanation was the returning of the Aspects to their sources. The last reputation Notification came from the Death Tower, which had rewarded him one million experience for having a blood oath of gratitude bestowed on him by Death. The last Notification stunned Ruin. Ping! You have gained a new ability! Name: Fate\u2019s Balance Description: Collect and distribute the accumulated fate of your enemies. Borrow a percentage of the pooled luck for personal use based on level. Skewing the balance of luck too long will cause disastrous consequences. The incredible buff Hamma had created was now incorporated into this body. Ruin wondered what had happened to his Void Band, his Shattered Sun mark, and Black Pyramid mark. Not to mention his Grandmaster Alchemist and Bamboo Viper marks. Had he lost them forever? They didn\u2019t appear when he tried to summon them on his wrist. Ruin shifted his focus to the Profile tab, and this time it opened. Ruwen Starfield was grayed out, and no matter how Ruin tried to open it, nothing happened. Opening the Ruin Val\u2019dor tab revealed his new Profile. Profile Name: Ruin Val\u2019dor Age: 17 Class: Destruction Emperor Level: 1 Fortification Tier: Divine \u2013 Archangel (Peak) Ruin stopped and reread the Fortification Tier three more times. \u201cThe destruction essence consumed all the power in my cells,\u201d Ruin said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t leave, though,\u201d Uruziel said. \u201cAll that destruction essence remained in the cells. It leveled you from Angel to Archangel.\u201d \u201cI wonder if that changed my wings.\u201d Ruin spread his wings as he retrieved the shield from the ground. Holding it over his head, he tilted it to view his back. No one spoke until finally Sivart broke the silence. \u201cThat isn\u2019t right.\u201d Without warning, the air directly in front of Ruin roiled and appeared to twist in on itself. A ragged gash formed and expanded until it was the size of his hand. Ruin\u2019s dimensional training provided no information, and primal sections of his mind and body screamed to retreat immediately. The gash opened into a grey nothingness that Ruin\u2019s senses found abhorrent, and he fought the urge to vomit. He\u2019d seen this once before, although it had been very distant and hadn\u2019t triggered such a strong response. Ruin\u2019s concern triggered Universal Key, and a long sword appeared in each hand. They resembled the Threshold Compass of Fortune, but the designs of each golem looked less detailed. A tiny wyrm emerged, and the rip in the fabric of the universe snapped closed. The wyrm hovered three feet from Ruin, and he dismissed the swords. Ruwen? Rami's voice asked hesitantly over their connection. Immense relief filled Ruin and tightened his throat. He responded mentally. Yeah. Things didn\u2019t go as expected. Rami transformed into her human form, stepped forward, and hugged Ruin. \u201cI thought you died,\u201d Rami said, the words muffled. Rami stepped away and wiped her eyes. \u201cAlso, you should find some clothes.\u201d Ruin laughed and scanned the area for someone his size. Rami pointed at Ruin\u2019s back. \u201cWhy do you have four wings?\u201d \u201cThings went sideways, but luckily my mind survived, and I\u2019m working on how to get my body back.\u201d Ruin twisted his hips and craned his neck to look at his new wings. The original primal-harp wings remained, although some of the strings were now threads of shadow. Tucked underneath his original wings, and a little further down his back, another set had appeared. They resembled the previous wings his Scarecrow Aspect had materialized, but they looked less demonic now and the leathery appearance had turned more shadowy. Complex silver-colored patterns swirled across the surface, and the undulating designs made him dizzier the longer he stared. An idea occurred to Ruin and he folded the shadow wings around himself, and they turned into a robe. \u201cFancy,\u201d Overlord said. It was kind of fancy, and it provided a rare moment of happiness since the transformation. \u201cHow is everything up there?\u201d \u201cVex disappeared. Lalquinrial came and took all your potions but didn\u2019t fight anyone, even when Sift went full-on nuts.\u201d Ruin felt confident Vex had returned to the Scarecrow Aspect, and he planned on testing it as soon as he could. Lalquinrial going after the potions didn\u2019t surprise Ruin at all, and showing restraint by not attacking Sift no longer surprised him either. At least at the moment, Lalquinrial wasn\u2019t a homicidal psychopath. He was obsessed and powerful, and now that he appeared to have regained control of himself, not unnecessarily cruel. All that said, he still wanted to destroy the universe. \u201cAnd what was\u2014\u201d Ruin twirled his finger in a circle at the location Rami had appeared from\u2014\u201cthat?\u201d Rami looked down. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure. It doesn\u2019t feel like dimensional travel at all. I really noticed it during our Realm Zipper fight, but this was the first time I\u2019ve ever tried to use it.\u201d \u201cIt looked cool, but also made me want to scream and run. Oh, and puke.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s probably the best summary I\u2019ve heard. You\u2019re not mad that I kept this from you?\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Now let\u2019s figure out a way to get my body back. I want to go home.\u201d \n EPILOGUE Blapy lay on her stomach in one of Fractal's lower research laboratories. The cold surface of the rock didn't bother her, and the smooth floor provided an excellent surface for coloring. Her chin rested on her palms, her elbows acting as sentries guarding her latest creation, which lay half-completed before her. A terribly important decision needed to be made, and Blapy frowned in concentration. She leaned a little to her left and extended her right hand to examine, for the fifth time, the details surrounding this critical choice. From its golden container, Blapy carefully half-removed the first choice and tilted her head to better read the all-capitalized description. PERIWINKLE Carefully, Blapy slid the crayon back into its holder and picked up the neighboring one. BLUE BELL Once again, she replaced the crayon, and her chin returned to her palms as she continued to contemplate. Blapy had discovered this treasure while researching the proper band-aid to place on Ash. The boy reminded her so much of Pen. She paused, considering a sudden thought before giving a small shrug. It didn't matter. It was probably just the boy performing his chakra practice that reminded her so strongly of her dearest friend. They called it coloring, and Blapy found it incredibly therapeutic. She\u2019d also discovered it was the best method so far for her to tap into the Affinity magic the troublemakers had found. Blapy sighed. So many troublemakers surrounded her. She didn\u2019t deserve such punishment. At least a couple of them balanced the frustration they generated by bringing two wonderful women into her wingspan. The Priestess and the Queen both liked to color as well, and Blapy hoped they\u2019d return soon. Maybe she should go there. She could create an art studio in their camp, and they could color all day. The Destruction Realm brought up old memories and worse emotions. Those were for her other incarnations to sort out, so she pushed them away. PERIWINKLE or BLUE BELL\u2014that was the real problem. Blapy studied her latest drawing. It, too, brought up very old memories. Memories bursting with terror. Coloring helped, though, and this was the seventeenth drawing of the angel she called Winged Annihilation. Blapy's first vision, a rare ability of her kind, had occurred when she was still a hatchling, and her only protection was the centipedes who treated her like family. She had seen Winged Annihilation. Well, their back anyway. Winged Annihilation had one arm in the air, gripping the sky, and the other lower, grasping the earth. Blapy could still feel the boundless, unending power within the being. It only needed to bring its hands together to rip the sky from above and the earth from below. Even now, after all these years, it still made her heart thump, and triggered a primal desire to flee. Blapy had spent her life on the lookout for this being. She now believed he would come from the Outerverse, and she couldn't determine if he was friend or foe. If the figure was an enemy, Blapy feared all their hard work would be for nothing. As strong as Ruwen Starfield had become, he paled in comparison to the man she\u2019d glimpsed. This was a vision Blapy had kept to herself. Not from a desire for secrecy but from a superstition that speaking of it would cause it to manifest. Which is why Blapy loved drawing. Blapy admired the stick figure which clutched a storm cloud drawn with the color TIMBERWOLF. The other hand gripped earth the color of BURNT SIENNA. The man\u2019s hair was DESERT SAND that stood like a collection of mountain ranges on his head. The tips of his hair were BLUE VIOLET, and the middle part required a different blue, and she couldn't choose between PERIWINKLE and BLUE BELL. This picture would take forever if Blapy remained so indecisive about the hair. She still had to color the eight wings on the man's back, four to a side. Blapy had just chosen PERIWINKLE when her Divine senses detected a shift in the crystal structures ten feet away. Carefully setting the crayon on the paper, she pushed herself to her feet and smoothed out her dress. A cascade of popping sounds preceded a loud crack, then all the crystal surrounding Fractal and the two semi-dead gods shattered. Joy filled Blapy. She\u2019d taken a shine to Fractal from the beginning, but the little genius had become something of a son to her, and she\u2019d missed him terribly. \u201cFinally done napping, I see,\u201d Blapy said. \u201cThe expansion is way behind schedule now.\u201d Fractal looked around as if lost. He clutched his latest favorite rock to his chest, and his gem-like eyes found Blapy. A surge of light pulsed from Fractal, and he leapt into Blapy\u2019s waiting arms. She spent five seconds hugging Fractal, and he vibrated in joy. \u201cWell?\u201d Blapy asked. \u201cOut with it.\u201d \u201cFractal see. Fractal hear. Fractal understand.\u201d Relief flooded Blapy, followed by an immense wave of anticipation. The God Stone could finally be finished. And now Blapy had a good excuse to visit her friends. That caused Blapy to pause. She didn't have friends. She couldn't afford to have them. They always died or left her. Fractal wriggled, trying to get out of Blapy\u2019s grasp and to the fist-sized pile of pebbles and gems she\u2019d brought him. \u201cTreasure!\u201d Fractal shouted. Blapy released Fractal, who immediately ran to sit in front of the pile. He began to study each one carefully, hugging and rubbing them against his crystalline cheeks. Blapy smiled. It was true. There was treasure here. \u201cNow don't take all day. You've already been lazing around in that crystal cocoon for darkness knows how long. Some of us have been working our tails off picking up the slack.\u201d Blapy grinned as Fractal excitedly went through the new rocks, completely oblivious to her. She walked over and knelt beside him. Blapy placed her small hand over the sapphire Fractal intently studied, and he looked up at her. \u201cGreat job, Fractal. No one else in the universe could've figured the God Stone out. I'm very proud of you.\u201d Fractal met Blapy's gaze, the facets of his eyes reflecting her face thousands of times. \u201cWelcome,\u201d Fractal said. He held up the sapphire. \u201cThank you.\u201d \u201cI'm going to go tell our\u2026\u201d Blapy trailed off, unsure how to finish that sentence. \u201cFriends?\u201d Fractal finally finished. Blapy\u2019s chest tightened. \u201cYeah, our friends.\u201d Blapy stood and pointed a finger at Fractal. \u201cI've updated the expansion schedules, so you better get busy. I better not find you racing around the dungeon.\u201d At the word \u201crace,\u201d Fractal went very still, and Blapy wanted to slap herself. \u201cRace,\u201d Fractal said excitedly. \u201cFocus,\u201d Blapy said. \u201cAll your racing friends are on a trip. I'm going to find out how much longer they'll be gone.\u201d \u201cSwifty, pony, purple,\u201d Fractal chanted repeatedly. Blapy pinched the bridge of her nose. Fractal loved racing Sift, the Steed of the Apocalypse Vex, and Xavier. \u201cStop it!\u201d Blapy said. \u201cI\u2019m going for them. Do your chores though.\u201d Fractal ran around the pile of gems, yelling \u201cSwifty, pony, purple\u201d over and over again. \u201cUgh, you drive me crazy,\u201d Blapy said. \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d Blapy picked up her picture and carefully replaced PERIWINKLE to its home. She closed the golden carrying case and placed it in her personal vault along with the picture, which she\u2019d finish later. With a final frown and glare at Fractal, which had zero effect on the dungeon keeper, Blapy suppressed her smile and created a dimensional tunnel. It was time to visit some friends. \n APPENDIX Item QualityInventory Color Common White Uncommon Brown Fine Green Rare Yellow Special Orange Epic Blue Legendary Purple Mythical Red Metals Bronze Iron Steel Titanium Obsidian Terium ClassSymbolColor Worker Hands Brown Mage Brain Black Observer Eyes Green Order Heart White Fighter Body Blue Merchant Mouth Red Fortifying Levels Metal Levels Lead Copper Silver Gold Gem Levels Jade Topaz Sapphire Diamond Divine Levels Angel Archangel Demigod Deity MeridianLocation Body Heart Stone Right Leg/Foot Order Spine Water Right Shoulder/Arm/Hand Light Head/Neck Life Groin/Hips/Abdomen Mind Brain Air Left Shoulder/Arm/Hand Chaos Torso Fire Left Leg/Foot Dark Organs Death Intestines Money Copper Silver (100 Copper) Gold (100 Silver) Platinum (100 Gold) Terium (100 Platinum) RankLevel Novice 1-9 Initiate 10-19 Apprentice 20-29 Journeyman 30-39 Acolyte 40-49 Disciple 50-59 Expert 60-69 Adept 70-84 Master 85-99 Grand Master 100 Level StartExperience Level End 1 1000 2 2 3,000 3 3 6,000 4 4 10,000 5 5 15,000 6 6 21,000 7 7 28,000 8 8 36,000 9 9 45,000 10 10 55,000 11 . . . 97 4,753,000 98 98 4,851,000 99 99 4,950,000 100 100 5,050,000 101 \n GLOSSARY Abaddon A disciple of Pen's who joined Pen, Miranda, and Kholy on an investigation of the Darkness.

I continue to be so grateful, despite how busy life is, that you spent some of your precious time with this series. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. This book, because of the narration deadline, created a lot of issues around time. It would have been impossible to finish this book without a lot of support from my wife, Erika. I appreciate all you do and the sacrifices that you made. Thank you and I love you. This section hasn\u2019t changed, and probably never will. My identity orbits my family, and my kids are precious to me. Megan, Zachary, Nicole, Liam, and Ethan. You are all growing up too fast, and I wish I could stop time. I love you all so much, and I\u2019m very proud of each of you. Nicole, I appreciate all the time and thought you put into the series and especially for coming down from college to emergency babysit while I finished up the book. Thank you so much for all your help! Anna, special thanks to you as well for the emergency babysitting required in the final hours of my deadline. I appreciate you so much! Betsy, despite having two kids getting married you still found time to help me and answer all my questions. Your impact on the series continues to grow. Thank you for all the help. Jason, this is yet another book heavily influenced by your input. Thank you so much for listening to me and for providing such good advice. Izac, as always I appreciate your enthusiasm and input. Thank you so much. I say this in all the books, but I can\u2019t put it any better, so I\u2019ll just restate it because it remains the truth: my Patrons are special people. All the authors I know battle self-doubt and the incredible resistance to not only writing your inner thoughts but placing them where everyone can tell you how much they suck. The antidote to those people and to the inner demons that want you to stop, are the superfans of this series. My patrons hold a special place in my heart. You keep me motivated to continue. I know for a fact this book would not exist without you. Thank you so so much. Mom, thank you for everything you do. I wouldn\u2019t be here (literally) without you. I\u2019m so lucky to have you as my mother and I love you very much. \n SPECIAL THANKS The following people deserve special thanks, as their support for the series has made a significant difference in my ability to tell this story. I appreciate you all so much!

I\u2019m still struggling to find a good speech to text program, and hope to make book eleven a better experience. I still have pain in my left wrist and arm but dictating so much has helped that a lot. The narration deadline for this book caused me to rewrite my outline/beats multiple times as I pushed more and more content into book 11. Because of the time pressures and narration deadline this book became very stressful to write. The book turned out well though, so it was worth it. The paragraphs below are exactly how I still feel\u2026 I continue to feel immense gratitude for the fans of the series who support me by telling their friends and families, reviewing the books, and even financially via Patreon. It is more than I ever thought possible, and I know how blessed I am. I don\u2019t take any of this for granted, and I\u2019m thankful every day that we have found each other. Sincerely and truly, I appreciate you taking the time to read this series. Shade\u2019s First Rule: move fast alone, travel far together.

    "chunk": "otherworldly yellow fire. In its skeletal hands, it held a staff with a glowing, pulsating orb of dark energy at its tip. Identify triggered revealing the stats of the Dark Priest Blapy had wanted Ruwen to capture. CHAPTER 61 Name: Unknown Realm: Destruction Type: Citizen Race: Maelstromian Tower: Chaos Rank: Not Applicable Estimated Power: Tier 2 Level 1 Class: Inquisitor Path: Chaotic Unraveller Faction: Chaos, Death Deity: Destruction Emperor Might: Medium Durability: Low Support: Low Strengths: Dimensional Warping, Focus, Willpower Weaknesses: Harmonics, Soul Power, Concentrated Aura Disposition: Hostile Description: Chaotic Unraveller is the most common path for Inquisitors. They are responsible for harvesting a universe at the sovereign\u2019s command, and their vast numbers provide the Chaos Tower a position of respect second only to the Death Tower. Ruwen tested the validity of the neutral disposition aura of Lalquinrial by asking for more information. \"What makes the potions valuable?\" Lalquinrial tilted his head at what Ruwen still thought of as the Dark Priest. \"The Inquisitor here knows a rebirth spell to make me anew but in a form that the Destruction Realm will accept. The resistance potion is something of a safety net. The slower the process, the greater the chance my identity will survive. An hour at the minimum, but even that might not be enough. Abaddon\u2019s and Zadkiel\u2019s assimilation took six hours, but you can see for yourself that was still too fast.\" Ruwen sat stunned that Lalquinrial had provided such a detailed response. \"What about the immunity potion?\" \"The Havoc Sovereign hoped to cross some type of barrier with that potion. By killing the active sovereign, you have started a war of domination between the towers. They will battle to make one of their own the new sovereign for this realm.\" Ruwen hadn't realized the Havoc Sovereign\u2019s importance. While the fight pushed Ruwen, it hadn't taken him to his limits. Once again, Lalquinrial smiled as he read Ruwen's body language. \"I can tell you're surprised. As powerful as the races are here, they are ill-equipped, just as we were in the Material Realm, to deal with your vibrational manipulation and mental abilities.\" Ruwen\u2019s Harmony was actually broken here, but Lalquinrial certainly didn't need to know that, and he steered the conversation in another direction. \"What are these towers?\" \"For millennia, all the deities of the Material Realm searched for knowledge and advantage. Pieces of hidden civilizations emerged, and the Muses hoarded them. The Muses, especially, were focused on exploring these dangerous places, but no one expected them to uncover the complexity that they found. Six of the muses have now perished because of that obsession. Their desire for power overwhelmed their better judgment.\" It helped explain the Muses\u2019 power. If they\u2019d collected powerful artifacts and hidden them away, no one would dare oppose them. Fear of the unknown items would be too strong. Lalquinrial continued. \u201cAlthough without the Muses, these towers would have remained hidden. What are they?\" Lalquinrial shrugged. \"None of us know and the Inquisitor won\u2019t discuss it until I\u2019ve been accepted by the Destruction Realm. Who would have thought that a parallel existence resided in the very shadows that clung to us. From my observations, I think there are five ruling races, each associated with one of these towers.\u201d \"Isn't this hidden existence proof that our universe is more complex than we can comprehend and a reason not to destroy it?\" Lalquinrial smiled. \"My thoughts exactly. To be honest, I had a crisis of identity. And then I met the Havoc Sovereign who, because of my intense interest in the Outerverse, gave me a glimpse into the truth.\" Ruwen remained quiet because he was also very interested in facts about the Outerverse. \"The Havoc Sovereign told me that, in the beginning, only the Destruction and Creation realms existed in the void, and as they fought, their battlefields blossomed into universes. Those are true places of existence.\" \"And what did he say about our universe?\" Ruwen asked. \"What I had always suspected. What I had always felt. Our universe is false. An aberration.\" \"Why? We\u2019re sitting in the Destruction Realm, and I assume the Spirit Realm is Creation.\" \"You are correct. Except our Destruction and Creation realms are not part of the originals but tiny slivers. Temporary realms paid for by the creator of our universe so it could support magic.\" \"What?\" Ruwen blurted. \"It's worse than that, Ruwen. Do you know how important your precious universe is? I just recently learned from the Inquisitor how irrelevant we are. The Havoc Sovereign you just killed had long ago completed a successful coup against the previous sovereign. And because of politics that even the Inquisitor doesn't understand, the Havoc Sovereign initiated the destruction of our universe. Why? Because he wished to quickly end this commitment and return home for a bounty.\" Ruwen remained silent as he absorbed all this new information. Lalquinrial continued. \"Our universe is so inconsequential that petty political infighting and some type of reward provided enough justification to send our entire universe down the drain. How does that make you feel?\" Ruwen didn't want to believe it, but Lalquinrial gave no signs of deception. \"It upset me,\" Lalquinrial said. \"The sudden appearance of the Darkness and the realization something greater existed outside our universe had already shaken my faith. Then the Havoc Sovereign offhandedly explained that obliterating our universe wouldn't even get him in trouble as we were defective and a hidden secret.\" \"He was lying to you,\" Ruwen said. \"Why would the Havoc Sovereign lie? He wanted an ally in the Material Realm to retrieve Destruction Realm artifacts that were stranded when Pen stalled the Darkness, and I wanted powerful Destruction Realm essence to create my aspects. We were business partners.\" Ruwen knew from the conversations he\u2019d had with Tarot that at least part of what Lalquinrial said was true. The System had provided multiple quests obviously intended for different factions, but everyone in this universe appeared to get all of them. Tarot had hinted that this universe was indeed an experiment, and possibly a failed one. It made Ruwen\u2019s stomach turn. \"Why are you telling me"
