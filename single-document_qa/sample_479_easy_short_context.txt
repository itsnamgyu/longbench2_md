ABSTRACT 
The rapid development of battery technologies requires significant time and effort to conduct experiments and obtain battery 
characteristics. To address this challenge, this paper develops an electrochemical-thermal coupled model to simulate batteries, where 
the model parameters will be determined by using voltage and temperature as optimization targets. A genetic algorithm is employed 
for parameter identification and optimization. The model is validated through experiments on various battery cells under different 
working conditions. The results demonstrate that the simulated voltage from the model achieves high accuracy with the root mean 
square error (RMSE) ranging between 16mV and 34mV. Furthermore, a battery lifetime model is also explored by incorporating multiple 
internal degradation mechanisms. Validation results show that the RMSE in lifetime prediction is less than 0.0024. As a result, the 
developed models have achieved high accuracy in battery performance simulation and lifetime prediction with a certain degree of 
generalizability, allowing for quick adaptation to other types of battery cells and thereby reducing testing costs and shortening model 
development cycle.

1 Introduction 
ith the continuous development of industrial technology, environmental pollution and energy 
shortages have become increasingly prominent issues[1]. Electric vehicles (EVs) provide an effective 
solution for reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions, contributing to the strategic goals 
of "carbon peaking" and "carbon neutrality"[2,3]. As a result, the widespread promotion of EVs has become a 
pressing priority for driving the sustainable development of the automotive industry. Lithium-ion batteries 
have emerged as the preferred power source for EVs due to their high specific energy, high operating voltage, 
high energy density, long lifespan, low self-discharge rate, and environmental friendliness. However, the 
performance and lifespan of lithium-ion batteries are influenced by various factors, such as battery design, 
material selection, charging and discharging strategies, and operation conditions[4]. Therefore, the 
development of battery simulation optimization techniques and lifespan prediction methods is crucial for 
enhancing the performance and extending the service life of lithium-ion batteries. By creating mathematical 
models and utilizing optimization algorithms, battery simulation methods enable evaluation and 
enhancement of battery performance. This virtual testing approach significantly reduces experimental costs 
and time while increasing the efficiency and accuracy of design processes[5].  
However, due to the complex multi-physics coupling processes within batteries and uncertainties in 
electrochemical reactions and material degradation, battery simulation optimization faces numerous 
challenges[6,7]. The pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) electrochemical model and its various modifications are 
widely used because they capture the essential electrochemical process within the batteries, including the 
dynamics of ion transport, electrode reactions, and charge/discharge mechanisms[8]. By considering the heat 
generated during electrode reactions, these models evolve into electrochemical-thermal coupling models 
that offer a more comprehensive description of battery behavior, incorporating both reaction kinetics and 
thermodynamics[9,10]. 
Electrochemical models are fundamentally derived from concentrated solution theory and porous

electrode theory[11]. They represent the internal process, such as electrochemical reactions, heat transfer, and 
ion diffusion through partial differential equations (PDEs) and algebraic equations[12]. These models 
effectively reflect the impact of material properties and structural design on battery performance, providing 
insights into the internal distribution of factors such as potential and lithium-ion concentration. Moreover, 
they exhibit greater generality than equivalent circuit models, allowing for more accurate extrapolation and 
prediction across a wider range of operation conditions. However,  a large number of the model parameters 
increase uncertainty, thus accurate parameter identification is essential to ensure the precision of 
electrochemical models and successful engineering implementation[18][19]. 
Lifespan prediction is a vital technology for ensuring the safety and reliability of batteries, particularly 
in EVs, where battery performance and safety are of utmost important[22]. Accurate lifespan prediction 
enables users to assess battery reliability, implement appropriate maintenance and management strategies 
to extend battery life[23]. Based on the operating conditions and historical data of the batteries, lifespan 
prediction methods apply degradation models to estimate battery's remaining life[24]. By predicting battery 
lifespan, users gain insights into the aging mechanisms which affect battery performance over time. This 
information allows for the optimization of charging and discharging strategies, reducing the rate of 
degradation and enhancing the overall safety and reliability of the battery system[25]. Battery simulation plays 
a key role in this process by mimicking long-term performance decay and aging processes under various 
conditions, provides valuable data for reliability analysis and more accurate lifespan prediction[26]. 
This paper aims to investigate the simulation optimization and lifespan prediction of lithium-ion 
batteries. Key scientific issues: such as modeling mechanism, parameter identification, and lifespan 
prediction, are fundamental to the study of power batteries. Research in these areas holds significant 
theoretical and practical value, contributing to advancements in battery management technologies and 
supporting the development of EV industries. In this study, an electrochemical-thermal coupled model was 
developed for lithium-ion batteries, with voltage and temperature serving as optimization objectives for 
parameter identification and model refinement. The model was validated using experimental data from 
different battery cells under various operating conditions. Furthermore, an aging model accounting for 
multiple internal degradation mechanisms was established[27]. The validation of both voltage response and 
lifespan prediction simulations demonstrated that the developed models can effectively simulate battery 
voltage and the degradation process with a certain degree of generalizability. This contributes to a deeper 
understanding of battery behavior, allowing for more accurate predictions of battery lifespan and enhancing 
the ability to optimize battery management strategies in real-world applications.

2.2 Experimental procedure 
For the above-mentioned battery cells, four of them were used in the experiments to identify 
inconsistencies stemming from the manufacturing process. Each cell began with capacity test at low 
discharge rate, where the cell at the fully charged state was discharged at a discharge current of C/20 until 
its lower cut-off voltage was reached.  This low discharge rate was employed to prevent activation of the cell's 
dynamics, ensuring that the measured voltage reflected the open-circuit voltage (OCV) of the cell.  
Moreover, the cells were subjected to constant current (CC) discharge tests at various rates: 1C, 1.5C, 2C, 
and 3C, along with Dynamic Stress Test (DST). During each of these tests, the cell was first charged at a CC of 
1C, followed by constant voltage (CV) charging until the current dropped to C/20. Then, the fully charged cell 
was allowed to rest before being discharged to its lower cut-off voltage. Following each discharge, the cell 
was allowed to rest again before the next charge cycle commenced. To monitor capacity degradation over 
time, an additional low discharge rate OCV test was performed for every 100 cycles. 
3 Simulation optimization method 
The methodology framework of this study is depicted in Figure 1. A P2D model was employed to simulate 
the performance of lithium-ion cells, and its parameters were identified to minimize the root mean square 
error (RMSE) between the calculated and experimental voltages and temperatures using a genetic algorithm. 
Subsequently, the RMSE between the calculated and experimental state of health (SOH) was minimized to 
identify the parameters of the cell aging model.  The details are explained as follows. 
 
Fig. 1 The methodology framework 
3.1 Model development 
A schematic diagram illustrating a lithium-ion cell is shown in Figure 2. When a current flows through 
the cell, redox reactions are induced at the cathode and anode. During these redox reactions, lithium-ions 
(Li⁺) are continually extracted and inserted, while electrons (e⁻) are generated or consumed correspondingly. 
Electrons flow between the electrodes through an external circuit, while lithium ions are transported 
between the electrodes through a porous separator[28]. To accurately describe both the internal reaction 
processes and external characteristics, it is essential to develop a precise cell model. The modeling of lithium-
ion cells primarily includes electrical, thermal, and aging models, which are integrated into an 
electrochemical-thermal-aging coupled model in this paper[29].

This study is based on the P2D model, which was developed using electrochemical theory on a multi-

while the active material is discretized in the radial direction. The governing equations are solved using the 
finite volume method. An example of the mesh division is shown in Figure 3, where the cathode and anode 
are each divided into four grids, the separator into three grids, and the active material into six radial grids[30].

The Butler–Volmer equation, which describes the kinetics of the electrochemical reactions, is expressed 
as follows 
𝑗𝐼𝐶= 𝑎𝑠𝑖0 {exp [𝑎𝑎𝐹
𝑅𝑢𝑇(𝜂−𝑅𝑓
𝑎𝑠
𝑗𝐿𝑖)] −exp [𝑎𝑐𝐹
𝑅𝑢𝑇(𝜂−𝑅𝑓
𝑎𝑠

(16) 
where 𝑗𝐼𝐶 represents the volumetric current density of the reaction, 𝑎𝑠 is the specific surface area per unit 
volume of the electrode, 𝑖0 is the exchange current density, 𝑎𝑎 and 𝑎𝑐 are the anodic and cathodic transfer 
coefficients (typically set to 0.5), 𝑇 is the temperature, and 𝑅𝑓 is the film resistance on the surface of the active 
material particles, which reflects the reduction in the driving force of the overpotential. The volumetric 
current density of the electrochemical reaction, 𝑗𝐿𝑖 , includes the side reaction current, can be calculated by 
𝑗𝐿𝑖= 𝑗𝐼𝐶+ 𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑠 
(17) 
where 𝑖𝑠 is the current density of the side reactions. If no side reactions occur, 𝑖𝑠= 0。 
The exchange current density 𝑖0 reflects the difficulty of the electrode reaction and is a function of the 
lithium-ion concentrations in the liquid phase, solid phase, and at the solid-liquid interface. It is given by 
𝑗𝐿𝑖= 𝑗𝐼𝐶+ 𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑠 
(18) 
where  𝑐𝑒 is the lithium-ion concentration in the liquid phase, 𝑐𝑠,𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the maximum lithium-ion 
concentration in the solid phase, and 𝑐𝑠,𝑒 is the lithium-ion concentration at the solid-liquid interface. 
The terminal voltage of the cell, which is the potential difference between the cathode and anode current 
collectors, is calculated by 
𝑉= ∅𝑠|𝑥=𝐿−∅𝑠|𝑥=0 −𝑅𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑡

current collector, 0 denotes the position of the interface between the anode and the current collector, 𝑅𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑡 
is the contact resistance, and A is the area of the current collector. 
 
3.1.2 Thermal model 
The thermal model is governed by the energy conservation equation, which is expressed as 
𝐶𝑝
𝑑𝑇
𝑑𝑡= −ℎ𝐴𝑠(𝑇−𝑇
∞) + 𝑞𝑖+ 𝑞𝑗+ 𝑞𝑟+ 𝑞𝑐 
(20) 
where 𝑇 represents the cell temperature, 𝐶𝑝 is the specific heat capacity, h is the convective heat transfer 
coefficient between the cell and the cooling medium,𝐴𝑠 is the heat exchange area of the cell, and 𝑇
∞ denotes 
the temperature of the cooling medium. The terms 𝑞𝑖 , 𝑞𝑗 , 𝑞𝑟 and 𝑞𝑐 correspond to the reaction heat, Joule 
heat, reversible entropy heat, and contact resistance heat, respectively. 
The sum of reaction heat and Joule heat is given by: 
𝑞𝑖+ 𝑞𝑗= 𝐴∫𝑗(∅𝑠−∅𝑒−𝑈)

(21) 
The expression for reversible entropy heat is:

𝜕𝑇) 𝐼 
(22) 
where 
𝜕𝑈
𝜕𝑇 represents the entropy heat coefficient, which is defined as a function of the lithium-ion 
stoichiometric ratio. 
The expression for contact resistance heat is: 
𝑞𝑐= 𝐼2 𝑅𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑡
𝐴
 
(23) 
To enhance the accuracy of the model under varying temperatures, the temperature dependence of the 
model parameters can be adjusted using the Arrhenius equation. This adjustment improves the model's 
performance across a wide range of temperatures. The factors influenced by temperature include the effects 
on the solid-phase diffusion coefficient of the cell's positive and negative electrodes, the exchange current 
density, and the lithium-ion diffusion rate. The Arrhenius equation is expressed as:  
𝜑= 𝜑𝑟𝑒𝑓exp [𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑡
𝜑
𝑅( 1

𝑇)] 
(24) 
where 𝜑 represents the parameter value at the current temperature 𝑇. 𝜑𝑟𝑒𝑓 is the parameter value at the

reference temperature 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓 (typically set to 25°). C𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑡
𝜑 is the activation energy that reflects the sensitivity of 
the parameter to temperature changes. Temperature also affects the equilibrium potential of the electrodes. 
At a constant temperature, the equilibrium potential is a function of the lithium-ion stoichiometric number. 
Since both temperature and stoichiometric effects on the equilibrium potential significantly increases 
computational complexity, for simplification the entropy heat coefficient can be used to adjust the 
equilibrium potential of both the positive and negative electrodes: 
𝑈𝑂𝐶𝑉(𝑇) = 𝑈𝑂𝐶𝑉,𝑟𝑒𝑓+ (𝑇−𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓) (𝜕𝑈
𝜕𝑇)|𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓 
(25) 
where 𝑈𝑂𝐶𝑉,𝑟𝑒𝑓 is the equilibrium potential at the reference temperature 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓. 
 
3.1.3 Electrochemical-thermal coupling model 
The performance and aging of lithium-ion cells are highly sensitive to temperature. At low temperatures, 
the diffusion process slows down, reducing cell performance. Under extreme high temperature, aging 
accelerates, and also the cell faces safety risks such as thermal runaway[31]. Therefore, an electrochemical 
model coupled with thermal effects is crucial for predicting cell performance, aging, and safety[32]. 
The electrochemical model allows for the calculation of lithium-ion cell reactions under constant 
temperature conditions. The thermal model can compute heat generation and temperature rise during cell 
operation[33]. Since the reaction rates in the electrochemical system vary with temperature, the core of 
electrochemical-thermal coupling is the adjustment of electrochemical model parameters as temperature 
changes. When the model parameters are adjusted based on temperature, the cell's operating characteristics 
will change, which in turn will lead to the alteration in the rate of heat generation[34]. 
Thus, the electrochemical-thermal coupling model is developed based on the interaction between 
electrochemical reactions and heat generation. By solving the mass, charge, and energy conservation 
equations, along with electrochemical kinetics, the model computes lithium-ion concentrations in both the 
solid and liquid phases, potentials in the solid and liquid phases, the volumetric current density of 
electrochemical reactions, and cell temperature[35]. 
 
3.1.4 Aging model 
The performance of lithium-ion batteries degrades gradually with the increase in charge-discharge 
cycles. The aging of lithium-ion batteries is primarily caused by physical factors such as thermal and 
mechanical stress, as well as chemical factors including side reactions within the cell[36]. The aging 
mechanisms can be classified into two major categories: Loss of Lithium Inventory (LLI) and Loss of Active 
Material (LAM)[37]. LLI is primarily driven by the growth of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer[38], 
electrolyte decomposition, and lithium plating side reactions, whereas LAM results mainly from the 
exfoliation of graphite in the anode, particle cracking, and the increase in resistance due to corrosion of the 
current collectors. This study considers three aging mechanisms: SEI layer growth on the anode, Cathode 
Electrolyte Interphase (CEI) layer growth on the cathode, and the loss of active material from both 
electrodes[39]. 
The rate equation for SEI layer growth is expressed as: 
𝑗𝑆𝐸𝐼= −𝑎𝑠𝑖0,𝑆𝐸𝐼exp [−𝑎𝑐,𝑆𝐸𝐼𝐹
𝑅𝑇
(∅𝑠−∅𝑒−𝑈𝑆𝐸𝐼−𝑗𝐿𝑖
𝑎𝑠
𝑅𝑆𝐸𝐼)] 
(26) 
where 𝑗𝑆𝐸𝐼 is the volumetric current density of the SEI layer reaction, 𝑎𝑐,𝑆𝐸𝐼 is the charge transfer coefficient 
of the SEI reaction, with a default value of 0.5, 𝑈𝑆𝐸𝐼 is the equilibrium potential of the SEI reaction (default 
value: 0.4 V), 𝑅𝑆𝐸𝐼 is the product of the internal resistance of the SEI layer and its surface area, and 𝑖0,𝑆𝐸𝐼 is 
the exchange current density, which is a function of the Ethylene Carbonate (EC) concentration at the reaction 
surface, given by: 
𝑖0,𝑆𝐸𝐼= 𝐹𝑘0,𝑆𝐸𝐼𝑐𝐸𝐶
𝑠 
(27) 
where 𝑘0,𝑆𝐸𝐼 is the rate constant of the SEI reaction, and 𝑐𝐸𝐶
𝑠 is the concentration of EC at the reaction surface. 
For the EC to participate in the SEI reaction, it must diffuse through the SEI layer to reach the reaction 
interface. The diffusion equation describing the radial distribution of EC concentration within the active 
particles is given by: 
𝜕𝑐𝐸𝐶

where 𝐷𝐸𝐶
𝑒𝑓𝑓 is the effective diffusion coefficient of EC in the SEI layer, accounting for the SEI porosity 
correction as follows: 
𝐷𝐸𝐶
𝑒𝑓𝑓= 𝐷𝐸𝐶(𝜀𝑆𝐸𝐼)𝑛 
(29) 
where  𝜀𝑆𝐸𝐼 is the porosity of the SEI layer (default value: 0.03), 𝑛 is the Bruggeman exponent, and 𝐷𝐸𝐶 is the 
diffusion coefficient of EC in the solid phase of the SEI layer, which can be adjusted according to the Arrhenius 
equation to account for temperature variations. 
The SEI layer forms on the surface of anode particles, which are assumed to be spherical. Under the 
assumption that the surface film is uniformly distributed in the thickness direction, the expression for SEI 
layer thickness is given by: 
𝑑𝛿𝑆𝐸𝐼
𝑑𝑡
= −𝑗𝑆𝐸𝐼
2𝐹𝑎𝑠
𝑀𝑆𝐸𝐼
𝜌𝑆𝐸𝐼
 
(30) 
where 𝛿𝑆𝐸𝐼 is the thickness of the SEI layer, 𝑀𝑆𝐸𝐼 is the molar mass of the SEI layer (default value: 162 g/mol), 
and 𝜌𝑆𝐸𝐼 is the density of the SEI layer (default value: 1.69 g/cm³). 
The expression for the resistance of the SEI layer is: 
𝑅𝑆𝐸𝐼= 𝛿𝑆𝐸𝐼
𝑘𝑆𝐸𝐼
𝑒𝑓𝑓 
(31) 
where 𝑘𝐸𝐶
𝑒𝑓𝑓 is the effective ionic conductivity through the electrolyte in the SEI layer, which accounts for the 
porosity correction, expressed as: 
𝑘𝑆𝐸𝐼
𝑒𝑓𝑓= 𝑘𝑆𝐸𝐼(𝜀𝑆𝐸𝐼)1.5#(32) 
(32) 
The reaction rate for the CEI layer on the cathode is expressed as:  
𝐽𝑠,𝐶= 𝑘𝑠,𝐶𝑐𝐸𝐶,𝑠𝑐𝐿𝑖(𝑁𝑖,𝐶𝑜)𝑂2 
(33) 
where 𝐽𝑠,𝐶 is the reaction rate per unit area (in mol/s/m²), 𝑘𝑠,𝐶 is the reaction rate constant, which can be 
temperature-dependent and follow the Arrhenius equation. 𝑐𝐸𝐶,𝑠 is the EC concentration on the surface of the 
cathode's active particles, and 𝑐𝐿𝑖(𝑁𝑖,𝐶𝑜)𝑂2 represents the molar concentration of the active material in the 
cathode. The loss rate of the active material is given by  
𝑑𝜀𝐿𝑖(𝑁𝑖,𝐶𝑜)𝑂2
𝑑𝑡
= −
𝑎𝑠𝐽𝑠,𝐶
𝑐𝐿𝑖(𝑁𝑖,𝐶𝑜)𝑂2
 
(34) 
where 𝜀𝐿𝑖(𝑁𝑖,𝐶𝑜)𝑂2 denotes the volume fraction of active material in the electrode. The depletion of active 
material leads to a decrease in cell capacity. The change in CEI layer thickness is described by 
𝑑𝛿𝐶𝐸𝐼
𝑑𝑡
= −𝐽𝑠,𝐶
𝑀𝐶𝐸𝐼
𝜌𝐶𝐸𝐼
 
(35) 
where 𝛿𝐶𝐸𝐼 is the thickness of the CEI layer, 𝑀𝐶𝐸𝐼 is the molar mass of the CEI layer (default value: 162 g/mol), 
and 𝜌𝐶𝐸𝐼 is the density of the CEI layer (default value: 1.69 g/cm³). The expression for the resistance of the 
CEI layer is similar to that of the SEI layer, with the porosity of the CEI layer defaulted to be 0.02. 
During the lithium-ion intercalation and deintercalation processes, the active materials undergo volume 
and structural changes. These changes generate mechanical stress within a cell, which can lead to cracking 
or structural damage over time and thus the gradual separation of active materials in both the cathode and 
anode during cycling. As a result, the reduction in active material leads to a loss of lithium inventory, 
contributing to a decrease in cell capacity. Since the rate of active material degradation due to separation is 
related to the current, it can be described by  
𝑑𝜀𝐴𝑀
𝑑𝑡
= −𝑘(𝑇)|𝑗𝐿𝑖| 
(36) 
where 𝜀𝐴𝑀 represents the volume fraction of active material in the electrode, and 𝑘(𝑇) is a temperature-
dependent coefficient, which is also modeled using the Arrhenius equation. Equation 36 indicates that the 
degradation rate of the cell increases with current. 
3.2 Parameter identification and optimization

3.2.2 Parameter identification 
Due to the structural complexity of electrochemical models and the large number of parameters in the 
models, a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters was conducted prior to parameter identification. 
Highly sensitive parameters have a significant impact on model output and are thus easier to identify. In 
contrast, low-sensitivity parameters exert little influence on the output, making them difficult to determine 
through parameter identification. By focusing on the identification of highly sensitive parameters, the 
precision and efficiency of the identification process can be significantly improved. The experimental data 
required for parameter identification follow a principle of increasing complexity: starting with the data from 
low current rate to high current rate tests, from normal to extreme temperature tests, and from calendar life 
to cycle life tests. 
The optimization objective in this study utilizes a transient response function, where the error between 
the simulation results and target results is calculated using RMSE throughout the simulation process. 
Transient response refers to a target response that changes over time, such as voltage or temperature 
responses. Optimizing transient response can be viewed as an infinite multi-objective optimization problem, 
as there is a target response for each moment in time. To address this, the transient response function is 
transformed into a single-objective response function through integration as follows 
𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸𝑖= √∫
(𝑅(𝑡)𝑖−𝑅(𝑡)𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡,𝑖)
2𝑑𝑡
𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑑,𝑖
𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡,𝑖
𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑑,𝑖−𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡,𝑖
 
(37) 
where 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸𝑖 represents the RMSE for transient response i (e.g., voltage), 𝑅(𝑡) refers to the calculated result 
at time t, while 𝑅(𝑡)𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 is the experimental result at time t. The variables 𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡,𝑖 和 𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑑,𝑖 represent the 
start and end times of the integration, respectively. 
When there are multiple transient responses, such as voltage and temperature, are optimized 
simultaneously, the objective response function can be expressed by  
𝑓=
∑
𝑤𝑟,𝑖𝑅𝑀𝐸𝑆𝑖
𝑅𝑀𝐸𝑆𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚,𝑖
𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒 𝑖
 
(38) 
where 𝑤𝑟,𝑖 represents the weightage of the i-th transient response, and 𝑅𝑀𝐸𝑆𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚,𝑖 is the normalization term. 
The following sections will detail the identification process of the model parameters, including OCV curve 
calibration, polarization and temperature-related parameter identification, and degradation-related 
parameter identification.  
(1) OCV calibration 
The OCV curve represents the relationship between the cell’s voltage and its lithium content in the anode 
and cathode from 0% to 100% state of charge (SOC) when no or low current is flowing, providing valuable

insights into the electrochemical potentioal of the cell. The first step in effectively simulating the cell is to 
match the model to the OCV curve of the cell. This can be achieved by calibrating the voltage curve during a 
low current discharge. The data used in this study are obtained from the voltage curve at a 1/20C discharge 
rate, and the identified parameters include the Cathode Loading, Negative/Positive (N/P) ratio, First Charge 
Capacity (FCC), First Discharge Capacity (FDC), maximum OCP of the active material, and the OCV of a full cell, 
where the cathode loading refers to the capacity per unit area of the electrode, which defines how much active 
material is present in the cathode, the N/P ratio represents the ratio of anode capacity to cathode capacity, 
FCC/FDC defines the first charge and discharge capacities of the active materials. During the first charge-
discharge cycle, some lithium is lost due to the initial formation of the SEI layer. To address the coulombic 
efficiency during the initial lithiation of the active materials, we calculate the initial coulombic efficiency as 
the ratio of the FCC to the FDC. The OCV of a fully charged cell determines the starting point for testing the 
reversible capacity. During testing, the cell is discharged at a low rate within the manufacturer’s 
recommended voltage window to identify the maximum reversible capacity. Table 3 summarizes the 
calibration parameters used during OCV calibration.

In the first stage of OCV calibration, a pre-optimization step based on sensitivity analysis is performed 
to match the OCP of the cell's cathode and anode. Initially, the cathode loading is adjusted, and the optimal 
value is determined to pre-calibrate the total capacity of the cell. Subsequently, the N/P ratio is modified to 
align with the experimental data in the middle section of the OCV discharge curve, which represents the most 
likely operating range of the cell. In the second stage, an optimization algorithm is employed to identify the 
parameters listed in Table 3, minimizing the RMSE between the simulated and experimental results to 
calibrate the OCV curve. 
 
(2) Dynamic condition calibration 
With a well-calibrated OCV curve, further dynamic condition calibration can be conducted. Under actual 
operating conditions, the cell's charge/discharge rate is significantly higher than that under OCV testing 
conditions, which introduces limitations in internal charge transport. Thus, the polarization and 
temperature-related parameters need to be identified, which are divided into three groups as summarized in 
Table 4. The first group are the parameters for charge/discharge under normal temperature utilizing the 
experimental data at a 1C constant current discharge. In this scenario, the cell's temperature rise is minimal, 
making it suitable for calibrating polarization-related parameters which include the contact resistance 
between the cathode coating and current collector, the Bruggeman exponent, solid-phase diffusion coefficient, 
solid-phase exchange current density, liquid-phase ionic conductivity, liquid-phase diffusion conductivity, 
and the pre-exponential factor of the liquid-phase diffusion coefficient. The convective heat transfer 
coefficient is fixed at approximately 10 W/(m²-K) due to its minimal influence on the results at low 
charge/discharge rates under normal temperature conditions. 
The second group are the parameters for high current charge/discharge from the experimental data at

1.5C, 2C, and 3C constant current discharges. They are the temperature-related parameters, including the 
activation energy terms for the solid-phase diffusion coefficient, solid-phase exchange current density, liquid-
phase ionic conductivity, liquid-phase diffusion conductivity, and the liquid-phase diffusion coefficient. The 
third group are the parameters influencing the starting and ending points of the battery voltages at low 
temperatures, such as the convective heat transfer coefficient, specific heat capacity, and the resistance of the 
SEI film at the reference temperature.

The entropy heat coefficient in Equation (27) represents the derivative of cell voltage with respect to 
temperature which can be used to calculate the heat generated by chemical reactions within the cell. This 
parameter is critical to the accuracy of the thermal generation model. The value of the entropy coefficient 
varies significantly across different SOCs. To ensure model accuracy and reliability, experiments were 
designed to alter the cell temperature at the interval of 10% SOC and record the corresponding changes in 
OCV. Figure 4 shows the average entropy coefficient at each SOC point.

The solid-phase diffusion coefficient, solid-phase exchange current density, liquid-phase ionic 
conductivity, liquid-phase diffusion conductivity, liquid-phase diffusion coefficient, and the conductivity of 
the SEI film are all treated as indicative variables and are assumed to follow a temperature-dependent 
Arrhenius function, which describes how there parameters change with temperature. Both their reference 
values at 25°C and the activation energy terms were identified for each of these parameters. The heat transfer 
model assumes natural convection between the cell and environment, with both the initial cell temperature 
and the ambient temperature set at 25°C. The model then applies different entropy coefficient values before 
proceeding with the identification of the first group of the polarization parameters. To identify the second 
group of the temperature-dependent parameters, the optimization objective includes both the cell's voltage 
transient responses and its temperature transient responses, with a weightage of 5 assigned to the voltage 
response and 1 to the temperature response.  
 
(3) Aging calibration 
A life prediction model based on the experimental data of capacity degradation is more practical and 
effective. The use of the transient response of capacity degradation as the optimization target simplifies the 
modelling process, making it easier to implement. Three aging mechanisms were considered in this study: 
the SEI film growth on the anode, the CEI film growth on the cathode, and the LAMs from both the anode and 
cathode. The calibration of aging parameters was divided into calendar life calibration and cycle life 
calibration. Since no current is present during calendar life aging, only the SEI and CEI film growth models 
are considered, where four key parameters: the diffusion coefficient of ethylene carbonate (EC) through the 
CEI film, the reaction rate coefficient of the CEI film, the diffusion coefficient of EC through the SEI film, and 
the reaction rate coefficient of the SEI film, were identified and modeled as temperature-dependent 
Arrhenius functions. In contrast, the reaction rate coefficients of LAMs from both the anode and cathode are 
identified for the cycle life calibration. Table 5 summarizes aging-related parameters to be identified.

4 Simulation and optimization results 
4.1 Model parameter identification results 
The parameter identification process described in Section 3.2.2 was applied to a sample cell, and all 
model parameters were obtained. The identified parameters were loaded into the model, and simulations 
were conducted under the same conditions as the experiments. A comparison between the simulation and 
experimental results is shown below, which demonstrates that the electrochemical model and its parameters 
identified in this study are accurate and effective. 
4.1.1 OCV calibration results 
Figure 5 illustrates the OCV curve over time, showing a good agreement between the simulated and 
experimental values. It is worth noting that a slight deviation between the simulation and experimental 
results becomes apparent after the SOC drops below 20%. This is primarily due to the model's high 
dependence on the electrode material specifications and the influence of half-cell equilibrium potential. 
Consequently, the model struggles to fully capture the decreasing trend of the OCV curve at discharge levels 
beyond 80%, marking the full-cell characterization more challenging. 
 
Fig.5 Calibration results of OCV curve. 
4.1.2 Dynamic condition calibration results  
The model parameters were identified with and without considering the entropy coefficient. The RMSEs 
of the identification results are shown in Table 6. For the voltage curve, a comparison reveals that the entropy 
coefficient has a minimal impact on its accuracy, which means it has little effect on the precision of 
polarization-related parameter identification. However, a comparison of the temperature curve shows that 
the entropy coefficient significantly affects the RMSE and its inclusion in the model substantially reduces its 
RMSE, indicating that the entropy coefficient is crucial for improving the accuracy of temperature-related 
parameter identification. Figures 6 and 7 display the identified voltage and temperature curves, respectively,

4.2 Simulation Case Studies  
4.2.1 Case simulation objects 
Different case studies were set up to analyze the generality and validity of the established model and the 
parameter identification results. To ensure the rigor of the case study validation, new battery cells from the 
same batch, distinct from the sample cell in Section 4.1, were selected and screened. The capacity and OCV 
curves of four cells from the same experiment were compared, two of them with relatively minor 
inconsistencies were selected in the case studies, referred to as Cell A and Cell B. 
For subsequent validation experiments, four sets of parameters (a/b/c/d) were calibrated for Cell A and 
Cell B, with each set including all the parameters listed in Tables 3 and 4 . The calibration process begins with 
the OCV curve calibration for both cells to obtain the parameters required for OCV curve calibration, as 
outlined in Table 3. This is followed by constant current and DST calibrations to acquire the parameters 
required to be identified for dynamic condition calibration, as shown in Table 4. Figure 9 illustrates the logic 
behind the composition of these four parameter sets. Specifically, for Cell A, the OCV calibration combined 
with the constant current calibration forms parameter set 'a,' while the OCV calibration combined with the 
DST calibration forms parameter set 'b.' Similarly, for Cell B, the OCV calibration combined with the constant 
current calibration forms parameter set 'c,' and the OCV calibration combined with the DST calibration forms 
parameter set 'd.' 
The calibration results for Cell A and Cell B at each step are shown in Figures 9-14. As illustrated, the 
simulation results generated using parameter sets a/b/c/d closely match the experimental results. Therefore, 
the identified parameter sets are accurate and can be used for further case validation.

(4) Aging Calibration Results 
Both cells A and B were simulated over 600 cycles. Based on the requirements of subsequent lifespan 
simulations, four sets of aging parameters were calibrated for each cell, with each set including all parameters 
listed in Table 6. For Cell A, parameters 1 and 2 were calibrated after 200 and 400 cycles, respectively, while 
parameters 3 and 4 were calibrated for Cell B at the same cycle intervals. The aging parameter calibration 
was based on the constant current discharge calibration results, where parameters 1 and 2 were calibrated 
based on parameter a for Cell A, and parameters 3 and 4 were calibrated based on parameter c for Cell B. The 
aging curve calibration results are shown in Figure 15, with RMSE values of 0.0007, 0.001, 0.0006, and 0.0007.

4.2.2 Case analysis 
(1) Voltage Response Simulation Cases 
Four case studies were conducted to verify the voltage response simulation. In these simulations, the 
aging conditions for Cell A and Cell B were set identically, with both modeled as unused new cells. In the case 
1 and case 2, Cell A was used for calibration, and Cell B for validation. In the case 3 and case 4, Cell B was used 
for calibration, and Cell A for validation. 
· Case 1 used constant current calibration and validation, applying parameter a to the constant current 
model of Cell B. 
· Case 2 used DST calibration and validation, applying parameter b to the DST model of Cell B. 
In the second case, Cell B was used for calibration, and Cell A for validation: 
· Case 3 used constant current calibration and validation, applying parameter c to the constant current 
model of Cell A. 
· Case 4 used DST calibration and validation, applying parameter d to the DST model of Cell A. 
The design logic of the voltage response simulation cases is illustrated in Figure 16. The results of the 
four voltage response simulation cases are presented in Figure 17, with RMSE values of 21 mV, 34 mV, 17 mV, 
and 16 mV, respectively. The mutual validation between Cell A and Cell B demonstrates that the model 
exhibits a certain degree of generalizability, with errors primarily arising from inconsistencies between the 
cells and inaccuracies introduced during the parameter calibration process.

These lifespan simulations employed the previously calibrated aging parameters 1, 2, 3, and 4, 
respectively, for each case. The results of the lifespan prediction simulations are shown in Figure 18, with 
RMSE values of 0.0024, 0.0011, 0.0023, and 0.0008, respectively. It can be observed that for both Cell A and 
Cell B, the aging parameter calibration based on the first 400 cycles yielded significantly better validation 
results at 600 cycles compared to calibration based on the first 200 cycles, enabling better model updates as 
the cells aged.

5 Conclusion 
This paper proposes an optimization method for the calibration of lithium-ion cells based on an 
electrochemical model. A P2D electrochemical-thermal coupling model was used for the cells, considering 
the impact of various aging factors on cell lifespan. Experimental data from different operational conditions 
were utilized to optimize and calibrate the model, with mutual validation performed for models obtained 
from different cells and conditions. 
The simulation results of the parameter calibration for lithium-ion cells demonstrate that the model 
accurately replicates the experimentally measured voltage and temperature curves, with the best RMSE 
values of 14 mV and 0.796°C. The aging model achieved an RMSE of only 0.001, indicating high accuracy in 
parameter calibration. The case study results show good cross-validation between the voltage curves of 
different cells, with RMSE values below 34 mV, demonstrating the model's generalizability. The RMSE for 
capacity fade curve validation was below 0.0024, proving the effectiveness of lifespan prediction and the
