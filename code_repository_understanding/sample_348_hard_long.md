# Question

What contributions does this code base provide?

# Choices

- A: This code base proposes a new framework MACP, which is equipped with a single-agent pre-trained model with cooperative capabilities. This model mainly solves the problem of excessive communication pressure.
- B: MACP is a decentralized framework. Each vehicle uses a Feature Encoder network with a ConAda module to encode point cloud features locally. After local feature encoding, vehicles communicate with each other through a compression and decompression channel driven by another Con Ada module. This can better reduce communication pressure between vehicles.
- C: The lower convolutional layers and activation layers compress the output of the feature encoder to achieve efficient communication with surrounding vehicles.
- D: This model can better enable vehicles to transition from single-agent mode to multi-agent cooperative mode.

# Answer

D
