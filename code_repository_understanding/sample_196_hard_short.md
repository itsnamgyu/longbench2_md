# Question

Regarding the statements about the TCP connection termination in this codebase, which is correct?

# Choices

- A: When one party is ready to terminate the TCP connection, it first enters the FIN_WAIT_1 state, indicating that it has sent a termination request FIN signal to the other party and is waiting for confirmation.
- B: After receiving the FIN signal, the other party needs to return an ACK signal and meanwhile send a FIN signal, waiting for confirmation. Both parties send FIN signals and receive confirmation before the connection is terminated.
- C: The purpose of tcp->shutdown_waiting is to ensure that all unsent packets in the sending buffer are sent before the connection is terminated, but it cannot guarantee that all packets have been successfully received by the other party.
- D: Before terminating the connection, using the Nagle algorithm when sending packets can combine scattered small packets for transmission to reduce network congestion.

# Answer
