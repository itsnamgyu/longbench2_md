# Question

In the urls method of the Channel class, what does not determine the final URL list that is returned when both credentials and subdirs are provided?

# Choices

- A: Handling of subdirs: If subdirs is not provided (i.e., None), the method assigns it the default value of **[./]**, ensuring a default list of subdirectories is used.
- B: Unknown Channel Handling: If the channelâ€™s canonical name is UNKNOWN_CHANNEL, the method calls the urls method of the DEFAULTS_CHANNEL_NAME and does not proceed further with the current logic.
- C: with_credentials Option: When the with_credentials argument is True, the URL will contain the authentication token and, if available, the user authentication details (self.auth) are added to the base URL.
- D: Platform Yielding: If self.platform is defined and not equal to "noarch", the method yields both self.platform and "noarch" as platform subdirectories. Otherwise, it yields the provided subdirs.

# Answer

A
