# Question

What inputs are necessary to create an instance of HYPRE_SStructMatrix? And what procedures are necessary to finalize its setup process?

# Choices

- A: An MPI communicator and a HYPRE_SStructGraph are necessary to create. HYPRE_SStructMatrixAssemble must be called before finalizing the matrix setup.
- B: An MPI communicator, a HYPRE_SStructGrid, and a corresponding stencil are necessary to create. HYPRE_SStructMatrixAssemble must be called before finalizing the matrix setup.
- C: An MPI communicator and a HYPRE_SStructGraph are necessary to create. HYPRE_SStructMatrixSetBoxValues must be called before finalizing the matrix setup.
- D: An MPI communicator and a HYPRE_SStructGrid are necessary to create. HYPRE_SStructMatrixSetBoxValues must be called before finalizing the matrix setup.

# Answer

A
