# Question

When testing complex comparison operations using pandas.eval() in the TestEval class, which of the following is incorrect?

# Choices

- A: Python Parser Limitation: If the Python parser is used and the binary operator (binop) is ""and"" or ""or"", the code raises a NotImplementedError.
- B: Comparison with 'in' or 'not in': If the Python parser is used and the comparison operator is ""in"" or ""not in"", a NotImplementedError is raised.
- C: Scalar Operations: If the left-hand side (lhs) and right-hand side (rhs) are scalars, they are converted into floating point numbers before performing operations in the test.
- D: Floating Point Handling: If floating point numbers are used for comparison with the ""in"" or ""not in"" operators and the engine is ""python"" with the ""numpy"" parser, the test is marked as expected to fail (xfail).

# Answer
