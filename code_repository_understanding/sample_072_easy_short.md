# Question

Which realistic factor in collaborative perception does this algorithm model mainly address?

# Choices

- A: This algorithm model takes into account the realistic factors of communication overload and solves the problem of excessive communication pressure.
- B: This model takes into account real-world problems, which are time asynchrony and posture errors, and solves the problem of spatial alignment.
- C: This algorithm model takes into account real-world issues such as time asynchrony and sensor heterogeneity, and solves the problem of time and spatial alignment.
- D: The algorithm model takes into account realistic issues such as communication pressure overload and solves the problem of communication strategy

# Answer

B
