# Question

What problems does this code base solve in collaborative sensing?

# Choices

- A: The algorithm solves the delay problem in communication.
- B: This code base solves the problem of task heterogeneity.
- C: The algorithm is built on a distributed architecture.
- D: The algorithm proposes a spatiotemporal autoencoder (STAR) to amortize the time-varying communication cost through temporal subsampling and spatial mixing.

# Answer

B
