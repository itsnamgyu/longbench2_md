New author Frank Hodge joins the award-winning author team of Bob Libby and Pat 
Libby to continue Financial Accounting’s best-selling tradition of helping the instruc-
tor and student become partners in learning. Libby/Libby/Hodge uses a remarkable 
learning approach that keeps students engaged and involved in the material from the 
first day of class.
Libby/Libby/Hodge’s  Financial Accounting maintains its leadership by focusing on 
three key attributes:
THE PIONEERING FOCUS COMPANY APPROACH
The Libby/Libby/Hodge authors’ trademark focus company approach is the best method 
for helping students understand financial statements and the real-world implications 
of financial accounting for future managers. This approach shows that accounting is 
relevant and motivates students by explaining accounting in a real-world context. 
Throughout each chapter, the material is integrated around a familiar focus company, 
its decisions, and its financial statements. This provides the perfect setting for dis-
cussing the importance of accounting and how businesses use accounting information.
A BUILDING-BLOCK APPROACH TO TEACHING  
TRANSACTION ANALYSIS
Faculty agree the accounting cycle is the most critical concept to learn and master for 
students studying financial accounting. Libby/Libby/Hodge believes students strug-
gle with the accounting cycle when transaction analysis is covered in one chapter. If 
students are exposed to the accounting equation, journal entries, and T-accounts for 
both balance sheet and income statement accounts in a single chapter, many are left 
behind and are unable to grasp material in the next chapter, which typically covers 
adjustments and financial statement preparation.
The 
market-leading 
Libby/Libby/
Hodge approach spreads transaction 
analysis coverage over two chapters 
so that students have the time to 
master the material. In Chapter 2 of 
Financial Accounting, students are 
exposed to the accounting equation 
and transaction analysis for investing 
and financing transactions that affect 
only balance sheet accounts. This 
A TRUSTED LEADER FOR 
“The book does an excellent job of using real-world examples to 
highlight the importance of understanding financial accounting 
to students who may or may not be interested in pursuing 
accounting careers. I think this book will hold students’ 
attention, without sacrificing the technical information that 
provides the foundation for further accounting coursework. 
Exceptionally well-written and nicely organized.”
—Paul Hribar, University of Iowa


V
STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS
provides students with the oppor-
tunity to learn the basic structure 
and tools used in accounting in 
a simpler setting. In Chapter 3, 
students are exposed to more 
complex operating transactions 
that also affect income statement 
accounts. By slowing down the 
introduction of transactions and 
giving students time to practice 
and gain mastery, this building-
block approach leads to greater 
student success in their study of 
later topics in financial account-
ing such as adjusting entries. 
After the students have devel-
oped an understanding of the complete accounting cycle and the resulting statements, 
Chapter 5 takes students through the corporate reporting and analysis process.
This graphic shows a detailed comparison of the Libby/Libby/Hodge approach to 
the accounting cycle chapters compared to the approach taken by other financial 
accounting texts.
The authors’ approach to introducing the accounting cycle has been tested in peer-
reviewed, published research studies. One of these award-winning studies has 
shown that the accounting cycle approach 
used in this textbook yields learning gains that 
outpace approaches used in other textbooks 
by a significant margin.

MARKET-LEADING PEDAGOGY  
“Excellent book with very good and clear writing, coverage, 
illustrations and overall very student friendly.”
—Kashi Balachandran, New York University
Financial Accounting, 9e, offers a host of pedagogical tools that complement the 
different ways you like to teach and the ways your students like to learn. Some offer 
information and tips that help you present a complex subject; others highlight issues 
relevant to what your students read online or see on television. Either way, Financial 
Accounting’s pedagogical support will make a real difference in your course and in 
your students’ learning.
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS BOXES—These features tie important chapter concepts to 
real-world decision-making examples. They also highlight alternative viewpoints and 
add to the critical-thinking and decision-making focus of the text.
A QUESTION OF ETHICS BOXES—These boxes appear throughout the text, convey-
ing the importance and the consequences of acting responsibly in business practice.
Financial accounting standards and disclosure requirements are adopted by national regulatory agen-
cies. Since 2002, there has been substantial movement toward the adoption of International Finan-
cial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
Examples of jurisdictions requiring the use of IFRS currently include:

Balance Sheet
The ending balances for Common Stock, Additional Paid-in Capital, and Retained Earnings 
from the statement of stockholders’ equity are included on the balance sheet that follows. You 
will notice that the contra-asset account, Accumulated Depreciation (used cost), has been sub-
tracted from the total of the land, buildings, and equipment accounts (at cost) to reflect net 
book value (or carrying value) at month-end for balance sheet purposes. Also recall that assets 
are listed in order of liquidity, and liabilities are listed in order of due dates. Current assets are 
those used or turned into cash within one year (as well as inventory). Current liabilities are 
obligations to be paid with current assets within one year. We present the balances at the end of 
2014 and the balances at the end of the first quarter of 2015.

As presented in the previous chapters, the statement of cash flows explains the difference between the 
ending and beginning balances in the Cash account on the balance sheet during the accounting period. 
Put simply, the cash flow statement is a categorized list of all transactions of the period that affected the 
Cash account. The three categories are operating, investing, and financing activities. Since no adjust-
ments made in this chapter affected cash, the cash flow categories identified on the Cash T-account 
at the end of Chapter 3 remain the same.
Many standard financial analysis texts warn analysts to look for unusual deferrals and accruals when they 
attempt to predict future periods’ earnings. They often suggest that wide disparities between net income and 
cash flow from operations are a useful warning sign. For example, Subramanyan suggests the following:
Accounting accruals determining net income rely on estimates, deferrals, allocations, and valuations. 
These considerations sometimes allow more subjectivity than do the factors determining cash flows. 
For this reason we often relate cash flows from operations to net income in assessing its quality.

Inventory should include all items owned that are held for resale. Costs flow into inventory when 
goods are purchased or manufactured. They flow out (as an expense) when they are sold or disposed 
of. The cost of goods sold equation describes these flows.

CHAPTER TAKE-AWAYS
End-of-chapter summaries complement the learning objectives outlined at the begin-
ning of the chapter.
IN FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING
 
7-1. Apply the cost principle to identify the amounts that should be included in inventory and the 
expense matching principle to determine cost of goods sold for typical retailers, wholesalers, 
and manufacturers.  p. 335
Inventory should include all items owned that are held for resale. Costs flow into inventory when 
goods are purchased or manufactured. They flow out (as an expense) when they are sold or disposed 
of. In conformity with the expense matching principle, the total cost of the goods sold during the 
period must be matched with the sales revenue earned during the period. A company can keep track 
of the ending inventory and cost of goods sold for the period using (1) the perpetual inventory sys-
tem, which is based on the maintenance of detailed and continuous inventory records, and (2) the 
periodic inventory system, which is based on a physical count of ending inventory and use of the 
cost of goods sold equation to determine cost of goods sold.
 
7-2. Report inventory and cost of goods sold using the four inventory costing methods.  p. 340
The chapter discussed four different inventory costing methods used to allocate costs between the 
units remaining in inventory and the units sold and their applications in different economic circum-
stances. The methods discussed were specific identification, FIFO, LIFO, and average cost. Each of 
the inventory costing methods conforms to GAAP. Public companies using LIFO must provide note 
disclosures that allow conversion of inventory and cost of goods sold to FIFO amounts. Remember 
that the cost flow assumption need not match the physical flow of inventory.

Learning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you should be able to:
 
1-1 
Recognize the information conveyed in each of the four basic financial 
statements and the way that it is used by different decision makers 
(investors, creditors, and managers).
 
1-2 
Identify the role of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in 
determining financial statement content and how companies ensure the 
accuracy of their financial statements.
Financial Statements  
and Business Decisions
L
e-Nature’s Inc. designed its business strategy to ride the growing wave of interest in 
noncarbonated beverages. And apparently its strategy was a huge success: Its financial 
statements reported growth in sales from $156 to $275 million in just three years. How 
did this small family-run business compete with the likes of Coke and Pepsi in this growing 
market? The business press suggested the first key to its success was manufacturing a broad 
range of products that fit into the fastest growing “healthy” segments: flavored waters, teas, 
and fruit drinks. Founder and CEO Gregory Podlucky said that an obsessive drive for quality 
and efficiency was just as critical. Matching customers’ concerns for the environment and 
healthy living, Le-Nature’s was praised as one of the first companies to switch to environmen-
tally friendlier PET plastic bottles and to employ safe in-bottle pasteurization. Its 21st-century 
manufacturing operation in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, produced everything that goes into its 
products, from the injection-molded PET bottles to the final packaging. Complete control over 
the whole process assures quality and provides the flexibility to respond quickly to changes 
in customers’ demands. When convenience stores moved to larger-sized drinks or school caf-
eterias switched from carbonated beverages to healthier drinks, Le-Nature’s could change its 
production to meet the customers’ needs. In August, the company opened a second new state-
of-the-art manufacturing facility in Arizona to meet the apparent growing demand.
But here is the twist: Just three short months later, investigators discovered that Le-Nature’s 
phenomenal sales growth was more fiction than fact. How could this seeming success story 
portrayed in the financial statements really be one of the most remarkable frauds in history?
Chapter 1 concentrates on the key financial statements that businesspeople rely upon 
when they evaluate a company’s performance as well as the importance of accurate financial 
statements in making our economic system work. We discuss these issues in the context of 
Le-Nature’s rise and fall.
Accounting knowledge will be valuable to you only if you can apply it in the real world. 
Learning is also easier when it takes place in real contexts. So at the beginning of each chap-
ter we always provide some background about the business that will provide the context for 
the chapter discussion.


chapter 1
U ND ERSTA ND ING  T H E B USI N E SS
Le-Nature’s Inc., our focus company for this chapter, was founded by Gregory 
Podlucky and his brother Jonathan, who initially were the sole owners or 
stockholders of the company. They were also the managers of the company. 
Using expertise gained working at their parents’ brewery (Stoney’s Beer), the 
brothers were early believers in the trend toward healthier, noncarbonated bev-
erages. Like most entrepreneurs, their growth ambitions quickly outpaced their 
own financial resources. So they turned to banks, including Wells Fargo Bank 
and other lenders, to finance additional manufacturing facilities and equipment. 
Different units of Wells Fargo continued to arrange lending to Le-Nature’s as the 
need arose, becoming its largest lender or creditor. Creditors make money on 
the loans by charging interest. The Podluckys also convinced others to buy stock 
in Le-Nature’s. These individuals became part owners or stockholders along with 
the Podluckys. They hoped to receive a portion of what the company earned in 
the form of cash payments called dividends and to eventually sell their share of 
the company at a higher price than they paid. Creditors are more willing to lend 
and stock prices usually rise when creditors and investors expect the company 
to do well in the future. Both groups often judge future performance based on 
information in the company’s financial statements.
The Accounting System
Managers (often called internal decision makers) need information about the 
company’s business activities to manage the operating, investing, and financing 
activities of the firm. Stockholders and creditors (often called external decision 
makers) need information about these same business activities to assess whether

the company will be able to pay back its debts with interest and pay dividends. All busi-
nesses must have an accounting system that collects and processes financial information 
about an organization’s business activities and reports that information to decision makers. 
Le-Nature’s business activities included:

Ů Financing Activities: borrowing or paying back money to lenders and receiving additional 
funds from stockholders or paying them dividends.

Ů Investing Activities: buying or selling items such as plant and equipment used in the pro-
duction of beverages.

Ů Operating Activities: the day-to-day process of purchasing raw tea and other ingredients 
from suppliers, manufacturing beverages, delivering them to customers, collecting cash 
from customers, and paying suppliers.
Exhibit 1.1 outlines the two parts of the accounting system. Internal managers typically 
require continuous, detailed information because they must plan and manage the day-to-day 
operations of the organization. Developing accounting information for internal decision mak-
ers, called managerial or management accounting, is the subject of a separate accounting 
course. The focus of this text is accounting for external decision makers, called financial 
accounting, and the four basic financial statements and related disclosures that are periodi-
cally produced by that system.
Why Study Financial Accounting?
No matter what your business career goals, you can’t get away from financial accounting. You 
may want to work for an investment firm, a bank, or an accounting firm that would be involved in 
the financing of companies like Le-Nature’s. We will focus much of our discussion on the per-
spectives of investors, creditors, and preparers of financial statements. However, you might 
not be aware that managers within the firm also make direct use of financial statements. For 
example, marketing managers and credit managers use customers’ financial statements to 
decide whether to extend credit to their customers. Supply chain managers analyze suppliers’

financial statements to see whether the suppliers have the resources to meet demand and invest 
in future development. Both the employees’ unions and company human resource managers 
use financial statements as a basis for contract negotiations over pay rates. Financial statement 
figures even serve as a basis for calculating employee bonuses. Regardless of the functional area 
of management in which you are employed, you will use financial statement data.
We begin with a brief but comprehensive overview of the information reported in the four 
basic financial statements and the people and organizations involved in their preparation 
and use. This overview provides a context in which you can learn the more detailed material 
presented in the chapters that follow. Then we will discuss the parties that are responsible 
for the accuracy of financial statements as well as the consequences of misstated financial 
statements. Le-Nature’s stockholders and creditors used its financial statements to learn 
more about the company before making their investment and lending decisions. In doing so, 
they assumed that the statements accurately represented Le-Nature’s financial condition.
Your Goals for Chapter 1
To understand the way in which creditors and stockholders used Le-Nature’s financial state-
ments, we must first understand what specific information is presented in the four basic 
financial statements for a company such as Le-Nature’s. PLEASE NOTE: Rather than trying 
to memorize the definitions of every term used in this chapter, try to focus your attention 
on learning the general content, structure, and use of the statements. Specifically:

Ů Content: the categories of items (often called elements) reported on each of the four 
statements.

Ů Structure: the equation that shows how the elements within the statement are organized 
and related.

Ů Use: how the information is used by stockholders and creditors to make investment and 
lending decisions.
The Pause for Feedback–Self-Study Quizzes at key points in the chapter will help you 
assess whether you have reached these goals. Remember that since this chapter is an over-
view, each concept discussed here will be discussed again in Chapters 2 through 5.

Four financial statements are normally prepared by profit-making organizations for use by 
investors, creditors, and other external decision makers.
 
1. On its balance sheet, Le-Nature’s reports the economic resources it owns and the sources 
of financing for those resources.
 
2. On its income statement, Le-Nature’s reports its ability to sell goods for more than their 
cost to produce and sell.
 
3. On its statement of stockholders’ equity, Le-Nature’s reports additional contributions or 
payments to investors and the amount of income the company reinvested for future growth.
 
4. On its statement of cash flows, Le-Nature’s reports its ability to generate cash and how it 
was used.
The four basic statements can be prepared at any point in time (such as the end of the year, 
quarter, or month) and can apply to any time span (such as one year, one quarter, or one month). 
Like most companies, Le-Nature’s prepared financial statements for external users (investors 
and creditors) at the end of each quarter (known as quarterly reports) and at the end of the 
year (known as annual reports).
The Balance Sheet
The purpose of the balance sheet is to report the financial position (amount of assets, liabili-
ties, and stockholders’ equity) of an accounting entity at a particular point in time. We can learn 
a great deal about what the balance sheet reports just by reading the statement from the top. The 
balance sheet Le-Nature’s Inc. presented to creditors and stockholders is shown in Exhibit 1.2.
Structure 
Notice that the heading specifically identifies four significant items related to the statement:
 
1. Name of the entity, Le-Nature’s Inc.
 
2. Title of the statement, Balance Sheet.
 
3. Specific date of the statement, At December 31, 2012.
 
4. Unit of measure, (in millions of dollars).
The organization for which financial data are to be collected, called an accounting entity, must 
be precisely defined. On the balance sheet, the business entity itself, not the business owners, 
is viewed as owning the resources it uses and being responsible for its debts. The heading of 
each statement indicates the time dimension of the report. The balance sheet is like a finan-
cial snapshot indicating the entity’s financial position at a specific point in time—in this case, 
December 31, 2012—which is stated clearly on the balance sheet. Financial reports are nor-
mally denominated in the currency of the country in which they are located. U.S. companies 
report in U.S. dollars, Canadian companies in Canadian dollars, and Mexican companies in 
Mexican pesos. Le-Nature’s statements report in millions of dollars. That is, they round the last 
six digits to the nearest million dollars. The listing of Cash $10.6 on Le-Nature’s balance sheet 
actually means $10,600,000.
Notice that Le-Nature’s balance sheet has three major captions: assets, liabilities, and stock-
holders’ equity. The basic accounting equation, often called the balance sheet equation, 
explains their relationship:

Stockholders’ Equity

The basic accounting equation shows what we mean when we refer to a company’s financial 
position: the economic resources that the company owns and the sources of financing for those 
resources.
Elements
Assets are the economic resources owned by the entity. Le-Nature’s lists four items under 
the category Assets. The exact items listed as assets on a company’s balance sheet depend 
on the nature of its operations. But these are common names used by many companies. 
The four items listed by Le-Nature’s are the economic resources needed to manufacture 
and sell beverages to retailers and vending companies. Each of these economic resources 
is expected to provide future benefits to the firm. To prepare to manufacture the bever-
ages, Le-Nature’s first needed cash to purchase land on which to build factories and 
install production machinery (property, plant, and equipment). Le-Nature’s then began 
purchasing ingredients and producing beverages, which led to the balance assigned to 
inventories. When Le-Nature’s sells its beverages to grocery stores and others, it sells 
them on credit and receives promises to pay called accounts receivable, which are col-
lected in cash later.
Every asset on the balance sheet is initially measured at the total cost incurred to acquire 
it. Balance sheets do not generally show the amounts for which the assets could currently 
be sold.
Liabilities and stockholders’ equity are the sources of financing for the compa-
ny’s economic resources. Liabilities indicate the amount of financing provided by 
creditors. They are the company’s debts or obligations. Under the category Liabilities, 
Le-Nature’s lists two items. The accounts payable arise from the purchase of goods

or services from suppliers on credit without a formal written contract (or a note). The 
notes payable to banks result from cash borrowings based on a formal written debt con-
tract with banks.
Stockholders’ equity indicates the amount of financing provided by owners of the busi-
ness and reinvested earnings.1 The investment of cash and other assets in the business by 
the stockholders is called common stock. The amount of earnings (profits) reinvested in the 
business (and thus not distributed to stockholders in the form of dividends) is called retained 
earnings.
In Exhibit 1.2, the Stockholders’ Equity section reports two items. The founders and other 
stockholders’ investment of $55.7 million is reported as common stock. Le-Nature’s total earn-
ings (or losses incurred) less all dividends paid to the stockholders since formation of the cor-
poration equals $64 million and is reported as retained earnings. Total stockholders’ equity is 
the sum of the common stock plus the retained earnings.
Assessment of Le-Nature’s assets was important to its creditors, Wells Fargo Bank and others, and its 
stockholders because assets provide a basis for judging whether the company has sufficient resources 
available to operate. Assets are also important because they could be sold for cash in the event that 
Le-Nature’s went out of business.
Le-Nature’s debts are important because creditors and stockholders are concerned about whether the 
company has sufficient sources of cash to pay its debts. Le-Nature’s debts were also relevant to Wells 
Fargo Bank’s decision to lend money to the company because existing creditors share its claim against 
Le-Nature’s assets. If a business does not pay its creditors, the creditors may force the sale of assets suf-
ficient to meet their claims. The sale of assets often fails to cover all of a company’s debts, and some 
creditors may take a loss.
Le-Nature’s stockholders’ equity is important to Wells Fargo Bank because creditors’ claims legally 
come before those of owners. If Le-Nature’s goes out of business and its assets are sold, the proceeds of 
that sale must be used to pay back creditors before the stockholders receive any money. Thus, creditors 
consider stockholders’ equity a protective “cushion.”

1A corporation is a business that is incorporated under the laws of a particular state. The owners are called 
stockholders or shareholders. Ownership is represented by shares of capital stock that usually can be bought and 
sold freely. The corporation operates as a separate legal entity, separate and apart from its owners. The stockholders 
enjoy limited liability; they are liable for the debts of the corporation only to the extent of their investments. Chapter 
Supplement A discusses forms of ownership in more detail.

We just learned the balance sheet is a statement of financial position that reports dollar amounts for 
a company’s assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity at a specific point in time. These elements are 
related in the basic accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity. Before you 
move on, complete the following questions to test your understanding of these concepts.

The Income Statement
Structure
The income statement (statement of income, statement of earnings, statement of operations, 
statement of comprehensive income2) reports the accountant’s primary measure of perfor-
mance of a business, revenues less expenses during the accounting period. While the term 
profit is used widely for this measure of performance, accountants prefer to use the technical 
terms net income or net earnings. Le-Nature’s net income measures its success in selling bev-
erages for more than the cost to generate those sales.
A quick reading of Le-Nature’s income statement (Exhibit 1.3) indicates a great deal about 
its purpose and content. The heading identifies the name of the entity, the title of the report, 
and the unit of measure used in the statement. Unlike the balance sheet, however, which reports 
as of a certain date, the income statement reports for a specified period of time (for the year 
ended December 31, 2012). The time period covered by the financial statements (one year 
in this case) is called an accounting period. Notice that Le-Nature’s income statement has 
three major captions: revenues, expenses, and net income. The income statement equation that 
describes their relationship is:
Revenues
−
Expenses
=
Net Income
(Cash and promises received from 
delivery of goods and services)
(Resources used to earn 
period’s revenues)
(Revenues earned minus 
expenses incurred)
Elements
Companies earn revenues from the sale of goods or services to customers (in Le-Nature’s 
case, from the sale of beverages). Revenues normally are amounts expected to be received for 
goods or services that have been delivered to a customer, whether or not the customer has 
paid for the goods or services. Retail stores such as Walmart and McDonald’s often receive 
cash from consumers at the time of sale. However, when Le-Nature’s delivers its beverages to 
retail stores, it receives a promise of future payment called an account receivable, which later is

collected in cash. In either case, the business recognizes total sales (cash and credit) as revenue 
for the period. Various terms are used in income statements to describe different sources of rev-
enue (e.g., provision of services, sale of goods, rental of property). Le-Nature’s lists only one, 
sales revenue, in its income statement.
Expenses represent the dollar amount of resources the entity used to earn revenues during the 
period. Expenses reported in one accounting period may actually be paid for in another accounting 
period. Some expenses require the payment of cash immediately while others require payment at 
a later date. Some may also require the use of another resource, such as an inventory item, which 
may have been paid for in a prior period. Le-Nature’s lists four types of expenses on its income 
statement, which are described in Exhibit 1.3. These expenses include income tax expense, which, 
as a corporation, Le-Nature’s must pay on the subtotal income before income taxes.
Net income or net earnings (often called “the bottom line”) is the excess of total revenues 
over total expenses. If total expenses exceed total revenues, a net loss is reported.3 We noted 
earlier that revenues are not necessarily the same as collections from customers and expenses 
are not necessarily the same as payments to suppliers. As a result, net income normally does 
not equal the net cash generated by operations. This latter amount is reported on the cash flow 
statement discussed later in this chapter.
Investors and creditors such as Wells Fargo Bank closely monitor a firm’s net income because it indi-
cates the firm’s ability to sell goods and services for more than they cost to produce and deliver. Investors 
buy stock when they believe that future earnings will improve and lead to dividends and the ability to 
sell their stock for more than they paid. Lenders also rely on future earnings to provide the resources to 
repay loans. The details of the statement also are important. For example, Le-Nature’s had to sell more 
than $275 million worth of beverages to make just under $23 million. If a competitor were to lower prices 
just 10 percent, forcing Le-Nature’s to do the same, its net income could easily turn into a net loss. These 
factors and others help investors and creditors estimate the company’s future earnings.

Statement of Stockholders’ Equity
Structure
Le-Nature’s prepares a separate statement of stockholders’ equity, shown in Exhibit 1.4. 
The heading identifies the name of the entity, the title of the report, and the unit of measure 
used in the statement. Like the income statement, the statement of stockholders’ equity cov-
ers a specified period of time (the accounting period), which in this case is one year. The 
statement reports the changes in each of the company’s stockholders’ equity accounts during 
that period.
Le-Nature’s had no changes in common stock during the period. Had it issued or repur-
chased common stock during the year, the transactions would be reported on separate lines. 
The retained earnings column reports the way that net income and the distribution of div-
idends affected the company’s financial position during the accounting period. Net income 
earned during the year increases the balance of retained earnings, showing the relationship of

Reinvestment of earnings, or retained earnings, is an important source of financing for Le-Nature’s, 
representing more than 12 percent of its financing. Creditors such as Wells Fargo Bank closely monitor 
a firm’s statement of stockholders’ equity because the firm’s policy on dividend payments to the stock-
holders affects its ability to repay its debts. Every dollar Le-Nature’s pays to stockholders as a dividend 
is not available for use in paying back its debt to Wells Fargo. Investors examine retained earnings to 
determine whether the company is reinvesting a sufficient portion of earnings to support future growth.

retained earnings.
The retained earnings equation that describes these relationships is:
Beginning Retained Earnings + Net Income − Dividends = Ending Retained Earnings
Elements
The statement starts with the beginning balances in the stockholders’ equity accounts, 
lists the increases and decreases, and reports the resulting ending balances. The retained 
earnings portion of the statement in Exhibit 1.4 begins with Le-Nature’s beginning-of-
the-year retained earnings. The current year’s net income reported on the income state-
ment is added and the current year’s dividends are subtracted from this amount. During 
2012, Le-Nature earned $22.9 million, as shown on the income statement (Exhibit 1.3). 
This amount was added to the beginning-of-the-year retained earnings. Also, during 2012, 
Le-Nature’s declared and paid a total of $2.0 million in dividends to its stockholders. This 
amount was subtracted in computing end-of-the-year retained earnings on the balance 
sheet. Note that retained earnings increased by the portion of income reinvested in the 
business ($22.9 million − $2.0 million = $20.9 million). The ending retained earnings 
amount of $64.0 million is the same as that reported in Exhibit 1.2 on Le-Nature’s balance 
sheet. Thus, the retained earnings portion of the statement indicates the relationship of the 
income statement to the balance sheet.

Statement of Cash Flows
Structure
Le-Nature’s statement of cash flows is presented in Exhibit 1.5. The statement of cash flows 
(cash flow statement) divides Le-Nature’s cash inflows and outflows (receipts and payments) 
into the three primary categories of cash flows in a typical business: cash flows from operat-
ing, investing, and financing activities. The heading identifies the name of the entity, the title 
of the report, and the unit of measure used in the statement. Like the income statement, the 
cash flow statement covers a specified period of time (the accounting period), which in this 
case is one year.
As discussed earlier in this chapter, reported revenues do not always equal cash collected 
from customers because some sales may be on credit. Also, expenses reported on the income 
statement may not be equal to the cash paid out during the period because expenses may be 
incurred in one period and paid for in another. Because the income statement does not pro-
vide information concerning cash flows, accountants prepare the statement of cash flows to 
report inflows and outflows of cash. The cash flow statement equation describes the causes 
of the change in cash reported on the balance sheet from the end of the last period to the end 
of the current period:
+/− Cash Flows from Operating Activities (CFO)
+/− Cash Flows from Investing Activities (CFI)
+/− Cash Flows from Financing Activities (CFF)

Elements
Cash flows from operating activities are cash flows that are directly related to earning 
income. For example, when customers pay Le-Nature’s for the beverages it has delivered to 
them, it lists the amounts collected as cash collected from customers. When Le-Nature’s pays 
salaries to its production employees or pays bills received from its tea suppliers, it includes the 
amounts in cash paid to suppliers and employees.
Cash flows from investing activities include cash flows related to the acquisition or sale of 
the company’s plant and equipment and investments. This year, Le-Nature’s had only one cash 
outflow from investing activities, the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment to meet 
growing demand for its products.
Cash flows from financing activities are cash flows directly related to the financing of 
the enterprise itself. They involve the receipt or payment of money to investors and creditors 
(except for suppliers). This year, Le-Nature’s borrowed additional money from the bank to pur-
chase most of the new manufacturing equipment. It also paid out dividends to the stockholders.5
Bankers often consider the Operating Activities section to be most important because it indicates the 
company’s ability to generate cash from sales to meet its current cash needs. Any amount left over can be 
used to pay back the bank debt or expand the company. Stockholders will invest in a company only if they 
believe that it will eventually generate more cash from operations than it uses so that cash will become 
available to pay dividends and expand.

Relationships Among the Statements
Our discussion of the four basic financial statements has focused on what elements are reported 
in each statement, how the elements are related by the equation for each statement, and how 
the information is important to the decisions of investors, creditors, and others. We have also 
discovered how the statements, all of which are outputs from the same system, are related to 
one another. In particular, we learned:
    
Net income from the income statement results in an increase in ending retained earnings on 
the statement of stockholders’ equity.
   
  
Ending retained earnings from the statement of stockholders’ equity is one of the two com-
ponents of stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet.
    
The change in cash on the cash flow statement added to the beginning-of-the-year balance 
in cash equals the end-of-year balance in cash on the balance sheet.
Thus, we can think of the income statement as explaining, through the statement of stockhold-
ers’ equity, how the operations of the company improved or harmed the financial position of 
the company during the year. The cash flow statement explains how the operating, invest-
ing, and financing activities of the company affected the cash balance on the balance sheet 
during the year. These relationships are illustrated in Exhibit 1.6 for Le-Nature’s financial 
statements.
Notes and Financial Statement Formats

read the notes (or footnotes) to the financial statements will result in an incomplete picture of 
the company’s financial health. Throughout this book, we will discuss many note disclosures 
because understanding their content is critical to understanding the company.
A few additional formatting conventions are worth noting here. Assets are listed on the 
balance sheet by ease of conversion to cash. Liabilities are listed by their maturity (due date). 
Most financial statements include the monetary unit sign (in the United States, the $) beside the 
first dollar amount in a group of items (e.g., the cash amount in the assets). Also, it is common 
to place a single underline below the last item in a group before a total or subtotal (e.g., land). 
For group totals (e.g., total assets), a dollar sign is placed beside each amount and a double 
underline is set below. The same conventions are followed in all four basic financial statements.
Summary of the Four Basic Financial Statements
We have learned a great deal about the content of the four basic financial statements. Exhibit 1.7 
 
summarizes this information. Take a few minutes to review the information in the exhibit

For decision makers to use the information in Le-Nature’s financial statements effectively, 
they have to know: (1) the information conveyed by the statements and the measurement rules 
applied in computing the numbers on the statements and (2) that the numbers on the statements 
are correct. The rules that determine the content and measurement rules of the statements are 
called generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
How Are Generally Accepted Accounting Principles Determined?
The accounting system in use today has a long history. Its foundations are normally traced 
back to the works of an Italian monk and mathematician, Fr. Luca Pacioli, published in 1494.

However, prior to 1933, each company’s management largely determined its financial report-
ing practices. Thus, little uniformity in practice existed among companies.
In the United States, Congress created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
and gave it broad powers to determine the measurement rules for financial statements that com-
panies issuing stock to the public (publicly traded companies) must provide to stockholders.6 
The SEC has worked with organizations of professional accountants and other interested par-
ties to establish groups that are given the primary responsibilities to work out the detailed 
rules that become generally accepted accounting principles. Today, the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB) has this responsibility. The official pronouncements of the FASB 
are called the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
Why Is GAAP Important to Managers and External Users?
Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are of great interest to the companies that 
must prepare financial statements, their auditors, and the readers of the statements. Compa-

financial statements. Companies incur the cost of preparing the statements and bear the major 
economic consequences of their publication, which include, among others,
 
1. Effects on the selling price of a company’s stock.
 
2. Effects on the amount of bonuses received by management and employees.
 
3. Loss of competitive information to other companies.
As a consequence of these and other concerns, changes in GAAP are actively debated, politi-
cal lobbying often takes place, and final rules are a compromise among the wishes of interested 
parties. Most managers do not need to learn all the details included in these standards. Our 
approach is to focus on those details that have the greatest impact on the numbers presented in 
financial statements and are appropriate for an introductory course.
Financial accounting standards and disclosure requirements are adopted by national regulatory agen-
cies. Since 2002, there has been substantial movement toward the adoption of International Finan-
cial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
Examples of jurisdictions requiring the use of IFRS currently include:

 European Union (United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, 
 
Bulgaria, Poland, etc.)
 
 Australia and New Zealand
 
 Hong Kong (S.A.R. of China), Malaysia, and Republic of Korea
 
 Israel and Turkey
 
 Brazil and Chile
 
 Canada and Mexico
In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission now allows foreign companies whose 
stock is traded in the United States to use IFRS, and it is considering the appropriateness of IFRS for U.S. 
domestic companies. To prepare you to deal with statements prepared under U.S. GAAP and IFRS, we 
will point out key differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP starting in Chapter 5. The basic principles 
and practices we discuss in Chapters 1 through 4 apply equally to both sets of standards.

Ensuring the Accuracy of Financial Statements
What If the Numbers Are Wrong?
Shortly after the issuance of the statements presented in this chapter, Le-Nature’s worked 
with the Wachovia Capital Markets group from Wells Fargo Bank to borrow an additional 
$285 million from various lenders. Why would lenders agree to risk such a large amount? 
Le-Nature’s financial statements played a major role in the lenders’ decisions to back the 
loan. The statements presented a picture of a growth company with amazing future prospects. 
Reported revenues grew from $40 to $275 million (or nearly 600 percent) in just six years! 
Reported income rose by 2,400 percent in the same period! Clearly, Le-Nature’s looked like a 
good bet. But if the numbers are wrong, all bets are off.
The truth about Le-Nature’s was revealed when several non-family-member stockhold-
ers suspected that all was not right and filed a lawsuit seeking an independent trustee to exam-
ine the company. Court records reveal an amazing story. According to the bankruptcy custodian, 
reported annual sales of $274 million were really about $32 million. Gregory Podlucky and his 
 
co- 
conspirators forged checks, invoices, and revenue and expense records to massively overstate rev-
enues and profits. The $10.6 million its balance sheet claimed for cash turned out to be $1.8 million 
and the company had written checks totaling $2.9 million against that balance. The balance sheet 
also understated liabilities by $200 million. The company was never a real success—it was all fake.

Podlucky was borrowing more and more money and using it to pay off his earlier creditors 
(this is called a Ponzi scheme). At the same time, he was stealing cash to support a lavish life-
style. When the trustee arrived, Podlucky and his bodyguard were feverishly shredding docu-
ments. Federal agents found $20 million in gems, diamond-encrusted watches, and gold, silver, 
and platinum jewelry in safes in a secret room at the Latrobe plant. Podlucky had also spent 
more than $10 million of company money on his 25,000-square-foot mansion that was under 
construction. A sample of the resulting newspaper headlines follows:

Ethical Conduct
Ethics are standards of conduct for judging right from wrong, honest from dishonest, and fair 
from unfair. Intentional misreporting of financial statements in the Le-Nature’s case was clearly 
unethical and illegal. However, many situations are less clear-cut and require that individu-
als weigh one moral principle (e.g., honesty) against another (e.g., loyalty to a friend). When 
money is involved, people can easily fool themselves into believing that bad acts are justified. 
To avoid falling prey to this tendency, when faced with an ethical dilemma, it is often recom-
mended that you follow a three-step process:
 
1. Identify the benefits of a decision (often to the manager or employee involved) and who will 
be harmed (other employees, owners, creditors, the environment).
 
2. Identify alternative courses of action.
 
3. Choose the one you would like your family and friends to see reported on your local news. 
That is usually the ethical choice.
In the Le-Nature’s case, Podlucky and his co-conspirators clearly did not follow this process. 
Little besides the jewelry and the Latrobe plant were left to satisfy Le-Nature’s over $800 mil-
lion in debts. The nonfamily stockholders lost all of their money. Over 240 plant workers lost 
their jobs. And the town of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, suffered a severe economic blow.
Responsibility and the Need for Controls
As a manager in a business, you are responsible for setting up systems to prevent and detect 
unethical behavior. Primary responsibility for the information in the financial statements lies 
with management, represented by the highest officer of the company and the highest financial 
officer. Companies should take three important steps to assure investors that the company’s 
records are accurate: (1) they should maintain a system of controls over both the records and 
the assets of the company, (2) they should hire outside independent auditors to audit the fair-
ness of the financial statements, and (3) they should form a committee of the board of directors 
to oversee the integrity of these other safeguards. These safeguards failed in Le-Nature’s case. 
The company had no controls, the independent auditors were duped by management, and the 
board included only Podlucky’s cronies. We will discuss the roles of management, auditors, 
and directors in more detail in Chapter 5.
AUDIT 
An examination of the financial 
reports to ensure that they 
represent what they claim and 
conform with generally accepted 
accounting principles.
System of Controls
External Auditors
Board of Directors
Three steps to ensure the accuracy of records:
Those responsible for fraudulent financial statements are subject to criminal and civil 
penalties. As noted above, those criminally liable at Le-Nature’s are serving a total of more 
than 70 years in prison and have been forced to forfeit all of their assets to be paid to 
creditors who suffered losses. The auditors who missed the fraud agreed to pay $50 million 


C H A P TER  1  Financial Statements and Business Decisions

to the creditors and Wachovia Capital Markets, which marketed the loans, agreed to pay 
$80 million. The bottling equipment company that provided false documents to support 
Le-Nature’s loans has paid a $15 million fine and $110 million in restitution. Other civil 
suits are still in process.
Although financial statement fraud is a fairly rare event, the misrepresentations in Le-Nature’s 
statements aptly illustrate the importance of fairly presented financial statements to investors 
and creditors. Although most managers and owners act in an honest and responsible fashion, 
this incident, and the much larger frauds at Enron and WorldCom, are stark reminders of the 
economic consequences of lack of fair presentation in financial reports. All three companies 
were forced into bankruptcy when their fraudulent financial reporting practices were brought 
to light. Penalties against Enron and WorldCom’s audit firm, Arthur Andersen, also led to its 
bankruptcy and dissolution. Thousands lost their jobs.
At the end of most chapters, one or more demonstration cases are presented. These cases provide 
an overview of the primary issues discussed in the chapter. Each demonstration case is followed 
by a recommended solution. You should read the case carefully and then prepare your own solu-
tion before you study the recommended solution. This self-evaluation is highly recommended. 
The introductory case presented here reviews the elements reported on the income statement, 
statement of stockholders’ equity, and balance sheet and how the elements within the statements 
are related.
Pier 1 Imports, Inc., sells a wide variety of furniture, decorative home furnishings, dining 
and kitchen goods, bath and bedding accessories, candles, gifts, and other specialty items for 
the home through over 1,000 retail stores in North America. Its merchandise largely consists of 
items that feature a significant degree of handcraftsmanship and are mostly imported directly 
from foreign suppliers. Following is a list of the financial statement items and amounts adapted 
from a recent Pier 1 income statement and balance sheet. The numbers are presented in millions 
of dollars for the current year ended February 28. Assume that the company did not pay divi-
dends, issue stock, or retire stock during the year. Retained earnings at the beginning of the year

Types of Business Entities
This textbook emphasizes accounting for profit-making business entities. The three main types of 
business entities are sole proprietorship, partnership, and corporation. A sole proprietorship is an unin-
corporated business owned by one person; it usually is small in size and is common in the service, retail-
ing, and farming industries. Often the owner is the manager. Legally, the business and the owner are not 
separate entities. Accounting views the business as a separate entity, however, that must be accounted for 
separately from its owner.
A partnership is an unincorporated business owned by two or more persons known as partners. The 
agreements between the owners are specified in a partnership contract. This contract deals with matters 
such as division of income each reporting period and distribution of resources of the business on termina-
tion of its operations. A partnership is not legally separate from its owners. Legally, each partner in a general

partnership is responsible for the debts of the business (each general partner has unlimited liability). The 
partnership, however, is a separate business entity to be accounted for separately from its several owners.
A corporation is a business incorporated under the laws of a particular state. The owners are called 
stockholders or shareholders. Ownership is represented by shares of capital stock that usually can be 
bought and sold freely. When the organizers file an approved application for incorporation, the state 
issues a charter. This charter gives the corporation the right to operate as a separate legal entity, sepa-
rate and apart from its owners. The stockholders enjoy limited liability. Stockholders are liable for the 
corporation’s debts only to the extent of their investments. The corporate charter specifies the types and 
amounts of capital stock that can be issued. Most states require a minimum of two or three stockholders 
and a minimum amount of resources to be contributed at the time of organization. The stockholders elect 
a governing board of directors, which in turn employs managers and exercises general supervision of the 
corporation. Accounting also views the corporation as a separate business entity that must be accounted 
for separately from its owners. Limited liability companies (LLCs) and limited liability partnerships 
(LLPs) have many characteristics similar to corporations.
In terms of economic importance, the corporation is the dominant form of business organization in the 
United States. This dominance is caused by the many advantages of the corporate form: (1) limited liability for 
the stockholders, (2) continuity of life, (3) ease in transferring ownership (stock), and (4) opportunities to raise 
large amounts of money by selling shares to a large number of people. The primary disadvantage of a corpora-
tion is that its income may be subject to double taxation (income is taxed when it is earned and again when 
it is distributed to stockholders as dividends). In this textbook, we emphasize the corporate form of business. 
Nevertheless, the accounting concepts and procedures that we discuss also apply to other types of businesses.
Chapter Supplement B
Employment in the Accounting Profession Today
Since 1900, accounting has attained the stature of professions such as law, medicine, engineering, and 
architecture. As with all recognized professions, accounting is subject to professional competence require-
ments, is dedicated to service to the public, requires a high level of academic study, and rests on a com-
mon body of knowledge. An accountant may be licensed as a certified public accountant, or CPA. This 
designation is granted only on completion of requirements specified by the state that issues the license. 
Although CPA requirements vary among states, they include a college degree with a specified number of 
accounting courses, good character, professional experience, and successful completion of a professional 
examination. The CPA examination is prepared by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
Accountants (including CPAs) commonly are engaged in professional practice or are employed by 
businesses, government entities, nonprofit organizations, and so on. Accountants employed in these 
activities may take and pass a professional examination to become a certified management accountant, 
or CMA (the CMA examination is administered by the Institute of Management Accountants), or a certi-
fied internal auditor, or CIA (the CIA examination is administered by the Institute of Internal Auditors).
Practice of Public Accounting
Although an individual may practice public accounting, usually two or more individuals organize an 
accounting firm in the form of a partnership (in many cases, a limited liability partnership, or LLP). 
Accounting firms vary in size from a one-person office, to regional firms, to the Big Four firms (Deloitte & 
 
Touche, Ernst & Young, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers), which have hundreds of offices 
located worldwide. Accounting firms usually render three types of services: audit or assurance services, 
management consulting services, and tax services.
Audit or Assurance Services
Audit or assurance services are independent professional services that improve the quality of information 
for decision makers. The most important assurance service performed by the CPA in public practice is 
financial statement auditing. The purpose of an audit is to lend credibility to the financial reports, that 
is, to ensure that they fairly represent what they claim. An audit involves an examination of the financial 
reports (prepared by the management of the entity) to ensure that they conform with GAAP. Other areas of 
assurance services include electronic commerce integrity and security and information systems reliability.
Management Consulting Services
Many independent CPA firms offer management consulting services. These services usually are account-
ing based and encompass such activities as the design and installation of accounting, data processing, 


24
C HAP TER  1   Financial Statements and Business Decisions
and profit-planning and control (budget) systems; financial advice; forecasting; inventory controls; cost-
effectiveness studies; and operational analysis. To maintain their independence, CPAs are prohibited 
from performing certain consulting services for the public companies that they audit.
Tax Services
CPAs in public practice usually provide income tax services to their clients. These services include both 
tax planning as a part of the decision-making process and the determination of the income tax liability 
(reported on the annual income tax return). Because of the increasing complexity of state and federal tax 
laws, a high level of competence is required, which CPAs specializing in taxation can provide. The CPA’s 
involvement in tax planning often is quite significant. Most major business decisions have significant tax 
impacts; in fact, tax-planning considerations often govern certain business decisions.
Employment by Organizations
Many accountants, including CPAs, CMAs, and CIAs, are employed by profit-making and nonprofit 
organizations. An organization, depending on its size and complexity, may employ from a few to hun-
dreds of accountants. In a business enterprise, the chief financial officer (usually a vice president or 
controller) is a member of the management team. This responsibility usually entails a wide range of 
management, financial, and accounting duties.
In a business entity, accountants typically are engaged in a wide variety of activities, such as gen-
eral management, general accounting, cost accounting, profit planning and control (budgeting), internal 
auditing, and information systems management. A primary function of the accountants in organizations 
is to provide data that are useful for internal managerial decision making and for controlling operations. 
The functions of external reporting, tax planning, control of assets, and a host of related responsibilities 
normally are also performed by accountants in industry.
Employment in the Public and Not-for-Profit Sector
The vast and complex operations of governmental units, from the local to the international level, create 
a need for accountants. The same holds true for other not-for-profit organizations such as hospitals and 
universities. Accountants employed in the public and not-for-profit sector perform functions similar to 
those performed by their counterparts in private organizations. The Government Accountability Office 
(GAO) and the regulatory agencies, such as the SEC and Federal Communications Commission (FCC), 
also use the services of accountants in carrying out their regulatory duties.
 
1-1. Recognize the information conveyed in each of the four basic financial statements and the way 
that it is used by different decision makers (investors, creditors, and managers). p. 6
The balance sheet is a statement of financial position that reports dollar amounts for the assets, 
liabilities, and stockholders’ equity at a specific point in time.
The income statement is a statement of operations that reports revenues, expenses, and net income 
for a stated period of time.
The statement of stockholders’ equity explains changes in stockholders’ equity accounts (com-
mon stock and retained earnings) that occurred during a specific period of time.
The statement of cash flows reports inflows and outflows of cash for a stated period of time.
The statements are used by investors and creditors to evaluate different aspects of the firm’s finan-
cial position and performance.
 
1-2. Identify the role of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in determining financial 
statement content and how companies ensure the accuracy of their financial statements. p. 16
GAAP refers to the measurement rules used to develop the information in financial statements. 
Knowledge of GAAP is necessary for accurate interpretation of the numbers in financial statements.
Management has primary responsibility for the accuracy of a company’s financial informa-
tion. Auditors are responsible for expressing an opinion on the fairness of the financial statement 
presentations based on their examination of the reports and records of the company.
Users will have confidence in the accuracy of financial statement numbers only if the people 
associated with their preparation and audit have reputations for ethical behavior and competence. 
Management and auditors can also be held legally liable for fraudulent financial statements.

In this chapter, we studied the basic financial statements that communicate financial information to 
external users. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 provide a more detailed look at financial statements and examine how 
to translate data about business transactions into these statements. Learning how to translate back and 
forth between business transactions and financial statements is the key to using financial statements in 
planning and decision making. Chapter 2 begins our discussion of the way that the accounting function 
collects data about business transactions and processes the data to provide periodic financial statements, 
with emphasis on the balance sheet. To accomplish this purpose, Chapter 2 discusses key accounting 
concepts, the accounting model, transaction analysis, and analytical tools. We examine the typical busi-
ness activities of an actual service-oriented company to demonstrate the concepts in Chapters 2, 3, and 4.

Analyzing a Student’s Business and Preparing an Income Statement (AP1-2)
During the summer between his junior and senior years, James Cook needed to earn sufficient money for 
the coming academic year. Unable to obtain a job with a reasonable salary, he decided to try the lawn care 
business for three months. After a survey of the market potential, James bought a used pickup truck on 
June 1 for $1,800. On each door he painted “James Cook Lawn Service, Phone 471-4487.” He also spent 
$900 for mowers, trimmers, and tools. To acquire these items, he borrowed $3,000 cash by signing a note 
payable promising to pay the $3,000 plus interest of $78 at the end of the three months (ending August 31).
By the end of the summer, James had done a lot of work and his bank account looked good. This 
prompted him to wonder how much profit the business had earned.
A review of the check stubs showed the following: Bank deposits of collections from customers 
totaled $15,000. The following checks had been written: gas, oil, and lubrication, $1,050; pickup repairs, 
$250; mower repair, $110; miscellaneous supplies used, $80; helpers, $5,400; payroll taxes, $190; pay-
ment for assistance in preparing payroll tax forms, $25; insurance, $125; telephone, $110; and $3,078 
to pay off the note including interest (on August 31). A notebook kept in the pickup, plus some unpaid 
bills, reflected that customers still owed him $700 for lawn services rendered and that he owed $180 for 
gas and oil (credit card charges). He estimated that the cost for use of the truck and the other equipment 
(called depreciation) for three months amounted to $600.

Upon graduation from high school, Sam List immediately accepted a job as an electrician’s assistant 
for a large local electrical repair company. After three years of hard work, Sam received an electrician’s 
license and decided to start his own business. He had saved $12,000, which he invested in the business. 
First, he transferred this amount from his savings account to a business bank account for List Electric 
Repair Company, Incorporated. His lawyer had advised him to start as a corporation. He then purchased 
a used panel truck for $9,000 cash and secondhand tools for $1,500; rented space in a small building; 
inserted an ad in the local paper; and opened the doors on October 1. Immediately, Sam was very busy; 
after one month, he employed an assistant.

Although Sam knew practically nothing about the financial side of the business, he realized that 
a number of reports were required and that costs and collections had to be controlled carefully. At 
the end of the year, prompted in part by concern about his income tax situation (previously he had 
to report only salary), Sam recognized the need for financial statements. His wife Janet developed 
some financial statements for the business. On December 31, with the help of a friend, she gath-
ered the following data for the three months just ended. Bank account deposits of collections for 
electric repair services totaled $32,000. The following checks had been written: electrician’s assis-
tant, $7,500; payroll taxes, $175; supplies purchased and used on jobs, $9,500; oil, gas, and mainte-
nance on truck, $1,200; insurance, $700; rent, $500; utilities and telephone, $825; and miscellaneous 
expenses (including advertising), $600. Also, uncollected bills to customers for electric repair ser-
vices amounted to $3,500. The $250 rent for December had not been paid. Sam estimated the cost of 
using the truck and tools (depreciation) during the three months to be $1,200. Income taxes for the 
three-month period were $3,930.
Required:
 1. Prepare a quarterly income statement for List Electric Repair for the three months October through 
December. Use the following main captions: Revenues from Services, Expenses, Pretax Income,

Critical Thinking Cases
Making Decisions as an Owner: Deciding about a Proposed Audit
You are one of three partners who own and operate Mary’s Maid Service. The company has been oper-
ating for seven years. One of the other partners has always prepared the company’s annual financial 
statements. Recently you proposed that the statements be audited each year because it would benefit the 
partners and preclude possible disagreements about the division of profits. The partner who prepares the 
statements proposed that his Uncle Ray, who has a lot of financial experience, can do the job and at little 
cost. Your other partner remained silent.
Required:
 1. What position would you take on the proposal? Justify your response.
 2. What would you strongly recommend? Give the basis for your recommendation.
Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma: Ethics and Auditor Responsibilities
A key factor that an auditor provides is independence. The AICPA Code of Professional Conduct states 
that “a member in public practice should be independent in fact and appearance when providing auditing 
and other attestation services.”
Required:
Do you consider the following circumstances to suggest a lack of independence? Justify your position.

teve Ells is a classically trained chef who is often called one of the most innovative 
men in the world of food. He is the founder, chairman of the board, and co-chief 
executive officer of Chipotle Mexican Grill, a leader in the fastest-growing segment 
of the restaurant industry, now called “fast-casual.” In 1993, this entrepreneur opened his 
first restaurant in a former Dolly Madison ice cream store in Denver, Colorado. His vision 
was a restaurant that serves food fast but uses higher-quality fresh ingredients and cook-
ing techniques found in finer restaurants. As of December 31, 2014, the Chipotle chain 
had over 1,770 restaurants in the United States, Canada, England, France, and Germany. 
In addition, the company has expanded its business model to include nine ShopHouse 
Southeast Asian Kitchen and two Pizzeria Locale restaurants. It plans to open about 200 
additional restaurants in 2015.
How did Chipotle grow so fast? It did so in two stages. First, in 1999, McDonald’s 
Corporation became the majority stockholder by investing about $360 million in Chipotle. 
This provided funding for its tremendous early growth from 19 stores to nearly 490 restaurants

by the end of 2005. Then, in January 2006, Chipotle “went public.” In its IPO, or 
initial public offering, it issued stock to the public for the first time. That stock 
is listed on the New York Stock Exchange as CMG. McDonald’s also sold its own-
ership in Chipotle for nearly $1.4 billion—a handsome profit of over $1 billion. 
Comparing its balance sheet from 2005 to 2014 highlights the company’s amaz-
ing 549 percent growth since becoming a public company:
This growth was stimulated in part by Ells’s evolving vision that “fresh is not 
enough anymore.” He has committed Chipotle to serving naturally raised pork, 
chicken, and beef; using no-trans-fat cooking oil; serving cheese and sour cream 
products that are free of synthetic bovine growth hormones; using certified 
organic beans and locally grown organic produce when in season; and serving 
preservative-free corn and flour tortillas. In an even more dramatic show of com-
mitment to sustainability, in 2009, Chipotle built the first-ever free-standing 
restaurant to receive the highest rating (LEED Platinum) from the U.S. Green 
(in millions of dollars)

Building Council,1 a start toward other sustainable renovations and projects. In 2011, the 
company created the Chipotle Cultivate Foundation to expand philanthropic work surround-
ing sustainable agriculture.
As it continues to evolve, Chipotle’s recent annual report states its vision is now “to change 
the way people think about and eat fast food.” The belief is that providing good food and ser-
vice is good business.
U ND E RSTAN DI N G  T H E  B USI N E SS
The “fast-casual” segment of the $2.1 trillion restaurant industry generates approximately 
$40 billion in sales annually. What identifies a restaurant as fast-casual? Typically, customers 
still order at the register as in a fast-food restaurant, but the food is made to order, typically 
in view of the customers and without full table service, and it is served in modern and upscale 
surroundings, with checks typically ranging between $8 and $16. Chipotle Mexican Grill has 
been a leader in this segment.
Franchising is common in chain restaurants. The largest restaurant to use franchising is 
Subway, with over 39,000 restaurants—all franchised. Franchising involves selling the right 
to use or sell a product or service to another. This is an easy way for someone to start his or 
her own business because the franchisor (the seller, such as Panera Bread) often provides 
site location, design, marketing, and management training support in exchange for initial 
franchise fees and ongoing royalty fees usually based on weekly sales. At Panera Bread, for 
example, only 48 percent of the stores are company-owned.
Unlike most restaurant chains, however, Chipotle does not franchise the business. All 
restaurants are company-owned. Developing a new site, usually on rented property, costs 
on average about $900,000. In 2014, Chipotle spent nearly $253 million on new and 
renovated property and equipment. The creation of new restaurants to meet consumer 
demand for healthier food options explains most of the changes in Chipotle’s assets and 
liabilities from year to year. To understand how the result of Chipotle Mexican Grill’s 
growth strategy is communicated in the balance sheet, we must answer the following

In this chapter, we focus on some typical asset acquisition activities (often called investing 
activities), along with related financing activities, such as borrowing funds from creditors 
or selling stock to investors to provide the cash necessary to acquire the assets. We examine 
those activities that affect only balance sheet amounts. Operating activities that affect both 
the income statement and the balance sheet are covered in Chapters 3 and 4. To begin, let’s 
return to the basic concepts introduced in Chapter 1.

Because learning and remembering how the accounting process works is much easier if you 
know why it works a certain way, we begin by discussing key accounting terms and concepts. 
They are part of a conceptual framework developed over many years and synthesized by the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to provide a structure for developing account-
ing standards. Exhibit 2.1 provides an overview of the key concepts in the framework that will 
be discussed in each of the next four chapters. A clear understanding of these accounting con-
cepts will be helpful as you study, and they will also help you in future chapters as we examine 
more complex business activities.
Concepts Emphasized in Chapter 2
Objective of Financial Reporting
The primary objective of financial reporting to external users is to provide financial infor-
mation about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders, 
and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the entity. The users of 
accounting information are all expected to have a reasonable understanding of accounting 
concepts and procedures—which may be one of the reasons you are studying accounting. Of 
course, as we discussed in Chapter 1, many other groups, such as suppliers and customers, also 
use external financial statements.
Most users are interested in information to help them assess the amount, timing, and uncer-
tainty of a business’s future cash inflows and outflows. For example, creditors and potential 
creditors need to assess an entity’s ability to (1) pay interest on a loan over time and also (2) pay 
back the principal on the loan when it is due. Investors and potential investors want to assess 
the entity’s ability to (1) pay dividends in the future and (2) be successful so that the stock price 
rises, enabling investors to sell their stock for more than they paid. Information about a com-
pany’s economic resources, claims against its resources, and activities that change these items 
provides insight into cash flows and a company’s financial strengths and weaknesses.
Qualitative Characteristics of Useful Information
For accounting information to be useful, it must be relevant and be a faithful representa-
tion. Relevant information is capable of influencing decisions by allowing users to assess 
past activities and/or predict future activities. To be reported, the information should also be

material in amount, depending on the nature of the item and company. Faithful representation 
requires that the information be complete, neutral, and free from error. Comparability, verifi-
ability, timeliness, and understandability are qualitative characteristics that enhance the useful-
ness of information that is relevant and faithfully represented. For example, our discussions of 
ratio analysis will emphasize the importance of comparing ratios for the same company over 
time, as well as with those of competitors. Such comparisons are valid only if the information 
is prepared on a consistent and comparable basis. These characteristics of useful information 
guide the FASB in deciding what financial information should be reported.
Recognition and Measurement Concepts
Before we discuss accountants’ definitions for the elements of the balance sheet, we should 
consider three assumptions and a measurement concept that underlie much of our application 
of these definitions. First we make the separate entity assumption, which states that each 
business’s activities must be accounted for separately from the activities of its owners, all other 
persons, and other entities. This means, for example, that, when an owner purchases property 
for personal use, the property is not an asset of the business. Second, under the going concern 
assumption (also called the continuity assumption), unless there is evidence to the contrary, 
we assume that the business will continue operating into the foreseeable future, long enough 
to meet its contractual commitments and plans. This means, for example, that if there was a 
high likelihood of bankruptcy, then its assets should be valued and reported on the balance 
sheet as if the company were to be liquidated (that is, discontinued, with all of its assets sold 
and all debts paid). Under the monetary unit assumption, each business entity accounts for 
and reports its financial results primarily in terms of the national monetary unit (e.g., dollars in 
the United States, yen in Japan, and euros in Germany), without any adjustment for changes in 
purchasing power (e.g., inflation).
Finally, accountants measure the elements of the balance sheet using what is called a 
mixed-attribute measurement model. Most balance sheet elements are recorded at their 
cost (historical cost), which is the cash-equivalent value on the date of the transaction. For 
example, assets are initially recorded at the cash paid plus the dollar value of all noncash con-
siderations on the exchange date, such as the trade-in value of a used asset. We will discuss the 
conditions under which these values are adjusted to other amounts, such as their market value,

starting in Chapter 6 of this text. With these assumptions in mind, we are now ready to discuss 
accountants’ definitions of the elements of the balance sheet.
Elements of the Balance Sheet
The four financial statements—balance sheet, income statement, statement of stockholders’ 
(shareholders’ or owners’) equity, and statement of cash flows—along with the notes to the 
statements provide the structure for the information communicated to users. As we learned in 
Chapter 1, assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity are the elements of a corporation’s bal-
ance sheet. The conceptual framework defines them as follows.
Assets are probable future economic benefits owned or controlled by an entity as a result of 
past transactions or events. In other words, they are the economic resources the entity acquired 
to use in operating the company in the future. As shown in Chipotle’s balance sheet pre-
sented in Exhibit 2.2, most companies list assets in order of liquidity, or how soon an asset is 
expected by management to be turned into cash or used. Notice that several of Chipotle’s assets 
are categorized as current assets. Current assets are those resources that Chipotle will use or 
turn into cash within one year (the next 12 months). Chipotle’s current assets include Cash, 
Short-Term Investments (in the stocks and bonds of other companies), Accounts Receivable 
(due from customers and others), Supplies (to make and serve the food), Prepaid Expenses (for 
rent, insurance, and advertising paid in advance of use), and Other Current Assets (a summary 
of several smaller accounts). For manufacturers that produce and sell goods and merchandisers 
who sell already-completed goods, Inventory (for goods to be sold) would also be listed after 
Accounts Receivable. Inventory is always considered a current asset, regardless of how long it 
takes to produce and sell the inventory. These are typical titles used by most entities.
All other assets are considered long term (or noncurrent). That is, they are to be used or 
turned into cash after the coming year. For Chipotle, that includes property and equipment 
(Land, Buildings, and Equipment), Long-Term Investments (in the stocks and bonds of other 
companies), and Intangibles (nonphysical assets such as trademarks and patents). Intan-
gibles are discussed in detail in Chapter 8.
Liabilities are defined as probable future sacrifices of economic benefits arising from 
present obligations of a business to transfer cash or other assets or to provide services as 
a result of past transactions or events. Entities that a company owes money to are called 
creditors.
Similar to how assets are reported in order of liquidity, liabilities are usually listed on 
the balance sheet in order of maturity (how soon an obligation is to be paid). Liabilities 
that Chipotle will need to pay or settle within the coming year (with cash, goods, other cur-
rent assets, or services) are classified as current liabilities. Chipotle’s current liabilities 
include Accounts Payable (to suppliers), Unearned Revenue (for unredeemed gift cards that 
have been purchased by customers), and Accrued Expenses Payable (more specifically, Wages 
Payable and Utilities Payable, although additional accrued liabilities may include Interest Pay-
able and Taxes Payable, among others). Distinguishing current assets and current liabilities 
assists external users of the financial statements in assessing the amounts and the timing of 
future cash flows.
Long-term obligations are summarized as Other Liabilities that may include Notes Payable 
(written promises to pay the amount borrowed and interest as specified in the agreement) and 
other obligations, such as to employee pension plans and long-term capital leases. These and 
other liabilities will be discussed in more detail in subsequent chapters.
Stockholders’ equity (also called shareholders’ equity or owners’ equity) is the residual 
interest in the assets of the entity after subtracting liabilities. It is a combination of the financ-
ing provided by the owners and by business operations.

 Financing Provided by Owners is referred to as contributed capital. Owners invest in the 
business by providing cash and sometimes other assets and receive in exchange shares of 
stock as evidence of ownership. The largest investors in Chipotle Mexican Grill are financial 
institutions (mutual funds, pension funds, etc.). The directors and executive officers also 
own stock, as do other corporate employees and the general public.
ASSETS
Probable future economic 
benefits owned by the entity as a 
result of past transactions.
CURRENT ASSETS
Assets that will be used or 
turned into cash within one year. 
Inventory is always considered a 
current asset regardless of the 
time needed to produce and sell it.

LIABILITIES
Probable future sacrifices of 
economic benefits arising from 
a present obligation to transfer 
cash, goods, or services as a 
result of a past transaction.
CURRENT LIABILITIES
Short-term obligations that will 
be paid in cash (or other current 
assets) within the current 
operating cycle or one year, 
whichever is longer.
STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY 
(SHAREHOLDERS’ OR 
OWNERS’ EQUITY)
The financing provided by the 
owners and the operations of the 
business.

 Financing Provided by Operations is referred to as earned capital or retained earnings.2 
When companies earn profits, they can be distributed to owners as dividends or reinvested 
in the business. The portion of profits reinvested in the business is called retained earnings. 
Companies with a growth strategy often pay little or no dividends to retain funds for expan-
sion. A look at Chipotle’s balance sheet (Exhibit 2.2) indicates that its growth has been 
financed by substantial reinvestment of earnings ($1,721.8 million).

Now that we have reviewed the basic elements of the balance sheet and related recogni-
tion and measurement concepts as part of the conceptual framework, let’s see what economic 
activities cause changes in the amounts reported on the balance sheet.

Nature of Business Transactions
Accounting focuses on certain events that have an economic impact on the entity. Those events 
that are recorded as part of the accounting process are called transactions. The first step in 
translating the results of business events to financial statement numbers is determining which 
events to include. As the definitions of assets and liabilities indicate, only economic resources 
P A U S E  F O R  F E E D B A C K
We just learned the elements of the balance sheet (assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity) and how 
assets and liabilities are usually classified (current or noncurrent). Current assets (including inven-
tory) are expected to be used or turned into cash within the next 12 months and current liabilities are 
expected to be paid or satisfied within the next 12 months with cash, services, or other current assets.

Unrecorded but Valuable Assets and Liabilities
Many very valuable intangible assets, such as trademarks, patents, and copyrights that are developed 
inside a company (not purchased), are not reported on the balance sheet. For example, General 
Electric’s balance sheet reveals no listing for the GE trademark because it was developed internally over 
time through research, development, and advertising (it was not purchased). Likewise, the Coca-Cola 
Company does not report any asset for its patented Coke formula, although it does report more than $6.5 
billion in various trademarks that it has purchased.
Nearly all companies have some form of off-balance-sheet financing—obligations not reported as 
liabilities on the balance sheet. For many companies, renting facilities or equipment can fall into this cate-
gory, and it can be quite significant. For example, Delta Air Lines included in a note to the financial state-
ments in a recent annual report that over $11.1 billion in future cash flows of aircraft rental leases were 
not reported on the balance sheet as debt, an amount equal to nearly 25 percent of its total liabilities that 
were reported on the balance sheet. This also illustrates the importance of reading the notes, not just the 
financial statements, when analyzing a company’s financial information and predicting future cash flows.

and debts resulting from past transactions are recorded on the balance sheet. Transactions 
include two types of events:
 
1. External events: These are exchanges of assets, goods, or services by one party for assets, 
services, or promises to pay (liabilities) from one or more other parties. Examples include 
the purchase of a machine from a supplier, sale of merchandise to customers, borrowing of 
cash from a bank, and investment of cash in the business by the owners.
 
2. Internal events: These include certain events that are not exchanges between the business and 
other parties but nevertheless have a direct and measurable effect on the entity. Examples include 
using up insurance paid in advance and using buildings and equipment over several years.
Throughout this textbook, the word transaction is used in the broad sense to include both types 
of events.
Some important events that have a future economic impact on a company, however, are not 
reflected in the financial statements. In most cases, signing a contract is not considered to be an 
accounting transaction because it involves only the exchange of promises, not of assets such as 
cash, goods, services, or property. For example, assume that Chipotle signs an employment con-
tract with a new regional manager. From an accounting perspective, no transaction has occurred 
because no exchange of assets, goods, or services has been made. Each party to the contract has 
exchanged promises—the manager agrees to work; Chipotle agrees to pay the manager for the 
work. For each day the new manager works, however, the exchange of services for pay results in 
a transaction that Chipotle must record. Because of their importance, long-term employment con-
tracts, leases, and other commitments may need to be disclosed in notes to the financial statements.
Accounts
To accumulate the dollar effect of transactions on each financial statement item, organiza-
tions use a standardized format called an account. The resulting balances are kept separate for 
financial statement purposes. To facilitate the recording of transactions, each company estab-
lishes a chart of accounts, a list of all account titles and their unique numbers. The accounts 
are usually organized by financial statement element, with asset accounts listed first, followed 
by liability, stockholders’ equity, revenue, and expense accounts in that order. Exhibit 2.3 lists

various account titles that are quite common and are used by most companies. The exhibit also 
provides special notes to help you in learning account titles. When you are completing assign-
ments and are unsure of an account title, refer to this listing for help.
Every company creates its own chart of accounts to fit the nature of its business activi-
ties. For example, a small lawn care service may have an asset account titled Lawn Mowing 
Equipment, but a large corporation such as Dell is unlikely to report such an account. These 
differences in accounts will become more apparent as we examine the balance sheets of various 
companies. Because each company has its own chart of accounts, you should not try to memo-
rize a typical chart of accounts but focus instead on understanding the nature of each typical 
account. Then when you see a company that uses a slightly different title, you will understand 
what it means. For example, some companies use the terms Trade Accounts Receivable (same 
as Accounts Receivable) or Merchandise Inventory (same as Inventory). In homework prob-
lems, you will either be given the account names or be expected to select appropriate names, 
similar to the ones in Exhibit 2.3. Once you select a name for an account, you must use that 
exact name in all transactions affecting that account.
The accounts you see in the financial statements of most large corporations are actually 
summations (or aggregations) of a number of specific accounts in their recordkeeping system. 
For example, Chipotle keeps separate accounts for food, beverage, and packaging supplies 
but combines them under Supplies on the balance sheet. Other Accrued Expenses Payable 
summarizes several accounts with smaller balances and may include Interest Payable and 
Utilities Payable.

Managers’ business decisions often result in transactions that affect the financial statements. 
For example, decisions to expand the number of stores, advertise a new product, change an 
employee benefit package, and invest excess cash would all affect the financial statements. 
Sometimes these decisions have unintended consequences as well. The decision to purchase 
additional inventory for cash in anticipation of a major sales initiative, for example, will 
increase inventory and decrease cash. But if there is no demand for the additional inventory, 
the lower cash balance will also reduce the company’s ability to pay its other obligations.
Because business decisions often involve an element of risk, managers should understand 
exactly how transactions impact the financial statements. The process for determining the 
effects of transactions is called transaction analysis.
Principles of Transaction Analysis
Transaction analysis is the process of studying a transaction to determine its economic effect 
on the entity in terms of the accounting equation (also known as the fundamental accounting 
model). We outline the process in this section of the chapter and create a visual tool repre-
senting the process (the transaction analysis model). The basic accounting equation and two 
principles are the foundation for this model. Recall from Chapter 1 that the basic accounting 
equation for a business that is organized as a corporation is as follows:
Assets (A) = Liabilities (L) + Stockholders’ Equity (SE)
The two principles underlying the transaction analysis process follow:

 Every transaction affects at least two accounts; correctly identifying those accounts and the 
direction of the effect (whether an increase or a decrease) is critical.

 The accounting equation must remain in balance after each transaction.
Success in performing transaction analysis depends on a clear understanding of these 
principles. Study the following material well.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2-3
Apply transaction analysis to 
simple business transactions 
in terms of the accounting 
model: Assets = Liabilities + 
Stockholders’ Equity.

Dual Effects
The idea that every transaction has at least two effects on the basic accounting equation 
is known as the dual effects concept.3 Most transactions with external parties involve an 
exchange by which the business entity both receives something and gives up something 
in return. For example, suppose Chipotle purchased tomatoes for cash. In this exchange, 
Chipotle would receive food supplies (an increase in an asset) and in return would give up cash 
(a decrease in an asset).
3From this concept, accountants have developed what is known as the double-entry system of recordkeeping.

In analyzing this transaction, we determined that the accounts affected were Supplies and

that case, Chipotle would engage in two separate transactions at different points in time:

Balancing the Accounting Equation
Notice in the previous tomato purchase illustrations that the accounting equation for each 
transaction remained in balance. The accounting equation must remain in balance after each 
transaction. That is, total assets (resources) must equal total liabilities and stockholders’ equity 


C H A P TER  2  Investing and Financing Decisions and the Accounting System

(claims to resources). If all correct accounts have been identified and the appropriate direction 
of the effect on each account has been determined, the equation should remain in balance.
Systematic transaction analysis for investing and financing activities includes the  
 
following steps:
Step 1: Ask → What was received and what was given?
 
· Identify the account affected by title (e.g., Cash and Notes Payable).  
Remember: Make sure that at least two accounts change.
 
· Classify each account by type: Asset (A), Liability (L), or Stockholders’ Equity (SE) 
(e.g., Cash is an asset).
 
· Determine the direction of the effect: Did the account increase (+) or decrease (-)?
Step 2: Verify → Is the accounting equation in balance? (A = L + SE)
Analyzing Chipotle’s Transactions
To illustrate the use of the transaction analysis process, let’s consider transactions of Chipotle 
that are also common to most businesses. Remember that this chapter presents transactions 
that affect only the balance sheet accounts. Assume that Chipotle engages in the following 
events during the first quarter of 2015, the first three months following the balance sheet in 
Exhibit 2.2. Account titles are from that balance sheet, and remember that, for simplicity, all 
amounts are in thousands, except per share data:
(a)  
Chipotle issued (sold) 10,000 additional shares of common stock with a par value of 
$0.01 per share at a market value of $0.37 per share, receiving $3,700 in cash from 
investors. Each share of common stock usually has a nominal (low) par value printed on 
the face of the certificate. Par value is a legal amount per share established by the board of 
directors; it has no relationship to the market price of the stock. Its significance is that it 
establishes the minimum amount that a stockholder must contribute. Chipotle’s common 
stock has a par value of $0.01 per share, and in this transaction, each share sold for $0.37 
per share. When a corporation issues common (capital) stock, the amount received affects 
separate accounts:
  
Common Stock for the number of shares issued times the par value per share (10,000 
shares × $0.01 par value per share = $100)
  
Additional Paid-in Capital (or Paid-in Capital or Contributed Capital in Excess of 
Par) for the excess received above par (10,000 shares × $0.36 excess over par value per 
share = $3,600)
  
Cash or other considerations for the market value of the shares given (10,000 shares × 
$0.37 market value per share = $3,700)
Step 1:  What was received and what was given (account name, type of account, amount, and direction of effect)?
Received: Cash (+A ) $3,700 
Given:      Additional stock shares:
            Common Stock (+SE) $100 (10,000 shares × $.01 per share)
           Additional Paid-in Capital (+SE) $3,600 (10,000 shares × $0.36 per share)

Transaction analysis involves identifying accounts affected in a transaction (by title), recognizing that 
at least two accounts are affected, classifying the accounts (asset, liability, or stockholders’ equity), 
and determining the direction of the effect on the account (increase or decrease). If all accounts and 
effects are correct, then the fundamental accounting equation (A = L + SE) will remain in balance. 
Practice is the most effective way to develop your transaction analysis skills.

For most organizations, recording transaction effects and keeping track of account balances 
in the manner just presented is impractical. To handle the multitude of daily transactions that 
a business generates, companies establish accounting systems, usually computerized, that 
follow a cycle. Exhibit 2.4 presents the primary activities of the accounting cycle performed 
during the accounting period separately from those that occur at the end of the accounting 
period. In Chapters 2 and 3, we will illustrate realistic transactions during Chipotle’s first

quarter of 2015. In Chapter 4, we will complete the accounting cycle by discussing and 
illustrating activities at the end of the period to adjust the records, prepare financial state-
ments, and finally close the accounting records.
During the accounting period, transactions that result in exchanges between the company 
and other external parties are analyzed to determine the accounts and effects. The effects are 
recorded first in the general journal, a listing in chronological order of each transaction’s 
effects. To determine account balances, the accounts are updated by posting the effects listed in 
the general journal to the respective accounts in the general ledger, a record of effects to and 
balances of each account.
These formal records are based on two very important tools used by accountants: journal 
entries and T-accounts. From the standpoint of accounting systems design, these analytical 
tools are a more efficient way to reflect the effects of transactions, determine account bal-
ances, and prepare financial statements. As future business managers, you should develop your 
understanding and use of these tools in financial analysis. For those studying accounting, this 
knowledge is the foundation for an understanding of the accounting system and future account-
ing coursework. After we explain how to perform transaction analysis using these tools, we 
illustrate their use in financial analysis.
The Direction of Transaction Effects
As we saw earlier in this chapter, transaction effects increase and decrease assets, liabilities, 
and stockholders’ equity accounts. To reflect these effects efficiently, we need to structure the 
transaction analysis model in a manner that shows the direction of the effects. As shown in 
Exhibit 2.5, each account is set up as a “T” with the following structure:

 Increases in asset accounts are on the left because assets are on the left side of the 
accounting equation (A = L + SE).

 Increases in liability and stockholders’ equity accounts are on the right because they are 
on the right side of the accounting equation (A = L + SE).
Also notice that:

 The term debit (dr for short) always refers to the left side of the T.

 The term credit (cr for short) always refers to the right side of the T.
ACCOUNTING CYCLE
The process used by entities to 
analyze and record transactions, 
adjust the records at the end 
of the period, prepare financial 
statements, and prepare the 
records for the next cycle.
DEBIT
The left side of an account.
CREDIT
The right side of an account.

As a consequence:

 Asset accounts increase on the left (debit) side and they normally have debit balances. (It 
would be highly unusual for an asset account, such as Inventory, to have a negative [credit] 
balance.)

 Liability and stockholders’ equity accounts increase on the right (credit) side and they nor-
mally have credit balances.

In Chapter 3, we will add revenue and expense account effects to Retained Earnings in our 
model. Until then, as you are learning to perform transaction analysis, you should refer to 
the transaction analysis model in Exhibit 2.5 often until you can construct it on your own 
without assistance.
Many students have trouble with accounting because they forget that the term debit is sim-
ply the left side of an account and the term credit is simply the right side of an account. Per-
haps someone once told you that you were a credit to your school or your family. As a result, 
you may think that credits are good and debits are bad. Such is not the case. Just remember that 
debit is on the left and credit is on the right.
If you have identified the correct accounts and effects through transaction analysis, the 
accounting equation will remain in balance. The total dollar value of all debits will equal the 
total dollar value of all credits in a transaction. For an extra measure of assurance, add this 
equality check (Debits = Credits) to the transaction analysis process.
EXHIBIT 2.5
Basic Transaction Analysis 
Model
P A U S E  F O R  F E E D B A C K
From Exhibit 2.5, we learned that each account can increase and decrease. In the transaction analysis 
model, the effect of a transaction on each element can be represented with a T with one side increas-
ing and the other side decreasing. Asset accounts on the left side of the fundamental accounting 
equation increase their balances on the left side of the T. Liability and stockholders’ equity accounts 
are on the right side of the fundamental accounting equation and increase their balance on the right 
side of the T. In accounting, the left side of the T is called the debit side and the right is called the 
credit side. Most accounts have a balance on the positive side.

Analytical Tools
The Journal Entry
In a bookkeeping system, transactions are recorded in chronological order in a general journal 
(or, simply, journal). After analyzing the business documents (such as purchase invoices, receipts, 
and cash register tapes) that describe a transaction, the bookkeeper enters the effects on the 
accounts in the journal using debits and credits. The journal entry, then, is an accounting method 
for expressing the effects of a transaction on accounts. It is written in a debits-equal-credits format. 
To illustrate, we refer back to event (a) in Chipotle’s transaction analyis in the previous section.
(a)  
Chipotle issued (sold) 10,000 additional shares of common stock with a par value of $0.01 
per share at a market value of $0.37 per share, receiving $3,700 in cash from investors.
The journal entry for event (a) in the Chipotle illustration is as follows:

Credited accounts on bottom, usually indented. 
Reference:

Amounts:

Notice the following:

 It is useful to include a date or some form of reference for each transaction. The debited accounts 
are written first (on top) with the amounts recorded in the left column. The credited accounts are 
written below the debits and are usually indented in manual records; the credited amounts are 
written in the right column. The order of the debited accounts or credited accounts does not mat-
ter, as long as the debits are on top and the credits are on the bottom and indented to the right.

 Total debits ($3,700) equal total credits ($100 + $3,600 = $3,700).

 Three accounts are affected by this transaction. Any journal entry that affects more than two 
accounts is called a compound entry. Many transactions in this and subsequent chapters 
require a compound journal entry.

 As you can see in the illustration of a formal bookkeeping system in Exhibit 2.6, an addi-
tional line is written below the journal entry as an explanation of the transaction. For sim-
plicity, explanations will not be included in this text.
While you are learning to perform transaction analysis, use the symbols A, L, and SE next to 
each account title, as in the preceding journal entry. Specifically identifying accounts as assets 
(A), liabilities (L), or stockholders’ equity (SE) clarifies the transaction analysis and makes 
journal entries easier to write. For example, if Cash is to be increased, we write Cash (+A). 
Throughout subsequent chapters, we include the direction of the effect along with the symbol 
to help you understand the effects of each transaction on the financial statements. In transaction

(a) above, we can see that assets are affected by +$3,700 and stockholders’ equity accounts are 
affected by +$3,700. The accounting equation A = L + SE remains in balance.
A note of caution: Many students try to memorize journal entries without understanding or using 
the transaction analysis model. As more detailed transactions are presented in subsequent chapters, 
the task becomes increasingly more difficult. In the long run, memorizing, understanding, and 
using the transaction analysis model presented here will save you time and prevent confusion.
The T-Account
By themselves, journal entries do not provide the balances in accounts. After the journal 
entries have been recorded, the bookkeeper posts (transfers) the dollar amounts to each account 
affected by the transaction to determine the new account balances. (In most computerized 
accounting systems, this happens automatically.)
As a group, the accounts are called a general ledger. In the manual accounting system used 
by some small organizations, the ledger is often a three-ring binder with a separate page for 
each account. In a computerized system, accounts are stored on a disk. See Exhibit 2.6 for an 
illustration of a journal page and the related ledger pages. Note that the cash effects from the 
journal entry have been posted to the Cash ledger page.
One very useful tool for summarizing the transaction effects and determining the balances for 
individual accounts is a T-account, a simplified representation of a ledger account. Exhibit 2.7 
 
shows the T-accounts for Chipotle’s Cash and Common Stock accounts based on Event (a). 
Notice that, for Cash, which is classified as an asset, increases are shown on the left and 
decreases appear on the right side of the T-account. For Common Stock, however, increases 
are shown on the right and decreases on the left since Common Stock is a stockholders’ equity 
account. Many small businesses still use handwritten or manually maintained accounts in this 
T-account format. Computerized systems retain the concept but not the format of the T-account.

A word on terminology: The words debit and credit may be used as verbs, nouns, and adjec-
tives. For example, we can say that Chipotle’s Cash account was debited (verb) when stock was 
issued to investors, meaning that the amount was entered on the left side of the T-account. Or 
we can say that a credit (noun) was entered on the right side of an account. Common Stock may 
be described as a credit account (adjective). These terms will be used instead of left and right 
throughout the rest of this textbook. The next section illustrates the steps to follow in analyz-
ing the effects of transactions, recording the effects in journal entries, and determining account 
balances using T-accounts.

Inferring Business Activities from T-Accounts
T-accounts are useful primarily for instructional and analytical purposes. In many cases, we will use 
T-accounts to determine what transactions a company engaged in during a period. For example, the 
primary transactions affecting Accounts Payable for a period are purchases of assets on account from 
suppliers and cash payments to suppliers. If we know the beginning and ending balances of Accounts 
Payable and all the amounts that were purchased on credit during a period, we can determine the amount 
of cash paid. A T-account analysis would include the following:
- Accounts Payable (L) +

Transaction Analysis Illustrated
In this section, we will use the quarterly investing and financing transactions for Chipotle Mexican 
Grill (events [a] to [ f ]) that were analyzed earlier to demonstrate recording journal entries and 
posting effects to the relevant T-accounts. Note that the accounting equation remains in balance 
and that debits equal credits after each entry. In the T-accounts, the amounts from Chipotle’s 
December 31, 2014, balance sheet (Exhibit 2.2) have been inserted as the beginning balances.
Study this illustration carefully, including the explanations of transaction analysis. Careful 
study is essential to an understanding of (1) the accounting model, (2) transaction analysis, 
(3) the dual effects of each transaction, and (4) the dual-balancing system. The most effective 
way to learn these critical concepts, which are basic to material throughout the rest of the text, 
is to practice, practice, practice.
(a)  
Chipotle issued (sold) 10,000 additional shares of common stock with a par value of $0.01 
per share at a market value of $0.37 per share, receiving $3,700 in cash from investors. Com-
mon stock is recorded at par (10,000 shares × $0.01 par value per share) and Additional 
Paid-in Capital is recorded for the excess over par value (10,000 shares × $0.36 per share).

  The effects reflected in the journal entry have been posted to the appropriate T-accounts. 
Notice that if an account was debited such as Cash, that effect was written in the debit col-
umn of the Cash T-account. Similarly, if an account was credited such as Common Stock, 
that effect was written in the credit column of the T-account. Also notice that the January 
1, 2015, beginning balances are the same as the ending balances at December 31, 2014, 
(see Exhibit 2.2) and are indicated on the respective positive side of the account—assets 
have debit balances and liabilities and stockholders’ equity accounts have credit balances.
(b)  
Chipotle borrowed $2,000 from its local bank, signing a note to be paid in three years. 
Since Notes Payable is a new account not listed on the December 31, 2014, balance sheet

Chipotle does not pay dividends, but instead reinvests profits into growing the business. 
However, for illustration purposes, assume Chipotle’s board of directors declared 
that the Company will pay $3,000 in cash as dividends to shareholders next quarter. 
Because Dividends Payable was not listed on the December 31, 2014, balance sheet (see 
Exhibit 2.2), it has a $0 balance on January 1, 2015.

Accountants analyze and then record transactions in the general journal in chronological order in 
journal entry form. Debited accounts are written on top with amounts in the left column and credited 
accounts are written on the bottom with amounts in the right column. Then the effects are posted in 
the general ledger (similar to a T-account). Each page of the ledger represents a different account that 
has a debit (left) side and a credit (right) side. To post transaction effects, the amount for each account 
in a journal entry is written in the appropriate debit or credit column on the ledger page to obtain 
account balances. Refer to Exhibit 2.5 for the transaction analysis model.
S E L F - S T U D Y  Q U I Z

Although no operating activities occurred yet (they will be illustrated in Chapter 3), it is possible to 
create a balance sheet based solely on the investing and financing activities recorded above. Usu-
ally, businesses will create a trial balance spreadsheet first for internal purposes before preparing 
statements for external users. A trial balance lists the names of the T-accounts in one column, usu-
ally in financial statement order (assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenues, and expenses), 
with their ending debit or credit balances in the next two columns. Debit balances are indicated in 
the left column and credit balances are indicated in the right column. Then the two columns are 
totaled to provide a check on the equality of the debits and credits. Errors in a computer-generated 
trial balance may exist if wrong accounts and/or amounts are used in the journal entries.4
Chipotle’s trial balance follows. The account balances that did not change are taken from 
the December 31, 2014, balance sheet in Exhibit 2.2. The accounts that did change due to the 
investing and financing transactions illustrated in this chapter are shaded; their balances are 
taken from the T-accounts summarized at the end of the previous section.

the current ratio.
4In homework assignments, if you have an error in your trial balance (the two column totals are not equal), errors 
can be traced and should be corrected before adjusting the records. To find errors, reverse your steps. Check that:

 You copied the ending balances in all of the T-accounts (both amount and whether a debit or credit) correctly 
to the trial balance.

 You computed the ending balances in the T-accounts correctly.

 You posted the transaction effects correctly from the journal entries to the T-accounts (amount, account, and 
whether a debit or credit).

 You prepared the journal entries correctly (amount, account, and whether a debit or credit).

The balance sheet in Exhibit 2.8 was prepared from the trial balance as shown above. As a 
formal statement for external users, it needs a good heading (name of the company, title of the 
statement, date, and if the dollars are in thousands or millions). Notice in Exhibit 2.8 several 
additional features:

 The assets and liabilities are classified into two categories: current and noncurrent. Cur-
rent assets are those to be used or turned into cash within the upcoming year, whereas

noncurrent assets are those that will last longer than one year. Current liabilities are those 
obligations to be paid or settled within the next 12 months with current assets.

 Dollar signs are indicated at the top and bottom of the asset section and top and bottom of 
the liabilities and shareholders’ equity section. More than that tends to look messy.

 The statement includes comparative data. That is, it compares the account balances at 
December 31, 2014, with those at March 31, 2015. When multiple periods are presented, the 
most recent balance sheet amounts are usually listed on the left.

 Unlike Chipotle, most companies do not provide a total liabilities line on the balance sheet. 
To determine total liabilities on those statements, add total current liabilities and each of the 
noncurrent liabilities.
Although IFRS differs from GAAP, they use the same system of analyzing, recording, and summarizing 
the results of business activities that you have learned in this chapter. One place where IFRS differs from 
GAAP is in the formatting of financial statements.
Financial statements prepared using GAAP and IFRS include the same elements (assets, liabilities, 
revenues, expenses, etc.). However, a single, consistent format has not been mandated. Consequently, 
various formats have evolved over time, with those in the United States differing from those typically 
used internationally. The formatting differences include:
GAAP
IFRS
Balance Sheet Order
Assets:
Assets:
 Current
 Noncurrent
Similar accounts are 
shown, but the order of 
liquidity (for assets) and 
the order of maturity (for 
liabilities) differ
 Noncurrent
 Current
Liabilities:
Stockholders’ Equity
 Current
Liabilities:
 Noncurrent
 Noncurrent
Stockholders’ Equity
 Current
On the balance sheet, GAAP begins with current items whereas IFRS begins with noncurrent items. 
Consistent with this, assets are listed in decreasing order of liquidity under GAAP, but internation-
ally assets are usually listed in increasing order of liquidity. IFRS similarly emphasizes longer-term 
financing sources by listing equity before liabilities and, within liabilities, by listing noncurrent liabili-
ties before current liabilities (decreasing time to maturity). The key to avoiding confusion is to be sure 
to pay attention to the subheadings in the statement. Any account under the heading “liabilities” must 
be a liability.

Ratio Analysis in Decision Making
Why do the classifications of current and noncurrent on the balance sheet matter? Users of 
financial information compute a number of ratios in analyzing a company’s past performance 
and financial condition as input in predicting its future potential. How ratios change over time 
and how they compare to the ratios of the company’s competitors or industry averages provide 
valuable information about a company’s strategies for its operating, investing, and financing 
activities. We introduce here the first of many ratios that will be presented throughout the rest 
of this textbook, with a final summary of ratio analysis in Chapter 13.

INTERPRETATIONS
In General The current ratio is a very common ratio. Creditors and security analysts use the current 
ratio to measure the ability of the company to pay its short-term obligations with short-term assets. 
Generally, the higher the ratio, the more cushion a company has to pay its current obligations if future 
economic conditions take a downturn. While a ratio above 1.0 normally suggests good liquidity, today, 
many strong companies use sophisticated management techniques to minimize funds invested in current 
assets and, as a result, have current ratios below 1.0. Likewise, when compared to others in the industry, 
too high of a ratio may suggest inefficient use of resources.
Focus Company Analysis Over time, the current ratio for Chipotle shows a high level of liquidity, well 
above 1.0, and the ratio has risen each year since 2012. Chipotle has high growth strategies requiring cash 
to fund expansion.
Compared with competitors, Panera Bread, vying with Chipotle as the top fast-casual restaurant, also 
maintains a current ratio above 1.0, and both companies report cash as the largest current asset. The ratio 
for Chipotle is much higher than for Fiesta Restaurant Group, which reports a current ratio below 1.0. 
Fiesta Restaurant Group owns and franchises two quick-service brands: Pollo Tropical, featuring a tropi-
cal and Caribbean-style menu, and Taco Cabana, offering Mexican fast food. Fiesta expects growth, but 
franchising (that is, selling rights to others to operate restaurants under the company brands) does not 
require the cash flow levels needed for company-owned facilities. It is also likely that all of these com-
panies have sophisticated cash management systems that enable them to maintain lower cash balances.
Reuters reports that the fast-casual sector of the restaurant industry has an average current ratio of 
1.73 while the broader restaurant industry’s average is 1.23. Compared to the sector average, Chipotle has 
sufficient current assets to pay short-term obligations (adequate liquidity), while Panera Bread and Fiesta 
Restaurant Group have current ratios below the industry average, suggesting these companies may rely 
on sufficient cash flows generated during the year to meet current obligations.
A Few Cautions The current ratio may be a misleading measure of liquidity if significant funds are 
tied up in assets that cannot be easily converted into cash. A company with a high current ratio might still 
have liquidity problems if the majority of its current assets consists of slow-moving inventory. Analysts 
also recognize that managers can manipulate the current ratio by engaging in certain transactions just 
before the close of the fiscal year. In most cases, for example, the current ratio can be improved by paying 
creditors immediately prior to the preparation of financial statements.

We just learned that the current ratio measures a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations with 
short-term assets—a liquidity measure. It is computed by dividing current assets by current liabilities. A 
ratio above 1.0 is normally considered good, although some may need a higher ratio and others with good 
cash management systems can have a ratio below 1.0 (i.e., more current liabilities than current assets).

Yum! Brands, Inc., is the world’s largest quick-service restaurant company that develops, franchises, 
and operates 41,000 units in more than 125 countries and territories through three restaurant concepts 
(KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell). The company reported the following balances on its recent balance 
sheets (in millions). Compute Yum! Brands’s current ratio for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014.

Investing and Financing Activities
F O C US  ON
CAS H  FLOW S
As discussed in Chapter 1, companies report cash inflows and outflows over a period in their statement 
of cash flows, which is divided into three categories: operating, investing, and financing activities:

 Operating activities are covered in Chapter 3.

 Investing activities include buying and selling noncurrent assets and investments.

 Financing activities include borrowing and repaying debt, including short-term bank loans; 
issuing and repurchasing stock; and paying dividends.
Only transactions affecting cash are reported on the statement. An important step in constructing and 
analyzing the statement of cash flows is identifying the various transactions as operating (O), investing 
(I), or financing (F). Let’s analyze the Cash T-account for Chipotle’s transactions in this chapter. Refer to 
transactions (a)–(f) illustrated earlier in this chapter, and remember, you must see cash in the transac-
tion for it to affect the statement of cash flows.

Yum! Brands’s current ratio is below 1.0 and falling over the three years, suggesting the company has a low 
level of liquidity—insufficient current assets to settle short-term obligations. However, as a cash-oriented 
business and with a strong cash management system, Yum! Brands’s current ratio below 1.0 is not a concern.

As we discussed, every transaction affecting cash can be classified either as an operating (discussed in 
Chapter 3), investing, or financing effect. Investing effects relate to purchasing/selling investments or 
property and equipment or lending funds to/receiving repayment from others. Financing effects relate

2-1. Define the objective of financial reporting, the elements of the balance sheet, and the related 
key accounting assumptions and principles. p. 45
Objective:

 The primary objective of financial reporting to external users is to provide financial information 
about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders, and other 
creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the entity.
Qualitative characteristics of useful financial information:

 Relevance (including materiality) allows users to assess past activities and/or predict future 
activities.

 Faithful representation requires information to be complete, neutral, and free from error.
 
 To enhance its qualitative characteristics, information should also be comparable (to other 
companies and over time), verifiable, timely, and understandable.
Key recognition, measurement, and disclosure concepts:
Assumptions—

 Separate entity assumption—Transactions of the business are accounted for separately from 
transactions of the owner.

 Going concern assumption—A business is expected to continue to operate into the foreseeable 
future.

 Monetary unit assumption—Financial information is reported in the national monetary unit 
without adjustment for changes in purchasing power.
Principles—

 Mixed-attribute measurement model—Most balance sheet elements are recorded following the 
historical cost (or cost) principle—financial statement elements should be recorded at the cash-
equivalent cost on the date of the transaction; however, these values may be adjusted to other 
amounts, such as market value, depending on certain conditions.
Elements of the balance sheet:

 Assets—Probable future economic benefits owned or controlled by the entity as a result of past 
transactions.

 Liabilities—Probable future sacrifices of economic benefits arising from present obligations of 
a business as a result of past transactions.
C H A P T E R  T A K E - A W A Y S


75
C H A P TER  2   Investing and Financing Decisions and the Accounting System

 Stockholders’ equity—Residual interest of owners in the assets of the entity after settling lia-
bilities; the financing provided by the owners (contributed capital) and by business operations 
(earned capital).
 
2-2. Identify what constitutes a business transaction and recognize common balance sheet account 
titles used in business. p. 49

 An exchange of cash, goods, or services for cash, goods, services, or promises between a busi-
ness and one or more external parties to a business (not the exchange of a promise for a promise),
or

 A measurable internal event, such as adjustments for the use of assets in operations.
An account is a standardized format that organizations use to accumulate the dollar effects of trans-
actions related to each financial statement item. Typical balance sheet account titles include the 
following:

 Assets: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Prepaid Expenses, Investments, Property (build-
ings and land) and Equipment, and Intangibles (rights without physical substance).

 Liabilities: Accounts Payable, Notes Payable, Accrued Expenses Payable, Unearned Revenues, 
and Taxes Payable.

 Stockholders’ Equity: Common Stock, Additional Paid-in Capital, and Retained Earnings.
 
2-3. Apply transaction analysis to simple business transactions in terms of the accounting model: 
Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity. p. 51
To determine the economic effect of a transaction on an entity in terms of the accounting equation, 
each transaction must be analyzed to determine the accounts (at least two) that are affected. In an 
exchange, the company receives something and gives up something. If the accounts, direction of 
the effects, and amounts are correctly analyzed, the accounting equation will stay in balance. The 
transaction analysis model is:
Assets  
(many accounts)
=
Liabilities  
(many accounts)
+
Stockholders’ Equity  
Contributed Capital (2 accounts) 
Earned Capital (1 account)
+
-

Investment

(expanded

Systematic transaction analysis includes (1) determining the accounts that were received and were 
given in the exchange, including the type of each account (A, L, or SE), the amounts, and the direc-
tion of the effects, and (2) determining that the accounting equation remains in balance.
 
2-4. Determine the impact of business transactions on the balance sheet using two basic tools: 
Journal entries and T-accounts. p. 56

 Journal entries express the effects of a transaction on accounts in a debits-equal-credits format. 
The accounts and amounts to be debited are listed first. Then the accounts and amounts to be 
credited are listed below the debits and indented, resulting in debit amounts on the left and credit 
amounts on the right. Each entry needs a reference (date, number, or letter).

2-5. Prepare a trial balance and simple classified balance sheet, and analyze the company using 
the current ratio. p. 66
A trial balance lists all accounts and their balances, with debit balances in the left column and credit 
balances in the right column. The two columns are added to determine if debits equal credits.
Classified balance sheets are structured as follows:

 Assets are categorized as current assets (those to be used or turned into cash within the year, 
with inventory always considered a current asset) and noncurrent assets, such as long-term 
investments, property and equipment, and intangible assets.

 Liabilities are categorized as current liabilities (those that will be paid with current assets) and 
long-term liabilities.

 Stockholders’ equity accounts are listed as Common Stock (number of shares × par value per 
share) and Additional Paid-in Capital (number of shares × excess of market value over par value 
per share) first, followed by Retained Earnings (earnings reinvested in the business).
The current ratio (Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities) measures a company’s liquidity, that is, the 
ability of the company to pay its short-term obligations with current assets.
 
2-6. Identify investing and financing transactions and demonstrate how they impact cash  
flows. p. 70
A statement of cash flows reports the sources and uses of cash for the period by the type of activ-
ity that generated the cash flow: operating, investing, and financing. Investing activities include 
purchasing and selling long-term assets and making loans and receiving principal repayments from 
others. Financing activities include borrowing from and repaying to banks the principal on loans, 
issuing and repurchasing stock, and paying dividends.
In this chapter, we discussed the fundamental accounting model and transaction analysis. Journal 
entries and T-accounts were used to record the results of transaction analysis for investing and financing 
decisions that affect balance sheet accounts. In Chapter 3, we continue our detailed look at the financial 
statements, in particular the income statement. The purpose of Chapter 3 is to build on your knowledge 
by discussing the measurement of revenues and expenses and illustrating the transaction analysis of 
operating decisions.
K E Y  R A T I O
Current ratio measures the ability of the company to pay its short-term obligations with current 
assets. Although a ratio above 1.0 indicates sufficient current assets to meet obligations when they 
come due, many companies with sophisticated cash management systems have ratios below 1.0 (see 
the “Key Ratio Analysis” box in the How Is the Balance Sheet Prepared and Analyzed? section):
Current Ratio = 
Current Assets

in April.
Required:
 1. For each of the events (a) through (g), prepare journal entries if a transaction of the business exists, 
checking that debits equal credits. If a transaction does not exist, explain why there is no transaction 
for the business.
 2. Create T-accounts, and post each of the transactions to determine balances at March 31. Because this 
is a new business, beginning balances are $0.
 3. Prepare a trial balance on March 31 to check that debits equal credits after the transactions are 
posted to the T-accounts.
 4. From the trial balance, prepare a classified balance sheet (with current assets and current liabilities 
sections) at March 31 (before the beginning of operations in April).
 5. For each of the events (a) through (g), indicate if it is an investing activity (I) or financing activity 
(F), and the direction (+ for increases; - for decreases) and amount of the effect on cash flows using

Financial Reporting and Analysis Cases
Broadening Financial Research Skills: Locating Financial Information on the SEC’s Database  
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates companies that issue stock on the stock mar-
ket. It receives financial reports from public companies electronically under a system called EDGAR 
(Electronic Data Gathering and Retrieval Service). Using the Internet, anyone may search the database 
for the reports that have been filed.
Using your Web browser, access the EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. To search the database, click 
on “Company Filings” at the top of the page. Then type in “chipotle” for the company name in the search 
window, and press enter.
Required:
To look at SEC filings, type in “10-Q” in the space indicating “Filing Type” and press enter. Skim 
down the left side until you locate the Form 10-Q (quarterly report) filed October 21, 2014. Click on 
the “Documents” for that report, click on the 10-Q document (first item), and skim to the Table of 
Contents.
 1. Click on “Financial Statements” and skim to the “Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.”
 
a. What was the amount of Chipotle’s total assets for the most recent quarter reported?
 
b. Did current liabilities increase or decrease since December 31, 2013?
 
c. Compute the current ratio. How does it compare to the ratio indicated for Chipotle Mexican Grill 
in the chapter at December 31, 2014? What does this suggest about the company?
 2. Skim to the Chipotle “Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.”
 
a. What amount did Chipotle spend on “leasehold improvements, property and equipment” for the 
quarter ended September 30, 2014? (Leasehold improvements are major renovations, such as 
adding elevators, to rented property.)
 
b. What was the total amount of cash flows used in financing activities?

Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma: Analyzing Management Incentives
In July 2004, the U.S. government filed civil and criminal charges against four former executives of Neth-
erlands-based Ahold’s subsidiary U.S. Foodservice, Inc., an operator of supermarkets such as Bi-Lo 
and Giant Food Stores. Two of the four executives have pleaded guilty, and the other two were indicted. 
The alleged widespread fraud included recording completely fictitious revenues for false promotions and 
persuading vendors to confirm to auditors the false promotional payments. U.S. Attorney David Kelley 
suggested the fraud was motivated by the greed of the executives to reap fat bonuses if the company met 
certain financial goals. The auditors did not uncover the fraud.
Required:
 1. Describe the parties who were harmed or helped by this fraud.
 2. Explain how greed may have contributed to the fraud.

Operating Decisions  
and the Accounting System
C
hipotle Mexican Grill’s philosophy of “Food with Integrity” guides its operating deci-
sions. “Food with Integrity” entails finding and serving high-quality sustainably and 
organically raised food. It also includes showing respect for animals, the environment, 
and people involved in the operations. The company keeps operations simple, offering a few 
menu items (burritos, burrito bowls, tacos, and salads). Within these items, customers can 
choose from four meats, two types of beans and rice, and a variety of additional items such 
as salsa, guacamole, cheese, and lettuce—creating hundreds of options. The focused menu 
allows Chipotle to concentrate on the source of the food items, a challenging activity given 
the smaller and often costlier market for organic meats, produce, and dairy products. Antici-
pating changes in these food costs and sources is critical to determining menu prices and 
controlling costs.
To control quality and increase efficiency, the company purchases key ingredients such 
as meat, beans, and tortillas from a small number of suppliers and other raw materials from 
approved sources. Twenty-two independently owned and operated regional distribution cen-
ters purchase from these suppliers and then deliver the items as needed to the Chipotle 
restaurants in each region.
The second highest cost for Chipotle, as with most restaurants, is hiring and develop-
ing employees. The food is prepared from scratch on stoves and grills, not with microwaves 


Chipotle Mexican Grill
IT’S MORE THAN MEAT, 
GUACAMOLE, AND TORTILLAS

chapter 3
and other automated cooking techniques. Each employee is trained in all aspects 
of preparing the food—from grilling, to making fresh salsa, to cooking rice—and 
creating a positive interactive experience for customers. The company has numer-
ous incentives to develop strong leadership, with about 90 percent of salaried 
management and about 98 percent of hourly management promoted from within 
the company.
Chipotle also competes using marketing strategies. Chipotle spends less on 
expensive national advertising campaigns than larger restaurant chains and much 
more on strategic promotional activities to make connections with neighborhoods 
and explain how Chipotle is different. Most activities are innovative, such as the 
award-winning two-minute animated video “Back to the Start” that aired during the 
2012 Grammy Awards; the Cultivate Chicago festival featuring indie bands, arti-
sanal food, wine producers, and high-profile chefs; and the Chipotle Truck, which 
travels to various locations, including new store openings, and sells almost a full 
menu of Chipotle items from the food trailer. As stated in its 2014 annual report:
Collectively, these efforts and our excellent restaurant teams have helped us cre-
ate considerable word-of-mouth publicity as our customers learn more about us 
and share with others. This approach allows us to build awareness and loyalty 
with relatively low advertising expenditures, even in a competitive category, and 
to differentiate Chipotle as a company that is committed to doing the right thing 
in every facet of our business.

The restaurant industry is extremely competitive. For example, in February 2012, McDonald’s 
Corporation announced a requirement that suppliers need to phase out stalls that restrict 
the movement of pregnant pigs, a change made in direct response to Chipotle’s TV video on 
its ethical stance aired at the Grammy Awards. Taco Bell announced in July 2012 the cre-
ation of a Cantina Bell™ menu featuring “gourmet” food items such as the Cantina Burrito 
and Cantina Bowl. Jack in the Box, Inc., is expanding its Qdoba Mexican Grill chain to com-
pete in the fast-casual segment of the industry that is dominated by Mexican restaurants.
Restaurants have to manage economic downturns and shifts in consumer tastes for health-
ier food choices while facing the competition. Recent trends in mobile technology apps for 
ordering, customer payment, and loyalty program management; equipment improvements, 
such as 1,000-degree ovens for baking two-minute pizzas; and the tremendous expansion 
of fast-casual restaurant concepts provide challenges. Based on their projections of these 
forces, companies set goals for their performance. Published income statements provide the 
primary basis for comparing projections to the actual results of operations. To understand 
how business plans and the results of operations are reflected on the income statement, we 
need to answer the following questions:
 
1. How do business activities affect the income statement?
 
2. How are business activities measured?
 
3. How are business activities reported on the income statement?
In this chapter we focus on Chipotle’s operating activities that involve the sale of food to 
the public. The results of these activities are reported on the income statement.

The Operating Cycle
The long-term objective for any business is to turn cash into more cash. If a company is to 
stay in business, this excess cash must be generated from operations (that is, from the activities 
for which the business was established), not from borrowing money or selling long-lived assets.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE 3-1
Describe a typical business 
operating cycle and explain the 
necessity for the time period 
assumption.


C H A P TER  3  Operating Decisions and the Accounting System

Companies (1) acquire inventory and the services of employees and (2) sell inventory or ser-
vices to customers. The operating (cash-to-cash) cycle begins when a company receives goods 
to sell, pays for them, and sells to customers (or, in the case of a service company, has employ-
ees work to provide services to customers); it ends when customers pay cash to the company. 
The length of time for completion of the operating cycle depends on the nature of the business.

Typical Operating Cycle
BEGIN OPERATING
(CASH-TO-CASH)
CYCLE
Receive cash
from customers
The operating cycle for Chipotle is relatively short. It spends cash to purchase fresh ingredi-
ents, prepares the food, and sells it to customers for cash. In some companies, inventory is paid for 
well before it is sold. Toys R Us, for example, builds its inventory for months preceding the year-
end holiday season. It borrows funds from banks to pay for the inventory and repays the loans 
with interest when it receives cash from customers. In other companies, cash is received from 
customers well after a sale takes place. For example, furniture retailers often allow customers to 
make monthly payments over several years. Shortening the operating cycle by creating incentives 
that encourage customers to buy sooner and/or pay faster improves a company’s cash flows.
Until a company ceases its activities, the operating cycle is repeated continuously. However, 
decision makers require information periodically about the company’s financial condition and 
performance. As indicated in the conceptual framework in Exhibit 2.1, to measure income for 
a specific period of time, accountants follow the time period assumption, which assumes that 
the long life of a company can be reported in shorter time periods, such as months, quarters, 
and years.1 Two types of issues arise in reporting periodic income to users:
 
1. Recognition issues: When should the effects of operating activities be recognized (recorded)?
 
2. Measurement issues: What amounts should be recognized?
Before we examine the rules accountants follow in resolving these issues, however, let’s 
examine the elements of the income statement that are affected by operating activities.

requires public companies to do so.

Elements of the Income Statement
Exhibit 3.1 shows a recent income statement for Chipotle, simplified for the purposes of this 
chapter. It has multiple subtotals, such as operating income and income before income taxes. 
This format is known as multiple step and is very common.2 In fact, you can tell if a company 
uses the multiple-step format if you see the Operating Income (also called Income from Opera-
tions) subtotal. As we discuss the elements of the income statement, also refer to the conceptual 
framework outlined in Exhibit 2.1.
Operating Revenues
Revenues are defined as increases in assets or settlements of liabilities from the major or 
central ongoing operations of the business. Operating revenues result from the sale of goods 
or the rendering of services as the central focus of the business. When Chipotle sells tacos to 
consumers, it has earned revenue. When revenue is earned, assets, usually Cash or Accounts 
Receivable, often increase. Sometimes if a customer pays for goods or services in advance, a 
liability account, usually Unearned (or Deferred) Revenue, is created. At this point, no revenue 
REVENUES 
Increases in assets or settlements 
of liabilities from the major or 
central ongoing operations of the 
business.
2Another common format, single step, reorganizes all accounts from the multiple-step format. All revenues and gains 
are listed together and all expenses and losses except taxes are listed together. The expense subtotal is then subtracted 
from the revenue subtotal to arrive at income before income taxes, the same subtotal as on the multiple-step statement.

has been earned. There is simply a receipt of cash in exchange for a promise to provide a good 
or service in the future. When the company provides the promised goods or services to the 
customer, then the revenue is recognized and the liability eliminated.
Many companies generate revenues from a variety of sources. For example, General Motors 
reports revenues from its automotive sales as well as from providing financing to customers. In 
the restaurant industry, many companies, such as McDonald’s Corporation, have company-
owned stores but also sell franchise rights. The franchisor (seller) reports revenues from both 
the sales of food in company-owned stores and the fees from franchisees. Chipotle does not sell 
franchises. Therefore, the company generates revenue from one source—sales of food orders to 
customers—that is reported in the Restaurant Sales Revenue account.
Operating Expenses
Some students confuse the terms expenditures and expenses. An expenditure is any outflow 
of cash for any purpose, whether to buy equipment, pay off a bank loan, or pay employees 
their wages. Expenses are outflows or the using up of assets or increases in liabilities from 
ongoing operations incurred to generate revenues during the period. Therefore, not all cash 
expenditures are expenses, but expenses are necessary to generate revenues.
Chipotle’s employees make and serve food. The company uses electricity to operate equip-
ment and light its facilities, and it uses food and paper supplies. Without incurring these 
expenses, Chipotle could not generate revenues. Expenses may be incurred before, after, or at 
the same time as cash is paid. When an expense is incurred, assets such as Supplies decrease 
(are used up) or liabilities such as Wages Payable or Utilities Payable increase. The following 
are Chipotle’s primary operating expenses:
Restaurant Operating Expenses:

  
Supplies Expense. In Chipotle’s restaurant operations, any food ingredients or bever-
age and packaging supplies that are used to produce and sell meals are expensed as 
they are used. For Chipotle, this is its largest expense at $1,421,000,000 in 2014. In 
companies with a manufacturing or merchandising focus, the most significant expense 
is usually Cost of Goods Sold (or Cost of Sales), representing the cost of inventory 
used in generating sales.

  
Wages Expense. When salaried and hourly employees work and generate sales for 
Chipotle, the company incurs an expense, although wages and salaries will be paid 
later. Wages Expense of $904,400,000 is Chipotle’s second largest expense. In purely 
service-oriented companies in which no products are produced or sold, the cost of hav-
ing employees generate revenues is usually the largest expense. For example, Federal 
Express reported over $16 billion in salaries expense for the year ended May 31, 2014.

  
Rent Expense, Insurance Expense, Utilities Expense, and Repairs Expense. Rent-
ing facilities, insuring property and equipment at the stores, using utilities, and repair-
ing and maintaining facilities and equipment are typical expenses related to operating 
stores. Usually, rent and insurance are paid before occupying the facilities, but utilities 
and repairs are paid after occupying the facilities.

  
Other Operating Expenses. These expenses include a variety of accounts with 
smaller dollar balances.
General and Administrative Expenses: General and Administrative Expenses include 
costs of training employees and managers, advertising, and other expenses not directly 
related to operating stores. These often include expenses such as renting headquarters 
facilities and paying executive salaries.
Depreciation Expense: When a company uses buildings and equipment to generate rev-
enues, a part of the cost of these assets is reported as an expense called Deprecia-
tion Expense. Chapter 8 discusses methods for estimating the amount of depreciation 
expense.

Losses (Gains) on Disposal of Assets: Companies sell property, plant, and equipment from 
time to time to maintain modern facilities. When assets other than investments are sold 
or disposed of for more than their undepreciated cost, gains result. If they are sold or dis-
posed of for less than the undepreciated cost, losses result. In 2014, Chipotle reported a 
loss on disposal of assets of $7,000,000. Note that selling short- or long-term investments 
above or below cost also results in gains or losses, but these are not reported in the Oper-
ating Expenses section of the multiple-step income statement. Instead, they are reported 
in Other Items as discussed in the next section.
Operating revenues less operating expenses equals Operating Income (also called Income 
from Operations)—a measure of the profit from central ongoing operations.
Other Items
Not all activities affecting an income statement are central to ongoing operations. Any rev-
enues, expenses, gains, or losses that result from these other activities are not included as part 
of operating income but are instead categorized as Other Items. Typically, these include the 
following:

 Interest Revenue (or Investment Revenue, Investment Income, or Dividend Revenue). 
Using excess cash to purchase stocks or bonds in other companies is an investing activity for 
Chipotle, not the central operation of making and selling fresh Mexican food. Therefore, any 
interest or dividends earned on investments in other companies is not included as operating 
revenue.

 Interest Expense. Likewise, since borrowing money is a financing activity, any cost of 
using that money (called interest) is not an operating expense. Except for financial institu-
tions, incurring interest expense and earning interest revenue are not the central operations 
of most businesses, including Chipotle. We say these are peripheral (normal but not central) 
transactions.

 Losses (Gains) on Sale of Investments. When investments are sold for more (or less) than 
the original cost, a gain (or loss) results and is reported as an Other Item on the income state-
ment. In 2014, Chipotle did not report any gains or losses from selling investments.
Income Tax Expense
Adding (subtracting) other items to (from) operating income gives a subtotal of Income 
before Income Taxes (or Pretax Income). Income Tax Expense (also called Provision for 
Income Taxes) is the last expense listed on the income statement before determining net 
income. All profit-making corporations are required to compute income taxes owed to fed-
eral, state, and foreign governments. Income tax expense is calculated as a percentage of pre-
tax income determined by applying the tax rates of the federal, state, local, and foreign taxing 
authorities. Chipotle’s effective tax rate in 2014 was 37.7 percent ($269,000,000 in income 
tax expense divided by $714,300,000 in income before income taxes). This indicates that, 
for every dollar of income before taxes that Chipotle made in 2014, the company paid nearly 
$0.38 to taxing authorities.
Earnings per Share
Corporations are required to disclose earnings per share on the income statement or in the 
notes to the financial statements. This ratio is widely used in evaluating the operating per-
formance and profitability of a company. At this introductory level, we can compute earn-
ings per share simply as net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of 
stock outstanding (Net Income ÷ Weighted Average Number of Shares of Stock Outstand-
ing). Please note, however, that the calculation of the ratio is actually much more complex 
and beyond the scope of this course. For simplicity, we use the $445,300,000 net income in 
Exhibit 3.1 as the numerator and 31,038,000 weighted average number of shares computed 
by Chipotle as the denominator. For 2014, Chipotle reported $14.35 in earnings for each 
share of stock owned by investors.

RE C OG NIZ ED  A ND  MEASUR E D?
You probably determine your personal financial position by the cash balance in your bank 
account. Your financial performance is measured as the difference between your cash balance 
at the beginning of the period and the cash balance at the end of the period (that is, whether you 
end up with more or less cash). If you have a higher cash balance, cash receipts exceeded cash 
disbursements for the period. Many local retailers, medical offices, and other small businesses 
use cash basis accounting, in which revenues are recorded when cash is received and expenses 
are recorded when cash is paid, regardless of when the revenues are earned or the expenses 
incurred. This basis produces net operating cash flow information that is often quite adequate 
for organizations that do not need to report to external users. The following table illustrates the 
application of cash basis accounting for the first three years of a new business, Cade Company:

In this illustration, $60,000 in sales was earned each year by Cade Company. However, 
because the sales were on account, customers spread out their payments over three years. Salaries 
to employees were paid in full each year. Insurance was prepaid at the beginning of the first year 
for equal coverage over the three years. Supplies were purchased on credit and used evenly over 
the three years. However, the company paid part of the first-year purchases in the second year.
Using cash basis accounting may lead to an incorrect interpretation of future company per-
formance. Simply looking at the first year, investors and creditors might interpret the negative 
cash flows as a problem with the company’s ability to generate cash flows in the future. How-
ever, the other two years show positive cash flows. Likewise, performance over time appears 
uneven, when in actuality it is not. Sales were earned evenly each year, although collections

ing food, home, and personal care products such as Hellman’s mayonnaise, Dove soap, and Popsicle treats)

from customers were not. The years in which insurance and supplies were paid for are not the 
same as the years in which these resources were used.
Accrual Accounting
Financial statements created under cash basis accounting normally postpone or accelerate rec-
ognition of revenues and expenses long before or after goods and services are produced and 
delivered (when cash is received or paid). They also do not necessarily reflect all assets or 
liabilities of a company on a particular date. For these reasons, cash basis financial statements 
are not very useful to external decision makers. Therefore, generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples require accrual basis accounting for financial reporting.
In accrual basis accounting, revenues and expenses are recognized when the transaction 
that causes them occurs, not necessarily when cash is received or paid. That is, revenues are 
recognized when they are earned and expenses when they are incurred to generate revenues.
Using the same information for Cade Company, we can apply the accrual basis of accounting.

Regardless of when cash is received, Cade Company reported revenues when earned. Like-
wise, the company used insurance coverage and supplies evenly over the three years, despite 
prepaying the entire amount of insurance at the beginning of the first year and paying part of 
the first year’s purchases in the second year. The $21,000 net income in the first year is a better 
predictor of future cash flows and performance than net operating cash flows reported under 
cash basis accounting. The two basic accounting principles that determine when revenues and 
expenses are recorded under accrual basis accounting are the revenue recognition principle 
and the expense recognition principle (also called the matching principle).
Revenue Recognition Principle
The core revenue recognition principle specifies both the timing and amount of revenue to be 
recognized during an accounting period. It requires that a company recognize revenue:
 
1. When the company transfers promised goods or services to customers
 
2. In the amount it expects to receive.
When Chipotle delivers food to customers, it recognizes revenue regardless of when cash is 
received. Exhibit 3.2 illustrates that revenue is earned when the business delivers goods or services,

although cash can be received from customers (1) in a period before delivery, (2) in the same 
period as delivery, or (3) in a period after delivery. Let’s see how to handle each of these cases.
 1 
 
Cash is received before the goods or services are delivered. 
Chipotle sells gift cards to customers for cash in exchange for 
the promise to provide future food orders. Since Chipotle has 
not at that point delivered food, it records no revenue. Instead, 
it creates a liability account (Unearned Revenue) represent-
ing the amount of food service owed to the customers. Later, 
when customers redeem their gift cards and Chipotle delivers 
the food, it earns and records the revenue while reducing the 
liability account since it has satisfied its promise to deliver.
 2 
 
Cash is received in the same period as the goods or services 
are delivered. As is a typical timing of cash receipts and rev-
enue recognition in the restaurant industry, Chipotle receives 
cash from most customers within a few minutes of them receiv-
ing their food. Chipotle delivers the food to the customer as 
ordered in exchange for cash, earning revenue in the process.
 3 
 
Cash is received after the goods or services are delivered. 
When a business sells goods or services on account, the revenue 
is earned when the goods or services are delivered, not when 
cash is received at a later date. Let’s assume that, to boost busi-
ness, Chipotle agrees to deliver food ordered by select custom-
ers, such as departments at area colleges or local businesses. 
These customers pay for the food order when Chipotle bills 
them at the end of the month, rather than when they receive the 
food. When delivered, Chipotle records both Restaurant Sales 
Revenue and the asset Accounts Receivable, representing the 
customer’s promise to pay in the future for past food deliveries. When the customer pays its 
monthly bill, Chipotle will increase its Cash account and decrease Accounts Receivable.
Companies usually disclose their revenue recognition practices in the financial statement 
note titled Significant Accounting Policies. The following excerpt from Note 1 to recent finan-
cial statements describes how Chipotle recognizes its revenue:

Revenue Recognition
Revenue from restaurant sales is recognized when food and beverage products are sold . . . The Com-
pany sells gift cards which do not have an expiration date . . . The Company recognizes revenues from 
gift cards when: (i) the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the Company determines the like-
lihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) . . . The determi-
nation of the gift card breakage rate is based upon Company-specific historical redemption patterns.

Revenue Recognition for More Complex Customer Contracts
The FASB and IASB issued a new revenue recognition accounting standard effective for 2018 financial 
statements. As indicated earlier, the standard requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers 
goods and services to customers in the amount it expects to receive. The standard also specifies how to 
handle more complex contracts with customers. The standard specifies five steps to recognizing revenue:
 1. Identify the contract between the company and customer.
 2. Identify the performance obligations (promised goods and services).
 3. Determine the transaction price.
F I N A N C I A L
A N A LYS I S

C HAP TER  3   Operating Decisions and the Accounting System
 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations.
 5.  
Recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied (or over time if a service is pro-
vided over time).
For example, when Dell sells computers and a one-year warranty together in a single sale, it will deter-
mine the separate obligations (selling a computer and selling a warranty service) and split the sales price 
among them. Dell will then recognize the revenue allocated to the computer when it is delivered, and it 
will recognize one-twelfth of the revenue from the warranty each month it is in force. Accounting for 
complex sales transactions is covered in more detail in intermediate accounting courses.

Expense Recognition Principle
The expense recognition principle (also called the matching principle) requires that costs 
incurred to generate revenues be recognized in the same period—a matching of costs with ben-
efits. For example, when Chipotle’s restaurants provide food service to customers, revenue is 
earned. The costs of generating the revenue include expenses incurred such as these:

 Salaries and wages to employees who worked during the period

 Utilities for the electricity used during the period

 Food, beverage, and packaging supplies used during the period

 Facilities rental during the period

 Grills and other equipment used during the period
As with revenues and cash receipts, expenses are recorded as incurred, regardless of when 
cash is paid. Cash may be paid (1) before, (2) during, or (3) after an expense is incurred (see 
Exhibit 3.3). An entry will be made on the date the expense is incurred and another on the date 
the cash is paid, if they occur at different times. Let’s see how to handle each of these cases 
related to the expense recognition principle.
 1 
 
Ca 
sh is paid before the expense is incurred to generate 
revenue. Companies purchase many assets that are used to 
generate revenues in future periods. Examples include buy-
ing insurance for future coverage, paying rent for future use 
of space, and acquiring supplies and equipment for future 
use. When revenues are generated in the future, the com-
pany records an expense for the portion of the cost of the 
assets used—costs are matched with the benefits. As an 
example, Chipotle buys paper supplies (napkins, bags, 
cups, etc.) in one month but uses them the following month. 
When acquired, the supplies are recorded as an asset called 
 
Supplies because they will benefit future periods. When they are used the following 
month, Supplies Expense is recorded for the month and the asset Supplies is reduced 
to the balance yet to be used. Similarly, rent, insurance, and advertising that are pre-
paid are often recorded in an asset account called Prepaid Expenses and expensed 
when used.
 2 
 
Cash is paid in the same period as the expense is incurred to 
generate revenue. Expenses are sometimes incurred and paid 
for in the period in which they arise. An example is paying for 
repairs on grills the day of the service. If Chipotle spends $275 
cash to repair grills so that food can be prepared to sell, an 
expense is incurred and recorded (Repairs Expense).

Cash is paid after the cost is incurred to generate revenue. 
Although rent and supplies are typically purchased before they 
are used, many costs are paid after goods or services have been 
received and used. Examples include using electric and gas utili-
ties in the current period that are not paid for until the following 
period, using borrowed funds and incurring Interest Expense to 
be paid in the future, and owing wages to employees who worked 
in the current period. When Chipotle’s restaurants use employ-
ees to make and serve food in the current accounting period (and 
thus assist in generating revenues), the company records Wages 
Expense for the amount incurred. Any amount that is then owed 
to employees at the end of the current period is recorded as a 
liability called Wages Payable (an accrued expense obligation).

The expense recognition principle (or matching principle) requires that costs incurred to generate 
revenues be recognized in the same period—that costs are matched with the revenues they generate.

T HE EX PA ND ED  T R AN SACT I ON  AN ALYSI S MODE L
We have discussed the variety of business activities affecting the income statement and how 
they are measured. Now we need to determine how these business activities are recorded in the 
accounting system and reflected in the financial statements. Chapter 2 covered investing and 
financing activities that affect assets, liabilities, and contributed capital. We now expand the 
transaction analysis model to include operating activities.
Transaction Analysis Rules
The complete transaction analysis model presented in Exhibit 3.4 includes all five elements: 
assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenues, and expenses. Recall that the Retained Earn-
ings account is the accumulation of all past revenues and expenses minus any income distrib-
uted to stockholders as dividends (that is, earnings not retained in the business).3 When net 
income is positive, Retained Earnings increases; a net loss decreases Retained Earnings.
Management’s Incentives to Violate Accounting Rules
A  Q U E ST I O N  
O F  E T H I C S
Investors in the stock market base their decisions on their expectations of a company’s future earnings. When 
companies announce quarterly and annual earnings information, investors evaluate how well the companies 
have met expectations and adjust their investing decisions accordingly. Companies that fail to meet expecta-
tions often experience a decline in stock price. Thus, managers are motivated to produce earnings results that 
meet or exceed investors’ expectations to bolster stock prices. Greed may lead some managers to make unethi-
cal accounting and reporting decisions, often involving falsifying revenues and expenses. While this some-
times fools people for a short time, it rarely works in the long run and often leads to very bad consequences.
Fraud is a criminal offense for which managers may be sentenced to jail. Samples of fraud cases, a few 
involving faulty revenue and expense accounting, are shown below. Just imagine what it must have been 
like to be 65-year-old Bernie Ebbers or 21-year-old Barry Minkow, both sentenced to 25 years in prison 
for accounting fraud.

Many others are affected by accounting fraud. Shareholders lose stock value, employees may lose 
their jobs (and pension funds, as in the case of Enron), and customers and suppliers may become wary 
of dealing with a company operating under the cloud of fraud. As a manager, you may face an ethical 
dilemma in the workplace. The ethical decision is the one you will be proud of 20 years later.
3Instead of reducing Retained Earnings directly when dividends are declared, companies may use the account 
Dividends Declared, which has a debit balance.

Some students attempt to memorize journal entries in the introductory accounting course. 
However, they are often overwhelmed by the number and complexity of transactions as the course 
progresses. To avoid this pitfall, you should instead be able to construct the transaction analysis 
model in Exhibit 3.4 on your own without assistance and use it to analyze transactions. It will be 
very beneficial in completing assignments and analyzing more complex transactions in future 
chapters. Now let’s study Exhibit 3.4 carefully to remember how the model is constructed and 
to understand the impact of operating activities on both the balance sheet and income statement:

 All accounts can increase or decrease, although revenues and expenses tend to increase 
throughout a period. For accounts on the left side of the accounting equation, the increase 
symbol + is written on the left side of the T-account. For accounts on the right side of the 
accounting equation, the increase symbol + is written on the right side of the T-account, 
except for expenses, which increase on the left side of the T-account.

 Debits (dr) are written on the left of each T-account and credits (cr) are written on the right.

 Every transaction affects at least two accounts.

 Revenues increase stockholders’ equity through the 
account Retained Earnings and therefore have credit 
balances. Recording revenue results in either increas-
ing an asset (such as Cash or Accounts Receivable) 
or decreasing a liability (such as Unearned Subscriptions Revenue).

 Expenses decrease net income, thus decreasing 
Retained Earnings and stockholders’ equity. There-
fore, they have debit balances (opposite of the bal-
ance in Retained Earnings). That is, to increase an 
expense, you debit it, thereby decreasing net income and Retained Earnings. Recording an 
expense results in either decreasing an asset (such as Supplies when used) or increasing a 
liability (such as Wages Payable when money is owed to employees).

 When revenues exceed expenses, the company reports net income, increasing Retained 
Earnings and stockholders’ equity. However, when expenses exceed revenues, a net loss 
results that decreases Retained Earnings and thus stockholders’ equity.

Analyzing Chipotle’s Transactions
Now we continue operating activities for Chipotle Mexican Grill, building on the company’s 
trial balance presented in Exhibit 3.6 (and at the end of Chapter 2). It included only investing 
and financing transactions occurring during the first quarter of 2015.
Step 1:  
Ask →  
Was a revenue earned by delivering goods or services? 
If so, credit the revenue account and debit the appropriate accounts for what was received.
or Ask →  
Was an expense incurred to generate a revenue in the current period? 
If so, debit the expense account and credit the appropriate accounts for what was given.
or Ask → If no revenue was earned or expense incurred, what was received and given?
 
∙  
Identify the accounts affected by title (e.g., Cash and Notes Payable). 
 Remember: Make sure that at least two accounts change.
 
∙  
Classify them by type of account: asset (A), liability (L), stockholders’ equity (SE),  
 revenue/gain (R), or expense/loss (E).
 
∙ Determine the direction of the effect. Did the account increase (+) or decrease (-)?
Step 2: Verify → Is the accounting equation in balance? (A = L + SE)

The steps to follow in analyzing transactions presented in Chapter 2 are now modified to 
determine the effects of earning revenues and incurring expenses. Now, as shown in Exhibit 3.5, 
when a transaction occurs, the questions to ask are:

C HAP TER  3   Operating Decisions and the Accounting System
Using the transaction analysis steps in Exhibit 3.5, we now analyze, record, and post to the 
T-accounts the effects of this chapter’s operating activities that also occurred during the first 
quarter. The T-accounts begin with the trial balance amounts in Exhibit 3.6. All amounts 
are in thousands of dollars, except per share information. You should notice, in each journal 
entry, that

 When a revenue or expense is recorded, we insert (+R, +SE) for revenues and (+E, −SE) 
for expenses to emphasize the effect of the transaction on the accounting equation and to 
help you see that the equation remains in balance.

 Debits equal credits—another check you should make when preparing journal entries.
In Chapter 4, we complete the accounting cycle with the activities at the end of the quarter (on 
March 31).

We just illustrated the steps in analyzing and recording transactions, including those involving earning 
revenue and incurring expenses.
Transaction Analysis Steps:
Step 1: Ask →  
Was a revenue earned by delivering goods or services? 
If so, credit the revenue account and debit the appropriate accounts for what was received.
or Ask →  
Was an expense incurred to generate a revenue in the current period? 
If so, debit the expense account and credit the appropriate accounts for what was given.
or Ask → If no revenue was earned or expense incurred, what was received and given?
 ∙ 
Identify the accounts affected by title (e.g., Cash and Notes Payable).
  
Remember: Make sure that at least two accounts change.
 ∙ 
 
Classify them by type of account: asset (A), liability (L), stockholders’ equity (SE),  
revenue/gain (R), or expense/loss (E).
 ∙ 
Determine the direction of the effect. Did the account increase (+) or decrease (-)?
Step 2: Verify → Is the accounting equation in balance? (A = L + SE)
S E L F - S T U D Y  Q U I Z
Now it’s your turn. Analyze and record the journal entries for each of the selected June transactions for 
Florida Flippers, Inc., a scuba diving and instruction business. Then post the effects to the T-accounts. 
Account titles and beginning balances are provided in the T-accounts that follow. Be sure to check that 
debits equal credits in each journal entry and that the accounting equation remains in balance.
 
a. In June, new customers paid Florida Flippers $8,200 in cash for diving trips; $5,200 was for 
trips made in June, and the rest is for trips that will be provided in July.
 
b. In June, customers paid $3,900 in cash for instruction they received in May.
 
c. At the beginning of June, Florida Flippers paid a total of $6,000 cash for insurance to cover 
the months of June, July, and August.

As we discussed in Chapter 2, companies can prepare financial statements at any point in time. 
Before we consider creating any statements for Chipotle, however, we must first determine that 
the debits equal credits after all of the transactions illustrated above by generating a trial bal-
ance. Accounts are listed in financial statement order: assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, 
revenues/gains, and expenses/losses.

Although debits do equal credits, why is the trial balance labeled “unadjusted”? Does it 
make sense that supplies were purchased during the quarter, but no Supplies Expense was 
recorded to show the amount of supplies used? How likely is it that gift cards were sold, but 
none were redeemed by customers during the quarter? And didn’t Chipotle use property and 
equipment during the quarter to generate revenues? The answer to all of these questions is 
that no end-of-period adjustments have been made yet to reflect all revenues earned and 
expenses incurred during the quarter. Therefore, the trial balance is unadjusted until adjust-
ments are made, as we discuss in Chapter 4.
C L A S S IF IE D I N C OME  STAT E ME N T
The following classified income statement (that is, it is categorized into operating activities 
and peripheral activities) is presented to highlight the structure but note that, because it is 
based on unadjusted balances, it would not be presented to external users.

When comparing this statement with Chipotle’s 2014 income statement in Exhibit 3.1, we 
notice that the income from operations for the first quarter ($755,600) exceeds all income from 
operations for 2014 ($710,800). Since a more representative amount for one quarter would be 
about 25 percent, obviously, numerous adjustments are necessary to revenues and expenses, 
such as the use of food, packaging, and beverage supplies to generate revenue during the quar-
ter and renting facilities for the quarter. We would not want to use the information for analysis 
until it has been adjusted. Instead, we use the 2014 income statement in Exhibit 3.1 to deter-
mine how effective Chipotle’s management is at generating profit.

INTERPRETATIONS
In General Net profit margin measures how much of every sales dollar generated during the period is 
profit. A rising net profit margin signals more efficient management of sales and expenses. Differences 
among industries result from the nature of the products or services provided and the intensity of competi-
tion. Differences among competitors in the same industry reflect how each company responds to changes in 
competition (and demand for the product or service) and changes in managing sales volume, sales price, and 
costs. Financial analysts expect well-run businesses to maintain or improve their net profit margin over time.
Focus Company Analysis Chipotle’s net profit margin increased over the three-year period of 2012 
to 2014. As indicated by management in the annual report, revenue increases were due primarily to an 
increase in customer visits and a menu price increase, as well as opening new restaurants each year. Food 
costs continued to increase as well, primarily costs related to beef, avocados, and dairy. Acquiring “Food 
with Integrity” (naturally raised, free of preservatives and growth hormones) is challenging and costlier 
than using traditional food products and sources. On the other hand, labor and occupancy costs (including 
utilities, repairs, and rent) grew at a lower rate than sales due to higher average sales per restaurant. Chipot-
le’s management did a better job of generating revenues and controlling labor and occupancy costs in 2014.
Panera Bread and Fiesta Restaurant Group each had a lower net profit margin than Chipotle. Chi-
potle’s is nearly 53 percent higher than Panera Bread’s. This suggests that Chipotle has greater effective-
ness in generating sales, mostly by a high growth in establishing nearly 200 new restaurants and higher 
menu prices, while controlling costs. Panera Bread, on the other hand, experienced labor and occupancy 
costs in 2014 that grew at a higher rate than operating revenues, despite opening new restaurants and 
selling additional franchises. Fiesta Restaurant Group is much smaller in size, which suggests lower 
economies of scale. In 2014, the Group experienced, as a percentage of operating revenues, lower food 
and labor costs that were offset by higher repairs and insurance costs. Differences in business strategies 
and size explain some of the wide variation in the ratio analysis.
A Few Cautions The decisions that management makes to maintain the company’s net profit margin 
in the current period may have negative long-run implications. Analysts should perform additional analy-
sis of the ratio to identify trends in each component of revenues and expenses. This involves dividing 
each line on the income statement by net sales. Statements presented with these percentages are called 
common-sized income statements. Changes in the percentages of the individual components of net 
income provide information on shifts in management’s strategies.

In this chapter, we focus on cash flows from operating activities: cash from operating sources, primar-
ily customers, and cash to suppliers and others involved in operations. The accounts most often associ-
ated with operating activities are current assets, such as Accounts Receivable, Inventories, and Prepaid 
Expenses, and current liabilities, such as Accounts Payable, Wages Payable, and Unearned Revenue.

As discussed in Chapter 2, companies report cash inflows and outflows over a period of time in their 
statement of cash flows. This statement is divided into three categories:

 O —  
Operating activities include those primarily with customers and suppliers, and interest 
payments and earnings on investments.

 I — Investing activities include buying and selling noncurrent assets and investments.

 F —  
Financing activities include borrowing and repaying debt, including short-term bank 
loans; issuing and repurchasing stock; and paying dividends.
Only transactions affecting cash are reported on the statement. An important step in constructing and 
analyzing the statement of cash flows is identifying the various transactions as operating, investing, or 
financing. Let’s analyze the Cash T-account for Chipotle’s transactions in this chapter, adding to trans-
actions (a)—(f) from Chapter 2. Refer to transactions (1)—(11) illustrated earlier in the chapter, and 
remember, if you see Cash in a transaction, it will be reflected on the statement of cash flows.

As we discussed, every transaction affecting cash can be classified either as an operating, investing, 
or financing effect.
Operating effects relate to receipts of cash from customers, payments to suppliers (employees, 
utilities, and other suppliers of goods and services for operating the business), and any inter-
est paid or investment income received.
Investing effects relate to purchasing/selling investments or property and equipment or lending 
funds to/receiving repayment from others.
Financing effects relate to borrowing or repaying banks, issuing stock to investors, repurchas-
ing stock from investors, or paying dividends to investors.

3-1. Describe a typical business operating cycle and explain the necessity for the time period 
assumption.  p. 104 

 The operating cycle, or cash-to-cash cycle, is the time needed to purchase goods or services from 
suppliers, sell the goods or services to customers, and collect cash from customers.

 Time period assumption—to measure and report financial information periodically, we assume 
the long life of a company can be cut into shorter periods.
 
3-2. Explain how business activities affect the elements of the income statement.  p. 106 

 Elements of the income statement:
 
a. Revenues—increases in assets or settlements of liabilities from major or central ongoing 
operations.
 
b. Expenses—decreases in assets or increases in liabilities from major or central ongoing 
operations.
 
c. Gains—increases in assets or settlements of liabilities from peripheral activities.
 
d. Losses—decreases in assets or increases in liabilities from peripheral activities.
 
3-3. Explain the accrual basis of accounting and apply the revenue and expense recognition 
 
principles to measure income.  p. 110 
In accrual basis accounting, revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized 
when incurred.

 Revenue recognition principle—recognize revenues (1) when the company transfers promised 
goods or services to customers (2) in the amount it expects to receive.

 Expense recognition principle (matching)—recognize expenses when they are incurred in gener-
ating revenue (a matching of costs with benefits).

3-4. Apply transaction analysis to examine and record the effects of operating activities on the 
financial statements.  p. 115 
The expanded transaction analysis model includes revenues and expenses:
 
3-5. Prepare a classified income statement.  p. 125 
Until the accounts have been updated to include all revenues earned and expenses incurred in the 
period (due to a difference in the time when cash is received or paid), the financial statements are 
unadjusted:

 Classified income statement—net income is needed to determine ending Retained Earnings; 
classifications include Operating Revenues, Operating Expenses (to determine Operating 
Income), Other Items (to determine Pretax Income), Income Tax Expense, Net Income (or Net 
Loss), and Earnings per Share.
 
3-6. Compute and interpret the net profit margin ratio.  p. 127 
The net profit margin ratio (Net Income [or Net Loss] ÷ Net Sales [or Operating Revenues]) mea-
sures the profit generated per dollar of sales (operating revenues). The higher the ratio, the more 
effective the company is at generating revenues and/or controlling costs.
In this chapter, we discussed the operating cycle and accounting concepts relevant to income deter-
mination: the time period assumption, definitions of the income statement elements (revenues, expenses, 
gains, and losses), the revenue recognition principle, and the expense recognition principle. The account-
ing principles are defined in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting, which requires revenues 
to be recorded when earned and expenses to be recorded when incurred in the process of generating 
revenues. We expanded the transaction analysis model introduced in Chapter 2 by adding revenues and 
expenses and prepared an unadjusted classified income statement. In Chapter 4, we discuss the activities 
that occur at the end of the accounting period: the adjustment process, the preparation of adjusted finan-
cial statements, and the closing process.

Net profit margin ratio measures the profit generated per dollar of sales (operating revenues). A 
high ratio suggests that a company is generating revenues and/or controlling expenses effectively. The 
ratio is computed as follows (see the “Key Ratio Analysis” box in the Classified Income Statement 
section):
Net Profit Margin Ratio =

Finding Financial Information
Refer to the financial statements of American Eagle Outfitters in Appendix B at the end of the book.
Required:
 1. State the amount of the largest expense on the income statement for the year ended January 31, 
2015, and describe the transaction represented by the expense.
 2. Assuming that all net sales are on credit, how much cash did American Eagle Outfitters collect from 
customers?* (Hint: Use a T-account of accounts receivable to infer collection.)
 3. A shareholder has complained that “more dividends should be paid because the company had net 
earnings of $80,322,000. Since this amount is all cash, more of it should go to the owners.” Explain 
why the shareholder’s assumption that earnings equal net cash inflow is valid. If you believe that the 
assumption is not valid, state so and support your position concisely.
 4. Describe and contrast the purpose of an income statement versus a balance sheet.
 5. Compute the company’s net profit margin for each year presented. Explain its meaning.
Finding Financial Information
Refer to the financial statements of Urban Outfitters in Appendix C at the end of the book.
Required:
 1. What is the company’s revenue recognition policy? (Hint: Look in the notes to the financial 
statements.)
 2. Assuming that $50 million of cost of sales was due to noninventory purchase expenses (distribu-
tion and occupancy costs), how much inventory did the company buy during the year? (Hint: Use a 
T-account of inventory to infer how much was purchased.)
 3. Calculate selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of sales for each year presented. 
By what percent did these expenses increase or decrease from fiscal years ended 2014 and 2015 and 
between 2013 and 2014? (Hint: Percentage Change = [Current Year Amount − Prior Year Amount] ÷ 
 
Prior Year Amount.)

*Note that most retailers settle sales in cash at the register and would not have accounts receivable related to 
sales unless they had layaway or private credit. For American Eagle, the accounts receivable on the balance sheet 
primarily relates to amounts owed from landlords for their construction allowances for building new American 
Eagle stores in malls.

Comparing Companies within an Industry
Refer to the financial statements of American Eagle Outfitters in Appendix B, Urban Outfitters in 
Appendix C, and the Industry Ratio Report in Appendix D at the end of this book.
Required:
 1. By what title does each company call its income statement? Explain what “Consolidated” means.
 2. Which company had higher net income for the fiscal year?
 3. Compute the net profit margin ratio for both companies for the year. Which company is managing 
revenues and expenses more effectively?
 4. Compare the net profit margin ratio for both companies for the most recent year presented to the 
industry average. On average, are these two companies managing sales and expenses better or worse 
than their competitors?
 5. How much cash was provided by operating activities for each year by each company? What was the 
percentage change in operating cash flows (1) from fiscal year ended 2013 to 2014 and (2) from 
fiscal year ended 2014 to 2015? (Hint: Percentage Change = [Current Year Amount − Prior Year 
Amount] ÷ Prior Year Amount.)
Financial Reporting and Analysis Cases
Analyzing a Company over Time
Refer to the annual report for American Eagle Outfitters in Appendix B.
Required:
 1. The annual report or 10-K report for American Eagle Outfitters provides selected financial data for 
the last five years. Compute the net profit margin ratio for each of the years presented. Use income 
from continuing operations in place of net income. (Hint: See Item 6 from the 10-K, which is 
disclosed within the annual report for the data.) Note: Some companies will label a year that has 
a January year-end as having a fiscal year-end dated one year earlier. For example, a January 2015 
year-end may be labeled as Fiscal 2014 since the year actually has more months that fall in the 2014 
calendar year than in the 2015 calendar year.
 2. In Chapter 2, we discussed the current ratio. This ratio is computed in Item 6. Observe the trends 
over time for both the net profit margin and the current ratio. What do they suggest about American 
Eagle Outfitters?
Interpreting the Financial Press
The October 4, 2004, edition of BusinessWeek presented an article titled “Fuzzy Numbers” on issues 
related to accrual accounting and its weaknesses that have led some corporate executives to manipulate 
estimates in their favor, sometimes fraudulently. You can access the article at www.bloomberg.com/bw/
stories/2004-10-03/fuzzy-numbers.
Required:
Read the article and then answer the following questions:
 1. What is accrual accounting?
 2. What does the article’s title “Fuzzy Numbers” mean?
 3. What does the article suggest about the reforms adopted by Congress and the SEC?

Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma
Mike Lynch is the manager of an upstate New York regional office for an insurance company. As the 
regional manager, his compensation package comprises a base salary, commissions, and a bonus when 
the region sells new policies in excess of its quota. Mike has been under enormous pressure lately, stem-
ming largely from two factors. First, he is experiencing a mounting personal debt due to a family mem-
ber’s illness. Second, compounding his worries, the region’s sales of new policies have dipped below the 
normal quota for the first time in years.
You have been working for Mike for two years, and like everyone else in the office, you consider 
yourself lucky to work for such a supportive boss. You also feel great sympathy for his personal problems 
over the last few months. In your position as accountant for the regional office, you are only too aware of

the drop in new policy sales and the impact this will have on the manager’s bonus. While you are working 
late at year-end, Mike stops by your office.
Mike asks you to change the manner in which you have accounted for a new property insurance policy 
for a large local business. A substantial check for the premium came in the mail on December 31, the last 
day of the reporting year. The premium covers a period beginning on January 5. You deposited the check 
and correctly debited Cash and credited an unearned revenue account. Mike says, “Hey, we have the 
money this year, so why not count the revenue this year? I never did understand why you accountants are 
so picky about these things anyway. I’d like you to change the way you have recorded the transaction. I 
want you to credit a revenue account. And anyway, I’ve done favors for you in the past, and I am asking 
for such a small thing in return.” With that, he leaves for the day.
Required:
 1. How should you handle this situation?
 2. What are the ethical implications of Mike’s request?
 3. Who are the parties who would be helped or harmed if you complied with the request?
 4. If you fail to comply with his request, how will you explain your position to him in the morning?

Team Project: Analysis of Income Statements and Ratios
As a team, select an industry to analyze. Yahoo Finance provides lists of industries at biz.yahoo.com/p/
industries.html. Click on an industry for a list of companies in that industry. Alternatively, go to Google 
Finance at www.google.com/finance, search for a company you are interested in, and you will be pre-
sented with a list including that company and its competitors. Each team member should acquire the 
annual report or 10-K for one publicly traded company in the industry, with each member selecting a dif-
ferent company (the SEC EDGAR service at www.sec.gov and the company’s investor relations website 
itself are good sources).
Required:
On an individual basis, each team member should write a short report answering the following questions 
about the selected company. Discuss any patterns across the companies that you as a team observe. Then, 
as a team, write a short report comparing and contrasting your companies.
 1. For the most recent year, what is (are) the major revenue account(s)? What percentage is each to 
total operating revenues? (Calculated as Revenue A ÷ Total revenues.)
 2. For the most recent year, what is (are) the major expense account(s)? What percentage is each to 
total operating expenses? (Calculated as Expense A ÷ Total expenses.)
 3. Ratio Analysis:
 
a. What does the net profit margin ratio measure in general?
 
b. Compute the ratio for the last three years.
 
c. What do your results suggest about the company?
 
d. If available, find the industry ratio for the most recent year, compare it to your results, and discuss 
why you believe your company differs or is similar to the industry ratio.
 4. Describe the company’s revenue recognition policy, if reported (usually in the Significant Account-
ing Policies note to the financial statements).
 5. The ratio of Cash from Operating Activities divided by Net Income measures how liberal (that is, 
speeding up revenue recognition or delaying expense recognition) or conservative (that is, taking 
care not to record revenues too early or expenses too late) management is in choosing among various 
revenue and expense recognition policies. A ratio above 1.0 suggests more conservative policies; 
a ratio below 1.0 suggests more liberal policies. Compute the ratio for each of the last three years. 
What do your results suggest about the company’s choice of accounting policies?

Although the last day of the fiscal year for Chipotle falls on the last day of December

so as not to mislead users. However, since end-of-period adjustments are the most complex 
portion of the annual recordkeeping process, they are prone to error. External auditors exam-
ine the company’s records on a test, or sample, basis. To maximize the chance of detecting 
any errors significant enough to affect users’ decisions, CPAs allocate more of their testing 
to transactions most likely to be in error.
Several accounting research studies have documented the most error-prone transactions 
for medium-size manufacturing companies. End-of-period adjustment errors, such as fail-

the past and predicting the future when it is considered by users to be of high 
quality. High-quality information is information that is relevant (that is, material 
and able to influence users’ decisions) and a faithful representation of what is 
being reported (that is, complete, free from error, and unbiased in portraying eco-
nomic reality).
Users expect revenues and expenses to be reported in the proper period 
based on the revenue recognition and expense recognition principles discussed 
in Chapter 3. Revenues are to be recorded when earned, and expenses are to be 
recorded when incurred, regardless of when cash receipts or payments occur.

correct period. These entries update the records and are the focus of this chapter.
In this chapter, we emphasize the use of the same analytical tools illustrated in 
 
Chapters 2 and 3 (T-accounts and journal entries) to understand how common adjustments 
are analyzed and recorded at the end of the accounting period. These tools provide the foun-
dation for understanding adjustments that require additional estimation and judgments by 
management, which we discuss in future chapters. Then, in this chapter, we prepare financial 
statements using adjusted accounts, and finally, we illustrate how to prepare the accounting 
records for the next period by performing a process called closing the books.

Accounting Cycle
Exhibit 4.1 presents the basic steps in the accounting cycle. As initially discussed in 
Chapter 2, the accounting cycle is the process followed by entities to analyze and record 
transactions, adjust the records at the end of the period, prepare financial statements, and pre-
pare the records for the next cycle. During the accounting period, transactions that result in 
exchanges between the company and other external parties are analyzed and recorded in the 
general journal in chronological order (journal entries), and the related accounts are updated 
in the general ledger (T-accounts), similar to our Chipotle illustrations in Chapters 2 and 3. 
In this chapter, we examine the end-of-period steps that focus primarily on adjustments to 
record revenues and expenses in the proper period and to update the balance sheet accounts 
for reporting purposes.
Purpose of Adjustments
Accounting systems are designed to record most recurring daily transactions, particularly those 
involving cash. As cash is received or paid, it is recorded in the accounting system. In gen-
eral, this focus on cash works well, especially when cash receipts and payments occur in the 
same period as the activities that produce revenues and expenses. However, cash is not always 
received in the period in which the company earns revenue; likewise, cash is not always paid in 
the period in which the company incurs an expense.
How does the accounting system record revenues and expenses when one transaction is 
needed to record a cash receipt or payment and another transaction is needed to record revenue 
when it is earned or an expense when it is incurred? The solution to the problem created by such 
differences in timing is to record adjusting entries at the end of every accounting period, so that

 Revenues are recorded when they are earned (the revenue recognition principle),

 Expenses are recorded when they are incurred to generate revenue (the expense recognition 
principle),

 Assets are reported at amounts that represent the probable future benefits remaining at the 
end of the period, and

 Liabilities are reported at amounts that represent the probable future sacrifices of assets or 
services owed at the end of the period.
Companies wait until the end of the accounting period to adjust their accounts in this 
way because adjusting the records daily would be very costly and time-consuming. Adjust-
ing entries are required every time a company wants to prepare financial statements for 
external users.
Types of Adjustments
Exhibit 4.2 describes the four types of adjustments (two in which cash was already received or 
paid and two in which cash will be received or paid). Because of the timing of the cash receipts 
or payments, each of these types of adjustments involves two entries:

 One for the cash receipt or payment either before or after the end of the period.

 One for the adjustment to record the revenue or expense in the proper period (the adjusting entry).
In practice, almost every account, except Cash, could require an adjustment. Rather than 
trying to memorize an endless list of specific examples, you should focus instead on learning 
the general types of adjustments that are needed and the process that is used to determine how 
to adjust the accounts. We will illustrate the process involved in analyzing and adjusting the 
accounts by reviewing all the adjustments needed for Chipotle Mexican Grill before preparing 
the financial statements for the first quarter of 2015 based on adjusted balances.

Adjustment Process
In analyzing adjustments at the end of the period, there are three steps:
EXHIBIT 4.2
Four Types of  
Adjustments
Adjusting Entries that Increase Revenues:
Deferred Revenues  – Previously recorded liabilities that
were created when cash was
received in advance and that must
be reduced for the amount of
revenue actually earned during
the period.
Revenues that have been earned but
not yet recorded because cash will
be received after the services are
performed or goods are delivered.
Accrued Revenues   –
Adjusting Entries that Increase Expenses: 
Previously recorded assets, such as
Prepaid Rent, Supplies, and 
Equipment, that were created when
cash was paid in advance and that
must be reduced for the amount of
expense actually incurred during the
period through use of the asset.
Deferred Expenses  –
Expenses that have been incurred but
not yet recorded because cash
will be paid after the goods or
services are used.

$ )"1 5&3     Adjustments, Financial Statements, and the Quality of Earnings
From a review of the unadjusted trial balance, we identify several accounts that may need 
an adjustment:

 One deferred revenue account:
 
  
 
Unearned Revenue representing the amount received from customers on gift cards. A 
 
 portion may have been earned during the quarter.

 One accrued revenue:
 
  
 
Additional interest on investments may have been earned but not yet received by the 
 
 end of the quarter.

 Four deferred expense accounts:
 
  
Supplies of food, beverage, and packaging were used during the period.
 
  
 
Prepaid Expenses relating to rent, insurance, and advertising paid in the past were 
 
 partially used during the period.
 
  
Buildings were used during the period to generate revenue.
 
  
 
Equipment was also used during the period to generate revenue. Because buildings 
 
 and equipment were used during the quarter, we must make an adjustment to reflect 
 
 that in the Accumulated Depreciation account representing the cost of the buildings 
 
 and equipment that has been allocated (used) in the past.

 Four accrued expenses:
 
  
 
Wages, utilities, interest on notes payable, and income taxes may need to be adjusted 
 
 for amounts incurred during the quarter but not yet paid.
We follow the three-step adjustment process outlined in Exhibit 4.3 to illustrate how to apply 
the process. For each of the following adjustments, we shorten the term adjusting journal 
entry to AJE for ease of labeling. Also, note that the beginning balance in each T-account is 
taken from the unadjusted trial balance in Exhibit 4.4. Finally, as you learned in Chapters 2 
and 3, it is important to continue to check that debits equal credits in each entry and that 
the accounting equation remains in balance. In the following adjustments, all entries and the 
accounting equation are in balance.
Deferred Revenues
When a customer pays for goods or services before the company delivers them, the company 
records the amount of cash received in a deferred (unearned) revenue account. This unearned 
revenue is a liability representing the company’s promise to perform or deliver the goods or 
services in the future. Recognition of (recording) the revenue is postponed (deferred) until the 
company meets its obligation.
AJE 1   Unearned Revenue Chipotle received cash last period from customers purchasing 
gift cards and recorded an increase in Cash and an increase in Unearned Revenues, a 
liability, to recognize the business’s obligation to provide future services to customers. 
During the first quarter of 2015, customers redeemed a portion of the gift cards for $17,300 
in food service.
 
Was revenue earned that is not yet recorded? Yes. When customers redeemed their gift 
cards during the quarter, Chipotle provided food service. Therefore, Chipotle earned $17,300 
in Restaurant Sales Revenue that is not yet recorded by the end of the quarter. Record an 
increase in the revenue account.
 
Was the related cash received in the past or will it be received in the future? In the past. The 
 
Unearned Revenue account was created when cash was received in the past. At the end of the quar-
ter, there is a $38,700 balance in the account. However, it is too large because a portion of it has been 
earned. Therefore, reduce the unearned revenue account for the amount earned.
 
Compute the amount of revenue earned. The amount of the revenue that was earned is given 
as $17,300. Record $17,300 in the adjusting journal entry.
DEFERRED (UNEARNED) 
REVENUES 
Previously recorded liabilities 
(from collecting cash from 
customers in the past) that need 
to be adjusted at the end of the 
period to reflect the amount 
of revenue earned by providing 
goods or services over time to 
customers.

Additional examples of deferred revenues include magazine subscription sales by publishing 
companies; season tickets sold in advance to sporting events, plays, and concerts by these types 
of organizations; air flight tickets sold in advance by airlines; and rent received in advance 
by landlords. Each of these requires an adjusting entry at the end of the accounting period to 
report the amount of revenue earned during the period.
Accrued Revenues
Sometimes companies perform services or provide goods (that is, earn revenue) before custom-
ers pay. Because the cash that is owed for these goods and services has not yet been received 
and the customers have not yet been billed, the revenue that was earned may not have been 
recorded. Revenues that have been earned but have not yet been recorded at the end of the 
accounting period are called accrued revenues.
AJE 2   Interest on Investments Investments owned by Chipotle earned $200 in additional 
interest revenue for the quarter, but the cash will be received in the next quarter.
Step 1:  Was revenue earned that is not yet recorded? Yes. Investments earned an additional amount 
of interest during the quarter, but no interest revenue has yet been recorded. Therefore, revenue is 
understated in the current quarter. Record an increase in the revenue account.
Step 2:  Was the related cash received in the past or will it be received in the future? In the future. 
Chipotle will receive the cash from the interest revenue in the next quarter. Because cash will be 
received, a new account (a receivable) needs to be increased. Increase Interest Receivable.
Step 3:  Compute the amount of revenue earned. The amount of the revenue that was earned is given. 
Record $200 in the adjusting journal entry.
ACCRUED REVENUES 
Previously unrecorded revenues 
that need to be adjusted at the 
end of the accounting period to 
reflect the amount earned and its 
related receivable account.
NOTE: The beginning balance 
for each T-account is from the 
3/31/15 unadjusted trial balance

Deferred Expenses
Assets represent resources with probable future benefits to the company. Many assets are used 
over time to generate revenues, including supplies, buildings, equipment, and prepaid expenses 



$ )"1 5&3     Adjustments, Financial Statements, and the Quality of Earnings
for insurance, advertising, and rent. These assets are deferred expenses (that is, recording the 
expenses for using these assets is deferred to the future). At the end of every period, an adjust-
ment must be made to record the amount of the asset that was used during the period.
AJE 3   Supplies Supplies include food, beverage, and paper products for Chipotle. At the 
end of the quarter, Chipotle counted $16,100 in supplies on hand, but the Supplies account 
indicated a balance of $385,100 (from the unadjusted trial balance in Exhibit 4.4).
 
Was expense incurred that is not yet recorded? Yes. Supplies were used during the quarter to 
generate revenue, but no entry has been made to record the amount used. Expenses are understated. 
Record an increase in the Supplies Expense account.
 
Was the related cash paid in the past or will it be paid in the future? In the past. Chipotle 
purchased supplies during the quarter and recorded the acquisition in the Supplies account. Some 
of these supplies have been used during the quarter, but no entry has been made yet to reduce the 
account. Assets are overstated. Record a decrease in the Supplies account.
 
Compute the amount of expense incurred. The easiest way to determine the dollar amount of 
supplies used is to add the dollar amount of supplies available at the beginning of the period plus 
any purchases made during the period, and then subtract the dollar amount of supplies remaining 
on hand at the end of the period.
DEFERRED EXPENSES

remaining on hand, the amount of supplies used during the period is $369,000. Record $369,000 
in the adjusting entry.
AJE 4   Prepaid Expenses Among a few other times, the Prepaid Expenses account includes:

 $88,000 paid at the beginning of the quarter for rental of facilities at $22,000 per month,

 $48,000 for insurance coverage for six months beginning January 1, 2015, and

 $3,400 for advertising during the quarter.
 
Was expense incurred that is not yet recorded? Yes. A portion of the rent and insurance and all of 
the advertising have been used during the quarter to generate revenue, but no entry has been made 
Step 1:


$ ) " 1 5&3     Adjustments, Financial Statements, and the Quality of Earnings

to record the amount used. Expenses are understated. Record these expenses separately as Rent 
Expense, Insurance Expense, and Advertising Expense.
 
Was the related cash paid in the past or will it be paid in the future? In the past. Chipotle 
prepaid rent, insurance, and advertising at the beginning of the quarter. These provided probable 
future benefits and were recorded as an asset Prepaid Expenses. Because a portion of these prepaid 
expenses have been used during the quarter, but no entry has been made yet to reflect that, the Pre-
paid Expenses account is overstated. Record a decrease in Prepaid Expenses.
 
Compute the amount of expense incurred. The computations for each are as follows:
 
∙ Rent: $22,000 per month × 3 months in the quarter = $66,000 used
 
∙ Insurance: ($48,000 prepaid × 3 months in the quarter) ÷ 6 months coverage = $24,000 used
 
∙ Advertising: All during the quarter = $3,400 used

AJE 5   Buildings and Equipment In Exhibit 4.4, we noted that Buildings and Equipment 
accounts are listed at cost. Buildings and equipment accounts increase by the cost of the assets 
when they are acquired and decrease by the cost of the assets when they are sold. However, 
these assets are also used over time to generate revenue. Thus, a part of their cost should be 
expensed in the same period (following the expense recognition principle). Accountants say 
that buildings and equipment, but not land, depreciate over time as they are used (land does not 
depreciate or get used up in an accounting sense). In accounting, depreciation is an allocation 
of the cost of buildings and equipment over their estimated useful lives to the organization.
To keep track of the asset’s historical cost, the amount that has been used is not subtracted 
directly from the asset account. Instead, it is accumulated in a new kind of account called a contra-
account. Contra-accounts are accounts that are directly linked to another account, but with an 
opposite balance. For Buildings and Equipment, the contra-account for the total cost used to date 
is called Accumulated Depreciation (noted in Exhibit 4.4). Accumulated Depreciation increases 
with the amount of depreciation expense for the period and decreases when an asset is sold for the 
portion used in prior periods. This is the first of several contra-accounts you will learn throughout 
the text. We will designate contra-accounts with an X in front of the type of account to which it is 
related. For example, this first contra-account will be shown as Accumulated Depreciation (XA).
CONTRA-ACCOUNT
An account that is an offset to, or 
reduction of, the primary account.


174
C HAP TER  4   Adjustments, Financial Statements, and the Quality of Earnings
Since assets have debit balances, Accumulated Depreciation has a credit balance. On the bal-
ance sheet, the amount that is reported for total property and equipment is its net book value 
(also called the book value or carrying value), which equals the ending balance in the Land, 
Buildings, and Equipment accounts (total cost of property and equipment) minus the ending 
balance in the Accumulated Depreciation account (used cost of buildings and equipment).

For Chipotle, based on unadjusted balances (from Exhibit 4.4 with dollars in thousands), 
land, buildings, and equipment have a total cost of $1,763,700 and Accumulated Deprecia-
tion has a credit balance of $613,700. On the balance sheet, property and equipment would be 
reported net of those two amounts as follows:
Depreciation is discussed in much greater detail in Chapter 8. Until then, we will give you 
the amount of depreciation estimated by the company. Chipotle estimates depreciation to be 
$122,400 per year.
 
Was expense incurred that is not yet recorded? Yes. The company used buildings and equip-
ment during the first quarter of 2015. However, no expense has yet been recorded, so expenses are 
understated. Record an increase in the expense account, Depreciation Expense.
 
Was the related cash paid in the past or will it be paid in the future? In the past. Chipotle 
purchased buildings and equipment in the past to be used over several years. The acquisitions were 
recorded in the asset accounts, which maintain the historical cost of the assets. The amount to be 
used in the future (net book value) must now be reduced for the depreciation for the first quarter of 
2015. Reduce the net book value by increasing the contra-account Accumulated Depreciation.
 
Compute the amount of expense incurred. The property and equipment have been used to gener-
ate revenue for the quarter. Thus, we need to calculate one quarter of Depreciation Expense:
Depreciation expense for the quarter = $122,400 for the year (given) × 1/4 of the year 
= $30,600

Accrued Expenses
Numerous expenses are incurred in the current period without being paid for until the next 
period. Common examples include Wages Expense for the wages owed to employees, Interest 
Expense incurred on debt, and Utilities Expense for the water, gas, and electricity used during

the period. These accrued expenses accumulate (accrue) over time but are not recognized until 
the end of the period in an adjusting entry.
AJE 6   Wages Chipotle’s employees earned $67,200 in wages for working two days at the end 
of the quarter. They will be paid in the next quarter.
 
Was expense incurred that is not yet recorded? Yes. The company used employee labor near 
the end of the first quarter of 2015. However, no expense has yet been recorded, so expenses are 
understated. Record an increase in Wages Expense.
 
Was the related cash paid in the past or will it be paid in the future? In the future. Chipotle 
will pay the employees in the next quarter, but no liability has yet been recorded. Liabilities are 
understated. Record an increase in Wages Payable.
 
Compute the amount of expense incurred. The amount of wages owed to employees is given. 
Record $67,200 in the adjusting entry.

AJE 7   Interest on Debt Chipotle borrowed $2,000 in long-term notes payable and had other 
interest-bearing obligations of $14,000 (of the $285,900 in Other Liabilities) at the beginning 
of the quarter. There are two components when borrowing (or lending) money: principal (the 
amount borrowed or loaned) and interest (the cost of borrowing or lending). The interest rate 
on Chipotle’s borrowings is 5.0 percent. Long-Term Notes Payable and a portion of Other 
Liabilities (the principal) were recorded properly when the money was borrowed. Their 
balances do not need to be adjusted. However, interest expense is incurred by Chipotle over 
time as the money is used, and it will be paid in the future.
 
Was expense incurred that is not yet recorded? Yes. Chipotle used borrowed funds during the 
quarter, but the expense has not yet been recognized. Expenses are understated. Record an in-
crease in the Interest Expense account.
 
Was the related cash paid in the past or will it be paid in the future? In the future. Chipotle 
will pay interest on the debt in the future. Because cash is owed, a payable account needs to be 
increased. Record an increase in Interest Payable.
 
Compute the amount of expense incurred. NOTE: Unless told otherwise, the interest rate on 
loans to others and debt is always given as an annual percentage. The following table gives the 
formula for computing interest for any part of a year:

AJE 8   Utilities Most organizations receive utility bills after using utility services such as 
electricity, natural gas, and telephone. Chipotle received a utility bill for $14,900 for usage 
during the quarter. The bill will be paid next quarter.
 
Was expense incurred that is not yet recorded? Yes. Chipotle used the utilities during the first 
quarter but has not yet recorded the expense. Expenses are understated. Record an increase in 
Utilities Expense.
 
Was the related cash paid in the past or will it be paid in the future? In the future. Chipotle 
will pay next quarter the utility bill owed for usage in the first quarter. The liability is understated. 
Increase the Utilities Payable account.
 
Compute the amount of expense incurred. The amount of the utilities incurred in the first quarter 
is given. Record $14,900 in the adjusting entry.

AJE 9   Income Taxes The final adjusting entry is to record the accrual of income taxes that 
will be paid in the next quarter. This requires computing adjusted pretax income and applying 
the appropriate tax rate.
 
Was expense incurred that is not yet recorded? Yes. Chipotle incurred taxes on its quarterly 
income. Until an adjusting entry is recorded at the end of the period based on all adjusted revenues, 
gains, expenses, and losses, total expenses on the income statement are understated. Record an 
increase in Income Tax Expense.
 
Was the related cash paid in the past or will it be paid in the future? In the future. Income 
taxes from the first quarter are due by the end of the second quarter. So the liabilities on the balance 
sheet must be increased. Record an increase in Income Taxes Payable.
 
Compute the amount of expense incurred. Income taxes are computed on the pretax income after 
all other adjustments. First determine adjusted pretax income:

In all of the above adjustments, you may have noticed that the Cash account was never 
adjusted. The cash has already been received or paid by the end of the period, or it will be 
received or paid in the next period. Adjustments are required to record revenues and expenses 
in the proper period because the cash part of the transaction is at a different point in time. In 
addition, each adjusting entry always included one income statement account and one 
balance sheet account. Now it’s your turn to practice the adjustment process.
P A U S E  F O R  F E E D B A C K
Adjustments are necessary at the end of the accounting cycle to record all revenues and expenses in 
the proper period and to reflect the proper valuation for assets and liabilities.

 Deferred revenues (liabilities) have balances at the end of the period because cash was 
received before it was earned. If all or part of the liability has been satisfied by the end of the 
period, revenue needs to be recorded and the liability reduced.

Florida Flippers, a scuba diving and instruction business, completed its first year of operations 
on December 31.
AJE 1:  
Florida Flippers received $6,000 from customers on November 15 for diving trips to 
the Bahamas in December and January of the next year. The $6,000 was recorded in 
Unearned Revenue on that date. By the end of December, one-third of the diving trips 
had been completed.
AJE 2:  
On December 31, Florida Flippers provided advanced diving instruction to 10 custom-
ers who will pay the business $800 in January of next year. No entry was made when 
the instruction was provided.
AJE 3:  
On September 1, Florida Flippers paid $24,000 for insurance for the 12 months begin-
ning on September 1. The amount was recorded as Prepaid Insurance on September 1.
AJE 4:  
On March 1, Florida Flippers borrowed $300,000 at 12 percent. Interest is payable 
each March 1 for three years.

As you learned in Chapter 1, the financial statements are interrelated—that is, the numbers 
from one statement flow into the next statement. The following illustration highlights the inter-
connections among the statements using the fundamental accounting equation.
Also notice special labels for the accounts. Balance sheet accounts are considered perma-
nent, indicating that they retain their balances from the end of one period to the beginning of 
the next. Revenue, expense, gain, and loss accounts are temporary accounts because their bal-
ances accumulate for a period but start with a zero balance at the beginning of the next period. 
These labels will be discussed in the section on closing the books, which follows our presenta-
tion of Chipotle’s financial statements.

A  Q U E ST I O N
O F  E T H I C S
Owners and managers of companies are most directly affected by the information presented in financial 
statements. If the financial performance and condition of the company appear strong, the company’s 
stock price rises. Shareholders usually receive dividends and increase their investment value. Manag-
ers often receive bonuses based on the strength of a company’s financial performance, and many in top 
management are compensated with options to buy their company’s stock at prices below market value. 
The higher the market value, the more compensation they earn. When actual performance lags behind 
expectations, managers and owners may be tempted to manipulate accruals and deferrals to make up part 
of the difference. For example, managers may record cash received in advance of being earned as revenue 
in the current period or may fail to accrue certain expenses at year-end.
Evidence from studies of large samples of companies indicates that some managers do engage in such 
behavior. This research is borne out by enforcement actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
against companies and sometimes against their auditors. In January 2003, an SEC study reported that, in 
a five-year period, there were 227 enforcement investigations. Of these, “126 involved improper revenue 
recognition and 101 involved improper expense recognition. . . . Of the 227 enforcement matters during 
the Study period, 157 resulted in charges against at least one senior manager. . . . Furthermore, the Study 
found that 57 enforcement matters resulted in charges for auditing violations. . . .” (p. 47).*
In many of these cases, the firms involved, their managers, and their auditors are penalized for such 
actions. Furthermore, owners suffer because news of an SEC investigation negatively affects the com-
pany’s stock price.
* These statistics are reported in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s study “Report Pursuant to Section 704 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,” January 27, 2003.

$ )"1 5&3     Adjustments, Financial Statements, and the Quality of Earnings
Before we prepare a complete set of financial statements, let’s update Chipotle’s trial bal-
ance to reflect the adjustments, providing us with the adjusted balances needed for the state-
ments. The spreadsheet in Exhibit 4.5 has three sets of debit-credit columns: One for the 
unadjusted balances as shown in Exhibit 4.4, then the effects of the adjustments AJE 1 through 
AJE 9, and, finally, the adjusted balances that are determined by adding or subtracting the 
adjustment across each row. Again, we note that the total debits equal the total credits in each 
of the sets. Also notice that nearly every revenue and expense account was adjusted, and sev-
eral new accounts were created during the adjustment process at the end of the period (e.g., 
Interest Receivable and Depreciation Expense). It is from these adjusted balances that we will 
prepare an income statement, a statement of stockholders’ equity (which includes a column for 
Retained Earnings), and a balance sheet.


 Revenues minus expenses yields net income (assuming it is positive) on the Income 
Statement.

 Net income (or net loss) and dividends to stockholders affect Retained Earnings and 
any additional issuances of stock during the period affect the balance in Common Stock 
and Additional Paid-in Capital, all of which appear on the Statement of Stockholders’ 
Equity.

 Stockholders’ Equity is a component of the Balance Sheet.
Thus, if a number on the income statement changes or is in error, it will impact the other 
statements.

Earnings per share (for the quarter)
$         2.45
You will note that the earnings per share (EPS) ratio is reported on the income statement. It 
is widely used in evaluating the operating performance and profitability of a company, and it 
is the only ratio required to be disclosed on the statement or in the notes to the statements. The 
actual computation of the ratio is quite complex and appropriate for more advanced accounting 
courses. In this text, we simplify the earnings per share computation as:
Earnings per Share* = Average number of shares of common stock 
 
outstanding† during the period
Net income
The denominator in the EPS ratio is the average number of shares outstanding (the number at 
the beginning of the period plus the number at the end of the period, divided by 2). For  
Chipotle 
Mexican Grill, the number of shares at the end of 2014 was 40,000,000 and we recorded an 
additional issuance of 10,000,000 shares at the beginning of the quarter. Therefore, the average 
number of shares outstanding was 50,000,000 the entire quarter.
If this quarterly EPS is repeated in the next three quarters, an annual EPS of $9.80 is expected. 
This would not be as high as the 2014 EPS of $14.35, suggesting issues of controlling revenues 
= $2.45 for the quarter
EPS =
$122,600,000 net income for the quarter
50,000,000 average number of shares outstanding
*If there are preferred dividends (discussed in Chapter 11), the amount is subtracted from net income in the 
numerator. In addition, the denominator is the weighted average of shares outstanding, a complex computation.
†Outstanding shares are those that are currently held by the shareholders.
Income Statement
The income statement is prepared first because net income is a component of Retained  
Earnings.

Balance Sheet
The ending balances for Common Stock, Additional Paid-in Capital, and Retained Earnings 
from the statement of stockholders’ equity are included on the balance sheet that follows. You 
will notice that the contra-asset account, Accumulated Depreciation (used cost), has been sub-
tracted from the total of the land, buildings, and equipment accounts (at cost) to reflect net 
book value (or carrying value) at month-end for balance sheet purposes. Also recall that assets 
are listed in order of liquidity, and liabilities are listed in order of due dates. Current assets are 
those used or turned into cash within one year (as well as inventory). Current liabilities are 
obligations to be paid with current assets within one year. We present the balances at the end of 
2014 and the balances at the end of the first quarter of 2015.

and expenses. For example, Chipotle experienced lower sales due to a low supply of pork for 
carnitas, a popular burrito ingredient. It also paid higher prices due to the higher cost of organic 
avocados supplied from one source in California. The lower EPS may also result from issuing 
additional shares of common stock at a greater rate than the increase in net income.
Statement of Stockholders’ Equity
The final total from the income statement, net income, is carried forward to the Retained Earn-
ings column of the statement of stockholders’ equity. To this, the additional elements of the 
statement are added. Dividends declared and an additional stock issuance (from prior chapters) 
are also included in the statement:
As presented in the previous chapters, the statement of cash flows explains the difference between the 
ending and beginning balances in the Cash account on the balance sheet during the accounting period. 
Put simply, the cash flow statement is a categorized list of all transactions of the period that affected the 
Cash account. The three categories are operating, investing, and financing activities. Since no adjust-
ments made in this chapter affected cash, the cash flow categories identified on the Cash T-account 
at the end of Chapter 3 remain the same.
Many standard financial analysis texts warn analysts to look for unusual deferrals and accruals when they 
attempt to predict future periods’ earnings. They often suggest that wide disparities between net income and 
cash flow from operations are a useful warning sign. For example, Subramanyan suggests the following:
Accounting accruals determining net income rely on estimates, deferrals, allocations, and valuations. 
These considerations sometimes allow more subjectivity than do the factors determining cash flows. 
For this reason we often relate cash flows from operations to net income in assessing its quality.

Some users consider earnings of higher quality when the ratio of cash flows from operations 
divided by net income is greater. This derives from a concern with revenue recognition or expense 
accrual criteria yielding high net income but low cash flows (emphasis added).*
The cash flows from operations to net income ratio is illustrated and discussed in more depth in 
Chapter 12.

ANALYTICAL QUESTION
How efficient is management in using assets (its resources) to generate sales?
%
RATIO AND COMPARISONS
The 2014 ratio for Chipotle is (dollars in thousands):
*($2,009,280 + $2,546,285) ÷ 2 (from 2014 10-K)

INTERPRETATIONS
In General The total asset turnover ratio measures how efficient management is at using assets to generate 
sales. Over time or compared to competitors, the higher the asset turnover is, the more efficient assets are being 
utilized to generate revenues. A company’s products or services and business strategy contribute significantly 
to its asset turnover ratio. However, when competitors are similar, management’s ability to control the firm’s 
assets is vital in determining its success. Stronger financial performance improves the asset turnover ratio.
Creditors and security analysts use this ratio to assess a company’s effectiveness at controlling both current 
and noncurrent assets. In a well-run business, creditors expect the ratio on a quarterly basis to fluctuate due to 
seasonal upswings and downturns. For example, as inventory is built up prior to a heavy sales season, compa-
nies need to borrow funds. The asset turnover ratio declines with this increase in assets. Eventually, the season’s 
high sales provide the cash needed to repay the loans. The asset turnover ratio then rises with the increased sales.
Focus Company Analysis Chipotle’s total asset turnover ratio has increased slightly since 2012, suggest-
ing an increase in management efficiency in using assets to generate operating revenues. Compared to its 
competitors, Chipotle’s total asset turnover ratio is higher than that for Panera Bread, but equivalent to the 
ratio for the Fiesta Restaurant Group. This is due in part to differences in business strategies. Chipotle and 
Panera are the two largest fast-casual restaurant chains. Chipotle’s recent growth strategy is to open a higher 
percentage of new stores annually than Panera. Adding new restaurants by Panera increases total assets (the 
denominator of the ratio), but the increase in its sales (the numerator) may lag behind until the stores are 
more well-established. In fact, Chipotle’s total asset turnover ratio has remained about the same over five 
years of continued growth, whereas Panera Bread’s ratio has fallen slightly and the ratio for Fiesta Restaurant 
Group, which is much smaller, has increased.
A Few Cautions While the total asset turnover ratio may decrease due to seasonal fluctuations, a 
declining ratio may also be caused by changes in corporate policies leading to a rising level of assets. 
Examples include relaxing credit policies for new customers or reducing collection efforts in accounts 
receivable. A detailed analysis of the changes in the key components of assets is needed to determine the 
causes of a change in the asset turnover ratio and thus management’s decisions.

End of the Accounting Cycle
The ending balance in each of the asset, liability, and stockholders’ equity accounts becomes 
the beginning account balance for the next period. These accounts, called permanent (real) 
accounts, are not reduced to a zero balance at the end of the accounting period. For example, 
PERMANENT (REAL) 
ACCOUNTS 
The balance sheet accounts that 
carry their ending balances into 
the next accounting period.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE 4-4 
Explain the closing process.



$ )"1 5&3     Adjustments, Financial Statements, and the Quality of Earnings
We will now prepare the closing entry (CE) for Chipotle at March 31, 2015, although compa-
nies close their records only at the end of the fiscal year.2 These amounts are taken from the 
adjusted trial balance in Exhibit 4.5.
the ending Cash balance of the prior accounting period is the beginning Cash balance of the 
next accounting period. The only time a permanent account has a zero balance is when the item 
it represents is no longer owned or owed.
On the other hand, revenue, expense, gain, and loss accounts are used to accumulate data for 
the current accounting period only; they are called temporary (nominal) accounts. The final 
step in the accounting cycle, closing the books, is done to prepare income statement accounts for 
the next accounting cycle. Therefore, at the end of each period, the balances in the temporary 
accounts are transferred, or closed, to the Retained Earnings account by recording a closing entry.
The closing entries have two purposes:
 
1. To transfer the balances in the temporary accounts (income statement accounts) to Retained 
Earnings.1
 
2. To establish a zero balance in each of the temporary accounts to start the accumulation in 
the next accounting period.
In this way, the income statement accounts are again ready for their temporary accumulation 
function for the next period. The closing entry is dated the last day of the accounting period, 
entered in the usual debits-equal-credits format (in the journal), and immediately posted to 
the ledger (or T-accounts). Temporary accounts with debit balances are credited and 
 
temporary accounts with credit balances are debited. The net amount, equal to net income, 
affects Retained Earnings.
To illustrate the process, we create an example using just a few accounts. The journal entry 
amounts are taken from the adjusted balances in the T-accounts:

sometimes dividends declared) 
accounts that are closed to

to Retained Earnings and to 
establish a zero balance in each of

1Companies may close income statement accounts to a special temporary summary account, called Income 
Summary, which is then closed to Retained Earnings.
2Most companies use computerized accounting software to record journal entries, produce trial balances and 
financial statements, and close the books.

Post-Closing Trial Balance
After the closing process is complete, all income statement accounts have a zero balance. These 
accounts are then ready for recording revenues and expenses in the new accounting period. The 
ending balance in Retained Earnings now is up-to-date (matches the amount on the balance 
sheet) and is carried forward as the beginning balance for the next period.
As an additional step of the accounting information processing cycle, a post-closing trial 
balance should be prepared as a check that debits still equal credits and that all temporary 
accounts have been closed. It would have the structure of the trial balance with only balance 
sheet accounts with balances. The accounting cycle for the period is now complete.

4-1. Explain the purpose of adjustments and analyze the adjustments necessary at the end of the 
period to update balance sheet and income statement accounts.  p. 166 

 Adjusting entries are necessary at the end of the accounting period to measure income properly, 
correct errors, and provide for adequate valuation of balance sheet accounts. There are four types:
 
a. Deferred revenues—previously recorded liabilities created when cash was received before 
being earned that must be adjusted for the amount of revenue earned during the period.
 
b. Accrued revenues—revenues that were earned during the period but have not yet been 
recorded (cash will be received in the future).
 
c. Deferred expenses—previously recorded assets (Prepaid Rent, Supplies, and Equipment) that 
must be adjusted for the amount of expense incurred during the period.
 
d. Accrued expenses—expenses that were incurred during the period but have not yet been 
recorded (cash will be paid in the future).
The analysis involves:
 
Step 1: 
 
Determining if revenue was earned or an expense was incurred. Record an increase in 
the revenue or expense account.
 
Step 2: 
 
Determining whether cash was received or paid in the past or will be received or 
paid in the future. If in the past, the existing asset or liability is overstated and needs 
to be reduced. If in the future, the related receivable or payable account needs to be 
increased.
 
Step 3: 
 
Computing the amount of revenue earned or expense incurred in the period.

 Recording adjusting entries has no effect on the Cash account.

4-2. Present an income statement with earnings per share, a statement of stockholders’ equity, and 
a balance sheet.  p. 179 
Adjusted account balances are used in preparing the following financial statements:

 Income Statement: Revenues − Expenses = Net Income (including earnings per share, com-
puted as net income divided by the average number of shares of common stock outstanding dur-
ing the period).  It may be classified into a section on operating revenues and expenses followed 
by a section on other items (primarily interest revenue, interest expense, and gains and losses on 
investments).

 Statement of Stockholders’ Equity: (Beginning Contributed Capital + Stock Issuances − Stock 
Repurchases) + (Beginning Retained Earnings + Net Income − Dividends Declared) = Ending 
Total Stockholders’ Equity.

 Balance Sheet: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity.  It is often classified into current 
assets followed by noncurrent assets and current liabilities followed by noncurrent liabilities.
 
4-3. Compute and interpret the total asset turnover ratio.  p. 185 
The total asset turnover ratio (Net Sales (or Operating Revenues) ÷ Average Total Assets) measures 
sales generated per dollar of assets. A rising total asset turnover signals more efficient management 
of assets.
 
4-4. Explain the closing process.  p. 185 
Temporary accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, and losses) are closed to a zero balance at the end 
of the accounting period to allow for the accumulation of income items in the following period and 
to update Retained Earnings for the period’s net income. To close these accounts, debit each rev-
enue and gain account, credit each expense and loss account, and record the difference (equal to net 
income) to Retained Earnings.
This chapter discussed the important steps in the accounting cycle that take place at year-end. These 
include the adjustment process, the preparation of the basic financial statements, and the closing process 
that prepares the records for the next accounting period. This end to the internal portions of the account-
ing cycle, however, is just the beginning of the process of communicating accounting information to 
external users.
In the next chapter, we take a closer look at more sophisticated financial statements and related 
disclosures. We also examine the process by which financial information is disseminated to profes-
sional analysts, investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the public, and the role each 
plays in analyzing and interpreting the information. These discussions will help you consolidate much 
of what you have learned about the financial reporting process from previous chapters. It will also 
preview many of the important issues we address in later chapters. These later chapters include many 
other adjustments that involve difficult and complex estimates about the future, such as estimates of 
customers’ ability to make payments to the company for purchases on account, the useful lives of new 
machines, and future amounts that a company may owe on warranties of products sold in the past. Each 
of these estimates and many others can have significant effects on the stream of net earnings that com-
panies report over time.

K E Y  R A T I O
Total asset turnover measures the sales generated per dollar of assets. A high or rising ratio suggests 
that the company is managing its assets more efficiently. It is computed as follows (see the “Key Ratio 
Analysis” box in the Preparing Financial Statements section):
Total Asset Turnover = Net Sales (or Operating Revenues)
Average Total Assets

After briefly reviewing the statements and “looking into the situation,” you requested that the statements 
be redone (with some expert help) to “incorporate depreciation, accruals, inventory counts, income taxes, 
and so on.” As a result of a review of the records and supporting documents, the following additional 
information was developed:
 
a. The Supplies of $4,000 shown on the balance sheet has not been adjusted for supplies used during 2017. 
A count of the supplies on hand on December 31, 2017, showed $1,800 worth of supplies remaining.
 
b. The insurance premium paid in 2017 was for years 2017 and 2018. The total insurance premium was 
debited in full to Prepaid Insurance when paid in 2017 and no adjustment has been made.
 
c. The equipment cost $40,000 when purchased January 1, 2017. It had an estimated annual depreciation 
of $8,000. No depreciation has been recorded for 2017.
 
d. Unpaid (and unrecorded) salaries at December 31, 2017, amounted to $3,200.
 
e. At December 31, 2017, transportation revenue collected in advance amounted to $7,000. This amount 
was credited in full to Transportation Revenue when the cash was collected earlier during 2017.
 f. The income tax rate is 35 percent.
Required:
 1. Record the six adjusting entries required on December 31, 2017, based on the preceding additional 
information.
 2. Recast the preceding statements after taking into account the adjusting entries. You do not need to 
use classifications on the statements. Suggested form for the solution:

 3. Omission of the adjusting entries caused:
 
a. Net income to be overstated or understated (select one) by $ _____.
 
b. Total assets on the balance sheet to be overstated or understated (select one) by $_____.
 
c. Total liabilities on the balance sheet to be overstated or understated (select one) by $ _____.
 4. For both the unadjusted and adjusted balances, calculate these ratios for the company: (a) 
earnings per share (rounded to two decimal places) and (b) total asset turnover (rounded to 
three decimal places). There were 10,000 shares outstanding all year. Explain the causes of the dif-
ferences and the impact of the changes on financial analysis.

t is the rare person today who has not been affected by Apple products and services. From the 
first commercially viable personal computer, the Apple II introduced in 1977, to the raft of 
mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, software, and iStore content 
that we all use today, Apple has fundamentally changed the way we work, play, and interact. Apple 
Inc. the company is a far cry from the startup incorporated by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and a 
group of venture capitalists in 1977. Its 1977 sales of $1 million rose to $1 billion by 1982 and 
exceeded $180 billion in 2014. To accomplish this feat, Apple didn’t just invent new products; it 
created whole new product categories such as the personal music player, the smartphone, and the 
tablet. And its laserlike focus on superior ease-of-use; seamless integration of hardware, software, 
and content; innovative design; and frequent updating make it very difficult for others to compete.
Apple’s financial statements reflect its phenomenal sales and profit growth and convey this 
information to the stock market. Apple’s stock price increased more than sevenfold over the 
last six years in response to news of its success.
Financial statement information will only affect a company’s stock price if the market 
believes in the integrity of the financial communication process. As a publicly traded com-
pany, Apple Inc. is required to provide detailed information in regular filings with the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission. As the certifying officers of the company, current President 
and CEO Timothy Cook and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri

and development, marketing, and advertising and is known for introducing new and 
innovative products long before the end of existing products’ life cycles.
Apple also invests in corporate governance: procedures designed to ensure that 
the company is managed in the interests of the shareholders. Much of its corporate 
governance system is aimed at ensuring integrity in the financial reporting process. 
Good corporate governance eases the company’s access to capital, lowering both 
the costs of borrowing (interest rates) and the perceived riskiness of Apple’s stock.
Apple knows that when investors lose faith in the truthfulness of a firm’s account-
ing numbers, they also normally punish the company’s stock. Disclosure of an account-
ing fraud causes, on average, a 20 percent drop in the price of a company’s stock. The

THE FRAUD TRIANGLE
RATIONALIZATION
OPPORTUNITY
INCENTIVE
Three conditions are necessary for financial statement fraud to occur. There must be (1) an incentive 
to commit fraud, (2) the opportunity to commit fraud, and (3) the ability to rationalize the misdeed. 
These conditions make up what antifraud experts call the fraud triangle. A good system of corporate 
governance is designed to address these conditions. Clear lines of responsibility and sure and severe 
punishment counteract incentives to commit fraud. Strong internal controls and oversight by directors 
and auditors reduce opportunity to commit fraud. A strong code of ethics, ethical actions by those at the 
top of the organization, fair dealings with employees, and rewards for whistle-blowing make it more dif-
ficult for individuals to rationalize fraud. Financial statement users also have a role to play in preventing 
fraud. While even the savviest user can still be surprised by fraudulent reports in some cases, accounting 
knowledge and healthy skepticism are the best protection from such surprises.

understanding of financial statements, we will next take a closer look at the people involved 
and the regulations that govern the process that conveys accounting information to state-
ment users in the Internet age. We will also take a more detailed look at statement formats 
and additional disclosures provided in financial reports to help you learn how to find relevant 
information. Finally, we will examine a general framework for assessing a company’s business 
strategy and performance based on these reports.

Exhibit 5.1 summarizes the major actors involved in ensuring the integrity of the financial 
reporting process.
Regulators (SEC, FASB, PCAOB, Stock Exchanges)
The mission of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is to protect investors 
and maintain the integrity of the securities markets. As part of this mission, the SEC oversees 
the work of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which sets generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP), and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(PCAOB), which sets auditing standards for independent auditors (CPAs) of public companies.
The SEC staff also reviews the reports filed with it for compliance with its standards, investigates 
irregularities, and punishes violators. During 2009 through 2014, the SEC brought 651 enforce-
ment actions related to financial fraud and issuer financial reporting.1 As a consequence, a number 
of high-profile company officers have recently been fined and sentenced to jail. Consequences to 
the company can include enormous financial penalties as well as bankruptcy, as in the cases of 
 
Le-Nature’s, Enron, and WorldCom. You can read about recent SEC enforcement actions at:
www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/friactions.shtml
Managers (CEO, CFO, and Accounting Staff)
The primary responsibility for the information in Apple’s financial statements and related dis-
closures lies with management, specifically the highest officer in the company, often called 
the chief executive officer (CEO), and the highest officer associated with the financial and 
accounting side of the business, often called the chief financial officer (CFO). At Apple and 
all public companies, these two officers must personally certify that:

 Each report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission does not contain any untrue 
material statement or omit a material fact and fairly presents in all material respects the 
financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the company.

roles in the process, and the 
guidance they receive from legal 
and professional standards.


 There are no significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the internal controls over 
financial reporting.

 They have disclosed to the auditors and audit committee of the board any weaknesses in 
internal controls or any fraud involving management or other employees who have a signifi-
cant role in financial reporting.
Executives who knowingly certify false financial reports are subject to a fine of $5 million 
and a 20-year prison term. The members of the accounting staff, who actually prepare the 
details of the reports, also bear professional responsibility for the accuracy of this information, 
although their legal responsibility is smaller. Their future professional success depends heavily 
on their reputation for honesty and competence. Accounting managers responsible for finan-
cial statements with material errors are routinely fired and often have difficulty finding other 
employment.
Board of Directors (Audit Committee)
As Apple’s statement on corporate governance indicates, the board of directors (elected by 
the stockholders) oversees the chief executive officer and other senior management in the com-
petent and ethical operation of Apple on a day-to-day basis and assures that the long-term 
interests of shareholders are being served. The audit committee of the board, which must be 
composed of nonmanagement (independent) directors with financial knowledge, is responsible 
for ensuring that processes are in place for maintaining the integrity of the company’s account-
ing, financial statement preparation, and financial reporting. It is responsible for hiring the 
company’s independent auditors. Members of the audit committee meet separately with the 
auditors to discuss management’s compliance with their financial reporting responsibilities.
Auditors
The SEC requires publicly traded companies to have their statements and their control systems 
over the financial reporting process audited by an independent registered public accounting 
firm (independent auditor) following auditing standards established by the PCAOB. Many pri-
vately owned companies also have their statements audited. By signing an unqualified (clean) 
audit opinion, a CPA firm assumes part of the financial responsibility for the fairness of the 
financial statements and related presentations. This opinion, which adds credibility to the state-
ments, is also often required by agreements with lenders and private investors. Subjecting the 
company’s statements to independent verification reduces the risk that the company’s financial 
condition is misrepresented in the statements. As a result, rational investors and lenders should 
lower the rate of return (interest) they charge for providing capital. Examples of an unqualified 
audit opinion are presented under Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm in 
Appendix B and Appendix C of this text.
Ernst & Young is currently Apple’s auditor. Ernst & Young, Deloitte, KPMG, and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers make up what are referred to as the “Big 4” CPA firms. Each of 
these firms employs thousands of CPAs in offices scattered throughout the world. They audit 
the great majority of publicly traded companies as well as many that are privately held. Some 
public companies and most private companies are audited by smaller CPA firms. A list of the 
auditors for selected focus companies follows.

Information Intermediaries: Information Services  
and Financial Analysts
Students often view the communication process between companies and financial statement 
users as a simple process of mailing the report to individual shareholders who read the report 
and then make investment decisions based on what they have learned. This simple picture is far 
from today’s reality. Now most investors rely on company websites, information services, and 
financial analysts to gather and analyze information.
Companies actually file their SEC forms electronically through the EDGAR (Electronic Data 
Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) Service, which is sponsored by the SEC. Each fact in the 
report is now tagged to identify its source and meaning using a language called XBRL. Users can 
retrieve information from EDGAR within 24 hours of its submission, long before it is available 
through the mail. EDGAR is a free service available on the Web under “Filings & Forms” at:
www.sec.gov
Most companies also provide direct access to their financial statements and other information 
over the Web. You can contact Apple at:
investor.apple.com
Information services allow investors to gather their own information about the com-
pany and monitor the recommendations of a variety of analysts. Financial analysts and other 
sophisticated users obtain much of the information they use from the wide variety of com-
mercial online information services. Fee-based services such as Compustat and  
Thomson 
Reuters provide broad access to financial statements and news information. A growing num-
ber of other resources offering a mixture of free and fee-based information exist on the Web. 
These include:
www.google.com/finance 
finance.yahoo.com 
www.marketwatch.com
www.bloomberg.com 
Exhibit 5.2 suggests the wide range of information about Apple available on the Google 
Finance website. It includes stock price and financial statement information, news accounts, 
and important future events related to Apple. Note that the financial information at the bot-
tom of the exhibit matches the income statement information and ratio calculations for Apple 
and its two largest competitors presented later in this chapter. To see what has happened to 
Apple since this chapter was written, go to www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:AAPL. 
Look at the “Related Companies” section to see how Apple has fared compared to its com-
petitors. Click on “Financials” on the top left menu to review the most recent financial 
statements.
Financial analysts receive accounting reports and other information about the company 
from electronic information services. They also gather information through conversations 
with company executives and visits to company facilities and competitors. The results of 
their analyses are combined into analysts’ reports. Analysts’ reports normally include fore-
casts of future quarterly and annual earnings per share and share price; a buy, hold, or sell 
recommendation for the company’s shares; and explanations for these judgments. In mak-
ing their earnings forecasts, the analysts rely heavily on their knowledge of the way the 
accounting system translates business events into the numbers on a company’s financial 
statements, which is the subject matter of this text. Individual analysts often specialize in 
particular industries (such as sporting goods or energy companies). Analysts are regularly 
evaluated based on the accuracy of their forecasts, as well as the profitability of their stock

advisory services such as Value Line that sell their advice to others. Through their reports and 
recommendations, analysts are transferring their knowledge of accounting, the company, and 
the industry to customers who lack this expertise.

Users: Institutional and Private Investors, Creditors, and Others
Institutional investors include pension funds (associated with companies, unions, or govern-
ment agencies); mutual funds; and endowment, charitable foundation, and trust funds (such as 
the endowment of your college or university). These institutional stockholders usually employ 
their own analysts, who also rely on the information intermediaries just discussed. Institutional 
shareholders control the majority of publicly traded shares of U.S. companies. For example, 
at the time this chapter is being written, institutional investors own 61 percent of Apple stock. 
Apple’s three largest institutional investors follow:
Institution
Approximate Ownership
Vanguard Group Inc.
5.70%
State Street Corp.
4.22%
FMR LLC
3.07%
Most small investors own stock in companies such as Apple indirectly through mutual and pen-
sion funds.
Private investors include large individual investors such as the venture capitalists who orig-
inally invested directly in Apple, as well as small retail investors who buy shares of publicly 
traded companies through brokers such as Fidelity. Retail investors normally lack the expertise 
to understand financial statements and the resources to gather data efficiently. They often rely 
on the advice of information intermediaries or turn their money over to the management of 
mutual and pension funds (institutional investors).
Lenders, or creditors, include suppliers, banks, commercial credit companies, and other 
financial institutions that lend money to companies. Lending officers and financial analysts 
in these organizations use the same public sources of information. They also use additional 
financial information (e.g., monthly statements) that companies often agree to provide as part 
of the lending contract. Lenders are the primary external user group for financial statements of 
private companies. Institutional and private investors also become creditors when they buy a 
company’s publicly traded bonds.
Financial statements also play an important role in the relationships between suppliers 
and customers. Customers evaluate the financial health of suppliers to determine whether 
they will be reliable, up-to-date sources of supply. Suppliers evaluate their customers to 
estimate their future needs and ability to pay debts. Competitors also attempt to learn useful 
information about a company from its statements. The potential loss of competitive advan-
tage is one of the costs of public financial disclosures. Accounting regulators consider these 
costs as well as the direct costs of preparation when they consider requiring new disclosures. 
Cost-effectiveness requires the benefits of accounting for and reporting information to out-
weigh the costs. Small amounts do not have to be reported separately or accounted for pre-
cisely according to GAAP if they would not influence users’ decisions. Accountants usually 
designate such items and amounts as immaterial. Determining material amounts is often 
very subjective.
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS
Managers of pension, mutual, 
endowment, and other funds that 
invest on the behalf of others.
PRIVATE INVESTORS
Individuals who purchase shares 
in companies.
LENDERS (CREDITORS)
Suppliers and financial 
institutions that lend money to 
companies.
COST-EFFECTIVENESS
Requires that the benefits of 
accounting for and reporting 
information should outweigh the 
costs.
MATERIAL AMOUNTS
Amounts that are large enough to 
influence a user's decision.
Information Services and Your Job Search
Information services have become the primary tool for professional analysts who use them to analyze 
competing firms. Information services are also an important source of information for job seekers. Poten-
tial employers expect job applicants to demonstrate knowledge of their companies during an interview, 
and electronic information services are an excellent source of company information. The best place to 
begin learning about potential employers is to visit their websites. Be sure to read the material in the 
employment section and the investor relations section of the site. To learn more about electronic infor-
mation services, contact the business or reference librarian at your college or university or explore the 
websites discussed in this section.

T HE DISCLOSUR E  P ROC E SS
As noted in our discussion of information services and information intermediaries, the account-
ing communication process includes more steps and participants than one would envision in a 
world in which annual and quarterly reports are simply mailed to shareholders. SEC regulation 
FD, for “Fair Disclosure,” requires that companies provide all investors equal access to all impor-
tant company news. Managers and other insiders are also prohibited from trading their compa-
ny’s shares based on nonpublic (insider) information so that no party benefits from early access.
Press Releases
To provide timely information to external users and to limit the possibility of selective leakage of 
information, Apple and other public companies announce quarterly and annual earnings through 
a press release as soon as the verified figures (audited for annual and reviewed for quarterly 
earnings) are available. Apple normally issues its earnings press releases within four weeks of 
the end of the accounting period. The announcements are sent electronically to the major print 
and electronic news services, including Dow Jones, Thomson Reuters, and Bloomberg, which 
make them immediately available to subscribers. Exhibit 5.3 shows an excerpt from a typical 
earnings press release for Apple that includes key financial figures. This excerpt is followed by 
management’s discussion of the results and condensed income statements and balance sheets, 
which will be included in the formal report to shareholders, distributed after the press release.
Many companies, including Apple, follow these press releases with a conference call dur-
ing which senior managers answer analysts’ questions about the quarterly results. These calls 
are open to the investing public. Listening to these recordings is a good way to learn about a 
company’s business strategy and its expectations for the future, as well as key factors that ana-
lysts consider when they evaluate a company.

In this section, we learned the roles of different parties in the accounting communication process 
and the guidance they receive from legal and professional standards. Management of the reporting 
company decides the appropriate format and level of detail to present in its financial reports. Inde-
pendent audits increase the credibility of the information. Directors monitor managers’ compliance 
with reporting standards and hire the auditor. The SEC staff reviews public financial reports for com-
pliance with legal and professional standards and punishes violators. Financial statement announce-
ments from public companies usually are first transmitted to users through electronic information 
services. Analysts play a major role in making financial statement and other information available to 
average investors through their stock recommendations and earnings forecasts. Before you move on,

accounting communication 
process, including the issuance 
of press releases, annual 
reports, quarterly reports, 
and SEC filings, as well as the 
role of electronic information 
services in this process.

Companies such as Apple also issue press releases concerning other important events such 
as new product announcements. Press releases related to annual earnings and quarterly earn-
ings often precede the issuance of the quarterly or annual report by 15 to 45 days. This time is 
necessary to prepare the additional detail and to distribute those reports.
Annual Reports and Form 10-K
For privately held companies, annual reports are relatively simple documents photocopied on 
white bond paper. They normally include only the following:
 
1. Four basic financial statements: income statement, balance sheet, stockholders’ equity or 
retained earnings statement, and cash flow statement.
 
2. Related notes (footnotes).
 
3. Report of Independent Accountants (Auditor’s Opinion) if the statements are audited.
The annual reports of public companies filed on Form 10-K are significantly more elaborate 
mainly because of additional SEC reporting requirements. SEC reports are normally referred

The annual report that publicly 
traded companies must file with 
the SEC.
How Does the Stock Market React to Earnings Announcements?
For actively traded stocks such as Apple, most of the stock market reaction (stock price increases and 
decreases from investor trading) to the news in the press release usually occurs quickly. Recall that a 
number of analysts follow Apple and regularly predict the company’s earnings. When the actual earnings 
are published, the market reacts not to the amount of earnings, but to the difference between expected 
earnings and actual earnings. This amount is called unexpected earnings. In January, analysts expected 
Apple to report quarterly profit of $2.60 per share. In its press release presented in Exhibit 5.3, Apple’s 
actual earnings per share for the quarter ended up being $3.06 per share. Unexpected earnings (Actual - 
 
Expected) were thus $0.46 per share ($3.06 - $2.60) and, as a result, the share price opened at $8 the 
next day, a 7 percent increase.

APPLE REPORTS RECORD FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS
Highest-Ever Revenue and Earnings Drive 48% Increase in EPS
Growth Led by Record Revenue from iPhone, Mac, and App Store
CUPERTINO, California—January 27, 2015—Apple® today announced financial results for
its fiscal 2015 first quarter ended December 27, 2014. The Company posted record quarterly
revenue of $74.6 billion and record quarterly net profit of $18 billion, or $3.06 per diluted share.
These results compare to revenue of $57.6 billion and net profit of $13.1 billion, or $2.07 per
diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 39.9 percent compared to 37.9 percent
in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 65 percent of the quarter’s revenue.
The results were fueled by all-time record revenue from iPhone® and Mac® sales as well as
record performance of the App StoreSM. iPhone unit sales of 74.5 million also set a new record.
“We’d like to thank our customers for an incredible quarter, which saw demand for Apple
products soar to an all-time high,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Our revenue grew 30 percent
over last year to $74.6 billion, and the execution by our teams to achieve these results was
simply phenomenal.”

to by number (for example, the “10-K”). The principal components of the financial disclosures 
in the 10-K include:
Item 1. Business: Description of business operations and company strategy.
Item 6. Selected Financial Data: Summarized financial data for a 5-year period.
Item 7.  
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations: Management’s views on the causes of its successes and failures dur-
ing the reporting period and the risks it faces in the future.
Item 8.  
Financial Statements and Supplemental Data: The four basic financial state-
ments and related notes, the report of management, and the auditor’s report (Report 
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm).
Except for the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, most of these elements have been cov-
ered in earlier chapters. This element includes an explanation of key figures on the financial 
statements and the risks the company faces in the future. The Form 10-K also provides a more 
detailed description of the business, including its products, product development, sales and 
marketing, manufacturing, and competitors. It also lists properties owned or leased, any legal 
proceedings it is involved in, and significant contracts it has signed.
Quarterly Reports and Form 10-Q
Quarterly reports for private companies include condensed financial statements providing fewer 
details than annual statements and only key notes to the statements. They are not audited and 
so are marked unaudited. Often the cash flow statement, statement of stockholders’ equity, 
and some notes to the financial statements are omitted. Private companies normally prepare 
quarterly reports for their lenders. Public companies file their quarterly reports on Form 10-Q 
with the SEC. The Form 10-Q contains most of the information items provided in the financial 
section (PART II) of the 10-K and some additional items.
Other SEC Reports
Public companies must file other reports with the SEC. These include the current event reports 
Form 8-K, which is used to disclose any material event not previously reported that is impor-
tant to investors (e.g., auditor changes, mergers). Other filing requirements for public compa-
nies are described on the SEC website.

The financial statements shown in previous chapters provide a good introduction to their con-
tent and structure. In this section, we will discuss three additional characteristics of financial 
statements and the related disclosures that are designed to make them more useful to investors, 
creditors, and analysts:

 Comparative financial statements. To allow users to compare performance from period to 
period, companies report financial statement values for the current period and one or more 
prior periods. Apple and most U.S. companies present two years’ balance sheets and three 
years’ income statements, cash flow statements, and statements of stockholders’ equity.

 Additional subtotals and classifications in financial statements. You should not be con-
fused when you notice slightly different statement formats used by different companies. In this 
section, we will focus on similarities and differences in the classifications and line items pre-
sented on Apple’s and Chipotle’s balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.

 Additional disclosures. Most companies present voluminous notes that are necessary to under-
stand a company’s performance and financial condition. In addition, certain complex transac-
tions require additional statement disclosures. We take a closer look at some of Apple’s note 
disclosures to prepare you for more detailed discussions in the remaining chapters in this text.
FORM 10-Q

traded companies must file with 
the SEC.
FORM 8-K
The report used by publicly

Exhibit 5.4 shows the September 27, 2014, balance sheet for Apple. This balance sheet looks 
very similar in structure to the balance sheet for Chipotle presented in Chapter 4, but it is pre-
sented for two years to ease comparisons over time. The statement classifications (current vs. 
noncurrent assets and current vs. noncurrent liabilities) play a major role in our discussion of 
ratio analysis (e.g., the current ratio in Chapter 2).

Balance Sheet of Apple Inc.


242
C HAP TER  5   Communicating and Interpreting Accounting Information
Apple’s balance sheet contains an item, not included in Chipotle’s, that is worthy of addi-
tional discussion. Intangible assets (discussed in Chapter 8) have no physical existence and 
a long life. Examples are patents, trademarks, copyrights, franchises, and goodwill from pur-
chasing other companies. Most intangibles (except goodwill, trademarks, and other intangibles 
with indefinite lives) are amortized as they are used in a manner similar to the depreciation 
of tangible assets (Amortization Expense is debited and the contra-asset Accumulated Amor-
tization is credited). Just as tangible fixed assets are reported net of accumulated deprecia-
tion, intangible assets are reported net of accumulated amortization on the balance sheet. 
Goodwill is a more general intangible asset representing the excess of the price paid for another 
company over the value of its identifiable assets. It is discussed in more detail in Chapter 8.
Also recall our discussion of deferred revenues from Chapter 4. These are liabilities created 
when customers pay for goods or services before the company delivers them. In Apple’s bal-
ance sheet, deferred revenues show up in two places: current liabilities and noncurrent 
liabilities. They both relate primarily to product warranties that Apple includes with its prod-
ucts. The deferred revenues related to repairs Apple expects to provide during the next year are 
classified as current. Those that relate to repairs to be provided in later years are classified as 
noncurrent.
When you first look at a new set of financial statements, try not to be confused by differ-
ences in terminology. When interpreting line items you have never seen before, be sure to con-
sider their description and their classification.
Classified Income Statement
Apple’s 2014 consolidated income statement is reprinted in Exhibit 5.5. It presents the income 
statement followed by earnings per share for three years, as required by the SEC. Apple’s 
income statement includes one subtotal not included in Chipotle’s. Like many manufacturing 
and merchandising (retail and wholesale) companies that sell goods, Apple reports the subtotal 
Gross Profit (gross margin), which is the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold. 
It is important to note that regardless of whether a company reports a gross profit sub-
total, the income statement presents the same information. Another subtotal—Operating 
Income (also called Income from Operations)—is computed by subtracting operating expenses 
from gross profit.
Nonoperating (other) Items are revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that do not relate to 
the company’s primary operations. Examples include interest income, interest expense, and 
gains and losses on the sale of investments. These nonoperating items are added to or sub-
tracted from income from operations to obtain Income before Income Taxes, also called Pre-
tax Earnings. At this point, Provision for Income Taxes (Income Tax Expense) is subtracted to 
obtain Net Income. Some companies show fewer subtotals on their income statements. No dif-
ference exists in the revenue, expense, gain, and loss items reported using the different formats. 
Only the categories and subtotals differ.
When a major component of a business is sold or abandoned, income or loss from that 
component earned before the disposal, as well as any gain or loss on disposal, is included as 
Discontinued Operations. The item is presented separately because it is not useful in predict-
ing the future income of the company given its nonrecurring nature. If discontinued operations 
are reported, an additional subtotal is presented before this item for Income from Continuing 
Operations.
Finally, earnings per share is reported. Simple computations of earnings per share (EPS) 
are as follows:
Earnings per Share = 
Net Income*
Average Number of Shares of Common Stock  
Outstanding during the Period
GROSS PROFIT (GROSS 
MARGIN)
Net sales less cost of goods sold.
OPERATING INCOME 
(INCOME FROM 
OPERATIONS)
Net sales less cost of goods sold 
and other operating expenses.
INCOME BEFORE INCOME 
TAXES (PRETAX EARNINGS)
Revenues minus all expenses 
except income tax expense.
*If there are preferred dividends (discussed in Chapter 11), the amount is subtracted from net income in the 
numerator.

Statement of Comprehensive Income
Both the FASB and the IASB require an additional statement entitled the Statement of Comprehen-
sive Income, which can be presented separately or in combination with the income statement. When 
presented separately, the statement starts with Net Income, the bottom line of the income statement. 
Following this total would be the components of other comprehensive income. The Net Income and 
Other Comprehensive Income items are then combined to create a total called Comprehensive Income 
(the bottom line for this statement). The following summarizes the information Apple presented in 
a recent quarterly report. Other Comprehensive Income items include fair value changes on certain 
marketable securities, which are discussed in Appendix A, as well as other items discussed in more 
advanced accounting classes.

As Apple’s statements suggest, most statements are classified and include subtotals that are relevant 
to analysis. On the balance sheet, the most important distinctions are between current and noncurrent 
assets and liabilities. On the income statement, the subtotals gross profit and income from operations 
are most important. So the next step in preparing to analyze financial statements is to see if you under-
stand the effects of transactions you have already studied on these subtotals. The following questions 
will test your ability to do so.
S E L F - S T U D Y  Q U I Z
 
1. Complete the following tabulation, indicating the direction (+ for increase, - for decrease, 
and NE for no effect) and amount of the effect of each transaction. Consider each item 
independently. (Hint: Prepare journal entries for each transaction. Then consider the bal-
ance sheet or income statement classification of each account affected to come up with your 
answers.)

The key subtotals on the income statement we just discussed also play a major role in financial ratio 
analysis. As we noted above, net sales less cost of goods sold equals the subtotal gross profit or gross 
margin. Analysts often examine gross profit as a percentage of sales (the gross profit or gross margin 
percentage).

Statement of Stockholders’ Equity
The statement of stockholders’ (shareholders’) equity reports the changes in each of the 
company’s stockholders’ equity accounts during the accounting period. Exhibit 5.6 presents 
Apple’s 2014 consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity. The statement has a column for 
each stockholders’ equity account and one for the effect on total stockholders’ equity. (Apple 
combines the common stock account and additional paid-in capital accounts.) The first row 
of the statement starts with the beginning balances in each account, which correspond to the 
prior year’s ending balances on the balance sheet. Each row that follows lists each event that 
occurred during the period that affected any stockholders’ equity accounts. Apple reported net 
income of $39,510 for the year, which increases retained earnings. Apple declared dividends of 
$11,215, which is subtracted from retained earnings. Apple issued 60,344 shares of common 
stock during the year and received $5,102 million for the issuance. Note that the number of 
shares and the dollar amount are both listed. It is important not to confuse them. Apple 
also repurchased and retired shares. This topic is discussed in Chapter 11. The final row lists 
the ending balances in the accounts, which correspond to the ending balances on the balance 
sheet. Public companies must present information for the prior three years in their statements

INTERPRETATIONS
In General The gross profit percentage measures a company’s ability to charge premium prices and pro-
duce goods and services at low cost. All other things equal, a higher gross profit results in higher net income.
Business strategy, as well as competition, affects the gross profit percentage. Companies pursuing a 
product-differentiation strategy use research and development and product promotion activities to con-
vince customers of the superiority or distinctiveness of the company’s products. This allows them to 
charge premium prices, producing a higher gross profit percentage. Companies following a low-cost 
strategy rely on more efficient management of production to reduce costs and increase the gross profit 
percentage. Managers, analysts, and creditors use this ratio to assess the effectiveness of the company’s 
product development, marketing, and production strategy.
Focus Company Analysis Apple’s gross profit percentage has remained fairly steady over the past 
three years and remains well above that of its competitor, HP. At the beginning of the chapter, we 
discussed key elements of Apple’s business strategy that focused on introducing new integrated tech-
nologies, product lines, and styles, as well as managing production and inventory costs. Each of these 
elements can have a large effect on gross profit. Its Form 10-K indicates that its various product lines 
have different gross profit percentages and that a large increase in iPhone sales increased the overall 
gross profit percentage. Introducing new products with higher initial cost structures can decrease gross 
profit percentage.
A Few Cautions To assess the company’s ability to sustain its gross profits, you must understand the 
sources of any change in the gross profit percentage. For example, an increase in margin resulting from 
increased sales of high-margin new products can be eroded by actions of competitors or increases in 
component costs for popular products. Also, higher prices must often be sustained with higher R&D and 
advertising costs, which reduce net income and can offset any increase in gross profit. This has not been 
the case for Apple in recent years as we will see later in the chapter. Apple’s astonishing gross profit 
results in an industry-leading net profit margin and return on assets.

of stockholders’ equity. So Apple’s 2012 and 2013 statements would be presented above the 
information shown in Exhibit 5.6.
Statement of Cash Flows
We introduced the three cash flow statement classifications in prior chapters:
Cash Flows from Operating Activities. This section reports cash flows associated with 
earning income.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash flows in this section are associated with the 
purchase and sale of (1) productive assets (other than inventory) and (2) investments in 
other companies.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities. These cash flows are related to financing the busi-
ness through borrowing and repaying loans from financial institutions, stock (equity) issu-
ances and repurchases, and dividend payments.
Exhibit 5.7 presents Apple’s 2014 consolidated statement of cash flows. The first section 
(Cash Flows from Operating Activities) can be reported using either the direct or indirect 
method. For Apple, this first section is reported using the indirect method, which presents a 
reconciliation of net income on an accrual basis to cash flows from operations.
The Operating Activities section prepared using the indirect method helps the analyst 
understand the causes of differences between a company’s net income and its cash flows. Net 
income and cash flows from operating activities can be quite different. Remember that the 
income statement is prepared under the accrual concept. Revenues are recorded when earned 
without regard to when the related cash flows occur. Likewise, expenses are matched with 
revenues and recorded in the same period without regard to when the related cash flows occur.
In the indirect method, the Operating Activities section starts with net income computed under 
the accrual concept and then eliminates noncash items, leaving cash flow from operating activities:
Net income
+/-Adjustments for noncash items
Cash provided by operating activities
The items listed between these two amounts explain the reasons they differ. For example, since 
no cash is paid during the current period for Apple’s depreciation expense reported on the income

statement, this amount is added back to net income to eliminate its effect. Similarly, increases and 
decreases in certain assets and liabilities (called operating assets and liabilities) also account for 
some of the difference between net income and cash flow from operations. For example, sales on 
account increase net income as well as the current asset accounts receivable, but sales on account 
do not increase cash. As we cover different portions of the income statement and balance sheet in 
more detail in Chapters 6 through 11, we will also discuss the relevant sections of the cash flow 
statement. Then we discuss the complete cash flow statement in detail in Chapter 12.
Notes to Financial Statements
While the numbers reported on the various financial statements provide important information, users 
require additional details to facilitate their analysis. All financial reports include additional informa-
tion in notes that follow the statements. Apple’s 2014 notes include three types of information:
 
1. Descriptions of the key accounting rules applied to the company’s statements.
 
2. Additional detail supporting reported numbers.
 
3. Relevant financial information not disclosed on the statements.

Accounting Rules Applied in the Company’s Statements
One of the first notes is typically a summary of significant accounting policies. As you will 
see in your study of subsequent chapters, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) 
permit companies to select from alternative methods for measuring the effects of transac-
tions. The summary of significant accounting policies tells the user which accounting meth-
ods the company has adopted. Apple’s accounting policy for property, plant, and equipment 
is as follows:
We will discuss alternative depreciation methods in Chapter 8. Without an understanding of 
the various accounting methods used, it is impossible to analyze a company’s financial results 
effectively.
Additional Detail Supporting Reported Numbers
The second category of notes provides supplemental information concerning the data shown on 
the financial statements. Among other information, these notes may show revenues broken out 
by geographic region or business segment, describe unusual transactions, and/or offer expanded 
detail on a specific classification. For example, in Note 3, Apple indicates the makeup of prop-
erty, plant, and equipment presented on the balance sheet.
Relevant Financial Information Not Disclosed on the Statements
The final category includes information that impacts the company financially but is not shown 
on the statements. Examples include information on legal matters and contractual agreements 
that do not result in an asset or liability on the balance sheet. In Note 10, Apple disclosed the 
details of its commitments under supply agreements, which total over $27 billion and are not 
shown as a liability on the balance sheet.

Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-
line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 
years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between two to five years for machinery and 
equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of 
lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements.

Voluntary Disclosures
GAAP and SEC regulations set only the minimum level of required financial disclosures. Many 
companies provide important disclosures beyond those required. For example, in its annual 
report, 10-K, and recent earnings press release, Apple discloses sales by major product cat-
egory, which helps investors track the success of new products.
Financial accounting standards and disclosure requirements are adopted by national regulatory agencies. 
Many countries, including the members of the European Union, have adopted International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). IFRS are 
similar to U.S. GAAP, but there are several important differences. A partial list of the differences at the

Evaluating company performance is the primary goal of financial statement analysis. Company 
managers, as well as competitors, use financial statements to better understand and evaluate 
a company’s business strategy. Analysts, investors, and creditors use these same statements 
to judge company performance when they estimate the value of the company’s stock and its 
creditworthiness. Our discussion of the financial data contained in accounting reports has now 
reached the point where we can develop an overall framework for using those data to evaluate 
company performance. The most general framework for evaluating company performance is 
called return on assets (ROA) analysis.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE 5-4
Analyze a company’s 
performance based on return on 
assets and its components and 
the effects of transactions on

ROA Profit Driver Analysis and Business Strategy
Effective analysis of Apple’s performance also requires understanding why its ROA differs 
both from prior levels and from those of its competitors. ROA profit driver analysis (also called 
ROA decomposition or DuPont analysis) breaks down ROA into the two factors shown in 
Exhibit 5.8. These factors are often called profit drivers or profit levers because they describe 
the two ways that management can improve ROA. They are measured by the key ratios you 
learned in Chapters 3 and 4.
 
1. Net profit margin = Net Income ÷ Net Sales. It measures how much of every sales dollar 
is profit. It can be increased by
a. Increasing sales volume.
b. Increasing sales price.
c. Decreasing cost of goods sold and operating expenses.
 
2. Total asset turnover = Net Sales ÷ Average Total Assets. It measures how many sales 
dollars the company generates with each dollar of assets (efficiency of use of assets). It can 
be increased by
a. Centralizing distribution to reduce inventory kept on hand.
b. Consolidating production facilities in fewer factories to reduce the amount of assets nec-
essary to generate each dollar of sales.

INTERPRETATIONS
In General ROA measures how much the firm earned for each dollar of investment in assets. It is 
the broadest measure of profitability and management effectiveness, independent of financing strategy. 
Firms with higher ROA are doing a better job of selecting and managing investments, all other things 
equal. Since it is independent of the source of financing (debt vs. equity), it can be used to evaluate per-
formance at any level within the organization. It is often computed on a division-by-division or product 
line basis and used to evaluate division or product line managers’ relative performance.
Focus Company Analysis The decrease in return on assets between 2012 and 2014 was mainly due 
to an increase in average assets accompanied by consistent net income. Specifically, marketable securi-
ties have increased dramatically over the last three years. As a result, Apple has increased dividends and 
continued a stock buyback program to return the excess assets to shareholders.
A Few Cautions Like all ratios, the key to interpreting change is to dig deeper to understand the reason 
for each change. Our next topic, ROA Profit Driver Analysis and Business Strategy, is aimed at doing 
just that.
*In more complex return on assets analyses, interest expense (net of tax) and noncontrolling interest are added back 
to net income in the numerator of the ratio, since the measure assesses return on capital independent of its source.
† Average Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) ÷ 2.

These two ratios report on the effectiveness of the company’s operating and investing activities, 
respectively.
Successful manufacturers often follow one of two business strategies. The first is a 
high-value or product-differentiation strategy. Companies following this strategy rely on 
research and development and product promotion to convince customers of the superiority 
or distinctiveness of their products. This allows the company to charge higher prices and 
earn a higher net profit margin. The second is a low-cost strategy, which relies on efficient 
management of accounts receivable, inventory, and productive assets to produce high asset 
turnover.
The ROA profit driver analysis presented in Exhibit 5.9 indicates the sources of Apple’s 
ROA and compares them to the same figures for HP. Apple follows a classic high-value 
strategy, developing a reputation for the most innovative products in its markets. The suc-
cess of this strategy is evident in its market-leading net profit margin of 0.216 or 21.6%. 
This means that 21.6 cents of every sales dollar is net profit. This compares with HP’s 4.5% 
net profit margin.
HP primarily follows a low-cost strategy by offering excellent products and service at com-
petitive prices. The efficiency of HP’s operations is evident in its higher total asset turnover 
of 1.067 compared to Apple’s 0.883. Apple has produced a much higher ROA than HP because 
its phenomenal net profit margin more than offsets its lower total asset turnover, and its stock 
price has responded accordingly.
If Apple follows the same strategy it has in the past, the secret to maintaining its ROA must 
be continued product development to support premium selling prices. In 2014, Apple made 
major strides in new product development and the success of its new product introductions 
bodes well for a high ROA in the longer term. As the preceding discussion indicates, a com-
pany can take many different actions to try to affect its profit drivers. To understand the impact 
of these actions, financial analysts disaggregate each of the profit drivers into more detailed 
ratios. For example, the total asset turnover ratio is further disaggregated into turnover ratios 
for specific assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets. We will develop our 
understanding of these more specific ratios in the next seven chapters of the book. Then, in 
Chapter 13, we will combine the ratios in a comprehensive review.
How Transactions Affect Ratios
Apple and other companies know that investors and creditors follow their key financial ratios 
closely. Changes in ROA and its components can have a major effect on a company’s stock 
price and interest rates that lenders charge. As a consequence, company managers closely fol-
low the effects of their actual and planned transactions on these same key financial ratios. 
We have already learned how to determine the effects of transactions on key subtotals on the 
income statement and balance sheet (gross profit, current assets, etc.). So we are only one step 
away from being able to compute the effects of transactions on ratios. The following three-step 
process will help you do so:
 
1. Journalize the transaction to determine its effects on various accounts, just as we did in 
Chapters 2 through 4.
 
2. Determine which accounts belong to the financial statement subtotals or totals in 
the numerator (top) and denominator (bottom) of the ratio and the direction of their 
effects.
 
3. Evaluate the combined effects from step 2 on the ratio.

Let’s try a few examples to get a feel for the process. What would be the effect of the fol-
lowing transactions on the following ratios (ignoring taxes)? The examples we will consider 
illustrate that the effect depends on what part of the ratio, numerator (top) and/or denominator 
(bottom), is affected. We need to consider three cases.
What if only the numerator or denominator is affected?
Example 1: Apple incurred an additional $1,000 in research and development expense paid 
for in cash (all numbers in millions). What would be the effect on the net profit margin ratio? 
The entry would be:
Research and development expense  (+E, -SE) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
1,000
  Cash (-A)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
1,000
Note that the transaction would decrease the numerator Net Income and have no effect on 
the denominator Net Sales. The ratio was 0.216 (using numbers from Exhibit 5.5). It would 
decrease to 0.211 as follows.
Net Income
÷
Net Sales
=
Net Profit Margin
As reported:
$39,510
÷
$182,795
=
0.216
Transaction effect:
-1,000
    + – +++      
After transaction:
$38,510
÷
$182,795
=
0.211
This example illustrates a general point about the effect of transactions on ratios. If a transac-
tion only affects the numerator or denominator of the ratio, it will have the following effects 
on the ratio:

What if both the numerator and denominator are affected  
but by different amounts?
Example 2: Consider the same transaction as in Example 1. What would be the effect on the 
return on assets ratio? Note that the transaction would decrease the numerator Net Income by 
$1,000. It would also decrease the ending total assets by $1,000 but have no effect on begin-
ning total assets. So the denominator, average total assets, would only decrease by $500:
Avg. Total Assets = ($207,000 + $231,839 - $1,000) ÷ 2 = $218,920
The ratio was 0.180 in Exhibit 5.9. It would decrease as follows:
Net Income
÷
Avg.  
Total Assets
=
Return on 
Assets
As reported:
$39,510
÷
$219,420
=
0.180
Transaction effect:
-1,000
        -500
After transaction:
$38,510
÷
$218,920
=
0.176
This example illustrates a second general point about the effect of transactions on ratios. If a 
transaction affects the numerator by more than it affects the denominator, or if it affects the 
denominator by more than it affects the numerator, you must compute the effect with the num-
bers given.

C HAP TER  5   Communicating and Interpreting Accounting Information
What if the numerator and denominator are affected by the same amount?
Example 3: Apple paid $4,000 of accounts payable in cash (all numbers in millions). What 
would be the effect on the current ratio? The entry would be:
Accounts payable (-L)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
4,000
  Cash (-A)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
4,000
Note that the transaction would decrease the numerator, Current Assets, and the denominator, 
Current Liabilities, by the same amount. The ratio was 1.08 (using numbers from Exhibit 5.4). 
It would increase as follows.
Current Assets
÷
Current Liabilities
=
Current Ratio
As reported:
$68,531
÷
$63,448
=
1.08
Transaction effect:
-4,000
-4,000
After transaction:
$64,531
÷
$59,448
=
1.09
This example illustrates a third general point about the effect of transactions on ratios. If a 
transaction affects the numerator and denominator of the ratio by the same amount, the 
effect will depend on whether the original ratio value was greater or less than 1.00:

ROA measures how well management used the company’s invested capital during the period. Its two 
determinants, net profit margin and asset turnover, indicate why ROA differs from prior levels or the 
ROAs of competitors. They also suggest strategies to improve ROA in future periods. The effect of an 
individual transaction on a financial ratio depends on its effects on both the numerator and denomina-
tor of the ratio.

1. We used profit driver analysis in Exhibit 5.9 to explain why a company has an ROA different 
from its competitors at a single point in time. This type of analysis is called cross-sectional 
analysis. Profit driver analysis can also be used to explain how changes in net profit margin 
(Net Income/Net Sales) and total asset turnover (Net Sales/Average Total Assets) changed 
Apple’s ROA over time. This type of analysis is often called time-series analysis. Follow-
ing is the recent year’s ROA analysis for Apple Inc. Using profit driver analysis, explain how 
Apple has increased its ROA.

For the year ended June 30, Microsoft earned an ROA of 14 percent. Microsoft maintains high 
profit margins, earning $0.25 of net income for every $1 of net sales, but the company has a lower 
asset efficiency with only $0.55 in sales generated for each $1 of assets. The analysis also indicates 
Microsoft’s dominance of the computer software business, which allows the company to charge pre-

5-1. Recognize the people involved in the accounting communication process (regulators, manag-
ers, directors, auditors, information intermediaries, and users), their roles in the process, and 
the guidance they receive from legal and professional standards.  p. 233
Management of the reporting company must decide on the appropriate format (categories) and 
level of detail to present in its financial reports. Independent audits increase the credibility of the 
information. Directors monitor managers’ compliance with reporting standards and hire the auditor. 
Financial statement announcements from public companies usually are first transmitted to users 
through electronic information services. The SEC staff reviews public financial reports for com-
pliance with legal and professional standards, investigates irregularities, and punishes violators. 
Analysts play a major role in making financial statement and other information available to average 
investors through their stock recommendations and earnings forecasts.
 
5-2. Identify the steps in the accounting communication process, including the issuance of press 
releases, annual reports, quarterly reports, and SEC filings, as well as the role of electronic 
information services in this process.  p. 238
Earnings are first made public in press releases. Companies follow these announcements with 
annual and quarterly reports containing statements, notes, and additional information. Public com-
panies must file additional reports with the SEC, including the 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, which contain 
more details about the company. Electronic information services are the key source of dissemina-
tion of this information to sophisticated users.
 
5-3. Recognize and apply the different financial statement and disclosure formats used by compa-
nies in practice and analyze the gross profit percentage.  p. 240
Most statements are classified and include subtotals that are relevant to analysis. On the balance 
sheet, the most important distinctions are between current and noncurrent assets and liabilities. On 
the income and cash flow statements, the distinction between operating and nonoperating items is 
most important. The notes to the statements provide descriptions of the accounting rules applied, 
add more information about items disclosed on the statements, and present information about eco-
nomic events not included in the statements.
 
5-4. Analyze a company’s performance based on return on assets and its components and the 
effects of transactions on financial ratios.  p. 250
ROA measures how well management used the company’s invested capital during the period. Its 
two determinants, net profit margin and asset turnover, indicate why ROA differs from prior levels 
or the ROAs of competitors. They also suggest strategies to improve ROA in future periods. The 
effect of an individual transaction on a financial ratio depends on its effects on both the numerator 
and denominator of the ratio.
In Chapter 6, we will begin our in-depth discussion of individual items presented in financial state-
ments. We will start with two of the most liquid assets, cash and accounts receivable, and transactions 
that involve revenues and certain selling expenses. Accuracy in revenue recognition and the related 
recognition of cost of goods sold (discussed in Chapter 7) are the most important determinants of the 
accuracy—and, thus, the usefulness—of financial statements. We will also introduce concepts related to 
the management and control of cash and receivables, a critical business function. A detailed understand-
ing of these topics is crucial to future managers, accountants, and financial analysts.

Following is a sample explanation of the first error:
Failure to record depreciation in 2013 caused depreciation expense to be too low; therefore, income was 
overstated by $950. Accumulated depreciation also is too low by $950, which causes assets to be over-
stated by $950 until the error is corrected.
Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma: Management Incentives and Fraudulent Financial Statements   
Netherlands-based Royal Ahold ranks among the world’s three largest food retailers. In the United States 
it operates the Stop & Shop and Giant supermarket chains. Dutch and U.S regulators and prosecutors 
have brought criminal and civil charges against the company and its executives for overstating earnings 
by more than $1 billion. The nature of the fraud is described in the following excerpt:
Two Former Execs of Ahold Subsidiary Plead Not Guilty to Fraud
NEW YORK (AP)—Two former executives pleaded not guilty Wednesday to devising a 
scheme to inflate the earnings of U.S. Foodservice Inc., a subsidiary of Dutch supermarket 
giant Royal Ahold NV. Former chief financial officer Michael Resnick and former chief 
marketing officer Mark Kaiser entered their pleas in a Manhattan federal court, a day after 
prosecutors announced fraud and conspiracy charges against them.
The government contends they worked together to boost the company’s earnings by $800 
million from 2000 to 2003 by reporting fake rebates from suppliers—and sweetened their 
own bonuses in the process. Two other defendants have already pleaded guilty in the alleged 
scheme: Timothy Lee, a former executive vice president, and William Carter, a former vice 
president. Both are set for sentencing in January. Netherlands-based Ahold’s U.S. properties 
include the Stop & Shop and Giant supermarket chains. U.S. Foodservice is one of the larg-
est distributors of food products in the country, providing to restaurants and cafeterias.
Ahold said last year it had overstated its earnings by more than $1 billion, mostly because 
of the fraud at U.S. Foodservice. Its stock lost 60 percent of its value, and about $6 billion 
in market value evaporated.

Brands is best known for its Teva® sports sandals and the UGG® brand sheepskin boots. 
 
Deckers has become a major player in the casual, outdoor, and athletic footwear market 
by building on the needs of hikers, trail runners, kayakers, surfers, and whitewater rafters 
for comfort, function, and performance. Its growth strategy requires building brand recogni-
tion by developing and introducing additional innovative footwear that satisfies the company’s 
high standards. Building the brands allows Deckers to maintain a loyal consumer following 
and penetrate new markets. It also has allowed Deckers to continue to grow during the worst 
recession in more than 25 years.
There is a second key component to Deckers’s successful growth strategy. Success in the 
ultracompetitive footwear market requires careful matching of production schedules to cus-
tomers’ needs and careful management of customer receivables. Deckers’s successful focus 
on brand development, product innovation, and working capital management has allowed the 
company to report the highest gross profit in its history.
U ND E RSTAN DI N G  T H E  B USI N E SS
Planning Deckers’s growth strategy requires careful coordination of sales activities, as 
well as cash collections from customers. Much of this coordination revolves around allow-
ing consumers to use credit cards, providing business customers discounts for early pay-
ment, and allowing sales returns and allowances under certain circumstances—strategies 
that motivate customers to buy its products and make payment for their purchases. These 


chapter 6
activities affect net sales revenue, the top line on the income statement. 
Coordinating sales and cash collections from customers also involves man-
aging bad debts, which affect selling, general, and administrative expenses 
on the income statement and cash and accounts  
receivable on the bal-
ance sheet. Net sales, accounts receivable, and cash are the focus of this 
chapter. We will also introduce the receivables turnover ratio as a measure 
of the  
efficiency of credit-granting and collection activities. Finally, since 
the cash collected from customers is also a tempting target for fraud and 
 
embezzlement, we will discuss how accounting systems commonly include 
controls to prevent and detect such misdeeds.

As indicated in Chapter 3, the revenue recognition principle requires that revenues be 
recorded when the company transfers goods and services to customers, in the amount it expects 
to receive. For sellers of goods, sales revenue is recorded when title and risks of ownership 
transfer to the buyer.1 The point at which title (ownership) changes hands is determined by the 
shipping terms in the sales contract. When goods are shipped FOB (free on board) shipping 
point, title changes hands at shipment, and the buyer normally pays for shipping. When they 
are shipped FOB destination, title changes hands on delivery, and the seller normally pays for 
shipping. Revenues from goods shipped FOB shipping point are normally recognized at ship-
ment. Revenues from goods shipped FOB destination are normally recognized at delivery.
Service companies most often record sales revenue when they have provided services to the 
buyer. Companies disclose the revenue recognition rule they follow in the footnote to the finan-
cial statements entitled Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. In that note,  
Deckers 
reports the following:

 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes wholesale, eCommerce, and international distributor revenue 
when products are shipped and retail revenue at the point of sale. All sales are recognized 
when the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss, collection of the related receivable is 
reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, and the sales price is fixed or 
determinable.

Motivating Sales and Collections
Some sales practices differ depending on whether sales are made to businesses or consumers. 
Deckers sells footwear and apparel to other businesses (retailers), including Athlete’s Foot 
and Eastern Mountain Sports, which then sell the goods to consumers. It also operates its own 
Internet and retail stores that sell footwear directly to consumers.
Deckers uses a variety of methods to motivate both groups of customers to buy its products 
and make payment for their purchases. The principal methods include (1) allowing consum-
ers to use credit cards to pay for purchases, (2) providing business customers direct credit and 
discounts for early payment, and (3) allowing returns from all customers under certain circum-
stances. These methods, in turn, affect the way we compute net sales revenue.
Credit Card Sales to Consumers
Deckers accepts cash or credit card payment for its retail store and Internet sales. Deckers’s 
managers decided to accept credit cards (mainly Visa, Mastercard, and American Express) for 
a variety of reasons:
 
1. Increasing customer traffic.
 
2. Avoiding the costs of providing credit directly to consumers, including recordkeeping and 
bad debts (discussed later).
 
3. Lowering losses due to bad checks.
 
4. Avoiding losses from fraudulent credit card sales. (As long as Deckers follows the credit card 
company’s verification procedure, the credit card company [e.g., Visa] absorbs any losses.)
 
5. Receiving money faster. (Since credit card receipts can be directly deposited in its bank account, 
Deckers receives its money faster than it would if it provided credit directly to consumers.)
The credit card company charges a fee for the service it provides. When Deckers deposits 
its credit card receipts in the bank, it might receive credit for only 97 percent of the sales price. 
The credit card company is charging a 3 percent fee (the credit card discount) for its services. 
If daily credit card sales were $3,000, Deckers would report the following:

Some companies report credit card discounts as part of selling, general, and administrative 
expenses.
Sales Discounts to Businesses
Most of Deckers’s sales to businesses are credit sales on open account; that is, there is no 
 
formal written promissory note or credit card. When Deckers sells footwear to retailers on 
credit, credit terms are printed on the sales document and invoice (bill) sent to the customer.

C HAP TER  6   Reporting and Interpreting Sales Revenue, Receivables, and Cash
Often credit terms are abbreviated. For example, if the full price is due within 30 days of the 
invoice date, the credit terms would be noted as n/30. Here, the n means the sales amount net 
of, or less, any sales returns.
In some cases, a sales discount (often called a cash discount) is granted to the purchaser to 
encourage early payment.2 For example, Deckers may offer terms of 2/10, n/30, which means 
that the customer may deduct 2 percent from the invoice price if cash payment is made within 
10 days from the date of sale. If cash payment is not made within the 10-day discount period, 
the full sales price (less any returns) is due within a maximum of 30 days.
Deckers offers this sales discount to encourage customers to pay more quickly. This provides 
two benefits to Deckers:
 
1. Prompt receipt of cash from customers reduces the necessity to borrow money to meet oper-
ating needs.
 
2. Since customers tend to pay bills providing discounts first, a sales discount also decreases 
the chances that the customer will run out of funds before Deckers’s bill is paid.
Companies commonly record sales discounts taken by subtracting the discount from sales 
if payment is made within the discount period (the usual case).3 For example, if credit sales 
of $1,000 are recorded with terms 2/10, n/30 and payment of $980 ($1,000 × 0.98 = $980) is 
made within the discount period, net sales of the following amount would be reported:
SALES (OR CASH) 
 
DISCOUNT
Cash discount offered to 
 
encourage prompt payment of 
an account receivable.
2It is important not to confuse a cash discount with a trade discount. Vendors sometimes use a trade discount for 
quoting sales prices; the sales price is the list or printed catalog price less the trade discount.
3We use the gross method in all examples in this text. Some companies use the alternative net method, which 
records sales revenue after deducting the amount of the cash discount. Because the choice of method has little effect 
on the financial statements, discussion of this method is left for an advanced course.
Sales revenue
$1,000
Less: Sales discounts (0.02 × $1,000)
  &&& 20
Net sales (reported on the income statement)
$   980
If payment is made after the discount period, the full $1,000 would be reported as net sales. 
Accounting for sales discounts is discussed in more detail in the Supplement at the end of this 
chapter.
Customers usually pay within the discount period because the savings are substantial. With terms 2/10, 
n/30, customers save 2 percent by paying 20 days early (on the 10th day instead of the 30th). This trans-
lates into a 37 percent annual interest rate. To calculate the annual interest rate, first compute the interest 
rate for the discount period. When the 2 percent discount is taken, the customer pays only 98 percent 
of the gross sales price. For example, on a $100 sale with terms 2/10, n/30, $2 would be saved and $98 
would be paid 20 days early.
The interest rate for the 20-day discount period and the annual interest rate are computed as follows:
As long as the bank’s interest rate is less than the interest rate associated with failing to take cash dis-
counts, the customer will save by taking the cash discount. For example, even if credit customers had to 
borrow from the bank at a rate as high as 15 percent, they would save a great deal.

Sales Returns and Allowances
Retailers and consumers have a right to return unsatisfactory or damaged merchandise and 
receive a refund or an adjustment to their bill. Such returns are often accumulated in a separate 
account called Sales Returns and Allowances and must be deducted from gross sales revenue 
in determining net sales. This account informs Deckers’s managers of the volume of returns and 
allowances and thus provides an important measure of the quality of customer service. Assume 
that Fontana’s Shoes of Ithaca, New York, buys 40 pairs of sandals (at $50 each) from Deckers 
for $2,000 on account. Before paying for the sandals, Fontana’s discovers that 10 pairs of sandals 
are not the color ordered and returns them to Deckers.4 Deckers computes net sales as follows:
SALES RETURNS AND 
 
ALLOWANCES 
A reduction of sales revenues 
for return of or allowances for 
unsatisfactory goods.
Sales revenue
$2,000
Less: Sales returns and allowances (10 × $50)
  500
Net sales (reported on the income statement)
$1,500
4Alternatively, Deckers might offer Fontana’s a $200 allowance to keep the wrong-color sandals. If Fontana’s 
accepts the offer, Deckers reports $200 as sales returns and allowances.
Cost of goods sold related to the 10 pairs of sandals would also be reduced.
Reporting Net Sales
On the company’s books, credit card discounts, sales discounts, and sales returns and allow-
ances are accounted for separately to allow managers to monitor the costs of credit card use, 
sales discounts, and returns. Using the numbers in the preceding examples, the amount of net 
sales reported on the income statement is computed in the following manner:
Sales revenue
$6,000
Less: Credit card discounts (a contra-revenue)
90
 Sales discounts (a contra-revenue)

 Sales returns and allowances (a contra-revenue)

Exhibit 6.1. Deckers indicates in its revenue recognition footnote that the appropriate subtrac-
tions are made.

In 2013, Deckers disclosed that it provided its customers with $47,285,000 in sales  
discounts 
based on meeting certain order, shipment, and payment timelines.
In the last section, we learned to analyze the impact of credit card sales, sales discounts, and sales 
returns, all of which reduce the amounts reported as net sales. Both credit card discounts and sales 
or cash discounts promote faster receipt of cash. Sales returns and allowances include refunds and 
adjustments to customers’ bills for defective or incorrect merchandise.
Before you move on, complete the following questions to test your understanding of these 
concepts.

1. Assume that Deckers sold $30,000 worth of footwear to various retailers with terms 1/10, 
n/30 and half of that amount was paid within the discount period. Gross catalog and Internet 
sales were $5,000 for the same period; 80 percent of these sales were paid for with credit 
cards with a 3 percent discount and the rest were paid for with cash. Compute net sales for 
the period.
   
   
 
2. During the first quarter of 2013, Deckers’s net sales totaled $263,760, and cost of sales was 
$140,201. What was Deckers’s gross profit for the first quarter of 2013?

Classifying Receivables
Receivables may be classified in three common ways. First, they may be classified as either 
an account receivable or a note receivable. An account receivable is created by a credit 
sale on an open account. For example, an account receivable is created when Deckers sells 
shoes on open account to Fontana’s Shoes in Ithaca, New York. A note receivable is a 
promise in writing (a formal document) to pay (1) a specified amount of money, called the 
principal, at a definite future date known as the maturity date and (2) a specified amount 
of interest at one or more future dates. The interest is the amount charged for use of the 
principal.
Second, receivables may be classified as trade or nontrade receivables. A trade receivable 
is created in the normal course of business when a sale of merchandise or services on credit 
occurs. A nontrade receivable arises from transactions other than the normal sale of merchan-
dise or services. For example, if Deckers loaned money to a new vice president to help finance 
a home at the new job location, the loan would be classified as a nontrade receivable. Third, 
in a classified balance sheet, receivables also are classified as either current or noncurrent 
(short term or long term), depending on when the cash is expected to be collected. Like many 
companies, Deckers reports only one type of receivable account, Trade Accounts Receivable, 
from customers and classifies the asset as a current asset because the accounts receivable are 
all due to be paid within one year.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 
(TRADE RECEIVABLES, 
RECEIVABLES)
Open accounts owed to the 
business by trade customers.
NOTES RECEIVABLE
Written promises that require 
another party to pay the business 
under specified conditions 
(amount, time, interest).
Accounting for Bad Debts
For billing and collection purposes, Deckers keeps a separate accounts receivable account for 
each retailer that resells its footwear and apparel (called a subsidiary account). The accounts 
receivable amount on the balance sheet represents the total of these individual customer 
accounts.
When Deckers extends credit to its commercial customers, it knows that some of these 
 
customers will not pay their debts. The expense recognition principle requires recording of bad 
debt expense in the same accounting period in which the related sales are made. This presents 
an important accounting problem. Deckers may not learn which particular customers will not 
pay until the next accounting period. So, at the end of the period of sale, it normally does not 
know which customers’ accounts receivable are bad debts.

Export (international) sales are a growing part of the U.S. econ-
omy. For example, international sales amounted to 33.0 percent of 
Deckers’s revenues in 2013. Most export sales to businesses are on 
credit. When a buyer agrees to pay in its local currency, Deckers 
cannot add the resulting accounts receivable, which are denomi-
nated in foreign currency, directly to its U.S. dollar accounts 
receivable. Deckers’s accountants must first convert them to U.S. 
dollars using the end-of-period exchange rate between the two cur-
rencies. For example, if a French department store owed Deckers 
€20,000 (euros, the common currency of the European Monetary 
Union) on December 31, 2014, and each euro was worth US$1.20 
on that date, it would add US$24,000 to its accounts receivable on 
the balance sheet.

Deckers resolves this problem by using the allowance method to measure bad debt expense. 
The allowance method is based on estimates of the expected amount of bad debts. Two pri-
mary steps in employing the allowance method are:
 
1. Making the end-of-period adjusting entry to record estimated bad debt expense.
 
2. Writing off specific accounts determined to be uncollectible during the period.
Recording Bad Debt Expense Estimates
Bad debt expense (doubtful accounts expense, uncollectible accounts expense, provision for 
uncollectible accounts) is the expense associated with estimated uncollectible accounts receiv-
able. An adjusting journal entry at the end of the accounting period records the bad debt 
estimate. For the year ended December 31, 2013, Deckers estimated bad debt expense to be 
$115,101 (all numbers in thousands of dollars) and made the following adjusting entry:
Bad debt expense (+E, -SE) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The Bad Debt Expense is included in the category “Selling” expenses on the income state-
ment. It decreases net income and stockholders’ equity. Accounts Receivable could not be cred-
ited in the journal entry because there is no way to know which customers’ accounts receivable 
are involved. So the credit is made, instead, to a contra-asset account called Allowance for 
Doubtful Accounts (Allowance for Bad Debts or Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts). As 
a contra-asset, the balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is always subtracted from the 
balance of the asset Accounts Receivable. Thus, the entry decreases the net book value of 
Accounts Receivable and total assets.
Writing Off Specific Uncollectible Accounts
Throughout the year, when it is determined that a customer will not pay its debts (e.g., due 
to bankruptcy), the write-off of that individual bad debt is recorded through a journal entry. 
Now that the specific uncollectible customer account receivable has been identified, it can be 
removed with a credit. At the same time, we no longer need the related estimate in the contra-
asset Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, which is removed by a debit. The journal entry sum-
marizing Deckers’s total write-offs of $115,119 during 2013 follows:
Allowance for doubtful accounts (-XA, +A) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Notice that this journal entry did not affect any income statement accounts. It did not 
record a bad debt expense because the estimated expense was recorded with an adjusting 
entry in the period of sale. Also, the entry did not change the net book value of accounts 
 
receivable since the decrease in the asset account (Accounts Receivable) was offset by the 
decrease in the contra-asset account (Allowance for Doubtful Accounts). Thus, it also did not 
affect total assets.

Summary of the Accounting Process
It is important to remember that accounting for bad debts is a two-step process:
Bad Debt Recoveries
When a company receives a payment on an account that has already been written off, the journal entry 
to write off the account is reversed to put the receivable back on the books, and the collection of cash 
is recorded. For example, if the previously written-off amount was $677, it would make the following 
entries:
Accounts receivable (+A) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

 Allowance for doubtful accounts (+XA, -A) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Note that these entries, like the original write-off, do not affect total assets or net income. Only the 
 
estimate of bad debts affects these amounts.

Accounts Receivable (Gross) includes the total accounts receivable, both collectible and 
uncollectible. The balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is the portion of the 
accounts receivable balance the company estimates to be uncollectible. Accounts Receivable 
(Net) reported on the balance sheet is the portion of the accounts the company expects to col-
lect (or its estimated net realizable value).
Reporting Accounts Receivable and Bad Debts
Analysts who want information on Deckers’s receivables will find Accounts Receivable, net 
of allowance for doubtful accounts (the net book value), of $184,013 and $190,756 for 2013 
and 2012, respectively, reported on the balance sheet (Exhibit 6.2). Deckers reports the balance 
in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ($25,068 in 2013 and $25,086 in 2012) within the 
account title. Other companies report the balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts in a 
note. Accounts Receivable (Gross), the total accounts receivable, can be computed by adding 
the two amounts together.
The amounts of bad debt expense and accounts receivable written off for the period, if mate-
rial, are reported on a schedule that publicly traded companies must include in their Annual 
Report Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Exhibit 6.3 presents this schedule from Deckers’s

Estimating Bad Debts
The bad debt expense amount recorded in the end-of-period adjusting entry often is estimated 
based on either (1) a percentage of total credit sales for the period or (2) an aging of accounts 
receivable. Both methods are acceptable under GAAP and are widely used. The percentage of 
credit sales method is simpler to apply, but the aging method is generally more accurate. Many 
companies use the simpler method on a weekly or monthly basis and use the more accurate 
method on a monthly or quarterly basis to check the accuracy of the earlier estimates. In our 
example, both methods produce exactly the same estimate, which rarely occurs in practice.
Percentage of Credit Sales Method
The percentage of credit sales method bases bad debt expense on the historical percentage 
of credit sales that result in bad debts. The average percentage of credit sales that result in bad 
debts can be computed by dividing total bad debt losses by total credit sales. A company that 
has been operating for some years has sufficient experience to project probable future bad debt

When receivables are material, companies must employ the allowance method to account for uncol-
lectibles. These are the steps in the process:
 
a. The end-of-period adjusting entry to record the estimate of bad debt expense and increase the 
allowance for doubtful accounts.
 
b. Writing off specific accounts determined to be uncollectible during the period to eliminate the 
specific uncollectible account receivable and decrease the allowance for doubtful accounts.
The adjusting entry reduces net income as well as net accounts receivable. The write-off affects 
neither. Before you move on, complete the following questions to test your understanding of these 
concepts.

losses. For example, if we assume that, during the year 2014, Deckers expected bad debt losses 
of 1.0 percent of credit sales, and its credit sales were $1,500,000, it would estimate the current 
year’s bad debts as:
 Credit sales
$1,500,000
× Bad debt loss rate (1.0%)
 && × 0.01
 Bad debt expense
$ &&&15,000
This amount would be directly recorded as Bad Debt Expense (and an increase in Allowance for 
Doubtful Accounts) in the current year. Our beginning balance in the Allowance for  
Doubtful 
Accounts for 2014 would be the ending balance for 2013. Assuming write-offs during 2014 of 
$17,068, the ending balance is computed as follows:

? = 23,000
Aging of Accounts Receivable
The aging of accounts receivable method relies on the fact that, as accounts receivable 
become older and more overdue, it is less likely that they will be collected. For example, a 
receivable that was due in 30 days but has not been paid after 120 days is less likely to be col-
lected, on average, than a similar receivable that remains unpaid after 45 days.
If Deckers split its assumed 2014 ending balance in accounts receivable (gross) of $230,000 
into three age categories, it would first examine the individual customer accounts receivable 
and sort them into the three age categories. Based on prior experience, management would 
then estimate the probable bad debt loss rates for each category: for example, not yet due, 
 
2 percent; 1 to 90 days past due, 10 percent; over 90 days, 30 percent.
As illustrated in the aging schedule below, this would result in an estimate of total uncollect-
ible amounts of $23,000, the estimated ending balance that should be in the Allowance for 
Doubtful Accounts. From this, the adjustment to record Bad Debt Expense (and an increase in 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts) for 2014 would be computed as follows:

Comparison of the Two Methods
It is important to recognize that the approach to recording bad debt expense using the 
percentage of credit sales method is different from that for the aging method:

 Percentage of credit sales. Directly compute the amount to be recorded as Bad Debt 
Expense on the income statement for the period in the adjusting journal entry.

 Aging of Accounts Receivable. Compute the estimated ending balance we would like to 
have in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts on the balance sheet after we make the nec-
essary adjusting entry. The difference between the current balance in the account and the 
estimated balance is recorded as the adjusting entry for Bad Debt Expense for the period.
In either case, the balance sheet presentation for 2014 would show Accounts Receivable, less 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, of $207,000 ($230,000 - $23,000).
Actual Write-Offs Compared with Estimates
Deckers’s Form 10-K provides particularly clear information on its approach to estimating 
uncollectible accounts and the potential effect of any errors in those estimates:
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We provide a reserve against trade accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result 
from customers’ inability to pay. We determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known 
uncollectible accounts, aged trade accounts receivables, economic conditions and forecasts, 
historical experience and the customers’ credit-worthiness. . . . Our use of different estimates 
and assumptions could produce different financial results. For example, a 1.0 percent change 
in the rate used to estimate the reserve for the accounts we consider to have credit risk and not 
specifically identified as uncollectible would change the allowance for doubtful accounts at 
December 31, 2013, by approximately $1,000.
REAL WORLD EXCERPT:
Form 10-K
DECKERS BRANDS
If uncollectible accounts actually written off differ from the estimated amount previously 
recorded, a higher or lower amount is recorded in the next period to make up for the previous 
period’s error in estimate. When estimates are found to be incorrect, financial statement 
values for prior annual accounting periods are not corrected.
Control over Accounts Receivable
Many managers forget that extending credit will increase sales volume, but unless the related 
receivables are collected, they do not add to the bottom line. Companies that emphasize sales 
without monitoring the collection of credit sales soon find much of their current assets tied up 
in accounts receivable. The following practices can help minimize bad debts:
 
1. Require approval of customers’ credit history by a person independent of the sales and col-
lections functions.
 
2. Age accounts receivable periodically and contact customers with overdue payments.
 
3. Reward both sales and collections personnel for speedy collections so that they work as a 
team.
To assess the effectiveness of overall credit-granting and collection activities, managers and 
analysts often compute the receivables turnover ratio.

 = 8.3
$1,556,618

INTERPRETATIONS
In General The receivables turnover ratio reflects how many times average trade receivables are 
recorded and collected during the period. The higher the ratio, the faster the collection of receivables. 
A higher ratio benefits the company because it can invest the money collected to earn interest income 
or reduce borrowings to reduce interest expense. Overly generous payment schedules and ineffective 
collection methods keep the receivables turnover ratio low. Analysts and creditors watch this ratio 
because a sudden decline may mean that a company is extending payment deadlines in an attempt to 
prop up lagging sales or is even recording sales that will later be returned by customers. Many man-
agers and analysts compute the related number average collection period or average days sales in 
receivables, which is equal to 365 ÷ Receivables Turnover Ratio. It indicates the average time it takes 
a customer to pay its accounts. For Deckers, the amount would be computed as follows for 2013:
Average Collection Period = 
365
Receivables Turnover
365
8.3
=
= 44.0 days
Focus Company Analysis Deckers’s receivables turnover increased from a 2011 high of 8.9 to 8.3 
in 2013. This indicates that the company is taking more time to convert its receivables into cash. Com-
pared to the receivables turnover ratios of its competitors, Deckers’s ratio is below those of  
Skechers 
 
and Crocs.
A Few Cautions Since differences across industries and between firms in the manner in which 
 
customer purchases are financed can cause dramatic differences in the ratio, a particular firm’s ratio 
should be compared only with its prior years’ figures or with other firms in the same industry following 
the same financing practices.

The change in accounts receivable can be a major determinant of a company’s cash flow from operations. 
While the income statement reflects the revenues of the period, the cash flow from operating activi-
ties reflects cash collections from customers. Since sales on account increase the balance in accounts 
receivable and cash collections from customers decrease the balance in accounts receivable, the change 
in accounts receivable from the beginning to the end of the period is the difference between sales and 
collections.
EFFECT ON STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
In General When there is a net decrease in accounts receivable for the period, cash collected from 
customers is more than revenue; thus, the decrease must be added in computing cash flows from opera-
tions. When a net increase in accounts receivable occurs, cash collected from customers is less than 
revenue; thus, the increase must be subtracted in computing cash flows from operations.*

Focus Company Analysis The excerpt below shows the Operating Activities section of  
Deckers’s 
statement of cash flows. Collections outpaced sales growth during 2013 to result in a decrease in 
Deckers’s balance in receivables. This decrease is added in reconciling net income to cash flow 
from operating activities because revenues are lower than cash collected from customers for 2013. 
When receivables increase, the amount of the increase in receivables is subtracted in reconciling net 
income to cash flow from operating activities because cash collected from customers is lower than 
revenues.

When using the percentage of sales method, you directly compute the bad debt expense for the 
period by multiplying the amount of credit sales by the bad debt loss rate. With the aging method, 
you compute the estimated ending balance in the allowance and solve for the bad debt expense. This 
process involves multiplying the amount in each age category by the estimated percentage uncol-
lectible to produce the estimated ending balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. The differ-
ence between the estimated ending balance and the balance in the allowance before the adjustment 
becomes the bad debt expense for the year. Before you move on, try an example of the more difficult 
aging method computations based on Crocs’s numbers reported in an earlier year.
S E L F - S T U D Y  Q U I Z
1. In an earlier year, Deckers’s competitor Crocs reported a beginning balance in the Allowance 
for Doubtful Accounts of $5,262. It also wrote off bad debts amounting to $2,551 during the 
year. At the end of the year, it computed total estimated uncollectible accounts using the aging 
method to be $3,973 (all numbers in thousands of dollars). What amount did Crocs record 
as bad debt expense for the period? (Solution approach: Use the Allowance for Doubtful 
Accounts T-account or the following equation to solve for the missing value.)

The accounts receivable turnover ratio measures the effectiveness of credit-granting and collec-
tion activities. Faster turnover means faster receipt of cash from your customers. To test whether you 
understand this concept, answer the following question:
2. Indicate whether granting later payment deadlines (e.g., 60 days instead of 30 days) will most 
likely increase or decrease the accounts receivable turnover ratio. Explain.
After you have completed your answers, check them below.

Granting later payment deadlines will most likely decrease the accounts receivable turnover ratio because 
later collections from customers will increase the average accounts receivable balance (the denominator of 
the ratio), decreasing the ratio.

Cash and Cash Equivalents Defined
Cash is defined as money or any instrument that banks will accept for deposit and immediate 
credit to a company’s account, such as a check, money order, or bank draft. Cash equivalents 
are investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible 
to cash and whose value is unlikely to change (that is, they are not sensitive to interest rate 
changes). Typical instruments included as cash equivalents are bank certificates of deposit and 
Treasury bills that the U.S. government issues to finance its activities.
Like most companies, Deckers combines all of its bank accounts and cash equivalents 
into one amount, Cash and Cash Equivalents, on the balance sheet. It also reports that the 
book values of cash equivalents on the balance sheet equal their fair market values—which 
we should expect given the nature of the instruments (investments whose value is unlikely 
to change).
Cash Management
Many businesses receive a large amount of cash, checks, and credit card receipts from their 
customers each day. Anyone can spend cash, so management must develop procedures to 
safeguard the cash it uses in the business. Effective cash management involves more than pro-
tecting cash from theft, fraud, or loss through carelessness. Other cash management respon-
sibilities include:
 
1. Accurate accounting so that reports of cash flows and balances may be prepared.
 
2. Controls to ensure that enough cash is available to meet (a) current operating needs, 
 
(b) maturing liabilities, and (c) unexpected emergencies.
 
3. Prevention of the accumulation of excess amounts of idle cash. Idle cash earns no revenue. 
Therefore, it is often invested in securities to earn a return until it is needed for operations.
Internal Control of Cash
The term internal controls refers to the process by which a company safeguards its assets 
and provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the company’s financial report-
ing, the effectiveness and efficiency of its operations, and its compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations. Internal control procedures should extend to all assets: cash, receiv-
ables, investments, plant and equipment, and so on. Controls that ensure the accuracy of 
the financial records are designed to prevent inadvertent errors and outright fraud. Because 
internal control increases the reliability of the financial statements, it is reviewed by the 
outside independent auditor.
Because cash is the asset most vulnerable to theft and fraud, a significant number of 
internal control procedures should focus on cash. You have already observed internal con-
trol procedures for cash, although you may not have known it at the time. At most movie the-
aters, one employee sells tickets and another employee collects them. Having one employee 
do both jobs would be less expensive, but that single employee could easily steal cash and 
admit a patron without issuing a ticket. If different employees perform the tasks, a success-
ful theft requires the participation of both.
Effective internal control of cash should include the following:
 
1. Separation of duties.
 
a. 
Complete separation of the jobs of receiving cash and disbursing cash.
 
b. 
Complete separation of the procedures of accounting for cash receipts and cash 
disbursements.
 
c. 
Complete separation of the physical handling of cash and all phases of the 
 
accounting function.

2. Prescribed policies and procedures.
 
a. 
Require that all cash receipts be deposited in a bank daily. Keep any cash on hand 
under strict control.
 
b. 
Require separate approval of the purchases and the actual cash payments. Prenum-
bered checks should be used. Special care must be taken with payments by electronic 
funds transfers since they involve no controlled documents (checks).
 
c. 
Assign the responsibilities for cash payment approval and check-signing or electronic 
funds transfer transmittal to different individuals.
 
d. 
Require monthly reconciliation of bank accounts with the cash accounts on the com-
pany’s books (discussed in detail in the next section).
Some people are bothered by the recommendation that all well-run companies should have strong inter-
nal control procedures. These people believe that control procedures suggest that management does not 
trust the company’s employees. Although the vast majority of employees are trustworthy, employee theft 
does cost businesses billions of dollars each year. Interviews with convicted felons indicate that in many 
cases they stole from their employers because they thought that it was easy and that no one cared (there 
were no internal control procedures).
Many companies have a formal code of ethics that requires high standards of behavior in dealing with 
customers, suppliers, fellow employees, and the company’s assets. Although each employee is ultimately 
responsible for his or her own ethical behavior, internal control procedures can be thought of as important 
value statements from management.

A  Q U E ST I ON 
O F  E T HI CS
Reconciliation of the Cash Accounts and the Bank Statements
Content of a Bank Statement
Proper use of the bank accounts can be an important internal cash control procedure. Each 
month, the bank provides the company (the depositor) with a bank statement that lists (1) each 
paper or electronic deposit recorded by the bank during the period, (2) each paper or electronic 
check cleared by the bank during the period, and (3) the balance in the company’s account. 
The bank statement also shows the bank charges or deductions (such as service charges) made 
directly to the company’s account by the bank. A typical bank statement for ROW.COM, Inc., 
is shown in Exhibit 6.4.
Exhibit 6.4 lists four items that need explanation. Notice the $500 and $100 items listed in 
the Checks and Debits column and coded EFT.6 This is the code for electronic funds trans-
fers. ROW.COM pays its electricity and insurance bills using electronic checking. When it 
orders the electronic payments, it records these items on the company’s books in the same man-
ner as a paper check. So no additional entry is needed.
Notice that listed in the Checks and Debits column there is a deduction for $18 coded NSF. 
This entry refers to a check for $18 received from a customer and deposited by ROW.COM 
with its bank. The bank processed the check through banking channels to the customer’s bank, 
but the account did not have sufficient funds to cover the check. The customer’s bank there-
fore returned it to ROW.COM’s bank, which then charged it back to ROW.COM’s account. 
This type of check often is called an NSF check (not sufficient funds). The NSF check is now 
a receivable; consequently, ROW.COM must make an entry to debit Receivables and credit 
Cash for the $18.
BANK STATEMENT
A monthly report from a bank that 
shows deposits recorded, checks 
cleared, other debits and credits, 
and a running bank balance.
6These codes vary among banks.


C H AP TER  6   Reporting and Interpreting Sales Revenue, Receivables, and Cash
301
Notice the $6 listed on June 30 in the Checks and Debits column and coded SC. This is the 
code for bank service charges. The bank statement included a memo by the bank explaining 
this service charge (which was not documented by a check). ROW.COM must make an entry 
to reflect this $6 decrease in the bank balance as a debit to a relevant expense account, such as 
Bank Service Expense, and a credit to Cash.
Notice the $20 listed on June 18 in the Deposits and Credits column and coded INT for 
interest earned. The bank pays interest on checking account balances, and it increased ROW 
.COM’s account for interest earned during the period. ROW.COM must record the interest by 
making an entry to debit Cash and credit Interest Income for the $20.
Need for Reconciliation
A bank reconciliation is the process of comparing (reconciling) the ending cash balance in 
the company’s records and the ending cash balance reported by the bank on the monthly bank 
statement. A bank reconciliation should be completed at the end of each month. Usually, the 
ending cash balance as shown on the bank statement does not agree with the ending cash bal-
ance shown by the related Cash ledger account on the books of the company. For example, the 
Cash ledger account of ROW.COM showed the following at the end of June (ROW.COM has 
only one checking account):

The $8,322.20 ending cash balance shown on the bank statement (Exhibit 6.4) differs from 
the $9,040.00 ending balance of cash shown on the books of ROW.COM. Most of this differ-
ence exists because of timing differences in the recording of transactions:
 
1. Some transactions affecting cash were recorded in the books of ROW.COM but were not 
shown on the bank statement.
 
2. Some transactions were shown on the bank statement but had not been recorded in the books 
of ROW.COM.
Some of the difference may also be caused by errors in recording transactions.
The most common causes of differences between the ending bank balance and the ending 
book balance of cash are as follows:
 
1. Outstanding checks. These are checks written by the company and recorded in the compa-
ny’s ledger as credits to the Cash account that have not cleared the bank (they are not shown 
on the bank statement as a deduction from the bank balance). The outstanding checks are 
identified by comparing the list of canceled checks on the bank statement with the record of 
checks (such as check stubs or a journal) maintained by the company.
 
2. Deposits in transit. These are deposits sent to the bank by the company and recorded in the 
company’s ledger as debits to the Cash account. The bank has not recorded these deposits 
(they are not shown on the bank statement as an increase in the bank balance). Deposits in 
transit usually happen when deposits are made one or two days before the close of the period 
covered by the bank statement. Deposits in transit are determined by comparing the deposits 
listed on the bank statement with the company deposit records.
 
3. Bank service charges. These are expenses for bank services listed on the bank statement 
but not recorded on the company’s books.
 
4. NSF checks. These are “bad checks” or “bounced checks” that have been deposited but 
must be deducted from the company’s cash account and rerecorded as accounts receivable.
 
5. Interest. This is the interest paid by the bank to the company on its bank balance.
 
6. Errors. Both the bank and the company may make errors, especially when the volume of 
cash transactions is large.

The company should make a bank reconciliation immediately after receiving each bank

Exhibit 6.5 shows the bank reconciliation prepared by ROW.COM for the month of June to 
reconcile the ending bank balance ($8,322.20) with the ending book balance ($9,040.00). On 
the completed reconciliation, the correct cash balance is $9,045.00. This correct balance is the 
amount that should be shown in the Cash account after the reconciliation. Since ROW.COM 
has only one checking account and no cash on hand, it is also the correct amount of cash that 
should be reported on the balance sheet.7
ROW.COM followed these steps in preparing the bank reconciliation:
 
1. Identify the outstanding checks. A comparison of the checks and electronic payments 
listed on the bank statement with the company’s record of all checks drawn and electronic 
7In this example, there were no outstanding checks or deposits in transit at the end of May.

bank) at the end of June:

121
$   &&145.00
123
815.00
131
    117.20
Total
$1,077.20
This total was entered on the reconciliation as a deduction from the bank account. These 
checks will be deducted by the bank when they clear the bank.
 
2. Identify the deposits in transit. A comparison of the deposit slips on hand with those listed 
on the bank statement revealed that a deposit of $1,800 made on June 30 was not listed on 
the bank statement. This amount was entered on the reconciliation as an addition to the bank 
account. It will be added by the bank when it records the deposit.
 
3. Record bank charges and credits:
 
a. 
Interest received from the bank, $20—entered on the bank reconciliation as an addi-
tion to the book balance; it already has been included in the bank balance.
 
b. 
NSF check of R. Smith, $18—entered on the bank reconciliation as a deduction from 
the book balance; it has been deducted from the bank statement balance.
 
c. 
Bank service charges, $6—entered on the bank reconciliation as a deduction from the 
book balance; it has been deducted from the bank balance.
 
4. Determine the impact of errors. At this point, ROW.COM found that the reconciliation did not 
balance by $9. Upon checking the journal entries made during the month, the electronic payment 
on 6-09 for $100 to pay an account payable was found. The payment was recorded in the compa-
ny’s accounts as $109. Therefore, $9 (i.e., $109 - $100) must be added to the book cash balance 
on the reconciliation; the bank cleared the electronic payment for the correct amount, $100.
Note that in Exhibit 6.5 the two sections of the bank reconciliation now agree at a correct cash 
balance of $9,045.00.
A bank reconciliation as shown in Exhibit 6.5 accomplishes two major objectives:
 
1. It checks the accuracy of the bank balance and the company cash records, which involves 
developing the correct cash balance. The correct cash balance (plus cash on hand, if any) is 
the amount of cash that is reported on the balance sheet.

Cash is the most liquid of all assets, flowing continually into and out of a business. As a result, a num-
ber of critical control procedures, including the reconciliation of bank accounts, should be applied. 
Also, management of cash may be critically important to decision makers who must have cash avail-
able to meet current needs yet must avoid excess amounts of idle cash that produce no revenue. To see 
if you understand the basics of a bank reconciliation, answer the following questions:

EPILOG U E
As we noted at the beginning of the chapter, Deckers recognized that to turn growth into 
profits, it had to (1) continually refresh its product lines by introducing new technologies, new 
styles, and new product categories; (2) become a leaner and more nimble manufacturer, taking 
advantage of lower-cost, more flexible production locations; and (3) focus attention on inven-
tory management and collections of accounts receivable since an uncollected account is of no 
value to the company. Each of these efforts is aimed at increasing net sales and/or decreasing 
cost of goods sold, thereby increasing gross profit. The first quarter of 2014 was a mixed bag 
for Deckers. Sales increased, but net income declined compared to the first quarter of 2013, 
and resulted in a net loss. You can evaluate the further success of the company’s strategy by 
going to the Web at www.deckers.com to check Deckers’s latest annual and quarterly reports.
3.  
Bank service charges are deducted from the company’s account; thus, cash must be reduced and an 
expense must be recorded.
4.  
NSF checks that were deposited were recorded on the books as increases in the cash account; thus, cash 
must be decreased and the related accounts receivable increased if payment is still expected.
S o l u t i o n s  t o  
S E L F - S T U DY  Q U I Z
(Complete the requirements before proceeding to the suggested solutions.) Wholesale Warehouse 
Stores sold $950,000 in merchandise during 2016. Of this amount, $400,000 was on credit with terms 
2/10, n/30 (75 percent of these amounts were paid within the discount period), $500,000 was paid 
with credit cards (there was a 3 percent credit card discount), and the rest was paid in cash. On 
December 31, 2016, the Accounts Receivable balance was $80,000. The beginning balance in the 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts was $9,000 and $6,000 of bad debts was written off during the year.
Required:
 
1. Compute net sales for 2016, assuming that sales and credit card discounts are treated as 
contra-revenues.
 
2. Assume that Wholesale uses the percentage of sales method for estimating bad debt expense and that 
it estimates that 2 percent of credit sales will produce bad debts. Record bad debt expense for 2016.
 
3. Assume instead that Wholesale uses the aging of accounts receivable method and that it estimates 
that $10,000 worth of current accounts is uncollectible. Record bad debt expense for 2016.
SUGGESTED SOLUTION
 
1. Both sales discounts and credit card discounts should be subtracted from sales revenues in the 
computation of net sales.
Sales revenue
$950,000
Less: Sales discounts (0.02 × 0.75 × $400,000)
6,000
  Credit card discounts (0.03 × $500,000)
 15,000
Net sales
$929,000
 
2. The percentage estimate of bad debts should be applied to credit sales. Cash sales never produce 
bad debts.

(Complete the requirements before proceeding to the suggested solution that follows.) Heather Ann 
Long, a freshman at a large state university, has just received her first checking account statement. This 
was her first chance to attempt a bank reconciliation. She had the following information to work with:
Bank balance, September 1
$1,150
Deposits during September
650
Checks cleared during September
900
Bank service charge
25
Bank balance, October 1
875
Heather was surprised that the deposit of $50 she made on September 29 had not been posted to 
her account and was pleased that her rent check of $200 had not cleared her account. Her checkbook 
balance was $750.
Required:
 
1. Complete Heather’s bank reconciliation.
 
2. Why is it important for individuals such as Heather and businesses to do a bank reconciliation each 
month?

2. Bank statements, whether personal or business, should be reconciled each month. This process 
helps ensure that a correct balance is reflected in the customer’s books. Failure to reconcile a bank 
statement increases the chance that an error will not be discovered and may result in bad checks 
being written. Businesses must reconcile their bank statements for an additional reason: The cor-
rect balance that is calculated during reconciliation is recorded on the balance sheet.

Recording Discounts and Returns
In this chapter, both credit card discounts and cash discounts have been recorded as contra-revenues. 
For example, if the credit card company is charging a 3 percent fee for its service and Deckers’s Internet 
credit card sales are $3,000 for January 2, Deckers will record the following:
Cash (+A)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Similarly, if credit sales of $1,000 are recorded with terms 2/10, n/30 ($1,000 × 0.98 = $980), and 
 
payment is made within the discount period, Deckers will record the following:

Sales returns and allowances should always be treated as a contra-revenue. Assume that Fontana’s 
Shoes of Ithaca, New York, buys 40 pairs of sandals from Deckers for $2,000 on account. On the date of 
sale, Deckers makes the following journal entry:

Before paying for the sandals, however, Fontana’s discovers that 10 pairs of sandals are not the color

6-1. Analyze the impact of credit card sales, sales discounts, and sales returns on the amounts 
reported as net sales. p. 285
Both credit card discounts and sales or cash discounts can be recorded either as contra-revenues 
or as expenses. When recorded as contra-revenues, they reduce net sales. Sales returns and allow-
ances, which should always be treated as a contra-revenue, also reduce net sales.
 
6-2. Estimate, report, and evaluate the effects of uncollectible accounts receivable (bad debts) on 
financial statements. p. 289
When receivables are material, companies must employ the allowance method to account for uncol-
lectibles. These are the steps in the process:
 
a. The end-of-period adjusting entry to record bad debt expense estimates.
 
b. Writing off specific accounts determined to be uncollectible during the period.
The adjusting entry reduces net income as well as net accounts receivable. The write-off affects 
neither.
 
6-3. Analyze and interpret the receivables turnover ratio and the effects of accounts receivable on 
cash flows. p. 296
 
a. Receivables turnover ratio—This ratio measures the effectiveness of credit-granting and 
 
collection activities. It reflects how many times average trade receivables were recorded and 
collected during the period. Analysts and creditors watch this ratio because a sudden decline in it 
may mean that a company is extending payment deadlines in an attempt to prop up lagging sales 
or is recording sales that later will be returned by customers.
 
b. Effects on cash flows—When a net decrease in accounts receivable for the period occurs, cash 
collected from customers is always more than revenue, and cash flows from operations increase. 
When a net increase in accounts receivable occurs, cash collected from customers is always less 
than revenue. Thus, cash flows from operations decline.
 
6-4. Report, control, and safeguard cash. p. 299
Cash is the most liquid of all assets, flowing continually into and out of a business. As a result, a num-
ber of critical control procedures, including the reconciliation of bank accounts, should be applied. 
Also, management of cash may be critically important to decision makers, who must have cash avail-
able to meet current needs yet must avoid excess amounts of idle cash that produce no revenue.
Closely related to recording revenue is recording the cost of what was sold. Chapter 7 will focus on 
transactions related to inventory and cost of goods sold. This topic is important because cost of goods 
sold has a major impact on a company’s gross profit and net income, which are watched closely by 
investors, analysts, and other users of financial statements. Increasing emphasis on quality, productiv-
ity, and costs have further focused production managers’ attention on cost of goods sold and inventory. 
Since inventory cost figures play a major role in product introduction and pricing decisions, they also are 
important to marketing and general managers. Finally, since inventory accounting has a major effect on 
many companies’ tax liabilities, this is an important place to introduce the effect of taxation on manage-
ment decision making and financial reporting.

receivable is aged on the basis of three time periods as follows: (1) not yet due, $22,000; (2) up to 120 
days past due, $6,500; and (3) more than 120 days past due, $2,800. Experience has shown that for each 
age group, the average loss rate on the amount of the receivables at year-end due to uncollectibility is 
 
(1) 3 percent, (2) 14 percent, and (3) 34 percent, respectively. At the end of the current year, the Allow-
ance for Doubtful Accounts balance is $1,200 (credit) before the end-of-period adjusting entry is made.

Determining Bad Debt Expense Based on Aging Analysis (AP6-3)
Blue Skies Equipment Company uses the aging approach to estimate bad debt expense at the end of each 
accounting year. Credit sales occur frequently on terms n/60. The balance of each account receivable is aged 
on the basis of three time periods as follows: (1) not yet due, (2) up to one year past due, and (3) more than 
one year past due. Experience has shown that for each age group, the average loss rate on the amount of the 
receivable at year-end due to uncollectibility is (a) 3 percent, (b) 9 percent, and (c) 28 percent, respectively.
At December 31, 2014 (end of the current accounting year), the Accounts Receivable balance was 
$48,700, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts balance was $920 (credit). In determining which 
accounts have been paid, the company applies collections to the oldest sales first. To simplify, only five 
customer accounts are used; the details of each on December 31, 2014, follow:

Determining Bad Debt Expense Based on Aging Analysis (P6-3)
Briggs & Stratton Engines Inc. uses the aging approach to estimate bad debt expense at the end of each 
accounting year. Credit sales occur frequently on terms n/45. The balance of each account receivable is 
aged on the basis of four time periods as follows: (1) not yet due, (2) up to 6 months past due, (3) 6 to 
 
12 months past due, and (4) more than one year past due. Experience has shown that for each age group, 
the average loss rate on the amount of the receivable at year-end due to uncollectibility is (a) 1 percent, 
(b) 5 percent, (c) 20 percent, and (d) 50 percent, respectively.
At December 31, 2014 (end of the current accounting year), the Accounts Receivable balance was 
$39,500, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts balance was $1,550 (credit). In determining which 
accounts have been paid, the company applies collections to the oldest sales first. To simplify, only five 
customer accounts are used; the details of each on December 31, 2014, follow:

Critical Thinking Cases
Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma: Management Incentives, Revenue Recognition, and Sales 
with the Right of Return
Symbol Technologies, Inc., was a fast-growing maker of bar-code scanners. According to the federal 
charges, Tomo Razmilovic, the CEO at Symbol, was obsessed with meeting the stock market’s expecta-
tion for continued growth. His executive team responded by improperly recording revenue and allowances 
for returns, as well as a variety of other tricks, to overstate revenues by $230 million and pretax earnings 
by $530 million. What makes this fraud nearly unique is that virtually the whole senior management 
team is charged with participating in the six-year fraud. Five have pleaded guilty, another eight are under 
indictment, and the former CEO has fled the country to avoid prosecution. The exact nature of the fraud 
is described in the following excerpt dealing with the guilty plea by the former vice president for finance:
Ex-Official at Symbol Pleads Guilty
A former finance executive at Symbol Technologies Inc. pleaded guilty to participating in a vast account-
ing fraud that inflated revenue at the maker of bar-code scanners by roughly 10%, or $100 million a year, 
from 1999 through 2001.
. . .
The criminal information and civil complaint filed yesterday accused Mr. Asti and other high-level exec-
utives of stuffing the firm’s distribution channel with phony orders at the end of each quarter to meet 
revenue and earnings targets. Under generally accepted accounting practices, revenue can be booked only 
when the products are shipped to a customer. Symbol’s customers include delivery services and grocery 
stores.
Investigators alleged that Mr. Asti and others engaged in “candy” deals, where Symbol bribed resellers 
with a 1% fee to “buy” products from a distributor at the end of a quarter, which Symbol would later buy 
back. Symbol then allegedly would convince the distributor to order more products from the company to 
satisfy the newly created inventory void.
The SEC said the inflated revenue figures helped boost Symbol’s stock price, as well as enriching 
 
Mr. Asti. He allegedly sold thousands of shares of Symbol stock, which he received from exercising stock 
options, when the stock was trading at inflated levels.

Required:
 1. What facts, if any, presented in the article suggest that Symbol violated the revenue recognition 
principle?
 2. Assuming that Symbol did recognize revenue when goods were shipped, how could it have prop-
erly accounted for the fact that customers had a right to cancel the contracts (make an analogy with 
accounting for bad debts)?
 3. What do you think may have motivated management to falsify the statements? Why was manage-
ment concerned with reporting continued growth in net income?
 4. Explain who was hurt by management’s unethical conduct.
 5. Assume that you are the auditor for other firms. After reading about the fraud, what types of transac-
tions would you pay special attention to in the audit of your clients in this industry? What ratio might 
provide warnings about possible channel stuffing?
Evaluating Internal Control
Cripple Creek Company has one trusted employee who, as the owner said, “handles all of the bookkeeping 
and paperwork for the company.” This employee is responsible for counting, verifying, and recording cash 
receipts and payments; making the weekly bank deposit; preparing checks for major expenditures (signed 
by the owner); making small expenditures from the cash register for daily expenses; and collecting accounts 
receivable. The owners asked the local bank for a $20,000 loan. The bank asked that an audit be performed

covering the year just ended. The independent auditor (a local CPA), in a private conference with the owner, 
presented some evidence of the following activities of the trusted employee during the past year.
 
a. Cash sales sometimes were not entered in the cash register, and the trusted employee pocketed approx-
imately $50 per month.
 
b. Cash taken from the cash register (and pocketed by the trusted employee) was replaced with expense 
memos with fictitious signatures (approximately $12 per day).
 
c. A $300 collection on an account receivable of a valued out-of-town customer was pocketed by the 
trusted employee and was covered by making a $300 entry as a debit to Sales Returns and a credit to 
Accounts Receivable.
 
d. An $800 collection on an account receivable from a local customer was pocketed by the trusted 
employee and was covered by making an $800 entry as a debit to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
and a credit to Accounts Receivable.

 1. What was the approximate amount stolen during the past year?
 2. What would be your recommendations to the owner?
Financial Reporting and Analysis Team Project
Team Project: Analyzing Revenues and Receivables
As a team, select an industry to analyze. Yahoo Finance provides lists of industries at biz.yahoo.com/p/
industries.html. Click on an industry for a list of companies in that industry. Alternatively, go to Google 
Finance at www.google.com/finance and search for a company you are interested in. You will be pre-
sented with a list including that company and its competitors. Each team member should acquire the 
annual report or 10-K for one publicly traded company in the industry, with each member selecting a dif-
ferent company (the SEC EDGAR service at www.sec.gov and the company’s investor relations website 
itself are good sources).
Required:
On an individual basis, each team member should write a short report answering the following questions 
about the selected company. Discuss any patterns across the companies that you as a team observe. Then, 
as a team, write a short report comparing and contrasting your companies.
 1. If your company lists receivables in its balance sheet, what percentage of total assets does receiv-
ables represent for each of the last three years? If your company does not list receivables, discuss 
why this is so.
 2. Ratio analysis
 
a. What does the receivables turnover ratio measure in general?
 
b. If your company lists receivables, compute the ratio for the last three years.
 
c. What do your results suggest about the company?
 
d. If available, find the industry ratio for the most recent year, compare it to your results, and discuss 
why you believe your company differs or is similar to the industry ratio.
 3. If your company lists receivables, use the 10-K to determine what additional disclosure is available 
concerning the allowance for doubtful accounts. (Usually the information is in a separate schedule, 
Item 15.)
 
a. What is bad debt expense as a percentage of sales for the last three years?
 4. What is the effect of the change in receivables on cash flows from operating activities for the most 
recent year (that is, did the change increase or decrease operating cash flows)? Explain your answer.

Reporting and Interpreting Cost  
of Goods Sold and Inventory
T
he Harley-Davidson eagle trademark was once known best as a popular request in tat-
too parlors. Now, Harley-Davidson dominates the heavyweight motorcycle market in 
North America with a 53.3 percent market share. Harley is also a market leader in 
Canada, Japan, and Australia and is a growing presence in Europe.
But the heavyweight king took a major hit from the worldwide economic downturn that 
started in 2008. Harley responded with an aggressive plan to enhance profitability through 
continuous improvement in manufacturing, product development, and business operations. 
These plans are aimed at shortening product development lead times and implementing flexi-
ble manufacturing at its Wisconsin, Missouri, and Pennsylvania facilities, which reduce costs 
and allow the company to better respond to the needs of the dealer network.
Controlling inventory quality, quantities, and cost are key to maintaining gross profit 
margin. Introducing new products to stay ahead of major competitors Honda and BMW and 
providing a premium dealer experience to all of Harley’s customers will also increase gross 
margin. Finally, selecting appropriate accounting methods for inventory can have a dramatic 
effect on the amount Harley-Davidson pays in income taxes. Harley produced strong financial

The cost and quality of inventory are concerns faced by all modern manufacturers 
and merchandisers and so we turn our attention to cost of goods sold (cost of sales, 
cost of products sold) on the income statement and inventory on the balance sheet. 
Exhibit 7.1 presents the relevant excerpts from Harley-Davidson’s financial state-
ments that include these accounts. Note that Cost of Goods Sold is subtracted from 
Net Sales to produce Gross Profit on its income statement. On the balance sheet, 
Inventory is a current asset; it is reported below Cash, Marketable Securities, and 
Accounts and Finance Receivables because it is less liquid than those assets.
The primary goals of inventory management are to have sufficient quantities 
of high-quality inventory available to serve customers’ needs while minimizing the 
costs of carrying inventory (production, storage, obsolescence, and financing). Low 
quality leads to customer dissatisfaction, returns, and a decline in future sales. 
Also, purchasing or producing too few units of a hot-selling item causes stock-outs, 
which mean lost sales revenue and decreases in customer satisfaction. Conversely, 
purchasing too many units of a slow-selling item increases storage costs as well 
as interest costs on short-term borrowings used to finance the purchases. It may 
even lead to losses if the merchandise cannot be sold at normal prices.
The accounting system plays three roles in the inventory management process. 
First, the system must provide accurate information for preparation of periodic 
financial statements and tax returns. Second, it must provide up-to-date informa-
tion on inventory quantities and costs to facilitate ordering and manufacturing

decisions. Third, because inventories are subject to theft and other forms of misuse, the 
system must also provide the information needed to help protect these important assets.
Harley’s mix of product lines makes it a particularly good example for this chapter. Although 
best known as a manufacturer of motorcycles, Harley also purchases and resells completed 
products such as its popular line of Motorclothes apparel. In the second case, it acts as a 
wholesaler. Both the motorcycle and Motorclothes product lines are sold to the company’s 
network of independent dealers. From an accounting standpoint, these independent dealers 
are Harley-Davidson’s customers. The independent dealers are the retailers who sell the 
products to the public.
We begin this chapter with a discussion of the makeup of inventory, the important choices 
management must make in the financial and tax reporting process, and how these choices 
affect the financial statements and taxes paid. Then we discuss how managers and analysts 
evaluate the efficiency of inventory management. Finally, we briefly discuss how accounting 
systems are organized to keep track of inventory quantities and costs for decision making and 
control. This topic will be the principal subject matter of your managerial accounting course.

Items Included in Inventory
Inventory is tangible property that is (1) held for sale in the normal course of business or 
(2) used to produce goods or services for sale. Inventory is reported on the balance sheet 
as a current asset because it normally is used or converted into cash within one year or the 
next operating cycle. The types of inventory normally held depend on the characteristics of 
 
the business.
Merchandisers (wholesale or retail businesses) hold the following:
Merchandise inventory Goods (or merchandise) held for resale in the normal course 
of business. The goods usually are acquired in a finished condition and are ready for sale 
without further processing.
For Harley-Davidson, merchandise inventory includes the Motorclothes line and the parts and 
accessories it purchases for sale to its independent dealers.
Manufacturing businesses hold three types of inventory:
Raw materials inventory Items acquired for processing into finished goods. These items 
are included in raw materials inventory until they are used, at which point they become part 
of work in process inventory.
Work in process inventory Goods in the process of being manufactured but not yet com-
plete. When completed, work in process inventory becomes finished goods inventory.
Finished goods inventory Manufactured goods that are complete and ready for sale.
Inventories related to Harley-Davidson’s motorcycle manufacturing operations are recorded in 
these accounts.
INVENTORY 
Tangible property held for sale 
in the normal course of business 
or used in producing goods or

C HAP TER  7   Reporting and Interpreting Cost of Goods Sold and Inventory
Harley-Davidson’s recent inventory note reports the following:
Incidental costs such as inspection and preparation costs often are not material in amount (see the discus-
sion of materiality in Chapter 5) and do not have to be assigned to the inventory cost. Thus, for practical 
reasons, many companies use the invoice price, less returns and discounts, to assign a unit cost to raw mate-
rials or merchandise and record other indirect expenditures as a separate cost that is reported as an expense.

Note that Harley-Davidson combines the raw materials and work in process into one number. 
Other companies separate the two components. The parts and accessories and general mer-
chandise category includes purchased parts and Motorclothes and other accessories that make 
up merchandise inventory.1
Costs Included in Inventory Purchases
Goods in inventory are initially recorded at cost. Inventory cost includes the sum of the costs 
incurred in bringing an article to usable or salable condition and location. When Harley-
Davidson purchases raw materials and merchandise inventory, the amount recorded should 
include the invoice price to be paid plus other expenditures related to the purchase, such as 
freight charges to deliver the items to its warehouses (freight-in) and inspection and prepara-
tion costs. Any purchase returns and allowances or purchase discounts taken are subtracted. 
In general, the company should cease accumulating purchase costs when the raw materials are 
ready for use or when the merchandise inventory is ready for shipment. Any additional costs 
related to selling the inventory to the dealers, such as marketing department salaries and dealer 
training sessions, are incurred after the inventory is ready for use. So they should be included in 
selling, general, and administrative expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
1These do not add up to the balance reported in Exhibit 7.1 because they do not include the LIFO adjustment 
discussed later.
Flow of Inventory Costs
The flow of inventory costs for merchandisers (wholesalers and retailers) is relatively simple, 
as Exhibit 7.2A shows. When merchandise is purchased, the merchandise inventory account is 
increased. When the goods are sold, cost of goods sold is increased and merchandise inventory 
is decreased.

The flow of inventory costs in a manufacturing environment is more complex, as dia-
grammed in Exhibit 7.2B. First, raw materials (also called direct materials) must be 
purchased. For Harley-Davidson, these raw materials include steel and aluminum cast-
ings, forgings, sheet, and bars, as well as certain motorcycle component parts produced 
by its small network of suppliers, including carburetors, batteries, and tires. When they 
are used, the cost of these materials is removed from the raw materials inventory and 
added to the work in process inventory.
Two other components of manufacturing cost, direct labor and factory overhead, are also 
added to the work in process inventory when they are used. Direct labor cost represents 
the earnings of employees who work directly on the products being manufactured. Factory 
overhead costs include all other manufacturing costs. For example, the factory supervisor’s 
salary and the cost of heat, light, and power to operate the factory are included in factory 
overhead. When the motorcycles are completed and ready for sale, the related amounts in 
work in process inventory are transferred to finished goods inventory. When the finished 
goods are sold, cost of goods sold increases, and finished goods inventory decreases.
As Exhibit 7.2 indicates, there are three stages to inventory cost flows for both mer-
chandisers and manufacturers. The first involves purchasing and/or production activities. In 
the second stage, these activities result in additions to inventory accounts on the balance sheet. 
In the third stage, the inventory items are sold and the amounts become cost of goods sold 
expense on the income statement. Since the flow of inventory costs from merchandise inven-
tory and finished goods to cost of goods sold are very similar, we will focus the rest of our 
discussion on merchandise inventory.
Cost of Goods Sold Equation
Cost of goods sold (CGS) expense is directly related to sales revenue. Sales revenue during an 
accounting period is the number of units sold multiplied by the sales price. Cost of goods sold 
is the same number of units multiplied by their unit costs.
DIRECT LABOR 
The earnings of employees who 
work directly on the products 
being manufactured.
FACTORY OVERHEAD 
Manufacturing costs that are not 
raw material or direct labor costs.

C HAP TER  7   Reporting and Interpreting Cost of Goods Sold and Inventory
Let’s examine the relationship between cost of goods sold on the income statement and 
inventory on the balance sheet. Harley-Davidson starts each accounting period with a stock 
of inventory called beginning inventory (BI). During the accounting period, new purchases 
(P) are added to inventory. The sum of the two amounts is the goods available for sale during 
that period. What remains unsold at the end of the period becomes ending inventory (EI) on 
the balance sheet. The portion of goods available for sale that is sold becomes cost of goods 
sold on the income statement. The ending inventory for one accounting period then becomes 
the beginning inventory for the next period. The relationships between these various inventory 
amounts are brought together in the cost of goods sold equation:
BI + P − EI = CGS
To illustrate, assume that Harley-Davidson began the period with $40,000 worth of Motor-
clothes in beginning inventory, purchased additional merchandise during the period for 
$55,000, and had $35,000 left in inventory at the end of the period. These amounts are com-
bined as follows to compute cost of goods sold of $60,000:
 Beginning inventory
$40,000
+ Purchases of merchandise during the year
##########55,000
 Goods available for sale
95,000
- Ending inventory
##########35,000
 Cost of goods sold
$60,000
These same relationships are illustrated in Exhibit 7.3 and can be represented in the merchan-
dise inventory T-account as follows:

Beginning inventory
40,000
Add: Purchases of inventory
55,000
Deduct: Cost of goods sold
60,000
Ending inventory

If three of these four values are known, either the cost of goods sold equation or the inventory 
T-account can be used to solve for the fourth value.

Inventory should include all items owned that are held for resale. Costs flow into inventory when 
goods are purchased or manufactured. They flow out (as an expense) when they are sold or disposed 
of. The cost of goods sold equation describes these flows.

Perpetual and Periodic Inventory Systems
The amount of purchases for the period is always accumulated in the accounting system. The 
amount of cost of goods sold and ending inventory can be determined by using one of two dif-
ferent inventory systems: perpetual or periodic.
Perpetual Inventory System
To this point in the text, all journal entries for purchase and sale transactions have been recorded 
using a perpetual inventory system. In a perpetual inventory system, purchase transactions are 
recorded directly in an inventory account. When each sale is recorded, a companion cost of goods 
sold entry is made, decreasing inventory and recording cost of goods sold. You have already 
experienced the starting point for that process when your purchases are scanned at the checkout 
counter at Walmart or Target. Not only does that process determine how much you must pay the 
cashier, it also removes the sold items from the store inventory records. As a result, information 
on cost of goods sold and ending inventory is available on a continuous (perpetual) basis.
In a perpetual inventory system, a detailed record is maintained for each type of merchan-
dise stocked, showing (1) units and cost of the beginning inventory, (2) units and cost of each 
purchase, (3) units and cost of the goods for each sale, and (4) units and cost of the goods on 
hand at any point in time. This up-to-date record is maintained on a transaction-by-transaction 
basis. Most modern companies could not survive without this information. As noted at the 
beginning of the chapter, cost and quality pressures brought on by increasing competition, 
combined with dramatic declines in the cost of computers, have made sophisticated perpetual 
inventory systems a requirement at all but the smallest companies. As a consequence, we will 
continue to focus on perpetual inventory systems throughout the book.
Periodic Inventory System
Under the periodic inventory system, no up-to-date record of inventory is maintained during 
the year. An actual physical count of the goods remaining on hand is required at the end of 
each period. The number of units of each type of merchandise on hand is multiplied by unit 
cost to compute the dollar amount of the ending inventory. Cost of goods sold is calculated 
using the cost of goods sold equation.
Because the amount of inventory is not known until the end of the period when the inventory 
count is taken, the amount of cost of goods sold cannot be reliably determined until the inven-
tory count is complete. The primary disadvantage of a periodic inventory system is the lack of 
inventory information. Managers are not informed about low or excess stock situations.
INVEN TORY  C OST I N G  M E T H ODS
In the Motorclothes example presented in the Self-Study Quiz, the cost of all units of the leather 
baseball jackets was the same—$75. If inventory costs normally did not change, this would be 
the end of our discussion. As we are all aware, however, the prices of most goods do change. 
In recent years, the costs of many manufactured items such as automobiles and motorcycles 
have risen gradually. In some industries such as computers, costs of production have dropped 
dramatically along with retail prices.
When inventory costs have changed, which inventory items are treated as sold or remaining 
in inventory can turn profits into losses and cause companies to pay or save millions in taxes. A 
simple example will illustrate these dramatic effects. Do not let the simplicity of our example 
mislead you. It applies broadly to actual company practices.
Assume that a Harley-Davidson dealer made the following purchases:
Jan.  1 Had beginning inventory of two units of a Model A leather jacket at $70 each.
Jan. 12 Purchased four units of the Model A leather jacket at $80 each.
Jan. 14 Purchased one unit of the Model A leather jacket at $100.
Jan. 15 Sold four units of the Model A leather jacket for $120 each.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7-2
Report inventory and cost 
of goods sold using the four 
inventory costing methods.


C H A P TER  7   Reporting and Interpreting Cost of Goods Sold and Inventory
341
Note that the cost of the leather jacket rose rapidly during January. On January 15, four 
units are sold for $120 each and revenues of $480 are recorded. What amount is recorded as 
cost of goods sold? The answer depends on which specific goods we assume are sold. Four 
generally accepted inventory costing methods are available for determining cost of goods sold:
 
1. Specific identification.
 
2. First-in, first-out (FIFO).
 
3. Last-in, first-out (LIFO).
 
4. Average cost.
The four inventory costing methods are alternative ways to assign the total dollar amount of 
goods available for sale between (1) ending inventory and (2) cost of goods sold. The first 
method identifies individual items that remain in inventory or are sold. The remaining three 
methods assume that the inventory costs follow a certain flow.
Specific Identification Method
When the specific identification method is used, the cost of each item sold is individually 
identified and recorded as cost of goods sold. This method requires keeping track of the pur-
chase cost of each item. In the leather jacket example, any four of the items could have been 
sold. If we assume that one of the $70 items, two of the $80 items, and the one $100 item have 
been sold, the cost of those items ($70 + $80 + $80 + $100) would become cost of goods sold 
($330). The cost of the remaining items would be ending inventory.
The specific identification method is impractical when large quantities of similar items are 
stocked. On the other hand, when dealing with expensive unique items such as houses or fine 
jewelry, this method is appropriate. As a consequence, most inventory items are accounted for 
using one of three cost flow assumptions.
Cost Flow Assumptions
The choice of an inventory costing method is NOT based on the physical flow of goods on 
and off the shelves. That is why they are called cost flow assumptions. A useful tool for repre-
senting inventory cost flow assumptions is a bin, or container. Try visualizing these inventory 
costing methods as flows of inventory in and out of the bin.
First-In, First-Out Method
The first-in, first-out method, frequently called FIFO, assumes that the earliest goods purchased 
(the first ones in) are the first goods sold, and the last goods purchased are left in ending inventory. 
Under FIFO, cost of goods sold and ending inventory are computed as if the flows in and out of 
the FIFO inventory bin in Exhibit 7.4A had taken place. First, each purchase is treated as if it were 
deposited in the bin from the top in sequence (two units of beginning inventory at $70 followed by 
purchases of four units at $80 and one unit at $100), producing goods available for sale of $560. 
Each good sold is then removed from the bottom in sequence (two units at $70 and two at $80); 
first in is first out. These goods totaling $300 become cost of goods sold (CGS). The remaining 
units (two units at $80 and one unit at $100 = $260) become ending inventory. FIFO allocates the 
oldest unit costs to cost of goods sold and the newest unit costs to ending inventory.
SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION 
METHOD 
An inventory costing method that 
identifies the cost of the specific 
item that was sold.
FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO)

Last-In, First-Out Method
The last-in, first-out method, often called LIFO, assumes that the most recently purchased 
goods (the last ones in) are sold first and the oldest units are left in ending inventory. It is illus-
trated by the LIFO inventory bin in Exhibit 7.4B. As in FIFO, each purchase is treated as if it 
were deposited in the bin from the top (two units of beginning inventory at $70 followed by 
purchases of four units at $80 and one unit at $100), resulting in the goods available for sale 
of $560. Unlike FIFO, however, each good sold is treated as if it were removed from the top in

sequence (one unit at $100 followed by three units at $80). These goods totaling $340 become 
cost of goods sold (CGS). The remaining units (one at $80 and two at $70 = $220) become 
ending inventory. LIFO allocates the newest unit costs to cost of goods sold and the oldest unit 
costs to ending inventory.
The LIFO cost flow assumption is the exact opposite of the FIFO cost flow assumption:

Average Cost Method
The average cost method (weighted average cost method) uses the weighted average unit cost 
of the goods available for sale for both cost of goods sold and ending inventory. The weighted 
average unit cost of the goods available for sale is computed as follows.

Financial Statement Effects of Inventory Methods
Each of the four alternative inventory costing methods is in conformity with GAAP and the tax law. 
To understand why managers choose different methods in different circumstances, we must first 
understand their effects on the income statement and balance sheet. Exhibit 7.5 summarizes the 
financial statement effects of the FIFO, LIFO, and average cost inventory methods in our example. 
Remember that the methods differ only in the dollar amount of goods available for sale allocated to 
cost of goods sold versus ending inventory. For that reason, the method that gives the highest end-
ing inventory amount also gives the lowest cost of goods sold and the highest gross profit, income 
tax expense, and income amounts, and vice versa. The weighted average cost method generally 
gives income and inventory amounts that are between the FIFO and LIFO extremes.
In our example, recall that unit costs were increasing. When unit costs are rising, LIFO 
produces lower income and a lower inventory valuation than FIFO. Even in inflation-
ary times, some companies’ costs decline. When unit costs are declining, LIFO produces 
higher income and higher inventory valuation than FIFO. These effects, which hold as long 
as inventory quantities are constant or rising,3 are summarized in the following table:
Perpetual Inventory Systems and Cost Flow Assumptions in Practice
You should have noted that, in our example, all inventory units were purchased before a sale 
was made and cost of goods sold recorded. In reality, most companies make numerous pur-
chases and sales of the same inventory item throughout the accounting period. How can we 
apply our simple example to these circumstances given that companies normally employ per-
petual inventory systems?
First, it is important to know that FIFO inventory and cost of goods sold are the same 
whether computed on a perpetual or periodic basis. Second, accounting systems that keep track 
of the costs of individual items normally do so on a FIFO or average cost basis, regardless of 
the cost flow assumption used for financial reporting. As a consequence, companies that wish 
to report under LIFO convert the outputs of their perpetual inventory system to LIFO with an 
adjusting entry at the end of each period. By waiting until the end of the period to calculate this 
LIFO adjustment, LIFO ending inventory and cost of goods sold are calculated as if all pur-
chases during the period were recorded before cost of goods sold was calculated and recorded. 
In other words, our simple example of how to calculate cost of goods sold applies even though 
a company actually tracks the number of units bought and sold on a perpetual basis.2
2We show an example comparing calculation of cost of goods sold under perpetual versus periodic FIFO and LIFO 
in Chapter Supplement B.
3The impact of a decline in inventory quantity on LIFO amounts is discussed in Supplement A to this chapter.
While U.S. GAAP allows companies to choose between FIFO, LIFO, and average cost inventory account-
ing methods, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) currently prohibit the use of LIFO. U.S. 
GAAP also allows different inventory accounting methods to be used for different types of inventory 
items and even for the same item in different locations. IFRS requires that the same method be used for 
all inventory items that have a similar nature and use. These differences can create comparability prob-
lems when one attempts to compare companies across international borders. For example, Ford uses 
LIFO to value most U.S. inventories and average cost or FIFO for non–U.S. inventories, while Honda (of 
Japan) uses FIFO for all inventories. Each individual country’s tax laws determine the acceptability of 
different inventory methods for tax purposes.

Managers’ Choice of Inventory Methods
What motivates companies to choose different inventory costing methods? Most managers 
choose accounting methods based on two factors:
 
1. Net income effects (managers prefer to report higher earnings for their companies).
 
2. Income tax effects (managers prefer to pay the least amount of taxes allowed by law as late 
as possible—the least–latest rule of thumb).
Any conflict between the two motives is normally resolved by choosing one accounting method 
for external financial statements and a different method for preparing the company’s tax return. 
The choice of inventory costing methods is a special case, however, because of what is called 
the LIFO conformity rule: If LIFO is used on the U.S. income tax return, it must also be used 
to calculate inventory and cost of goods sold for the financial statements.

C HAP TER  7   Reporting and Interpreting Cost of Goods Sold and Inventory
This is illustrated in Exhibit 7.5, where income before income taxes was lowered from $100 
under FIFO to $60 under LIFO. On the income tax expense line, this lowers income taxes from 
$25 under FIFO to $15 under LIFO, generating cash tax savings of $10 under LIFO.4 The 
LIFO conformity rule leads companies to adopt LIFO for both tax and financial reporting pur-
poses for increasing cost inventories located in the United States. Harley-Davidson is a fairly 
typical company facing increasing costs. It has saved approximately $17 million in taxes from 
the date it adopted the LIFO method through 2014.
For inventory located in countries that do not allow LIFO for tax purposes or that do not 
have a LIFO conformity rule, companies with increasing costs most often use FIFO or average 
cost to report higher income on the income statement.
Decreasing Cost Inventories

 For inventory with decreasing costs, FIFO is most often used for both the tax return 
and financial statements.
Using this method (along with lower of cost or market valuation, discussed later) produces the 
lowest tax payments for companies with decreasing cost inventories. Many high-technology 
companies are facing declining costs. In such circumstances, the FIFO method, in which the 
oldest, most expensive goods become cost of goods sold, produces the highest cost of goods 
sold, the lowest pretax earnings, and thus the lowest income tax liability. For example, Apple 
 
and HP account for inventories using the FIFO method.
Since most companies in the same industry face similar cost structures, clusters of compa-
nies in the same industries often choose the same accounting method.
Consistency in Use of Inventory Methods
It is important to remember that regardless of the physical flow of goods, a company can use 
any of the inventory costing methods. Also, a company is not required to use the same inven-
tory costing method for all inventory items, and no particular justification is needed for the 
selection of one or more of the acceptable methods. Harley-Davidson, and most large com-
panies, use different inventory methods for different inventory items. However, accounting 
rules require companies to apply their accounting methods on a consistent basis over time. A 
company is not permitted to use LIFO one period, FIFO the next, and then go back to LIFO. 
A change in method is allowed only if the change will improve the measurement of financial 
results and financial position.
We have seen that the selection of an inventory method can have significant effects on the financial 
statements. Company managers may have an incentive to select a method that is not consistent with 
the owners’ objectives. For example, during a period of rising prices, using LIFO may be in the best 
interests of the owners because LIFO often reduces a company’s tax liability. However, if manag-
ers’ compensation is tied to reported profits, they may prefer FIFO, which typically results in higher 
profits.
While a well-designed compensation plan should reward managers for acting in the best interests 
of the owners, that is not always the case. Clearly, a manager who selects an accounting method that 
is not optimal for the company solely to increase his or her compensation is engaging in questionable 
ethical behavior.
LIFO and Conflicts between Managers’ and Owners’ Interests
A  Q U E ST I ON  
O F  E T HI CS
4In theory, LIFO cannot provide permanent tax savings because (1) when inventory levels drop or (2) costs drop, the 
income effect reverses and the income taxes deferred must be paid. The economic advantage of deferring income 
taxes in such situations is due to the fact that interest can be earned on the money that otherwise would be paid as 
taxes for the current year.


P A U S E  F O R  F E E D B A C K
Four different inventory costing methods may be used to allocate costs between the units remaining 
in inventory and the units sold, depending on economic circumstances. The methods include specific 
identification, FIFO, LIFO, and average cost. Each of the inventory costing methods conforms to 
GAAP. Remember that the cost flow assumption need not match the physical flow of inventory. The 
following questions test your understanding of the FIFO and LIFO methods.
S E L F - S T U D Y  Q U I Z
 
1. Compute cost of goods sold and pretax income for 2015 under the FIFO and LIFO accounting 
methods. Assume that a company’s beginning inventory and purchases for 2015 included:
Beginning inventory
10 units @ $ 6 each
Purchases January
 5 units @ $10 each
Purchases May
 5 units @ $12 each
  During 2015, 15 units were sold for $20 each, and other operating expenses totaled $100.
 
2. Compute cost of goods sold and pretax income for 2016 under the FIFO and LIFO account-
ing methods. (Hint: The 2015 ending inventory amount from Part 1 becomes the 2016 
beginning inventory amount.) Assume that the company’s purchases for 2016 included:
Purchases March
 6 units @ $13 each
Purchases November
 5 units @ $14 each
  During 2016, 10 units were sold for $24 each, and other operating expenses totaled $70.

Inventories should be measured initially at their purchase cost in conformity with the cost prin-
ciple. When the net realizable value (sales price less costs to sell) of goods remaining in end-
ing inventory falls below cost, these goods must be assigned a unit cost equal to their current 
estimated net realizable value. This rule is known as measuring inventories at the lower of cost 
or market (LCM or lower of cost or net realizable value).
This departure from the cost principle is based on the conservatism constraint, which 
requires special care to avoid overstating assets and income. It is particularly important for two 
types of companies: (1) high-technology companies such as HP that manufacture goods for 
which costs of production and selling price are declining and (2) companies such as American 
Eagle Outfitters that sell seasonal goods such as clothing, the value of which drops dramati-
cally at the end of each selling season (fall or spring).
Under LCM, companies recognize a “holding” loss in the period in which the net realizable 
value of an item drops, rather than in the period the item is sold. The holding loss is the difference 
between the purchase cost and the lower net realizable value. It is added to the cost of goods sold for 
the period. To illustrate, assume that HP had the following in the current period ending inventory:

The 1,000 Intel chips should be recorded in the ending inventory at the current net realizable 
value ($200) because it is lower than the cost ($250). HP makes the following journal entry to 
record the write-down:
Since the market price of the disk drives ($110) is higher than the original cost ($100), no 
write-down is necessary. The drives remain on the books at their cost of $100 per unit ($40,000 
in total). Recognition of holding gains on inventory is not permitted by GAAP.
The write-down of the Intel chips to market produces the following effects on the income 
statement and balance sheet:
Note that the effects in the period of sale are the opposite of those in the period of the write-
down. Lower of cost or market changes only the timing of cost of goods sold. It transfers cost 
of goods sold from the period of sale to the period of write-down.
Note that in the two examples that follow, both Harley-Davidson, which is a mixed LIFO 
company, and HP, which is a FIFO company, report the use of lower of cost or market for finan-
cial statement purposes.5
5For tax purposes, lower of cost or market may be applied with all inventory costing methods except LIFO.

Measuring Efficiency in Inventory Management
As noted at the beginning of the chapter, the primary goals of inventory management are to 
have sufficient quantities of high-quality inventory available to serve customers’ needs while 
minimizing the costs of carrying inventory (production, storage, obsolescence, and financing). 
The inventory turnover ratio is an important measure of the company’s success in balancing 
these conflicting goals.

INTERPRETATIONS
In General The inventory turnover ratio reflects how many times average inventory was produced and 
sold during the period. A higher ratio indicates that inventory moves more quickly through the production 
process to the ultimate customer, reducing storage and obsolescence costs. Because less money is tied up 
in inventory, the excess can be invested to earn interest income or reduce borrowing, which reduces inter-
est expense. More efficient purchasing and production techniques, such as just-in-time inventory, as well 
as high product demand cause this ratio to be high. Analysts and creditors also watch the inventory turn-
over ratio because a sudden decline may mean that a company is facing an unexpected drop in demand for 
its products or is becoming sloppy in its production management. Many managers and analysts compute 
the related number average days to sell inventory, which, for Harley-Davidson, is equal to:
It indicates the average time it takes the company to produce and deliver inventory to customers.
Focus Company Analysis Harley-Davidson’s inventory turnover was generally stable from 2012 to 
2014, fluctuating around a ratio of 8.1 during those three years. Harley’s ratio is higher than that of related 
company Polaris and also higher than that of giant Japanese auto and motorcycle manufacturer Honda.
A Few Cautions Differences across industries in purchasing, production, and sales processes cause dra-
matic differences in this ratio. For example, restaurants such as Papa John’s, which must turn over their per-
ishable inventory very quickly, tend to have much higher inventory turnover. A particular firm’s ratio should 
be compared only with its figures from prior years or with figures for other firms in the same industry.
P A U S E  F O R  F E E D B A C K
The inventory turnover ratio measures the efficiency of inventory management. It reflects how many 
times average inventory was produced and sold during the period. Analysts and creditors watch this 
ratio because a sudden decline may mean that a company is facing an unexpected drop in demand for its 
products or is becoming sloppy in its production management. When a net decrease in inventory for 
the period occurs, sales are more than purchases; thus, the decrease must be added in computing cash 
flows from operations. When a net increase in inventory for the period occurs, the opposite is true. 
Before you move on, complete the following questions to test your understanding of these concepts.

tions for 2014, answer the following question. If Harley-Davidson had been able to manage its inven-
tory more efficiently and decrease purchases and ending inventory by $10,000 for 2014, would its

report beginning and ending inventory on a FIFO basis in the notes if the FIFO values are 
materially different. We can use this information along with the cost of goods sold equation to 
convert the balance sheet and income statement to the FIFO basis.
Converting the Income Statement to FIFO
Recall that the choice of a cost flow assumption affects how goods available for sale are allo-
cated to ending inventory and cost of goods sold. It does not affect the recording of purchases. 
Ending inventory will be different under the alternative methods, and, because last year’s end-
ing inventory is this year’s beginning inventory, beginning inventory will also be different:

Different
+ Purchases of merchandise during the year

- Ending inventory

######################Cost of goods sold 
Different
This equation suggests that if we know the differences between a company’s inventory valued 
at LIFO and FIFO for both beginning and ending inventory, we can compute the difference in 
cost of goods sold. Exhibit 7.6 shows Harley-Davidson’s 2014 disclosure of the differences 
between LIFO and FIFO values for beginning and ending inventory. These amounts, referred 
to as the LIFO reserve or “Excess of FIFO over LIFO,” are disclosed by LIFO users in their 
inventory footnotes.
Using Harley-Davidson’s LIFO reserve values reported in the footnote presented in 
Exhibit 7.6, we see that cost of goods sold would have been $1,176 lower had it used FIFO.

These Harley-Davidson computations are for 2014. It is important to note that even compa-
nies that usually face increasing costs occasionally face decreasing costs. For example, during 
2000, Harley-Davidson’s costs of new inventory declined due to manufacturing efficiencies. As 
a result, even though LIFO usually saves the company taxes, Harley paid extra taxes in 2000.
Converting Inventory on the Balance Sheet to FIFO
You can adjust the inventory amounts on the balance sheet to FIFO by substituting the FIFO 
values in the note ($498,773 and $473,233 for 2014 and 2013, respectively) for the LIFO val-
ues (see Exhibit 7.6). Alternatively, you can add the LIFO reserve to the LIFO value on the 
balance sheet to arrive at the same numbers.
For many LIFO companies, the inventory turnover ratio can be deceptive. Remember that, for these 
companies, the beginning and ending inventory numbers that make up the denominator of the ratio 
will be artificially small because they reflect old lower costs. Consider Deere & Co., manufacturer 
of John Deere farm, lawn, and construction equipment. Its inventory note lists the following values:

Total FIFO value
$5,738
$6,464
Adjustment to LIFO basis
 1,528
 1,529
Inventories
$4,210
$4,935
John Deere’s cost of goods sold for 2014 was $24,775.8 million. If the ratio were computed 
using the reported LIFO inventory values for the ratio, it would be
LIFO and Inventory Turnover Ratio
F I N A N CI A L
A N A LYS I S
Inventory Turnover Ratio =
$24,775.8
($4,210 + $4,935)/2 = 5.4
Converting cost of goods sold (the numerator) to a FIFO basis and using the more current FIFO 
inventory values in the denominator, it would be
Inventory Turnover Ratio =
$24,775.8 + 1
($5,738 + $6,464)/2 = 4.1
Note that the major difference between the two ratios is in the denominator. FIFO inventory 
values are roughly 36 percent higher than the LIFO values. The LIFO beginning and ending 
inventory numbers are artificially small because they reflect older lower costs.

The selection of an inventory costing method is important because it will affect reported income, 
income tax expense (and hence cash flow), and the inventory valuation reported on the balance sheet. 
In a period of rising prices, FIFO normally results in a higher income and higher taxes than LIFO; in 
a period of falling prices, the opposite occurs. The choice of methods is normally made to minimize 
taxes. Answer the following question to practice converting cost of goods sold and pretax income 
from the LIFO to the FIFO method for a company facing increasing prices.
S E L F - S T U D Y  Q U I Z
In a recent year, Caterpillar Inc., a major manufacturer of farm and construction equipment, reported 
pretax earnings of $6,725 million. Its inventory note indicated “if the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method 
had been in use, inventories would have been $2,422 and $2,575 higher than reported at the end of the 
current and prior year, respectively.” (The amounts noted are for the LIFO reserve.) Convert pretax 
earnings for the current year from a LIFO to a FIFO basis.

Internal Control of Inventory
After cash, inventory is the asset second most vulnerable to theft. Efficient management of inven-
tory to avoid the cost of stock-outs and overstock situations is also crucial to the profitability of 
most companies. As a consequence, a number of control features focus on safeguarding invento-
ries and providing up-to-date information for management decisions. Key among these are:
 
1. Separation of responsibilities for inventory accounting and physical handling of inventory.
 
2. Storage of inventory in a manner that protects it from theft and damage.
 
3. Limiting access to inventory to authorized employees.
 
4. Maintaining perpetual inventory records (described earlier in this chapter).
 
5. Comparing perpetual records to periodic physical counts of inventory.
Errors in Measuring Ending Inventory
As the cost of goods sold equation indicates, a direct relationship exists between ending 
inventory and cost of goods sold because items not in the ending inventory are assumed to 
have been sold. Thus, the measurement of ending inventory quantities and costs affects both 
the balance sheet (assets) and the income statement (cost of goods sold, gross profit, and net 
income). The measurement of ending inventory affects not only the net income for that period 
but also the net income for the next accounting period. This two-period effect occurs because the 
ending inventory for one period is the beginning inventory for the next accounting period.
Greeting card maker Gibson Greetings overstated its net income by 20 percent because 
one division overstated ending inventory for the year. You can compute the effects of the error 
on both the current year’s and the next year’s income before taxes using the cost of goods sold

equation. Assume that ending inventory was overstated by $10,000 due to a clerical error that 
was not discovered. This would have the following effects in the current year and next year:

+ Purchases of merchandise  
   #during the year
- Ending inventory

Cost of goods sold 
Understated $10,000
Because cost of goods sold was understated, income before taxes would be overstated by 
$10,000 in the current year. And, since the current year’s ending inventory becomes next year’s 
beginning inventory, it would have the following effects the next year. Because cost of goods sold 
was overstated, income before taxes would be understated by $10,000 in the next year.
Each of these errors would flow into retained earnings so that at the end of the current year, 
retained earnings would be overstated by $10,000 (less the related income tax expense). This 
error would be offset in the next year, and retained earnings and inventory at the end of next 
year would be correct.
In this example, we assumed that the overstatement of ending inventory was inadvertent, the 
result of a clerical error. However, inventory fraud is a common form of financial statement fraud.
P A U S E  F O R  F E E D B A C K
An error in the measurement of ending inventory affects cost of goods sold on the current period’s 
income statement and ending inventory on the balance sheet. Because this year’s ending inventory 
becomes next year’s beginning inventory, it also affects cost of goods sold in the following period by 
the same amount but in the opposite direction. These relationships can be seen through the cost of 
goods sold equation (BI + P − EI = CGS).

Inventory and Cash Flows
When companies expand production to meet increases in demand, this increases the amount of 
inventory reported on the balance sheet. However, when companies overestimate demand for 
a product, they usually produce too many units of the slow-selling item. This increases storage 
costs as well as the interest costs on short-term borrowings that finance the inventory. It may 
even lead to losses if the excess inventory cannot be sold at normal prices. The cash flow state-
ment often provides the first sign of such problems.
As with a change in accounts receivable, a change in inventories can have a major effect on a company’s 
cash flow from operations. Cost of goods sold on the income statement may be more or less than the 
amount of cash paid to suppliers during the period. Since most inventory is purchased on open credit (bor-
rowing from suppliers is normally called accounts payable), reconciling cost of goods sold with cash paid 
to suppliers requires consideration of the changes in both the Inventory and Accounts Payable accounts.
The simplest way to think about the effects of changes in inventory is that buying (increasing) inven-
tory eventually decreases cash, while selling (decreasing) inventory eventually increases cash. Similarly, 
borrowing from suppliers, which increases accounts payable, increases cash. Paying suppliers, which 
decreases accounts payable, decreases cash.
EFFECT ON STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
In General When a net decrease in inventory for the period occurs, sales are greater than purchases; 
thus, the decrease must be added in computing cash flows from operations.
When a net increase in inventory for the period occurs, sales are less than purchases; thus, the 
increase must be subtracted in computing cash flows from operations.
When a net decrease in accounts payable for the period occurs, payments to suppliers are greater 
than new purchases; thus, the decrease must be subtracted in computing cash flows from operations.
When a net increase in accounts payable for the period occurs, payments to suppliers are less than 
new purchases; thus, the increase must be added in computing cash flows from operations.

Focus Company Analysis When the inventory balance increases during the period, as was the case at 
Harley-Davidson in 2014, the company has purchased or produced more inventory than it has sold. Thus, 
the increase is subtracted in the computation of cash flow from operations. Conversely, when the inventory 
balance decreases during the period, the company has sold more inventory than it purchased or produced. 
Thus, the decrease is added in the computation of cash flow from operations. When the accounts payable 
balance increases during the period, the company has borrowed more from suppliers than it has paid them 
(or postponed payments). Thus, the increase is added in the computation of cash flow from operations.*
*For companies with foreign currency or business acquisitions/dispositions, the amount of the change reported on 
the cash flow statement will not equal the change in the accounts reported on the balance sheet.

Chapter Supplement A
LIFO Liquidations
When a LIFO company sells more inventory than it purchases or manufactures, items from beginning 
inventory become part of cost of goods sold. This is called a LIFO liquidation. When inventory costs 
are rising, these lower-cost items in beginning inventory produce a higher gross profit, higher taxable 
income, and higher taxes when they are sold. We illustrate this process by continuing our Harley-
Davidson Model A leather baseball jacket example into its second year.
Financial Statement Effects of LIFO Liquidations
Recall that, in its first year of operation, the store purchased units for $70, $80, and $100 in sequence (see 
Exhibit 7.4). Then, the $100 unit and three of the $80 units were sold under LIFO, leaving one $80 unit and 
two $70 units in ending inventory. We will continue this illustration into a second year. The ending inventory 
from Year 1 becomes the beginning inventory for Year 2.
First, we assume that in Year 2, the Harley-Davidson store purchases a total of three inventory units 
at the current $120 price, the sales price has been raised to $140, and three units are sold. Using LIFO, 
the units are allocated to ending inventory and cost of goods sold as follows.
Cost of Goods Sold Calculation (LIFO with three units purchased and three units sold)
  
 
Beginning inventory 
(2 units at $70 each and 1 unit at $80)

Cost of goods sold 
(3 units at $120 each) 
$360
Given that revenue is $140 per unit, the gross profit on the three newly purchased units is 3 units × $20 = $60.
Now assume instead that the store purchases only two additional units at $120 each. Using LIFO, 
these two new $120 units and the old $80 unit would become cost of goods sold.

Given that revenue is $140 per unit, the gross profit on the newly purchased units is 2 units × $20 = $40. 
Since the cost of the old unit is only $80, the gross profit on this one unit is $60 ($140 − $80) instead of 
$20, raising total gross profit to $100. The complete income statement effects are reflected below.

This $40 change is the pretax effect of the LIFO liquidation. Given the assumed tax rate of 25 percent, 
taxes paid are $10 (0.25 × $40) higher than if no liquidation had taken place.
In practice, LIFO liquidations and extra tax payments can be avoided even if purchases of additional 
inventory take place after the sale of the item it replaces. Tax law allows LIFO to be applied as if all 
purchases during an accounting period took place before any sales and cost of goods sold were recorded. 
Thus, temporary LIFO liquidations can be eliminated by purchasing additional inventory before year-
end. Most companies apply LIFO in this manner.
Chapter Supplement B
FIFO and LIFO Cost of Goods Sold under Periodic versus  
Perpetual Inventory Systems
The purpose of this supplement is to compare the calculation of FIFO and LIFO cost of goods sold under 
a periodic versus a perpetual inventory system. As we noted in the chapter, calculations of FIFO cost of 
goods sold will always be the same under both systems. However, calculations of LIFO cost of goods 
sold will usually differ in a manner that causes the company to pay higher income taxes when inventory 
costs are rising if it uses the perpetual computation. Consider the following company purchase and sale 
data for the month of January. Note that beginning inventory is 2,000 units, purchases are 14,000 units, 
and sales are 9,000 units.

FIFO assumes that the oldest goods are the first ones sold. Using a periodic inventory calculation, the 
9,000 oldest goods available during the month would include the 2,000 in beginning inventory, the 
6,000 purchased on January 13, and 1,000 of the units purchased January 25. Cost of goods sold would 
be calculated as follows:

Note that cost of goods sold is $198,300 using both computations. This is true because the oldest goods 
available during the month are the same as the oldest goods available at the time of each sale. This will 
always be true.
LIFO (Last-in, First-out)
LIFO assumes that the newest goods are the first ones sold. Using a periodic inventory calculation, the 
9,000 newest goods available during the month would include the 8,000 units purchased January 25 
and 1,000 of the units purchased on January 13. Cost of goods sold would be calculated as follows:

Note that cost of goods sold is higher using the periodic computation. This is true because the newest 
goods available during the month are not the same as the newest goods available at the time of each sale. 
When costs are rising, the periodic calculation will always produce the same or a higher value for 
cost of goods sold than the perpetual calculation. In this case, the periodic calculation gives you a 
$10,700 higher value for cost of goods sold ($222,800 − $212,100). This higher value will result in a 
$10,700 lower amount for income before taxes. If the tax rate is 35 percent, the company would end up 
paying $3,745 less in taxes for the current year (0.35 × $10,700).
Why You Won’t See LIFO Perpetual Calculations in Practice
This added tax savings from the periodic calculation illustrated above is one of the two reasons you will 
rarely if ever see LIFO perpetual calculations in practice in medium- to large-sized companies. The other 
reason relates to the complexity and cost of the calculations. Even if a company’s perpetual inventory 
information system is sophisticated enough to instantaneously record the arrival of new inventory, it 
is unlikely that it will have sufficient information concerning invoice pricing, returns, allowances, and 
discounts to instantaneously compute a unit cost for those goods. Also, consider the number of calcula-
tions of goods available for sale that would have to be made by a company that has numerous sales and 
purchases of many different inventory items. This makes it very costly or impossible for most companies 
to apply LIFO using a perpetual calculation. Instead, companies keep perpetual inventory records on a 
FIFO basis and then make an end-of-period adjusting entry using the periodic calculation to convert both 
inventory on the balance sheet and cost of goods sold on the income statement to a LIFO basis.

Purchase Discounts
Cash discounts must be accounted for by both the seller and the buyer (accounting by the seller was 
discussed in Chapter 6). When merchandise is bought on credit, terms such as 2/10, n/30 are sometimes 
specified. That is, if payment is made within 10 days from the date of purchase, a 2 percent cash discount 
known as the purchase discount is granted. If payment is not made within the discount period, the full 
invoice cost is due 30 days after the purchase.
Assume that on January 17, Harley-Davidson bought goods that had a $1,000 invoice price 
with terms 2/10, n/30. The purchase would be recorded as follows (using what is called the gross 
method):

7-1. Apply the cost principle to identify the amounts that should be included in inventory and the 
expense matching principle to determine cost of goods sold for typical retailers, wholesalers, 
and manufacturers.  p. 335
Inventory should include all items owned that are held for resale. Costs flow into inventory when 
goods are purchased or manufactured. They flow out (as an expense) when they are sold or disposed 
of. In conformity with the expense matching principle, the total cost of the goods sold during the 
period must be matched with the sales revenue earned during the period. A company can keep track 
of the ending inventory and cost of goods sold for the period using (1) the perpetual inventory sys-
tem, which is based on the maintenance of detailed and continuous inventory records, and (2) the 
periodic inventory system, which is based on a physical count of ending inventory and use of the 
cost of goods sold equation to determine cost of goods sold.
 
7-2. Report inventory and cost of goods sold using the four inventory costing methods.  p. 340
The chapter discussed four different inventory costing methods used to allocate costs between the 
units remaining in inventory and the units sold and their applications in different economic circum-
stances. The methods discussed were specific identification, FIFO, LIFO, and average cost. Each of 
the inventory costing methods conforms to GAAP. Public companies using LIFO must provide note 
disclosures that allow conversion of inventory and cost of goods sold to FIFO amounts. Remember 
that the cost flow assumption need not match the physical flow of inventory.
 
7-3. Decide when the use of different inventory costing methods is beneficial to a company.  p. 345
The selection of an inventory costing method is important because it will affect reported income, 
income tax expense (and hence cash flow), and the inventory valuation reported on the balance 
sheet. In a period of rising prices, FIFO normally results in higher income and higher taxes than 
LIFO; in a period of falling prices, the opposite occurs. The choice of methods is normally made to 
minimize taxes.
 
7-4. Report inventory at the lower of cost or market (LCM).  p. 348
Ending inventory should be measured based on the lower of actual cost or net realizable value 
(LCM basis). This practice can have a major effect on the statements of companies facing declining 
costs. Damaged, obsolete, and out-of-season inventory should also be written down to their current 
estimated net realizable value if below cost. The LCM adjustment increases cost of goods sold, 
decreases income, and decreases reported inventory in the year of the write-down.
 
7-5. Evaluate inventory management using the inventory turnover ratio.  p. 349
The inventory turnover ratio measures the efficiency of inventory management. It reflects how 
many times average inventory was produced and sold during the period. Analysts and creditors 
watch this ratio because a sudden decline may mean that a company is facing an unexpected drop in 
demand for its products or is becoming sloppy in its production management.
 
7-6. Compare companies that use different inventory costing methods.  p. 350
These comparisons can be made by converting the LIFO company’s statements to FIFO. Public com-
panies using LIFO must disclose the differences between LIFO and FIFO values for beginning and 
ending inventory. These amounts are often called the LIFO reserve. The beginning LIFO reserve minus 
the ending LIFO reserve equals the difference in cost of goods sold under FIFO. Pretax income is 
affected by the same amount in the opposite direction. This amount times the tax rate is the tax effect.
 
7-7. Understand methods for controlling inventory, analyze the effects of inventory errors on 
financial statements, and analyze the effects of inventory on cash flows.  p. 353
Various control procedures can limit inventory theft or mismanagement. An error in the measure-
ment of ending inventory affects cost of goods sold on the current period’s income statement and 
ending inventory on the balance sheet. Because this year’s ending inventory becomes next year’s 
beginning inventory, it also affects cost of goods sold in the following period by the same amount 
but in the opposite direction. These relationships can be seen through the cost of goods sold equa-
tion (BI + P − EI = CGS). When a net decrease in inventory for the period occurs, sales are more 
than purchases; thus, the decrease must be added in computing cash flows from operations. When 
a net increase in inventory for the period occurs, sales are less than purchases; thus, the increase 
must be subtracted in computing cash flows from operations.

In this and previous chapters, we discussed the current assets of a business. These assets are critical to 
operations, but many of them do not directly produce value. In Chapter 8, we will discuss the noncurrent 
assets property, plant, and equipment; intangibles that are the elements of productive capacity; and natural 
resources. Many of the noncurrent assets produce value, such as a factory that manufactures cars. These 
assets present some interesting accounting problems because they benefit a number of accounting periods.

Analyzing Items to Be Included in Inventory
Based on its physical count of inventory in its warehouse at year-end, December 31 of the current year, 
Madison Company planned to report inventory of $34,500. During the audit, the independent CPA devel-
oped the following additional information:
 
a. Goods from a supplier costing $700 are in transit with UPS on December 31 of the current year. The 
terms are FOB shipping point (explained in the “Required” section). Because these goods had not yet 
arrived, they were excluded from the physical inventory count.
 
b. Madison delivered samples costing $1,800 to a customer on December 27 of the current year, with the 
understanding that they would be returned to Madison on January 15 of the next year. Because these 
goods were not on hand, they were excluded from the inventory count.
 
c. On December 31 of the current year, goods in transit to customers, with terms FOB shipping point, 
amounted to $6,500 (expected delivery date January 10 of the next year). Because the goods had been 
shipped, they were excluded from the physical inventory count.
 
d. On December 31 of the current year, goods in transit to customers, with terms FOB destination, 
amounted to $1,500 (expected delivery date January 10 of the next year). Because the goods had been 
shipped, they were excluded from the physical inventory count.
Required:
Madison’s accounting policy requires including in inventory all goods for which it has title. Note that the 
point where title (ownership) changes hands is determined by the shipping terms in the sales contract. 
When goods are shipped “FOB shipping point,” title changes hands at shipment and the buyer normally 
pays for shipping. When they are shipped “FOB destination,” title changes hands on delivery, and the 
seller normally pays for shipping. Begin with the $34,500 inventory amount and compute the correct 
amount for the ending inventory. Explain the basis for your treatment of each of the preceding items.

Analyzing Items to Be Included in Inventory
Travis Company has just completed a physical inventory count at year-end, December 31 of the current 
year. Only the items on the shelves, in storage, and in the receiving area were counted and costed on a 
FIFO basis. The inventory amounted to $80,000. During the audit, the independent CPA developed the 
following additional information:
 
a. Goods costing $900 were being used by a customer on a trial basis and were excluded from the inven-
tory count at December 31 of the current year.
 
b. Goods in transit on December 31 of the current year, from a supplier, with terms FOB destination 
(explained in the “Required” section), cost $900. Because these goods had not yet arrived, they were 
excluded from the physical inventory count.
 
c. On December 31 of the current year, goods in transit to customers, with terms FOB shipping point, 
amounted to $1,700 (expected delivery date January 10 of next year). Because the goods had been 
shipped, they were excluded from the physical inventory count.
 
d. On December 28 of the current year, a customer purchased goods for cash amounting to $2,650 and 
left them “for pickup on January 3 of next year.” Travis Company had paid $1,750 for the goods and, 
because they were on hand, included the latter amount in the physical inventory count.
 
e. On the date of the inventory count, the company received notice from a supplier that goods ordered 
earlier at a cost of $3,550 had been delivered to the transportation company on December 27 of the 
current year; the terms were FOB shipping point. Because the shipment had not arrived by December 
31 of the current year, it was excluded from the physical inventory count.
 f. On December 31 of the current year, the company shipped $700 worth of goods to a customer, FOB 
destination. The goods are expected to arrive at their destination no earlier than January 8 of next 
year. Because the goods were not on hand, they were not included in the physical inventory count.
 
g. One of the items sold by the company has such a low volume that management planned to drop it last 
year. To induce Travis Company to continue carrying the item, the manufacturer-supplier provided 
the item on a “consignment basis.” This means that the manufacturer-supplier retains ownership of 
the item, and Travis Company (the consignee) has no responsibility to pay for the items until they are 
sold to a customer. Each month, Travis Company sends a report to the manufacturer on the number 
sold and remits cash for the cost. At the end of December of the current year, Travis Company had six 
of these items on hand; therefore, they were included in the physical inventory count at $950 each.

C HAP TER  7   Reporting and Interpreting Cost of Goods Sold and Inventory
Required:
Assume that Travis’s accounting policy requires including in inventory all goods for which it has title. 
Note that the point where title (ownership) changes hands is determined by the shipping terms in the sales 
contract. When goods are shipped “FOB shipping point,” title changes hands at shipment and the buyer 
normally pays for shipping. When they are shipped “FOB destination,” title changes hands on delivery, 
and the seller normally pays for shipping. Begin with the $80,000 inventory amount and compute the cor-
rect amount for the ending inventory. Explain the basis for your treatment of each of the preceding items. 
(Hint: Set up three columns: Item, Amount, and Explanation.)

Required:
 1. Compute the inventory turnover ratio based on two different assumptions:
 
a. Those presented in the preceding table (a decrease in the balance in inventory).
 
b. No change from the beginning-of-the-year inventory balance.
 2. Compute the effect of the projected change in the balance in inventory on cash flow from operating 
activities for the year (indicate the sign and amount of effect).
 3. On the basis of the preceding analysis, write a brief memo explaining how an increase in inven-

increase can benefit the company.
Evaluating the Choice between LIFO and FIFO Based on an Inventory Note
An annual report for International Paper Company included the following note:
The last-in, first-out inventory method is used to value most of International Paper’s U.S. inventories . . .  
If the first-in, first-out method had been used, it would have increased total inventory balances by 
approximately $350 million and $334 million at December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

For the year 2011, International Paper Company reported net income (after taxes) of $1,341 million. At 
December 31, 2011, the balance of International Paper Company’s retained earnings account was $3,330 
million.
Required:
 1. Determine the amount of net income that International Paper would have reported in 2011 if it had 
used the FIFO method (assume a 30 percent tax rate).
 2. Determine the amount of retained earnings that International Paper would have reported at the end 
of 2011 if it always had used the FIFO method (assume a 30 percent tax rate).
 3. Use of the LIFO method reduced the amount of taxes that International Paper had to pay in 2011 
compared with the amount that would have been paid if International Paper had used FIFO. Calcu-
late the amount of this reduction (assume a 30 percent tax rate).

Using Financial Reports: Interpreting the Effect of Charging Costs to Inventory as Opposed 
to Current Operating Expenses
Dana Holding Corporation designs and manufactures component parts for the vehicular, industrial, 
and mobile off-highway original equipment markets. In a recent annual report, Dana’s inventory note 
indicated the following:
Dana changed its method of accounting for inventories effective January 1 . . . to include 
in inventory certain production-related costs previously charged to expense. This change 
in accounting principle resulted in a better matching of costs against related revenues. The 
effect of this change in accounting increased inventories by $23.0 and net income by $12.9.
Required:
 1. Under Dana’s previous accounting method, certain production costs were recognized as expenses on 
the income statement in the period they were incurred. When will they be recognized under the new 
accounting method?
 2. Explain how including these costs in inventory increased both inventories and net income for the year.
Using Financial Reports: Interpreting Effects of the LIFO/FIFO Choice on Inventory 
Turnover
In its annual report, Caterpillar, Inc., a major manufacturer of farm and construction equipment, reported 
the following information concerning its inventories:
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally determined using 
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The value of inventories on the LIFO basis represented 
about 65% of total inventories at December 31, 2011, and about 70% of total inventories at 
December 31, 2010 and 2009.
If the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method had been in use, inventories would have been 
$2,422 million, $2,575 million, and $3,022 million higher than reported at December 31, 
2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Making a Decision as a Financial Analyst: Analysis of the Effect of a Change to LIFO
A press release for Seneca Foods (licensee of the Libby’s brand of canned fruits and vegetables) included 
the following information:
The current year’s net earnings were $8,019,000 or $0.65 per diluted share, compared 
with $32,067,000 or $2.63 per diluted share, last year. These results reflect the Company’s 
decision to implement the LIFO (last-in, first-out) inventory valuation method effective 
December 30, 2007 (fourth quarter). The effect of this change was to reduce annual pre-
tax earnings by $28,165,000 and net earnings by $18,307,000 or $1.50 per share ($1.49 
diluted) below that which would have been reported using the Company’s previous inven-
tory method. The Company believes that in this period of significant inflation, the use of 
the LIFO method better matches current costs with current revenues. This change also 
results in cash savings of $9,858,000 by reducing the Company’s income taxes, based on 
statutory rates. If the Company had remained on the FIFO (first-in, first-out) inventory 
valuation method, the pretax results, less non-operating gains and losses, would have been 
an all-time record of $42,644,000, up from $40,009,000 in the prior year.
Required:
As a new financial analyst at a leading Wall Street investment banking firm, you are assigned to write 
a memo outlining the effects of the accounting change on Seneca’s financial statements. Assume a 35 
percent tax rate. In your report, be sure to include the following:
 1. Why did management adopt LIFO?
 2. By how much did the change affect pretax earnings and ending inventory? Verify that the amount of 
the tax savings listed in the press release is correct.
 3. As an analyst, how would you react to the decrease in income caused by the adoption of LIFO? 
Consider all of the information in the press release.

Property, Plant, and Equipment;

A
s of December 31, 2014, Southwest Airlines operated 665 Boeing 737 aircraft, provid-
ing service to 93 domestic and international destinations, and was the largest U.S. air 
carrier in number of originating passengers boarded. Southwest is a capital-intensive 
company with more than $14 billion in property, plant, and equipment reported on its balance 
sheet. In fiscal year 2014, Southwest spent nearly $1.8 billion on aircraft and other flight 
equipment as well as ground equipment. Since the demand for air travel is seasonal, with peak 
demand occurring during the summer months, planning for optimal productive capacity in the 
airline industry is very difficult. Southwest’s managers must determine how many aircraft are 
needed in which cities at what points in time to fill all seats demanded. Otherwise, the com-
pany loses revenue (not enough seats) or incurs higher costs (too many seats).
Demand is also highly sensitive to general economic conditions and other events beyond 
the control of the company. Even the best corporate planners could not have predicted the 
September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States that rocked the airline 
industry. The war in Iraq led to further declines in the demand for air travel. In response to 


chapter 8
the precipitous drop in demand, many airlines accelerated retirement of various 
aircraft, temporarily grounded aircraft, and considered delaying the purchase of 
new aircraft. Then, a worsening global economic environment provided more chal-
lenges for the airline industry. With fuel prices more than tripling between 2000 
and 2014, many carriers were forced to reduce capacity.
U ND ERSTA ND ING  T H E B USI N E SS
One of the major challenges managers of most businesses face is forecasting the 
company’s long-term productive capacity—that is, predicting the amount of plant 
and equipment it will need. If managers underestimate the need, the company will 
not be able to produce enough goods or services to meet demand and will miss an 
opportunity to earn revenue. On the other hand, if they overestimate the need, 
the company will incur excessive costs that will reduce its profitability.
The airline industry provides an outstanding example of the difficulty of plan-
ning for and analyzing productive capacity. If an airplane takes off from Kansas 
City, Missouri, en route to New York City with empty seats, the economic value 
associated with those seats is lost for that flight. There is obviously no way to sell 
the seat to a customer after the airplane has left the gate. Unlike a manufacturer, 
an airline cannot “inventory” seats for the future.
Likewise, if an unexpectedly large number of people want to board a flight, the 
airline must turn away some customers. You might be willing to buy a television 
set from Best Buy even if you had to wait one week for delivery, but you probably 
wouldn’t book a flight home on Thanksgiving weekend on an airline that told you 
no seats were available. You would simply pick another airline or use a different 
mode of transportation.

mentions that the company “currently competes with other airlines on virtually all of South-
west’s scheduled routes.”
Much of the battle for passengers in the airline industry is fought in terms of property, 
plant, and equipment. Passengers want convenient schedules (which requires a large number 
of aircraft), and they want to fly on new, modern airplanes. Because airlines have such a large 
investment in equipment but no opportunity to inventory unused seats, they work very hard 
to fill their aircraft to capacity for each flight. Southwest’s Annual Report for 2014 describes 
the keys to its ability to offer lower fares and generous frequent flyer benefits.

As you can see from this discussion, issues surrounding property, plant, and equipment 
have a pervasive impact on a company in terms of strategy, pricing decisions, and profitabil-
ity. Managers devote considerable time to planning optimal levels of productive capacity, and 
financial analysts closely review a company’s statements to determine the impact of manage-
ment’s decisions.
This chapter is organized according to the life cycle of long-lived assets—acquisition, use, 
and disposal. First, we will discuss the measuring and reporting issues related to land, build-
ings, and equipment. Then we will discuss the measurement and reporting issues for intan-
gible assets and natural resources. Among the issues we will discuss are the maintenance, 
use, and disposal of property and equipment over time and the measurement and reporting of 
assets considered impaired in their ability to generate future cash flows.
A key component of the Company’s business strategy has historically been its low-cost structure,
which was designed to allow Southwest to profitably charge low fares. Adjusted for stage length,
Southwest has lower unit costs, on average, than the vast majority of major domestic carriers. The
Company’s low-cost structure has historically been facilitated by Southwest’s use of a single
aircraft type, the Boeing 737, an operationally efficient point-to-point route structure, and highly
productive Employees. Southwest’s use of a single aircraft type has allowed for simplified
scheduling, maintenance, flight operations, and training activities.

Exhibit 8.1 shows the asset section of the balance sheet from Southwest’s annual report for the 
fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. Over 70 percent of Southwest’s total assets are flight and 
ground equipment. Southwest also reports other assets with probable long-term benefits. Let’s 
begin by classifying these assets.
Classifying Long-Lived Assets
The resources that determine a company’s productive capacity are often called long-lived 
assets. These assets, which are listed as noncurrent assets on the balance sheet, may be either 
tangible or intangible and have the following characteristics:
 
1. Tangible assets have physical substance; that is, they can be touched. The three kinds of 
long-lived tangible assets are:
a. Land used in operations. As is the case with Southwest, land often is not shown as a 
separate item on the balance sheet.
b. Buildings, fixtures, and equipment used in operations. For Southwest, this category includes 
aircraft, ground equipment to service the aircraft, and office space. (Note: Land, buildings, 
fixtures, and equipment are also called property, plant, and equipment or fixed assets.)
c. Natural resources used in operations. Southwest does not report any natural resources 
on its balance sheet. However, companies in other industries report natural resources 
such as timber tracts and silver mines.
 
2. Intangible assets are long-lived assets without physical substance that confer specific rights 
on their owner. Examples are patents, copyrights, franchises, licenses, and trademarks. 
Southwest reports $970 million of goodwill on its balance sheet.
Measuring and Recording Acquisition Cost
Under the cost principle, all reasonable and necessary expenditures made in acquiring 
and preparing an asset for use (or sale, as in the case of inventory) should be recorded as 
the cost of the asset. We say that the expenditures are capitalized when they are recorded as 
part of the cost of an asset instead of as expenses in the current period. Any sales taxes, legal

fees, transportation costs, and installation costs are then added to the purchase price of the 
asset. However, special discounts are subtracted and any interest charges associated with the 
purchase are expensed as incurred.

INTERPRETATIONS
In General The fixed asset turnover ratio measures the sales dollars generated by each dollar of fixed 
assets used. A high rate normally suggests effective management. An increasing rate over time signals 
more efficient fixed asset use. Creditors and security analysts use this ratio to assess a company’s effec-
tiveness in generating sales from its fixed assets.
Focus Company Analysis Southwest’s fixed asset turnover ratio increased between 2012 and 2014. 
Although at first glance it appears that Southwest is less efficient than Delta and United Continental 
Holdings, this is not the case. Their higher fixed asset turnover is due to the greater age of their fleet (a 
higher percentage has been depreciated) and the fact that more planes are leased in such a way that they 
do not appear as fixed assets on the balance sheet.
A Few Cautions A lower or declining fixed asset turnover rate may indicate that a company is expand-
ing (by acquiring additional productive assets) in anticipation of higher future sales. An increasing ratio 
could also signal that a firm has cut back on capital expenditures due to a downturn in business. This is 
not the case at Southwest, which continues to expand its fleet. As a consequence, appropriate interpreta-
tion of the fixed asset turnover ratio requires an investigation of related activities.
*[Beginning + Ending Fixed Asset Balance (net of accumulated depreciation)] ÷ 2.
In addition to purchasing buildings and equipment, a company may acquire undeveloped 
land, typically with the intent to build a new factory or office building. When a company pur-
chases land, all of the incidental costs of the purchase, such as title fees, sales commissions, 
legal fees, title insurance, delinquent taxes, and surveying fees, should be included in its cost.
Sometimes a company purchases an old building or used machinery for the business opera-
tions. Renovation and repair costs incurred by the company prior to the asset’s use should be 
included as a part of its cost. Also, when purchasing land, buildings, and equipment as a group 
(known as a basket purchase), the total cost is allocated to each asset in proportion to the asset’s 
market value relative to the total market value of the assets as a whole.

For the sake of illustration, let’s assume that Southwest purchased a new 737 aircraft from 
 
Boeing on January 1, 2017 (the beginning of Southwest’s fiscal year), for a list price of $78 million. 
Let’s also assume that Boeing offered Southwest a discount of $4 million for signing the purchase 
agreement. That means the price of the new plane to Southwest would actually be $74 million. In 
addition, Southwest paid $200,000 to have the plane delivered and $800,000 to prepare the new 
plane for use. The amount recorded for the purchase, called the acquisition cost, is the net cash 
amount paid for the asset or, when noncash assets are used as payment, the fair value of the asset 
given or asset received, whichever can be more clearly determined (called the cash equivalent 
price). Southwest would calculate the acquisition cost of the new aircraft as follows:
Invoice price
$78,000,000
Less: Discount from Boeing
    
 
 
 
4,000,000

  800,000

$75,000,000
For Cash
Assuming that Southwest paid cash for the aircraft and related transportation and costs, the 
transaction is recorded as follows:

It might seem unusual for Southwest to pay cash to purchase new assets that cost $75 mil-
lion, but this is often the case. When it acquires productive assets, a company may pay with 
cash that was generated from operations or cash recently borrowed. It also is possible for the 
seller to finance the purchase on credit.
For Debt
Now let’s assume that Southwest signed a note payable for the new aircraft and paid cash for 
the transportation and preparation costs. In that case, Southwest would record the following 
journal entry:

Commercial airlines often utilize financing schemes that include leasing aircraft. Shorter-
term leases, called operating leases, provide airlines with flexibility in managing fleet size and

obsolescence, which can occur with changes in environmental and noise-level laws in various 
countries. Operating leases are not reported on the balance sheet as liabilities and the assets are not 
included in fixed assets. On the other hand, longer-term leases, called financing leases or capital 
leases, are in essence the acquisition of assets that are reported on the balance sheet along with 
the lease obligations, allowing for companies to take advantage of tax benefits. At  
December 31, 
2014, Southwest Airlines disclosed the following regarding its leasing commitments:
Additional discussion of leases is provided in Chapter 9.
For Equity (or Other Noncash Considerations)
Noncash consideration, such as the company’s common stock or a right given by the company 
to the seller to purchase the company’s goods or services at a special price, might also be part 
of the transaction. When noncash consideration is included in the purchase of an asset, the 
cash-equivalent cost (fair value of the asset given or received) is determined.
Assume that Southwest gave Boeing 1,000,000 shares of its $1.00 par value common stock 
with a market value of $50 per share and paid the balance in cash. The journal entry and trans-
action effects follow:

We just learned how to measure the cost of operational assets acquired under various methods. In gen-
eral, all necessary and reasonable costs to ready the asset for its intended use are part of the cost of the 
asset. Assets can be acquired with cash, with debt, and/or with the company’s stock (at market value).

It’s your turn to apply these concepts by answering the following questions. In a recent year, 
 
McDonald’s Corporation purchased property, plant, and equipment priced at $2.7 billion. Assume 
that the company also paid $216 million for sales tax; $20 million for transportation costs; $12 million 
for installation and preparation of the property, plant, and equipment before use; and $1 million in 
maintenance contracts to cover repairs to the property, plant, and equipment during use.

associated with construction, such as labor, materials, and, in most situations, a portion of 
the interest incurred during the construction period, called capitalized interest. The amount 
of interest expense that is capitalized is recorded by debiting the asset and crediting cash when 
the interest is paid. The amount of interest to be capitalized is a complex computation dis-
cussed in detail in other accounting courses.
Capitalizing labor, materials, and a portion of interest expense has the effect of increas-
ing assets, decreasing expenses, and increasing net income. Let’s assume Southwest con-
structed a new hangar, paying $600,000 in labor costs and $1,300,000 in supplies and 
materials. Southwest also paid $100,000 in interest expense during the year related to the

Repairs, Maintenance, and Improvements
Most assets require substantial expenditures during their lives to maintain or enhance their 
productive capacity. These expenditures include cash outlays for ordinary repairs and main-
tenance, major repairs, replacements, and additions. Expenditures that are made after an asset 
has been acquired are classified as follows:
 
1. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expenditures that maintain the productive capac-
ity of the asset during the current accounting period only. These expenditures are recurring 
in nature, involve relatively small amounts at each occurrence, and do not directly increase 
the productive life, operating efficiency, or capacity of the asset. These cash outlays are 
recorded as expenses in the current period.
In the case of Southwest Airlines, examples of ordinary repairs would include changing the 
oil in the aircraft engines, replacing the lights in the control panels, and fixing torn fabric on pas-
senger seats. Although the cost of individual ordinary repairs is relatively small, in the aggregate 
these expenditures can be substantial. In 2014, Southwest paid $978 million for aircraft mainte-
nance and repairs. This amount was reported as an expense on its income statement. The follow-
ing summary entry represents how these expenditures would have been recorded by Southwest:

2. Improvements are expenditures that increase the productive life, operating efficiency, 
or capacity of the asset. These capital expenditures are added to the appropriate asset 
accounts (that is, they are capitalized). They occur infrequently, involve large amounts of 
money, and increase an asset’s economic usefulness in the future through either increased 
efficiency or longer life. Examples include additions, major overhauls, complete recondi-
tioning, and major replacements and improvements, such as the complete replacement of an 
engine on an aircraft.
Assume that Southwest spent $300 million in 2016 to modify the exterior of its aircraft to 
reduce fuel consumption, resulting in 9 percent greater fuel efficiency and lower operating 
costs. The summary entry below represents how these expenditures would have been recorded 
by Southwest:

In many cases, no clear line distinguishes 
improvements (assets) from ordinary repairs 
and maintenance (expenses). In these situations, 
managers must exercise professional judgment 
and make a subjective decision. Capitalizing 
expenses will increase assets and net income in 
the current year, lowering future years’ income 
by the amount of the annual depreciation. On 
the other hand, for tax purposes, expensing the 
amount in the current period will lower taxes 
immediately. Because the decision to capital-
ize or expense is subjective, auditors review the 
items reported as capital expenditures and ordi-
nary repairs and maintenance closely.
To avoid spending too much time clas-
sifying additions and improvements (capital 
expenditures) and repair expenses (revenue 
expenditures), some companies develop sim-
ple policies to govern the accounting for these 
expenditures. For example, one large computer 
company expenses all individual items that cost 
less than $1,000. Such policies are acceptable 
because immaterial (relatively small dollar) 
amounts will not affect users’ decisions when 
analyzing financial statements.
IMPROVEMENTS 
Expenditures that increase 
the productive life, operating 
efficiency, or capacity of an asset 
and are recorded as increases in 
asset accounts, not as expenses.

Depreciation Concepts
Except for land, which is considered to have an unlimited life, a long-lived asset with a limited 
useful life, such as an airplane, represents the prepaid cost of a bundle of future services or 
benefits. The expense principle requires that a portion of an asset’s cost be allocated as an 
expense in the same period that revenues are generated by its use. Southwest Airlines earns 
When expenditures that should be recorded as current period expenses are improperly capitalized as 
part of the cost of an asset, the effects on the financial statements can be enormous. In one of the largest 
accounting frauds in history, WorldCom (now part of Verizon) inflated its income and cash flows from 
operations by billions of dollars in just such a scheme. This fraud turned WorldCom’s actual losses into 
large profits.
Over five quarters in 2001 and 2002, the company initially announced that it had capitalized $3.8

that should have been recorded as operating expenses. By early 2004, auditors discovered $74.4 billion in 
necessary restatements (reductions to previously reported pretax income) for 2000 and 2001.
Accounting for expenses as capital expenditures increases current income because it spreads a single 
period’s operating expenses over many future periods as depreciation expense. It increases cash flows 
from operations by moving cash outflows from the operating section to the investing section of the cash 
flow statement.

revenue when it provides air travel service and incurs an expense when using its aircraft to 
generate the revenue.
The term used to identify the matching of the cost of using buildings and equipment with 
the revenues they generate is depreciation. Thus, depreciation is the process of allocating 
the cost of buildings and equipment over their productive lives using a systematic and 
rational method.
Students often are confused by the concept of depreciation as accountants use it. In account-
ing, depreciation is a process of cost allocation, not a process of determining an asset’s cur-
rent market value or worth. When an asset is depreciated, the remaining balance sheet amount 
probably does not represent its current market value. On balance sheets subsequent to 
acquisition, the undepreciated cost is not measured on a market or fair value basis.
An adjusting journal entry is needed at the end of each period to reflect the use of buildings 
and equipment for the period:
Depreciation Expense (+E, -SE)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The amount of depreciation recorded during each period is reported on the income statement 
as Depreciation Expense. The amount of depreciation expense accumulated since the acquisi-
tion date is reported on the balance sheet as a contra-account, Accumulated  
Depreciation, and 
deducted from the related asset’s cost. The net amount on the balance sheet is called net book 
value or carrying value. The net book value (or carrying or book value) of a long-lived 
asset is its acquisition cost less the accumulated depreciation from the acquisition date to the 
 
balance sheet date.

Some analysts compare the book value of assets to their original cost as an approximation of their 
remaining life. If the book value of an asset is 100 percent of its cost, it is a new asset; if the book value is 
25 percent of its cost, the asset has about 25 percent of its estimated life remaining. In Southwest’s case, 
the book value of its property and equipment is 63 percent of its original cost, compared to 71 percent for 
United Continental and 78 percent for JetBlue Airways.
This comparison suggests that Southwest’s flight equipment is older than the equipment at JetBlue 
and United Continental. This comparison is only a rough approximation and is influenced by some of the 
accounting issues discussed in the next section.

From Exhibit 8.1 in the previous section, we see that Southwest’s acquisition cost for prop-
erty and equipment is $22,513 million at the end of 2014. The accumulated depreciation and 
amortization on the property and equipment is $8,221 million (amortization is the name for 
allocating costs of intangible assets and is discussed later in the chapter). Thus, the book value 
is reported at $14,292 million. Southwest also reported depreciation and amortization expense 
of $938 million on its income statement for 2014.
To calculate depreciation expense, three amounts are required for each asset:
 
1. Acquisition cost.
 
2. Estimated useful life to the company.
 
3. Estimated residual (or salvage) value at the end of the asset’s useful life to the company.
Notice that the asset’s useful life and residual value are estimates. Therefore, depreciation 
expense is an estimate.
Estimated useful life represents management’s estimate of the asset’s useful economic life 
to the company rather than its total economic life to all potential users. The asset’s expected 
physical life is often longer than the company intends to use the asset. Economic life may be 
ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE

asset to the present owner.

expressed in terms of years or units of capacity, such as the number of hours a machine is 
expected to operate or the number of units it can produce. Southwest’s aircraft fleet is expected 
to fly for more than 25 years, but Southwest wants to offer its customers a high level of ser-
vice by replacing its older aircraft with modern equipment. For accounting purposes, South-
west uses a 23- to 25-year estimated useful life. The subsequent owner of the aircraft (likely a 
regional airline) would use an estimated useful life based on its own policies.
Differences in Estimated Lives  
within a Single Industry
Notes to recent actual financial statements of various airline companies reveal the following estimates for 
the useful lives of flight equipment:
Company
Estimated Life (in years)
Southwest
23 to 25
United Continental
25 to 30
Singapore Airlines
15
The differences in the estimated lives may be attributed to a number of factors such as the type of 
aircraft used by each company, equipment replacement plans, operational differences, and the degree 
of management’s conservatism. In addition, given the same type of aircraft, companies that plan to use 
the equipment over fewer years may estimate higher residual values than companies that plan to use the 
equipment longer. For example, Singapore Airlines uses a residual value of 10 percent over a relatively 
short useful life for its passenger aircraft, compared to as low as 5 percent for Delta Air Lines over as 
much as a 30-year useful life.
Differences in estimated lives and residual values of assets can have a significant impact on a com-
parison of the profitability of the competing companies. Analysts must be certain to identify the causes 
of differences in depreciable lives.
F I N A N C I A L 
A N A LYS I S
Residual (or salvage) value represents management’s estimate of the amount the company 
expects to recover upon disposal of the asset at the end of its estimated useful life. The residual 
value may be the estimated value of the asset as salvage or scrap or its expected value if sold 
to another user. In the case of Southwest’s aircraft, residual value may be the amount it expects 
to receive when it sells the asset to a small regional airline that operates older equipment. The 
notes to Southwest’s financial statements indicate that the company estimates residual value to 
be between 0 and 20 percent of the cost of the asset, depending on the asset.
Alternative Depreciation Methods
Because of significant differences among companies and the assets they own, accountants have 
not been able to agree on a single best method of depreciation. As a result, managers may 
choose from several acceptable depreciation methods that match depreciation expense with 
the revenues generated in a period. They may also choose different methods for specific assets 
or groups of assets. Once selected, the method should be applied consistently over time to 
enhance comparability of financial information. We will discuss the three most common depre-
ciation methods:
 
1. Straight-line (the most common, used by more than 98 percent of companies for many or all 
of their assets).
 
2. Units-of-production.
 
3. Declining-balance.
To illustrate each method, let’s assume that Southwest Airlines acquired a new service vehi-
cle (ground equipment) on January 1, 2016. The relevant information is shown in Exhibit 8.2.

Straight-Line Method
More companies, including Southwest, use straight-line depreciation in their financial state-
ments than all other methods combined. Under the straight-line method, an equal portion of an 
asset’s depreciable cost is allocated to each accounting period over its estimated useful life. Using 
the information in Exhibit 8.2, the formula to estimate annual depreciation expense follows:

In this formula, “Cost minus Residual Value” is the amount to be depreciated, also called the 
depreciable cost. The formula “1 ÷ Useful Life” is the straight-line rate. Using the data provided in 
Exhibit 8.2, the depreciation expense for Southwest’s new service vehicle would be $20,000 per year.
Companies often create a depreciation schedule that shows the computed amount of depre-
ciation expense each year over the entire useful life of the asset. You can use computerized 
spreadsheet programs, such as Excel, to create the depreciation schedule. Using the data in 
Exhibit 8.2 and the straight-line method, Southwest’s depreciation schedule follows:

Notice that

 Depreciation expense is a constant amount each year.

 Accumulated depreciation increases by an equal amount each year.

 Net book value decreases by the same amount each year until it equals the estimated residual 
value.
This is the reason for the name straight-line method. Notice, too, that the adjusting entry 
can be prepared from this schedule, and the effects on the income statement and balance sheet 
are known. Southwest Airlines uses the straight-line method for all of its assets. The company 
reported depreciation and amortization expense in the amount of $938 million for 2014, equal 
to 5 percent of the airline’s revenues for the year. Most companies in the airline industry use the 
straight-line method.
Units-of-Production Method
The units-of-production depreciation method relates depreciable cost to total estimated pro-
ductive output. The formula to estimate annual depreciation expense under this method is as 
follows:
Units-of-Production Formula:
 ($62,500  $2,500)

Dividing the depreciable cost by the estimated total production yields the depreciation 
rate per unit of production, which is then multiplied by the actual production for the period 
to determine depreciation expense. In our illustration, for every mile that the new vehicle is 
driven, Southwest would record depreciation expense of $0.60. Based on the information in 
Exhibit 8.2, the depreciation schedule for the service vehicle under the units-of-production 
method would appear as follows:

Notice that, from period to period, depreciation expense, accumulated depreciation, and 
book value vary directly with the units produced. In the units-of-production method, deprecia-
tion expense is a variable expense because it varies directly with production or use.
You might wonder what happens if the total estimated productive output differs from actual 
total output. Remember that the estimate is management’s best guess of total output. If any 
difference occurs at the end of the asset’s life, the final adjusting entry to depreciation expense 
should be for the amount needed to bring the asset’s net book value equal to the asset’s estimated 


404

residual value. For example, if, in 2018, Southwest’s service vehicle ran 25,000 actual miles, 
the same amount of depreciation expense, $12,000, would be recorded.
Although Southwest does not use the units-of-production method, the Exxon Mobil 
 
Corporation, a major energy company that explores, produces, transports, and sells crude oil 
and natural gas worldwide, does, as a note to the company’s annual report explains.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Summary of Accounting Policies
Property, Plant and Equipment. Depreciation, depletion and amortization, based on cost less
estimated salvage value of the asset, are primarily determined under either the
unit-of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset
service life taking obsolescence into consideration. . . . Acquisition costs of proved
properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis
of total proved oil and gas reserves.
REAL WORLD EXCERPT:  
2014 Annual Report
EXXONMOBIL
The units-of-production method is based on an estimate of an asset’s total future productive 
capacity or output, which is difficult to determine. This is another example of the degree of 
subjectivity inherent in accounting.
Declining-Balance Method
If an asset is considered to be more efficient or productive when it is newer, managers might 
choose the declining-balance depreciation method to match a higher depreciation expense 
with higher revenues in the early years of an asset’s life and a lower depreciation expense 
with lower revenues in the later years. We say, then, that this is an accelerated depreciation 
method. Although accelerated methods are seldom used for financial reporting purposes, the 
method that is used more frequently than others is the declining-balance method.
Declining-balance depreciation is based on applying a rate exceeding the straight-line rate 
to the asset’s net book value over time. The rate is often double (two times) the straight-line 
rate and is termed the double-declining-balance rate. For example, if the straight-line rate is 
10 percent (1 ÷ 10 years) for a 10-year estimated useful life, then the declining-balance rate is 
20 percent (2 × the straight-line rate). Other typical acceleration rates are 1.5 times and 1.75 
times. The double-declining-balance rate is adopted most frequently by companies employing 
an accelerated method, so we will use it in our illustration, with information from Exhibit 8.2.
DECLINING-BALANCE 
DEPRECIATION 
Method that allocates the 
net book value (cost minus 
accumulated depreciation) of an 
asset over its useful life based

an asset’s life.

increases over time 
There are two important differences between this method and the others described previously:
 
1. Notice that accumulated depreciation, not residual value, is included in the formula. Since 
accumulated depreciation increases each year, net book value (Cost minus Accumulated 
Depreciation) decreases. The double-declining rate is applied to a lower net book value each 
year, resulting in a decline in depreciation expense over time.


CHAPTER  8  Reporting and Interpreting Property, Plant, and Equipment; Intangibles; and Natural Resources
405
 
2. As with the other methods, the net book value should not be depreciated below the residual 
value:
  Occasionally, before the end of the estimated useful life, if the annual computation reduces 
net book value below residual value, only the amount of depreciation expense needed to 
make net book value equal to residual value is recorded, and no additional depreciation 
expense is computed in subsequent years.
  More likely, in the last year of the asset’s estimated useful life, whatever amount is needed to 
bring net book value to residual value is recorded, regardless of the amount of the computation.
Computation of double-declining-balance depreciation expense is illustrated in the depre-

The calculated depreciation expense for 2018 ($4,629) is not the same as the amount actu-
ally reported on the income statement ($4,444). An asset should never be depreciated below 
the point at which net book value equals its residual value. The asset owned by Southwest has 
an estimated residual value of $2,500. If depreciation expense were recorded in the amount of 
$4,629, the book value of the asset would be less than $2,500. The correct depreciation expense 
for year 2018 is therefore $4,444, the amount that will reduce the book value to exactly $2,500. 
To determine the amount to record in 2018, indicate the amount needed for net book value 
($2,500), determine what the balance in accumulated depreciation should be to yield the $60,000 
($62,500 cost − $2,500 residual value), and compute the amount of depreciation expense nec-
essary to increase the balance in accumulated depreciation to $60,000 ($60,000 balance needed 
in accumulated depreciation − $55,556 prior balance in accumulated depreciation).
Companies in industries that expect fairly rapid obsolescence of their equipment use the 
declining-balance method. Toyota is one of the companies that uses this method, as a note to 
its annual report shows.

As this note indicates, companies may use different depreciation methods for different 
classes of assets. Under the consistency principle, they are expected to apply the same methods 
to those assets over time.
In Summary
The three depreciation methods, computations, and the differences in depreciation expense 
over time for each method are summarized as follows:

Assume that you are comparing two companies that are exactly the same, except that one uses acceler-
ated depreciation and the other uses the straight-line method. Which company would you expect to report 
a higher net income? Actually, this question is a bit tricky. The answer is that you cannot say for certain 
which company’s income would be higher.
The accelerated methods report higher depreciation and therefore lower net income during the early 
years of an asset’s life. As the age of the asset increases, this effect reverses. Therefore, companies that 
use accelerated depreciation report lower depreciation expense and higher net income during the later 
years of an asset’s life. The nearby graph illustrates the pattern of depreciation over the life of an asset for 
the straight-line and declining-balance methods discussed in this chapter. When the curve for the acceler-
ated method falls below the line for the straight-line method, the accelerated method produces a higher 
net income than the straight-line method. However, total depreciation expense by the end of the asset’s 
life is the same for each method.
Users of financial statements must understand the impact of alternative depreciation methods used 
over time. Differences in depreciation methods rather than real economic differences can cause 
significant variation in reported net incomes.

How Managers Choose
Financial Reporting
For financial reporting purposes, corporate managers must determine which depreciation 
method provides the best matching of revenues and expenses for any given asset. If the asset 
is expected to provide benefits evenly over time, then the straight-line method is preferred. 
Managers also find this method to be easy to use and to explain. If no other method is more 
systematic or rational, then the straight-line method is selected. Also, during the early years of 
an asset’s life, the straight-line method reports higher income than the accelerated methods do. 
For these reasons, the straight-line method is, by far and away, the most common.
On the other hand, certain assets produce more revenue in their early lives because they are 
more efficient than in later years. In this case, managers select an accelerated method to allo-
cate cost.
Increased Profitability Due to an Accounting  
Adjustment? Reading the Notes
Financial analysts are particularly interested in changes in accounting estimates because they can have a 
large impact on a company’s before-tax operating income. In 2001, Singapore Airlines disclosed in its 
annual report that it had increased the estimated useful life of its aircraft from 10 to 15 years to reflect 
a change in its aircraft replacement policy. The change reduced depreciation expense for the year by 
$265 million and would reduce expenses by a similar amount each year over the remaining life of the 
 
aircraft. Analysts pay close attention to this number because it represents increased profitability due 
merely to an accounting adjustment.
F I N A N C I A L  
A N A LYS I S
Under IFRS, the cost of an individual asset’s components is allocated among each significant component 
and then depreciated separately over that component’s useful life. For example, British Airways (now 
merged into International Airlines Group) depreciates the body and engines over 18 to 25 years and the 
cabin interior modifications over 5 years.

Tax Reporting
Southwest Airlines, like most public companies, maintains two sets of accounting records. 
Both sets of records reflect the same transactions, but the transactions are accounted for using 
two different sets of measurement rules. One set is prepared under GAAP for reporting to 
stockholders. The other set is prepared to determine the company’s tax obligation under the 
Internal Revenue Code. The reason that the two sets of rules are different is simple: The objec-
tives of GAAP and the Internal Revenue Code differ.
Financial Reporting (GAAP)
Tax Reporting (IRC)
The objective of financial reporting is to provide 
economic information about a business that is useful 
in projecting future cash flows of the business. 
Financial reporting rules follow generally accepted 
accounting principles.
The objective of the Internal Revenue Code is to raise 
sufficient revenues to pay for the expenditures of the 
federal government. Many of the Code’s provisions 
are designed to encourage certain behaviors that 
are thought to benefit society (e.g., contributions 
to charities are made tax deductible to encourage 
people to support worthy programs).
In some cases, differences between the Internal Revenue Code and GAAP leave the manager 
no choice but to maintain separate records. In other cases, the differences are the result of man-
agement choice. When given a choice among acceptable tax accounting methods, managers 
apply what is called the least and the latest rule. All taxpayers want to pay the lowest amount 
of tax that is legally permitted and at the latest possible date. If you had the choice of paying 
$100,000 to the federal government at the end of this year or at the end of next year, you would 
choose the end of next year. By doing so, you could invest the money for an extra year and earn 
a significant return on the investment.
When they first learn that companies maintain two sets of books, some people question the ethics or 
legality of the practice. In reality, it is both legal and ethical to maintain separate records for tax and 
financial reporting purposes. However, these records must reflect the same transactions. Understat-
ing revenues or overstating expenses on a tax return can result in financial penalties and/or imprisonment. 
Accountants who aid tax evaders also can be fined or imprisoned and lose their professional licenses.
Two Sets of Books
A  Q U E ST I ON  
O F  E T HI CS
Similarly, by maintaining two sets of books, corporations can defer (delay) paying millions 
and sometimes billions of dollars in taxes. The following companies reported significant gross 
deferred tax obligations in 2014. Much of these deferrals were due to differences in asset cost 
allocation methods:

Percentage Due to Applying  
Different Cost Allocation Methods

PepsiCo
$7,348 million

Hertz
$3,685 million

Marriott International

Most corporations use the IRS-approved Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System 
(MACRS) to calculate depreciation expense for their tax returns. MACRS is similar to the 


CHAPTER  8  Reporting and Interpreting Property, Plant, and Equipment; Intangibles; and Natural Resources
409
declining-balance method and is applied over relatively short asset lives to yield high depre-
ciation expense in the early years. The high depreciation expense reported under MACRS 
reduces a corporation’s taxable income and therefore the amount it must pay in taxes. 
MACRS provides an incentive for corporations to invest in modern property, plant, and 
equipment in order to be competitive in world markets. However, it is not acceptable for 
financial reporting purposes.
Measuring Asset Impairment
As we discussed in Chapter 2, assets are defined as economic resources with probable future 
benefits acquired in an exchange transaction. On the date of the exchange, an asset is measured 
at historical cost. However, later in its useful life, when an asset is not expected to generate suf-
ficient cash flows (probable future benefits) at least equal to its book value, we say the asset’s 
book value is impaired. Corporations must review long-lived tangible and intangible assets for 
possible impairment. Two steps are necessary:
 
Step 1:  
Test for Impairment Impairment occurs when events or changed circumstances 
cause the estimated future cash flows (future benefits) of these assets to fall below 
their book value.
If net book value > Estimated future cash flows, then the asset is impaired
Step 2:  
Computation of Impairment Loss For any asset considered to be impaired, compa-
nies recognize a loss for the difference between the asset’s book value and its fair value 
(a market concept).
Impairment Loss = Net Book Value − Fair Value
That is, the asset is written down to fair value.
To illustrate measuring impairment losses, let’s assume that Southwest did a review for 
asset impairment and identified an aircraft with the following information: 
Net book value
$10,000,000
Estimated future cash flows
8,000,000
Fair value
7,500,000
Step 1: Test
Step 2: If impaired, loss
Step 1:  Since the net book value of $10 million exceeds the estimated future cash flows of 
$8 million, then the asset is impaired because it is not expected to generate future 
benefits equal to its net book value. When impaired, proceed to Step 2.
Step 2:  If impaired, the amount of the impairment loss is the difference between net book 
value and the asset’s fair value. For Southwest, determining fair value includes using 
published sources and third-party bids to obtain the value of the asset. If the asset’s 
fair value was $7,500,000, then the loss is calculated as $2,500,000 ($10,000,000 
net book value less $7,500,000 fair value). The following journal entry would be 
recorded:

Although Southwest did not report asset impairment losses in its recent annual report, it did 
report in notes to the financial statements that it follows the practice of reviewing assets for 
impairment:
Sears Holdings Corporation, which owns and operates approximately 2,400 Kmart and 
Sears stores in the United States and Canada, reported impairment losses on its fixed assets in 
its annual report for the 2013 fiscal year ended February 1, 2014:
The impairment loss in addition to a decline in revenues and an increase in expenses in fis-
cal year 2011 resulted in Sears Holdings Corporation reporting a net loss of over $3 billion, the 
first loss since Kmart and Sears merged in March 2005. The company also reported net losses 
of more than $0.9 and $1.3 billion in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 respectively.
Disposal of Property, Plant, and Equipment
In some cases, a business may voluntarily decide not to hold a long-lived asset for its entire 
life. The company may drop a product from its line and no longer need the equipment that was 
used to produce it, or managers may want to replace a machine with a more efficient one. These 
disposals include sales, trade-ins, and retirements. When Southwest disposes of an old aircraft, 
the company may sell it to a cargo airline or regional airline. A business may also dispose of an 
asset involuntarily, as the result of a casualty such as a storm, fire, or accident.
Disposals of long-lived assets seldom occur on the last day of the accounting period. There-
fore, depreciation must be recorded on the date of disposal for the amount of cost used since 
the last time depreciation was recorded. Therefore, the disposal of a depreciable asset usually 
requires two journal entries:
 
1. An adjusting entry to update the depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation 
accounts.
 
2. An entry to record the disposal. The cost of the asset and any accumulated depreciation at the 
date of disposal must be removed from the accounts. The difference between any resources

circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by that asset are less
than the carrying amounts of the asset and may not be recoverable. Factors that would indicate
potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value
of the long-lived asset(s), a significant change in the long-lived asset’s physical condition,
and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset. If an asset is
deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset book value in
relation to its estimated fair value.

We learned that, when disposing of an operational asset, you must first record depreciation expense 
for usage of the asset since the last time it was recorded. Then eliminate the asset at cost and its related 
accumulated depreciation. The difference between the cash received, if any, and the net book value of 
the asset is either a gain or loss on disposal.

received on disposal of an asset and its book value at the date of disposal is treated as 
a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. This gain (or loss) is reported on the income 
statement. It is not an operating revenue (or expense), however, because it arises from 
peripheral or incidental activities rather than from central operations. Gains and losses 
from disposals are usually shown as a separate item on the income statement.
Assume that at the end of year 17, Southwest sold an aircraft that was no longer needed 
because of the elimination of service to a small city. The aircraft was sold for $11  
million 
cash. The original cost of the flight equipment of $30 million was depreciated using 
the straight-line method over 25 years with no residual value ($1.2 million depreciation 
expense per year). The last accounting for depreciation was at the end of Year 16; thus, 
depreciation expense must be recorded for Year 17. The computations are:

Acquisition and Amortization of Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are increasingly important resources for organizations. An intangible asset, 
like any other asset, has value because of certain rights and privileges often conferred by law 
on its owner. Unlike tangible assets such as land and buildings, however, an intangible asset 
has no material or physical substance. Instead, the majority of intangible assets usually are 
evidenced by a legal document. The most common types of intangible assets are the following:

 Goodwill (recognized in a business combination)

Accounting for intangible assets has become increasingly important due to the tremendous 
expansion in computer information systems and Web technologies and the frenzy in companies 
purchasing other companies at high prices, with the expectation that these intangible resources 
will provide significant future benefits to the company. Intangible assets are recorded at his-
torical cost only if they have been purchased. If these assets are developed internally by the 
company, they are expensed when incurred. Upon acquisition of intangible assets, managers 
determine whether the separate intangibles have definite or indefinite lives:

 Definite Life. The cost of an intangible asset with a definite life is allocated on a straight-
line basis each period over its useful life in a process called amortization that is similar to 
depreciation. Most companies do not estimate a residual value for their intangible assets. 
Amortization expense is included on the income statement each period and the intangible 
assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortization on the balance sheet.
Let’s assume a company purchases a patent for $800,000 and intends to use it for 20 years. 
The adjusting entry to record $40,000 in patent amortization expense ($800,000 ÷ 20 years) 
is as follows:


 Indefinite Life. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Instead, these assets 
must be reviewed at least annually for possible impairment of value by first using qualita-
tive factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, it is greater than a 50 
percent likelihood) that the fair value of the indefinite-life intangible is less than its carrying 
amount. Qualitative factors can include, for example, negative effects due to increases in costs, 
decreases in cash flows beyond expectations, an economic downturn, or deterioration in the 
industry. If it is more likely, then the two-step process described in the previous section under 
“Measuring Asset Impairment” is followed to determine the amount of the impairment loss.
Goodwill
By far the most frequently reported intangible asset is goodwill (cost in excess of net assets 
acquired). The term goodwill, as used by most business people, means the favorable reputa-
tion that a company has with its customers. Goodwill arises from factors such as customer con-
fidence, reputation for good service or quality goods, location, outstanding management team, 
and financial standing. From its first day of operations, a successful business continually builds 
goodwill. In this context, the goodwill is said to be internally generated and is not reported as 
an asset (i.e., it was not purchased).
AMORTIZATION 
Systematic and rational allocation 
of the acquisition cost of an 
intangible asset over its useful life.
GOODWILL (COST IN 
EXCESS OF NET ASSETS 
ACQUIRED) 
For accounting purposes, the 
excess of the purchase price of a 
business over the fair value of the 
acquired business’s assets and 
liabilities.
1Consistent with the procedure for recording depreciation, an accumulated amortization account may be used. In 
practice, however, most companies credit the asset account directly for periodic amortization. This procedure is also 
typically used for natural resources, which are discussed in the next section.


414
C HAP TER  8   Reporting and Interpreting Property, Plant, and Equipment; Intangibles; and Natural Resources
The only way to report goodwill as an asset is to purchase another business. Often the 
purchase price of the business exceeds the fair value of all of its net assets (assets minus liabili-
ties). Why would a company pay more for a business as a whole than it would pay if it bought 
the assets individually? The answer is to obtain its goodwill. You could easily buy modern bot-
tling equipment to produce and sell a new cola drink, but you would not make as much money 
as you would if you acquired the goodwill associated with Coke or Pepsi brand names.
For accounting purposes, goodwill is defined as the difference between the purchase price 
of a company as a whole and the fair value of its net assets. For example, in 2006, Cedar 
Fair, the Ohio-based owner and operator of numerous amusement and water parks and hotels 
throughout North America, bought five theme parks from Paramount Parks. The total pur-
chase price that Cedar Fair agreed to pay ($1.2 billion) exceeded the fair value of Paramount’s 
net assets ($890 million). As shown below, Cedar Fair paid this extra $310 million to acquire 
the goodwill associated with the theme parks’ businesses.

In many acquisitions, the amount recorded as Goodwill can be very large. For example, Cisco 
Systems, which designs, manufactures, and sells Internet-based networking and other products 
and services, has completed several acquisitions since 2009. Of the nearly $17.1  
billion total 
cost of these acquisitions, $11.4 billion was recorded as Goodwill. That is over 47 percent of 
the $24.2 billion in Goodwill reported on Cisco’s July 26, 2014, balance sheet and the second 
largest asset reported.
Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and, as described in the previous  
section, 
must be tested for possible impairment for indefinite-life intangibles. Cisco reported the 
 
following policy:
Trademarks
A trademark is a special name, image, or slogan identified with a product or a company; it 
is protected by law. Trademarks are among the most valuable assets a company can own. For 
example, most of us cannot imagine the Walt Disney Company without Mickey Mouse. Simi-
larly, you probably enjoy your favorite soft drink more because of the image that has been built 
up around its name than because of its taste. Many people can identify the shape of a corporate 
logo as quickly as they can recognize the shape of a stop sign. Although trademarks are valu-
able assets, they are rarely seen on balance sheets. The reason is simple; intangible assets are

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and, when 
specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. When impaired, the carrying value of 
goodwill is written down to fair value.

not recorded unless they are purchased. Companies often spend millions of dollars developing 
trademarks, but most of those expenditures are recorded as expenses rather than being capital-
ized as an intangible asset.
Copyrights
A copyright gives the owner the exclusive right to publish, use, and sell a literary, musical, or 
artistic piece for a period not exceeding 70 years after the author’s death.2 The book you are 
reading has a copyright to protect the publisher and authors. It is against the law, for example, 
for an instructor to copy several chapters from this book and hand them out in class. A copy-
right that is purchased is recorded at cost.
Technology
The number of companies reporting a technology intangible asset continues to rise. Computer 
software and Web development costs are becoming increasingly significant. At December 31, 
2014, IBM Corporation reported $696 million in capitalized software and $1,298 million in 
completed technology (over 64 percent of its intangible assets excluding goodwill) on its bal-
ance sheet and disclosed the following in the notes to the financial statements:
COPYRIGHT 
Exclusive right to publish, use, 
and sell a literary, musical, or 
artistic work.
TECHNOLOGY 
Includes costs for computer 
software and Web development.
2In general, the limit is 70 years beyond the death of an author. For anonymous authors, the limit is 95 years from 
the first publication date. For more detail, go to copyright.gov.
Research and Development Costs: Not an Intangible  
Asset Under U.S. GAAP
Note in the IBM excerpt above that costs to formulate and design licensed software programs are 
expensed as incurred to research, development, and engineering expense.  In addition, if an intangible 
asset is developed internally, the cost of development normally is recorded as research and develop-
ment expense. For example, Abbott Laboratories (a manufacturer of pharmaceutical and nutritional 
products) recently reported it spends about $1.5 billion annually on research to discover new products. 
These amounts were reported as expenses, not assets, because research and development expenditures 
typically do not possess sufficient probability of resulting in measurable future cash flows. If Abbott 
Labs had spent an equivalent amount to purchase patents for new products from other drug companies, it 
would have recorded the expenditures as assets.

Costs that are related to the conceptual formulation and design of licensed software programs 
are expensed as incurred to research, development and engineering expense; costs that are 
incurred to produce the finished product after technological feasibility has been established are

periods ranging up to two years and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense.

Patents
A patent is an exclusive right granted by the federal government for a period of 20 years, 
typically granted to a person who invents a new product or discovers a new process.3 The 
patent enables the owner to use, manufacture, and sell both the subject of the patent and 
the patent itself. It prevents a competitor from simply copying a new invention or discovery 
until the inventor has had time to earn an economic return on the new product. Without 
the protection of a patent, inventors likely would be unwilling to search for new products. 
Patents are recorded at their purchase price or, if developed internally, at only their reg-
istration and legal costs because GAAP requires the immediate expensing of research and 
development costs.
Franchises
Franchises may be granted by the government or a business for a specified period and 
purpose. A city may grant one company a franchise to distribute gas to homes for heating 
purposes, or a company may sell franchises, such as the right to operate a KFC restau-
rant (owned by Yum! Brands). Franchise agreements are contracts that can have a vari-
ety of provisions. They usually require an investment by the franchisee; therefore, they 
should be accounted for as intangible assets. The life of the franchise agreement depends 
on the contract. It may be a single year or an indefinite period. For example, Papa John’s 
 
International, a franchisor, has over 4,600 stores around the world, and about 84 percent 
are franchises. The franchise agreement covers a 10-year term that is renewable for another 
10 years. In the United States, to obtain a new Papa John’s franchise, a franchisee pays an 
initial franchise fee of $25,000 to Papa John’s. This amount is then recorded by the franchi-
see as an intangible asset.
Licenses and Operating Rights
Southwest Airlines’s intangible assets are included on the balance sheet presented in 
Exhibit 8.1 as other assets. They primarily represent leasehold rights to airport-owned gates. 
Others include operating rights, which are authorized landing slots regulated by the govern-
ment that are in limited supply at many airports. They are intangible assets that can be bought 
and sold by the airlines. Other types of licenses and operating rights that grant permission to 
companies include using airwaves for radio and television broadcasts and land for cable and 
telephone lines.

IFRS differs from GAAP somewhat in accounting for tangible and intangible assets. Two of the most sig-
nificant differences are summarized below. IFRS allows companies the option of reporting these assets at 
fair value (e.g., appraisals), provided they use the fair value method consistently each year. The primary 
argument in favor of revaluation is that the historical cost of an asset purchased 15 to 20 years ago is not 
meaningful because of the impact of inflation. In contrast, GAAP requires tangible and intangible assets 
to be recorded at cost and not revalued for later increases in asset values. A primary argument against the 
revaluation is the lack of objectivity involved in estimating an asset’s current cost.
IFRS also requires companies to capitalize the costs of developing intangible assets, such as proto-
types for making new products or tools. GAAP, on the other hand, generally expenses such development 
costs because of the uncertainty of their value.

Until the United States adopts IFRS, you should carefully read the financial statement notes of any non–
U.S. company you analyze. Euro Disney and the LEGO Group reported in 2014 that they chose to use 
historical costs, but they could have chosen instead to use fair value.
Acquisition and Depletion of Natural Resources
You are probably most familiar with large companies that are involved in manufacturing (Ford 
Motor Corporation, Stanley Black & Decker), distribution (Sears Holdings, Home Depot), 
or services (FedEx®, Marriott International). A number of large companies, some of which 
are less well known, develop raw materials and products from natural resources, including 
mineral deposits such as gold or iron ore, oil wells, and timber tracts. These resources are 
often called wasting assets because they are depleted (i.e., physically used up). Companies 
that develop natural resources are critical to the economy because they produce essential items 
such as lumber for construction, fuel for heating and transportation, and food for consumption. 
Because of the significant effect they can have on the environment, these companies attract 
considerable public attention. Concerned citizens often read the financial statements of com-
panies involved in the exploration for oil, coal, and various ores to determine the amount of 
money they spend to protect the environment.
When natural resources are acquired or developed, they are recorded in conformity with 
the cost principle. As a natural resource is used up, its acquisition cost must be apportioned 
among the periods in which revenues are earned in conformity with the expense principle. The 
term depletion describes the process of allocating a natural resource’s cost over the period of 
its exploitation.4 The units-of-production method is often applied to compute depletion.
When a natural resource such as an oil well is depleted, the company obtains inventory (oil). 
Because depleting the natural resource is necessary to obtain the inventory, the depletion com-
puted during a period is not expensed immediately, but is capitalized as part of the cost of the 
inventory. Only when the inventory is sold does the company record an expense (Cost of Goods 
Sold). Consider the following illustration:
A timber tract costing $530,000 is depleted over its estimated cutting period based on a “cut-
ting” rate of approximately 20 percent per year as in the following entry. Note that the amount 
of the natural resource that is depleted is capitalized as inventory, not expensed. When the 
inventory is sold, the cost of goods sold will be included as an expense on the income statement.

practice, however, most companies credit the asset account directly for periodic depletion.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE 8-7
Explain how the acquisition, 
use, and disposal of long-lived 
assets impact cash flows.
Productive Assets and Depreciation
F O C US  ON  
CAS H  FLOW S
EFFECT ON STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
The indirect method for preparing the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows 
involves reconciling net income on the accrual basis (reported on the income statement) to cash flows 
from operations. This means that, among other adjustments, (1) revenues and expenses that do not 
involve cash and (2) gains and losses that relate to investing or financing activities (not operations) 
should be eliminated.
When depreciation is recorded, no cash payment is made (i.e., there is no credit to Cash). Because 
depreciation expense (a noncash expense) is subtracted in calculating net income on the income state-
ment, it must be added back to net income to eliminate its effect. Likewise, because any gain (or loss) on 
the sale of long-lived assets (an investing activity) is added (or subtracted) to determine net income, it 
must be subtracted from (or added to) net income to eliminate its effect.
In General The acquisition, sale, and depreciation of long-term assets are reflected on a company’s 
cash flow statement as indicated in the following table:

Focus Company Analysis The following is a condensed version of Southwest’s statement of 
cash flows for 2014. Buying and selling long-lived assets are investing activities. In 2014, South-
west used $1,748 million in cash to purchase flight equipment and ground property and equipment. 


CHAPTER  8  Reporting and Interpreting Property, Plant, and Equipment; Intangibles; and Natural Resources
419
Southwest did not sell any flight or ground equipment during the year. Selling long-lived assets is not 
an  
operating activity. Therefore, any gains (losses) on sales of long-term assets that were included in 
net income must be deducted from (added to) net income in the operating activities section to elimi-
nate the effect of the sale. Unless they are large, these gain and loss adjustments normally are not 
specifically highlighted on the statement of cash flows. Southwest did not list any gains or losses as 
adjustments in 2014.
In capital-intensive industries such as airlines, depreciation is a significant noncash expense. In South-
west’s case, depreciation and amortization expense is usually the single largest adjustment to net income 
in determining cash flows from operations. For example, in 2014, the adjustment for depreciation and 
amortization expense was 32 percent of operating cash flows.

A Misinterpretation
Some analysts misinterpret the meaning of a noncash expense, saying that “cash is provided by depre-
ciation.” Although depreciation is added in the operating section of the statement of cash flows, 
 
depreciation is not a source of cash. Cash from operations can be provided only by selling goods 
and services. A company with a large amount of depreciation expense does not generate more cash 
compared with a company that reports a small amount of depreciation expense, assuming that they are 
exactly the same in every other respect. While depreciation expense reduces the amount of reported net 
income for a company, it does not reduce the amount of cash generated by the company because it is a 
noncash expense. Remember that the effects of recording depreciation are a reduction in stockholders’ 
equity and a reduction in fixed assets, not in cash. That is why, on the statement of cash flows, depre-
ciation expense is added back to net income on an accrual basis to compute cash flows from operations 
(on a cash basis).
Although depreciation is a noncash expense, the depreciation for tax purposes can affect a 
 
company’s cash flows. Depreciation is a deductible expense for income tax purposes. The higher the 
amount of depreciation recorded by a company for tax purposes, the lower the company’s taxable income 
and the taxes it must pay. Because taxes must be paid in cash, a reduction in a company’s results reduces 
the company’s cash outflows (that is, lower net income leads to lower tax payments).

(Resolve the requirements before proceeding to the suggested solution that follows.) Diversi-
fied Industries started as a residential construction company. In recent years, it has expanded 
into heavy construction, ready-mix concrete, construction supplies, and earth-moving services. 
Assume the company completed the following transactions during 2016. Amounts have been 
 
simplified.
2016
Jan. '1
The management decided to buy a 10-year-old building for $175,000 and the land on which it was 
situated for $130,000. It paid $100,000 in cash and signed a mortgage note payable for the rest.
Jan. 12
Paid $38,000 in renovation costs on the building prior to use.
July  10
Paid $1,200 for ordinary repairs on the building.
Dec. 31
Year-end adjustments:
 
a.  
The building will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of 
30 years. The estimated residual value is $33,000.
 
b.  
Diversified purchased another company several years ago at $100,000 over the fair 
value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill has an indefinite life.
 
c.  
At the beginning of the year, the company owned equipment with a cost of $650,000 
and accumulated depreciation of $150,000. The equipment is being depreciated using 
the double-declining-balance method, with a useful life of 20 years and no residual 
value.
 
d.  
At year-end, the company tested its long-lived assets for possible impairment of their 
value. It identified a piece of old excavation equipment with a cost of $156,000 and 
remaining book value of $120,000. Due to its smaller size and lack of safety features, 
the old equipment has limited use. The future cash flows are expected to be $40,000 and 
the fair value is determined to be $35,000. Goodwill was found not to be impaired.
December 31, 2016, is the end of the annual accounting period.
Required:
 
1. Indicate the accounts affected and the amount and direction (+ for increase and − for decrease) of 
the effect of each of the preceding events (Jan. 1, Jan. 12, July 10, and adjustments a through d) on

value of $500,000 for fixed assets at the beginning of the year, compute the fixed asset turnover 
ratio. Explain its meaning.

Chapter Supplement
Changes in Depreciation Estimates
Depreciation is based on two estimates: useful life and residual value. These estimates are made at the 
time a depreciable asset is acquired. As experience with the asset accumulates, one or both of these initial 
estimates may need to be revised. In addition, any improvements that extend the asset’s useful life may 
be added to the original acquisition cost at some time during the asset’s use. When it is clear that either 
estimate should be revised to a material degree or that the asset’s cost has changed, the undepreciated 
asset balance (less any residual value at that date) should be apportioned over the remaining estimated 
life from the current year into the future. This is called a prospective change in estimate.
To compute the new depreciation expense due to a change in estimate for any of the depreciation 
methods described here, substitute the net book value for the original acquisition cost, the new residual 
value for the original amount, and the estimated remaining life in place of the original estimated life. As 
an illustration, the formula using the straight-line method follows.
Original Straight-Line Formula Modified for a Change in Estimate:
(Cost - Residual Value) × 
1
Useful Life% = Original Depreciation Expense
(Net Book Value - New Residual Value) × 
1
Remaining Life = Revised Depreciation Expense

and estimated residual value of $3,000,000. Shortly after the start of Year 5, Southwest changed the

remaining life was only two more years. Southwest uses the straight-line method.

Companies may also change depreciation methods (for example, from declining balance to straight 
line). Such a change requires significantly more disclosure because it violates the consistency principle, 
which requires that accounting information reported in the financial statements should be comparable 
across accounting periods. Under GAAP, changes in accounting estimates and depreciation methods 
should be made only when a new estimate or accounting method “better measures” the periodic income 
of the business.

8-1. Define, classify, and explain the nature of long-lived productive assets and interpret the fixed 
asset turnover ratio. p. 391
 
a. Productive assets are those that a business retains for long periods of time for use in the course of 
normal operations rather than for sale. They may be divided into tangible assets (land, buildings, 
equipment, natural resources) and intangible assets (including goodwill, patents, and franchises).
 
b. The cost allocation method utilized affects the amount of net property, plant, and equipment that 
is used in the computation of the fixed asset turnover ratio. Accelerated methods reduce book 
value and increase the turnover ratio.
 
8-2. Apply the cost principle to measure the acquisition and maintenance of property, plant, and 
equipment. p. 392
The acquisition cost of property, plant, and equipment is the cash-equivalent purchase price plus 
all reasonable and necessary expenditures made to acquire and prepare the asset for its intended 
use. These assets may be acquired using cash, debt, or stock or through self-construction. Expen-
ditures made after the asset is in use are either additions and improvements or ordinary repairs 
(expenses):
 
a. Ordinary repairs and maintenance provide benefits during the current accounting period 
only. Amounts are debited to appropriate current expense accounts when the expenses are 
incurred.
 
b. Improvements provide benefits for one or more accounting periods beyond the current period. 
Amounts are debited to the appropriate asset accounts (they are capitalized) and depreciated, 
depleted, or amortized over their useful lives.
 
8-3. Apply various cost allocation methods as assets are held and used over time. p. 398
Cost allocation methods: In conformity with the expense principle, cost less any estimated residual 
value is allocated to periodic expense over the periods benefited. Because of depreciation, the net book 
value of an asset declines over time and net income is reduced by the amount of the expense. Com-
mon depreciation methods include straight-line (a constant amount over time), units-of- 
production (a 
variable amount over time), and double-declining-balance (a decreasing amount over time).
 
a. Depreciation—buildings and equipment.
 
b. Amortization—intangibles.
 
c. Depletion—natural resources.
 
8-4. Explain the effect of asset impairment on the financial statements. p. 409
When events or changes in circumstances reduce the estimated future cash flows of long-lived 
assets below their book value, the book values should be written down (by recording a loss) to the 
fair value of the assets.
 
8-5. Analyze the disposal of property, plant, and equipment. p. 410
When assets are disposed of through sale or abandonment,
 
a. Record additional depreciation since the last adjustment was made.
 
b. Remove the cost of the old asset and its related accumulated depreciation, depletion, or 
amortization.
 
c. Recognize the cash proceeds.
 
d. Recognize any gain or loss when the asset’s net book value is not equal to the cash received.
 
8-6. Apply measurement and reporting concepts for intangible assets and natural resources. 
 
p. 412
The cost principle should be applied in recording the acquisition of intangible assets and natu-
ral resources. Intangibles with definite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method. 
Intangibles with indefinite useful lives, including goodwill, are not amortized, but are reviewed at 
least annually for impairment. Report intangibles at net book value on the balance sheet. Natural 
resources should be depleted (usually by the units-of-production method) usually with the amount 
of the depletion expense capitalized to an inventory account.

The fixed asset turnover ratio measures how efficiently a company utilizes its investment in prop-
erty, plant, and equipment over time. Its ratio can then be compared to competitors’ ratios. The fixed 
asset turnover ratio is computed as follows (see the “Key Ratio Analysis” box in the Acquisition and 
Maintenance of Plant and Equipment section):
Fixed Asset Turnover = Net Sales (or Operating Revenues)
Average Net Fixed Assets

8-7. Explain how the acquisition, use, and disposal of long-lived assets impact cash flows. p. 418
Depreciation expense is a noncash expense that has no effect on cash. It is added back to net income 
on the statement of cash flows to determine cash from operations. Acquiring and disposing of long-
lived assets are investing activities.
In previous chapters, we discussed business and accounting issues related to the assets that a company 
holds. In Chapters 9, 10, and 11, we shift our focus to the other side of the balance sheet to see how man-
agers finance business operations and the acquisition of productive assets. We discuss various types of 
liabilities in Chapters 9 and 10 and examine stockholders’ equity in Chapter 11.

companies paid exactly the same cost, $30,000, for their respective vehicles. As of December 31, 
2017, the net book value of Miga’s truck was less than Porter Company’s net book value for the same 
vehicle. Which of the following is an acceptable explanation for the difference in net book value?
 
a. Miga Company estimated a lower residual value, but both estimated the same useful life and both 
elected straight-line depreciation.
 
b. Both companies elected straight-line depreciation, but Miga Company used a longer estimated 
life.

a fair value of $4,500,000. Elizabeth Pie also (1) holds a patent for a pie crust fluting machine that the 
company invented (the patent with a fair value of $300,000 was never recorded by Elizabeth Pie because 
it was developed internally) and (2) estimates goodwill from loyal customers to be $310,000 (also never

Explaining Depreciation Policy
The 2001 annual report for General Motors Corporation contained the following note:
E8-12
LO8-3
NOTE 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Property, Net
Property, plant, and equipment, including internal use software, is recorded at cost. Major 
improvements that extend the useful life of property are capitalized. Expenditures for repairs and 
maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. At January 1, 2001, we adopted the straight-
line method of depreciation for real estate, facilities, and equipment placed in service after 
that date. Assets placed in service before January 1, 2001, continue to be depreciated using 
accelerated methods. The accelerated methods accumulate depreciation of approximately two-
thirds of the depreciable cost in the first half of the estimated useful lives of property groups 
as compared to the straight-line method, which allocates depreciable costs equally over the 
estimated useful lives of property groups.
Required:
Why do you think the company changed its depreciation method for real estate, facilities, and equipment 
placed in service after January 1, 2001, and subsequent years?
Interpreting Management’s Choice of Different Depreciation Methods for Tax and Financial 
Reporting
A recent annual report for FedEx includes the following information:
E8-13
LO8-3
For financial reporting purposes, we record depreciation and amortization of property and 
equipment on a straight-line basis over the asset’s service life or related lease term if shorter. For 
income tax purposes, depreciation is computed using accelerated methods when applicable.
Required:
Explain why FedEx uses different methods of depreciation for financial reporting and tax purposes.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. Expenditures for major additions, improvements and flight
equipment modifications are capitalized when such costs are determined to extend the useful
life of the asset or are part of the cost of acquiring the asset. Expenditures for equipment
overhaul costs of engines or airframes prior to their operational use are capitalized as part of
the cost of such assets as they are costs required to ready the asset for its intended use.
Maintenance and repairs costs are charged to expense as incurred. . . .
Assume that FedEx made extensive repairs on an existing building and added a new wing. The building 
is a garage and repair facility for delivery trucks that serve the Denver area. The existing building origi-
nally cost $950,000, and by the end of last year, it was half depreciated based on use of the straight-line 
method, a 20-year estimated useful life, and no residual value. During the current year, the following 
expenditures related to the building were made:
 
a. Ordinary repairs and maintenance expenditures for the year, $7,000 cash.
 
b. Extensive and major repairs to the roof of the building, $122,000 cash. These repairs were completed 
at the end of the current year.

Computing Amortization, Book Value, and Asset Impairment Related to Different  
Intangible Assets (AP8-7)
Starn Tool Company has five different intangible assets to be accounted for and reported on the financial 
statements. The management is concerned about the amortization of the cost of each of these intangibles. 
Facts about each intangible follow:
 
a. Patent. The company purchased a patent at a cash cost of $55,900 on January 1, 2017. The patent has 
an estimated useful life of 13 years.
 
b. Copyright. On January 1, 2017, the company purchased a copyright for $22,500 cash. It is estimated 
that the copyrighted item will have no value by the end of 10 years.
 
c. Franchise. The company obtained a franchise from McKenna Company to make and distribute a 
special item. It obtained the franchise on January 1, 2017, at a cash cost of $14,400 for a 10-year 
period.
 
d. License. On January 1, 2016, the company secured a license from the city to operate a special service 
for a period of five years. Total cash expended to obtain the license was $14,000.
 
e. Goodwill. The company started business in January 2014 by purchasing another business for a cash 
lump sum of $400,000. Included in the purchase price was “Goodwill, $40,000.” Company executives 
stated that “the goodwill is an important long-lived asset to us.” It has an indefinite life.
Required:
 1. Compute the amount of amortization that should be recorded for each intangible asset at the end of 
the annual accounting period, December 31, 2017.
 2. Give the book value of each intangible asset on December 31, 2018.
 3. Assume that on January 2, 2019, the copyrighted item was impaired in its ability to continue to 
produce strong revenues. The other intangible assets were not affected. Starn estimated that the 
copyright would be able to produce future cash flows of $17,000. The fair value of the copyright was 
determined to be $16,000. Compute the amount, if any, of the impairment loss to be recorded.
(Chapter Supplement) Analyzing and Recording Entries Related to a Change in Estimated  
Life and Residual Value
Rungano Corporation is a global publisher of magazines, books, and music and video collections and 
is a leading direct mail marketer. Many direct mail marketers use high-speed Didde press equipment to 
print their advertisements. These presses can cost more than $1 million. Assume that Rungano owns 
a Didde press acquired at an original cost of $400,000. It is being depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over a 20-year estimated useful life and has a $50,000 estimated residual value. At the end of the prior 
year, the press had been depreciated for a full six years. At the beginning of January of the current year, 
a decision was made, on the basis of improved maintenance procedures, that a total estimated useful 
life of 25 years and a residual value of $73,000 would be more realistic. The accounting period ends 
December 31.
Required:
 1. Compute (a) the amount of depreciation expense recorded in the prior year and (b) the book value of 
the printing press at the end of the prior year.
 2. Compute the amount of depreciation that should be recorded in the current year. Show computations 
(round amount to the nearest dollar).
 3. Give the adjusting entry for depreciation at December 31 of the current year.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 3. Accounting Policies
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Interest expense incurred during the initial 
construction of buildings and rental equipment is considered part of cost. Depreciation is 
computed for financial reporting purposes using the straight line or an accelerated method based 
on a declining balance formula over the following estimated useful lives: rental equipment 2–20 
years and buildings and non-rental equipment 3–55 years. We follow the deferral method of 
accounting based on ASC 908—Airlines for major overhauls in which engine and transmission 
overhauls are capitalized and amortized over three years. Routine maintenance costs are charged 
to operating expense as they are incurred.
AMERCO subsidiaries own property, plant, and equipment that are utilized in the manufacture, repair, 
and rental of U-Haul equipment and that provide offices for U-Haul. Assume that AMERCO made exten-
sive repairs on an existing building and added a new wing. The building is a garage and repair facility for 


CHAPTER  8  Reporting and Interpreting Property, Plant, and Equipment; Intangibles; and Natural Resources

rental trucks that serve the Seattle area. The existing building originally cost $330,000, and by the end of 
its fifth year, the building was one-quarter depreciated on the basis of a 20-year estimated useful life and 
no residual value. Assume straight-line depreciation. During the sixth year, the following expenditures 
related to the building were made:
 
a. Ordinary repairs and maintenance expenditures for the year, $6,000 cash.
 
b. Extensive and major repairs to the roof of the building, $17,000 cash. These repairs were completed 
on December 31.
 
c. The new wing was completed on December 31 at a cash cost of $70,000.

Using Financial Reports: Inferring the Sale of Assets
A recent annual report for Eastman Kodak reported that the cost of property, plant, and equipment at the end 
of the current year was $755 million. At the end of the previous year, it had been $751 million. During the cur-
rent year, the company bought $43 million worth of new equipment. The balance of accumulated depreciation 
at the end of the current year was $231 million; at the end of the previous year it was $67 million. Depreciation 
expense for the current year was $174 million. The company reported a $23 million gain on the disposition of 
property, plant, and equipment. There were no impairment losses during the current year.

Critical Thinking Cases
Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma: A Real-Life Example
Assume you work as a staff member in a large accounting department for a multinational public 
company. Your job requires you to review documents relating to the company’s equipment pur-
chases. Upon verifying that purchases are properly approved, you prepare journal entries to record the 
equipment purchases in the accounting system. Typically, you handle equipment purchases costing 
$100,000 or less.
This morning, you were contacted by the executive assistant to the chief financial officer (CFO). She 
says that the CFO has asked to see you immediately in his office. Although your boss’s boss has attended 
a few meetings where the CFO was present, you have never met the CFO during your three years with the 
company. Needless to say, you are anxious about the meeting.

CHAPTER  8  Reporting and Interpreting Property, Plant, and Equipment; Intangibles; and Natural Resources
455
Upon entering the CFO’s office, you are warmly greeted with a smile and friendly handshake. The 
CFO compliments you on the great work that you’ve been doing for the company. You soon feel a little 
more comfortable, particularly when the CFO mentions that he has a special project for you. He states 
that he and the CEO have negotiated significant new arrangements with the company’s equipment suppli-
ers, which require the company to make advance payments for equipment to be purchased in the future. 
The CFO says that, for various reasons that he didn’t want to discuss, he will be processing the payments 
through the operating division of the company rather than the equipment accounting group. Given that 
the payments will be made through the operating division, they will initially be classified as operating 
expenses of the company. He indicates that clearly these advance payments for property and equipment 
should be recorded as assets, so he will be contacting you at the end of every quarter to make an adjusting 
journal entry to capitalize the amounts inappropriately classified as operating expenses. He advises you 
that a new account, called Prepaid Equipment, has been established for this purpose. He quickly wraps up 
the meeting by telling you that it is important that you not talk about the special project with anyone. You 
assume he doesn’t want others to become jealous of your new important responsibility.
A few weeks later, at the end of the first quarter, you receive a voicemail from the CFO stating, “The 
adjustment that we discussed is $771,000,000 for this quarter.” Before deleting the message, you replay it 
to make sure you heard it right. Your company generates over $8 billion in revenues and incurs $6 billion 
in operating expenses every quarter, but you’ve never made a journal entry for that much money. So, just 
to be sure there’s not a mistake, you send an e-mail to the CFO confirming the amount. He phones you 
back immediately to abruptly inform you, “There’s no mistake. That’s the number.” Feeling embarrassed 
that you may have annoyed the CFO, you quietly make the adjusting journal entry.
For each of the remaining three quarters in that year and for the first quarter in the following year, you 
continue to make these end-of-quarter adjustments. The “magic number,” as the CFO liked to call it, was 
$560,000,000 for Q2, $742,745,000 for Q3, $941,000,000 for Q4, and $818,204,000 for Q1 of the following 
year. During this time, you’ve had several meetings and lunches with the CFO where he provides you the 
magic number, sometimes supported with nothing more than a Post-it note with the number written on it. He 
frequently compliments you on your good work and promises that you’ll soon be in line for a big promotion.
Despite the CFO’s compliments and promises, you are growing increasingly uncomfortable with the 
journal entries that you’ve been making. Typically, whenever an ordinary equipment purchase involves 
an advance payment, the purchase is completed a few weeks later. At that time, the amount of the advance 
is removed from an Equipment Deposit account and transferred to the appropriate equipment account. 
This hasn’t been the case with the CFO’s special project. Instead, the Prepaid Equipment account has 
continued to grow, now standing at over $3.8 billion. There’s been no discussion about how or when this 
balance will be reduced, and no depreciation has been recorded for it.
Just as you begin to reflect on the effect the adjustments have had on your company’s fixed assets, 
operating expenses, and operating income, you receive a call from the vice president for internal audit. 
She needs to talk with you this afternoon about “a peculiar trend in the company’s fixed asset turnover 
ratio and some suspicious journal entries that you’ve been making.”
Required:
 1. Complete the following table to determine what the company’s accounting records would have 
looked like had you not made the journal entries as part of the CFO’s special project. Comment on 
how the decision to capitalize amounts, which were initially recorded as operating expenses, has 
affected the level of income from operations in each quarter.


456
C HAP TER  8   Reporting and Interpreting Property, Plant, and Equipment; Intangibles; and Natural Resources
 2. Using the publicly reported numbers (which include the special journal entries that you recorded), 
compute the fixed asset turnover ratio (rounded to two decimal places) for the periods ended Q2–Q4 
of Year 1 and Q1 of Year 2. What does the trend in this ratio suggest to you? Is this consistent with 
the changes in operating income reported by the company?
 3. Before your meeting with the vice president for internal audit, you think about the above computa-
tions and the variety of peculiar circumstances surrounding the “special project” for the CFO. What 
in particular might have raised your suspicion about the real nature of your work?
 4. Your meeting with internal audit was short and unpleasant. The vice president indicated that she 
had discussed her findings with the CFO before meeting with you. The CFO claimed that he too had 
noticed the peculiar trend in the fixed asset turnover ratio, but that he hadn’t had a chance to investi-
gate it further. He urged internal audit to get to the bottom of things, suggesting that perhaps someone 
might be making unapproved journal entries. Internal audit had identified you as the source of the 
journal entries and had been unable to find any documents that approved or substantiated the entries. 
She ended the meeting by advising you to find a good lawyer. Given your current circumstances, 
describe how you would have acted earlier had you been able to foresee where it might lead you.
 5. In the real case on which this one is based, the internal auditors agonized over the question of whether 
they had actually uncovered a fraud or whether they were jumping to the wrong conclusion. The Wall 
Street Journal mentioned this on October 30, 2002, by stating, “it was clear . . . that their findings would 
be devastating for the company. They worried about whether their revelations would result in layoffs. 
Plus, they feared that they would somehow end up being blamed for the mess.” Beyond the personal 
consequences mentioned in this quote, describe other potential ways in which the findings of the inter-
nal auditors would likely be devastating for the publicly traded company and those associated with it.
Epilogue: This case is based on a fraud committed at WorldCom (now called Verizon). The case 
draws its numbers, the nature of the unsupported journal entries, and the CFO’s role in carrying out the 
fraud from a report issued by WorldCom’s bankruptcy examiner. Year 1 in this case was actually 2001 
and Year 2 was 2002. This case excludes other fraudulent activities that contributed to WorldCom’s 
$11  
billion fraud. The 63-year-old CEO was sentenced to 25 years in prison for planning and executing 
the biggest fraud in the history of American business. The CFO, who cooperated in the investigation of 
the CEO, was sentenced to five years in prison.
Evaluating the Impact of Capitalized Interest on Cash Flows and Fixed Asset Turnover from 
an Analyst’s Perspective
You are a financial analyst charged with evaluating the asset efficiency of companies in the hotel indus-
try. Recent financial statements for Marriott International include the following note:
12.    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
We record property and equipment at cost, including interest and real estate taxes we incur
during development and construction. Interest we capitalized as a cost of property and
equipment totaled $33 million in 2014, $31 million in 2013, and $27 million in 2012.
We capitalize the cost of improvements that extend the useful life of property and equipment
when we incur them. These capitalized costs may include structural costs, equipment, fixtures,
floor, and wall coverings.
Required:
 1. Assume that Marriott followed this policy for a major construction project this year. How does 
 
Marriott’s policy affect the following (use + for increase, − for decrease, and NE for no effect)?
 
a. Cash flows.
 
b. Fixed asset turnover ratio.
 2. Normally, how would your answer to requirement (1b) affect your evaluation of Marriott’s effective-
ness in utilizing fixed assets?
 3. If the fixed asset turnover ratio decreases due to interest capitalization, does this change indicate a 
real decrease in efficiency? Why or why not?

tarbucks’s mission statement is “To inspire and nurture the human spirit—one person, 
one cup and one neighborhood at a time.” In 1971 Starbucks opened its first store in 
Seattle’s Pike Place Market. Today, the company has almost 200,000 employees work-
ing in over 21,000 stores spread across 65 countries. In fiscal 2014, Starbucks reported 
global revenues of $16.4 billion, an 11% increase over the previous year.
Starbucks has ambitious growth plans for the future, intending to open approximately 
1,500 stores each year for several years. To be successful, management must focus on a 
number of critical financing activities. These activities will generate funds to finance the 
current operating activities of the business and the long-term assets that will permit the 
company to grow in the future.
U ND E RSTAN DI N G  T H E  B USI N E SS
Businesses finance the acquisition of assets from two external sources: funds supplied by 
creditors (debt) and funds provided by owners (equity). The mixture of debt and equity a busi-
ness uses is called its capital structure. In addition to selecting a capital structure, manage-
ment can select from a variety of sources from which to borrow money, as illustrated by the 
liability section of the balance sheet from Starbucks shown in Exhibit 9.1.


chapter 9
What factors do managers consider when they borrow money? Two key fac-
tors are risk and cost. From the firm’s perspective, debt capital is more risky than 
equity capital because payments associated with debt are a company’s legal obli-
gation. If a company cannot meet a required debt payment (either principal or 
interest) because of a temporary cash shortage, creditors may force the company 
into bankruptcy and require the sale of assets to satisfy the debt. As with any busi-
ness transaction, borrowers and lenders attempt to negotiate the most favorable 
terms possible. Managers devote considerable effort analyzing alternative bor-
rowing arrangements.
Companies that include debt in their capital structure must also make strate-
gic decisions concerning the balance between short-term and long-term debt. To 
evaluate a company’s capital structure, financial analysts calculate a number of 
accounting ratios. In this chapter, we will discuss both short-term and long-term 
debt, as well as some important accounting ratios. We will also introduce present 
values and discuss the role present values play in how long-term liabilities are 
reported on a company’s balance sheet. In the next chapter, we discuss a special 
category of long-term debt, bond securities.

Most people have a reasonable understanding of the definition of the word liability. Accoun-
tants formally define liabilities as the probable future sacrifice of economic benefits that arise 
from past transactions. As Exhibit 9.1 shows, as of September 28, 2014 (Starbucks’s fiscal 
year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30), Starbucks had borrowed on a long-term 
basis $2,048.3 million. The company has an obligation to pay cash to its creditors at some time 
in the future based on the borrowing agreements. Because of this obligation, Starbucks must 
record a long-term liability on its balance sheet.

When a liability is first recorded, it is measured in terms of its current cash equivalent, which 
is the cash amount a creditor would accept to settle the liability immediately. Although Star-
bucks borrowed $2,048.3 million, it will repay much more than that because the company must 
also pay interest on the debt. Interest that will be paid in the future is not included in the reported 
amount of the liability because it accrues and becomes a liability with the passage of time.
Like most businesses, Starbucks has several kinds of liabilities as well as a wide range of 
creditors. The list of liabilities on the balance sheet differs from one company to the next because 
different operating activities result in different types of liabilities. The liability section of Star-
bucks’s balance sheet begins with the caption Current Liabilities. Current liabilities are expected 
to be paid with current assets within the current operating cycle of the business or within one year 
of the balance sheet date, whichever is longer. Noncurrent liabilities include all other liabilities.
CUR R ENT  L IA B IL IT I ES
Many current liabilities have a direct relationship to the operating activities of a business. In 
other words, specific operating activities are financed, in part, by a related current liability. 
Some examples from Starbucks’s balance sheet (Exhibit 9.1) are:
Accounts payable
Accrued rent
Accrued wages
Deferred revenue
Current Liability
Operating Activity
Purchase coffee inventory
Rent store space
for coffeehouse
Employees earn wages
Customers pay in advance
for future purchases
Early in this chapter, we mentioned that Starbucks is opening a lot of new stores each year. 
As a result, it must buy additional inventory, rent more store space, and hire more employees. 
By understanding the relationship between operating activities and current liabilities, an ana-
lyst can explain changes in the various current liability accounts.
We will now discuss the current liability accounts that are common to most balance sheets.
Accounts Payable
Most companies in the course of running their day-to-day operations purchase goods and ser-
vices from other businesses. Typically, these purchases are made on credit with cash payments 
made after the goods and services have been provided. As a result, these transactions create 
obligations to pay suppliers in the near future. Most companies list such obligations on their 
balance sheets as accounts payable (sometimes called trade accounts payable).
For many companies, buying on credit from suppliers is a relatively inexpensive way to finance 
the purchase of inventory because interest does not normally accrue on accounts payable. As an 
incentive to encourage more sales, some suppliers offer generous credit terms that may allow 
buyers to resell merchandise and collect cash before payment must be made to the supplier.
Some managers may be tempted to delay payment to suppliers as long as possible to con-
serve cash. This strategy can create problems for suppliers. Most successful companies develop 
positive working relationships with suppliers to ensure that they receive quality goods and 
services. A positive relationship can be destroyed by slow payments. In addition, financial ana-
lysts become concerned if a business does not meet its obligations to suppliers on a timely basis 


462
C HAP TER  9   Reporting and Interpreting Liabilities
because such slowness often indicates that a company is experiencing financial difficulties. 
Both managers and analysts use the accounts payable turnover ratio to evaluate how effectively 
a company is managing its accounts payable.
Accrued Liabilities
In many situations, a business incurs an expense in one accounting period and makes the cash 
payment in a future period. Accrued liabilities are expenses that have been incurred before the 
end of an accounting period but have not been paid. These expenses include items such as rent,

How quickly does management pay its suppliers?
%  RATIO AND COMPARISONS
The accounts payable turnover ratio is computed as follows:
Accounts Payable Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Accounts Payable
The 2014 accounts payable turnover ratio for Starbucks was:
$6,858.8 ÷ $512.7* = 13.4
*(533.7 + 491.7) ÷ 2

INTERPRETATIONS
In General The accounts payable turnover ratio measures how quickly management pays suppliers. A 
high accounts payable ratio normally suggests that a company is paying its suppliers in a timely manner. 
To make interpreting the ratio more intuitive, analysts often divide it into the number of days in a year:
Average Number of Days Payables Are Outstanding = 365 Days / Accounts Payable Turnover
The 2014 average number of days payables were outstanding for Starbucks was:
365 Days ÷ 13.4 = 27.2 Days
This means that, on average, Starbucks took 27 days to pay its suppliers in 2014.
Focus Company Analysis Analyzing the average number of days payables are outstanding indicates 
that in 2014 Starbucks paid its suppliers more slowly than in 2013 (27.2 days versus 25.5 days), and more 
quickly than its competitors paid their suppliers. On average, Green Mountain took 45.6 days to pay its 
suppliers and Dunkin’ Brands took 58.9 days. Suppliers like being paid as soon as possible and may 
extend benefits (e.g., faster shipments or preferential treatment when supply is limited) to companies that 
pay quickly.
A Few Cautions The accounts payable turnover ratio is an average based on all accounts  
payable. 
As such, the ratio does not tell us how quickly a company is paying each of its suppliers. It is pos-
sible for a company to pay some suppliers quickly and others late and yet still end up with an 
 
acceptable ratio. This is not meant to suggest that the ratio is not useful. It simply implies that the 
more you know about the numbers used to calculate a ratio, the more fully you can understand the 
ratio’s implications.

utilities, and salaries. The balance sheet for Starbucks lists two of these items: accrued litiga-
tion charge and accrued liabilities. Accrued liabilities are recorded at the end of the accounting 
period by recognizing an expense for the period and an associated liability.
Accrued Taxes Payable
Like individuals, corporations must pay taxes on the income they earn. Corporate tax rates are 
graduated, with large corporations paying a top federal tax rate of 35%. Corporations may also 
pay state and local income taxes and, in some cases, foreign income taxes. The notes to Star-
bucks’s Annual Report include the following information pertaining to taxes:

For Starbucks and most other corporations, income taxes represent a major cost.
Accrued Compensation and Related Costs
At the end of each accounting period, employees usually have earned salaries that have not yet 
been paid. Unpaid salaries may be reported as a separate item on the balance sheet (e.g., as 
accrued compensation) or as a part of a general accrued liabilities account, as is the case with 
Starbucks. Starbucks reports in the footnotes to its 2014 Annual Report that “accrued compen-
sation and related costs” in the accrued liabilities account amount to $437.9 million. In addition 
to reporting salaries that have been earned but not paid, companies also must report the cost of 
unpaid benefits, including retirement programs, vacation time, and health insurance. Starbucks 
refers to these items as “related costs.”
Let’s take a closer look at vacation time as an example. Typically, a business grants 
employees paid vacation time based on the number of months they have worked. The cost 
of vacation time must be recorded in the year employees earn the vacation time by working 
rather than the year they actually take vacation. If Starbucks estimates the cost of earned 
vacation time to be $125,000, accountants make the following adjusting entry at the end of 
the fiscal year:
Compensation expense (+E, -SE) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 125,000
 Accrued vacation liability (+L) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Starbucks does not separately disclose the amount of accrued vacation liability. Instead, the 
company reports this liability as part of “accrued compensation and related costs.” For most 
companies, the amount of accrued vacation liability is not large enough to warrant its own line 
item on the balance sheet.
Payroll Taxes
All payrolls are subject to a variety of taxes, including federal, state, and local income taxes; 
Social Security taxes; and federal and state unemployment taxes. Employees pay some of these 
taxes and employers pay others. While we will look at only the three largest taxes, reporting is 
similar for other types of payroll tax.
Employee Income Taxes  Employers are required to withhold income taxes for each 
employee. The amount of income tax withheld is recorded by the employer as a current 
liability and remains a liability until the amount is paid to the government (usually quarterly).
Employee and Employer FICA Taxes Social Security taxes are often called FICA taxes 
because they are required by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. These taxes are 
imposed in equal amounts on both the employee and the employer. The current Social 
Security tax rate is 6.2% on the first $117,000 paid to each employee during the year. 
In addition, a separate 1.45% Medicare tax applies to all employee income. Therefore, 
the FICA tax rate is 7.65% on income up to $117,000 and 1.45% on income above 
$117,000. Employees who earn above $200,000 have withheld an “additional Medicare 
tax” of 0.9%. Unlike all other FICA taxes, this additional Medicare tax is paid only by 
employees, not by employers. However, employers will withhold this additional tax as part of an 
employee’s payroll deductions.
Employer Unemployment Taxes  Employers are charged unemployment taxes through the 
Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and State Unemployment Tax Acts (SUTA). These 
programs provide financial support to employees who lose their jobs through no fault of their 
own. Because the rate and specified amount of wages vary by state, we will focus on federal 
unemployment taxes. The FUTA specifies a federal tax rate of 6.0% on taxable wages up to the 
first $7,000 for each employee. Employers with a good payment history may receive a credit 
for taxes paid at the state level, thus reducing their federal tax liability.
Employee compensation expense includes an employee’s salary and related costs as well as 
any funds paid to others on behalf of the employee. As a result, the cost of hiring employees is 
much more than the amount that those employees actually receive in cash.
To illustrate recording payroll taxes, let’s assume that Starbucks accumulated the following 
information in its records for the first two weeks of June 2014:
Salaries earned
$1,800,000
Income taxes withheld
275,000

Companies generally record two journal entries to account for payroll taxes. The first 
entry records the amount of cash paid to employees and the various deductions withheld from 
employees’ paychecks:

Deferred Revenues
In most business transactions, cash is paid when a product or service is delivered, or soon 
thereafter. In some cases, however, cash is paid in advance of delivery. You have probably paid 
for an airline ticket in advance. The airline company receives cash for the ticket you purchased, 
but it does not provide the service (the flight) until a future date. When a company collects cash 
before the related revenue has been earned, the cash is called deferred revenues, or, occasion-
ally, unearned revenues. A Starbucks card, which allows customers to pay for their purchases 
in advance, is an example of deferred revenues. Advantages for the customer include conve-
nience at the point of sale and the accumulation of loyalty rewards. Advantages for Starbucks 
include the ability to collect and use customers’ cash before they actually purchase anything, 
while also collecting information on the purchasing habits of individual customers. Starbucks’s 
balance sheet shown in Exhibit 9.1 shows that in 2014 the company collected $794.5 million in 
cash from customers and has yet to provide those customers with any sort of product or service. 
Starbucks explains the amount with the following note:
REAL WORLD EXCERPT:  
Annual Report
STARBUCKS
“Revenues from our stored value cards, primarily Starbucks Cards, are recognized when redeemed 
or when the likelihood of redemption, based on historical experience, is deemed to be remote. 
Outstanding customer balances are included in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets.”
Under the revenue recognition principle introduced in Chapter 3, revenue cannot be recorded 
until it has been earned. Deferred revenues are reported as a liability because cash has been col-
lected from customers but the company has not delivered a product or service, and thus the 
related revenue has not been earned by the end of the accounting period. The obligation to 
provide a product or service in the future still exists. These obligations are classified as current 
or long-term, depending on when a company expects to provide the product or service.

Notes Payable
When a company borrows money, it normally signs a formal written contract with a bank and 
reports the amount borrowed as a note payable. The contract specifies the amount borrowed, 
the date by which it must be repaid, and the interest rate associated with the borrowing.
Banks and other creditors are willing to lend cash because they will earn interest in return. 
Earning interest by loaning money to others reflects the time value of money. To the borrower, 
interest reflects the cost of using someone else’s money and is therefore an expense. To  
lenders, 
interest reflects the benefit of allowing someone else to use their money and is therefore a revenue.
You need three pieces of information to calculate interest: (1) the principal (i.e., the cash 
that was borrowed), (2) the annual interest rate, and (3) the time period for the loan. The 
interest formula is:
Principal × Annual Interest Rate × Number of Months / 12 Months = Interest for the Period
To illustrate, assume that on November 1, a company with a December 31 fiscal year-end bor-
rows $100,000 cash for one year. The annual interest rate is 12%. The interest is payable on 
April 30 and October 31 of the following year. The principal ($100,000) is payable at the matu-
rity date, October 31 of next year. The note is recorded in the accounts as follows:

Interest is an expense incurred when companies borrow money. Companies record interest 
expense for a given accounting period, regardless of when they actually pay the bank cash for 
interest. In the above example, the company borrowed the money on November 1 so it must 
record two months of interest expense at December 31, the end of the fiscal year. It does not mat-
ter that the company will not actually pay the bank cash for interest until April 30 of next year.
The computation to determine the amount of interest accrued during the two months is:
Principal × Annual Interest Rate × Number of Months / 12 Months = Interest for the Period
$100,000 × 0.12 × 2/12 months = $2,000
The entry to record interest expense and interest payable for the two months is:

On April 30 of next year, the company would make a $6,000 payment to the bank for inter-
est, which includes the $2,000 accrued and reported at the end of last year plus the $4,000 
interest accrued in the first four months of the next year. The following journal entry would be 
made on April 30:
Current Portion of Long-Term Debt
The distinction between current and long-term debt is important for both managers and ana-
lysts. A company must have sufficient cash on hand to repay current debt. To provide accurate 
information on how much of its long-term debt is due in the current year, a company must 
reclassify its long-term debt as a current liability within a year of its maturity date. Assume that 
a company signed a note to borrow $5 million at the end of December 2015. Half of the loan 
must be repaid in January 2017 and the other half is due in January 2018. The 2015, 2016, and 
2017 year-end balance sheets would report the following:
December 31, 2015
Long-term liabilities:

$5,000,000

Long-term liabilities:

December 31, 2017
Current liabilities:
 Current portion of long-term note
$2,500,000
Note in Exhibit 9.1 that Starbucks did not report any current portion of long-term debt. 
This indicates that Starbucks will not pay off any of its long-term debt in 2015. In the footnotes 
to its 2014 Annual Report, Starbucks explains that its long-term debt consists of bonds, which 
only pay interest for several years, after which the principal amount is due. Because Starbucks 
will not pay any of the principal in the coming year, all of the debt is classified as long term. 
We will cover the accounting for bonds in Chapter 10.

Refinancing Debt: Current or Long-Term Liability?
Instead of repaying a loan from current cash, a company may refinance it either by negotiating a new 
loan agreement with a new maturity date or by taking out a new loan and using the proceeds to pay off 
the old loan. If a company intends to refinance a currently maturing loan with a new long-term loan and 
has the ability to do so, the current loan should be classified as a long-term liability. It is not a current 
liability because current liabilities are short-term obligations that are expected to be paid with current 
assets within the current operating cycle or one year, whichever is longer.
U.S. GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) and IFRS (International Financial Reporting 
Standards) differ slightly in how they treat refinancing of loans. Under IFRS, the actual refinancing must 
take place by the balance sheet date. Under U.S. GAAP, the intent and ability to refinance must exist 
before the balance sheet date, but the actual refinancing does not have to have occurred.

Contingent Liabilities Reported on the Balance Sheet
Some recorded liabilities are based on estimates because the exact amount will not be known 
until a future date. For example, a contingent liability is created when a company offers a war-
ranty with the products it sells. The cost of providing future repair work must be estimated and 
recorded as a liability (and expense) in the period in which the product is sold.
As an example, assume Starbucks estimates that it will have to provide $150,000 of war-
ranty services to customers who purchased coffee brewing and espresso equipment this year. In 
addition to recording the sale of the brewing and espresso equipment, Starbucks would record 
the following:

Whether a contingent liability is reported on the balance sheet, in the footnotes, or not at 
all depends on two factors: (1) the probability of a future economic sacrifice and (2) the abil-
ity of management to estimate the amount of the liability. The following table illustrates the 
possibilities:
Contingent Liabilities Reported in the Footnotes
Each of the liabilities that we have discussed is reported on the balance sheet at a specific dollar 
amount because each involves the probable future sacrifice of economic benefits. Some trans-
actions or events create only a reasonably possible (but not probable) future sacrifice of eco-
nomic benefits. These situations create contingent liabilities that are reported in the footnotes, 
but not on a company’s balance sheet.

The probabilities of occurrence are defined in the following manner:

 Probable—The future event or events are likely to occur.

 Reasonably possible—The chance of the future event or events occurring is more than 
remote but less than likely.

 Remote—The chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.
The assessment of future probabilities is inherently subjective, but both U.S. GAAP and IFRS provide 
some guidance. Under U.S. GAAP, “probable” has been defined as likely to occur, which is commonly 
interpreted to mean having a greater than 70% chance of occurring. Under IFRS, “probable” is defined as 
more likely than not to occur, which implies more than a 50% chance of occurring. This difference means 
that for some contingent liabilities, IFRS would require the reporting of a liability on the balance sheet 
whereas GAAP would simply require footnote disclosure.
It’s a Matter of Degree

In summary,

 A liability that both is probable and can be reasonably estimated must be recorded and 
reported on the balance sheet.

 A liability that is reasonably possible must be disclosed in a footnote whether the amount 
can be estimated or not.

 Remote contingencies do not require any type of disclosure.
For several years, Starbucks reported a contingent liability associated with a legal dispute 
with Kraft Foods Group. In late 2013, Starbucks lost the dispute and was ordered by an arbi-
trator to pay Kraft over $2 billion. Below are excerpts from Starbucks’s 2013 Annual Report:
Consistent with the table shown earlier, Starbucks did not initially record a liability because 
management decided it could not reasonably estimate the amount of the potential loss. There-
fore, disclosure in a footnote was sufficient. However, once the arbitrator ruled against Star-
bucks, the company was required to report a liability on its balance sheet and an associated loss 
on its income statement.
“We believe we had valid claims of material breach by Kraft under the Agreement that allowed 
us to terminate the Agreement and certain other relationships with Kraft without compensation 
to Kraft.
Kraft denied it had materially breached the Agreement. On November 29, 2010, Starbucks 
received a notice of arbitration from Kraft putting the commercial dispute between the parties 
into binding arbitration pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.
. . . prior to receiving the arbitrator’s ruling we could not reasonably estimate the possible loss. 
Accordingly, no loss contingency was recorded for this matter.
On November 12, 2013, the arbitrator ordered Starbucks to pay Kraft $2,227.5 million in 
damages plus prejudgment interest and attorneys’ fees. We have estimated prejudgment interest, 
which includes an accrual through the estimated payment date, and attorneys’ fees to be 
approximately $556.6 million. As a result, we recorded a litigation charge of $2,784.1 million in 
our fiscal 2013 operating results.”

Working Capital Management
Information about current liabilities is very important to managers and analysts because these 
obligations must be paid in the near future. Analysts say that a company has liquidity if it has the 
ability to meet its current obligations. A number of financial measures are useful in evaluating 
liquidity, including the current ratio (introduced in Chapter 2) and the dollar amount of working 
capital. Working capital is defined as the dollar difference between current assets and current 
liabilities. Working capital is important to both managers and financial analysts because it has a 
significant impact on the health and profitability of a company. Starbucks reported current assets 
of $4,168.7 million and current liabilities of $3,038.7 million at the end of fiscal year 2014, which 
results in working capital of $1,130.0 million. Working capital reflects the amount Starbucks 
would have left over if it used all of its current assets to pay off all of its current liabilities.
The working capital accounts are actively managed to achieve a balance between a com-
pany’s short-term obligations and the resources to satisfy those obligations. If a business has 
too little working capital, it runs the risk of not being able to meet its obligations. On the other 
hand, too much working capital may tie up resources in unproductive assets. Excess inventory, 
for example, ties up dollars that could be invested more profitably elsewhere in the business 
and incurs additional costs associated with storage and deterioration.
Changes in working capital accounts are also important to managers and analysts because 
they have a direct impact on the cash flows from operating activities reported on the statement 
of cash flows.

Many working capital accounts have a direct relationship to income-producing activities. Accounts 
receivable, for example, are related to sales revenue: Accounts receivable increase when sales are made 
on credit. Cash is collected when the customer pays the bill. Similarly, accounts payable increase when 
inventory is purchased on credit. A cash outflow occurs when the account is paid. Changes in working 
capital accounts that are related to income-producing activities, called operating working capital, must 
be considered when computing cash flows from operating activities. We discuss how to create the cash

as long-term notes payable and bonds payable. Typically, a long-term liability will require pay-
ment more than one year in the future.
Most companies borrow money on a long-term basis in order to purchase assets, like prop-
erty or equipment. In some cases, a company may pledge specific assets as security for repay-
ment. If the company defaults on the loan, then the bank has the right to take ownership of 
the assets. A loan supported by this type of agreement is called secured debt. Unsecured debt 
refers to an agreement in which the bank relies primarily on the borrower’s integrity and gen-
eral earning power to repay the loan.
Long-Term Notes Payable and Bonds
Companies can raise capital directly from a number of financial service organizations includ-
ing banks, insurance companies, and pension plans. Raising capital from one of these organiza-
tions is known as a private placement. The resulting liability is often called a note payable, 
which is a written promise to pay a stated sum at one or more specified future dates called the 
maturity date(s).
In many cases, a company’s need for capital exceeds the financial ability of any single bank 
or other creditor. In these situations, the company may issue publicly traded debt called bonds. 
The opportunity to sell a bond security in established markets provides bondholders with an 
important benefit. Without involving the company, bondholders can sell their bond securities 
to other investors prior to maturity if they have an immediate need for cash. We will discuss 
bonds in detail in the next chapter.
Accounting for long-term debt is based on the same concepts used in accounting for short-
term notes payable. A liability is recorded when the debt is incurred and interest expense is 
recorded with the passage of time.
Business operations are global in nature, with many corporations operating manufacturing 
facilities around the world. In order to support these foreign operations, companies sometimes 
borrow money from foreign banks. Borrowing money in a foreign currency raises some inter-
esting accounting and management issues.
LONG-TERM LIABILITIES  
All of the entity’s obligations 
that are not classified as current 
liabilities.
Many corporations with foreign operations elect to finance those operations with foreign debt to lessen 
exchange rate risk. Exchange rate risk exists because the relative value of each nation’s currency varies 
on virtually a daily basis.
A U.S. corporation that conducts business operations in England might decide to borrow British 
pounds to finance its operations there. The profits from the business, which will be in pounds, can be 
used to pay off the debt, which is in pounds. If this business earns profits in pounds but pays off debt in 
dollars, however, it will be exposed to exchange rate risk because the relative value of the dollar and the 
pound fluctuates.
In attempting to mitigate exchange rate risk, Amazon.com states the following in the footnotes to its 
2013 Annual Report:
“We have internationally-focused websites for the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, 
Canada, China, Italy, Spain, Brazil, India, Mexico, and Australia. Net sales generated from these

Lease Liabilities
Companies often lease assets rather than purchase them. For example, leasing extra delivery 
trucks during a busy period is more economical than owning them if they are not needed during 
the rest of the year. When a company leases an asset, it enters into a contractual agreement with 
the owner of the asset. In the language of contracts (and accounting), the party that owns the 
asset is referred to as the lessor. The party that pays for the right to use the asset is referred to as 
the lessee. For accounting purposes, a lessee can lease an asset by signing either an operating 
lease or a capital lease.
The terms of an operating lease are similar to a short-term rental and therefore do not 
require companies to recognize a lease asset or a lease liability on their balance sheets. In con-
trast, the terms of a capital lease resemble the financing and outright purchasing of an asset 
and therefore require companies to recognize both a lease asset and a lease liability on their 
balance sheets. Since managers often prefer to minimize the liabilities they report on their bal-
ance sheets, they have an incentive to structure lease contracts so that they are accounted for as 
operating leases rather than capital leases.
How do accountants determine if a lease should be recorded as an operating lease or a capi-
tal lease? GAAP helps guide them through this determination by stating that if a lease meets 
any of the following four criteria, it is considered a capital lease:

 The lease term is 75% or more of the asset’s expected economic life.

 Ownership of the asset is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term.

 The lease contract permits the lessee to purchase the asset at a price that is lower than its fair 
market value.

 When the lease is signed, the present value of the lease payments is 90% or more of the fair 
market value of the leased asset.
As an example of an operating lease, assume that on December 31, Starbucks signs an 
operating lease contract to rent five delivery trucks for the month of January for $10,000 to be 
paid at the end of January. No entry is recorded at the time the lease is signed on December 31. 
Rent expense is recorded in January, when the trucks are actually used.

To record a capital lease, it is necessary to determine the current cash equivalent of the 
required lease payments. Assume that Starbucks signs a four-year lease for new delivery trucks. 
The accountant has determined that the lease is a capital lease with a current cash equivalent of 
$250,000. Once the lease is signed, Starbucks records the transaction in a manner similar to the 
actual purchase of delivery trucks:
OPERATING LEASE  
Does not require a lessee to 
recognize an asset or liability.
CAPITAL LEASE  
Does require a lessee to 
recognize an asset and a liability.

For reporting purposes, accountants must convert, or translate, foreign debt into U.S. dollars at the 
end of the accounting period in order to report the debt on a U.S. company’s balance sheet. In the same 
footnote excerpted above, Amazon.com discusses how it does this by stating:
“Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end 
exchange rates. . . .”

In this example, you were given the current cash equivalent of the lease. In the next section

present values.
COMP U T ING  P R ES E N T  V ALUE S
Our discussion of capital leases raises an interesting question about liabilities: Is the liabil-
ity today the amount of cash that will be paid in the future? For example, if I agree to pay 
you $10,000 five years from now, should I report a liability of $10,000 on my personal bal-
ance sheet? If I can earn interest on my money, the answer is “no.” To understand why, it is 
important for you to understand that money invested in an interest-bearing account grows 
over time. We briefly introduced this concept earlier in the chapter and referred to it as the 
time value of money. The time value of money plays an important role in how companies 
report long-term liabilities, such as the capital lease we just discussed as well as bonds, the 
topic of Chapter 10.
The concept of present value (PV) is based on the time value of money. Quite simply, money 
received today is worth more than money to be received one year from today (or at any other 
future date) because it can be used to earn interest. If you invest $1,000 today at 10%, you will 
have $1,100 in one year. In contrast, if you receive $1,000 one year from today, you will lose 
the opportunity to earn the $100 in interest revenue. The difference between the $1,000 and the 
$1,100 is the interest that can be earned during the year, which reflects the time value of money.
In one of your math classes, you have probably already solved some problems involving 
the time value of money. In the typical problem, you are told a certain dollar amount has been 
deposited in a savings account earning a specified rate of interest. You are asked to compute 
the dollar amount in the savings account after a certain number of years. This is an example 
of a future value (FV) problem: How much is a given dollar amount today worth in the future 
if it grows at a specified interest rate? For example, if you deposited $100 today in a savings 
account that earns 10% interest, how much would you have after one year?
PRESENT VALUE  
The current value of an amount to 
be received in the future; a future 
amount discounted for compound 
interest.
FUTURE VALUE  
The sum to which an amount 
will increase as the result of 
compound interest.
ANSWER: $110
In this chapter we focus on how to solve the opposite problem. In present value problems, 
you are asked to compute the amount you would need to deposit today at a specified interest 
rate to have a given dollar amount in the future. For example, if you needed $110 in one year, 
how much would you need to deposit in a savings account today if the savings account earns 
10% interest?

ANSWER: $100
There are two basic types of present value problems: those involving single amounts like the 
example above and those involving a stream of future amounts. Understanding and being able 
to compute both types is important when accounting for certain long-term liabilities.
Present Value of a Single Amount
To compute the present value of a single amount, you must discount the amount to be received in the 
future at i interest rate for n periods. The formula to compute the present value of a single amount is
Present value =
× Amount
1
(1 + i!)n
While the formula is not difficult to use, most analysts use present value tables, calculators, 
or Excel. We strongly encourage you to visit Connect for tutorials on how to compute present 
values using each of these tools.
For all examples that follow, we provide in the box the inputs required to compute each present 
value using tables, calculators, and Excel.
Assume that today is January 1, 2016, and you need to make a $1,000 cash payment on Decem-
ber 31, 2018. At an interest rate of 10% per year, how much would you need to deposit today to 
have exactly $1,000 on December 31, 2018? You could discount the amount year by year to fig-
ure out how much you would need to deposit today, but it is easier to use Table E.1, Appendix E, 
Present Value of $1. For i = 10%, n = 3 periods, we find that the present value of $1 is 0.75131. 
The present value of $1,000 to be paid at the end of three years can be computed as follows:
$1,000 × 0.75131 = $751.31
From Table E.1: interest rate (i) = 10%, periods (n) = 3: Factor = 0.75131
Using Excel: rate (i) = .10, nper (n) = 3, pmt = $0, FV = –$1,000
Using Calculator: rate (i) = 10, periods (n) = 3, pmt = $0, FV = –$1,000
Once you have computed a present value amount, it is important that you understand 
what it means. The $751.31 is the amount you would have to deposit today in order to have 
exactly $1,000 three years from today, assuming an interest rate of 10%. Conceptually, you 
should be indifferent between paying $751.31 today and paying $1,000 in three years. If 
you had $751.31 today and did not want to worry about having to come up with $1,000 in 
three years, you could simply deposit the money in a savings account and at 10% interest it

Present Value of an Annuity
Instead of a single amount, many business problems involve multiple cash payments over a 
number of periods. An annuity is a series of consecutive payments characterized by
 
1. An equal dollar amount each period.
 
2. Interest periods of equal length (year, half a year, quarterly, or monthly).
 
3. The same interest rate each period.
Examples of annuities include monthly rent payments on an apartment or quarterly lease pay-
ments on a car.
The present value of an annuity is the value now of a series of equal amounts to be 
received (or paid out) for some specified number of periods in the future. We compute the 
present value of an annuity by discounting each of the equal periodic amounts back to today. 
ANNUITY  
A series of periodic cash receipts 
or payments that are equal in 
amount each interest period.
1Though not the focus of this chapter, we provide tables for computing future values in Appendix E. You use future 
value tables the same way you use present value tables. For example, to compute how much you would have after 
three years if you deposited $751.31 in a savings account earning 10% interest, you would use Table E.3 (i = 10%,  
n = 3 periods) and multiply $751.31 × 1.33100. The answer: $1,000.
1. The present value will decrease.
2. $10,000 × 0.61391 = $6,139.10

So far we have discussed the first type of present value problems—those involving a single future 
amount. In the next section, we will discuss annuities, which involve a stream of future amounts. 
Before you move on, complete the following questions to test your understanding of the present value 
concepts we have covered so far.
 
1. If the interest rate in a present value problem increases from 8% to 10%, will the present 
value increase or decrease?
 
2. Assuming an annual interest rate of 5%, what amount should you deposit today if you need 
$10,000 in 10 years?
After you have completed your answers, check them below.

We can compute the present value of this annuity more easily, however, by using Table E.2, 
Appendix E, as follows:
$1,000 × 2.48685 = $2,486.85
From Table E.2: interest rate (i) = 10%, periods (n) = 3: Factor = 2.48685
Using Excel: rate (i) = .10, nper (n) = 3, pmt = −$1,000, FV = $0
Using Calculator: rate (i) = 10, periods (n) = 3, pmt = −$1,000, FV = $0
Let’s now connect the amount we computed above to the three required $1,000 payments. 
As shown in Exhibit 9.3, if you deposited $2,486.85 today at an interest rate of 10%, that 
amount would grow to $2,735.54 after one year ($2,486.85 + interest of $248.69). At that 
point you would make your first $1,000 payment and have $1,735.54 left. The $1,735.54 
would grow to $1,909.09 over the next year ($1,735.54 + interest of $173.55). At that point 
you would make your second $1,000 payment and have $909.09 left. The $909.09 would 
grow to exactly $1,000 over the next year ($909.09 + interest of $90.91), and you would be 
able to make your last $1,000 payment. Thus, at an interest rate of 10%, depositing $2,486.85

Accounting Applications of Present Values
Many business transactions that affect long-term liabilities require accountants to compute 
present values. We provide three brief examples below before transitioning to accounting for 
bonds in the next chapter.
Computing the Amount of a Liability with a Single Payment
On January 1, 2016, Starbucks bought some new delivery trucks. The company signed a note 
and agreed to pay $200,000 on December 31, 2017. This type of arrangement is often referred 
to as a “non-interest-bearing” note since no interest payments are required over the life of the 
note. Do not confuse “non-interest-bearing” with “no interest.” The interest is simply built into 
the final payment, in this case the $200,000 payment on December 31, 2017. Assume that the 
market interest rate applicable to the note was determined to be 12%.
To record this transaction, the accountant must first compute the present value of a single 
amount to be paid in the future. This amount is the present value, or current cash equivalent, 
which reflects the value of the trucks today. The problem can be shown graphically as follows:
January 1, 2016
Present value
December 31, 2016
-$200,000
December 31, 2017
LEARNING OBJECTIVE 9-8
Apply the present value concept 
to the reporting of long-term 
liabilities.
2To compute the future value of an annuity, you would use Table E.4, Appendix E. For example, at an interest rate 
of 10 percent, if you deposited $1,000 at the end of each year for three years (with no withdrawals), you would have 
$3,310 ($1,000 × 3.31000, the future value factor for n = 3, i = 10%).
Truth in Advertising
A  Q U E ST I O N
O F  E T H I C S
Online and television advertisements are easy to misinterpret if the consumer does not understand the 
time value of money. For example, perhaps you have seen advertisements that promise “No payments for 
one year!” It is important to realize that “no payments” does not mean “no interest.” In almost all cases, 
during the “no payments” year, interest is accruing (being added to the amount owed) and, depending on 
the interest rate, can add significantly to the total amount customers must pay back.
Another misleading advertisement relates to lotteries, which often promise to make winners instant 
millionaires. In some cases, however, the lottery amount is paid out over a long period of time, for 
example, $25,000 each year for 40 years. The winner will receive $1,000,000 ($25,000 × 40 years), but 
the present value of this annuity at 8% is only $298,000. While most winners are happy to get the money, 
they are not really millionaires.
Some consumer advocates argue that consumers should not have to study present value concepts to 
understand such advertisements. While some of these criticisms may be valid, the quality of information 
contained in advertisements that include interest rates has improved over time.
today would allow you to make the three required $1,000 payments at the end of the next 
three years.2
Interest Rates and Interest Periods
The preceding illustrations assumed annual periods for compounding and discounting. 
Although interest rates are almost always quoted on an annual basis, most compounding peri-
ods encountered in business are less than one year. When interest periods are less than a year, 
the values of n and i must be adjusted to be consistent with the length of the interest period.
To illustrate, 12% interest compounded annually for five years requires the use of n = 5 and 
i = 12%. If compounding is quarterly, however, the interest period is one-quarter of a year (i.e., four 
periods per year), and the quarterly interest rate is one-quarter of the annual rate (i.e., 3% per quar-
ter). Therefore, 12% interest compounded quarterly for five years requires use of n = 20 and i = 3%.

The present value of the $200,000 payment is computed as follows:
$200,000 × 0.79719 = $159,438
From Table E.1: interest rate (i) = 12%, periods (n) = 2: Factor = 0.79719

Each payment includes principal plus interest on the unpaid balance at 11% per year. The 
annual payments are due on December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018. This problem can be shown 
graphically as follows:

The present value of the note is the amount Starbucks would have to deposit today at 11% 
interest to cover the three $163,685 payments. This is an annuity because payments are made in 
three equal installments. The present value of the note is computed as follows:
$163,685 × 2.44371 = $399,999
From Table E.2: interest rate (i) = 11%, periods (n) = 3: Factor = 2.44371

Present Values Involving Both an Annuity and a Single Payment
In some business situations, a company may agree to make periodic payments (an annuity) in 
addition to a single payment at the end of the agreement. Assume Starbucks bought new cof-
fee roasting equipment and agreed to pay the supplier $1,000 per month for 20 months and an 
additional $40,000 at the end of 20 months. The supplier is charging 12% interest per year, or 
1% per month.
In this type of problem, you can determine the present value of the total obligation by 
 
computing the present value of each part. In other words, you compute the present value of 
the annuity and the present value of the single payment and add the two amounts together, as 
follows:
Step 1: 
Compute the present value of the annuity using Table E.2, Appendix E:
$1,000 × 18.04555 = $18,046
From Table E.2: interest rate (i) = 1%, periods (n) = 20: Factor = 18.04555
Using Excel / Calculator: see single calculation below
Step 2: 
Compute the present value of the single payment using Table E.1, Appendix E:
$40,000 × 0.81954 = $32,782
From Table E.1: interest rate (i) = 1%, periods (n) = 20: Factor = 0.81954
Using Excel / Calculator: see single calculation below
Step 3: 
Add the two amounts to determine the present value of the total obligation:
$18,046
(present value of 20 months of annuity payments)
+  *********32,782
(present value of single sum after 20 months)
$50,828
(present value of the total obligation)
The $50,828 is the present value of all the cash payments that Starbucks must make under 
this agreement. Starbucks would record this amount as a liability. This amount can be com-
puted as a single calculation using Excel or a Calculator as follows:
Using Excel: rate (i) = .01, nper (n) = 20, pmt = −$1,000, FV = −$40,000
Using Calculator: rate (i) = 1, periods (n) = 20, pmt = −$1,000, FV = −$40,000

In the next chapter, we will use the present value techniques you have just learned to under-
stand how to account for bonds.
(Try to answer the questions before proceeding to the suggested solutions that follow.) Patagonia 
completed several transactions during the year. In each case, decide if a liability (or liabilities) should 
be recorded and, if so, determine the amount. Assume the current date is December 31, and all trans-
actions occurred over the last year.
 
1. Employees earned salaries of $100,000, which have not been paid at year-end.
 
2. Patagonia borrowed $100,000 on June 30 at an annual interest rate of 7%. As of December 31, no 
payments associated with this loan have been made.
 
3. A customer prepaid $250 for a custom waterproof jacket. The customer will pick up the jacket next 
month.
 
4. The company lost a lawsuit for $250,000 but plans to appeal.
 
5. A new truck was leased for a period equal to 85% of the expected life of the truck.
 
6. On December 31, a bank loaned money to Patagonia. Patagonia agreed to repay the bank $100,000 
on December 31 next year. The annual interest rate is 5%.
 
7. Patagonia signed a loan agreement that requires it to pay $50,000 per year for 20 years. The annual 
interest rate is 8%.
SUGGESTED SOLUTION
 
1. A liability of $100,000 should be recorded.
 
2. The amount borrowed ($100,000) should be recorded as a liability on June 30. In addition, interest 
accrued but not paid should be recorded as a liability at year-end. This amount is $100,000 × 7% × 
 
6/12 = $3,500.
 
3. The amount the customer paid ($250) is a liability until the customer picks up the jacket, at which 
point the $250 becomes revenue.
 
4. Unless Patagonia can make a convincing argument that it is not probable it will have to pay the 
$250,000, the company should record the amount as a liability.
 
5. The lease covers more than 75% of the estimated life of the truck. It should therefore be accounted 
for as a capital lease and a liability should be recorded. The amount is the present value of the lease 
payments (which were not given in the problem).
 
6. Patagonia should record a liability equal to the present value of the obligation. Using Table E.1, 
Appendix E (i = 5%, n = 1), the amount is $100,000 × 0.95238 = $95,238.
 
7. Patagonia should record a liability for the present value of the obligation. Using Table E.2, Appen-
dix E (i = 8%, n = 20), the amount is $50,000 × 9.81815 = $490,908.

Chapter Supplement B
Deferred Taxes
In Chapter 8 you learned that companies follow GAAP for financial reporting but the Internal Revenue 
Code when creating their tax returns. Following different rules can create what are called temporary 
tax differences. Temporary tax differences are the result of a company reporting revenues and expenses 
on its income statement in a different time period than it reports them on its tax return. If the difference 
between financial reporting and tax reporting will result in a lower tax bill in the future, it results in the 
creation of an asset. If the difference will result in a higher tax bill in the future, it results in the creation 
of a liability. We call these assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. In this 
chapter supplement, we focus on understanding deferred tax liabilities.
A company creates a deferred tax liability when it:

 Reports revenue on this period’s income statement that it does not report on its tax return until a 
future period, or

 Reports an expense on this period’s tax return that it does not report on its income statement until a 
future period.
Both circumstances result in this period’s accounting income reported on the income statement being 
higher than this period’s tax income reported on the company’s tax return. An example is when a com-
pany pays expenses in advance. The company is required to include the advance payment as an expense 
on its tax return in the period it pays the cash. For financial reporting purposes, the company is required 
to recognize the advance payment as an asset on its balance sheet until it actually incurs the expense in a 
future period. When this happens, the company then uses the asset to satisfy the expense.
Another accounting area that often results in a deferred tax liability is depreciation. Many companies 
use straight-line depreciation for financial reporting purposes and an accelerated depreciation method for 
tax purposes. Let’s consider a simple example. Assume that in the current year, Starbucks owns a build-
ing that originally cost $10 million. The current book value (cost less accumulated depreciation) on the 
balance sheet is $8.5 million. For tax purposes, the book value is $6.5 million. The $2 million difference 
is a result of Starbucks using straight-line depreciation for financial reporting and accelerated deprecia-
tion for tax purposes. Starbucks has been able to delay or defer paying federal income taxes by reporting 
more depreciation on its tax return than it reports on its income statement. The amount of deferred tax 
liability is computed by multiplying the timing difference by the corporate tax rate (35%):
Deferred Tax Liability = $2 million × .35 = $700,000
If there are no other deferred tax items, Starbucks will report a deferred tax liability on its balance sheet 
of $700,000.
At the end of the following year, Starbucks would again compare the GAAP book value of the building to 
the tax book value. Assume that the GAAP book value is $8.2 million and the tax book value is $6 million. 
The timing difference is $2.2 million, resulting in a deferred tax liability of $770,000 ($2.2 million × .35).
The income tax expense reported under GAAP is the amount needed to complete a journal entry once 
the company has computed the amount it will pay the IRS for taxes and the change in its deferred taxes. 
Based on our example, the change in the deferred tax liability for Starbucks is $70,000 ($770,000 −  
$700,000). Assume the company completes its tax return and determines it owes the IRS $550,000 for 
taxes. The company would record the following:
Income tax expense (+E, -SE) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
620,000
 Deferred taxes (+L) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The computation of deferred taxes involves some complexities that are discussed in advanced accounting 
courses. At this point, you need to understand only that deferred tax assets and liabilities are caused by 
temporary differences between the income statement and tax return. Each temporary difference has an 
impact on the income statement in one accounting period and the tax return in another.
TEMPORARY TAX 
DIFFERENCES 
Result from companies 
reporting revenues and 
expenses on their income 
statements in a different time 
period than they report them on 
their tax returns.
DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY 
Is created when differences 
in financial reporting and tax 
reporting cause accounting 
income to be higher than tax 
income in a given period.

9-1. Define, measure, and report current liabilities.  p. 460
Accountants define liabilities as probable future sacrifices of economic benefits that arise from past 
transactions. Liabilities are classified on the balance sheet as either current or long term. Current 
liabilities are short-term obligations that will be paid within the current operating cycle of the busi-
ness or within one year of the balance sheet date, whichever is longer. Long-term liabilities are all 
obligations not classified as current.
 
9-2. Compute and interpret the accounts payable turnover ratio.  p. 462
To compute this ratio, divide cost of goods sold by average accounts payable. This ratio reflects 
how quickly management is paying its suppliers and is considered to be a measure of liquidity, or a 
company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations.
 
9-3. Report notes payable and explain the time value of money.  p. 466
Companies sign a note when they borrow money. The note specifies the amount borrowed, when 
it must be repaid, and the interest rate associated with the loan. Accountants report the amount 
borrowed, and any unpaid interest, as liabilities. The time value of money refers to the principle 
that a given amount of money is worth more today than it is in the future due to its earnings 
potential.
 
9-4. Report contingent liabilities.  p. 468
A contingent liability is a potential liability that has arisen as the result of a past event. An example 
is a warranty. The past event is the sale of the item. The potential liability is the possibility that the 
company will have to honor the warranty. Contingent liabilities are reported on the balance sheet if 
they can be estimated and are probable. If they are only reasonably possible, then they are reported 
in the footnotes.
 
9-5. Explain the importance of working capital and its impact on cash flows.  p. 470
Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. Working capital is used to fund 
the operating activities of a business. Changes in working capital accounts affect the statement of 
cash flows. 
 
9-6. Report long-term liabilities.  p. 471
Any liability that is not a current liability is a long-term liability. Many long-term liabilities are 
reported on the balance sheet at their present value, which is the amount a company would have to 
pay today at a given interest rate to satisfy the obligation.
 
9-7. Compute and explain present values.  p. 473
The present value concept is based on the time value of money. Money received today is worth 
more than the same amount of money to be received in the future because of interest rates. We can 
compute the present value of a single amount or the present value of a stream of amounts (called an 
annuity) using present value tables, Excel, or a financial calculator.
 
9-8. Apply the present value concept to the reporting of long-term liabilities.  p. 477
A liability involves the payment of some amount at a future date. With long-term liabilities, the 
reported liability is not the dollar value of the future payment(s), but rather the present value of the 
future payment(s).
In this chapter, we focused on the reporting of current liabilities and introduced how to compute and 
interpret present values. In the next chapter, we discuss a firm’s capital structure and how long-term 
liabilities, like bonds, fit into that structure.

Recording a Note Payable through Its Time to Maturity with Discussion of Management 
Strategy
Many businesses borrow money during periods of increased business activity to finance inventory and 
accounts receivable. Neiman Marcus is one of America’s most prestigious retailers. Each Christmas sea-
son, Neiman Marcus builds up its inventory to meet the needs of Christmas shoppers. A large portion of 
these Christmas sales are on credit. As a result, Neiman Marcus often collects cash from the sales several 
months after Christmas. Assume that on November 1 of this year, Neiman Marcus borrowed $4.8 million 
cash from Bank of America to meet short-term obligations. Neiman Marcus signed an interest-bearing 
note and promised to repay the $4.8 million in six months. The annual interest rate was 8%. All interest 
will accrue and be paid when the note is due in six months. Neiman Marcus’s accounting period ends 
December 31.
Required:
 1. Provide the journal entry to record the note on November 1.
 2. Provide any adjusting entry required at the end of the annual accounting period on December 31.
 3. Provide the journal entry to record payment of the note and interest on the maturity date, April 30.

annual report indicates, McDonald’s both owns and leases property:
The Company owns and leases real estate primarily in connection with its restaurant business. The 
Company identifies and develops sites that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit 
potential to the Company. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases 
for restaurant sites, which ensures long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs.

reported as a liability, how should the amount be measured?
Evaluating Lease Alternatives
As the new vice president for consumer products at Whole Foods, you are attending a meeting to dis-
cuss a serious problem associated with delivering merchandise to customers. Bob Smith, director of 
logistics, summarized the problem: “It’s easy to understand; we just don’t have enough delivery trucks 
given our recent growth.” Barb Bader from the accounting department responded: “Maybe it’s easy to 
understand, but it’s impossible to do anything. Because of Wall Street’s concern about the amount of 
debt on our balance sheet, we’re under a freeze and can’t borrow money to acquire new assets. There’s 
nothing we can do.”
On the way back to your office after the meeting, your assistant offers a suggestion: “Why don’t we 
just lease the trucks we need? That way we can get the assets we want without having to record a liability 
on the balance sheet.”
How would you respond to this suggestion?

Determining Financial Statement Effects of Various Liabilities (AP9-3)
Dell Computers is a leader in the computer industry with over $59 billion in sales each year. A recent 
annual report for Dell contained the following note:
Warranty
We record warranty liabilities at the time of sale for the estimated costs that may be incurred under our 
limited warranty. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units currently 
under warranty, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims on those units, and cost per claim to 
satisfy our warranty obligation.
 1. Assume that estimated warranty costs for the current year are $500 million and that $400 million of 
warranty work was performed during the year. Provide the journal entries required to recognize war-
ranty expense and the warranty services provided during the year. Assume that all warranty services 
were paid for with cash.
Walt Disney is a well-recognized brand in the entertainment industry with products ranging from broad-
cast media to parks and resorts. The following note is from a recent annual report:
Revenue Recognition
For non-expiring, multi-day tickets to our theme parks, we recognize revenue over a three-year period 
based on estimated usage patterns which are derived from historical usage patterns.
 2. Assume that in the current year, Disney collected $90 million in multiday tickets that will be used 
in the future. Also in the current year, Disney estimates that $5 million worth of multiday tickets 
that have been sold in the past will not be used (e.g., they have been lost by customers). Provide the 
journal entries required to recognize (a) the receipt of the $90 million in cash and (b) the $5 million 
that Disney estimates will not be used.

Making Decisions about Contingent Liabilities
For each of the following situations, determine whether the company should (a) report a liability on the 
balance sheet, (b) disclose a contingent liability in the footnotes, or (c) not report the situation. Justify 
your conclusions.
 1. An automobile company introduces a new car. Past experience demonstrates that lawsuits will be filed as 
soon as the new model is involved in any accidents. The company can be certain that at least one jury will 
award damages to people injured in an accident, but it is unable to estimate the amount of any payout.
 2. A research scientist determines that the company’s best-selling product may infringe on another 
company’s patent. If the other company discovers the infringement and files suit, which is unlikely, 
your company could lose millions.
 3. As part of land development for a new housing project, your company has polluted a natural lake. Under 
state law, you must clean up the lake once you complete development. The development project will take 
five to eight years to complete. Current estimates indicate that it will cost $3 million to clean up the lake.
 4. Your company has just been notified that it is being sued by a customer. The probability of the cus-
tomer winning is deemed to be probable, but the amount of any loss cannot be reliably estimated.
 5. A key customer is unhappy with the quality of a major construction project. The company believes 
that the customer is being unreasonable but, to maintain goodwill, has decided to do $250,000 in 
repairs next year.

increase, decrease, or remain the same:
 
a. Purchased merchandise on credit.
 
b. Paid an account payable in cash.
 
c. Accrued payroll for the month but did not pay it.
 
d. Borrowed money from the bank. The term of the note is 90 days.
 
e. Reclassified a long-term note as a current liability.
 f. Paid accrued interest expense.
 
g. Disclosed a contingent liability based on a pending lawsuit.
 
h. Paid back the bank for money borrowed in (d). Ignore interest.
 i. Collected cash from a customer for services that will be performed in the next accounting period 
 
(i.e., deferred revenues are recorded).

After hearing a knock at your front door, you are surprised to see the Prize Patrol from your state’s online 
lottery agency. Upon opening your door, you learn you have won the lottery of $12.5 million. You dis-
cover that you have three options: (1) you can receive $1.25 million per year for the next 10 years, (2) you 
can have $10 million today, or (3) you can have $4 million today and receive $1 million for each of the 
next eight years. Your lawyer tells you that it is reasonable to expect to earn an annual return of 10% on 
investments. All else equal, which option do you prefer? What factors influence your decision?
(Chapter Supplement B) Recording and Reporting Deferred Income Tax: Depreciation
Mansfield Corporation purchased a new warehouse at the beginning of Year 1 for $1,000,000. The 
expected life of the asset is 20 years with no residual value. The company uses straight-line deprecia-
tion for financial reporting purposes and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes (the accelerated 
method results in $100,000 of depreciation each year). The company’s federal income tax rate is 34%. 
The company determined its income tax obligations for Year 1 and Year 2 were $400,000 and $625,000, 
respectively.
Required:
 1. Compute the deferred income tax amount reported on the balance sheet for each year. Explain why 
the deferred income tax is a liability.
 2. Compute income tax expense for each year.

to deposit $112,000 in a savings account on January 1 of this year. The savings account will earn 6% 
annually. Any interest earned will be added to the fund at year-end (rather than withdrawn).
 
b. At the end of each year, a different friend, Claire, plans to deposit $9,000 in a savings account. The 
account will earn 9% annual interest, which will be added to the fund balance at year-end. Claire will 
make her first deposit at the end of this year.
Required (show computations and round to the nearest dollar):
 1. In (a), how much will be available at the end of five years? What is the total interest earned over the 
four years?

Financial Reporting and Analysis Case
Analyzing Hidden Interest in a Real Estate Deal: Present Value
You are researching the housing market in Bloomington, Indiana, and you come upon an advertisement 
offering to sell a house for $240,000 with a zero interest rate mortgage. All you have to do is agree to 
make $4,000 payments ($240,000 ÷ 60 months) at the end of each month for five years. If you do so, 
the advertisement says you will not be charged any interest. When you see the offer, mortgages are typi-
cally being granted at a 6% annual interest rate.
Required:
 1. If the builder demands a 6% return on investment, what is the actual value of the house? How much 
“implied” interest will you pay over the five years that you are paying off the house? The present 
value factor for an annuity with 60 periods and an interest rate of .5% (6%/12 months) is 51.72556.
 2. If the builder is actually demanding a 6% return on investment, why would she advertise the mort-
gage as a “zero interest rate mortgage”?

In 1995, Amazon.com opened its virtual doors and began selling books online. The com-
pany grew rapidly and went public two years later. Today, Amazon does much more than sell 
books. Its mission is to be “Earth’s most customer-centric company where people can find 
and discover virtually anything they want to buy online.” Amazon has over 150,000 full-time 
and part-time employees worldwide and reported revenues of $89 billion in fiscal 2014. The 
technology and infrastructure necessary to support Amazon’s growth could not have been 
developed without billions of dollars of investment. One of the strengths of our economic 
system is the ability of companies to raise large amounts of money from investors. In this 
chapter, we will discuss how companies raise money from investors by issuing debt securities 
in the bond markets. The bond markets are where companies go to sell debt securities and 
where investors go to purchase and trade debt securities. The debt securities purchased and 
traded in the bond markets are generically referred to as “bonds” by the press and investors. 
The companies issuing debt securities in the bond markets, however, almost always refer to 
these securities as “notes” in their financial statements. You will see this distinction in the 
Real World Excerpts in this chapter. In the next chapter we will discuss money raised from 
shareholders through the issuance of stock in the equity markets.
For Amazon to maintain its position as an industry leader, it must reinvest large amounts 
of money in its business. Last year alone, the company spent almost $5 billion building new 
distribution centers and purchasing new software. Like most large companies, Amazon has

A company’s capital structure is the mixture of debt and equity it uses to finance 
its operations. Almost all companies employ some debt in their capital structure, 
with large companies often borrowing billions of dollars. Borrowing such a large 
amount from an individual bank is often impractical, so companies issue bond 
securities (bonds) to the investing public instead. Companies are not the only 
entities that go to the bond markets to raise capital; governments around the 
world also issue bonds for the same reason.
After bond securities have been issued, they are traded on established exchanges 
such as the New York Bond Exchange. The ability to sell a bond on the bond exchange 
is a significant advantage for investors because it provides them with liquidity, or 
the ability to convert their investments into cash. If you lend money directly to a 
corporation for 20 years, you must wait that long before your cash investment is 
repaid. In contrast, if you lend money by purchasing a bond in the bond markets, you 
can always sell it to another investor if you need cash before it matures.
The liquidity associated with being able to trade debt securities in the bond 
markets offers an important advantage to corporations. Most investors are reluc-
tant to lend money for long periods with no opportunity to receive cash prior to 


508

maturity. If they do so, they demand a higher interest rate to compensate for the illiquidity. 
By issuing more liquid debt that investors can easily buy and sell in the bond markets, compa-
nies are able to reduce the cost of long-term borrowing.
This chapter begins with a basic overview of the characteristics of bonds before moving on 
to discuss accounting for bonds from issuance to maturity. The chapter closes with a discus-
sion of the early retirement of bonds.

Why Issue Bonds?
Companies issue both stock and bonds to raise capital. Several reasons why a company might 
choose to issue bonds instead of stock include:
 
1. Stockholders maintain control. Issuing bonds allows shareholders to maintain their current 
level of control. Bondholders do not vote or share in any dividend payments made to shareholders.

2. Interest expense is tax deductible. Interest associated with bonds is tax deductible. The tax 
deductibility of interest reduces the net cost of borrowing. In contrast, dividends are not tax 
deductible.
 
3. Issuing bonds can increase the return to shareholders if a company can borrow at a low 
interest rate and invest in projects that earn a high rate of return. For example, assume that 
Drone Delivery, Inc., delivers critical medical supplies to search-and-rescue operations in 
remote locations. The company has shareholders’ equity of $100,000 invested in various 
types of drone equipment and earns net income of $20,000 per year. Management plans to 
purchase new drones that will cost $100,000 and are expected to earn an additional $20,000 
per year. To fund the purchase of the new drones, should management issue new stock or 
borrow the money at an interest rate of 8 percent? The following analysis shows that bor-
rowing the money will increase the return to the company’s shareholders:

The above example illustrates why a company might choose to issue bonds instead of stock. So 
what are the potential disadvantages to issuing bonds? Here are two:
 
1. Risk of bankruptcy. Interest payments to bondholders are fixed charges that must be paid 
each period whether the corporation earns income or incurs a loss.
 
2. Negative impact on cash flows. Bonds must be repaid at a specified time in the future. 
Management must be able to generate sufficient cash to repay the debt or have the ability to 
refinance it.
Bond Terminology
A bond usually requires the payment of interest over its life with repayment of principal on the 
maturity date. The bond principal is (1) the amount a company must pay to bondholders at the 
maturity date and (2) the amount used to compute the bond’s periodic cash interest payments. 
The bond principal is also called the face value, par value, or maturity value. All bonds have 
a face value. For most individual bonds, the face value is $1,000, but it can be any amount.
BOND PRINCIPAL (PAR 
VALUE, FACE VALUE, 
MATURITY VALUE)  
The amount a company pays 
bondholders on the maturity date 
and the amount used to compute 
the bond’s periodic cash interest 
payments.

A bond always specifies a coupon rate (also called the stated rate, contract rate, or nom-
inal rate) and the frequency of periodic cash interest payments. These interest payments are 
sometimes called coupon payments. A bond’s coupon rate is always stated in annual terms. This 
means that, if interest is paid annually, or once per year, the periodic cash interest payment is 
computed simply as the bond’s face value times its coupon rate. If the interest payment is made

more frequently, computing the cash interest payment requires that the coupon rate be converted 
to a rate per interest period before it is multiplied by the bond’s face value. For example, the fol-
lowing table reflects how a bond’s cash interest payment is calculated when interest is paid annu-
ally, semiannually, and quarterly. The face value of the bond is $1,000 and the coupon rate is 8%.
Frequency of Interest  
Payment
Interest Rate per  
Interest Period
Cash Payment per 
Interest Period
Annual (once per year)
8% × 1 = 8%
$1,000 × 8% = $80
Semiannual (twice per year)
8% × 1/2 = 4%
$1,000 × 4% = $40
Quarterly (four times per year)
8% × 1/4 = 2%
$1,000 × 2% = $20
As shown above, if the bond pays interest annually, bondholders will receive one interest pay-
ment of $80 during the year. If the bond pays interest semiannually, bondholders will receive a 
$40 interest payment every six months, for a total of $80 a year. If the bond pays interest quar-
terly, bondholders will receive a $20 interest payment every three months, for a total of $80 a 
year. Note that in all cases, $80 in interest is paid per year.
Different types of bonds have different characteristics for good economic reasons. Individ-
ual investors have different risk and return preferences. A retired person may be willing to 
receive a lower interest rate in return for greater security. This type of investor might want a 
mortgage bond that pledges a specific asset as security in case the company cannot repay the 
bond. Another type of creditor might be willing to accept a low interest rate and an unsecured 
status in return for the opportunity to convert the bond into common stock at some point in 
the future. These types of bonds are called convertible bonds. Companies try to design bond 
features that are attractive to different groups of investors just as automobile manufacturers try 
to design cars that appeal to different groups of consumers. Some common types of bonds (for 
example, debentures and callable bonds) are shown in the illustration below.

Bond Issuance Process
When Amazon decides to issue securities in the bond markets, it prepares a bond indenture 
and a bond prospectus. The indenture is a legal document that specifies all the details of the 
bond offering. The prospectus is a regulatory document that is filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. It also specifies all the details of the bond offering. These details include 
the maturity date, the rate of interest to be paid, the date of each interest payment, and other 
characteristics of the bonds, such as whether they are callable or convertible. The prospectus

also describes any covenants designed to protect the creditors. Typical covenants include limi-
tations on new debt that the company might issue in the future, limitations on the payment 
of dividends to shareholders, or requirements that the company maintain certain minimum 
accounting ratios, such as the current ratio or the debt-to-equity ratio. Because covenants may 
limit the company’s future actions, management prefers those that are least restrictive. Bond-
holders, however, prefer more restrictive covenants, which lessen the risk of the investment. As 
with any business transaction, the final result is achieved through negotiation.
Besides being described in the prospectus, bond covenants are also typically reported in the 
notes to the financial statements. Amazon recently issued debt securities on the bond markets that 
do not contain any covenants and informed potential investors of this in its prospectus by stating:
“The notes do not require us to maintain any financial ratios or specific levels of net worth, revenues, 
income, cash flow or liquidity and, accordingly, do not protect holders of the notes in the event that 
we experience significant adverse changes in our financial condition or results of operations.”

The prospectus also describes to potential investors how the proceeds from the bond issuance 
will be used. Amazon used the money for general corporate purposes, one of which included 
the purchase of land for its new headquarters in Seattle.
When a bond is issued to an investor, the person receives a bond certificate. All bond cer-
tificates for the same bond issuance, whether an actual paper certificate or an electronic certifi-
cate, contain the same information. The certificates show the same maturity date, coupon rate, 
interest dates, and other characteristics. An independent party, called the trustee, is usually 
appointed to represent the bondholders. A trustee’s duties are to ascertain whether the issuing 
company has fulfilled all provisions of the bond contract.

Bond Rating Agencies and Their Assessments of Default Risk
Because of the large amount of money involved and the complexities associated with bonds, several 
agencies exist to evaluate the risk that a bond issuer will not be able to meet the requirements specified 
in the prospectus. This risk is called default risk. Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch use letter rat-
ings to specify the quality of a bond. Higher-quality bonds have lower default risk, as shown in the table 
below. Many banks, mutual funds, and trusts are permitted to invest only in investment-grade bonds.

When Amazon issued its bonds, it specified two types of cash payments in the bond contract:
 
1. Principal. As noted in the previous section, this amount is usually a single payment that is 
made at the end of the bond’s life. It is also called the par value, face value, or maturity value.
 
2. Cash interest payments. These payments, which are sometimes referred to as coupon pay-
ments, represent an annuity and are computed by multiplying the bond’s face value times 
the coupon rate. The bond contract specifies whether the interest payments are made quar-
terly, semiannually, or annually. When you are asked to work problems in which interest 
payments are made more frequently than once a year, be sure and use the interest rate per 
period in your calculations. For example, consider a bond with the following characteristics:
  Face value: 
$1,000
  Term: 
10 years
  Coupon rate: 
6% (annual)
  Interest paid: 
Semiannually (twice a year)
 
If you are asked to compute the cash interest payment for this bond, you will need to use an 
interest rate per period of 3 percent (the semiannual coupon rate). The calculation is:
  Cash interest payment:   $30 ($1,000 × 6% × ½ year)
The issuing company does not determine the price at which the bonds sell. Instead, the market 
determines the price using the present value concepts introduced in the last chapter. To determine 
the present value of the bond, you compute the present value of the principal (a single payment) 
and the present value of the interest payments (an annuity) and add the two amounts together.
Investors demand a certain rate of return to compensate them for the risks related to a par-
ticular company’s bond offering. The demanded rate of return is called the market interest 
rate (also known as the yield or effective interest rate). Because the market rate is the interest 
rate investors demand on the day the bonds are issued, it is the rate that should be used in com-
puting the present value of a bond.
On the day a company issues a bond, the market interest rate will either be the same as 
the coupon rate, greater than the coupon rate, or less than the coupon rate. The relationship 
between the market interest rate and the bond’s coupon rate determines whether the bond 
is issued at par, at a premium, or at a discount. When the market interest rate equals the 
coupon rate, the bond sells at par; when the market interest rate is greater than the coupon 
 
rate, the bond sells at a discount; and when the market interest rate is less than the cou-
pon rate, the bond sells at a premium. This relationship can be shown graphically as follows:
Bond Contract
Par
Premium
Discount
Bond Price
Market Rate
Coupon rate
is 10%
Less than 10% 
Exactly 10% 
Greater than 10% 
In commonsense terms, when a bond’s coupon rate is less than the rate investors demand, 
investors will not buy the bond unless its price is reduced (i.e., a discount must be provided). 
When a bond’s coupon rate is more than investors demand, investors will be willing to pay a 
premium to buy the bond.
It is important to keep in mind that regardless of whether a bond is issued at par, at a dis-
count, or at a premium, investors will always earn the market rate of return. To illustrate, con-
sider a company that issues three separate bonds on the same day. The bonds are the same 
except that one has a coupon rate of 8 percent, another a rate of 10 percent, and a third a rate of 
12 percent. If the market rate of interest is 10 percent on the date all three bonds are issued, the

first bond will be issued at a discount, the second at par, and the third at a premium. As a result, 
an investor who purchases any one of the bonds will earn the market interest rate of 10 percent.
During the life of the bond, its market price will change as market interest rates change. 
While this information is reported in the financial press, it does not affect the company’s finan-
cial statements and the way its interest payments are accounted for from one period to the next. 
The interest rates that matter for accounting purposes are the bond’s coupon rate (which does 
not change over time) and the market interest rate on the day the bond is issued.
Bond Information from the Business Press
Bond prices are reported each day in the business press based on transactions that have occurred on the bond 
exchange. Though formats differ across news outlets, the following is typical of the information you will find:
Issuer

Current ($)
Yield (%)

The above reflects that the Amazon bond pays a coupon rate of 2.5 percent, will mature in the year 2022, 
and is currently selling for $94.92. The bond’s “yield” reflects that investors who purchase the bond at its 
current price and hold it to maturity will earn a return on their investment of 3.2 percent.
It is important to remember that the current price listed above does not affect Amazon’s financial 
statements—Amazon is not a part of the transaction when one investor decides to sell his or her bond 
to another investor. For financial reporting purposes, Amazon uses the market interest rate that existed 
when the bonds were first issued to the public.

In the next section of this chapter, we will see how to account for bonds issued at par, at a dis-
count, and at a premium.
1.  
The market interest rate is the interest rate demanded by investors for a bond at the time the bond is issued. It 
is the rate investors use in their present value computations to determine how much they will pay for the bond.
2. The market interest rate is also called a bond’s yield or its effective interest rate.
3.  
Coupon rate is a bond’s stated interest rate.
4. Coupon rate is also called the stated rate, contract rate, or nominal rate.
5.  
A bond that sells for less than its face value is sold at a discount. This occurs when the coupon rate is 
less than the market interest rate.
6.  
A bond that sells for more than its face value is sold at a premium. This occurs when the coupon rate is 
greater than the market interest rate.

Bonds sell at their face (par) value when the market interest rate that investors demand is equal 
to the interest rate stated in the bond contract, or the coupon rate. To illustrate, let’s assume that 
on January 1, 2016, Amazon issues bonds with a coupon rate of 10 percent and a face value of 
$100,000. On the date of issuance, investors are willing to pay Amazon $100,000 in cash (which 
means that the bonds are being sold at par). The bonds start accruing interest on January 1, 
2016, and will pay interest each June 30 and December 31. The bonds mature in two years on 
 
December 31, 2017.
The amount of money a company receives when it sells bonds is the present value of the 
future cash flows associated with the bonds. In issuing the bonds described above, Amazon 
agrees to make two types of payments in the future: a single payment of $100,000 when the 
bond matures in two years and an annuity of $5,000 [$100,000 × (10% × ½ year)] payable 
twice a year for two years. The 10% in the above equation is the bond’s coupon rate. The bond 
payments can be shown graphically as follows:
We use the bond’s market interest rate per period (in this case 10% ÷ 2 = 5%) to compute 
the bond’s present value. As we discussed in the previous chapter, the present value of the bond 
payments can be computed using Excel, a financial calculator, or the tables in Appendix E:

When the market rate of interest equals the coupon rate, the present value of the future cash 
flows associated with a bond always equals the bond’s face value amount. Remember a bond’s 
selling price is determined by the present value of its future cash flows, not the face value. On 
the date Amazon issues the bonds, it records a bond liability equal to the amount investors are 
willing to pay for the bonds:

Bonds may pay interest each month, each quarter, each half-year, or each year. In all cases, to 
determine the bond’s selling price, you would determine the present value of the bond’s cash flows 
using the number of interest periods in the bond’s life as well as the market interest rate per period.
From Table E.1: interest rate (i) = 5%, periods (n) = 4: Factor = 0.82270

Interest expense is reported on the income statement. Because interest is related to financing 
activities rather than operating activities, it is normally not included in operating expenses on 
the income statement. Instead, interest expense is typically reported just below “income from 
operations” on the income statement. A portion of the income statement for Amazon shows 
how interest expense is usually reported.

Bond interest payment dates rarely coincide with the last day of a company’s fiscal year. 
Under the expense recognition principle introduced in Chapter 3, interest expense that has 
been incurred but not paid must be accrued at the end of the accounting period. If Amazon’s 
fiscal year ended on May 31 instead of December 31, the company would accrue interest for 
five months and report that amount as interest expense on its income statement and the same 
amount as interest payable on its balance sheet.
Because interest payments are a legal obligation for the borrower, financial analysts want to 
be certain that a business is generating sufficient resources to meet its interest obligations. The 
times interest earned ratio is useful when making this assessment.

is 10%
Greater than 10%
Bonds sell at a discount when the market interest rate is greater than the coupon rate. To illus-
trate, let’s assume that the market interest rate is 12 percent on January 1, 2016, when Amazon 
sells its bonds (which have a face value of $100,000). The bonds mature in two years and have 
a coupon rate of 10 percent. Interest is payable twice a year on June 30 and December 31. 
Because the coupon rate (10 percent) is less than the market interest rate (12 percent) on the 
date of issuance, the bonds sell at a discount.
To compute what investors will be willing to pay for the bonds given the difference in inter-
est rates, we can use the tables in Appendix E. As in the previous example, the number of 
periods is four and the interest rate is the market interest rate per period; in this case 6 percent 
(12% × ½ year). With this information, we can compute the cash issue price of the Amazon 
bonds as follows:

INTERPRETATIONS
In General Analysts view a high times interest earned ratio more favorably than a low one. The ratio 
shows the amount of income earned for each dollar of interest expense. A high ratio indicates an extra 
margin of protection in case profitability deteriorates. Analysts are particularly interested in a company’s 
ability to meet its required interest payments because failure to do so could result in bankruptcy.
Focus Company Analysis In 2014, profit-making activities for Amazon generated only $0.65 for each 
dollar of interest. The ratio has declined over time for two reasons: Net income has decreased over time, 
while interest expense has increased. Given the sharp decline over time, analysts are likely keeping an eye on 
Amazon’s times interest earned ratio. eBay and Walmart both have higher ratios, indicating a safer margin 
of error with respect to their ability to pay interest with earnings generated during the period.
A Few Cautions The times interest earned ratio is often misleading for new or rapidly growing com-
panies, which tend to invest considerable resources to build their capacity for future operations. In such 
cases, the times interest earned ratio will reflect significant amounts of interest expense associated with 
borrowing to support expansion plans but not the future income that will likely come from expanding. For 
this reason, analysts should consider the company’s long-term strategy when interpreting this ratio.

From Table E.1: interest rate (i) = 6%, periods (n) = 4: Factor = 0.79209
From Table E.2: interest rate (i) = 6%, periods (n) = 4: Factor = 3.46511
Using Excel: rate (i) = .06, nper (n) = 4, pmt = −$5,000, FV = −$100,000
Using Calculator: rate (i) = 6, periods (n) = 4, pmt = −$5,000, FV = −$100,000
Thus, if the market interest rate is 12 percent on the date of issuance, investors will be willing 
to pay Amazon $96,535 for the bonds. Some people refer to this price as 96.5, which indicates 
the selling price was 96.5 percent of the bond’s face value (96.5 = $96,535 ÷ $100,000)
There are two acceptable methods for recording a bond that is sold at a discount; both result 
in the same dollar value being reported on a company’s balance sheet. The first method explic-
itly keeps track of the bond discount by incorporating it into the journal entries. The second 
method implicitly keeps track of the bond discount but does not incorporate it into the journal 
entries. Regardless of the method used, the dollar value reported on the balance sheet (the bond 
payable book value) is identical, as shown in the example below. Using both methods, the jour-
nal entries to record the sale of Amazon’s bonds issued at a discount are:

Bonds payable book value: $96,535
Bond discount is a contra-liability account, which is why it is debited in the journal entry 
above and shown as a negative number under liabilities. This account is not separately dis-
closed on Amazon’s balance sheet. Instead, the balance sheet reports the bonds payable at 
its book value ($96,535), which is the face value of the bonds less the unamortized discount 
($100,000 − $3,465). Note that reporting bonds payable at their book value results in the same 
amount being reported on the balance sheet ($96,535), regardless of whether a bond discount is 
explicitly recorded in the journal entry.
While Amazon received only $96,535 when it sold the bonds, it must repay $100,000 when 
the bonds mature. The $3,465 of additional cash that Amazon must pay at maturity is incre-
mentally reflected in interest expense and added to the book value of the liability each period 
over the life of the bond. This causes interest expense to reflect the market interest rate (also 
referred to as the effective interest rate), while the cash being paid to bondholders each period 
reflects the coupon rate. The accounting method used to record interest expense is referred to 
as the effective-interest amortization method.
Throughout the remainder of Chapter 10 we use the bond discount account in all jour-
nal entries. We duplicate the text and show all journal entries without the bond discount 
account in the Chapter Supplement at the end of the chapter.
Reporting Interest Expense on Bonds Issued at a Discount Using  
Effective-Interest Amortization (with Discount Account)
Under the effective-interest amortization method, a company computes interest expense in a 
given period by multiplying the bonds payable book value times the market rate of interest on

the date of issuance. When bonds are issued at a discount, using a market interest rate that is 
greater than the coupon rate results in interest expense each period being greater than the cash 
owed for interest each period. The difference between interest expense and the cash owed for 
interest is the amount of the bond discount amortized during the period. This process can be 
summarized as follows:
Step 1:  
Compute interest expense
 
        Bonds Payable Book Value × Market Interest Rate per Period
Step 3:
  Compute amortization amount
 
        Interest Expense - Cash Owed for Interest
Step 2:  
Compute cash owed for interest
 
       
 Bond Face Value × Coupon Rate per Period
Recall that the cash owed for interest is computed by multiplying the bond’s face value 
($100,000) by the coupon rate per period (10% × ½ year). Thus, Amazon owes bondholders 
cash of $5,000 each June 30 and again on December 31. The first interest payment on the bonds 
is made on June 30, 2016. Following the three steps outlined above, interest expense and the 
amount of the bond discount amortized are:
Step 1: Interest expense: $96,535 × (0.12 × ½ year) = $5,792
Step 2: Cash owed for interest: $100,000 × (0.10 × ½ year) = $5,000
Step 3: Amortized amount: $5,792 − $5,000 = $792
The journal entry Amazon would enter is:

-5,792
Each period, the amortization of the bond discount increases the bond’s book value, 
bringing it closer to the $100,000 that is due at maturity. The amortization of the bond 
discount can be thought of as the amount of interest earned by the bondholders in a given 
period that will be paid to them when the bonds mature. During the first interest period, 
Amazon’s bondholders earned interest of $5,792 but received only $5,000 in cash. The addi-
tional $792 was added to the book value of the bond and will be paid to bondholders when 
the bonds mature.
Interest expense for the next interest period must reflect the change in the bonds payable 
book value. Amazon calculates interest expense for the second half of 2016 by multiplying 
the bonds payable book value on June 30, 2016 ($97,327) by the market rate of interest per

period [$97,327 × (12% × ½ year) = $5,840]. With interest expense equal to $5,840 and cash 
owed for interest equal to $5,000, the amount of the bond discount amortized on December 
31, 2016, is $840:

Notice that interest expense for December 31, 2016, is more than interest expense for June 
30, 2016. Amazon effectively borrowed more money during the second half of the year 
because of the unpaid interest accrued during the first half of the year. Because of the amor-
tization of the bond discount, the book value of the bond and interest expense increase 
each year during the life of the bond. This process can be illustrated with the amortization 
 
schedule shown below:

Recall that bonds sell at a discount when the market interest rate is greater than the bond’s 
coupon rate. When the market interest rate is less than the bond’s coupon rate, the bonds sell at 
a premium. To demonstrate how to account for bonds issued at a premium, let’s use the same 
Amazon example as before but assume that the market interest rate is now 8 percent while the 
coupon rate remains the same, at 10 percent. Like before, the bonds are issued on January 1, 
2016; pay interest semiannually; and mature in two years.
The present value of the bonds described above can be computed from the tables contained 
in Appendix E using the factor for four periods and an interest rate of 4 percent per period 
 
(8% × ½ year):

Accounting for bonds issued at a premium is similar to accounting for bonds issued at a 
discount. Companies can explicitly use a bond premium account in their journal entries or 
implicitly keep track of the premium amount. We show both side-by-side below, and then, as 
we did with bond discounts, we present all subsequent journal entries using a bond premium 
account. We duplicate the text and show all journal entries without the bond premium 
account in the Chapter Supplement at the end of the chapter. The January 1, 2016, issuance

Like the bond discount account, the bond premium account is not separately disclosed on 
Amazon’s balance sheet. Instead, the balance sheet reports the bonds payable at their book 
value ($103,630), which is their face value plus the unamortized premium ($100,000 + 
$3,630). Note that reporting bonds payable at their book value results in the same amount being 
reported on the balance sheet ($103,630), regardless of whether a bond premium is explicitly 
recorded in the journal entry.
Reporting Interest Expense on Bonds Issued at a Premium Using  
Effective-Interest Amortization (with Premium Account)
As with the discount account, the recorded premium of $3,630 must be apportioned to each 
interest period so that interest expense reflects the market (effective) interest rate that Amazon 
is actually paying. To compute interest expense and the amount of the premium to be amortized 
each period, we follow the same three steps that we followed to compute these amounts when 
the bonds were issued at a discount:
Step 1:  
Compute interest expense
 
        Bonds Payable Book Value × Market Interest Rate per Period
Step 3:
  Compute amortization amount
 
        Interest Expense - Cash Owed for Interest
Step 2:  
Compute cash owed for interest
 
       
 Bond Face Value × Coupon Rate per Period
Step 1: Interest expense: $103,630 × (0.08 × ½ year) = $4,145
Step 2: Cash owed for interest: $100,000 × (0.10 × ½ year) = $5,000
Step 3: Amortized amount: $4,145 − $5,000 = −$855

The basic difference between effective-interest amortization of a bond discount and a bond 
premium is that the amortization of a discount increases the book value of the liability and the 
amortization of a premium decreases it. Both serve the same purpose: to bring the liability to 
the bond’s face value at the maturity date. The following schedule illustrates the amortization

So far, we have discussed bonds that pay interest over their life and have a principal payment due at the 
end of their life, which are the most common type of bond issued by companies to raise capital. For a 
number of reasons, companies may choose to issue bonds that have unique features. The concepts you 
have learned will help you understand these bonds. For example, a company might issue a bond that 
does not pay periodic cash interest. These bonds are typically called zero coupon bonds. Why would an 
investor buy a bond that did not pay interest? Our discussion of bond discounts has probably given you a 
good idea of the answer. The coupon interest rate on a bond can be virtually any amount (including zero) 
and investors will price the bond so that they earn the market rate of interest. A bond with a zero coupon 
interest rate is simply a deeply discounted bond that will sell for substantially less than its maturity value.
Let’s use the $100,000 Amazon bond to illustrate a zero coupon rate. Assume that the market interest 
rate is 10 percent and the bond does not make any cash interest payments to bondholders over its life. 
The bond matures in five years. The selling price of the bond is the present value of the maturity amount 
because no other cash payments will be made over the life of the bond. We can compute the present 
value with the tables contained in Appendix E, using the factor for five periods and an interest rate of 10 
percent:
Present Value
Single principal payment at maturity: $100,000 × 0.62092
$62,092
From Table E.1: interest rate (i) = 10%, periods (n) = 5: Factor = 0.62092
Using Excel: rate (i) = .10, nper (n) = 5, pmt = $0, FV = −$100,000
Using Calculator: rate (i) = 10, periods (n) = 5, pmt = $0, FV = −$100,000
Accounting for a zero coupon bond is no different than accounting for other bonds issued 
at a discount. However, the amount of the discount is much larger. For example, the bond dis-
count in the above example is $37,908. Over the five-year life of the bond, this amount will 
decrease until it is zero at the end of the bond’s life.
While zero coupon bonds do not pay cash interest, they have been priced to provide inves-
tors with a market rate of interest. Notice that the bonds payable book value in our example 
($62,092) is much lower than the maturity value ($100,000). This is because the price investors 
are willing to pay has been discounted such that when they receive the $100,000 at the end of 
the five years, they will have earned an interest rate of 10 percent, the market rate of interest on 
the issue date.

Accounting for Issuance Costs
For the sake of simplicity, the examples in this chapter assume that the company issuing bonds 
does not incur any issuance costs. This is not typically the case in the business world. When 
companies issue bonds, they almost always hire another company (or companies) to help them 
with the offering. These companies are called underwriters, and they charge a fee. Accounting 
for this fee is quite simple. The amount of the fee is deducted from the proceeds of the bond 
issuance. As a result, the fee increases the bond discount if the bonds were issued at a discount, 
and reduces the bond premium if the bonds were issued at a premium.
Reporting Interest Expense Using Straight-Line Amortization
GAAP requires that companies use the effective-interest method to amortize bond discounts 
and bond premiums. However, GAAP permits companies to use straight-line amortization 
when results do not materially differ from results computed using the effective-interest method. 
With straight-line amortization a company simply takes the total amount of the discount or

the premium at issuance, divides it by the number of periods in the bond’s life, and  
amortizes 
that amount each period. For example, the total amount of the premium in the Amazon 
example above was $3,630 and the bonds paid interest over four periods. Using straight-line 
 
amortization, Amazon would amortize $907.50 each period over the life of the bonds. The

INTERPRETATIONS
In General A high ratio indicates that a company relies heavily on debt financing relative to equity 
financing. Heavy reliance on debt financing increases the risk that a company may not be able to meet 
its contractual financial obligations (e.g., principal and interest payments) during a business downturn.
Focus Company Analysis The debt-to-equity ratio for Amazon has increased over the past few years, 
and in 2014, the ratio reflects that for each dollar of stockholders’ equity, Amazon has $4.1 of liabilities. 
Both eBay and Walmart have considerably lower amounts of liabilities relative to their stockholders’

Bonds are often issued for long periods, such as 20 or 30 years. As mentioned earlier, bond-
holders who need cash prior to the maturity date can simply sell their bond securities on a bond 
exchange to another investor. This transaction does not affect the books of the company that 
issued the bonds; it is a transaction between two investors. Some bonds have a call feature that 
allows the issuing company to call (retire) the bonds early. A call feature most often requires 
the issuing company to pay investors an amount greater than the bond’s face value to retire the 
bonds before their maturity date. The amount is often stated as a percentage of the bond’s face 
value and is described in the bond indenture or bond prospectus.
Assume that several years ago, Amazon issued callable bonds with a face value of 
$100,000. The bonds were issued at a premium, and the call feature allows Amazon to retire 
the bonds early by paying bondholders 102 percent of face value. If Amazon decides to call 
the bonds early, it will pay bondholders $102,000 cash and remove the bond liability from its 
balance sheet. Any difference between the cash paid to retire the bonds and the book value 
of the bond liability is recorded as a gain or loss on the income statement. For example, if 
the book value of Amazon’s bonds was $101,000 at the time the bonds were retired, Amazon 
would recognize a loss on early retirement of $1,000 on its income statement; Amazon had 
to pay bondholders $102,000 cash to remove a $101,000 liability from its balance sheet. The

In some cases, a company may elect to retire bonds early by purchasing them on the open 
market, just as an investor would. This approach is necessary when the bonds do not have a call 
feature. Even when the bonds have a call feature, retiring them by purchasing them on the open 
market is attractive when the cost of doing so is less than the cost of paying the call premium. 
What could cause the price of a bond to fall? The most common cause is a rise in interest rates. 
As you may have noticed during our discussion of present values, bond prices move in the 
opposite direction of interest rates. If interest rates go up, bond prices fall, and vice versa. If 
interest rates go up enough, a company may decide that it makes good economic sense to retire 
its bonds early by purchasing them on the open market.

A Few Cautions The debt-to-equity ratio tells only part of the story with respect to the risks associated 
with a company’s debt. It does not help the analyst understand whether the company’s operations can 
support its debt. As a result, most analysts would evaluate the debt-to-equity ratio within the context of 
the amount of cash the company can generate from operating activities.

CAS H  FLOW S
The cash a company receives when it issues bonds is reported as a cash inflow from financing activities 
on the statement of cash flows. The repayment of principal is reported as a cash outflow from financing 
activities. Many students are surprised to learn that the payment of interest is not reported as a financ-
ing activity on the statement of cash flows. Interest expense, as well as any gain or loss that results from 
retiring bonds early, is reported on the income statement and is a component of net income. As a result, 
GAAP requires that interest payments and any gain or loss from early retirement be reported as operating 
activities on the statement of cash flows.
EFFECT ON STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
In General Cash paid for interest is a component of net income and is considered a cost of doing 
business during each accounting period. It is therefore reported in the operating section of the cash flow 
statement. Cash received from issuing debt and cash paid for principal are financing activities and are 
therefore reported in the financing section of the cash flow statement, as shown in the following table:

(Try to answer the questions below before reading the suggested solution that follows.)
To raise funds to build a new plant, the managers of Zeus Company decide to issue bonds. The bond 
prospectus states the following:
Face value of the bonds: $100,000.
Date of issue: January 1, 2016; due in 10 years.
Coupon rate: 12 percent per year, payable semiannually on June 30 and December 31.
The bonds were sold on January 1, 2016, at 106 percent of face value. Assume the annual market 
rate of interest on the date of issue was 11 percent.
Required:
 
1. How much cash did Zeus Company receive from the sale of the bonds? Show computations.
 
2. Were the bonds issued at a discount or a premium? What was the amount of the discount or premium?
 
3. How much cash does Zeus owe bondholders for interest on June 30, 2016?
 
4. Assume Zeus uses the effective-interest amortization method. What amount of interest expense 
will Zeus recognize on June 30, 2016?
SUGGESTED SOLUTION
 
1. Sale price of the bonds: $100,000 × 1.06 = $106,000.
 
2. The bonds were issued at a premium. The amount of the premium is $6,000 ($106,000 − $100,000).
 
3. Cash paid for interest on June 30, 2016: $100,000 × (12% × ½ year) = $6,000.
 
4. Interest expense recognized on June 30, 2016: $106,000 × (11% × ½ year) = $5,830.

CHAPTER SUPPLEMENT
Accounting for Bonds without a Discount Account or Premium Account
In this chapter supplement we duplicate the text from Chapter 10 but show all journal entries without the 
bond discount or bond premium accounts.
Reporting Interest Expense on Bonds Issued at a Discount Using  
Effective-Interest Amortization (without Discount Account)
Under the effective-interest amortization method, a company computes interest expense in a given period 
by multiplying the bonds payable book value times the market rate of interest on the date of issuance. 
When bonds are issued at a discount, using a market interest rate that is greater than the coupon rate 
results in interest expense each period being greater than the cash owed for interest each period. The 
difference between interest expense and the cash owed for interest is the amount of the bond discount 
amortized during the period. This process can be summarized as follows:
Step 1: Compute interest expense
 
        Bonds Payable Book Value × Market Interest Rate per Period
Step 3: Compute amortization amount
 
        Interest Expense - Cash Owed for Interest
Step 2: Compute cash owed for interest
 
        Bond Face Value × Coupon Rate per Period
LEARNING OBJECTIVE 10-4
Report bonds payable and 
interest expense for bond 
securities issued at a discount.

C HAP TER  1 0  Reporting and Interpreting Bond Securities
Recall that the cash owed for interest is computed by multiplying the bond’s face value ($100,000) 
by the coupon rate per period (10% × ½ year). Thus, Amazon owes bondholders cash of $5,000 
each June 30 and again on December 31. The first interest payment on the bonds is made on June 30, 
2016. Following the three steps outlined above, interest expense and the amount of the bond discount 
amortized are:
Step 1: Interest expense: $96,535 × (0.12 × ½ year) = $5,792
Step 2: Cash owed for interest: $100,000 × (0.10 × ½ year) = $5,000
Step 3: Amortized amount: $5,792 − $5,000 = $792

Each period, the amortization of the bond discount increases the bond’s book value, bringing it closer 
to the $100,000 that is due at maturity. The amortization of the bond discount can be thought of as the 
amount of interest earned by the bondholders in a given period that will be paid to them when the bonds 
mature. During the first interest period, Amazon’s bondholders earned interest of $5,792 but received 
only $5,000 in cash. The additional $792 was added to the book value of the bond and will be paid to 
bondholders when the bonds mature.
Interest expense for the next interest period must reflect the change in the bonds payable book value. 
Amazon calculates interest expense for the second half of 2016 by multiplying the bonds payable book 
value on June 30, 2016 ($97,327) by the market rate of interest per period ($97,327 × (12% × ½ year) = 
$5,840). With interest expense equal to $5,840 and cash owed for interest equal to $5,000, the amount of 
the bond discount amortized on December 31, 2016, is $840:

Amazon effectively borrowed more money during the second half of the year because of the unpaid inter-
est accrued during the first half of the year. Because of the amortization of the bond discount, the book 
value of the bond and interest expense increase each year during the life of the bond. This process can be 
illustrated with the amortization schedule shown below:

Note that:

 Cash owed for interest (column a) is computed by multiplying the bond’s face value by the coupon 
rate per period.

 Interest expense (column b) is computed by multiplying the book value of the bonds at the beginning 
of the period (column d) by the market interest rate. Note that the book value of a bond at the begin-
ning of a period is the book value of the bond at the end of the previous period.

from interest expense (column b).

 The new book value of the bonds (column d) is computed by adding amortization of the bond dis-
count (column c) to the book value at the beginning of the period.

Bonds Issued at a Premium
Recall that bonds sell at a discount when the market interest rate is greater than the bond’s coupon rate. 
When the market interest rate is less than the bond’s coupon rate, the bonds sell at a premium. To dem-
onstrate how to account for bonds issued at a premium, let’s use the same Amazon example as before 
but assume that the market interest rate is now 8 percent while the coupon rate remains the same, at 
10 percent. Like before, the bonds are issued on January 1, 2016, pay interest semiannually, and mature 
in two years.
The present value of the bonds described above can be computed from the tables contained in Appen-
dix E using the factor for four periods and an interest rate of 4 percent per period (8% × ½ year):
Present Value
Single principal payment at maturity: $100,000 × 0.85480

From Table E.1: interest rate (i) = 4%, periods (n) = 4: Factor = 0.85480
From Table E.2: interest rate (i) = 4%, periods (n) = 4: Factor = 3.62990
Using Excel: rate (i) = .04, nper (n) = 4, pmt = −$5,000, FV = −$100,000
Using Calculator: rate (i) = 4, periods (n) = 4, pmt = −$5,000, FV = −$100,000
Accounting for bonds issued at a premium is similar to accounting for bonds issued at a discount. 
Companies can explicitly use a bond premium account in their journal entries or implicitly keep track of 
the premium amount. We show both side-by-side below and then, as we did in our discussion of bond dis-
counts, we present all subsequent journal entries without using a bond premium account. The January 1,

Like the bond discount account, the bond premium account is not separately disclosed on Amazon’s 
balance sheet. Instead, the balance sheet reports the bonds payable at their book value ($103,630), which 
is their face value plus the unamortized premium ($100,000 + $3,630). Note that reporting bonds pay-
able at its book value results in the same amount being reported on the balance sheet ($103,630), regard-
less of whether a bond premium is explicitly recorded in the journal entry.
Reporting Interest Expense on Bonds Issued at a Premium Using  
Effective-Interest Amortization (without Premium Account)
As with a discount, the recorded premium of $3,630 must be apportioned to each interest period so 
that interest expense reflects the market (effective) interest rate that Amazon is actually paying. To 
compute interest expense and the amount of the premium we will amortize each period, we follow 
the same three steps that we followed to compute these amounts when the bonds were issued at a 
discount:

Compute interest expense

Step 2:  
Compute cash owed for interest
 
       
 Bond Face Value × Coupon Rate per Period
Step 1: Interest expense: $103,630 × (0.08 × ½ year) = $4,145
Step 2: Cash owed for interest: $100,000 × (0.10 × ½ year) = $5,000
Step 3: Amortized amount: $4,145 − $5,000 = −$855

The basic difference between effective-interest amortization of a bond discount and a bond pre-
mium is that the amortization of a discount increases the book value of the liability and the amortiza-
tion of a premium decreases it. Both serve the same purpose: to bring the liability to the bond’s face 
value at the maturity date. The following schedule illustrates the amortization of a premium over the 
life of a bond.

10-1. Describe the characteristics of bond securities. p. 508
Bond securities are commonly referred to as just “bonds.” Bonds have a number of characteristics 
designed to meet the needs of both the issuing company and the bondholder. We discussed many 
of those characteristics in this chapter.
Companies issue bonds to raise long-term capital. Bonds offer a number of advantages com-
pared to stock, including the tax deductibility of interest and the fact that control of the company 
is not diluted when a company issues bonds instead of stock. Bonds do carry additional risk, how-
ever, because interest and principal payments are not discretionary.
 
10-2. Report bonds payable and interest expense for bond securities issued at par. p. 514
Three types of events must be recorded over the life of a typical bond: (1) the receipt of cash when 
the bond is sold, (2) the periodic payment of interest, and (3) the repayment of the bond’s face 
value at maturity. The amount of cash a company receives when it issues bonds is the present value 
of the future cash flows associated with the bonds. When the market interest rate and the coupon 
rate are the same, the bond will sell at par (face value).
 
10-3. Compute and analyze the times interest earned ratio. p. 516
The times interest earned ratio reflects the amount of income earned for each dollar of interest 
expense. It is a measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest obligations. It is computed 
by comparing interest expense to net income after adding back interest expense and income tax 
expense.
 
10-4. Report bonds payable and interest expense for bond securities issued at a discount. pp. 517 
& 529
Bonds are sold at a discount whenever the coupon rate is less than the market interest rate. A 
discount is the difference between the selling price of a bond and the bond’s face value when the 
bond is sold for less than its face amount. Companies have the option of explicitly keeping track 
of the bond discount by incorporating it into journal entries or implicitly keeping track of the bond 
discount and not including it in journal entries. Regardless, the same amount is reported as bonds 
payable on a company’s balance sheet.
 
10-5. Report bonds payable and interest expense for bond securities issued at a premium. 
 
pp. 521 & 532
Bonds are sold at a premium whenever the coupon rate is greater than the market interest rate. A 
premium is the difference between the selling price of a bond and the bond’s face value when the 
bond is sold for more than its face value. Companies have the option of explicitly keeping track of 
the bond premium by incorporating it into journal entries or implicitly keeping track of the bond 
premium and not including it in journal entries. Regardless, the same amount is reported as bonds 
payable on a company’s balance sheet.
 
10-6. Compute and analyze the debt-to-equity ratio. p. 526
The debt-to-equity ratio compares the amount of debt to the amount of equity on a company’s 
balance sheet. It is an important ratio because of the high risk associated with debt capital; debt 
capital requires interest and principal payments.
 
10-7. Report the early retirement of bond securities. p. 527
A company may retire bonds before their maturity date, by either purchasing the bonds in the open 
market or activating a call feature if the bonds contain such a feature. The difference between the 
book value of the bonds and the amount paid to retire the bonds is reported as a gain or loss on the 
company’s income statement.
 
10-8. Explain how bond securities are reported on the statement of cash flows. p. 528
Cash received from issuing bonds and cash paid to retire bonds at maturity are financing cash 
flows. Cash paid for interest and any gain or loss on the early retirement of bonds are operating 
cash flows.

Times interest earned ratio reflects the amount of income earned for each dollar of interest expense. 
It is a measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest obligations. The ratio is computed as follows 
(see the “Key Ratio Analysis” box in the Reporting Bond Transactions section):
Debt-to-equity ratio compares the amount of debt on a company’s balance sheet to the amount of 
equity. The ratio is computed as follows (see the “Key Ratio Analysis” box in the Reporting Bond 
Transactions section):
K E Y  R A T I O S
Times Interest Earned = Net Income + Interest Expense + Income Tax Expense
Interest Expense
Debt-to-Equity =
Total Liabilities
Stockholders’ Equity
Balance Sheet
Bonds are normally listed as long-term liabili-
ties. An exception occurs when the bonds are 
within one year of maturity, in which case they 
are reported as current liabilities with the title 
“Current Portion of Long-Term Debt.”
Income Statement
Issuing bonds and paying off bonds at maturity 
do not affect the income statement. Recogniz-
ing interest expense and any gain or loss from 
early retirement does affect the income state-
ment. Most companies report interest expense 
in a separate category on the income statement.

Notes
Under Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies
A brief description of how a company accounts 
for long-term liabilities, including bonds.
Under a Separate Note
Most companies include a separate note where 
they describe in more detail their accounting 
for long-term debt, including the type of debt, 
maturity dates, and interest rates. The note also 
typically describes any special features associ-
ated with the debt, such as whether bonds can be 
called early. Typically in a company’s financial 
statements and footnotes, bonds are referred to 
as “notes.”

Explaining Why Debt Is Issued at a Price Other Than Par
The annual report of American Airlines contained the following note:
The Company recorded the issuance of $775 million in bonds (net of $25 million discount) as 
long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. The bonds bear interest at fixed rates, with 
an average effective rate of 8.06 percent, and mature over various periods of time, with a final 
maturity in 2031.

Analyzing Zero Coupon Bonds from an Actual Company
French energy giant GDF Suez recently issued a zero coupon bond. This bond issuance garnered atten-
tion because it was the first time in 14 years that a zero coupon bond had been issued in euros. The zero 
coupon bond has a face value of €500 million and matures in two years. Assume that when the bonds 
were sold to the public, the annual market rate of interest was 3 percent.
Required:
 1. Explain why an investor would buy a bond with a zero coupon (interest) rate.
 2. If investors could earn 3 percent on similar investments, how much did GDF Suez receive when it 
issued the bonds with a face value of €500 million?
 3. How much would GDF Suez have received if the annual market rate of interest remained at 3  
percent, 
but the bonds did not mature for 10 years?

Critical Thinking Cases
Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma 
You work for a small company that is considering investing in a new Internet business. Financial projec-
tions suggest that the company will be able to earn in excess of $40 million per year on an investment of 
$100 million. The company president suggests borrowing the money by issuing bonds that will carry a 
7 percent interest rate. He says, “This is better than printing money! We won’t have to invest a penny of 
our own money, and we get to keep $33 million per year after we pay interest to the bondholders.” As 
you think about the proposed transaction, you feel a little uncomfortable about taking advantage of the 
creditors in this fashion. You feel that it must be wrong to earn such a high return by using money that 
belongs to other people. Is this an ethical business transaction?
Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma 
Assume that you are a portfolio manager for a large insurance company. The majority of the money you 
manage is from retired school teachers who depend on the income you earn on their investments. You 
have invested a significant amount of money in the bonds of a large corporation and have just received 
a call from the company’s president explaining that it is unable to meet its current interest obligations 
because of deteriorating business operations related to increased international competition. The presi-
dent has a recovery plan that will take at least two years. During that time, the company will not be able 
to pay interest on the bonds and, she admits, if the plan does not work, bondholders will probably lose 
more than half of their money. As a creditor, you can force the company into immediate bankruptcy and 
probably get back at least 90 percent of the bondholders’ money. You also know that your decision will 
cause at least 10,000 people to lose their jobs if the company ceases operations. Given only these two 
options, what should you do?
Financial Reporting and Analysis Team Project
Team Project: Examining an Annual Report 
As a team, select an industry to analyze. Both Yahoo Finance and Google Finance provide informa-
tion on any given firm’s industry. Each team member should acquire the annual report or 10-K for one 
publicly traded company in the industry, with each member selecting a different company. The annual 
reports or 10-Ks can be downloaded from the SEC EDGAR website (www.sec.gov) or from any indi-
vidual company’s investor relations website.
Required:
Each team member should individually gather the information described below and attempt to answer 
each question. After completing this individual phase of the project, teams should get together to com-
pare and contrast their answers to each question. At the conclusion of this discussion, each team should 
write a short report summarizing their analysis and findings.
 1. Has your company issued any long-term debt, either bonds or notes? If so, read the footnote and list 
any unusual features (e.g., callable, convertible, secured by specific collateral, etc.).
 2. If your company issued any bond securities (which may be referred to as “notes” in the footnotes), 
were they issued at par, a premium, or a discount? If they were issued at a premium or discount, does 
the company use the straight-line or effective-interest amortization method?
 3. Ratio analysis:
 
a. What does the debt-to-equity ratio measure in general?
 
b. Compute the ratio for your company for the last three years.
 
c. What do your results suggest about the company?
 
d. If available, find the industry ratio for the most recent year, compare it to your results, and discuss 
why you believe your company differs from or is similar to the industry ratio.
 4. Ratio analysis:
 
a. What does the times interest earned ratio measure in general?
 
b. Compute the ratio for your company for the last three years. If interest expense is not separately dis-
closed, you will not be able to compute the ratio. If so, state why you think it is not separately disclosed.

States. The popular supermarket was incorporated in 1978 and completed its ini-
tial public offering in 1992. Whole Foods has over 400 stores in the United States, 
Canada, and the United Kingdom. In an average week, over 7.7 million customers visit a 
Whole Foods store. In fiscal 2014, Whole Foods reported revenues of $14.2 billion and net 
income of $579 million. Whole Foods’s growth strategy is to expand primarily through new 
store openings. In support of this growth plan, the company spent over $700 million in 2014 
on capital expenditures.
In this chapter, we study the role that stockholders’ equity plays in funding a business and 
the strategies that managers use to maximize stockholders’ wealth.

To some people, the words corporation and business are almost synonymous. You’ve prob-
ably heard friends refer to a career in business as “the corporate world.” Equating busi-
ness with corporations is understandable because corporations are the dominant form of 


chapter 11
business organization in terms of volume of operations. If you were to write the 
names of 10 familiar businesses on a piece of paper, probably all of them would 
 
be corporations.
The popularity of the corporate form can be attributed to a critical advan-
tage that corporations have over sole proprietorships and partnerships: They 
can raise large amounts of capital because both large and small investors can 
easily participate in their ownership. This ease of participation is related to 
 
several factors.

Many Americans own stock either directly or indirectly through a mutual fund 
or pension program. Stock ownership offers them the opportunity to earn higher 
returns than they could depositing money in a bank account or investing in cor-
porate bonds. Unfortunately, stock ownership also involves risks. The proper 
balance between risk and the expected return on an investment depends on indi-
vidual preferences.

WHOLE FOODS
Notice that the stockholders’ equity section of Whole Foods’s balance sheet lists two pri-
mary sources of equity:
 
1. Contributed capital from the sale of stock. This is the amount of money stockholders 
invested through the purchase of shares. For Whole Foods, contributed capital is the 
amount in the Common Stock account ($2,863 million for fiscal 2014).
 
2. Earned capital generated by the company’s profit-making activities. Earned capital is 
kept track of in the Retained Earnings account (sometimes called Accumulated Earnings 
account). Retained earnings is the cumulative amount of net income the corporation has 
earned since it organized as a corporation, less the cumulative amount of dividends paid 
since it organized.

The corporation is the only business form the law recognizes as a separate entity. As a distinct 
entity, the corporation enjoys a continuous existence separate and apart from its owners. It may 
own assets, incur liabilities, expand and contract in size, sue others, be sued, and enter into 
contracts independently of its stockholder owners.
To protect everyone’s rights, the creation and governance of corporations are tightly regu-
lated by law. Corporations are created by application to a state government (not the federal 
government). On approval of the application, the state issues a charter, sometimes called the 
articles of incorporation. Corporations are governed by a board of directors elected by the 
stockholders.
Each state has different laws governing the organization of corporations created within its 
boundaries. Whole Foods incorporated in the state of Texas and has its headquarters in  
Austin, 
Texas. You will find that an unusually large number of corporations are incorporated in Dela-
ware even though their headquarters are located in a different state. Companies choose Dela-
ware for incorporation because the state has some of the most favorable laws, especially with 
regard to taxes, for establishing corporations.

When you invest in a corporation, you are known as a stockholder or shareholder. As a 
stockholder, you receive shares of stock that you subsequently can sell on established stock 
exchanges. Owners of common stock receive a number of benefits:

 A voice in management. You may vote in the stockholders’ meeting on major issues 
 
concerning management of the corporation.

 Dividends. If a company pays dividends, you receive a proportional share of the distribution 
of profits.

 Residual claim. You will receive a proportional share of the distribution of remaining assets 
upon the liquidation of the company.
Stockholders, unlike creditors, are able to vote at the annual stockholders’ meeting. Each 
share of stock represents one vote. The following notice of the annual meeting of shareholders

The corporate charter specifies the maximum number of shares the corporation is authorized to 
sell to the public. The financial statements report this number, as well as the number of shares 
that have been sold to date. Let’s look at the share information reported by Whole Foods as of 
September 28, 2014, shown in Exhibit 11.1. For Whole Foods, the maximum number of com-
mon shares that can be sold, called the authorized number of shares, is 600,000,000. As of 
September 28, 2014, the company had sold 377,100,000 common shares. Shares that have been 
sold to the public are called issued shares.
For a number of reasons, a company might want to buy back shares that have already been 
sold to the public. Shares that have been bought back are called treasury stock. Shares held as 
treasury stock are considered issued shares but not outstanding shares. Thus, when a company 
buys back shares, it creates a difference between the number of issued shares and the number 
of outstanding shares of its stock. As of September 28, 2014, Whole Foods had 360,400,000 
shares outstanding and 16,700,000 shares being held as treasury stock. The relationship 
between Whole Foods’s issued, outstanding, and treasury shares is shown below:

All corporations issue common stock, and some elect to issue a second type of stock called 
preferred stock. In this section, we discuss common stock. Near the end of the chapter, we will 
discuss preferred stock.
Common stock is held by investors who are the “owners” of a corporation. Though stock-
holders are owners and have the right to vote and share in the profitability of the business 
through dividends, they do not actively participate in managing the business. Instead, they 
elect a board of directors and it is the board’s role to hire and monitor executives who manage 
a company’s activities on a day-to-day basis.

INTERPRETATIONS
In General You have probably seen newspaper headlines announcing a company’s earnings. Notice that 
those news stories normally report earnings on an earnings per share (EPS) basis. EPS is a popular measure 
because it emphasizes the amount of earnings attributable to a single share of outstanding common stock. 
Since the number of outstanding shares of common stock changes over time, and is different across firms, 
using EPS rather than just net income allows analysts and investors to make “apples-to-apples” compari-
sons across time and across firms. Companies are required to report EPS on their income statements.
Focus Company Analysis For Whole Foods, the weighted average number of common shares out-
standing has stayed relatively constant over the last three years, while net income has increased. This has 
caused the company’s EPS to increase over the three years. Whole Foods also has a higher EPS than The 
Fresh Market, a much smaller competitor with annual sales of $1.8 billion, and Safeway, a much larger 
competitor with annual sales of $36 billion. We can compare EPS numbers across firms of different sizes 
because EPS captures the amount of earnings attributable to a single share of outstanding common stock, 
regardless of the size of a company or the number of shares of stock outstanding.
A Few Cautions While EPS is an effective and widely used measure of profitability, it does not neces-
sarily indicate how a company will perform in the future. Stock price is a better indication of expected 
future performance. For example, if two companies have identical EPS numbers, but the stock price of 
one company is double that of the other company, investors expect greater future performance from the 
firm with the higher stock price. EPS is a measure of performance over a prior period, while stock price 
is an indication of performance over future periods. It is important to keep this in mind when analyzing 
EPS numbers across time and across firms.

C HAP TER  1 1  Reporting and Interpreting Stockholders’ Equity
Depending on state law, a company’s common stock may be required to have a par value, 
a nominal value per share established in the corporate charter. Par value has no relationship to 
the market value of a stock. For example, The Fresh Market’s common stock has a par value 
of $0.01 per share while its stock price is over $40 per share. Whole Foods’s common stock 
does not have a par value.
Most states require stock to have a par value. The original purpose of this requirement was to 
protect creditors by specifying a permanent amount of capital that owners could not withdraw 
before a bankruptcy, which would leave creditors with something in the event that a company 
did not succeed. This permanent amount of capital is called legal capital. Though the require-
ment to assign a par value and maintain legal capital is embedded in state law, in today’s busi-
ness world it does little to protect creditors. Companies have simply transitioned to assigning 
an extremely low par value, like $0.01 per share, which means that any legal capital require-
ments are too low to meaningfully protect creditors. As a result, creditors have adopted other 
protection mechanisms, like the debt covenants we discussed in Chapter 10, to provide some 
protection in the event that a company performs poorly.
There are some states that require the issuance of no-par value stock. When a corporation 
issues no-par stock, like Whole Foods, legal capital is as defined by state law.
Initial Sale of Stock
An initial public offering, or IPO, involves the very first sale of a company’s stock to the public 
(i.e., when the company first “goes public”). You have probably heard stories of a new company’s 
stock price increasing dramatically the day of its IPO. While investors sometimes earn significant 
returns on IPOs, they also take significant risks. Once a company’s stock has been traded on 
established markets, additional sales of new stock to the public are called seasoned offerings.
Most sales of stock to the public are cash transactions. To illustrate the accounting for an 
initial sale of stock, assume that Trader Joe’s sold 100,000 shares of its $1 par value stock for 
$20 per share. The company would record the following journal entry:
PAR VALUE 
(1) The nominal value per share 
of stock as specified in the 
corporate charter. (2) Also, 
another name for bond principal, 
or the maturity amount of a bond.
LEGAL CAPITAL 
The permanent amount of capital 
defined by state law that must 
remain invested in the business; 
serves as a cushion for creditors.
NO-PAR VALUE STOCK 
Capital stock that has no par 
value as specified in the corporate 
charter.

Notice that the Common Stock account is credited for the number of shares sold times the par 
value per share. The Additional Paid-in Capital account is credited for the remainder, which 
is the amount “in addition” to par value that the company received when it issued the shares. 
In rare cases, a corporate charter may specify a “stated value” rather than a “par value.” For 
accounting purposes, the two values are used in the same way. If there is no par or stated value, 
the entire proceeds from the sale will be entered in the Common Stock account.
Sale of Stock in Secondary Markets
When a company sells stock to the public, the transaction is between the issuing corporation 
and the investor. Subsequent to the initial sale, investors can sell shares to other investors with-
out directly affecting the corporation. For example, if investor Ed DeHaan sold 1,000 shares of 
Whole Foods stock to investor Amanda Winn, Whole Foods would not record a journal entry. 
Mr. DeHaan received cash for the shares he sold, and Ms. Winn received stock for the cash she 
paid. Whole Foods was not a part of the transaction and therefore did not receive or pay anything.
Each business day, The Wall Street Journal reports the results of thousands of trans-
actions between investors in secondary markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange 
(NYSE) and the NASDAQ market. Managers of corporations monitor the price move-
ments of their companies’ stock. Stockholders expect to earn money on their invest-
ments through both dividends and increases in the stock price. In many instances, senior

management has been replaced because of a stock’s poor performance in 
the stock market.
Stock Issued for Employee Compensation
One of the advantages of the corporate form is the ability to separate the 
management of a business from its ownership. Separation can also be a dis-
advantage because some managers may not act in the owners’ best interests. 
This potential problem can be addressed in a number of ways. For example, 
compensation packages can be developed to reward managers for meeting 
goals that are important to stockholders. Another strategy is to offer manag-
ers stock options, which permit them to buy stock at a fixed price.
The holder of a stock option has an interest in a company’s performance 
just as an owner does. Stock option plans are a common form of compensa-
tion. Whole Foods offers employees stock options as part of their compensa-
tion. The options specify that shares may be bought at the then-current market 
price. Granting a stock option is a form of compensation, even if the grant price and the current 
stock price are the same. You can think of a stock option as a risk-free investment. If you hold a 
stock option and the stock price declines, you have lost nothing. If the stock price increases, you 
can exercise your option at the low grant price and sell the stock at the higher price for a profit.
Companies must estimate and report compensation expense associated with stock options. How 
managers make these estimates are discussed in more detail in intermediate accounting courses.
Repurchase of Stock
A corporation may want to repurchase its stock from existing stockholders for a number of rea-
sons. One common reason is the existence of an employee bonus plan that provides workers with 
shares of the company’s stock as part of their compensation. Because of Securities and Exchange 
Commission regulations concerning newly issued shares, most companies find it less costly to 
give employees repurchased shares than to issue new ones. In addition, if a company were to pay 
bonuses with newly issued shares each period, it would increase the number of shares in the mar-
ket, which would decrease the company’s stock price. Increasing the number of shares would also 
dilute existing stockholders’ investments, as each share of stock they own would be worth less. 
By repurchasing shares to fulfill bonus obligations, companies avoid this dilution effect. Stock 
that has been repurchased and is held by the issuing corporation is called treasury stock. Treasury 
shares have no voting, dividend, or other stockholder rights while they are held as treasury stock.
When companies repurchase shares from the market, they pay cash and receive their own 
stock. Assume that Trader Joe’s repurchased 100,000 shares of its stock in the open market 
when it was selling for $20 per share. To reflect the repurchase, the company would record the 
following journal entry:

Intuitively, many students expect the Treasury Stock account to be reported as an asset. Such 
is not the case because a company cannot own itself. The Treasury Stock account is actually 
a contra-equity account, which is why in Exhibit 11.1 Whole Foods shows Common Stock in 
Treasury as a negative number on its balance sheet. This practice makes sense because treasury 
stock is considered issued but not outstanding. Thus, when stock is repurchased and held in 
treasury it is not removed from the Common Stock account but rather is shown as its own sepa-
rate account within stockholders’ equity, and because repurchasing the shares reduced assets 
(cash), it reduces equity. As the information in Exhibit 11.1 indicates, Whole Foods reported 
treasury stock in the amount of $711 (million) on its balance sheet as of September 28, 2014.

When a company sells its treasury stock, it does not report an accounting profit or loss on 
the transaction, even if it sells the stock for more or less than it originally cost to repurchase 
the shares. GAAP does not permit a corporation to report income or losses from investments 
in its own stock because transactions with the owners are not considered normal profit-making 
activities. Based on the previous example, assume that Trader Joe’s resells 10,000 shares of 
treasury stock for $30 per share. Remember that the company had repurchased the stock for 
$20 per share. Trader Joe’s would record the following journal entry when it resells the shares:

Investors buy common stock because they expect a return on their investment. This return can 
come in two forms: stock price appreciation and dividends. Some investors prefer to buy stocks 
that pay little or no dividends because companies that reinvest the majority of their earnings 
tend to increase their future earnings potential, along with their stock price. Wealthy investors 
in high tax brackets prefer to receive their return in the form of higher stock prices because 
capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate than dividend income. Other investors, such as retired 
people who need a steady income, prefer to receive their return in the form of dividends. These 
people often seek stocks that will pay relatively high dividends, such as utility stocks. Because 
of the importance of dividends to many investors, analysts often compute the dividend yield 
ratio to evaluate a corporation’s dividend policy.

RATIO AND COMPARISONS
The dividend yield ratio is computed as follows:
Dividend Yield = Dividends per Share ÷ Market Price per Share
The 2014 ratio for Whole Foods: $0.48 ÷ $37.67 = 1.3% 

INTERPRETATIONS
In General Investors in common stock can earn a return from both dividends and capital apprecia-
tion (increases in the market price of the stock). The dividend yield ratio reflects the return on invest-
ment absent any capital appreciation or, said differently, the return attributed solely to the dividends a 
 
company pays.
Focus Company Analysis Whole Foods’s stock price at the end of fiscal 2014 was $37.67. If you had 
invested this amount in Whole Foods and received the dividends that Whole Foods paid out during 2014, 
your return on investment would have been 1.3 percent. Whole Foods paid a relatively large dividend 
per share in 2013, which is reflected in its dividend yield ratio being considerably higher in that year. 
Safeway’s stock price per share at the end of fiscal 2014 was similar to that of Whole Foods ($35.13 vs. 
$37.67). Safeway, however, paid a higher dividend per share ($0.89 vs. $0.48), resulting in a higher divi-
dend yield ratio. The Fresh Market has not paid a dividend since 2011, instead choosing to reinvest all 
earnings in the company to fuel growth. As a result, the company’s dividend yield ratio is zero.
A Few Cautions Remember that the dividend yield ratio tells only part of the return on investment 
story; it does not reflect capital appreciation as reflected in the increase in a company’s stock price over 
time. Often potential capital appreciation is a much more important consideration. Whole Foods cur-
rently reinvests most of its earnings to fuel growth rather than paying out those earnings in the form of 
dividends. Whole Foods reported earnings in 2014 of $579 million but paid only $170 million to inves-
tors as dividends. Analysts should consider a company’s dividend yield ratio in conjunction with other 
return measures when assessing a company’s performance.

Key Dividend Dates
The declaration and payment of a dividend involve several key dates. Let’s review these dates 
based on information reported in Whole Foods’s 2014 Annual Report.
This excerpt contains three important dates:
 
1. Declaration date. The declaration date is the date on which the board of directors offi-
cially approves the dividend. As soon as the board declares a dividend, a liability is created 
and must be recorded.
 
2. Date of record. The record date follows the declaration; it is the date on which the corporation 
prepares the list of current stockholders who will receive the dividend payment. The dividend is 
payable only to those names listed on the record date. No journal entry is made on this date.
 
3. Date of payment. The payment date is the date on which cash is disbursed to pay the divi-
dend liability.
These three dates apply for all cash dividends and can be shown graphically as follows:
Declaration Date 
Date of Record 
Date of Payment
On the declaration date, a company records a liability related to the dividend. To illustrate, on 
September 11, Whole Foods records the following journal entry. The $43 million is reported in 
the last column above.

directors officially approves a

Notice that the declaration and payment of a cash dividend reduce assets (cash) and stock-
holders’ equity (retained earnings) by the same amount. This observation explains the two 
fundamental requirements for payment of a cash dividend:
 
1. Sufficient retained earnings or net income. The corporation must have accumulated a 
sufficient amount of retained earnings, or earned a sufficient amount of income during the 
period, to cover the amount of the dividend.

One of the reasons that investors buy common stock is to earn dividends. We have looked at dividends 
paid in cash. In the next section, we will look at dividends paid in stock. Before we move on, complete 
the following questions to test your understanding of the concepts we have covered so far.

2. Sufficient cash. The corporation must have sufficient cash to pay the dividend and meet 
the operating needs of the business. The mere fact that the Retained Earnings account has 
a large credit balance does not mean that the board of directors can declare and pay a cash 
dividend. The cash generated in the past by earnings represented in the Retained Earnings 
account may have been spent to acquire inventory, buy operational assets, and pay liabilities. 
Consequently, no necessary relationship exists between the balance of retained earnings and 
the balance of cash on any particular date. Quite simply, retained earnings is not cash.
Investors should be careful to research a company’s dividend policy before investing. In the 
United States, there is no legal obligation for companies to declare dividends, regardless of how 
profitable the company is. Many very successful companies have never paid dividends while 
other equally successful companies pay out a large percentage of their earnings each year. The 
dividend policy for a company is determined by the board of directors. In some other countries, 
dividend payments are not discretionary and are required by law. In Brazil, for example, compa-
nies are legally required to pay out at least 25 percent of their net income in dividends each year.
While U.S. companies are under no legal obligation to declare dividends, once the board 
of directors declares a dividend (i.e., creates a dividend payable), there is a legal obligation to 
pay that dividend. In the case of a corporate bankruptcy, dividends payable would be a legally 
enforceable claim against the company.
Impact of Dividends on Stock Price
Another date that is important in understanding dividends has no accounting implications. The date two 
business days before the date of record is known as the ex-dividend date. This date is established by the 
stock exchanges to account for the fact that it takes time (typically three days) to officially transfer stock 
from a seller to a buyer. If you buy stock before the ex-dividend date, you will be listed as the owner on 
the date of record and will receive the dividend. If you buy stock on the ex-dividend date or later, the 
previous owner will be listed as the owner on the date of record and will therefore receive the dividend.
If you follow stock prices, you will notice that they often fall on the ex-dividend date. The stock is 
worth less on that date because it no longer includes the right to receive the next dividend.

Stock Dividends
Unless stated otherwise, the term dividend means a cash dividend. Though cash dividends are 
by far the most common type of dividend, companies can also distribute additional shares of 
stock as a dividend. A stock dividend is a distribution of additional shares of a company’s own 
stock to its stockholders on a pro rata basis at no cost to the stockholder.
The phrase pro rata basis means that each stockholder receives additional shares equal to the 
percentage of shares held. A stockholder with 10 percent of the outstanding shares would 
receive 10 percent of any additional shares issued as a stock dividend.
The economic value of a stock dividend is the subject of much debate. In reality, a stock div-
idend by itself has no economic value. All stockholders receive a pro rata distribution of shares, 
which means that each stockholder owns exactly the same portion of the company as before. 
The value of an investment is determined by the percentage of the company that is owned, not 
the number of shares held. If you get change for a dollar, you do not have more wealth because 
you hold four quarters instead of one dollar. Similarly, if you own 10 percent of a company, you 
are not wealthier simply because the company declares a stock dividend and gives you (and all 
other stockholders) more shares of stock. Both before and after the stock dividend, you own 10 
percent of the company.
The stock market reacts immediately when a stock dividend is issued, and the stock price 
falls. Theoretically, if the stock price was $60 before a stock dividend and the company doubles 
the number of shares outstanding by issuing a stock dividend, the price of the company’s stock 
should fall to $30. In reality, the fall in price may not be exactly proportional to the number of 
new shares issued. In some cases, the stock dividend makes the stock more attractive to new 
investors. Many investors prefer to buy stock in round lots, typically in multiples of 100 shares. 
An investor with $10,000 might not buy a stock selling for $150, for instance, because she

cannot afford to buy 100 shares. However, she might buy the stock if the price were less than 
$100 as the result of a stock dividend. In such cases, the stock price decrease at the time of a 
stock dividend will likely not be exactly proportional to the number of new shares issued.
When a company’s board of directors declares a stock dividend, the company transfers an 
amount from the Retained Earnings account (or the Additional Paid-in Capital account) into the 
Common Stock account to reflect the additional shares issued. The amount transferred depends 
on whether the stock dividend is classified as a large stock dividend or a small stock dividend.
A large stock dividend involves the distribution of additional shares that amount to more 
than 20–25 percent of currently outstanding shares. A small stock dividend involves the dis-
tribution of shares that amount to less than 20–25 percent of currently outstanding shares. 
Because a large stock dividend significantly decreases a company’s stock price, GAAP requires 
the amount transferred to the Common Stock account to be based on the par value of the stock. 
In the case of a small stock dividend, GAAP requires the amount transferred to be based on the 
market price of the stock, with the par value amount being transferred to the Common Stock 
account and the excess transferred to the Additional Paid-in Capital account.
To demonstrate how the accounting for stock dividends works, assume Trader Joe’s 
declared a large stock dividend that resulted in an additional 50,000,000 shares of $1 par value 
stock being distributed to stockholders. On the date of declaration, Trader Joe’s would record 
the following journal entry:
Retained earnings (−SE) ($1 par value × 50,000,000)  . . . . . . . . .

Now assume Trader Joe’s declared a small stock dividend that resulted in an additional 
5,000,000 shares being distributed to stockholders. On the date of declaration, Trader Joe’s 
stock was trading at $12 per share. The journal entry Trader Joe’s would enter is:
Retained earnings (−SE) ($12 market price × 5,000,000)  . . . . . .

It is important to note that regardless of whether a stock dividend is classified as large or small, 
there is no change in the total amount of stockholders’ equity. Both large and small stock divi-
dends merely redistribute amounts within the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet.
Stock Splits
Stock splits are not dividends. While they are similar to a stock dividend in the sense that they 
distribute additional shares of stock to stockholders, they are quite different in terms of how 
they impact accounts in the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet.
Whether a company distributes additional shares of stock by declaring a stock dividend or 
by initiating a stock split is often determined by state law. In a stock split, a company commits 
to giving stockholders a specified number of additional shares for each share that they currently 
hold. For example, when a company declares a two-for-one stock split, a stockholder who

We have concluded our discussion of common stock by looking at stock dividends and stock splits. In 
the next section, we will provide a brief introduction to the statement of stockholders’ equity and then 
discuss preferred stock. Before you move on, complete the following questions to test your under-
standing of the concepts we have covered so far.
S E L F - S T U D Y  Q U I Z
Barton Corporation issued 100,000 shares of common stock (par value $0.10) by declaring a stock 
dividend. At the time the dividend was declared, Barton’s stock was trading at $30 per share.

owned one share of stock before the split will own two shares of stock after the split. In essence, 
the one share has been “split” into two shares. A company’s footnotes will state whether the 
stock split applies to all authorized, issued, and outstanding shares.
When a company initiates a stock split, it also reduces the par value of its stock so that the 
total dollar amount in the Common Stock account remains unchanged. For instance, if Trader 
Joe’s executes a two-for-one stock split, thereby doubling the number of shares issued, it would 
reduce the par value of its stock from $1 to $0.50. In contrast to a stock dividend, a stock split 
does not change any account balances in the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet.
In both a stock dividend and a stock split, the stockholder receives more shares of stock 
without having to invest additional resources to acquire the shares. A stock dividend requires a 
journal entry; a stock split does not but is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The 
comparative effects of a large stock dividend versus a stock split may be summarized as follows:

It is quite common for companies to announce a “stock split” but to account for the distribution 
of additional shares as a large stock dividend. Companies typically do this to avoid changing 
the par value of their common stock. Such announcements are referred to as initiating a “stock 
split effected in the form of a stock dividend.” Whenever you see this phrase, know that the 
company has accounted for the transaction as a large stock dividend.

In previous chapters we discussed three of the four financial statements required by GAAP: 
the income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows. The fourth required 
statement is the statement of stockholders’ equity. The purpose of the fourth statement is to 
show how accounts in the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet have changed over 
the accounting period. Common accounts shown are common stock, additional paid-in capital, 
treasury stock, and retained earnings. The statement of stockholders’ (shareholders’) equity for 
Whole Foods is shown in Exhibit 11.2. Under GAAP, the statement must show three years of 
data, but, for illustrative purposes, we show only the latest year.
As you review Exhibit 11.2, you will observe many of the issues discussed in this chapter. 
Notice for example:
 
1. Treasury stock was purchased at a cost of $578 (million).
 
2. Cash dividends totaling $176 (million) were paid, which reduced retained earnings.
 
3. Net income was $579 (million), which increased retained earnings.
The statement also contains a number of other changes that involve topics typically covered 
in an intermediate accounting course. Perhaps the most important one is accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss), which captures certain items that are reported as a part of com-
prehensive income, but not net income. Examples of items that are not included in the compu-
tation of net income:
 
1. Unrealized holding gains or losses from certain types of securities. Under GAAP, gains and 
losses from holding certain types of securities are reported on the income statement only 
when the stock is sold. Unrealized gains and losses that occur before the stock is sold are 
included in comprehensive income.
 
2. Foreign currency translation gains and losses. Many U.S. companies have foreign subsid-
iaries that conduct business using foreign currencies. Incorporating the financial statements 
of these foreign subsidiaries into a U.S. company’s financial statements requires the use 
of a foreign currency exchange rate. Changes in exchange rates from year to year result in 
foreign currency translation gains and losses.These gains and losses are included in compre-
hensive income.
We briefly introduce several components of comprehensive income to give you a more com-
plete understanding of the items included on the statement of stockholders’ equity. If you 
choose to take an intermediate accounting course, you will learn a great deal more about these 
topics.

In addition to common stock, some corporations issue preferred stock. The journal entries 
required to record the issuance and repurchase of preferred stock are the same as the jour-
nal entries required to record the issuance and repurchase of common stock. Preferred 
stock, however, differs from common stock in a number of ways. The most significant 
 
differences are:

 Preferred stock typically does not have voting rights. Without voting rights, pre-
ferred stock does not appeal to investors who want some control over the operations of 
a corporation. The lack of voting rights is one of the reasons some corporations issue 
preferred stock to raise capital: Issuing preferred stock permits them to raise money 
without diluting common stockholders’ control. The nearby chart shows the percentage 
of companies surveyed by Accounting Trends & Techniques that include preferred stock 
in their capital structure.
PREFERRED STOCK 
Stock that has specified rights 
over common stock.


 Preferred stock is less risky. Generally, preferred stock is less risky than common stock 
because holders receive priority payment of dividends and distribution of assets if the cor-
poration goes out of business. Usually a specified amount per share must be paid to preferred 
stockholders before any remaining assets can be distributed to the common stockholders.

 Preferred stock typically has a fixed dividend rate. For example, “6 percent preferred 
stock, par value $10 per share” pays an annual dividend of 6 percent of par value, or $0.60 
per share. If preferred stock had no par value, the preferred dividend would be specified as 
$0.60 per share. The fixed dividend is attractive to certain investors who want stable income 
from their investments.

Dividends on Preferred Stock
Because investors who purchase preferred stock give up certain advantages that are available to 
investors who hold common stock, preferred stock offers a dividend preference. The two most 
common dividend preferences are current and cumulative.
Current Dividend Preference
The current dividend preference requires a company to pay current dividends to preferred 
stockholders before paying dividends to common stockholders. This preference is always a fea-
ture of preferred stock. After the current dividend preference has been met and if no other pref-
erence is operative, dividends can be paid to the common stockholders. To illustrate, assume 
Sophia Company has the following stock outstanding:
SOPHIA COMPANY
Preferred stock: 6%, $20 par value, 2,000 shares outstanding = $40,000
Common stock: $10 par value, 5,000 shares outstanding = $50,000
Assuming a current dividend preference only, dividends would be allocated as follows:

No. 2
18,000
2,400
15,600
*Preferred dividend calculation: $20 par value × 0.06 × 2,000 shares = $2,400
Cumulative Dividend Preference
The cumulative dividend preference requires any unpaid dividends on preferred stock to 
accumulate. This cumulative unpaid amount, known as dividends in arrears, must be paid 
CURRENT DIVIDEND 
PREFERENCE 
Requires that dividends be paid 
to preferred stockholders before 
any dividends are paid to common 
stockholders.
CUMULATIVE DIVIDEND

preferred stock to accumulate. 
These cumulative preferred 
dividends must be paid before any 
common dividends can be paid.

It is often confusing when different words are used to describe exactly the same thing. Such is the case 
with International Financial Accounting Standards (IFRS) and U.S. GAAP. The following table shows 
how two companies in the same industry use different terms in the stockholders’ equity section of their 
balance sheets to refer to the same accounts. The accounts are the same; only the names differ:

P E R S P E C T I V E

before any common dividends can be paid. Of course, if the preferred stock is noncumulative, 
dividends can never be in arrears, and therefore any dividend that is not declared is perma-
nently lost. Preferred stock is usually cumulative.
To illustrate the cumulative dividend preference, assume that Sophia Company’s preferred 
stock in the above example is cumulative and that dividends have been in arrears for two years.

*Preferred dividend calculation:
—Current dividend preference: $20 par value × 0.06 × 2,000 shares = $2,400
—Dividends in arrears: $2,400 × 2 years = $4,800
—Total preferred dividend: $2,400 + $4,800 = $7,200
The existence of dividends in arrears on preferred stock can limit a company’s ability to pay 
dividends to common stockholders and can affect a company’s future cash flows. Because 
dividends are never an actual liability until the board of directors declares them, dividends 
in arrears are not reported on the balance sheet. Instead, they are disclosed in the notes to the 
financial statements.
Though not typical, some preferred stock has special voting rights. For example, the excerpt below is 
from Public Storage’s 2014 Annual Report:
Preferred Stock and Limited Voting Rights
F I N A N CI A L 
A N A LYS I S
The holders of our Preferred Shares have general preference rights with respect to quarterly 
distributions and any accumulated unpaid distributions. Except under certain conditions and 
as noted below, holders of the Preferred Shares will not be entitled to vote on most matters. In 
the event of a cumulative arrearage equal to six quarterly dividends, holders of all outstanding 
preferred shares will have the right to elect two additional members to serve on our board of 
trustees (the “Board”) until the arrearage has been cured. At December 31, 2014, there were no 
dividends in arrears.

This special voting right allows preferred stockholders to have some say in operational matters if the 
company has had difficulty paying dividends for an extended period of time.

Accounting for Owner’s Equity for Sole Proprietorships and Partnerships
Owner’s Equity for a Sole Proprietorship
A sole proprietorship is an unincorporated business owned by one person. Only two owner’s equity 
accounts are typically used: (1) a capital account for the proprietor (Hans Solo, Capital) and (2) a  
drawing 
(or withdrawal) account for the proprietor (Hans Solo, Drawing).


C H AP TER  1 1   Reporting and Interpreting Stockholders’ Equity
575
The capital account of a sole proprietorship serves two purposes: to record investments by the owner 
and to accumulate the income or loss each accounting period. The drawing account is used to record 
the owner’s withdrawals of cash or other assets from the business. The drawing account is a temporary 
account that is closed to the owner’s capital account at the end of each accounting period. Thus, the capi-
tal account reflects the cumulative total of all investments by the owner and all earnings of the entity less 
all withdrawals from the entity by the owner.
In most respects, the accounting for a sole proprietorship is the same as for a corporation.

C HAP TER  1 1  Reporting and Interpreting Stockholders’ Equity
Because a sole proprietorship does not pay income taxes, its financial statements do not reflect income 
tax expense or income taxes payable. Instead, the net income of a sole proprietorship is taxed when it is 
included on the owner’s personal income tax return. Likewise, any withdrawal by the sole proprietor is 
not recognized as an expense but rather is accounted for as a distribution of profits. 
Owners’ Equity for a Partnership
The Uniform Partnership Act, which most states have adopted, defines a partnership as “an association of 
two or more persons to carry on as co-owners of a business for profit.” Small businesses and profession-
als such as accountants, doctors, and lawyers often use the partnership form of business.
A partnership is formed by two or more persons reaching mutual agreement about the terms of the rela-
tionship. The law does not require an application for a charter as in the case with a corporation. Instead, 
the agreement between the partners constitutes a partnership contract. This agreement should specify mat-
ters such as division of periodic income, management responsibilities, transfer or sale of partnership inter-
ests, disposition of assets upon liquidation, and procedures to be followed in case of the death of a partner. 
If the partnership agreement does not specify these matters, the laws of the resident state are binding.
The primary advantages of a partnership are (1) ease of formation, (2) complete control by the part-
ners, and (3) lack of income taxes on the business itself. The primary disadvantage is the unlimited liabil-
ity of each partner for the partnership’s debts. If the partnership does not have sufficient assets to satisfy 
outstanding debt, creditors of the partnership can seize the partners’ personal assets.
As with a sole proprietorship, accounting for a partnership follows the same underlying principles 
as any other form of business organization, except for those entries that directly affect owners’ equity. 
Accounting for partners’ equity follows the same pattern as for a sole proprietorship, except that separate 
capital and drawing accounts are established for each partner. Investments by each partner are credited to 
that partner’s capital account; withdrawals are debited to the respective partner’s drawing account. The 
net income of a partnership is divided among the partners in accordance with the partnership agreement 
and credited to each account. The respective drawing accounts are closed to the partner capital accounts. 
After the closing process, each partner’s capital account reflects the cumulative total of all of that part-
ner’s investments plus that partner’s share of the partnership earnings less all that partner’s withdrawals.

Like a sole proprietorship, a partnership does not report an income tax expense on its income state-
ment. Partners must report their share of the partnership profits on their individual tax returns. Also like 
sole proprietorships, withdrawals by the partners are not recorded as expenses but rather are treated as 
distributions of profits.
 
11-1. Explain the role of stock in the capital structure of a corporation.  p. 557
Issuing stock is one way corporations raise capital. Corporations issue stock by selling it to inves-
tors, who then become owners of the corporation. Investors can trade their stock on established 
stock exchanges.
 
11-2. Compute and analyze the earnings per share ratio.  p. 559
The earnings per share (EPS) ratio is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average 
number of common shares outstanding. The EPS ratio facilitates the comparison of a company’s 
earnings over time or with other companies’ earnings at a single point in time. By expressing earn-
ings on a per share basis, differences in the size of companies become less important.
 
11-3. Describe the characteristics of common stock and report common stock transactions. 
 
p. 559 
Common stock is the basic voting stock issued by a corporation. Usually it has a par value, but 
no-par stock can also be issued.
A number of key transactions involve common stock: (1) initial sale of stock, (2) treasury stock 
transactions, (3) cash dividends, and (4) stock dividends and stock splits. Each type of transaction 
is illustrated in this chapter.
 
11-4. Discuss and report dividends. p. 563 
Investors earn a return on their stock investment through stock price appreciation or the receipt 
of cash dividends. Cash dividends are payments to stockholders, typically on a per share basis. A 
company records a dividend as a liability when its board of directors declares the dividend (i.e., 
on the date of declaration). The liability is satisfied when the company pays the cash dividend to 
stockholders (i.e., on the date of payment).

11-5. Compute and analyze the dividend yield ratio. p. 563 
The dividend yield ratio is computed by dividing dividends per share by a stock’s market price 
per share. The dividend yield ratio measures an investor’s return on investment attributed to 
the dividends a company pays. For most companies, the return associated with dividends is 
 
very small.
 
11-6. Discuss and report stock dividends and stock splits. p. 566 
Stock dividends and stock splits are both ways for companies to distribute additional shares of 
stock to existing owners. When a company initiates a stock dividend, it records a journal entry that 
transfers the dividend amount from the retained earnings account to the common stock account 
and, if applicable, the additional paid-in capital account. When a company initiates a stock split, 
no journal entry is required; rather, the company simply increases the number of shares issued and 
decreases the par value per share.
 
11-7. Describe the characteristics of preferred stock and report preferred stock transactions. 
 
p. 570 
The purpose of preferred stock is the same as that of common stock: to raise capital. Pre-
ferred stock differs from common stock in that it is much less common, typically does not 
have voting rights, and may have a current dividend preference and/or a cumulative dividend 
preference. A current dividend preference specifies that preferred stockholders will receive 
dividends before common stockholders. A cumulative preference specifies that preferred 
stockholders will receive any past unpaid dividends before common stockholders receive 
 
current dividends.
 
11-8. Discuss the impact of stock transactions on cash flows. p. 572 
Any cash inflows or outflows associated with a company’s stock are reported in the Financing 
Activities section of the company’s statement of cash flows. Typical inflows are the issuance of 
stock and the reselling of treasury shares. Typical outflows are the repurchase of treasury shares 
and the payment of dividends.
This chapter concludes a major section of the book. In the previous several chapters, we have dis-
cussed individual sections of the balance sheet. We will now shift our focus to the statement of cash 
flows. In the next chapter, you will learn how companies report cash transactions on the statement of cash 
flows, and how companies use information from the balance sheet and income statement to create the 
statement of cash flows.
K E Y  R A T I O S
The earnings per share ratio reflects net income on a per share basis. The ratio is computed as 
 
follows (see the “Key Ratio Analysis” box in the Ownership of a Corporation section):
Earnings per Share = 
Net Income
Weighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding
The dividend yield ratio measures the return on investment attributable to the dividends a  
company 
pays. The ratio is computed as follows (see the “Key Ratio Analysis” box in the Dividends on  
Common 
Stock section):
Dividend Yield = Dividends per Share
Market Price per Share

Balance Sheet
Under Current Liabilities
Dividends, once declared by the board of 
directors, are reported as a liability (usually 
current).
Under Noncurrent Liabilities
Transactions involving capital stock do not 
generate noncurrent liabilities.
Under Stockholders’ Equity
Typical accounts include:
Common stock
Preferred stock
Additional paid-in capital
Retained earnings
Treasury stock
Income Statement
Capital stock transactions do not affect the income 
statement. Dividends paid are not an expense. 
They are a distribution of income and are, there-
fore, not reported on the income statement. 
Dividends are taken directly out of stockholders’ 
equity by reducing retained earnings.
Statement of Cash Flows
Under Financing Activities
+ Cash inflows from initial sale of stock
+ Cash inflows from sale of treasury stock
− Cash outflows for dividends
− Cash outflows for purchase of treasury stock

This statement reports detailed information 
concerning stockholders’ equity, including
   Amounts in each equity account,
   Number of shares outstanding,

Most companies report information about their 
stock option plans and information about major 
transactions such as stock dividends or significant 
treasury stock transactions. A historical summary 
of dividends paid per share is typically provided. 
Also, dividends in arrears on preferred stock, if 
any, would be reported in the footnotes.

Analyzing Dividend Policy
Heather and Scott, two young financial analysts, were reviewing financial statements for Google, one of 
the world’s largest technology companies. Scott noted that the company did not report any dividends in 
the financing activity section of the statement of cash flows and said, “I have heard that Google is a very 
profitable company. If it’s so profitable, why isn’t it paying any dividends?” Heather wasn’t convinced 
that Scott was looking in the right place for dividends but didn’t say anything.
Scott continued the discussion by noting, “Sales for Google are up nearly 43 percent over the previous 
two years, while net income is up over $1 billion compared to last year, and cash flows from operating 
activities are up over $3 billion to a total of $17 billion.”
At that point, Heather noted that the statement of cash flows reported that Google had spent $11  
billion 
in capital expenditures and $15 billion paying back debt. She was confused about whether Google was in 
a good position to pay dividends or not.
Required:
 1. Is Heather’s concern that Scott is looking at the wrong section of the statement of cash flows 
justified?
 2. Is there a right time for a company like Google to start paying a dividend?

Critical Thinking Cases
Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma
You are a member of the board of directors of a large company that has been in business for more than 
100 years. The company is proud of the fact that it has paid dividends every year it has been in business. 
Because of this stability, many retired people have invested large portions of their savings in your com-
mon stock. Unfortunately, the company has struggled for the past few years as it tries to introduce new 
products and is considering not paying a dividend this year. The president wants to skip the dividend in 
order to have more cash to invest in product development: “If we don’t invest this money now, we won’t 
get these products to market in time to save the company. I don’t want to risk thousands of jobs.” One of 
the most senior board members speaks next: “If we don’t pay the dividend, thousands of retirees will be 
thrown into financial distress. Even if you don’t care about them, you have to recognize our stock price 
will crash when they all sell.” The company treasurer proposes an alternative: “Let’s skip the cash divi-
dend and pay a stock dividend. We can still say we’ve had a dividend every year.” The entire board now 
turns to you for your opinion. What should the company do?
Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma
You are the president of a very successful Internet company that has had a remarkably profitable year. 
You have determined that the company has more than $10 million in cash generated by operating activi-
ties not needed in the business. You are thinking about paying it out to stockholders as a special dividend. 
You discuss the idea with your vice president, who reacts angrily to your suggestion:
“Our stock price has gone up by 200 percent in the last year alone. What more do we have to do for the 
owners? The people who really earned that money are the employees who have been working 12 hours a 
day, six or seven days a week, to make the company successful. Most of them didn’t even take vacations 
last year. I say we have to pay out bonuses and nothing extra for the stockholders.”
As president, you know that you are hired by the board of directors, which is elected by the 
 
stockholders. What is your responsibility to both groups? To which group would you give the 
 
$10 million?

 b.  
From the footnotes, identify any additional information about the accounts you listed that you 
feel would be important to someone analyzing the company as a potential investment.
 2. Examine the statement of cash flows and the statement of stockholders’ equity. What amount of 
stock, if any, was issued in the most recent year? How much cash did the issuance generate for the 
company?
 a. What was the average market value per share of the issuance?
 b. Recreate the journal entry for the issuance.
 3. What amount of treasury stock, if any, did the company repurchase during the year? Did it resell any 
of its treasury stock?
 4. What types of dividends, if any, did the company declare during the year? How much was paid in 
cash?

Statement of Cash Flows
W
hile once best known for their Shasta and Faygo carbonated soft drinks, National 
Beverage now focuses on its innovative LaCroix sparkling waters, Rip It energy 
products, and Everfresh juices. These products bring its well-known reputation for 
flavor variety to the growing number of health-conscious consumers. Its diverse  
product lines 
can meet all of the beverage needs of a wide variety of consumers and retailers.  
However, for 
its strategy to earn profits for shareholders, National Beverage must also be a cost- 
effective 
producer and distributor. It maintains product quality and cost discipline through central-
ized purchasing and by owning and operating all of its production and bottling facilities. Its 
12  plants, strategically located near customer distribution centers in different markets, 
reduce distribution costs and allow National Beverage to tailor its products and media promo-
tions to regional tastes.
Although it may seem puzzling, growing profitable operations do not always ensure positive 
cash flow. As we have seen in earlier chapters, this occurs because the timing of  
revenues 
and expenses does not always match cash inflows and outflows. As a consequence, National 
Beverage must carefully manage cash flows as well as profits. For the same reasons, financial 
analysts must consider the information provided in National Beverage’s cash flow statement 
in addition to its income statement and balance sheet.
U ND E RSTAN DI N G  T H E  B USI N E SS
Clearly, net income is important, but cash flow is also critical to a company’s success. Cash 
flow permits a company to expand operations, replace worn assets, take advantage of new 


chapter 12
investment opportunities, and pay dividends to its owners. Some Wall Street 
analysts go so far as to say “Cash flow is king.” Both managers and analysts 
need to understand the various sources and uses of cash that are associated 
with business activity.
The cash flow statement focuses attention on a firm’s ability to generate 
cash internally, its management of operating assets and liabilities, and the 
details of its investments and its external financing. It is designed to help 
both managers and analysts answer important cash-related questions such 
as these:

C L A S S IF IC AT I O N S  O F  T H E  STAT E M E N T  
O F C ASH  F LOWS
Basically, the statement of cash flows explains how the amount of cash on the balance sheet at 
the beginning of the period has become the amount of cash reported at the end of the period. 
For purposes of this statement, the definition of cash includes cash and cash equivalents. Cash 
equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are both
 
1. Readily convertible to known amounts of cash and
 
2. So near to maturity there is little risk that their value will change if interest rates change.
Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify as a cash 
equivalent under this definition.1 Examples of cash equivalents are Treasury bills (a form of 
short-term U.S. government debt), money market funds, and commercial paper (short-term 
notes payable issued by large corporations).
As you can see in Exhibit 12.1, the statement of cash flows reports cash inflows and out-
flows in three broad categories: (1) operating activities, (2) investing activities, and (3) financ-
ing activities. Together, these three cash flow categories explain the change in cash from the 
beginning balance to the ending balance on the balance sheet.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE 12-1
Classify cash flow statement 
items as part of net cash flows 
from operating, investing, and 
financing activities.
CASH EQUIVALENTS 
Short-term investments with 
original maturities of three 
months or less that are readily 
convertible to cash and whose 
value is unlikely to change.
1Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month 
Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. A 
Treasury note purchased three years ago, however, does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity 
is three months.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities (cash flows from operations) are the cash inflows and 
outflows that relate directly to revenues and expenses reported on the income statement. There 
are two alternative approaches for presenting the operating activities section of the statement:
 
1. The direct method reports the components of cash flows from operating activities as gross 
receipts and gross payments.
Inflows
Outflows
Cash received from
Cash paid for
Customers
Dividends and interest on investments
Purchase of services (electricity, etc.) 
 
 and goods for resale
Salaries and wages
Income taxes
Interest on liabilities
CASH FLOWS FROM

(CASH FLOWS FROM

Cash inflows and outflows directly 
related to earnings from normal 
operations.
DIRECT METHOD
A method of presenting the 
operating activities section of 
the statement of cash flows that 
reports components of cash flows 
from operating activities as gross 
receipts and gross payments.


604
C HAP TER  1 2  Statement of Cash Flows
The difference between the inflows and outflows is called net cash provided by (used 
by) operating activities. National Beverage experienced a net cash inflow of $53,269 
(all amounts in thousands) from its operations for the fiscal year ended May 3, 2014 (here-
after 2014). Though the FASB recommends the direct method, it is rarely used in the 
 
United States. Many financial executives have reported that they do not use it because it 
is more expensive to implement than the indirect method. Both the FASB and the IASB 
are considering a proposal to require this method, but intense opposition from the preparer 
 
community continues.
 
2. The indirect method starts with net income from the income statement and then eliminates 
noncash items to arrive at net cash inflow (outflow) from operating activities.
Net income
+/− Adjustments for noncash items
Net cash inflow (outflow) from operating activities
Ninety-nine percent of large U.S. companies, including National Beverage, use the indirect 
method.2 Notice in Exhibit 12.1 that in the year 2014, National Beverage reported posi-
tive net income of $43,635 but generated positive cash flows from operating activities of 
$53,269. Why should income and cash flows from operating activities differ? Remember 
that on the income statement, revenues are recorded when they are earned, without regard 
to when the related cash inflows occur. Similarly, expenses are matched with revenues and 
recorded without regard to when the related cash outflows occur.
For now, the most important thing to remember about the two methods is that they are simply 
alternative ways to arrive at the same number. The total amount of cash flows from operating 
activities is always the same (an inflow of $53,269 in National Beverage’s case), regardless 
of whether it is computed using the direct or indirect method, as illustrated below.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities are cash inflows and outflows related to the purchase and 
disposal of long-lived productive assets and investments in the securities of other companies. 
Typical cash flows from investing activities include:
Inflows
Outflows
Cash received from
Cash paid for
Sale or disposal of property, plant,  
 and equipment
Purchase of property, plant,  
 and equipment
Sale or maturity of investments in securities
Purchase of investments in securities
The difference between these cash inflows and outflows is called net cash provided by (used 
by) investing activities.

We just discussed the three main sections of the cash flow statement: Cash Flows from Operating 
Activities, which are related to earning income from normal operations; Cash Flows from Investing 
Activities, which are related to the acquisition and sale of productive assets; and Cash Flows from 
Financing Activities, which are related to external financing of the enterprise. The net cash inflow or 
outflow for the year is the same amount as the increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents for 
the year on the balance sheet. To make sure you understand the appropriate classifications of the dif-
ferent cash flows, answer the following questions before you move on.

For National Beverage, this amount was an outflow of $11,082 for the year 2014. Most 
of the activity was related to purchases and sales of short-term investments and the purchase 
and sale of property, plant, and equipment. Since total purchases exceeded cash collected from 
sales, there was a net cash outflow.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing activities include exchanges of cash with creditors (debtholders) 
and owners (stockholders). Usual cash flows from financing activities include the following:
Inflows
Outflows
Cash received from
Cash paid for
Borrowing on notes, mortgages, bonds, etc., 
 
 from creditors
Repayment of principal to creditors (excluding 
 
 interest, which is an operating activity)
Issuing stock to owners
Repurchasing stock from owners
Dividends to owners
The difference between these cash inflows and outflows is called net cash provided by (used 
by) financing activities.
National Beverage experienced a net cash outflow from financing activities of $30,522 
for the year 2014. The Financing Activities section of its statement shows that National Bev-
erage paid $22,772 in principal on long-term debt, $726 in dividends, and $7,024 for stock 
repurchases.3
Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash
The combination of the net cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and 
financing activities must equal the net increase (decrease) in cash for the reporting period. 
For the year 2014, National Beverage reported a net increase in cash of $11,665, which 
explains the change in cash on the balance sheet from the beginning balance of $18,267 to the 
ending balance of $29,932.

C HAP TER  1 2  Statement of Cash Flows
To give you a better understanding of the statement of cash flows, we now discuss National 
Beverage’s statement in more detail, including the way in which it relates to the balance sheet 
and income statement. Then we examine how each section of the statement describes a set of 
important decisions made by National Beverage’s management. Last, we examine how finan-
cial analysts use each section to evaluate the company’s performance.
Relationships to the Balance Sheet and Income Statement
Preparing and interpreting the cash flow statement requires an analysis of the balance sheet 
and income statement accounts that relate to the three sections of the cash flow statement. In 
previous chapters, we emphasized that companies record transactions as journal entries that are 
posted to T-accounts, which are used to prepare the income statement and the balance sheet. 
But companies cannot prepare the statement of cash flows using the amounts recorded in the 
T-accounts because those amounts are based on accrual accounting. Instead, they must analyze 
the numbers recorded under the accrual method and adjust them to a cash basis. To prepare the 
statement of cash flows, they need the following data:
 
1. Comparative balance sheets used in calculating the cash flows from all activities (operat-
ing, investing, and financing).
 
2. A complete income statement used primarily in calculating cash flows from operating 
activities.
 
3. Additional details concerning selected accounts where the total change amount in an 
account balance during the year does not reveal the underlying nature of the cash flows.
Our approach to preparing and understanding the cash flow statement focuses on the 
changes in the balance sheet accounts. It relies on a simple manipulation of the balance sheet 
equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity
First, assets can be split into cash and noncash assets:
Cash + Noncash Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity
If we move the noncash assets to the right side of the equation, then:
Cash = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity - Noncash Assets

EXHIBIT 12.2
Selected Cash Transactions 
and Their Effects on Other 
Balance Sheet Accounts
Given this relationship, the changes (∆) in cash between the beginning and the end of the 
period must equal the changes (∆) in the amounts on the right side of the equation between the 
beginning and the end of the period:
∆ Cash = ∆ Liabilities + ∆ Stockholders’ Equity - ∆ Noncash Assets
Thus, any transaction that changes cash must be accompanied by a change in liabilities, 
stockholders’ equity, or noncash assets. Exhibit 12.2 illustrates this concept for selected cash 
transactions.
Preliminary Steps in Preparing the Cash Flow Statement
Based on this logic, we use the following preliminary steps to prepare the cash flow statement:
 
1. Determine the change in each balance sheet account. From this year’s ending balance, sub-
tract this year’s beginning balance (i.e., last year’s ending balance).
 
2. Classify each change as relating to operating (O), investing (I), or financing (F) activities by 
marking them with the corresponding letter. Use Exhibit 12.3 as a guide.
The balance sheet accounts related to earning income (operating items) should be 
marked with an O. These accounts are often called operating assets and liabilities. The 
accounts that should be marked with an O include the following:

 Most current assets (other than short-term investments, which relate to investing activities, 
and cash).4

 Most current liabilities (other than amounts owed to investors and financial institutions,5 all 
of which relate to financing activities).

 Retained Earnings because it increases by the amount of net income, which is the starting 
point for the operating section. (Retained Earnings also decreases by dividends declared and 
paid, which is a financing outflow noted by an F.)
In Exhibit 12.3, all of the operating assets and liabilities have been marked with an O. These 
items include:

 Accounts Receivable

 Inventories
4Certain noncurrent assets such as long-term receivables from customers and noncurrent liabilities such as 
postretirement obligations to employees are considered to be operating items. These items are covered in more 
advanced accounting classes.
5Examples of the accounts excluded are Dividends Payable, Short-Term Debt to Financial Institutions, and Current 
Maturities of Long-Term Debt. Current maturities of long-term debt are amounts of debt with an original term 
of more than one year that are due within one year of the statement date. Certain noncurrent liabilities involving 
payables to suppliers, to employees, or for taxes are also considered to be operating liabilities. These items are 
covered in more advanced accounting classes.

As noted above, the operating section can be prepared in two formats, and nearly all U.S. 
companies choose the indirect method. As a result, we discuss the indirect method here 
and the direct method in Supplement A at the end of the chapter.
Recall that:
 
1. Cash flow from operating activities is always the same regardless of whether it is computed 
using the direct or indirect method.
 
2. The investing and financing sections are always presented in the same manner regardless of 
the format of the operating section.
Reporting Cash Flows from Operating Activities—Indirect Method
Exhibit 12.3 shows National Beverage’s comparative balance sheet and income statement. 
Remember that the indirect method starts with net income and converts it to cash flows from 
operating activities. This involves adjusting net income for the differences in the timing of accrual 
basis net income and cash flows. The general structure of the operating activities section is:
Operating Activities
Net income
Adjustments to reconcile net income to cash flow from operating activities:
 +Depreciation and amortization expense
 −Gain on sale of investing asset
 +Loss on sale of investing asset
 +Decreases in operating assets
 +Increases in operating liabilities
 −Increases in operating assets
 −Decreases in operating liabilities
Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities
To keep track of all the additions and subtractions made to convert net income to cash flows 
from operating activities, it is helpful to set up a schedule to record the computations. We will 
construct a schedule for National Beverage in Exhibit 12.4.

EXHIBIT 12.4
National Beverage Corp.: 
Schedule for Net Cash Flow 
from Operating Activities, 
Indirect Method (dollars in 
thousands)
We begin our schedule presented in Exhibit 12.4 with net income of $43,635 taken from 
National Beverage’s income statement (Exhibit 12.3). Completing the operating section using 
the indirect method involves two steps:
Step 1: Adjust net income for depreciation and amortization expense and gains and losses on sale of 
investing assets such as property, plant, and equipment and investments. Recording depreciation 
and amortization expense does not affect the cash account (or any other operating asset or liability). 
It affects a noncurrent investing asset (Property, plant, and equipment, net). Since depreciation and 
 
amortization expense is subtracted in computing net income but does not affect cash, we always 
add it back to convert net income to cash flow from operating activities. In the case of National  
Beverage, 
we need to remove the effect of depreciation and amortization expense by adding back $10,063 to net 
income (see Exhibit 12.4).
 
 
 If National Beverage had sold property, plant, and equipment at a gain or loss, the amount of cash received 
would be classified as an investing cash inflow. Since all of the cash received is an investing cash flow, an 
adjustment must also be made in the operating activities section to avoid double counting the gain or loss. 
Gains on sales of property, plant, and equipment are subtracted and losses on such sales are added 
to convert net income to cash flow from operating activities. We illustrate the relevant computations and 
adjustments for gains and losses on the sale of long-term assets in Supplement B at the end of the chapter.6
Step 2: Adjust net income for changes in assets and liabilities marked as operating (O). Each change in 
operating assets (other than cash and short-term investments) and liabilities (other than amounts owed 
to owners and financial institutions) causes a difference between net income and cash flow from operat-
ing activities.7 When converting net income to cash flow from operating activities, apply the following 
general rules:


6Other similar additions and subtractions are discussed in more advanced accounting courses.
7As noted earlier, certain noncurrent assets, such as long-term receivables from customers, and noncurrent 
liabilities, such as postretirement obligations to employees, are considered to be operating items. These items are 
covered in more advanced accounting classes.


C H AP TER  1 2   Statement of Cash Flows
611
Understanding what makes these assets and liabilities increase and decrease is the key to under-
standing the logic of these additions and subtractions.
Change in Accounts Receivable
We illustrate this logic with the first operating item (O) listed on National Beverage’s 
 
balance sheet (Exhibit 12.3), accounts receivable. Remember that the income statement 
reflects sales revenue, but the cash flow statement must reflect cash collections from cus-
tomers. As the  
following accounts receivable T-account illustrates, when sales revenues are 
recorded, accounts receivable increases, and when cash is collected from customers, accounts 
 
receivable decreases.
In the National Beverage example, sales revenue reported on the income statement is less than 
cash collections from customers by $641,135 − $646,999 = ($5,864). Because more money 
was collected from customers, this amount must be added to net income to convert to cash 
flows from operating activities. Note that this amount is also the same as the change in the 
accounts receivable account:
Ending balance
$58,205
− Beginning balance
"""""""""""""""64,069
Change
($"""""" 5,864)
This same underlying logic is used to determine adjustments for the other operating assets and 
liabilities.
To summarize, the income statement reflects revenues of the period, but cash flow 
from operating activities must reflect cash collections from customers. Sales on account 
increase the balance in accounts receivable, and collections from customers decrease 
the balance.

Decrease

The balance sheet for National Beverage Corp. (Exhibit 12.3) indicates a decrease 
in accounts receivable of $5,864 for the period, which means that cash collected from 
customers is higher than revenue. To convert to cash flows from operating activities, 
the amount of the decrease (the increased collections) must be added in Exhibit 12.4. 
(An increase is subtracted.)
Change in Inventory
The income statement reflects merchandise sold for the period, whereas cash flow from operat-
ing activities must reflect cash purchases. As shown in the Inventories T-account, purchases of 
goods increase the balance in inventory, and recording merchandise sold decreases the balance 
in inventory.

to convert to cash flow from operating activities in Exhibit 12.4. (A decrease is added.)
Change in Prepaid Expenses
The income statement reflects expenses of the period, but cash flow from operating 
activities must reflect the cash payments. Cash prepayments increase the balance in 
prepaid expenses, and recording of expenses decreases the balance in prepaid expenses.

Change in Accrued Expenses
The income statement reflects all accrued expenses, but the cash flow statement must 
reflect actual payments for those expenses. Recording accrued expenses increases the bal-

expenses.

U.S. GAAP and IFRS differ in the cash flow statement treatment of interest received and interest paid as 
follows:
Interest Received
Interest Paid
U.S. GAAP
Operating
Operating
IFRS
Operating or Investing
Operating or Financing
Under U.S. GAAP, interest paid and received are both classified as operating cash flows because the 
related revenue and expense enter into the computation of net income. This makes it easier to compare 
net income to cash flow from operations. It also benefits the financial statement user by ensuring com-
parability across companies. IFRS, on the other hand, allows interest received to be classified as either 
operating or investing and interest paid to be classified as either operating or financing. This recognizes 
that interest received results from investing activities, whereas interest paid, like dividends paid, involves 
payments to providers of financing. However, the alternative classifications may be confusing to finan-
cial statement readers.

The indirect method for reporting cash flows from operating activities reports a conversion of net 
income to net cash flow from operating activities. The conversion involves additions and subtractions 
for (1) expenses (such as depreciation expense) and revenues that do not affect current assets or cur-
rent liabilities and (2) changes in each of the individual current assets (other than cash and short-term

Interpreting Cash Flows from Operating Activities
The operating activities section of the cash flow statement focuses attention on the firm’s abil-
ity to generate cash internally through operations and its management of current assets and 
current liabilities (also called working capital). Most analysts believe that this is the most 
important section of the statement because, in the long run, operations are the only source of 
cash. That is, investors will not invest in a company if they do not believe that cash generated 
from operations will be available to pay them dividends or expand the company. Similarly, 
creditors will not lend money if they do not believe that cash generated from operations will be 
available to pay back the loan. For example, many dot-com companies crashed when investors 
lost faith in their ability to turn business ideas into cash flows from operations.
A common rule of thumb followed by financial and credit analysts is to avoid firms with ris-
ing net income but falling cash flow from operations. Rapidly rising inventories or receivables 
often predict a slump in profits and the need for external financing. A true understanding of the 
meaning of the difference requires a detailed understanding of its causes.
In the year 2014, National Beverage reported that cash flow from operations was higher 
than net income. What caused this relationship? To answer these questions, we must carefully 
analyze how National Beverage’s operating activities are reported in its cash flow statement. 
To properly interpret this information, we also must learn more about the beverage industry. 
National Beverage normally reports higher cash flow from operations than net income because 
of the effect of depreciation and amortization, which reduces income but is not a cash outflow. 
At the same time, it carefully manages the assets and liabilities that enter into the operating 
cash flow calculation, keeping those total changes to a minimum. Many analysts compute the 
quality of income ratio as a general sign of the ability to generate cash through operations.

RATIO AND COMPARISONS
Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
Net Income
Quality of Income Ratio =
National Beverage Corp.’s ratio for the year 2014 was:
53,269
43,635 = 1.22 (122%)

INTERPRETATIONS
In General The quality of income ratio measures the portion of income that was generated in cash. 
All other things equal, a higher quality of income ratio indicates greater ability to finance operating and 
other cash needs from operating cash inflows. A higher ratio also indicates that it is less likely that the 
company is using aggressive revenue recognition policies to increase net income, and therefore is less 
likely to experience a decline in earnings in the future. When this ratio does not equal 1.0, analysts must 
establish the sources of the difference to determine the significance of the findings. There are four poten-
tial causes of any difference:
 
1. The corporate life cycle (growth or decline in sales). When sales are increasing, receiv-
ables and inventory normally increase faster than accounts payable. This often reduces oper-
ating cash flows below income, which, in turn, reduces the ratio. When sales are declining, 
the opposite occurs, and the ratio increases.
 
2. Seasonality. Seasonal (from quarter to quarter) variations in sales and purchases of inven-
tory can cause the ratio to deviate from 1.0 during particular quarters.
 
3. Changes in revenue and expense recognition. Aggressive revenue recognition or failure to 
accrue appropriate expenses will inflate net income and reduce the ratio.
 
4. Changes in management of operating assets and liabilities. Inefficient management will 
increase operating assets and decrease liabilities, reducing operating cash flows and the quality 
of income ratio. More efficient management, such as shortening of payment terms, will have 
the opposite effect.
Focus Company Analysis During the past three years, National Beverage’s quality of income ratio 
has increased from 0.86 to 1.22. Its ratio is below those of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. National Beverage’s 
lower ratio would generally be judged negatively by analysts and would prompt them to read the manage-
ment’s discussion and analysis section of the annual report to determine its causes.
A Few Cautions The quality of income ratio can be interpreted based only on an understanding of the 
company’s business operations and strategy. For example, a low ratio for a quarter can be due simply to 
normal seasonal changes. However, it also can indicate obsolete inventory, slowing sales, or failed expan-
sion plans. To test for these possibilities, analysts often analyze this ratio in tandem with the accounts 
receivable turnover and inventory turnover ratios.

C HAP TER  1 2  Statement of Cash Flows
The cash flow statement often gives outsiders the first hint that financial statements may contain errors 
and irregularities. The importance of this indicator as a predictor is receiving more attention in the United 
States and internationally. Investors Chronicle reported on an accounting fraud at a commercial credit 
company, suggesting that
As noted in earlier chapters, unethical managers sometimes attempt to reach earnings targets by 
manipulating accruals and deferrals of revenues and expenses to inflate income. Since these adjusting 
entries do not affect the cash account, they have no effect on the cash flow statement. A growing differ-
ence between net income and cash flow from operations can be a sign of such manipulations. This early 
warning sign has signaled some famous bankruptcies, such as that of W. T. Grant in 1975. The company 
had inflated income by failing to make adequate accruals of expenses for uncollectible accounts receiv-
able and obsolete inventory. The more astute analysts noted the growing difference between net income 
and cash flow from operations and recommended selling the stock long before the bankruptcy.

Reporting Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Preparing this section of the cash flow statement requires an analysis of the accounts related 
to property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and investments in the securities of other 
companies. Normally, the relevant balance sheet accounts include Short-Term Investments and 
long-term asset accounts such as Long-Term Investments and Property, Plant, and Equipment. 
The following relationships are the ones that you will encounter most frequently:

In National Beverage’s case, the balance sheet (Exhibit 12.3) shows two investing assets 
(noted with an I) that have changed during the period: Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net, and 
Short-Term Investments. To determine the causes of these changes, accountants need to search 
the related company records.
Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net
Analysis of National Beverage Corp.’s records reveals that the company purchased new prop-
erty, plant, and equipment for $12,124 in cash, which is a cash outflow. The company also sold 
old equipment for $62 in cash, an amount equal to its net book value. This is a cash inflow. 
These investing items are listed in the schedule of investing activities in Exhibit 12.5. These 
items, less the amount of depreciation expense added back in the Operations section ($10,063), 
explain the increase in property, plant, and equipment, net, of $1,999.


INTERPRETATIONS
In General The capital acquisitions ratio reflects the portion of purchases of property, plant, and 
equipment financed from operating activities (without the need for outside debt or equity financing or 
the sale of other investments or fixed assets). A high ratio indicates less need for outside financ-
ing for current and future expansion. It benefits the company because it provides the company 
opportunities for strategic acquisitions, avoids the cost of additional debt, and reduces the risk of 
bankruptcy that comes with additional leverage (see Chapter 10).
Focus Company Analysis National Beverage’s capital acquisitions ratio has increased from 
3.81 to 4.39 in recent years. It generates more than sufficient cash to meet its investing needs. 
As a consequence, when credit markets tightened during the recent financial meltdown, National 
Beverage’s investment plans were unaffected. National Beverage has also maintained a ratio that is nearly 
as high or higher than its larger competitors, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.
A Few Cautions Since the needs for investment in plant and equipment differ dramatically across indus-
tries (for example, airlines versus pizza delivery restaurants), a particular firm’s ratio should be compared 
only with its prior years’ figures or with other firms in the same industry. Also, a high ratio may indicate a 
failure to update plant and equipment, which can limit a company’s ability to compete in the future.

Reporting Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Financing activities are associated with generating capital from creditors and owners. This 
section of the cash flow statement reflects changes in two current liabilities, Notes Payable 
to Financial Institutions (often called short-term debt) and Current Maturities of Long-Term 
Debt, as well as changes in long-term liabilities and stockholders’ equity accounts. These 
balance sheet accounts relate to the issuance and retirement of debt and stock and the pay-
ment of dividends. The following relationships are the ones that you will encounter most 
frequently:

Remember that:

 Cash repayments of principal are cash flows from financing activities.

 Interest payments are cash flows from operating activities. Since interest expense is 
reported on the income statement, the related cash flow is shown in the operating section.

 Dividend payments are cash flows from financing activities. Dividend payments are not 
reported on the income statement because they represent a distribution of income to owners. 
Therefore, they are shown in the financing section.

 If debt or stock is issued for other than cash, it is not included in this section.
To compute cash flows from financing activities, you should review changes in debt and 
stockholders’ equity accounts. In the case of National Beverage Corp., the analysis of changes 
in the balance sheet (Exhibit 12.3) finds that only long-term debt, common stock, and addi-
tional paid-in capital changed during the period (noted with an F).
Short- and Long-Term Debt
When there is additional borrowing or principal repayments on long-term debt owed to financial 
institutions and investors, those amounts are financing cash flows. The appropriate amounts are 
determined by analyzing the long-term debt account. For 2014, the company repaid $22,772 
LEARNING OBJECTIVE 12-6
Report and interpret cash flows 
from financing activities.
Any positive free cash flow is available for additional capital expenditures, investments in other com-
panies, and mergers and acquisitions without the need for external financing or reductions in dividends 
to shareholders. While free cash flow is considered a positive sign of financial flexibility, it also can 
represent a hidden cost to shareholders. Sometimes managers use free cash flow to pursue unprofitable 
investments just for the sake of growth or to obtain perquisites (such as fancy offices and corporate jets) 
that do not benefit the shareholders. In these cases, the shareholders would be better off if free cash flow 
were paid as additional dividends or used to repurchase the company’s stock on the open market.

Common Stock and Additional Paid-in Capital
National Beverage’s change in common stock and additional paid-in capital resulted from two 
decisions. National Beverage did not issue any outstanding stock during the year. But the com-
pany did repurchase common stock for $7,024 in cash, which is a financing cash ouflow.9 This 
accounts for the $7,024 decrease in common stock and additional paid-in capital. The amount 
is listed as an outflow in the schedule of financing activities in Exhibit 12.6.
Retained Earnings
Finally, retained earnings should be analyzed. Retained earnings rise when income is earned 
and fall when dividends are declared and paid. National Beverage earned $43,635 in income 
and paid $726 in dividends during 2014. National Beverage’s dividend payment is listed on the

Noncash Investing and Financing Activities
Certain transactions are important investing and financing activities but have no cash flow 
effects. These are called noncash investing and financing activities. For example, the pur-
chase of a $100,000 building with a $100,000 mortgage given by the former owner does not 
cause either an inflow or an outflow of cash. As a result, these noncash activities are not listed 
in the three main sections of the cash flow statement. However, supplemental disclosure of 
these transactions is required, in either narrative or schedule form. National Beverage’s state-
ment of cash flows does not list any noncash investing and financing activities.
Cash Paid for Interest and Income taxes
Companies that use the indirect method of presenting cash flows from operations also must 
provide two other figures: cash paid for interest and cash paid for income taxes.
Epilogue
Our more detailed analysis of National Beverage’s cash flow indicates the causes of the differ-
ence between net income and cash flows from operations. In fact, it was a normal consequence 
of depreciation and amortization as well as careful management of operating assets and liabili-
ties. Our further analysis of National Beverage’s investing and financing activities indicates 
that the cash needs to maintain its investment strategy should continue to be more than met by 
operations. Check the company’s latest quarterly reports to update this information.

Reporting Cash Flows from Operating Activities—Direct Method
The direct method presents a summary of all operating transactions that result in either a debit or a 
credit to cash. It is prepared by adjusting each item on the income statement from an accrual basis to 
a cash basis. We will complete this process for all of the revenues and expenses reported in National 
 
Beverage’s income statement in Exhibit 12.3 and accumulate them in a new schedule in Exhibit 12.8.
Converting Revenues to Cash Inflows
When sales are recorded, accounts receivable increase, and when cash is collected, accounts receivable 
decrease. Thus, the following formula will convert sales revenue amounts from the accrual basis to the 
cash basis:
Using information from National Beverage’s income statement and balance sheet presented in Exhibit 
12.3, we can compute cash collected from customers as follows:
Converting Cost of Goods Sold to Cash Paid to Suppliers
Cost of goods sold represents the cost of merchandise sold during the accounting period. It may be more 
or less than the amount of cash paid to suppliers during the period. In National Beverage’s case, inven-
tory increased during the year because the company bought more merchandise from suppliers than it sold

National Beverage reported positive profits and even higher cash flows from operations for the year. 
This difference between the two is caused primarily by decreases in prepaid expenses and deprecia-
tion. This also suggests that National Beverage is carefully managing its current assets and current 
liabilities so that it has more than sufficient cash on hand to cover the costs of purchases of additional 
equipment without the need to borrow additional funds. This cash can be used for future expansion or 
to pay future dividends to stockholders.

to customers. If the company paid cash to suppliers of inventory, it must have paid more cash to suppliers 
than the amount of cost of goods sold, so the increase in inventory must be added to compute cash paid 
to suppliers.
Typically, companies owe their suppliers money (an accounts payable balance will appear on the bal-
ance sheet). To convert cost of goods sold to cash paid to suppliers, the borrowing and repayments repre-
sented by the accounts payable must also be considered. Borrowing increases cash and accounts payable 
and repayment decreases cash and accounts payable, so National Beverage’s increase in accounts payable 
must also be subtracted in the computation. Cost of goods sold can therefore be converted to a cash basis 
in the following manner:
Using information from Exhibit 12.3, we can compute cash paid to suppliers as follows:
Converting Operating Expenses to a Cash Outflow
The total amount of an expense on the income statement may differ from the cash outflow associated with 
that activity. Some expenses are paid before they are recognized as expenses (e.g., prepaid rent). When 
prepayments are made, the balance in the asset prepaid expenses increases; when expenses are recorded, 
the balance in prepaid expenses decreases. When National Beverage’s prepaid expenses increased by 
$2,699 during the period, it paid more cash than it recorded as operating expenses. The increase must be 
added in computing cash paid for expenses.
Some other expenses are paid for after they are recognized (e.g., accrued expenses). In this case, when 
expenses are recorded, the balance in the liability accrued expenses increases; when payments are made, 
the balance in accrued expenses decreases. When National Beverage’s accrued expenses decreased by 
$259, it paid more cash than it recorded as operating expenses. The decrease must be added in computing 
cash paid for expenses.
Generally, other expenses can be converted from the accrual basis to the cash basis in the following 
manner:

Using information from Exhibit 12.3, we can compute cash paid for expenses for National Beverage 
 
as follows:
National Beverage also reports $1,326 of interest expense.10 Since there is no interest payable balance, 
we can see that interest expense must be equal to cash payments for interest expense.
Interest expense
$1,326
No changes in interest payable
 "" 0
Cash payments for interest
$1,326
The same logic can be applied to income taxes. National Beverage presents income tax expense of 
$19,474. Since there is no balance in Income Taxes Payable (or change in Deferred Taxes), income taxes 
paid must be the same as income tax expense.

These amounts of the operating cash inflows and outflows are accumulated in Exhibit 12.8.

Adjustment for Gains and Losses on Sale of Long-Term Assets—Indirect Method
As noted earlier, the Operating Activities section of the cash flow statement prepared using the indirect 
method may include an adjustment for gains and losses on the sale of long-term assets reported on the 
income statement. As discussed in Chapter 8, when property, plant, and equipment with an original cost 
of $10,000 and accumulated depreciation of $4,000 is sold for $8,000 cash, the following entry is made.

The $8,000 inflow of cash is an investing cash inflow, but the reported gain of $2,000 is also shown on 
the income statement. Because the gain is included in the computation of income, it is necessary to remove 
(subtract) the $2,000 gain from the Operating Activities section of the statement to avoid double counting.

Chapter Supplement C
T-Account Approach (Indirect Method)
When we began our discussion of preparing the statement of cash flows, we noted that changes in cash 
must equal the sum of the changes in all other balance sheet accounts. Based on this idea, we used the 
following three steps to prepare the statement of cash flows:
 
1. Determine the change in each balance sheet account. From this year’s ending balance, subtract this 
year’s beginning balance (i.e., last year’s ending balance).
 
2. Identify the cash flow category or categories to which each account relates.
 
3. Create schedules that summarize operating, investing, and financing cash flows.
Instead of creating separate schedules for each section of the statement, many accountants prefer to 
prepare a single large T-account to represent the changes that have taken place in cash subdivided into 
the three sections of the cash flow statement. Such an account is presented in Panel A of Exhibit 12.9. 
The cash account in Panel A shows increases in cash as debits and decreases in cash as credits. Note how

each section matches the three schedules that we prepared for National Beverage’s cash flows presented 
in Exhibits 12.4, 12.5, and 12.6. Panel B includes the same T-accounts for the noncash balance sheet 
accounts we used in our discussion of each cash flow statement section in the body of the chapter. Note 
how each change in the noncash balance sheet accounts has a number referencing the change in the cash 
account that it accompanies. The statement of cash flows presented in Exhibit 12.1 can be prepared in 
proper format based on the information in the cash flow T-account.

12-1. Classify cash flow statement items as part of net cash flows from operating, investing, and 
financing activities. p. 602
The cash flow statement has three main sections: Cash Flows from Operating Activities, which 
are  related to earning income from normal operations; Cash Flows from Investing Activities, 
which are related to the acquisition and sale of productive assets; and Cash Flows from Financing 
Activities, which are related to external financing of the enterprise. The net cash inflow or outflow 
for the year is the same amount as the increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the 
year on the balance sheet. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities 
of three months or less.
 
12-2. Report and interpret cash flows from operating activities using the indirect method.  p. 609 
The indirect method for reporting cash flows from operating activities reports a conversion of net 
income to net cash flow from operating activities. The conversion involves additions and subtrac-
tions for (1) noncurrent accruals, including expenses (such as depreciation expense) and revenues 
that do not affect current assets or current liabilities, and (2) changes in each of the individual 
current assets (other than cash and short-term investments) and current liabilities (other than short-
term debt to financial institutions and current maturities of long-term debt, which relate to financ-
ing), which reflect differences in the timing of accrual basis net income and cash flows.
12-3. Analyze and interpret the quality of income ratio. p. 615 
The quality of income ratio (Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Net Income) measures the 
portion of income that was generated in cash. A higher quality of income ratio indicates greater 
ability to finance operating and other cash needs from operating cash inflows. A higher ratio also 
indicates that it is less likely that the company is using aggressive revenue recognition policies to 
increase net income.
 
12-4. Report and interpret cash flows from investing activities. p. 616 
Investing activities reported on the cash flow statement include cash payments to acquire 
fixed assets, intangibles, and short- and long-term investments and cash proceeds from the sale 
of fixed assets, intangibles, and short- and long-term investments.
 
12-5. Analyze and interpret the capital acquisitions ratio. p. 618
The capital acquisitions ratio (Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Cash Paid for Property, 
Plant, and Equipment) reflects the portion of purchases of property, plant, and equipment financed 
from operating activities without the need for outside debt or equity financing or the sale of other 
investments or fixed assets. A high ratio benefits the company because it provides the company 
with opportunities for strategic acquisitions.
 
12-6. Report and interpret cash flows from financing activities. p. 619 
Cash inflows from financing activities include cash proceeds from the issuance of short- and 
 
long-term debt and common stock. Cash outflows include cash principal payments on short- 
and  long-term debt, cash paid for the repurchase of the company’s stock, and cash dividend 
 
payments. Cash payments associated with interest are a cash flow from operating activities.
 
12-7. Understand the format of the cash flow statement and additional cash flow disclosures.  
p. 621 
The statement of cash flows splits transactions that affect cash into three categories: Operating, 
Investing, and Financing Activities. The operating section is most often prepared using the indirect 
method that begins with Net Income and adjusts the amount to eliminate noncash transactions. 
Noncash investing and financing activities are investing and financing activities that do not involve 
cash. They include, for example, purchases of fixed assets with long-term debt or stock, exchanges 
of fixed assets, and exchanges of debt for stock. These transactions are disclosed only as supple-
mental disclosures to the cash flow statement along with cash paid for taxes and interest under the 
indirect method.
Throughout the preceding chapters, we emphasized the conceptual basis of accounting. An under-
standing of the rationale underlying accounting is important for both preparers and users of financial 
statements. In Chapter 13, we bring together our discussion of the major users of financial statements 
C H A P T E R  T A K E - A W A Y S

C HAP TER  1 2  Statement of Cash Flows
and how they analyze and use these statements. We discuss and illustrate many widely used analytical 
techniques discussed in earlier chapters, as well as additional techniques. As you study Chapter 13, you 
will see that an understanding of accounting rules and concepts is essential for effective analysis of 
financial statements.

Making a Decision as a Financial Analyst: Analyzing Cash Flow for a New Company
Carlyle Golf, Inc., was formed in September of last year. The company designs, contracts for the 
manufacture of, and markets a line of men’s golf apparel. A portion of the statement of cash flows for 
Carlyle follows:

Management expects a solid increase in sales in the near future. To support the increase in sales, it plans 
to add $2.2 million to inventory. The company did not disclose a sales forecast. At the end of the current 
year, Carlyle had less than $1,000 in cash. It is not unusual for a new company to experience a loss and 
negative cash flows during its start-up phase.
Required:
As a financial analyst recently hired by a major investment bank, you have been asked to write a short 
memo to your supervisor evaluating the problems facing Carlyle. Emphasize typical sources of financing 
that may or may not be available to support the expansion.
Critical Thinking Case
Ethical Decision Making: A Real-Life Example
In a February 19, 2004, press release, the Securities and Exchange Commission described a number of 
fraudulent transactions that Enron executives concocted in an effort to meet the company’s financial 
targets. One particularly well-known scheme is called the “Nigerian barge” transaction, which took place 
in the fourth quarter of 1999. According to court documents, Enron arranged to sell three electricity-
generating power barges moored off the coast of Nigeria. The “buyer” was the investment banking firm 
of Merrill Lynch. Although Enron reported this transaction as a sale in its income statement, it turns 
out this was no ordinary sale. Merrill Lynch didn’t really want the barges and had only agreed to buy 
them because Enron guaranteed, in a secret side deal, that it would arrange for the barges to be bought 
back from Merrill Lynch within six months of the initial transaction. In addition, Enron promised to pay 
Merrill Lynch a hefty fee for doing the deal. In an interview on National Public Radio on August 17, 
2002, Michigan Senator Carl Levin declared, “(T)he case of the Nigerian barge transaction was, by any 
definition, a loan.”
Required:
 1. Discuss whether the Nigerian barge transaction should have been considered a loan rather than a sale. 
As part of your discussion, consider the following questions. Doesn’t the Merrill Lynch  
payment to 
Enron at the time of the initial transaction automatically make it a sale, not a loan? What aspects of 
the transaction are similar to a loan? Which aspects suggest that the four criteria for  
revenue recogni-
tion (summarized near the end of Chapter 3) were not fulfilled?
 2. The income statement effect of recording the transaction as a sale rather than a loan is fairly clear: 
Enron was able to boost its revenues and net income. What is somewhat less obvious, but nearly as 
important, are the effects on the statement of cash flows. Describe how recording the transaction as 
a sale rather than as a loan would change the statement of cash flows.
 3. How would the two different statements of cash flows (described in your response to requirement 2) 
affect financial statement users?

Team Project: Analyzing Cash Flows
As a team, select an industry to analyze. Yahoo Finance provides lists of industries at biz.yahoo.com/p/
industries.html. Click on an industry for a list of companies in that industry. Alternatively, go to Google 
Finance at www.google.com/finance and search for a company you are interested in. You will be pre-
sented with a list including that company and its competitors. Each team member should acquire the 
annual report or 10-K for one publicly traded company in the industry, with each member selecting a dif-
ferent company (the SEC EDGAR service at www.sec.gov and the company’s investor relations website 
itself are good sources).
Required:
On an individual basis, each team member should write a short report answering the following questions 
about the selected company. Discuss any patterns across the companies that you as a team observe. Then, 
as a team, write a short report comparing and contrasting your companies.
 1. Which of the two basic reporting approaches for cash flows from operating activities did the com-
pany adopt?
 2. What is the quality of income ratio for the most current year? What were the major causes of differ-
ences between net income and cash flow from operations?
 3. What is the capital acquisitions ratio for the three-year period presented in total? How is the com-
pany financing its capital acquisitions?
 4. What portion of the cash from operations in the current year is being paid to stockholders in the form 
of dividends?

Analyzing Financial Statements
T
he history of The Home Depot is an unusual success story. Founded in 1978 in Atlanta, 
The Home Depot has grown to be America’s largest home improvement retailer, with 
over 2,200 stores in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Financial statements for 
The Home Depot are presented in Exhibit 13.1. As you can see, The Home Depot has grown 
both sales and net income over the last three years. As you analyze Exhibit 13.1 and read 
other disclosures in this chapter, it is helpful to keep in mind that “fiscal 2014” for The Home 
Depot ended on February 1, 2015. Similarly, “fiscal 2013” ended on February 2, 2014, and 
“fiscal 2012” ended on February 3, 2013.
With the recent improvement in the company’s financial results, would you want to invest 
in The Home Depot? A number of professional analysts think you should, including those 
who work for Jefferson Research, an investment research and advisory firm. In a report in 
which they recommended buying stock in The Home Depot, they wrote: “Home Depot, Inc., is 
showing strong Earnings Quality, Cash Flow Quality, Operating Efficiency and Balance Sheet 
Quality, and Valuation suggests a lower amount of price risk. When combined, Home Depot 
deserves a BUY rating.”


chapter 13
Professional analysts consider a large number of factors in developing the 
type of recommendation contained in the Jefferson Research report, including 
information reported in a company’s financial statements. In this chapter, we use 
accounting information and a variety of analytical tools to study The Home Depot 
and its major competitor, Lowe’s.

Companies spend billions of dollars each year preparing, auditing, and publish-
ing their financial statements. These statements are then made available to cur-
rent and prospective investors. Most companies no longer mail this information 
to investors, but rather make it available online. The Home Depot’s financial infor-
mation is available from its Investor Relations website at www.homedepot.com.
The reason that The Home Depot and other companies spend so much money 
to provide information to investors is simple: Financial statements help people 
make better economic decisions. In fact, published financial statements are 
designed primarily to meet the needs of external decision makers, including pres-
ent and potential owners, investment analysts, and creditors.

Of the people who use financial statements, investors are perhaps the single largest group. They 
often rely on the advice of professional analysts, who develop recommendations on widely held 
stocks such as The Home Depot. Investors who use analysts’ reports pay close attention to 
their recommendations. As this book was being written, professional analysts issued the fol-
lowing investment recommendations for The Home Depot:

Perhaps the most important thing to notice about this summary of investment recommenda-
tions is the degree of disagreement. Currently, 10 analysts strongly recommend buying more 
Home Depot stock, while 9 others recommend holding Home Depot stock only if one already 
owns it. This level of disagreement shows that financial analysis is part art and part science.
In considering an investment in stock, investors should evaluate the company’s future 
income and growth potential on the basis of three factors:
Economy-Wide Factors
Industry Factors
Company Factors
 
1. Economy-wide factors. Often the overall health of the economy has a direct impact on the 
performance of an individual company. Investors should consider data such as the unemploy-
ment rate, general inflation rate, and changes in interest rates. For example, in a research 
report issued by Zacks Investment Research, an analyst determined “Heavy job losses 
and reduced access to credit have led to a sharp fall in consumer discretionary spending on 
 
big-ticket items.” (Zacks Investment Research, September 1, 2014)
 
2. Industry factors. Certain events can have a major impact on each company within an indus-
try but only a minor impact on other companies outside the industry. For example, the Zacks 
report states, “In the home improvement retail business, Home Depot faces stiff competi-
tion from Lowe’s, Sherwin-Williams Company and other home supply retailers. . . .” The 
analyst report goes on to state, “This may weigh on the company’s results.” (Zacks Equity 
Research, March 19, 2012)
 
3. Individual company factors. To properly analyze a company, good analysts do not rely 
solely on the information reported in a company’s financial statements. They visit the com-
pany, buy its products, and read about it in the business press. If you are considering an 
investment in Home Depot, you should visit its stores and assess its product offerings in 
addition to analyzing its financial statements. An example of company-specific information 
is contained in the Zacks report, which states that “. . . the company has implemented sig-
nificant changes in its store operations to make them simpler and more customer-friendly.” 
(Zacks Equity Research, October 30, 2014)
Besides considering these factors, investors should understand a company’s business strat-
egy when evaluating its financial statements. A company’s business strategy directly affects the 
accounts you will see on its financial statements.
U ND E RSTAN DI N G  A C OMPAN Y ’S ST R AT E GY
Financial statement analysis involves more than just “crunching numbers.” Before you start 
looking at numbers, you should know what you are looking for. While financial statements 
reflect transactions, each of those transactions is the result of a company’s operating decisions 
as it implements its business strategy.

Businesses can earn a high rate of return by following different strategies. There are two 
fundamental strategies:
 
1. Product differentiation. Under this strategy, companies offer products with unique bene-
fits, such as high quality or unusual style or features. These unique benefits allow a company 
to charge higher prices. In general, a product differentiation strategy results in higher profit 
margins but lower inventory turnover.
 
2. Cost differentiation. Under this strategy, companies attempt to operate more efficiently than 
their competitors, which permits them to offer lower prices to attract customers. In general, 
a cost differentiation strategy results in lower profit margins but higher inventory turnover.
You can probably think of a number of companies that have followed one of these two basic 
strategies. Here are some examples:

Cost Differentiation

Kia

The best place to start financial analysis is with a solid understanding of a company’s busi-
ness strategy. To evaluate how well a company is doing, you must know what managers are 
trying to do. You can learn a great deal about a company’s business strategy by reading its 
annual report or 10-K, especially the letter from the president and management’s discussion 
and analysis (MD&A). It also is useful to read articles about the company in the business press.
The Home Depot’s business strategy is described in its 10-K report as follows:
Operating Strategy
Over the past several years, we have maintained a consistent strategic framework comprised of 
three key initiatives—Customer Service; Product Authority; and Disciplined Capital Allocation, 
Productivity and Efficiency—tied together through our Interconnected Retail initiative. In fiscal 
2014, we focused on continuing to enhance our capability to deliver a superior interconnected 
retail experience for our customers. As customers increasingly expect to be able to buy how, 
when and where they want, we believe that providing a seamless shopping experience across 
multiple channels, featuring innovative and expanded product choices, will be a key enabler for 
future success. Becoming a best-in-class interconnected retailer is growing in importance as the 
line between online and in-store shopping continues to blur. Our interconnected retail initiative 
supports and connects the three other key initiatives of our long-standing strategic framework, 
with the overall goal of strengthening the connectivity between our stores and our online 
channels and our connectivity with our customers.

With management’s stated goals in mind, we can attach more meaning to the information 
contained in The Home Depot’s financial statements.
FINA NCIAL STAT E M E N T  AN ALYSI S
Analyzing financial data without a basis for comparison is not informative. For example, would 
you be impressed with a company that earned $1 million last year? You are probably thinking, 
“It depends.” A $1 million profit might be very good for a company that lost money the year 
before but not good for a company that made $500 million the preceding year. It might be good 
for a small company but not for a very large company. And it might be considered good if all 
the other companies in the industry lost money the same year but not good if they all earned 
much larger profits.
As you can see from this simple example, financial results cannot be evaluated in isolation. 
To properly analyze the information reported in financial statements, you must develop appro-
priate comparisons. The task of finding appropriate comparisons requires judgment and is not 
always easy. Financial analysis is a sophisticated skill, not a mechanical process.
There are two general methods for making financial comparisons. The first compares a com-
pany to itself in prior years. The second compares a company to other companies at a point 
 
in time.
 
1. Comparing across time. In this type of analysis, which is often referred to as “time-series 
analysis,” information on a single company is compared over time. For example, a key mea-
sure of performance for most companies is the change in sales volume each year. The time-
series chart below shows that The Home Depot’s sales have been trending upward, though 
at different rates depending on the year. The notes to the financial statements help us under-
stand the improvement in sales in the current year:

The positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2014 reflect a number of factors, including the 
execution of our key initiatives, continued strength in our maintenance and repair categories, and 
an improved U.S. home improvement market. All of our departments posted positive comparable 
store sales for fiscal 2014. Further, our comparable store customer transactions increased 3.5% 
for fiscal 2014 and comparable store average ticket increased 1.8% for fiscal 2014, due in part 
to strong sales in big ticket purchases, such as appliances and water heaters, and sales growth in 
our services business.

In the current environment, The Home Depot is experiencing more customers in its stores 
and those customers are spending more money on their average purchases. Notice that our 
understanding of the reported numbers is directly tied to understanding The Home Depot’s 
business strategy.
 
2. Comparing across companies. In this type of analysis, which is often referred to as “cross-
sectional analysis,” information for multiple companies is compared at a point in time. We 
have seen that financial results are often affected by industry and economy-wide factors. By 
comparing a company with other companies in the same line of business, an analyst can gain 
better insight into its performance. For example, the graph below compares The Home Depot 
with one of its closest competitors, Lowe’s, during fiscal 2014. The gross profit percentage 
and growth in sales are essentially the same for both companies, but net income as a percent-
age of sales is higher for The Home Depot, indicating more efficient business operations.

Finding comparable companies is often difficult. Few companies do the exact same thing as 
their competitors. For example, American Apparel, Gap, Nordstrom, Target, and Walmart 
are all apparel retailers, but not all could be considered comparable companies for purposes of 
financial analysis. These retailers offer different levels of quality and appeal to different types 
of customers.
The federal government has developed the North American Industry Classification System 
(NAICS) for use in reporting economic data. The system assigns a specific industry code to 
each corporation based on its business operations. Analysts often use these six-digit codes 
to identify companies that have similar business operations. In addition, you can find mul-
tiple online resources, such as Google Finance or Yahoo Finance, that provide averages for 
many common accounting ratios for various industries. Because of the diversity of companies 
included in any given industry classification, and the potential difference in how ratios are 
calculated, these data should be used with great care. For this reason, some analysts prefer to 
compare two companies that are very similar instead of using industry-wide comparisons.

Component Percentages
All analysts use various tools to analyze a company’s financial statements. Two popular tools 
are component percentages and ratio analysis. Component percentages express each item on 
a financial statement as a percentage of a single base amount. The base amount on the income 
statement is net sales. To compute component percentages on the income statement, each 
amount reported is divided by net sales. The base amount on the balance sheet is total assets. To 
compute component percentages on the balance sheet, each amount is divided by total assets.
Exhibit 13.2 shows a component percentage analysis for The Home Depot’s income state-
ment. The percentages reported in Exhibit 13.2 were calculated by taking the dollar amounts 
reported on The Home Depot’s income statement shown in Exhibit 13.1 and dividing them 
by net sales. If you simply reviewed the dollar amounts on the income statement, you might 
miss important insights. For example, selling, general, and administrative expense increased 
by $237 million in fiscal 2014. This increase might seem to reflect a decline in operating effi-
ciency until it is compared with sales productivity. A component percentage analysis provides 
an important insight: This expense category decreased as a percent of sales (from 21.06% in

fiscal 2013 to 20.24% in fiscal 2014) during that period. In other words, The Home Depot has 
actually done a good job of keeping selling, general, and administrative expense in line with its 
sales activity.
The component analysis (in Exhibit 13.2) also reflects that net income has increased as a 
percentage of sales from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2014. In general, this reflects that The Home 
Depot is operating more efficiently across time. You can see this improvement in operating 
efficiency by examining the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales over the 
three-year period.
Many analysts use graphics software to help them analyze companies. Graphic representa-
tion is especially useful when communicating findings during meetings or in printed form. The 
nearby pie charts summarize key 2014 data from Exhibit 13.2, along with comparable data 
from Lowe’s, a key competitor.
Ratio Analysis
Component percentages are a type of ratio. Ratios simply express the proportionate relation-
ship between two amounts. With component percentages, both the numerator and the denomi-
nator of the ratio came from the same financial statement, either the income statement or the 
balance sheet. This does not have to be the case. As an example, assume you want to know how 
effective a company is using its assets to generate net income. Answering this question is dif-
ficult if you only know that the company earned net income of $500,000. Comparing income 
to total assets provides additional insights. If total assets are $5 million, for example, then the 
relationship of earnings to assets is $500,000 ÷ $5,000,000 = 10%. This measure indicates a 
different level of performance than would be the case if total assets were $250 million. Ratio 
analysis helps decision makers identify significant relationships and make meaningful com-
parisons between companies.

Of the many ratios that can be computed using a company’s financial statements, analysts 
use only those that can be helpful in a given situation. Comparing cost of goods sold to 
property, plant, and equipment is not meaningful because these items have no natural rela-
tionship. Instead, an analyst will often compute certain widely used ratios and then decide 
which additional ratios could be relevant to a particular decision. Research and develop-
ment costs as a percentage of sales is not a meaningful ratio for some companies, for exam-
ple, but it is useful when analyzing companies that depend on new products, such as a 
 
pharmaceutical company.
When you compute ratios, remember a basic fact about financial statements: Balance sheet 
amounts are as of a specific point in time while income statement amounts relate to a period of 
time. In comparing an income statement amount to a balance sheet amount, you should express 
the balance sheet as an average of the beginning and ending balances. In practice, some ana-
lysts simply use the ending balance sheet amount, an approach that is appropriate only if there 
is not a significant difference between the beginning and ending balances. For consistency, we 
always use average amounts.
Financial statement analysis involves a lot of judgment; not all ratios are helpful in a 
given situation. We will discuss several ratios that are appropriate to most situations. They can 
 
be grouped into the categories shown in Exhibit 13.3.1
Profitability Ratios
Profitability is a primary measure of the overall success of a company. Profitability ratios 
focus on net income and how it compares to other amounts reported on the financial state-
ments. Return on equity is a widely used measure of profitability.
1. Return on Equity (ROE)
Return on equity relates income earned to the investment made by a company’s owners. This 
ratio reflects the simple fact that investors expect to earn a return on the money they invest in a 
company. The return on equity ratio is computed as follows:
The Home Depot earned 58.09 percent on the owners’ investment. Another way to interpret 
this number is to say that, on average, for every $1.00 equity investors contributed to The Home 
Depot, the company earned 58 cents in fiscal 2014. Was this return good or bad? To answer 
this question, we need to compare 58.09 percent to what The Home Depot’s ROE was in prior 
years, or to its competitors’ ROE in 2014. ROE for Lowe’s was 24.73 percent in fiscal 2014. 
Clearly, The Home Depot produced a better return than its main competitor.
We can gain additional insight by examining The Home Depot’s ROE from fiscal 2012 to 
fiscal 2014:

2. Return on Assets (ROA)
Another test of profitability compares income to the total assets used to generate the income. 
Return on assets is computed as follows:
This implies that, on average, for every $1.00 of assets reported on The Home Depot’s bal-
ance sheet, the company earned 16 cents in fiscal 2014. The ROA for Lowe’s was 8.36 percent, 
considerably lower than the ROA for The Home Depot. This comparison indicates that The 
Home Depot is utilizing its assets more effectively than Lowe’s.
Some analysts modify the basic ROA computation listed above by adding interest expense 
(net of tax) to the numerator of the ratio. The logic for making this adjustment is that the 
denominator of the ratio includes resources (assets) provided by both owners and creditors, 
so the numerator should include the return that was available to both groups. Interest expense 
is therefore added back because it was previously deducted in the computation of net income. 
Note, too, that when making this adjustment, interest expense is measured net of income tax. 
The net of tax amount is used because interest is deductible for tax purposes, so we need to 
adjust interest expense for the tax savings associated with using debt.
3. Financial Leverage Percentage
Financial leverage percentage measures the advantage or disadvantage that occurs when a com-
pany’s return on equity differs from its return on assets. This percentage is computed by sub-
tracting ROA from ROE. The financial leverage percentage is positive when a company earns 
a return on its debt that exceeds the interest rate it pays on the debt. Most companies have posi-
tive leverage, though if they borrow money and make poor investments it is possible to have 
negative leverage.
Financial leverage percentage is computed as follows:
Financial Leverage Percentage = Return on Equity – Return on Assets
Home Depot 2014 = 58.09% ++– 15.77% = 42.32%
The Home Depot’s financial leverage percentage indicates that it earned a considerably 
higher return on borrowed funds than it paid to borrow those funds. Note that a  
company’s 
financial leverage percentage can be enhanced either by investing effectively (i.e., earning a 
high return on investment) or by borrowing effectively (i.e., paying a low rate of interest).
Lowe’s financial leverage percentage (16.37 percent) is lower than The Home Depot’s. This 
is not surprising because Lowe’s ROE and ROA are lower than The Home Depot’s.
4. Net Profit Margin
The net profit margin reflects net income as a percent of sales. It is computed as follows:
Return on Assets (ROA) = 
Net Income
Average Total Assets
Home Depot 2014 = $6,345
$40,232* = 15.77%
*($39,946 + $40,518)
2
= $40,232
Net Profit Margin = 
Net Income
Net Sales Revenue
Home Depot 2014 = $6,345
$83,176 = 7.63%


672
C HAP TER  1 3  Analyzing Financial Statements
For fiscal 2014, each dollar of The Home Depot’s sales generated just under 8 cents of 
profit. In comparison, Lowe’s earned just under 5 cents for each dollar of sales. These numbers 
reflect that for each dollar of sales, The Home Depot is subtracting approximately 92 cents in 
expenses while Lowe’s is subtracting approximately 95 cents.
While profit margin is a good measure of operating efficiency, you should be careful not 
to analyze it in isolation because it does not consider the resources needed to earn income. It 
is very difficult to compare profit margins for companies in different industries. For example, 
profit margins are low in the food industry while profit margins in the jewelry industry are 
high. Both types of business can be quite profitable, however, because a high sales volume can 
compensate for a low profit margin. Grocery stores have low profit margins, but they generate 
a high sales volume from their relatively inexpensive stores and inventory. Although jewelry 
stores earn comparatively more profit from each sales dollar, they require a large investment in 
luxury stores and very expensive inventory.
The trade-off between profit margin and sales volume can be stated in simple terms: Would 
you prefer to have 5 percent of $1,000,000 or 10 percent of $100,000? As you can see, a larger 
profit margin is not always better in terms of total dollars earned.
5. Earnings per Share (EPS)
The earnings per share ratio is a measure of return on investment that is based on the number of 
common shares outstanding. EPS is computed as follows:
You can obtain the weighted average number of shares outstanding from the bottom of a 
company’s income statement (see Exhibit 13.1). Earnings per share is probably the single most 
widely reported ratio, and it is the only ratio required by GAAP. Analysts develop their own 
estimates of EPS and the stock price of a company may change significantly if the actual EPS 
differs from the estimate.
6. Earnings Quality
Most financial analysts are concerned about the quality of a company’s earnings because some 
accounting procedures can be used to report higher income. For example, a company that uses 
LIFO and short estimated lives for depreciable assets will report lower earnings than an identi-
cal company that uses FIFO and longer estimated lives. One method of evaluating the quality 
of a company’s earnings is to compare its reported earnings to its cash flows from operating 
activities, as follows:
A general rule of thumb is that an earnings quality ratio that is higher than 1 is considered 
to indicate high-quality earnings because each dollar of income is supported by one or more 
dollars of cash flows. A ratio that is below 1 represents lower-quality earnings.
Earnings per Share (EPS) = 
Net Income
Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding
Home Depot 2014 = $6,345
1,338 = $4.74 per share

Earnings quality has long been analyzed and used by investors as a measure of the 
fundamental quality of the company and its future prospects. Companies may be including 
certain items that increase reported earnings and often the amount of cash flow supporting 
the earnings may be weak. Jefferson adjusts for these kinds of items and other anomalies 
to produce an adjusted earnings number that more accurately reflects ongoing business 
fundamentals at Home Depot. Reported earnings are compared to the Jefferson adjusted 
earnings as a means to gauge earnings quality. Also measured is the amount of cash flow that 
underpins earnings.

Asset Turnover Ratios
Asset turnover ratios focus on capturing how efficiently a company uses its assets. For exam-
ple, acquiring and selling inventory is a key activity for many companies. The inventory turn-
over ratio helps analysts evaluate a company’s ability to sell its inventory. Another example is 
the receivable turnover ratio, which helps analysts evaluate a company’s ability to collect its 
receivables. These and other asset turnover ratios are discussed below.

7. Total Asset Turnover Ratio
The total asset turnover ratio captures how well a company uses its assets to generate revenue. 
The ratio is computed as follows:
A total asset turnover ratio of 2.07 implies that, on average, each dollar of assets on The 
Home Depot’s balance sheet generates $2.07 of revenue. Lowe’s total asset turnover ratio is 
1.74. Comparing the two indicates that The Home Depot is more efficient than Lowe’s at using 
its assets to generate revenue. As the table below indicates, The Home Depot has also improved 
its total asset turnover ratio from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2014.

8. Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio
Whereas the total asset turnover ratio captures how well a firm uses all of its assets to generate 
revenues, the fixed asset turnover ratio focuses more narrowly on how well a company uses its 
fixed assets to generate revenues. The term fixed assets is synonymous with property, plant, 
and equipment. The ratio is computed as follows:
Lowe’s fiscal 2014 fixed asset turnover ratio is 2.75. Once again, The Home Depot’s ratio 
is higher, indicating it is more efficient at using its fixed assets to generate revenues. For each 
dollar The Home Depot invested in property, plant, and equipment, the company was able to 
generate $3.61 in sales revenue, while Lowe’s could generate only $2.75.
9. Receivable Turnover Ratio
Being able to efficiently collect accounts receivable is critical to a company. Analysts know 
this and therefore keep close watch on a company’s receivable turnover ratio. The receivable 
turnover ratio is computed as follows:
*If credit sales are not reported separately (which is typically  
the case), use total net sales as an approximation.
A high receivable turnover ratio suggests that a company collects its accounts receivable 
many times during a year. The Home Depot, on average, collects its accounts receivable over 
57 times a year. Granting credit to customers with poor credit and ineffective collection efforts

will produce a low receivable turnover ratio. While a very low ratio is obviously a problem, 
a very high ratio also can be troublesome because it suggests an overly stringent credit policy 
that could cause lost sales and profits.
The receivable turnover ratio is often converted to a time basis known as the average days to 
collect. The computation is as follows:
The Home Depot’s average days to collect ratio implies that it takes the com-
pany an average of just over 6 days to collect its accounts receivable. Although 
the receivable turnover ratio normally provides useful insights, the one for The 
Home Depot is not meaningful. It is highly unlikely that The Home Depot col-
lects cash from its credit customers in just 6 days. Because we did not know the 
amount of The Home Depot’s credit sales, we used total sales as an approxima-
tion. In this case, the approximation is not reasonable. Most customers use a bank 
credit card such as MasterCard or Visa. From The Home Depot’s perspective, a 
sales transaction involving a bank credit card is recorded as a cash sale because 
the credit card company quickly transfers cash to The Home Depot and then 
takes on the responsibility of collecting from the customer. As a result, many of 
The Home Depot’s sales are actually cash sales, invalidating the assumption that 
total sales are a reasonable proxy for credit sales. This situation illustrates that 
ratio analysis involves more than the mere computation of numbers. Analysts 
must evaluate the results based on their understanding of the business.
10. Inventory Turnover Ratio
Like the receivable turnover ratio, the inventory turnover ratio is a measure of operating effi-
ciency. It is computed as follows:
Because a company normally realizes profit each time inventory is sold, an increase in this 
ratio is usually favorable. If the ratio is too high, however, it may be an indication that sales 
were lost because desired items were not in stock. A company must balance the cost of holding 
inventory with the potential cost of losing a sale.
On average, The Home Depot’s inventory was acquired and sold to customers 4.9 times 
during the year. The inventory turnover ratio is critical for The Home Depot because of its 
business strategy. It wants to be able to offer customers the right product when they need it at 
a price that beats the competition. Inventory turnover for Lowe’s was 4.07. Historically, The 
Home Depot has enjoyed an advantage over Lowe’s in terms of inventory management. The 
Home Depot’s effectiveness in inventory management means that the company is able to tie up 
less money in carrying inventory compared to Lowe’s.
Turnover ratios vary significantly from one industry to the next. Companies in the food 
industry (grocery stores and restaurants) have high inventory turnover ratios because their 
inventory is subject to rapid deterioration. Companies that sell expensive merchandise (auto-
mobiles and high-fashion clothes) have much lower ratios because although sales of those 
items are infrequent, customers want to have a selection to choose from when they do buy.

Like the receivable turnover ratio, the inventory turnover ratio is often converted to a time 
basis. The computation is:
Using Ratios to Analyze the Operating Cycle In Chapter 3, we introduced the concept of a 
company’s operating cycle, which is the time it takes for a company to pay cash to its suppliers, 
sell goods to its customers, and collect cash from its customers. Analysts are interested in the 
operating cycle because it helps them evaluate a company’s cash needs and is a good indicator 
of operating efficiency.
The operating cycle for most companies involves three distinct phases: the acquisition of 
inventory, the sale of the inventory, and the collection of cash from the customer. We have dis-
cussed several ratios that are helpful when evaluating a company’s operating cycle:
Ratio*
Operating Activity
Accounts payable turnover ratio
Purchase of inventory
Inventory turnover ratio
Sale of inventory
Receivable turnover ratio
Collection of cash from customers
*We discussed the accounts payable turnover ratio in Chapter 9. The 
inventory turnover ratio and the receivable turnover ratio are discussed 
in this chapter.
Each of the ratios measures the number of days it takes, on average, to complete an operat-
ing activity. We have already computed two of the needed ratios for The Home Depot, so if we 
compute the accounts payable turnover ratio, we can analyze the company’s operating cycle:
The number of days it takes The Home Depot to complete each phase of its operating cycle are:
Ratio
Time
Average days to pay payables
39.04 days
Average days to sell inventory
74.49 days
Average days to collect receivables
6.32 days
Examining each phase of the operating cycle helps us understand the cash needs of the 
company. The Home Depot, on average, pays for its inventory 39 days after it receives it. It 
takes, on average, 81 days (74.49 + 6.32) for it to sell its inventory and collect cash from its 
customers. Therefore, The Home Depot must invest cash in its operating activities for just over 
42 days (81 days − 39 days) between the time it pays its vendors and the time it collects from 
its customers. Companies prefer to minimize the time between paying vendors and collecting 
cash from customers because it frees up cash for other productive purposes. The Home Depot 
could reduce this time by slowing payments to creditors or by increasing how quickly it turns 
over its inventory.

The DuPont Model

ratios are related. The model is:

In mathematical terms, canceling out like items on the right side of the above equation shows that the 
left and right sides are equivalent. Examining the additional information on the right side of the DuPont 
model allows an analyst to tell a much richer story about a company’s profitability than can be told by 
examining just ROE. For example, a company can increase its ROE by increasing its net profit margin or 
by increasing the revenue it generates from its asset base (its total asset turnover). A company can also 
leverage up its return to stockholders by borrowing funds and investing them in such a way that the return 
exceeds the cost of borrowing. This leverage effect is captured by the financial leverage ratio.
The DuPont model is a useful way to analyze a company’s performance. Understanding it will also 
help you start to make connections between other ratios. For example, multiplying just the net profit mar-
gin and the total asset turnover ratio creates a company’s ROA ratio.

Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity refers to a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations. Because most short-
term obligations will be paid with current assets, liquidity ratios focus on the relationship 
between current assets and current liabilities. The ability to pay current liabilities is an important 
factor in evaluating a company’s short-term financial strength. In this section, we discuss three 
ratios that are used to measure liquidity: the current ratio, the quick ratio, and the cash ratio.
11. Current Ratio
The current ratio measures to what extent a company’s total current assets cover its total  
current 
liabilities on a specific date. It is computed as follows:
A ratio greater than 1 implies that a company’s current assets are sufficient to cover its cur-
rent liabilities. If a company’s current ratio is less than 1, analysts will want to understand how 
the company intends to meet its short-term obligations. At the end of fiscal 2014, The Home 
Depot had $1.36 in current assets for each $1.00 in current liabilities. Most analysts would 
judge that ratio to be quite strong.
To properly use the current ratio, analysts must understand the nature of a company’s busi-
ness. Many manufacturing companies have developed sophisticated systems to minimize the 
amount of inventory they must hold. These systems, called just-in-time inventory, are designed 
to have an inventory item arrive just when it is needed. While these systems work well in manu-
facturing processes, they do not work as well in retailing. Customers expect to find merchan-
dise in the store when they want it, and it has proven difficult to precisely forecast consumer 
behavior. As a result, most retailers have comparatively high current ratios because they must

carry large inventories. The Home Depot, for example, maintains an inventory of 40,000 differ-
ent products in a typical store.
The optimal level of the current ratio depends on the business environment in which a 
company operates. If cash flows are predictable and stable, the current ratio can be low, 
even less than 1. For example, Procter & Gamble, a strong and fiscally conservative com-
pany, has a current ratio of 0.94. When cash flows are highly variable, a higher current ratio 
is desirable.
Analysts become concerned if a company’s current ratio is high compared to that of other 
companies in its industry. A firm is operating inefficiently when it ties up too much money in 
inventory or accounts receivable. It is also important to keep in mind that current assets other 
than cash need to be converted to cash before they can be used to satisfy current obligations.
12. Quick Ratio
The quick ratio, sometimes referred to as the acid test, is a more stringent test of short-term 
liquidity than is the current ratio. The quick ratio compares quick assets, defined as cash and 
near-cash assets, to current liabilities. Quick assets include cash, net accounts receivable, and 
marketable securities. Inventory is omitted from quick assets because of the uncertainty of the 
timing of cash flows from its sale. Prepaid expenses are also excluded from quick assets. The 
quick ratio is computed as follows:
The quick ratio is a measure of whether the highly liquid assets of a company, those that 
can be converted to cash quickly, are sufficient to cover current liabilities. The Home Depot 
has 28 cents in cash and near-cash assets for every $1.00 in current liabilities. This margin of 
safety is typical of the retail industry and would be considered a good margin in light of the 
large amount of cash The Home Depot generates from its operating activities ($8.2 billion). In 
comparison, the quick ratio for Lowe’s is significantly lower (0.06).
13. Cash Ratio
Cash is the lifeblood of a business. Without cash, a company cannot pay its employees or meet 
its obligations to creditors. Even a profitable business will fail without sufficient cash. One 
measure of the adequacy of available cash, called the cash ratio, is computed as follows:
In fiscal 2014, Lowe’s cash ratio was 0.05, which was considerably lower than The Home 
Depot’s cash ratio of 0.15. The Home Depot’s cash ratio indicates that the company has on 
hand 15 cents of cash for each $1.00 of current liabilities. Would analysts be concerned about 
this number? Not likely. It is important to keep in mind that not all of The Home Depot’s cur-
rent liabilities need to be paid immediately. It therefore does not need to keep enough cash on 
hand at any point in time to cover all of its short-term obligations. Looking at the bigger pic-
ture, the Home Depot’s statement of cash flows shows that the company generated $8.2 billion 
in cash from its operating activities. As a result, it is highly likely that The Home Depot will 
have sufficient cash on hand when the time comes to meet any given current liability. Many 
analysts believe the cash ratio should not be too high because holding excess cash is usually 
uneconomical. It is far better to invest the cash in productive assets or reduce debt.

Solvency Ratios
Solvency refers to a company’s ability to meet its long-term obligations. Solvency ratios mea-
sure this ability and include the times interest earned, cash coverage, and debt-to-equity ratios.
14. Times Interest Earned Ratio
Interest payments are a fixed obligation. If a company fails to make required interest payments, 
creditors may force it into bankruptcy. Because of the importance of meeting interest pay-
ments, analysts often compute a ratio called times interest earned:
The times interest earned ratio compares the income available to pay interest in a period to 
a company’s interest obligation for the same period. Interest expense and income tax expense 
are added back in the numerator because these amounts are available to pay interest. The times 
interest earned ratio represents a margin of protection for creditors. In fiscal 2014, The Home 
Depot generated $13.02 in income for each $1.00 of interest expense, a high ratio that indicates 
a secure position for creditors.
Some analysts believe that the times interest earned ratio is flawed because interest expense 
is paid in cash, not with net income. These analysts prefer to use the cash coverage ratio.
15. Cash Coverage Ratio
Given the importance of having enough cash on hand to make required interest payments, it is 
easy to understand why many analysts use the cash coverage ratio. It is computed as follows:

The Home Depot’s cash coverage ratio shows that the company generated $10.54 in cash 
for every $1.00 of interest paid, which is strong coverage. Some analysts modify the basic cash 
coverage ratio by adding back to the numerator interest paid and income taxes paid. These 
amounts are typically disclosed separately at the bottom of a company’s statement of cash 
flows, as they are for The Home Depot in Exhibit 13.1.
16. Debt-to-Equity Ratio
The debt-to-equity ratio expresses a company’s debt as a proportion of its stockholders’ equity. 
It is computed as follows:
In fiscal 2014, for each $1.00 of stockholders’ equity, The Home Depot had $3.29 of liabili-
ties. By comparison, Lowe’s debt-to-equity ratio was 2.19.
Debt is risky for a company because specific interest payments must be made even if the 
company has not earned sufficient income to pay them. In contrast, dividends are always at the 
company’s discretion and are not legally enforceable until they are declared by the board of 
directors. Thus, equity capital is associated with fewer contractual payments than is debt.
Despite the risk associated with debt, however, most companies obtain significant amounts 
of resources from creditors because of the advantages of financial leverage discussed earlier. 
In addition, interest expense is a deductible expense on a company’s income tax return. Weigh-
ing these benefits against the contractual obligations that accompany debt results in companies 
using a mix of debt and equity financing. Analysts evaluate this mix by computing the debt-to-
equity ratio.
Market Ratios
Several ratios, often called market ratios, relate the current price per share of a company’s 
stock to the return that accrues to stockholders. Analysts find these ratios helpful because they 
are based on the current value of an owner’s investment in a company.
17. Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio
The price/earnings (P/E) ratio measures the relationship between the current market price of a 
company’s stock and its earnings per share. At the end of fiscal 2014, The Home Depot’s stock 
was trading at $104.43 per share. EPS for fiscal 2014 was $4.74. With this information, we can 
compute The Home Depot’s P/E ratio as follows:
This P/E ratio indicates that The Home Depot’s stock was selling at a price that was just over 
22 times its earnings per share. The P/E ratio reflects the stock market’s assessment of a com-
pany’s future performance. A high ratio indicates that earnings are expected to grow rapidly. 
Lowe’s P/E ratio is 25.00. The P/E ratios for The Home Depot and Lowe’s indicate that the 
market expects them to perform well in the future.
In economic terms, the value of a stock is determined by calculating the present value of the 
company’s future earnings. Thus, a company that expects to increase its earnings in the future 
is worth more than one that cannot grow its earnings (assuming other factors are the same). 
However, while a high P/E ratio and good growth prospects are considered favorable, there are

risks. When a company with a high P/E ratio does not meet the level of earnings expected by 
the market, the negative impact on its stock can be dramatic.
18. Dividend Yield Ratio
When investors buy stock, they can earn a return on their investment through dividends or 
price appreciation. The dividend yield ratio reflects the return on investment absent any capital 
appreciation, or, said differently, the return attributed solely to the dividends a company pays. 
Not all companies report the cash dividend they paid per share on their income statement or 
statement of cash flows, so you may need to search their 10-K to find the information. The 
Home Depot paid dividends of $1.16 per share in fiscal 2014. At the end of fiscal 2014 its stock 
price was $104.43 per share. Its dividend yield ratio is computed as follows:
In recent years, the dividend yield for The Home Depot has been less than 2 percent. The 
dividend yield for most stocks is not high compared to alternative investments. Investors are 
willing to accept low dividend yields if they expect that the price of a stock will increase while 
they own it. Investors who bought The Home Depot stock did so knowing they would receive 
a dividend, but they also were expecting its stock price to increase. In contrast, stocks with low 
growth potential tend to offer much higher dividend yields than do stocks with high growth 
potential. Stocks with high dividend yields often appeal to retired investors who need current 
income rather than future growth potential.
The dividend yield for Lowe’s is similar to that for The Home Depot, 1.28 percent in fiscal 
2014. The nearby chart shows average dividend yields for several different industries.

Except for earnings per share, the computation of financial ratios has not been standardized by 
the accounting profession. Thus, analysts must decide which ratios to use and how to compute 
them based on their decision objective. When using ratios computed by others, analysts are 
careful to note how each ratio is computed.
As we have seen, ratios can be interpreted only by comparing them to other ratios or a 
benchmark value. Some ratios, by their very nature, are unfavorable at either very high or very 
low values. For example, a very low current ratio may indicate an inability to meet short-term 
obligations, while a very high current ratio may indicate excessive current assets. Furthermore, 
an optimal ratio for one company may not be optimal for another. Comparing ratios for two 
firms is appropriate only if the companies are comparable in terms of their industry, operations, 
and accounting policies.
Because ratios are based on the aggregation of information, they may obscure underlying 
factors that are of interest to the analyst. For example, a current ratio that is considered optimal 
can obscure a short-term liquidity problem in a company with a large amount of inventory but a 
minimal amount of cash with which to meet short-term obligations. Examining multiple ratios, 
like the quick ratio and cash ratio in conjunction with the current ratio, can uncover this type 
of problem.
In other cases, analysis cannot uncover obscured problems. For example, consolidated state-
ments include financial information about a parent company and its subsidiaries. The parent 
company could have a low current ratio and the subsidiary a high one, but when their state-
ments are consolidated, their current ratios are in effect averaged and can fall within an accept-
able range. The fact that the parent company could have a serious liquidity problem is obscured.
A company’s accounting policy choices will influence its ratios. This is important because 
different companies rarely use exactly the same accounting policies. For example, two com-
panies that purchase the exact same asset will report different net income amounts if one uses 
accelerated deprecation while the other uses straight-line depreciation. These different amounts 
will influence any ratios that include net income. Analysts who do not understand how a compa-
ny’s accounting choices influence its ratios could draw inappropriate conclusions. It is therefore 
critical that analysts understand a company’s accounting policies before interpreting its ratios. 
A company’s accounting policies are described in the footnotes to its financial statements.
Other Financial Information
Understanding the broader economic environment in which a company operates is important 
when interpreting its ratios. Some things that analysts commonly consider are:
 
1. Rapid growth. Growth in total sales does not always indicate that a company is successful. 
Total sales can increase as a result of a company selling more at its existing stores, or it can 
increase as a result of a company opening new stores. Growth driven by new-store sales 
might obscure the fact that existing stores are not meeting customer needs and are experi-
encing declining sales. To help analysts sort out what is driving sales growth, companies 
often report a figure called “comparable store sales growth.” This figure captures the growth 
in sales for stores that have been in existence for some period of time, typically 13 months or 
more. The Home Depot discusses comparable store sales growth in its 2014 10-K:
Net Sales increased 5.5% to $83.2 billion for fiscal 2014 from $78.8 billion for fiscal 2013. 
Our total comparable store sales increased 5.3% in fiscal 2014, driven by a 3.5% increase 
in our comparable store customer transactions and a 1.8% increase in our comparable store 
average ticket.

2. Uneconomical expansion. In the pursuit of growth, some companies will open stores in 
less desirable locations. These poor locations can cause a company’s average productivity to 
decline. One measure of productivity in the retail industry is sales volume per square foot of 
selling space. The Home Depot reports sales volume per square foot in its 10-K report:
Year
Sales per Square Foot
2014
$352
2013
334
2012
319
2011
299
2010
289
As the table shows, sales per square foot has grown each of the last five years, a good sign 
that The Home Depot is not opening stores in undesirable locations.
 
3. Subjective factors. Remember that analyzing a company involves much more than simply 
analyzing its financial statements and ratios. To get a sense for how a company is imple-
menting its strategy, analysts will often visit individual stores and perhaps talk to customers 
and suppliers. Information obtained during these visits helps analysts better understand how 
a company’s strategy is actually being implemented in its stores. With this understanding, 
analysts are better able to interpret a company’s current financial information as well as 
make more informed predictions about future performance.
Insider Information
A  Q U E ST I O N  
O F  E T H I C S
A company’s accountants often are aware of important financial information before it is made available 
to the public. This is called insider information. Some people might be tempted to buy or sell stock based 
on insider information, but to do so is a serious criminal offense. The Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion has brought a number of cases against individuals who traded on insider information. Their convic-
tions resulted in large fines and time served in jail.
In some cases, determining whether something is insider information is difficult. For example, an 
individual could overhear a comment made in the company elevator by two executives. Is this insider 
information? A well-respected Wall Street investment banker offers good advice on dealing with such 
situations: “If you are not sure if something is right or wrong, apply the newspaper headline test. Ask 
yourself how you would feel to have your family and friends read about what you had done in the news-
paper.” Interestingly, many people who have spent time in jail and lost small fortunes in fines because of 
insider trading say that the most difficult part of the process was telling their families.
To uphold the highest ethical standard, many public accounting firms have adopted rules that prevent 
their staff from investing in companies that they audit. Such rules are designed to ensure that a company’s 
auditors will not be tempted to engage in insider trading.

statements can be used for either time-series analysis (comparing a single company over time) or 
cross-sectional analysis (comparing similar companies at a point in time).
 
13-3. Compute and interpret component percentages. p. 667
Component percentages express each item on a financial statement as a percentage of a single base 
amount. The base amount on the income statement is net sales. To compute component percentages 
on the income statement, each amount reported is divided by net sales. The base amount on the 
balance sheet is total assets. To compute component percentages on the balance sheet, each amount 
is divided by total assets. Component percentages are evaluated by comparing them over time for 
a single company or by comparing them with percentages for similar companies at a point in time.

Profitability ratios focus on net income and how it compares to other amounts reported on the 
financial statements. Exhibit 13.3 lists these ratios and shows how to compute them. Profitability 
ratios are evaluated by comparing them over time for a single company or by comparing them with 
ratios for similar companies at a point in time.

similar companies at a point in time.
Balance Sheet
Ratios are not reported on the balance sheet. 
Analysts do, however, use balance sheet 
information to compute some ratios. Most 
analysts use an average of the beginning and 
ending amounts for balance sheet accounts 
when comparing balance sheet numbers to 
income statement numbers.
Income Statement
Earnings per share is the only ratio that is 
required to be reported on the financial state-
ments. It is reported at the bottom of the 
income statement.
Statement of Cash Flows
Ratios are not reported on the statement of cash 
flows. Analysts do, however, use cash flow 
information to compute some ratios.
Statement of Stockholders’ Equity
Ratios are not reported on the statement of 
stockholders’ equity. Analysts do, however, 
use amounts from this statement to compute 
some ratios.

Both companies are in the fish catching and manufacturing business. Both have been in business approxi-
mately 10 years, and each has had steady growth. The management of each has a different viewpoint in 
many respects. Blue Water is more conservative, and as its president has said, “We avoid what we con-
sider to be undue risk.” Neither company is publicly held.
Required:
 1. Compute as many ratios from Exhibit 13.3 as possible. You will not be able to compute all ratios. 
You will need to use year-end balances (not averages) for all ratios.
 2. Based on the ratios you computed, which company is more efficient at collecting its accounts receiv-
ables and turning over its inventory?

Financial Reporting and Analysis Cases
Interpreting Financial Results Based on Corporate Strategy
In this chapter, we discussed the importance of analyzing financial results based on an understanding of 
the company’s business strategy. Using the DuPont model, we illustrated how different strategies could 
earn high returns for investors. Assume that two companies in the same industry adopt fundamentally 
different strategies. One manufactures high-end consumer electronics. Its products employ state-of-the-
art technology, and the company offers a high level of customer service both before and after the sale. 
The other company emphasizes low cost with good performance. Its products utilize well-established 
technology but are never innovative. Customers buy these products at large, self-service warehouses 
and are expected to install the products using information contained in printed brochures. Which of 
the DuPont model ratios would you expect to differ for these companies as a result of their different 
 
business strategies?
Inferring Information from the DuPont Model Ratios
In this chapter, we discussed the DuPont model. Using that framework, find the missing amount in each 
of the following cases:
Case 1: ROE is 10 percent; net income is $200,000; the total asset turnover ratio is 5; and net sales are 
$1,000,000. What is the amount of average stockholders’ equity?
Case 2: Net income is $1,500,000; net sales are $8,000,000; average stockholders’ equity is 
$12,000,000; ROE is 22 percent; and the total asset turnover ratio is 8. What is the amount of average 
total assets?
Case 3: ROE is 15 percent; the net profit margin is 10 percent; the total asset turnover ratio is 5; and 
average total assets are $1,000,000. What is the amount of average stockholders’ equity?
Case 4: Net income is $500,000; ROE is 15 percent; the total asset turnover ratio is 5; net sales are 
$1,000,000; and financial leverage is 2. What is the amount of average total assets?
Critical Thinking Case
Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma
Barton Company requested a large loan from First Federal Bank to acquire a tract of land for future 
expansion. Barton reported current assets of $1,900,000 ($430,000 in cash) and current liabilities of 
$1,075,000. First Federal denied the loan request for a number of reasons, including the fact that the cur-
rent ratio was below 2:1. When Barton was informed of the loan denial, the controller of the company 
immediately paid $420,000 that was owed to several trade creditors. The controller then asked First Fed-
eral to reconsider the loan application. Based on these abbreviated facts, would you recommend that First 
Federal approve the loan request? Why? Are the controller’s actions ethical?

n 2013, Amazon.com founder Jeffrey Bezos purchased for $250 million The  
Washington 
Post and some other assets owned by The Washington Post Company, ending 80 years 
of control of the newspaper by the Graham family. The remaining assets of the 
 
Washington Post Company adopted Graham Holdings Company as its new name to expand 
the Graham Holdings Company investments. The best known of these is Kaplan, Inc., the 
king of admissions test preparation and other services that helped or will help you pre-
pare for the SAT, GMAT, LSAT, Certified Public Accountant, or Chartered Financial Analyst 
exams. In addition to test preparation, Kaplan offers K–12 services for children and post-
secondary education and professional training at Kaplan Higher Education. As a diversi-
fied company, Graham Holdings also owns media operations in television broadcasting 
and Slate, The Root, and Foreign Policy magazines; SocialCode, a marketing technology 
and solutions company for firms such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram; and 
a variety of other smaller operations ranging from home health care services to industrial 
products manufacturing.
The company has achieved its diversity by investing in the stock of other companies and 
acquiring other businesses. In 2014, it acquired nine businesses for $210 million and spent 
over $49.9 million to invest in other companies. As its long-term investment strategy,  
Graham 
Holdings analyzes the earnings potential and strength of the management teams of busi-
nesses it is interested in acquiring. The result is a diverse group of businesses, but with com-
mon goals and values. Each acquired business retains its own identity, workplace culture, and 
management team responsible for its operations.*

Many strategic factors motivate managers to invest in securities. A company that 
has extra cash and simply wants to earn a return on the idle funds can invest those 
funds in the stocks and bonds of other companies, either long or short term. We 
say these investments are passive because the managers are not interested in 
influencing or controlling the other companies. Graham Holdings’s 2014 and 
2013 comparative balance sheets, shown in Exhibit A.1, include the short-term 
account “Investments in Available-for-Sale Securities.”
Sometimes a company decides to invest in another company with the purpose 
of influencing that company’s policies and activities. Graham Holdings’s balance 
sheet reports these types of investments as “Investments in Affiliates.” Finally, 
managers may determine that controlling another company, by either purchas-
ing it directly or becoming the majority shareholder, is desirable. If the acquired 
company goes out of existence, its assets and liabilities are added at fair value 
to the assets and liabilities of the buyer. If the acquired company continues as 
a separate legal entity, the two companies’ financial reports are combined into 
consolidated financial statements, as Graham Holdings has done (see the title to 
its consolidated balance sheet).
In this appendix, we discuss the accounting for four types of investments. 
First, we discuss using the amortized cost method to account for passive invest-
ments in bonds. Second, we examine the fair value method of accounting for pas-
sive investments. Third, we present the equity method used to account for stock 
investments involving significant influence. The appendix closes with a discussion 
of accounting for mergers and consolidated statements.

TYPES OF INVESTMENTS AND ACCOUNTING METHODS
The accounting methods used to record investments are directly related to how much is owned 
and how long management intends to hold the investments. The investment categories and the 
appropriate measuring and reporting methods are summarized as follows.
Passive Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
Passive investments are made to earn a return on funds that may be needed for future short-
term or long-term purposes. This category includes both investments in debt (bonds and notes) 
and equity securities (stock). Debt securities are always considered passive investments. If the 
company intends to hold the securities until they reach maturity, the investments are measured 
and reported at amortized cost. If they are to be sold before maturity, they are reported using the 
fair value method.
For investments in equity securities, the investment is presumed passive if the investing 
company owns less than 20 percent of the outstanding voting shares of the other company. The 
fair value method is used to measure and report the investments.
Investments in Stock for Significant Influence
Significant influence is the ability to have an important impact on the operating, investing, 
and financing policies of another company. Significant influence is presumed if the investing 
company owns from 20 to 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares of the other company. 
However, other factors may also indicate that significant influence exists, such as membership 
on the board of directors of the other company, participation in the policy-making processes, 
evidence of material transactions between the two companies, an interchange of management 
personnel, or technological dependency. The equity method is used to measure and report this 
category of investments.
Investments in Stock for Control
Control is the ability to determine the operating and financing policies of another company 
through ownership of voting stock. Control is presumed when the investing company owns 
more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting stock of the other company. Acquisition 
accounting and consolidation are applied to combine the companies.

DEBT HELD TO MATURITY: AMORTIZED COST METHOD
When management plans to hold a debt security (such as a bond or note) until its maturity date 
(when the principal is due), it is reported in an account appropriately called held-to-maturity 
investments. Debt securities should be classified as held-to-maturity investments if manage-
ment has the intent and the ability to hold them until maturity. These investments in debt instru-
ments are listed at cost adjusted for the amortization of any discount or premium (amortized 
cost method), not at their fair value. We now illustrate accounting for investments in bonds 
issued by another company.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE A-1

METHOD

Bond Purchases
On the date of purchase, a bond may be acquired at the maturity amount (at par), for less than 
the maturity amount (at a discount), or for more than the maturity amount (at a premium).1 
The total cost of the bond, including all incidental acquisition costs such as transfer fees and 
broker commissions, is debited to the Held-to-Maturity Investments account.
To illustrate accounting for bond investments, assume that on July 1, 2016, Graham 
 
Holdings paid the par value of $100,000 for 8 percent bonds that mature on June 30, 2021.2 
Interest at 8 percent is paid each June 30 and December 31. Management plans to hold the 
bonds for five years, until maturity.
The journal entry to record the purchase of the bonds follows:

1The determination of the price of the bond is based on the present value techniques discussed in Chapter 9. Many 
analysts refer to a bond price as a percentage of par. For example, The Wall Street Journal might report that an 
ExxonMobil bond with a par value of $1,000 is selling at 82.97. This means it would cost $829.70 (82.97 percent of 
$1,000) to buy the bond.
2When bond investors accept a rate of interest on a bond investment that is the same as the stated rate of interest on 
the bonds, the bonds will sell at par (i.e., at 100 or 100% of face value). For illustration of the journal entries of a 
bond purchased at other than par value, see Supplement A at the end of this appendix.
Interest Earned
The bonds in this illustration were purchased at par or face value. Since no premium or dis-
count needs to be amortized, the book value remains constant over the life of the investment. 
In this situation, revenue earned from the investment each period is measured as the amount of 
interest collected in cash or accrued at year-end. The following journal entry records the receipt 
of interest on December 31:
Cash (+A ) [$100,000 × 0.08 × 6/12] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

payment would be:

A–5
If the bond investment must be sold before maturity, any difference between market value 
(the proceeds from the sale) and net book value would be reported as a gain or loss on sale. If 
management intends to sell the bonds before the maturity date, they are treated in the same 
manner as investments in stock classified as available-for-sale securities, which we discuss in 
the next section.
PAS S I V E  I N V E ST M E N TS :  T H E  FA I R  
VA LU E M ET HO D
When the investing company owns debt securities or less than 20 percent of the outstanding 
voting stock of another company, the investment is considered passive. Among the assets and 
liabilities on the balance sheet, only passive investments in marketable securities (other than 
debt held to maturity) are required to be reported using the fair value method on the date of 
the balance sheet. Fair value is a security’s current market value (the amount that would be 
received in an orderly sale). Before we discuss the specific accounting for these investments, 
we should consider the implications of using fair value:
 
1. Why are passive investments reported at fair value on the balance sheet? Two primary 
factors determine the answer to this question:
 
 Relevance. Analysts who study financial statements often attempt to forecast 
a company’s future cash flows. They want to know how a company can gener-
ate cash for purposes such as expansion of the business, payment of dividends, 
or survival during a prolonged economic downturn. One source of cash is the 
sale of securities from its passive investments portfolio. The best estimate of 
the cash that could be generated by the sale of these securities is their current 
fair value.
 
 Measurability. Accountants record only items that can be measured in dollar 
terms with a high degree of reliability (an unbiased and verifiable measure-
ment). Determining the fair value of most assets is very difficult because they 
are not actively traded. For example, Graham Holdings’s balance sheet reports 
its headquarters building in terms of its original cost less accumulated deprecia-
tion in part because of the difficulty in determining an objective fair value for 
it. Contrast the difficulty of determining the value of a building with the ease of 
determining the value of Berkshire Hathaway stock owned by Graham Hold-
ings. A quick look at The Wall Street Journal or an Internet financial service is 
all that is necessary to determine the current price because these securities are traded each 
day on established stock exchanges.
 
2. When the investment account is adjusted to reflect changes in fair value, what other 
account is affected when the asset account is increased or decreased? Under the double-
entry method of accounting, every journal entry affects at least two accounts. One account is 
the investment account. The other account affected is for unrealized holding gains (losses)

that are recorded whenever the fair value of investments changes. These are unrealized 
because no actual sale has taken place; simply by holding the security, the value has changed. 
If the value of the investments increases by $100,000 during the year, an adjusting journal 
entry records the increase in the investment account and an unrealized holding gain for 
$100,000. If the value of the investments decreases by $75,000 during the year, an adjust-
ing journal entry records the decrease in the investment account and an unrealized holding 
loss of $75,000. The financial statement treatment of the unrealized holding gains or losses 
depends on the classification of the passive investments.
Classifying Passive Investments at Fair Value
Depending on management’s intent, passive investments at fair value may be classified as trad-
ing securities or available-for-sale securities.
Trading Securities
Trading securities are actively traded with the objective of generating profits on short-term 
changes in the price of the securities. This approach is similar to the one taken by many mutual 
funds. The portfolio manager actively seeks opportunities to buy and sell securities. Trading 
securities are classified as current assets on the balance sheet.
Available-for-Sale Securities
Most companies do not actively trade the securities of other companies. Instead, they invest 
to earn a return on funds they may need for future operating purposes. Other than debt secu-
rities to be held to maturity, these debt and equity investments are called available-for-sale 
 
securities. They are classified as current or noncurrent assets on the balance sheet depending 
on whether management intends to sell the securities during the next year.
Trading securities (TS for short) are most commonly reported by financial institutions that 
actively buy and sell short-term investments to maximize returns. Most corporations, however, 
invest in short- and long-term available-for-sale securities (AFS, for short). We will focus on 
this category in the next section by analyzing Graham Holdings’s investing activities.
Available-for-Sale Securities
Graham Holdings’s annual report contains the following information concerning this invest-
ment portfolio:
TRADING SECURITIES  
All investments in stocks or bonds 
that are held primarily for the 
purpose of active trading (buying 
and selling) in the near future 
(classified as short term).
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE 
SECURITIES  
All passive investments other than 
trading securities and debt held 
to maturity (classified as either 
short term or long term).
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Investments in Available-for-Sale Securities. The Company’s investments in marketable 
equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and, therefore, are recorded at fair value in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements, with the change in fair value during the period excluded 
from earnings and recorded net of income taxes as a separate component of other comprehensive 
income. If the fair value of a marketable equity security declines below its cost basis and the 
decline is considered other than temporary, the Company will record a write-down, which is 
included in earnings.

For simplification, let’s assume that Graham Holdings had no passive investments at the end of 
2014. In the following illustration, we will apply the accounting policy used by Graham Hold-
ings for 2015, 2016, and 2017.

Purchase of Securities
At the beginning of 2015, Graham Holdings purchases for cash 15,000 shares of Internet News3 
(INews for short) common stock for $10 per share (a total of $150,000). There were 100,000 
outstanding shares, so Graham Holdings owns 15 percent of INews (15,000 shares ÷ 100,000 
shares), which is treated as a passive investment. Such investments are recorded initially at cost:

Investments in equity securities earn a return from two sources: (1) dividend income and 
 
(2) price increases. Dividends earned are reported as investment income on the income state-
ment and are included in the computation of net income for the period. Graham Holdings 
received a $1 per share cash dividend from INews totaling $15,000 ($1 × 15,000 shares).

This entry is the same for both the trading securities and available-for-sale securities. Price

Year-End Valuation
At the end of the accounting period, these passive investments are reported on the  
balance 
sheet at fair value, the amount that would be received in an orderly sale.
For 2015 Assume that INews had an $8 per share fair value at the end of the year. That is, the 
investment had lost value ($10 − $8 = $2 per share) for the year. However, because the invest-
ment has not been sold, the loss is an unrealized loss, not a realized loss.
Reporting the AFS investment at fair value requires adjusting the asset Investments in AFS 
Securities up or down to fair value at the end of each period.4 The gain is credited or the loss 
is debited to the Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) account to complete the entry. For available-
for-sale securities, the Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) account is reported in the stockhold-
ers’ equity section of the balance sheet under Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 
(denoted as OCI). Thus, the balance sheet remains in balance. Only when the security is sold 
are any realized gains or losses included in net income.
3Internet News is a fictitious company.
4Companies often keep the asset value at cost and record the change in fair value in a related valuation allowance 
that is added or subtracted from the asset. This does not change the financial statement presentation.

Let’s assume that at the end of 2017 Graham Holdings sold all of its AFS securities invest-
ment in INews for $13 per share. The company would receive $195,000 in cash ($13 × 15,000 
shares) for stock it paid $150,000 for in 2015 ($10 × 15,000 shares). The gain or loss on sale 
is computed as follows:
Proceeds from sale − Investment cost = Gain if positive (Loss if negative)
In our example, a gain on sale of $45,000 (proceeds of $195,000 − cost of $150,000) would 
be recorded and reported on the income statement. The Investment in AFS securities of 
$165,000 and the credit balance of $15,000 in Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) would be 
eliminated.

Comparing Trading and Available-for-Sale Securities
The reporting impact of unrealized holding gains or losses depends on whether the investment 
is classified as an available-for-sale security or a trading security.
Available-for-Sale Portfolio
As we learned in the previous section, for available-for-sale securities, the balance in net unre-
alized holding gains and losses is reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity 
(under Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, as illustrated in Exhibit A.1 for Graham 
Holdings Company).
It is not reported on the income statement and does not affect net income. At the time of sale, 
the difference between the proceeds from the sale and the original cost of the investment is 
recorded as a gain or loss on sale of available-for-sale securities. At the same time, the Invest-
ments in AFS Securities and Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) accounts are eliminated.
Trading Securities Portfolio
For trading securities, the amount of the adjustment to record net unrealized holding gains and 
losses is included on each period’s income statement. Net holding gains increase and net 
holding losses decrease net income. This also means that the amount recorded as net unreal-
ized gains and losses on trading securities is closed to Retained Earnings at the end of the 
period. Thus, when selling a trading security, Cash and only one other balance sheet account 
are affected: Investments in TS. Also, only the difference between the cash proceeds from the

Reporting the Fair Value of Investments
Accounting standards require that companies disclose the measurements used to determine the fair values 
of assets on the balance sheet. The fair value of an asset is the amount that would be received in an orderly 
sale. To measure fair value, the standard recognizes three approaches in order of decreasing reliability:

 Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.

 Level 2: Estimates based on other observable inputs (e.g., prices for similar assets).

 Level 3: Estimates based on unobservable estimates (the company’s own estimates of factors 
that market participants would consider).
Fair value should be determined using the most reliable method available (Level 1 if possible). The 
reporting company must then disclose the amounts determined under each approach in a note to the 
financial statements. The following is the note provided in the most recent annual report of Microsoft 
Corporation.

As this appendix is being written, the Financial Accounting Standards Board is deliberating on issues 
raised regarding the measurement of investments in equity securities. The tentative decision is that all 
investments in equity securities, regardless of whether they are classified as current or noncurrent, trad-
ing or available-for-sale, should be measured at fair value with subsequent adjustments recognized in net 
income. The exceptions are for investments meeting the equity method accounting criteria (discussed in 
the next section) and those without a readily determinable fair value. This is a departure from the current 
practice of having only adjustments to fair value for trading securities recognized in net income of the 
current period.

Normally, this is done using the economic return from investing ratio, which provides a percentage of 
what was earned plus any realized and/or unrealized gains or losses on the portfolio.

INTERPRETATIONS
In General Economic investment returns contain two parts: the effect of dividends received, called the 
dividend yield, and the effect of the change in fair value, called the capital gain or loss. Note that from an 
economic standpoint, you have earned the capital gain or loss whether you have sold the securities or not 
since you had the opportunity to convert the gain or loss into cash by selling. If you look at the numerator 
of the ratio each year, you will see that it matches the amount of income reported each year under trading 
securities in Exhibit A.2, Part B. This is why many analysts believe that the accounting for trading securi-
ties better reflects the economics of investing.

When Graham Holdings invests cash in securities that are reported on its balance sheet 
as Investments in Available-for-Sale Securities, it is a passive investor. However, when the 
company reports Investments in Affiliates on its balance sheet, it is taking a more active 
role as an investor. For a variety of reasons, an investor may want to exert influence (pre-
sumed by owning 20 to 50 percent of the outstanding voting stock) without becoming the 
controlling shareholder (presumed when owning more than 50 percent of the voting stock). 
Examples follow:

 A retailer may want to influence a manufacturer to be sure that it can obtain certain products 
designed to its specifications.

 A manufacturer may want to influence a computer consulting firm to ensure that it can 
incorporate the consulting firm’s cutting-edge technology in its manufacturing processes.

 A manufacturer may recognize that a parts supplier lacks experienced management and 
could prosper with additional managerial support.
The equity method must be used when an investor can exert significant influence over an 
affiliate. On the balance sheet these long-term investments are classified as investments in 
affiliates (or associated companies). Graham Holdings reported investments in affiliates in 
the notes to its 2014 financial statements.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE A-3
Analyze and report investments 
involving significant influence 
using the equity method.
EQUITY METHOD  
Used when an investor can exert 
significant influence over an 
affiliate; the method permits 
recording the investor’s share of 
the affiliate’s income.
INVESTMENTS IN 
AFFILIATES (OR 
ASSOCIATED COMPANIES) 
Investments in stock held for 
the purpose of influencing the 
operating and financing strategies 
of the entity for the long term.
Note that the denominator each year is the beginning balance of investments for the year (or the end-
ing balance from the prior year). For 2015, the denominator $150,000 is the balance of the first purchase 
of 2015, $120,000 is the ending balance of 2015 (and beginning balance for 2016), and $165,000 is the 
ending balance of 2016 (and beginning balance for 2017).
A Few Cautions Computations for realistic portfolios are more complex if securities are bought and 
sold throughout the year. This affects the computation of the denominator of the ratio.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Investments in Affiliates. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for its 
investments in and earnings or losses of affiliates that it does not control, but over which it exerts 
significant influence. . . .

GRAHAM HOLDINGS COMPANY
Recording Investments under the Equity Method
Under the equity method, the investor’s 20 to 50 percent ownership of a company presumes 
significant influence over the affiliate’s process of earning income. As a consequence, the 
investor reports its portion of the affiliate’s net income as its income and increases the invest-
ment account by the same amount. Similarly, the receipt of dividends by the investor is treated 
as a reduction of the investment account, not revenue. A summary follows:

Purchase of Stock
For simplification, let’s assume that, at the beginning of 2015, Graham Holdings had no long-
term investments in companies over which it exerted significant influence. In 2015, Graham 
Holdings purchased 40,000 shares of the outstanding voting common stock of Internet News 
(INews) for $400,000 in cash. Since INews had 100,000 shares of common stock outstanding, 
Graham Holdings acquired 40 percent and was presumed to have significant influence over the 
affiliate. Therefore, Graham Holdings must use the equity method to account for this invest-
ment. The purchase of the asset would be recorded at cost.

Earnings of Affiliates
Because the investor can influence the process of earning income for the affiliates, the investor 
company bases its investment income on the affiliates’ earnings rather than the dividends affili-
ates pay. During 2015, INews reported a net income of $500,000 for the year. Graham Holdings’s 
percentage share of INews’s income was $200,000 (40% × $500,000) and is recorded as follows:

investor then records investment income equal to its percentage share of the affiliates’ net 
income and increases its asset account Investments in Affiliates (or Associated Companies). 
If the affiliates report net losses, the investor records the opposite effect.

 Dividends paid by affiliates: If affiliates declare and pay dividends during the year (a 
financing decision), the investor reduces its investment account and increases cash when it 
receives its share of the dividends.

AP P END I X A  Reporting and Interpreting Investments in Other Corporations
If the affiliates report a net loss for the period, the investor records its percentage share of the 
loss by decreasing the investment account and recording Equity in Affiliate Loss. The Equity 
in Affiliate Earnings (or Loss) is reported in the Other Items section of the income statement, 
with interest revenue, dividend revenue, and interest expense.
Dividends Received
Because Graham Holdings can influence the dividend policies of its equity-method invest-
ments, any dividends it receives should not be recorded as investment income. Instead, divi-
dends received reduce its investment account. During 2015, INews declared and paid a cash 
dividend of $1 per share to stockholders. Graham Holdings received $40,000 in cash ($1 × 
40,000 shares) from INews.

Reporting Investments under the Equity Method
The Investments in Affiliates account is reported on the balance sheet as a long-term asset. 
However, as these last two entries show, the investment account does not reflect either cost or 
fair value. Instead, the following occurs:

 The investment account is increased by the cost of shares that were purchased and the pro-
portional share of the affiliates’ net income.

 The account is reduced by the amount of dividends received from the affiliate compa-
nies and the proportional share of any affiliates’ net losses and the cost of shares that 
were sold.
At the end of the accounting period, accountants do not adjust the investment account to 
reflect changes in the fair value of the securities that are held.5 When the securities are sold, 
the difference between the cash received and the book value of the investment is recorded as a 
gain or loss on the sale of the investment and is reported on the income statement in the Other 
Items section.

If between 20 and 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares are owned, significant influence over 
the affiliate firm’s operating and financing policies is presumed, and the equity method is applied. 
Under the equity method, the investor records the investment at cost on the acquisition date. Each 
period thereafter, the investment amount is increased (or decreased) by the proportionate interest in 
the income (or loss) reported by the affiliate corporation and decreased by the proportionate share of 
the dividends declared by the affiliate corporation.

Managers can choose freely between LIFO and FIFO or accelerated depreciation and straight-line depre-
ciation. In the case of minority (≤50% owned) investments, investments of less than 20 percent of a 
company’s outstanding stock are usually accounted for under the fair value method and investments of 
 
20 to 50 percent are accounted for under the equity method.
However, managers may be able to structure the acquisition of stock in a manner that permits them 
to use the accounting method that they prefer. For example, a company that wants to use the fair value 
method could purchase only 19.9 percent of the outstanding stock of another company and achieve the 
same investment goals as it would with a 20 percent investment. Why might managers want to avoid using 
the equity method? Most managers prefer to minimize variations in reported earnings. If a company were 
planning to buy stock in a firm that reported large earnings in some years and large losses in others, it 
might want to use the fair value method to avoid reporting its share of the affiliate’s earnings and losses.
Analysts who compare several companies must understand management’s reporting choices and 
the way in which differences between the fair value and equity methods can affect earnings. Auditors 
will review management’s application of the fair value and equity method to investments near to the 
20  
percent ownership level to determine if the proper method was used.

Many of the effects of applying the fair value method to passive investments and the equity method to 
investments held for significant influence affect net income but not cash flow. These items require adjust-
ments under the indirect method when converting net income to cash flows from operating activities.
In General Investments have a number of effects on the statement of cash flows:
 
1. The cash resulting from the sale or purchase is reflected in the Investing Activities section.
 
2. In the Operating Activities section, there are a number of adjustments to net income:
 
a. Any gain (loss) on the sale is subtracted from (added to) net income.
 
b. Any unrealized holding gain (loss) on trading securities is subtracted from (added to) net 
income.
 
c. Equity in affiliate earnings (losses) is subtracted from (added to) net income because no cash 
was involved in the recording of the revenue under the equity method.
 
d. Any dividends received from an affiliate are added to net income because, when cash was 
received, no revenue was recorded under the equity method.

AC QU I S I T I O N S
Before we discuss financial reporting issues for situations in which a company owns more than 
50 percent of the outstanding common stock of another corporation, we should consider man-
agement’s reasons for acquiring this level of ownership. The following are some of the reasons 
for acquiring control of another corporation:
 
1. Vertical integration. In this type of acquisition, a company acquires another at a different 
level in the channels of distribution. For example, oil companies such as ExxonMobil are 
active at vertical integration, from locating oil deposits, drilling and extracting the crude, 
transporting it, refining it into various petroleum products, and distributing the fuel to com-
pany-owned retail stations.
 
2. Horizontal growth. These acquisitions involve companies at the same level in the chan-
nels of distribution. For example, in early 2015, Heinz announced its plans to merge with 
Kraft Foods in a $45 billion deal that will create the world’s fifth largest food and beverage 
company.
 
3. Synergy. The operations of two companies together may be more profitable than the 
combined profitability of the companies as separate entities. The Heinz-Kraft merger is 
expected to provide for $1.5 billion in annual cost savings. In addition, Heinz earns 60 
percent of its sales from regions beyond North America, whereas Kraft’s sales are mostly 
in North America. The merger will provide opportunities to sell Kraft brands globally, real-
izing higher profits.
Understanding why one company has acquired control over other companies is a key factor in 
understanding the company’s overall business strategy.
Recording a Merger
The simplest way to understand the statements that result from the purchase of another com-
pany is to consider the case of a simple merger, where one company purchases all of the 
assets and liabilities of another and the acquired company goes out of existence as a separate 
corporation. We will consider the case where Graham Holdings acquires all of the assets and 
liabilities of INews for $1,000,000 cash.
The acquisition method is the only method allowed by U.S. GAAP and IFRS for record-
ing a merger or acquisition. It requires that the assets and liabilities of INews be recorded by 
Graham Holdings on its books at their fair value on the date of the merger. So the acquiring 
company, in this case Graham Holdings, must go through a two-step process, often called the 
purchase price allocation, to determine how to record the acquisition:
Step 1: 
Estimate the fair value of the acquired company’s tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, 
and liabilities. This includes all assets and liabilities, regardless of whether and at what amount they 
were recorded on the books of the acquired company.
Step 2: 
Compute goodwill, the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of the assets minus 
the liabilities listed in Step 1.
For our example, assume that INews owned two assets (equipment and a patent) and had one 
liability (a note payable). Graham Holdings followed the two steps and produced the following:
Step 1: 
Estimate the fair value of the acquired company’s tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and 
liabilities.

Step 2: Compute goodwill as follows:

Less: Fair value of assets ($950,000) minus liabilities ($100,000)
&&&&&& 850,000

$&&&& 150,000
Graham Holdings would then account for the merger by recording the assets and liabilities 
listed above and reducing cash for the amount paid as follows:

In summary, when performing a purchase price allocation, it is important to remember two 
points:

 The book values on the acquired company’s balance sheet are irrelevant unless they repre-
sent fair value.

 Goodwill is reported only if it is acquired in a merger or acquisition transaction.
In a recent annual report, Graham Holdings describes GAAP for recording mergers and acqui-
sitions in the following note:
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Business Combinations. The purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired, 
including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values at the 
acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. The excess of the cost of 
an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed is recognized as goodwill. The net assets and results of operations of an acquired entity 
are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date.
Reporting for the Combined Companies
After the merger, Graham Holdings will treat the acquired assets and liabilities in the same 
manner as if they were acquired individually. For example, the company will depreciate the 
$350,000 added to equipment over its remaining useful life and amortize the $600,000 for pat-
ents over their remaining useful life. As we noted in Chapter 8, goodwill is considered to have 
an indefinite life. As a consequence, it is not amortized, but, like all long-lived assets, goodwill 
is reviewed for possible impairment of value. Recording an impairment loss would increase 
expenses for the period and reduce the amount of goodwill on the balance sheet.

Mergers and ownership of a controlling interest in another corporation (more than 50 percent of the 
outstanding voting shares) must be accounted for using the acquisition method. The acquired com-
pany’s assets and liabilities are measured at their fair values. Any amount paid above the fair value of 
the net assets is reported as goodwill by the buyer. To make sure you understand how to apply these 
concepts, answer the following questions.

When a company acquires another, and both companies continue their separate legal 
 
existence, consolidated financial statements must be presented. The parent company is the 
company that gains control over the other company. The subsidiary company is the company 
that the parent acquires. When the parent buys 100 percent of the subsidiary, the resulting 
 
consolidated financial statements look the same as they would if the companies were combined 
into one in a simple merger as discussed above. The procedures involved in preparation of 
 
consolidated statements are discussed in advanced accounting courses.

Held-to-Maturity Bonds Purchased at Other Than Par Value: Amortized  
Cost Method
Bond Purchases
On the date of purchase, a bond may be acquired at the maturity amount (at par), for less than the matu-
rity amount (at a discount), or for more than the maturity amount (at a premium). The total cost of the 
bond, including all incidental acquisition costs such as transfer fees and broker commissions, is debited 
to the Held-to-Maturity Investments account.
To illustrate accounting for bond investments acquired at other than par, assume that on July 1, 
2016, Graham Holdings paid $92,277 cash for an 8 percent, 5-year $100,000 bond that paid interest 
semiannually (on June 30 and December 31). The bond’s yield was 10 percent. The $92,277 represents 
the present value of the bond on the purchase date, computed as follows:
Present value of the bond investment = Present value of the face + Present value of the interest annuity 
 
$92,277 = ($100,000 × 0.6139) + ($4,000 × 7.7217) 
 
!!!![n = 10 periods; interest rate = 5%]
Management intends to hold the bonds until maturity. The journal entry to record the purchase of the 
bonds follows:

The bonds in this illustration were purchased at a discount that will need to be amortized over the life 
of the investment. Using the effective interest amortization method (discussed in Chapter 10), the cash 
received is based on the face amount of the bond ($100,000) multiplied by the stated rate of interest for 
half of a year (4 percent). Revenue earned is computed by multiplying the present value of the bond times 
the market rate for half of a year (5 percent). The following journal entry records the receipt of interest

June 30, 2017. If the bond investment must be sold before maturity, any difference between market value 
on the date of sale and net book value would be reported as a gain or loss on sale.

A-1. Analyze and report investments in debt securities held to maturity.  p. A-3
When management intends to hold an investment in a debt security (such as a bond or note) until it 
matures, the held-to-maturity security is recorded at cost when acquired and reported at amortized 
cost on the balance sheet. Any interest earned during the period is reported on the income statement.
 
A-2. Analyze and report passive investments in securities using the fair value method.  p. A-5
Acquiring debt securities not held to maturity or less than 20 percent of the outstanding voting 
shares of another company’s common stock is presumed to be a passive investment. Passive invest-
ments may be classified as:

 Trading securities (which are actively traded to maximize return) or

 Available-for-sale securities (which earn a return but are not as actively traded) depending on 
management’s intent.
The investments are recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value at year-end. The resulting unreal-
ized gain or loss is recorded as follows:

 For trading securities, the net unrealized gains and losses are reported in net income.

 For available-for-sale securities, the net unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component 
of stockholders’ equity in other comprehensive income.
Any dividends earned are reported as revenue, and any gains or losses on sales of passive invest-
ments are reported on the income statement.
 
A-3. Analyze and report investments involving significant influence using the equity method.  p. A-14
If between 20 and 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares are owned, significant influence over 
the affiliate firm’s operating and financing policies is presumed, and the equity method is applied. 
Under the equity method, the investor records the investment at cost on the acquisition date. Each 
period thereafter, the investment amount is increased (or decreased) by the proportionate interest in 
the income (or loss) reported by the affiliate corporation and decreased by the proportionate share 
of the dividends declared by the affiliate corporation.
 
A-4. Analyze and report investments in controlling interests.  p. A-19
Mergers occur when one company purchases all of the net assets of another and the target company ceases 
to exist as a separate legal entity. Mergers and ownership of a controlling interest of another corporation 
(more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares) must be accounted for using the acquisition method. 
The acquired company’s assets and liabilities are measured at their fair values on the date of the transac-
tion. Any amount paid above the fair value of the assets less liabilities is reported as goodwill by the buyer.
Each year, many companies report healthy profits but file for bankruptcy. Some investors consider this 
situation to be a paradox, but sophisticated analysts understand how this situation can occur. These analysts 
recognize that the income statement is prepared under the accrual concept (revenue is reported when earned 
and the related expense is matched with the revenue). The income statement does not report cash collec-
tions and cash payments. Troubled companies usually file for bankruptcy because they cannot meet their 
cash obligations (for example, they cannot pay their suppliers or meet their required interest payments). The 
income statement does not help analysts assess the cash flows of a company. The statement of cash flows, 
discussed in Chapter 12, is designed to help statement users evaluate a company’s cash inflows and outflows.

Economic return from investing measures the performance of a company’s securities portfolios. 
Investment returns include both dividends received and any change in the fair value. A high or rising 
ratio suggests that a firm’s securities portfolio is improving. It is computed as follows (see the “Key 
Ratio Analysis” box in the Passive Investments section):
*Ending Balance of Investments - Beginning Balance of Investments
Economic Return from Investing =
Dividends and Interest Received + Change in Fair Value*

year. The company used the equity method to account for its investment in Maryn. The market price 
of Sheena Company’s share of Maryn stock increased during the current year to a total value of 
$550,000.
Required:

Using Financial Reports: Interpreting International Goodwill Disclosures
Diageo is a major international company located in London, best known for its Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker, 
and Guinness brands of spirits. Its financial statements are accounted for under IFRS. A recent annual 
report contained the following information concerning its accounting policies.
Acquired brands and other intangible assets are recognised when they are controlled through 
contractual or other legal rights, or are separable from the rest of the business, and the fair 
value can be reliably measured.
Intangible assets that are regarded as having limited useful economic lives are amortised 
on a straight-line basis over those lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and 
intangible assets that are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives are not amortised. 
These assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is an indication that 
the assets may be impaired. To ensure that assets are not carried at above their recoverable 
amounts . . . Amortisation and any impairment writedowns are charged to other operating 
expenses in the income statement.
Required:
Discuss how this accounting treatment compares with procedures used in this country.

Critical Thinking Cases
Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma: Using Inside Information
Assume that you are on the board of directors of a company that has decided to buy 80 percent of the out-
standing stock of another company within the next three or four months. The discussions have convinced 
you that this company is an excellent investment opportunity, so you decide to buy $10,000 worth of the 
company’s stock for your personal portfolio. Is there an ethical problem with your decision? Would your 
answer be different if you planned to invest $500,000? Are there different ethical considerations if you 
don’t buy the stock but recommend that your brother do so?
Evaluating an Acquisition from the Standpoint of a Financial Analyst
Assume that you are a financial analyst for a large investment banking firm. You are responsible for 
analyzing companies in the retail sales industry. You have just learned that a large West Coast retailer has 
acquired a large East Coast retail chain for a price more than the net book value of the acquired company. 
You have reviewed the separate financial statements for the two companies before the announcement of 
the acquisition. You have been asked to write a brief report explaining what will happen when the finan-
cial results of the companies are consolidated under the acquisition method.
Financial Reporting and Analysis Team Project
Team Project: Examining an Annual Report
Working together as a team, select an industry to analyze. Yahoo Finance provides lists of industries at 
biz.yahoo.com/p/industries.html. Click on an industry for a list of companies in that industry. Alterna-
tively, go to Google Finance at www.google.com/finance and search for a company you are interested in. 
You will be presented with a list including that company and its competitors. Each team member should 
acquire the annual report or 10-K for one publicly traded company in the industry, with each member 
selecting a different company (the SEC EDGAR service at www.sec.gov and the company’s investor 
relations website itself are good sources).
Required:
On an individual basis, each team member should write a short report answering the following questions 
about the selected company. Discuss any patterns across the companies that you as a team observe. Then, 
as a team, write a short report comparing and contrasting your companies.
On an individual basis, each team member should write a short report that answers the following questions:
 1. Determine whether the company prepared consolidated financial statements. If so, did it use the 
acquisition method? How do you know?
 2. Does the company use the equity method for any of its investments?
 3. Does the company hold any investments in securities? If so, what is their fair value? Does the com-
pany have any unrealized gains or losses?
 4. Identify the company’s lines of business. Why does management want to engage in these business 
activities?

n 1995, Kevin Plank, a former University of Maryland football player, dreamed 
of a better t-shirt: one that wicks perspiration off your skin rather than absorb-
ing it. In pursuit of his dream, he founded Under Armour with $16,000 in cash 
and $40,000 in credit. Badly needing additional capital, he asked his friend and 
former Heisman Trophy winner Eddie George to invest in the company. Eddie 
declined, and likely regrets doing so. In 2012, Under Armour reported assets of 
$1.2 billion and sales of $1.8 billion. An initial investment of $10,000 would be 
worth over $100 million today. Ouch! Who would have known?
While rapidly growing over the last 21 years, Under Armour signed leases, 
paid income taxes, and helped its employees plan for retirement by setting up 
a  
pension plan and providing other postretirement benefits. This supplement 
explores the accounting for each of these operating activities. Having a basic 
understanding of how a firm accounts for leases, taxes, and retirement obliga-
tions will help you make more informed decisions about companies and their 
 
current and future obligations.

L EA S E OVE RVI E W
Companies often lease assets (that is, pay for the right to use the assets) rather than purchasing 
them. Three common reasons for doing so are:

 To avoid the initial cash outflow required to outright purchase an asset.

 To avoid the hassle of disposing of a used asset at some point in the future.

 To secure a desired location or piece of equipment that is not available for sale (e.g., retail 
space in a mall).
When a company leases an asset, it enters into a contractual agreement with the owner of 
the asset. In the language of contracts (and accounting), the party that owns the asset is referred 
to as the lessor. The party that pays for the right to use the asset is referred to as the lessee. 
For accounting purposes, a lessee can lease an asset by signing either an operating lease or a 
capital lease. The terms of a capital lease resemble the financing and outright purchasing of 
an asset and therefore require companies to recognize both a lease asset and a lease liability on 
their balance sheets. In contrast, the terms of an operating lease are more similar to a short-term 
rental and therefore do not require companies to recognize a lease asset or a lease liability on 
their balance sheets. Since managers often prefer to minimize the liabilities they report on their 
balance sheets, they have an incentive to structure lease contracts so that they are accounted for 
as operating leases rather than capital leases.
Before we discuss analyzing a company’s lease disclosures and why you might want to 
conduct such an analysis, let’s review the criteria that a company uses to determine whether a 
lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. For accounting purposes, a lease 
is classified as a capital lease if it meets any of the following four criteria:

 The lease term is 75 percent or more of the leased asset’s expected economic life.

 Ownership of the leased asset is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term.

 The lease contract permits the lessee to purchase the leased asset at a price that is lower than 
its fair market value.

 When the lease is signed, the present value of the lease payments is 90 percent or more of 
the fair market value of the leased asset.
Accounting for Operating Leases
No assets or liabilities are recorded when a company signs an operating lease. Instead, the 
company simply records rent expense over the life of the lease. For example, assume that on 
January 1, 2014, Under Armour signs a lease contract to secure retail space in the Univer-
sity Village Mall. Assume further that none of the four capital lease criteria above are met, 
allowing Under Armour to account for the lease as an operating lease. Terms of the lease 
require Under Armour to pay $100,000 at the end of each month for a defined period of time. 
When Under Armour pays the $100,000 at the end of January, it will record the following 
journal entry:
Rent expense (+E, -SE)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100,000

Accounting for Leasehold Improvements
Before we move on to accounting for capital leases, let’s quickly touch on a topic that goes 
hand-in-hand with leases: leasehold improvements. Leasehold improvements are modifica-
tions that a lessee makes to a leased property. Such modifications are what make an Under 
Armour store look like an Under Armour store: the installation of specific types of display 
cases, logos, colors, and so on. In its 2012 “Property and Equipment” footnote, Under Armour 
reports leasehold improvements of $75.1 million. The accounting for leasehold improvements 
resembles the accounting for any other piece of equipment. For example, assume that when 
Under Armour signed the operating lease on January 1, 2014, to rent retail space at the Univer-
sity Village Mall, it paid cash totaling $600,000 to modify the space. Also assume that Under 
Armour expects these modifications to be beneficial over the life of the lease. When Under 
Armour pays cash to make these modifications, it will record the following journal entry:
Leasehold improvements (+A)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 600,000
 Cash (-A)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

-600,000
At the time Under Armour makes the modifications, it has simply exchanged one type of asset 
(cash) for another type of asset (a modification/improvement to one of its stores). Since leasehold 
improvements are directly tied to the leased asset, they are depreciated over the life of the lease. 
Assume that Under Armour is leasing the space at the University Village Mall for five years (60 
months), that it depreciates leasehold improvements using the straight-line method with zero 
salvage value, and that it records depreciation expense at the end of each month. At the end of 
January (and each subsequent month), Under Armour would record the following journal entry:1

Accounting for Capital Leases
Let’s now consider how Under Armour would account for a lease that meets one or more of the 
capital lease criteria. It is helpful to think of the signing of a capital lease as a transaction consist-
ing of two components: the purchase of an asset and the financing of that purchase. A company 
must account for both components. Assume that on January 1, 2014, Under Armour’s research 
and development division signs a five-year capital lease for the right to use a high-speed sewing 
machine that produces flat seams. The lease is based on an effective interest rate of 8 percent and 
requires annual lease payments of $10,000 on December 31 of each year. The effective interest

Modifications that a lessee makes 
to a leased property.
1We made the assumption that Under Armour would benefit from the leasehold improvements for the entire life of 
the lease. For this reason, Under Armour depreciates the leasehold improvements over the life of the lease. If some 
of the leasehold improvements had useful lives that were less than the life of the lease, these improvements would 
be depreciated over their useful lives rather than over the full life of the lease.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE S-2

rate is typically a lessee’s market rate of interest on long-term debt (e.g., bank borrowings or 
bond issuances) at the time the lease is signed. The lease liability that Under Armour records 
upon signing the capital lease equals the present value of all future lease  
payments. Since Under 
Armour must make a payment every December 31 for five years, computing the present value of 
the lease payments requires us to take the present value of a $10,000 annuity, over five periods, 
at a discount rate of 8 percent. Here are the inputs for computing the present value in Excel:

This is the value of the lease liability that Under Armour must record, as well as the 
value of the lease asset. Upon signing the lease, Under Armour would therefore record the 
following entry:

Over the life of the five-year lease, Under Armour will systematically write down:

 The book value of the sewing equipment asset and

 The book value of the lease payable liability.
Firms almost always use the straight-line method to depreciate leased assets, and they are 
required to use the effective interest rate method to amortize lease liabilities. (As discussed in 
Chapter 10, the effective interest rate method is also used to amortize the amount in the bond pay-
able account over a bond’s life.) The journal entries that Under Armour will record on Decem-
ber 31, 2014, to depreciate the leased sewing equipment and amortize the lease payable are:

2You likely noticed that we did not credit the contra-asset account called accumulated depreciation, but rather directly 
reduced the value of the sewing equipment. This is the way most firms reduce the book value of a leased asset, though 
it would not be wrong to credit accumulated depreciation over the life of the leased asset and then debit accumulated 
depreciation and credit sewing equipment at the end of the leased asset’s life to remove the asset from the books.

Under Armour will record the same depreciation expense entry each year over the life of the 
lease. The general form of the lease liability amortization entry will be the same each period, 
but the amounts will change. Exhibit S.1 shows the amounts that Under Armour will record

CALCULATIONS:
Book value of sewing equipment: Beginning book value - Depreciation expense for the year.
Depreciation expense (straight-line method): Beginning book value/5 years.
Book value of lease payable: Beginning book value – Amortization of lease payable for the year. 
Interest expense (effective interest rate method): Beginning book value × Effective interest rate (8%).
Cash paid to lessor: Lease payment as specified in the lease contract.
Amortization of lease payable: Cash paid to lessor – Interest expense.  
Note: Due to rounding, the amounts in Exhibit S.1 may be off by a couple of dollars. For example, depreciation 
expense ($7,985) over the five years sums to $39,925, slightly less than the full value ($39,927) of the sewing 
equipment. Depreciation expense to the nearest cent is $7,985.42, which when summed over the five years 
exactly equals the full value of the sewing equipment.
There are three things worth noting about the amounts in Exhibit S.1. First, the amount in 
the lease payable account at any point in time is simply the present value of all remaining lease 
payments at that point in time. For example, at the beginning of 2016, there are three years left 
on the lease. Using Excel, the present value is $25,771, the exact amount shown in Exhibit S.1 
for 2016.

The second thing worth noting is that the last depreciation expense entry zeros out the sew-
ing equipment account, and the last amortization of lease payable entry zeros out the lease 
payable account; the lease has ended, and the accounts associated with the lease are therefore 
removed from Under Armour’s balance sheet. The last thing worth noting is that the sum of all 
of the lease-related expenses recognized on the income statement over the five-year life of the 
lease (depreciation expenses + interest expenses) is exactly equal to $50,000, which is the sum 
of all of the cash payments made over the life of the lease. Exhibit S.2 graphs this relationship. 
Note that:

 In each year prior to 2016, total lease-related expenses are greater than the $10,000 cash 
payment.

 In each year after 2016, total lease-related expenses are less than the $10,000 cash 
 
payment.

 Over the five-year life of the lease, total lease-related expenses ($50,000) are exactly equal 
to total cash payments ($50,000).

Off-Balance-Sheet Financing
Analysts know that managers face incentives to minimize the liabilities reported on the balance sheet, that 
managers have the flexibility to structure leases so they are accounted for as operating leases rather than as 
capital leases, and that the future lease payments associated with operating leases are not included as a lia-
bility on the balance sheet. Structuring contracts in order to avoid reporting liabilities is commonly referred 
to as off-balance-sheet financing. Examples of arrangements that keep liabilities off of a company’s bal-
ance sheet include entering into joint venture arrangements, partnering with other companies to conduct 
research and development, and structuring lease contracts so that they are accounted for as operating leases 
rather than capital leases. Since analysts want to consider all contractual obligations when assessing a com-
pany’s underlying economics, they often attempt to adjust the company’s financial statements to reflect any 
off-balance-sheet arrangements. One of the most common adjustments they make is to include the future 
payments associated with operating leases as a liability on a company’s balance sheet.

Converting Operating Leases to Capital Leases
Companies disclose in their footnotes much, but not all, of the information needed to account 
for their operating leases “as if ” they were accounted for as capital leases. To fill in any miss-
ing information, we need to make some general assumptions during the conversion process. 
The first assumption we need to make pertains to interest rates (the discount rate we will use). 
Why do we need an interest rate? Recall that the lease liability placed on a company’s balance 
sheet reflects the present value of all future lease payments. Thus, we need an interest rate to 
help us compute the present value of the future lease payments associated with the company’s 
operating leases. Since we are going to convert Under Armour’s operating leases to capital 
leases, we will use 8 percent, the assumed market rate of interest for Under Armour in our capi-
tal lease example. Unless interest rates are changing rapidly, it is quite common for analysts to 
use the market rate of interest reflected in a company’s capital leases or other long-term debt at 
the time they are doing the conversion.
In the footnotes to its 2012 financial statements, Under Armour reports “total future mini-
mum lease payments” associated with operating leases of $202,895 thousand. The total pay-
ments due each year through 2018 are shown in Exhibit S.4.
The first step in our conversion process is to determine the present value of these future 
rental payments; this calculation provides an estimate of the amount Under Armour would have 
recognized as a liability on its balance sheet if the leases were accounted for as capital leases.

3Assuming that all of the payments in the “2018 and thereafter” row take place in 2018 is a simplifying assumption. 
I encourage you to conduct sensitivity analysis by exploring how the present value total ($153,384) changes if you 
alter this assumption. For example, if we assume that the “2018 and thereafter” row is equally spread over the next 
five years (periods 6–10), the present value total becomes $148,033.

payments in the “2018 and thereafter” row take place in 2018.3
The next step in the conversion process is to recognize our “as if” capital lease liability on 
Under Armour’s balance sheet. At this point we will make another general assumption: that the 
asset amount recognized on the balance sheet is equal to the liability amount we just calculated. 
From examining Exhibit S.1, you know that this is only true at the beginning and end of a lease. 
Since we do not have information about when Under Armour signed the operating leases dis-
closed in Exhibit S.4, we need to make an assumption about the signing date. The simplest is 
to assume that our conversion date is the signing date, as this precludes the need for additional 
present value calculations. Adding the present value of the future rental payments ($153,384 
thousand) to long-term liabilities and long-term assets on Under Armour’s 2012 balance sheet 
results in the following:

2012 (adjusted):

493,545
816,922
Notice that we did not make any adjustments to stockholders’ equity. We could have, but 
typically the impact of converting operating leases to capital leases has a negligible impact 
on net income over time (recall that net income is closed to retained earnings in stockhold-
ers’ equity at the end of each period), as long as approximately 50 percent of a company’s 
leases are in the first half of their lives and the other 50 percent are in the latter half of 
their lives. If you are wondering why this is the case, look back at the summary data at the 
bottom of Exhibit S.3. These data show that over the life of the lease, the total expenses 
recognized when the lease is accounted for as a capital lease are identical in aggregate 
dollar terms to the total rent expense that Under Armour would have recognized if it had 
accounted for the lease as an operating lease (in our example both equal $50,000). For this 
reason, some analysts do not take the time required to convert the income statement (and 
thus stockholders’ equity) when examining the impact of converting a company’s operating 
leases to capital leases.

Above, we added the present value of the future rental payments ($153,384 thousand) to 
long-term liabilities on Under Armour’s 2012 balance sheet. Let’s now examine how this 
adjustment alters Under Armour’s debt-to-equity ratio.
Some academic research suggests that, on average, greater than 50 percent of companies’ outstanding 
leases are in the first half of their lives. If you believe this to be the case for a company you are analyzing, 
you will need to adjust stockholders’ equity as well as the company’s assets and liabilities when convert-
ing its operating leases to capital leases. The academic research suggests that a useful rule of thumb is to 
record the lease asset at 70 percent of the value of the lease liability. If you were to use this rule of thumb, 
when you record the asset you would also decrease stockholders’ equity by 30 percent so that assets equal 
liabilities plus stockholders’ equity. The 30 percent reduction in stockholders’ equity reflects that total 
capital lease expenses (depreciation + interest) exceed total operating lease expenses (rent) in the first 
half of a lease’s life (as shown in Exhibits S.2 and S.3).

The debt-to-equity ratio reflects the amount of debt (liabilities) in a company’s capital structure rela-
tive to its equity. Analysts often compute a company’s debt-to-equity ratio to assess how the company’s 
debt per dollar of equity compares to that of its competitors or an industry average. Here is what Under 
Armour’s debt-to-equity ratio looks like pre- and post-conversion:

Adjusting Under Armour’s liabilities to include the obligations associated with its operating leases 
increases its debt-to-equity ratio by 43 percent! Imagine yourself in the role of a loan officer who is 
deciding whether to grant Under Armour a loan. Before making your decision, you would definitely 
want to consider the future obligations associated with Under Armour’s operating leases. Would you 
deny Under Armour the loan? Probably not, given that Under Armour generated $199,761 thousand 
in operating cash flows in fiscal 2012, which is more than enough to satisfy its total lease obligations 
in any given year. For other firms, however, understanding the impact of future operating lease pay-
ments on overall liabilities could determine whether you grant a loan that gets repaid or one that ends 
up in default.

In this section, we will consider two income tax disclosures that companies report in their 
footnotes. Both disclosures are the result of companies following different rules for finan-
cial reporting and tax reporting. The first disclosure pertains to deferred taxes. The second 
disclosure reconciles a company’s tax rate prior to any adjustments with its tax rate after 
adjustments.
For financial reporting purposes, companies follow generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP) when preparing financial statements for submission to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC). These are the statements you and I can access. At the same time, compa-
nies follow the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) when preparing tax returns for submission to the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Companies’ tax filings are not publicly available. Differences 
in GAAP and the IRC create differences in the tax expense reported to the SEC on a company’s 
income statement and the tax obligation reported to the IRS on the company’s tax return. These 
differences can be either permanent or temporary.
Permanent Tax Differences
Permanent tax differences are the result of a company reporting revenues and expenses on its 
income statement that it never reports on its tax return. An example of a permanent differ-
ence is municipal bond interest, which a company reports as income for financial reporting 
purposes but does not (ever) report as income for tax purposes; interest on municipal bonds 
is tax exempt. Permanent differences result in a company’s statutory tax rate being different 
from its effective tax rate. A company’s statutory tax rate is the rate tax law (i.e., the IRC) 
says a company should pay given its level of income. A company’s effective tax rate is the rate 
reflected on its income statement. Companies are required to reconcile the difference between 
their statutory and effective tax rates in their footnotes.
Reconciling Statutory and Effective Tax Rates
Under Armour reconciles the difference between its statutory tax rate and its effective tax 
rate in its “provision for income taxes” footnote. The items listed in the reconciliation reflect 
permanent differences between the tax expense Under Armour reports on its income statement 
and the tax obligation it reports on its tax return. Under Armour’s reconciliation is shown in 
Exhibit S.6.
STATUTORY TAX RATE

should pay given its level of

MBA  C O MPANI ON  Leases, Income Taxes, and Retirement Obligations
Let’s walk through the logic associated with one of the items listed in the reconciliation: for-
eign rate differential. This item decreased Under Armour’s effective tax rate in all three years. 
This item reflects income that Under Armour earned outside of the United States. Foreign income 
is taxed in the country in which it is earned rather than in the United States. If the foreign tax 
rate is lower than the U.S. tax rate, and Under Armour does not plan to bring this income back to 
the United States, Under Armour pays only the lower foreign tax rate, thereby lowering its effec-
tive tax rate. If the foreign tax rate is higher than the U.S. tax rate, Under Armour must pay the 
foreign government the higher rate, thereby increasing Under Armour’s effective tax rate.
As an alternative to looking in the footnotes, you can also calculate a company’s effective 
tax rate using information from its income statement. Simply divide tax expense by income 
before taxes, as shown below for Under Armour in 2012:
Tax expense:
$74,661 thousand
Income before taxes:
$203,439 thousand
Effective tax rate:
$74,661 ÷ $203,439 = 36.7%
Temporary Tax Differences
In contrast to permanent tax differences, temporary tax differences result when a company 
reports revenues and expenses on its income statement in a different time period than when it 
reports them on its tax return. If the difference between financial reporting and tax reporting 
temporarily delays a benefit, it results in the creation of an asset. If the difference temporarily 
delays an obligation, it results in the creation of a liability. Since these assets and liabilities are 
tax-related and result in either the deferral of a benefit or the deferral of an obligation, we call 
them deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Exhibit S.7 outlines the general situations 
that create deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.
Deferred Tax Assets
As summarized in Exhibit S.7, a company creates a deferred tax asset when it:

 Reports an expense on this period’s income statement that it does not report on its tax return 
until a future period or

 Does not report revenue on this period’s income statement that it does report on this period’s 
tax return.

Both circumstances result in this period’s accounting income being lower than this period’s 
tax income. An example is when a company collects revenue in advance. For tax purposes, the 
company is required to report the revenue on its tax return in the period it receives the cash. 
For financial reporting purposes, the company is required to recognize the advance payment 
as a liability (e.g., as unearned or deferred revenue) until it provides the good or service in a 
future period.
Let’s work through a deferred tax asset example. Assume that a customer comes into an 
Under Armour store just before the end of fiscal 2012 and pays cash for a $1,000 gift card. The 
gift card is redeemed in fiscal 2013. For simplicity, we will assume that this is the only transac-
tion Under Armour entered into and that the tax rate is 35 percent. Exhibit S.8 shows how this 
transaction creates a deferred tax asset for Under Armour at the end of fiscal 2012, and how 
in fiscal 2013 Under Armour uses the deferred tax asset to offset the tax expense listed on its 
income statement.
At the end of fiscal 2012, Under Armour does not recognize any revenue for financial 
reporting purposes because it has yet to provide the good or service. The $1,000 is listed on 
its balance sheet as unearned or deferred revenue (a liability). In 2013, when Under Armour 
provides the good or service, it recognizes revenue. Therefore, the receipt of the $1,000 
does not affect accounting income in 2012. In contrast, the IRS requires Under Armour to 
include the $1,000 as revenue on its 2012 tax return. This timing difference results in Under 
Armour booking a deferred tax asset in 2012 that it uses to offset its tax expense for financial 
reporting purposes in 2013. An important take-away from the above example is that over the 
two-year period, Under Armour’s tax obligation to the IRS ($350) is equal to tax expense 
listed on its income statement ($350); the difference in any given year is simply a timing 
(and therefore temporary) difference. Under Armour would record these transactions in the 
following manner:4

Deferred Tax Liabilities
As summarized in Exhibit S.7, a company creates a deferred tax liability when it:

 Reports revenue on this period’s income statement that it does not report on its tax return 
until a future period or

 Does not report an expense on this period’s income statement that it does report on this 
period’s tax return.
Both circumstances result in this period’s accounting income being higher than this period’s 
tax income. An example is when a company pays expenses in advance. The company is required 
to include the advance payment as an expense on its tax return in the period it pays the cash. 
For financial reporting purposes, the company is required to recognize the advance payment as 
an asset (e.g., as a prepaid expense) until it actually incurs the expense in a future period. When 
this happens, the company then uses the asset (the prepaid expense) to satisfy the expense.
As an example, assume that Under Armour prepays $600 of rent for a new location at the 
end of fiscal 2012 and uses the prepaid asset in fiscal 2013 to satisfy its first rent bill. For sim-
plicity, we will assume that this is the only transaction Under Armour entered into, that Under 
Armour reports revenue of $1,000, and that the tax rate is 35 percent. Exhibit S.9 shows how 
this transaction creates a deferred tax liability for Under Armour at the end of fiscal 2012, and 
how Under Armour removes this deferred obligation from its books in fiscal 2013.
At the end of fiscal 2012, Under Armour does not recognize the prepaid amount as an 
expense for financial reporting purposes because it has yet to physically use the space, and 
thus has not yet incurred rent expense. The $600 is listed on its balance sheet as an asset called 
prepaid rent. In 2013, when Under Armour uses the space and therefore owes rent, it reduces 
prepaid rent and records rent expense. This means that Under Armour’s accounting income 
does not reflect the prepayment as an expense in 2012. In contrast, the IRS requires Under 
Armour to report the $600 prepayment as an expense on its tax return in 2012. This timing 
difference results in Under Armour booking a deferred tax liability in 2012 and then removing

Armour’s tax obligation to the IRS ($490) is equal to the tax expense listed on its income state-

Under Armour’s Deferred Tax Disclosures
In the footnotes to its 2012 financial statements, Under Armour lists the deferred tax assets 
and liabilities shown in Exhibit S.10.
All of the deferred tax assets listed in Exhibit S.10 are probable future economic benefits 
that Under Armour plans to use to offset the tax expense listed on its income statement. All of 
the deferred tax liabilities are obligations that Under Armour must satisfy in the future. These 
obligations were created by temporary differences between accounting income reported on 
the financial statements and tax income reported on the tax return. As discussed in Chapter 8, 
property, plant, and equipment is listed because firms almost always depreciate their assets 
more quickly for tax purposes than they do for financial reporting purposes; this timing differ-
ence creates a deferred tax liability.
Reporting Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
In general, if a company intends to use an asset or convert the asset to cash within one year, it 
classifies that asset as a current asset on its balance sheet. Assets not classified as current assets 
are classified as long-term assets. The same general rule applies to liabilities. If a company 
intends to satisfy a liability within one year, it classifies the liability as a current liability on its 
balance sheet. Liabilities not classified as current liabilities are classified as long-term liabilities.
Companies are required to report deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on their bal-
ance sheets in the following way:

 CURRENT: Compare current deferred tax assets with current deferred tax liabilities. If the 
current asset exceeds the current liability, report the net amount as a current asset. If the cur-
rent liability exceeds the current asset, report the net amount as a current liability.

 LONG-TERM: Compare long-term deferred tax assets with long-term deferred tax liabili-
ties. If the long-term asset exceeds the long-term liability, report the net amount as a long-
term asset. If the long-term liability exceeds the long-term asset, report the net amount as a 
long-term liability.

The Company establishes a valuation allowance if either it is more likely than not that a deferred tax 
asset will expire before the Company is able to realize its benefits, or the future deductibility is uncertain. 
Periodically, the valuation allowance is reviewed and adjusted based on management’s assessments of 
realizable deferred tax assets.
As a result of the above reporting requirements, you may occasionally see a company that 
shows a current deferred tax asset and a long-term deferred tax liability, or vice versa, on its 
balance sheet. This is not the case with Under Armour. Under Armour has more current and 
long-term deferred tax assets than it does current and long-term deferred tax liabilities, so it 
reports both a current and a long-term deferred tax asset on its balance sheet.
Under Armour lists a “valuation allowance” in the deferred asset portion of its footnote disclosure. 
Financial reporting standards require companies to estimate the amount of deferred tax assets they may 
never use. This account is similar to the “allowance for doubtful accounts” associated with Accounts 
Receivable that you learned about in Chapter 6. In that case, management made an estimate of the uncol-
lectible accounts in accounts receivable. It then subtracted that estimate from gross accounts receivable 
to arrive at net accounts receivable reported on the balance sheet. The valuation allowance associated 
with deferred tax assets works in the same way: Management makes an estimate of the amount it thinks 
is likely to be “unusable” and then subtracts that estimate from the asset reported on the balance sheet.

intends to depreciate the car using an accelerated method in the following manner: Year 1 = $12,600; 
Year 2 = $6,300; Year 3 = $2,100. Will the difference in depreciation methods result in Over Armour

The Importance of Understanding Tax Disclosures
Companies pay taxes with cash. If you were an uninformed reader of Under Armour’s finan-
cial statements and footnotes, you might incorrectly assume that Under Armour paid the IRS 
cash for the full $74,661 thousand tax expense listed on its 2012 income statement. As an 
informed reader, you now know that accounting income is different from tax income, and as a 
result, the tax expense listed on Under Armour’s 2012 income statement does not reflect the 
amount of cash the company paid for taxes. Under Armour reports on its 2012 cash flow state-
ment that “cash paid for income taxes” was $57,739 thousand. Having a clearer understanding 
of how taxes affect a company’s cash position allows you to make more informed judgments 
about the company’s current and future financial health. In addition, knowledge (even cursory 
knowledge) about the differences between financial reporting and tax reporting allow you to 
better understand why management may be differentially concerned about its tax obligation to 
the IRS and the tax expense reported on the income statement.
As summarized in Exhibit S.7, when expenses for financial reporting exceed expenses for tax reporting, the 
company recognizes a deferred tax liability.

BE NEFITS  OVERVIEW
This section discusses two additional important long-term liabilities: pensions and other post-
retirement benefits. Companies typically offer employees pension plans and other postretire-
ment benefits as a component of their compensation. A pension is an amount of money paid 
to a retired employee. There are two general types of pension plans: defined contribution plans 
and defined benefit plans.
Defined Contribution Plans
Defined contribution pension plans are what virtually all new companies establish for their 
employees and what most established companies with defined benefit plans are switching 
to over time. Defined contribution plans simply require companies to contribute a defined 
amount every year to a retirement fund (which is often managed by a third party); it does 
not make any promises about what will be available from the fund when an employee retires. 
Thus, all of the risk associated with the retirement fund resides with the employee. Accounting 
for defined contribution plans is quite simple. Under Armour offers a defined contribution 
plan to its employees. If we assume that Under Armour promises to contribute 2 percent of an

Defined Benefit Plans
Under a defined benefit pension plan, a company defines the benefits available to employ-
ees upon retirement and assumes the risk associated with making sure those benefits are avail-
able when employees retire. The total liability associated with a defined benefit plan varies and 
depends on many factors, all of which a company has to take into account when determining how 
much to contribute to the retirement fund in any given year. Factors include rates of return on 
fund assets, the number of employees covered by the plan, the ages of employees and when they 
are likely to retire and start receiving benefits, how long employees are likely to receive benefits 
(stated differently, when the employees are likely to die), future compensation levels, and so on. 
This is a lot to think about, let alone accurately predict! That is why companies often hire actuar-
ies to help them estimate these factors. Actuaries are statisticians who specialize in assessing 
various risks and probabilities. Given all the factors that must be considered under a defined 
benefit plan, and how these factors can cause wide swings in a company’s pension expense dur-
ing volatile economic times, you can see why companies today favor defined contribution plans.
Calculating pension expense under a defined benefit plan is quite complex. We will not go 
through a detailed example, but rather will discuss the typical components that make up a com-
pany’s pension expense. We will also discuss how a company calculates the value of its pro-
jected pension obligation and pension plan assets under a defined benefit plan. Following each 
discussion, we will examine how Eli Lilly and Company discloses its retirement obligations 
under a defined benefit plan. We cannot examine how Under Armour discloses this informa-
tion because Under Armour does not offer its employees a defined benefit pension plan. Eli 
Lilly is a large pharmaceutical company based in Indianapolis, Indiana.
Under a defined benefit pension plan, pension expense for a given period typically consists 
of the following components:
Pension expense components
+
Service cost (additional pension benefits earned by employees during the period)
+
Interest cost (interest that has accrued on the pension liability during the period)
-
Expected return on pension plan assets (estimated)
-
Amortization of prior service costs (only exists if a company has amended its pension plan)
+/- Other (typically minor)
=
Pension expense
Companies seldom report their defined benefit pension expense as a distinct line item on 
their income statements. Instead, they typically include it in an account such as “Sales,  
General, 
and Administrative Expense.” They do, however, disclose the expense and its components in 
their pension footnote. Exhibit S.11 shows Eli Lilly’s footnote disclosure.

A company’s defined benefit pension plan is underfunded if its pension plan liability is 
greater than its pension plan assets, and it is overfunded if its pension plan assets are greater 
than its pension plan liability. Eli Lilly’s plan was underfunded in 2011 and 2012. Exhibit S.12 
shows what Eli Lilly discloses in its pension footnote with respect to its pension plan obligation 
and pension plan assets.

Other Postretirement Obligations
In addition to pension benefits, many companies also cover at least a portion of retired 
employees’ health care and insurance costs. Estimating the liability associated with these 
benefits, along with the asset needed to satisfy the liability, is similar to estimating a com-
pany’s pension plan obligation and pension plan assets under a defined benefit pension plan. 
Since the appropriate accounting methods are also essentially the same, we will not cover 
them in detail. Just be aware that some companies provide a breakdown in their footnotes of 
their other postretirement obligations along with their pension obligations. Eli Lilly is one 
such company. Exhibit S.13 shows the calculation of the company’s retiree health benefit 
expense. This information is provided in the same footnote in which Eli Lilly discusses its 
pension plan obligations.5
The Importance of Understanding Pension and Other  
Postretirement Obligation Disclosures
Like taxes, companies typically satisfy pension and other postretirement obligations with cash. 
For some companies, these commitments are substantial. For example, in its 2012 annual 
report, General Motors reported pension and other postretirement liabilities of $35 billion. 
This liability exceeded $54 billion prior to General Motors’s reorganization in 2009. Under-
standing General Motors’s employee retirement obligation is critical to understanding the 
health (or lack thereof) of the company and its future cash commitments.
It is also important for you to keep in mind the subjectivity inherent in many of the estimates 
required to calculate retirement-related expenses, liabilities, and assets. For example, calculat-
ing pension expense in a given period requires an estimate of the expected return on plan assets. 
The expected return acts to reduce pension expense. If a company’s expected return is overly 
optimistic, its pension expense will be understated. Having an understanding of how compa-
nies calculate pension and other postretirement expenses allows you to make more informed 
decisions about a company’s current and future financial health.
5Unlike pensions, companies are not legally required to set aside assets to fund their other postretirement obligations. 
Eli Lilly does, but you may encounter other companies that provide information about their postretirement expenses 
without showing any “plan assets” to satisfy their other postretirement obligations. These firms fund their programs 
on a “pay-as-you-go” basis.

After studying this supplement you should be able to:
S-1 Distinguish between operating and capital leases.  p. 2
For accounting purposes a company can lease an asset by signing either an operating lease or a 
capital lease. Signing a capital lease requires the company to recognize a lease asset and a lease 
liability on its balance sheet. The lease asset and lease liability are depreciated (some use the term 
“amortized”) over the life of the lease. Signing an operating lease does not require the company to 
recognize an asset or liability, but rather to simply recognize rent expense at the end of each period.
S-2 Define a leasehold improvement.  p. 3
Leasehold improvements are modifications that a lessee makes to a leased property. Companies 
depreciate leasehold improvements over the life of a lease, or over the life of the improvement if it 
is shorter than the life of the lease.
S-3 Analyze the impact of accounting for leases on a company’s financial statements.  p. 8
In their footnotes, companies disclose much of the information analysts need to convert a compa-
ny’s operating leases (which do not impact liabilities on the balance sheet) to capital leases (which 
do impact liabilities on the balance sheet). Analysts carry out this conversion in order to better 
assess a company’s total set of future financial obligations.
S-4 Explain why income tax expense reported on the income statement does not typically equal 
taxes paid to the Internal Revenue Service.  p. 11
For financial reporting purposes, companies follow generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP) when preparing financial statements for submission to the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission. For tax reporting purposes, companies follow the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) when pre-
paring tax returns for submission to the Internal Revenue Service. Differences in GAAP and the 
IRC create differences in the tax expense reported on a company’s income statement and the tax 
obligation reported on the company’s tax return.
S-5 Define deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.  p. 12
A deferred tax asset is an asset created by deferring a tax benefit to a future period. A deferred tax 
liability is a liability created by deferring a tax obligation to a future period. Both deferred tax assets 
and deferred tax liabilities are created by companies reporting revenues and expenses in different 
periods for financial reporting purposes rather than for tax purposes.
S-6 Distinguish between a defined benefit and a defined contribution pension plan.  p. 17
A defined contribution pension plan requires a company to contribute a defined amount to a retire-
ment fund; it does not make any promises about what will be available from the fund when an 
employee retires. A defined benefit pension plan requires a company to contribute an estimated 
amount to a retirement fund in order to provide a defined set of benefits in the future. Under a 
defined benefit plan, the risk associated with making sure those benefits are available when employ-
ees retire resides with the company, not the employee.
S-7 Define other postretirement obligations.  p. 20
Many companies cover at least a portion of retired employees’ health care and insurance costs. 
Benefits other than pension benefits are typically referred to as “other postretirement obligations.” 
Estimating the liability associated with these benefits, and the assets needed to satisfy the liability, 
is very similar to estimating a company’s pension plan obligation and pension plan assets under a 
defined benefit pension plan.

Intel Corporation is leasing an office building for three years. Terms of the lease require Intel to make 
a $5,000 rental payment at the end of each month over the life of the lease. Assuming an annual discount 
rate of 10 percent, what is the present value of this lease?
Computing the Present Value of a Lease
Microsoft Corporation is leasing an office building for four years. Terms of the lease require Microsoft 
to make a $20,000 rental payment at the end of each year over the life of the lease, as well as a lump-sum 
payment at the end of the lease of $10,000. Assuming an annual discount rate of 5 percent, what is the 
present value of this lease?

lease is also a five-year lease. It requires Apple to make a lump-sum payment of $120,000 at the end of 
the lease. Assume that for both leases interest accrues monthly and the appropriate annual discount rate

Computing the Present Value of a Future Retirement Obligation
Costco Corporation has agreed to pay employees who have worked for the company more than 10 years 
a retirement bonus of $20,000 upon retirement. Rick Jamison has worked for Costco for 15 years. Costco 
estimates that Rick will retire in seven years. If interest accrues quarterly and Costco can earn an annual 
return on deposits of 3 percent, how much would Costco have to deposit today in order to have exactly 
$20,000 to pay Rick at the end of seven years?

Recording Rent Expense
Amazon Corporation signed a five-year operating lease on January 1 to rent a distribution center. Rent 
payments of $10,000 are due at the end of each month. Prepare the journal entry to record the payment 
of cash for rent on January 31.
Depreciating Leasehold Improvements
At the beginning of its first fiscal quarter, Caribou Coffee signed a five-year lease for retail space in the 
Ithaca Mall. Before opening the space, Caribou made various leasehold improvements, one of which was 
to build a new coffee counter where customers can watch baristas make their espresso drinks. The cost 
to build the coffee counter was $12,500, which Caribou paid for with cash. The counter is expected to 
provide benefits for the duration of the lease. Caribou depreciates equipment on a quarterly basis using 
the straight-line method of depreciation. Prepare the journal entry to record the depreciation of the coffee 
counter at the end of the first quarter. Assume that Caribou takes a full quarter of depreciation during the 
first quarter.

Analyzing Disney’s Income Tax Disclosures
The following questions pertain to Disney’s 2012 financial statements and income taxes footnote shown 
below.
 1. How much did Disney report as income tax expense in fiscal 2012? How much cash did Disney pay 
during the year for income taxes? In general, why do these numbers differ?
 2. What is Disney’s 2012 statutory tax rate? What is its 2012 effective tax rate? In general, why do 
these rates differ?
 3. Why does Disney deduct a “valuation allowance” from its net deferred tax liability in its income tax 
footnote?
 4. Disney reports a net deferred tax liability of $1,486 million in fiscal 2012. How is this amount 
reflected on Disney’s balance sheet?
 5. In its income taxes footnote, speculate as to why Disney reports “depreciable, amortizable and other 
property” as a deferred tax liability rather than a deferred tax asset.

The valuation allowance principally relates to tax attributes of $193 million acquired with UTV and a 
$584 million deferred tax asset for the noncontrolling interest share of net operating losses at the Inter-
national Theme Parks. The ultimate recognition of the noncontrolling interest share of the net operating 
losses, which have an indefinite carryforward period, would not have an impact on net income attribut-
able to Disney as any income tax benefit would be offset by a charge to noncontrolling interests in the 
income statement.
