Environmental Protection Hints
Disposal of Old Equipment and Batteries (Applicable only for European Union and Countries with a Recycling
System)
The disposal of our products and possible recycling of their components after decommissioning has to be
carried out by an accredited recycling company, or the products/components must be taken to applicable
collection points. Such disposal activities must comply with all local laws, guidelines and environmental
specifications of the country in which the disposal is done. For the European Union the sustainable disposal of
electronic scrap is defined in the respective regulation for "waste electrical and electronic equipment" (WEEE).
The crossed-out wheelie bin on the products, packaging and/or accompanying documents means
that used electrical and electronic products and batteries must not be mixed with normal house-
hold waste.
According to national legislation, penalties may be charged for incorrect disposal of such
waste.
By disposing of these products correctly you will help to save valuable resources and prevent any potential
negative effects on human health and the environment.
i
i
NOTE
Our products and batteries must not be disposed of as household waste. For disposing batteries it is
necessary to observe the local national/international directives.
Disposal of Mobile Storage Devices (e.g. USB Sticks and Memory Cards)
When disposing of/transferring mobile storage devices, using the format or delete functions only changes the
file management information and does not completely delete the data from your mobile storage device. When
disposing of or transferring a mobile storage device, Siemens strongly recommends physically destroying it
or completely deleting data from the mobile storage device by using a commercially available computer data
erasing software.

67N Directional Ground-Fault Detection
Overview of Function
The directional overcurrent and derived ground-fault detection (67N) are used to provide discriminative
graded detection when the fault current flows in either direction.
Structure of the Function
The directional function produces forward and reverse outputs for use with the derived ground-fault function.
These outputs can be mapped as controls to each Definite Time Lag (DTL) and Inverse Definite Minimum Time
(IDMT) functions.
If a detection function is set as non-directional, then it operates independently of the output of the direc-
tional detector. However, if a detection function is programmed for the forward directional mode, then
operation occurs only for a fault lying within the forward operate zone. Conversely, if a detection function
is programmed for the reverse directional mode, then operation occurs only for a fault lying within the
reverse operate zone. Typically the forward direction is defined as being away from the busbar or towards the
measuring element. In addition to these, if a detection function is set as bidirectional, then it operates the
directional element dependent on the fault region.
The ground-fault detection (67N) has group-dependent settings which are different in each settings group
with the group numbers 1 and 2.
The ground-fault detection (67N) is characterized by the following:
•
The neutral voltage is calculated and used as a polarizing voltage.
•
The function operates with a directional definite-time overcurrent stage and with a directional inverse-
time overcurrent stage.
The calculated neutral-point displacement voltage is taken as the polarizing voltage for direction determina-
tion. The Characteristic angle is the phase angle by which the polarizing voltage must be adjusted
such that the directional detector gives maximum sensitivity in the forward operate zone when the current
is in phase with it. The reverse operate zone is the mirror image of the forward zone. For a solidly grounded
system, the Characteristic angle can be user-programmed to an angle between -60° and +0° in steps
of 15° using the Characteristic angle. The voltage is the reference phasor (Vref) and the Character-
istic angle is added to this to adjust the forward and reverse zones.

The Minimum voltage defines the minimum polarizing-voltage level. Where the calculated polarizing
voltage is below this level, no directional output is given and the operation of detection stages set as
directional will be inhibited. A minimum time delay of 2 cycles is necessary for 67N to exist and to allow the
device to indicate the fault. The Neutral-point treatment can be set to solid, isolated, and resonant.

Non-Directional Intermittent Ground Fault
Overview of Function
A typical characteristic of intermittent ground faults is that they often extinguish automatically and strike
again after some time. The fault duration can last between a few milliseconds and many seconds. Thus, such
faults are not detected at all or not selectively by the ordinary overcurrent detection. If pulse durations are
extremely short, not all devices in a short-circuit path can pick up. Thus, selective tripping is not ensured.
Due to the time delay of the overcurrent detection, such faults are too short to initiate switching off the
faulty cable. The short-circuit protection can clear such ground faults selectively only if the ground faults have
become permanent.
The non-directional intermittent ground-fault detection is used to protect against intermittent ground faults
which occur in cables due to poor insulation or water ingress in cable joints.
Structure of the Function
The intermittent ground fault has group-dependent settings and is different in each settings group with group
numbers 1 and 2.
With the parameter Fault pickup current, you set the threshold value of the ground current, measured
as RMS value. A rather sensitive setting is possible to respond also to short ground faults since the pickup time
shortens as the ground-fault current increases.
With the parameter Nos det., you set the number of counted pickup signals after which the ground fault is
considered as intermittent.
You can get a stabilized pickup signal with the parameter T det. ext.. This stabilization is especially
important for the coordination with existing static or electromechanical overcurrent detections.
With the parameter Time reset, you can define the maximum interval between 2 adjacent ground faults.
If the interval is larger than the time reset, the counter and integrator are reset. The parameter Time reset
must be much higher than the operate value of the parameter Time sum.
The duration of the stabilized pickups is summated with an integrator Time sum. If the accumulated pickup
time reaches a settable threshold value, then the intermittent ground-fault time is operated. The operate
signal is active only while the rated current is above the threshold.
The inrush current can be detected by a high percentage of 2nd harmonic current content by the 81HBL2
function. Inrush blocking can be configured to inhibit the non-directional intermittent ground-fault
detection automatically.

Directional Intermittent Ground Fault
Overview of Function
The directional intermittent ground-fault detection:
•
Detects the intermittent ground faults in grounded, compensated, or isolated cable systems selectively
The intermittent ground faults in cable systems are frequently caused by weak insulation or water ingress in
cable joints. The ground faults are characterized by the following properties:
•
Intermittent ground faults show short high ground-current pulses (up to several hundred amperes) with
a duration of less than 1 ms.
•
Intermittent ground faults are self-extinguishing and reignite within onehalf period up to several periods,
depending on the power-system conditions and the fault type.
•
Intermittent ground faults can persist over longer periods (several seconds to minutes) and develop
to static ground faults. Such intermittent ground faults are frequently caused by weak insulation. For
example, due to decreased water resistance of old cables.
Structure of the Function
The intermittent ground fault has group-dependent settings which are different in each settings group with
the group numbers 1 and 2.
Where direction elements are present, the direction of operation can be set using the parameter Direction
setting.
3 direction settings are provided independently for each intermittent ground fault:
•
Forward
•
Reverse
•
Bidirectional
Pickup is initiated once the calculated neutral-point displacement voltage is detected above the Minimum
voltage threshold. Direction determination is done using the phase relationship between the calculated
neutral-point displacement voltage and the calculated neutral-point current values.
The Characteristic angles are used and linked with the neutral-point treatment, similar to the
67N function.
The parameter Direction setting defines whether the function operates in forward or in reverse direc-
tion. The pulses in the specified direction are counted. If the pulse counter reaches the threshold value set in
the parameter Number of pulses, the function operates .
The directional pulse counter is reset under the following conditions:
•
A different direction than the set direction is detected. An undefined direction result does not reset the
counter.
•
The parameter Monitor time has elapsed. No other pulse in the set direction was detected during that
time. This time can be understood as a criterion for the disappearing of the intermittent fault.
•
V0 is lower than the minimum voltage (V0) and the monitoring time has expired.
The inrush current can be detected by a high percentage of 2nd harmonic current content by the 81HBL2
function. The Inrush blocking can be configured to inhibit the directional intermittent ground-fault
function automatically.

Ground-Fault Detection with Cos φ/Sin φ Measurement
Overview of Function
In resonant-grounded/isolated systems, fault current due to a ground-fault current is negligible. Measuring the
active part of the current (resonant-grounded) or the reactive part of the current (isolated system) ensures
proper direction determination even for smaller current magnitudes.
Structure of the Function
Each ground fault stage 50N-1, 50N-2, and 51N has independant watt-metric stages. The Idir setting allows to
enable/disable the watt-meric block in each stage.
The ground-fault detection with the cos φ/sin φ measurement method is used to detect the ground fault
based on the active part of the current (resonant system) or reactive part of the current (isolated system).
The ground-fault detection with the cos φ/sin φ measurement method is enabled when the Idir (user-settable
parameter for the resistive part of the ground current) parameter is configured to the values as in Table 4-1. If
Idir is set to 0, the device detects the ground fault based on the vector method.
The ground-fault detection with cos φ/sin φ measurement method is only applicable for resonant-grounded
systems and isolated-grounded systems.
If the ground current ((IN>) and the resistive current exceed the set threshold (IN> and Idir), then the device
indicates a fault with a time delay of the respective stage is expired.
If Idir is set to 0 (vector method), irrespective of the selected ground-type connection, the total ground current
is compared with the set current IN> for fault detection.
For resonant-ground connections, if Idir is not 0 (ground-fault detection with cos φ/sin φ measurement
method), the active part of the ground current is compared with Idir in addition to the total ground current and
IN> for ground-fault detection.
For isolated-ground connections, if Idir is not 0 (ground-fault detection with cos φ/sin φ measurement
method), the reactive part of the ground current is compared with Idir in addition to the total ground current
and IN> for ground-fault detection.
The following table displays the Idir range and the ground-fault detection with cos φ/sin φ measurement

Determination of the Ground-Fault Phase
Overview
The phase in which the voltage falls below uv.ph.thr (undervoltage phase threshold for
ground fault) is identified as faulty phase, as long as the other 2 phase-to-ground voltages simultaneously
exceed ov.ph.thr (overvoltage phase threshold for ground fault).
uv.ph.thr must be set to less than the minimum expected operational phase-to-ground voltage.
ov.ph.thr must be greater than the maximum expected operational phase-to-ground voltage.

Pulse-Location Detection
Overview of Function
The Pulse-location detection mechanism detects a faulty feeder during a permanent ground fault
in overcompensated systems. The Pulse-location detection mechanism is applicable for resonanlt-grounded
systems only and not applicable to the undercompensated systems.
Structure and Logic of the Function
The ground fault with the pulse-location detection has group-dependent settings that are different in each
settings group with group numbers 1 and 2.
Figure 4-10 shows a simplified network with the pulse-location detection mechanism. The pulse pattern in the
ground current IN is generated by switching on and off a capacitor in parallel to the arc-suppression coil:
•
When the capacitor is switched on, an additional capacitive ground current is generated and the ground-
current compensation changes.
•
When the capacitor is switched off, the additional capacitive ground current no longer exists and the
ground-current compensation returns to the normal state.

The Figure 4-11 shows the ground-current pulse pattern in an overcompensated system for a low-impedance
ground fault and a high-impedance ground fault.
•
For low-impedance ground faults, the pulse pattern exists only in the faulty feeder.
•
For high-impedance ground faults, the pulse pattern is also present in the healthy feeders with lower
amplitude but in phase opposition to the faulty feeder.
Using different values of the parameters Pulse-on duration (TPulse ON) and Pulse-off
duration (TPulse OFF), the differentiation between healthy and faulty feeders for high-impedance
ground faults can be ascertained.

Ground-Current Pulse Pattern in an Overcompensated System
For the faulty feeder, the ground-current pulse pattern is as follows:
•
When the clocking pulse is on, the capacitor is switched on, the ground current in the faulty feeder is
reduced, and the corresponding current pulse pattern is off.
•
When the clocking pulse is off, the capacitor is switched off, the ground current in the faulty feeder is
increased, and the current pulse pattern is on.

With the Pulse-on duration and Pulse-off duration parameters, you can define the switch-on and
switch-off duration of the capacitor. These values must be set according to the operation of the clocking
device that determines the switch-on and switch-off duration of the capacitor. If you set these 2 parameters
to the same value or to similar values, there is a risk of failure. This is the case because the stage cannot
distinguish the healthy and faulty feeders by only evaluating the ground current during a high-impedance
ground fault.
Number of Pulses for Operate (PulseTh Op.) is defined as the number of pulses to be detected
within the pulse monitoring time.
Number of Pulses for Monitoring (PulseTh Mon.) is defined as the number of pulses to be
considered for calculating the pulse monitoring time.
The pulse monitoring time is calculated via the following formula:
Pulse monitoring time = Number of Pulses for Monitoring (PulseTh Mon.) ⋅ (TPulse ON +
TPulse OFF)
If the measured Pulse-on duration and Pulse-off duration is equal to the configured TPulse ON
and TPulse OFF, then a valid pulse is detected. If the number of detected pulses within the pulse monitoring
time reaches the setting of the Number of Pulses for Operate (PulseTh Op.), then the ground
fault is detected.

Directional Transient Ground-Fault Detection
Overview of Function
A ground fault in resonant/isolated grids starts with a transient process, this process is typically within millisec-
onds range. Such transient occurrences are called transient ground faults. In order to detect the ground-fault
direction, based on these transient occurrences, a special method of measurement is required that can also
capture high frequency samples (> 6.6 kHz). The transient charging process is evaluated by a zero-sequence
active power and an energy-integrating method to determine the ground-fault direction. This method ensures
high sensitivity and positive stability against parasitic signals in the zero-phase sequence system.
Structure of the Function
The directional transient ground-fault detection has group-dependent settings which are different in each
settings group with the group numbers 1 and 2.
Measurement Method
The V0 threshold (zero-phase sequence voltage) is calculated and the 3I0 threshold value (zero-phase
sequence current) is calculated from the phase variables (Figure 4-12).
The instantaneous values of the zero-phase sequence voltage V0 that are sampled at a high frequency (9.6
kHz) serve to determine the point in time of the Operate delay (ground-fault occurrence T0).
The instantaneous values of the zero-phase sequence voltage V0 and the 3I0 Threshold value, which are
sampled at a high frequency (6.6 kHz), are the basis for direction determination.
The fundamental-component values of the zero-phase sequence voltage V0 serve to release the directional
result and the pickup as well as a criterion for the stabilization against switching operations.
If the positive-phase sequence current value exists, then the measured value serves as an additional criterion
for the stabilization against switching operations.
The fundamental-component value of V0 and 3I0 is used for the pickup and the optional trip logic.
Operational zero-phase sequence currents can occur in closed loops or meshed systems. This type of zero-
phase sequence current is also present in case of a failure and can falsify the directional result. Therefore, an
operational zero-phase sequence current is eliminated.
Directional Ground-Fault Signal Pickup
Determining the time of the ground-fault ignition and the direction is always done with maximum sensitivity.
With the parameters V0 threshold value and 3I0 threshold value, you define the sensitivity for
the indication of the direction and the pickup of the stage. If both of the following conditions are met, the
direction result will be reported:
•
The fundamental-component value of the zero-phase sequence voltage V0 exceeds the V0 threshold
value within 100 ms after detecting the ground-fault ignition.
•
The RMS fundamental value of the zero-phase sequence current 3I0 exceeds the 3I0 threshold value.
Stabilization against Switching Operations
Switching operations in the system to be protected can cause transient signals in the zero-phase sequence
system. The stage is stabilized against possible overfunction due to switching operations (Figure 4-13).

45
E50417-H8940-C602-A2, Edition 07.2024


The following mechanisms are applied:
•
For reporting the direction result, the fundamental-component value of the zero-phase sequence voltage
must exceed the V0 threshold value in a time slot of 100 ms after the ground-fault ignition. This
effectively suppresses wrong indications as a result of switching operations.
•
The fundamental-component value of the zero-phase sequence voltage V0 is not influenced by switching
operations and is thus a good criterion for distinguishing the ground fault from a switching procedure.
The condition that the fundamental-component value must exceed the V0 threshold value for
reporting the direction result effectively suppresses the influence of switching operations.
For rare cases in which high zero-phase sequence voltages occur over longer time ranges after switching
off the feeder or line, a criterion based on the positive-phase sequence current is also effective. This
criterion compares the positive-phase sequence current before and after the transient event and thus
detects a disconnection. In case of disconnection, the direction result is not reported. Through stabiliza-
tion mechanisms, the direction result is reported 100 ms after the ground-fault ignition. Thus a pickup
occurs with a 100-ms delay.
•
The function detects transient ground faults using the zero-phase sequence voltage. In systems with
operational zero-phase sequence voltages, if the measuring voltage is switched on, the function can
internally be started. If the fundamental-component value of the zero-phase sequence voltage does not
exceed the threshold of the maximum operation V0 parameter in a time slot of 100 ms after the
function start, the function is reset internally.
Parameter Notes
The following parameters must be configured:
•
Trans. grnd. fault: Disabled/Enabled
This parameter is used to allow the element to be switched on and off if it is not required.
•
V0 Threshold
The V0 threshold parameter value defines the sensitivity for the indication of the direction and the
pickup voltage. The sensitivity of the direction determination itself is not influenced. The direction deter-
mination always works with maximum sensitivity. If high-resistive ground faults must also be reported,
very sensitive settings are possible.
•
Max Operation V0
The Max Operation V0 parameter defines the maximum operational zero-sequence voltage V0. If the
fundamental-component value of the zero-phase sequence voltage V0 does not exceed the parameter
Maximum operational V0 in a time slot of 100 ms after the function has started, the stage is reset.
The setting is made with reference to the zero-phase sequence voltage V0 according to the network
structure.
•
3I0 Threshold Value
The 3I0 threshold value parameter defines the sensitivity for the indication of the direction and
the pickup current. In ring or meshed systems, you can use this parameter to reduce the number of
ground-fault reporting devices. Set the parameter according to your experience on the specific network.
For radial systems, you can keep the default value of 0 A which sets this parameter to inactive.
•
3I0 Threshold for Operate
The setting is significant only for an optional trip logic for switching off permanent ground faults. Select
the setting such that the static ground-fault current exceeds the threshold value. You can disable this
criterion by setting the value to 0 A.
•
Operate Delay
The Operate delay parameter determines the time during which the pickup conditions must be met
to issue the operate indication. The operate indication is issued when this time expires. The setting of
the Operate delay depends on the specific application. Ensure that the pickup is delayed by 100 ms
regarding the time of the ground-fault ignition.

•
Dropout Delay
The Dropout delay allows you to use the function also as a protection against intermittent-ground
faults. With the parameter dropout delay, the dropout of the pickup state after fault extinction is
delayed or held until the next ignition. Thus, the operate delay can go on and trip the fault. Set the
time to a value within which the new ignition can still be assigned to the previous fault. Typical values
are in a range between several hundred milliseconds and a few seconds.

67 Directional Phase-Fault Detection
Overview of Function
The directional phase-fault detection (67) is used to:
•
Detect short circuits in electric equipment
•
Ensure selective fault detection for parallel lines or transformers with infeed at one end
•
Ensure selective fault detection in cable runs with infeed at both ends or in lines connected to form ring
topologies
Structure of the Function
The directional phase-fault detection (67) has group-dependent settings which are different in each settings
group with the group numbers 1 and 2.
The directional phase-fault detection (67) is characterized by the following:
•
The voltage measurement is based on the minimum voltage.
•
The function operates with a directional definite-time and with directional inverse-time overcurrent
stages.
The directional phase-fault detection produces forward and reverse outputs with overcurrent detection. These
outputs can be mapped as controls to DTL and IDMT functions. If the function is set as non-directional,
then the detection operates independently of the directional detector output. However, if the function is
configured for the forward directional mode, then the detection occurs only for a fault lying within the
forward operate zone. Conversely, if the function is configured for the reverse directional mode, then the
detection occurs only for a fault lying within the reverse operate zone. Typically, the forward direction is
defined as being away from the busbar or towards the protection zone. In addition, if the function is set as
bidirectional, then the operation of the measuring element is dependent on the fault region.
The minimum voltage defines the minimum polarizing voltage level. If the calculated polarizing voltage is
below the voltage level, then the directional output is not detected and the operation of the direction is
inhibited. The minimum polarizing voltage required for the direction determination is set to 10 % of the rated
voltage.
•
The voltage polarization is achieved for the phase-fault stages using the quadrature voltage, when a unity
power factor I leads V by 90°. Each phase current is compared to the voltage between the other 2 phases,
for example: for clockwise phase sequence ABC: IA ∼ VBC, IB ∼ VCA, IC ∼ VAB
•
The voltage is the reference phasor (Vref) and the Characteristic angle is added to adjust the
forward and reverse zones.
The minimum time delay of 2 cycles is necessary for directional phase-fault detection (67) to exist and to allow
the device to indicate the fault.
The Characteristic angle is the phase angle by which the polarizing voltage must be adjusted in such
a way that the direction gives maximum sensitivity in the forward operate zone and aligns with the phase
current. The reverse operate zone is the mirror image of the forward zone. The characteristic angles in the
device can be set to 0° to 60° (Δ 15°) with the parameter Characteristic angle.
The center of the forward zone is set by (Vref Angle + 67 Char Angle) and must be set to correspond with the
angle for the maximum sensitivity:
•
For a fault current of -60° (I lagging V by 60°), a Characteristic angle of +30° is required for the
maximum sensitivity (due to quadrature connection 90° - 60° = 30°).
•
For a fault current of -45° (I lagging V by 45°), a Characteristic angle of +45° is required for the
maximum sensitivity (due to quadrature connection 90° - 45° = 45°).

27 Undervoltage Alarm and Warning
Overview of Function
The undervoltage alarm and warning (27) is used to:
•
Monitor the permissible voltage range and provide alarms for values below normal limits.
•
Decouple or reconfigure changeover systems when loss of supply is detected.
•
Selectively disconnect loads (load shedding) to match generation capacity following a loss of generation
which can be detected by undervoltage.
Undervoltages are typically caused by loss of generation, overload of lines or removal of lines from service,
voltage controller failure at the transformer and error during control operations.
Structure of the Function
The undervoltage alerts are enabled when the system voltage falls below the user-defined setting (27
undervoltage alarm setting/27 undervoltage warning setting).
•
The setting alarm/warning is defined in percentage of the rated primary voltage.
•
The time delay is a verification time where any phase-to-ground voltage is below the set alarm/
warning and greater than alarm/warning guard. After this time delay, the undervoltage alarm/
warning is indicated and the event is logged.
•
The hysteresis is a percentage of an alarm/warning setting.
•
The alarm/warning guard is a percentage of the rated primary voltage.
Voltage Alert Occurrence
If any phase-to-ground voltage falls or exceeds the user-defined threshold value, then an alarm is displayed
on the device HMI and an event is logged and the alert counter gets incremented as well. In this scenario, the
device HMI shows the faulty phases. The event log via the device HMI provides the phase-to-ground voltage
magnitude in all 3-phases.
Alert Restoration
If phase-to-ground voltages are below/above the user-defined hysteresis, then the alert screen disappears
automatically. New events are logged only once after the alert restoration and events of the same phase are
not logged again before restoration.

59 Overvoltage Alarm and Warning
Overview of Function
The function overvoltage alarm and warning (57) is used to:
•
Monitor the primary system voltage and provide alarms for values outside of normal limits by monitoring
the 3-phase voltage inputs.
•
Protect equipment (for example: plant components and machines) against insulation failure due to
overvoltage.
•
Decouple or reconfigure changeover systems due to overvoltage (for example: wind power supply or
parallel sources).
Overvoltages are typically caused by a loss of connection to the load or a sudden reduction in load, voltage-
controller failure at the transformers, and an error during control operations.
Abnormally high voltages in power systems are typically caused by:
•
Transformer or generator voltage controller malfunction
•
Incorrect switching or control operations on long lines under low-load conditions
•
Following load shedding or island operation or disconnected generators
Overvoltages can be caused by resonances between capacitor banks and line or transformer inductances.
Structure of the Function
The overvoltage alerts (59) are enabled when the system voltage rises above the user-defined setting alarm/
warning setting.
•
The setting alarm/warning is defined in percentage of the rated primary voltage.
•
The time delay is a verification time where any phase-to-ground voltage is above the set alarm/
warning. After this time delay, the overvoltage alarm/warning is indicated and the event is logged.
•
The hysteresis is a percentage of a setting alarm/warning.
Voltage Alert Occurrence
If any phase-to-ground voltage exceeds the user-defined threshold value, then an alarm is displayed on the
device HMI, an event is logged, and an alert counter gets incremented. In this scenario, the device HMI shows
the faulty phases. The event log via the device HMI provides the phase-to-ground voltage magnitude in all
3-phases.
Alert Restoration
If phase-to-ground voltages are below/above the user-defined hysteresis and more than the reset delay, then
the alert screen disappears automatically. New events are logged only once after the alert restoration and
events of the same phase are not logged again before restoration.

warning setting, 59 overrvoltage alarm setting, and 59 overvoltage warning
setting closer to the primary voltage and if a frequency change occurs (> 0.2 Hz), then a false

Overcurrent Alarm and Warning
Overview of Function
The function overcurrent alarm and warning is used for the overload applications.
Structure of the Function
The function overcurrent alarm and warning is applicable to the phase currents I1, I2, and I3 only.
If the system current exceeds the user-defined setting alarm/warning and persists for a user-defined time
delay, then overcurrent alerts are enabled.

Open-Phase Detection
Overview of Function
The Open-phase detection is used to detect an open-circuit condition when a conductor breaks or a
maloperation occurs in phase-segregated switchgear. If there is a minor or no fault current, then overcurrent
elements do not detect the open-phase condition. However this condition can be detected when there is a
high Negative Sequence (NPS) current or unbalance current present.
If the phase is on less load and the NPS current is less than the full load steady-state unbalance arising from
CT errors and load unbalance, then a simple NPS element does not operate. With such faults, a measurable
amount of zero-sequence current can be produced, but even this is not sensitive enough to detect the
open-phase condition.
Structure of the Function
The open-phase detection has a group-dependent settings and is different in each settings group with
group numbers 1 and 2.
To detect such a fault, it is necessary to evaluate the ratio of Negative Sequence (NPS) current to Positive
Sequence (PPS) current, since this ratio is nearly constant with variations in load current and allows a more
sensitive setting to be achieved.
i
i
NOTE
Practically, this minimum setting is governed by the levels of standard NPS current present in the system.
To ensure that all 1-phase loads are included in a maximum system load condition, this current can be
determined from a system study or measured during commissioning.
The I2/I1 ratio is the Negative Sequence (NPS) current to Positive Sequence (PPS) ratio.
The Time delay is a verification time for which the I2/I1 (NPS/PPS) ratio must be greater than the set
threshold. After this time delay, the open-phase fault is indicated and the event is logged.
The U/C guard is a percentage of the rated primary current. If U/C Guard is 0, then the open-phase
detection is based on the I2/I1 ratio.
i
i
NOTE
•
The Open-phase detection is dependent on the time delay to prevent operation of transient
effects.
•
To ensure the open-phase detection does not operate incorrectly during low-load conditions, the
open-phase fault must be inhibited by configuring the 46BC U/C guard setting to the required value
in %.
•
The minimum load current required for reliable operation of open-phase detection is 5 A.
Parameter Notes

This parameter defines the I2/I1 ratio for the open-phase detection.
Time delay

Phase-Sequence Monitoring
Overview of Function
The phase sequence of the measured phase-to-ground voltages is checked by monitoring the angle difference
between phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase voltages.
SICAM FCM plus monitors the phase sequence of voltage signals from voltage sensors and displays it on
the HMI/Modbus. The phase-sequence monitoring algorithm uses measured phase-to-ground voltage and
phase-to-phase voltage angles in balanced condition. For monitoring the phase sequence, the threshold
voltage is at least 50 % of the primary voltage.
If the phase sequence is clockwise, then it is denoted as ABC. Similarly if the phase sequence is counter-clock-
wise, then it is denoted as ACB. The monitored phase sequence is also displayed as 2 discrete inputs in the
Modbus register.
The following phasor diagram shows the clockwise and counter-clockwise phase sequences:
[dw_sfcm-phasesequence, 1, en_US]
Figure 4-22
Clockwise and Counter-Clockwise Phase Sequences
In the HMI, the status of the phase sequence is shown as PH SEQ: ABC or PH SEQ: ACB or ---, if the phase
sequence cannot be determined.
If the phase sequence is ABC, then the discrete input (66) of the Modbus register is set to 1.
If the phase sequence is ACB, then the discrete input (67) of the Modbus register is set to 1.
If the phase sequence is not detected, then the discrete inputs (66, 67) of the Modbus registers are set to 0.
If the phase-to-ground voltage is below the threshold voltage, then the phase sequence is displayed as --- on
the HMI and the Modbus register is set to 0.
If there are any device alerts and a fault is detected in the system, then the phase sequence is displayed as ---
on the HMI and the Modbus register is set to 0.

The detection functions implemented in SICAM FCM plus are designed for clockwise phase sequence only.

P, Q Sign
Overview of Function
The P,Q sign parameter is used to reverse the sign of active power (P) and reactive power (Q) for all phases.
The P,Q sign parameter cannot be configured for individual phases.
If the P,Q sign parameter value is set to not reversed, the sign of active power (P) and reactive power
(Q) for all phases indicates the original active power (P) and reactive power (Q). If the P,Q sign parameter
value is set to reversed, the signs of active power (P) and reactive power (Q) for all phases get reversed.
The P,Q sign parameter is independent of the power-flow direction parameter. The P,Q sign parameter
affects the total active power (P) and reactive power (Q). The P,Q sign parameter does not affect the
power-flow direction, fault direction, current angle, and power factor for all phases. It also does not affect the
watt-metric ground current.
For more information about the P,Q sign parameter, refer to Table A-8.

Fault Indication in Absence of Auxiliary Power Supply
Overview of Function
If there is an auxiliary power supply failure after the fault detection, then the device can still indicate the fault
via the Fault LED. The device starts the blinking Fault LED at a defined time interval. After a defined time
interval, the Fault LED starts blinking.
If the USB is connected to the device, then the fault alert is displayed on the HMI and the fault is indicated
from the Fault LED.
In absence of USB power, the fault indication is available from the Fault LED only.
In absence of auxiliary power supply:
•
The duty cycle of the Fault LED is 1 % (on-time) of 20 ms.
•
The fault reset can only be done in presence of auxiliary power supply.
•
If the fault is detected and then auxiliary power supply is failed, then the Fault LED will blink for 8 h.
–
Once the device is powered-on, the device must have an uninterrupted power supply for minimum
1 h to blink the Fault LED for the next 8 h.

Event Logs
The device stores 50 faults as event logs on the non-volatile memory. The event logs consist of fault values
and time stamps up to a resolution of 1 ms. The event log is designed as a First-in First-out (FIFO que) where
the new fault always overwrites the oldest stored event.
The device health and diagnostic events are also saved. In Modbus for the device error events – the current,
voltage, and temperature values are logged as 0. In the HMI, the message Device error MCU reset is
displayed without showing the phase-current values.

Communication Failure Monitoring
Overview of Function 
The communication failure monitor is configured to monitor the queries from the master for the
configured interval. If no queries are received within this configured time interval, then Communication
Failure (CF) is indicated on device HMI (Figure 4-24).
[dw_sfcmcommfailure, 3, en_US]
Figure 4-24
Communication Failure (CF) and Invalid Time (IV)
You can set the communication failure time to a specific time interval (0 ms to 600 000 ms) from
the device HMI, the FCM plus configurator, and the Modbus holding register (Address 5). If the Modbus
communication is not established, then CF is displayed on the device HMI irrespective of the configured time.
This condition is observed when the communication failure time is non-zero and the device reboots.
By default, the communication failure time is disabled using the Modbus holding register (Address 5).
Refer to A.2 Implementation of the Modbus Protocol.
On every communication failure, if no query is received within the configured time interval, then the
communication-failure counter is incremented (Modbus input register – Address 1106). The reset failure
counter can be reset only when the device is powered on or using a Modbus data coil (Address 12).
i
i
NOTE
•
The communication failure monitor is not efficient below 500 ms.
•
When the communication failure time is disabled (value 0 ms), you cannot reset the communi-
cation failure counter.
•
You must set a communication failure time value greater than the response delay time
value. Refer to 4.28.1 Overview of Function.

Response Delay Time
Overview of Function
The response delay time is used to delay the response from SICAM FCM plus for every Modbus query
by a configured time (ms). This configured time is added to the default response delay time which is

Time Synchronization
Time Synchronization (RTC Synchronization)
SICAM FCM plus has an internal real-time clock (RTC) for time synchronization. To get an external time
synchronization, the device must be synchronized with the Modbus master with the current system time. The
device needs a time synchronization, when it resumes from the sleep mode to ensure the correct time and
date. Also the time synchronization is required when the device is powered on after 8 h of sleep mode.
i
i
NOTE
If the parameter time sync interval is enabled, then the RTC must be synchronized via Modbus after
every power-up.
The RTC must be synchronized as per user-configured time sync interval (0 h to 24 h) with a valid time
stamp. This time sync interval can be set from the device HMI, the SICAM FCM Configurator, and the
Modbus holding register (Address 9). The default time sync interval is 24 h and can be set from 0 h to
24 h with intervals of 1 h. The time sync interval (Address 8) is disabled when the parameter is set to 0.
The holding register (Address 9) allows you to set the time sync interval via Modbus communication.
SICAM FCM plus keeps monitoring the time-sync query until the configured interval2. If no time-sync query is
received within the configured time or time synchronization fails, then an invalid time status IV is indicated on
device HMI, time-sync holding register, and Modbus discrete input (Address 4). Refer to A.2 Implementation
of the Modbus Protocol.

DO and DI Configuration
Overview DO Configuration
SICAM FCM plus has 4 configurable digital outputs (DO). The DOs can be configured for either detection
function or for control operation, refer to Table 4-4. If DO is configured for both detection function and
control operation, then output is controllable from DO control operation only.
DOs are configured via Modbus only:
•
If the holding register is set to 0, then DOs are configured to detection function.
•
If the holding register is set to 1, then DOs are configured to control operation.

Self-Reset
The DO remains operated until the current flow is interrupted. If the fault current is removed, then the DO is
reset.
•
If the auto reset is disabled, then configure the self-reset DO to reset the device.
Hand Reset
If you configure the DO as hand reset, then the DO can be reset by any of the reset mechanisms. For more
information on reset mechanism, refer to 4.26.1 Overview.
•
If the auto reset is enabled, then configure hand reset DO to reset the device.
•
Hand reset can be done from the device HMI, Modbus, and by auto-reset timer.
The DO configuration operates properly:
•
If the auto reset is disabled, then ensure that the DO is configured in self-reset mode.
•
If the auto reset is enabled, then ensure that the DO is configured in hand reset mode.
i
i
NOTE
•
Minimum operation time of the DO is 100 ms. If the fault is restored in less than 100 ms, then the DO
will be latched at-least for 100 ms.
•
Whenever a DO configuration is initialized, the fault detection is re-initialized.
•
DI/DO configuration is supported from Modbus and Configuration tool via USB.
•
It is not recommended to change the function settings and DO configuration during live fault condi-
tion. In case you want to change the configuration during live fault condition, contact Siemens
customer support.
Detection Function
If DO is configureed as a detection function, then DOs can be configured to any fault detection functions,
device health status, and digital inputs. For more information, refer to Table 4-4.
Control Operation
DO1, DO2, DO3, and DO4 are used for control operation and are controlled from HMI or Modbus. For

DO Control Operation
DO Control Overview
SICAM FCM plus has 4 configurable digital outputs (DOs). You can control the state of these DOs through the
HMI, Modbus holding registers, and SICAM FCM Configurator tool. You can also turn the DO to ON/Close and
OFF/Open.
When you turn the DO to ON/Close, the device logs a Digital Output Operate event. This event is
viewed in the HMI event list, Modbus3, and SICAM FCM Configurator tool.
When you switch on the DO from the device HMI or Modbus, the signal stays on until the time set for the DO
reset delay has elapsed. Each DO has a separate user-configurable reset delay which allows control and
timing of the DOs.
The operation of the DO control is secured with a password, both from the device HMI and Modbus. This
ensures that only authorized persons can operate the digital output control.
Each DO is assigned with a Reset delay. For more information on Modbus holding registers, refer to
Table A-8.
i
i
NOTE
•
A DO must be configured for either control operation or for detection functions. If a DO is configured
for both control operation or detection functions, then the DO will operate for control functions only.
•
Configuring a DO as a control operation or a detection function reinitializes the DO module. Reconfi-
guring the Reset delay time also reinitializes the DO module.
–
If a DO is already configured for a detection function and is in the closed position, then the DO
will be opened when you reassign any DO to a control function.
–
If a DO is mapped for control function and is in closed position, then DO gets opened after
reinitialization.
i
i
NOTE
•
If the auxiliary power supply is not available, then you cannot operate the DO in USB mode.
•
A DO can only be configured from Modbus. If permission is given from Modbus, the DO can be
operated from the HMI.
•
You cannot change DO control password on Modbus.
DO configuration for control operation with holding register address 40734 is used to configure DO1 to DO4.
If the holding register is set to 1, then DO is configured for control operation. If the holding register is set to 0,
then DO is configured for detection function.
The following table explains when holding registers are set to 0 and 1:

Correction Factor
The standards IEC 61869-10 and IEC 61869-11 allow to adjust the magnitudes and phases of current and
voltage sensors. If any inaccuracies are stable within the measuring range, then the overall accuracy of
sensors is improved by at least one accuracy class compared to the original class.
•
Sensors which specify individual correction factors on their labels and in routine tests can be configured
in SICAM FCM plus to improve system accuracy.
•
When using compatible sensors with SICAM FCM plus, you must configure the correction factors via HMI
or Modbus addresses. For more information on compatible sensors correction factors, refer to Table A-9.
For SIBushing sensor, you can only change the correction factors by loading a JSON file provided by the
SIBushing sensor manufacturer.
The correction factors are expressed in terms of magnitude and angular offset per phase of the voltage/
current. If you enable the Correction Factor parameter via HMI or Modbus, the device applies the
correction factor to improve the measuring accuracy of the sensor.
The following effects are occured if compatible sensors are used with SICAM FCM plus:
•
Device health and diagnostics for RTD tempetaure failure are not monitored.
•
On the device HMI, the temperatures T1, T2, T3 are shown as ---.
•
T1, T2, T3 Modbus input registers are shown as 0.

Modbus Registers
Modbus is a fieldbus which is used to exchange data between programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and
other devices. The communication protocol is based on the master/slave system over a serial line (RS485).
The Modbus master requests data from the slaves which are connected to the bus. The slaves answer to the
request from the master. The device works as Modbus Slave and supports communication via 2 wire RS485
from rear port. The message frame contains the following format:
•
Device address
•
Function code
•
8-bit data bytes
•
Error checking
The following Modbus data models are supported:
•
Bit type data
–
Discrete input
–
Coil
•
Register-type data
–
Input register
–

Date and Time
(Address 40010 to 40013) The format used for date and time complies with EN 60870-5-4. It consists of 4
successive registers for writing in one request. It uses the function code 16.
The device calculates the day of the week from the day of the month value (date). Hence the day of the week

Self-Test Mode
In SICAM FCM plus, the self-test mode feature can be enabled during the commissioning and when required.
The self-test mode is activated via any of the following:
•
HMI
•
RS485/Modbus interface
During the self-test mode, the device changes the values of all Modbus registers (except holding registers) and
provides an option to verify the Modbus registers in a sequential order as per the defined-time interval.
In the self-test mode, the correct mapping of all t-he available Modbus registers (excluding the holding
registers) at a Modbus master and control center can be tested in very convenient and fast manner. A Modbus
master can read out all the registers and provide them with a time stamp and forward the data to the control
center. In the control center, the received data can be arranged based on the time stamps and must have the
same order as per the following pre-defined self-test mode description.
The self test starts by verifying the hardware in the following sequence:
•
LED test
•
50-1, 50-2, 51, 50N-1, 50N-2, 51N
•
Intermittent ground fault
•
Pulse-location detection
•
Transient detection
•
Open-phase detection
•
Overvoltage and undervoltage alerts
•
Overcurrent alerts
•
Digital outputs
•
Discrete inputs
•
Input registers
•
Modbus status
During self-test operation, all the coil registers and the discrete input registers (except registers related to
self-test) are always reset.
The individual Modbus coil registers and the discrete input registers are set for a duration of 5 s and then
reset. After completion of the self-test, coil and discrete input registers display the real-time values.
During input-register test, all input registers are set with predefined known values for 5 s. The check using
the time stamp is not necessary as the predefined unique analog values can provide a check of the correct
mapping of the registers. All the input registers display individual measuring values again once the device
exits from the self-test mode. The self-test mode takes 9 min to 10 min to complete.
If the fault/actual DI high/DO close is detected during self-test, then the self-test is stopped. If the auxiliary
power supply is interrupted, the self-test is stopped and you can activate the self-test only when the device is
connected to the auxiliary power supply.

NOTE
The self-test feature is temporarily disabled in the following conditions:
•
The device is powered on with USB.
•
Any active fault indication persists in device.
•
DO is closed
•
