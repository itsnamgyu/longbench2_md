Roosevelt to accomplish two tasks : to avoid scarcity of critical commodities in a likely pre - war environment , and to limit the exportation of materiel to pre - entity4 World War II entity5 Imperial Japan . The act originated as a presidential proclamation by entity3 Roosevelt forbidding the exporting of aircraft parts , chemicals , and minerals without a license , and was intended to induce entity5 Japan to curtail its occupation of the entity6 Indo - entity7 Chinese coast . The text of the entity0 Act stated that whenever the President deemed it \" necessary in the interest of national defense , \" he could prohibit or curtail the exportation of military equipment , munitions , tools and materials . Although controls were first authorized in entity1 1940 in regard to munitions and similar materials essential to the defense effort , its coverage was extended in entity8 1942 to all commodities , and broader geographic coverage , following entity9 America 's entry into entity4 World War II . The law was extended , with modifications through entity10 1948 , and it was envisioned that remaining controls would soon disappear at the time of re - enactment in entity11 1949 . The scarcity of certain goods in the world markets however , made continuance of controls necessary in order to prevent a drain on such goods from plentiful entity12 American supplies with its consequential inflationary effects . National security and foreign policy concerns , especially following the outbreak of the entity13 Korean War , were new and compelling reasons for passing the entity0 Export Control Act of entity11 1949 , and in extending it until ( at least ) entity14 1958 . The law included both domestic policies aimed primarily at conditions within the entity2 United States , as well as controls directed at conditions outside the country , as an instrument of entity12 American foreign policy . This is exemplified by the restrictions on export of certain strategic or military items to the entity15 Soviet bloc or to other countries which it felt , if permitted , would be detrimental to the foreign policy program of the entity2 United States during the entity16 Cold War . The foreign policy motive became so strong that it brought legislation directing the President to enlist the cooperation of other nations in enacting controls on trade with the entity15 Soviet block to parallel those of the entity2 United States .

It was hoped that the album would cement the band 's popular and commercial success , building on their breakthrough into the entity1 UK Top 10 with their previous album entity4 All Around My Hat and its title track , which reached # 5 on the entity1 UK singles chart . Unfortunately , entity0 Rocket Cottage was a victim of bad timing - by the time it was released , the sudden explosion of the entity1 British Punk scene saw audience tastes in the entity1 UK rapidly shift away from formerly popular genres like folk rock and progressive rock , and groups that previously been critical favourites , like entity2 Steeleye Span and entity5 Yes , soon found themselves being derided as \" dinosaurs \" . entity6 Rocket Cottage failed to break into the Top 40 , and it was the last album recorded by the \" classic \" entity7 mid - Seventies lineup of the group , with entity8 Peter Knight and entity9 Bob Johnson both subsequently leaving the group . The album is perhaps the band 's most rock - influenced album , with very prominent guitars and a strong rhythm section . Some fans consider this one of the band 's best efforts , pointing to strong tracks like \" entity10 London \" , \" entity11 Fighting for Strangers \" , \" entity12 Sir James the Rose \" , and \" entity13 Orfeo / Nathan 's Reel \" , the first entity14 three of which became classics of the band and fan favorites . Others , however , find the album erratic , complaining that the band 's rhythm section tends to overwhelm the vocals , particularly on \" entity15 Orfeo \" , \" entity16 The Twelve Witches \" , and ( to a lesser extent ) \" entity17 The Brown Girl \" . Oddly for an instrumental piece , \" entity18 Nathan 's Reel \" simply fades out . The most peculiar decision was the inclusion of an unrehearsed version of \" entity19 Camptown Racetrack \" ; years later entity20 Maddy Prior remarked , \" I ca n't think what we were thinking of with that . \" This was the band 's ninth album in entity21 five years , and many feel that their exhaustion is evident . entity8 Peter Knight has said that the band was being pressured to write and adapt music for the commercial market , which led to considerable dissatisfaction among the band members .

Most of the bill focussed on the exchange of copyrighted works over peer - to - peer networks and the criminalizing of the circumvention of digital rights management ( entity14 DRM ) protection measures .
