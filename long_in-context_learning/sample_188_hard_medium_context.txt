• Your calculator is made up of precision components. Never try to take it apart.
• Avoid dropping your calculator and subjecting it to strong impact.
• Do not store the calculator or leave it in areas exposed to high temperatures or humidity, or large
amounts of dust. When exposed to low temperatures, the calculator may require more time to display
results and may even fail to operate. Correct operation will resume once the calculator is brought back
to normal temperature.
• The display will go blank and keys will not operate during calculations. When you are operating the
keyboard, be sure to watch the display to make sure that all your key operations are being performed
correctly.
• Replace both the main power supply and the memory back up batteries once every 2 years regardless
of how much the calculator is used during that period. Never leave dead batteries in the battery com-
partment. They can leak and damage the unit.
• Keep batteries out of the reach of small children. If swallowed, consult with a physician immediately.
• Avoid using volatile liquids such as thinner or benzine to clean the unit. Wipe it with a soft, dry cloth, or
with a cloth that has been dipped in a solution of water and a neutral detergent and wrung out.
• In no event will the manufacturer and its suppliers be liable to you or any other person for any damages,
expenses, lost profits, lost savings or any other damages arising out of loss of data and/or formulas
arising out of malfunction, repairs, or battery replacement. The user should prepare physical records of
data to protect against such data loss.
• Never dispose of batteries, the liquid crystal panel, or other components by burning them.
• When the “Low battery!” message appears on the display, replace the main power supply batteries as
soon as possible.
• Be sure that the power switch is set to OFF when replacing batteries.
• If the calculator is exposed to a strong electrostatic charge, its memory contents may be damaged or
the keys may stop working. In such a case, perform the All Reset operation to clear the memory and
restore normal key operation.
• Note that strong vibration or impact during program execution can cause execution to stop or can
damage the calculator’s memory contents.
• Using the calculator near a television or radio can cause interference with TV or radio reception.
• Before assuming malfunction of the unit, be sure to carefully reread this manual and ensure that the
problem is not due to insufficient battery power, programming or operational errors.

k Exponential Display
The calculator normally displays values up to 10 digits long. Values that exceed this
limit are automatically converted to and displayed in exponential format. You can
specify one of two different ranges for automatic changeover to exponential display.
Norm 1 ............ 10–2 (0.01) > |x|, |x| > 1010
Norm 2 ............ 10–9 (0.000000001) > |x|, |x| > 1010

uHow to interpret exponential format
1.2+12 indicates that the result is equivalent to 1.2 × 1012. This means that you should
move the decimal point in 1.2 twelve places to the right, because the exponent is
positive. This results in the value 1,200,000,000,000.
1.2–03 indicates that the result is equivalent to 1.2 × 10–3. This means that you should
move the decimal point in 1.2 three places to the left, because the exponent is nega-
tive. This results in the value 0.0012.

• A base 10 logarithm (common logarithm) is normally written as log10 or log.
• A base e (
) logarithm (natural logarithm) is normally
written as loge or ln.
Note that certain publications use “log” to refer to base e logarithms, so you must
take care to watch for what type of notation is being used in the publications you are
working with. This calculator and manual use “log” to mean base 10 and “ln” for base e.

k Calculation Priority Sequence
The calculation priority sequence is the order that the calculator performs opera-
tions. Note the following rules about calculation priority sequence.
• Expressions contained in parentheses are performed first.
• When two or more expressions have the same priority, they are executed from
right to left.
  Example
2 + 3 × (log sin2π2 + 6.8) = 22.07101691 (angle unit = Rad)
The following is a complete list of operations in the sequence they are performed.
1. Coordinate transformation: (Pol (x, y), Rec (r, θ); differential calculations: d/dx(;
List: Fill, Seq, Min, Max, Mean, Median, SortA, SortD
2. Type A functions (value input followed by function): x2, x–1, x!
sexagesimal input: ° ’ ”
3. Powers: ^ (xy); roots: x
4. Fraction input: a b/c
5. Multiplication operations where the multiplication sign before π or a variable is
omitted: 2π; 5A; 3sinx; etc.
6. Type B functions (function followed by value input):
, 3

k Using Multistatements
Multistatements are formed by connecting a number of individual statements for
sequential execution. You can use multistatements in manual calculations and in
programmed calculations. There are two different ways that you can use to connect
statements to form multistatements.
• Colon (:)
Statements that are connected with colons are executed from left to right, without
stopping.

k Stacks
When the calculator performs a calculation, it temporarily stores certain information
in memory areas called a “stacks” where it can later recall the information when it is
necessary.
There are actually two stacks: a 10-level numeric stack and a 26-level command
stack. The following example shows how data is stored in the stacks.
A calculation can become so complex that it requires too much stack memory and
cause a stack error (Stk ERROR) when you try to execute it. If this happens, try
simplifying your calculation or breaking it down into separate parts. See “How to
Calculate Memory Usage” for details on how much memory is taken up by various
commands.

Differential Calculations
• To perform differential calculations, first display the Option Menu, and then input
the values shown in the formula below.
K2(CALC)[
1(d/dx) f(x),a,∆x)
The differentiation for this type of calculation is defined as:
In this definition, infinitesimal is replaced by a sufficiently small ∆x, with the value in
the neighborhood of f ' (a) calculated as:
In order to provide the best precision possible, this unit employs central difference to
perform differential calculations. The following illustrates central difference.
The slopes of point a and point a + ∆x, and of point a and point a – ∆x in function
y = f(x) are as follows:
In the above, ∆y/∆x is called the forward difference, while ∇y/∇x is the backward
difference.T
o calculate derivatives, the unit takes the average between the value of
∆y/∆x and ∇y/∇x, thereby providing higher precision for derivatives.

• In the function f(x), only X can be used as a variable in expressions. Other vari-
ables (A through Z) are treated as constants, and the value currently assigned to
that variable is applied during the calculation.
• Input of ∆x and the closing parenthesis can be omitted. If you omit ∆x, the calcu-
lator automatically uses a value for ∆x that is appropriate for the value of x = a,
which you specified as the point for which you wanted to determine the deriva-
tive.
• Discontinuous points or sections with drastic fluctuation can adversely affect pre-
cision or even cause an error.
• Note that you cannot use differential calculation inside of a differential calculation
term.

• The existing value remains unchanged if you input a value outside the allow-
able range or in the case of illegal input (negative sign only without a value).
• Inputting a View Window range so the min value is greater than the max value,
causes the axis to be inverted.
• You can input expressions (such as 2π) as View Window parameters.
• When the View Window setting does not allow display of the axes, the scale for
the y-axis is indicated on either the left or right edge of the display, while that for
the x-axis is indicated on either the top or bottom edge.
• When View Window values are changed, the graph display is cleared and the
newly set axes only are displayed.
• View Window setting may cause irregular scale spacing.
• Setting maximum and minimum values that create too wide of a View Window
range can result in a graph made up of disconnected lines (because portions of
the graph run off the screen), or in graphs that are inaccurate.
• The point of deflection sometimes exceeds the capabilities of the display with
graphs that change drastically as they approach the point of deflection.
• Setting maximum and minimum values that create to narrow of a View Window

Table & Graph
The Table & Graph menu makes it possible to generate numeric
tables from functions stored in memory. You can also use multiple
functions to generate tables. Since Table & Graph uses the same
list of functions that the GRAPH Mode uses for graphing, there is
no need to input the same functions in different modes.
• You can specify the range and increment of values assigned to
variables for table value generation.
• You can assign list values to variables.
• In addition to graphing of stored functions, you can also plot table
values generated by Table & Graph itself.
• Table values can be assigned to a list.

• In this example, values are assigned automatically.
This display shows the generated numeric table. Though this example display shows
only the values for function Y1, values for function Y3 were also generated.
Each cell can hold up to six digits (negative sign takes up one digit).
You can move the cursor around the table using the cursor (f, c, d, e) keys.
The following points apply to cursor position and movement.
• The value contained in the currently selected cell appears at the bottom of the
display, with all current display attributes (number of decimal place, number of
significant digit, and exponential display range settings) applied.
• Moving the cursor off the screen causes the table to scroll when there are cells
off the top, bottom, left, or right .
• When the cursor is located in any function value cell (Y1, Y2, etc.), the function is
shown at the top of the display.
• If you change a value in column X, the corresponding function value is automati-
cally updated using the new value for X.

Table and Graph
Graphing a table whose values were generated using more than one function causes
the graphs of all the functions to be drawn at the same time. You can set x- and y-
axis parameters using the View Window.
Press u or A to return to the numeric table screen from a graph. Pressing u
again goes back to the graph. You can use u to switch between the graph and its
table as long as you do not clear the graph.
7. Assigning Numeric Table Contents to
a List
You can assign a column of values from a table into a list. Simply use d and e to
move the cursor into the column whose values you want to copy. The cursor can be
in any row of the column. The copy operation is performed by pressing K to dis-
play the Option Menu, and then pressing 2 (LMEM).
K1(LIST)2(LMEM)
Use the first function menu to copy the column’s values to List 1 (1) to List 4 (4).
To copy to List 5 or List 6, press [ and then 1 (List 5) or 2 (List 6).

2. The prompt “How Many Lists? (H)” appears to ask how many lists you want to
sort. Here we will input 1 to indicate we want to sort only one list.
bw
3. In response to the “Select List (L)” prompt, input the number of the list you want to
sort. Here we will input 2 to specify sorting of List 2.
cw
The values in List 2 are sorted into ascending order.


86
Chapter 6
List Function
Descending order
Use the same procedure as that for the ascending order sort. The only difference is
that you should press 2 (SRT-D) in place of 1 (SRT-A).
u
u
u
u
uTo sort multiple lists
You can link multiple lists together for a sort so that all of their cells are rearranged in
accordance with the sorting of a base list. The base list is sorted into either ascend-
ing order or descending order, while the cells of the linked lists are arranged so that
the relative relationship of all the rows is maintained.
Ascending order
1. While the lists are on the screen, press 1 (SRT-A).
1(SRT-A)
2. The prompt “How Many Lists? (H)” appears to ask how many lists you want to
sort. Here we will sort one base list linked to one other list, so we should input 2.
cw
3. In response to the “Select Base List (B)” prompt, input the number of the list you
want to sort into ascending order. Here we will specify List 1.
bw
4. In response to the “Select Second List (L)” prompt, input the number of the list
you want to link to the base list. Here we will specify List 2.
cw
The values in List 1 are sorted into ascending order, and the cells of List 2 are also
rearranged to keep the same relationship with the List 1 cells.
Descending order
Use the same procedure as that for the ascending order sort. The only difference is
that you should press 2 (SRT-D) in place of 1 (SRT-A).

3. Manipulating List Data
List data can be used in arithmetic and function calculations. There is also a collec-
tion of powerful list data manipulation functions that let you do the following.
• Count the number values (Dim)
• Replace all cell values with the same value (Fill)
• Generate a sequence of numbers (Seq)
• Find the minimum value in a list (Min)
• Find the maximum value in a list (Max)
• Find which of two lists contains the smallest value (Min)
• Find which of two lists contains the greatest value (Max)
• Calculate the mean of list values (Mean)
• Calculate the mean of values of specified frequency (Mean)
• Calculate the median of values in a list (Med)
• Calculate the median of values of specifies frequency (Med)
• Calculate the sum of values in a list (Sum)
You can use list data manipulation functions in the RUN, STAT, LIST, TABLE, or
PRGM Mode.

• This chapter contains a number of graph screen shots. In each case, new data
values were input in order to highlight the particular characteristics of the graph
being drawn. Note that when you try to draw a similar graph, the unit uses data
values that you have input using the List function. Because of this, the graphs
that appears on the screen when you perform a graphing operation will prob-
ably differ somewhat from those shown in this manual.

2. General graph settings (SET)
This section describes how to use the general graph settings screen to make the
following settings for each graph (GPH1, GPH2, GPH3).
• Graph Type
The initial default graph type setting for all the graphs is scatter graph. You can select
one of a variety of other statistical graph types for each graph.
• List or Data
The initial default statistical data is  List 1 for single-variable data, and List 1 and List
2 for paired-variable data. You can specify which statistical data list you want to use
to draw the graph.
• Frequency
Normally, each data item or data pair in the statistical data list is represented on a
graph as a point. When you are working with a large number of data items however,
this can cause problems because of the number of plot points on the graph. When
this happens, you can specify a frequency list that contains values indicating the
number of instances (the frequency) of the data items in the corresponding cells of
the lists you are using for x-data and y-data. Once you do this, only one point is
plotted for the multiple data items, which makes the graph easier to read.
• Mark Type
This setting lets you specify the shape of the plot points on the graph.

k Box Graph
This type of graph lets you see how a large number of data items are grouped within
specific ranges. A box encloses all the data in an area from the first quartile (Q1) to
the third quartile (Q3), with a line drawn at the median (Med). Lines (called whiskers)
extend from either end of the box up to the minimum and maximum of the data.
From the statistical data list, press 1 (GRPH) to display the graph menu, press
[4 (SET), and then change the graph type of the graph you want to use (GPH1,

power regression formula is y = a × xb, so if we take the logarithms of both sides we
get logy = loga + b × logx. Next, if we say X = log x, Y = logy, and A = loga, the
formula corresponds to linear regression formula Y = A + bX.

3. Debugging a Program
A problem in a program that keeps the program from running correctly is called a
“bug,” and the process of eliminating such problems is called “debugging.” Either of
the following symptoms indicates that your program contains bugs and that debug-
ging is required.
• Error messages appearing when the program is run
• Results that are not within your expectations
u
u
u
u
uTo eliminate bugs that cause error messages
An error message, like the one shown below, appears whenever something illegal
occurs during program execution.
When such a message appears, press d or e to display the location where the
error was generated, along with the cursor. Check the “Error Message Table” for
steps you should take to correct the situation.
• Note that pressing d or e will not display the location of the error if the pro-
gram is password protected.
u
u
u
u
uTo eliminate bugs that cause bad results
If your program produces results that are not what you normally expect, check the
contents of the program and make necessary changes. See “Editing Program Con-
tents” for details on how to change program contents.
4. Calculating the Number of Bytes Used
by a Program
This unit comes with 20,000 bytes of memory. A byte is a unit of memory that can be
used for storage of data.
There are two types of commands: 1-byte commands and 2-byte commands.
• Examples of 1-byte commands: sin, cos, tan, log, (, ), A, B, C, 1, 2, etc.
• Examples of 2-byte commands: Lbl 1, Goto 2, etc.
While the cursor is located inside of a program, each press of d or e causes the
cursor to move one byte.
• You can check how much memory has been used and how much remains at any
time by selecting the MEM icon in the Main Menu and entering the MEM Mode.
See “Memory Status (MEM)” for details.

k Basic Operation Commands
? (Input Command)
Function: Prompts for input of values for assignment to variables during program
execution.
Syntax: ? → <variable name>
Example: ? → A _
Description:
1. This command momentarily interrupts program execution and prompts for input
of a value or expression for assignment to a variable. When the input command is
executed, “?” to appears on the display and the calculator stands by for input.
2. Input in response to the input command must be a value or an expression, and
the expression cannot be a multi-statement.
^
^
^
^
^ (Output Command)
Function: Displays and intermediate result during program execution.
Description:
1. This command momentarily interrupts program execution and displays alpha
character text or the result of the calculation immediately before it.
2. The output command should be used at locations where you would normally
press the w key during a manual calculation.
: (Multi-statement Command)
Function: Connects two statements for sequential execution without stopping.
Description:
1. Unlike the output command (^), statements connected with the multi-statement
command are executed non-stop.
2. The multi-statement command can be used to link two calculation expressions or
two commands.
3. You can also use a carriage return indicated by _ in place of the multi-statement
command.
_
_
_
_
_ (Carriage Return)
Function: Connects two statements for sequential execution without stopping.


145
Programming
Chapter 8
Description:
1. Operation of the carriage return is identical to that of the multi-statement com-
mand.
2. Using a carriage return in place of the multi-statement command makes the dis-
played program easier to read.

k Program Commands (COM)
If~Then
Function: The Then-statement is executed only when the If-condition is true (non-
zero).
Syntax:
Parameters: condition, numeric expression
Description:
1. The Then-statement is executed only when the If-condition is true (non-zero).
2. If the condition is false (0), the Then-statement is not executed.
3. An If-condition must always be accompanied by a Then-statement. Omitting the
Then-statement results in an error (Syn ERROR).
Example: If A = 0 _
Then ”A = 0”
If~Then~IfEnd
Function: The Then-statement is executed only when the If-condition is true (non-
zero). The IfEnd-statement is always executed: after the Then-statement is executed
or directly after the If-condition when the If-condition is false (0).
Syntax:
Parameters: condition, numeric expression
Description:
This command is almost identical to If~Then. The only difference is that the IfEnd-
statement is always executed, regardless of whether the If-condition is true (non-
zero) or false (0).
Example: If A = 0 _
Then ”A = 0” _

If~Then~Else
Function: The Then-statement is executed only when the If-condition is true (non-
zero). The Else-statement is executed when the If-condition is false (0).
Syntax:
Parameters: condition, numeric expression
Description:
1. The Then-statement is executed when the If-conditions is true (non-zero).
2. The Else-statement is executed when the If-conditions is false (zero).
Example: If A = 0 _
Then ”TRUE” _
Else ”FALSE”
If~Then~Else~IfEnd
Function: The Then-statement is executed only when the If-condition is true (non-
zero). The Else-statement is executed when the If-condition is false (0). The IfEnd-
statement is always executed following either the Then-statement or Else-statement.
Syntax:
Parameters: condition, numeric expression
Description:
This command is almost identical to If~Then~Else. The only difference is that the
IfEnd-statement is always executed, regardless of whether the If-condition is true
(non-zero) or false (0).
Example: ? → A _

For~To~Next
Function: This command repeats everything between the For-statement and the
Next-statement. The starting value is assigned to the control variable with the first
execution, and the value of the control variable is incremented by one with each
execution. Execution continues until the value of the control variable exceeds the
ending value.
Syntax:
Parameters:
• control variable name: A to Z
• starting value: value or expression that produces a value (i.e. sin x, A, etc.)
• ending value: value or expression that produces a value (i.e. sin x, A, etc.)
Description:
1. When the starting value of the control variable is greater than the ending value,
execution continues from the statement following Next, without executing the state-
ments between For and Next.
2. A For-statement must always have a corresponding Next-statement, and the Next-
statement must always come after its corresponding For-statement.
3. The Next-statement defines the end of the loop created by For~Next, and so it
must always be included. Failure to do so results in an error (Syn ERROR).
Example: For 1 → A To 10_
A × 3 → B_
B ^
Next
For~To~Step~Next
Function: This command repeats everything between the For-statement and the
Next-statement. The starting value is assigned to the control variable with the first
execution, and the value of the control variable is changed according to the step
value with each execution. Execution continues until the value of the control variable
exceeds the ending value.
Syntax:
Parameters:
• control variable name: A to Z
• starting value: value or expression that produces a value (i.e. sin x, A, etc.)
• ending value: value or expression that produces a value (i.e. sin x, A, etc.)
• step value: numeric value (omitting this value sets the step to 1)

Description:
1. This command is basically identical to For~To~Next. The only difference is that
you can specify the step.
2. Omitting the step value automatically sets the step to 1.
3. Making the starting value less than the ending value and specifying a positive
step value causes the control variable to be incremented with each execution.
Making the starting value greater than the ending value and specifying a negative
step value causes the control variable to be decremented with each execution.
Example: For 1 → A To 10 Step 0.1_
A × 3 → B _
B ^
Next
Do~LpWhile
Function: This command repeats specific commands as long as its condition is true
(non-zero).
Syntax:
Parameters: expression
Description:
1. This command repeats the commands contained in the loop as long as its condi-
tion is true (non-zero). When the condition becomes false (0), execution pro-
ceeds from the statement following the LpWhile-statement.
2. Since the condition comes after the LpWhile-statement, the condition is tested
(checked) after all of the commands inside the loop are executed.
Example: Do_
? → A_
A × 2 → B_
B ^
LpWhile B >10
While~WhileEnd
Function: This command repeats specific commands as long as its condition is true
(non-zero).
Syntax:
Parameters: expression


149
Programming
Chapter 8
Description:
1. This command repeats the commands contained in the loop as long as its condi-
tion is true (non-zero). When the condition becomes false (0), execution pro-
ceeds from the statement following the WhileEnd-statement.
2. Since the condition comes after the While-statement, the condition is tested
(checked) before the commands inside the loop are executed.
Example: 10 → A_
While A > 0_
A – 1 → A_

k Program Control Commands (CTL)
Break
Function: This command breaks execution of a loop and continues from the next
command following the loop.
Syntax: Break _
Description:
1. This command breaks execution of a loop and continues from the next command
following the loop.
2. This command can be used to break execution of a For-statement, Do-state-
ment, and While-statement.
Example: While A>0_
If A > 2_
Then Break_
IfEnd_
WhileEnd_
A ^
← Executed after Break
Prog
Function: This command specifies execution of another program as a subroutine. In
the RUN Mode, this command executes a new program.
Syntax: Prog ”file name” _
Example: Prog ”ABC” _
Description:
1. Even when this command is located inside of a loop, its execution immediately
breaks the loop and launches the subroutine.
2. This command can be used as many times as necessary inside of a main routine
to call up independent subroutines to perform specific tasks.


150
Chapter 8
Programming
3. A subroutine can be used in multiple locations in the same main routine, or it can
be called up by any number of main routines.
D
C
E
I
J
Prog ”E”
Prog ”I”
Prog ”J”
A
Prog ”D”
Prog ”C”
4. Calling up a subroutine causes it to be executed from the beginning. After execu-
tion of the subroutine is complete, execution returns to the main routine, continu-
ing from the statement following the Prog command.
5. A Goto~Lbl command inside of a subroutine is valid inside of that subroutine only.
It cannot be used to jump to a label outside of the subroutine.
6. If a subroutine with the file name specified by the Prog command does not exist,
an error (Go ERROR) occurs.
7. In the RUN Mode, inputting the Prog command and pressing w launches the
program specified by the command.
Return
Function: This command returns from a subroutine.
Syntax: Return _
Description:
Execution of the Return command inside a main routine causes execution of the
program to stop.
Example: Prog ”A”
Prog ”B”
1 → A_
For A → B T
o 10_
Prog ”B”_
B + 1 → C_
C ^

Return
Executing the program in File A displays the result of the operation (11).
Stop
Function: This command terminates execution of a program.
Syntax: Stop _
Description:
1. This command terminates program execution.
2. Execution of this command inside of a loop terminates program execution with-
out an error being generated.

k Jump Commands (JUMP)
Dsz
Function: This command is a count jump that decrements the value of a control
variable by 1, and then jumps if the current value of the variable is zero.
Syntax:
Parameters:
Variable Name: A to Z
[Example] Dsz B : Decrements the value assigned to variable B by 1.
Description:
This command decrements the value of a control variable by 1, and then tests (checks)
it. If the current value is non-zero, execution continues with the next statement. If the
current value is zero, execution jumps to the statement following the multi-statement
command (:), display command (^), or carriage return (_).
Example: 10 → A : 0 → C :
Lbl 1 : ? → B : B+C → C :
Dsz A : Goto 1 : C ÷ 10
This program prompts for input of 10 values, and then calculates the
average of the input values.
Goto~Lbl
Function: This command performs an unconditional jump to a specified location.
Syntax: Goto <value or variable> ~ Lbl <value or variable>
Parameters: Value (from 0 to 9), variable (A to Z)
Description:
1. This command consists of two parts: Goto n (where n is a value from 0 to 9) and
Lbl n (where n is the value specified for Goto). This command causes program
execution to jump to the Lbl-statement  whose value matches that specified by
the Goto-statement.
2. This command can be used to loop back to the beginning of a program or to jump
to any location within the program.

3. This command can be used in combination with conditional jumps and count
jumps.
4. If there is no Lbl-statement whose value matches that specified by the Goto-
statement, an error (Go ERROR) occurs.
Example: ? → A : ? → B : Lbl 1 :
? → X : A × X + B ^
Goto 1
This program calculates y = AX + B for as many values for each variable that you
want to input. T
o quit execution of this program, press A.
Isz
Function: This command is a count jump that increments the value of a control
variable by 1, and then jumps if the current value of the variable is zero.
Syntax:
Parameters:
Variable Name: A to Z
[Example] Isz A : Increments the value assigned to variable A by 1.
Description:
This command increments the value of a control variable by 1, and then tests (checks)
it. If the current value is non-zero, execution continues with the next statement. If the
current value is zero, execution jumps to the statement following the multi-statement
command (:), display command (^), or carriage return (_).
⇒ (Jump Code)
Function: This code is used to set up conditions for a conditional jump. The jump is
executed whenever the conditions are false.
Syntax:
Parameters:
left side/right side: variable (A to Z), numeric constant, variable expression (such as:
A × 2)

Programming
Chapter 8
Description:
1. The conditional jump compares the contents of two variables or the results of two
expressions, and a decision is made whether or not to execute the jump based
on the results of the comparison.
2. If the comparison returns a true result, execution continues with the statement
following the ⇒ command. If the comparison returns a false result, execution
jumps to the statements following the multi-statement command (:), display com-
mand (^), or carriage return (_).
Example: Lbl 1 : ? → A :
A > 0 ⇒ 
A ^
Goto 1
With this program, inputting a value of zero or greater calculates and displays the
square root of the input value. Inputting a value less than zero returns to the input
prompt without calculating anything.

the screen you sent and restart the send operation before you can send addi-
tional data.
• You cannot use 6mm wide tape to print a screen shot of a graph.
7. Data Communications Precautions
Note the following precautions whenever you perform data communications.
• An error occurs whenever you try to send data to a receiving unit that is not yet
standing by to receive data. When this happens, press A to clear the error and
try again, after setting up the receiving unit to receive data.
• An error occurs whenever the receiving unit does not receive any data approxi-
mately six minutes after it is set up to receive data. When this happens, press A
to clear the error.
• An error occurs during data communications if the cable becomes disconnected,
the parameters of the two units do not match, or if any other communications
problem occurs. When this happens, press A to clear the error, then correct the
problem before trying data communications again. If data communications are
interrupted by the A key operation or an error, any data successfully received
up to the interruption will be in the memory of the receiving unit.
• An error occurs if the receiving unit memory becomes full during data communi-
cations. When this happens, press A to clear the error and delete unneeded
data from the receiving unit to make room for the new data, and then try again.
• To send picture (graph) memory data, the receiving unit need 1-kbytes of memory
for use as a work area in addition to the data being received.

Before using the Program Library
• Be sure to check how many bytes of unused memory are remain-
ing before attempting to perform any programming.
• This Program Library is divided into two sections: a numeric cal-
culation section and a graphics section. Programs in the numeric
calculation section produce results only, while graphics programs
use the entire display area for graphing. Also note that calcula-
tions within graphics programs do not use the multiplication sign
(×) wherever it can be dropped (i.e. in front of open parenthesis).

Prime Factor Analysis
Description
Produces prime factors of arbitrary positive integers
For 1 < m < 1010
Prime numbers are produced from the lowest value first. “END” is displayed at the end
of the program.
(Overview)
m is divided by 2 and by all successive odd numbers (d = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, ....) to check
for divisibility.
Where d is a prime factor, mi = mi–1/d is assumed, and division is repeated until
mi + 1 < d.
Example
[1]
119 = 7 × 17
[2]
440730 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 59 × 83

Program for
t-Test Value
Description
The mean (sample mean) and sample standard deviation can be used to obtain a t-test value.
x
: mean of x data
xσn–1 : sample standard deviation of x data
n
: number of data items
m
: hypothetical population standard deviation (normally repre-
sented by µ, but m is used here because of variable name
limitations)
Example
To determine whether the population standard deviation for sample data 55, 54, 51,
55, 53, 53, 54, 52, is 53.
Perform a t-test with a level of significance of 5%.

The above operation produces a t-test value of t(53) = 0.7533708035. According to the t-distribution
table in the next page, a level of significance of 5% and a degree of freedom of 7 (n – 1 = 8 – 1 = 7)
produce a two-sided t-test value of approximately 2.365. Since the calculated t-test value is lower
than the table value, the hypothesis that population mean m equals 53 is accepted.

tangent line
With this program, slope m and intercept b (= y' – mx') are obtained for lines drawn from point
A (x', y') and are tangent to a circle with a radius of r. The trace function is used to read out the
coordinates at the points of tangency, and factor zoom is used to enlarge the graph.
Example
T
o determine m and b for the following values:
r = 1
x'= 3
y'= 2
Notes
• The point plotted for A cannot be moved. Even if it is moved on the graph, the calculation is
performed using the original value.
• An error (Ma ERROR) occurs when r = x'.
• Be sure to always perform a trace operation whenever you select trace and the message
TRACE is on the display.
Preparation and operation
• Store the program written on the next page.
• Execute the program as shown below.

• Performing the RESET operation while an internal calculation is being per-
formed will cause all data in memory to be deleted. Make sure that no calcula-
tion be being performed before starting a RESET operation.
• If the calculator stops operating correctly for some reason, use a thin, pointed
object to press the P button on the back of the calculator. This should make the
RESET confirmation screen appear on the display. Perform the procedure to

Appendix B
Power Supply
This unit is powered by two AAA-size (LR03 (AM4) or R03 (UM-4)) batteries. In addi-
tion, it uses a single CR2032 lithium battery as a back up power supply for the memory.
If the following message appears on the display, immediately stop using the calcula-
tor and replace batteries.
If you try to continue using the calculator, it will automatically switch power off, in
order to protect memory contents. You will not be able to switch power back on until
you replace batteries.
Be sure to replace the main batteries at least once every two years, no matter how
much you use the calculator during that time.
Warning!
If you remove both the main power supply and the memory back up batteries at the
same time, all memory contents will be erased. If you do remove both batteries,
correctly reload them and then perform the reset operation.
The batteries that come with this unit discharge slightly during shipment and
storage. Because of this, they may require replacement sooner than the normal
expected battery life.

k Replacing Batteries
Precautions:
Incorrectly using batteries can cause them to burst or leak, possibly damaging the
interior of the unit. Note the following precautions:
• Be sure that the positive (+) and negative (–) poles of each battery are facing in
the proper directions.
• Never mix batteries of different types.
• Never mix old batteries and new ones.
• Never leave dead batteries in the battery
compartment.
• Remove the batteries if you do not plan to
use the unit for long periods.
• Never try to recharge the batteries sup-
plied with the unit.
• Do not expose batteries to direct heat, let
them become shorted, or try to take them
apart.


197
Appendix
(Should a battery leak, clean out the battery compartment of the unit immedi-
ately, taking care to avoid letting the battery fluid come into direct contact with
your skin.)
Keep batteries out of the reach of small children. If swallowed, consult with a
physician immediately.
u
u
u
u
uTo replace the main power supply batteries
* Never remove the main power supply and the memory back up batteries from
the unit at the same time.
* Be sure to switch the unit off before replacing batteries. Replacing batteries
with power on will cause data in memory to be deleted.
* Never replace the back cover or switch the calculator on while the main power
supply batteries are removed from the calculator or not loaded correctly. Doing
so can cause memory data to be deleted and malfunction of the calculator. If
mishandling of batteries causes such problems, correctly load batteries and
then perform the RESET operation to resume normal operation.
* Be sure to replace all two batteries with new ones.
1. Press !O to turn the calculator off.
2. Making sure that you do not accidently press the o key, attach the case to the
calculator and then turn the calculator over.
3. Remove the back cover from the unit by pull-
ing with your finger at the point marked ✩.
4. Remove the two old batteries.
5. Load a new set of two batteries, making sure
that their positive (+) and negative (–) ends
are facing in the proper directions.
6. Replace the back cover and press o to turn
power on. The memory back-up battery pro-
vides power to the memory while the main
batteries are removed, so memory data is not
lost.


198
Appendix
• Power will not switch on if you press o while the back cover is open.
• Do not leave the unit without main power supply batteries loaded for long periods.
Doing so can cause deletion of data stored in memory.
• If the figures on the display appear too light and hard to see after you turn on
power, adjust the contrast.
u
u
u
u
uTo replace the memory back up battery
* Before replacing the memory back up battery, switch on the unit and check to see
if the “Low battery!” message appears on the display. If it does, replace the main
power supply batteries before replacing the back up power supply battery.
* Never remove the main power supply and the memory back up batteries from the
unit at the same time.
* Be sure to switch the unit off before replacing battery. Replacing battery with
power on will cause data in memory to be deleted.
* Be sure to replace the back up power supply battery at least once 2 years, re-
gardless of how much you use the unit during that time. Failure to do so can
cause data in memory to be deleted.
1. Press !O to turn the calculator off
2.  Making sure that you do not accidently press the o key, attach the case to the
calculator and then turn the calculator over.
i
3. Remove the back cover from the unit by pull-
ing with your finger at the point marked ✩.
4. Remove screw i on the back of the calcula-
tor, and remove the back up battery holder.
5. Remove the old battery.

Appendix
6. Wipe off the surfaces of a new battery with a
soft, dry cloth. Load it into the calculator so
that its positive (+) side is facing up.
7. Pressing down on the battery with the battery
holder, replace the screw that secures the
holder in place.
8. Replace the back cover and press o to turn power on. The main batteries
provide power to the memory while the back-up battery is removed, so memory
data is not lost.

*For a single calculation, calculation error is ±1 at the 10th digit. (In the case of exponential display,
calculation error is ±1 at the last significant digit.) Errors are cumulative in the case of consecutive
calculations, which can also cause them to become large. (This is also true of internal consecutive
calculations that are performed in the case of ^(xy), x y, x!, 3   , nPr, nCr, etc.)
In the vicinity of a function’s singular point and point of inflection, errors are cumulative and may
become large.
