Safety Precautions
Lamp Precautions
GLamp removal
Never remove the lamp from the 
projector immediately after using 
it. The lamp becomes very hot 
during use, creating the risk of 
burn injury. Turn off the projector. 
After the POWER/STANDBY 
indicator changes to steady (not 
flashing) amber, unplug the 
projector from the power outlet. 
Next, wait for at least 60 minutes 
before removing the lamp.
GSpecified lamp type
Use only the lamp type that is 
specified for this projector. Use of 
any other type of lamp creates 
the risk of fire and breakdown.
GLamp replacement
Before replacing the lamp, be 
sure to turn off the projector and 
unplug it from the power outlet. 
Failure to do so creates the risk 
of electric shock.
•
Take care when replacing a 
broken lamp.
A broken lamp can cause 
glass fragments to be 
scattered inside the lamp 
housing. Glass inside of the 
lamp housing may also be 
discharged from the projector’s 
vent exhaust ports. Gas inside 
of the lamp includes mercury, 
so be sure to ventilate the 
area whenever the lamp 
breaks. Should you accidentally 
inhale gas fumes or should 
gas fumes get into your eyes, 
immediately contact a 
physician.
GBroken lamp
Never attempt to replace a 
broken lamp on your own. The 
projector uses a mercury lamp 
with high internal pressure as its 
light source. Should the lamp 
break, be sure to contact your 
original dealer or authorized 
CASIO service center to request 
replacement. Attempting to 
replace a broken lamp on your 
own creates the risk of personal 
injury due to broken glass or 
dispersed mercury.
Warning
Caution


Operating Precautions
10
Operating Precautions
G Never touch the glass of the lamp with your fingers. Doing so can damage the 
lamp and shorten its life.
G The light source lamp is a consumable item. The average life of a lamp is 
approximately 2000 hours. After 2000 hours, a message appears to alert you to 
the need of lamp replacement. However, note that the characteristics of a 
particular lamp or lamp operating conditions can cause the lamp to start to go 
dim or even fail before the message appears.
G Lamps are guaranteed for 90 days from the date of purchase or for 500 hours 
operation, whichever comes first.
G A mercury lamp with high internal pressure is used as the light source. A lamp 
that is weakened by impact, damage, or expiration of its lamp life may explode or 
fail to light if exposed to loud noise. Note that the performance of the lamp differs 
greatly from lamp to lamp, and due to conditions under which a lamp is used.
G The replacement message appears and the LAMP indicator flashes red after the 
lamp life is reached. When this happens, replace the lamp using the instructions 
provided in this User’s Guide.
G If the lamp continues to be used after its lamp life is reached, after 100 hours 
the projector will enter a cool down state and then go into standby. The 
projector will not turn on again until you replace the lamp.
G When the lamp life is reached, the message “It is time to replace the lamp. 
Use the procedure in the User’s Guide to replace the lamp as soon as 
possible.” appears on the display for about 10 seconds, and the LAMP indicator 
starts to flash red in one-second intervals. Replace the lamp as soon as 
possible after the message appears or the LAMP indicator flashes.
G Replace the lamp with a special YL-30 replacement lamp, which should be 
available from your original dealer.
G Turn off the projector. After the POWER/STANDBY indicator changes to steady 
(not flashing) amber, unplug the projector from the power outlet. Next, wait for 
at least 60 minutes before removing the lamp. Note that the lamp cartridge 
becomes very hot during normal use and during standby. Handling it when hot 
creates the risk of burn injury.
G The lamp contains mercury. Dispose of old lamps in accordance with the rules 
and regulations of your local jurisdiction.
G When replacing the lamp, use the special screwdriver that comes with the YL-30 
replacement lamp.
Lamp Handling Precautions
Caution!
Continued use of a lamp that has passed its lamp life increases the risk of 
the lamp rupturing. Replace the lamp with a new one as soon as possible 
after the replacement message appears.

Getting Ready
This section explains how to set up the projector to get it ready for use, and how to connect 
it to an input source (computer or video device).
It also includes information about how to turn on the projector, how to select the display 
language the first time you turn it on, and precautions you need to keep in mind concerning 
the power supply.
This projector is designed for tabletop use only. Place the projector onto a table, desk, or 
stand that is level and firm, making sure you allow enough room around it.
z
The following illustrations show how the projector should be oriented for optimum 
projection relative to the screen.
z You can place the projector on a surface that is angled up to 30 degrees up or down 
during use.Angling the projector more than 30 degrees up or down can cause rupture or 
premature aging of the projector's lamp,or malfunction of the projector.
z The above setup enables proper projection without any image correction. If the projector 
is at an angle to the screen, a phenomenon called “keystoning” will occur, which causes 
the sides, and/or the top and bottom of the image to be different lengths. The projector 
comes with a keystone correction feature that automatically corrects the image. See 
“Keystone Correction (KEYSTONE)” on page 50 for information about keystone correction.

source selection, power up, etc.) You can also execute an automatic adjustment operation by 
pressing the [AUTO] key. 
z You can turn off auto adjustment (page 90) when you want to disable auto adjustment 
and maintain manual settings.
z The projected image may become distorted while an auto adjustment operation is in 
progress.
z The [AUTO] key is disabled whenever S-VIDEO, VIDEO, or Component is selected as the 
input source.
z If an image is unclear following the auto adjustment operation, you can use the menu to 
adjust items manually. For details, see “Image Adjustment” on page 73.

Projection Operations
Full-screen Display of an RGB Image
The projector outputs images using XGA (1024 pixels × 768 pixels) video resolution. When 
the input signal from the computer connected to the projector is not an XGA signal, “Resize 
Image To Fit” automatically enlarges or reduces the image so it matches the projector’s video 
resolution and fills the entire screen. The following shows how different input signals from a 
computer are adjusted during projection.
z Resizing of an input image by “Resize Image To Fit” can call coarsening of the image or 
can cause part of the image to be cut off. If this happens, try turning off “Resize Image 
To Fit”. See “Screen Settings J Resize Image to Fit” on page 81 for more information.

When the projector is at an angle to the screen it is projecting on, the projected image may 
have different length left and right edges, or top and bottom edges. This phenomenon is 
called, “keystoning”. This projector comes with functions for automatic as well as manual 
keystone correction, which provides a regularly shaped projected image.
z Keystone correction (auto or manual) can cause dustortion of the projected image. If this 
happens try moving the screen and/or projector so they are oriented close to the 
configuration shown under “Setting Up the Projector” on page 28.
z Keystone correction can cause the corrected image to be smaller than the original 
(uncorrected) image.
Automatic Keystone Correction 
Automatic keystone correction correct the image to counteract the effects of vertical 
keystoning.
Performing auto keystone correction causes the message “Auto Keystone Corrected.” to appear 
in the center of the projected image.
Keystone Correction (KEYSTONE)


51
Projection Operations
z Note that auto keystone correction is possible within a range of about –30 degrees to 
+30 degrees.
z Auto keystone correction is performed by detecting the elevation angle of the projector. 
This means that the surface you are projecting onto needs to be standing straight up. If 
the surface you are projecting onto is not straight, use manual keystone correction to 
correct the image.
z You can turn auto keystone correction on or off as required. For details, see “Option 
Settings J Auto Keystone Correction” on page 89.
z Note that auto keystone correction is not performed for horizontal keystoning. Use manual 
correction for horizontal keystoning.
z Performing manual horizontal keystone correction and then automatic keystone correction 
can cause the manual horizontal keystone correction value to change, and can magnify 
horizontal keystoning. This occurs when vertical keystone correction narrows the allowable 
manual horizontal keystone correction range, causing the manually specified correction 
value to be outside the correction range. 
If this happens, rearrange the projector and screen so the lens is pointing straighter at 
the screen, and then perform manual keystone correction or auto keystone correction 
again.

Manual Keystone Correction
Manual keystone correction can be used to correct for both vertical and horizontal keystoning.
To use manual keystone correction
1. Press the [KEYSTONE] key.
z This causes the keystone correction screen to appear on the projected image.
2. Use the [S] and [T] keys to select either “Vertical Keystone Correction” 
or “Horizontal Keystone Correction”.
3. Use the [W] and [X] keys to correct for keystoning.
z Each press of [W] or [X] shifts the indicator on the currently selected bar left or right.
z Keystone correction is possible within the range that the indicator is able to move within 
the selected bar. Depending on conditions, the indicator may not move all the way to 
either end of the bar.
z Repeat steps 2 and 3 to perform keystone correction for the other direction, if you 
want. 
4. After the settings are the way you want, press the [ESC] key or the 
[KEYSTONE] key. 
z This causes the keystone correction screen to disappear.


53
Projection Operations
z The allowable ranges for manual keystone correction are –30 to +30 degrees vertically, 
and –8 to +8 degrees horizontally.
z Performing horizontal keystone correction and then vertical keystone correction can cause 
the horizontal keystone correction value to change. This occurs when vertical keystone 
correction narrows the allowable manual horizontal keystone correction range, causing the 
horizontal keystone correction value to be outside the correction range.
If this happens, rearrange the projector and screen so the lens is pointing straighter at 
the screen, and then perform manual keystone correction or auto keystone correction 
again.
You can use the remote controller keys to adjust the volume level of the audio that is output

Always remember that the settings you configure on the setup menu are applied for the input 
source (RGB, Component, S-VIDEO, VIDEO) that was selected when you displayed the setup 
menu. Note the following important points.
z
The items that appear on the setup menu depend on the currently selected input source 
and other factors.
Some items apply to a certain specific input source, while some apply to multiple input 
sources.
z
Even for menu items that are common to multiple input sources, the setting range or 
selectable options may differ according to the input source.
z
With certain exceptions, there are basically two types of settings that can be configured 
for multiple input sources. One type lets you configure different settings for each individual 
input source. The other type applies a single setting to all input sources. The volume 
level setting, for example, lets you configure a different setting for each input source, while 
the keystone correction setting lets you configure a single common setting for all input 
sources.
z For details about how settings are saved, and other details, see “Setup Menu Reference” 
on page 73.

IScreen Settings J Aspect Ratio
This sub-menu lets you select the aspect ratio (ratio between the vertical and horizontal 
dimensions) of the projected image.
Input Source Specific Menu Items 
Setting Explanations
4:3:
Sets the aspect ratio of the projected image to 4:3 (same as a standard TV 
screen). This setting is normally used when S-VIDEO or VIDEO is selected as 
the input source.
16:9: Sets the aspect ratio of the projected image to 16:9 (same as a movie screen 
or high-definition TV screen). Using this setting when the input source image is 
a 16:9 image that has been squeezed to a 4:3 image causes the image to be 
projected with its normal 16:9 aspect ratio. 
Setting Storage
A different setting is stored for each input source.
z When a component signal with an aspect ratio of 16:9 is sent from the input source, the 
aspect ratio of the projected image is automatically switched to 16:9. In this case, this 
setting cannot be changed.

IScreen Settings J Resize Image to Fit
When RGB is selected as the input source and the video resolution of the connected 
computer is anything other than XGA (1024 × 768 pixels), “Resize Image To Fit” automatically 
enlarges or reduces the input image so it matches the video resolution of the projector and 
fills the entire screen.
Input Source Specific Menu Items
Setting Explanations
On: When the input signal from the computer connected to the projector is not an 
XGA signal, the image is automatically enlarged or reduced so it matches the 
projector’s video resolution and fills the entire screen.
Off: Turns off resizing of the image input from the computer. If the image input from 
the computer is smaller than XGA, the size of the projected image will also be 
smaller. When the image input from the computer is larger than XGA, only the 
center part of the image that corresponds to XGA size is projected.
z Resizing of an input image by “Resize Image To Fit” can call coarsening of the image or 
can cause part of the image to be cut off. If this happens, try turning off “Resize Image 
To Fit”. Note, however, that turning off “Resize Image To Fit” can cause the projected 
image to become smaller, or it can cause only the center part of the image to be 
projected.

lens cover while it is at an angle less than 90 degrees as shown in the illustration on 
the right, the lens cover will not open and close correctly, and may become damaged.
z
The light source lamp is a consumable item. The average life of a lamp is approximately 
2000 hours. After 2000 hours, a message appears to alert you to the need of lamp 
replacement. However, note that the characteristics of a particular lamp or lamp operating 
conditions can cause the lamp to start to go dim or even fail before the message 
appears.
Replacing the Lamp
Caution!
Continued use of a lamp that has passed its lamp life increases the risk of 
the lamp rupturing. Replace the lamp with a new one as soon as possible 
after the replacement message appears.
Insert the right hinge 
while pressing here.

Replacing the Lamp
zDisposing of the Lamp (U.S.A. Only)
This product utilizes a lamp containing mercury. Disposal of the lamp 
may be regulated due to environmental considerations. For disposal or 
recycling information, please contact your local authorities or the 
Electronic Industries Alliance: http://www.eiae.org.
Caution
z
During normal use, the lamp and the area around it become 
extremely hot. Before replacing the lamp, turn off the projector 
and wait for the cool down operation (indicated when the 
POWER/STANDBY indicator is flashing amber) to finish. Next, 
disconnect the AC power cord from the projector, and wait for at 
least 60 minutes to allow it to cool down even further.
Touching the lamp or the area around it during operation or 
immediately after turning off the projector creates the risk of 
serious burn injury.
z
Replace the lamp using the YL-30 optional lamp cartridge only.
z
The projector uses a mercury lamp with high internal pressure 
as its light source. A lamp that is weakened by impact, damage, 
or expiration of its lamp life may explode or fail to light.
Note that the performance of the lamp differs greatly from lamp 
to lamp, and due to conditions under which a lamp is used.
z
Never touch the glass of the lamp with your fingers. Doing so 
can cause the lamp to rupture and shorten its life.
z
A broken lamp can cause glass fragments to be scattered inside 
the lamp housing. Gas inside of the lamp housing may also be 
discharged from the projector’s vent exhaust ports. Gas inside of 
the lamp includes mercury, so be sure to ventilate the area 
whenever the lamp breaks. Should you accidentally inhale gas 
fumes or should gas fumes get into your eyes, immediately 
contact a physician.
z
Should the lamp break, take care to avoid personal injury on the 
glass fragments. Never try to replace a broken lamp on your 
own. Be sure to contract your original dealer or authorized 
CASIO service center to request replacement.
z
The lamp contains mercury. Dispose of old lamps in accordance 
with the rules and regulations of your local jurisdiction.


105
User Maintenance
To replace the lamp
z When replacing the lamp, use the special screwdriver that comes with the YL-30

initialize the lamp time in this case, which will make it possible to turn on the projector.
1. Use the bundled AC power cord to plug the projector into a power 
outlet.
z Connecting to a power outlet causes the POWER/STANDBY and LAMP indicators on 
the top of the projector to light red, which indicates that the lamp has exceeded its 
service life.
2. While holding down the projector’s [W] key, hold down the [AUTO] key 
for about five seconds.
z This will reset the lamp time, cause the POWER/STANDBY indicator to change from red
