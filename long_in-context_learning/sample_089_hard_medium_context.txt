MAIN MENU 
Upon starting DCS, the Main Menu screen will be displayed after a brief program loading screen.   
The top panel contains buttons: 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
MODULE MANAGER. Use the Module Manager to see special offers, purchase new DCS 
modules, and view purchased ones. 
• 
OPTIONS. The Options screen consists of several tabs and allows you to customize your 
graphics, audio, input, and game play options. 
• 
OFFLINE-MODE. Use this mode if expecting to be unable to connect to the internet for 
an extended period of time. Activating this mode switches DCS to an offline-only mode 
only after successful authorization, i.e. the user MUST be online and logged-in to switch 
on this function. DCS may be kept in this mode indefinitely, but keep in mind that all 
network services (Module Manager, multiplayer, news) will be unavailable. 
 
The user may exit offline mode only from the same computer on which it was 
initially activated.* If this is not possible, contact technical support to clear 
the active game session. 
 
* BIOS and Windows version MUST BE IDENTICAL. For example, changing the 
BIOS while DCS is in offline mode will no longer allow the user to log in. 
• 
LOG OUT. Log in/ Log out/ Change account. The DCS application uses accounts 
registered at http://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com, which is also the same account 
used for technical support cases. A separate account is required for participation in the 
Eagle Dynamics forum at http://forums.eagle.ru/. 
From the Main Menu, you may select captions in the right main menu. Each of these captions 
directs you to a different aspect of the game or exits the game back to desktop.  To make a 
selection, place your mouse over the caption and the caption will be illuminated.  By then left 
mouse clicking, you will be directed to the selected area of the program.

MAIN MENU | Eagle Dynamics 
 
 
At the left side there is a retractable News Panel that shows the latest news about ED games 
and events. News can be thumbing by the two "<>" arrows in the upper-right panel corner. 
Main Menu buttons include: 
• 
INSTANT ACTION. Allows you to quickly fly a pre-built mission that bypasses the 
briefing screen.  When you click on this button, a pop-up screen will be displayed that 
allows you to select an aircraft and mission scenario to fly.  To exit this screen without 
selecting a mission, click on the yellow X in the top right corner.  
• 
CREATE FAST MISSION. Using the built-in mission generator, you can quickly create 
missions according to your specified parameters.  Missions can be created in either 
simple or advanced modes (increased number of mission options). 
• 
MISSION. Open a single mission. Using the built-in Mission Editor, you can build your 
own missions or download them from the Internet.  You can access such missions from 
this screen. 
• 
CAMPAIGN. To select a campaign to fly or continue an existing one, select this option.  
Unlike Missions, Campaigns are a series of missions linked together in a logical way 
resulting from your mission outcomes. 
• 
MULTIPLAYER. Open the multiplayer interface to host or join an online game. 
• 
LOGBOOK. From this screen you may create a pilot persona(s) and track their 
accomplishments and statistics. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  13 
 
• 
ENCYCLOPEDIA.  The Encyclopedia is a resource that provides data and images of all 
the air, land, and sea units in the game. 
• 
TRAINING. An extensive set of training missions are provided to teach you to fly and 
operate the aircraft. 
• 
REPLAY. After each mission you fly, you have the option to save the mission as a replay 
file (Track file). You can access these replay files from this screen. 
• 
MISSION EDITOR.  The Mission Editor allows you to create missions big and small.  
These missions can then be used as single player missions, multiplayer missions, training 
missions, or to populate a campaign.  This is a powerful tool and is the same one used to 
create the missions and campaigns included with the game. 
• 
CAMPAIGN BUILDER. Using missions created in the Editor, you may use the 
Campaign Builder to create your own campaigns that you can play yourself or share with 
friends. 
• 
EXIT. To exit the game and return to desktop, press the red Exit button. 
Along the bottom edge of the screen are the game icons. These icons represent available and 
installed DCS modules. You can read information on each module and select a background 
theme by clicking an icon.

Graphics Settings 
Several graphics settings are available along the left side of the screen.  Selection of a graphics 
option is done by using the drop-down list for each item and selecting the desired setting.  
Textures 
Sets the object texture resolution. Options are Low, Medium, and High. Higher texture 
resolutions appear crisper but use more VRAM. 
• 
Low – Low resolution textures for terrain, objects, and cockpit. 
• 
Medium – Medium resolution textures for terrain, objects, and cockpit. 
• 
High – High resolution textures for terrain, objects, and cockpit. 
Terrain Textures 
The option affects the level of detail for terrain and building textures. If this option is changed 
after DCS has already loaded in the terrain (loaded into a mission or the mission editor) a restart 
is required for the changes take effect. If a player entered the options menu immediately after 
loading the game interface, a restart is not required. 
• 
Low – Terrain surface textures for the chosen map will be loaded in a low resolution. 
• 
High – Terrain surface textures for the chosen map will be loaded in a high resolution. 
Civ. Traffic 
• 
Off – No road and rail traffic. 
• 
Low, Medium, High – The density of road and rail traffic. 
Water 
Sets the level of detail for water effects. 
• 
Low – Water has no 3D surface effects. 
• 
Medium – Water has 3D surface effects, including waves and wakes. 
• 
High – Water has 3D surface, shelf and full reflections.

Eagle Dynamics  23 
 
Example of water detail set to Low (left) and High (right). In High, the water surface has a 3D 
undulation effect in high winds, and ships generate wakes and churn. 
Visib Range 
Sets the distance at which objects are rendered. Options are Low, Medium, High, and Extreme. 
Actual distances depend on object type (e.g., buildings are rendered at further distances than 
trees). 
• 
Low – Objects are rendered out to approximately 7 km. 
• 
Medium – Objects are rendered out to approximately 12 km. 
• 
High – Objects are rendered out to approximately 17 km. 
• 
Ultra – Objects are rendered out to approximately 24 km. 
• 
Extreme – Objects are rendered at their maximum distance. 
Heat Blur 
Sets the amount of visible atmospheric refraction caused by hot exhaust air. 
• 
Off – Heat blur is not present. 
• 
Low – Heat blur partially displayed behind the aircraft engine nozzles. 
• 
High – Heat blur fully displayed behind the aircraft engine nozzles. 
Shadows 
Sets the level of detail for object shadows. Shadows can be planar (appearing as flat translucent 
planes) or soft (a more realistic appearance). Shadows can be cast by the subject (the object 
that is the focus of the current view) or by other objects in the scene. Self-casting shadows are 
shadows that one part of an object casts upon itself. 
• 
Off – No shadows will be rendered. 
• 
Flat Only – The view subject will cast planar shadows. 
• 
Low – All objects in the view will cast planar shadows. 
• 
Medium – The view subject will have self-casting shadows, and all other objects will 
cast planar shadows. 
• 
High – The view subject will cast soft shadows as well as self-casting shadows, and all 
other objects will cast planar shadows. 
Resolution 
Sets the size and resolution of the rendered image. In windowed mode, this sets the size of the 
game window. In full-screen mode, this sets the display resolution. For multi-monitor setups, 
the total resolution can be entered manually. 
Aspect Ratio 


ED [DCS USER MANUAL] 
 
24 
OPTIONS | Eagle Dynamics 
 
The aspect ratio is the ratio of display width to height. It’s normally set automatically when a 
new resolution is chosen, but can also be set manually. 
Monitors 
For multi-monitor setups, this option configures what is rendered on each monitor:  
• 
1 Screen – Pilot view will be displayed on a single monitor (default). 
• 
3 Screen – Pilot view will be split equally across three monitors (triple-head setup). 
• 
Camera + LMFCD (on right side) – Video will be split between 2 monitors - one for 
the main camera and one on the right side for the left MFCD.  
• 
Camera + LMFCD – Video will be split between 2 monitors - one for the main camera 
and one for the left MFCD. 
• 
Camera + LMFCD (automatic placement) – Video will be split between 2 monitors 
with non-fixed position. Positioning on the real position of monitors in the cabin of the 
aircraft. 
• 
Camera + RMFCD (on left side) – Video will be split between 2 monitors - one for 
the main camera and one on the left side for the right MFCD. 
• 
Camera + RMFCD – Video will be split between 2 monitors - one for the main camera 
and one for the right MFCD. 
• 
Camera + RMFCD (automatic placement) – Video will be split between 2 monitors 
with non-fixed position. Positioning on the real position of monitors in the cabin of the 
aircraft. 
• 
LMFCD + Camera + RMFCD – The center monitor will display the pilot view, and the 
left and right monitors will display the left and right MFCDs. 
• 
Stereo – Pilot video will be split into a stereoscopic pair and output separately. This 
should only be used by players with stereoscopic display setups. 
Note: To customize these configurations or create your own new configurations, navigate to \Saved 
Games\DCS\Config\MonitorSetup\. Each configuration is defined by a separate lua file. 
Res. of Cockpit Displays 
Set the resolution of cockpit displays such as mirrors, multifunction displays, moving maps, etc.  
Note that higher resolution settings can negatively impact the smoothness of game play. 
• 
256 – Low quality. The picture is rendered into a texture of 256x256 pixels. It is 
updated through the frame. 
• 
512 – Standard quality. The image is rendered into a texture of 512x512 pixels. It is 
updated through the frame. 
• 
512 Every Frame – Standard quality. The image is rendered into a texture of 512x512 
pixels. Each frame is updated, but it reduces the overall performance of the game in 
comparison with the choice of the preset updated through the frame. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  25 
 
• 
1024 – High quality. The image is rendered into a texture of 1024x1024 pixels. It is 
updated through the frame. 
• 
1024 Every Frame – High quality. The image is rendered into a texture of 1024x1024 
pixels. Each frame is updated, but it reduces the overall performance of the game in 
comparison with the choice of the preset updated through the frame. 
MSAA 
MSAA (MultiSample Anti-Aliasing) – Is an improved version of SSAA super-sampling that 
consumes less resources. Smoothing takes place only along the edges of objects, not the entire 
scene as in SSAA. When the resolution in the game increases, it requires more video memory on 
the graphics card.  
• 
Off – Turns off MSAA anti-aliasing. 
• 
2x – Two-pass MSAA. 
• 
4x – Four-pass MSAA. This improves anti-aliasing quality at the expense of FPS. 
Depth of Field 
Depth of field is the distance between the nearest and the furthest objects that are in 
acceptably sharp focus in an image. 
• 
Off – Depth of field effects are disabled. 
• 
Bokeh – Enables a very shallow depth of field, blurring parts of the scene closer to or 
further from the view subject. The blurred objects take on a "bokeh" effect simulating 
lens distortion. Severely reduces performance and is mainly used to create video/screen 
shots only. 
• 
Simple – Enables a very shallow depth of field, blurring parts of the scene closer to or 
further from the view subject. 
Lens Effects 
Enables camera effects caused by dirt or lens flares. 
• 
None – Lens effects are disabled. 
• 
Dirt – Simulates occasional specks of dust on the camera lens in exterior views. 
• 
Flare – Simulates lens distortion caused by direct sunlight. 
• 
Dirt+Flare – Enabled both the Dirt and Flare effects, but can make it difficult to detect 
contacts. 
Motion Blur 
The effect of blurring the image when the camera moves quickly. Can be successfully applied 
when the scene needs to be given more dynamics and speed. Proper use of Motion Blur can add 
cinematography to what is happening on the screen. It can also help you veil low frame rates 
and add smoothness to your gaming experience as needed. 


ED [DCS USER MANUAL] 
 
26 
OPTIONS | Eagle Dynamics 
 
• 
Off – Turns off motion blur. 
• 
On – Includes the Motion Blur effect, which makes the entire image blurred and 
unfocused at speed, without highlighting any area. 
Clouds 
Sets the level of quality for clouds and weather effects. Options are Low, Standard, High and 
Ultra. 
Higher values render the clouds better and have a grater influence on the performance. The 
Standard option is the best choice to start with. 
 
 
Example of Clouds detail set to Low (left) and Ultra (right). In Ultra, cloud shapes are higher resolution. 
SSAA 
SSAA (SuperSample Anti-Aliasing) – The heaviest, but also the most qualitative and eerily 
loading a video card. Smoothes the whole scene. It works by rendering the image at a larger 
size and downsampling it to the display size. For powerful top-of-the-range graphics cards. 
• 
Off – SSAA is disabled. 
• 
x1.5 – The image is rendered at ×1.5 and downsampled to smooth edges. 
• 
x2 – The image is rendered at ×2 size and downsampled to smooth edges.  
SSAA is limited to 4k, so if resulting required buffer size is over 4k – this option will not be 
available. 
Simultaneously, multi-sampling (MSAA) and super-sampling (SSAA) should not be enabled to 
avoid conflict and performance degradation (either MSAA – or SSAA). 
 
SSLR 
SSLR (Screen Space Local Reflections) – Enables a reflection effect caused by ambient lighting. 
It is best seen on smooth and chromed surfaces. 
• 
Off – Turns off reflections on smooth surfaces. 
• 
On – Turns on reflections on smooth surfaces. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  27 
 
 
SSAO 
The SSAO (Screen Space Ambient Occlusion) – Enables a shading effect caused by ambient 
lighting. It is an approximation of the global illumination technology with reduced GPU load. 
Improves realism of the picture. 
• 
Off – Turns SSAO off. 
• 
On – Enables SSAO. 
 
 
Example of SSLR and SSAO disabled (left) and enabled (right). When enabled, the cockpit shading is 
more affected by ambient lighting conditions. 
 
Note: If you wish to increase frame rates, the most import graphics settings to adjust lower are Terrain Textures, 
Water, Visib Range, Shadows and MSAA. 
 
The right side of the page contains auxiliary graphics settings. 
 
Auxiliary Settings 
Clutter/Grass 
Adjusts the distance that ground clutter such as grass, bushes, rocks, etc. are rendered. 
Forest Visibility 
Adjusts the distance that 3D trees are rendered. As the value increases, the trees are drawn in 
forests, fields, along rivers, roads and cities. If the value decreases, the trees are only in the 
forest belts in a smaller number. Beyond this distance, forests are rendered as flat ground 
textures. 
Forest Details Factor 


ED [DCS USER MANUAL] 
 
28 
OPTIONS | Eagle Dynamics 
 
The slider adjusts the GPU load by the number of tree triangles rendered. Minimum value is 0.1 
and possible maximum is 1.0. 
Scenery Details Factor 
The slider adjusts the GPU load by the number of overall scene triangles rendered (map objects 
such as buildings, constructions, etc.). Minimum value is 0.1 and possible maximum is 1.0. 
Preload Radius 
Sets the radius (in meters from user position) that terrain is preloaded. A larger setting reduces 
slowdowns due to hard disk swapping, but requires more RAM. 
Chimney Smoke Density 
Sets the density of smoke coming from building chimneys. 
Gamma 
Changes the overall luminosity of the rendered image. Lower values produce darker scenes. 
Anisotropic Filtering 
Sets the level of anisotropic filtering. Lower values will increase FPS but cause textures to 
appear blurry when viewed from shallow angles. Examples include runway and taxiway textures 
when viewed from the ground, or tanker director lights when viewed from the contact position. 
• 
Off – Turns off anisotropic filtering. 
• 
2x, 4x, 8x, 16x – Includes an anisotropic filtering with the selected filtering factor. 
Improves the display of deleted objects and textures on surfaces at a certain angle. 
Terrain Object Shadows 
Sets the type of shadows rendered on the terrain from scenery objects. 
• 
Default – Shadows follow terrain contours. This option has the highest FPS impact. 
• 
Flat – Shadows are planar. 
• 
Off – Shadows are not rendered. 
Cockpit Global Illumination 
A lighting method that takes into account not only direct light from light sources, but also 
reflexes (reflections and refractions of light inside the cockpit, dancing shadows), resulting in a 
much more realistic image. 
• 
Off – Direct lighting only.  
• 
On – Enables the global lighting algorithms used for more realistic simulation of light. 
Requires more PC resources and may have a considerable impact on frame rates.

Modifiers.  Pressing the MODIFIERS button will display the MODIFIERS PANEL window and 
allow you to set control modifiers and control switches to allow additional control assignments. 
 
 
 
The Modifiers panel consists of two parts, the Modifiers at the left and the Switches at the right.   
Modifiers usually use a key or button combination with [SHIFT], [CTRL] or [ALT] (by default) or 
any custom keys assigned to act as a modifier. For example, you can assign any joystick button 
as a modifier and use it to expand the available joystick’s commands that can be assigned to 
your input device. 
By default, several Modifiers are included in the Modifiers window: LALT, LCTRL, LSHIFT, RALT, 
RCTRL, RSHIFT and RWIN.  However, by pressing the ADD button below the Modifiers list 
window, you can also create your own. The window for adding a modifier will appear.

To remove a modifier, select it from the window and then press the REMOVE button. 
With at least one modifier in the list, you can now assign a modifier to any Action from the Add 
Assignment Panel. 
 
 
Switches  
The switches window in the right part of the Modifiers Panel works as a toggle as opposed to 
the modifiers. With modifiers you must press the modifier and key simultaneously, for example 
Ctrl and T.  With a switch you can first activate the switch, then press any needed keys and 
then turn off the switch.  You can think of it as setting a key to a mode.  For example, you could 
assign the “E” button on the throttle as a switch and the Hat on the stick to control the trim. In 
flight, you could then press “E” one time and use the hat to trim the aircraft instead of its 
default function of view panning.

Deadzone. Allows you to create a “dead zone” in the center of the curve. Depending on the 
accuracy of your joystick, you may wish to setup a deadzone value of 5-10. This will help avoid 
problems when trimming the aircraft due to calibration problems. Move the slider to the right to 
increase the deadzone and move to the left to decrease it.  The actual numeric value is 
displayed to the right of the slider. 
Saturation.  These sliders for both X and Y allow you to adjust the total axis travel in X and Y 
and will be converted to control input.  For example, if you want the entire axis throw of a 
joystick to be used as input, you would set the X and Y limits to the corners of the window 
(saturation levels of 100).  If, however you wanted to reduce the possible input throw of a 
joystick by 50%, you would set the X and Y saturation levels to 50.  
Curvature. Moving this slider to the right and left increases and decreases the non-linearity of 
the axis curve.  You can use this curve to adjust how sensitive (or insensitive) the axis is.  It is 
common to have a shallow curve near the deadzone to increase the accuracy of fine control 
input.  The actual numeric value is displayed to the right of the slider. 
Slider.  Allows you to set the axis in regards to a slider and not a default curve that will return 
to center when there is no input being generated from the device. For example, you may wish 
to use the Slider function for the throttle axis but the standard curve axis for a control stick. 
Invert. The Invert radio button will swap the axis of the device. 
User Curve. Rather than use the Curvature slider, you may select the User Curve radio button 
and display 11 vertical scales that allow you to adjust input device responses.  These range for 
0% input on the left side of the scale to 100% input on the right side of the scale.

more authentic, but can be a challenge to first-time-fliers.  The Game Flight Mode however 
makes flying the aircraft much easier and care-free. 
Game Avionics Mode.  Game Avionics Mode helps with flight orientation by displaying 3D 
markers in space. 
Radio Assists.  When enabled, you will get audio alerts informing you of incoming missiles, 
when you are within valid weapon use parameters, and information on the location of enemy 
units.

Note that all missions have a track file recorded.  When you re-fly the same mission, the track 
file is overwritten unless you save it under a new name.  The SAVE TRACK button allows you to 
do this. The game tracks have the extension "*.trk" and are stored in C:\Users\<User 
Name>\Saved Games\DCS\Tracks\ by default. 
SAVE DEBRIEFING. When you press the SAVE DEBRIFING button, the Save Debriefing File 
window is displayed, where you need to select the saving path and enter the file name. Game 
debriefing files have the extension "*.log" and are saved to the C:\Users\<User Name>\Saved 
Games\DCS\Logs by default. 
FLY AGAIN. Press this button to re-fly the mission. Note, unless you save the current track and 
debriefing, they will be lost once you hit FLY AGAIN or exit the briefing.

REPLAY 
Every time you play a mission, a replay file of the mission is automatically recorded as a .TRK 
(track) file.  When viewing your mission debriefing, you can choose to save the Replay under a 
different name than the default.  However, if you do not and play the same mission again, the 
original Replay will be overwritten.   
To select a Replay file, select Replay from the Main Menu page.  Note that you cannot view 
Replays from the Open mission page or the Mission Editor. 
 
 
Upon opening the Replay page, you are presented with a page that is very similar to the Open 
mission page.  This page allows you to browse your local disk(s) and select and load saved 
Replay files (the track file has an extension *.trk). 
To do this, select the required drive letter in the upper drop-down list, then go to the folder with 
tracks. Folders are opened by double-clicking on them, and you can go up to the level by 
double-clicking on the top line "...". By default, the C:\Users\<User Name>\Saved

The Mission Editor Map and Navigation 
The ME is divided into four primary areas: 
• 
World Map.  This area of the screen forms the majority of the screen and displays the 
topographic map, units, routes, and other mission elements. 
• 
Mission and Map Bar. Along the bottom of the screen is the Mission and Map Bar and 
this provides you information on cursor location on the World Map as well as mission 
name and current time. 
• 
System Bar. Along the top of the screen is the System Bar, and from here you control 
file management, access the campaign editor, the encyclopedia, credits, enable track 
recording, and duplicate several functions from the Tool Bar. 
•

The World Map 
The World Map consists of the Black Sea region with detailed terrain along the eastern edge.  
While other areas of the map are represented, they are not as fully detailed as the eastern 
areas.  Using the Options menu (described later), you may filter the data that is displayed on 
the map such as urban areas, rivers, roads, etc.  
Navigating the Map 
A right mouse button hold while moving the mouse will pan the view and rotating the mouse 
wheel controls the zoom level.  Selecting an object or unit is done by clicking with the left 
mouse button.  To zoom in on a specific location on the map, place the cursor over the desired 
location and rotate the mouse wheel forward. 
The Mission and Map Bar 
Located along the bottom of the screen is the Mission and Map Bar. This is an informative bar 
that tells you the name of the loaded mission, cursor position and altitude within the World Map, 
map mode, and the current time according to your Windows settings (not mission time). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note that the coordinates and altitude are controlled according to the position of your mouse on 
the World Map.  These numbers will change dynamically as your move your mouse and 
correspond to the real-life coordinates and altitude of the topography.  This can be a useful tool 
when trying to determine the coordinates of an objective for a mission briefing.  Cursor 
displayed altitude may be set to either feet or meters, depending on your 
Options/Gameplay/Units setting. The coordinate display can be toggled between Lat/Long, 
Lat/Long Decimal and MGRS, depending on your Options/Misc/Coordinate Display setting. 
 
Note that “New Mission” will appear in the Mission Name field until you save a newly created 
mission.

The System Bar 
Located along the top of the screen is the System Bar.  The System Bar consists of several pull 
down menus.  These are: FILE, EDIT, FLIGHT, CAMPAIGN, CUSTOMIZE, MISSION GENERATOR 
and MISC.  To select one of these pull down menus, place your mouse over the text and left 
mouse click. 
The System Bar pull down menus provide the following functions: 
FILE 
The File functions provide you basic file management of missions.  These include: 
1. NEW. 
Selecting New will allow you to exit the current mission loaded and start a new one from 
scratch.  Before proceeding though, a consent message box is provided to you so that 
you do not accidentally lose a mission you are working on.  After creating a new mission, 
you will be displayed the THEATER OF WAR and COALITIONS window. 
 
This window allows you to define a map and what countries (factions) will be assigned to 
one of the two sides.  Unassigned countries will not take part in the mission. In the left 
side window all unassigned factions are listed; in the top right window the RED side 
factions are listed; and in the lower right window all BLUE side factions are listed.  To 
move a faction, left click on the desired faction and then press either the left or right 


ED [DCS USER MANUAL]

MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
arrow button to move it between the unassigned window and a side window or press the 
up and down arrows to move the faction to the other side directly. 
At the bottom of the window are three buttons.  The CLEAN COALITIONS button allows 
you to reset the current faction distribution to the default list. The SAVE button allows 
you to save the current faction distribution and will be set as the default.  The OK button 
will use the current distribution for the mission but will not save it as the default. 
In the COALITION PRESETS field, you can select presets that can be changed at will: 
• 
Custom – add countries by coalitions manually. 
• 
Modern – based on modern realities. 
• 
WWII – based on the layout of forces for the period of WWII. 
 
Note: When creating missions, it is up to you to decide who will be allied with whom.  You are 
free to create realistic alliances or make very fanciful ones.  We leave it to you to decide.  
2. OPEN. 
Selecting Open will display the Open Mission window.  This window allows you to browse 
your dedicated mod folders or local disk(s) and select and load saved missions. 
 
 
Using standard Windows file browser functionality, you may select the DRIVE you wish to search 
using the DRIVE field in the top right of the window and then select the desired mission from 
the folder/file listing. Once you select a mission file, the path to that file is displayed in the PATH 
field and the name of the mission file is displayed in the FILE field.  Note that mission files are 
assigned a *.miz extension. 
Once you have selected the desired mission file, press the OK button at the bottom of the 
window to load it.  You may also exit the window without loading a mission or track file by 
pressing the CANCEL button at the bottom of the window or the X button in the top right corner.

3. SAVE. 
The SAVE button saves the mission file in the current directory while keeping the current 
filename. This will not allow you to change the filename or its directory. 
4. SAVE AS. 
The Save As function operates much like the Open Mission window but it allows you save 
a mission file (*.miz or *.trk) and give it a unique name.  The primary difference is that 
you may overwrite the name in the FILE NAME field as you wish and save the file under 
that name.  To do so, erase the current name and type in the name you wish. You may 
then use the browser functions to determine where you wish to save the file.  Once 
complete, you must press the OK button to complete the save. 
 
 
5. EXIT. Pressing Exit will close the ME and return you to the Main Menu. 
EDIT 
The EDIT pull down provides you a second means of accessing the most important mission 
construction tools: ADD AIRPLANE, ADD HELICOPTER, ADD SHIP, ADD VEHICLE, ADD STATIC, 
ADD TEMPLATE, REMOVE, LOAD STATIC TEMPLATE and SAVE STATIC TEMPLATE.  These tools 
are duplicated on the Tool Bar and we will discuss them there in detail. 
FLIGHT 
The Flight menu allows you start a loaded mission to play or start the mission to setup the 
player's aircraft avionics in PREPARE MISSION mode. This menu also allows you to convert a 
recorded (track) mission into an AVI video file and access the REPLAY menu for track playback.  
1. FLY MISSION. Selecting this option will close the ME, load the mission into the 
simulation, and then start the simulation.  The loading time of a mission will vary 
according to the number of units in the mission, the amount of scripting, and how much 
RAM your computer has. 


ED [DCS USER MANUAL]

MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
2. PREPARE MISSION. The PREPARE MISSION mode is used for integrating navigation 
and environment data into the saved mission file.  When near the end of creating a 
mission, you can start the mission in the PREPARE MISSION mode (it will look much like 
usual FLY MISSION start) and configure various avionics in the cockpit.  Your avionics 
settings can then be saved and will start in the saved states whenever other players 
open the mission.  
The following avionics settings can be saved using the PREPARE MISSION function: 
Ка-50 
• 
Satellites – Mission name\Scripts\World\GPS_GNSS.lua, 
• 
Additional ABRIS data – Mission name\ABRIS\Database\ ADDITIONAL.lua, 
• 
Navigation database – Mission name\ABRIS\Database\NAVIGATION.lua, 
• 
ABRIS routes – Mission name\ABRIS\Database\ROUTES.lua. 
To save custom settings for the Satellites, edit the GPS_GNSS.lua file prior to running the 
Mission Prepare function. The GPS_GNSS.lua file can be found in 
\Scripts\World\GPS_GNSS.lua. 
A-10C 
• 
CDU. All setting except a mission editor flight plan that can't be changed. 
• 
IFFCC. The block of test menu. 
• 
MFCD. Lower OSB buttons functionality. 
• 
SADL. Network user ID, callname etc. (NET page) 
• 
TAD. Profiles. 
• 
TGP. Laser codes, integration, calibration method, gain settings, TAAF altitude. 
• 
DSMS. Mission Control Page settings. Weapon profiles. 
Once your avionics are setup as desired for the mission, exit the mission and press the 
SAVE button in the ME once again to save all of the prepared data in the mission file.  
NOTE for mission makers: 
If you use prepare mission mode, please indicate in the briefing that the player should not use 
the mission planner. If he'll change the route or weapons for the mission, the avionics scripts 
saved in the mission file using prepare mission will conflict with the new settings. 
 
If you want to give the player the freedom of action to the use the mission planner, do not use 
mission prepare mode. 
3. RECORD AVI. 
This option allows you to convert a Track file (which can only be viewed in the game) to 
an AVI video file that can be viewed by anyone using video playback software. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  91 
 
Once a Track file has been created, you may load the file into this tool and then set the 
video quality of the AVI video output.  A few notes: 
• 
Because the AVI tools render the Track file frame by frame and NOT in real-time, you 
can create an AVI with higher or lower frame rates than when the track was 
originally recorded. 
• 
The higher the video quality and longer the recording, the longer it will take to 
render the AVI. Setting the FPS slider too high will also lengthen the time it takes.  
Please note that rendering long, high-quality AVIs can be a very time consuming 
process. 
• 
Once the AVI is created, you may then play it back outside of the game or convert 
and compress it with other codecs. 
• 
Track selection. Pressing the button labelled "…" brings up the track selection panel. 
Select the desired track and click OK. 
• 
Using the START and FINISH fields, you can create an AVI out of just one part of a 
larger Track file. 
 
 
 
• 
Video and Audio Codecs to Use. From the dropdown menu that appears, select a 
preset for the video and audio codecs to be used in rendering, as well as the quality

4. REPLAY. This command brings up the window of viewing previously recorded tracks. 
CAMPAIGN BUILDER 
The Campaign Builder is what we term a Staged Campaign System (SCS).  We will describe the 
functionality of the Campaign Builder in detail in the Campaign Builder chapter.  
CUSTOMIZE 
The Customize menu allows you to configure a number of map display options and set 
gameplay options for the mission. 
1. MISSION OPTIONS. 
The Mission Options menu can be used to lock certain gameplay options for the 
particular mission loaded. When the "USE THESE OPTIONS FOR ALL MISSIONS" check-
box is unchecked in the Options\Gameplay menu, the locked mission options will 
override the settings in the main Options. However, when the "USE THESE OPTIONS 
FOR ALL MISSIONS" check-box is checked, the settings in the main Options screen will 
take priority. 
Along the left side of the window are the ENFORCE buttons. Checking an ENFORCE 
button will force the settings of this option on the player of the mission. 
Along the right side of the window are the VALUE buttons.  VALUE buttons operate as 
on/off variables. When checked, the options will be forced ON. When unchecked, the 
option will be forced OFF. 
From the left side of the Mission Options window, you may select the following mission 
options to enforce:

Resource Manager 
The Resource Manager (RM) is Mission Editor a system that allows you to set a determined 
quantity of aircraft, fuel and equipment at each airbase warehouse and independent warehouse. 
Each warehouse (airbase or independent) can resupply other warehouses with defined speed, 
periodicity and size. 
The RM is a very useful tool for single player and multiplayer missions in which the mission 
designer can limit the available aircraft, fuel and weapons to the player(s). Thereby adding a 
level of strategic thinking of how to best use limited resources. 
Warehouse in Airport 
Each airbase consumes resources from its own unique resource stockpile called a warehouse; 
these resources can be replenished from other airbases and warehouses.  
By default, airbases are neutral and have infinite resources, meaning that each airbase can 
produce an infinite number of all types of aircraft, fuel and weapons. 
The airbase settings panel can be opened in the mission editor by left-clicking on the zone of 
the airbase indicated by a circle.

Resource Manager, Full Info 
After clicking the Full Info button, the full display window for managing resources from the 
selected warehouse is displayed. Let's take a look at some of the options: 
 
 
Supply Rates 
In the top left of the window are three items that allow you to set how fast the warehouse can 
supply other linked warehouses. These include: 
• 
Speed – This value determines the road speed by which virtual supply convoys travel 
from the selected airbase / warehouse to the warehouse being supplied. 
• 
Periodicity – This value, in minutes, determines how often a supply convoy will be sent 
to the selected airbase / warehouse. This happens only after a supply request has been 
made. If the linked warehouse is the requester, that warehouse will be supplying with 
the set periodicity. If linked warehouse is not the requester, it does not supply. 
• 
Size – This value, in tons, determines the amount of supplies that will be delivered from 
the supplier warehouses with each delivery. 
• 
Copy to – copies the selected resource manager configuration for the categories marked 
by checkboxes (AIRCRAFT, FUEL, EQUIPMENT.) to another air base selected from the 
drop-down list.

• 
Operating level, % – When the resource is reduced to the set level, the nearest 
supplier will initiate a supply delivery. When the resource is reduced to the set level, the 
warehouse will send the request to upper-linked warehouse. 
Warehouse Inventory 
In the center of the display is a large, vertical column that displays the inventory of the selected 
warehouse. On the left side of the column is the type of inventory and to the right of each item 
is the number remaining. Above the column are three tabs: A/C, LIQUIDS and EQP. 
To set all values to zero for a category, you can press the Clear Col button at the bottom of the 
column. 
A/C Tab 
The A/C tab lists the type and initial number of aircraft assigned to the warehouse. By left 
mouse clicking on an initial number, you can alter the value. If you wish to always have the 
airbase at maximum strength (100), check the Unlimited Aircraft check box to the left of the 
column. If you wish to only list aircraft that are player-flyable, check the Hide Not Flyable 
check box. 
 
 
 
 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  103 
 
LIQUIDS Tab 
This tab allows you to set the initial amount of fuel assigned to the warehouse. From the Initial 
Fuel Amount, tons box, you can increase or decrease the amount of fuel. If you wish for the fuel 
level to always be at 100 tons, check the Unlimited Fuel check box. 
 
 
 
EQP (Equipment) Tab 
The equipment tab lists all possible stores that can be loaded on aircraft. This includes weapons, 
pods, and fuel tanks. Like the aircraft selection, the name of the store is listed on the left side of 
the column and the initial number of the store is listed to the right. You can click on the initial 
number to adjust it, if the Unlimited Munitions check box is not checked. 
Due to the wide variety and number of stores, seven store category buttons are listed to the left 
of the column. Use these filter buttons to display the type of store you wish to view / adjust. 
1. AA missiles. Air-to-Air missiles 
2. AG missiles. Air-to-Ground missiles 
3. AG Rockets. Unguided Air-to-Ground rockets 
4. AG Bombs. Unguided bombs 
5. AG Guided Bombs. Guided bombs (such as laser and GPS)

6. Fuel tanks. External fuel tanks 
7. Misc. Other stores such as ECM pods, smoke pods, gun pods, targeting pods, etc. 
 
 
 
Copy to Other Warehouses 
In the top center of the page is the Copy to option that allows you to copy the settings of the 
warehouse you are editing to another airbase warehouse. This is done by first selecting what 
resources you wish to copy (A/C, Fuel and Eqp) by selecting the check boxes and then selecting 
the airbase you wish to copy the settings to by using the drop-down airbase list. 
Adding a Warehouse 
In addition to the warehouse that is co-located with each airbase, you can also place 
independent warehouses. To do so, select warehouse from the Add or Modify Static Object 
menu. Once you place it, you can set its inventory values as you would an airbase warehouse. 
Note: When connecting warehouses, they must be assigned to the same side. 
 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  105 
 
 
 
You can consecutive link many warehouses on one chain. Also, multiple suppliers and multiple 
consumers can be connected to a single warehouse. 
If a current warehouse has a multiple suppliers, it is sending the request to the closest supplier 
at first. If the closest supplier can’t provide the full request list, then the current warehouse will 
send the request to a more distant one, etc.

In addition to the standard airfield layouts, you can put graphic files with mission-relevant 
content, such as briefings, start / stop procedures, take-off / landing, etc., on the [RShift + K] 
kneeboard. Custom cards will be displayed at the end of the standard list. To access them 
immediately, cycle backwards through kneeboard cards. To add custom cards to the kneeboard, 
the mission creator must first create a folder named “Kneeboard” in the directory 
C:\Users\<User Name>\Saved Games\DCS\Kneeboard. Then, in this folder, create individual 
folders for each required module. The folder names must match the ones found in C:\Program 
Files\Eagle Dynamics\DCS World\Mods\aircraft. Afterwards, place the required image files 
(*.jpg; *.png) into the individual module folders. Filenames must not contain any non-latin 
script letters and must be 1024x680 or 1024x768 in size. While in the cockpit, bring up the

Create Weather Conditions 
 
The weather tool panel provides two options for setting the weather for the mission: Static 
conditions and Dynamic conditions. 
1. Static conditions - standard static weather formed by user settings. 
2. Dynamic conditions - weather formed by differences in the atmospheric pressure and 
dynamically changing during the mission. 
Static conditions 
The weather panel is divided into six functional sections: Season, Clouds and Atmosphere, Wind, 
Turbulence, Fog, Dust Smoke and Weather Templates. 
START.  The top of the window consist of the Start section and allows you to set the season 
the mission will take place in, and the sea level air temperature (in Celsius).  The left side drop 
down menu allows you to select from the four seasons: Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall.  The 
primary effect of changing the season will be to change how the terrain looks in the simulation.  
Additionally, many ground vehicles will have matching camouflage for the set season. 
The right-side field allows you to set the sea level temperature of the mission. The value can be 
changed by either using the left and right arrows or manually typing the value into the field.  
Note that air temperature will affect aircraft performance. 
CLOUDS AND ATMOSPHERE. This section allows you to define the cloud environment of the 
mission.  Note that the cloud environment for the mission will be static and does not change 
during the course of the mission.  From top to bottom, the cloud settings consist of the following 
controls: 
• 
BASE. Defines the altitude above sea level that will form the bottom of the cloud layer. 
This can be set between 300 and 5,000 meters and is indicated in the right-side field.  
Use the left and right arrows to change the value or drag the slider bar in the left field. 
• 
THICKNESS. Defines cloud layer thickness from the base level.  For example, if the 
Base were set at 2,000 meters and the Thickness was set to 1,000 meters, you would 
have clouds between 2,000 and 3,000 meters above sea level.  Note that thickness only 
applies to a solid cloud deck (Density 9 and 10) and not scattered clouds (Density 1 
through 8).  The cloud layer thickness can be adjusted using the left and right arrows or 
the slider bar. The selected thickness is displayed in the right-side field in meters. 
• 
DENSITY. The Density defines the population density of clouds in the mission.  Note 
that cloud cover is uniform throughout the simulation world.  Density is according to a 0 
to 10 scale.  0 defines no clouds; 1 through 8 defines scattered clouds with increasing 
levels of density; and 9 and 10 define a solid cloud layer deck (overcast).  Use the left 
and right arrows to select the desired density setting. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  113 
 
• 
PRECPTNS (Precipitations). The precipitation drop down menu allows you to set what 
type, if any, of precipitation will fall during the mission.  Choices include: None, Rain, 
Thunderstorm, Snow, and Snowstorm.  The selections will vary according to the selected 
season, temperature and cloud density.   
• 
QNH.  Also referred to as “Q Code”, this value sets the barometric air pressure in the 
mission. This is in reference to mmHg (millimeters of mercury) with Russian altimeters.

WIND.  Rather than a single wind direction and speed, the wind function allows you to set four 
distinct wind altitude bands: 10 – 500 – 2,000 – 8,000 meters.  These are indicated by the three 
lines within the Wind section of the Weather Tool.  To set the speed in meters per-second 
(m/s), use the left and right arrows.  Note that wind will be as a constant force without gusting.  
To the right of the wind speed setting is the wind direction setting.  This can be set in two ways.  
The first is to click on the radial dial to denote the direction you want the wind to blow in (North 
is indicated as the top of the dial). The second option is to input the value using the left and 
right arrow buttons.  The set direction that wind will blow in is indicated in the right field in 
degrees. For example, when set to 0 degrees (due north), the wind in the mission will blow from 
the south to the north. 
TURBULENCE. You may set air turbulence at 0.1 m/s increments at ground level. Turbulence 
will then decrease as altitude increases.  
FOG.  The fog setting controls: 
• 
FOG ENABLE. Set fog on or off. 
• 
VISIBILITY. Visibility in meters of objects obscured by fog. 
• 
THICKNESS. Use the scroll bar or left and right arrows to set how thick the fog layer 
will be.  A 0 (zero) setting denotes sea level.  For example, setting a value of 50 would 
place a uniform fog layer in the simulation world from 0 to 50 meters from sea level. 
DUST SMOKE. Dust smoke setting parameters: 
• 
DUST SMOKE ENABLE. Checkbox that enables or disables the dust smoke effect. 
• 
VISIBILITY. Sets the visibility range (in meters) of objects during a dust storm. 
WEATHER TEMPLATES.  Rather than require you to create weather conditions each time you 
create a mission, the editor provides you the means to load saved weather templates and even 
modify them.  These can be useful tools to save time when creating missions for a campaign.  
The Weather Template section has the following elements: 
• 
Template List.  On the left side of the template section is a drop-down list of saved 
weather templates.  To select a template, you must left mouse click on it.  Once 
selected, you will then need to click the LOAD button to load the template into the 
Weather settings tool. 
• 
LOAD selected template button. Once you have selected a weather template from 
the template list, press this button to LOAD 
 the template into the Weather settings 
tool. 
• 
SAVE button. If after loading a template you change its settings, you may then click

Dynamic conditions 
The Dynamic Conditions panel is divided into five functional sections: Start, Dynamic Weather, 
Turbulence, Fog, and Weather Templates. 
 
Using the dynamic weather panel, you can create a weather system (areas of different 
atmospheric pressures), which will result in dynamic wind and cloud generation in the mission. 
START.  The top of the window consist of the Start section and allows you to set the season 
the mission will take place in, and the sea level air temperature (in Celsius).  The left side drop 
down menu allows you to select from the four seasons: Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall.  The

• 
PRESSURE DEVIATION. Pressure deviation in the center of the selected pressure 
system from ISA International Standard Atmosphere, in Pascals. 
GENERATE. Generate a randomized weather system using the set parameters. 
Clouds and winds are generated on the entire map dynamically in the mission according to the 
type, locations and pressure deviations of the pressure systems. Wind conditions evolve during 
the mission according to the changes in the pressures and locations of the pressure systems. 
TURBULENCE. You may set air turbulence at 0.1 m/s increments at ground level. Turbulence 
will then decrease as altitude increases.  
FOG.  The fog setting controls: 
• 
FOG ENABLE. Set fog on or off.

Set Rules for Triggers 
 
An important part of making a good mission is the ability to script actions during the mission 
that lead to a more immersive experience for the player.  By setting actions that respond to the 
player and other AI units in an intelligent manner, the simulated battlefield can have a much 
more interactive and interesting environment.  Such actions could be the activation of units, 
text, and voice messages, or setting a flag state.  The conditions that are used to trigger such 
actions can range from units going in and out of defined areas of the map, units being 
destroyed or damaged, specified times, flag states, and even random states.  Using these tools 
and an active imagination, you can create your own engaging missions that no automatic 
mission generator can match.  The missions and campaigns use the same scripting system. 
The trigger system is not an "event" type system, but rather a "condition" type system; this 
means that a trigger does not occur when something occurs, but rather when a condition 
becomes TRUE.   
Setting a trigger condition is a three step process: 
1. Create a NEW trigger 
2. Create the condition(s) for the trigger 
3. Create the action(s) that will result from the trigger when the condition(s) are true. 
 
Upon selecting the set Triggers button, the TRIGGERS window will appear.  There are four 
primary elements to creating a mission trigger and each has its own pane in the window: 
Trigger List, Trigger Conditions, Trigger Actions and Initialization Script. For convenience, 
individual triggers may be assigned a color from the color palette provided below.

The CREATE button found under each list is used for the creation of new elements.  
Initialization Script 
The INITIALIZATION SCRIPT column is located on the lower block (of the mission editor.) This 
is used to load and reset the LUA script file in the mission to set the conditions for random 
spawning of unit groups. In the CONDITION field in the aircraft / helicopter / sea / ground 
group panel, the expression is written to the LUA using SSE tools.

Trigger List 
This left-most pane is used to create new triggers and list existing ones.  In the triggers listing 
pane, each trigger will be listed as a Type of trigger and then the name of the trigger in 
parenthesis.  For example: “ONCE (Set Area 01)”. 
 
 
 
At the bottom and top of the trigger list panel there are four controls that allow you to control 
triggers: 
NEW button.  Press the NEW button to create a new trigger.  When you create a new trigger, 
you will need to set the TYPE and give it a unique name that briefly describes its function.  Be 
careful in naming your triggers so that there is not mass-confusion when you have a long list of 
triggers! 
DELETE button.  Press the DELETE button to remove a trigger from the list.  You will first need 
to click on the trigger you wish to remove before pressing the DELETE button. 
CLONE button. Used to create an identical copy of the selected trigger in the list. 
Up and Down arrows. Used to move the selected trigger up or down in the list. 
 
TYPE drop down field.  Using this drop down, you can set when and how the trigger event will 
be cued.  For example, you may want the trigger to only happen once, or you may want it to 
happen each time defined conditions are met.  You have four options: 
1. ONCE. The trigger will be executed only once after the condition is evaluated as true.  
Once set as true, the condition is removed from memory.  For example, if you want a

message to show only the first time an aircraft enters an area, you would use the ONCE 
option. 
Trigger Behavior: 
Condition: Evaluated Continuously, until it is evaluated as "True". Then removed from 
the list of evaluations. 
Action: Activated Once, when condition is "true". 
Example: 
You want to spawn a AAA backup-group when another Armor-group is dead. 
• 
Add a "ONCE" Trigger. 
• 
Add a "Group Dead" condition and select the Armored-group that must be dead. 
• 
Add a "Activate Group" and select the AAA-group you want to activate. 
The group being activated will be activated once when the first group is dead. 
Hint: Remember to set the AAA-group to 23-hours of delay, so it stays inactive until 
activated. 
2. REPETITIVE ACTION. The Repetitive Action trigger checks the trigger's conditions 
each second. Each second the conditions return true, the actions are performed; each 
second the conditions are false, no action is not performed. 
 
Trigger-Behavior: 
Condition: Evaluated Continuously. 
Action: Repeated every time as long as the conditions stays "True". 
Example: 
You want to set up a (short) alarm-sound after a group of units have entered a Zone. 
• 
Add a "REPETITIVE ACTION" trigger. 
• 
Add a "Unit in Zone" condition, select the appropriate unit and zone to enter. 
• 
Add a "Sound" action, select the <nnn-sound> in the sound browser. 
The sound will now replay every 1 second after the unit has entered the Zone. 
3. SWITCHED CONDITION.  The trigger will perform the set action(s) every time the 
trigger’s condition is checked and evaluated as true and its previous state was false.  For 
example, such a trigger can be used to show a text message whenever a particular unit 
enters a trigger zone. The first time the unit enters the zone, the trigger action will be 
activated, because the previous check of the trigger conditions was evaluated as false 
(unit was not in zone). The trigger will not activate any longer as long as the unit is 
inside the zone, because the previous check of the trigger conditions will be evaluated as 
true (unit remains inside zone). However, if the unit exists the zone and then re-enters it 
again, the conditions will have once again switched from false to true and the trigger 
action will be activated.  


ED [DCS USER MANUAL] 
 
122 
MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
Trigger Behavior: 
Condition: Evaluated Continuously.  
Action: Repeatable, Once per condition-set changes from "False" -> "True". Actions will 
be performed again on the next "Switched state-change". 
Example: 
You want to perform a action each time a unit enters a zone. This differs from them 
"being in a zone". 
• 
Add a "SWITCHED CONDITION" trigger. 
• 
Add a "Unit in Zone" condition, select a unit and zone to check. 
• 
Add a "Message" of "A unit is trespassing our Zone!" 
Now each time the unit enters the Zone you will get the message Once. The unit needs 
to leave and reenter the Zone again to show the message again. 
4. MISSION START. The trigger will only be checked at mission start. For example, if you 
wanted to set multiple units to a random activation, you would use this option to 
evaluate this condition and determine which units are included in the mission according 
to the set percentage. 
Trigger Behavior: 
Condition: Evaluated Once, at mission startup. 
Action: Performed Once, at mission startup. 
Example: 
You want to activate a random group at startup of the mission. 
• 
Add a "MISSION START" Trigger. 
• 
Add a "RANDOM" condition, set it to 10% 
• 
Add a "Activate group" action, select the group you want to give 10% chance. 
NAME field. Manually enter the name of the trigger in this field. 
EVENT field. Setting an event for a trigger limits the trigger's conditions to being evaluated only 
when the set events occur. With no event set, trigger conditions are evaluated once per second 
throughout the duration of the mission, unless already expired and removed from memory. In a 
trigger-heavy mission, this can cost considerable CPU cycles and affect gameplay performance. 
Setting triggers to events can reduce the CPU workload and also provide some unique trigger 
mechanisms. The following events are available: 
• 
NO EVENT. There's no event. 
• 
ON DESTROY. Trigger's conditions are evaluated whenever any unit is destroyed. 
• 
ON SHOT. Trigger's conditions are evaluated whenever any weapon is fired. 
• 
ON CRASH. Trigger's conditions are evaluated whenever the player crashes. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  123 
 
• 
ON EJECT. Trigger's conditions are evaluated whenever the player ejects. 
• 
ON REFUEL. Trigger's conditions are evaluated whenever the player begins to air refuel. 
• 
ON PILOT DEAD. Trigger's conditions are evaluated whenever the player is killed. 
• 
ON BASE CAPTURED. Trigger's conditions are evaluated whenever an airbase or FARP is 
captured. 
• 
ON TAKE CONTROL. Trigger's conditions are evaluated whenever the player takes 
control of an aircraft. 
• 
ON REFUEL STOP. Trigger's conditions are evaluated whenever the player stops to air 
refuel. 
• 
ON FAILURE. Trigger's conditions are evaluated whenever the player's aircraft suffers a 
system failure. 
• 
ON MISSION START. Trigger conditions are evaluated whenever a mission starts. 
• 
ON MISSION ENDS. Trigger conditions are evaluated whenever the mission ends.

Trigger Conditions 
The central unit of the trigger panel contains a list of trigger conditions. 
 
 
 
Once you have created a trigger, you will then need to set the conditions that govern when the 
trigger will be set to true or false.  To do so, you first need to click on the trigger you want to 
set conditions for by clicking on it from the trigger list.  Upon doing so, press the NEW button 
below the CONDITIONS pane. 
 
NEW button.  Press the NEW button to create a new condition for the selected trigger.  Please 
note that you can create multiple conditions for a single trigger!  When you create a new 
condition, you will need to set the TYPE and define additional data that varies according to the 
TYPE. Each new condition you create will be listed in the condition pane list. 
When multiple trigger conditions are set, they operate with an "AND" operator. In other words, 
all of the conditions must be true for the trigger to be activated. To separate conditions with an 
"OR" operator, press the OR button in the conditions pane. In this case, the condition(s) either 
above or below the "OR" operator will activate the trigger.

All airfields with no aircraft assigned for take-off or landing and with no ground units of 
either coalition within a 2,000 m. radius are neutral. Any ground unit present within a 
2,000 m. radius of an airfield will capture the airfield for the coalition of the ground unit. 
If ground units of both coalitions are present within a 2,000 m. radius of an airfield, the 
airfield is contested and not assigned to either coalition. In cases when armed ground 
units of one coalition are present within a 2,000 m. radius of an airfield at the same time 
as unarmed ground units of the other coalition, the coalition of the armed units will 
capture the airfield.

• 
EXPLODE UNIT. From this action, select a unit that you wish to explode as a result of 
this action. You can use the volume setting to determine the size of the explosion. 
 
• 
EXPLOSION. To have an explosion appear in the mission based on a resulting action, 
you can use this action. The three values you need to set include the name of the zone 
that the explosion will occur in, the altitude the explosion will occur, and the size 
(volume) of the explosion. 
 
• 
FLAG DECREASE. This action allows you to set a defined flag to decrease in value. Use 
the FLAG field left and right arrows to set the flag number or manually enter it in the 
field. Use the VALUE field left and right arrow keys to set the value by which to decrease 
or manually enter it in the field. 
 
Example. Flag 5 is indicated (with a current value of 10) and given value 4. When the 
action is triggered, the current value of 10 will be reduced by the given value, 4, and as 
a result, the resulting value of the flag will be 6. 
The flag value may have negative numbers. If, as a result of subtraction, the flag value 
becomes equal to 0, the flag will be removed. 
• 
FLAG INCREASE. This action allows you to set a defined flag to increase in value. Use 
the FLAG field left and right arrows to set the flag number or manually enter it in the 
field. Use the VALUE field left and right arrow keys to set the value by which to increase 
or manually enter it in the field.

Example. Flag 5 is indicated (with current value 1) and given value 10. When the action 
is triggered, the given value of 10 will be added to the current value of 1, and as a 
result, the flag value will then be 11. 
• 
FLAG OFF.  This action allows you to clear a defined flag number to false.  Use the 
FLAG field left and right arrows to set the flag number or manually enter it in the field. 
The value of the removed flag is 0. 
 
• 
FLAG ON.  This action allows you to set a defined flag number to be true.  Use the FLAG 
field left and right arrows to set the flag number or manually enter it in the field. 
In the current implementation, flags have two attributes: the flag name (natural number) 
and the flag value (natural number). When a flag is created, the name is set in the field 
labelled FLAG, and the default assigned value is 1. 
 
Example. Flag 5 has a value of 1. 
You can increase or decrease the value of the flag with the corresponding actions. 
• 
FLAG SET RANDOM VALUE. This action allows you to set a defined flag to a random 
value. Use the FLAG field left and right arrows to set the flag number or manually enter 
it in the field. Use the VALUE LIM MIN and VALUE LIM MAX fields left and right arrow 
keys to set the range of possible values for the flag or manually enter them in the fields. 
 
Example. Flag 1 is specified with the minimum value of 10 and maximum value of 20. 
When the action is triggered, flag 1 will be assigned a random value from 10 to 20, for 
example 12. 
• 
GROUP ACTIVATE. By default, units appear automatically in a mission once the 
mission starts.  However, using the Activate group action, you can set unit groups to

only appear in the mission according to the set conditions.  Common rules to govern the 
appearance of an Activated group are TIME MORE, FLAG IS TRUE, UNIT IN ZONE and 
RAMDOM.  IMPORTANT: FOR A GROUP TO BE ACTIVATED VIA A CONDITION YOU 
MUST SET THE GROUP’S START TIME BEYOND ANY ANTICIPATED PLAY TIME IN THE 
MISSION, SUCH AS AT LEAST 1 DAY AFTER THE MISSION STARTS!  For example, if the 
mission starting time is 12:00:00/1 (default mission start time), you can set the group to 
start at 12:00:11/2. 
 
• 
GROUP AI OFF. Disable the artificial intelligence of all units in the selected group.  The 
group will stop all movement, sensor operations and will not engage in combat. 
 
• 
GROUP AI ON. Activate the artificial intelligence of all units in the selected group.  Only 
possible after use of the GROUP AI OFF action on the group.

Cockpit Triggers Guide 
The cockpit triggers utilized in ED Simulators allow a mission designer to create a wide variety of 
triggers that evaluate the state of cockpit switches and instruments. This data can be used to 
provide feedback and instruction to the player using text and voice prompts, as well as 3D 
graphical highlights of cockpit elements. 
Although cockpit triggers are considered a developer's tool, most of their functionality is open to 
the player. There are some examples, however, which require the use of the in-game console, 
which is disabled in public builds. 
Cockpit triggers are utilized similarly for all DCS flyable aircraft. A number of aircraft script files 
(.LUA) are used to obtain data used by the triggers. Each DCS aircraft includes a collection of 
script files in its own dedicated folder, found in X:\DCS\Mods\aircrafts\Aircraft 
Name\Cockpit\Scripts. The specific .LUA files used by cockpit triggers will be referenced below. 
To ease the workload of a mission designer working with cockpit triggers, a cockpit arguments 
guide has been prepared for the A-10C cockpit and can be found here: A-10C Cockpit 
arguments. 
.LUA files should only be opened with a proper code editor, such as Notepad++. When working 
with the scripts, the Search function [Ctrl +F] can be very helpful in locating the desired 
sections of code. 
CONDITIONS 
The conditions and actions of the triggers use the command numbers, which can be found in 
the corresponding Scripts folder of each aircraft along the path DCS\Mods\aircraft\Aircraft 
Name\Cockpit\Scripts: 
\Mods\aircraft\Aircraft Name\Cockpit\Scripts\command_defs.lua – command numbers; 
\Mods\aircraft\Aircraft Name\Cockpit\Scripts\clickabledata.lua – button command numbers; 
\Mods\aircraft\Aircraft Name\Cockpit\Scripts\devices.lua – device ID numbers in the cockpit. 
 
X: COCKPIT ARGUMENT IN RANGE. The position of every cockpit control and instrument is 
defined by a custom argument ID and valid value range. This trigger checks for a set cockpit 
argument to be within a set value range. This is most often used to evaluate switch and button 
states with discrete argument values (such as ‘0’ for off and ‘1’ for on or in decimal values 
between 0 and 1 for multi-position switches). However, it can also be used to evaluate the 
position of needle instruments, such as airspeed or vertical velocity, etc. 


ED [DCS USER MANUAL]

MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
 
• 
ARGUMENT – sets the ID number of the cockpit argument to check. Clickable cockpit 
functions (switches, buttons, knobs, etc.) are described in DCS\Mods\aircrafts\Aircraft 
Name\Cockpit\Scripts\clickabledata.lua. Non-clickable cockpit arguments, such as 
instruments are described in DCS\Mods\aircrafts\Aircraft 
Name\Cockpit\Scripts\mainpanel_init.lua. The variable “arg” describes the argument ID. 
The variable “arg_value” describes the increment of each movement of the argument. 
The variable “arg_limit” describes the limits of the argument’s range of movement.  
• 
MIN – sets the minimum value of the set argument, which will satisfy the condition to 
execute the trigger. Valid value range is -1 to 1. 
• 
MAX – sets the maximum value of the set argument, which will satisfy the condition to 
execute the trigger. Valid value range is -1 to 1. 
Note, to successfully evaluate an argument, you may need to enter a MIN and MAX range that 
is inclusive of the desired value. For example, when evaluating an argument to equal to “0.5”, 
enter “0.49” for MIN and “0.51” for MAX. 
X: COCKPIT HIGHLIGHT IS VISIBLE. Checks for a set cockpit highlight to be displayed. 
Each cockpit highlight is assigned an ID by the mission designer. This trigger evaluates whether 
a specific highlight is displayed in the cockpit. 
• 
ID – sets the ID value of the cockpit highlight to check (as set by X: COCKPIT 
HIGHLIGHT ELEMENT/INDICATION/POINT trigger actions). 
 
X: COCKPIT INDICATION TEXT IS EQUAL TO (requires console) – checks the contents of a 
set cockpit digital indication string. Digital indicators in the cockpit are individually identified by 
an ID number in the .LUA files. Each indicator displays a collection of display elements. This 
trigger evaluates whether a specific display element of a set indicator matches the desired string 
of characters. This is a very useful method of evaluating whether the correct avionics 
parameters are set-up on the digital displays. 
• 
INDICATOR ID – sets the ID value of the cockpit indicator containing the desired 
element. Indicator ID’s are described in DCS\Mods\aircrafts\Aircraft 
Name\Cockpit\Scripts\device_init.lua. To quickly locate the indicator ID’s in the .LUA file, 
perform a search function for “indicators”. Indicator ID's begin with ‘0’ at the top of the 
table and are increased by 1 with each subsequent indicator in the table. For example, 
the HUD ID for A-10C is ‘5’. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  157 
 
• 
ELEM NAME (element name) – sets the name of the display element containing the 
desired string. To obtain an element name, run a mission with the desired element string 
displayed in the cockpit, open the game console and execute the 
“console.out(list_indication(n))” command (where ‘n’ is the desired indicator’s ID). The 
game console can be accessed by pressing the “`” command in-game. The 
console.out(list_indication(n)) console command will list all currently displayed elements 
with their associated strings for the set indicator. Note, the element name entry must 
match the element name exactly, including capitals and spaces (spaces may be present 
as initial characters). 
• 
VALUE – sets the character string, which will satisfy the condition to execute the trigger. 
Note, the string entry must match the element string exactly, including capitals and 
spaces (spaces may be present as initial characters). 
 
EXAMPLE: To setup a trigger in A-10C that checks for the TAD map range to be set to 40 miles, 
enter “1” for indicator ID to set this to the left MFCD, enter “TAD_scale” as the element name 
and enter “40” as the desired string. 
X: COCKPIT PARAM EQUAL TO (requires console) – checks for the desired setting of a set 
cockpit parameter. This trigger evaluates a number of specially-designed cockpit parameter 
trackers for the A-10C (such as TGP zoom level, steerpoint name, etc.). 
 
• 
PARAM (parameter) – sets the name of the parameter to check. To obtain a parameter 
name, run a mission with the desired parameter active, open the game console and 
execute the “console.out(list_cockpit_params())” command. The game console can be 
accessed by pressing the “`” command in-game. The console.out(list_cockpit_params()) 
console command will display the current states of all cockpit parameters. 
• 
VALUE – sets the parameter setting, which will satisfy the condition to execute the 
trigger. Note, depending on the parameter, the value may be a numerical or alphabetical 
string. 
X: COCKPIT PARAM IN RANGE (requires console) – checks for the set cockpit parameter to 
be within the set value range. This trigger evaluates a number of specially-designed cockpit 
parameter trackers (such as TGP zoom level, steerpoint name, etc.). 
• 
PARAM (parameter) – sets the name of the parameter to check. To obtain a parameter 
name, run a mission with the desired parameter in effect, open the game console and 
execute the “console.out(list_cockpit_params())” command. The game console can be

MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
accessed by pressing the “`” command in-game. The console.out(list_cockpit_params()) 
console command will display the current states of all cockpit parameters. 
• 
MIN – sets the minimum value of the set parameter, which will satisfy the condition to 
execute the trigger. Valid value range is -1^9 to 1^9. 
• 
MAX – sets the maximum value of the set parameter, which will satisfy the condition to 
execute the trigger. Valid value range is -1^9 to 1^9. 
 
X: COCKPIT PARAM IS EQUAL TO ANOTHER – checks for the set parameter value to be 
identical to another parameter’s value. This trigger can be used in conjunction with the X: 
COCKPIT PARAM SAVE AS action in order to compare parameter values at different points in the 
mission. 
 
• 
PARAM (parameter) – sets the name of the first parameters to evaluate. To obtain a 
parameter name, run a mission with the desired parameter in effect, open the game 
console and execute the “console.out(list_cockpit_params())” command. The game 
console can be accessed by pressing the “`” command in-game. The 
console.out(list_cockpit_params()) console command will display the current states of all 
cockpit parameters. 
• 
PARAM (parameter) – sets the name of the second parameter to evaluate. 
Note, one of the two parameter variables may be a custom parameter name saved using the   
X: COCKPIT PARAM SAVE AS action. 
ACTIONS 
The conditions and actions of the triggers use the command numbers, which can be found in 
the corresponding Scripts folder of each aircraft along the path DCS\Mods\aircraft\Aircraft 
Name\Cockpit\Scripts:

table and are increased by 1 with each subsequent indicator in the table. For example, 
the HUD ID for A-10C is ‘5’. 
• 
ELEM NAME (element name) – sets the name of the display element to highlight. To 
obtain an element name, run a mission with the desired element string displayed in the 
cockpit, open the game console and execute the “console.out(list_indication(n))” 
command (where ‘n’ is the desired indicator’s ID). The game console can be accessed by 
pressing the “`” command in-game. The console.out(list_indication(n)) console 
command will list all current element strings of the set indicator. 
• 
SIZE OF BOX – sets the span of the highlight in meters. 
 
X: COCKPIT HIGHLIGHT POINT – enables a cockpit highlight centered at the specified 3D 
cockpit coordinates. This action allows you to specify the 3D dimensions of the highlight, which

can be useful for creating “flat” 2D highlights of panel instruments in either horizontal or vertical 
planes. 
• 
ID – sets the ID of the highlight. The ID can be referenced by other triggers to evaluate 
the status of or remove the highlight. 
• 
X (FWD/AFT) – sets the highlight position on the X (forward/aft) axis of the cockpit in 
meters. 
• 
Y (UP/DN) – sets the highlight position on the Y (up/down) axis of the cockpit in 
meters. 
• 
Z (RGT/LFT) – sets the highlight position on the Z (right/left) axis of the cockpit in 
meters. 
• 
BOX DIM, X – sets the span of the highlight’s X axis in meters. 
• 
BOX DIM, Y – sets the span of the highlight’s Y axis in meters. 
• 
BOX DIM, Z – sets the span of the highlight’s Z axis in meters. 
 
X: COCKPIT PARAM SAVE AS (requires console) – save the current value of the specified 
cockpit parameter as a new parameter. This trigger allows you to save the state of a parameter 
for later evaluation during the mission. 
• 
SOURCE – sets the name of the parameter for which the value will be saved. To obtain 
a parameter name, run a mission with the desired parameter in effect, open the game 
console and execute the “console.out(list_cockpit_params())” command. The game 
console can be accessed by pressing the “`” command in-game. The 
console.out(list_cockpit_params()) console command will display the current states of all 
cockpit parameters. 
• 
DESTINATION – sets the name of the new parameter, under which the value of the 
saved parameter will be stored while the mission is running. 
 
X: COCKPIT PERFORM CLICKABLE ACTION – sets the specified cockpit control to the 
specified position. This trigger can be used to force-set a required cockpit control (for example 
to engage autopilot mode).

• 
COCKPIT DEVICE – sets the ID value of the cockpit device manipulated by the 
required control. Device ID’s are described in DCS\Mods\aircrafts\Aircraft 
Name\Cockpit\Scripts\devices.lua. Device ID’s begin with ‘1’ at the top of the table and 
are increased by 1 with each subsequent device in the table. For example, the ID for 
autopilot is ‘38’. 
• 
COMMAND – sets the command value for the required control, starting with a base 
value of 3000. Command values are described in DCS\Mods\aircrafts\Aircraft 
Name\Cockpit\Scripts\clickabledata.lua, using the argument 
“device_commands.Button_n” (where ‘n’ is the command value of interest). To quickly 
locate a desired command in the .LUA file, perform a search for relevant terms (such as 
“autopilot” or “MFCD”). For example, the command to engage the autopilot in A-10C is 
scripted as “device_commands.Button_2”. As such, it would be entered in the Command 
field as “3002”. 
• 
VALUE – sets the argument value (control position in the cockpit). Control arguments 
are described in DCS\Mods\aircrafts\Aircraft Name\Cockpit\Scripts\clickabledata.lua. The 
variable “arg” describes the argument ID (not necessary for this trigger). The variable 
“arg_value” describes the increment of each movement of the argument. The variable 
“arg_limit” describes the limits of the argument’s range of movement. 
 
X: COCKPIT REMOVE HIGHLIGHT – removes the specified cockpit highlight. 
• 
ID – sets the ID of the cockpit highlight to remove. 
 
X: PREVENT CONTROLS SYNCHRONIZATION – This trigger can be used at the start of the 
mission to disable synchronization of cockpit controls with the actual controls on the player's

Trigger Practical Exercise 
Now that we have reviewed the mechanics of the Trigger system, we will create a basic mission 
using trigger scripting.  In this mission, we will do the following: 
 
1. Player will fly to battle area, and when nearing this area, friendly artillery will bombard 
an enemy position. 
2. As the player flies closer, they will receive a Forward Air Controller message about tasked 
targeting. 
3. When the player destroys enemy armor in the target area, friendly ground forces will 
advance. 
4. When friendly forces reach their objective, they will radio the player of a successful 
mission. 
 
The first thing we will do is set up the Zone triggers.  So, I will create three different trigger 
zones, and I will call these Start Artillery, FAC Message, and Mission Success.  I will set the TYPE 
as ONCE for each of them. 
 
 
 
I will now set up the conditions and actions for each of these triggers. 


ED [DCS USER MANUAL]

MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
 
For the Start Artillery trigger, I will create a NEW condition and set the TYPE to UNIT INSIDE 
ZONE.  In the UNIT field I will select the player’s aircraft (Player) and in the ZONE I will select 
Start Artillery.  The Start Artillery zone is one I created with the trigger zone creation tool that 
we’ll discuss later. 
 
 
To set the action, I will press NEW and then select GROUP ACTIVATE as the ACTION. With that 
selected, I will set the Arty-01 as the Group.  Because this is to be an activated group, I set its 
START TIME in the Group Properties to a time past the anticipated mission start time. 
 
The next trigger zone we will script is the FAC Message.  To do so I will select the FAC Message 
from the triggers list and then click the NEW button in the Conditions pane.  Again, I will select 
UNIT IN ZONE as the TYPE and the UNIT as PLAYER.  However, for this trigger I will set the 
ZONE as FAC Message. 
 
For the action, I want both a text message and audio message to play.  So, I will first press the 
NEW button in the Actions pane and check that the MESSAGE TO ALL action is selected.  I will 
then enter a text message in the TEXT box. 
 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  167 
 
 
 
I now need to set the second (audio) action for this trigger by pressing the NEW button again 
but this time selecting the SOUND TO ALL option as my ACTION.  I will then press the OPEN 
button and use the browser to select the audio file I wish to play. 
 
The third trigger zone condition action we will create will be for the Mission Success message.  
This will trigger when the friendly ground forces reach the objective.  The objective will be 
defined as one of the trigger zones I had created. 
 
I will create a NEW condition and set the TYPE to UNIT IN ZONE.  In the UNIT field, I will select 
one of the friendly armor units (BTR-01) and in the ZONE field, I will select Objective.

The next trigger we will create is one that allows the friendly ground units to advance from their 
starting location once the blocking enemy force is destroyed.  To do so, we will first create a 
new trigger as a ONCE TYPE and call it Advance.  Now we will create a NEW condition and set 
the TYPE to GROUP DEAD.  From there, we will set the UNIT to the enemy armor units that are 
blocking our path (Objective-01).  For the Action, we will create a new one by clicking the NEW 
button and then setting the ACTION to GROUP ACTIVATE.  From the GROUP drop down list I 
will select our friendly ground force platoon that will activate and advance when the blocking 
force is destroyed.  Remember that I needed to set the START TIME value of the friendly 
ground forces (BTR-01) to a time past the mission play time. 
 
The final trigger we will place in this example is an enemy air defense that is assigned a random 
chance of appearing in the mission.  We will create a new ONCE trigger and call it Random AAA.  
Next, we will create a NEW condition and set the TYPE to RANDOM.  In the % field, we will 
choose 50 (as in 50%).

AAA.  In the unit placement window, there is also the option to have activated unit visible or 
invisible before it is active in the world.

Define Mission Goals 
 
When evaluating a mission for success, draw, or failure, the simulation uses point totals that are 
assigned by the mission builder.  If total points at the end of a mission are 49 or less, the 
mission is a failure; if total points equal 50, the mission is a draw.  If total points are 51 or 
higher, the mission is deemed a success.  This point total is also used to define which stage and 
mission may be chosen next in a campaign. 
The same set of conditions used in the Trigger system is also used to define mission goals.  In 
the Goal window, the list of all created goals is displayed in the top pane.  Once a goal is 
selected by clicking on it, the conditions of the goal are listed in the bottom pane. 
 
 
 
To create a New goal, press the NEW button under the MISSION GOALS pane.  Upon doing so,

Task Planning for Unit Groups 
Fundamental Concepts 
Mission building involves creating unit groups, planning of group routes and combat tasks, and 
developing a dynamic battlefield atmosphere using triggered events, mission weather and time 
of day settings. 
When designing a mission, you can choose one of two basic approaches to creating battle 
scenarios: 
1. Simple: Place and route groups with minimal adjustments of default route and task 
settings (actions to determine behavior will be created automatically). 
2. Advanced: Use the Advanced Actions Panel of the Group Properties Menu for precise 
manual control over group actions. 
The first method requires minimum use of the interface to create simple missions with the idea 
that AI groups will act generally as envisioned by the designer, but using automatic behavior 
actions programmed into the AI based on factors such as presence of enemy units, contact 
range, etc. In this approach, the AI will generally move along its route and engage enemy units 
as soon as they are within engagement range, which can vary based on the unit type and task 
(in case of aircraft groups). 
However, the automated AI actions created by default may not always produce the desired 
results. In particular, if the mission calls for complex AI actions, for example attacking only 
certain types of ground units in different target areas or restrictions on the use of particular 
weapons, the desired behavior may be achieved more effectively by using the Advanced Actions 
Panel to create and configure group actions in detail. Although more time consuming and 
complex, this allows for much greater flexibility and control in scripting AI behavior in the 
mission. 
Actions refer to the various behaviors a mission designer can script for the AI to perform in the 
mission. Before we describe all of the advanced actions in detail, you should understand the 
following terms: Group Artificial Intelligence, Task, Enroute Task, Command and Option. 
Tasks and Enroute Tasks are the primary combat actions and include a number of different 
targeting and engagement options for air, ground and naval groups. For example, a task to 
attack an enemy group or to act as a Forward Air Controller (FAC) in providing targeting 
commands to other friendly units. All Tasks and Enroute Tasks are actions performed over a 
period of time. Commands are instantaneous actions, such as setting a radio frequency for the 
group. Options are rules or limitations imposed on the group in executing an action. 
All actions include a number of conditions the mission designer can set to control the starting 
and ending of the action. These include setting a mission time for starting and/or ending the 
action, action duration time, flag states (on/off), action activation probability, and custom 
scripting in LUA code language. 
 


ED [DCS USER MANUAL] 
 
176 
MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
Group Artifical Intelligence (AI) 
Group Artificial Intelligence is a virtual object (represented by the lead unit of a group) that 
controls game units or a group of units. The AI executes the actions set for the group in the 
mission editor. In doing so, the object follows behavior rules programmed into the simulation by 
the developers, however its behavior can also be adjusted by the mission designer using the 
tasking options available in the Advanced Actions Panel. Note, actions are set for entire groups 
only and not for individual units within a group. 
 
When creating a group route, the mission designer can add or edit the actions for the group to 
perform at each waypoint (WP) of the route. Actions of a given waypoint are activated once the 
group leader reaches the waypoint. The actions are performed sequentially based on their order 
and/or priority setting. Priority is set as a whole number, starting with 0 as the highest priority 
value. Actions can also be set in the Trigger Menu of the mission editor to be activated 
independently of the route waypoints. 
Perform Task 
Task actions involve combat engagement, targeting and maneuvering. By setting a Perform 
Task, the mission designer commands the AI to perform a specific combat function at a specific 
point in the mission. For example: orbit on station, engage an enemy group, provide targeting 
to other groups as a FAC. Tasks have the highest execution priority for the AI and are generally 
used to set the primary group action for a waypoint. The AI will perform multiple Tasks one at a 
time according to their order or priority setting. 
Task execution can be ended either by the AI automatically in-game or according to the action 
stop conditions set by the mission designer. For example, the AI will cease to attack a 
designated group of enemy vehicles when all of the vehicles in the group are destroyed or the 
AI group has exhausted its supply of usable weapons. Alternatively, the AI can be forced to 
cease the attack by setting an action stop condition, such as an action duration time limit. 
Start Enroute Task 
Like Perform Tasks, Start Enroute Tasks are combat actions that involve targeting or 
engagement actions. However, Start Enroute Tasks are designed to be active for the length of 
the group's route and can be executed multiple times and in multiple locations as long as the 
conditions for executing the Start Enroute Task are in effect and the AI is able to execute the 
action. As such, Start Enroute Tasks assume periodic interruptions of route navigation to 
perform the action, such as attacking "pop-up" enemy units detected along the route. 
Whereas Tasks involve definitely known and pre-set targets, Start Enroute Tasks allow for some 
uncertainty in target type or location. The key phrase to keep in mind when using Start Enroute 
Tasks is "Search For...". This means the AI will actively search for the target and perform an 
attack only when the target is detected. 
Start Enroute Tasks can only be ended by action stop conditions set by the mission designer. 
Otherwise, an Start Enroute Task will be active for the duration of the AI's "life" in the mission. 
Numerous Start Enroute Tasks can be active simultaneously, however only one Start Enroute 
Task can be executed at a time. If conditions for multiple Start Enroute Tasks are true (for 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  177 
 
example, enemy groups designated in two different Start Enroute Tasks are detected 
simultaneously), one Start Enroute Task will be selected by the AI to perform based on its order 
or priority setting.  
Note, any Task will always have a higher priority over any concurrent Start Enroute Task (unless 
set otherwise manually by the mission designer). As such, an Start Enroute Task can be 
interrupted by a Task and resumed after its completion. 
Perform Command 
A Command is an instantaneous group action that is executed immediately upon activation. For 
example, a Set Frequency command action will change the group's radio communications 
frequency. Like Tasks and Enroute Tasks, the conditions for executing Commands can be 
customized by the mission designer and include mission time, flags state, command activation 
probability, and custom scripting in LUA code language. 
Set Option 
Options set rules for the group for the duration of the mission, unless started and ended at 
specific waypoints. Options are set using the format:<variable>=<value>, such as 
Formation=Trail. Using such options, the mission designer can control the AI's use of sensors 
and weapons when performing actions. For example, the <Radar Use> option setting to 
<Never> can be used to script a radar-silent intercept. 
 
All actions can be tied to route waypoints or set independently of the route using the AI Task 
action of the Trigger Menu of the mission editor. In the latter case, the action will be executed 
when the rules of the trigger are in effect, as opposed to passing a waypoint. 
 
A more thorough overview of all AI actions will be provided below. 
 
Panel Flags 
"Flag" variables in the form of a checkbox are used extensively to enable/disable various options 
in the panels of the Group Properties Menu. Do not confuse this with the FLAG ON/FLAG OFF 
trigger rule and action in the Trigger Menu of the mission editor. You can think of panel flags as 
"locks".

In conclusion, some of the main steps in creating a mission include: creating unit groups, 
placing the group routes on the map, setting up group main tasks (for aircraft groups), 
configuring the group actions using the Advanced Actions Panel (Tasks, Enroute Tasks, 
Commands, Options), creating triggers to script certain group actions in addition to those set 
with route waypoints. 
 
 
 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  179 
 
Group Route Planning 
When placing group routes, one of the basic functions to set will be the desired speed 
("SPEED") and estimated time of arrival ("ETA") for each waypoint. 
 
 
 
Depending on the plans of the mission designer, one, both or neither of these values can be 
"locked" at each waypoint using the panel flags. When either value is locked by the user, the 
mission editor automatically calculates the other value based on the known range between 
consecutive waypoints. 
Locking speed and ETA values requires a logical consistency between waypoint lock settings as 
not every combination of speed and ETA lock is always possible. The route waypoint locks must 
be arranged such that the AI always retains a reference time value somewhere along the route. 
Using an example of a relatively simple route consisting of 4 waypoints, the following 6 
combinations of lock settings are valid. 
The Red Coalition has the following three designations for WP: 
1. SP – Starting Point, 
2. WP … – Waypoint Route Number, 
3. DP – Destination Point. 
Speed and ETA for the 
selected waypoint 
 
Selected waypoint # 
 


ED [DCS USER MANUAL]

MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
The Blue Coalition has all its WP set to zero by default. 
Example 1 
User locks: 
• 
Group start time (Т0), i.e. ETA for WP0; 
• 
ETA for the final waypoint (Т3); 
In this case, the user doesn't control the speed and ETAs for waypoints 1 and 2 or the speed for 
WP3. These values are calculated by the mission editor automatically. The mission editor 
calculates the average speed for the route to reach WP3 at the designated ETA. Note that the 
desired speed refers to the speed to the waypoint, i.e. the speed the AI group will assume once 
it passes the preceding waypoint. 
The AI group will attempt to adjust its speed for WP1, WP2 and WP3 as necessary to arrive at 
WP3 at the locked ETA. 
 
 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  181 
 
 
 
If the user unlocks the ETA for either WP0 or WP3, the route will no longer be valid, because 
the mission editor will not have a time reference for calculating the desired speeds for WP1 and 
WP2. When a route is invalid, the speed and ETA checkboxes become framed in red to indicate 
an error and a corresponding message appears when the user attempts to close the Group 
Properties Menu or save the mission. 
In order to unlock both the speed and ETA of a waypoint, at least one preceding and 
subsequent waypoint must have a locked ETA! 
Example 2 
User locks: 
• 
Group start time (Т0), i.e. ETA for WP0; 
• 
Speed (V0 – V3) for each waypoint; 
In this case, the user doesn't control the ETAs for any waypoints after the initial waypoint, but 
wants to ensure the group maintains a desired speed along the route. The mission editor 
automatically calculates the ETAs for WP1, WP2, WP3 based on the known range and locked 
desired speed of the waypoints:

User locks: 
• 
Group start time (Т0), i.e. ETA for WP0;  
• 
ETA for all other waypoints (Т1, Т2, Т3); 
In this case, the user wants to ensure the waypoints are reached at the designated ETAs. The 
AI group will attempt to maintain speed for each waypoint such that it arrives at each waypoint 
at the designated ETA. 
The mission editor calculates the desired speed for each waypoint based on the known range 
and ETA between consecutive waypoints:

Desired speed for WP1 and WP3 (V1, V3); 
In this case, the user controls the ETA for WP3 and also the travel speed for WP1 and WP3. 
Such a route is valid, because there is at least one waypoint (in this case WP2) between the 
starting and ending waypoints, which has both the speed and ETA unlocked, allowing the 
mission editor to automatically calculate both values as needed to meet the desired settings for 
WP0, WP1 and WP3. 
The AI group will attempt to adjust its speed for WP2 such that it will arrive at WP3 at the 
designated ETA and desired speed.

If the SPEED or ETA value is outside of the valid range for the particular unit (such as desired 
speed below the minimum flying speed), the SPEED and ETA checkboxes become framed in red 
to indicate an invalid value warning and a corresponding message appears when the user 
attempts to close the Group Properties Menu or save the mission. To correct such an error, 
enter a valid value in the locked field. 
 
If the user attempts to set an invalid route, for example lock the speed for all waypoints and at 
the same time lock the ETA for the starting and final waypoints, the SPEED and ETA checkboxes 
become framed in red to indicate a flag error warning and a corresponding message appears 
when the user attempts to close the group properties panel or save the mission: 
 
To correct such an error, set waypoint locks to a valid route combination.

Hints 
• 
To avoid repetitive error messages when closing the group properties panel, use the 
waypoint edit panel to cycle between waypoints rather than selecting waypoints on the 
map: 
 
• 
To correct invalid SPEED or ETA value warnings (red font), enter a valid value. 
• 
To correct invalid flag warnings (red checkboxes), set the SPEED and ETA locks to a valid 
route combination. 
• 
Every route must have at least one waypoint with a locked ETA! This can be the initial 
waypoint to set the group starting time or any subsequent waypoint. 
• 
The Mission Editor does not prevent you from setting any combination of speed and ETA 
locks, however it informs you when an invalid combination is set with either an invalid 
value warning or invalid flag warning. A warning window will pop-up if attempt to save 
the group properties or the mission whenever an invalid route is present.

Place Airplane and Helicopter Group 
 
At the top of the Object (OBJ) Tool Bar are the Place Airplane and Place Helicopter buttons. You 
will use these buttons to place aircraft groups in the mission, set their routes, and the actions 
they will take. When placing an aircraft group, it is important to remember that the groups can 
consist of one to four units (aircraft). Because the placement functions of fixed wing and rotary 
wing (helicopters) are very similar, we will discuss them jointly. 
Note, the mission editor supports group copy/paste functionality. To copy a group, select it and 
press [CTRL+C]. To paste the group with identical properties, position the mouse over the 
desired point on the map and press [CTRL+V]. 
The aircraft Group Properties Mode consist of numerous functions, which are described below. 
We will discuss them from top to bottom. 
 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  191 
 
NAME. In the Name field, you may enter in a unique name for the aircraft group. If you do not 
enter one, a default name will be generated. The Name you create will be used when assigning 
some types of Triggers such as a Group Dead condition. Always be careful not to assign more 
than one group with the same Name.  
CONDITION. The condition for the random spawning of a group in a mission. For this, LUA 
expressions used in the Simulator Scripting Engine Documentation are entered into the field. 
First, the initialization script should be loaded in the trigger panel. The script is executed before 
the mission is loaded and its result is used to set the conditions for the random group spawn. 
COUNTRY. The Country drop down list will display all the countries that have been assigned to 
either the RED or BLUE sides when the mission was initially created by use of the CREATE NEW 
MISSION button. The Country selected will filter the TYPE of aircraft available.  
TASK. The Task drop down menu allows you to select the group task. This setting will be in 
effect for the group for the duration of the mission. Note, the group task serves as a filter of 
available and automatically generated actions in the Advanced Actions Panel as well as the 
default payloads available. 
 
 
 
• 
Nothing. This mission task assumes a non-combat flight along a route. Such an aircraft 
does not take part in any active actions against enemy forces and just follows its route. 
Under the threat of an enemy attack the aircraft will try to evade it. 
• 
AFAC. The Airborne Forward Air Controller (AFAC) mission task will set the assigned 
aircraft to mark targets with smoke rockets or illumination flares. For night missions, this 
can be a useful task to assign an airplane to support a player flying a Close Air Support 
(CAS) mission. 


ED [DCS USER MANUAL] 
 
192 
MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
• 
Anti-ship Strike. A mission task to attack enemy marine vessels using anti-ship 
missiles. 
• 
AWACS. (Airborne Warning and Control System). The AWACS aircraft flies according to 
a planned straight or circular route using looped waypoints, and it alerts allied aircraft, 
SAM sites, and ships when it detects enemy aircraft. Certain SAM systems can receive 
targeting data directly from the AWACS even when their own acquisition radar systems 
have been destroyed. Note that AWACS detection can be limited by range, very low 
target altitudes, and terrain masking. 
• 
CAP (Combat Air Patrol). The CAP mission task implies flying a large race-track pattern 
using looped waypoints around a defined route to defend an area from enemy aircraft 
incursion. This type of task does not involve spotting and destroying enemy ground 
targets or a significant deviation from the planned route to intercept aircraft. Be aware 
that a high-altitude CAP will make life for low level interdiction easier for your aircraft. A 
combination of a high/low CAP sandwich is the most balanced deployment. The crucial 
factor while patrolling will be the fuel load limiting the distance and duration of the CAP. 
Unless manually disabled by the mission designer in the Advanced Actions Panel, all AI 
aircraft will stop patrolling and return to base in a straight route as soon as their fuel 
falls to the guaranteed minimum required for the return flight (Bingo fuel state).  
• 
CAS (Close Air Support). CAS involves actively searching for enemy ground targets on 
the battlefield and destroying them in support of friendly ground units under fire. This 
task is most suitable for dedicated attack aircraft and helicopters. 
• 
Escort. This mission task is allocated to fighters and attack helicopters and involves 
escorting allied aircraft (transport aircraft, bombers, or attack aircraft) and defending 
them along the route from possible attacks of enemy aircraft and air defense systems. In 
doing so, the escorts should not engage in fights with the enemy if they do not pose a 
threat or are significantly off the course line. 
• 
Fighter Sweep. The fighter sweep mission task is a combat task that involves 
penetrating enemy air space to attack enemy fighters or other types of aircraft. The 
main objective of a fighter sweep is winning air superiority and to ensure unimpeded use 
of the air space by friendly aircraft. Since the aircraft taking part in a fighter sweep may 
find themselves at a considerable distance from their airfields and take part in prolonged 
dogfights, their fuel load will be a crucial factor. 
• 
Ground Attack. This mission task is used to attack enemy ground targets using a 
variety of air to surface weapons. This type of mission usually involves unguided bombs 
weighing from 500 to 20000 lbs. and unguided rockets. Unless otherwise set in the 
advanced tasking options, the AI will generally prioritize use of longer-range weapons, 
such as guided air-to-surface missiles, over shorter-range weapons, such as unguided 
rockets and cannon. 
• 
Intercept. This is a defensive mission task whereby the aircraft must carry out an active 
search of incoming enemy aircraft and/or receive targeting data from ground based or 
airborne radar. This type of combat task is reserved for large scale defense and active 
patrolling and you should not use it while defending a small area or a local installation. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  193 
 
While chasing the enemy, the interceptor may deviate far from its planned route and the 
area that is to be defended will be left undefended. 
• 
Pinpoint Strike. The Pinpoint strike mission task involves detecting and attacking 
surface targets using precision-guided weapons. 
• 
Reconnaissance. The aircraft will fly directly over the assigned Reconnaissance Task 
waypoint to best acquire intelligence. 
• 
Refueling. This mission task is reserved for aerial tankers. An aircraft assigned this 
mission will refuel any thirsty allied aircraft during its flight. 
• 
Runway Attack. This is a specialized form of ground attack that will allow the aircraft 
to automatically align the axis of its attack along the length of the targeted runway. This 
is most useful when deploying runway denial weapons. To do so, set the Targeting area 
over the airfield to attack and select Airfields from the Target Categories. 
• 
SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses). Similar to the CAS Task, this mission task 
allows you to use attack aircraft in a more specialized role to attack enemy air defense 
sites with anti-radar missiles or other weapon types. 
• 
Transport. An aircraft assigned to a Transport mission task does not take part in any 
active actions against enemy forces and just follows its route. Under the threat of an 
enemy attack the aircraft will try to evade it. 
UNIT. The Unit selection is composed of two fields and they allow you to select how many 
aircraft units will be part of the flight group (1 to 4). The right field is used to set the total 
number of airplanes in the group; to do so, use the left and right arrow buttons. The left field is 
used to select an airplane within the group; to do so, use the left and right arrow keys. 
TYPE. Depending on the Country and Task selections, a list of appropriate aircraft is listed in 
this pull-down list. 
SKILL. The Skill level allows you to select how competent the aircraft pilot is when flown by the 
artificial intelligence. This setting can control such factors on how much G the pilot can pull, at 
what range it will attack, and how accurate its weapon delivery skills are. There are five Skill 
options for AI aircraft: 
• 
Average – an AI pilot with average training. 
• 
Good – an AI pilot with good training. 
• 
High – an AI pilot with high training. 
• 
Excellent – an AI pilot with excellent training. 
• 
Random – This option will randomly select from one of the four options above.  
 
For non-AI groups, you have two selections: 
• 
Client – If you wish the aircraft to be flown by a human in a multiplayer game, set it as 
Client. Do not set aircraft to Player in a multiplayer game.  
• 
Player – Set the aircraft to Player when you want it to be flown by a human player in a 
single-player mission/campaign.  


ED [DCS USER MANUAL]

MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
Note that a unit's skill level will affect its detection ranges, reaction times and targeting errors. 
PILOT. Enter a unique name for each unit within the aircraft Group. If you do not, a default 
name will be created automatically. This name is important because it will be used to set Trigger 
Conditions. For example, if you create a condition based on the destruction of a unit, the unit 
will be selected from a list using its PILOT name. 
TAIL #. Enter in this field either a three- or two-digit number you wish to have displayed on the 
aircraft.  
COMM. Frequency for radio communications in MHz. The AI group will conduct radio 
communications at the specified frequency. Example: 124 MHz AM means a frequency of 124 
MHz in the AM (amplitude modulation) band. 
CALLSIGN. Type in the callsign of the aircraft you wish it to use. For Russian aircraft, a three-
digit number is used. This callsign will be used in communications with the flight, AWACS, and 
ground controllers. 
HIDDEN ON MAP. check box. After creating a mission, you may wish to hide certain units so 
that people playing your mission cannot see them. For example, you may want to hide mobile 
enemy units from being seen by the player on the briefing and F10 maps. Press this check box 
to hide the selected aircraft group from the ME World Map and F10 view. You can view all 
hidden groups using the Units List window (discussed later in this manual).  
UNCONTROLLED.  When setting an AI group to a “Takeoff from Ramp” (cold start) waypoint, 
the Uncontrolled check box can be used to have the AI group appear at their starting location 
on the ramp, but not begin the spool up sequence until initiated by an AI TASK trigger as set by 
the START Command in the Triggered Actions of the group. In this case, the group aircraft will 
appear in the mission in parked configuration and remain as such until triggered to “come alive”. 
HIDDEN ON PLANNER. This option hides aircraft from the mission map in the mission 
planner. This option can be useful if you need to hide an object from the player. 
LATE ACTIVATION. This option spawns a group of aircraft in the mission after a certain time 
after reaching any condition or event.

Route Mode 
 
When in Route mode, the data in the lower half of the Group Properties Menu is in regards to 
waypoint management. Waypoints are arbitrary points on the map (Lat, Long, and altitude) that 
can be chained together to create a flight route. During the course of a mission, the group will 
fly from one waypoint to the next along the route line and at each waypoint you can assign 
unique characteristics.  
To place a new aircraft group, you will need to be in the Route mode and have an aircraft 
selected. You may then left click on the map to place the groups starting point, which will also 
be waypoint 1. When you place a group, its waypoint marker (circle with its waypoint number 
next to it) and route line will be colored appropriately: 
 White - Selected unit.  
 Red - A Red side unit that is not selected.  
 Blue - A Blue side unit that is not selected.  
At the starting waypoint, there will be a unit icon instead of a standard waypoint circle. Different 
icons denote different types of units:

For each waypoint of the route, the following options can be set in the waypoint control panel 
as described above. 
 
WAYPOINT. The WAYPOINT fields allow you to cycle between waypoints you have created, 
and by left clicking on the World Map you will add a waypoint. The left field displays the 
currently selected waypoint and you can cycle it by pressing the left and right arrow buttons. 
The field on the right displays the total number of waypoints in the route. The circle and 
waypoint number of the selected waypoint will be colored yellow on the map. 
NAME. For each waypoint you can assign a unique name. Type the name of the waypoint in 
this field and this name will then appear next to the waypoint on the map. 
TYPE. Each waypoint can be assigned a type of action that the aircraft will perform when it is at 
that waypoint. These include: 


ED [DCS USER MANUAL] 
 
198 
MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
• 
Turning point. This is the most common and basic waypoint and will result in the 
aircraft performing a lead turn ahead of the actual waypoint location to complete the 
turn on course for the following waypoint. 
 
• 
Fly over point. Much like a Turing Point, a Fly Over Point will sequence the aircraft 
from the preceding waypoint to the next, but only after passing directly over the 
waypoint location. This will result in a course correction required to come on course for 
the following waypoint. 
 
• 
Takeoff from runway. This type is only available when waypoint 1 is selected and it 
allows the aircraft to start on the runway threshold with all systems up and running. 
When set to Takeoff, the waypoint will snap to the nearest airfield or FARP. 
• 
Takeoff from ramp. This type is only available when waypoint 1 is selected and it 
allows the aircraft to start on the parking apron (ramp) with all systems shut down. 
When set to Takeoff, the waypoint will snap to the nearest airfield or FARP. 
• 
Takeoff from parking hot. This type is only available when waypoint 1 is selected and 
it allows the aircraft to start on the parking apron (ramp) with all systems up and 
running. When set to Takeoff, the waypoint will snap to the nearest parking apron 
(ramp). 
• 
LandingReFuAr. This type is available when selecting any waypoint other than 1. When 
set to LandingReFuAr, the waypoint will snap to the nearest airfield or FARP. 
• 
Landing. This type is only available when the last waypoint in the route is selected; the 
waypoint will automatically snap to the nearest airfield or FARP. 
• 
Takeoff from ground. This type is only available when waypoint 1 is selected and it 
allows the aircraft to start from the ground with all systems shut down. In this case, it 
takes some time to prepare for takeoff. 
• 
Takeoff from ground hot. This type is only available when waypoint 1 is selected and 
it allows the aircraft to start from the ground with all systems up and running. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  199 
 
ALTITUDE. The altitude setting will set the altitude in meters that the aircraft will be at when it 
reaches the waypoint. To set this, you can either use the left and right arrow buttons or type it 
into the field. 
• 
Altitude type. Altitude can be set in meters above Mean Sea Level (MSL) - altitude 
measured relative to sea level (constant) or in meters Above Ground Level (AGL) - 
altitude measured directly over the ground below. Because terrain elevations vary 
throughout the theater, setting an AGL altitude will result in the aircraft following the 
terrain contours along the route leg for the waypoint. On the other hand, setting an MSL 
altitude will result in level flight at the set altitude, unless obstructed by terrain (such as 
when attempting to maintain a low-level MSL altitude in mountainous terrain). 
SPEED. Indicates the desired ground speed for the waypoint as set by the user when the speed 
is locked or as automatically calculated by the mission editor when the speed is unlocked. Note, 
at high altitudes the ground speed is significantly different (higher) than indicated airspeed, 
which is displayed in the aircraft cockpit. 
GS (GROUND SPEED LOCK CHECKBOX). Selects between manual and automatic entry of the 
desired speed for the waypoint. Not applicable to a starting waypoint.  
If the speed is locked, the group will attempt to maintain the desired speed on the route leg 
from the preceding waypoint to the current one.  
MACH. The Mach number shows the ratio of the speed of the aircraft relative to the speed of 
sound. Depends on the height, temperature and pressure specified in the editor. It is shown 
only in the aircraft group panel. 
START/ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival). Indicates the desired arrival time for the waypoint (or 
group start time in the case of the initial waypoint). This is set by the user if the ETA is locked or 
calculated automatically by the mission editor if the ETA is unlocked. 
Fix Time (ETA LOCK CHECKBOX). Selects between manual and automatic entry of the desired 
ETA for the waypoint. The ETA is locked for the initial waypoint (group start time) by default. 
When locked, the ETA field can be used to set a delayed group activation in the mission by 
setting an ETA for the initial waypoint at a time past the mission starting time. For example, if 
the mission is set to start at 12:00:00/1 and the user wishes to have the group appear in the 
mission 15 minutes after the mission starts, he can lock the ETA for waypoint-1 at 12:15:00/1. 
Furthermore, if the user wishes for the group to appear in the mission based on a triggered 
event of unknown time, he can set the ETA for the starting time past any likely mission time, 
such as 100 days later (12:00:00/100). In such a scenario, the group will not appear until 
triggered by the scripted event or the starting ETA is reached. 
If the ETA for the waypoint results in calculated speeds that are too slow or too fast for the 
aircraft type, the font will become red to indicate an invalid entry and a corresponding error 
message will appear when the user attempts to close the properties panel or save the mission. 
See above for more information.

Payload Mode 
 
The Payload screen allows you to set the aircraft's external stores (weapons, fuel tanks, and 
pods), internal fuel, quantities of chaff, flares and gun rounds, and the paint scheme. 
 
 
 
At the top of the Payload page is a drawing of the aircraft (head-on) that illustrates the station 
number assigned to each station. Stations can load weapons, fuel tanks, and pods according to 
the aircraft and station.  
Below the illustration is the Loading Chart and this lists each loading payload package as a 
separate line. To the left of each line is the name of the payload package, and each column to 
the right represents a different station and what is loaded on it. To select a payload package, 
click on it and it will be highlighted. If you right click your mouse on a station box in the chart, a 
pop-up window lists the possible types of payloads that can be hung on that station and by then 
moving your mouse to the right you can select the specific payload to load on that station. At 
the bottom of the pop-up window is the Remove option that allows you to clear the station.  
Below the Loading Chart is a group of five buttons that allow you to manage the chart. These 
include:

• 
NEW. In addition to the existing payload packages, you may press the NEW button at 
the bottom of the Loading Chart to create your own. Upon doing so, a pop-up window 
will prompt you to create a name for the new package. After you create a name and 
press the OK button to accept it, a new line on the loading chart with the name you 
entered will be displayed. You may then load each station using the right-mouse click 
function on each station.  
• 
COPY. You may also create new payload packages by making a copy of an existing one 
and then modifying it. To do so, select the package you want to use as a base and then 
press the COPY button. When you do so, you will be prompted to create a new name for 
the package. Once you do so, a new payload package line will be created with the new 
name but using the package assignment of the base-payload you selected.  
• 
DELETE. To remove a payload package from the chart, select the package you want to 
remove and then press the DEL (delete) button.  
• 
RENAME. If you are not satisfied with the name of a payload package, you may select 
the package and then press the Rename button. You will then be prompted to enter a 
new name for the package. Once you press OK, the package will be renamed.  
• 
EXPORT. When you create an aircraft group and set its TASK, a group of payload 
packages will be automatically associated with that task. The Export button allows you to 
associate a payload package with another Task. For example, if you have an all-ATGM 
package in the CAS Task that you also want to use as a Ground Attack Task package, 
you could select the package in CAS and then Export it to Ground Attack. The next time 
you create a Ground Attack Tasked group, the package would then appear as one of the 
payload options. 
 
To the right of the Payload screen is a set of controls that allow you to adjust the internal 
loading of the aircraft and the paint it will wear.

Target Point Mode 
 
The Target Point mode allows you to set target points for the navigation system. 
Target Points can be used by the mission designer to designate coordinate points on the ground 
as targets. These points can be selected by the pilot in flight using the "OT" button on the 
navigation system and are indicated on the PVI-800 and ABRIS displays. 
 
ADD. Add a new Target Point. 
EDIT. In EDIT mode, the Target Point can be moved over the map by clicking and dragging the 
point. 
DEL. Delete the selected Target Point. 
 
The Target Point panel indicates the latitude/longitude coordinates of the selected Target Point. 
The Comment field allows you to add a custom comment for the selected Target Point. 
Note, the navigation system of the Ka-50 can store up to 10 Target Points. 
In flight, Target Points 0 - 9 can be selected on the PVI control panel.

Failures Mode 
 
The FAILURES Panel allows you to set the aircraft's failures. The list of failures depends of 
aircraft type. 
Your aircraft might be damaged in combat as the result of a missile or shell hit. To be ready for 
such a situation and to be able to fly the aircraft when onboard systems have failed, this tool 
allows you to simulate such failures. Select the Failures button and specify in the failures panel 
the device you want to fail. Specify the exact failure time for the device or a Time Between 
Failure (TBF) if you wish to simulate failures without an exact failure time, but will occur within 
that specified time frame. For example: if you specify 30 in the Within field for the left engine, 
this means that your left engine will fail within the next 30 minutes. If you were to specify 0:15 
in the After field, the failure will occur with set probability within the next 30 minutes after 15 
minutes after takeoff.

Additionally, you can adjust the probability of failures by adjusting the Probability (%) field using 
the arrow buttons. The Probability ranges between 0% (no chance) to 100% (certain failure). 
Note that failure(s) only apply to the Player aircraft. 
 
 
Along the left side of the window is the DEVICE list that can be used to set an in-mission failure.  
To the right of each device line is a set of fields that allow you to set a time frame from mission 
start that the failure will occur and the probability that the failure will occur. 
• 
AFTER (hh:mm). Input the hour and minutes from mission start that the failure will 
occur.  
• 
WITHIN (mm). Use the third field to determine the time that the failure may happen.  
• 
The PROBABILITY (%) field allows you to enter the probability as a percentage (0 – 
100) that the failure will occur in the mission. 
The steps needed to set aircraft failures include: 
1. Check the checkbox of the desired failure. 
2. Set the time at or after which the failure is to take place (hh:mm). 
3. Set the time within which the failure is to take place (mm). 
4. Set the probability for the failure to occur (%). 
For example, to set a left engine failure an hour into the flight within a 15-minute time span and 
a 50% probability, check the L-ENGINE Device box, enter 01:00 in the After field, enter 15 in 
the Within field, and enter 50 in the Probability field. 
At the bottom of the window are two additional controls: 
• 
RAND. Pressing the random button will randomly select devices to fail and set random 
time windows and probabilities.  
• 
CLEAR. The clear button will disable all failures and set all time windows and 
probabilities to zero.

Actions List 
The Actions list includes all Perform Tasks, Start Enroute Tasks, Perform Commands, and Set 
Options associated with the currently selected waypoint (to be more precise, associated with 
arrival at the currently selected waypoint by lead AI unit of the group). The actions are executed 
sequentially or as prioritized once the group leader reaches the waypoint. 
As discussed previously, Perform Tasks and Start Enroute Tasks are executed as processes, i.e. 
requite time to complete. Perform Commands are executed instantaneously. Options set rules 
and limitations for the group. 
Only one Task can be performed at a time. Some additional priority rules apply when triggered 
actions are present in addition to standard waypoint actions, which we will discuss below.   
Multiple Start Enroute Tasks can be active at the same time, but only one can be executed at a 
time. All Start Enroute Tasks are stopped if a Task needs to be performed. If an Start Enroute 
Tasks is stopped to perform a Task, the Start Enroute Task is reactivated upon completion of 
the Task. 
Commands and Options are executed instantaneously according to the order in the actions list 
or priority setting. 
All actions listed in the actions list are displayed using a standard format of Action Number, 
Action Type with parameter(s), Action Name, Action Attribute: 
<number>.<type>(<parameter #1>, <parameter #2>, … <parameter #n>)“<name>” -
<attribute #1> -<attribute #2> …-<attribute #n> 
The Action Name is an optional custom name for the action for easier identification in the 
actions list. This field can be left blank (empty). 
The Action Attributes are used to reference one or more of the following possible attributes: 
• 
“-x” – disabled action; 
• 
“-a” – automatically generated action; 
• 
“-!” – invalid action. This attribute indicates an incorrect action, usually resulting from 
the action being incompatible with the group's mission task as set in the Group 
Properties Panel. This may be due to the mission designer changing the group's mission 
task after creating the action; 
• 
“-?/” – action includes a start condition; 
• 
“-/?” – action includes a stop condition; 
• 
“-?/?” – action includes both a start and stop condition; 
• 
“-ref” – action was started at a previous waypoint. 
Additionally, black, grey and red font colors are used to denote: 
grey – automatically generated action; 
white – valid action;

Let's examine a sample scenario of 6 actions to better understand the execution sequencing 
based on the action type, list order, and priority setting: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At mission start, the AI has two concurrent actions: action #1 (Enroute Task 1 <Search Then 
Engage in Zone>) and action #2 (Task 1 <Attack Group>). Unless set otherwise by the mission 
designer, any Task has a higher priority over any Enroute Task, so the AI begins to execute 
action #2, while storing action #1 in memory. Once action #2 is completed (or is no longer 
executable), the AI proceeds to execute action #3 (Command <Set Frequency>), action #4 
(Option <Flare Using>), action #6 (Task <Attack Unit>), while also starting #5 (Enroute Task 2

<Search Then Engage Group>) and storing it in memory. Although both action #1 and action 
#5 (enroute tasks) are now running in the background, they cannot be executed while action 
#6 (a task) is underway. Once action #6 is completed (or is no longer executable), the AI can 
return its attention to actions #1 and #5. The conditions for action #1 become true first, so the 
AI begin to execute this action. However, action #5 has the higher priority setting of <0>, so 
when the conditions for both action #1 and action #5 are in effect, action #1 is stopped and 
action #5 is executed. Once action #5 is completed, the AI can return to executing action #1. 
 
Triggered Tasks 
Tasks activated by a trigger will have a higher execution priority over waypoint Tasks. For 
example, if a triggered Task is activated while a waypoint Task is underway, the waypoint Task 
will be stopped and stacked in memory while the AI switches to the triggered Task. Once the 
triggered Task is completed (or skipped due to not being possible), the previously running 
waypoint Task will be resumed. 
Triggered Enroute Tasks 
Enroute Tasks activated by a trigger will be added to the list of currently active Enroute Tasks. 
As with waypoint Enroute Tasks, triggered Enroute Tasks remain active until stopped by a stop 
condition.

Configuring Advanced Actions 
Once an action is selected in the ACTION drop down menu of the Upper Action Properties Panel, 
the action properties appear in the Lower Action Properties Panel and can be customized by the 
mission designer.  
The specific actions available for selection depend on the type of group being edited and the 
group task (CAS, Intercept, etc.). If the group task is changed after initial group creation, it may 
conflict with the actions already set in the actions list. In such cases, the invalid action(s) will be 
presented in red font and a "-!" attribute will be added to indicate an invalid action. An error 
window will also pop up if the user attempts to close the group Properties Panel or save the 
mission.

Automatic Actions 
An air group's task setting (CAS, Intercept, etc.) does not affect its behavior in-game, but only 
serves to filter the available actions in the Advanced Actions Panel. 
To allow users to build missions without involving themselves with the Advanced Actions Panel, 
an initial action is automatically generated for the air group at the initial waypoint. This action 
appears as a repeater of the group task, however in this case it does determine the groups 
behavior in-game. Any automatic action includes the "-a" attribute in the actions list. This action 
is automatically repeated as a reference with a "-ref" attribute at all other route waypoints. 
 
 
 
If the group task is changed after creation, the automatic actions are automatically changed 
accordingly. The group task actions can also be added manually using the Advanced Actions 
Panel. 
The following group tasks generate automatic actions of the same type: "AWACS", "Refuleing", 
"CAS", "CAP", "Fighter Sweep", "SEAD" and "Anti-ship". In all cases other then "AWACS" and 
"Refueling", the automatic actions are in fact Enroute Tasks to search for then engage targets 
appropriate to the task. Because these actions are automatic, the properties of these actions are 
pre-determined and cannot be edited.

Group Task(s): "Ground Attack". 
 
GROUP. Selects the lead aircraft from the list. The group's flight formation will be constructed 
with respect to this lead aircraft. 
POSITION. Selects the position of the aircraft group highlighted on the map with respect to the 
lead aircraft group.  
• 
Distance – Formation forward and back location of group to group being followed. 
• 
Elevation – Formation altitude difference of group to group being followed. 
• 
Interval – Formation side-to-side location of group to group being followed. 
Below are the options for the battle formation and the location of the group relative to the 
leader in the formation. 
• 
Formation Type – battle formation used by USAF bombers throughout the WWII 
("Combat Box" and "Javelin Down" wedge). 
• 
Position in Wing – position of the aircraft group within the wing (a relatively large 
formation of aircraft) with respect to the lead group, to a max of 500 meters. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  249 
 
• 
Position in Group – position of the group in the middle formation, to a max of 250 
meters. 
• 
Position in Box – position of the group in its battle formation, to a max of 80 meters. 
When you select a position in the formation, the distance/excess/interval are all automatically 
assigned. They can also be adjusted manually only after selecting all items. Keep in mind that 
the AI bomber groups will perceive short distances as critical and will maneuver to avoid a 
collision. 
LAST WPT. Saving (execution) of this type of formation to the specified route point. Used for 
trailing groups following the route of the lead group. 
Below are some examples of historically-accurate formations: 
Example 1: "Combat Box". 
Below is a diagram of the "Combat Box" formation employed by USAF bombers during WW2. 
 
The diagram shows four wings (three aircraft in each) located at different heights relative to the 
lead wing. These wings together close the formation, in our case, a combat box. This formation 
made it possible for the wings to maintain a tight structure and conduct a circular fire defense 
covering the entire aircraft group. 
The first lead wing in the formation is assigned the WPT route from 0 to 7. Under the actions for 
WPT 0 the main task is then set to "WW2: Big Formation" (formation type "Combat Box", with 
Leader in all positions). The second action for WPT 0 is set to the behavior option "VARIANT" 
(type "WW2: Bomber Element", any formation). At WPT 1, we then set the main task to "WW2: 
Carpet Bombing". The remaining wings will then orient themselves according to the tasks 
assigned to the lead wing for WPTs 0 and 1.

assigning extended actions to the lead wing for WPTs 0 and 1, and WPT 0 for the trailing wings. 
Since the construction is a wedge, the closest wing (looking towards the lead wing) must be 
selected in the GROUP field for all the remaining trailing wings. To copy a group, select it and

Start Enroute Task 
As mentioned previously, the Start Enroute Tasks available for a group depend on the group 
type (fixed wing or helicopter group) and the group task. Remember, unlike Tasks, Start 
Enroute Tasks involve target groups the AI will have to independently detect prior to being able 
to conduct an attack. The AI's ability to detect enemy groups depends on a number of factors, 
including the sensors carried by the aircraft, AI skill setting, weather, etc.  
Aircraft sensors: 
• 
Air-to-air radar 
• 
Air-to-surface radar 
• 
Multimode radar 
• 
Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) 
• 
Daytime electro-optical systems 
• 
Night-time electro-optical system 
• 
Visual detection (subject to cockpit visibility restrictions) 
Attacking AI settings: 
• 
Skill setting 
• 
Airspeed 
• 
Cockpit visibility restrictions 
Environmental and target factors: 
• 
Illumination level 
• 
Background terrain (forest, field, road, open water) 
• 
Direct visibility limitations due to atmospheric conditions such as fog, rain and snow 
• 
Cloud interference 
• 
Target unit size 
• 
Target group size 
• 
Target speed 
• 
Firing activity around the target 
When creating scenarios using Start Enroute Tasks, all of the above conditions should be taken 
into account. For example, sending a daytime CAS aircraft to attack a ground group at night or 
obscured in dense fog conditions may result in the failure of the aircraft to detect the target. In 
addition, consider the distance of the target zone from the AI's flight route and make sure it is 
within the AI's detection range. 
The following Start Enroute Tasks may be available, depending on the group type and task: 
• 
No Enroute Task

Enroute Task is created automatically as an automatic action at the initial waypoint. This action 
cannot be deleted or edited. 
 
 
FAC 
The aircraft will act as an Airborne Forward Air Controller (AFAC) to provide targeting orders for 
friendly units in the area. Applicable to: 
Group Type(s): fixed wing and helicopter groups in BLUE coalition only; 
Mission Task(s): AFAC. 
Under a FAC Enroute Task, the FAC will automatically prioritize targets for the player or 
attacking AI groups and issue targeting orders throughout the attack phase.

Note: The FAC's target selection may not correspond to the targets intended for the player or 
attacking AI by the mission designer, because no specific target group is selected. 
 
Target Panel: 
CALLSIGN. FAC's callsign 
NUMBER. FAC's number. 
FREQUENCY. Set the FAC group's radio communications frequency in MHz. 
MODULATION. Set the FAC group's radio communications AM/FM modulation. 
 
FAC – Engage Group 
Analogous to the FAC Enroute Task, except in this case a specific enemy group is selected by 
the mission designer for the AFAC to target. Applicable to: 
Group Type(s): fixed-wing and helicopter groups in BLUE coalition only; 
Mission Task(s): AFAC.

Target Panel: 
GROUP. Drop down menu to select the target group from all applicable enemy groups available 
in the mission. 
VISIBLE. The VISIBLE option allows the unit to know or not know the location of target 
position at the start of the mission. 
WEAPON. Drop down menu to select the weapon types cleared to use for this action. In the 
case of an AFAC, the WEAPON selection refers to weapons the AFAC will request to be 
employed against the target. 
PRIORITY. This number is used to set the action priority in relation to other actions of the 
waypoint. The priority number represents the order this action will take relative to other actions, 
starting with '0' as the highest priority.  
DESIGNATION. Selects the method of target designation (Auto, smoke marker ("Willy Pete", 
WP), IR-Pointer, Laser, WP-Laser. Target designation is carried out on the player’s radio request 
at a fixed radio range.

If the FAC unit is located from the enemy at a distance greater than the operational range of the 
target designator equipment, then the maximum ranges for each of the available equipment will 
be displayed in the menu. 
 
In this case, it is necessary to adjust the distance of the forward observer to the enemy such 
that it is within the specified maximum range. 
DATALINK. Automatic data transmission system for the exchange of target information 
between ground units and aircraft. 
CALLSIGN. Callsign of the FAC. 
NUMBER. Selection field for the FAC’s number. 
FREQUENCY. Set the FAC group's radio communications frequency in MHz. 
MODULATION. Set the FAC group's radio communications AM/FM modulation. 
Remember, because this is an Enroute Task, the AFAC will have to independently detect the 
target group prior to being able to issue targeting commands against it. As described above, 
target detection will depend on a number of dynamic variables in-game, including possible 
terrain obstructions or weather interference. If the mission designer has not assigned any 
groups, the AFAC will not issue any targeting commands.

Set Option 
The following Options can be set as actions upon reaching a waypoint: 
No Option 
No option is set. Default selection. 
ROE (Rules of Engagement) 
Set fire rules to determine the group's combat behavior when encountering enemy units. 
 
• 
Weapon free – engage any enemy group in contact. Target prioritization is performed 
automatically by the group based on the situation.  
• 
Priority designated – engage any enemy groups in contact. However, the enemy 
group designated as the target for the action will be the primary target and engaged 
first. Once the primary target is destroyed, further target prioritization is performed 
automatically by the group based on the situation.  
• 
Only designated – engage only the enemy group designated as the target for the 
action. 
• 
Return fire – return fire only; do not engage first.  
• 
Weapon hold – do not fire under any circumstances. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  277 
 
The default setting for all groups is Only designated. 
Reaction to Threat 
Set defensive rules to determine the group's combat behavior when encountering enemy units. 
 
• 
No reaction – no defensive actions to counter threats. 
• 
Passive defense – utilize passive and active defense measures, but no defensive 
maneuvering against incoming threats.  
• 
Evade fire – utilize passive and active defense measures as well as defensive 
maneuvering against incoming threats. 
• 
Evasive vertical maneuver – the group will be able to increase or decrease altitude to 
avoid a known threat zone. The group will also utilize active and passive defense 
measures. 
• 
Allow Abort Mission – allow group to cease mission if engaged. 
• 
Horizontal AAA fire evade – The group performs evasive maneuvers against enemy 
anti-aircraft fire without changing altitude. 
The Reaction on Threat Options are only in effect in defense. When performing an attacking 
action, the ROE option is in effect. In other words, the ROE option has a higher priority over the 
Reaction on Threat option. 


ED [DCS USER MANUAL] 
 
278 
MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
The default setting for all groups is Allow Abort Mission. 
 
Radar Using 
Set the rules for the use of radar by the group. 
 
• 
Never use – do not use radar to perform target search or engagement (missile 
guidance). 
• 
Use for attack only – do not use radar to perform target search, but use it if necessary 
to engage the target (missile guidance). Target search can be performed by other 
sensors if available. 
• 
Use for search if required – allows the group to use radar for target search if 
necessary (when detection by other means is not successful).  
• 
Use for continuous search – maintain radar on continuously. 
The default setting is Use for search if required. 
Keep in mind that radar illumination is a telltale signature and can ruin the element of surprise 
in combat operations, and as such pilots should ideally minimize radar uptime in covert 
operations.

Place Ship Group 
 
You will use this window to place ship groups in a mission, set their routes, and determine the 
actions they will take. Unlike aircraft groups, you can place up to 99 units within a single group 
(not recommended though). When placing ships, you will be automatically restricted to placing 
them on large bodies of water.  
Note, the mission editor supports group copy/paste functionality. To copy a group, select it and 
press [CTRL+C]. To paste the group with identical properties, position the mouse over the 
desired point on the map and press [CTRL+V]. 
The Place ship windows consist of numerous functions, which are described below. We will 
discuss them from top to bottom. 
 
NAME. In the Name field, type in a unique name for the naval group. If you do not enter one, a 
default one will be generated. This Name you create will be used when assigning some types of 
Triggers such as Activate Unit. Always be careful not to assign more than one group with the 
same Name.  


ED [DCS USER MANUAL] 
 
288 
MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
CONDITION. The condition for the random spawning of a group in a mission. For this, LUA 
expressions used in the Simulator Scripting Engine Documentation are entered into the field. 
First, the initialization script should be loaded in the trigger panel. The script is executed before 
the mission is loaded and its result is used to set the conditions for the random group spawn. 
COUNTRY. The Country drop down list displays all the countries that have been assigned to 
either the RED or the BLUE sides when the mission was initially created by use of the CREATE 
NEW MISSION button. The Country selected will filter the TYPE of ships available. 
UNIT. The Unit selection is composed of two fields and they allow you to select how many ships 
will be part of the naval group (1 to 99). The right field is used to set the total number of ships 
in the group; to do so, use the left and right arrow buttons. The left field is used to select a ship 
within the group; to do so, use the left and right arrow keys. 
TYPE. Depending on the Country, a list of appropriate ships is listed in this pull-down list. 
UNIT NAME. Enter a unique name for each unit within the naval Group. If you do not, a 
default name will be created automatically. This name is important because it will be used to set 
Trigger Conditions based on units. For example, if you create a condition based on the 
destruction of a unit, the unit will be selected from a list using its UNIT NAME.  
SKILL. The Skill level allows you to select how competent the aircraft pilot is when flown by the 
artificial intelligence. This setting can control such factors on how much G the pilot can pull, at 
what range it will attack, and how accurate its weapon delivery skills are. There are five Skill 
options for AI aircraft:  
• 
Average  
• 
Good  
• 
High  
• 
Excellent  
• 
Random. This option will randomly select from one of the four options above. 
Note that a unit's skill level will affect its detection ranges, reaction times and targeting errors. 
HEADING. The course dial can be used to set a unit's standing course when no route has been 
created to determine the direction of travel. 
HIDDEN ON MAP check box. After creating a mission, you may wish to hide certain units so 
that people playing your mission cannot see them. Check this box to hide the selected naval 
group from the ME World Map. You can view all hidden groups using the Units List window 
(discussed later in this document).  
HIDDEN ON PLANNER. This option hides aircraft from the mission map in the mission 
planner. This option can be useful if you need to hide an object from the player. 
VISIBLE bef. ACTIVATION. If you choose to have a unit appear according to an Activate 
Group/Unit trigger, you can choose to have that unit visible in the world or invisible in the world 
until the unit is activated. If you wish to have the unit visible in the world but inactive until 
activation, check this box. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  289 
 
GAME MASTER ONLY. This option indicates that the selected group is available only to the 
game master – the owner of the game session. 
LATE ACTIVATION. This option spawns a group of aircraft in the mission after a certain time 
after reaching any condition or event. 
FREQUENCY. Frequency for radio communications in MHz. The AI group will conduct radio 
communications using the indicated frequency. Example: 127.5 MHz AM means 127.5 MHz in 
the AM (amplitude modulation) range. 
Modal buttons 
Five modal buttons control what is displayed on the lower half of the Naval Group Properties 
placement window. These include: ROUTE, AMMO, TRIGGERED ACTIONS, SUMMARY and 
SUPPLIERS. 
 
Route Mode 
 
When in Route mode, the data in the lower half of the ship placement window is in regards to 
waypoint management. A waypoint is an arbitrary point on the map (Lat, Long) that can be 
chained together to create a route. During the course of a mission, the group will steer from one 
waypoint to the next along the route line, and at each waypoint you can assign unique actions. 
 
To place a new naval group, you will need to be in the Route mode with a ship Type selected. 
You may then left click on the map to place the group's starting point, which will be waypoint 1. 
When you place a group, its waypoint marker (circle with its waypoint number next to it) and 
route line will be colored appropriately:  
• 
White - Selected unit.  
• 
Red - A Red side unit that is not selected.  
• 
Blue - A Blue side unit that is not selected.  
At waypoint one there will be a unit icon instead of a standard waypoint circle. Different icons 
denote different types of units: 
Naval Editor Icons (Russian/Western)

Below the Modal buttons are the Route controls. For each waypoint of the route, the following 
options can be set in the waypoint control panel as described above. From top to bottom: 
 
WAYPOINT. The WAYPOINT fields allow you to cycle between waypoints you have created. 
The left field displays the currently selected waypoint and you can cycle it by pressing the left 
and right arrow buttons. The field on the right displays the total number of waypoints in the 
route. The circle and waypoint number of the selected waypoint is colored yellow on the map. 
NAME. For each waypoint you can assign a unique name. Enter the name of the waypoint in 
this field and this name will then appear next to the waypoint on the map. 
TYPE. Each waypoint can be assigned a type of action that the group will perform when it 
reaches the waypoint. These include:  
• 
Turning Point. This is the most common and basic waypoint and the group will simply 
pass through such a waypoint and proceed to the next.  
ALTITUDE. Not adjustable for naval groups. 
SPEED. The speed setting will set the speed in kilometers per hour (km/h) that the ship group 
will have achieved when it reaches the waypoint. To set this, you can either use the left and 
right arrow buttons or enter it into the field. The group's maximum speed will not exceed the 
maximum speed of the slowest ship in the group. 
GS (GROUND SPEED LOCK CHECKBOX). Selects between manual and automatic entry of the 
desired speed for the waypoint. Not applicable to a starting waypoint. 
If the speed is locked, the group will attempt to maintain the desired speed on the route leg 
from the preceding waypoint to the current one.  See above "Group Route Planning". 
START/ETA. (Estimated Time of Arrival). Indicates the desired arrival time for the waypoint (or 
group start time in the case of the initial waypoint). This is set by the user if the ETA is locked or 
calculated automatically by the Mission Editor if the ETA is unlocked.  
Fix Time (ETA LOCK CHECKBOX). Selects between manual and automatic entry of the desired 
ETA for the waypoint. The ETA is locked for the initial waypoint (group start time) by default. 
When locked, the ETA field can be used to set a delayed group activation in the mission by 
setting an ETA for the initial waypoint at a time past the mission starting time. For example, if 
the mission is set to start at 12:00:00/1 and the user wishes to have the group appear in the 
mission 15 minutes after the mission starts, he can lock the ETA for waypoint-1 at 12:15:00/1. 
Furthermore, if the user wishes for the group to appear in the mission based on a triggered 


ED [DCS USER MANUAL] 
 
292 
MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
event of unknown time, he can set the ETA for the starting time past any likely mission time, 
such as 100 days later (12:00:00/100). In such a scenario, the group will not appear until 
triggered by the scripted event or the starting ETA is reached. 
If the ETA for the waypoint results in calculated speeds that are too slow or too fast for the 
aircraft type, the font will become red to indicate an invalid entry and a corresponding error 
message will appear when the user attempts to close the properties panel or save the mission. 
See above for more information. 
 
Waypoint Mode Buttons 
These three buttons allow you to add, edit and delete route waypoints. 
 
• 
ADD – In ADD mode, each press of the left mouse button over the map adds a new 
waypoint. This mode is selected on by default when a group properties panel is open.

Place Ground Unit 
 
You will use this button to place ground unit groups in the mission, set their routes, and create 
their actions. When placing a ground group, it is important to remember that the groups can 
consist of one to 99 vehicles. When placing groups, only the group lead vehicle will be visible on 
the map when zoomed out. As you zoom in though, the individual units of the group will appear 
on the map. This is important for accurate unit placement. 
Note, the mission editor supports group copy/paste functionality. To copy a group, select it and 
press [CTRL+C]. To paste the group with identical properties, position the mouse over the 
desired point on the map and press [CTRL+V]. 
The ground group placement windows consist of numerous functions which are described 
below. We will discuss them from top to bottom.  
 
NAME. In the Name field, you may enter a unique name for the vehicle group. If you do not 
enter one, a default one will be generated. The Name you create will be used when assigning 
some types of Triggers such as Activate Unit. Always be careful not to assign more than one 
group with the same Name. 


ED [DCS USER MANUAL] 
 
304 
MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
CONDITION. The condition for the random spawning of a group in a mission. For this, LUA 
expressions used in the Simulator Scripting Engine Documentation are entered into the field. 
First, the initialization script should be loaded in the trigger panel. The script is executed before 
the mission is loaded and its result is used to set the conditions for the random group spawn. 
COUNTRY. The Country drop down list displays all the countries that have been assigned to 
either the RED or BLUE sides when the mission was initially created by use of the CREATE NEW 
MISSION button. The Country selected will filter the TYPE of ground units available. 
UNIT. The Unit selection is composed of two fields and they allow you to select how many 
ground units will be part of the group (1 to 99). The right field is used to set the total number of 
vehicles in the group; to do so, use the left and right arrow buttons. The left field is used to 
select a vehicle unit within the group; to do so, use the left and right arrow keys. 
 
Note: For Surface to Air Missile (SAM) batteries like SA-10, SA-11, etc., all the needed 
units of the SAM battery must all be part of the same Vehicle Group. 
 
Note: If you place a ground unit to act as a JTAC, use a unit that is armed and  
has 
sensors. The armed HMMWV is a good choice. 
CATEGORY. Drop-down list for selecting the unit category: 
• 
Air Defence. 
• 
Armor. 
• 
Artillery. 
• 
Fortification. 
• 
Infantry. 
• 
Missiles. 
• 
Train. 
• 
Unarmed 
TYPE. Depending on the Country selection, a list of appropriate ground units will populate this 
pull-down list. 
UNIT NAME. Enter a unique name for each unit within the Group. If you do not, a default 
name will be created automatically. This name is important because it will be used to set some 
Trigger Conditions. For example, if you create a condition based on the destruction of a unit, the 
unit will be selected from a list using its UNIT NAME. 
SKILL. The Skill level allows you to select how competent the unit is controlled by the artificial 
intelligence. This setting can control such factors as what range it will attack from, and how 
accurate its weapon delivery skills are. There are five Skill options for AI ground units:  
• 
Average 
• 
Good 
• 
High 
• 
Excellent 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  305 
 
• 
Random. This option will randomly select from one of the four options above.  
 
Note: A unit's skill level will affect its detection ranges, reaction times and targeting 
errors. 
 
Note: Regardless of skill level, AI aircraft will have great difficulty spotting infantry units 
unless the infantry unit is moving or firing weapons. 
HEADING. The course dial can be used to set a unit's standing course when no route has been 
created to determine the direction of travel. 
HIDDEN ON MAP check box. After creating a mission, you may wish to hide certain units so 
that people playing your mission cannot see them. Check this box to hide the selected ground 
group from the ME World Map. You can view all hidden groups using the Units List window 
(discussed later in this document).  
HIDDEN ON PLANNER. This option hides ground unit from the mission map in the mission 
planner. This option can be useful if you need to hide an object from the player 
VISIBLE before ACTIVATION. If you choose to have a unit appear according to an Activate 
Group/Unit trigger, you can choose to have that unit visible in the world or invisible in the world 
until the unit is activated. If you wish to have the unit visible in the world but inactive until 
activation, check this box. 
LATE ACTIVATION. This option spawns a group of units in the mission after a certain time 
after reaching any condition or event. 
GAME MASTER ONLY. This option indicates that the selected group is available only to the 
game master – the owner of the game session. 
PLAYER CAN DRIVE. This option enables the player to drive the selected units by using 
[RAlt+J]. 
TRANSPORTABLE. This option allows the selected infantry, transport, armored, and cargo 
units for transport by helicopter. 
Modal Buttons 
Four modal buttons control what is displayed on the lower half of the Vehicle Group Properties 
placement window. These include: ROUTE, AMMO, TRIGGERED ACTIONS, and SUMMARY. 
 
Route Mode 
 
When in Route mode, the data in the lower half of the vehicle placement window is in regards 
to waypoint management. Waypoints are arbitrary points on the map (Lat / Long) that can be

chained together to create a route. During the course of a mission, the group will drive from one 
waypoint to the next along the route line and at each waypoint you can assign unique actions 
(like a formation). 
To place a new vehicle group, you will need to be in the Route mode and have a vehicle group 
selected. You may then left click on the map to place the group’s starting point, which will also 
be waypoint 1. When you place a group, its waypoint marker (circle with its waypoint number 
next to it) and route line will be colored appropriately:  
• 
White - Selected unit.  
• 
Red - A Red side unit that is not selected.  
• 
Blue - A Blue side unit that is not selected.

WAYPOINT. The WAYPOINT fields allow you to cycle between waypoints you have created. 
The left field displays the currently selected waypoint and you can cycle it by pressing the left 
and right arrow buttons. The field on the right displays the total number of waypoints in the 
route. The circle and waypoint number of the selected waypoint is colored yellow on the map. 
NAME. For each waypoint you can assign a unique name. Enter the name of the waypoint in 
this field and this name will then appear next to the waypoint on the map.  
TYPE. Each waypoint can be assigned a type of action that the group will perform when it 
reaches the waypoint. These include: 
• 
Offroad. The vehicle group will drive to the next waypoint one in front of the other in a 
line.  
• 
On road. When set to On Road, the waypoint will snap to the nearest road. When the 
next waypoint is also set to On Road, the editor will automatically plot a path along the 
road network between the two points. When placing an On Road waypoint, avoid doing 
so at a road intersection. If placing multiple groups on the same road, try to keep them 
at least 500 meters apart to avoid route conflicts.  
• 
Line Abreast. The group vehicles will assume a line abreast formation. 
• 
Cone. The group vehicles will assume a cone formation. 
• 
Vee. The group vehicles will assume a vee formation. 
• 
Diamond. The group vehicles will assume a diamond formation. 
• 
Echelon Left. The group vehicles will assume an echelon left formation. 
• 
Echelon Right. The group vehicles will assume an echelon right formation. 
• 
Custom. Select a custom formation for the group using the template drop-down menu. 
Group templates can be created using the Templates Menu of the mission editor. 
 
ALTITUDE. Not adjustable for vehicle groups. This field will indicate the altitude of the 
waypoint. 


ED [DCS USER MANUAL]

SPEED. The speed setting sets the speed in kilometers per hour (km/h) that the vehicle will 
drive to reach its next waypoint. To set this, you can either use the left and right arrow buttons 
or type it into the field. 
GS (GROUND SPEED LOCK CHECKBOX). Selects between manual and automatic entry of the 
desired speed for the waypoint. Not applicable to a starting waypoint.  
If the speed is locked, the group will attempt to maintain the desired speed on the route leg 
from the preceding waypoint to the current one.  
START/ETA. (Estimated Time of Arrival). Indicates the desired arrival time for the waypoint (or 
group start time in the case of the initial waypoint). This is set by the user if the ETA is locked or 
calculated automatically by the Mission Editor if the ETA is unlocked. 
Fix Time (ETA LOCK CHECKBOX). Selects between manual and automatic entry of the desired 
ETA for the waypoint. The ETA is locked for the initial waypoint (group start time) by default. 
When locked, the ETA field can be used to set a delayed group activation in the mission by 
setting an ETA for the initial waypoint at a time past the mission starting time. For example, if 
the mission is set to start at 12:00:00/1 and the user wishes to have the group appear in the 
mission 15 minutes after the mission starts, he can lock the ETA for waypoint-1 at 12:15:00/1. 
Furthermore, if the user wishes for the group to appear in the mission based on a triggered 
event of unknown time, he can set the ETA for the starting time past any likely mission time, 
such as 100 days later (12:00:00/100). In such a scenario, the group will not appear until 
triggered by the scripted event or the starting ETA is reached. 
If the ETA for the waypoint results in calculated speeds that are too slow or too fast for the 
aircraft type, the font will become red to indicate an invalid entry and a corresponding error 
message will appear when the user attempts to close the properties panel or save the mission. 
See above for more information. 
 
Waypoint Mode Buttons 
These three buttons allow you to add, edit and delete route waypoints. 
 
• 
ADD – In ADD mode, each press of the left mouse button over the map adds a new 
waypoint. This mode is selected on by default when a Group Properties panel is open.  
• 
EDIT – In EDIT mode, existing waypoints can be selected on the map for editing in the 
waypoint properties panel.  
• 
DEL – Pressing this button deletes the selected waypoint. 
When planning engagements, consider some of the following: vehicle weapon fire is less 
accurate when on the move. Each vehicle has separate armor values depending on facing (front, 
sides, rear and top). As such, you generally want to keep units facing towards the enemy where 
their armor is the thickest. You may also want to have as many barrels pointing at the enemy as 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  311 
 
possible, so formations like Line Abreast or Echelon Left/Right may be most effective. It's also 
helpful to do a careful study of the terrain when planning the mission. Consider the line of sight 
between friendly and enemy units to make sure vehicles can be detected (or not) in accordance 
with your plans. 
Ammo Mode 
 
The LOADOUTS EDITOR panel is opened by pressing on the button labelled AMMO and allows 
the user to select the color scheme of the chosen unit. 
 
 
Triggered Actions Mode 
 
The Triggered Actions button opens the Triggered Actions Panel. This panel can be used to add 
or edit group actions analogous to the Advanced Actions Panel, but activated based on trigger 
rules as scripted in the Triggers Menu using the AI TASK trigger action.

Notes regarding airbase and FARP ground vehicle 
support equipment 
At Forward Arming and Refueling Points (FARP)s, ground equipment resources are tracked to 
determine the level of support that can be provided to the player. This can include ground 
power, radio communications, fuel, and weapons for both AI helicopters and the player. For 
more details on contacting ground crew, see the Radio Communications section in the Flight 
Manual.  
The ground equipment units must be placed within a 150 meters radius from the center of the 
FARP. The units required vary between eastern and western forces:

The vehicles must be within a radius of 150 meters from the center of the FARP to provide 
appropriate service. 
For example, if you want to provide on FARP radio communication with the CP (command post) 
and electrical power, you must supply at least two vehicles – CP SKP-11 ATC and one of the 
APAs for the red side or the M1025 HMMVW and M818 for the blue side. 
If any of the above units are absent or destroyed, the assigned resource will be unavailable. In 
case a FARP is attacked and all units are destroyed, you may wish to set up a trigger to move 
new units within 150 meters of the destroyed base to provide support functions.  
Service vehicles shall be located within a radius of 150 meters from the center of the FARP. The 
size of the FARP shall be approximately 200x200 meters. 
The rearm, refuel, and electric power at the airfields do not depend on vehicles. Again though, 
the radio communications to request these depend on the tower (the tower must not be 
destroyed). If the tower is destroyed, the communications can be restored with either the SKP-
11 for the red side or the HMMVW M1025 for the blue side. To prepare for such an event, you 
can set the mission up so that if the tower is destroyed a mobile command vehicle will be 
dispatched to the airbase. 
Repair of the player's helicopter is carried out in the airfield or FARP within 3 minutes after the 
rotors (supporting propellers) stop. 
 
Below is one of the many possible options for symmetrical service convoys for the red and blue 
coalitions for the FARP. The units in the columns perform all the functions as shown in the table 
above, plus column security is added.

Ammo supply for ground units 
Upon exhausting all their ammunition, ground units, such as air defense systems, missile 
defense systems, self-propelled guns, infantry fighting vehicles and tanks, may all have their 
ammunition stores be replenished using supply vehicles. Supply vehicles are counted as 
unlimited warehouses. They can be included in the composition of both a static group of units 
(SAM positions) and mobile unit groups (self-propelled gun convoy or armored vehicles). A 
group can have several supply vehicles, and if a coalition of a group has different types of these 
machines, then the creator of the mission can diversify the composition of the group for added 
realism. One supply vehicle replenishes the ammunition of all units located within a radius of 
200 meters from it. If the unit is outside this 200 meter radius, its ammunition will not be 
replenished. The creator of the mission in the editor should take this into account when forming 
diverse positions of air defense groups and convoys of armored vehicles, especially if they are 
large in length and do not fit into a radius of 200 meters. Ammunition replenishment time 
depends on the type of unit.

Action Properties Panel for Ground Groups 
The Action Properties Panel for Ground Groups is analogous to the panel for aircraft groups. In 
other words, this panel is used to set Perform Tasks, Start Enroute Tasks, Perform Commands 
and Set Options for the group to perform, as well as the starting and ending conditions of the 
actions. However, the specific types of actions available for vehicle groups differs from aircraft 
groups. 
Perform Task 
No Task 
No action is assigned to the group to perform. 
FAC – Assign Group 
This task creates a Forward Air Controller (FAC) to direct friendly aircraft onto a target group 
designated by the mission designer. To achieve full FAC functionality, the FAC unit should be an 
armed vehicle with direct line of sight to the target and placed within a few kilometers range. 
Targeting actions will begin when friendly units arrive in the area and establish communication 
with the FAC. 
Note: The FAC: Assign Group Task assumes full situational awareness for the FAC. The target's 
location will always be known and the FAC will always attempt prosecute the attack if conditions 
permit. 
The FAC will only provide targeting against the group designated as the target in the mission 
editor and will not target other groups.  


ED [DCS USER MANUAL]

MISSION EDITOR | Eagle Dynamics 
 
 
Target Panel: 
GROUP. Drop down menu to select the target group from all applicable enemy groups available 
in the mission. 
WEAPON. Drop down menu to select the weapon types cleared to use for this action. The FAC- 
Assign Group Task allows you to set the weapon type(s) for the FAC to request from the 
attacking groups.  
DESIGNATION. Selects the method of target designation (Auto, smoke marker ("Willy Pete", 
WP), IR-Pointer, Laser, WP-Laser. Target designation is carried out on the player’s radio request 
at a fixed radio range. 
 
If the FAC unit is located from the enemy at a distance greater than the operational range of the 
target designator equipment, then the maximum ranges for each of the available equipment will 
be displayed in the menu. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  329 
 
 
In this case, it is necessary to adjust the distance of the FAC to the enemy such that it is within 
the specified maximum range. 
If an enemy unit is obscured from the forward air observer's line of sight (for example, due to 
terrain), the message "problem: no LOS" will be displayed in brackets, signifying that target 
designation is currently impossible for the player. 
 
 
 
For target designation the FAC must first maneuver until the target is in their line of sight. 
DATALINK. Only ground units that have EPLRS (as shown in waypoint advanced options) can 
transmit target location data via datalink to suitably equipped aircraft. 
CALLSIGN. Callsign of the FAC. 
NUMBER. Selection field for the FAC’s number. 
FREQUENCY. Set the FAC group's radio communications frequency in MHz.

To perform this action, move the triangular marker that appears near the group when this 
action is selected, to a desired point on the map. 
 
Target Panel: 
ZONE RADIUS. This parameter affects the distribution of fire: artillery systems will shell the 
entire area of the zone, whereas missiles will hit only the center of the zone. 
WEAPON. Drop down menu to select the weapon type(s) cleared to use for this action. This 
menu is dependent on the type of armoured vehicles and its available types of weaponry. 
ROUNDS EXPEND. Setting this flag allows you to set the amount of ammunition consumed.

Hold 
Stop at the waypoint location and maintain position as long as the action is in effect. 
 
 
The Lower Action Properties Panel can be used to select a custom formation for the group to 
take while holding. 
This function may be useful for various combat tasks, such as post patrols or artillery fire. For 
example, an artillery battery can be set to hold in a fire mission formation to conduct fire. 
 
Embark to Transport (work in progress) 
Facilitates ground unit embarkation to transport. Available for the following ground unit group 
categories: "INFANTRY". 
Each infantry squad must have "Perform Task – Embark to transport" set, and the 
TRANSPORTABLE flag activated in the vehicle group panel.

No Enroute Task 
A No Enroute Task action does not set any action for the group to perform. 
FAC 
The group will act as a Forward Air Controller (FAC) to provide targeting orders for friendly units 
in the area. 
Under a FAC Enroute Task, the FAC will automatically prioritize targets for the player or 
attacking AI groups and issue targeting orders throughout the attack phase. 
Note: The FAC's target selection may not correspond to the targets intended for the player or 
attacking AI by the mission designer.

FAC – Engage Group 
Analogous to the FAC Enroute Task, except in this case a specific enemy group is selected by 
the mission designer for the FAC to target. 
Remember, because this is an Enroute Task, the FAC will have to independently detect the 
target group prior to being able to issue targeting commands against it. As described above, 
target detection will depend on a number of dynamic variables in-game, including possible 
terrain obstructions or weather interference. If no group is designated by the mission designer, 
the FAC will not issue any targeting commands.

By default, this is set to the next waypoint in the existing route.  
All main tasks, commands, and behavior options, missed waypoints, will not be fulfilled.  
This action can be used when organizing a circular route. For example, if you send a unit to 
WPT 0 after WPT 2, it will return along the route to WPT 2 and again go to WPT 0 while the 
command is active. You can limit the command with logical conditions by using CONDITION ..., 
for example, to set a time limit for executing the command. 
Invisible 
Set the group to be invisible to all enemy AI units. Enabled and disabled using the ENABLE 
checkbox. 
This command may be useful when creating ground-based FACs in close proximity to enemy 
positions as a means of simulated a well camouflaged position and preventing the FAC from 
being destroyed.

Place Static Object 
 
In addition to placing active air, land, and sea units, you may also place static versions of these 
objects to populate a mission.  Static objects share the same external model as their active-
object counterparts, but they are immobile and do not use sensors or weapons. Unlike active 
units, you can only have one unit per group. 
Note, the mission editor supports group copy/paste functionality. To copy a group, select it and 
press [CTRL+C]. To paste the group with identical properties, position the mouse over the 
desired point on the map and press [CTRL+V]. 
The Static Object window includes the following functions from top to bottom: 
 
 
NAME. In the Name field, enter in a unique name for the static object.  If you do not enter one, 
a default one will be generated.  The Name you create will be used when assigning some types 
of Triggers such as Unit Dead.  To avoid confusion, be careful not to assign more than one 
group with the same Name. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  347 
 
COUNTRY. The Country drop down list will display all the countries that have been assigned to 
either the RED or BLUE sides when the mission was initially created by use of the CREATE NEW 
MISSION button.  
CATEGORY. Static Objects are divided into six general categories: 
• 
Airfield and deck equipment enables the usage of airfield-based maintenance 
equipment for aircraft. 
• 
Animals enables the spawning of a set of certain types of animals. 
• 
Cargos that includes a range of different types of cargo for helicopters. 
• 
Effects that includes a set of smoke effects. 
• 
Ground Vehicles that include vehicles appropriate to the selected country. 
• 
Helicopters that include those belonging to the selected country. 
• 
Heliports that allow the placement of a Forward Arming and Refueling Point (FARP) for 
forward helicopter operations. When setting a FARP, you can choose the FARP callsign 
for radio communications from the CALLSIGN drop-down menu and set the radio 
frequency in MHz in the FREQUENCY field. 
• 
Planes that include fixed-wing aircraft of the selected country. 
• 
Sea Shelf Objects that includes drilling rigs and gas production platforms. 
• 
Ships that belong to the selected country. 
• 
Structures that includes pillboxes and many other types of buildings (military and civil). 
• 
Warehouses that includes a set of warehouses and tanks. 
TYPE.  Depending on the Category selection, a list of appropriate units is listed in this pull-down 
list. 
HEADING.  You may use this control to set the heading of the unit in the simulation world.  
You can do this by either using the left and right arrow keys, typing in the heading value, or 
clicking on the heading dial.  
HIDDEN. If you wish to hide the static object on the World Map and make it invisible to players 
in the briefing map, check this box. 
HIDDEN ON PLANNER. This option hides aircraft from the mission map in the mission 
planner. This option can be useful if you need to hide an object from the player.

Create Area Trigger Zone 
 
Area trigger zones are a powerful tool that allow you set triggered conditions based on a 
specified unit entering or exiting a defined area on the map.  Trigger zones can be placed 
anywhere on the map, can be any size, and can vary in color.  You can also create a trigger 
zone and assign that zone to a mobile unit in the mission. 
Once you open the trigger zone tool, left click on the map where you want the zone to be 
centered (all trigger zones are circular).  Upon doing so, the trigger zone will be displayed on 
the map with a default name. 
 
 
On the right-side trigger zone window, you have the following options: 
NAME. Enter in the name to give the trigger zone in this field.  If no name is entered, a default 
one will be used.  This is the name you will use when setting up a trigger condition. 
RADIUS. The trigger zone may vary in size by adjusting this value.  The value can be changed 
by either clicking on the left and right arrows or by entering the value in the field.  The radius in 
meters is displayed in the field. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  351 
 
COLOR.  To help distinguish trigger zones from each other, you may use the default colors or 
create a custom one.  To select a default color, click on one of the 28 colors.  To create a 
custom color, use the left and right arrows of the R (red), G (green), and B (blue) color values.  
The A (alpha) value adjusts the transparency.  The selected/created color is displayed in the 
RGB values. 
HIDDEN. When the mission is played by others, you will probably not want the trigger areas to 
be visible on the map.  To hide them you must check this box. 
It is also possible to add a trigger zone to the ground structures, such as an airfield hangar or a 
building in a settlement, for example. If you right-click on a building on the ground, select 
assign as ... and set up the trigger zone as desired:

Create Unit Template 
 
Because you can create ground vehicle groups that consist of many different types of vehicles, it 
may be useful for you to save a vehicle group composition for later use.  A good example might 
be an artillery battery that consists of artillery units, ammunition trucks, a command and control 
truck, security APCs, etc.  You can place these all in a single vehicle group and then use the 
Template tool to save it and use it again later. Additionally, templates may be useful in 
conjunction with the STOP AND DEPLOY TO TEMPLATE action of the Trigger Menu. 
To create a new template: 
1. Create a new ground vehicle group with all of the group's required units. 
2. Position the units as desired for the template. The figure shows one of the options for 
the SA-10 (S-300PS) battery position. Keep in mind that moving the lead unit of a group 
will move the entire group. 
3. With the desired group selected, press the Create and Modify Templates button. 
4. Select the appropriate country for the group from the COUNTRY drop-down menu. 
5. Confirm that the ground vehicle group that you wish to make a Template of is listed in 
the SELETED GROUP field. 
6. In the TEMPLATE NAME field, enter a name that you wish to save for the Template. 
7. Press the SAVE TEMPLATE button. 
8. Close the TEMPLATES panel by pressing the Create and Modify Templates button again 
or "X" in the upper right corner of the panel. 
User templates are saved in the file  
C:\Users\UserName\Saved Games\DCS\MissionEditor\templates.lua. 
You have now created and saved a template. 
You have controls at the top of the Template window to manage your templates. 
• 
The top field allows you to select the country for which to save or open Templates. 
• 
The field below the country field is a drop-down menu that lists all the Templates you 
have created for the selected country. 
• 
Using the heading field, you can orient the template using the left and right arrows or by 
clicking on the dial.  The set orientation is indicated in the HEADING field in degrees.

CAMPAIGN BUILDER | Eagle Dynamics 
 
CAMPAIGN BUILDER 
The Campaign Builder creates what we term a Staged Campaign System (SCS).  A SCS is 
somewhere between a dynamic campaign system that automatically generates missions, and a 
linear, scripted campaign that plays the same way through every time.  A SCS may consist of 
one or more (many more if you wish) stages and each stage can consist of one or more (many 
more if you wish) missions.  Each of these missions is created in the ME as a single mission.  As 
such, each mission may consist of numerous triggers and random settings.  Using the Campaign 
Builder, you may create your campaigns by creating stages and populating them with the 
missions (.miz) you create. 
Upon selecting the CAMPAIGN BUILDER from the Main Menu, you will then be shown the 
campaign builder menu. 
 
 
In the top left corner are functions to manage the files and set the stage that the campaign will 
start on.  From here you may Open an existing campaign, Save the current campaign as is, 
create a New campaign, or Save the current campaign As a new file. Below the File and Starting 
Stage Management is a field that displays the briefing created for the mission. In the section 
Description, you can also delete the default text and enter your own.  
At the top right section of the screen is the area where you define how many stages the 
campaign will consist of.  At the bottom of the section are two buttons: Add and Remove.  To 
add a stage to the campaign, press the add button.  To remove a stage, click on the stage and

then press the Remove button.  You may also use the Up and Down buttons to rearrange the 
order of the stages. 
 
The window of the campaign editor has five logical sections: 
FILE AND STARTING STAGE MANAGEMENT. This section contains the following options: 
• 
New. Creates a new campaign. 
• 
Open. Opens an existing campaign. 
• 
Save. Saves all changes to the current campaign. 
• 
Save As. Saves the currently-open campaign under a new filename. 
• 
Name. Specify the campaign name in this field. 
• 
Locale. Drop-down list for choosing the localization language for the campaign. 
CAMPAIGN IMAGES. In this section you may choose the image files to be used for the 
campaign: 
• 
Campaign Image. Clicking on the SELECT IMAGE field opens a standard file selection 
window in which you can select an image (*.jpg; *.jpeg; *.png) for the campaign. The 
image must be 273x130 pixels in size. 
•

CAMPAIGN BRIEFING. In this field you may enter a brief description of the campaign. 
CREATE STAGES. List of campaign stages. This section contains 4 buttons for controlling the 
stages: 
• 
Up. Shifts the selected stage one spot higher in the list. 
• 
Down. Shifts the selected stage one spot lower in the list. 
• 
Add. Adds a new stage. 
• 
Remove. Removes the highlighted stage. 
MISSION SELECTION. Displays a list of missions for the selected stage: 
• 
Name. Mission name. 
• 
Range. In this field you need to set the range of points according to which missions will 
be assigned to the player, depending on the previous results garnered. 
• 
Add. Adds a mission to the stage. 
• 
Remove. Removes a mission from the stage. 
 
Below of the Stages section is the Missions section.  It is from here that you will populate each 
stage with missions.  To do so, first select the Stage you wish to populate and then press the 
Add button in the Missions section.  Upon doing so you will be presented a folder/file selection 
dialog window to select the mission you want.  Once you select it, press the OK button on the 
file browser.  The mission will now be listed as part of the selected stage, and its mission name 
and value range will be displayed.  Each mission can be assigned a value range which will 
determine mission selection within a phase. 
When creating a mission, you may assign values to triggered events such as the destruction of a 
unit, a unit reaching a defined area, a time value, etc.  At the end of a mission, these values are 
totaled and used to determine what the next stage will be and which mission from within that 
stage will be chosen. 
If mission total values are 49 or lower, the player will fall back one stage.  If the value is 50, 
they stay in the same stage.  If the mission total value is 51 or above, the player will advance to 
the next stage.  By populating a stage with multiple missions, each with different values, you 
can create a campaign that flows back and forth according to mission results. 
If two missions are assigned the same value range in a stage, the mission will be randomly 
selected. 
The assigned value range of a mission within a stage is listed in the Range column. 
At the bottom of the section, next to the Add button, is the Remove button.  Use this to remove 
a mission from a stage. 


[DCS USER MANUAL] ED 
 
Eagle Dynamics  365 
 
From the start stage field, you may set the starting stage for the campaign.  You generally will 
not want to start the campaign on stage 1 in case the player loses the first mission and 
subsequently loses the campaign!  The starting stage for the campaign will be marked with an 
asterisk (*) on the stage listing. 
Some notes about campaign building: 
• 
The more stages you put in a mission and the more missions you place in each stage, 
reduces the chances of mission repetition.   
• 
When creating a stage, it can often save time by creating a template for the stage.  This 
“template” mission would include general force layouts so that you could simply add to 
and/or modify the mission many times resulting in unique missions for a particular stage. 
• 
Use random settings and triggers as much as you can.  These can be used to create 
unpredictable force set ups including air defense units and variable AI skill settings. 
• 
By placing front lines adjacent to each other over several stages, you can reproduce a 
front line that moves back and forth according to mission results.

After you have selected a server from the Server List, press the JOIN button at the bottom of 
the screen to join the server.  
The SERVER LIST displays all available servers and takes up the majority of the screen.  The

LAN.  Each row of the Server List represents a different server.  Each column in the Server List 
provides different information about each Server. 
Below is the appearance of the window with explanations of the control elements. 
The MULTIPLAYER window consists of six logical blocks.
