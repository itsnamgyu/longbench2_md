Introduction – Before Use
18
Before Use
 Firmware of Your Camera/Lens
Firmware updates may be provided in order to improve camera capabilities or to add 
functionality.
Make sure that the firmware of the camera/lens you purchased is the latest version.
We recommend using the latest firmware version.
• To check the firmware version of the camera/lens, attach the lens to the camera and 
select [Firmware Version] in the [Setup] ([Others]) menu. You can also update the 
firmware in [Firmware Version]. (Î[Firmware Version]: 593)
• For the latest information on the firmware or to download/update the firmware, 
visit the following support site:
https://panasonic.jp/support/global/cs/dsc/download/index4.html
(English only)
 Handling of the Camera
When using the camera, take care not to drop it, bump it, or apply undue force. 
These may cause malfunction or damage to the camera and lens.
If sand, dust, or liquid gets on the monitor, wipe it off with a dry soft cloth.
– Touch operations may be incorrectly recognized.
Do not place a hand inside the camera mount.
This may cause a failure or damage because the sensor is a precision device.
If you shake the camera while turning the camera off, a sensor may operate or a 
rattling sound may be heard. This is caused by the image stabilizer mechanism 
in the body. It is not a malfunction.


Introduction – Before Use
19
 Splash Resistant
Splash Resistant is a term used to describe an extra level of protection this 
camera offers against exposure to a minimal amount of moisture, water or dust. 
Splash Resistant does not guarantee that damage will not occur if this camera is 
subjected to direct contact with water.
In order to minimize the possibility of damage please be sure the following 
precautions are taken:
– Splash Resistant works in conjunction with the lenses that were specifically 
designed to support this feature.
– Securely close the doors, contact points cover, etc.
– When the lens or cap is removed or a door is open, do not allow sand, dust, and 
moisture to enter inside.
– If liquid gets on the camera, wipe it off with a dry soft cloth.
 Condensation (When the Lens, the Viewfinder or Monitor 
is Fogged Up)
• Condensation occurs when there are temperature or humidity differences. Take care 
as this may lead to soiling, mold, and malfunctions in the lens, viewfinder, and 
monitor.
• If condensation occurs, turn off the camera and leave it for approx. 2 hours. The fog 
will disappear naturally when the temperature of the camera becomes close to the 
ambient temperature.


Introduction – Before Use
20
 Be Sure to Perform Trial Recording in Advance
Perform trial recording in advance of an important event (wedding, etc.) to check that 
recording can be performed normally.
 No Compensation Regarding Recording
Please note that compensation cannot be provided in the event that recording could 
not be performed due to a problem with the camera or a card.
 Be Careful with Regard to Copyrights
Under copyright law, you may not use the images and audio you have recorded for 
other than personal enjoyment without the permission of the copyright holder.
Be careful because there are cases where restrictions apply to recording even for the 
purpose of personal enjoyment.

Note on RAW
RAW format refers to a data format of images that have not been processed on the 
camera.
Playback and editing of RAW images require the camera or the dedicated 
software.
The color depth of RAW images recorded with this camera is 14 bits. This is limited 
to 12 bits during burst recording, however.
• You can process RAW images on the camera. (Î[RAW Processing]: 482)
• Use software (“SILKYPIX Developer Studio” by Ichikawa Soft Laboratory) to 
process and edit RAW files on a PC. (ÎSILKYPIX Developer Studio SE: 674)
• RAW images are always recorded in the [L] size of the [3:2] aspect ratio.
• When you delete an image recorded with [RAW+FINE] or [RAW+STD.] on the 
camera, both the RAW and JPEG images will be deleted simultaneously.
• When the following function is being used, [Picture Quality] is not available:
– High Resolution mode
• You can assign the function that records a RAW image and a JPEG image 
simultaneously once only to an Fn button:

recording, that operation sound may be recorded.
• The lens operation sound (AF and image stabilizer) may be recorded to video.
• If the operation sound of pressing the video rec. button to end recording bothers 
you, try the following:
– Record the video about 3 seconds longer, and then divide the last part of the 
video using [Video Divide] in the [Playback] ([Edit Image]) menu.
– Use the Shutter Remote Control (DMW-RS2: optional) for recording.
• Depending on the type of card, the card access indication may appear for a while 
after video recording. This is not a malfunction.
• Even when playback is performed on a supported device, situations may occur 
where image or sound quality is poor, recording information is not displayed 
correctly, or playback is not possible, for example.
If you experience any of these, play them back on the camera.

White Balance (WB)
≥Adjusting the White Balance: 299
White balance (WB) is a function that corrects the color cast produced by 
the light illuminating the subject.
It corrects the colors so that white objects appear in white to make the 
overall color closer to what is seen by the eye.
Normally, you can use auto ([AWB], [AWBc] or [AWBw]) to obtain the 
optimal white balance.
Set this function when the coloring of the image is different from what you 
expected, or you want to change the coloring to capture the ambience.

• Do not bring any object near the flash. Heat or light may cause the object to 
deform or discolor.
• If you record repeatedly, time may be needed to charge the flash.
While the flash is charging, images will be recorded without the flash firing.
• When an external flash is attached, do not carry the camera by holding only the 
external flash. It may become detached.
• When using a commercially available external flash, do not use one with 
reversed polarity or function for communicating with a camera.
It may cause the camera to malfunction, or it may not operate correctly.
• Refer to the operating instructions for the external flash for details.

First, try out the following procedures.
If the problem is not resolved, it may be improved by selecting 
[Reset] (Î[Reset]: 99) on the [Setup] ([Setting]) menu.
Power, Battery
The camera turns off automatically.
• [Power Save Mode] is enabled. (Î[Power Save Mode]: 53)
The battery becomes flat too quickly.
• When connected to Wi-Fi, the battery drains quickly.
Turn the camera off frequently such as by using [Power Save Mode] (Î[Power Save 
Mode]: 53).
• When [Continuous AF] is set to [MODE2], the battery drains faster. Battery 
consumption can be reduced by setting to [MODE1] or [OFF]. (Î[Continuous AF]: 
358)


Materials – Troubleshooting
714
Recording
Recording stops before finishing. Cannot record. Cannot use 
some functions.
• The temperature of the camera rises more readily in the following circumstances: 
when the ambient temperature is high, during continuous use such as when 
recording high-definition video or outputting via HDMI. When the temperature of the 
camera rises, [
] appears blinking on the screen. If you continue to use the 
camera, a message indicating that the camera cannot be used is displayed on the 
screen and recording and HDMI output will be stopped. Wait for the camera to cool 
down and for the message indicating that the camera can be used again. When the 
message indicating that it can be used again is displayed, turn the camera off then 
on again.
*
When recording with the camera mounted on a tripod, etc., you can set the 
temperature at which recording is stopped to a higher temperature. (Î[Thermal 
Management]: 579)
Cannot record images. The shutter will not operate immediately 
when the shutter button is pressed.
• If [Focus/Shutter Priority] is set to [FOCUS], then recording will not take place until 
focus is achieved. (Î[Focus/Shutter Priority]: 540)
The recorded image is whitish.
• Images may look whitish when the lens or image sensor gets dirty with fingerprints or 
similar.
If the lens is dirty, turn the camera off, then wipe the lens surface with a soft, dry 
cloth.
For information about how to clean the image sensor (ÎDirt on the Image Sensor: 
729)


Materials – Troubleshooting
715
The recorded image is too bright or dark.
• Ensure AE Lock is not set where it is not appropriate. (ÎLocking Focus and 
Exposure (AF/AE Lock): 284)
Multiple images are recorded at once.
• When drive mode is set to [
] (Burst Shot 1) or [
] (Burst Shot 2), pressing 
and holding the shutter button will take burst pictures. (ÎSelecting the Drive Mode: 
202)
• When [Bracketing] is set, then pressing the shutter button records multiple images 
while automatically changing the settings. (ÎBracket Recording: 233)
The subject is not focused properly.
• Confirm the following details:
– Is the subject outside of the focus range?
– Is [Shutter AF] set to [OFF]? (Î[Shutter AF]: 543)
– Is [Focus/Shutter Priority] set to [RELEASE]? (Î[Focus/Shutter Priority]: 540)
– Is AF Lock (ÎLocking Focus and Exposure (AF/AE Lock): 284) set where it is not 
appropriate?
– Is [Focus Limiter] set to [ON]? (Î[Focus Limiter]: 157)
– Is [AF Micro Adjustment] set? (Î[AF Micro Adjustment]: 161)
Cannot focus or zoom with the lens.
• Confirm the following details:
– Is [Focus Ring Lock] set to [ON]? (Î[Focus Ring Lock]: 542)


Materials – Troubleshooting
716
The recorded image is blurred. The image stabilizer is not 
effective.
• The shutter speed will become slower and the image stabilizer function may not 
work properly when recording in dark places.
In these cases, use a tripod and the self-timer when recording.
The recorded image looks rough. Noise appears on the picture.
• Try the following:
– Reduce the ISO sensitivity. (ÎISO Sensitivity: 286)
– Increase [Noise Reduction] of [Photo Style] to the positive direction, or adjust each 
item other than [Noise Reduction] to the negative direction. (ÎAdjusting Image 
Quality: 306)
– Set [Long Exposure NR] to [ON]. (Î[Long Exposure NR]: 247)
• When the camera is used continuously, the temperature inside the camera may rise 
and this may cause lower image quality. We recommend turning off the camera 
whenever you are not actually recording.
The subject appears distorted on the image.
• When a moving subject is recorded while using the following functions, the subject 
may appear distorted in the picture:
– [ELEC.]
– Video recording
This is a characteristic of the CMOS sensor that is the image sensor of the camera, 
and is not a malfunction.


Materials – Troubleshooting
717
Striping or flicker may appear under lighting such as fluorescent 
or LED lighting.
• This is characteristic of CMOS sensors which serve as the camera’s pickup sensors.
This is not a malfunction.
• When using the electronic shutter (Î[Shutter Type]: 243), lowering the shutter 
speed may reduce the effect of the horizontal stripes.
• If flicker or horizontal stripes are noticeable when recording video, this can be 
mitigated by fixing the shutter speed.
Either set [Flicker Decrease (Video)] (Î[Flicker Decrease (Video)]: 394), or fix the 
shutter speed with the [
]/[S&Q] mode (ÎRecording Modes Specifically for 
Video (Creative Video/S&Q): 350).
Stripes appear in high ISO sensitivity.
• Stripes may appear in high ISO sensitivity or depending on the lens you use.
Decrease the ISO sensitivity. (ÎISO Sensitivity: 286)


Materials – Troubleshooting
718
The brightness or coloring of the recorded image is different from 
the actual scene.
• When recording under lighting such as fluorescent or LED lighting, increasing the 
shutter speed may introduce slight changes to brightness or coloring.
These are a result of the characteristics of the light source and do not indicate a 
malfunction.
• When recording subjects in extremely bright locations or recording under lighting 
such as fluorescent, LED, mercury, or sodium lighting, the coloring or screen 
brightness may change or horizontal striping may appear on the screen.
Bright spot not in subject is recorded.
• Pixels may be missing from the image sensor.
Perform [Pixel Refresh]. (Î[Pixel Refresh]: 591)


Materials – Troubleshooting
719
Video
Cannot record videos.
• Try again after either returning the [System Frequency] to the original setting or 
inserting another card.
• When using a large capacity card, you may not be able to record for a while after 
turning on the camera.
In videos, abnormal clicking and buzzing sounds are recorded. 
The recorded audio is very quiet.
• Depending on the recording conditions or the lens used, the sound of aperture and 
focus actions may be recorded in videos.
You can set the focus operation during video recording to [OFF] in [Continuous AF] 
(Î[Continuous AF]: 358).
• Do not block the microphone hole during video recording.
An operation sound is recorded in a video.
• We recommend setting the [
]/[S&Q] mode and recording with touch operation if 
you are bothered about the operation sounds during recording. (ÎOperations 
During Video Recording: 354)


Materials – Troubleshooting
720
Playback
Cannot play back. There are no recorded pictures.
• Folders and images processed on a PC cannot be played on the camera.
