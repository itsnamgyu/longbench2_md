You can use a battery pack or AC power supply 
from an AC adapter.
When an AC adapter is connected, the AC 
adapter has priority even when a battery pack is 
attached.
For safety, use only the Sony battery packs and 
AC adaptors listed below.
Lithium-ion battery packs
BP-U series*
* BP-U35 is supplied with this unit.
AC adapters/chargers
BC-U1A (supplied)
BC-U2A
Do not store battery packs in locations exposed to 
direct sunlight, flame, or high temperature.
Note
â¢ When operating from a power outlet, use the supplied 
AC adapter.
To attach a battery pack, plug the battery pack 
into the attachment (page 10) as far as it will go, 
and then slide it down to lock it into position.
To remove a battery pack, press and hold the 
BATT RELEASE button (page 10), slide the 
battery pack up and then pull it out of the 
attachment.
Notes
â¢ Before use, charge the battery pack with the BC-U1A 
(supplied) or BC-U2A Charger.
â¢ Charging a battery immediately after use while it is 
still warm may not fully recharge the battery.
â¢ The BP-U35 cannot be used at the same time as a 
modem/smartphone. To power when using a modem/
smartphone, use a BP-U60, BP-U60T, or BP-U90 
battery pack.
â¢ The high-capacity BP-U90 Battery Pack is large, and 
protrudes from the camcorder when attached. The 
BP-U90 is convenient when using the camcorder 
attached to a tripod for extended recording periods.
Checking the remaining capacity
When recording or playback is in progress on the 
battery pack, an icon to show the current battery 
charge level and usage time remaining are 
displayed on the LCD/viewfinder screen 
(page 13).
The camcorder indicates the remaining usage 
time in minutes by calculating the available time 
with the battery pack if operation is continued at 
the current rate of power consumption.
If the battery pack charge becomes low
If the remaining battery charge falls below a 
certain level during operation (Low Battery 
state), a low-battery message appears, the 
recording/tally lamp starts flashing, and a beep 
sound will warn you.
If the remaining battery charge falls below the 
level at which operation cannot continue (Battery 
Empty state), a battery-empty message appears.
Replace with a charged battery pack.
Changing the warning levels
The Low Battery level is set to 10% of full battery 
charge and the Battery Empty level is set to 3% by 
factory default. You can change the warning level 
settings using Battery Alarm (page 139) in the 
System menu.

Adapter.
2 Connect the AC Adapter to the DC IN connector of the 
camcorder.
3 Connect the power cord (mains lead) to the wall outlet 
(wall socket).
AC adapters
â¢ Do not connect and use an AC adapter in a 
confined space, such as between a wall and 
furniture.
â¢ If a problem occurs during operation, 
immediately disconnect the power cord from 
the outlet.
â¢ Do not short-circuit the plug of the AC adapter 
with any metallic objects. Doing so will cause a 
malfunction.
â¢ You cannot charge the camcorder by 
connecting it to the AC Adapter.
To turn the camcorder on, set the ON/STANDBY 
switch (page 10) to the ON position ([). To turn 
the camcorder off, set the ON/STANDBY switch 
to the STANDBY position (1).
Notes
â¢ Even when the ON/STANDBY switch is set to the 
STANDBY position, the unit continues to draw 
standby electric power. Remove the battery pack if not 
using your camcorder for an extended period.
â¢ Remove the battery or disconnect the DC IN power 
supply after the power lamp is extinguished when the 
power switch is set to the STANDBY position. If 
power is removed while the switch is in the ON 
position, a malfunction of the camcorder or memory 
cards may occur.

Notes
â¢ If the clock setting is lost because the backup battery 
becomes fully discharged due to power being 
disconnected for an extended period (no battery pack 
and no DC IN power source), the initial settings screen 
will be displayed when you next turn the camcorder 
on.
â¢ While the initial settings screen is displayed, no other 
operation, except turning the power off, is permitted 
until you finish the settings on this screen.
â¢ If you do not use your camcorder for about 3 months, 
the built-in rechargeable battery gets discharged and 
the date and time settings may be cleared from the 
memory. In that case, charge the rechargeable battery 
and then set the date and time again (page 146).
Align the marks on the lens hood to those on 
the camcorder, and turn the lens hood in the 
direction of the arrow 2 until it is locked.

other than peopleâs faces may be detected as a face, in 
some recording environments. In this case, set the face 
detection AF function to Off.
â¢ Registration of the face of the intended individual for 
focusing before shooting is recommended.
â¢ Face registration may not be successful depending on 
hairstyle, facial decoration, or if not directly facing the 
camera. In this case, the face frame may become a 
double frame, but the registered face icon is not 
displayed and the face is not registered.
â¢ If a face has already been registered, clearing the 
existing face and then registering the new face is 
recommended.

stop recording rather than pressing the record 
button of the camcorder.
Notes
â¢ Audio is not recorded in Interval Rec mode.
â¢ Interval Rec cannot be set to On at the same time as 
S&Q Motion, Picture Cache Rec, Clip Continuous 
Rec, 2-slot Simul Rec, 4K & HD (Sub) Rec, or Proxy 
Rec. When Interval Rec is set to On, these other 
recording modes are forcibly set to Off.
Configuring before shooting
Configure Interval Rec (page 119) in the 
Recording menu before shooting.
When Setting is set to On, Interval Rec mode is 
activated and âInt Stbyâ appears on the screen.
When a video light compatible with the Multi 
Interface Shoe is mounted, you can set Interval 
Rec >Pre-Lighting in the Recording menu to On 
so that the light turns on automatically 2 seconds, 
5 seconds, or 10 seconds before recording starts.

Normally, a clip is created as an independent file 
each time you start and stop recording. However, 
this function allows you to start and stop 
recording while continuously recording to the 
same clip, for as long as the function remains 
enabled.
This is convenient when you do not want to 
generate a large number of short clips, and when 
you want to record without worrying about 
exceeding the clip limit. It is still easy to find 
recording start points, because a Rec Start mark is 
recorded at the recording start point each time you 
start recording.

Notes
â¢ Changing the recording format clears the video in 
cache memory stored up to that point, and starts 
caching new video. Consequently, picture cache 
recording of pictures before changing format is not 
possible if you start recording immediately after 
changing format.
â¢ If Picture Cache Rec is started or stopped immediately 
after inserting an SxS memory card, cache data may 
not be recorded on the card.
â¢ Video is stored in cache memory when the Picture 
Cache Rec function is set to On. Video prior to the 
function being set to On is not cached.
â¢ Video is not stored in cache memory while an SxS 
memory card is being accessed, such as during 
playback, Rec Review, or thumbnail screen display. 
Picture cache recording of video during that interval is 
not possible.
â¢ When a Multi Interface Shoe compatible video light is

Notes
â¢ When you create a file, enter each statement as a single 
line by breaking a line with a carriage return only after 
the last character of the line, and do not enter spaces 
except where specified with âsp.â
â¢ A string of up to 44 bytes (or 44 characters) is valid as 
a clip name.  
If the UTF-8 format string exceeds 44 bytes, the first 
44 bytes are used as the clip name.  
If only a string in ASCII format is specified, the ASCII 
format name up to the 44th character is used as the clip 
name.  
When neither the ASCII format name string nor UTF-
8-format name string is valid, a clip name in the 
standard format is used.
Using a clip name defined in planning 
metadata
Load a planning metadata file that contains the 
clip name into the memory of the camcorder, then 
select Clip Naming (page 122) >Auto Naming 
>Plan in the Media menu.
Clip names are generated by adding an 
underscore (_) and a 5-digit serial number (00001 
to 99999).
Example: Typhoon_Strikes_00001, 
Typhoon_Strikes_00002, â¦
Notes
â¢ If the serial number reaches 99999, it returns to 00001 
upon the next recording.
â¢ When you load another planning metadata file, the 5-
digit serial number returns to 00001.
When you record shot mark 1 or shot mark 2, you 
can apply a name to the shot mark, using a string 
defined in planning metadata.
Example of shot mark name strings
Use a text editor to modify the description for the 
planning metadata <Meta name> tag.
The shaded fields in the example are shot mark 
name strings.
Names can be either in ASCII-format (up to 32 
characters) or UTF-8-format (up to 16 
characters).
âspâ indicates a space and 3 indicates a carriage 
return.
Note
â¢ If a name string contains even one non-ASCII 
character, the maximum length of that string is limited 
to 16 characters.

Confirm that the IN/OUT switch 
(page 10) is set to IN, then supply an HD 
or SD reference video signal to the 
GENLOCK IN/VIDEO OUT connector 
and the reference timecode to the TC 
connector.
The built-in timecode generator of your 
camcorder locks to the reference timecode, and 
âExt LKâ is displayed on the screen.
Once about ten seconds have elapsed after the 
timecode locks, the external lock state is 
maintained even if the external reference 
timecode source is disconnected.
Notes
â¢ Check that the supplied reference timecode and the 
reference video signal are in a phase relationship that 
complies with the SMPTE timecode standard.
â¢ When operating with external lock, the timecode 
instantly acquires lock with the external timecode and 
the external timecode value appears in the data display 
area. However, do not start recording immediately. 
Wait for a few seconds until the timecode generator 
stabilizes before recording.
â¢ If the frequency of the reference video signal and the 
frame frequency on the camcorder are not the same, 
lock cannot be acquired and the camcorder will not 
operate properly. If this occurs, the timecode will not 
acquire successful lock with the external timecode.
â¢ If the external timecode source is disconnected, the 
timecode may shift by one frame per hour with respect 
to the reference timecode.
To release external lock
Change the Timecode setting in the TC/UB menu 
or set the camcorder to STANDBY.
External synchronization is also released if the 
system frequency is changed and when you start

focused in the camcorder, and cause fire.
Do not expose the lens to beams, such as laser 
beams
That may damage the image sensor and cause the 
camera to malfunction.
Shipping
â¢ Remove the memory cards before transporting 
the unit.
â¢ If sending the unit by truck, ship, air or other 
transportation service, pack it in the shipping 
carton of the unit.
About the battery pack
To charge the battery pack
â¢ Be sure to charge the battery pack before you 
start using your camcorder.
To use the battery pack effectively
â¢ Battery pack performance decreases when the 
ambient temperature is 10 Â°C (50 Â°F) or below, 
and the length of time you can use the battery 
pack becomes shorter. In that case, do one of the 
following to use the battery pack for a longer 
time.
îPut the battery pack in a pocket to warm it 
up, and install it in your camcorder right 
before you start taking shots.
îUse a high capacity battery pack.
â¢ Be sure to set the ON/STANDBY switch to 
STANDBY when not recording or playing back 
on your camcorder. The battery pack is also 
consumed when your camcorder is in recording 
standby or playback pause.
â¢ Have spare battery packs ready for 2 or 3 times 
the expected recording time, and make trial 
recordings before making the actual recording.
â¢ Do not expose the battery pack to water. The 
battery pack is not water resistant.
About storage of the battery pack
â¢ If the battery pack is not used for a long time, 
fully charge the battery pack and use it up on 
your camcorder once a year to maintain proper 
function. To store the battery pack, remove it 
from your camcorder and put it in a dry, cool 
place.
â¢ To discharge the battery pack on your 
camcorder completely, leave your camcorder in 
recording standby until the power goes off 
(pageÂ 23).
About battery life
â¢ Battery capacity decreases over time and 
through repeated use. If decreased usage time 
between charges becomes significant, it is 
probably time to replace it with a new one.
â¢ Each batteryâs life is governed by storage, 
operating and environmental conditions.
Appendix
Important Notes on Operation
Using your camcorder abroad


145
About charging the battery pack
â¢ Use the Charger (supplied) to charge the 
designated batteries only. If you charge other 
types of batteries, those batteries may leak, heat 
up, burst, or give an electric shock, resulting in 
burns or injury.
â¢ Remove the charged battery from the Charger.
â¢ The charge lamp of the supplied Charger 
flashes in 2 patterns as follows:
Fast-flashing...Turns on and off rapidly at about 
0.15-second intervals.
Slow-flashing...Turns on and off alternately for 
about 1.5 seconds, and turns off completely for 
about 1.5 seconds. The lamp repeats this 
sequence.
â¢ If the charge lamp is fast-flashing, remove the 
battery that is being charged, and then reattach 
the same battery again firmly. If the charge 
lamp continues fast-flashing, the cause could be 
that the battery is damaged, or the battery is not 
a designated type. Check the battery to confirm 
whether it is a designated type or not. If it is a 
designated type, remove the battery first, and 
then attach a brand-new battery or another 
known-to-be-good battery to see if the Charger 
is working correctly. If the Charger is working 
correctly, the cause could be that the battery is 
damaged.
â¢ If the charge lamp is slow-flashing, the Charger 
is in standby mode and charging is suspended. 
When the ambient temperature is out of the 
appropriate temperature range for charging, the 
Charger suspends charging automatically and 
enters standby mode. When the ambient 
temperature returns to an appropriate 
temperature, the Charger restarts charging and 
the charge lamp lights up. We recommend 
charging the battery pack in an ambient 
temperature of from 10Â Â°C to 30Â Â°C (50Â Â°F to 
86Â Â°F).

â¢ Do not press/swipe the LCD screen forcefully, 
or leave objects on the LCD screen, as it may 
cause a malfunction, such as picture 
irregularity, etc.
â¢ The LCD screen may become warm in use. This 
is not a malfunction.
About stuck pixels
The LCD screen/organic EL panel fitted to this 
unit is manufactured with high precision 
technology, giving a functioning pixel ratio of at 
least 99.99%. Thus a very small proportion of 
pixels may be âstuckâ, either always off (black), 
always on (red, green, or blue), or flashing. In 
addition, over a long period of use, because of the 
physical characteristics of the liquid crystal 
display or organic EL panel, such âstuckâ pixels 
may appear spontaneously. These problems are 
not a malfunction, and will not be recorded on 
recording media.
About the display of the organic EL panel
Because of the physical characteristics of the 
organic EL panel, image persistence or low 
brightness may occur.
These problems are not a malfunction, and the 
organic EL panel can be used without problems.
Some primary colors may become visible in the 
viewfinder if you change your line of sight, but 
this is not a malfunction.
These colors are not recorded onto the memory 
cards.
About consumable parts
â¢ The fan and battery are consumable parts that 
will need periodic replacement. 
When operating at room temperature, a normal 
replacement cycle will be about 5 years. 
However, this replacement cycle represents 
only a general guideline and does not imply that 
the life expectancy of these parts is guaranteed. 
For details on parts replacement, contact your 
dealer.
â¢ The life expectancy of the AC adapter and the 
electrolytic capacitor is about 5 years under 
normal operating temperatures and normal 
usage (8 hours per day; 25 days per month). If 
usage exceeds the above normal usage 
frequency, the life expectancy may be reduced 
correspondingly.
â¢ The battery terminal of this unit (the connector 
for battery packs and AC adapters) is a 
consumable part. 
Power may not be supplied to the unit properly 
if the pins of the battery terminal are bent or 
deformed by shock or vibrations, or if they 
become corroded due to prolonged outdoor use. 
Periodic inspections are recommended to keep 
the unit working properly and to prolong its 
usable lifetime. Contact a Sony service or sales 
representative for more information about 
inspections.
Note on the display
â¢ Pictures on the LCD screen and viewfinder 
screen may be distorted by the following 
operations:
îChanging the video format
îStarting playback from the Thumbnail screen
File fragmentation
If pictures cannot be recorded/reproduced 
properly, try formatting the recording medium. 
While repeating picture recording/playback with 
a certain recording medium for an extended 
period, files in the medium may be fragmented, 
disabling proper recording/storage. In such a 
case, make a backup of clips in the medium then 
perform formatting of the medium using Format 
Media (page 122) in the Media menu.

About GPS
The GPS (Global Positioning System) is a system 
that calculates geographical location from highly 
accurate US space satellites. This system allows 
you to pinpoint your exact location on the earth.
The GPS satellites are located in 6 orbits, 20,000 
km above the earth. The GPS system consists of 
24 or more GPS satellites. A GPS receiver 
receives radio signals from the satellites, and 
calculates the current location of the receiver 
based on the orbital information (almanac data) 
and travel time of the signals, etc.
Determining a location is called âtriangulating.â 
A GPS receiver can determine the locationâs 
latitude and longitude by receiving signals from 3 
or more satellites.
â¢ As the positions of GPS satellites vary 
constantly, it may take longer to determine the 
location or the receiver may not be able to 
determine the location at all, depending on the 
location and time you use the camcorder.
â¢ GPS is a system for determining geographic 
location by triangulating radio signals from 
GPS satellites. Avoid using the camcorder in 
places where radio signals are blocked or 
reflected, such as a shadowy place surrounded 
by buildings or trees, etc. Use the camcorder in 
open sky environments.
â¢ You may not be able to record location 
information at locations or in situations where 
radio signals from the GPS satellites do not 
reach the camcorder as follows.
îIn tunnels, indoors or under the shade of 
buildings.
îBetween tall buildings or at narrow streets 
surrounded by buildings.
îIn underground locations, locations 
surrounded by dense trees, under an elevated 
bridge, or in locations where magnetic fields 
are generated, such as near high voltage 
cables.
îNear devices that generate radio signals of 
the same frequency band as the camcorder: 
near 1.5 GHz band mobile telephones, etc.
â¢ If you upload and share the images which are 
recorded with the GPS setting set to On, the 
record location may be exposed on the internet 
even if you do not intend to do so. If you do not 
want to record location information, set GPS to 
Off (pageÂ 139).
On triangulating errors
â¢ If you move to another location right after 
setting GPS to On in the menu, it may take a 
longer time for the camcorder to start 
triangulating, compared to when you stay in the 
same place.
â¢ Error caused by the position of GPS satellites
The camcorder automatically triangulates your 


149
current location when the camcorder receives 
radio signals from 3 or more GPS satellites. The 
triangulating error allowed by the GPS satellites 
is about 10 m (33 feet). Depending on the 
environment of the location, the triangulating 
error can be greater. In this case, your actual 
location may not match the location on the map 
based on the GPS information. Meanwhile, the 
GPS satellites are controlled by the United 
States Department of Defense, and the degree of 
accuracy may be changed intentionally.
â¢ Error during the triangulating process
The camcorder acquires location information 
periodically during triangulating.
On the restriction of use of GPS
Use GPS in accordance with the regulations of the 
situation, the countries/regions of use.
On the geographic coordinate system
The âWGS-84â geographic coordinate system is 
used.

Troubleshooting
Power supply
Symptom
Cause
Solution
The camcorder does not 
power on.
No battery pack is mounted and no 
power is supplied to the DC IN 
connector.
Mount a battery pack (page 22) or connect to AC 
power using an AC adapter (page 23).
The battery pack is completely 
exhausted.
Replace the battery pack with a fully charged one 
(page 22).
The power supply cuts 
while operating.
The battery pack becomes exhausted.
Replace the battery pack with a fully charged one 
(page 22).
The battery pack becomes 
exhausted very quickly.
The ambient temperature is very low.
This is due to the battery characteristics and is 
not a defect.
The battery pack is inadequately 
charged.
Recharge the battery pack (page 22).
If the battery pack is soon exhausted even after 
you charged it fully, it may comes to the end of 
its life. Replace it with a new one.

when you press the record 
button.
The SxS memory card is write-
protected.
Release the write-protection, or replace the card 
with a non-protected SxS memory card.
The SxS memory card is full.
Replace the card with one having sufficient 
space.
The SxS memory card needs 
restoration.
Restore the memory card (page 27).
Audio recording is not 
possible.
The AUDIO LEVEL (CH1/CH2/CH3/
CH4) dials are set to the minimum 
level.
Adjust the audio recording levels with the 
AUDIO LEVEL (CH1/CH2/CH3/CH4) dials 
(page 38).
The recorded sound is 
distorted.
The audio level is too high.
Adjust the audio recording levels with the 
AUDIO LEVEL (CH1/CH2/CH3/CH4) dials 
(page 38).
The recorded sound has a 
high noise level.
The audio level is too low. 
Adjust the audio recording levels with the 
AUDIO LEVEL (CH1/CH2/CH3/CH4) dials 
(page 38).
When an external microphone is selected, also 
adjust the INPUT MIC Reference setting under 
Audio Input in the Audio menu (page 112).
Clips cannot be played 
back.
The clip is being edited.
An error or warning may not be displayed 
depending on the status of the camcorder. This is 
not a malfunction.
The clip is being recorded on another 
device.
Clips cannot be played back if you have modified 
file names or folders, or if the clip is in use on a 
computer. This is not a malfunction.


173
Note
â¢ Obstructions and electromagnetic interference between the camcorder and wireless LAN access point or terminal 
device, or the ambient environment (such as wall materials) could shorten the communication range or prevent 
connections altogether. If you experience these problems, check the connection/communication status after moving the 
camcorder to a new location, or bringing the camcorder and access point/terminal device closer together.
External devices
Symptom
Solution
The computer does not 
recognize the camcorder.
Disconnect the USB cable from the computer, then connect it again securely.
Disconnect the USB cable from your computer, reboot your computer, and follow the 
steps again in the correct order.
Clips cannot be loaded on 
the computer.
Disconnect the USB cable from the computer, restart the camcorder, and then connect it 
again.
Application software must be installed to load clips on your computer (page 92).
Wireless LAN connection
Symptom
Solution

access the camcorder.
â¢ Check the wireless LAN connection (IP address, etc.).
â¢ The communication setting between the access point and client may be invalid. For 
details, refer to the operating instructions of the access point.
You cannot log in to the 
camcorder.
Check the user name and password that you set.
The web remote control 
does not appear.
Check the IP address setting.

If the ND filter will not move, you can move the filter to the CLEAR position manually using the 
following procedure.
1.
Set the ON/STANDBY switch to STANDBY.
2.
Remove the round cap on the bottom side.
3.
Insert a screwdriver in the hole and turn it counterclockwise.
The ND filter moves to the CLEAR position by turning counterclockwise. Continue turning until 
reaching the CLEAR position.
Use a screwdriver with Ã¸2.4 mm diameter or smaller. The insertion depth of the screwdriver is about 
3.2 cm (1 5/16 in.).
4.
Set the ND FILTER mode switch (pageÂ 9) to the PRESET position, and set the ND FILTER switch 
(pageÂ 9) to CLEAR.
Notes
â¢ Do not use the procedure above during normal operation. Only use this procedure if the ND filter will not move. The 
ND filter may become damaged if this procedure is used during normal operation.
â¢ After the procedure above is used, consult a Sony service center to have the camcorder repaired.
â¢ If an error message still appears after performing the procedure above, shooting is still possible.
