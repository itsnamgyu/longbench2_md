Connections
IMPORTANT!
• Whenever connecting external equipment, first set the MAIN
VOLUME knob of the digital piano and the volume controller
of the external equipment to relatively low volume settings. You
can later adjust volume to the level you want after connections
are complete.
Connecting Headphones
Connect commercially available headphones to the digital piano’s
PHONES jacks. This cuts off the built-in speakers, which means
you can practice even late at night without disturbing others. To
protect your hearing, make sure that you do not set the volume
level too high when using headphones.
[Bottom]
NOTE
• Be sure to push the headphones plug into the PHONES jack
as far as it will go. If you don’t, you may hear sound from
only one side of the headphones.
Connecting an audio or musical
instrument amplifier
Connecting to an audio or musical instrument amplifier provides
even clearer, more powerful sound through external speakers.
IMPORTANT!
• The digital piano automatically adjusts sound output to optimize
for headphone output (when headphones are connected) or built-
in speaker output (when headphones are not connected). Note
that this feature also affects the sound output from the LINE
OUT R and L/MONO jacks.

Connecting to Audio Equipment 1
Use commercially available cables to connect the external audio
equipment to the digital piano’s LINE OUT jacks as shown in
Figure 1. R jack output is right channel sound, while L/MONO
jack output is left channel sound. It is up to you to purchase
connecting cables like the ones shown in the illustration for
connection of audio equipment. Normally in this configuration you
must set the audio equipment’s input selector to the setting that
specifies the terminal (such as AUX IN) to which the digital piano

sound. Connecting to the L/MONO jack only outputs a mixture of
both channels. It is up to you to purchase connecting cable like the
one shown in the illustration for connection of the amplifier. Use
the digital piano’s MAIN VOLUME knob to adjust the volume
level.
Accessories and Options
Use only the accessories and options specified for this digital piano.

Using the Pedals
The AP-80R comes equipped with the three pedals shown in the
illustration below.
Pedal functions
G Damper pedal
Pressing this pedal causes notes to reverberate and to sustain
longer.
G Soft pedal
Pressing this pedal dampens notes and slightly reduces their
volume. Only notes played after the pedal is depressed are
affected, and any notes played before the pedal is pressed sound
at their normal volume.
G Sostenuto pedal
Like the damper pedal, this pedal causes notes to reverberate
and to sustain longer. The difference between the two pedals is
the timing when they are pressed. With the sostenuto pedal, you
press the pedal after depressing the notes you want to sustain.
Only the notes whose keyboard keys are depressed when the
sostenuto pedal is pressed are affected.

In this mode, Auto Accompaniment is turned off, so you can play
chords as you would normally do on a piano keyboard.
I CASIO CHORD
Even if you do not know how to play chords normally, this mode
lets you play four different types of chords using simplified
fingerings in the accompaniment area of the keyboard. The
following shows where the accompaniment area is located, and
explains how to finger chords in the CASIO CHORD mode.
CASIO CHORD Mode Keyboard
IMPORTANT!
• In the CASIO CHORD mode, the keys in the accompaniment
area of the keyboard operate as “chord switches” only. You
cannot use the keys in this area to play notes.

Accompaniment Area
Melody Area
NOTE
• See the “Fingered Chord Chart” on page A-6 for information
about fingering chords with other roots in the accompaniment
area.
*1: Inverted fingerings are not supported for these chords. The
lowest note fingered is used as the root. See the NOTE below
for more information about inverted chords.
*2: For these chords, the same chord is specified even if the G fifth
is not fingered.
NOTE
• Except for the chords whose names have *1 after them in the
above examples, you can also use inverted fingerings for
chords. This means, for example, that you could use the
fingering E-G-C or G-C-E instead of C-E-G for C major.
• Except for the chords whose names have *2 after them in the
above examples, you need to press all of the indicated keys
in order to finger a chord. Failure to include even a single
note may produce a chord that is different from the one you
want.

I FULL RANGE CHORD
The FULL RANGE CHORD mode lets you play a total of 38
different types of chords (the same chords available in the
FINGERED mode plus 23 more). FULL RANGE CHORD
recognizes the pressing of three or more keyboard keys anywhere
on the keyboard as a chord fingering. Anything else (pressing one
or two keys, or playing any group of notes that does not form a
chord fingering that is recognized by the keyboard) is treated as
melody notes.

NOTE
• When there are at least six semitones between the lowest note
and the next note to the right, the lowest note is assumed to
be the bass note.
• Note that the digital piano’s built-in tunes (Piano Group tunes
and Song Group Tunes) use rhythms, accompaniments,
and effects that are not available with Auto Accompaniment.
Because of this, you may not be able to perform a piece exactly
like a built-in tune when using Auto Accompaniment.

Using MIDI
What is MIDI?
MIDI is a standard for digital signals and connectors that allows
musical instruments, computers, and other devices, regardless of
manufacturer, to exchange data with each other.
MIDI Connections
Connecting your computer or other external MIDI device to the
digital piano’s MIDI IN/OUT terminals makes it possible for them
to exchange MIDI messages and record and playback keyboard
notes on the connected device.
Configuring MIDI Settings
G Send Channel
Use this setting to specify one of the MIDI channels (1 through 16)
as the Send Channel, which is used for sending MIDI messages to
an external device.
G Local Control
When Local Control is turned on, pressing the keyboard’s keys
plays the notes using the currently selected built-in tone, and also
sends the applicable MIDI messages out the MIDI OUT terminal.
Turning off Local Control causes MIDI messages to be sent out the
MIDI OUT terminal, but nothing is played by the digital piano’s
sound source when keys are pressed. This comes in handy when
you want to turn off the digital piano’s keyboard and use its auto
accompaniment feature to accompany an external sequencer or
other device.
G Accomp MIDI Out
This setting controls whether or not MIDI messages for the digital
piano’s Auto Accompaniment should be sent.

USB Mode and MIDI Mode
Your digital piano has two data communication modes: a USB mode
and a MIDI mode.
The USB mode is used when sending and receiving data via the
digital piano’s the USB port, while the MIDI mode is used for data
send and receive via its MIDI terminals.
USB Mode/MIDI Mode Switching
The digital piano will enter the USB mode automatically whenever
a connection is established between it and the USB driver running
on a connected computer. Any other time (when there is no USB
connection between the digital piano and a computer), the digital
piano is in the MIDI mode.
USB Mode
• If you connect to a computer via the USB port before turning on
power, the screen will show “USB” when you turn on power.
Note that the screen also will show “USB” and the digital piano
will enter the USB mode if you turn on power while there are
connections to both the USB port and the MIDI terminals.
• The “USB” indicator will appear for about one second to indicate
the USB mode whenever you connect to a computer via the USB
port while the digital piano is turned on.
MIDI Mode
• If you connect another device to the digital piano’s MIDI
terminals (only) before turning on power, the screen will show
“MIDI” when you turn on power.
• Disconnecting from the digital piano’s USB port while the digital
piano is turned on will cause the “MIDI” indicator to appear for
about one second to indicate the MIDI mode.

Using a Memory Card
The digital piano has a card slot that accepts SmartMediaTM memory
cards. This provides you with the means to store virtually unlimited
amounts of user song and other data from digital piano memory.
SmartMedia memory cards are available in capacities ranging from
8MB up to 128MB. The cost of a card varies according to its capacity.
Note also that SmartMedia memory cards are available for two
different voltages: 3.3V and 5V. This digital piano supports the use
of 3.3V cards.
Though a SmartMedia memory card is about the size of a postage
stamp, it has anywhere from eight times to 100 times the storage
capacity of a floppy diskette, and it provides very high-speed
access. SmartMedia memory cards are available from household
appliance stores, computer shops, etc.
* SmartMediaTM is a trademark of Toshiba Corporation.
NOTE
• The term “memory card” in this manual refers to the
SmartMedia memory card.
Memory Cards
IMPORTANT!
• Be sure to use only a 3.3V SmartMedia memory card that has
one of the following capacities.
8MB, 16MB, 32MB, 64MB, 128MB
WARNING
• Use of 5V SmartMedia memory cards is not supported.
• Note that you will not be able store data to, delete data from, or
rename files on a memory card that has a write protect sticker in
the write protect area.
Memory Card and Card Slot Handling
Precautions
IMPORTANT!
• When using a memory card, make sure you observe all of the
precautions in the instructions that come with it.
• Avoid using a memory card in the following types of areas. Such
conditions can corrupt data stored on the memory card.
• Areas subjected to high temperature, high humidity, and
corrosive gas
• Areas subjected to strong electrostatic charge and digital noise
• Never touch the contacts of a memory card when loading it or
removing it from the digital piano.
• Never remove the memory card from the card slot or turn off
the digital piano while any data access operation (save, read,
delete) is in progress. Doing so can corrupt the data on the
memory card and damage the card slot.
• Never insert anything besides a memory card into the card slot.
Doing so creates the risk of malfunction.
• Inserting a memory card that carries an electrostatic charge into
the card slot can cause malfunction of the digital piano. If this
happens, turn digital piano power off and then back on again.
• A memory card can become quite warm after very long use in
the card slot. This is normal and does not indicate malfunction.
• A memory card has a limited service life. If you start to experience
problems with storing, reading, or deleting data from a memory
card you have been using for a long time, it may mean that the
card has reached the end of its service life. When this happens,
you need to purchase a new card.

Assembly Instructions
 CAUTION
• Take particular care to avoid injury when installing legs and
pedals, and when mounting the keyboard onto the stand.
• When assembling, make sure that the sliding keyboard cover of
the digital piano body is completely closed. If the cover is left
open during assembly, it may close suddenly causing the fingers
to be pinched between the digital piano body and cover.
IMPORTANT!
• Be sure to assemble the stand on a flat surface.
• This stand does not include any of the tools required to assemble
it. You should have a large Phillips head (+) screwdriver on hand
for assembly.
• Check the items that come with the unit to make sure that
everything shown in Figure 1 (A through I) is included.
All screws are in a plastic bag inside of the packing cardboard.
• Before starting actual assembly of the stand, undo the clip at
location 1 (Figure 2) where the pedal cable comes out the back
of crosspiece D.
1  Assembling the stand
Refer to Figures 3, 4 and 5 as you assemble the stand according to
the following procedure.
1
Attach side uprights A and B to crosspiece D using
the four E screws (Figure 3).
• When joining the two pieces marked 2, the metal pieces
3 on the insides of side uprights A and B should fit into
the slots at the ends of crosspiece D. Make sure the metal
pieces are pushed into the slots as far as they will go. If
they are not, the metal pieces 3 and the screws E will not
match up correctly, which can cause stripping of the
screws.

Operational Precautions
Locating the Unit
Avoid the following locations.
• Areas exposed to direct sunlight and high humidity
• Areas subjected to very low temperatures
• Near a radio, TV, video deck, or tuner (unit can cause interference
with audio or video signals)
Care of the Unit
• Never use benzene, alcohol, thinner or other such chemicals to
clean the exterior of the unit.
• To clean the keyboard, use a soft cloth dampened with a weak
solution of a mild neutral detergent and water. Wring out all
excess moisture from the cloth before wiping.
Memory Protection
A built-in lithium battery supplies the power required to retain
digital piano settings and memory contents when power is turned
off. Should the lithium battery go dead, settings and memory
contents (Song Memory data, registration memory data, user songs,
display contrast setting, etc.) will be lost whenever you turn off
digital piano power. Note that the original built-in lithium battery
has a life of about five years from the date the digital piano was
manufactured. Be sure to periodically contact your retailer or
authorized service provider to have the lithium battery replaced.
Note that you will be charged separately for lithium battery
replacement.
• Note that CASIO COMPUTER CO., LTD. shall not be held liable
for any damages or losses or any claims by third parties arising
from corruption or loss of data caused by malfunction or repair
of the unit, or from battery replacement.
You may notice lines in the finish of the case of this product.
These lines are the result of the molding process used to
shape the plastic of the case. They are not cracks or breaks
in the plastic, and are no cause for concern.
NOTE
• Unauthorized reproduction of this manual in its entirety or
in part is expressly forbidden. All rights reserved.
• CASIO COMPUTER CO., LTD. shall not be held liable for
any damages or losses or any claims by third parties arising
from use of this product or this manual.
• The contents of this manual are subject to change without
notice.
Precauciones durante la operación
Ubicación de la unidad
Evite las siguientes ubicaciones.
• Las áreas expuestas directamente a la luz del sol y alta humedad.
• Areas sujetas a temperaturas muy bajas.
• Cerca de una radio, TV, platina de video o sintonizador (la unidad
puede ocasionar interferencias con las señales de audio o video).
Cuidado de la unidad
• No utilice benceno, alcohol, diluyentes u otros agentes químicos
para limpiar el exterior de la unidad.
• Para limpiar el teclado, utilice un paño suave humedecido con
una solución débil de un detergente neutro suave y agua.
Exprima todo exceso de humedad del paño antes de limpiar.
Protección de memoria
Una pila de litio incorporada proporciona la energía necesaria para
retener los ajustes del piano digital y contenidos de la memoria,
cuando la alimentación está desactivada. En caso de que la pila se
agote, los ajustes y contenidos de la memoria (datos de la memoria
de canción, datos de la memoria de registro, canciones del usuario,
ajuste de contraste del display, etc.) se perderán siempre que
desactiva la alimentación del piano digital. Tenga en cuenta que la
pila de litio incorporada original tiene una duración de cinco años
desde la fecha en que se ha fabricado el piano. Asegúrese de
comunicarse periódicamente con su vendedor o agente de servicio
autorizado para que reemplacen la pila. Tenga en cuenta que el
reemplazo de la pila de litio deberá ser abonado separadamente.
• Tenga en cuenta que CASIO COMPUTER CO., LTD. no asume
ninguna responsabilidad ante ningún daño o pérdida, ni
tampoco de reclamos hechos por terceras partes que resulten de
la alteración o pérdidas de datos de la unidad, debido a una
falla de funcionamiento, reparación de la unidad o a un cambio
de pila.
Se pueden observar líneas en el acabado de la caja de este
producto. Estas líneas son un resultado de un proceso de
moldeo usado para dar forma al plástico de la caja. No son
grietas ni fisuras en el plástico, por lo tanto no deben ser
motivos de preocupación.
NOTA
• Se prohíbe la reproducción de este manual ya sea en forma
parcial o completa, sin la autorización expresa
correspondiente. Todos los derechos se encuentran
reservados.
• CASIO COMPUTER CO., LTD. no asume ninguna
responsabilidad ante ningún daño o pérdida, ni tampoco de
reclamos hechos por terceras partes que resulten del uso de
este producto o de este manual.
• Los contenidos de este manual están sujetos a cambios sin
previo aviso.
