Overview


NOTE: Throughout this Owner's Manual, the front touchscreen is referred to as the "touchscreen" whereas the rear 
touchscreen is referred to as the "rear touchscreen".
WARNING: Always pay attention to road and traffic conditions when driving. To minimize driver distraction and ensure 
the safety of vehicle occupants as well as other road users, avoid using the touchscreen to adjust settings while the 
vehicle is in motion.
Use the touchscreen to control many features that, in traditional cars, are controlled using physical buttons (for example, 
adjusting the cabin heating and air conditioning, headlights, etc.). You also use the touchscreen to control media, navigate, 
use entertainment features, and customize Model 3 to suit your preferences. For hands-free access to common touchscreen 
controls, use voice commands (see Voice Commands on page 18).
If the touchscreen is unresponsive or demonstrates unusual behavior, you can restart it (see Restarting the Touchscreen on 
page 9).
CAUTION: Do not apply a screen protector on the touchscreen. Doing so can result in unintended inputs to the 
touchscreen (phantom inputs), delayed response or unresponsiveness to touches, electrostatic discharge which can 
damage the touchscreen, etc. Any damage caused by installing a screen protector is not covered by the warranty.
NOTE: Illustrations are provided to improve conceptual understanding only. Depending on vehicle options, software version, 
market region and regional and language settings, the details displayed on the screen will differ.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


In addition to storage compartments and cup holders (see 
Interior Storage on page 33), the Model 3 interior supports 
various electronics such as USB ports, wireless phone 
chargers, and a 12V power socket.
USB Ports
Model 3 has four USB ports. The three USB-C ports output 
up to approximately 42W or two ports up to approximately 
65W.
• One USB-C port is located in the rear compartment of the 
center console used to charge USB devices.
• Two USB-C ports, which can be used to charge USB 
devices, are located below the rear cabin vents on the 
center console.
• One USB-A port is located inside the glovebox. This port 
is equipped with a USB flash drive. The secure location of 
this USB port makes it ideal for saving Sentry Mode and 
Dashcam video footage. It also supports audio files from a 
phone or USB device (see Playing Media from Devices on 
page 162).
See USB Drive Requirements for Recording Videos on page 
143 for information about formatting USB flash drives.
NOTE: Power is available whenever the vehicle is considered 
"awake". The vehicle may be awake for many reasons. For 
example, when using features such as Summon, or when 
features such as Keep Climate On, Dog Mode, Camp Mode, 
or Sentry Mode are enabled. The vehicle is also awake 
whenever the low voltage battery is being charged or is in 
use, during high voltage charging, when the vehicle is 
communicating with the mobile app, etc. Leaving an 
accessory plugged in does not deplete the low voltage 
battery.
NOTE: Use USB 3.0 compliant cables to connect a device to a 
USB port. Using non-compliant cables can result in slower 
charging, potential connection problems or degraded 
performance.
NOTE: Do not connect multiple devices using a USB hub. This 
can prevent connected devices from charging or from being 
recognized by Media Player, Sentry Mode, Dashcam, etc.
Wireless Phone Chargers
Wireless phone chargers are integrated into the front 
console, providing up to 15W of power to charge Qi-enabled 
phones. To charge your phone, place it on one of the two 
charge pads. The phone must be in direct contact with the 
wireless charger. Your device may feel warm while charging, 
but this is a normal effect of inductive charging.
CAUTION: Before you charge, remove any objects 
(coins, keys, metal objects, etc.) between the phone 
and charger, as well as any NFC cards (for example, the 
vehicle key card, credit cards, or hotel key) placed on 
or behind the phone (like with integrated phone cases). 
Damage to NFC cards can occur when you charge the 
phone without first removing the card.
Interior Electronics
11
Overview


When placed on the wireless charger, your phone charges 
whenever the vehicle is powered on (the touchscreen is on 
and you are in the vehicle). Your phone does not charge when 
you leave the vehicle unless a feature, such as Keep Climate 
On, Dog Mode, Camp Mode, or Sentry Mode is enabled.
NOTE: The wireless phone charger may not work if your 
phone case is too thick or is made of metal. Try removing the 
phone from its case before placing it on the charger.
NOTE: The wireless phone charger does not charge if the 
vehicle's high voltage Battery is discharged.
Low Voltage Power Socket
Your Model 3 has a power socket located in the center 
console's compartment. To access the low voltage socket, 
open the front compartment of the center console.
The power socket is suitable for accessories requiring up to 
12A continuous draw (16A peak).
NOTE: Power is available whenever the vehicle is considered 
"awake." The vehicle may be awake for many reasons. For 
example, when using features such as Summon, or when 
features such as Cabin Overheat Protection, Keep Climate 
On, Dog Mode, Camp Mode, Sentry Mode, etc. are enabled. 
The vehicle is also awake whenever the low voltage battery is 
being charged or is in use, during high voltage charging, 
when the vehicle is communicating with the mobile app, etc. 
Leaving an accessory plugged in does not deplete the low 
voltage battery.
WARNING: The power socket and an accessory’s 
connector can become hot.
WARNING: To prevent excessive interference with the 
vehicle’s electronics, Tesla recommends that you do 
not plug any non-Tesla accessories, including power 
inverters, into the low voltage power socket. However, 
if you do use a non-Tesla accessory and notice any 
malfunctions or unexpected behavior, such as indicator 
lights, alert messages, or excessive heat from the 
accessory, unplug the accessory from the low voltage 
power socket immediately.
CAUTION: Do not attempt to jump start Model 3 using 
the low voltage power socket. Doing so can result in 
damage.

Overview


Your Model 3 includes the following components that 
actively monitor the surrounding area:
• A camera is mounted above the rear license plate.
• A camera is mounted in each door pillar.
• Two cameras are mounted to the windshield above the 
rear view mirror.
• A camera is mounted to each front fender.
Model 3 is also equipped with high precision electronically-
assisted braking and steering systems.
Cabin Camera
Your Model 3 is equipped with a cabin camera located above 
the rear view mirror. For more information, see Cabin Camera 
on page 136.
Drive to Calibrate Cameras
Model 3 must maneuver with precision when Autopilot 
features are being used. Therefore, before some features 
such as Lane Departure Avoidance and Automatic 
Emergency Braking can be used for the first time or after 
some types of service repairs, cameras must complete a self-
calibration process. For your convenience, the touchscreen 
displays a progress indicator.
When calibration is complete, Autopilot features, as well as 
Active Safety features, are available for use. Calibration 
typically completes after driving 20-25 miles (32-40 km), 
but the distance varies depending on road and environmental 
conditions. For example, calibration completes quicker when 
driving on a straight road with multiple lanes (such as a 
controlled-access highway), with highly-visible lane 
markings (in the driving lane as well as the adjacent lanes). 
Contact Tesla only if your Model 3 has not completed the 
calibration process after driving 100 miles (160 km) in the 
described conditions.
If a camera has shifted from its calibrated position (for 
example, the camera or windshield was replaced), you must 
clear the calibration. To do so, touch Controls > Service > 
Camera Calibration > Clear Calibration. When the calibration 
is cleared, Model 3 repeats the calibration process. While 
this helps re-calibrate the cameras in many cases, Clear 
Calibration may not resolve all camera and sensor concerns.
NOTE: To calibrate, cameras require highly-visible lane 
markings in both the driving lane and adjacent lanes (at least 
two lanes over on each side of the vehicle). For best results, 
drive in the middle lane of a multi-lane highway (ideally with 
at least five lanes) that has clear lane markings and minimal 
traffic.
NOTE: If you attempt to use a feature that is not available 
until the calibration process is complete, the feature is 
disabled and the touchscreen displays a message.
NOTE: Model 3 must repeat the calibration process if the 
cameras are serviced by Tesla, and in some cases, after a 
software update.
Keeping Cameras Free of Obstructions
Ensure all cameras are clean and free of obstructions before 
each drive and before using Autopilot features (see Cleaning 
a Camera on page 190). Dirty cameras and sensors (if 
equipped), as well as environmental conditions such as rain 
and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. If 
a camera is obstructed or blinded, Model 3 displays a 
message on the touchscreen and Autopilot features may not 
be available. For more information on specific alerts, see 
Troubleshooting Alerts on page 224.
Condensation can form inside the camera enclosures, 
especially if you park your vehicle outside in cold or wet 
conditions. The touchscreen may display an alert stating that 
a camera is blocked and that some or all Autopilot features 
may be temporarily restricted until the camera vision is clear. 
To proactively dry the condensation, precondition the cabin 
by setting it to a warm temperature, turning the windshield 
defroster on, and directing the front air vents toward the door 
pillars (see Mobile App on page 51).

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Types of Keys
Model 3 supports the following types of keys:
• Phone key - You can set up your personal phone as a 
"phone key" that communicates with Model 3 using 
Bluetooth. A phone key supports automatic locking and 
unlocking.
• Key card - Tesla provides two key cards that communicate 
with Model 3 using short range radio-frequency 
identification (RFID) signals. Unlike the phone key and key 
fobs, the key card does not support automatic locking and 
unlocking. In situations where your phone key has a dead 
battery, or is lost or stolen, use your key card to unlock, 
drive, and lock Model 3.
• Key fob - The key fob (if equipped) allows you to press 
buttons to open the front and rear trunks, and unlock, 
lock, and drive Model 3. The key fob also supports 
automatic locking and unlocking, if available in your 
region (see Walk-Away Door Lock on page 25) and can 
be used as a backup to your phone key.
Model 3 supports a total of 19 keys, which can include phone 
keys, key cards, and up to four key fobs.
CAUTION: Remember to bring a key with you when you 
drive. Although you can drive Model 3 away from its 
key, you will be unable to power it back on after it 
powers off.
Phone Key
CAUTION: Do not leave your paired phone in your 
vehicle (for example, if you are hiking or at the beach). 
If you must leave your phone in the vehicle, disable 
Bluetooth and/or turn the phone off.
Using your phone as a key is a convenient way to access your 
Model 3. As you approach, your phone's Bluetooth signal is 
detected and the doors unlock when you pull a door handle. 
Likewise, when you exit and walk away with the phone key, 
doors automatically lock (provided the Walk-Away Door Lock 
feature is turned on; see Walk-Away Door Lock on page 
25).
Before you can use a phone to access Model 3, follow these 
steps to authenticate it (see Pairing a New Phone Key on 
page 23).
Once a phone has been authenticated, it no longer requires 
an internet connection to be used as a phone key for Model 
3. However, to use the phone hands-free, access your 
phone's contacts, play media from it, etc., you must also pair 
it and connect it as a Bluetooth device (see Bluetooth on 
page 54).
To view a list of keys that can currently access Model 3, or to 
remove a phone key, touch Controls > Locks (see Managing 
Keys on page 23).
Model 3 can connect to three phone keys simultaneously. 
Therefore, if more than three phone keys are detected and 
you want to authenticate or pair a different phone, move the 
other connected phone key(s) out of range or turn off its 
Bluetooth setting.
Some smartphones with NFC capability can be used to lock/
unlock your vehicle, just like using a key card. Ensure the 
Tesla mobile app is correctly paired to your vehicle and 
enable the NFC function on your phone. Once enabled, 
simply hold the phone to the driver's side door pillar to lock 
or unlock the door. Refer to your smartphone's instructions 
for specific information on how to do this.
Key Card
Tesla provides you with two Model 3 key cards, designed to 
fit in your wallet.
To use a key card to unlock or lock Model 3, position the card 
as shown and tap it against the card reader located 
approximately one third the way up of the driver's side door 
pillar. When Model 3 detects the key card, the exterior lights 
flash, the mirrors unfold or fold (if Fold Mirrors is on), the 
horn sounds (if Lock Confirmation Sound is on), and the 
doors unlock or lock.
NOTE: You may need to physically touch the wireless phone 
charger or driver's side door pillar with the key card, and you 
may need to hold it against the transmitter for one or two 
seconds.
Once inside, power up Model 3 by pressing the brake pedal 
within two minutes of scanning the key card (see Starting and 
Powering Off on page 61). If you wait longer than two 
minutes, you must re-authenticate by placing the key card 
near the card reader located in the wireless phone charger on 
the center console. When your key card is detected, your two 
minute authentication period restarts.
Keys

Opening and Closing


NOTE: If enabled, Walk-Away Door Lock (see Walk-Away 
Door Lock on page 25) operates only when you walk away 
using a phone key or key fob. When you walk away carrying 
your key card, Model 3 does not automatically unlock/lock.
Key Fob
If you have purchased the key fob accessory, you can quickly 
familiarize yourself with this key by thinking of it as a 
miniature version of Model 3, with the Tesla badge 
representing the front. The key has three buttons that feel 
like softer areas on the surface.
1. Front trunk - Double-click to unlatch the front trunk.
2. Lock/Unlock All - Single-click to lock doors and trunks 
(all doors and trunks must be closed). Double-click to 
unlock doors and trunks.
3. Rear trunk - Double-click to unlatch the rear trunk. Hold 
down for one to two seconds to open the charge port 
door.
Once inside, power up Model 3 by pressing the brake pedal 
within two minutes of pressing the unlock button on the key 
fob (see #unique_103 on page ). If you wait longer than 
two minutes, you must press the unlock button again, or 
place the key fob near the card reader located behind the cup 
holders on the center console. When your key fob is 
detected, the two minute authentication period restarts.
When approaching or leaving Model 3 carrying the key fob, 
you do not need to point the key fob at Model 3 as you press 
a button, but you must be within operating range.
Radio equipment on a similar frequency can affect the key. If 
this happens, move the key at least one foot (30 cm) away 
from other electronic devices (phones, laptops, etc.).
In the event that the key fob's battery is dead, you can still 
use it to drive the vehicle by scanning the key fob on the card 
reader located on the driver's side door pillar (like the key 
card).
Instructions for changing the battery are provided in 
Replacing the Key Fob Battery on page 23.
NOTE: You can use the same key fob with multiple Model 3 
vehicles provided you authenticate it (see Managing Keys on 
page 23). However, key fob works with only one Model 3 at 
a time. Therefore, to use a key fob for a different Model 3, 
touch its flat side against the card reader on the driver's side 
door pillar.
NOTE: Model 3 supports up to four different key fobs.
CAUTION: Protect the key from impact, high 
temperatures, and damage from liquids. Avoid contact 
with solvents, waxes, and abrasive cleaners.
Passive Locking and Unlocking
Locking and unlocking Model 3 with your key fob is 
conveniently hands-free. Although you must be carrying a 
paired key fob, there is no need to use it. Model 3 has 
sensors around the vehicle that can recognize the presence 
of a key fob within a range of approximately six feet (two 
meters). Therefore, you can keep your key fob in your pocket 
or purse and simply pull on the door handle to unlock. When 
carrying your key fob with you, you can also open the trunk 
without having to use the key by pressing the rear trunk's 
exterior door handle. If Walk-Away Door Lock is enabled, 
Model 3 automatically locks when you exit and the key fob is 
no longer in range (see Walk-Away Door Lock on page 25). 
Passive locking and unlocking is automatically enabled when 
you pair your key fob to Model 3.
Although you can use the same key fob with multiple 
vehicles, it can only be paired to one vehicle at a time. To 
activate a paired key fob to a different vehicle, touch the flat 
side onto the driver's side door pillar and click any button on 
the key fob to confirm.
Keys
22
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


NOTE: For increased security, passive locking and unlocking 
disables after being stationary for five minutes while within 
vehicle range when the vehicle is not in use (for example, you 
are standing outside your vehicle). In this situation, you must 
shake or press a button on the key fob to re-enable passive 
locking and unlocking.
Replacing the Key Fob Battery
Under normal use, the accessory key fob has a battery that 
lasts for up to one year, depending on key fob version and 
selected vehicle settings. When the battery is low, a message 
displays on the touchscreen.
To replace the key fob battery:
1. With the key fob placed button side down on a soft 
surface, release the bottom cover, using a small flat-
bladed tool.
2. Remove the battery by lifting it away from the retaining 
clips.
3. While avoiding touching the battery's flat surfaces, insert 
the new battery (type CR2032 ) with the ‘+’ side facing 
up.
NOTE: Wipe the battery clean before fitting and avoid 
touching the battery's flat surfaces. Finger marks on the 
flat surfaces of the battery can reduce battery life.
NOTE: CR2032 batteries can be purchased from any

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


WARNING: Riding in a moving vehicle with the seat 
back reclined can result in serious injuries in a collision, 
as you could slide under the lap belt or be propelled 
into the seat belt. Ensure your seat back is reclined no 
more than 30 degrees when the vehicle is moving.
Calibrating Seats
You can calibrate the driver seat. This is useful if you find 
your seat range limited or your driver profile does not 
automatically adjust the seat for you. Navigate to Controls > 
Service > Driver Seat, Steering & Mirrors Calibration and 
follow the instructions on the touchscreen.
WARNING: Ensure nothing is behind or underneath the 
driver seat during calibration. Failure to do so may 
cause serious injury.
Folding Rear Seats
Model 3 has a split rear seat that can fold forward.
NOTE: Driving with the rear seats folded forward can increase 
the amount of perceived noise and/or vibration coming from 
the rear of the vehicle (trunk, suspension, etc.).
CAUTION: Before folding seats all the way down, 
ensure the seat belt is unbuckled and there are no 
objects remaining on the seat.
Before folding, remove items from the seats and the rear 
footwell. To allow the rear seat backs to fold completely flat, 
you may need to move the front seats forward.
To fold a rear seat, pull the corresponding lever and fold the 
seat forward.
WARNING: Do not remove the rear seats for the 
purpose of storing or placing items. Doing so exposes 
the low and high voltage connections, which can cause 
vehicle damage or serious injury.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Wearing Seat Belts
Using seat belts and child safety seats is the most effective 
way to protect occupants if a collision occurs. Therefore, 
wearing a seat belt is required by law in most jurisdictions.
All seats are equipped with three-point inertia reel seat belts. 
Inertia reel belts are automatically tensioned to allow 
occupants to move comfortably during normal driving 
conditions. To securely hold child safety seats, all passenger 
seating positions are equipped with an automatic locking 
retractor (ALR) feature that, by fully extracting the seat belt 
(beyond the length needed for a typical adult occupant), 
locks the belt into place until the seat belt is unbuckled (see 
Installing Seat Belt Retained Child Seats on page 42).
The seat belt reel automatically tightens or locks to prevent 
movement of occupants if Model 3 experiences a force 
associated with hard acceleration, braking, cornering, or an 
impact in a collision.
Seat Belt Reminders
The seat belt reminder on the touchscreen 
alerts you if a seat belt for an occupied driver 
or passenger seat is unbuckled. If all 
occupants are buckled up and the reminder 
stays on, re-buckle seat belts to ensure they 
are correctly latched. Also remove any heavy 
objects (such as a briefcase) from an 
unoccupied seat. If the reminder light 
continues to stay on, contact Tesla.
You can temporarily disable a seat belt reminder associated 
with a rear seating position. This is useful when you are 
carrying an object in a rear seat that triggers the seat belt 
reminder alert. To disable the reminder, touch the associated 
seat on the seat belt reminder popup message that displays 
on the touchscreen when a seat belt reminder is active. When 
a reminder is disabled, the seat belt reminder icon is replaced 
by a seat icon, for the current drive only. Touch the seat again 
to re-enable the reminder.
WARNING: Do not disable a seat belt reminder when 
the seating position is occupied by a passenger.
WARNING: Seat belts must be worn by passengers in 
all seating positions. 
NOTE: In regions where regulations require seat belt 
reminders in rear seating positions, these reminders cannot 
be disabled. To cancel the reminder in an unoccupied seat 
when an object is detected, you must either fasten the seat 
belt or remove the object.
To Fasten a Belt
1. Ensure correct positioning of the seat. See (see Correct 
Driving Position on page 34) for details on the correct 
position of the driver's seat.
2. Draw the belt out smoothly, ensuring the belt lays flat 
across the pelvis, chest and mid-point of your collar bone, 
between the neck and shoulder. Ensure the belt is routed 
correctly and is not twisted. Never sit on the seat belt or 
any seat belt component.
WARNING: A twisted or incorrectly routed seat belt 
can cause damage and interfere with the 
functionality of the seat belt system.
3. Insert the latch plate into the buckle and press together 
until you hear a click indicating it is locked in place.
4. Pull the belt to check that it is securely fastened.
5. Pull the diagonal part of the belt toward the reel to remove 
excess slack.
To Adjust the Shoulder Anchor Height
Model 3 is equipped with an adjustable shoulder anchor for 
each front seat to ensure that the seat belt is positioned 
correctly. The seat belt should lay flat across the mid-point of 
your collar bone while in the correct driving position (see 
Correct Driving Position on page 34). Adjust the height of 
the shoulder anchor if the seat belt is not positioned 
correctly:
1. Press and hold the button on the shoulder anchor to 
release the locking mechanism.
2. While holding the button, move the shoulder anchor up or 
down, as necessary, to correctly position the seat belt.
Seat Belts
37
Seating and Safety Restraints


3. Release the button on the shoulder anchor so that it locks 
into position.
4. Without pressing the button, pull on the seat belt webbing 
and attempt to move the shoulder anchor downward to 
check that it is locked into position.
WARNING: Ensure that the seat belt is positioned 
correctly and that the shoulder anchor is locked into 
position before driving. Riding in a moving vehicle with 
the seat belt positioned incorrectly or with the 
shoulder anchor not locked into position can reduce 
the effectiveness of the seat belt in a collision.
To Release a Belt
Hold the belt near the buckle to prevent the belt from 
retracting too quickly, then press the button on the buckle. 
The belt retracts automatically. Ensure there is no obstruction 
that prevents the belt from fully retracting. The belt should 
not hang loose. If a seat belt does not fully retract, contact 
Tesla.
Wearing Seat Belts When Pregnant
Do not put the lap or shoulder sections of the seat belt over 
the abdominal area. Wear the lap section of the belt as low as 
possible across the hips, not the waist. Position the shoulder 
portion of the belt between the breasts and to the side of the 
abdomen. Consult your doctor for specific guidance.
WARNING: If the seat belt is uncomfortable, adjust the 
seating position instead of wearing the seat belt 
incorrectly.
WARNING: Never place anything between you and the 
seat belt to cushion the impact in the event of a 
collision.
Seat Belt Pre-tensioners
The front seat belts are equipped with pre‑tensioners that 
work in conjunction with the airbags in a collision. The 
pre‑tensioners automatically retract both the seat belt lower 
anchor and the upper shoulder webbing, reducing slack in 
both the lap and diagonal portions of the belts, resulting in 
reduced forward movement of the occupant.
If the pre-tensioners and airbags did not activate in an 
impact, this does not mean they malfunctioned. It usually 
means that the strength or type of force needed to activate 
them was not present.
The rear outboard seats are equipped with shoulder pre-
tensioners to retract the seat belt webbing to reduce forward 
movement of the occupant.
WARNING: Do not bend, sit on, or interfere with the 
pre-tensioner assembly. Doing so can cause damage 
that interferes with the proper functionality of the seat 
belt system.
WARNING: Once the seat belt pre-tensioners have 
been activated, they must be replaced. After any 
collision, have the airbags, seat belt pre-tensioners 
and any associated components checked and, if 
necessary, replaced.
Testing Seat Belts
To confirm that seat belts are operating correctly, perform 
these checks on each seat belt.
1. With the seat belt fastened, give the webbing nearest the 
buckle a quick and forceful pull. The buckle should remain 
securely locked.
Seat Belts
38
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


2. With the seat belt fastened, give the webbing closest to 
the door a quick and forceful pull. The permanent seat 
belt attachment should remain securely locked. Never 
attempt to remove this attachment.
3. With the belt unfastened, unreel the webbing to its limit. 
Check that unreeling is free from snags, and visually 
check the webbing for wear. Allow the webbing to retract, 
checking that retraction is smooth and complete.
4. With the webbing half unreeled, hold the tongue plate and 
pull forward quickly. The mechanism should lock 
automatically and prevent further unreeling.
If a seat belt fails any of these tests, repair immediately. Do 
not allow occupants to sit in a seat with a failed seat belt.
For information about cleaning seat belts, see Seat Belts on 
page 192.
Seat Belt Warnings
WARNING: Seat belts should be worn by all occupants 
at all times, even if driving for a very short distance. 
Failure to do so increases the risk of injury or death if a 
collision occurs.
WARNING: Secure small children in a suitable child 
safety seat as described in the Owner's Manual. 
Always follow the child safety seat manufacturer's 
instructions when installing.
WARNING: Ensure that all seat belts are worn correctly. 
An improperly worn seat belt increases the risk of 
injury or death if a collision occurs.
WARNING: Never sit on top of any seat belt 
component. Doing so can cause damage or improper 
deployment of safety equipment.
WARNING: Do not wear seat belts over hard, fragile or 
sharp items in clothing, such as pens, keys, 
eyeglasses, etc. The pressure from the seat belt on 
such items can cause injury.
WARNING: Seat belts should not be worn with any part 
of the strap twisted.
WARNING: Each seat belt assembly must be used by 
one occupant only. It is dangerous to put a seat belt 
around a child being carried on an occupant’s lap.
WARNING: Seat belts that have been worn in a collision 
must be inspected or replaced by Tesla, even if 
damage to the assembly is not obvious.
WARNING: Seat belts that show signs of wear, or have 
been cut or damaged in any way must be replaced 
immediately.
WARNING: Avoid contaminating a seat belt’s 
components with any chemicals, liquids, grit, dirt or 
cleaning products. If a seat belt fails to retract or latch 
into the buckle, it must be replaced immediately. Use 
the mobile app to schedule a service appointment.
WARNING: Do not make modifications or additions that 
can prevent a seat belt mechanism from taking up 
slack, or that can prevent a seat belt from being 
adjusted to remove slack. A seat belt with slack greatly 
reduces occupant protection.
WARNING: Do not make modifications that can 
interfere with the operation of a seat belt, or that can 
cause a seat belt to become inoperable.
WARNING: Do not use after market comfort and 
convenience products that attach to the seat belts.
WARNING: When seat belts are not in use, they should 
be fully retracted and not hanging loose. If a seat belt 
does not fully retract, schedule a service appointment.
WARNING: The seat belt system has no user 
serviceable parts and may contain pyrotechnics. Do 
not disassemble, remove, or replace components.

Seating and Safety Restraints


Guidelines for Seating Children
Your Model 3 seat belts are designed for adults and larger children. You must restrain infants and small children in the second 
row seats only, and you must use a suitable child safety seat appropriate for the child’s age, weight, and size.
WARNING: Never seat a child on a seat with an ACTIVE AIRBAG in front of it. DEATH or SERIOUS INJURY to the child 
can occur. See Airbags on page 46.
WARNING: Do not associate the Easy Entry setting with the driver's profile when a child is seated in the second row. 
Doing so can cause the driver's seat to push against the child, especially when a child is seated in a forward-facing child 
seat or booster seat. Do not rely on Model 3 to recognize or accommodate a child seated in the second row while using 
this setting (see Driver Profiles on page 89).
Refer to the label located on the sun visors.
NOTE: The image shown below is representative only and may not be identical to the label(s) in your vehicle.
Model 3 has an occupancy sensor in the front passenger seat that controls the status of the passenger front airbag (see 
Airbags on page 46).
When driving with a child seat on the front passenger seat, always double-check the status of the passenger 
front airbag to confirm that it is OFF.
To protect an adult subsequently occupying the front passenger seat, check to verify that the passenger 
front airbag is ON.
WARNING: It is the driver's responsibility to confirm that the passenger front airbag is OFF when a child is seated in the 
front passenger seat. If the passenger front airbag fails to disable with a child seat in position, place the child and child 
restraint system in the rear seat and use the mobile app to schedule service immediately.
WARNING: Always ensure that all Model 3 seats are locked in position before traveling. Failure to do so increases the 
risk of injury. Pay attention to all warnings displayed on the touchscreen.
Choosing a Child Safety Seat
All children age 12 and under should ride in the second and third row seats. Always use a child safety seat suitable for a young 
child’s age and weight. The following table is based on child safety seat recommendations determined by the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the United States (for more information, go to www.nhtsa.gov/ChildSafety/
Guidance).

Secure the booster seat using 
lower LATCH anchors (if 
available) and then restrain the 
child with the seat belt. If the 
booster seat is not equipped with 
LATCH anchors, then secure the 
booster seat with the child using 
the seat belt. However, if the 
combined weight of the child and 
booster seat exceeds 65 lbs 
(29.5 kg), secure the booster 
seat with the child using the seat 
belt only.
* Many child safety seats currently available allow children to ride rear-facing using the child safety seat’s integrated 5-point harness for a 
longer period of time BASED UPON SPECIFIC HEIGHT AND WEIGHT LIMITS. Keep your child in a rear facing seat for as long as possible. 
CHECK THE CHILD SAFETY SEAT MANUFACTURER’S INSTRUCTIONS AND CAREFULLY FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS.
** ISOFIX is the international standard for attachment points for child safety seats in passenger cars. The system has other regional names 
including LATCH ("Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children") in the United States and LUAS ("Lower Universal Anchorage System") or Canfix 
in Canada. It has also been called the "Universal Child Safety Seat System" or UCSSS.
*** Subject to instructions provided by the child safety seat manufacturer.
NOTE: When installing a child restraint system, you must also buckle the seat belt to silence the seat belt warning chime.
WARNING: Laws that govern how and where children should be carried when traveling in a vehicle are subject to change. 
It is the driver’s responsibility to keep up to date on, and comply with, all current regulations in the region(s) where 
Model 3 is driven. To check the child passenger safety laws for states in the U.S., go to: http://www.ghsa.org/html/
stateinfo/laws/childsafety_laws.html.
WARNING: Do not use LATCH/Isofix/i-Size anchors with child restraint system or booster seats that have an integral 
safety belt where the combined weight of the child plus the child restraint system exceeds 65 lbs (29.5 kg).
Seating Larger Children
If a child is too large to fit into a child safety seat, but too 
small to safely use the standard seat belts, use a booster seat 
appropriate for the child’s age and size. Carefully follow the 
manufacturer’s instructions to secure the booster seat.
WARNING: Larger children in booster seats should 
wear the seat belt like an adult. Do not extend the seat 
belt webbing fully to engage the automatic locking 
retractor (ALR).

Storage Areas


Installing Child Safety Seats
There are two general methods used to install child safety 
seats:
• Seat belt retained - these seats are secured using the 
vehicle’s seat belts.
• LATCH retained - these seats attach to anchor bars built 
into the vehicle’s rear seats.
Check the child safety seat manufacturer’s instructions and 
the table provided in this document to determine which 
installation method to use. Some child safety seats can be 
installed using either method. Always follow the child safety 
seat manufacturer’s instructions.
Installing Seat Belt Retained Child Seats
First, make sure that the child safety seat is appropriate for 
the weight, height, and age of the child.
Avoid dressing the child in bulky clothing and do not place 
any objects between the child and the restraint system.
Adjust harnesses for every child, every trip.
To securely hold child safety seats, all passenger seating 
positions are equipped with an automatic locking retractor 
(ALR) that, by pulling the seat belt beyond the length needed 
for a typical adult occupant, locks the belt into place until the 
seat belt is unbuckled and the webbing is fully retracted. The 
ALR mechanism operates as a ratchet, winding in slack and 
preventing the seat belt from extending any further until it 
has been completely rewound. When installing a child safety 
seat, engage the belt's automatic locking retractor by pulling 
the seat belt webbing until it is fully extended. The ALR 
system engages only when the seat belt is at its maximum 
extension point.
The automatic locking retractor (ALR) feature is not used for 
booster seats in which a large child is restrained by the 
vehicle's seat belts directly, and therefore not using a child 
safety seat's integrated restraints.
NOTE: An automatic locking retractor disengages only when 
the seat belt is unbuckled and fully retracted. The belt can 
then be worn as a normal belt, sliding freely in and out and 
locking tight only in an emergency. Once disengaged, the 
belt must be fully extended to re-engage the locking 
mechanism whenever you install a child safety seat.
Always follow the detailed instructions provided by the child 
safety seat manufacturer. General guidelines are provided 
below.
1. Place the child safety seat in Model 3, and fully extend the 
seat belt. Route and buckle the seat belt in accordance 
with the child safety seat manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Allow the seat belt to retract, and remove all slack in the 
seat belt while firmly pushing the child safety seat into the 
Model 3 seat.
3. Once all slack has been removed, forcefully pull the seat 
belt webbing to confirm that the automatic locking 
retractor (ALR) is engaged.
NOTE: The ALR disengages only after unbuckling and fully 
retracting the seat belt webbing. Once disengaged, the 
belt must be fully extended to re-engage the locking 
mechanism.
4. If the seat belt retained child safety seat has an upper 
tether, attach it to the back of the seat (see Attaching 
Upper Tether Straps on page 44).
Installing LATCH (ISOFIX) Child Seats
Lower LATCH anchors are provided in the second row 
outboard seats. The anchors are located between the seat's 
back rest and rear cushion. The exact location of each anchor 
is identified by a child safety seat identification button, 
illustrated below. The button is located on the seat back, 
directly above its associated anchor.
Child Safety Seats
42
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


In the second row, install LATCH child safety seats in the 
outboard seating positions only. Use only a seat belt retained 
seat in the center position.
To install a LATCH child safety seat, slide the safety seat 
latches onto the anchor bars until they click into place. 
Carefully read and follow the instructions provided by the 
child safety seat manufacturer.
Once installed, test the security of the installation before 
seating a child. Attempt to twist the child safety seat from 
side to side and try to pull it away from the seat, then check 
to ensure the anchors remain securely in place.
NOTE: Lower LATCH anchors should not be used with child 
seats or booster seats that have an integrated safety belt in 
situations where the combined weight of the child plus the 
child restraint is more than 65 lbs (29.5 kg). In these 
situations, use the safety belt instead.
Child Safety Seats
43
Seating and Safety Restraints


Attaching Upper Tether Straps
If an upper tether strap is provided, attach its hook to the 
anchor point located on the shelf behind the rear seats.
WARNING: Tighten upper tether straps according to 
the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the 
child safety seat.
WARNING: USE ONLY SEAT BELT RETAINED CHILD 
SAFETY SEATS IN THE CENTER SEATING POSITION.
To access an anchor point, press down on the back of its 
cover.
For dual-strap tethers, position a strap on each side of the 
head support.
For single-strap tethers at the outboard seating positions, 
route the strap over the outside-facing side of the head 
support (same side of the head support as the seat belt 
retraction mechanism).
For a single strap tether in the rear center seating position, 
route the strap over the top center of the head support.
For dual strap tether in the rear center seating position, route 
the straps around each side of the head support.
Testing a Child Safety Seat
Before seating a child, always make sure the child safety seat 
is not loose:
1. Hold the child safety seat by the belt path and try to slide 
the safety seat from side to side and front to back.
2. If the seat moves more than 1 inch (2.5 cm), it is too loose. 
Tighten the belt or reconnect the LATCH retained child 
safety seat.
3. If you are unable to reduce slack, try a different seat 
location or try another child safety seat.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Child Safety Seat Warnings
WARNING: Extreme hazard! Do not seat a child on the 
front passenger seat even if you are using a child 
safety seat. This seat has an airbag in front of it. 
Although this airbag is disabled when Model 3 detects 
a lightweight passenger, do not rely on technology to 
protect your child.
WARNING: Child restraint systems are designed to be 
secured in vehicle seats by lap belts or the lap belt 
portion of a lap-shoulder belt. Children could be 
endangered in a crash if their child restraints are not 
properly secured in the vehicle.
WARNING: According to collision statistics, children 
are safer when properly restrained in the rear seating 
positions than in the front seating positions.
WARNING: Do not use a forward facing child safety 
seat until your child weighs over 20 lbs (9 kg) and can 
sit independently. Up to the age of two, a child's spine 
and neck are not sufficiently developed to avoid injury 
in a frontal impact.
WARNING: Do not allow a baby or infant to be held on 
an adult's lap. All children should be restrained in an 
appropriate child safety seat at all times.
WARNING: To ensure children are safely seated, follow 
all instructions provided in this document and by the 
manufacturer of the child safety seat.
WARNING: Children should ride in a rear facing child 
safety seat using the seat’s integrated 5-point harness 
for as long as possible.
WARNING: Do not use seat belt extenders on a seat 
belt that is being used to install a child safety seat or 
booster seat.
WARNING: When seating larger children, make sure the 
child's head is supported and the child’s seat belt is 
properly adjusted and fastened. The shoulder portion 
of the belt must be away from the face and neck, and 
the lap portion must not be over the stomach.
WARNING: Never attach two child safety seats to one 
anchor point. In a collision, one anchor point may be 
incapable of securing both seats.
WARNING: Child restraint anchors are designed to 
withstand only those loads imposed by correctly fitted 
child restraints. Under no circumstances are they to be 
used for adult seat belts, harnesses, or for attaching 
other items or equipment to the vehicle.
WARNING: Always check harnesses and tether straps 
for damage and wear.
WARNING: Never leave a child unattended, even if the 
child is secured in a child safety seat.
WARNING: Never use a child safety seat that has been 
involved in a collision. Have the seat inspected or 
replaced as described in the child safety seat 
manufacturer’s instructions.

Location of Airbags
Airbags are located in the approximate areas shown below. Airbag warning information is printed on the sun visors.
Model 3 is equipped with an airbag and lap/shoulder belt (also called seat belt assembly) at both designated front seating 
positions. All occupants, including the driver, should always wear their seat belts whether or not an airbag is also provided at 
their seating position to minimize the risk of severe injury or death in the event of a crash.
NOTE: On RHD (Right Hand Drive) vehicles, the locations of the passenger and driver airbags are reversed.
1. United States only: Knee airbag
2. Front airbags
3. Seat-mounted side airbags
NOTE: Your vehicle is also equipped with a seat-mounted airbag on the inside portion of the driver's seat.
4. Curtain airbags
Airbags
46
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


How Airbags Work
Airbags inflate when sensors detect an impact that exceeds 
deployment thresholds. These thresholds are designed to 
predict the severity of a crash in time for the airbags to help 
protect the vehicle's occupants. Airbags inflate instantly with 
considerable force accompanied by a loud noise. The inflated 
bag, together with the seat belts, limits movement of 
occupants to reduce the risk of injury.
Front airbags are not ordinarily designed to inflate in rear 
collisions, rollovers, side collisions and when braking heavily 
or driving over bumps and potholes. Likewise, front airbags 
may not inflate in all frontal collisions, such as minor front 
collisions, underride collisions, or minor impacts with narrow 
objects (such as posts or poles). Significant superficial 
damage can occur to the vehicle without the airbags inflating 
and, conversely, a relatively small amount of structural 
damage can cause airbags to inflate. Therefore, the external 
appearance of the vehicle after a collision does not represent 
whether or not the front airbags should have inflated.
WARNING: Before modifying your vehicle to 
accommodate a person with disabilities in a way that 
may affect the airbag system, use the mobile app to 
schedule a service appointment.
Types of Airbags
Model 3 has the following types of airbags:
• Front airbags: The front airbags are designed to reduce 
injuries if larger children or adults are riding in the front 
seats. Follow all warnings and instructions related to 
seating a child on the front passenger seat (if permitted in 
your market region). See Child Safety Seats on page 40.
• Knee airbags: Knee airbags and the front airbags work 
together. The knee airbags limit the forward motion of the 
front seat occupants by restricting leg movement, thereby 
positioning the occupants so that the front airbags work 
more effectively.
• Seat-mounted side airbags: A seat-mounted side airbag 
in the front seats helps protect the pelvis and the thorax 
region of the torso; the seat-mounted far side airbag in 
the inside portion of the driver’s seat helps protect the 
head and torso. The seat-mounted side airbags on both 
the impacted and non-impacted side of the vehicle will 
inflate in the event of severe side impact or severe offset 
frontal impact.
• Curtain airbags: Curtain airbags help protect the head. 
Curtain airbags on both the impacted and non-impacted 
side of the vehicle will inflate only if a severe side impact 
occurs, or if the vehicle rolls over.
Airbag Status Indicator
The status of the passenger front airbag displays in the top 
corner of the touchscreen:
Before driving with a child seated on the 
front passenger seat (if legally permitted in 
your market region), always double-check 
the status of the passenger front airbag to 
confirm that it is OFF. When the passenger 
front airbag is OFF, it will not inflate when a 
collision occurs. This indicator also displays 
when the seat is unoccupied.
To protect an adult occupying the front 
passenger seat, ensure the passenger front 
airbag is ON. When the passenger front 
airbag is ON, it may inflate when a collision 
occurs.
The airbag indicator displays on the 
touchscreen for a few seconds at the start 
of every drive while checking the following 
functionality, as applicable:
• Airbags
• Seat belts with pre-tensioners and load limiters
• Impact sensors
• Occupant sensors
• Seat belt sensors
• Passive safety component wiring harnesses
• Onboard restraint controlled components (ex: 
accelerometer and other passive safety components)
After this check, the airbag indicator turns off. If the airbag 
system detects a fault in any of the previously mentioned 
components, the airbag warning indicator stays on. In this 
case contact Tesla service immediately. Do not drive the 
vehicle until the airbag system is inspected by Tesla.
Front Passenger Occupant Detection
Model 3 has an occupancy sensor in the front passenger seat that controls the status of the front airbag.
NOTE: The Occupant Classification System (OCS) meets the regulatory requirement of FMVSS 208 and automatically detects 
when inflating the passenger front airbag would be unnecessary or potentially harmful.
WARNING: Seating an infant in a rear facing child restraint system on a seat equipped with an operational airbag can 
cause serious injury or death.

* If the passenger airbag status indicator does not match the situation, do not use the seat. The passenger must ride in a different seat. Use 
the mobile app to schedule a service appointment.
NOTE: It takes approximately six seconds after you power on Model 3 for the Occupant Classification System (OCS) to report 
accurate status of the front passenger airbag. As a result, when you first power on Model 3, even in situations when it should 
be OFF because the seat is occupied by a weight of 20 lbs (9 kg) or less, it will take the touchscreen approximately six 
seconds to display the status, PASS AIRBAG OFF. If it fails to do so, use the mobile app to schedule a service appointment and 
do not seat a child in the front passenger seating position.
To make sure the sensing system can correctly detect occupancy status, eliminate the following:
• Objects lodged under the seat.
• Heavy objects sitting on the seat (briefcase, large purse, etc.).
• Objects wedged between the seat back and seat cushion.
• Cargo interfering with the seat.
• Aftermarket items attached to, or sitting on or between, the seat and occupant including but not limited to covers, mats, 
blankets, etc.
These conditions can interfere with the occupancy sensor. If you have eliminated the above possibilities, and the airbag status 
is still incorrect, ask passengers to ride in the rear seats and use the mobile app to schedule a service appointment to have the 
airbag system checked.
NOTE: The front passenger occupancy sensor affects the operation of the passenger front airbags only. The side airbags are 
not affected.
WARNING: If the front passenger airbag is not turning on or off as expected based on the weight thresholds previously 
described, use the mobile app to schedule a service appointment immediately.
WARNING: If seating a child in the front passenger seat is legally permissible in your market region, it is the driver's 
responsibility to ensure that the passenger front airbag is OFF. Never seat a child in a rear facing safety seat in the front 
passenger seat with an active airbag. DEATH or SERIOUS INJURY to the child can occur. Per recommendations by the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all occupants age 12 and under must ride in the rear seats.
WARNING: Do not use seat covers on Model 3. Doing so could restrict deployment of the seat-mounted side airbags if a 
collision occurs. It can also reduce the accuracy of the Occupant Classification System, if equipped.
Ensuring Accurate Occupant Detection
To help ensure an occupant in the front passenger seat can 
be accurately classified, the passenger must:
• Wear a seat belt.
• Sit upright on the center of the seat cushion, with 
shoulders resting against the seat back and legs extended 
comfortably in front with feet on the floor.
• Remain positioned on the seat cushion and not lift their 
weight off the seat (for example, by pushing their feet 
against the floor or pressing on the center console or 
armrest to lift up).
Airbags
48
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


• Never wear thick, wet, or bulky clothing (such as ski wear 
or padded clothing).
In addition to the items listed above, the following situations 
can interfere with the accuracy of the occupant classification 
system:
• Placing a radio transmitter (for example, a hunting radio or 
walkie-talkie) on the front passenger seat.
• Placing an AC/DC inverter, or a device that is being 
powered by the inverter (for example, a cell phone, tablet, 
or computer) on the front passenger seat cushion.
• Placing liquid (such as a bottled drink) or food containers 
on a car seat when a child restraint system is present.
• Incorrectly placing a child restraint system so that the 
entire lower section is not positioned against the seat 
cushion.
• Objects lodged under the seat or wedged between the 
seat back and cushion.
• Heavy objects sitting on the seat (briefcase, large purse).
• Cargo interfering with the seat.
• Aftermarket items attached to or placed between the seat 
and the occupant, such as covers, mats, blankets, etc.
These conditions can interfere with the occupancy sensor. If 
you have eliminated the above possibilities, and the airbag 
status is still incorrect, instruct passengers to ride in the rear 
seats and use the mobile app to schedule a service 
appointment to have the airbag system checked.
NOTE: Tesla follows NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration) recommendations that all occupants age 12 
and under must ride in a rear seating position.
NOTE: The front passenger occupancy sensor affects the 
operation of the passenger front airbags only. The side 
airbags are not affected.
WARNING: Failure to follow the instructions can 
adversely affect the Occupant Classification System 
(OCS) which can cause serious injury or death.
WARNING: If the front passenger airbag is not turning 
on or off as expected, do not seat a passenger in the 
front passenger seat. Use the mobile app to schedule a 
service appointment.
WARNING: To ensure accuracy of the Occupant 
Classification System (OCS), do not make any 
modifications to the front passenger seat.
WARNING: Do not use seat covers on Model 3. Doing 
so could restrict deployment of the seat-mounted side 
airbags if a collision occurs. It can also reduce the 
accuracy of the occupant detection system.
Examples of Correct and Incorrect 
Seating Positions
Correct seating position:
Incorrect seating position - the passenger's feet must be on 
the floor:
Incorrect seating position - the passenger must not slide 
forward on the seat cushion:
Incorrect seating position - the passenger must not recline the 
backrest to a laying down position when the vehicle is moving:

Seating and Safety Restraints


Inflation Effects
WARNING: When airbags inflate, a fine powder is 
released. This powder can irritate the skin and should 
be thoroughly flushed from the eyes and from any cuts 
or abrasions.
After inflation, the airbags deflate to provide a gradual 
cushioning effect for the occupants and to ensure the 
driver’s forward vision is not obscured.
If airbags have inflated, or if your vehicle has been in a 
collision, your vehicle requires servicing before it will power 
up. In addition, your airbags, seat belt pre-tensioners and any 
associated components must be checked, and if necessary, 
replaced. Use the mobile app to schedule a service 
appointment immediately.
In a collision, in addition to the airbags inflating:
• United States only: Your vehicle automatically dials 911 if 
Controls > Safety > Automatic 911 calls is enabled. 
Cancellation instructions as well as a countdown timer 
display on the touchscreen.
• Doors unlock.
• Hazard warning lights turn on.
• Interior lights turn on.
• High voltage is disabled.
• Windows go to the vent position.
• Vehicle applies the brakes to come to a stop.
NOTE: Depending on the nature of the impact and the forces 
involved, doors may not unlock in a collision and/or damage 
may prevent them from opening. In such cases, the door may 
need to be opened using the interior manual release, or other 
means of extrication (for example, exiting through another 
door, breaking the window, etc.).
NOTE: In some collisions, even if airbags did not inflate, high 
voltage may be disabled and you will be unable to power up 
and drive. Use the mobile app to schedule a service 
appointment immediately.
Airbag Warnings
WARNING: All occupants, including the driver, should 
always wear their seat belts, whether or not an airbag is 
also provided at their seating position, to minimize the 
risk of severe injury or death in the event of a collision.
WARNING: Front seat occupants should not place their 
arms over the airbag module, as an inflating airbag can 
cause fractures or other injuries.
WARNING: Do not use seat covers on Model 3. Doing 
so could restrict deployment of the seat-mounted side 
airbags if a collision occurs. It can also reduce the 
accuracy of the Occupant Classification System 
(OCS), if equipped.
WARNING: Airbags inflate with considerable speed and 
force, which can cause injury. To limit injuries, ensure 
that occupants are wearing seat belts and are correctly 
seated, with the seat positioned as far back as 
possible. The National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) recommends a minimum 
distance of 10 inches (25 cm) between an occupant’s 
chest and an airbag. 
WARNING: Children should not be seated on the front 
passenger seat unless permitted by regulations in your 
market region. Follow all regulations in your region for 
the appropriate way to seat a child based on the child's 
weight, size, and age. The safest place to seat infants 
and young children is in a rear seating position. Seating 
an infant or child in a rear-facing child restraint system 
on a seat equipped with an operational airbag can 
cause serious injury or death.
WARNING: Do not use a rear-facing child restraint 
system on a seat with an operational airbag in front of 
it. Doing so can cause injury or death if the airbag 
inflates.
WARNING: To ensure correct inflation of the side 
airbags, maintain an unobstructed gap between an 
occupant’s torso and the side of Model 3.
WARNING: Passengers shouldn't lean their heads 
against doors or windows. Doing so can cause injury if 
a curtain airbag inflates.
WARNING: Do not allow passengers to obstruct the 
operation of an airbag by placing feet, knees or any 
other part of the body on or near an airbag.
WARNING: Do not attach or place objects on or near 
the front airbags, the side of the front seats, the 
headliner at the side of the vehicle, or any other airbag 
cover that could interfere with inflation of an airbag. 
These include but are not limited to: steering wheel 
covers, decals, seat cushions, pillows, etc. Objects can 
cause serious injury if the vehicle is in a collision severe 
enough to cause the airbag to inflate.
WARNING: Following inflation, some airbag 
components are hot. Do not touch until they have 
cooled.

Wi-Fi is available as a data connection method and is often 
faster than cellular data networks. Connecting to Wi-Fi is 
especially useful in areas with limited or no cellular 
connectivity. To ensure fast, reliable delivery of software and 
map updates, Tesla recommends leaving Model 3 connected 
to a Wi-Fi network whenever possible (for example, when 
parked at home).
To connect to a Wi-Fi network:
1. Touch Controls > Wi-Fi. Model 3 begins to scan and 
display detected Wi-Fi networks that are within range.
NOTE: If a known Wi-Fi network does not appear in the 
list, move Model 3 closer to the access point or consider 
using a range extender.
NOTE: When connecting to a 5GHz network (if available), 
check which channels are supported in your region.

Searching for Wi-Fi Networks or add it manually in Add 
Wi-Fi Networks, enter the password (if necessary), then 
touch Confirm. When successfully connected, the Wi-Fi 
network shows in Known Wi-Fi Networks along with a 
green check. Whenever the network is within range, 
Model 3 connects to it automatically.
NOTE: Model 3 does not currently support connections to 
captive Wi-Fi networks (a captive Wi-Fi, commonly used 
by public hotspots, requires you to access a custom web 
portal and agree to terms of service prior to allowing you 
to log in).
NOTE: If more than one previously connected network is 
within range, Model 3 connects to the one most recently 
used.
NOTE: At Tesla Service Centers, Model 3 automatically 
connects to the Tesla Service Wi-Fi network.
Hotspots
Instead of a Wi-Fi network, you can also use a mobile hotspot 
(subject to fees and restrictions of your carrier). After 
connecting to your hotspot, select Remain Connected in 
Drive, if you want to keep the connection active while you are 
driving.
Troubleshooting Tips
If your vehicle's Wi-Fi connection is slow or it fails to

Bluetooth® Compatibility
You can use various Bluetooth devices in 
Model 3 provided it is paired and within 
operating range. For example, you can pair 
your Bluetooth-capable phone so you can use 
it hands-free. In addition to phones, you can 
pair other Bluetooth-enabled devices with 
Model 3. For example, you can pair an 
iPod Touch, iPad, Android tablet, etc. from 
which you can play music.
Before using your phone or other Bluetooth device with 
Model 3, you must pair it. Pairing sets up Model 3 to 
communicate with supported Bluetooth-capable devices. 
You can pair up to ten Bluetooth phones. Unless you've 
specified a specific phone as a Priority Device, or if the phone 
specified as Priority Device is not within range, Model 3 
always connects to the last phone that was used (provided it 
is within range). To connect to a different phone, see 
Switching Between Paired Devices on page 55.
NOTE: Authenticating your phone to use as a key (see Keys 
on page 21) does not allow you to use the phone hands-free, 
play media from it, etc. You must also pair it as described 
below.
NOTE: On many phones, Bluetooth turns off if the phone’s 
battery is low.
NOTE: Although Bluetooth typically supports wireless 
communication over distances of up to approximately 30 feet 
(nine meters), performance can vary based on the phone, or 
other device, you are using.
NOTE: Model 3 can pair up to twenty Bluetooth devices at a 
time but only allows two devices to connect simultaneously 
(such as one phone and one controller or two controllers) to 
each front and rear touchscreen (if equipped).
CAUTION: Do not leave your paired phone in your 
vehicle (for example, if you are hiking or at the beach). 
If you must leave your phone in the vehicle, disable 
Bluetooth and/or turn the phone off.
Pairing a Phone or Bluetooth Device
Pairing allows you to use your Bluetooth-capable phone 
hands-free to make and receive phone calls, access your 
contact list, recent calls, etc. It also allows you to play media 
files from your phone. Once a phone is paired, Model 3 can 
connect to it whenever the phone is within range.
1. To pair a phone or a Bluetooth device, sit inside Model 3 
and ensure the touchscreen is on.

myQ
If equipped, Model 3 can intelligently connect 
to your myQ® smart garage.
myQ is a smart garage control system that works seamlessly 
with Model 3, and allows you to remotely monitor and control 
your garage door from the vehicle's touchscreen or a paired 
phone. This is convenient if you forget to close your garage 
door, want to allow friends and family inside, or need to open 
and close it remotely (such as when receiving a package). By 
linking myQ with Model 3, the garage door can detect your 
vehicle nearby and automatically open or close to 
accommodate.
Follow these steps to set up myQ on your vehicle:
1. Your garage door must be myQ compatible. Use the myQ 
Compatibility tool (https://www.myq.com/app/myq-
compatibility) to determine this.
2. Ensure your garage is Wi-Fi compatible. myQ uses Wi-Fi 
to communicate with your smart phone and vehicle. Some 
garages will have a Wi-Fi or myQ symbol on the hub. Your 
garage must have a strong Wi-Fi signal to control and 
monitor your garage through your vehicle.
NOTE: If your garage is not compatible, you may be able 
to purchase an external myQ hub to use this feature.
3. Download the myQ app from your smart phone's app 
store. Use the app to set up your account information and 
pair the garage to your phone. myQ requires a paid 
subscription, which you can purchase in the app.
4. Check that your vehicle is running the latest available 
software version and has Wi-Fi or LTE connectivity.
5. Touch the garage icon at the top of the touchscreen or 
navigate to Controls > Locks > myQ Connected Garage >

HomeLink Universal Transceiver
If your vehicle is equipped with the 
HomeLink® Universal Transceiver, you can 
operate up to three Radio Frequency (RF) 
devices, including garage doors, gates, lights, 
and security systems.
NOTE: Depending on date of manufacture, market region, 
and options selected at time of purchase, some vehicles are 
not equipped with a HomeLink Universal Transceiver.
WARNING: Do not use the HomeLink Universal 
Transceiver with a device that does not have safety 
stop and reverse features. Using a device without 
these safety features increases the risk of injury or 
death.
Supported Modes
HomeLink supports three different transmit modes, which is 
how your vehicle and the RF device communicate. Selecting 
a transmit mode is determined by your RF device's 
compatibility:
• Standard Mode: Use Standard Mode if your RF device is 
equipped with a remote control that must be used to 
operate the device (for example, a remote-controlled 
garage door). This mode is the most commonly used 
transmit mode for HomeLink devices.
• D-Mode or UR-Mode: Use D-Mode or UR-Mode if the RF 
device does not have a remote control, and the receiver 
has a "Learn" button (may also be called "Program" or 
"Smart"). D-Mode and UR-Mode function similarly in that 
Model 3 communicates directly with the device's receiver 
as opposed to the remote control.
NOTE: D-Mode is used primarily in North America 
whereas UR-Mode is popular in Europe, the Middle East, 
and Asia. To determine the mode your device is 
compatible with, contact HomeLink by going to 
www.homelink.com or calling 1-800-355-3515.
Each of your devices can be set to a different mode. For 
example, your garage door can be set to Standard Mode, 
your front gate can be set to D-Mode, etc. To change a 
transmit mode, touch the HomeLink icon at the top of the 
Controls screen and select the device you want to change. 
Then, select Program and choose the desired mode for your 
device. Confirm by touching Set Mode and follow the 
onscreen instructions.
For older vehicles, changing the mode for one device 
changes the mode for all devices, so be careful when 
changing transmit modes. Devices not compatible with your 
selected mode may not work. Touch the HomeLink icon at the 
top of the touchscreen, then touch Change Transmit Mode.
NOTE: Check the product information for your HomeLink 
device to determine which mode is compatible with your 
device.
Programming HomeLink
To program HomeLink®:
1. Park Model 3 so that the front bumper is in front of the 
device you want to program.
CAUTION: Your device might open or close during 
programming. Therefore, before programming, 
make sure that the device is clear of any people or

Auto Opening and Closing
To operate a HomeLink device without using the 
touchscreen, you can automate the device to open as you 
approach, and close as you drive away:
1. Touch the HomeLink icon at the top of the Controls 
screen, touch HomeLink Settings, then choose the device 
you want to automate.
2. Adjust the device's HomeLink settings as needed:
◦ Select the Auto-open when arriving checkbox if you 
want the device to open as you approach.
◦ Touch the arrows to specify the distance you want 
Model 3 to be from the device before it opens.
◦ Select the Auto-close when leaving checkbox if you 
want the device to close as you drive away.
◦ Select the Auto-fold mirrors checkbox if you want 
mirrors to fold when you arrive at the HomeLink 
location. This is useful for narrow garages.
◦ Select the Chime for Auto-open and Auto-close 
checkbox if you want Model 3 to sound a chime when 
a signal has been sent to open or close the device.
HomeLink remembers the vehicle’s GPS location at the time 
of pairing and uses this to determine the vehicle’s 
whereabouts in relation to the HomeLink device. HomeLink 
does not detect and differentiate between opening and 
closing (ex: if Auto-open is triggered and the door is already 
open, the door will close) but typically determines whether to 
auto-open or -close based on the following:
Auto-Open: Detects when Model 3 approaches the garage 
door (or other HomeLink device) within a specified distance. 
Auto-open initiates so long as the approaching vehicle is in 
Drive and HomeLink is enabled. HomeLink does not trigger 
when the vehicle is already in the area.
Auto-Close: HomeLink triggers when the Model 3 shifts from 
Park into Reverse, and moves at least 23 feet (seven meters) 
in Reverse.
NOTE: Changing gears multiple times while in the specified 
distance may interfere with Auto-close.
In situations where you don't want the device to automatically 
open or close, touch Skip Auto-Open or Skip Auto-Close at 
any time during the count-down message.
NOTE: Do not rely on HomeLink to ensure the device fully 
closes.
Resetting the Location of the HomeLink 
Device
If you experience situations in which you sometimes drive up 
to your HomeLink device and it doesn't open, or the 
touchscreen does not display a notification as you approach 
a programmed device, you may need to reset the device's 
location. To do so, park as close as possible to the HomeLink 
device (garage door, gate, etc.) and display the HomeLink 
settings page by touching the HomeLink icon at the top of 
the Controls screen. Touch the name of the device you want 
to reset, then touch Reset Location.
Deleting a Device
To delete a HomeLink device, touch the HomeLink icon at the 
top of the Controls screen, then touch HomeLink Settings. 
Touch the name of the device you want to delete, then touch 
Delete.
NOTE: You can also perform a factory reset to erase your 
HomeLink settings, along with all other personal data (saved 
addresses, music favorites, imported contacts, etc.). See 
Erasing Personal Data with a Factory Reset on page 10.
NOTE: For security reasons, delete your HomeLink devices if 
you sell your Model 3.

Connectivity


Troubleshooting HomeLink
Standard Mode
In Standard Mode, Model 3 records the RF signal from your 
HomeLink device's remote control. The touchscreen 
instructs you to stand in front of the vehicle, point the 
device's remote control at the front bumper, and press and 
hold the button until the headlights flash. When the 
headlights flash, Model 3 has learned the remote control and 
you can touch Continue on the touchscreen. If the headlights 
do not flash:
• Check the batteries in the remote control. It is a good idea 
to replace the batteries before you start programming.
• Ensure you are standing in front of Model 3 with the 
device's remote control positioned within two inches (five 
cm) of the Tesla emblem.
• Press and hold the button on your device's remote control 
until the headlights flash. In some cases you must hold the 
button on the remote control for up to three minutes.
NOTE: Some HomeLink remote controls require multiple 
short presses (approximately one second each press) 
instead of one long duration press. If you are unsuccessful 
after multiple attempts of using long presses, try repeated 
presses of one second each.
D-Mode and UR-Mode
In D-Mode and UR-Mode, the device’s receiver learns Model 
3. The touchscreen instructs you to press the "Learn" button 
(may also be called "Program" or "Smart") on the device's 
receiver. If this does not work, refer to the following 
guidelines:
• Park Model 3 with its bumper as close as possible to the 
garage door, gate, etc. that you are trying to program.
• Make sure you are pressing the receiver's Learn/Program/
Smart button. For instructions on how to put the receiver 
into learning mode, refer to the product details provided 
with your RF device that you are trying to program.
• If you see a screen called "Train the receiver" while 
programming the device, remember that this is a time-
sensitive step. After pressing the Learn/Program/Smart 
button on the device's remote control or receiver, you only 
have approximately 30 seconds to return to your vehicle, 
press Continue, then press the trained HomeLink device 
name twice. Consider having someone assist you with this 
step.
• Most devices stay in learning mode for only three to five 
minutes. Immediately after pressing the device's Learn/
Program/Smart button, follow the instructions displayed 
on the vehicle's touchscreen.
For additional assistance or compatibility questions, contact 
HomeLink (www.homelink.com or call 1-800-355-3515).

When you open a door to enter Model 3, the touchscreen 
powers on and you can operate all controls. To shift Model 3, 
press the brake pedal and swipe up for Drive or down for 
Reverse on the touchscreen's drive mode strip (see Shifting 
on page 69).
If Auto Shift out of Park is enabled, Model 3 automatically 
selects Drive or Reverse based on the detected 
surroundings . Pressing the brake pedal shifts the vehicle 
into the selected drive mode displayed on the touchscreen's 
drive mode strip (provided the driver's door is closed and the 
driver's seat belt is buckled), and pressing the accelerator 
moves the vehicle in that direction.
NOTE: To turn Auto Shift out of Park on or off, touch Controls 
> Dynamics > Auto Shift out of Park.
Before accelerating when Auto Shift out of Park is enabled, 
check the touchscreen to make sure that Model 3 has shifted 
into the drive mode you want (Drive or Reverse). If the 
selection is not correct, or if Auto Shift out of Park is not 
enabled, swipe up for Drive or down for Reverse on the 
touchscreen's drive mode strip to choose a new drive mode. 
See Shifting on page 69.
NOTE: If PIN to Drive is enabled (see PIN to Drive on page 
138), you must enter a valid PIN on the touchscreen before 
you can drive Model 3.
Everything you need to know when driving Model 3 displays 
on the touchscreen.
Drive Disabled - Requires Authentication
If Model 3 does not detect a key when you press the brake (a 
phone key is not detected or two minutes have passed since 
you used the key card), the touchscreen displays a message 
telling you that driving requires authentication.
If you see this message, place the key card in either phone 
dock where the RFID transmitter can read it. The two-minute 
authentication period restarts and you can start Model 3 by 
pressing the brake pedal.
A number of factors can affect whether Model 3 can detect a 
phone key (for example, the device's battery is low or dead 
and is no longer able to communicate using Bluetooth).
Always keep your phone key or a key card with you. After 
driving, your key is needed to restart Model 3. And when you 
leave the vehicle, you must bring your key with you to lock 
Model 3, either manually or automatically.
Powering Off
When you finish driving and shift into Park, simply exit the 
vehicle. When you leave Model 3 with your phone key, it 
powers off automatically, turning off the touchscreen.
Model 3 also powers off automatically after being in Park for 
30 minutes, even if you are sitting in the driver’s seat.
Although usually not needed, you can power off Model 3 
while sitting in the driver’s seat, provided the vehicle is not 
moving. Touch Controls > Safety > Power Off. Model 3 
automatically powers back on after a short period if you press 
the brake pedal or touch the touchscreen.
NOTE: Model 3 automatically shifts into Park whenever it 
determines that you are exiting the vehicle (for example, the 
driver's seat belt is unbuckled and the vehicle is almost at a 
standstill). If you shift into Neutral, your vehicle shifts into 
Park when you open the door to exit. To keep your vehicle in 
Neutral, you will need to activate Transport Mode (see 
Instructions for Transporters on page 215).
Power Cycling the Vehicle
You can power cycle Model 3 if it demonstrates unusual 
behavior or displays a nondescript alert.
NOTE: If the touchscreen is unresponsive or demonstrates 
unusual behavior, reboot it before you power cycle the 
vehicle (see Restarting the Touchscreen on page 9).

Adjusting Exterior Mirrors
Adjust the exterior mirrors by touching Controls > Mirrors. 
Press the left scroll button on the steering wheel to choose 
whether you are adjusting the Left or Right mirror. Then use 
the left scroll button as follows to adjust the selected mirror 
to its desired position:
• To move the mirror up or down, roll the left scroll button 
up or down.
• To move the mirror inward or outward, press the left scroll 
button to the left or right.
Both exterior mirrors can tilt downward when the vehicle is 
shifted into Reverse. When you shift back into another drive 
mode, the mirrors return to their normal upward position. To 
turn this feature on or off, touch Controls > Mirrors > Mirror 
Auto Tilt.
NOTE: With a future software update, the Save button will 
retain the mirror adjustments but it does not function 
currently.
To reduce glare when driving at night, the rear view mirror 
and exterior side mirrors dim automatically. To enable or 
disable this feature, touch Controls > Mirrors > Mirror Auto 
Dim.
Availability of Mirror Auto Dim depends on configuration, 
market region, and date of manufacture.
NOTE: Both exterior mirrors have heaters that turn on and off 
with the rear window defroster.
Folding Mirrors
To manually fold and unfold exterior mirrors (for example, 
parking in a narrow garage, tight space, etc.), touch Controls 
> Fold/Unfold Mirrors.
When you manually fold the mirrors, they remain folded until 
your driving speed reaches 31 mph (50 km/h) (or until you 
manually unfold them by touching Controls > Unfold Mirrors).
NOTE: You cannot fold a mirror when driving over 31 mph (50 
km/h).
To set the mirrors to fold automatically whenever you exit and 
lock Model 3 touch Controls > Mirrors > Mirror Auto Fold. The 
mirrors unfold automatically when you unlock Model 3.
You can also set mirrors to fold automatically whenever you 
arrive at a specific location, which saves you from having to 
manually fold them each time you arrive at a frequented 
place. To set up, stop at the location you want to save (or 
drive at less than 3 mph (6 km/h)), and fold the mirrors. 
Touch Save Location when it appears briefly on the Fold 
Mirrors control.
If you no longer want mirrors to automatically fold, touch 
Controls > Unfold Mirrors when they fold at the saved 
location and then touch Remove Location.
When you leave the saved location, mirrors unfold when your 
driving speed reaches 3 mph (6 km/h), or when you touch 
Controls > Unfold Mirrors.
NOTE: Mirrors can automatically fold if you return to a saved 
location and are driving below 31 mph (50 km/h).
NOTE: You can override the automatic folding/unfolding of 
mirrors at any time (for example, Model 3 has no power) by 
pushing the mirror assembly away from you to unfold, or 
pulling it toward you to fold.
NOTE: If you expect ice to accumulate when Model 3 is 
parked, turn off Mirror Auto Fold. Accumulation of ice can 
prevent exterior side mirrors from folding or unfolding. See 
Cold Weather Best Practices on page 151 for information on 
how to ensure your mirrors function properly in cold weather.
You can integrate auto-folding mirrors with HomeLink (see 
Smart Garage on page 58). To enable, go to HomeLink > 
Auto-Fold Mirrors when Nearby.
Rear View Mirror
Adjust the rear view mirror manually. When in Drive or 
Neutral, the rear view mirror automatically dims in low 
lighting conditions based on the time of day (for example, 
when driving at night).
Vanity Mirrors
To expose and illuminate the vanity mirror, fold the sun visor 
downwards, then use the tab to lower the mirror cover. After 
closing the mirror cover, the light turns off.

the button on the drive mode strip while pressing the brake 
pedal. In emergency situations when driving above 5 mph (8 
km/h), press and hold the Park button to slowly bring the 
vehicle to a stop.
The touchscreen is the preferred method to manually shift. 
However, in the unlikely situation in which the touchscreen is 
unavailable and therefore can't be used, the drive mode 
selector on the overhead console automatically activates and 
must be used to shift (see Shift Using the Overhead Console 
on page 70).
If you try to shift when it is prohibited by the current driving 
speed, the touchscreen displays an alert, a chime sounds, 
and the drive mode does not change.
Auto Shift from Park
Auto Shift from Park is a BETA feature and is disabled by 
default. When disabled, use the touchscreen or the overhead 
console to manually shift. To enable Auto Shift from Park, 
touch Controls > Dynamics > Auto Shift from Park.
When Auto Shift from Park is enabled, Model 3 is designed to 
automatically select Drive or Reverse. The touchscreen 
displays the selected drive mode when the driver's door is 
closed and seat belt is buckled.
To override the selection, press the brake pedal and use the 
drive mode strip on touchscreen to shift into your desired

situations when Model 3 does not shift from Park, 
check the touchscreen for instructions on how to 
proceed.
WARNING: It is the driver's responsibility to always 
ensure the vehicle is in Park before exiting. Never rely 
on Model 3 to automatically shift into Park for you.
Drive
To manually shift into Drive, swipe up on the drive mode strip 
located on the touchscreen or, if the touchscreen is 
unavailable, press D on the drive mode selector located on 
the overhead console. You can shift into Drive when Model 3 
is stopped or moving less than 5 mph (8 km/h) in Reverse.

Touch Controls > Lights to control the lights.
NOTE: You can also access an abbreviated lights menu while 
driving by touching the High Beam button on the steering 
wheel. A lights menu displays on the touchscreen, providing 
quick access to headlight controls.
In addition to the lights that you can control from the 
touchscreen, Model 3 has convenience lights that turn on 
and off automatically based on what you are doing. For 
example, interior lights, marker lights, tail lights, and puddle 
lights turn on when you unlock Model 3, when you open a 
door, and when you shift into Park. They turn off 
automatically after a minute or two or when you shift or lock 
Model 3.
Exterior Lights
Exterior lights (headlights, tail lights, side marker lights, 
parking lights, and license plate lights) are set to Auto each 
time you start Model 3. When set to Auto, exterior lights 
automatically turn on when driving in low lighting conditions, 
or whenever the wipers are active. If you change to a 
different setting, lights always revert to Auto on your next 
drive.
Touch one of these options to change and retain the exterior 
light setting until adjusted again or the next time you drive:
• Off: Exterior lights turn off. When driving, daytime running 
lights may remain on based on regulations in various 
market regions.
• Parking: Parking lights, side marker lights, tail lights and 
license plate lights turn on.
• On: Low beam headlights, side marker lights, parking 
lights, tail lights, and license plate lights turn on.
If equipped, the headlights automatically adjust to improve 
your view based on your driving speed and steering angle. 
When driving at lower speeds with low beam headlights on, 
the headlights increase lateral illumination to make 
pedestrians and curbs more visible and to improve visibility 
when turning at a dark intersection, into a driveway, or when 
making a u-turn.
CAUTION: Ensure the headlights and rear lights are on 
during low visibility conditions (for example, when it is 
dark, foggy, snowy, or the road is wet, etc.). The rear 
tail lights are off while daytime running lights are on. 
Failure to do so can cause damage or serious injury.
Dome Lights
Turn the interior dome (map) lights on or off. If set to Auto, all 
interior dome lights turn on when you unlock Model 3, open a 
door upon exiting, or shift into Park.
You can also manually turn an individual dome light on or off 
by touching its lens. If you turn a dome light on, it turns off 
when Model 3 powers off. If Model 3 was already powered 
off when you manually turned the light on, it turns off after 
60 minutes.
Accent Lights
Enable or disable the accent lights that line the cabin of your 
vehicle and customize the accent light color to your 
preferences. When enabled and Model 3 shifts out of Park, 
the accent lights dim depending on the setting selected (for 
example, during the day Auto dims the accents lights all the 
way down while On dims according to the display setting). 
You can also turn the footwell lights on or off.
Headlights after Exit
When you stop driving and park Model 3 in low lighting 
conditions, exterior lights temporarily remain illuminated. 
They automatically turn off after one minute or when you lock 
Model 3 whichever comes first.
NOTE: If you lock Model 3 using the Tesla mobile app, the 
headlights immediately turn off. However, if the vehicle locks 
because Walk-Away Door Lock is enabled (see Walk-Away 
Door Lock on page 25), the headlights automatically turn off 
after one minute.
To turn this feature on and off, touch Controls > Lights > 
Headlights After Exit. When Headlights After Exit is off, the 
headlights turn off immediately when you engage Park and 
open a door.
High Beam Headlights
Use the high beam headlight button on the left side of the 
steering wheel to control the headlights:
• Press and quickly release to flash high beam headlights.
• Press and hold to turn on high beam headlights - 
touchscreen displays a brief timer and you must hold for 
the duration of the timer to latch the high beam headlights

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


The following indicator lights are visible on the touchscreen 
to show the status of the headlights:
Low beam headlights are on.
Illuminates when high beams are on but the 
Adaptive Headlights setting is turned off or if 
the Adaptive Headlights setting is turned on 
but is temporarily unavailable.
High beams are currently turned on, and 
Adaptive Headlights is ready to turn off the 
high beams if light is detected in front of 
Model 3.
High beams are temporarily turned off 
because Adaptive Headlights is operating and 
light is detected in front of Model 3. When 
light is no longer detected, high beam 
headlights automatically turn back on.
Adaptive Headlights
When Adaptive Headlights is enabled, Model 3 automatically 
switches between the high beam and low beam headlights 
based on whether or not there is light detected in front of 
Model 3.
The headlights also adjust to curves on the road ahead to 
provide greater visibility at night.
To control this feature, touch Controls > Lights > Adaptive 
Headlights, or by using the lights popup that displays on the 
touchscreen when you press the high beam headlight button 
on the left side of the steering wheel.
NOTE: Adaptive Headlights is automatically enabled when 
Autosteer is engaged. To switch to low beam headlights, 
press the high beam headlight button on the steering wheel. 
Adaptive Headlights is re-enabled every time Autosteer is 
activated.
WARNING: Adaptive Headlights is a convenience 
feature only and is subject to limitations. It is the 
driver's responsibility to make sure that headlights are 
always appropriately adjusted for weather conditions 
and driving circumstances.
Headlight Adjustments
To adjust the angle of the headlights, touch Controls > 
Service > Adjust Headlights, then follow the onscreen 
instructions. You can choose which headlight you would like 
to adjust by selecting it on the touchscreen.
NOTE: Headlights do not require adjustments when 
temporarily driving into a region where the traffic direction is 
different (for example, driving in right-hand traffic region, 
and then driving into a region with left-hand traffic).
WARNING: Proceed with caution when adjusting 
headlights. Tesla has carefully calibrated the position 
of the headlights to be in an optimum position for most 
driving scenarios. Tesla recommends that you do not 
adjust headlights unless you are familiar with how 
headlights should be adjusted. Once adjusted, you will 
be unable to automatically restore them to their 
originally calibrated position. Contact Tesla for 
assistance when adjusting headlights.
Turn Signals
To engage a turn signal, press the corresponding arrow 
button on the left side of the steering wheel. A turn signal 
cancels based on the angle of the steering wheel (for 
example, you finish making a turn). You can also cancel a turn 
signal by pressing the turn signal button a second time.
If Controls > Lights > Automatic Turn Signals is set to Auto 
Cancel, turn signals cancel automatically when Model 3 
detects completion of a maneuver such as a merge, lane 
change, or a fork in the roadway. You can override automatic 
cancellation at any time (for example, you want the turn 
signal to remain on because you are making more than one 
lane change). To override, engage the turn signal by pressing 
and momentarily holding the turn signal button (instead of 
just pressing). Then, when the first maneuver is complete, 
the turn signal remains on. If Automatic Turn Signals is set to 
Off, you must cancel the turn signal manually by pressing the 
turn signal button after maneuvers such as a merge, lane 
change, or fork in the roadway.

When a turn signal is operating, the 
corresponding indicator lights up on the 
touchscreen and you can hear a clicking 
sound.
Hazard Warning Flashers
To turn on the hazard warning flashers, press the button on 
the drive mode selector located on the overhead center. All 
turn signals flash. Press again to turn off.
If a severe crash is detected by your vehicle, the hazard 
warning flashers will automatically turn on and flash quickly 
to increase visibility. Pressing the hazard warning flashers 
once will return the lights to their normal cadence. Pressing a 
second time turns all hazard warning flashers off.
NOTE: Hazard warning flashers operate even without a key 
nearby.
Condensation in Head or Tail Lights
Due to weather changes, humidity levels, or recent exposure 
to water (such as a car wash), condensation may occasionally 
accumulate in your vehicle’s head or tail lights. This is normal
— as the weather gets warmer and humidity decreases, 
condensation often disappears on its own. If you notice water 
buildup within the exterior lenses, or if the condensation 
affects the visibility of the exterior lights, contact Tesla 
Service.

Wipers and Washers
You can access wiper settings by touching the wiper button 
on the steering wheel.
• Press the wiper button to wipe the windshield. If the 
wiper is already operating at a wiper setting and is not set 
to Auto, pressing the wiper button cycles through speeds. 
Wiper speeds cycle as follows: I > II > III > IIII > III > II > I.
• Press and hold the wiper button to spray washer fluid 
onto the windshield. After releasing the button, the wipers 
perform two additional wipes then, depending on vehicle 
and environmental conditions, a third wipe a few seconds 
later. You can also press and hold the wiper button for a 
continuous spray of washer fluid—the wipers perform the 
wipes after you release.
You can also access wiper settings by touching Controls > 
Wipers.
Whenever you press the wiper button on the steering wheel, 
the touchscreen displays the wiper menu, allowing you to 
adjust wiper settings. Roll the left scroll button on the 
steering wheel up or down to choose your desired setting.
1. Turn the wipers off.
2. Choose how you want the wipers to operate:
◦ IIII - Continuous, fast.
◦ III - Continuous, slow.
◦ II - Intermittent, fast.
◦ I - Intermittent, slow.
◦ Auto - Model 3 detects precipitation and adjusts the 
wiping speed and intensity. Pressing the wiper button 
while the wipers are set to Auto temporarily increases 
the sensitivity of the wipers.
NOTE: When you engage Autosteer the wipers are set 
to Auto. Although you can change the wiper setting 
from Auto while using Autosteer, the wipers once 
again default to Auto the next time you engage 
Autosteer.
NOTE: The Auto setting is currently in BETA. If 
uncertain about using the Auto setting while in the 
BETA phase, Tesla recommends operating the wipers 
manually, as necessary.
NOTE: You can also adjust the windshield wiper speed and 
frequency using voice commands (see Voice Commands on 
page 18).
Periodically check and clean the edge of the wiper blades. If 
a blade is damaged, replace it immediately. For details on

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Braking Systems
WARNING: Properly functioning braking systems are 
critical to ensure safety. If you experience a problem 
with the brake pedal, brake calipers, or any component 
of a Model 3 braking system, contact Tesla 
immediately.
Model 3 has an anti-lock braking system (ABS) that prevents 
the wheels from locking when you apply maximum brake 
pressure. This improves steering control during heavy 
braking in most road conditions.
During emergency braking conditions, the ABS constantly 
monitors the speed of each wheel and varies the brake 
pressure according to the grip available.
The alteration of brake pressure can be felt as a pulsing 
sensation through the brake pedal. This demonstrates that 
the ABS is operating and is not a cause for concern. Keep 
firm and steady pressure on the brake pedal while 
experiencing the pulsing.
(USA) The ABS indicator briefly flashes amber 
on the touchscreen when you first start Model 
3. If this indicator lights up at any other time, 
an ABS fault has occurred and the ABS is not 
operating. Contact Tesla. The braking system 
remains fully operational and is not affected by 
an ABS failure. However, braking distances 
may increase. Drive cautiously and avoid heavy 
braking.
(Canada) The ABS indicator briefly flashes 
amber on the touchscreen when you first start 
Model 3. If this indicator lights up at any other 
time, an ABS fault has occurred and the ABS is 
not operating. Contact Tesla. The braking 
system remains fully operational and is not 
affected by an ABS failure. However, braking 
distances may increase. Drive cautiously and 
avoid heavy braking.
(USA) If the touchscreen displays this red 
brake indicator at any time other than briefly 
when you first start Model 3, a brake system 
fault is detected, or the level of the brake fluid 
is low. Contact Tesla immediately. Apply 
steady pressure and keep the brakes firm to 
bring the vehicle to a stop when safe to do so.
(Canada) If the touchscreen displays this red 
brake indicator at any time other than briefly 
when you first start Model 3, a brake system 
fault is detected, or the level of the brake fluid 
is low. Contact Tesla immediately. Apply 
steady pressure and keep the brakes firm to 
bring the vehicle to a stop when safe to do so.
(USA) The touchscreen displays this amber 
brake indicator if a brake booster fault is 
detected. Apply steady pressure and keep the 
brakes firm to stop the vehicle when safety 
permits. Hydraulic Boost Compensation will be 
active (see Hydraulic Boost Compensation on 
page 78).
(Canada) The touchscreen displays this amber 
brake indicator if a brake booster fault is 
detected. Apply steady pressure and keep the 
brakes firm to stop the vehicle when safety 
permits. Hydraulic Boost Compensation will be 
active (see Hydraulic Boost Compensation on 
page 78).
Emergency Braking
In an emergency, fully press the brake pedal and maintain 
firm pressure, even on low traction surfaces. The ABS varies 
the braking pressure to each wheel according to the amount 
of traction available. This prevents wheels from locking and 
ensures that you stop as safely as possible.
If an alternative method is needed to bring the vehicle to a 
stop, press and hold the Park button on the touchscreen's 
drive mode strip to apply the brakes and remove drive torque 
while the button is held. Swipe from the edge of the 
touchscreen towards the passenger, to bring up the drive 
mode strip.
WARNING: Do not pump the brake pedal. Doing so 
interrupts operation of the ABS and can increase 
braking distance.
WARNING: Always maintain a safe distance from the 
vehicle in front of you and be aware of hazardous 
driving conditions. While the ABS can improve 
stopping distance, it cannot overcome the laws of 
physics. It also does not prevent the danger of 
hydroplaning (where a layer of water prevents direct 
contact between the tires and the road).
CAUTION: Automatic Emergency Braking (see Collision 
Avoidance Assist on page 132) may intervene to 
automatically brake in situations where a collision is 
considered imminent. Automatic Emergency Braking is 
not designed to prevent a collision. At best, it can 
minimize the impact of a frontal collision by attempting 
to reduce your driving speed. Depending on Automatic 
Emergency Braking to avoid a collision can result in 
serious injury or death.
CAUTION: In emergency situations, if the brakes are 
not functioning properly, press and hold the Park 
button on the overhead console or touchscreen to 
bring Model 3 to a stop. Do not use this method to stop 
the vehicle unless absolutely necessary.
Braking and Stopping

Driving


Dynamic Brake Lights (if equipped)
If you are driving over 30 mph (50 km/h) and brake forcefully 
(or if Automatic Emergency Braking engages), the brake 
lights flash quickly to warn other drivers that Model 3 is 
rapidly slowing down. If Model 3 stops completely, the 
hazard warning lights flash. Flashing continues until you 
press the accelerator or manually press the hazard lights 
button to turn them off (see Hazard Warning Flashers on 
page 74).
NOTE: When towing a trailer (if applicable), the brake lights 
on the trailer also operate as described above, even when the 
trailer is not equipped with a separate braking system.
WARNING: When towing a trailer (if applicable), always 
increase your following distance. Sudden braking may 
result in skidding, jack-knifing, and loss of control.
Brake Disc Wiping
To ensure brakes remain responsive in cold and wet weather, 
Model 3 is equipped with brake disc wiping. When cold and 
wet weather is detected, this feature repeatedly applies an 
imperceptible amount of brake force to remove water from 
the surface of the brake discs.
Hydraulic Fade Compensation
Model 3 is equipped with hydraulic fade compensation. This 
assists in monitoring brake system pressure and ABS activity 
for instances of reduced brake performance. If reduced brake 
performance is detected (for example, as a result of brake 
fade, or cold or wet conditions), you may hear a sound, feel 
the brake pedal pull away from your foot, and notice a strong 
increase in braking. Brake as you normally would and 
continue to press the brake pedal without releasing or 
pumping the brakes.
CAUTION: In emergency situations, if the brakes are 
not functioning properly, press and hold the Park 
button on the overhead console or touchscreen to 
bring Model 3 to a stop. Do not use this method to stop 
the vehicle unless absolutely necessary.
WARNING: Always maintain a safe driving distance 
from the vehicle in front of you and exercise caution 
when driving conditions are hazardous. Brake disc 
wiping and hydraulic fade compensation is not a 
substitute for adequately applying the brakes.
Hydraulic Boost Compensation
Model 3 is equipped with a brake booster that activates the 
brakes when the brake pedal is pressed. Hydraulic boost 
compensation provides mechanical assistance if the brake 
booster fails. If a brake booster failure is detected, the brake 
pedal feels stiffer to press and you may hear a sound when 
you press the brake pedal. To stop Model 3, apply steady 
force to the brake pedal without releasing or pumping. Drive 
cautiously and maintain a safe distance from other road users
—brake pedal responsiveness and braking performance may 
be degraded.
Regenerative Braking
Whenever Model 3 is moving and your foot is off the 
accelerator, regenerative braking slows down the vehicle and 
feeds any surplus power back to the Battery. By anticipating 
your stops and reducing or removing pressure from the 
accelerator pedal to slow down, you can take advantage of 
regenerative braking to increase driving range.
Vehicle deceleration due to regenerative braking may vary 
depending on the current state of the Battery. For example, 
regenerative braking may be limited if the Battery is cold or is 
already fully charged.
To experience the same amount of deceleration whenever 
you release the accelerator pedal, regardless of the state of 
the Battery, you can choose to have the regular braking 
system automatically engage whenever regenerative braking 
is limited. Touch Controls > Dynamics > Apply Brakes When 
Regenerative Braking is Limited.
WARNING: Apply Brakes When Regenerative Braking is 
Limited may not operate if the brakes are extremely 
hot.
NOTE: If Apply Brakes When Regenerative Braking is Limited 
is enabled and applying the brakes, the brake pedal may 
move and it may feel stiffer when pressed. This is expected 
and does not change your ability to slow down Model 3.
The power meter (a thin line in the touchscreen's car status 
area) displays real-time power usage:

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


1. Represents power being output by the Battery, such as 
that used to accelerate the vehicle. When you press the 
accelerator pedal, the top half of the power meter fills 
with black (or white if the display is dark).
2. Represents power generated from regenerative braking, 
or power that is captured from slowing down the vehicle. 
Power being fed back to the Battery displays in green 
whereas power used by the regular braking system 
displays in gray.
NOTE: Installing winter tires with aggressive compound and 
tread design may result in temporarily-reduced regenerative 
braking power. However, your vehicle is designed to 
continuously recalibrate itself, and after changing tires it will 
increasingly restore regenerative braking power after some 
straight-line accelerations. For most drivers this occurs after 
a short period of normal driving, but drivers who normally 
accelerate lightly may need to use slightly harder 
accelerations while the recalibration is in progress. Touch 
Service > Wheel & Tire > Tires to select winter tires and 
quicken this process.
NOTE: If regenerative braking is aggressively slowing Model 
3 (such as when your foot is completely off the accelerator 
pedal at highway speeds), the brake lights turn on to alert 
others that you are slowing down.
NOTE: Because Model 3 uses regenerative braking, the brake 
pads are typically used less frequently than those in 
traditional braking systems. To avoid the accumulation of rust 
and corrosion, Tesla recommends frequently pressing the 
brake pedal to apply the mechanical brakes and dry the brake 
pads and rotors.
WARNING: In snowy or icy conditions, Model 3 may 
experience loss of traction during regenerative 
braking. 
WARNING: Never rely on your vehicle to adequately 
decelerate or fully stop your vehicle. Many factors can 
contribute to a longer stopping distance, including 
downward slopes and reduced or limited regenerative 
braking. Always be prepared to use the brake pedal to 
adequately decelerate or stop.
WARNING: Press the brake pedal if Model 3 moves 
when unsafe to do so. It is your responsibility to stay 
alert and be in control of the vehicle at all times. Failure 
to do so can result in serious damage, injury, or death.
WARNING: Do not rely on regenerative braking to keep 
you and your vehicle safe. Various factors such as 
driving with a heavy vehicle load, on a steep hill, or on 
wet or icy roads affect deceleration rate and the 
distance at which Model 3 will come to a stop. Drive 
attentively and always stay prepared to use the brake 
pedal to stop as appropriate based on traffic and road 
conditions.
WARNING: Forward Collision Warning and Automatic 
Emergency Braking do not operate when driving at 
very low speeds (see Collision Avoidance Assist on 
page 132). Do not rely on these features to warn you, 
or to prevent or reduce the impact of a collision.
Parking Brake
To engage the parking brake, touch Controls > Safety, press 
the brake pedal and then touch Parking Brake.
(USA) A red parking brake indicator lights up 
on the touchscreen when the parking brake is 
engaged.
(Canada) A red parking brake indicator lights 
up on the touchscreen when the parking brake 
is engaged.
The parking brake is released when the vehicle is shifted into 
another gear.
You can also engage the parking brake by touching and 
holding the Park button on the touchscreen's drive mode 
strip.
(USA) If the parking brake experiences an 
electrical issue, the amber parking brake 
indicator lights up and a fault message 
displays on the touchscreen.
(Canada) If the parking brake experiences an 
electrical issue, the amber parking brake 
indicator lights up and a fault message 
displays on the touchscreen.
NOTE: The parking brake operates on the rear wheels only, 
and is independent of the pedal-operated brake system.
CAUTION: In the unlikely event that Model 3 loses 
electrical power, you cannot access the touchscreen 
and are therefore unable to release the parking brake 
without first jump starting (see Jump Starting on page 
222).
WARNING: In snowy or icy conditions the rear wheels 
may not have sufficient traction to prevent Model 3 
from sliding down a slope, particularly if not using 
winter tires. Avoid parking on hills in snowy or icy 
conditions. You are always responsible for parking 
safely.
WARNING: Your Model 3 may display an alert if the 
road is too steep to safely park on, or if the parking 
brakes are not properly engaged. These alerts are for 
guidance purposes only and are not a substitute for the 
driver’s judgment of safe parking conditions, including 
specific road or weather conditions. Do not depend on 
these alerts to determine whether or not it is safe to 
park at any location. You are always responsible for 
parking safely.

Brake Wear
Model 3 brake pads are equipped with wear indicators. A 
wear indicator is a thin metal strip attached to the brake pad 
that squeals as it rubs against the rotor when the pad wears 
down. This squealing sound indicates that the brake pads 
have reached the end of their service life and require 
replacement. To replace the brake pads, contact Tesla 
Service.
Brakes must be periodically inspected visually by removing 
the tire and wheel. For detailed specifications and service 
limits for rotors and brake pads, see Subsystems on page 
206. Additionally, Tesla recommends cleaning and 
lubricating the brake calipers every year or 12,500 miles 
(20,000 km) if in an area where roads are salted during 
winter months.
WARNING: Neglecting to replace worn brake pads 
damages the braking system and can result in a braking 
hazard.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Model 3 is designed to detect the presence of objects. When 
driving slowly (for example, when parking), the vehicle alerts 
you if an object is detected in close proximity of your Model 
3. The vehicle alerts you when objects are detected in front 
of Model 3 when you are in Drive, and behind Model 3 when 
you are in Reverse.
WARNING: You may not be alerted if Model 3 rolls 
freely in the opposite direction (for example, Park 
Assist does not display an alert if Model 3 rolls 
backwards down a hill while in Drive).
WARNING: Never depend on Park Assist to inform you 
if an area you are approaching is free of objects and/or 
people. Several external factors can reduce the 
performance of Park Assist, causing either no readings 
or false readings (see Limitations and False Warnings 
on page 81). Therefore, depending on Park Assist to 
determine if Model 3 is approaching an obstruction can 
result in damage to the vehicle and/or objects, and can 
potentially cause serious injury. Always inspect the 
area with your own eyes. When reversing, perform 
shoulder checks and use all mirrors. Park assist does 
not detect children, pedestrians, bicyclists, animals, or 
objects that are moving, protruding, located too far 
above or below the cameras, or too close or too far 
from the cameras. Park Assist is for guidance purposes 
only and is not intended to replace your own direct 
visual checks. It is not a substitute for careful driving.
Tesla Vision Park Assist
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, 
options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may 
not be equipped with Tesla Vision Park Assist.
Your vehicle uses the cameras mounted on the front, rear, 
and sides of Model 3 to create a high-fidelity reproduction of 
surrounding objects on the touchscreen.
The colors on the visualization correspond to the distance 
between Model 3 and the object shown. Red is closer to 
Model 3, and yellow is farther from Model 3.
Visual and Audio Feedback
When you shift to Reverse, the Park Assist view displays on 
the touchscreen, showing objects that are in close proximity 
to the front and rear of Model 3. This view closes when you 
shift into Drive unless an object is detected close to the front 
of Model 3, in which case the Park Assist view closes 
automatically when you start driving faster than the speed at 
which Park Assist operates. When reversing, visual feedback 
also displays on the touchscreen (see Rear Facing Camera(s) 
on page 92). You can manually close the park assist view on 
the touchscreen by touching the X.
When driving at low speeds with the Camera app displayed 
on the touchscreen, you can switch to the Park Assist view 
by touching the button located in the upper left corner of the 
Camera app screen. This is useful if you need assistance with 
parallel parking.
If chimes are turned on (see Controlling Audible Feedback on 
page 81), an audible beep sounds as you approach an 
object.
NOTE: If Park Assist is unable to provide feedback, the 
touchscreen displays an alert message.
CAUTION: Keep cameras clean from dirt, debris, snow, 
and ice. Avoid using a high pressure power washer on 
the cameras, and do not clean a camera with a sharp or 
abrasive object that can scratch or damage its surface.
CAUTION: Do not install accessories or stickers on or 
near the cameras.
Controlling Audible Feedback
You can use Park Assist with or without audible feedback. To 
turn chimes on or off, touch Controls > Safety > Park Assist 
Chimes.
Limitations and False Warnings
Park Assist may not function correctly in these situations:
• One or more of the sensors (if equipped) or cameras is 
damaged, dirty, or obstructed (such as by mud, ice, or 
snow, or by a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or adhesive 
products such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.).
• The object is located below approximately 8 inches 
(20 cm) (such as a curb or low barrier).
CAUTION: Shorter objects that are detected (such 
as curbs or low barriers) can move into a blind spot. 
Model 3 cannot alert you about an object while it is 
in a blind spot.
• Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, or fog).
• The object is thin (such as a sign post).

• Park Assist’s operating range has been exceeded.
• The object is sound-absorbing or soft (such as powder 
snow).
• The object is sloped (such as a sloped embankment).
• Model 3 has been parked in, or being driven in, extremely 
hot or cold temperatures.
• The object is located too close to the bumper.
• A bumper is misaligned or damaged.
• An object that is mounted to Model 3 is interfering with 
and/or obstructing Park Assist (such as a bike rack or 
bumper sticker).
• Model 3 rolls freely in the opposite direction you selected 
(for example, Park Assist does not display an alert if 
Model 3 rolls backwards down a hill while in Drive).

Driving


How It Works
The traction control system constantly monitors the speed of 
the front and rear wheels. If Model 3 experiences a loss of 
traction, the system minimizes wheel spin by controlling 
brake pressure and motor power. By default, the traction 
control system is on. Under normal conditions, it should 
remain on to ensure maximum safety.
This yellow indicator flashes on the 
touchscreen whenever the traction control 
system is actively controlling brake pressure 
and motor power to minimize wheel spin. If the 
indicator stays on, a fault is detected with the 
traction control system. Contact Tesla Service.
WARNING: Traction control cannot prevent collisions 
caused by driving dangerously or turning too sharply at 
high speeds.
Allowing Wheel Slip
To allow the wheels to spin at a limited speed, you can enable 
Slip Start. Slip Start can be enabled at any speed, however it 
is less effective at higher speeds.
Under normal conditions, Slip Start should not be enabled. 
Enable it only in circumstances where you deliberately want 
the wheels to spin, such as:
• Starting on a loose surface, such as gravel or snow.
• Driving in deep snow, sand or mud.
• Rocking out of a hole or deep rut.
To allow the wheels to spin, touch Controls > Dynamics > Slip 
Start.
The touchscreen displays an alert message 
when Slip Start is enabled.
Although Slip Start is automatically disabled the next time 
you start Model 3, it is strongly recommended that you 
disable it immediately after the circumstances that required 
you to enable it have passed.
NOTE: Slip Start can not be enabled when you are actively 
using cruise control.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Touch Controls > Dynamics > Acceleration to adjust the 
amount of acceleration you experience when driving Model 
3:
• Chill: Limits acceleration for a smooth and gentle ride.
NOTE: When Chill is selected, Chill displays on the 
touchscreen above the driving speed.
• Standard: Provides the normal level of acceleration.
• Insane: (Performance vehicles) Provides the maximum 
level of acceleration immediately available.
NOTE: Using the increased torque and power available in 
Insane can reduce range and efficiency.
NOTE: Insane strives to keep the Battery within an optimal 
temperature range. In addition to heating the Battery, 
these settings also cool the Battery when necessary (for 
example, while driving at high speeds, during rapid 
acceleration, driving for long periods, etc.).
You can improve the efficiency of the cabin heating by 
reducing your selected acceleration mode. This allows the 
heat pump system to take more heat from the Battery to 
efficiently heat the cabin, instead of maintaining the Battery's 
ability to provide peak acceleration performance. This helps 
to maximize driving efficiency in colder weather. Note that 
when subsequently increasing the acceleration mode, the 
Battery requires time to warm up before the increased level 
of acceleration is available.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Track Mode, available only on Performance Model 3 vehicles, 
is designed to modify the stability control, traction control, 
regenerative braking, and cooling systems to increase 
performance and handling while driving on closed circuit 
courses. Track Mode improves cornering ability by 
intelligently using the motors, and regenerative and 
traditional braking systems. When enabled, the cooling 
system runs at an increased level before, during, and after 
aggressive driving sessions to allow your vehicle’s systems to 
withstand the surplus heat.
NOTE: Track Mode is designed and calibrated for a 
Performance Model 3 equipped with performance brakes and 
tires. Vehicles without performance brakes and tires may 
experience comparatively lower performance and endurance.
WARNING: Track Mode is designed for use on closed 
circuit driving courses only. It is the driver’s 
responsibility to drive safely and ensure others are not 
endangered.
WARNING: Track Mode is designed for use by 
experienced track drivers familiar with the course. Do 
not use on public roads. It is the driver’s responsibility 
to be in control of the vehicle at all times, including on 
the track. Because vehicle behavior (including traction 
and stability control) differs when using Track Mode, 
always use caution.
Using Track Mode
Track Mode is always disabled when you start Model 3. To 
enable Track Mode for your current drive, shift into Park and 
follow these steps:
1. Touch Controls > Dynamics > Track Mode.
When enabled, TRACK displays on the touchscreen above 
the driving speed, and a Track Mode pop up window 
appears on the map. The car status area of the 
touchscreen displays a color-coded image of your Model 
3 that provides you with important at-a-glance status 
information about the Battery, the motors, the tires and 
the brakes. See Monitoring Vehicle Health on page 88.
2. If desired, customize the Track Mode settings by touching 
Track Mode Settings on the Track Mode pop up window 
(see Customizing Track Mode on page 87). You can also 
access the Track Mode settings by touching Controls > 
Dynamics, then touching Customize next to the Track 
Mode setting.
NOTE: For optimum performance, wait for the battery and 
motor temperatures to reduce if highlighted in yellow or 
red.
3. If you want to use the Lap Timer, follow the onscreen 
instructions to drop a pin on the map to define the lap's 
start/finish location. You will then need to press START on 
the Lap Timer to begin your driving session. Once started, 
the Lap Timer starts counting when you drive Model 3 
past the lap's start/finish location where you dropped the 
pin. See Using the Lap Timer on page 88.
4. Shift and GO! 
If you started the Lap Timer, each time you pass the start/
finish location, the timer resets for the next lap. See Using 
the Lap Timer on page 88.
You can also view a real-time accelerometer (G-meter) by 
swiping the Cards area of the touchscreen. See G-Meter 
on page 88.
When Track Mode is on:
◦ Autopilot features are unavailable.
◦ The Slip Start setting is overridden.
◦ Energy usage increases.
◦ Entertainment features are unavailable.
Use the touchscreen setting to turn Track Mode off at any 
time. Powering off Model 3 also turns off Track Mode 
(although it may still appear on the touchscreen if Post-
Drive cooling is in progress). When Track Mode is off, all 
settings return to their previous state and all features 
return to their normal operating state.
CAUTION: Driver assistance features are 
automatically disabled when Track Mode is On. It is 
the driver’s responsibility to drive safely and be in 
control of the vehicle at all times. Driver assistance 
features automatically re-enable when Track Mode 
is turned Off.
Customizing Track Mode
To customize Track Mode, touch Track Mode Settings on the 
Track Mode popup window that appears on the map when 
you enable Track Mode. You can also access the Track Mode 
settings by touching Controls > Dynamics, then touching 
Customize next to the Track Mode setting. Choose an 
existing Track Mode setting from the list of pre-defined 
profiles provided by Tesla. Or create a new settings profile by 
touching Add New Settings, entering a name for the settings 
profile, then adjusting these settings to suit your preferences 
or driving scenario, or customize for a specific track:
• Handling Balance - Drag the slider to customize the 
balance of Model 3 in a turn. If Model 3 is too loose, you 
can choose a front-biased under-steering setup. Difficult 
to get the vehicle through a turn? Try a rear-biased setup 
to increase rotation. You can select any value, in 5% 
increments, between 100/0 (for 100% front biased used 
for under-steering) and 0/100 (for 100% rear biased used 
for over-steering).
• Stability Assist - Choose the level at which the stability 
control systems assist in controlling the vehicle. Stability 
Assist modifies motor torque and selectively applies the 
brakes to each wheel to make the vehicle more stable and 
help the driver maintain control.
WARNING: Drive with caution when customizing 
Stability Assist. If you lose control of Model 3, less 
stability control intervention will be applied and the 
vehicle may not stabilize itself. Use only if you have 
advance experience driving beyond grip limits. 
Track Mode
87
Driving


◦ Reduced: Provides the maximum amount of stability 
control intervention while in track mode. Stability 
control is reduced compared to on-road mode.
◦ Minimal: Provides minimal amount of stability control 
intervention.
◦ Off: Oversteer support is completely disabled and 
traction control is limited to allow wheel spin.
• Regenerative Braking - Drag the slider to choose how 
much regenerative braking is available. You can choose 
any value, in 5% increments, between 0 and 100%. Tesla 
recommends the 100% setting to prevent overheating the 
brakes.
• Post-Drive Cooling - Enable if you want the cooling 
systems to continue cooling the vehicle's components 
even after you leave the vehicle. Cooling stops 
automatically when the components are sufficiently cool, 
or when you power Model 3 off and back on again. Post-
Drive Cooling is useful if you want to quickly cool the 
components between driving sessions. If Post-Drive 
Cooling is set to OFF, the components eventually cool, 
but it takes longer.
• Save Dashcam for Laps - Enable if you want to save a 
video and data on a USB flash drive when using the Lap 
Timer. A USB flash drive must be set up and inserted as 
described (see USB Drive Requirements for Recording 
Videos on page 143). The USB flash drive must contain a 
folder named TeslaTrackMode. When enabled, Track 
Mode stores a video and associated data for each lap. 
Track Mode also stores the car status and telemetry data 
with details about the vehicle's position, speed, 
acceleration, use of accelerator, etc. You can then view 
the video recordings and analyze this data, which is saved 
as a .CSV file on the USB flash drive, to determine where 
time is being lost or gained.
NOTE: For some vehicles manufactured after 
approximately November 1, 2021, the center console USB 
ports may only support charging devices. Use the USB 
port inside the glove box for all other functions.
Track Mode allows you to save up to 20 settings profiles. To 
delete a chosen profile, touch Delete at the bottom of the 
settings screen.
NOTE: You can not change or delete a pre-defined profile 
provided by Tesla.
Using the Lap Timer
When you enable Track Mode, the map displays a Lap Timer. 
Follow the onscreen instructions to place a start/finish pin on 
the map. Once the pins are placed, press START to initiate 
the driving (lapping) session. When you drive Model 3 
through the start/finish location, the Lap Timer automatically 
starts timing the duration of the lap, resetting the timer 
whenever you pass the start/finish location, and displaying 
the real-time delta between the current lap and the fastest 
lap so far in the driving session. The map highlights the track 
in blue.
At the completion of each lap, the Lap Timer displays the 
duration of the lap. It also displays the times associated with 
the previous and best laps in the driving session.
If Save Dashcam for Laps is on (see Customizing Track Mode 
on page 87), and a properly formatted USB flash drive is 
inserted in a front USB port, Track Mode saves a video of the 
driving session (as recorded by the front cameras), along 
with a .CSV file that provides detailed information about the 
lap.
NOTE: To stop the timer at the end of your driving session, 
touch STOP on the Lap Timer popup window.
Monitoring Vehicle Health
You can easily monitor the health of Model 3 when using 
Track Mode by glancing at the car status area of the 
touchscreen. The colors indicate the status of the various 
components, allowing you to determine the current operating 
state and make decisions accordingly. The components are 
displayed in green when operating within their ideal 
temperature range. Colors change as follows:
• The Battery displays blue when cold and red when hot.
• A brake displays blue when cold and red when hot (an 
early warning for overheating brakes).
• A motor displays blue when it's cold or red when it's hot.
• Dynamic readings of the tire pressures displays on the 
touchscreen. A tire displays blue when under-used or red 
when the peak grip is exceeded.
NOTE: A component displayed in red may indicate a need to 
stop driving and allow the component to cool.
CAUTION: Any vehicle damage or injuries caused by 
using Track Mode is the driver's responsibility. The 
vehicle warranty does not cover damage caused by 
excessive overuse of vehicle components. It also does 
not cover racing, autocross, or driving in competition.
G-Meter
In Track Mode, a real-time G-Meter displays on the 
touchscreen. The G-Meter graphically displays peak lateral, 
acceleration, and deceleration values in the form of a circular 
meter. The history of your drive is represented in the shaded 
area. The G-Meter resets at the start of each driving session.
NOTE: You can swipe the G-Meter card to display a different 
card. However, the G-Meter displays as the default card 
whenever you engage Track Mode.

multiple keys to a driver profile, but you cannot link multiple 
driver profiles to a single key.
Easy Entry
You can define an Easy Entry setting that moves the steering 
wheel and driver's seat to make it easy to enter and exit 
Model 3. Any driver can use the Easy Entry setting by 
associating it with their driver profile. When the Easy Entry 
setting is associated with a driver profile, the steering wheel 
and driver's seat automatically adjust when in Park and the 
driver's seat belt is unbuckled, allowing an easy exit from 
(and next entrance into) Model 3. When returning to the 
vehicle and stepping on the brake pedal, settings 
automatically adjust back to the settings used by the most 
recent driver profile (or based on the key if it's linked to a 
driver profile).
To use Easy Entry with a driver profile, ensure the Use Easy 
Entry box is checked.
WARNING: Never use Easy Entry to move the driver's 
seat to the full rearward position when a child safety 
seat is installed on a rear seat located behind the

appointment.
WARNING: Never depend on the cameras to inform you 
if the area behind you is free of objects and/or people. 
The cameras may not detect objects or barriers that 
can potentially cause damage or injury. In addition, 
several external factors can reduce the performance of 
the cameras, including a dirty or obstructed lens. 
Therefore, depending on the cameras to determine if 
Model 3 is approaching an obstruction can result in 
damage to the vehicle and/or objects and can 
potentially cause serious injury. Always inspect the 
area with your own eyes. When reversing, perform 
shoulder checks and use all mirrors. Use the cameras 
for guidance purposes only. It is not intended to 
replace your own direct visual checks and is not a 
substitute for careful driving.
To ensure a clear picture, the camera lens must be clean and 
free of obstructions. See Cleaning on page 190.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


The Pedestrian Warning System causes Model 3 to emit 
sound when driving below approximately 25 mph (40 km/h) 
or while driving in reverse. Electric vehicles operate quietly 
and this sound helps to alert pedestrians of your oncoming 
vehicle. The sound, which activates whenever Model 3 is 
shifted out of Park, gets louder as speed increases.
WARNING: If sound cannot be heard, pedestrians may 
not be aware of your oncoming vehicle, which may 
increase the likelihood of a collision resulting in serious 
injury or death. Never rely on the Pedestrian Warning 
System to make sure that pedestrians are aware of 
your vehicle. If the Pedestrian Warning System is not 
operating, schedule a service appointment.

Autopilot is a suite of advanced driver assistance features that are intended to make driving safer and less stressful. None of 
these features make Model 3 fully autonomous or replace you as the driver. Autopilot features come standard with all new 
Tesla vehicles.
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be 
equipped with the following features, or a feature may not operate exactly as described.
Basic Autopilot includes Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer.
• Traffic-Aware Cruise Control: Maintains your speed and an adjustable following distance from the vehicle in front of you, if 
there is one (see Traffic-Aware Cruise Control on page 98).
• Autosteer: Maintains your speed and distance from a leading vehicle while also intelligently keeping Model 3 in its lane (see 
Autosteer on page 99).
WARNING: Basic Autopilot is a hands-on feature. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times and be mindful of 
road conditions, surrounding traffic, and other road users (such as pedestrians and cyclists). Always be prepared to take 
immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury, or death.
Enhanced Autopilot includes additional features. Enhanced Autopilot Features are designed to further reduce driver workload 
and make common actions, such as changing lanes or parking, easier.
• Auto Lane Change: Moves Model 3 into an adjacent lane when you engage the turn signal and Autosteer is active (see Auto 
Lane Change on page 99).
• Navigate on Autopilot: Actively guides Model 3 from a highway’s on-ramp to off-ramp, including performing lane changes, 
navigating interchanges, automatically engaging the turn signal, and taking the correct exit (see Navigate on Autopilot on 
page 100).
• Autopark: Parks Model 3, either parallel or perpendicularly (see Autopark on page 117).
• Summon: Moves Model 3 forward or backward, even while you’re outside the vehicle. This is useful for parking in tight 
parking spots (see Summon on page 119).
• Smart Summon: Moves Model 3 out of a parking space and through more complex environments, maneuvering around 
obstacles and other vehicles, to meet you or go to a predetermined target (see Smart Summon on page 121).
WARNING: Enhanced Autopilot is a hands-on feature. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times and be mindful 
of road conditions, surrounding traffic, and other road users (such as pedestrians and cyclists). Always be prepared to 
take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death.
Full Self-Driving Capability includes:
• Traffic Light & Stop Sign Control: Maintains your speed, keeps a following distance, and keeps Model 3 in its lane while also 
slowing down and stopping for traffic lights and stop signs (see Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control on page 106).
• Autosteer on City Streets (Full Self-Driving (Supervised)): Attempts to drive to your destination by following curves in the 
road; stopping at and negotiating intersections, stop signs, and roundabouts; making left and right turns; and entering/
exiting highways (see Full Self-Driving (Supervised) on page 113).
WARNING: Full Self-Driving Capability is a hands-on feature. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times and be 
mindful of road conditions, surrounding traffic, and other road users (such as pedestrians and cyclists). Pay attention to 
the road at all times and always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause 
damage, serious injury or death.
Autopilot uses the cameras on Model 3, which monitor the surrounding area and detect other vehicles, pedestrians, road 
markings, and obstacles such as barriers and curbs. There are cameras mounted on the front, rear, left, and right sides of 
Model 3 (see Cameras on page 20).
Model 3 may also be equipped with a cabin camera, mounted in the rear-view mirror, that monitors driver attentiveness. It is 
your responsibility to keep your hands on the wheel, pay attention to the road, and be ready to take immediate action at any 
time.
When Autopilot is engaged, Model 3 shows a series of escalating warnings reminding you to keep your hands on the wheel 
and pay attention to the road. If there is no response, Autopilot disengages and is unavailable for the remainder of the drive.

• Auto Lane Change: When you engage a turn signal while 
Autosteer is active, Auto Lane Change moves Model 3 
into the adjacent lane in the direction indicated by the 
turn signal (see Auto Lane Change on page 99).
• Navigate on Autopilot: Navigate on Autopilot builds on the 
features of Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer. 
While Autosteer is active, Navigate on Autopilot allows 
Model 3 to suggest and, if configured, automatically 
change lanes to pass other vehicles and follow the 
navigation route (see Navigate on Autopilot on page 100).
NOTE: Navigate on Autopilot is a BETA feature.
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer use information 
from the cameras on Model 3 to detect lane markings, road 
edges, and other vehicles and road users around Model 3.
CAUTION: Ensure all cameras are clean and free of 
obstructions before each drive and before using 
Autopilot features (see Cleaning a Camera on page 
190). Dirty cameras and sensors (if equipped), as well 
as environmental conditions such as rain and faded 
lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. If a 
camera is obstructed or blinded, Model 3 displays a 
message on the touchscreen and Autopilot features 
may not be available. For more information on specific 
alerts, see Troubleshooting Alerts on page 224. 
CAUTION: It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself 
with the limitations of Autopilot and the situations in 
which driver intervention may be needed. For more 
information, see Limitations and Warnings on page 
123.
Autopilot Settings
Before you use Autopilot features, customize how they work 
by touching Controls > Autopilot.
• Set Speed: Choose whether Autopilot engages at the 
currently detected speed limit or your current driving 
speed. Touch Controls > Autopilot > Set Speed and 
choose either Speed Limit or Current Speed.
• Offset: If you choose Speed Limit, you can specify an 
offset by touching Set Speed Offset. You can choose 
Fixed (the cruising speed adjusts by a specific amount on 
all roads) or Percentage (the cruising speed is adjusted as 
a percentage of the road's detected speed limit).
• Autopilot Activation: Choose how to activate Autosteer. If 
set to Single Click, both Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and 
Autosteer engage when you single-press the right scroll 
wheel. If set to Double Click, you must double-press the 
right scroll wheel to engage Autosteer.
NOTE: Autopilot Activation must be set to Double Click if 
you want to use Traffic-Aware Cruise Control 
independently of Autosteer.
• Green Traffic Light Chime: In Canada and U.S.: If on, a 
chime will sound when you are waiting at a red traffic light 
and the light turns green. If you are not actively using 
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and are waiting at a red light 
with a car in front of you, the chime sounds when the car 
ahead of you advances.
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is always enabled.
When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is available 
but not engaged, the touchscreen displays the 
cruising speed in gray. The number shown 
represents the speed that will be set when you 
engage Traffic-Aware Cruise Control.
When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is actively 
cruising at a set speed, the speed is 
highlighted with blue text.
To engage Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, press the right 
scroll wheel, then release the accelerator pedal to allow 
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to maintain the cruising speed. 
A chime sounds to indicate that Traffic-Aware Cruise Control 
is now active. You can apply the accelerator at any time to 
temporarily override the set cruising speed.
NOTE: If Autopilot Activation is set to Single Click, pressing 
the right scroll wheel once also activates Autosteer (which 
includes Traffic-Aware Cruise Control). Touch Controls > 
Autopilot > Autopilot Activation and choose Double Click to 
use Traffic-Aware Cruise Control independently of Autosteer 
when you single-press the right scroll wheel.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


WARNING: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is designed 
for your driving comfort and convenience and is not a 
collision warning or avoidance system. It is your 
responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in 
control of the vehicle at all times. Never depend on 
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to adequately slow down 
Model 3. Always watch the road in front of you and be 
prepared to take corrective action at all times. Failure 
to do so can result in serious injury or death. For more 
information, see Limitations and Warnings on page 
123.
Autosteer
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, 
options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may 
not be equipped with Autosteer, or the feature may not 
operate exactly as described.
To enable Autosteer:
1. Touch Controls > Autopilot > Autopilot Features > 
Autosteer (Beta).
2. After carefully reading and understanding the popup 
window, touch Yes.
To indicate that Autosteer is available (but not 
actively steering Model 3), the top corner of 
the touchscreen displays a gray Autosteer icon 
next to the driving gear. In situations where 
Autosteer is temporarily unavailable, the 
Autosteer icon disappears. (For example, if 
your driving speed is not within the speed 
required for Autosteer to operate.)
To initiate Autosteer, press the right scroll wheel.
NOTE: If the setting for Autopilot Activation is set to Double 
Click, you must double-press the right scroll wheel to engage 
Autosteer (see Autopilot Settings on page 98).
Autosteer confirms activation with an audible chime and 
briefly displays a message on the touchscreen reminding you 
to pay attention to the road and be ready to take over at any 
time.
To indicate that Autosteer is now active, the 
touchscreen displays the Autosteer icon in 
blue.
When Autosteer is able to detect lane markings, it displays 
the edges of the driving lane in blue on the touchscreen.
Whenever Autosteer is active, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control 
is active as well.
In situations where the speed limit cannot be detected when 
Autosteer is engaged, Autosteer reduces your driving speed 
and limits the set cruising speed to 45 mph (70 km/h). 
Although you can manually accelerate to exceed the limited 
speed, Model 3 will not brake for detected obstacles as long 
as you are applying the accelerator pedal. Autosteer slows 
down to the limited speed when you release the accelerator 
pedal. When you leave the road or disengage Autosteer by 
using the steering wheel, you can increase your set speed 
again, if desired.
WARNING: Autosteer is a hands-on assistance feature. 
Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times, be 
mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, and 
always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to 
follow these instructions could cause damage, serious 
injury or death. It is your responsibility to familiarize 
yourself with the limitations of Autosteer and the 
situations in which it may not work as expected. For 
more information, see Limitations and Warnings on 
page 123.
Auto Lane Change
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, 
options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may 
not be equipped with Auto Lane Change, or the feature may 
not operate exactly as described.
If you engage a turn signal while Autosteer is active, Model 3 
moves into the adjacent lane in the direction indicated by the 
turn signal, provided the following conditions are met:
• The turn signal is engaged.
• Lane markings indicate that a lane change is permitted.
• Midway through the lane change, Model 3 must detect 
the target lane's outside lane marking. If this lane marking 
is not detected, the lane change is aborted and Model 3 
returns to its original driving lane.
• The view of the camera(s) is not obstructed.
• Model 3 does not detect a vehicle in its blind spot, or a 
vehicle or obstacle up to the center of the target lane. If a 
vehicle or other obstacle is detected in the target lane, it 
is shown in red in the visualization on the touchscreen and 
Model 3 does not complete the lane change until it is safe 
to do so.
WARNING: Although Autopilot is designed to detect 
vehicles and obstacles in adjacent lanes, it is your 
responsibility to always perform visual checks to make 
sure it is safe and appropriate to move into the target 
lane. If Autopilot cannot change lanes due to 
inadequate data, the touchscreen displays a series of 
warnings. Therefore, when using Auto Lane Change, 
always pay attention to the touchscreen and be 
prepared to manually steer Model 3.
The minimum speed at which Autopilot changes lanes may 
vary depending on region, adjacent lane speeds, and other 
factors. Always be ready to manually steer and change lanes 
as necessary. When an automatic lane change is in progress, 
Overtake Acceleration is activated, allowing Model 3 to 
accelerate closer to a vehicle in front (see Overtake 
Acceleration on page 103).
Autopilot Features
99
Autopilot


When you engage a turn signal, Autopilot moves Model 3 one 
lane at a time. Moving into an additional lane requires you to 
engage the turn signal a second time after the first lane 
change is complete.
As Model 3 changes lanes, it is important to monitor its 
performance by watching the driving path in front of you and 
the surrounding area. Stay prepared to take over steering at 
any time. As you are crossing over into the adjacent lane, the 
touchscreen displays the location in the lane that Model 3 is 
moving into.
Navigate on Autopilot
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, 
options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may 
not be equipped with Navigate on Autopilot, or the feature 
may not operate exactly as described.
To enable Navigate on Autopilot, touch Controls > Autopilot > 
Navigate on Autopilot (Beta). Then, to customize how you 
want Navigate on Autopilot to operate, touch Customize 
Navigate on Autopilot:
• Enable at Start of Every Trip: Choose whether to 
automatically enable Navigate on Autopilot for every 
navigation route. When enabled, the Navigate on 
Autopilot button on the turn-by-turn direction list is 
already enabled at the start of every trip.
• Speed Based Lane Changes: Navigate on Autopilot is 
designed to perform both route-based and speed-based 
lane changes. Speed-based lanes changes are optional. 
You can use this setting to disable speed-based lane 
changes or to specify how assertively you want Navigate 
on Autopilot to change lanes to achieve the set cruising 
speed (Mild, Average, or Mad Max).
• Exit Passing Lane: Choose whether you want Navigate on 
Autopilot to maneuver out of a passing lane when 
navigating to a destination. In addition to route-based and 
speed-based lane changes, Navigate on Autopilot 
requests a lane change out of a passing lane as a reminder 
to stay in a slower lane when you are not passing other 
vehicles. Choose No to disable this and keep Model 3 in a 
passing lane except when needed to stay on the 
navigation route.
• Require Lane Change Confirmation: (if equipped) By 
default, Navigate on Autopilot requires your confirmation 
before proceeding with a lane change by engaging the 
appropriate turn signal. If you do not confirm the lane 
change within 3 seconds, a chime sounds to remind you 
that Navigate on Autopilot requires your confirmation to 
change lanes.
• Lane Change Notification: You can specify if or how you 
want to be notified of lane changes (Off, Chime, Vibrate, 
or Both).
If Enable at Start of Every Trip is turned on, Navigate on 
Autopilot engages automatically when:
• Autosteer is active.
• You are navigating to a destination.
• You are on a controlled-access highway.
Once enabled, the Navigate on Autopilot button appears on 
the map’s turn-by-turn direction list whenever a navigation 
route is active and the route includes at least one controlled-
access highway.
If Enable at Start of Every Trip is turned off, touch the 
Navigate on Autopilot button above the turn-by-turn 
directions to enable it. Once the Navigate on Autopilot is 
selected, it will engage whenever you engage Autosteer.
The Navigate on Autopilot icon shows in the 
turn-by-turn direction list when you are 
navigating to a destination and Navigate on 
Autopilot is available but not active.
If Navigate on Autopilot is active, the icon is 
blue. If Enable at Start of Every Trip is turned 
on, the Navigate on Autopilot icon is selected 
whenever you start navigation. Touch the icon 
to cancel Navigate on Autopilot and revert to 
Autosteer.
Whenever Navigate on Autopilot is active, the Navigate on 
Autopilot button is blue and the touchscreen displays the 
driving lane as a single blue line in front of Model 3:
Autopilot Features
100
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


The turn-by-turn directions display the Autosteer icon next 
to the maneuvers (such as off-ramps) that Navigate on 
Autopilot will handle.
When Navigate on Autopilot is engaged Model 3 
automatically makes both speed-based and route-based lane 
changes.
• Speed Based Lane Changes: Navigate on Autopilot 
changes lanes to reduce driving time to your destination. 
For example, if Model 3 is behind a vehicle going below 
the set cruising speed, Navigate on Autopilot will move 
into the passing lane to pass it. Speed-based lanes 
changes are optional.
• Route Based Lane Changes: Navigate on Autopilot 
changes lanes to route you to your destination. For 
example, Navigate on Autopilot will move into the exit lane 
as Model 3 approaches the off-ramp specified by the 
navigation route.
If you ignore a route-based lane change suggestion (for 
example, you are driving in the left lane while approaching an 
off-ramp on the right side of the highway), Navigate on 
Autopilot is unable to maneuver onto the off-ramp and as a 
result, you are re-routed to your destination.
NOTE: When determining navigation routes, and maneuvers 
at interchanges, Navigate on Autopilot considers whether or 
not you want to use High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes. 
Therefore, ensure the Use HOV Lanes setting is appropriate 
for your circumstances (see Maps and Navigation on page 
155). If the setting is off, Navigate on Autopilot never uses a 
HOV lane, regardless of time of day. If the setting is on, 
Navigate on Autopilot uses HOV lanes, whenever applicable.
CAUTION: Navigate on Autopilot may not always 
attempt to exit at an off-ramp or change lanes, even 
when an exit or lane change is determined by the 
navigation route. Always remain alert and be prepared 
to manually steer onto an off-ramp, or make a lane 
change to prepare for, or to exit at, an off-ramp or 
interchange.
Navigate on Autopilot activates and deactivates based on the 
type of road you are driving on. When Navigate on Autopilot 
is active and you approach an off-ramp or interchange along 
your navigation route, the appropriate turn signal engages 
and Autosteer maneuvers Model 3 onto the off-ramp or 
interchange.
When you leave a controlled-access highway Navigate on 
Autopilot reverts to Autosteer—a chime sounds and the 
touchscreen displays the driving lane lines in blue (instead of 
the single blue in front of Model 3). When Navigate on 
Autopilot deactivates, Autosteer remains active. Always be 
prepared to take appropriate action.
WARNING: Navigate on Autopilot is a hands-on 
feature. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all 
times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding 
traffic, and always be prepared to take immediate 
action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause 
damage, serious injury or death. It is your responsibility 
to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Navigate 
on Autopilot and the situations in which it may not work 
as expected. For more information, see Limitations and 
Warnings on page 123.
Canceling Autopilot
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cancels when:
• You press the right scroll wheel on the steering wheel.
• You press the brake pedal.
• You exceed 90 mph (150 km/h).
• You shift into Reverse, Park, or Neutral.
• A door is opened.
• An Automatic Emergency Braking event occurs (see 
Collision Avoidance Assist on page 132).
• The driver's seatbelt is released, and/or the driver gets 
out of their seat.
When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cancels, the cruising 
speed icon on the touchscreen turns gray to indicate that 
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is no longer active.
Autosteer cancels when any of the above actions are taken. 
In addition, Autosteer cancels when:
• You exceed 85 mph (140 km/h).
• You take over steering manually.
WARNING: If Autopilot Activation is set to Double 
Click and Autosteer cancels because you started 
steering manually, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control 
remains active. If Autopilot Activation is set to 
Single Click and Autosteer cancels because you 
started steering manually, Traffic-Aware Cruise 
Control also cancels.
• You do not respond to repeated reminders to keep your 
hands on the wheel and subsequent messages on the 
touchscreen (see Driver Attentiveness on page 104).
Autopilot Features
101
Autopilot


When Autosteer cancels, a chime sounds and the Autosteer 
icon either turns gray to indicate that Autosteer is no longer 
active, or disappears to indicate that it is not currently 
available.
Navigate on Autopilot cancels when Autosteer cancels, as 
described above. In addition, Navigate on Autopilot cancels 
when:
• You touch the Navigate on Autopilot button on the map’s 
turn-by-turn direction list. In this case, Autosteer is still 
active.
• You leave a controlled-access highway. When this 
happens, Autosteer is still active.
When Navigate on Autopilot cancels but Autosteer remains 
active, a chime sounds and the visualization goes from a 
single blue line in the driving lane to two blue lines on either 
side of the lane.
When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or Autosteer cancels, 
Model 3 does not coast. Instead, regenerative braking slows 
down Model 3 in the same way as when you move your foot 
off the accelerator when driving without Traffic-Aware Cruise 
Control (see Regenerative Braking on page 78).
While Using Autopilot
When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is active and Autopilot is 
maintaining a set speed, the speed is highlighted with blue 
text on the touchscreen.
When Autosteer is active, the steering wheel icon is blue and 
the lane markings are highlighted in blue on the visualization. 
If Navigate on Autopilot is also active, the Navigate on 
Autopilot button is blue and the touchscreen displays the 
driving lane as a single blue line in front of Model 3.
To display more details about the roadway and its 
surroundings, such as road markings, stop lights, and objects 
(such as trash cans and poles), touch Controls > Autopilot > 
Full Self-Driving Visualization Preview.
If unable to detect lane markings, Autosteer may determine 
the driving lane based on a vehicle you are following. In most 
cases, Autosteer attempts to center Model 3 in the driving 
lane. However, there may be situations in which Autosteer 
follows a driving path that is offset from the center of the 
lane (for example, if guard rails are detected).
Maintaining the Set Speed
When Autopilot is active, Model 3 maintains your set cruising 
speed whenever a vehicle is not detected in front of it. When 
cruising behind a vehicle, Model 3 accelerates and 
decelerates as needed to maintain a chosen following 
distance (see Adjusting the Following Distance on page 
102), up to the set speed.
You can manually accelerate at any time by pressing the 
accelerator pedal, but when you release the pedal Model 3 
resumes cruising at the set speed.
Model 3 also adjusts the cruising speed when entering and 
exiting curves.
When Model 3 is actively slowing down to maintain the 
selected distance from the vehicle ahead, brake lights turn 
on. You may notice slight movement of the brake pedal. 
However, when Model 3 is accelerating, the accelerator pedal 
does not move.
Changing the Set Speed
Roll the right scroll wheel up to increase, or down to 
decrease, the set speed.
It may take a few seconds for Model 3 to reach the new 
cruising speed.
Adjusting the Following Distance
To adjust the following distance you want to maintain 
between Model 3 and a vehicle traveling ahead of you, press 
the steering wheel's right scroll button to the left or right.
NOTE: If Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is active, pressing the 
steering wheel's right scroll button to the left or right 
changes the Full Self-Driving (Supervised) profile (see Full 
Self-Driving (Supervised) on page 113).
The closest following distance is 2.
Each setting corresponds to a time-based distance that 
represents how long it takes for Model 3, from its current 
location, to reach the location of the rear bumper of the 
vehicle ahead of you. Autopilot retains your setting until you 
change it again.
As you adjust the following distance, the touchscreen 
displays the current setting.
Autopilot Features
102
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Stopping and Slowdowns
When moving significantly faster than vehicles in adjacent 
lanes, Model 3 automatically reduces the driving speed. This 
is especially helpful in heavy traffic situations or when 
vehicles are constantly merging into different lanes. When 
Model 3 detects other vehicles driving significantly slower, 
the touchscreen highlights the adjacent lanes with arrows 
and detected vehicles in gray, and Model 3 reduces the 
driving speed as appropriate. To temporarily override this 
feature, press the accelerator pedal.
When following a vehicle, Autopilot remains active at low 
speeds, even when Model 3 comes to a full stop. For 
example, Autopilot remains active even if Model 3 slows 
down to a complete or near-complete stop in heavy, stop-
and-go traffic on a highway. When traffic starts moving more 
rapidly, Autopilot again accelerates up to the set speed.
Sometimes when Model 3 is at a full stop, Autopilot goes into 
a HOLD state. If this happens, briefly press the accelerator 
pedal to resume cruising.
When the HOLD status is active, the 
touchscreen displays the HOLD icon and a 
message that indicates that you need to 
resume cruise control.
Model 3 goes into HOLD state while Autopilot is active in the 
following circumstances:
• Model 3 has been at a standstill for 5 minutes.
• Model 3 detects a pedestrian (the HOLD state may clear 
when the pedestrian is no longer detected).
• Model 3 suddenly loses visibility of the vehicle in front of 
you.
• An obstacle is detected in front of Model 3.
Cruising Near or On Exits
When you are cruising near an exit on a controlled-access 
highway and engage the turn signal toward the off-ramp, 
Autopilot assumes you are exiting and begins to slow down 
Model 3. If you do not drive onto the off-ramp, Autopilot 
resumes cruising at the set speed.
In a region with right hand traffic, this occurs only when you 
engage the right turn signal when driving in the right-most 
lane within 164 ft. (50 meters) of an exit. Likewise in regions 
with left hand traffic, this occurs when engaging the left turn 
signal when driving in the left-most lane within 164 ft. (50 
meters) of an exit.
NOTE: If Navigate on Autopilot is active, Model 3 will perform 
a route-based lane change to enter the exit lane and take the 
off-ramp as necessary to follow the navigation route.
When enabled while on a highway interchange or off-ramp, 
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may reduce your set speed in 
5 mph (5 km/h) increments – to as slow as 25 mph (40 km/h) 
– to better match the reported speeds of other Tesla vehicles 
that have driven at that specific location. To override this and 
continue cruising at your set speed, tap the accelerator 
pedal. The new set speed is maintained for the duration of 
the interchange or off-ramp (unless you override it or cancel 
Autopilot). After the interchange or off-ramp, the set speed 
may revert or change as necessary based on the new 
location. For example, if you merged onto a different 
highway, the set cruising speed reverts to what it was before 
driving on the interchange.
WARNING: In some cases (such as having insufficient 
data), Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may not 
automatically reduce the set speed on the highway 
interchange or off-ramp. Do not rely on Traffic-Aware 
Cruise Control to determine an appropriate driving 
speed. Tesla recommends driving at a speed that is 
safe for road conditions and within posted speed 
limits.
When cruising onto an on-ramp to a controlled-access 
highway, Autopilot automatically adjusts the set cruising 
speed to the speed limit of the highway, plus any offset you 
have specified. If Navigate on Autopilot is engaged, it 
disengages as you leave the controlled-access highway (see 
Canceling Autopilot on page 101). In this case, Autosteer 
remains active.
Overtake Acceleration
Engage the turn signal momentarily to accelerate Model 3 
towards the vehicle ahead of it. By momentarily holding the 
turn signal, you can quickly accelerate up to your set speed 
without having to press the accelerator pedal as long as:
• Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is operating and detects a 
vehicle in front of you.
• No obstacles or vehicles are detected in the target lane.
• Model 3 is traveling below the set speed, but over 45 mph 
(72 km/h).
Autopilot Features
103
Autopilot


NOTE: If Autosteer is active and you fully engage the turn 
signal, Model 3 will change lanes automatically (see Auto 
Lane Change on page 99).
Model 3 stops accelerating when you reach your set cruising 
speed, if changing lanes takes too long, or if Model 3 gets 
too close the vehicle ahead. Model 3 also stops accelerating 
if you disengage the turn signal.
Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning
While Autopilot is in use, Model 3 displays a warning on the 
touchscreen and sounds a chime if it detects that you are 
likely to run through a red stop light or stop sign. If this 
happens, TAKE IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION!
The visual and audible warnings cancel after a few seconds 
or when you press the brake pedal, whichever comes first.
Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning provides warnings only. It 
does not slow down or stop Model 3 at red traffic lights, stop 
signs, road markings, etc. If equipped with Traffic Light and 
Stop Sign Control, you can enable this feature to 
automatically stop Model 3 at traffic lights and stop signs 
(see Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control on page 106).
Emergency Vehicles
If available in your market region, Model 3 automatically 
reduces driving speed when lights from an emergency 
vehicle are detected when using Autosteer at night on a high 
speed road. When this happens, the touchscreen displays a 
message informing you of the slowdown. You will also hear a 
chime, and see a reminder to keep your hands on the steering 
wheel. When the light detections pass by or cease to appear, 
Autopilot resumes your cruising speed. Alternatively, you 
may tap the accelerator to resume your cruising speed.
Never depend on Autopilot features to determine the 
presence of emergency vehicles. Model 3 may not detect 
lights from emergency vehicles. Keep your eyes on your 
driving path and always be prepared to take immediate 
action.
Driver Attentiveness
Autosteer determines how best to steer Model 3. When 
active, Autosteer requires you to hold the steering wheel. If it 
does not detect your hands on the steering wheel for a 
period of time, a flashing blue light appears at the top of the 
vehicle status section of the touchscreen and the following 
message displays:
Apply slight turning force to steering wheel
When your hands are detected, the message disappears and 
Autosteer resumes normal operation. Autosteer detects your 
hands by recognizing slight resistance as the steering wheel 
turns, or from you manually turning the steering wheel very 
lightly (without enough force to take over steering). 
Autosteer also qualifies your hands as being detected if you 
engage a turn signal or use a button or scroll wheel on the 
steering wheel.
Autosteer requires that you pay attention to your 
surroundings and remain prepared to take control at any 
time. If Autosteer still does not detect your hands on the 
steering wheel, the flashing light on the vehicle status 
section of the touchscreen increases in frequency and a 
chime sounds.
If you repeatedly ignore Autosteer's prompts to apply slight 
force to the steering wheel, Autosteer disables for the rest of 
the drive and displays the following message requesting you 
to drive manually.
Autopilot unavailable for current drive. 
Autopilot Strikeout - Attention warnings 
ignored.
For the rest of the drive, you must steer manually. Autosteer 
is available again on your next drive (after you stop and shift 
Model 3 into Park).
If you don't resume manual steering, Autosteer sounds a 
continuous chime, turns on the warning flashers, and slows 
the vehicle to a complete stop.
Autopilot Suspension
Use of Autopilot features will be suspended if improper 
usage is detected.
Use of Autosteer and Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is 
suspended for a week when you or another driver of your 
vehicle receives five Autopilot "strikeouts." A strikeout is 
when the Autopilot system disengages for the remainder of a 
trip after the driver receives several audio and visual 
warnings for inattentiveness.
You can see how many strikeouts are remaining before 
Autopilot access is suspended by touching Controls > 
Autopilot.
A strikeout is forgiven after 7 days, as long as you don't 
receive another strikeout in that time.
NOTE: If your access to Autosteer and Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) is suspended, you also lose access to Autopark. 
However, you can still use Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and 
all active safety features are still enabled.
There may be occasions where driver intervention is required 
and you must take over immediately to maintain safe driving. 
Driver-initiated disengagements do not count as improper 
usage and are expected from the driver.

Take over immediately
When you see this message, TAKE OVER STEERING 
IMMEDIATELY.
Autopilot Features
105
Autopilot


NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, 
options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may 
not be equipped with Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control, or 
the feature may not operate exactly as described.
NOTE: Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is a BETA feature 
and works best on roads that are frequently driven by Tesla 
vehicles. Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control attempts to stop 
at all traffic lights and may also stop at green lights.
Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is designed to recognize 
and respond to traffic lights and stop signs, slowing Model 3 
to a stop when using Traffic-Aware cruise control or 
Autosteer. This feature uses the vehicle's forward-facing 
cameras, in addition to GPS data, and slows the car for all 
detected traffic lights, including green, blinking yellow, and 
off lights in addition to stop signs and some road markings. 
As Model 3 approaches an intersection, the touchscreen 
displays a notification indicating the intention to slow down. 
You must confirm that you want to continue or Model 3 stops 
at the red line displayed on the touchscreen's driving 
visualization.
WARNING: NEVER make assumptions and predict when 
and where Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control will stop 
or continue through an intersection or road marking. 
From a driver's perspective, the behavior of Traffic 
Light and Stop Sign Control may appear inconsistent. 
Always pay attention to the roadway and be prepared 
to take immediate action. It is the driver's responsibility 
to determine whether to stop or continue through an 
intersection. Never depend on Traffic Light and Stop 
Sign Control to determine when it is safe and/or 
appropriate to stop or continue through an 
intersection.
Before Using
Before using Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control, you must:
• Ensure that forward-facing cameras are unobstructed 
(see Cleaning a Camera on page 190) and calibrated (see 
Drive to Calibrate Cameras on page 20). Traffic Light and 
Stop Sign Control depends on the ability of the cameras 
to detect traffic lights, stop signs, and road markings.
• Ensure that the latest version of maps has been 
downloaded to Model 3. Although Traffic Light and Stop 
Sign Control primarily uses visual data received from the 
vehicle's cameras, greater accuracy is achieved when 
using the most recent map data. To check which version 
of maps is currently downloaded, touch Controls > 
Software. You must connect to a Wi-Fi network to receive 
updated maps (see Map Updates on page 160).
• Enable the feature. With the vehicle in Park, touch 
Controls > Autopilot > Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control. 
Once enabled, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control 
operates whenever Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or 
Autosteer is active.
How it Works
When Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is enabled and you 
are using Autosteer, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, or Full 
Self-Driving (Supervised), the touchscreen displays a popup 
message to inform you that an upcoming traffic light, stop 
sign, or road marking has been detected. As it approaches 
the stop location, even at an intersection where the traffic 
light is green, Model 3 slows down and displays a red line to 
indicate where Model 3 will stop. To continue through the 
intersection—even if the traffic light is green —you must 
briefly press the accelerator pedal to give the vehicle 
permission to proceed. When you've confirmed that you want 
to proceed, the red stop line turns gray and Model 3 
continues through the intersection and resumes your set 
cruising speed.
NOTE: If Model 3 is approaching a green light and detects 
that a vehicle in front of you is continuing through the 
intersection, Model 3 continues through the intersection 
without requiring your confirmation, provided you are not in a 
turning lane and the vehicle can detect that your hands are 
on the steering wheel.
NOTE: If, after you briefly press the accelerator pedal to 
confirm that you want to continue through the intersection, 
the traffic signal changes before you enter the intersection 
(for example, the light changes from green to yellow or from 
yellow to red), Model 3 may determine that it is not 
appropriate to proceed. Therefore, Model 3 stops and you 
must press the accelerator to proceed. At all times, it is your 
responsibility to ensure the vehicle stops or accelerates 
appropriately and safely.
WARNING: Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control DOES 
NOT turn Model 3 through an intersection unless Full 
Self-Driving (Supervised) is engaged. When in a 
turning lane, Model 3 stops at the red stop line. To 
proceed, briefly press the accelerator pedal—Model 3 
continues straight through the intersection (even when 
in a turning lane), so you MUST manually steer Model 3 
through the intersection (which cancels Autosteer).
Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is designed to operate as 
described only when the following conditions are met:
• Autosteer, Full Self-Driving (Supervised), or Traffic-
Aware Cruise Control is engaged.
• The cameras can detect an upcoming traffic light, stop 
sign or road marking (for example, cameras are 
unobstructed and have a clear line-of-sight to the traffic 
light, stop sign, or road marking).
• The touchscreen on Model 3 is displaying an upcoming 
traffic light in "bold" format. Model 3 does not 
acknowledge traffic lights that the touchscreen shows as 
faded. If a traffic light is not directly ahead of the camera 
(for example, it is located at an angle of the camera's view, 
or located in an adjacent lane) the touchscreen displays it 
as faded and Model 3 does not slow down and stop for it.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


WARNING: If the touchscreen is not displaying a red 
stop line at an upcoming intersection, Model 3 does 
not slow down or stop. It is the driver's responsibility to 
pay attention to upcoming intersections and monitor 
traffic conditions to determine when and if the vehicle 
should stop and then to take appropriate action as 
needed.
WARNING: Never depend on Traffic Light and Stop 
Sign Control to determine whether to stop at, or 
proceed through, an intersection. Drive attentively by 
watching the road and paying attention to the roadway, 
upcoming intersections, traffic conditions, crosswalks, 
and other road users. It is always the driver's 
responsibility to determine whether to stop or proceed. 
Be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to do so 
can result in injury or death.
WARNING: In some situations, Traffic Light and Stop 
Sign Control may inaccurately detect a traffic light or 
stop sign, causing Model 3 to slow down unexpectedly. 
Be prepared to take immediate action at all times.
WARNING: You must briefly press the accelerator 
pedal to confirm that you want to proceed through an 
intersection, regardless of the status of the traffic 
light. If you do not confirm, Model 3 stops at the red 
stop line displayed on the touchscreen, even if 
stopping may be inappropriate. Stopping at a green 
light may confuse other drivers and may result in a 
collision, injury or death. Therefore, always pay 
attention to upcoming intersections and be prepared to 
manually brake or accelerate in response to 
surroundings.
WARNING: Never assume that your ability to see a 
traffic light, stop sign, or road marking (especially at a 
complex intersection, or an intersection in which a 
traffic light or sign is partially obstructed, etc.) means 
that Model 3 can also see it and respond appropriately.
WARNING: Even the most recent map data does not 
include all traffic lights and stop signs. Therefore, 
Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control relies heavily on the 
ability of the cameras to detect traffic lights, stop 
signs, road markings, etc. As a result, Model 3 may 
ignore an intersection that is blocked from the 
camera's view (for example, obstructed by a tree or a 
large vehicle or object, or located near a steep hill or 
sharp curve).
WARNING: Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is not a 
substitute for attentive driving and sound judgment.

Traffic Lights
When driving with Autosteer or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control engaged, and Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control enabled, 
Model 3 is designed to respond as follows when approaching intersections controlled by a traffic light:
Type of Traffic Light
Vehicle Intended Response
At a solid green traffic light, or at a traffic light that is currently off (not illuminated), 
Model 3 slows down.
If you are following a car in front of you that continues through the intersection, the 
touchscreen displays a green stop line and provided your hands are detected on the 
steering wheel, Model 3 also continues. If a car is not in front of you, the touchscreen 
displays a red stop line and you must confirm that you want to continue through the 
intersection by briefly pressing the accelerator pedal. If you don’t confirm, Model 3 stops 
at the red stop line.
NOTE: Model 3 resumes the set cruising speed when it continues through the 
intersection, taking into consideration the speed of a vehicle in front of you.
Model 3 slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the 
touchscreen. When you want to continue through the intersection (for example, the light 
turns green again, or once Model 3 has come to a complete stop), you must briefly press 
the accelerator pedal.
Model 3 slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the 
touchscreen. When you want to proceed through the intersection (for example, the light 
turns green again), you must briefly press the accelerator pedal.
NOTE: If the traffic light changes after you've confirmed that you want to proceed (for 
example, a green traffic light turns yellow), Model 3 may stop instead of continuing, 
especially if Model 3 determines that it can safely stop before entering the intersection.
NOTE: Model 3 is not designed to proceed through an intersection when the traffic light is 
red or if the light turns yellow in situations when there is adequate distance to safely stop 
before entering the intersection.
NOTE: You can take over driving at any time by manually braking to cancel Autosteer or 
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control.

Type of Traffic Light
Vehicle Intended Response
Model 3 slows down. To proceed, you must briefly press the accelerator pedal. If you 
don’t, Model 3 stops at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen.
NOTE: To prevent Model 3 from stopping, and to minimize how much it slows down as it 
approaches, you can confirm that you want to proceed by briefly pressing the accelerator 
pedal at any time after the touchscreen displays the red stop line. Model 3 resumes your 
set cruising speed immediately after you confirm (taking into consideration the speed of a 
vehicle in front of you).
WARNING: Approach attentively and be prepared to press the brake pedal to slow 
down or stop.
Model 3 slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the 
touchscreen. When you want to proceed through the intersection (for example, traffic 
laws and conditions indicate it is safe and legal to proceed), you must briefly press the 
accelerator pedal.

Stop Signs and Road Markings
When driving with Autosteer or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control engaged, and Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control enabled, 
Model 3 is designed to respond as follows when approaching intersections controlled by stop signs, stop lines, or road 
markings:
Type of Intersection
Vehicle Intended Response
No Traffic Control
Arm of T-junction
Model 3 assumes the right of way and continues straight without slowing down or stopping.
End of T-junction
If Model 3 detects a T-junction based on the map data, Model 3 slows down and comes to a 
complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen. When you want to proceed, 
you must take over steering and acceleration.
WARNING: Model 3 may not stop at a T-junction that does not have a stop sign or stop 
line, or if the T-junction is not included in the map data. Drive attentively and be 
prepared to stop (when necessary and/or appropriate).
Stop Sign
Model 3 slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the 
touchscreen. When you want to proceed through the intersection, you must briefly press the 
accelerator pedal.
NOTE: If you confirm that you want to proceed through an intersection controlled by a stop 
sign by briefly pressing the accelerator pedal before Model 3 has stopped, your confirmation 
is ignored. Model 3 is not designed to proceed through a stop sign without stopping.
NOTE: Even when using Autosteer, and even if you have engaged a turn signal, you must turn 
the steering wheel yourself (which cancels Autosteer) to complete a turn at an intersection.

WARNING: Model 3 also slows down and stops at a roundabout. You must take over steering (which cancels Autosteer) 
and briefly press the accelerator pedal to confirm that you want to continue through the roundabout.
WARNING: At crosswalks, Model 3 may slow down and may stop, depending on whether the crosswalk is controlled by a 
traffic light and whether the cameras detect pedestrians, bicyclists, etc. in the crosswalk. Pay particular attention at 
crosswalks and be prepared to take over at any time. Failure to do so can result in injury or death.
Limitations
Depending on many different circumstances and environmental conditions, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control may or may not 
stop at:
• Railroad crossings.
• Keep-out zones.
• Toll booths.
• Crosswalk systems.
• Yield signs or temporary traffic lights and stop signs (such as at construction areas).
• Miscellaneous traffic U-turn lights, bicycle and pedestrian crossing lights, lane availability lights, etc.
In addition, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is particularly unlikely to operate as intended, can disengage, or may not 
operate, when one or more of the following conditions are present:
• Driving through consecutive light-controlled intersections that are very close to each other.
• Visibility is poor (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions are interfering with camera or sensor operation.
• Bright light (such as direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of the camera(s).
• A camera is obstructed, covered, damaged, or not properly calibrated.

• Driving on a hill or on a road that has sharp curves on which the cameras are unable to see upcoming traffic lights or stop 
signs.
• A traffic light, stop sign, or road marking is obstructed (for example, a tree, a large vehicle, etc.).
• Model 3 is being driven very close to a vehicle in front of it, which is blocking the view of a camera.
WARNING: The limitations listed above are not an exhaustive list of reasons why Model 3 may not operate as expected. 
Many unforeseen circumstances can adversely impact the accurate operation of Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control. 
Using this feature does not reduce or eliminate the need to drive attentively and responsibly. You must be prepared to 
take appropriate and immediate action at all times.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, 
options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may 
not be equipped with Full Self-Driving (Supervised) (also 
referred to as Autosteer on City Streets), or the feature may 
not operate exactly as described.
When Full Self-Driving (Supervised) (also referred to as 
Autosteer on City Streets) is engaged, Model 3 attempts to 
drive to your destination by following curves in the road, 
stopping at and negotiating intersections, making left and 
right turns, navigating roundabouts, and entering/exiting 
highways.
Unlike Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, and Navigate 
on Autopilot, which are intended for use on multi-lane 
roadways with clear lane markings, Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) is meant to work in a variety of driving 
scenarios. You can use Full Self-Driving (Supervised) on any 
type of roadway, including residential and city streets.
WARNING: Driver intervention may be required in 
certain situations, such as on narrow roads with 
oncoming cars, in construction zones, or while going 
through complex intersections. For more examples of 
scenarios in which driver intervention might be 
required, see Limitations and Warnings on page 123.
Full Self-Driving (Supervised) uses inputs from cameras 
mounted at the front, rear, left, and right of Model 3 to build a 
model of the area surrounding Model 3 (see Cameras on 
page 20). The Full Self-Driving computer installed in Model 3 
is designed to use this input, rapidly process neural 
networks, and make decisions to safely guide you to your 
destination.
NOTE: As Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) capabilities 
evolve, Model 3 is upgraded through over-the-air software 
updates. Download updates as soon as they become 
available.
Like other Autopilot features, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) 
requires a fully attentive driver and will display a series of 
escalating warnings requiring driver response. You must keep 
your hands on the steering wheel while Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) is engaged. While Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) is engaged, the cabin camera monitors driver 
attentiveness (see Driver Attentiveness on page 115).
WARNING: Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is a hands-on 
feature that requires you to pay attention to the road at 
all times. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all 
times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding 
traffic, pay attention to pedestrians and cyclists, and 
always be prepared to take immediate action 
(especially around blind corners, crossing 
intersections, and in narrow driving situations). Failure 
to follow these instructions could cause damage, 
serious injury or death. It is your responsibility to 
familiarize yourself with the limitations of Full Self-
Driving (Supervised) and the situations in which it may 
not work as expected. For more information, see 
Limitations and Warnings on page 123.
CAUTION: Use of Full Self-Driving (Supervised) will be 
suspended if improper usage is detected. For more 
information, see Autopilot Suspension on page 116.
CAUTION: As Full Self-Driving (Supervised) 
deployment expands, Tesla will gradually make it 
available to eligible customers in select countries 
outside of the United States and Canada. Because 
every country contains unique infrastructure, driving 
behaviors, and traffic patterns that Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) must adapt to over time, it is essential for 
drivers using Full Self-Driving (Supervised) in newly 
eligible countries to be extra attentive and overly 
cautious. You must be ready to take over safely at any 
time.
Before Using Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised)
Before using Full Self-Driving (Supervised), you must:
• Ensure that the cameras on Model 3 are unobstructed and 
calibrated (see Cameras on page 20). Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) depends on the ability of the cameras to 
detect traffic lights, stop signs, and road markings.
• Ensure that the latest version of maps has been 
downloaded to Model 3. Although Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) primarily uses visual data received from the 
vehicle's cameras, greater accuracy is achieved when 
using the most recent map data. To check which version 
of maps is currently downloaded, touch Controls > 
Software. You must connect to a Wi-Fi network to receive 
updated maps (see Map Updates on page 160).
In addition, you must enable Full Self-Driving (Supervised) 
before you can use it. To enable Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised), touch Controls > Autopilot > Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) and then, after carefully reading and 
understanding the popup window, touch Yes.
NOTE: When Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is enabled, the 
setting for Autopilot Activation is set to Single Click and 
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer are unavailable.
Customize Full Self-Driving (Supervised) settings by 
touching Controls > Autopilot.
• Full Self-Driving (Supervised): If desired, change the 
default setting of Average to Chill or Assertive. Chill 
provides a more relaxed driving style and Assertive drives 
with more urgency.
• Minimal Lane Changes for the Current Drive: When 
selected, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) makes fewer lane 
changes on the current drive. Model 3 will still make lane 
changes as necessary to follow the navigation route.
NOTE: While Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is selected, 
tilting the right steering wheel button to the right or left 
also allows you to change the Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) profile and enable or disable Minimal Lane 
Changes.
Full Self-Driving (Supervised)
113
Autopilot


• Automatic Set Speed Offset: When enabled, Model 3 
drives at the speed that Autopilot determines to be the 
most natural. This considers factors like road type, traffic 
flow, environmental conditions, the detected speed limit, 
and the selected Full Self-Driving (Supervised) profile 
setting.
WARNING: You are responsible for the speed of the 
vehicle at all times, whether Autopilot is engaged or 
not.
To Use Full Self-Driving (Supervised)
Once Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is enabled, activate it the 
same way you would Autosteer (see Autosteer on page 99).
1. Enter a destination. If you do not choose a destination, 
Model 3 chooses the most probable driving path or 
suggests a destination based on your driving.
2. When the touchscreen displays the gray steering wheel 
icon, press the right scroll wheel.
You can engage Full Self-Driving (Supervised) at any speed 
less than 85 mph (150 km/h), including when Model 3 is at a 
standstill.
The touchscreen displays the maximum speed in blue. When 
you engage Full Self-Driving (Supervised), the set cruising 
speed defaults to the speed limit, plus any offset you’ve 
specified. If Autopilot is unable to determine the speed limit, 
the cruising speed is your current speed, in addition to any 
specified offset.
To indicate that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) 
is available but not engaged, the top corner of 
the touchscreen displays a gray steering wheel 
icon next to the driving gear.
When Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is 
engaged, the steering wheel icon is blue and a 
blue line represents your driving path.
When Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is engaged, the 
touchscreen displays a visualization of the environment 
surrounding Model 3, including the roadway and detected 
objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, curbs, bicyclists, and 
more. Objects that are highlighted on the visualization 
represent priorities that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is 
actively controlling for at a given time.
NOTE: The Full Self-Driving (Supervised) visualization may 
not be a holistic representation of the objects, road markings, 
road signals, and other variables that Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) takes into account as it attempts to drive to 
your destination. While Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is 
engaged, it uses data from the cameras on Model 3 that may 
not be represented in the visualization (see Cameras on page 
20).
The visualization will also inform you of the system’s intended 
action by displaying a message on the touchscreen, such as 
when the vehicle is slowly creeping for visibility to take a turn 
at an intersection.
You can widen the visualization area to fullscreen. Enable the 
setting by touching Controls > Autopilot > Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) > Expanded Full Self-Driving Visualization. Then 
on the touchscreen, swipe the visualization window handle to 
fill the entire screen.
NOTE: You can override Full Self-Driving (Supervised) at any 
time if you are uncomfortable or uncertain about the system’s 
intended course of action. You are driving Model 3 at all 
times.
Canceling Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised)
To disengage Full Self-Driving (Supervised), do any of the 
following:
• Press the brake pedal.
• Press the right scroll wheel on the steering wheel
• Take over and steer manually.
When you disengage Full Self-Driving (Supervised) by 
steering manually, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control remains 
active.
In addition, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) will disengage if 
any of the following occurs:
• You shift out of Drive.
• A door or trunk is opened.
• There is an Automatic Emergency Braking event (see 
Collision Avoidance Assist on page 132).
• The driver's seatbelt is released, and/or the driver gets 
out of their seat.
• You do not respond to repeated reminders to keep your 
hands on the wheel and subsequent messages on the 
touchscreen.
Full Self-Driving (Supervised)
114
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


• Full Self-Driving (Supervised) becomes unavailable. This 
can happen for a number of reasons (for example, if a 
camera becomes obscured). If Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) disengages, an alert will appear on the 
touchscreen to notify you and a chime will sound. If this 
happens, take control of steering immediately.
When driver intervention is required, it is best to safely 
disengage as soon as possible. It is recommended to practice 
disengaging from Full Self-Driving (Supervised) in safe 
environment without other road users so you may become 
familiar with the process.
While Using Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised)
Full Self-Driving (Supervised) changes lanes, makes left and 
right turns, follows on- and off-ramps, and takes forks in the 
road as necessary to reach the destination.
WARNING: NEVER make assumptions and predict 
when and where Full Self-Driving (Supervised) will 
stop or continue through an intersection or road 
marking. From a driver's perspective, the behavior of 
Full Self-Driving (Supervised) may appear inconsistent. 
Always pay attention to the roadway and be prepared 
to take immediate action. It is the driver's responsibility 
to determine whether to stop or continue through an 
intersection. Never depend on Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) to determine when it is safe and/or 
appropriate to stop or continue through an 
intersection. 
Like Autosteer and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Full Self-
Driving (Supervised) maintains your speed and following 
distance from the vehicle ahead of Model 3, if there is one. 
Full Self-Driving (Supervised) also slows down and stops at 
traffic lights and stop signs as necessary, and reacts to 
pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles on the road.
For example, if you are driving on a residential street and 
another vehicle backs out of a driveway ahead of Model 3, 
Full Self-Driving (Supervised) slows down or stops as 
appropriate. If the other vehicle stops backing out while 
partially blocking the driving lane, Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) slows down and maneuvers around the other 
vehicle if the width of the lane allows it.
When the traffic in front of you is slowing down, Full Self-
Driving (Supervised) shows blue arrows in the driving lane 
and slows down to maintain an appropriate following distance 
from the vehicle ahead of you. When you are driving on the 
highway, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) displays a message 
on the touchscreen to inform you when an action (such as a 
lane change) is being taken.
WARNING: In rare cases, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) 
may not appropriately slow down, come to a stop, or 
resume control for a stop sign or traffic light. You may 
assist the system by lightly applying the accelerator, or 
can override Full Self-Driving (Supervised) at any time.
Changing Lanes
To tell Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to change lanes while on 
a multi-lane roadway, engage the right or left turn signal. On 
city or residential streets, engaging the right or left turn 
signal tells Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to make a right or 
left turn, respectively.
Unlike Navigate on Autopilot, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) 
does not require confirmation before a lane change. To 
cancel a lane change or turn, cancel the turn signal or 
intervene with the steering wheel or other vehicle controls.
To be notified by a Chime, Vibration, or Both of upcoming 
lane changes (in addition to the notification on the 
touchscreen), touch Controls > Autopilot > Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) and then select a Lane Change Notification.
Changing the Set Speed
While Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is active, roll the right 
scroll wheel up to increase, or down to decrease, the set 
speed.
NOTE: In some cases, your speed is limited by the speed 
limit, the type of roadway, or the flow of traffic. If this is the 
case, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) displays a message at 
the top of the visualization.
Arriving at Your Destination
Once you reach your destination, Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) stops Model 3 and displays a message 
indicating that navigation is complete.
Driver Attentiveness
Like other Autopilot features, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) 
requires driver attentiveness. Your hands must be on the 
steering wheel at all times while Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) is engaged, and you must monitor your 
surroundings, the road, and other road users.
WARNING: The use of devices designed to circumvent 
driver attentiveness is a violation of the terms of use 
for Full Self-Driving (Supervised) and may result in the 
feature being permanently disabled on your vehicle 
and a ban on future use of the feature.
Full Self-Driving (Supervised) periodically displays a 
message reminding the driver to apply slight force to the 
steering wheel:
Apply slight turning force to steering wheel
Full Self-Driving (Supervised)
115
Autopilot


If Model 3 does not detect slight turning force on the 
steering wheel, the touchscreen flashes and eventually 
chimes repeatedly. Do not use handheld devices while using 
Full Self-Driving (Supervised). If the cabin camera detects a 
handheld device while Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is 
engaged, the touchscreen displays a message reminding you 
to keep your hands on the wheel.
Similarly, the cabin camera monitors your continued 
attentiveness when using Full Self-Driving (Supervised). This 
system cannot be disabled. The touchscreen displays a 
message reminding you to pay attention if you repeatedly 
look away from the road, obstruct the camera, or prevent the 
system from identifying your gaze.
If you repeatedly ignore prompts to apply slight force to the 
steering wheel or to pay attention, Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) disables for the rest of the drive and displays 
the following message requesting you to drive manually. If 
you don't resume manual steering, Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) sounds a continuous chime, turns on the 
warning flashers, and slows the vehicle to a complete stop.
Autopilot unavailable for current drive. 
Autopilot Strikeout - Attention warnings 
ignored.
Autopilot Suspension
Use of Autopilot features will be suspended if improper 
usage is detected.
Use of Autosteer and Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is 
suspended for a week when you or another driver of your 
vehicle receives five Autopilot "strikeouts." A strikeout is 
when the Autopilot system disengages for the remainder of a 
trip after the driver receives several audio and visual 
warnings for inattentiveness.
You can see how many strikeouts are remaining before 
Autopilot access is suspended by touching Controls > 
Autopilot.
A strikeout is forgiven after 7 days, as long as you don't 
receive another strikeout in that time.
NOTE: If your access to Autosteer and Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) is suspended, you also lose access to Autopark. 
However, you can still use Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and 
all active safety features are still enabled.
There may be occasions where driver intervention is required 
and you must take over immediately to maintain safe driving. 
Driver-initiated disengagements do not count as improper 
usage and are expected from the driver.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, 
options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may 
not be equipped with Autopark.
Autopark uses data to simplify parking on public roads by 
maneuvering Model 3 into parallel and perpendicular parking 
spaces.
NOTE: Autopark is unavailable when Traffic-Aware Cruise 
Control is enabled. To use Autopark, enable Autosteer or Full 
Self-Driving (Supervised) by touching Controls > Autopilot.
If your access to Autosteer and Full Self-Driving (Supervised) 
is suspended, you also lose access to Autopark. For more 
information, see Autopilot Suspension on page 104.
WARNING: It is your responsibility to familiarize 
yourself with the limitations of Autopark and the 
situations in which it may not work as expected. For 
more information, see Limitations and Warnings on 
page 123.
WARNING: Do not use Autopark if anything, such as a 
ball hitch, bike rack, or trailer, is attached to the tow 
hitch. Autopark may not stop for hitches when parking 
between or in front of other vehicles.
CAUTION: Autopark's performance depends on the 
ability of the cameras to determine the vehicle's 
proximity to curbs, objects, and other vehicles. Ensure 
all cameras are clean and free of obstructions before 
each drive and before using Autopilot features (see 
Cleaning a Camera on page 190). Dirty cameras and 
sensors (if equipped), as well as environmental 
conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can 
affect Autopilot performance. If a camera is obstructed 
or blinded, Model 3 displays a message on the 
touchscreen and Autopilot features may not be 
available. For more information on specific alerts, see 
Troubleshooting Alerts on page 224.
Parameters
Autopark detects potential parking spaces based on the 
following parameters:
Perpendicular Parking 
• Your driving speed must be below 8 mph (13 km/h). If 
driving too fast, Autopark may not be able to accurately 
detect your desired parking space.
• The parking space must be at least as wide as your 
vehicle.
• The parking space must have at least three visible lines 
for the vehicle to park into, such as parking lines, road 
markings, or distinct curbs. Autopark may not work in a 
garage, for example, without three visible parking lines.
• Autopark may not work with textured road surfaces such 
as cobblestone or brick.
Parallel Parking
• Your driving speed must be below 8 mph (13 km/h). If 
driving too fast, Autopark may not be able to accurately 
detect your desired parking space.
• There must be a vehicle in front of or behind the space 
you want to park in.
NOTE: Autopark does not operate on angled parking spaces.
To Use Autopark
When driving, follow these steps to allow Autopark to 
maneuver Model 3 into a parking space:
1. While driving slowly, monitor the touchscreen to see 
potential parking spaces detected by Autopilot. When 
Model 3 is positioned such that it can reverse into one of 
the detected locations, the touchscreen displays potential 
open parking spaces.
NOTE: The detected parking spaces appear only if the 
vehicle's position and/or the circumstances of the 
surrounding area are such that Autopark can determine an 
appropriate driving path. If Autopark cannot determine an 
appropriate path (for example, when driving on a narrow 
street where moving into the parking space causes the 
front of the vehicle to extend into the adjacent lane), you 
can either reposition the vehicle, find a different parking 
space, or park manually.

2. Choose a spot. Check to determine if it is appropriate and 
safe, then pull forward and stop approximately one car 
length ahead of the parking space (as you normally would 
when parallel parking or when backing into a 
perpendicular parking space).
3. Release the steering wheel, then touch and hold Autopark 
in the drive mode strip on the touchscreen. You can 
release the button once Autopark engages.
4. Autopark displays a message when parking is complete.
If you press the brake pedal when Autopark is actively 
parking Model 3, the parking process pauses until you touch 
Resume on the touchscreen.
WARNING: Never depend on Autopark to find a parking 
space that is legal, suitable, and safe. Autopark may 
not always detect objects in the parking space. Always 
perform visual checks to confirm that a parking space 
is appropriate and safe.
WARNING: When Autopark is actively steering Model 
3:
• Do not interfere with the movement of the steering 
wheel. Doing so cancels Autopark.
• Continually check your surroundings. Be prepared 
to apply the brakes to avoid vehicles, pedestrians, 
or objects.
• Monitor the touchscreen to ensure that you are 
aware of the instructions that Autopark is providing.
To Pause Parking
To pause Autopark, press the brake pedal once. Model 3 
stops and remains stopped until you touch Resume on the 
touchscreen.
To Cancel Parking
Autopark cancels the parking sequence when you manually 
move the steering wheel, shift, or touch Cancel on the 
touchscreen. Autopark also cancels parking when:
• The parking sequence exceeds seven moves.
• Model 3 detects that the driver is exiting the vehicle.
• A door is opened.
• You press the accelerator pedal.
• You press the brake pedal while Autopark is paused.
• An Automatic Emergency Braking event occurs (see 
Collision Avoidance Assist on page 132).

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


This feature may be temporarily limited or inactive until it is 
enabled with a future software update for vehicles 
manufactured as of approximately September 2023.
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, 
options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may 
not be equipped with Summon, or the feature may not 
operate exactly as described.
Summon allows you to automatically park and retrieve Model 
3 while you are standing outside the vehicle. Summon moves 
Model 3 forward and reverse up to 39 ft. (12 meters) in, or 
out of, a parking space.
To move Model 3 a longer distance while steering around 
objects, you can use Smart Summon (if equipped) and your 
mobile phone. Smart Summon allows your vehicle to find you 
(or you can send your vehicle to a chosen location). See 
Smart Summon on page 121.
Summon requires that Model 3 can detect a valid key nearby.
WARNING: Summon is designed and intended for use 
only on parking lots and driveways on private property 
where the surrounding area is familiar and predictable.
WARNING: Summon is a BETA feature. You must 
continually monitor the vehicle and its surroundings 
and stay prepared to take immediate action at any time. 
It is the driver's responsibility to use Summon safely, 
responsibly, and as intended. For more information 
about the limitations of Summon and conditions that 
may interfere with its use, see Warnings and 
Limitations on page 123.
Before Using Summon
Before operating Summon, use the touchscreen to enable it 
and customize how you want it to work. Touch Controls > 
Autopilot > Customize Summon and adjust the following 
settings to suit your preferences:
• Bumper Clearance: Set the distance that you want 
Summon to stop from a detected object (for example, you 
may want Summon to stop within just a few inches of a 
garage wall). Note that this distance applies only to 
objects that Summon detects directly in front of Model 3 
when moving forward, or directly behind Model 3 when 
reversing.
• Summon Distance: Set a maximum distance that Model 3 
can travel when entering or exiting a parking space.
• Side Clearance: Choose an option to specify how much 
side clearance you want to allow. Tight allows Model 3 to 
enter and exit very narrow parking spaces.
WARNING: Parking in a narrow space limits the 
ability of the cameras and sensors (if equipped) to 
accurately detect the location of obstacles, 
increasing the risk of damage to Model 3 and/or 
surrounding objects.
• Require Continuous Press: By default, Summon requires 
that you press and hold a button on the mobile app to 
move Model 3 during the parking process. When Require 
Continuous Press is set to No, you can press and release 
the button—you don't need to hold it down to keep the 
vehicle moving.
• Use Auto HomeLink (if equipped): Set to ON if you want to 
activate HomeLink to open/close a programmed 
HomeLink device (such as a gate or a garage door) during 
the parking process when using Summon. If enabled, the 
device automatically opens and closes when Model 3 
enters or exits during a Summon session. In a Smart 
Summon session (if equipped), the device automatically 
opens when, at the beginning of a session, Smart 
Summon detects that Model 3 is parked in a garage.
WARNING: Always ensure that Model 3 is fully in or 
out of a garage before HomeLink lowers the garage 
door. Summon and Smart Summon (if equipped) 
cannot detect where an overhead door will lower.
NOTE: When enabled, the HomeLink device automatically 
opens and closes when using Summon, and automatically 
opens as needed when using Smart Summon (if 
equipped). To automate HomeLink in other situations 
(such as normal driving), you must adjust the HomeLink 
device's main settings by touching the HomeLink icon at 
the top of the Controls screen (see Smart Garage on page 
58).
The above settings, with the exception of HomeLink, apply 
only to Summon—not Smart Summon (if equipped) (see 
Before Using Smart Summon on page 121). You cannot 
customize Smart Summon's bumper clearance, distance, and 
side clearance. And when using Smart Summon, you must 
always hold down the button on the mobile app to keep 
Model 3 moving. Also, Smart Summon operates with the 
mobile app only. All settings are retained until you manually 
change them.
Using Summon to Park and Retrieve 
your Vehicle
Follow these steps to use Summon to park your Model 3:
• Align Model 3 within 39 ft. (12 meters) of the parking 
space so Model 3 can follow a straight path into or out of 
the space in either Drive or Reverse.
• From outside the vehicle, initiate the parking maneuver by 
touching Summon on the mobile app, then holding down 
the Forward or Reverse button.
NOTE: If the Require Continuous Press setting is No, you 
do not need to hold down the button, just press and 
release.
NOTE: You can also initiate the parking maneuver from 
inside the vehicle (see Starting Summon Before Exiting 
the Vehicle on page 120).
Summon
119
Autopilot


Summon shifts Model 3 into Drive or Reverse (based on the 
direction you specified) and drives into or out of the parking 
space. When parking is complete, or if an obstacle is 
detected, Summon shifts Model 3 into Park. Summon shifts 
Model 3 into Park when:
• Model 3 detects an obstacle in its driving path (within the 
Bumper Clearance setting that you specified).
• Summon has moved Model 3 the maximum distance of 39 
ft. (12 meters).
• You release the Forward or Reverse button (when Require 
Continuous Press is turned on).
• You press any button to manually stop Summon.
If you used Summon to park Model 3, you can then use 
Summon to return Model 3 back to its original position 
(provided Model 3 has remained in Park), or to the maximum 
Summon Distance that you have specified (whichever comes 
first). Simply specify the opposite direction on the mobile 
app and Summon moves Model 3 along the original path, 
provided no obstructions have been introduced. If an 
obstacle is detected, Model 3 attempts to avoid the obstacle 
while staying very close to its original path (Summon does 
not steer around obstacles).
NOTE: To use Summon to move Model 3 multiple times in the 
same direction (not to exceed the maximum of 39 ft. (12 
meters), cancel Summon and then restart the parking 
process using the same direction.
NOTE: Although Summon can move Model 3 a short distance 
laterally to avoid an obstacle, it does not attempt to steer 
around an obstacle to return Model 3 to its original driving 
path. Only Smart Summon (if equipped) can steer Model 3 
around objects.
NOTE: Summon requires that Model 3 can detect an 
authenticated phone nearby (Canada only).
WARNING: Model 3 cannot detect obstacles that are 
located lower than the bumper, are very narrow, or are 
hanging from a ceiling (for example, bicycles). In 
addition, many unforeseen circumstances can impair 
Summon's ability to move in or out of a parking space 
and, as a result, Summon may not move Model 3 
appropriately. Therefore, you must continually monitor 
the vehicle's movement and its surroundings and 
remain prepared to stop Model 3 at any time.
Starting Summon Before Exiting the Vehicle
To start a Summon parking sequence before exiting Model 3:
1. On the touchscreen, ensure that Require Continuous Press 
is disabled (touch Controls > Autopilot > Customize 
Summon > Require Continuous Press).
2. Close all doors and trunks.
3. With Model 3 powered on and Park engaged, double 
press the scroll button on the right side of the steering 
wheel. The touchscreen displays a popup screen.
4. On the touchscreen, choose the direction of travel.
5. Exit Model 3 and close the driver's door.
Summon now moves Model 3 according to the direction you 
specified on the touchscreen.
NOTE: To cancel the parking maneuver before exiting the 
vehicle, touch Cancel on the popup screen.
NOTE: If you do not choose a direction of travel on the 
touchscreen, Summon does not start a parking maneuver 
when you exit.
Stopping or Canceling Summon
Stop Model 3 at any time while Summon is active by using 
the mobile app. Summon also cancels when:
• A door handle is engaged or a door is opened.
• You interact with the steering wheel, brake pedal, 
accelerator pedal, or shift.
• Model 3 detects an obstacle.
• Summon has moved Model 3 the maximum distance of 
approximately 39 ft. (12 meters).
• Your phone enters sleep mode or loses connectivity to 
Model 3.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


This feature may be temporarily limited or inactive until it is 
enabled with a future software update for vehicles 
manufactured as of approximately September 2023.
NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, 
options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may 
not be equipped with Smart Summon, or the feature may not 
operate exactly as described.
Smart Summon is designed to allow you to move Model 3 to 
your location (using your phone's GPS as a target 
destination) or to a location of your choice, maneuvering 
around and stopping for objects as necessary. Smart 
Summon works with the Tesla mobile app when your phone is 
located within approximately 213 ft. (65 meters) of Model 3. 
Smart Summon maneuvers Model 3 out of parking spaces 
and around corners. This is useful for moving Model 3 out of 
a tight parking spot, through puddles, or helping you retrieve 
your car while carrying packages. You must maintain a clear 
line of sight between you and Model 3 and closely monitor 
the vehicle and its surroundings at all times.
CAUTION: Smart Summon is designed and intended for 
use only on parking lots and driveways located on 
private property where the surrounding area is familiar 
and predictable. Do not use Smart Summon on public 
roads.
WARNING: Smart Summon must only be used on paved 
surfaces.
WARNING: Smart Summon is a BETA feature. You must 
continually monitor the vehicle and its surroundings 
and stay prepared to take immediate action at any time. 
It is the driver's responsibility to use Smart Summon 
safely, responsibly, and as intended. It is your 
responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations 
of Smart Summon (see Limitations and Warnings on 
page 123).
Before Using Smart Summon
• Download the latest version of the Tesla mobile app to 
your phone, and ensure your phone has cellular service 
and GPS enabled.
• Your phone must be connected to Model 3 and located 
within approximately 213 ft. (65 meters).
• The vehicle's cameras must be fully calibrated (see Drive 
to Calibrate Cameras on page 20).
• You must have a clear line of sight to Model 3.
• Model 3 must be in Park, not charging, and all doors and 
trunks must be closed.
CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if 
equipped) are clean. Dirty cameras and sensors, as 
well as environmental conditions such as rain and 
faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance.
Using Smart Summon
1. Open the Tesla mobile app, and press Summon.
2. Press the Smart Summon icon located in the center of the 
image of your Model 3. It may take several seconds for 
Smart Summon to start up.
NOTE: You can use Standby Mode to eliminate the delay 
that occurs when Smart Summon is starting up (see 
Standby Mode on page 122).
The mobile app displays a map with a blue circle, which 
represents the maximum proximity of 213 ft. (65 meters) 
that you must maintain between your phone and Model 3. 
The blue dot on the map represents your location, and the 
red arrow represents the vehicle.
3. Position yourself anywhere within the blue circle where 
you have a clear line of sight to Model 3.
4. You can now operate Smart Summon using either of these 
modes:
◦ Come to Me mode: Press and hold the Come to Me 
button. Model 3 moves to your GPS location. As you 
move, Model 3 follows you. When Model 3 reaches 
you, it stops and shifts into park.
◦ Go to Target mode: Touch the crosshair icon then drag 
the map to position the pin on a chosen destination. 
Press and hold the Go to Target button. Model 3 moves 
to the destination. When reaching the location, Model 
3 stops and shifts into Park and the mobile app 
displays a message indicating that Summon has 
completed.
NOTE: To subsequently change the location, lift your 
finger, reposition the map, then press and hold Go to 
Target again.
To stop Model 3 at any time, simply release the Come to 
Me or Go to Target button.
The map's crosshair icon toggles between Go 
to Target and Come to Me modes. When Come 
to Me mode is selected, the icon is blue.
NOTE: The map also has an icon that allows 
you to display/hide satellite imagery.
Immediately after initiating Smart Summon in either mode, 
hazard lights briefly flash, mirrors fold, and Model 3 shifts 
into Drive or Reverse. Model 3 then slowly moves to within 3 
ft. (1 meter) of you (Come to Me) or your chosen destination 
(Go to Target), navigating obstacles as needed. As Model 3 
moves, the corresponding red arrow on the map also moves 
to show the vehicle’s location. As you move, the 
corresponding blue dot also moves to show your location.
In either mode, Model 3 stops moving and shifts into park 
when:
• You release the button on the mobile app.
Smart Summon
121
Autopilot


• The maximum proximity between your phone and Model 3 
is exceeded (if moving the vehicle to a destination away 
from you, you may need to follow the car to maintain this 
distance).
• The driving path is blocked.
• Model 3 has moved the maximum distance of 475 ft. (145 
meters) since the start of the Smart Summon session, or 
has moved 492 ft. (150 meters) away from the location 
from which the vehicle was last driven manually.
NOTE: If Smart Summon moves Model 3 forward 3 ft. and 
then backwards 2 ft., this is considered 5 ft. of travel.
NOTE: There is no need to look at the mobile app—just hold 
down the button while keeping your eye on Model 3 and its 
driving path at all times, remaining ready to release the 
button to stop the vehicle if needed.
If equipped and Auto HomeLink is enabled for Summon 
(touch Controls > Autopilot > Customize Summon > Use Auto

device if you start the Smart Summon maneuver when Model 
3 is located inside a garage. The mobile app informs you that 
the door has opened.
WARNING: When you release the button to stop Model 
3, a slight delay occurs before the vehicle stops. 
Therefore, it is critical that you pay close attention to 
the vehicle’s driving path at all times and proactively 
anticipate obstacles that the vehicle may be unable to 
detect.
WARNING: Use extreme caution when using Smart 
Summon in environments where movement of 
obstacles can be unpredictable. For example, where 
people, children or animals are present.
WARNING: Smart Summon may not stop for all objects 
(especially very low objects such as some curbs, or 
very high objects such as a shelf) and may not react to 
all oncoming or side traffic. Pay attention and be ready 
to stop Model 3 at all times by releasing the button on 
the mobile app.
Standby Mode
To keep Model 3 ready to Summon and reduce the time it 
takes to warm up, turn on Standby Mode. Touch Controls > 
Autopilot > Standby Mode. When Standby Mode is turned on, 
you can conserve Battery energy by disabling Standby Mode 
at these locations:
• Exclude Home - Disables Standby Mode at the location 
you set as Home in your Favorites list.

NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, 
options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may 
not be equipped with all features listed above, or a feature 
may not operate as described.
WARNING: Read the following warnings and limitations 
carefully before using Autopilot. Failure to follow all 
warnings and instructions can result in property 
damage, serious injury, or death.
NOTE: Ensure all cameras are clean and free of obstructions 
before each drive and before using Autopilot features (see 
Cleaning a Camera on page 190). Dirty cameras and sensors 
(if equipped), as well as environmental conditions such as 
rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot 
performance. If a camera is obstructed or blinded, Model 3 
displays a message on the touchscreen and Autopilot 
features may not be available. For more information on 
specific alerts, see Troubleshooting Alerts on page 224.
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control
While using Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, it is the driver’s 
responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the 
vehicle at all times. Always keep your eyes on the road when 
driving and be prepared to take corrective action as needed.
In addition, it is the driver’s responsibility to cruise at a safe 
speed and maintain a safe following distance based on road 
conditions and applicable speed limits. Be aware of the 
following limitations while Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is 
active.
• There may be situations where the cruising speed may not 
change when the speed limit changes.
• Traffic-Aware Cruise Control does not adapt driving 
speed based on road and driving conditions. Do not use 
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control on winding roads with sharp 
curves, on icy or slippery road surfaces, or when weather 
conditions (such as heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) make it 
inappropriate to drive at a consistent speed.
• Do not rely on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to maintain an 
accurate or appropriate following distance.
• Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may be unable to provide 
adequate speed control because of limited braking 
capability and hills. It can also misjudge the distance from 
a vehicle ahead. Driving downhill can increase driving 
speed, causing Model 3 to exceed your set speed (and 
potentially the road's speed limit).
• Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may occasionally cause 
Model 3 to brake when not required or when you are not 
expecting it. This can be caused by closely following a 
vehicle ahead, detecting vehicles or objects in adjacent 
lanes (especially on curves), etc.
• Due to limitations inherent in the onboard GPS (Global 
Positioning System), you may experience situations in 
which Model 3 slows down, especially near exits or off-
ramps where a curve is detected and/or you are 
navigating to a destination and not following the route.
• In some cases (such as having insufficient data), Traffic-
Aware Cruise Control may not automatically reduce the 
set speed on the highway interchange or off-ramp.
• Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may not detect all objects 
and, especially when cruising over 50 mph (80 km/h), 
may not brake/decelerate when a vehicle or object is only 
partially in the driving lane or when a vehicle you are 
following moves out of your driving path and a stationary 
or slow-moving vehicle or object is in front of you.
• Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may react to vehicles or 
objects that either do not exist, or are not in your lane of 
travel, causing Model 3 to slow down unnecessarily or 
inappropriately.
WARNING: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is particularly 
unlikely to operate as intended in the following types of 
situations:
• The road has sharp curves or significant changes in 
elevation.
• Road signs and signals are unclear, ambiguous, or 
poorly maintained.
• Visibility is poor (due to heavy rain, snow, hail, etc. 
or poorly lit roadways at night)
• You are driving in a tunnel or next to a highway 
divider that interferes with the view of the 
camera(s)
• Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or 
direct sunlight) interferes with the view of the 
camera(s).
WARNING: The list above does not represent an 
exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with 
proper operation of Traffic-Aware Cruise Control. 
Traffic-Aware Cruise Control can cancel unexpectedly 
at any time for unforeseen reasons. Always watch the 
road in front of you and stay prepared to take 
appropriate action. It is the driver's responsibility to be 
in control of Model 3 at all times.
Limitations and Warnings
123
Autopilot


WARNING: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is designed 
for your driving comfort and convenience and is not a 
collision warning or avoidance system. Never depend 
on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to adequately slow 
down Model 3. Always watch the road in front of you 
and be prepared to take corrective action at all times. 
Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death.
WARNING: Although Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is 
capable of detecting pedestrians and cyclists, never 
depend on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to adequately 
slow Model 3 down for them. Failure to do so can result 
in serious injury or death.
Autosteer
WARNING: Autosteer is a hands-on feature. Keep your 
hands on the steering wheel at all times, be mindful of 
road conditions and surrounding traffic, and always be 
prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow 
these instructions could cause damage, serious injury 
or death.
WARNING: Autosteer is intended for use on 
controlled-access highways with a fully attentive 
driver. Do not use Autosteer in construction zones, or 
in areas where bicyclists or pedestrians may be 
present.
WARNING: Never depend on Autosteer to determine an 
appropriate driving path.
CAUTION: Autosteer and its associated functions are 
particularly unlikely to operate as intended when:
• Autosteer is unable to accurately determine lane 
markings. For example, lane markings are 
excessively worn, have visible previous markings, 
have been adjusted due to road construction, are 
changing quickly (lanes branching off, crossing 
over, or merging), objects or landscape features are 
casting strong shadows on the lane markings, or the 
road surface contains pavement seams or other 
high-contrast lines.
• Visibility is poor (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or 
weather conditions are interfering with sensor 
operation.
• A camera(s) or sensor(s) is obstructed, covered, or 
damaged.
• Driving on hills.
• Approaching a toll booth.
• Driving on a road that has sharp curves or is 
excessively rough.
• Bright light (such as direct sunlight) is interfering 
with the view of the camera(s).
• The sensors (if equipped) are affected by other 
electrical equipment or devices that generate 
ultrasonic waves.
• A vehicle is detected in your blind spot when you 
engage the turn signal.
• Model 3 is being driven very close to a vehicle in 
front of it, which is blocking the view of the 
camera(s).
WARNING: Many unforeseen circumstances can impair 
the operation of Autosteer. Always keep this in mind 
and remember that as a result, Autosteer may not steer 
Model 3 appropriately. Always drive attentively and be 
prepared to take immediate action.
WARNING: Autosteer is not designed to, and will not, 
steer Model 3 around objects partially in a driving lane 
and in some cases, may not stop for objects that are 
completely blocking the driving lane. Always watch the 
road in front of you and stay prepared to take 
immediate action. It is the driver's responsibility to be 
in control of Model 3 at all times.
Auto Lane Change
CAUTION: When changing lanes using Auto Lane 
Change, It is the driver's responsibility to determine 
whether a lane change is safe and appropriate. 
Therefore, before initiating a lane change, always 
check blind spots, lane markings, and the surrounding 
roadway to confirm it is safe and appropriate to move 
into the target lane.
Limitations and Warnings
124
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


CAUTION: Be aware of the following limitations while 
using Auto Lane Change.
• Never depend on Auto Lane Change to determine 
an appropriate driving path. Drive attentively by 
watching the road and traffic ahead of you, 
checking the surrounding area, and monitoring the 
touchscreen for warnings. Always be prepared to 
take immediate action.
• Do not use Auto Lane Change on roads where 
traffic conditions are constantly changing and 
where bicycles and pedestrians are present.
• The performance of Auto Lane Change depends on 
the ability of the camera(s) to recognize lane 
markings.
• Do not use Auto Lane Change on winding roads 
with sharp curves, on icy or slippery roads, or when 
weather conditions (such as heavy rain, snow, fog, 
etc.) may be obstructing the view from the 
camera(s) or sensors (if equipped).
• Overtake Acceleration can cancel for many 
unforeseen reasons in addition to those listed above 
(for example, lack of GPS data). Stay alert and 
never depend on Overtake Acceleration to increase 
your driving speed.
• Overtake Acceleration increases your driving speed 
whenever the appropriate turn signal is engaged, 
and accelerates Model 3 closer to the vehicle 
ahead. Although Traffic-Aware Cruise Control 
continues to maintain distance from the vehicle 
ahead, it is important to be aware that your selected 
following distance is reduced when Overtake 
Acceleration is active, particularly in cases where it 
may not be your intention to overtake the vehicle 
you are following.
Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning
WARNING: Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning requires 
on-board maps to know that a particular stop light or 
stop sign exists at a location. In some cases, map data 
is inaccurate or outdated and may not include all stop 
lights or stop signs. Therefore, Stop Light and Stop 
Sign Warning may not detect all stop lights and stop 
signs.
WARNING: The Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning 
feature does not apply the brakes or decelerate Model 
3 and may not detect all stop lights and stop signs. 
Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning is designed for 
guidance purposes only and is not a substitute for 
attentive driving and sound judgment. Keep your eyes 
on the road when driving and never depend on Stop 
Light and Stop Sign Warning to warn you of a stop light 
or stop sign.
WARNING: Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning is 
designed to warn you only when approaching a visible 
red stop sign, solid red or later portion of a yellow 
traffic light. It may not warn you of intersections with 
flashing lights and it does not warn you of yield signs or 
temporary stop and yield signs (such as those used in 
construction areas). Additionally, Stop Light and Stop 
Sign Warning does not warn you of approaching stop 
lights or stop signs when you are pressing the 
accelerator pedal or brake pedal (which disables 
Autosteer).
Navigate on Autopilot
WARNING: Never depend on Navigate on Autopilot to 
determine an appropriate lane at an off-ramp. Stay 
alert and perform visual checks to ensure that the 
driving lane is safe and appropriate.
WARNING: If you turn off Require Lane Change 
Confirmation, Navigate on Autopilot notifies you of 
upcoming lane changes and off-ramps, but it remains 
your responsibility to monitor the environment and 
maintain control of Model 3 at all times. Lane changes 
can occur quickly and suddenly. Always keep your 
hands on the wheel and your eyes on the driving path 
in front of you.
WARNING: Navigate on Autopilot does not make 
driving autonomous. You must pay attention to the 
road, keep your hands on the steering wheel at all 
times, and remain aware of your navigation route.
WARNING: As is the case with normal driving, be extra 
careful around blind corners, interchanges, and on-
ramps and off-ramps - obstacles can appear quickly 
and at any time.
WARNING: Navigate on Autopilot may not recognize or 
detect oncoming vehicles, stationary objects, and 
special-use lanes such as those used exclusively for 
bikes, carpools, emergency vehicles, etc. Remain alert 
at all times and be prepared to take immediate action. 
Failure to do so can cause damage, injury or death.
Autosteer on City Streets (Full Self-
Driving (Supervised))
WARNING: Always remember that Full Self-Driving 
(Supervised) (also known as Autosteer on City Streets) 
does not make Model 3 autonomous and requires a fully 
attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at 
all times.
WARNING: Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is a hands-on 
feature. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all 
times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding 
traffic, and always be prepared to take immediate 
action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause 
damage, serious injury or death. It is your responsibility 
to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Full Self-
Driving (Supervised) and the situations in which it may 
not work as expected.
Limitations and Warnings
125
Autopilot


WARNING: Failure to follow all warnings and 
instructions can result in property damage, serious 
injury or death.
CAUTION: Full Self-Driving (Supervised) and its 
associated functions may not operate as intended and 
there are numerous situations in which driver 
intervention may be needed. Examples include (but are 
not limited to):
• Interactions with pedestrians, bicyclists, and other 
road users.
• Unprotected turns with high-speed cross traffic.
• Multi-lane turns.
• Simultaneous lane changes.
• Narrow roads with oncoming cars or double-parked 
vehicles.
• Rare objects such as trailers, ramps, cargo, open 
doors, etc. protruding from vehicles.
• Merges onto high-traffic, high-speed roads.
• Debris in the road.
• Construction zones.
• High curvature roads, particularly at fast driving 
speeds.
Visibility is critical for Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to 
operate. Low visibility, such as low light or poor 
weather conditions (rain, snow, direct sun, fog, etc.) 
can significantly degrade performance.
WARNING: Model 3 may quickly and suddenly make 
unexpected maneuvers or mistakes that require 
immediate driver intervention.
The list above represents only a fraction of the possible 
scenarios that can cause Full Self-Driving (Supervised) 
to make sudden maneuvers and behave unexpectedly. 
In fact, Model 3 can suddenly swerve even when 
driving conditions appear normal and straight-forward. 
Stay alert and always pay attention to the roadway so 
you can anticipate the need to take corrective action as 
early as possible. Remember that this is an early 
access feature that must be used with extra caution.
CAUTION: As Full Self-Driving (Supervised) 
deployment expands, Tesla will gradually make it 
available to eligible customers in select countries 
outside the United States. Because every country 
contains unique infrastructure, driving behaviors, and 
traffic patterns that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) must 
adapt to over time, it is essential for drivers using Full 
Self-Driving (Supervised) in newly eligible countries to 
be extra attentive and overly cautious. You must be 
ready to take over safely at any time.
Autopark
CAUTION: Autopark's performance depends on the 
ability of the cameras and sensors (if equipped) to 
determine the vehicle's proximity to curbs, objects, 
and other vehicles. Be aware of the following warnings 
before and while using Autopark:
• Do not use Autopark if anything, such as a ball 
hitch, bike rack, or trailer, is attached to the tow 
hitch. Autopark may not stop for hitches when 
parking between or in front of other vehicles.
• Never depend on Autopark to find a parking space 
that is legal, suitable, and safe. Autopark may not 
always detect objects in the parking space. Always 
perform visual checks to confirm that a parking 
space is appropriate and safe.
• When Autopark is actively steering Model 3, the 
steering wheel moves in accordance with 
Autopark's adjustments. Do not interfere with the 
movement of the steering wheel. Doing so cancels 
Autopark.
• During the parking sequence, continually check 
your surroundings. Be prepared to apply the brakes 
to avoid vehicles, pedestrians, or objects.
• When Autopark is active, monitor the touchscreen 
to ensure that you are aware of the instructions that 
Autopark is providing.
CAUTION: 
Autopark is particularly unlikely to operate as intended 
in these situations:
• The road is sloped. Autopark is designed to operate 
on flat roads only.
• Visibility is poor (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
• The curb is constructed of material other than 
stone, or the curb cannot be detected.
• The target parking space is directly adjacent to a 
wall or pillar (for example, the last parking space of 
a row in an underground parking structure).
• One or more of the sensors (if equipped) or 
cameras is damaged, dirty, or obstructed (such as 
by mud, ice, or snow, or by a vehicle bra, excessive 
paint, or adhesive products such as wraps, stickers, 
rubber coating, etc.).
• Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, fog, or 
extremely hot or cold temperatures) are interfering 
with sensor (if equipped) operation.
• The sensors (if equipped) are affected by other 
electrical equipment or electrical interference.

Autopark's ability to park Model 3. Keep this in mind 
and remember that as a result, Autopark may not steer 
Model 3 appropriately. Pay attention when parking 
Model 3 and stay prepared to immediately take control.
Summon
CAUTION: Summon's performance depends on the 
ability of the cameras and sensors (if equipped) to 
determine the vehicle's proximity to objects, people, 
animals, and other vehicles. Summon is unlikely to 
operate as intended in the following types of 
situations:
• The driving path is sloped. Summon is designed to 
operate on flat roads only (up to 10% grade).
• A raised concrete edge is detected. Summon does 
not move Model 3 over an edge that is higher than 
approximately 1 in (2.5 cm).

proper operation of Summon. It is the driver's 
responsibility to remain in control of Model 3 at all 
times. Pay close attention whenever Summon is 
actively moving Model 3 and stay prepared to take 
immediate action. Failure to do so can result in serious 
property damage, injury or death.
WARNING: Model 3 cannot detect obstacles that are 
located lower than the bumper, are very narrow, or are 
hanging from a ceiling (for example, bicycles). In 
addition, many unforeseen circumstances can impair 
Summon's ability to move in or out of a parking space 
and, as a result, Summon may not move Model 3 
appropriately. Therefore, you must continually monitor 
the vehicle's movement and its surroundings and 
remain prepared to stop Model 3 at any time.
Smart Summon
CAUTION: Smart Summon is a BETA feature. You must 
continually monitor the vehicle and its surroundings 
and stay prepared to take immediate action at any time. 
It is the driver's responsibility to use Smart Summon 
safely, responsibly, and as intended.
CAUTION: Smart Summon is designed and intended for 
use only on parking lots and driveways located on 
private property where the surrounding area is familiar 
and predictable. Do not use Smart Summon on public 
roads.
NOTE: Smart Summon is disabled if Model 3 is in Valet mode 
(see Valet Mode on page 90).
CAUTION: 
Smart Summon is unlikely to operate as intended in the 
following types of situations:
• GPS data is unavailable due to poor cellular 
coverage.
• The driving path is sloped. Smart Summon is 
designed to operate on flat roads only (up to 10% 
grade).
• A raised concrete edge is detected. Depending on 
the height of the concrete edge, Smart Summon 
may not move Model 3 over it.
• One or more of the sensors (if equipped) or 
cameras is damaged, dirty, or obstructed (such as 
by mud, ice, or snow, or by a vehicle bra, excessive

• Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, fog, or 
extremely hot or cold temperatures) are interfering 
with sensor (if equipped) or camera operation.
• The sensors (if equipped) are affected by other 
electrical equipment or devices that generate 
ultrasonic waves.
• Model 3 is in Trailer Mode or an accessory is 
attached
WARNING: The list above does not represent an 
exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with 
proper operation of Smart Summon. It is the driver's 
responsibility to remain in control of Model 3 at all 
times. Pay close attention whenever Smart Summon is 
actively moving Model 3 and stay prepared to take 
immediate action. Failure to do so can result in serious 
property damage, injury or death.
WARNING: Smart Summon must only be used on paved 
surfaces.
WARNING: Smart Summon may not stop for all objects 
(especially very low objects such as some curbs, or 
very high objects such as a shelf) and may not react to 
all traffic. Smart Summon does not recognize the 
direction of traffic, does not navigate around empty 
parking spaces, and may not anticipate crossing 
traffic.
WARNING: When using Smart Summon, you must 
maintain a clear line of sight between you and Model 3 
and stay prepared to stop the vehicle at any time by 
releasing the button on the mobile app.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Model 3 monitors the markers on the lane you are driving in 
as well as the surrounding areas for the presence of vehicles 
or other objects.
WARNING: Ensure all cameras are clean and free of 
obstructions before each drive and before using 
Autopilot features (see Cleaning a Camera on page 
190). Dirty cameras and sensors (if equipped), as well 
as environmental conditions such as rain and faded 
lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. If a 
camera is obstructed or blinded, Model 3 displays a 
message on the touchscreen and Autopilot features 
may not be available. For more information on specific 
alerts, see Troubleshooting Alerts on page 224.
WARNING: Lane Assist features are for guidance 
purposes only and are not intended to replace your 
own direct visual checks. Before changing lanes, 
always use side mirrors and perform the appropriate 
shoulder checks to visually determine if it is safe and 
appropriate to change lanes.
WARNING: Never depend on Lane Assist to inform you 
if you unintentionally drive outside of the driving lane, 
or to inform you that there is a vehicle beside you or in 
your blind spot. Several external factors can reduce the 
performance of Lane Assist (see Limitations and 
Inaccuracies on page 130). It is the driver's 
responsibility to stay alert and pay attention to the 
driving lane and other road users. Failure to do so can 
result in serious injury or death.
Steering Interventions
Lane Assist provides steering interventions if Model 3 drifts 
into (or close to) an adjacent lane in which an object, such as 
a vehicle, is detected. In these situations, Model 3 
automatically steers to a safer position in the driving lane. 
This steering is applied only when Model 3 is traveling 
between 30 and 85 mph (48 and 140 km/h) on major roads 
with clearly visible lane markings. When a steering 
intervention is applied, the touchscreen briefly displays a 
warning message.
Lane Departure Avoidance
Lane Departure Avoidance is designed to warn you if Model 3 
is drifting out of, or nears the edge of, your driving lane.
Lane Departure Avoidance operates when driving between 
40 and 90 mph (64 and 145 km/h) on roads with clearly 
visible lane markings. You can choose if and how you want 
Lane Departure Warning to operate by touching Controls > 
Autopilot > Lane Departure Avoidance and selecting between 
these options:
• Off: You are not warned of lane departures or potential 
collisions with a vehicle in an adjacent lane.
• Warning: If a front wheel passes over a lane marking, a 
blue indicator line appears on the touchscreen and the 
steering wheel vibrates. (For vehicles equipped with Full 
Self-Driving (Supervised): if a front wheel passes over a 
lane marking, the steering wheel vibrates.)
• Assist: A blue indicator line, corresponding to the line 
being crossed by the vehicle, appears on the 
touchscreen. Corrective steering is applied to keep Model 
3 in a safe position if Model 3 drifts into an adjacent lane 
or near the edge of the road.
When Lane Departure Avoidance is enabled and Traffic-
Aware Cruise Control is active, if Model 3 drifts out of the 
driving lane when the associated turn signal is off, Lane 
Assist also checks to see whether your hands are on the 
steering wheel. If hands are not detected, the touchscreen 
displays a series of alerts, similar to those that are used when 
driving with Autosteer. If hands are repeatedly not detected 
Model 3 gradually slows down to 15 mph (25 km/h) below the 
detected speed limit, or below the set cruising speed, and 
the hazard lights start flashing.
NOTE: Lane Departure Avoidance does not warn you of lane 
departures, or provide steering interventions, if the 
associated turn signal is on, which indicates an intentional 
lane change.
WARNING: Lane Departure Avoidance is intended to 
help keep you safe, but it does not work in every 
situation and does not replace the need to remain 
attentive and in control. 
WARNING: Keep your hands on the steering wheel and 
drive attentively at all times.
WARNING: Steering interventions are minimal and are 
not designed to move Model 3 out of its driving lane. 
Do not rely on steering interventions to avoid side 
collisions.
Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance
Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance automatically applies 
steering to avoid a potential collision in situations where:
• Model 3 is departing a lane and may collide with a vehicle 
traveling in the same direction in the adjacent lane 
(regardless of the status of the turn signal).
• Model 3 is departing a lane into an oncoming lane, the 
turn signal is off, and an oncoming vehicle is detected.
• Model 3 is departing the road and the turn signal is off 
(for example, very close to the edge of the road and a 
collision may occur).
To turn this feature on or off, touch Controls > Autopilot > 
Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance.
When Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance applies 
steering, a chime sounds and the touchscreen displays a 
warning and highlights the lane marking in red.
Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance operates when Model 
3 is traveling between 40 and 90 mph (64 and 145 km/h) on a 
road with clearly visible lane markings, curbs, etc.

Active Safety Features


WARNING: Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance is 
not a substitute for attentive driving and sound 
judgment. Keep your eyes on the road when driving 
and never depend on Emergency Lane Departure 
Avoidance to prevent a collision. Several factors can 
reduce or impair performance. Depending on 
Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance to prevent a 
potential collision can result in serious injury or death.
Blind Spot Assist
Automatic Blind Spot Camera
You can turn it on/off by touching Controls > Autopilot > 
Automatic Blind Spot Camera on the touchscreen.
Once enabled, when the turn signal is engaged, the 
touchscreen displays the image from the corresponding side 
repeater camera. When a vehicle is detected in your blind 
spot in an adjacent lane, a vertical red bar appears on the 
image to warn you. For example, when the left turn signal is 
engaged and a vehicle is detected, a vertical red bar appears 
on the left side of the image. You can move the image to a 
different location on the touchscreen. To do so, touch and 
drag the image to the new location (valid locations are 
indicated by shaded areas that display when you touch and 
hold the image).
WARNING: Automatic Blind Spot Camera does not 
eliminate the need to drive attentively and manually 
perform shoulder checks when changing lanes.
Blind Spot Collision Warning Chime
If you want a chime to sound when a vehicle is in your blind 
spot and a possible collision is detected, touch Controls > 
Safety > Blind Spot Collision Warning Chime.
WARNING: Blind Spot Camera does not eliminate the 
need to drive attentively and manually perform 
shoulder checks when changing lanes.
WARNING: Blind Spot Collision Warning Chime cannot 
detect every collision. It is the driver's responsibility to 
remain alert and perform the appropriate shoulder 
checks when changing lanes.
Blind Spot Warning Light
Both front door pillars are equipped with a blind spot warning 
light in the upper speaker grille. You can enable or disable the 
indicators by touching Controls > Safety > Blind Spot Warning 
Light. When a vehicle is detected in your blind spot in an 
adjacent lane a red light appears in the upper speaker grille.
• A solid red light indicates a vehicle has been detected in 
your blind spot.
• A blinking red light indicates that a vehicle is in your blind 
spot while the turn signal is indicating your intent to turn 
that direction.
• A rapid blinking red light indicates that a vehicle is 
detected and immediate corrective action is required to 
avoid a collision.
WARNING: Do not rely on Blind Spot Warning Light to 
detect a vehicle in your blind spot. Always visually 
confirm that a lane is free from obstacles and vehicles 
before exiting your lane.
Limitations and Inaccuracies
Lane Assist features cannot always detect lane markings and 
you may experience unnecessary or invalid warnings when:
• Visibility is poor and lane markings are not clearly visible 
(due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
• Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or direct 
sunlight) is interfering with the view of the camera(s).
• A vehicle in front of Model 3 is blocking the view of the 
camera(s).
• The windshield is obstructing the view of the camera(s) 
(fogged over, dirty, covered by a sticker, etc.).
• Lane markings are excessively worn, have visible previous 
markings, have been adjusted due to road construction, 
or are changing quickly (for example, lanes branching off, 
crossing over, or merging).
• The road is narrow or winding.
• Objects or landscape features are casting strong shadows 
on lane markers.
Lane Assist may not provide warnings, or may apply 
inappropriate warnings, when:
• One or more of the sensors (if equipped), or cameras is 
damaged, dirty, or obstructed (by mud, ice, or snow, or by 
a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or adhesive products such 
as wraps, stickers, rubber coatings, etc.).
• Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, fog, or extremely 
hot or cold temperatures) are interfering with sensor 
operation.

• The sensors (if equipped) are affected by other electrical 
equipment or devices that generate ultrasonic waves.
• An object that is mounted to Model 3 is interfering with 
and/or obstructing a sensor (such as a bike rack or a 
bumper sticker).
In addition, Lane Assist may not steer Model 3 away from an 
adjacent vehicle, or may apply unnecessary or inappropriate 
steering, in these situations:
• You are driving Model 3 on sharp corners or on a curve at 
a relatively high speed.
• Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or direct 
sunlight) is interfering with the view of the camera(s).
• You are drifting into another lane but an object (such as a 
vehicle) is not present.
• A vehicle in another lane cuts in front of you or drifts into 
your driving lane.
• Model 3 is not traveling within the speeds at which the 
Lane Assist feature is designed to operate.
• One or more of the sensors (if equipped) is damaged, 
dirty, or obstructed (such as by mud, ice, or snow, or by a 
vehicle bra, excessive paint, or adhesive products such as 
wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.).
• Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, fog, or extremely 
hot or cold temperatures) are interfering with sensor 
operation.
• The sensors (if equipped) are affected by other electrical 
equipment or devices that generate ultrasonic waves.
• An object mounted to Model 3 (such as a bike rack or a 
bumper sticker) is interfering with or obstructing a sensor.
• Visibility is poor and lane markings are not clearly visible 
(due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
• Lane markings are excessively worn, have visible previous 
markings, have been adjusted due to road construction or 
are changing quickly (for example, lanes branching off, 
crossing over, or merging).
CAUTION: Driver assistance features are automatically 
disabled when Track Mode is On. It is the driver’s 
responsibility to drive safely and be in control of the 
vehicle at all times, including on track. Driver 
Assistance features automatically re-enable when 
Track Mode is turned Off.
WARNING: The lists above do not represent every 
possible situation that may interfere with Lane Assist 
features. There are many reasons why Lane Assist may 
not operate as intended. To avoid a collision, stay alert 
and always pay attention to the road so you can 
anticipate the need to take corrective action as early as 
possible.

Active Safety Features


The following collision avoidance features are designed to 
increase the safety of you and your passengers:
• Forward Collision Warning - provides visual and audible 
warnings in situations when Model 3 detects that there is 
a high risk of a frontal collision (see Forward Collision 
Warning on page 132).
• Automatic Emergency Braking - automatically applies 
braking to reduce the impact of a collision (see Automatic 
Emergency Braking on page 133).
• Obstacle-Aware Acceleration - reduces acceleration if 
Model 3 detects an object in its immediate driving path 
(see Obstacle-Aware Acceleration on page 133).
CAUTION: Ensure all cameras are clean and free of 
obstructions before each drive and before using 
Autopilot features (see Cleaning a Camera on page 
190). Dirty cameras and sensors (if equipped), as well 
as environmental conditions such as rain and faded 
lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. If a 
camera is obstructed or blinded, Model 3 displays a 
message on the touchscreen and Autopilot features 
may not be available. For more information on specific 
alerts, see Troubleshooting Alerts on page 224.
WARNING: Forward Collision Warning is for guidance 
purposes only and is not a substitute for attentive 
driving and sound judgment. Keep your eyes on the 
road when driving and never depend on Forward 
Collision Warning to warn you of a potential collision. 
Several factors can reduce or impair performance, 
causing either unnecessary, invalid, inaccurate, or 
missed warnings. Depending on Forward Collision 
Warning to warn you of a potential collision can result 
in serious injury or death.
WARNING: Automatic Emergency Braking is not 
designed to prevent all collisions. In certain situations, 
it can minimize the impact of a collision by attempting 
to reduce your driving speed. Depending on Automatic 
Emergency Braking to avoid a collision can result in 
serious injury or death.
WARNING: Obstacle-Aware Acceleration is not 
designed to prevent a collision. In certain situations, it 
can minimize the impact of a collision. Depending on 
Obstacle-Aware Acceleration to avoid a collision can 
result in serious injury or death.
Forward Collision Warning
Model 3 monitors the area in front of it for the presence of an 
object such as a vehicle, motorcycle, bicycle, or pedestrian. 
If a collision is considered likely unless you take immediate 
corrective action, Forward Collision Warning is designed to 
sound a chime and highlight the vehicle in front of you in red 
on the touchscreen. If this happens, TAKE IMMEDIATE 
CORRECTIVE ACTION!
Visual and audible warnings cancel automatically when the 
risk of a collision has been reduced (for example, you have 
decelerated or stopped Model 3, or the object in front of your 
vehicle has moved out of your driving path).
If immediate action is not taken when Model 3 issues a 
Forward Collision Warning, Automatic Emergency Braking (if 
enabled) may automatically apply the brakes if a collision is 
considered imminent (see Automatic Emergency Braking on 
page 133).
By default, Forward Collision Warning is turned on. To turn 
off or adjust sensitivity, touch Controls > Autopilot > Forward 
Collision Warning. Instead of the default warning level of 
Medium, you can turn the warning Off, or you can choose to 
be warned Late or Early.
NOTE: Your chosen setting is retained until you manually 
change it.
WARNING: The camera(s) and sensors (if equipped) 
associated with Forward Collision Warning are 
designed to monitor an approximate area of up to 
525 feet (160 meters) in your driving path. The area 
being monitored by Forward Collision Warning can be 
adversely affected by road and weather conditions. 
Use appropriate caution when driving.
WARNING: Forward Collision Warning is designed only 
to provide visual and audible alerts. It does not attempt 
to apply the brakes or decelerate Model 3. When 
seeing and/or hearing a warning, it is the driver's 
responsibility to take immediate corrective action.
WARNING: Forward Collision Warning may provide a 
warning in situations where the likelihood of collision 
may not exist. Stay alert and always pay attention to 
the area in front of Model 3 so you can anticipate 
whether any action is required. 
Collision Avoidance Assist
132
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Forward Collision Warning operates only when driving 
between approximately 3 mph (5 km/h) and 124 mph (200 
km/h).
WARNING: Forward Collision Warning does not provide 
a warning when the driver is already applying the 
brake.
Automatic Emergency Braking
Model 3 is designed to determine the distance from detected 
objects. When a collision is considered unavoidable, 
Automatic Emergency Braking is designed to apply the 
brakes to reduce the vehicle's speed and therefore, the 
severity of the impact. The amount of speed that is reduced 
depends on many factors, including driving speed and 
environment.
When Automatic Emergency Braking applies the brakes, the 
touchscreen displays a visual warning and sounds a chime. 
You may also notice abrupt downward movement of the brake 
pedal. The brake lights turn on to alert other road users that 
you are slowing down.
Emergency braking in progress
Automatic Emergency Braking operates only when driving 
between approximately 3 mph (5 km/h) and 124 mph (200 
km/h).
Automatic Emergency Braking does not apply the brakes, or 
stops applying the brakes, when:
• You turn the steering wheel sharply.
• You press and release the brake pedal while Automatic 
Emergency Braking is applying the brakes.
• You accelerate hard while Automatic Emergency Braking 
is applying the brakes.
• The vehicle, motorcycle, bicycle, or pedestrian is no 
longer detected in the front or rear of the vehicle.
Automatic Emergency Braking is always enabled when you 
start Model 3. To disable for your current drive, shift into 
Park and touch Controls > Autopilot > Automatic Emergency 
Braking. Even if you disable Automatic Emergency Braking, 
your vehicle may still apply the brakes after detecting an 
initial collision to reduce further impact (see Multi-Collision 
Braking on page 133). When disabled, the touchscreen 
displays a visual message.
Automatic Emergency Braking is disabled
WARNING: It is strongly recommended that you do not 
disable Automatic Emergency Braking. If you disable it, 
Model 3 does not automatically apply the brakes in 
situations where a collision is considered likely.
NOTE: Automatic Emergency Braking is designed to reduce 
the impact of frontal collisions only.
NOTE: Automatic Emergency Braking is designed to reduce 
the impact of frontal and reverse collisions with limited 
functionality while in Reverse.
In the event Automatic Emergency Braking is unavailable, the 
touchscreen displays a visual warning.
Automatic Emergency Braking is not available
WARNING: Automatic Emergency Braking is designed 
to reduce the severity of an impact. It is not designed 
to avoid a collision.
WARNING: Several factors can affect the performance 
of Automatic Emergency Braking, causing either no 
braking or inappropriate or untimely braking, such as 
when a vehicle is partially in the path of travel or there 
is road debris. It is the driver’s responsibility to drive 
safely and remain in control of the vehicle at all times. 
Never depend on Automatic Emergency Braking to 
avoid or reduce the impact of a collision.
WARNING: Automatic Emergency Braking is not a 
substitute for maintaining a safe traveling distance 
between you and the vehicle in front of you.
WARNING: The brake pedal moves downward abruptly 
during automatic braking events. Always ensure that 
the brake pedal can move freely. Do not place material 
under or on top of the driver’s floor mat (including an 
additional mat) and always ensure that the driver’s floor 
mat is properly secured. Failure to do so can impede 
the ability of the brake pedal to move freely.
Multi-Collision Braking
In addition to Automatic Emergency Braking, Model 3 may 
apply the brakes to prevent or mitigate a subsequent impact 
after an initial collision if airbag deployment is detected. The 
brakes may be applied regardless of driving speed.
Obstacle-Aware Acceleration
Obstacle-Aware Acceleration is designed to reduce the 
impact of a collision by reducing motor torque and in some 
cases applying the brakes, if Model 3 detects an object in its 
driving path. The touchscreen displays a visual warning and 
sounds a chime when the brakes are automatically applied. 
For example, Model 3, while parked in front of a closed 
garage door with Drive engaged, detects that you have 
pressed hard on the accelerator pedal. Although Model 3 still 
accelerates and hits the garage door, the reduced torque may 
result in less damage.
Obstacle-Aware Acceleration is designed to operate only 
when all of these conditions are simultaneously met:
Collision Avoidance Assist

Active Safety Features


• Drive or Reverse is engaged.
• Model 3 is stopped or traveling less than 10 mph (16 
km/h).
• Model 3 detects an object in its immediate driving path.
To disable Obstacle-Aware Acceleration, touch Controls > 
Autopilot > Obstacle-Aware Acceleration.
WARNING: Obstacle-Aware Acceleration is designed 
to reduce the severity of an impact. It is not designed 
to avoid a collision.
WARNING: Obstacle-Aware Acceleration may not limit 
torque in all situations, such as performing a sharp turn 
into a parking space. Several factors, including 
environmental conditions, distance from an obstacle, 
and a driver's actions, can limit, delay, or inhibit 
Obstacle-Aware Acceleration.
WARNING: Do not rely on Obstacle-Aware 
Acceleration to control acceleration or to avoid, or 
limit, the severity of a collision, and do not attempt to 
test Obstacle-Aware Acceleration. Doing so can result 
in serious property damage, injury, or death.
WARNING: Several factors can affect the performance 
of Obstacle-Aware Acceleration, causing an 
inappropriate or untimely reduction in motor torque. It 
is the driver's responsibility to drive safely and remain 
in control of Model 3 at all times.
Limitations and Inaccuracies
Collision Avoidance features cannot always detect all 
objects, vehicles, bikes, or pedestrians, and you may 
experience unnecessary, inaccurate, invalid, or missed 
warnings for many reasons, particularly if:
• The road has sharp curves.
• Visibility is poor (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
• Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or direct 
sunlight) is interfering with the view of the camera(s).
• A camera or sensor is obstructed (dirty, covered, fogged 
over, covered by a sticker, etc.).
• One or more of the sensors (if equipped) is damaged, 
dirty, or obstructed (such as by mud, ice, or snow, or by a 
vehicle bra, excessive paint, or adhesive products such as 
wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.).
• Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, fog, or extremely 
hot or cold temperatures) are interfering with sensor 
operation.
• The sensors (if equipped) are affected by other electrical 
equipment or devices that generate ultrasonic waves.
CAUTION: If a fault occurs with a Collision Avoidance 
Assist feature, Model 3 displays an alert. Contact Tesla 
Service.
CAUTION: Driver assistance features are automatically 
disabled when Track Mode is On. It is the driver’s 
responsibility to drive safely and be in control of the 
vehicle at all times, including on track. Driver 
Assistance features automatically re-enable when 
Track Mode is turned Off.
WARNING: The limitations previously described do not 
represent an exhaustive list of situations that may 
interfere with proper operation of Collision Avoidance 
Assist features. These features may fail to provide their 
intended function for many other reasons. It is the 
driver’s responsibility to avoid collisions by staying 
alert, paying attention, and taking corrective action as 
early as possible.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


How Speed Assist Works
Model 3 displays a speed limit on the touchscreen and you 
can choose if and how you are warned when you exceed the 
speed limit. In addition, a blue outline may appear around the 
speed limit icon to notify that you are above the speed limit.
Instead of using the detected speed limit, you can base 
warnings on an arbitrary speed limit that you enter manually.
NOTE: When using Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, you can 
touch this speed limit sign to change your set cruising speed 
to the detected speed limit (including any offsets that you 
have set).
In situations where Model 3 is unable to determine a speed 
limit, or if Speed Assist is uncertain that an acquired speed 
limit is accurate, the touchscreen may not display a speed 
limit sign and warnings do not take effect.
NOTE: Speed limit warnings go away after ten seconds, or 
when Model 3 slows down below the specified limit.
WARNING: Do not rely on Speed Assist to determine 
the appropriate speed limit or driving speed. Always 
drive at a safe speed based on traffic and road 
conditions.
Controlling Speed Assist
To adjust the Speed Limit Warning setting, touch Controls > 
Autopilot > Speed Limit Warning, then choose one of these 
options:
• Off - Speed limit warnings do not display and chimes are 
not sounded.
• Display - Speed limit signs display on the touchscreen and 
the sign increases in size when you exceed the 
determined limit.
• Chime - In addition to the visual display, a chime is 
sounded when you exceed the determined speed limit.
You can also specify how the speed limit is determined:
• Relative - You can set a speed limit offset (+ or -) if you 
want to be alerted only when you exceed the offset speed 
limit by a specified amount. For example, you can increase 
the offset to +10 mph (10 km/h) if you only want to be 
warned when you exceed the speed limit by 10 mph (10 
km/h).
• Absolute - Manually specify any speed limit between 20 
and 140 mph (30 and 240 km/h).
NOTE: Speed Assist is not always accurate. In some 
situations, the location of a road can be miscalculated and 
Speed Assist can display a speed for a directly adjacent road 
that may have a different speed limit. For example, Speed 
Assist can assume Model 3 is on a controlled-access 
highway when it is actually on a nearby surface street, and 
vice versa.
NOTE: Your chosen setting is retained until you manually 
change it.
Limitations and Inaccuracies
Speed Assist may not be fully functional or may provide 
inaccurate information in these situations:
• Visibility is poor and speed limit signs are not clearly 
visible (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
• Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or direct 
sunlight) is interfering with the view of the camera(s).
• Model 3 is being driven very close to a vehicle in front of it 
which is blocking the view of the camera(s).
• The windshield is obstructing the view of the camera(s) 
(fogged over, dirty, covered by a sticker, etc.).
• Speed limit signs are concealed by objects.
• The speed limits stored in the map database are incorrect 
or outdated.
• Model 3 is being driven in an area where GPS or map data 
is not available or where speed limit signs can not be 
detected.
• Traffic signs that do not conform to standard recognizable 
formats, such as digital or temporary speed signs.
• A road or a speed limit has recently changed.
WARNING: The list above does not represent an 
exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with 
proper operation of Speed Assist. Speed Assist may 
fail to provide warnings for many other reasons.

Active Safety Features


Your Model 3 is equipped with a cabin camera located above 
the rear view mirror.
The cabin camera can determine driver inattentiveness and 
provide you with audible alerts, to remind you to keep your 
eyes on the road when Autopilot is engaged.
By default, images and video from the camera do not leave 
the vehicle itself and are not transmitted to anyone, including 
Tesla, unless you enable data sharing. If you enable data 
sharing and a safety critical event occurs (such as a 
collision), Model 3 shares short cabin camera video clips with 
Tesla to help us develop future safety enhancements and 
continuously improve the intelligence of features that rely on 
the cabin camera. Data may also be shared if diagnostics are 
required on cabin camera functionality. Cabin camera does 
not perform facial recognition or any other method of identity 
verification. To protect your privacy, cabin camera data is not 
associated with your vehicle identification number.
To adjust your data sharing preferences touch Controls > 
Software > Data Sharing > Allow Cabin Camera Analytics. You 
can change your data sharing settings at any time. To view 
features currently enabled that use cabin camera, touch 
Controls > Software > Cabin Camera.
NOTE: Keep the camera lens clean and free of obstructions. 
Remove any buildup of dirt or dust by occasionally wiping the 
camera lens with a clean cloth.
CAUTION: Do not use chemical-based or abrasive 
cleaners. Doing so can damage the surface of the 
camera lens.

About the Security System
If Model 3 does not detect an authenticated phone or key 
and a locked door or trunk is opened, an alarm sounds. The 
headlights and turn signals also flash. To deactivate the 
alarm, press any button on the mobile app or tap your key 
card against the card reader located just below the Autopilot 
camera on the driver's side door pillar.
To manually enable or disable the alarm system, touch 
Controls > Safety > Security Alarm. When enabled, Model 3 
activates its alarm one minute after you exit, the doors lock, 
and a recognized key is no longer detected.
A battery-backed siren (if equipped) sounds in situations 
where a locked door or trunk is opened and Model 3 does not 
detect a key nearby. If you also want this siren to sound in 
situations where the vehicle detects motion inside the cabin, 
enable Tilt/Intrusion (see Tilt/Intrusion (if equipped) on page 
137).
NOTE: If Model 3 is in Sentry Mode (see How to Use Sentry 
Mode (With a USB Flash Drive) on page 141), the Security 
Alarm setting is not available.
Tilt/Intrusion (if equipped)
Depending on configuration, market region, and date of 
manufacture, your vehicle may not be equipped with this 
feature.
The Security Alarm must be on to enable Tilt/Intrusion.
Tilt/Intrusion sounds the alarm in your vehicle if Model 3 
detects motion inside the cabin, or is moved or tilted (for 
example, with a tow truck or jack). To enable, touch Controls 
> Safety > Tilt/Intrusion.
The intrusion sensor automatically disables in situations 
where the climate control system is operating when you leave 
your vehicle. To override, you can manually turn the Tilt/
Intrusion Sensor on again after choosing Keep Climate On, 
Dog, or Camp Mode.
The tilt/intrusion sensor automatically re-enables at the start 
of every drive cycle.
NOTE: The Tilt/Intrusion alarm must be turned off to use 
Cabin Overheat Protection (see Cabin Overheat Protection on 
page 147).
NOTE: If you plan to leave something that moves inside your 
locked vehicle, remember to turn off Tilt/Intrusion. If this 
setting is on, any motion detected inside Model 3 activates 
the intrusion alarm.
NOTE: If Model 3 is in Sentry Mode (see How to Use Sentry 
Mode (With a USB Flash Drive) on page 141), the Tilt/
Intrusion setting is not available.

entered. To enable this setting, touch Controls > Safety > PIN 
to Drive and follow the on-screen prompts to create a driving 
PIN.
When enabled, in addition to entering the 4-digit driving PIN 
to drive, you must also use it to enter Valet mode for the first 
time and create the 4-digit valet PIN to enter and exit Valet 
mode. In Valet mode, Model 3 can be driven without the need 
for the valet to enter a driving PIN. The PIN to Drive setting is 
disabled whenever Valet mode is active.
If you forget your driving PIN, touch the link to enter your 
Tesla login credentials on the PIN to Drive popup, then follow 
the instructions on the touchscreen.
NOTE: In the unlikely event that your touchscreen is 
unresponsive, you may be unable to enter the PIN. In this

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, 
options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may 
not be equipped with Dashcam or the features may not 
operate exactly as described. It is your sole responsibility to 
consult and comply with all local regulations and property 
restrictions regarding the use of cameras.
Dashcam records video footage of your vehicle's 
surroundings while driving. Use Dashcam to record driving 
incidents or other notable events, like you would for an 
external dashcam on other vehicles.
The Dashcam icon is located in the app launcher. You can add 
the Dashcam app to the bottom bar for easy access (see 
Customizing My Apps on page 7). When Model 3 is in Park, 
touching the Dashcam icon displays the Viewer (see Viewing 
Video Recordings on page 143).
To protect your privacy, video recordings are saved locally to 
a formatted USB flash drive's onboard memory. Recordings 
are not sent to Tesla. Model 3 does not record videos when 
Dashcam is Off.
How to Use Dashcam
1. Format a USB flash drive. Dashcam requires a properly 
formatted USB drive inserted in your vehicle's USB port to 
store and retrieve footage. Vehicles manufactured 
beginning approximately 2020 are equipped with a pre-
formatted USB flash drive in the glove box. There are two 
ways to format the flash drive if needed:
◦ Format the flash drive with Model 3. Insert the flash 
drive into the USB port and navigate to Controls > 
Safety > Format USB Drive.
◦ Format the flash drive on a computer. See USB Drive 
Requirements for Recording Videos on page 143 for 
more information.
2. Insert the USB flash drive into your vehicle's USB port, 
preferably the one in the glovebox (if equipped).
NOTE: For some vehicles manufactured after 
approximately November 1, 2021, the center console USB 
ports may only support charging devices. Use the USB 
port inside the glove box for all other functions.
3. Enable Dashcam by touching Controls > Dashcam. 
Dashcam allows you to choose how and when footage is 
saved. You can choose between:
◦ Auto: Dashcam automatically saves a recording to the 
USB drive when Model 3 detects a safety-critical 
event, such as a collision or airbag deployment. When 
Auto is selected, detection can vary and is subject to 
your vehicle's power, sleep, and Autopilot state.
NOTE: Several factors determine whether Dashcam 
automatically saves a recording of a safety-critical 
event (for example, amount of force, whether or not 
airbags deploy, etc.). Do not rely on Dashcam to 
automatically record all safety-critical events.
◦ Manual: You must manually touch the Dashcam icon to 
save a recording of the most recent ten minutes of 
footage.
◦ On Honk: When you press the horn, Dashcam saves a 
recording of the most recent ten minutes of footage. 
You can enable this along with Auto or Manual 
simultaneously.
4. Once enabled, the Dashcam icon indicates when footage 
is saved. You can also view the status of the Dashcam 
icon in Controls:
The icon changes to show the status of Dashcam:
RECORDING: Dashcam is recording. To 
save video footage, touch the icon. To 
pause recording, press and hold the icon.
AVAILABLE: Dashcam Is available but not 
actively recording. Touch the dashcam icon 
to start recording footage.
PAUSED: Dashcam is paused. To resume 
recording, touch the icon. To avoid losing 
video footage, pause Dashcam before 
removing the flash drive.
BUSY: Dashcam is in the process of 
loading, saving, or overwriting footage. 
While dashcam is busy, footage is not being 
captured and recorded.
SAVED: Footage is saved. You can also 
save Dashcam clips by touching the 
Dashcam icon in the app launcher while 
Driving.
5. When your desired footage is saved, view the clips on the 
touchscreen or a computer:
◦ Touchscreen: Ensure Model 3 is in Park and touch the 
Dashcam icon in the app launcher. Videos are 
organized by timestamp. See Viewing Video 
Recordings on page 143 for more information.
◦ Computer: Insert the USB flash drive into a computer 
and navigate to the TeslaCam folder. Videos are 
organized by timestamp. See Viewing Video 
Recordings on page 143 for more information.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, 
options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may 
not be equipped with Sentry Mode or the features may not 
operate exactly as described. It is your sole responsibility to 
consult and comply with all local regulations and property 
restrictions regarding the use of cameras.
When enabled, your vehicle's cameras and sensors (if 
equipped) remain powered on and ready to record suspicious 
activity around your vehicle when Model 3 is locked and in 
Park. Think of Sentry Mode as an intelligent vehicle security 
system that alerts you when it detects possible threats 
nearby.
If a threat is detected or the vehicle sensors determine there 
is a lot of jerky movement like when getting towed or shaken, 
Sentry Mode:
• Pulses the headlights.
• Sounds the alarm.
• Displays a message on the touchscreen that indicates 
cameras may be recording to inform individuals outside of 
the vehicles.
• Alerts you of the alarm on the mobile app.
• Saves footage of the event to a USB drive (if installed).
Sentry Mode is disabled by default. You can use voice 
commands or the Tesla mobile app to easily enable or disable 
Sentry Mode. To enable Sentry Mode using voice commands, 
say "Keep Tesla safe," "Keep my car safe," "Sentry on," or 
"Enable Sentry" (see Voice Commands on page 18).
NOTE: For some vehicles manufactured after approximately 
November 1, 2021, the center console USB ports may only 
support charging devices. Use the USB port inside the glove 
box for all other functions.
Sentry Mode requires your Battery to be at least 20% 
charged. If the Battery falls below 20%, Sentry Mode turns 
off and the mobile app sends you a notification. Power 
consumption may increase when Sentry Mode is active.
NOTE: When Sentry Mode is enabled, the Security Alarm 
settings (Controls > Safety > Security Alarm) are not 
available.
CAUTION: Do not rely on Sentry Mode to protect 
Model 3 from all possible security threats. Sentry 
Mode uses many factors to determine whether to 
activate the security alarm. All impacts may not be 
detected and the alarm may not activate in all 
situations. While it may help deter some threats, no 
security system can prevent all attacks.
NOTE: Sentry Mode only sends notifications to the mobile 
app when the alarm is triggered or sudden jerky motions are 
detected by the vehicle. If Sentry Mode doesn't consider an 
event a clear threat, the vehicle records footage but doesn't 
trigger the alarm.
How to Use Sentry Mode (With a USB 
Flash Drive)
1. Sentry Mode requires a properly formatted USB drive 
inserted in your vehicle's USB port. Vehicles 
manufactured beginning approximately 2020 are 
equipped with a pre-formatted USB flash drive in the 
glove box. There are two ways to format the USB drive:
◦ Insert the USB drive into the USB port and navigate to 
Controls > Format USB Drive. Your vehicle 
automatically formats the USB drive for you.
◦ Format the USB drive on a computer. See USB Drive 
Requirements for Recording Videos on page 143 for 
more information.
2. Insert the USB drive into the vehicle's USB port, 
preferrable the one in the glove box (if equipped).
3. With your vehicle in Park, enable Dashcam by navigating 
to Controls > Safety > Dashcam (Dashcam must be 
enabled for Sentry Mode to work).
4. Touch Controls > Sentry Mode > On. Once enabled, the 
Sentry Mode icon in Controls turns red.
NOTE: Rear camera recordings are available only on 
vehicles manufactured after approximately February 
2018.
When enabled, Sentry Mode is idle, ready to sound the 
alarm and save a recording of the security event if 
triggered. See Viewing Video Recordings on page 143 
for information on viewing footage.
5. To silence the security alarm and audio system when the 
alarm is triggered, navigate to Controls > Safety > Disable 
Sentry Sounds. When enabled, Sentry Mode still sends a 
notification through the mobile app and saves the last 10 
minutes footage.
6. To manually enable/disable Sentry Mode until the next 
drive, touch the Sentry Mode icon. Sentry Mode is Off 
when the icon is no longer red.
Turn Sentry Mode Off in Controls > Safety > Sentry Mode 
to disable for more than one drive cycle.

How to Use Sentry Mode (Without a 
USB Flash Drive)
When Sentry mode is enabled and a security event is 
detected but without a USB drive plugged into a USB port, 
your vehicle alerts you through the mobile app, without any 
camera recordings.
Sentry Mode Settings
• Exclude specific locations
In Controls > Safety > Sentry Mode, you can determine if 
you want Sentry Mode to not enable in certain locations 
(see Home, Work, and Favorite Destinations on page 157 
for more information):
◦ Exclude Home: Sentry Mode does not automatically 
enable at the location set as Home in your Favorites 
list.
◦ Exclude Work: Sentry Mode does not automatically 
enable at the location set as Work in your Favorites list.
◦ Exclude Favorites: Sentry Mode does not automatically 
enable at any location in your Favorites list.
NOTE: To recognize a location listed as Home, Work, or 
a Favorite, Model 3 must be parked within 
approximately 1,640 feet (500 meters) of the saved 
location.
To set up your Home or Work location, touch Navigate > 
Set Home/Set Work. To set up a Favorite, touch the star 
when viewing an address on the map. Manually turning 
Sentry Mode on or off using the touchscreen or the 
mobile app overrides your Home, Work, or Favorite 
exclusion preferences until your next drive.
• Set Camera-Based Detection
When Camera-Based Detection is enabled, Sentry Mode 
uses the vehicle’s external cameras in addition to vehicle 
sensors to detect a security event while parked. If 
disabled, your vehicle only saves clips to the USB drive if 
a physical threat is detected. To adjust, touch Controls > 
Safety > Sentry Mode > Camera-Based Detection.
• View Live Camera
NOTE: View Live Camera requires premium connectivity 
and version 4.2.1 (or newer) of the Tesla mobile app 
installed on a phone that has been paired as a key to 
Model 3.
When Sentry Mode is enabled, use the mobile app to 
remotely view the area surrounding Model 3 as seen 
through the exterior cameras. To enable, touch Controls > 
Safety > Sentry Mode > View Live Camera via Mobile App 
on the touchscreen to see what Sentry Mode records in 
real-time. Ensure there are no occupants in the vehicle 
and all doors are locked. Then, on the mobile app, 
navigate to Safety > Sentry Mode > View Live Camera.
When View Live Camera is actively in use, Model 3 
periodically flashes its exterior lights and displays a 
message on the touchscreen to notify others that the area 
surrounding the vehicle is being viewed through the 
cameras.
View Live Camera is limited to approximately one hour (or 
15 minutes for some regions) of cumulative usage per day.
If Model 3 is equipped with a pedestrian warning speaker 
(see Pedestrian Warning System on page 93), you can 
press and hold the microphone button on the mobile app 
to transmit your voice through this speaker.
You can also enable Dog Mode at the same time and 
switch the live camera view to see through the interior 
camera on the mobile app. See Keep Climate On, Dog, 
and Camp on page 146 for more information. This feature 
is not supported in vehicles with Autopilot computer 2.0 
or 2.5. Touch Controls > Software > Autopilot computer to 
find out which computer your vehicle has.
NOTE: If Dog and Sentry are enabled at the same time, 
Sentry defaults to Disable Sentry Sounds to protect your 
pet.
NOTE: Video quality can vary depending on network 
connectivity. No audio is captured.
NOTE: The live camera feed is fully encrypted and cannot 
be accessed by Tesla.
See Viewing Video Recordings on page 143 for more 
information on viewing Sentry Mode footage.
NOTE: When the internal storage reaches full capacity, new 
recordings overwrite the older recordings.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Some features require you to use a USB drive (for example, 
Dashcam, Sentry Mode and Track Mode, if equipped,) that 
meet these requirements:
• Minimum storage capacity of 64 GB. Use a USB drive with 
as much available storage as possible. Video footage can 
occupy a large amount of space.
• A sustained write speed of at least 4 MB/s. Note that 
sustained write speed differs from peak write speed.
• USB 2.0 compatible. If using a USB 3.0 drive, it must also 
support USB 2.0.
• Properly formatted (either automatically or manually on 
page 143).
NOTE: The USB-C ports in the center console and below the 
rear touchscreen do not support the ability to format, save,

Automatically Formatting a USB Drive
Insert the USB drive into a front USB port that supports the 
ability to format, save, and view video footage (see Interior 
Electronics on page 11). Then, touch Controls > Safety > 
Format USB Drive. This automatically formats the USB drive 
as exFAT and creates folders for TeslaCam and 
TeslaTrackMode (if equipped). The USB drive is now ready to 
record and save video footage.
Format USB Drive is available only when a USB drive (with one 
or fewer partitions) is inserted into a front USB port. 
Choosing Format USB Drive erases any existing content on 
the USB drive. Before using this feature, move any content 
you want to keep to a different device.
Manually Formatting a USB Drive
If Model 3 is unable to format the USB drive, format it using a 
computer:
1. Format the USB drive as exFAT, MS-DOS FAT (for Mac), 
ext3, or ext4 (NTFS is currently not supported).
2. Create a base-level folder titled TeslaCam. For Track 
Mode (if equipped), create another base-level folder 
called TeslaTrackMode. You can use one USB drive for 
Dashcam, Sentry Mode, Track Mode (if equipped), and 
audio files, but you must create separate partitions or 
folders on the exFAT USB drive.
3. Once formatted, insert the USB drive into the glovebox 
USB port (if equipped), otherwise use a front USB port in 
the center console. Do not use a rear USB port because 
they can only charge devices. It may take a few seconds 
for Model 3 to recognize the USB drive.
4. Once recognized, ensure icons for Dashcam and Sentry 
Mode are available when you touch Controls. Model 3 is 
now ready to record videos.
NOTE: You may need to first enable Sentry Mode (if 
equipped) by touching Controls > Sentry.
Viewing Video Recordings
If footage is saved, you can view the clips on the touchscreen 
or a computer.
When the USB drive runs out of storage space, video footage 
can no longer be saved. To prevent the USB drive from 
getting full, regularly move saved videos to another device 
and delete them from the USB drive.
When enabled, Dashcam and Sentry Mode records footage in 
cycles. Footage is continuously overwritten unless you save 
it. You must save your desired footage to view it, otherwise 
the footage is erased and overwritten. See Sentry Mode on 
page 141 and Dashcam on page 139 for information on saving 
footage. Four videos are recorded for each saved clip, one 
from each camera (front, rear, left, and right).
NOTE: Rear camera recordings are only available on vehicles 
manufactured after approximately February 2018.
Viewing on the Touchscreen
You can view recorded footage on the touchscreen when 
Model 3 is in Park. Touch the Dashcam icon located in the 
app launcher. The tabs display a list of all video clips, 
organized by location and timestamp. Pause, rewind, fast 
forward, and delete clips as needed. Swipe to the right or 
press and hold to quickly delete certain clips.
Navigate to Controls > Safety > Delete Dashcam Clips to 
delete all Dashcam and Sentry Mode footage.
NOTE: Dashcam recording pauses when you launch the 
Viewer.
Viewing on a Computer
Insert the USB drive into a computer and navigate to the 
TeslaCam or TeslaTrackMode (if equipped) folder.
The TeslaCam folder contains these sub-folders:
• RecentClips: Contains up to 60 minutes of recorded 
content.
• SavedClips: Contains all recordings that are saved and 
renamed from the RecentClips folder.
• SentryClips: Contains recordings from all Sentry Mode 
security events. If storage space on the USB drive 
becomes limited, the oldest Sentry Clips are deleted to 
provide space for new ones. Once deleted, you cannot 
retrieve them.

Keep Climate On, Dog, and Camp
The Keep Climate On, Dog, and Camp settings allow you to 
keep the climate control system running when in Park, even 
after you've left Model 3 or choose to stay inside the vehicle. 
These settings are useful when it is important to maintain the 
cabin temperature in hot or cold weather conditions. For 
example, when leaving groceries in Model 3 on hot days, you 
may want to use Keep Climate On to prevent spoilage.
Dog is designed to maintain a comfortable cabin temperature 
for your pet while you actively and frequently monitor this 
temperature using the mobile app (which requires both your 
phone and the vehicle to have cellular connectivity). When in 
Dog, the touchscreen displays the current cabin temperature 
to inform people passing by that your pet is safe. This setting 
is not intended for people, and should only be used for short 
periods of time while you stay in close proximity should you 
need to return to the vehicle in situations where the 
temperature can no longer be maintained.
NOTE: To avoid accidentally pressing the window switch 
(such as your dog stepping on it), the windows cannot be 
rolled down while Dog is enabled.
NOTE: If Dog and Sentry are enabled at the same time, Sentry 
defaults to Disable Sentry Sounds to protect your pet. See 
Sentry Mode on page 141 for more information.
Live Camera view is now available if Sentry Mode or Dog 
Mode, or both, are enabled. When Sentry Mode is on, the 
cameras show a live view of the vehicle's surroundings. When 
Dog Mode is on, the interior cabin camera shows the inside 
of the vehicle so you can check on your pet at any time. If 
both are enabled, switch the camera views by touching the 
gray circles or the interior icon that correspond to different 
cameras on the mobile app. See Sentry Mode on page 141 for 
more information.
NOTE: Enabling the interior cabin camera for Dog or Sentry 
Mode requires the mobile app version 4.15.0 or higher. This 
feature is not supported in vehicles with Autopilot computer 
2.0 or 2.5. Touch Controls > Software > Autopilot computer 
to find out which computer your vehicle has.
NOTE: View Live Camera is limited to approximately one hour 
(or 15 minutes for some regions) of cumulative usage per day.
Camp allows you to power electronics through the USB ports 
and low voltage outlet in addition to maintaining the cabin 
temperature. The touchscreen remains on so you can play 
music, browse the internet, play games in the arcade, or 
watch shows in Tesla Theater. You can also control media and 
climate settings from a paired phone. Camp is ideal for 
remaining inside your vehicle, such as camping or staying 
with a child. While active, Sentry Mode and the vehicle alarm 
system are disabled. Walk-Away Door Lock is inactive.
To operate Keep Climate On, Dog, or Camp:
1. Make sure the Battery's charge level is at least 20%.
2. Engage Park. The Keep Climate On, Dog, and Camp 
settings are available only when Model 3 is in Park.
3. If necessary, adjust the climate settings.
4. On the climate controls screen, touch Keep Climate On, 
Dog, or Camp.
NOTE: You can also control Dog and Camp from the 
mobile app, by swiping up from the gray bar on the 
Climate screen.
The climate control system attempts to maintain your climate 
settings until you shift out of Park or manually turn it off. 
Avoid using Keep Climate On, Dog, or Camp when the 
Battery's charge level is low.
Dog cannot be enabled if the cabin temperature is too hot, or 
if the vehicle detects an issue with the climate control 
system. Ensure that the cabin temperature is at a safe and 
comfortable level before enabling Dog.
If Keep Climate On, Dog, or Camp are on, the Tesla mobile 
app attempts to repeatedly send notifications reminding you 
to check on anything that you have left in Model 3 if:
• The Battery's charge level drops below 20%.
• The vehicle detects an issue with the climate control 
system.
• If the cabin temperature drifts significantly from the level 
set for dog.

expected, avoid using Keep Climate On, Dog, and 
Camp. Never rely on your vehicle to protect something 
irreplaceable.
WARNING: You can adjust and monitor the climate 
control system remotely using the mobile app. 
However, if you use the mobile app to turn off the 
climate control system, Keep Climate On, Dog, and 
Camp stop operating.
Cabin Overheat Protection
Cabin Overheat Protection prevents the cabin from getting 
too hot in scorching ambient conditions. While not necessary 
to activate whenever you leave Model 3, the climate control 
system can reduce and maintain the temperature of your 
vehicle’s cabin. This can prevent the cabin from getting too 
hot after leaving it parked in the sun, making the vehicle more 
comfortable when you return. Cabin Overheat Protection 
may take up to 15 minutes to enable once you exit the 
vehicle. This feature is intended for passenger comfort and 
has no impact on the reliability of your vehicle's components.
To turn on, touch Controls > Safety > Cabin Overheat 
Protection and choose:
• On: The air conditioning operates when the cabin 
temperature exceeds 105° F (40° C), or the selected 
temperature if available, on the touchscreen or mobile 
app. Customizing temperatures may require the most 
recent version of the mobile app.
• No A/C: Only the fan operates to prevent touch surfaces 
from getting too hot.
• Off: Disables Cabin Overheat Protection.
You can also enable Cabin Overheat Protection remotely 
through the mobile app by touching Climate. Swipe up on the 
bottom menu and select a setting under Cabin Overheat 
Protection (see Mobile App on page 51).
Cabin Overheat Protection operates until 12 hours has 
elapsed once you exit Model 3, or until the Battery energy 
drops below 20%, whichever comes first. Using Cabin 
Overheat Protection requires energy from the Battery, which 
may decrease range.
WARNING: Due to automatic shut-off, extreme outside 
conditions, or other potential inability to maintain the 
selected temperature, the inside of the vehicle can 
become dangerously hot, even when Cabin Overheat 
Protection is enabled. If you experience temperatures 
exceeding the selected temperature repeatedly, 
contact Tesla service.
WARNING: Never leave children or pets in the vehicle 
unattended. Due to automatic shut-off or extreme 
outside conditions, the inside of the vehicle can 
become dangerously hot, even when Cabin Overheat 
Protection is enabled.
Climate Control Operating Tips
• When you use the mobile app to turn on the climate 
control system, it automatically turns off when the charge 
level drops to 20%, or if two hours has passed. To cool or 
heat the cabin for a longer period of time, charge the 
vehicle and re-enable your climate control preference 
through the mobile app.
• You may hear the sound of the climate system inside the 
cabin of Model 3 when Parked. It makes a low fan noise. 
The climate system attempts to dry itself out to minimize 
additional moisture or musty odors. This is a normal 
operation and not a cause for concern.
• You can improve the efficiency of the cabin heating by 
reducing your selected acceleration mode (see 
Acceleration Modes on page 85). This allows the heat 
pump system to take more heat from the Battery to 
efficiently heat the cabin, instead of maintaining the 
Battery's ability to provide peak acceleration 
performance. This helps to maximize driving efficiency in 
colder weather. Note that when subsequently increasing 
the acceleration mode, the Battery requires time to warm 
up before the increased level of acceleration is available.
• Your charge port latch may freeze in extremely cold 
weather or icy conditions. In cases where you cannot 
remove or insert the charge cable, or your vehicle is not 
Supercharging due to the latch being frozen in place, 
enable Defrost Car in the mobile app. This helps thaw ice 
on the charge port latch so the charge cable can be 
removed or inserted. See Cold Weather Best Practices on 
page 151 for more information.
• If the climate control system is louder than you prefer, 
manually reduce the fan speed.
• In addition to cooling the interior, the air conditioning 
compressor also cools the Battery. Therefore, in hot 
weather, the air conditioning compressor can turn on even 
if you turned it off. This is normal because the system’s 
priority is to cool the Battery to ensure it stays within an 
optimum temperature range to support longevity and 
optimum performance.
• Even when not in use, you may hear Model 3 emit a 
whining noise or the sound of water circulating. These 
sounds are normal and occur when the internal cooling 
systems turn on to support various vehicle functions, 
such as maintaining the low voltage battery and balancing 
the temperature of the high voltage Battery.
Operating Climate Controls
147
Climate


• To ensure the climate control system operates efficiently, 
close all windows and ensure that the exterior grille in 
front of the windshield is free of ice, snow, leaves, and 
other debris.
• In very humid conditions, it is normal for the windshield to 
fog slightly when you first turn on the air conditioning.
• It is normal for a small pool of water to form under Model 
3 when parked. Extra water produced by the 
dehumidifying process is drained underneath.
• Model 3 is designed to automatically maximize efficiency; 
therefore, your air conditioning compressor and external 
fan may run and make noise even when the outside 
temperature is cold and your vehicle is heating or 
supercharging.
• To reduce the temperature in the cabin in hot weather 
conditions, the fan may turn on to vent the cabin when the 
vehicle is parked. This occurs only if the battery's charge 
level is above 20%.

direction of the air flow, touch and drag the radiating air waves from the corresponding vent on the touchscreen. The air flows 
in a single stream when centered or splits into mirrored air streams when air is directed outward or inward from the center of 
the vent.
NOTE: When you split a vent into two separate air flows, the air flow in each direction is not as strong as when all air is flowing 
in a single direction.
NOTE: Outside air is drawn into Model 3 through the grill in front of the windshield. Keep the grill clear of obstructions, such as 
leaves and snow.
Cabin Air Filter(s)
Model 3 has one or more air filters to prevent pollen, industrial fallout, road dust and other particles from entering through the 
vents.
NOTE: Cabin air filter(s) require periodic replacement. See Service Intervals on page 181.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


To ensure that Model 3 provides you with the best ownership 
experience possible in harsh cold weather conditions, follow 
these best practices.
Before Driving
When snow and ice accumulate on your vehicle, moving 
parts, such as the door handles, windows, mirrors, and 
wipers can freeze in place. To achieve maximum range and 
performance, it is helpful to warm the cabin and Battery 
before driving. There are several ways to do so:
• Touch Controls > Schedule (also available on both the 
charging and climate control screens) to set a time when 
you want your vehicle to be ready to drive (see Scheduled 
Precondition and Charge on page 176).
• In the mobile app, navigate to Climate to customize the 
temperature at which you want to heat the cabin. This also 
warms the high voltage Battery as needed.
• In the mobile app, navigate to Climate > Defrost Car to 
melt snow, ice, and frost on the windshield, charge port, 
windows, and mirrors. This also warms the high voltage 
Battery as needed.
NOTE: Tesla recommends activating climate settings at 
least 30-45 minutes before departure (see Operating 
Climate Controls on page 144). Preconditioning times 
depend on outside temperature and other factors. The 
mobile app will notify you once your vehicle has reached 
the desired preconditioning temperature.
Charge Port
If your charge port latch freezes in place and a charging cable 
becomes stuck in the charge port, try manually releasing the 
charge cable. See Manually Releasing Charge Cable on page 
174.
In extremely cold weather or icy conditions, it is possible that 
your charge port latch may freeze in place. In these weather 
conditions, you can thaw ice on the charge port latch so the 
charge cable can be removed and inserted. To do so, enable 
Defrost Car using the mobile app. 
You can also prevent the occurrence of a charge port latch 
freezing in place by using the Schedule settings (see 
Scheduled Precondition and Charge on page 176).
NOTE: If your charge port latch is frozen in place, it may not 
lock the charging cable in place when inserted, but it can still 
charge at a slow AC rate even if the latch is not engaged.
Charging
By using Trip Planner (if available) to navigate to a Tesla 
charging location, Model 3 pre-heats the high voltage 
Battery to ensure when you arrive at the charger, the 
temperature of the Battery is optimal and ready to charge. 
This reduces the amount of time it takes to charge. See (see 
Trip Planner on page 159).
NOTE: Tesla recommends using Trip Planner to navigate to a 
charging location for at least 30-45 minutes before arrival to 
ensure optimal Battery temperature and charging conditions. 
If the drive to the charging location is less than 30-45 
minutes, consider preconditioning the Battery before driving 
(see Before Driving on page 151).
NOTE: The thermal system may produce steam under certain 
conditions for vehicles equipped with a heat pump (to 
determine if your vehicle has a heat pump, touch Controls > 
Software > Additional Vehicle Information). For example, 
odorless steam can come from the front of your vehicle while 
charging at a Supercharger in cold temperature. This is 
normal and not a cause for concern.
Windows
In the mobile app, go to Climate and select Defrost Car, 
which helps melt snow, ice, and frost on the windshield, 
windows, and mirrors.
In cold temperatures, Model 3 automatically makes a slight 
adjustment to the position of the windows to make it easier to 
open doors.
NOTE: Always connect to an external, low voltage power 
supply before opening a door when the vehicle has no power 
to avoid breaking a window.
Use the mobile app to schedule a service appointment for 
Tesla to provide hydrophobic coating to the side and rear 
windows (not the front windshield) for a nominal fee.
Doors
In severe winter conditions, ice buildup can make it more 
difficult to open door handles. You can use the mobile app to 
pop open the driver door in this situation.
1. In the mobile app, touch and hold any of the four quick 
control buttons and follow the instructions to customize 
quick controls with Unlatch Door.
2. When you are next to your car, touch Unlatch Door to pop 
open the driver door.
Removing Ice From Door Handle
In severe winter conditions, ice buildup within the door 
handle can prevent the door handle from opening. The 
process for freeing a Model 3 door handle is slightly different 
than others to remove ice buildup.
NOTE: Preemptively applying WD-40 to the door handle 
pivot pins can help prevent ice buildup inside your door 
handle.
CAUTION: Do not attempt to use tools or excessive 
force to release the door handle from ice buildup.
If your vehicle's door handles are black: Perform the following 
to remove ice from the door handle:
Cold Weather Best Practices
151
Climate


1. Forcefully press the frontmost part of the door handle. It 
will rock slightly inward to help break the ice.
2. Press the rearmost part of the door handle to try to open 
as you normally would.
3. Once the door handle is able to move, open and close it a 
few more times to release any remaining ice buildup. 
Make sure the door handle is fully pressed in (retracted) 
prior to entering the vehicle, and check that the door is 
fully closed before driving away.
If your vehicle's door handles are silver: You can usually 
remove the ice with a few forceful bumps to the door handle 
using the bottom of your fist. Perform the following to 
remove ice from the door handle:
CAUTION: Remove any jewelry or objects that can 
damage the paint prior to performing the procedure, 
and do not attempt to use tools or excessive force.
1. Forcefully press the rearmost part of the door handle to 
try to open the door handle.
2. Working in a circular pattern around the perimeter of the 
door handle, use the bottom of your fist to forcefully 
bump the door handle to break and release the ice 
buildup.
3. Aiming for the rearmost end of the wide part of the door 
handle, use the bottom of your fist to forcefully bump the 
door handle. Increase the intensity of the bumps as 
necessary, repeating steps 1 through 3 until the ice is 
removed and the door handle can be opened.
CAUTION: Never bump the vehicle so hard as to 
cause a dent; the force used should be similar to 
knocking on your neighbor’s front door.
4. Once the door handle is able to move, open and close it a 
few more times to release any remaining ice buildup. 
Make sure the door handle is fully pressed in (retracted) 
prior to entering the vehicle, and check that the door is 
fully closed before driving away.
Mirrors
If ice buildup is expected when parking, turn off Auto-Fold 
Mirrors. Touch Controls > Auto-Fold. Ice can prevent exterior 
side mirrors from folding or unfolding.
NOTE: Side mirrors automatically heat as needed during 
preconditioning, or when the rear defroster is turned on.
Wipers
If you expect snow or ice to build up when parked, touch 
Controls > Service > Wiper Service Mode. This raises the 
wipers against the windshield so they can defrost when the 
windshield defrosts (see Wipers and Washers on page 75). 
You can also turn on wiper defrosters (if equipped). See 
Operating Climate Controls on page 144.
Tires and Tire Chains
Use winter tires to increase traction in snowy or icy 
conditions. You can purchase winter tires on the Tesla Shop 
(see Seasonal Tire Types on page 188).
Tire chains provide additional traction when driving in snowy 
or icy conditions. Check local regulations to determine if tire 
chains are recommended or required during winter months. 
See Using Tire Chains on page 188 for more information.
Cold Weather Best Practices
152
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Your vehicle’s tire pressures will drop in cold ambient 
temperatures. If the TPMS indicator light appears, inflate the 
tires before driving. The tires will lose one PSI for every 10° F 
(6° C) drop in outside temperature (see Tire Care and 
Maintenance on page 183). Proper tire pressures help 
protect tires from potholes and improve range when properly 
inflated.
While Driving
Cold weather can increase energy consumption because 
more power is required for driving, cabin and Battery heating. 
Follow these suggestions to reduce energy consumption:
• Use seat heaters to keep warm. Seat heaters use less 
energy than the cabin heater. Lowering the cabin 
temperature and using seat heaters reduces energy 
consumption (see Operating Climate Controls on page 
144).
• Slow down your driving and avoid frequent and rapid 
acceleration.
Regenerative Braking
Regenerative braking can be limited if the Battery is too cold. 
As you continue to drive, the Battery warms up and 
regenerative power increases (see Regenerative Braking on 
page 78).
NOTE: Limited regenerative braking can be avoided if you 
allow enough time to precondition your vehicle or if you use 
Schedule to precondition Model 3 before your departure time 
(see Scheduled Precondition and Charge on page 176).
NOTE: Installing winter tires can result in temporarily reduced 
regenerative braking power but after a short period of 
driving, Model 3 recalibrates to correct this. Touch Service > 
Wheel & Tire > Tires to select winter tires and quicken this 
process.
Cold Battery
A blue snowflake icon appears on your touchscreen 
when some of the stored energy in the Battery is 
unavailable because the Battery is cold. This portion 
of unavailable energy displays in blue on the Battery 
meter. Regenerative braking, acceleration, and 
charging rates may be limited. The snowflake icon no 
longer displays when the Battery is sufficiently warm.
After Driving
Leave Model 3 plugged in when not in use. This uses the 
charging system, rather than the Battery itself, to keep the 
Battery warm (see High Voltage Battery Information on page 
168).
Scheduled Precondition
When parked, use the Controls > Schedule settings, available 
on both the charging and climate control screens, to set a 
time when you want to precondition Model 3 (see Scheduled 
Precondition and Charge on page 176). You can also use 
Schedule to prevent the charge port latch freezing in place. 
Your vehicle determines the appropriate time to begin 
preconditioning so that cabin and Battery are warm by your 
planned departure time.
Tesla recommends that you also schedule a charge with your 
precondition to ensure that your vehicle has sufficient energy 
for the trip. When Model 3 is not plugged in, preconditioning 
operates but only when the Battery's charge level is above 
20%.
Storage
If you leave Model 3 parked for an extended period of time, 
plug the vehicle into a charger to prevent normal range loss 
and to keep the Battery at an optimal temperature. Your 
vehicle is safe to stay plugged in for any length of time.
When not in use, Model 3 enters a sleep mode to conserve 
energy. Reduce the number of times you check your vehicle’s 
status on the mobile app, as this automatically wakes up your 
vehicle and starts normal energy consumption.
Cold Weather Best Practices

Climate


To ensure that Model 3 provides you with the best ownership 
experience possible in hot ambient conditions, follow these 
best practices.
Before Driving
There are several ways to prepare your vehicle for a drive, 
without having to get into an already hot vehicle:
• Precondition the cabin by moving the direction of air flow 
from the vents, and turn the seat heaters on or off. In the 
mobile app, navigate to Climate to customize the 
temperature at which you want to cool the cabin.
• Touch Schedule, available on both the Charging and 
Climate Control screens, to set a time when you want your 
vehicle to be ready to drive (see Scheduled Precondition 
and Charge on page 176).
• Enable Cabin Overheat Protection, which prevents the 
cabin from getting too warm in hot ambient conditions. 
You can choose whether you want the A/C or just the fan 
to run when the temperature in the cabin exceeds 105° F 
(40° C) or the selected temperature (if available).
• In the mobile app, navigate to Controls to vent the 
windows.
NOTE: Tesla recommends activating climate settings at least 
30-45 minutes before departure (see Operating Climate 
Controls on page 144). Preconditioning times depend on 
outside temperature and other factors. The mobile app will 
notify you once your vehicle has reached the desired 
preconditioning temperature.
After Driving
Leave Model 3 plugged in when not in use, especially if using 
Preconditioning or Cabin Overheat Protection. This uses the 
charging system, rather than the battery itself, to maintain a 
comfortable temperature (see High Voltage Battery 
Information on page 168). In addition, there are several ways 
to minimize a hot cabin:
• Before leaving your vehicle (to run errands, for example), 
use Dog Mode to keep the cabin cool for pets or 
perishable goods. See Keep Climate On, Dog, and Camp 
on page 146 for more information.
• Tesla recommends turning the air conditioning off 
approximately 30 seconds before pressing Park to reduce 
puddling below the vehicle.
• Park in the shade to help reduce power consumption and 
maintain cooler cabin temperatures.
• Use a sun shade (available on the Tesla Shop) if you have 
to park outside in the sun.
• When parked, plug in Model 3 and Schedule your 
charging. Your vehicle determines the appropriate time to 
begin charging so it is complete during off-peak hours. 
The cabin and Battery are also prepared by your set 
departure time. For more information, see Scheduled 
Precondition and Charge on page 176.
Charging
When using Trip Planner or navigating to a Supercharger 
station, your vehicle automatically prepares the Battery for 
most efficient charging. In extreme heat, you may not see the 
message that the vehicle is preconditioning the Battery while 
navigating to a Supercharger, but it is still preparing the 
Battery for charging.
NOTE: Tesla recommends using Trip Planner to navigate to a 
charging location for at least 30-45 minutes before arrival to 
ensure optimal Battery temperature and charging conditions. 
If the drive to the charging location is less than 30-45 
minutes, consider preconditioning the Battery before driving 
(see Before Driving on page 151).
If possible, leave your vehicle plugged into a charger 
whenever not in use, even in warm weather, especially if 
using Preconditioning or Cabin Overheat Protection.
Storage
If you leave Model 3 parked for an extended period of time, 
plug the vehicle into a charger to prevent normal range loss 
and to keep the Battery at an optimal temperature. Your 
vehicle is safe to stay plugged in for any length of time.
When not in use, Model 3 enters a sleep mode to conserve 
energy. Reduce the number of times you check your vehicle’s 
status on the mobile app, as this automatically wakes up your 
vehicle and starts normal energy consumption.

Predicting Energy Usage
When navigating to a destination, Model 3 helps you 
anticipate your charging needs by calculating the amount of 
energy that remains when you reach your destination. When 
navigating, the map displays this calculation next to the 
Battery icon on the turn-by-turn direction list (see Navigating 
to a Destination on page 156). When the turn-by-turn 
direction list is compressed, touch the top of the list to 
expand it.
The calculation that predicts how much energy you will use is 
an estimate based on driving style (predicted speed, etc.) 
and environmental factors (wind speed and direction, 
ambient and forecasted temperatures, air density and 
humidity, etc.). As you drive, Model 3 continuously learns 
how much energy it uses, improving accuracy over time. 
Model 3 predicts energy usage based on the driving style of 
the individual vehicle. For example, if you drive aggressively 
for a period of time, future range predictions will assume 
higher consumption. Some factors that contribute to 
predicted energy (such as forecasted temperatures and wind 
speed) are available only when Model 3 has internet 
connectivity.
NOTE: If you purchase a used Tesla vehicle, it is 
recommended that you perform a factory reset (Controls > 
Service > Factory Reset) to ensure the predicted energy is as 
accurate as possible.
Throughout your route, Model 3 monitors energy usage and 
updates the estimate of energy remaining at the end of your 
trip. A popup warning displays on the turn-by-turn direction 
list in these situations:
• A yellow warning displays when you have very little 
energy remaining to reach your destination, requiring you 
to drive slowly to conserve energy. For tips on conserving 
energy, see Getting Maximum Range on page 178.
• A red warning displays when you must charge to reach 
your destination.
To determine if you have enough energy for a round trip, 
touch the Battery icon on the turn-by-turn direction list to 
display an estimated calculation of your round trip energy 
usage.
Online Routing
Model 3 detects real-time traffic conditions and 
automatically adjusts the estimated driving and arrival times. 
In situations where traffic conditions may delay your 
estimated time of arrival and an alternate route is available, 
the navigation system can reroute you to your destination. To 
decline the alternate route, tap the reroute notification on 
your touchscreen. You can also specify the minimum number 
of minutes that must be saved before you are rerouted. Turn 
this feature on or off by touching Controls > Navigation > 
Online Routing.
If available in your region and Online Routing is enabled, real-
time traffic condition icons display along navigation routes 
when detected (Premium Connectivity required).
NOTE: Supported traffic icons vary by region.

Trip Planner
Trip Planner (if available in your region) helps you take longer 
road trips with confidence. If reaching your destination 
requires charging, Trip Planner routes you through the 
appropriate Supercharger locations. Trip Planner selects a 
route and provides charging times to minimize the amount of 
time you spend driving and charging. To enable Trip Planner, 
touch the map's settings icon (see Navigation Settings on 
page 155), then touch Trip Planner.
When Trip Planner is enabled and charging is required to

by-turn direction list may display an alert indicating that 
charging is needed to reach your destination. To add 
Supercharger stops back to the turn-by-turn direction list, 
touch Add charging stops.
While charging at a Supercharger, the charging screen 
displays the remaining charging time needed to drive to your 
next Supercharger stop or destination (if no further charging 
is needed). If you charge for a shorter or longer length of 
time, charging time at subsequent Supercharger stops is 
adjusted accordingly. You can also use the mobile app to 
monitor remaining charging time needed.
NOTE: When navigating to a Supercharger or, in some 
regions, a third-party fast charger using Trip Planner, Model 
3 may allocate some energy to pre-heat the Battery to arrive 
at the Supercharger or third-party fast charger with an 
optimal Battery temperature. This reduces charging time (see 
Charging on page 151).
If Trip Planner estimates that you won't have enough energy 
for your round trip, and there are no Superchargers available 
on your route, Trip Planner displays an alert at the top of the 
turn-by-turn direction list notifying you that charging is 
needed to reach your destination.
NOTE: If a Supercharger on your navigation route 
experiences an outage, Trip Planner displays a notification 
and attempts to reroute you to a different Supercharger 
location.

Charging equipment designed specifically to charge your 
Model 3 is available from Tesla.
For information on the charging equipment available for your 
region, go to http://shop.tesla.com.
• A Wall Connector, which installs in your parking space, is 
the fastest way to charge your vehicle for daily use.
• A Mobile Connector allows you to plug into most 
commonly used power outlets. When using the Mobile 
Connector, attach the smart adapter (if required) to the 
Mobile Connector before plugging it in to the power 
outlet, and then plug in your vehicle.
• Tesla also offers adapters that allow you to plug into the 
most commonly used public charging stations in your 
region. At a public charge station, first attach the adapter 
to the station's charging connector and then plug in your 
vehicle.
Electric Vehicle Components
167
Charging and Energy Consumption


Model 3 has one of the most sophisticated battery systems in 
the world. The most important way to preserve the high 
voltage Battery is to LEAVE YOUR VEHICLE PLUGGED IN 
when you are not using it. This is particularly important if you 
are not planning to drive Model 3 for several weeks.
NOTE: When left idle and unplugged, your vehicle 
periodically uses energy from the Battery for system tests 
and recharging the low voltage battery when necessary.
There is no advantage to waiting until the Battery’s level is 
low before charging. In fact, the Battery performs best when 
charged regularly.
NOTE: If you allow the Battery to discharge to 0%, other 
components may become damaged or require replacement 
(for example, the low voltage battery). In these cases, you are 
responsible for repair and/or transporting expenses. 
Discharge-related expenses are not covered by the warranty 
or under the Roadside Assistance policy.
The peak charging rate of the Battery may decrease slightly 
after a large number of DC Fast Charging sessions, such as 
those at Superchargers. To ensure maximum driving range 
and Battery safety, the Battery charge rate is decreased 
when the Battery is too cold, the Battery’s charge is nearly 
full, and when the Battery conditions change with usage and 
age. These changes in the condition of the Battery are driven 
by battery physics and may increase the total Supercharging 
duration by a few minutes over time. You can minimize the 
amount of charge time by using Trip Planner (if available in 
your market region) to warm the Battery while driving to a 
Supercharger. See Trip Planner on page 159 for more 
information.
Battery Care
Never allow the Battery to fully discharge.
Even when Model 3 is not being driven, its Battery 
discharges very slowly to power the onboard electronics. The 
Battery can discharge at a rate of approximately 1% per day, 
though the discharge rate may vary depending on 
environmental factors (such as cold weather), vehicle 
configuration, and your selected settings on the 
touchscreen. Situations can arise in which you must leave 
Model 3 unplugged for an extended period of time (for 
example, at an airport when traveling). In these situations, 
keep the 1% in mind to ensure that you leave the Battery with 
a sufficient charge level. For example, over a two week period 
(14 days), the Battery may discharge by approximately 14%.
Discharging the Battery to 0% may result in damage to 
vehicle components. To protect against a complete 
discharge, Model 3 enters a low-power consumption mode 
when the displayed charge level drops to approximately 0%. 
In this mode, the Battery stops supporting the onboard 
electronics and auxiliary low voltage battery. Once this low-
power consumption mode is active, immediately plug in 
Model 3 to prevent a jump start and low voltage battery 
replacement.
NOTE: If Model 3 is unresponsive and does not unlock, open, 
or charge, the low voltage battery may be discharged. In this 
situation, try jump starting the low voltage battery (see Jump 
Starting on page 222). If the vehicle is still unresponsive, use 
the mobile app to schedule a service appointment.
Temperature Limits
For better long-term performance, avoid exposing Model 3 
to ambient temperatures above 140° F (60° C) or below 
-22° F (-30° C) for more than 24 hours at a time.
Energy Saving Feature
Model 3 has an energy-saving feature that reduces the 
amount of energy being consumed by the displays when 
Model 3 is not in use. On newer vehicles, this feature is 
automated to provide an optimal level of energy saving. 
However, on older vehicles, you can control the amount of 
energy being consumed by the displays by touching Controls 
> Display > Energy Saving. For more information on 
maximizing range and saving energy, see Getting Maximum 
Range on page 178.
Submerged Vehicle
As with any vehicle, if your Tesla has been exposed to 
flooding, extreme weather events or has otherwise been 
submerged in water (especially in salt water), treat it as if it’s 
been in an accident and contact your insurance company for 
support. Do not attempt to operate the vehicle before Tesla 
Service has inspected it, but you should tow or move it away 
from any structures.
NOTE: Damage caused by water is not covered under 
warranty.
Battery Warnings and Cautions
WARNING: The high voltage system must be serviced 
only by a trained technician. Under no circumstances 
should you open or tamper with the Battery. Do not 
disassemble, remove or replace high voltage 
components, cables or connectors. High voltage 
cables are typically colored orange for easy 
identification.
CAUTION: If the Battery’s charge level falls to 0%, you 
must plug it in. If you leave it unplugged for an 
extended period, it may not be possible to charge or 
use Model 3 without jump starting or replacing the low 
voltage battery. Leaving Model 3 unplugged for an 
extended period can also result in permanent Battery 
damage. If you are unable to charge Model 3 after 
attempting to jump start the low voltage battery, 
schedule a service appointment.
CAUTION: The Battery requires no owner maintenance. 
Do not remove the coolant filler cap and do not add 
fluid. If the touchscreen warns you that the fluid level is 
low, use the mobile app to schedule a service 
appointment.

Charging and Energy Consumption


Opening the Charge Port
The charge port is located on the left side of Model 3, behind 
a door that is part of the rear tail light assembly. Park Model 3 
to ensure that the charge cable easily reaches the charge 
port.
With Model 3 in Park, press and release the button on the 
Tesla charge cable to open the charge port door.
You can also open the charge port door using any of these 
methods:
• On the touchscreen, touch Controls and touch the Charge 
Port icon (lightning bolt).
• On the touchscreen, navigate to Controls > Charging > 
Open Charge Port.
• Press the bottom of the charge port door when Model 3 is 
unlocked and an authenticated phone is nearby.
• When the vehicle is locked with an authenticated key in 
range, you can also press the button on the charge cable 
to open the charge port door (see Keys on page 21).
• Use voice commands to open the charge port door (see 
Voice Commands on page 18). You can also use voice 
commands to close the charge port door, and begin or 
stop charging.
NOTE: The following image is provided for demonstration 
purposes only. Depending on market region and date of 
manufacture, your charge port may be slightly different.
NOTE: The Tesla "T" lights up when you open the charge port 
door. If you do not insert a charge cable into the charge port 
within a few minutes after opening the charge port door, the 
charge port door closes. If this happens, use the touchscreen 
to open the charge port door again.
NOTE: In extremely cold weather or icy conditions, it is 
possible that your charge port latch may freeze in place. 
Some vehicles are equipped with a charge port inlet heater 
that turns on when you turn on the rear defrost in cold 
weather conditions. You can also thaw ice on the charge port 
latch by enabling preconditioning using the mobile app. To 
prevent this from occurring, use the Schedule settings (also 
available on both the charging and climate control screens), 
to set a time when you want your vehicle to be ready to drive 
(see Scheduled Precondition and Charge on page 176).
CAUTION: Do not try to force the charge port door 
open.
Plugging In
If desired, use the touchscreen to change the charge limit 
and the charging current (see Charge Settings on page 172).
To charge at a public charging station, plug the appropriate 
adapter into the vehicle's charging port, and then connect 
the station's charging connector to the adapter. The most 
commonly used adapter(s) for each market region are 
provided. Depending on the charging equipment you are 
using, you may need to start and stop charging using a 
control on the charging equipment.
If you are using the Mobile Connector, plug into the power 
outlet before plugging in Model 3.
Align the connector to the charge port and insert fully. When 
the connector is properly inserted, charging begins 
automatically after Model 3:
• Engages a latch that holds the connector in place;
• Shifts into Park (if it was in any other drive mode);
Charging Instructions
170
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


• Heats or cools the Battery, if needed. If the Battery 
requires heating or cooling, you may notice a delay before 
charging begins.
NOTE: Whenever Model 3 is plugged in but not actively 
charging, it draws energy from the charging equipment 
instead of using energy stored in the Battery. For example, if 
you are sitting in Model 3 and using the touchscreen while 
parked and plugged in, Model 3 draws energy from the 
charging equipment instead of the Battery.
In some cases when Model 3 is plugged in but using very 
little energy, however, it may draw it directly from the Battery. 
For example, if you leave Model 3 plugged in for several days 
without using it, it may gradually draw a small amount of 
energy directly from the Battery to support vehicle systems.
Once the Battery discharges enough, it starts charging to 
reach the limit again. Depending on when you check, the 
Battery may not have discharged enough yet to trigger a 
charge cycle. As a result, it may be slightly under the charge 
limit even after being plugged in for a long period. This is 
normal, and Model 3 will start charging again once it has 
discharged enough. Alternatively, to start a new charge cycle 
manually, unplug and then plug in Model 3.
CAUTION: The connector end of the charge cable can 
damage the paint if you drop it onto Model 3.
Charge Port Light
After you insert a charge cable into Model 3, wait a few 
seconds and confirm that the charge port light begins 
blinking green and that your vehicle is charging. If the light is 
amber or red, troubleshoot the issue before you leave to 
ensure a successful charging session.
• WHITE (OR LIGHT BLUE): The charge port door is open. 
Model 3 is ready to charge and the connector is not 
inserted, or the charge port latch is unlocked and the 
connector is ready to be removed.
NOTE: If equipped with an early generation charge port, 
the charge port remains unlocked whenever the vehicle is 
not charging and in a cold ambient temperature below 41° 
F (5° C). In this situation, the charge port light is white.
• BLUE: The charger is connected, but Model 3 is not 
charging (such as when scheduled charging is active).
• BLINKING BLUE: Model 3 is communicating with the 
charger, but has not started charging yet (such as when 
your vehicle is preparing to charge).
• BLINKING GREEN: Charging is in progress. As Model 3 
approaches a full charge, the frequency of the blinking 
slows.
• SOLID GREEN: Charging is complete.
• SOLID AMBER: The connector is not fully plugged in. 
Realign the connector to the charge port and insert fully.
• BLINKING AMBER: Model 3 is charging at a reduced 
current (AC charging only).
• RED: A fault is detected and charging has stopped. Check 
the touchscreen for an alert.
Charging Status
Charging status displays at the top of the car status screen 
when the charge port door is open.
1. Time remaining: The estimated time remaining to charge 
to your set limit (see Charge Settings on page 172).
NOTE: When charging to 100%, the vehicle may continue 
to charge with low power when charging is displayed as 
complete. This is expected operation. Because the added 
energy beyond this point is low, it is usually not beneficial 
to continue charging.
2. Charging: The current power of the charger.
3. Charging rate: The maximum current available from the 
attached charge cable.
4. Range gained: Estimated increase in driving distance 
achieved in the charging session.

Controls > Display > Energy Display.
6. Charge status: Charge status messages (such as 
Supercharging, Scheduled Charging) display here (see 
Scheduled Precondition and Charge on page 176).
During Charging
During charging, the charge port light (the Tesla "T" logo) 
pulses green, and the touchscreen displays real-time 
charging status. The frequency at which the green charge 
port light pulses slows down as the charge level approaches 
full. When charging is complete, the light stops pulsing and is 
solid green.
NOTE: If Model 3 is locked, the charge port light does not 
light up.
If the charge port light turns red while charging, a fault is 
detected. Check the touchscreen for an alert describing the 
fault. A fault can occur due to something as common as a 
power outage. If a power outage occurs, charging resumes 
automatically when power is restored.
NOTE: The thermal system may produce steam under certain 
conditions for vehicles with heat pumps (to determine if your 
vehicle has a heat pump, touch Controls > Software > 
Additional Vehicle Information). For example, odorless steam 
can come from the front of your vehicle while charging at a 
Supercharger in cold temperature. This is normal and not a 
cause for concern.
NOTE: It is normal to hear sounds during charging. 
Particularly at high currents, the refrigerant compressor and 
fan operate as needed to keep the Battery cool.
Charging Instructions

Charging and Energy Consumption


NOTE: Air conditioning performance is generally not affected 
by charging. However, in some circumstances (for example, 
charging at high currents during a particularly warm day), the 
air coming from the vents may not be as cool as expected 
and a message displays on the touchscreen. This is normal 
and ensures that the Battery stays within an optimum 
temperature range while charging to support longevity and 
optimum performance.
WARNING: Never spray liquid at a high velocity (for 
example, a pressure washer) towards the charge port 
while charging. Doing so can result in serious injury or

Charge Port to open the charge port door or to unlock the 
charge cable from the charge port. You can also touch the 
lightning icon near the charge port on the car status 
overview. Use Stop Charging when you are finished 
charging.
NOTE: In cold ambient temperatures below 41° F (5° C), 
the charge port (if equipped with early generation charge 
port hardware) remains unlocked whenever the vehicle is 
not charging.
• Schedule: Displays the precondition and charging 
schedule. You can create a precondition or charge 
schedule for your saved home and work locations, or your 
current location (see Scheduled Precondition and Charge 
on page 176).
• Charge on Solar at this location: If available in your region, 
setup your vehicle with your Tesla Powerwall to charge 
from excess solar production, using the Tesla mobile app. 
When your vehicle is plugged in at home and Charge on 
Solar is enabled, your vehicle charges up to the minimum 
charge limit from any source and then continues charging 
on only excess solar power up to the maximum charge 
limit. If a scheduled charge or precondition is configured, 
your vehicle uses any excess solar and waits until the 
designated time to charge from any source to the 
minimum charge limit. System requirements: Vehicle 
software 2023.26 or higher, Powerwall software 23.12.10 
or higher and Tesla mobile app 4.22.5 or higher. System 
requirements outside of North America: Vehicle software 
2023.32 or higher, Powerwall software 23.12.10 or higher 
and Tesla mobile app 4.30.5 or higher.
• Supercharging: Displays Supercharger usage fees, the 
location, the time that charging started, and a cost 
estimate for the session (see Supercharger Fees on page 
173).
NOTE: To reduce congestion at high-usage Supercharger 
sites, you may be limited to a maximum charge of 80% 
when not using Trip Planner (if available in your market 
region). See Trip Planner on page 159).
Supercharger Fees
When charging at a Tesla Supercharger, information about 
the charging session displays at the bottom of the charging 
screen. This includes the location, the time that charging 
started, and a cost estimate for the session. When you stop 
Supercharging, the estimated cost of the session displays 
until a new Supercharging session begins.
NOTE: Estimated cost may not reflect the final cost of the 
Supercharging session. Final pricing for Supercharging 
sessions can be found in your Tesla account.
You are subject to additional fees after charging is complete 
or, at a busy Supercharger location, after your vehicle has 
reached the congestion limit. Superchargers are designed for 
fast charging, and these fees encourage drivers to move their 
vehicles when charging is complete. The rate structure for 
each site, including whether idle or congestion fees apply, 
can be found on the site’s popup on the touchscreen (see 
Charging Locations on page 158) or in the Tesla mobile app.
• Idle fees apply when half or more of the Superchargers at 
a site are occupied, and begin accruing when the vehicle 
reaches its charge limit. The Tesla mobile app notifies you 
when charging is almost complete, and again when 
charging is complete. Additional notifications are sent if 
idle fees are incurred. Idle fees are waived if you move 
your vehicle within five minutes of when charging 
completed.
• United States only: Congestion fees apply at select 
Supercharger locations that are often busy. Congestion 
fees accrue when the station is at capacity and the 
vehicle’s battery charge level is above the congestion 
limit. Fees are waived for the first five minutes, and then 
billed until the vehicle is moved.
Log into your Tesla account to view fees and details about 
Supercharger sessions, set up a payment method, and make 
payments. Once a payment method is saved, fees are 
automatically paid from your account.
Third Party Chargers
Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, etc., all 
Tesla vehicles have a North American Charging Standard 
(NACS) charge port, which is a charging system developed 
by Tesla that is quickly becoming more popular at third party 
charging stations. These stations feature an NACS connector 
and don't require a separate adapter.
Charging Instructions
173
Charging and Energy Consumption


While all Tesla vehicles can charge on Tesla stations (such as 
a Supercharger, Wall Connector, or Mobile Connector), your 
vehicle may not have the hardware needed to use some 
NACS third-party DC fast charging stations. In other words, 
the connector may look compatible, but when you plug it into 
Model 3, your vehicle does not charge. This is because 
Model 3 needs to also support a CCS communication 
protocol (a commonly used charging system for some third 
party chargers) in order to charge at third-party DC fast 
chargers with NACS connector.
NOTE: An adapter is required to charge at third-party 
stations with a CCS connector and your vehicle's hardware 
may need a retrofit to support CCS communication protocol.
To see if your vehicle can already communicate with CCS, 
navigate to Controls > Software > Additional Vehicle 
Information > CCS and 3rd-party NACS DC Fast Charging 
Support:
CCS charger:
NACS charger:
• Enabled: Model 3 supports the CCS communication 
protocol and can charge at any CCS station (adapter 
required) and third party NACS station.
• Not enabled: Your vehicle currently does not support the 
CCS communication protocol for NACS and CCS 
charging stations. Use the mobile app to see if you are 
eligible to schedule a service appointment to enable this 
through a hardware retrofit. Availability of this retrofit may 
vary.
• Not compatible: Model 3 cannot support the CCS 
communication protocol and cannot charge at third party 
NACS or CCS charging stations.
Manually Releasing Charge Cable
If the usual methods for releasing a charge cable from the 
charge port (using the charge handle release button, 
touchscreen, or mobile app) do not work, carefully follow 
these steps:
1. Ensure that Model 3 is not actively charging by displaying 
the charging screen on the touchscreen. If necessary, 
touch Stop Charging.
2. Open the rear trunk.
3. Pull the charge port's release cable downwards to unlatch 
the charge cable.
WARNING: Do not pull the release cable while 
simultaneously attempting to remove the charge 
cable from the charge port. Always pull the release 
cable before attempting to remove the charge 
cable. Failure to follow these instructions can result 
in electric shock and serious injury.
NOTE: The release cable may be recessed within the 
opening of the trim.
4. Pull the charge cable from the charge port.
CAUTION: Use the release cable only in situations 
where you can not release the charge cable using the 
usual methods. Continuous use can damage the 
release cable or charging equipment.
WARNING: Do not perform this procedure when your 
vehicle is charging, or if any orange high voltage 
conductors are exposed. Failure to follow these 
instructions can result in electric shock and serious 
injury or damage to the vehicle. If you are uncertain as 
to how to safely perform this procedure, contact your 
nearest Service Center.
Charging Best Practices
• Avoid allowing the Battery to get too low (the Battery icon 
turns yellow when the capacity remaining in the Battery 
drops to 20% or below).
• Refer to the information on the vehicle touchscreen 
(navigate to Controls > Charging) or the mobile App 
(touch the Charging icon) for recommended daily and trip 
charging limits.
Charging Instructions
174
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


• After you plug in your vehicle, confirm that the charge 
port light begins blinking green (indicating that Model 3 is 
charging) before you walk away. If Model 3 does not begin 
charging after a few seconds, the connector may not be 
fully inserted into the charge port, or there may be an 
issue preventing charging. Check the touchscreen for an 
alert with more information.
NOTE: If the charge port light begins blinking amber, 
Model 3 is charging at a reduced current. If the charge 
port light is solid blue, the charger is connected but the 
vehicle is not charging (such as when a charge is 
scheduled). For more information, see Charge Port Light 
on page 171.
Fast charging tips:
• Find fast chargers by filtering for three lightning bolts in 
the navigation search bar.
• Navigate to fast chargers to allow for preconditioning of 
the high voltage Battery. An optimal Battery temperature 
can help speed up charging.
• Typically, a lower state of charge results in faster 
charging.
NOTE: It is your responsibility to monitor your vehicle's 
charge at all times. Do not wait until the vehicle is 
discharged to plug it in. Always ensure you have more 
than enough charge to safely get to a charger.
• At Superchargers, leave some space between other 
vehicles, as neighboring stalls may share power.
Charging Instructions
175
Charging and Energy Consumption


Schedule preconditioning and charging for Model 3. You can 
schedule preconditioning to help your vehicle charge more 
efficiently, or to prepare Model 3 for departure.
NOTE: You can also access Schedule from the Climate 
Controls screen, the Charging window, and the Tesla mobile 
app (v4.34.5 or higher required).
Model 3 automatically saves your schedule for each location 
you create a schedule at. When you select Current Location, 
the configured schedule can only be used when you return to 
the same approximate physical location.
NOTE: Scheduled charge cannot be used with fast chargers, 
including Tesla Superchargers. Charging schedules you 
create are ignored when you charge at a fast charger.
Create a Schedule
Create a Precondition and Charge schedule to specify the 
time and days you want Model 3 to precondition or charge. 
To create a schedule:
1. Touch Controls > Schedule.
2. Select the location for which you want to configure a 
schedule.
◦ Current Location: The current location of your car, 
based on your GPS coordinates.
NOTE: You must be parked to create a schedule for 
your current location.
◦ Home/Work: The saved location for your home and 
workplace. You can't choose these options if you don't 
have a saved home or work (see Home, Work, and 
Favorite Destinations on page 157).
3. Touch Precondition to configure the time and the 
frequency you want the vehicle to precondition by.
4. Touch Charge to configure the time you want to start and 
stop, and the frequency you want to charge.
5. Select Create to create the schedule.
NOTE: If Repeat Weekly is not toggled, Model 3 performs the 
schedule once. The vehicle then disables the schedule until 
you manually re-enable the schedule.
Using Scheduled Charging
When you create or enable a scheduled charge, you can plug 
in your vehicle for a charge. If you scheduled a precondition 
or charge for later in the day, Model 3 waits until that time to 
precondition or charge.
When your schedules overlap, the vehicle uses the largest 
block of time for charging, if necessary. Example: You 
scheduled Model 3 to start charging at 2 AM and at 3 AM, 
but to stop charging at 2:30 AM and 5 AM, the vehicle 
combines the two charge schedules into a single block from 
2 AM to 5 AM.
When you specify an End by time, but not a Start at time, the 
vehicle briefly draws power when plugging in for scheduled 
charging (you may hear clicking) to calculate the necessary 
start time to meet your charge limit. Example: You configure 
an End by time of 2 AM and the vehicle needs 2 hours to 
charge to meet the charge limit. If you plug in your vehicle at 
9 PM, Model 3 briefly draws power to calculate the start time 
and begins charging at 12 AM.
If you specify a Start at time and no End by time, the vehicle 
begins charging at the specified time and continues until 
your charge limit is reached.
There are scenarios where Scheduled Charging starts 
immediately. These scenarios can occur when Model 3 is 
plugged in:
• During a scheduled charge.
• Up to 6 hours after the start of a scheduled charge, if 
there is no specified End by time.
• When the next scheduled charge is more than 18 hours 
away and not the current day.
• When you haven't configured a Start at time and there is 
not enough time to reach the charge limit by the End by 
time.
NOTE: Model 3 does NOT automatically start charging if you 
plug in your vehicle within 6 hours after the End by time of a 
scheduled charge, unless there is another scheduled charge.
You can schedule your charge to finish right at a planned 
departure time to reduce energy costs, even in market 
regions where off-peak utility rates are not applicable. 
Example, if charging starts as soon as you plug in, charging 
may complete much sooner. This causes the Battery to cool 
down to ambient temperatures and requires energy to warm 
it back up by your departure time. Therefore, even if off-peak 
utility rates are not applicable to you, Tesla recommends that 
you charge until your planned departure time in order to 
reduce energy consumption by specifying your departure 
time as the scheduled End by time.
Preconditioning
Use Precondition to schedule a time when you want Model 3 
to be ready to drive. Model 3 automatically calculates when it 
needs to start preconditioning. This ensures that the cabin 
climate and Battery are preconditioned by your departure 
time.
Precondition warms the Battery for improved performance 
and ensures a comfortable cabin climate at your set 
departure time. If you don't schedule a Precondition, Model 3 
only warms the Battery before charging if the Battery is too 
cold to charge, and doesn't prepare the cabin climate.
NOTE: When Model 3 is not plugged in, preconditioning 
operates but only when the Battery's charge level is above 
20%.
Scheduled Precondition and Charge
176
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Preconditioning can also help to increase range on your next 
trip because a preconditioned cabin and battery consumes 
less energy when you begin driving. Preconditioning can 
reduce energy consumption while driving in vehicles with 
heat pumps, because heat in the battery can be used to warm 
the cabin while driving.
Scheduled Precondition and Charge
177
Charging and Energy Consumption


Factors Affecting Energy Consumption
While driving:
• Elevated driving speed.
• Environmental conditions such as cold or hot weather and 
wind.
• Using climate controls to heat or cool the cabin.
• Uphill travel: Driving uphill requires more energy and 
depletes range at a faster rate. However, driving downhill 
allows your vehicle to regain a portion of its expended 
energy through regenerative braking (see Regenerative 
Braking on page 78).
• Short trips or stop-and-go traffic: It takes energy to bring 
the cabin and Battery to a specified temperature when 
starting the vehicle. You may see a higher average 
consumption when the vehicle is used for very short trips 
or in heavy traffic.
• Heavy cargo load.
• Windows rolled down.
• Wheels and tires not maintained.
• Customized settings or third-party accessories (roof or 
trunk racks, third party wheels).
While parked and not plugged in to a charger: 
• Preconditioning the cabin or using climate controls.
• Summon.
• Vehicle infotainment and climate controls system.
• Sentry mode.
• Tesla or third-party mobile app requests.
Tips to Maximize Range
You can maximize your driving range using the same driving 
habits you use to conserve fuel in a gasoline-powered 
vehicle. To achieve maximum range:
• Slow down your driving and avoid frequent and rapid 
acceleration. Consider using Chill Mode (touch Controls > 
Dynamics > Acceleration) and Speed Assist (see Speed 
Assist on page 135) to assist in controlling your 
acceleration and speed.
• If safe to do so, modulate the accelerator pedal instead of 
using the brake pedal when gradually slowing down. 
Whenever Model 3 is moving and you are not pressing the 
accelerator pedal, regenerative braking slows down the 
vehicle and feeds surplus energy back to the Battery (see 
Regenerative Braking on page 78).
• Limit the use of resources such as heating and air 
conditioning. Using seat and steering wheel heaters (if 
equipped) to keep warm is more efficient than heating the 
cabin using climate controls.
• With your vehicle plugged in, use the mobile app to 
precondition your vehicle to ensure the cabin is at a 
comfortable temperature and windows are defrosted (if 
needed) before your drive by touching Climate > On and 
customizing your preferences (see Mobile App on page 
51).
• Touch Schedule, (also available on both the charging and 
climate control screens) to set a time when you want your 
vehicle to be ready to drive (see Scheduled Precondition 
and Charge on page 176).
• Ensure the wheels are aligned to specification, the tires 
are kept at the recommended inflation pressures (see Tire 
Care and Maintenance on page 183), and are rotated 
when needed (see Maintenance Service Intervals on page 
181).
• Install aero covers (if equipped) to reduce wind resistance 
(see Removing and Installing Aero Covers on page 185).
• Lighten your load by removing any unnecessary cargo.
• Fully raise all windows.
• Features such as Sentry Mode and Cabin Overheat 
Protection can impact range. Disable features when not 
needed.
• To prevent an excessive amount of energy consumption 
while the vehicle is idle, keep the vehicle plugged in when 
not in use.
It is normal for estimated range to decrease slightly over the 
first few months before leveling off. Over time, you may see a 
gradual, but natural, decrease in range at full charge – this 
depends on factors such as the mileage and age of the 
Battery. Your Model 3 will inform you in the unlikely event a 
hardware issue is causing excessive Battery or range 
degradation.
The power meter on the touchscreen provides feedback on 
energy usage.
Range Assurance
The driving range displayed in Model 3 is an estimate of the 
remaining battery energy based on EPA-rated consumption. 
It may not account for your personal driving patterns or 
external conditions. The displayed range on the touchscreen 
may decrease faster than the actual distance driven. To view 
estimated range based on your recent energy consumption, 
open the Energy app to display the graph. 
NOTE: Rated driving range is based on EPA-rated 
consumption in the United States, which deviates from tests 
advertised and performed in other jurisdictions.
Your vehicle continuously monitors its energy level and 
proximity to known charging locations.

Loading New Software
Tesla updates your vehicle's software wirelessly, constantly 
providing new features. Tesla recommends you install 
software updates at the earliest opportunity on your vehicle. 
To ensure the fastest and most reliable delivery of software 
updates, leave Wi-Fi turned on and connected whenever 
possible. In most cases, your vehicle must be connected to 
Wi-Fi to download the software update (see Wi-Fi on page 
53).
Downloading vs. Installing New 
Software
There are two steps to receiving a new update: downloading 
the software (which requires Wi-Fi), and installing it. For your 
convenience, you can start downloads and installations using 
the Tesla mobile app.
Download
When a software update is available for download, the 
download occurs automatically, showing a green arrow at the 
top of the touchscreen. If the vehicle is not connected to Wi-
Fi, a yellow download icon appears. Although you can drive 
while the software update is being downloaded, doing so can 
interrupt the download if your vehicle loses the Wi-Fi 
connection. When the software update is fully downloaded 
and ready to install, a clock icon displays at the top of the 
touchscreen.
NOTE: To ensure the fastest and most reliable download of 
software updates, leave the Wi-Fi turned on and connected 
whenever possible (see Wi-Fi on page 53).
Install
You CANNOT drive while software is being installed. If 
plugged in, your vehicle will stop charging until the 
installation is complete. To start the installation, touch the 
yellow clock icon at the top of the touchscreen. Touch Install 
Now to begin the installation immediately or touch Set For 
This Time to choose a different start time. At any time before 
the update installs, you can touch this clock icon to 
reschedule. If you are driving Model 3 at the scheduled 
update time, the update is canceled and must be 
rescheduled. You can also view, download, and install 
software updates by navigating to Controls > Software. If

vehicles based on various factors unique to each release. In 
Controls > Software, you can choose how quickly you want to 
receive updates that are ready for your vehicle. Be an early 
adopter by selecting Advanced (which will have additional 
releases), or wait until others have installed (which will result 
in fewer releases) by selecting Standard. Choosing Advanced 
does not enroll your vehicle in Tesla's early access program.
Tesla does not update your software upon request for those 
wanting to receive the latest features and improvements. 
Selecting Advanced and consistently connecting to Wi-Fi 
(see Wi-Fi on page 53) is the best way to quickly receive the 
latest software updates.
If the touchscreen displays a message indicating that a 
software update was not successfully completed, wait for the 
next software update to deploy to your vehicle.
NOTE: The software update screen persists until you install 
the update. Install a software update as soon as possible. Any 
harm resulting from failure to install a software update is not 
covered by the vehicle’s warranty. Failure or refusal to install 
updates can cause some vehicle features to become 
inaccessible or digital media devices may become 
incompatible.
NOTE: Tesla may update or reinstall your vehicle's software as 
part of the normal diagnostic, repair, and maintenance 
process within Tesla Service.
NOTE: Reverting to a previous software version is not 
possible.
Charging
If Model 3 is charging when the software update begins, 
charging stops. Charging resumes automatically when the 
software update is complete.

• A/C desiccant bag replacement every 4** years.
• Cabin air filter replacement every 2 years.
• Clean and lubricate brake calipers every year or 12,500 
miles (20,000 km) if in an area where roads are salted 
during winter.
• Rotate tires every 6,250 miles (10,000 km) or if tread 
depth difference is 2/32 in (1.5 mm) or greater, whichever 
comes first.
**A/C desiccant bag replacement can be extended to 6 
years on vehicles manufactured between approximately 
2017-2021.
*Heavy brake usage due to towing, mountain descents, or 
performance driving -- especially for vehicles in hot and 
humid environments -- may necessitate more frequent brake 
fluid checks and replacements.
NOTE: Any damage caused by opening the Battery coolant 
reservoir is excluded from the warranty.
NOTE: The above intervals are based on typical driving 
behaviors and scenarios. Depending on various 
circumstances such as driving behavior, usage, 
environmental conditions, etc., the above maintenance items 
may need to be performed more or less frequently than 
specified. Additionally, the above list should not be 
considered comprehensive and does not include consumable 
parts such as windshield wipers, brake pads, low voltage 
battery, etc.
NOTE: Damages or failures caused by maintenance or repairs 
performed by non-Tesla certified technicians are not covered 
by the warranty.
For more do-it-yourself maintenance procedures and 
information, see https://www.tesla.com/support/do-it-
yourself-guides.
Schedule Service
Scheduling a service visit through the mobile app is easy. 
After touching Service, select the type of service needed and 
follow the directions in the mobile app. Provide as much 
detail as possible to better help the Service team identify the 
cause of concern, such as:
• Photos, sound recordings, or videos.
• Date(s), time(s), and time zone when the issue occurred.
• Country of use and location.
• Approximate speed the vehicle was traveling (if 
applicable).
• Environmental conditions (rain, snow, cold, etc.).
• Road name and type of road (if applicable).
• Quality of lane markings (if applicable).
• Applicable vehicle settings.
• Identifiable symptoms.
Visit https://www.tesla.com/support/service-visits for more 
information on scheduling service.
Daily Checks
• Check the Battery’s charge level, displayed on the 
touchscreen or mobile app.
• Check the condition and pressure of each tire (see Tire 
Care and Maintenance on page 183).
• Check that all exterior lights, horn, turn signals, and 
wipers and washers are working.
• Check for any unexpected indicator lights or vehicle 
alerts on the touchscreen.
• Check the operation of the brakes, including the parking 
brake.
NOTE: Because Model 3 uses regenerative braking (see 
Regenerative Braking on page 78), the brake pads are 
typically used less frequently than those in traditional 
braking systems. To avoid the accumulation of rust and 
corrosion, Tesla recommends frequently pressing the 
brake pedal to apply the mechanical brakes, which dries 
the brake pads and rotors.
• Check the operation of the seat belts (see Seat Belts on 
page 37).
• Look for abnormal fluid deposits underneath Model 3 that 
might indicate a leak. It is normal for a small pool of water 
to form (caused by the air conditioning system’s 
dehumidifying process).
• Look around the exterior of Model 3 and immediately 
remove any corrosive substances (such as bird droppings, 
tree resin, tar spots, dead insects, industrial fallout, etc.) 
to prevent damage to the exterior (see Cleaning on page 
190).
Weekly Checks
• During wet weather, clean Autopilot cameras weekly (see 
Cleaning a Camera on page 190). Otherwise, clean them 
monthly during dry weather.
Maintenance Service Intervals
181
Maintenance


Monthly Checks
• Check windshield washer fluid level and top up if 
necessary (see Topping Up Windshield Washer Fluid on 
page 194).
• Check that the air conditioning system is operating 
correctly (see Operating Climate Controls on page 144).
NOTE: In addition to cooling the interior, the air conditioning 
compressor also cools the Battery. Therefore, in hot weather, 
the air conditioning compressor can turn on even if you 
turned it off. This is normal because the system’s priority is to 
cool the Battery to ensure it stays within an optimum 
temperature range to support longevity and optimum 
performance. Also, even when not in use, you may hear 
Model 3 emit a whining noise or the sound of water 
circulating. These sounds are normal and occur when the 
internal cooling systems turn on to support various vehicle 
functions, such as maintaining the low voltage battery and 
balancing the temperature of the high voltage Battery.
Periodic Checks
Perform the following checks as needed:
Over time, when driving in dusty or polluted conditions, your 
vehicle's radiator may become clogged. This can affect air 
flow and heating/AC performance. Use the mobile app to 
schedule a service appointment.
Fluid Replacement Intervals
Battery coolant and brake fluid levels should only be checked 
by Tesla or a professional automotive repair shop. Specific 
service information is available in the Service Manual.
• Battery coolant: Your Battery coolant does not need to be 
replaced for the life of your vehicle under most 
circumstances.
NOTE: Any damage caused by opening the Battery 
coolant reservoir is excluded from the warranty.
• Brake fluid: Do not top up your brake fluid.
Software
Updating software is important to ensure proper operation 
and longevity of your vehicle's components. You must install 
a software update at the earliest opportunity. See Software 
Updates on page 180.
Tesla may update or reinstall your vehicle's software as part 
of the normal diagnostic, repair, and maintenance process 
within Service.
High Voltage Safety
Your Model 3 has been designed and built with safety as a 
priority. However, be aware of these precautions to protect 
yourself from the risk of injury inherent in all high-voltage 
systems:
• Read and follow all instructions provided on the labels 
that are attached to Model 3. These labels are there for 
your safety.
• The high voltage system has no user-serviceable parts. 
Do not disassemble, remove or replace high voltage 
components, cables or connectors. High voltage cables 
are colored orange for easy identification.
• If a collision occurs, do not touch any high voltage wiring, 
connectors, or components connected to the wiring.
• In the unlikely event that a fire occurs, immediately 
contact your local fire emergency responders.
WARNING: Always disconnect the charge cable before 
working underneath Model 3, even if charging is not in 
progress.
WARNING: Keep your hands and clothing away from 
cooling fans. Some fans operate even when Model 3 is 
powered off.
WARNING: Some fluids (Battery acid, Battery coolant, 
brake fluid, windshield washer additives, etc.) used in 
vehicles are poisonous and should not be inhaled, 
swallowed, or brought into contact with open wounds. 
For your safety, always read and follow instructions 
printed on fluid containers.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Displaying Tire Pressures
Tire pressures display on the touchscreen in the cards area 
on the car status display, or by touching Controls > Service. 
The pressure of each tire displays in the visualization of your 
Model 3, in addition to what time your tire pressures were 
last measured. The touchscreen also displays your vehicle's 
recommended cold tire pressures so you can easily 
determine how much to inflate your tires. You can choose 
whether you want to display tire pressures using Bar or PSI 
by touching Controls > Display > Tire Pressure.
You can also view tire pressures in the Tesla mobile app.
NOTE: You may need to drive briefly before the visualization 
displays the tire pressure values.
Maintaining Tire Pressures
Keep tires inflated to the pressures shown on the Tire and 
Loading Information label, even if it differs from the pressure 
printed on the tire itself. The Tire and Loading Information 
label is located on the center door pillar and is visible when 
the driver door is open.
NOTE: If your Model 3 is fitted with Tesla accessory wheels 
or tires, some information may be different from the labels on 
the vehicle.
The Tire Pressure indicator light on the 
touchscreen alerts you if one or more tires is 
under- or over-inflated.
The Tire Pressure indicator light does not immediately turn 
off when you adjust tire pressure. After inflating the tire to 
the recommended pressure, you must drive over 15 mph 
(25 km/h) for a short amount of time to activate the Tire 
Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), which turns off the Tire 
Pressure indicator light.
If the indicator light flashes for one minute whenever you 
power on Model 3, a fault with the TPMS is detected (see 
TPMS Malfunction on page 187).
NOTE: Your vehicle’s tire pressures will drop in cold ambient 
temperatures. If the TPMS indicator light appears, inflate the 
tires before driving. The tires will lose one PSI for every 10° F 
(6° C) drop in outside temperature. Proper tire pressures 
help protect tires from potholes and improve range when 
properly inflated.
WARNING: Under-inflation is the most common cause 
of tire failures and can cause a tire to overheat, 
resulting in severe tire cracking, tread separation, or 
blowout, resulting in unexpected loss of vehicle control 
and increased risk of injury. Under-inflation also 
reduces the vehicle's range and tire tread life.
WARNING: Check tire pressures using an accurate 
pressure gauge when tires are cold. It takes only about 
one mile (1.6 km) of driving to warm up the tires 
sufficiently to affect tire pressures. Parking the vehicle 
in direct sunlight or in hot weather can also affect tire 
pressures. If you must check warm tires, expect 
increased pressures. Do not let air out of warm tires in 
an attempt to match recommended cold tire pressures. 
A hot tire at or below the recommended cold tire 
inflation pressure is dangerously under-inflated.
Checking and Adjusting Tire Pressures
Follow these steps when tires are cold and Model 3 has been 
stationary for over three hours:
1. Refer to the Tire and Loading Information label located on 
the driver’s center door pillar for the target tire pressure.
2. Remove the valve cap.
3. Firmly press an accurate tire pressure gauge onto the 
valve to measure pressure.
4. If required, add or remove air to reach the recommended 
pressure.
NOTE: You can release air by pressing the metal stem in 
the center of the valve.
5. Re-check pressure using the accurate tire gauge.
6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 as necessary until the tire pressure 
is correct.
7. Reinstall the valve cap to prevent dirt from entering. 
Periodically check the valve for damage and leaks.
Inspecting and Maintaining Tires
Regularly inspect the tread and side walls for any sign of 
distortion (bulges), foreign objects, cuts or wear.
WARNING: Do not drive Model 3 if a tire is damaged, 
excessively worn, or inflated to an incorrect pressure. 
Check tires regularly for wear, and ensure there are no 
cuts, bulges or exposure of the ply/cord structure.
Tire Care and Maintenance
183
Maintenance


Tire Wear
Adequate tread depth is important for proper tire 
performance. Tires with a tread depth less than 4/32” (3 mm) 
are more likely to hydroplane in wet conditions and should 
not be used. Tires with a tread depth less than 5/32” (4 mm) 
do not perform well in snow and slush and should not be used 
when driving in winter conditions.
Model 3 is originally fitted with tires that have wear indicators 
molded into the tread pattern. When the tread has been worn 
down to 4/32” (3 mm), the indicators start to appear at the 
surface of the tread pattern, producing the effect of a 
continuous band of rubber across the width of the tire. For 
optimal performance and safety, Tesla recommends replacing 
tires before the wear indicators are visible.
To improve vehicle handling characteristics and minimize 
hydroplaning in wet conditions, put tires with the most tread 
on the rear of the car.
Tire Rotation, Balance, and Wheel Alignment
Tesla recommends rotating the tires every 6,250 miles 
(10,000 km) or if tread depth difference is 2/32" (1.5 mm) or 
greater, whichever comes first.
Tire rotation is an essential part of tire maintenance. It helps 
maintain an even treadwear pattern which enhances the tire's 
overall wear quality, decreases road noise and maximizes tire 
life.
Vehicles with staggered wheels and non-directional tires can 
be rotated side-to-side (left-to-right) but not front-to-back 
as the front and rear tire size is different. Left-to-right 
rotation can increase tread life by changing the direction of 
rotation for each tire and balancing shoulder wear.
Unbalanced wheels (sometimes noticeable as vibration 
through the steering wheel) affect vehicle handling and tire 
life. Even with regular use, wheels can get out of balance. 
Therefore, they should be balanced as required.
If tire wear is uneven (on one side of the tire only) or becomes 
abnormally excessive, check the wheel alignment. If the tires 
need to be serviced, such as rotated or replaced, reset the 
tire configuration (see Tire Configuration on page 187) to 
improve your driving experience.
Punctured Tires
A puncture eventually causes the tire to lose pressure, which 
is why it is important to check tire pressures frequently. 
Permanently repair or replace punctured or damaged tires as 
soon as possible.
Your tubeless tires may not leak when penetrated, provided 
the object remains in the tire. If, however, you feel a sudden 
vibration or ride disturbance while driving, or you suspect a 
tire is damaged, immediately reduce your speed. Drive 
slowly, while avoiding heavy braking or sharp steering and, 
when safe to do so, stop the vehicle. Arrange to have Model 
3 transported to a Tesla Service Center, or to a nearby tire 
repair center.
NOTE: In some cases, you can temporarily repair small tire 
punctures (under 1/4” (6 mm)) using an optional tire repair kit 
available from Tesla. This allows you to slowly drive Model 3 
to Tesla or to a nearby tire repair facility.
WARNING: Do not drive with a punctured tire that has 
not been repaired, even if the puncture has not caused 
the tire to deflate. A punctured tire can deflate 
suddenly at any time.
Flat Spots
If Model 3 is stationary for a long period, tires can form flat 
spots. When Model 3 is driven, these flat spots cause a 
vibration which gradually disappears as the tires warm up and 
regain their original shape.
To minimize flat spots during storage, inflate tires to the 
maximum pressure indicated on the tire wall. Then, before 
driving, release air to adjust tire pressure to the 
recommended levels.
Improving Tire Mileage
To improve the mileage you get from your tires, maintain tires 
at the recommended tire pressures, observe speed limits and 
advisory speeds, and avoid:
• Pulling away quickly, or hard acceleration.
• Fast turns and heavy braking.
• Potholes and objects in the road.
• Hitting curbs when parking.
• Contaminating tires with fluids that can cause damage.
Replacing Tires and Wheels
Tires degrade over time due to the effects of ultraviolet light, 
extreme temperatures, high loads, and environmental 
conditions. It is recommended that tires are replaced every 
six years, or sooner if required, even if tread depth is above 
the minimum.
When a tire set becomes worn, replace all four tires at the 
same time. Choose a Tesla-approved tire which is designed 
specifically for your vehicle. Most Tesla-approved tires can 
be identified with a "T-mark" specification on the tire's 
sidewall (for example, T0, T1, T2). Tesla-approved tires are 
designed to work with electric drivetrains and optimize 
performance, safety, reliability, and durability. For more 
information about Tesla-approved replacement tires, refer to 
the Service Manual.
NOTE: The T-mark identifies a specific tire's progression 
according to Tesla specifications. For example, a T1 Michelin 
Primacy is newer than a T0 Michelin Primacy, but is not 
necessarily newer than other models of T0 tires.
Tire Care and Maintenance
184
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


If tires need to be replaced early, for example due to a flat 
tire, we recommend replacing the tires in pairs unless the 
other tires are within 2/32 in (1.5 mm) of tread depth of the 
new tire. When replacing tires, it is important to match the 
brand and model of the older tires. Always place a pair of new 
tires on the rear if all four tires are the same size. Always 
balance the wheel and tire after replacing a tire. Consult with 
a professional tire retailer and installer for further guidance. If 
you replace your tires or install different ones, reset the tire 
configuration (see Tire Configuration on page 187). This 
resets the learned tire settings and improves the driving 
experience on your new tires. It may take up to 24 hours after 
a tire replacement or repair before the tire lubricant is 
completely dry and tires achieve maximum adherence to the 
rims. Avoid hard accelerations during this period to avoid tire 
slip on the rim.
NOTE: Regardless of the number of tires replaced, a 
complete set of matching tires is recommended for optimum 
performance.
If tires other than those specified are used, ensure that the 
load and speed ratings marked on the tire (see 
Understanding Tire Markings on page 209) equal or exceed 
those of the original specification.
For the specification of the original wheels and tires installed 
on Model 3, see Wheels and Tires on page 208.
If you replace a wheel, the TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring 
System) sensors need to be reset to ensure they provide 
accurate warnings when tires are under- or over-inflated (see 
Automatic Reset of TPMS Sensors on page 187).
NOTE: Installing winter tires with aggressive compound and 
tread design may result in temporarily-reduced regenerative 
braking power. However, your vehicle is designed to 
continuously recalibrate itself, and after changing tires it will 
increasingly restore regenerative braking power after some 
moderate-torque straight-line accelerations. For most 
drivers this occurs after a short period of normal driving, but 
drivers who normally accelerate lightly may need to use 
slightly harder accelerations while the recalibration is in 
progress. Go to Service > Wheel & Tire > Tires to select 
winter tires and quicken this process.
WARNING: For your safety, use only tires and wheels 
that match the original specification. Tires that do not 
match the original specification can affect the 
operation of the TPMS.
WARNING: Never exceed the speed rating of your 
vehicle's tires. The speed rating is shown on the 
sidewall of your tires (see Understanding Tire Markings 
on page 209).
Asymmetric Tires
Some Model 3 tires are asymmetric and must be mounted on 
the wheel with the correct sidewall facing outward. The 
sidewall of the tire is marked with the word OUTSIDE. When 
new tires are installed, make sure that the tires are correctly 
mounted on the wheels.
WARNING: Road holding is seriously impaired if the 
tires are incorrectly installed on the wheels.
Removing and Installing Aero Covers
If your Model 3 is equipped with aero covers, you must 
remove them to access the lug nuts.
To remove an aero cover:
1. Grasp the aero cover firmly with both hands.
2. Pull the aero cover toward you to release the retaining 
clips.
To install an aero cover:
1. Align the aero cover with the valve stem.
2. Firmly press the center of the cover to secure it in place, 
then work your way out to firmly pressing the outer 
perimeter of each spoke. You may need to hold onto the 
opposite side of the cover until all spokes are secured.
3. Firmly press the center of the cap with your hands (do not 
hit the cover with your hands) to ensure it is secured.
4. As a final check, quickly pull each spoke to confirm they 
are secured in place.

Maintenance


For Gemini wheels, press on the perimeter of the cover until 
it aligns with the wheel surface. Press on the Tesla “T” in the 
center until the cap snaps into place. See Parts and 
Accessories on page 197 for more information.
CAUTION: To prevent the aero cover from falling off, 
ensure that it is fully secured before driving.
Removing and Installing Lug Nut Covers
If your Model 3 is equipped with lug nut covers, you must 
remove them to access the lug nuts.
To remove a lug nut cover:
1. Insert the curved part of the lug nut cover tool, if 
equipped (located in the glovebox in some vehicles, or 
you can use a small allen wrench) into the hole at the base 
of the Tesla "T".
NOTE: The lug nut cover tool can also be purchased at an 
auto parts store or through online retailers.
2. Maneuver the lug nut cover tool so that it is fully inserted 
into the hole in the lug nut cover.
3. Twist the lug nut cover tool so that the curved part is 
touching the middle of the lug nut cover.
4. Firmly pull the lug nut tool away from the wheel until the 
lug nut cover is released.
To install the lug nut cover:
1. Align the lug nut cover into position.
2. Push firmly on the lug nut cover until it fully snaps into 
place.
CAUTION: Make sure the lug nut cover is fully 
secure before driving to prevent it from falling off.
Wheel Configuration
If you are installing new wheels or swapping them for 
different ones, update your vehicle's wheel configuration by 
touching Controls > Service > Wheel & Tire > Wheels. This 
allows Model 3 to learn the new wheels and provide more 
accurate status updates on your vehicle. Select a wheel from 
Tire Care and Maintenance
186
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


the drop down menu that matches the new wheels you plan 
to install on Model 3. Selecting new wheels in the wheel 
configuration also changes the wheels that appear on your 
vehicle's avatar on the touchscreen.
NOTE: Changing your vehicle's wheel configuration can 
impact range estimates, tire pressure warning levels, and 
vehicle visualization.
WARNING: Only use Tesla-approved wheels when 
installing or swapping wheels. Using non Tesla-
approved wheels can cause serious damage. Tesla is 
not liable for damage caused by using wheels not 
approved by Tesla.
Tire Configuration
To see the miles driven since your last tire rotation or 
replacement, touch Controls > Service and look under Last 
Tire Service. After the tires on Model 3 are rotated, replaced, 
or swapped, update your vehicle's tire configuration by 
touching Reset, or by touching Wheel & Tire > Tires from the 
same screen. This allows your vehicle to reset the learned tire 
settings and improve your driving experience.  This also 
clears and resets the tread wear alert for the vehicle until you 
travel 6,250 miles (10,000 km) and low tread depth is 
detected again.
Ensure you are aware if your vehicle is equipped with winter 
tires. Winter tires can be identified by a mountain and 
snowflake icon on the tires' sidewall. See Winter Tires on 
page 188 for more information.
NOTE: Changing your vehicle's tire configuration can 
temporarily impact acceleration and regenerative braking 
levels and should only be done after tires have been rotated 
or replaced.
Tire Pressure Monitoring
The Model 3 is equipped with a tire pressure 
monitoring system that warns the driver of 
significant under-inflation or over-inflation of 
the tires by displaying the Tire Pressure 
Indicator Light. Check the Tire and Loading 
Information label located on the driver’s door 
pillar for more details, or see Maintaining Tire 
Pressures on page 183.
Each tire, including the spare (if provided), should be 
checked monthly when cold and inflated to the inflation 
pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on the 
vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label. (If your vehicle 
has tires of a different size than the size indicated on the 
vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label, you should 
determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.)
As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped 
with a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) that 
illuminates a low tire pressure telltale when one or more of 
your tires is significantly under-inflated. Accordingly, when 
the low tire pressure telltale illuminates, you should stop and 
check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the 
proper pressure. Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire 
causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-
inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and 
may affect the vehicle's handling and stopping ability.
Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire 
maintenance, and it is the driver's responsibility to maintain 
correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached 
the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure 
telltale.
TPMS Malfunction
Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS 
malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is not 
operating properly. The TPMS malfunction indicator is 
combined with the low tire pressure telltale. When the 
system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash for 
approximately one minute and then remain continuously 
illuminated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent 
vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists.
When the malfunction indicator is illuminated, the system 
may not be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as 
intended. TPMS malfunctions may occur for a variety of 
reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate 
tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS from 
functioning properly. Always check the TPMS malfunction 
telltale after replacing one or more tires or wheels on your 
vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alternate tires and 
wheels allow the TPMS to continue to function properly.
The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined 
with the tire pressure indicator light. If Model 
3 detects a fault with the TPMS, this indicator 
flashes for one minute whenever you power on 
Model 3.
NOTE: If a tire has been replaced or repaired using a different 
tire sealant than the one available from Tesla, and a low tire 
pressure is detected, it is possible that the tire sensor has 
been damaged.
NOTE: Installing accessories that are not approved by Tesla 
can interfere with the TPMS.
Automatic Reset of TPMS Sensors
After replacing one or more wheels (but not after replacing a 
tire), the TPMS sensors are relearned to ensure tire pressure 
warnings are accurate. TPMS sensors reset automatically 
within 10 minutes of driving over 15 mph (25 km/h).
WARNING: If your Model 3 is equipped with 
aftermarket tires that differ in size from those printed 
on the Tire and Loading Information Label (see Vehicle 
Loading on page 202), it is the driver's responsibility to 
determine the correct tire pressure. Do not drive on 
public roads when tires are not inflated to the correct 
pressure.
Tire Care and Maintenance
187
Maintenance


WARNING: Do not depend on TPMS sensors to 
accurately determine pressures and trigger alerts. It is 
the driver's responsibility to maintain correct tire 
pressures (see Maintaining Tire Pressures on page 
183). Over or under-inflated tires can result in loss of 
control or tire damage, which can lead to serious injury. 
Replacing a Tire Sensor
If the Tire Pressure warning indicator displays frequently, use 
the mobile app to schedule a service appointment to 
determine if a tire sensor needs to be replaced. If a non-Tesla 
Service Center repairs or replaces a tire, the tire sensor may 
not work until Tesla performs the setup procedure.
Seasonal Tire Types
Understand Your Tire Type
The type of tires that your vehicle is originally equipped with 
depends on vehicle model and market region. It is important 
to understand the capabilities of your vehicle's tires and 
whether they are suited for summer, all-season, or winter 
driving. Check the information on the sidewall of a tire for 
information about a tire's performance characteristics (see 
Understanding Tire Markings on page 209).
Summer and All-Season Tires
Summer tires and all season tires are designed for maximum 
dry and wet road performance but are not designed to 
perform well in winter conditions. All-season tires are 
designed to provide adequate traction in most conditions 
year-round, but may not provide the same level of traction as 
winter tires in snowy or icy conditions. All-season tires can 
be identified by “ALL SEASON" and/or "M+S” (mud and 
snow) on the tire sidewall.
If driving in cold temperatures or on roads where snow or ice 
may be present, Tesla recommends using winter tires.
WARNING: In cold temperatures or on snow or ice, 
summer and all-season tires do not provide adequate 
traction. Selecting and installing the appropriate tires 
for winter conditions is important to ensure the safety 
and optimum performance of your Model 3.
Winter Tires
Use winter tires to increase traction in snowy or icy 
conditions. When installing winter tires, always install a 
complete set of four tires at the same time. Winter tires must 
be the same diameter, brand, construction and tread pattern 
on all four wheels.
Winter tires can be identified by a mountain/
snowflake symbol on the tire's sidewall.
When driving with winter tires, you may experience more 
road noise, shorter tread life, and less traction on dry roads.
NOTE: Installing winter tires with aggressive compound and 
tread design may result in temporarily-reduced regenerative 
braking power. However, your vehicle is designed to 
recalibrate itself to restore regenerative braking power after a 
short period of normal driving.
NOTE: If you install winter tires or replace your tires, reset the 
tire configuration by navigating to Controls > Service > Wheel 
& Tire Configuration > Tires (see Tire Configuration on page 
187). This resets the learned tire settings and improves the 
driving experience on your new tires.
WARNING: Never exceed the speed rating of your 
vehicle's tires. The speed rating is shown on the 
sidewall of your tires (see Understanding Tire Markings 
on page 209).
Driving in Low Temperatures
Tire performance is reduced in low ambient temperatures, 
resulting in reduced grip and an increased susceptibility to 
damage from impacts. Performance tires (summer 
applications) have reduced traction in ambient temperatures 
below 40° F (5° C), and are not recommended in snow/ice 
conditions. Performance tires can temporarily harden when 
cold, causing you to hear rotational noise for the first few 
miles (kilometers) until the tires warm up.
Using Tire Chains
Tesla has tested and approved the following tire chains (also 
called snow chains) to increase traction in snowy conditions. 
Tire chains should only be installed on the rear tires. The 
approved tire chains can be purchased from Tesla.
Tire Size
Recommended Chain
18"
König CG-9 102
19"
König CG-9 103
CAUTION: If your Model 3 is equipped with aero 
covers, you must remove them before installing tire 
chains (see Removing and Installing Aero Covers on 
page 185). Failure to do so can cause damage not 
covered by the warranty.
CAUTION: Do not put tire chains on summer tires, 
doing so can cause damage. 
When installing tire chains, follow the instructions and 
warnings provided by the tire chain manufacturer. Mount 
them evenly and as tight as possible.
When using tire chains:
Tire Care and Maintenance
188
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


• Inspect the tire chains for loose fittings and damaged 
links before each use.
• Avoid heavily loading Model 3 (heavy loads can reduce 
the clearance between the tires and the body).
• Do not drive the vehicle without the chains properly 
installed.
• Drive slowly. Do not exceed 30 mph (48 km/h).
• Remove the tire chains as soon as conditions allow.
NOTE: Tire chains are prohibited in some jurisdictions. Check 
local laws before installing tire chains.
CAUTION: Using non-recommended tire chains, or 
using tire chains on other sized tires can damage the 
suspension, body, wheels, and/or brake lines. Damage 
caused by using non-recommended tire chains, or 
incorrectly installing tire chains, is not covered by the 
warranty.
CAUTION: Do not use snow chains on the front tires.
CAUTION: Never deflate your tires to put on tire chains. 
When re-inflated, the chains might fit too tightly and 
cause tire damage.
CAUTION: Ensure that the tire chains cannot touch 
suspension components or brake lines. If you hear the 
chains making unusual noises that would indicate 
contact with Model 3, stop and investigate 
immediately.

Maintenance


Cleaning the Exterior
To prevent damage to the paint, immediately remove 
corrosive substances (grease, oil, bird droppings, tree resin, 
dead insects, tar spots, road salt, industrial fallout, etc.). Do 
not wait until Model 3 is due for a complete wash. If 
necessary, use denatured alcohol to remove tar spots and 
stubborn grease stains, then immediately wash the area with 
water and a mild, non-detergent soap to remove the alcohol.
Keep the exterior cameras free of dirt, condensation, or 
obstructions. These substances can cause unclear pictures 
or Autopilot and safety features to stop working (see 
Cleaning a Camera on page 190).
Follow these steps when washing the exterior of Model 3:
1. Before washing, flush grime and grit from the vehicle 
using a hose. Flush away accumulations of mud in areas 
where debris easily collects (such as wheel wells and 
panel seams). If salt has been used on the highways (such 
as during winter months), thoroughly rinse all traces of 
road salt from the underside of the vehicle, wheel wells, 
and brakes.
2. Hand wash Model 3 using a clean soft cloth and cold or 
lukewarm water and a mild, high-quality car shampoo.
CAUTION: Some cleaners and car shampoos 
contain chemicals that can cause damage or 
discoloration, especially for plastic trim pieces, 
exterior lights, or camera lenses. For example, some 
car cleaning formulas contain hydroxide or other 
highly alkaline or caustic ingredients that can 
damage exterior components. Do not use acidic 
products either. Damage or discoloration resulting 
from cleaning products is not covered by the 
warranty. 
3. After washing, rinse with clean water to prevent soap 
from drying on the surfaces.
4. Dry thoroughly with a chamois. If necessary, dry the 
brakes by going on a short drive and applying the brakes 
multiple times.
Use isopropyl alcohol wipes (such as those used to clean 
glasses or screens) to clean away small stains.
Window Cleaning and Treatments
Clean windows and mirrors using an automotive glass 
cleaner. Do not scrape or use any abrasive cleaning fluid on 
glass or mirrored surfaces. Follow the directions in Cleaning 
the Exterior on page 190 for best practices in cleaning the 
exterior glass.
To add a hydrophobic coating to your vehicle's windows, 
apply the coating only to the side and rear windows, not the 
front windshield—doing so may affect the visibility of the 
autopilot cameras. Follow the hydrophobic coating 
manufacturer’s instructions for application details.
NOTE: Tesla is not responsible for any damage associated 
with applying window treatments on your vehicle.
Car Wash Mode
When taking Model 3 to a car wash, Car Wash Mode closes 
all windows, locks the charge port, and disables windshield 
wipers, Sentry Mode, walk-away door locking, and parking 
sensor chimes. To enable, touch Controls > Service > Car 
Wash Mode. Your vehicle must be stationary and not actively 
charging.
If using an automatic car wash, Enable Free Roll keeps your 
vehicle in Neutral and activates free roll for the duration of 
the wash, while preventing Model 3 from applying the 
Parking brake if you leave the driver's seat. To enable, press 
on the brake pedal and touch Enable Free Roll; or shift into 
Neutral.
Car Wash Mode disables if the vehicle's speed exceeds 9 
mph (15 km/h) or by touching Exit on the touchscreen.
CAUTION: Failure to put Model 3 in Car Wash Mode 
may result in damage (for example, to the charge port 
or windshield wipers). Damage caused by car washes 
is not covered by the warranty.
Cleaning a Camera
To ensure a clear picture, the camera lens must be clean and 
free of obstructions.
Remove any build-up of dirt or debris by spraying water onto 
the camera lens and drying it with a microfiber cloth. Clean 
the camera lens every week during wet weather (snow, rain, 
sleet) and every month during dry weather.
CAUTION: Do not use chemical-based or abrasive 
cleaners. Doing so can damage the surface of the lens.
CAUTION: Do not clean an ultrasonic sensor (if 
equipped) or camera lens with a sharp or abrasive 
object that can scratch or damage its surface.
Cautions for Exterior Cleaning
CAUTION: Do not wash in direct sunlight.
CAUTION: Do not use windshield treatment fluids. 
Doing so can interfere with wiper friction and cause a 
chattering sound.
CAUTION: Do not use hot water, detergents, highly 
alkaline or caustic cleaning ingredients or solvents, 
specifically those containing hydroxide.
CAUTION: If using a pressure washer, maintain a

CAUTION: Do not aim water hoses directly at windows, 
door, or hood seals or at electronic modules or 
exposed cabling.
CAUTION: To avoid corrosive damage that may not be 
covered by the warranty, rinse away any road salt from 
the underside of the vehicle, wheel wells, and brakes. 
After cleaning the vehicle, dry the brakes by going on a 
short drive and applying the brakes multiple times.
CAUTION: Avoid using tight-napped or rough cloths, 
such as washing mitts. A high-quality microfiber 
cleaning cloth is recommended.
CAUTION: If washing in an automatic car wash, use 
touchless car washes only. These car washes have no 
parts (brushes, etc.) that touch the surfaces of Model 
3. Some touchless car washes use caustic solutions 
that, over time, can cause discoloration of decorative 
exterior trim. Avoid exposure to soaps and chemicals 
above pH 13. If unsure, check the product label or ask 
the staff at the car wash. Damage caused by improper 
washing is not covered by the warranty.
CAUTION: If washing in an automatic car wash, make 
sure the vehicle is locked. In addition, avoid using 
controls on the touchscreen that can result in 
accidentally opening doors or trunks while the vehicle 
is being washed. Any damage caused is not covered by 
the warranty.
CAUTION: Ensure the wipers are off before washing 
Model 3 to avoid the risk of damaging the wipers.
CAUTION: Do not use chemical based wheel cleaners 
or pre-wash products. These can damage the finish on 
the wheels.
WARNING: Never spray liquid at a high velocity (for 
example, if using a pressure washer) towards the 
charge port while Model 3 is charging. Failure to follow 
these instructions can result in serious injury or 
damage to the vehicle, charging equipment, or 
property.
Cleaning the Interior
Frequently inspect and clean the interior to maintain its 
appearance and to prevent premature wear. If possible, 
immediately wipe up spills and remove marks. For general 
cleaning, wipe interior surfaces using a soft cloth (such as 
microfiber) dampened with a mixture of warm water and mild 
non-detergent cleaner (test all cleaners on a concealed area 
before use). To avoid streaks, dry immediately with a soft 
lint-free cloth.
Interior Glass
Do not scrape, or use any abrasive cleaning fluid on glass or 
mirrored surfaces. This can damage the reflective surface of 
the mirror and the heating elements in the rear window.
Airbags
Do not allow any substance to enter an airbag cover. This 
could affect correct operation.
Dashboard and Plastic Surfaces
Do not polish the upper surfaces of the dashboard. Polished 
surfaces are reflective and could interfere with your driving 
view.
Interior Lighting
NOTE: The Tesla warranty does not cover damage caused by 
improper maintenance, including the use of cleaning 
solutions or tools that are not recommended in this Owner's 
Manual.
Do not use any soap or chemical cleaning solutions on 
interior lighting. Common cleaning solutions and substances 
can degrade the lenses or components of the lighting, 
causing cracks and damage over time. When you want to 
clean interior lighting, Tesla recommends that you use a soft 
cloth moistened with warm water to gently wipe away soiled 
areas or stains. Interior lighting includes, but is not limited to, 
these lights (if equipped):
• Footwell
• Puddle
• Projection
• Dome
• Accent
• Ambient
When you want to clean the interior with soap or a mild non-
detergent cleaner, Tesla recommends that you first cover all 
lighting with some form of protection, such as:
• Fabric.
• Masking tape.
• Plastic film.
• Protective covers for car interiors.

Maintenance


Avoid contact with harsh chemicals, including certain 
cosmetics. Such substances can cause damage, degradation, 
or discoloration over time.
For general spills and stains, wipe spills and chemical 
residues from interior surfaces as soon as possible. Moisten 
a soft cloth (preferably microfiber) with warm water and mild 
soap and gently wipe the stain in a circular motion. Then, 
wipe dry using a soft, lint-free cloth. Do not blow dry. 
Anything more than soap can be too harsh. Using other 
cleaning agents, disinfectants, conditioners, or protectants is 
not recommended.
For white seats: As a last resort, moisten a soft cloth (such as 
microfiber) with warm water and isopropyl alcohol and gently 
wipe the stain in a circular motion (DO NOT use this method 
on black seats). Clean off any remaining isopropyl alcohol 
residue with a soft, damp cloth. Aggressive or extended use 
of isopropyl alcohol will damage the top coat of the material, 
allowing stains to occur more readily and violating the 
warranty.
CAUTION: Do not use products containing alcohol, 
bleach (sodium hypoclorite), citrus, naptha, or silicon-
based additives. Do not spray the seat directly with any 
spray. Do not get water into the seat belt mechanism.
A variety of clothing, accessories, and cosmetics may 
contain dyes or oils which can transfer onto the seats over 
time. These stains are difficult to prevent and cannot always 
be safely cleaned off.
CAUTION: Do not use aftermarket, non-Tesla seat 
covers. Seat covers may cause staining or damage to 
the seats and may inhibit the sensitivity of a seat's 
occupancy sensors or restrict deployment of airbags.
Carpets
Avoid over-wetting carpets. For heavily soiled areas, use a 
diluted upholstery cleaner.
Seat Belts
Extend the belts to wipe. Do not use any type of detergent or 
chemical cleaning agent. Allow the belts to dry naturally 
while extended, preferably away from direct sunlight.
Door Seals
Wipe door seals with a damp cloth to remove any debris. 
Excessive debris on the door seals can cause damage when 
contacting surrounding surfaces. Avoid using alcohol wipes 
or any chemical products that can potentially deteriorate the 
coating on the door seals.
Front and Rear Touchscreens
Clean the touchscreen(s) using a soft lint-free cloth 
specifically designed to clean monitors and displays. Do not 
use cleaners (such as a glass cleaner) or alcohol-based gel 
products (such as hand sanitizer) and do not use a wet wipe 
or a dry statically-charged cloth (such as a recently washed 
microfiber). To wipe the front touchscreen without activating 
buttons and changing settings, you can enable Screen Clean 
Mode. Touch Controls > Display > Screen Clean Mode. The 
display darkens to make it easy to see dust and smudges. To 
exit Screen Clean Mode, press and hold HOLD TO EXIT.
Chrome and Metal Surfaces
Polish, abrasive cleaners, alcohol-based gel products (such 
as hand sanitizer), and hard cloths can damage the finish on 
chrome and metal surfaces.
Cautions for Interior Cleaning
CAUTION: Using solvents (including alcohol), alcohol-
based gel products (such as hand sanitizer), bleach, 
citrus, naphtha, or silicone-based products or 
additives on interior components can cause damage.
CAUTION: Statically-charged materials can cause 
damage to the touchscreen.
WARNING: If you notice any damage on an airbag or 
seat belt, contact Tesla immediately.
WARNING: Do not allow any water, cleaners, or fabric 
to enter a seat belt mechanism.
WARNING: Do not use solvents or soap on interior 
accent lights.
WARNING: Exposure to chemical cleaners can be 
hazardous and can irritate eyes and skin. Read and 
observe the instructions provided by the manufacturer 
of the chemical cleaner.
Polishing, Touch Up, and Body Repair
To preserve the cosmetic appearance of the body, you can 
occasionally treat the paint surfaces with an approved polish 
containing:
• Very mild abrasive to remove surface contamination 
without removing or damaging the paint.
• Filling compounds that fill scratches and reduce their 
visibility.
• Wax to provide a protective coating between the paint 
and environmental elements.
Regularly inspect the exterior paint for damage. Treat minor 
chips and scratches using a paint touch-up pen (available for 
purchase from Tesla, depending on market region). Use the 
touch-up pen after washing but before polishing or waxing.

Topping Up Windshield Washer Fluid
The only reservoir into which you can add fluid is the 
windshield washer fluid reservoir, which is located behind the 
front trunk. When the level is low, a message displays on the 
touchscreen.
To top up the washer fluid:
1. Open the hood.
2. Clean around the filler cap before opening it to prevent 
dirt from entering the reservoir.
3. Open the filler cap.
4. While avoiding spilling, fill the reservoir until the fluid level 
is visible just below the filler neck. The reservoir has a 
capacity of 3.2 liters.
5. Wipe up any spills immediately and wash the affected 
area with water.
6. Reinstall the filler cap.
NOTE: Some national or local regulations restrict the use of 
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). VOCs are commonly 
used as antifreeze in washer fluid. Use a washer fluid with 
limited VOC content only if it provides adequate freeze 
resistance for all climates in which you drive Model 3.
CAUTION: Use only ethanol-based windshield washer 
fluid meant for automotive vehicles. Using other 
substances, such as untreated water, can result in 
bacterial growth within the climate control system 
resulting in odor or potential damage that is not 
covered by warranty.
CAUTION: Do not add formulated washer fluids that 
contain water repellent or bug wash. These fluids can 
cause streaking, smearing, and squeaking or other 
noises.
WARNING: In temperatures below 40° F (4° C), use a 
washer fluid with antifreeze. In cold weather, using a 
washer fluid without antifreeze can impair visibility 
through the windshield.
WARNING: Windshield washer fluid can irritate eyes 
and skin. Read and observe the instructions provided 
by the washer fluid manufacturer.
Checking and Cleaning Wiper Blades
Periodically clean the edge of the wiper blades and check the 
rubber for cracks, splits, and roughness. If damaged, replace 
the blade immediately to prevent damage to the glass and 
improve visibility.
Contaminants on the windshield, or on the wiper blades, can 
reduce the effectiveness of the wipers. Contaminants include 
ice, wax spray from car washes, washer fluid with bug and/or 
water repellent, bird droppings, tree sap, and other organic 
substances.
Follow these guidelines for cleaning:
• Clean the windshield and wiper blades using washer fluid, 
isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol, or non-abrasive glass cleaner 
approved for use on automotive glass and rubber. 
Inappropriate products can cause damage or smears, and 
create glare on the windshield.
• Lift the wiper arm a short distance away from the 
windshield, just far enough to access the wiper blade. Do 
not lift a wiper arm beyond its intended position.
If the wipers remain ineffective after cleaning, replace the 
wiper blades.
Replacing Wiper Blades
For optimum performance, replace the wiper blades at least 
once a year. Replacement blades must meet the following 
criteria:
• The blade on the driver's side must be 26 inches (650 
mm) long and 19 inches (475 mm) long for the blade on 
the passenger's side.
• Ensure the connector on the replacement blade is the 
same as the original blade. Different connectors may 
prevent the replacement blade from connecting to the 
wiper arm on the vehicle.
You can purchase replacement wiper blades on the Tesla 
Shop.
NOTE: Only install replacement blades that are identical to 
the original blades. Using inappropriate blades can damage 
the wiper system and windshield.
To replace the wiper blades:
1. Shift into Park and turn off the wipers.
2. Touch Controls > Service > Wiper Service Mode to move 
the wipers to the service position.
3. Lift the wiper arm a short distance away from the

top notch of the cabin filter cover into place, then secure 
the tabs at the bottom of the HVAC module.
12. Reconnect the two electrical connectors to the 
components in the front right-hand side footwell cover, 
then resecure the cover with the push clips.
13. Align the right side panel with the front and rear locator 
slots on the center console, then apply pressure until all 
of the clips are fully secure.
14. Reinstall the front right-hand side floor mat then move the 
front right-hand side seat back into place.
Using RFID Transponders
When attaching an RFID transponder (used by many 
automated toll systems) inside Model 3, place the 
transponder next to the rear view mirror. This ensures best 
results and minimizes any obstruction to your driving view. 
Refer to the RFID manufacturer's instructions for specific 
placement.
NOTE: You can also attach a weather-proof transponder to 
the front license plate.
Installing Front License Plate Bracket
To accommodate jurisdictions that require a license plate on 
the front of your vehicle, Model 3 is equipped with a license 
plate bracket. This bracket conforms to the shape of your 
vehicle's front bumper and is adhered to it using strong 
adhesive.
NOTE: Tesla recommends performing this procedure on a 
clean, dry vehicle during a warm day. Cold and/or wet 
conditions may result in reduced performance of the 
adhesive.
To install the front license plate bracket:
1. Get isopropyl alcohol and test it on a non-visible painted 
surface of your vehicle to confirm that it does not damage 
or remove the paint.
2. Clean the mounting site with isopropyl alcohol and allow 
to dry for at least one minute.
3. Fully remove the protective tape from the adhesive at the 
top of the bracket and partially remove the tape from the 
top of the adhesive on each side. Leave the bottom half of 
the tape on the sides in place and fold the unattached 
tape outward for easy removal after aligning the bracket 
to the bumper.
4. While tilting the top of the license plate bracket away from 
the bumper (to prevent adhering it to the wrong location), 
align the bottom center of the license plate bracket with 
the middle of the grille as shown.

Vehicle Labeling
It is important to understand your vehicle's original tire sizes 
and pressures, and the GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) 
and GAWR (Gross Axle Weight Rating). This information can 
be found on two labels attached to Model 3.
Both labels are visible on the door pillar when the front door 
is open.
NOTE: If your Model 3 is fitted with Tesla accessory wheels 
or tires, your Model 3 may include an additional label 
indicating that values may differ from what is stated on the 
label.
1. Tire and Loading Information Label
2. Vehicle Certification Label
WARNING: Overloading Model 3 has an adverse effect 
on braking and handling, which can compromise your 
safety or cause damage.
CAUTION: Never store large amounts of liquid in Model 
3. A significant spill can cause electrical components 
to malfunction.
Tire and Loading Information Label
• The maximum number of occupant seating positions.
• The maximum vehicle capacity weight.
• The size of the original tires.
• The cold inflation pressures for the original front and rear 
tires. These pressures are recommended to optimize ride 
and handling characteristics.
Label Format:
Never change this label, even if you use different tires in the 
future.
NOTE: If Model 3 is loaded to its full capacity, double check 
all tires to ensure they are inflated to their recommended 
pressure levels.
Vehicle Certification Label
The Vehicle Certification label provides:
• GVWR - Gross Vehicle Weight Rating. The maximum 
allowable total mass of Model 3. This is calculated as the 
weight of Model 3 equipped with the heaviest factory 
selectable options, all passengers, fluids, and cargo.
• GAWR FRT and GAWR RR - Gross Axle Weight Rating for 
the front and rear axles. The GAWR is the maximum 
distributed weight that each axle can support.
CAUTION: To prevent damage, never load Model 3 so 
that it is heavier than GVWR or exceeds the individual 
GAWR weights.
Towing a Trailer
WARNING: Do not use Model 3 for towing purposes. 
Model 3 does not currently support towing. Towing 
can cause damage and increase the risk of a collision.
CAUTION: Using Model 3 for towing without Tesla-
approved towing components and accessories may 
void the warranty.
Roof Racks
Model 3 supports the use of Tesla-approved roof racks using 
a Tesla mounting accessory. To install roof racks, you must

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Calculating Load Limits
1. Locate the statement “The combined weight of occupants 
and cargo should never exceed XXX lbs or XXX kg” on 
the “Tire and Loading Information” label.
2. Determine the combined weight of all occupants that will 
ride in the vehicle.
3. Subtract the combined weight of the occupants from XXX 
lbs or XXX kg (see Step 1).
4. The resulting figure equals the available cargo load 
capacity. For example, if the “XXX” amount equals 
1400 lbs (635 kg) and there will be five 150 lb (68 kg) 
passengers in the vehicle, the amount of available cargo 
capacity is 650 lbs (1400 ‑ 750 (5 x 150) = 650 lbs) or 
295 kg (635 ‑ 340 (5 x 68) = 295 kg).
5. Determine the combined cargo weight being loaded on 
the vehicle. That weight must not exceed the available 
cargo load capacity calculated in Step 4.
WARNING: Trunks are the preferred places to carry 
objects. In a collision, or during hard braking and sharp 
turns, loose items in the cabin could injure occupants.
Example Load Limit Calculations
How much cargo Model 3 can carry depends on the number 
and weight of passengers. The following calculated load limit 
examples assume passengers weigh 150 lbs (68 kg). If 
passengers weigh more or less, available cargo weight 
decreases or increases respectively.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Understanding Tire Markings
Laws require tire manufacturers to place standardized information on the sidewall of all tires. This information identifies and 
describes the fundamental characteristics of the tire. It also provides the tire identification number (TIN) for certification of 
safety standards, and in case of a recall.
NOTE: You can identify a Tesla-approved tire by the "T-mark" specification on the tire's sidewall (for example, T0, T1, 
T2).Tesla-approved tires are designed to work with your vehicle and optimize performance, safety, reliability, and durability. 
For more information about Tesla-approved replacement tires, refer to the Service Manual.
1. Tire category: P indicates that the tire is for passenger vehicles.
2. Tire width: This 3-digit number is the width (in millimeters) of the tire from sidewall edge to sidewall edge.
3. Aspect ratio: This 2-digit number is the sidewall height as a percentage of the tread width. So, if the tread width is 205 mm, 
and the aspect ratio is 50, the sidewall height is 102 mm.
4. Tire construction: R indicates that the tire is of Radial ply construction.
5. Wheel diameter: This 2-digit number is the diameter of the wheel rim in inches.
6. Load index: This 2 or 3-digit number is the weight each tire can support. This number is not always shown.
Wheels and Tires
209
Specifications


7. Speed rating: When stated, indicates the maximum speed (in mph) at which the tire can be used for extended periods. 
Q=99 mph (160 km/h), R=106 mph (170 km/h), S=112 mph (180 km/h), T=118 mph (190 km/h), U=124 mph (200 km/h), 
H=130 mph (210 km/h), V=149 mph (240 km/h), W=168 mph (270 km/h), Y=186 mph (300 km/h), (Y)=vehicle's top speed 
(exceeds the "Y" rating).
8. Tire composition and materials: The number of plies in both the tread area and the sidewall area indicates how many layers 
of rubber coated material make up the structure of the tire. Information is also provided on the type of materials used.
9. Maximum tire load: The maximum load which can be carried by the tire.
10. Maximum permissible inflation pressure: This pressure should not be used for normal driving.
11. U.S. DOT Tire Identification Number (TIN): Begins with the letters DOT and indicates that the tire meets all federal 
standards. The next 2 digits/letters represent the plant code where it was manufactured, and the last 4 digits represent the 
week and year of manufacture. For example, the number 1712 is used to represent the 17th week of 2012. The other 
numbers are marketing codes used at the manufacturer’s discretion. This information can be used to contact consumers if 
a tire defect requires a recall.
12. Treadwear grade: This number indicates the tire’s wear rate. The higher the treadwear number is, the longer it should take 
for the tread to wear down. A tire rated at 400, for example, lasts twice as long as a tire rated at 200.
13. Traction grade: Indicates a tire’s ability to stop on wet roads. A higher graded tire should allow you to stop your vehicle in a 
shorter distance than a tire with a lower grade. Traction is graded from highest to lowest as AA, A, B, and C.
14. Temperature grade: The tire’s resistance to heat is grade A, B, or C, with A indicating the greatest resistance. This grading 
is provided for a correctly inflated tire, which is being used within its speed and loading limits.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Uniform Tire Quality Grading
The following information relates to the tire grading system developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA), which grades tires by tread wear, traction and temperature performance. Tires that have deep tread, and winter 
tires, are exempt from these marking requirements.
Where applicable, quality grades are found on the tire’s sidewall between the tread shoulder and maximum section width. For 
example:
• TREADWEAR 180
• TRACTION AA
• TEMPERATURE A
The quality grades are described next.
NOTE: In addition to the marking requirements, passenger car tires must conform to Federal Safety Requirements.
Treadwear
The treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a 
specified government test course.
For example, a tire graded 150 wears one and a half times better on a government test course than a tire graded 100. The 
relative performance of tires depends on the actual conditions of their use, however, and can depart significantly from the 
norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices, road characteristics, and climate.
Traction
The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are: AA, A, B, and C. These grades represent a tire’s ability to stop on wet 
pavement as measured under controlled conditions on test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C might have poor 
traction performance.
WARNING: Defective tires are dangerous. Do not drive if a tire is damaged, excessively worn, or is inflated to an 
incorrect pressure. The safety of the vehicle and occupants can be adversely affected. Check tires regularly for wear 
and to ensure there are no cuts, bulges or exposure of the ply/cord structure.
WARNING: The traction grade assigned to the tire is based on straight-ahead braking tests, and does not include: 
acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning or peak traction characteristics.
Temperature
The temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire’s resistance to the generation of heat and its ability 
to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained high 
temperature can cause the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.
The grade C corresponds to the minimum level of performance that all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor 
Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel that exceed the 
minimum requirements.
WARNING: A tire’s temperature grade is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive 
speed, under-inflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat buildup and possible 
tire failure.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


DO NOT TRANSPORT WITH WHEELS 
ON THE GROUND
The motor(s) in Model 3 generates power when the wheels 
spin. Always transport Model 3 with all four tires off the 
ground. Ensure that the tires are unable to spin at any time 
during transport.
WARNING: NEVER TRANSPORT YOUR VEHICLE WITH 
THE TIRES IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN SPIN. 
DOING SO CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE 
AND OVERHEATING. IN RARE CASES EXTREME 
OVERHEATING MAY CAUSE THE SURROUNDING 
COMPONENTS TO IGNITE.
Do not transport Model 3 using any method that is not 
specified by Tesla. Adhere to the instructions provided in the 
following sections and observe all warnings and cautions 
provided. Damage caused by improper transporting of your 
vehicle is not covered by the warranty.
NOTE: Tesla is not liable or responsible for reimbursing 
services not dispatched through Tesla Roadside Assistance.
Approved Methods for Transporting
A flatbed truck or comparable transport vehicle is the 
recommended method of transporting Model 3. The vehicle 
can face either direction when using a flatbed.
If Model 3 must be transported without a flatbed truck, then 
wheel lifts and dollies must be used to ensure that all four 
wheels are off of the ground. This method may only be used 
for a maximum of 35 miles (55 km), and must not exceed the 
manufacturer speed rating of the dollies. With this method, 
Tesla recommends the vehicle facing forward so that the 
front wheels are lifted and the rear wheels are on dollies.
CAUTION: Enable Transport Mode (see Activate 
Transport Mode on page 215) before winching Model 
3 onto a flatbed truck (see Pull onto the Flatbed Truck 
on page 216). If Transport Mode is not available or the 
touchscreen is not accessible, self-loading dollies or 
tire skates must be used to load the vehicle into the 
approved transportation position. Tesla is not 
responsible for any damage caused by or during the 
transport of Model 3, including personal property 
damage or damage caused by using self-loading 
dollies or tire skates.
NOTE: Transport Mode is only intended to allow for winching 
Model 3 onto a flatbed truck or repositioning the vehicle out 
of a parking space. While in Transport Mode, the tires are 
allowed to rotate slowly (under 3 mph or 5 km/h) and for a 
very short distance (less than 30 feet or 10 meters). See 
Activate Transport Mode on page 215. Exceeding these 
boundaries can lead to significant damage and overheating 
that is not covered by the warranty.
WARNING: Model 3 is equipped with high voltage 
components that may be compromised as a result of a 
collision (see High Voltage Components on page 166). 
Before transporting Model 3, it is important to assume 
these components are energized. Always follow high 
voltage safety precautions (wearing personal 
protection equipment, etc.) until emergency response 
professionals have evaluated the vehicle and can 
accurately confirm that all high voltage systems are no 
longer energized. Failure to do so may result in serious 
injury. 
Activate Transport Mode
Transport Mode keeps the parking brake disengaged while 
winching Model 3 onto a flatbed truck. When active, 
Transport Mode displays a message indicating that the 
vehicle will remain free-rolling. To enable Transport Mode:
• Low voltage power is required. You will be unable to use 
the touchscreen to activate Transport Mode if Model 3 
has no power.
• Model 3 must detect a key. Transport Mode is available 
only when a key is detected.
• Ensure the vehicle is not connected to a charger. 
Transport Mode is not available if Model 3 is still plugged 
in.
To activate Transport Mode:
1. Ensure Model 3 is in Park.
2. Chock the tires or make sure Model 3 is secure.
Instructions for Transporters

Instructions for Transporters


3. Press and hold the brake pedal, then on the touchscreen, 
touch Controls > Service > Towing. The touchscreen 
displays a message reminding you how to properly 
transport Model 3.
4. Press the Transport Mode button. You can tell Transport 
Mode is enabled because this button is blue. Model 3 is 
now free-rolling and can slowly be rolled (no faster than 
walking speed) or winched.
To cancel Transport Mode, touch Transport Mode again or 
shift Model 3 into Park. If your phone key is not detected, 
canceling Transport Mode powers off Model 3. You may need 
your key card to restart the vehicle.
NOTE: If your vehicle is equipped with a lead-acid low 
voltage battery (see Jump Starting on page 222): Transport 
Mode may cancel if Model 3 loses low voltage power after 
Transport Mode is enabled.
CAUTION: If the electrical system is not working, and 
you therefore cannot use the touchscreen to activate 
Transport Mode, use self-loading dollies or tire skates. 
Before doing so, always check the manufacturer's 
specifications and recommended loading capacity.
Pull onto the Flatbed Truck
NOTE: If Model 3 has no low voltage power, you need an 
external low voltage power supply to open the hood or use 
the touchscreen (see Jump Starting on page 222).
CAUTION: To avoid damage, only pull the vehicle onto a 
flatbed truck using a properly-installed tow eye. Using 
the chassis, frame, or suspension components to pull 
the vehicle can result in damage.
1. Locate the tow eye. The tow eye is located in the front 
trunk.
2. Your vehicle is equipped with two tow eye covers: one in 
the front, and one in the rear. To open either tow eye 
cover, release the tow eye cover by pressing firmly on its 
top right perimeter until it pivots inward, then gently pull 
the raised section toward you.
NOTE: Only the front tow eye cover contains positive (+) 
and negative terminals to open the front trunk.
3. Fully insert the tow eye into the opening, then turn it 
counter-clockwise until securely fastened.
4. Attach the winch cable to the tow eye.
Instructions for Transporters
216
MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


CAUTION: Before pulling, make sure the tow eye is 
securely tightened.
5. Activate Transport Mode.
6. Pull Model 3 slowly onto the flatbed truck.
Secure the Tires
The vehicle's tires must be secured onto the truck using the 
eight-point tie-down method:
• Ensure any metal parts on the tie-down straps do not 
contact painted surfaces or the face of the wheels.
• Do not place tie-down straps over the body panels or 
through the wheels.
CAUTION: Attaching the tie-down straps to the 
chassis, suspension or other parts of the vehicle's body 
may cause damage.
If Vehicle Has No Power
If Model 3 has no low voltage power, perform the following 
steps to open the hood or jump start the low voltage battery.
1. Open the hood. See Opening the Hood with No Power on 
page 220 for more information on opening the hood if the 
vehicle does not have power.
2. Jump start the low voltage battery (see Jump Starting on 
page 222).
NOTE: Tow providers: See Running Out of Range on page 
219 for more information on transporting the vehicle to a 
charging station and preparing the vehicle to charge.
CAUTION: Because the windows automatically lower 
slightly when you open or close a door, always connect 
to an external, low voltage power supply before 
opening a door if the vehicle has no power to avoid 
breaking a window (see Jump Starting on page 222).

CAUTION: It is your responsibility to monitor the state 
of the high voltage Battery and the remaining range of 
your vehicle. Do not assume that there is any range 
available when the range displayed on the touchscreen 
is at 0 miles (0 km) (or 0%). Damage to the low voltage 
battery due to running out of range is not covered by 
the warranty.
NOTE: In the unlikely event your vehicle runs out of range 
while driving, pull over when safe to do so and contact Tesla 
Roadside Assistance on page 218 or your preferred tow 
provider.
If Model 3 runs out of range, the low voltage battery is no 
longer supported – and when low voltage is not supported, 
the vehicle cannot charge. Therefore, the low voltage battery 
must be supported by an external power supply to allow you 
to charge the High Voltage (HV) Battery. Once the vehicle 
begins charging, the external power supply is no longer 
required.
In the case of running out of range away from a charger, the 
tow provider should transport Model 3 to the nearest 
charging station and unload the vehicle within the charging 
cable's reach. Once the vehicle is positioned next to a 
charger, follow these instructions:
NOTE: If the vehicle is being transported to a charger, make 
sure the tow provider does not leave until confirming that the 
vehicle's high voltage Battery is successfully charging.
1. Jump start the low voltage system (see Jump Starting on 
page 222). The low voltage battery must be jump started 
to support the high voltage Battery.
2. Wait a few minutes. Once the touchscreen powers on, 
plug the charge cable into Model 3 to begin charging the 
high voltage Battery.
3. When Model 3 begins to charge, disconnect the external 
power supply from the low voltage battery.
Before transporting to a non-Tesla charger, ensure your 
vehicle is equipped with an adapter that accommodates the 
specific type of charging station you will be using. Even at a 
non-Tesla charger, you will need to jump start the low voltage 
system before you can begin charging.
CAUTION: Always ensure Model 3 has enough range 
for your drive, or for being stored for an extended 
period. Do not rely on the range estimates displayed on 
the touchscreen or mobile app as range can decrease 
faster than projected due to ambient temperature, 
driving habits, wind, vehicle settings (such as Sentry 
Mode), etc.
NOTE: Towing your vehicle as a result of running out of range 
is not covered by the warranty.

In Case of Emergency


Opening the Hood with No Power
In the unlikely event that Model 3 has no low voltage power, 
you will be unable to open the front trunk using the 
touchscreen or mobile app. To open the front trunk in this 
situation:
NOTE: The following steps do not open the front trunk if 
Model 3 is locked and has low voltage power.
1. Locate an external low voltage power supply (such as a 
portable jump starter).
2. Release the tow eye cover by pressing firmly on the top 
right perimeter of the cover until it pivots inward, then 
gently pulling the raised section toward you.
NOTE: Depending on production date, either the positive 
or negative terminal may be attached to the tow eye 
cover.
NOTE: Your vehicle may also have a tow eye cover near 
the rear bumper. That is used for transporting only, and 
does not contain the proper wires for jump starting. Only 
use the front tow eye cover.
3. Pull the two wires out of the tow eye opening to expose 
both terminals.
4. Connect the low voltage power supply's red positive (+) 
cable to the red positive (+) terminal.
5. Connect the low voltage power supply's black negative (-) 
cable to the black negative (-) terminal.
NOTE: Applying external low voltage power to these 
terminals only releases the hood latches. You cannot 
charge the low voltage battery using these terminals. Do 
not leave the low voltage power cables connected to the 
terminals for more than 30 seconds – remove from the 
vehicle's terminals as soon as the hood latches.
6. Turn on the external power supply (refer to the 
manufacturer’s instructions). The hood latches are 
immediately released and you can now open the hood to 
access the front trunk area.
7. Disconnect both cables, beginning with the black 
negative (-) cable.
8. If pulling the vehicle onto a flatbed truck, do not replace 
the tow eye cover yet. If necessary, install the tow eye 
cover by inserting the wires into the tow eye opening and 
aligning the tow eye cover into position and snapping it 
into place.

allow the positive cable to contact other metal 
components.
4. Connect the external low voltage power supply’s black 
negative (-) cable to the bolt located next to the brake 
fluid reservoir. The bolt is used as a grounding location for 
the external support.
5. Turn on the external power supply (refer to the 
manufacturer’s instructions) for 20 seconds only, then 
switch off or disconnect the power supply.
CAUTION: If you leave the power supply on for 
longer than 20 seconds, the low voltage battery 
may not self-recover and the vehicle might not be 
able to shift into Drive. If this occurs, after 
disconnecting the power supply, disconnect the low 
voltage battery, then reconnect the low voltage 
battery to enable another battery self-recovery 
attempt.
NOTE: If attempting to activate Transport Mode (to winch 
the vehicle onto a flatbed truck), the low voltage battery is 
not required to self-recover. Leave the power supply 
connected continuously until the vehicle has been 
secured.
6. Open the driver door and wait two minutes.
7. Ensure the vehicle is able to shift into Drive.
8. Replace the maintenance panel by placing it back in its 
original location and pressing down until it is secure.
9. Close the hood.

Rear tire tread depth low - Schedule service
Inspect tires for rotation/replacement
What this alert means:
NOTE: This alert does NOT indicate that there is a flat tire.
Your vehicle has detected that the rear tires have experienced more wear over time than the front tires, exceeding the 
recommended difference.
What to do:
It is recommended that the tread depth on all tires be inspected. As your tires wear during normal driving, the rear tires 
generally wear more quickly than the front tires.
Tire rotation is important to balance tire wear evenly across all tires. 
Failure to rotate tires as recommended poses a risk of hydroplaning and losing control of the vehicle on wet roads. Failure to 
rotate tires also decreases the life of your tires, requiring premature replacement.
It is recommended that you schedule service via your Tesla Mobile App or with an independent service provider to have your 
tires rotated when:
• The difference in tire tread depth between any front and rear tire exceeds 1.5mm
• Your vehicle has been driven for more than 6,250 miles (10,000 km) since the last rotation
Tires may need to be replaced if the rear tread depth is determined to be at an unsafe level and a tire rotation is no longer 
adequate.
Upon completion of tire inspection and any necessary tire service, update your vehicle’s tire configuration to optimize your 
vehicle settings to your tires and clear the alert for at least 6,250 miles. For more information, see Tire Care and Maintenance 
on page 183.
It is not recommended that you rely on this alert instead of routine checks of tire tread depth. This alert should only be present 
when your vehicle estimates the tires are far beyond the recommended service interval.
This alert is calibrated for Tesla tires and is not expected to work with tires of different types or sizes, including combinations 
of different tire brands or models. It may not display, or may display prematurely, on vehicles using tires not recommended by

Air pressure in tires very low
PULL OVER SAFELY - Check for flat tire
What this alert means:
This alert indicates that one or more of the tires on your vehicle is extremely low or flat.
The tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) has detected that the air pressure in one or more of your tires is significantly 
lower than the recommended cold tire pressure.
What to do:
You should pull over carefully as soon as possible. In a safe location, check for a flat tire.
You can request Tesla roadside assistance options (mobile tire, loaner wheel, tow) if required. See Contacting Tesla Roadside 
Assistance on page 218 for more information.
In a non-emergency situation, it is recommended that you visit a local tire shop for assistance or schedule service using your 
Tesla Mobile App.
See Maintaining Tire Pressures on page 183 for detailed information on where to find the recommended cold pressure (RCP) 
for your vehicle's tires, how to check tire pressures, and how to keep your tires properly inflated.
The alert will clear once the TPMS has a consistent tire pressure measurement for each of your tires within 3 psi of the 
recommended cold pressure.
• The alert and Tire Pressure indicator light may still be present immediately after you have filled your tires to the 
recommended cold pressure, but both should clear once you have driven a short distance.
• You may need to drive over 15 mph (25 km/h) for at least 10 minutes for the Tire Pressure Monitoring System to measure 
and report your updated tire pressures.
For more information on tire pressure and inflation, see Tire Care and Maintenance on page 183.
UI_a014
Air pressure below recommendation for tires
Check pressure and refill air as needed
What this alert means:
This alert does NOT indicate that there is a flat tire.
The tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) has detected that the air pressure in one or more of your tires is at least 20% 
lower than the recommended cold tire pressure.
See Maintaining Tire Pressures on page 183 for detailed information on where to find the recommended cold pressure (RCP) 
for your vehicle's tires, how to check tire pressures, and how to keep your tires properly inflated.
This alert may appear in cold weather because the air in your tires naturally contracts when it becomes cold, decreasing tire 
pressures.
What to do:
Add air to maintain the recommended cold tire pressure. Although drops in tire pressure are expected in colder weather, the 
recommended cold tire pressure should be maintained at all times.
The alert may clear as the vehicle is driven. This is because the tires will warm up and the tire pressure will increase. Even if the 
alert clears, the tires should still be refilled with air once they have cooled.
The alert will clear once the Tire Pressure Monitoring System detects that each of your tires is inflated to the recommended 
cold pressure.

Unable to charge - Mobile Connector GFCI tripped
Unplug charge handle from charge port and retry
What this alert means:
The vehicle cannot charge because the ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) in the Mobile Connector has tripped.
Like the GFCI in a wall outlet, this feature is designed to stop the flow of electricity when there is a problem. It has interrupted 
charging to protect your vehicle and the charging equipment.
This could happen for many reasons. The problem could be in the charge cable, the charge handle, the charge port, or even an 
onboard vehicle component.
What to do:
Inspect the charge port and the charge handle for pooled water or unusual levels of moisture. If you find excessive moisture, 
wait and let both the inside area of the charge port and the exposed portion of the charge handle dry sufficiently before trying 
again.
Inspect the charge equipment for damage.

Air pressure below recommendation for tires
Check pressure and refill air as needed
What this alert means:
This alert does NOT indicate that there is a flat tire.
The tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) has detected that the air pressure in one or more of your tires is at least 20% 
lower than the recommended cold tire pressure.
See Maintaining Tire Pressures on page 183 for detailed information on where to find the recommended cold pressure (RCP) 
for your vehicle's tires, how to check tire pressures, and how to keep your tires properly inflated.
This alert may appear in cold weather because the air in your tires naturally contracts when it becomes cold, decreasing tire 
pressures.
What to do:
Add air to maintain the recommended cold tire pressure. Although drops in tire pressure are expected in colder weather, the 
recommended cold tire pressure should be maintained at all times.
The alert may clear as the vehicle is driven. This is because the tires will warm up and the tire pressure will increase. Even if the 
alert clears, the tires should still be refilled with air once they have cooled.
The alert will clear once the Tire Pressure Monitoring System detects that each of your tires is inflated to the recommended 
cold pressure.
• The alert and Tire Pressure indicator light may still be present immediately after you have filled your tires to the 
recommended cold pressure, but both should clear once you have driven a short distance.
• You may need to drive over 15 mph (25 km/h) for at least 10 minutes for the Tire Pressure Monitoring System to measure 
and report your updated tire pressures.
If you repeatedly see this alert for the same tire, have the tire inspected for a slow leak. You can visit a local tire shop or 
schedule service using your Tesla Mobile App.

MODEL 3 Owner's Manual


Event Data Recorder (EDR)
Model 3 is equipped with an event data recorder (EDR). The 
main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near 
crash-like situations, data such as an airbag deployment or 
hitting a road obstacle, to better understand how the 
vehicle's systems performed. The EDR is designed to record 
data related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a 
short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in 
Model 3 is designed to record data such as:
• How various systems in your vehicle were operating;
• Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were 
buckled/fastened;
• How far (if at all) the driver was pressing the accelerator 
and/or brake pedal; and,
• How fast the vehicle was traveling.
The data can help provide a better understanding of the 
circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur.
NOTE: EDR data is recorded by your vehicle only if a non-
trivial crash situation occurs; no data is recorded by the EDR 
under normal driving conditions and no personal data (for 
example, name, gender, age, and crash location) is recorded. 
However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could 
combine the EDR data with person identifying data they 
routinely acquire during a crash investigation.
To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is 
required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In 
addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such as 
law enforcement, that have this special equipment, can read 
the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR. 
Tesla may also access the EDR remotely in some crash 
circumstances.
Vehicle Telematics
Model 3 is equipped with electronic modules that monitor 
and record data from various vehicle systems, including the 
motor, Autopilot components, Battery, braking and electrical 
systems. The electronic modules record information about 
various driving and vehicle conditions, including braking, 
acceleration, trip and other related information regarding 
your vehicle. These modules also record information about 
the vehicle’s features such as charging events and status, the 
enabling/disabling of various systems, diagnostic trouble 
codes, VIN, speed, direction and location.
The data is stored by the vehicle and may be accessed, used 
and stored by Tesla service technicians during vehicle 
servicing or periodically transmitted to Tesla wirelessly 
through the vehicle’s telematics system. This data may be 
used by Tesla for various purposes, including, but not limited 
to: providing you with Tesla telematics services; 
troubleshooting; evaluation of your vehicle’s quality, 
functionality and performance; analysis and research by Tesla 
and its partners for the improvement and design of our 
vehicles and systems; to defend Tesla; and as otherwise may 
be required by law. In servicing your vehicle, Tesla can 
potentially resolve issues remotely simply by reviewing your 
vehicle’s data log.
Tesla’s telematics system wirelessly transmits vehicle 
information to Tesla on a periodic basis. The data is used as 
previously described and helps ensure the proper 
maintenance of your vehicle. Additional Model 3 features 
may use your vehicle’s telematics system and the information 
provided, including features such as charging reminders, 
software updates, and remote access to, and control of, 
various systems of your vehicle.
Tesla does not disclose the data recorded in your vehicle to 
any third party except when:
• An agreement or consent from the vehicle’s owner (or the 
leasing company for a leased vehicle) is obtained.
• Officially requested by the police or other authorities.
• Used as a defense for Tesla.
• Ordered by a court of law.
• Used for research purposes without disclosing details of 
the vehicle owner or identification information.
• Disclosed to a Tesla affiliated company, including their 
successors or assigns, or our information systems and 
data management providers.
For additional information regarding how Tesla processes 
data collected from your vehicle, please review Tesla's 
Privacy Notice at http://www.tesla.com/about/legal.
Data Sharing
For quality assurance and to support the continuous 
improvement of advanced features such as Autopilot, your 
Model 3 may collect analytics, road segment, diagnostic, and 
vehicle usage data and send to Tesla for analysis. This 
analysis helps Tesla improve products and services by 
learning from the experience of billions of miles that Tesla 
vehicles have driven. Although Tesla shares this data with 
partners that contribute similar data, the collected 
information does not identify you personally and can be sent 
to Tesla only with your explicit consent. In order to protect 
your privacy, personal information is either not logged at all, 
is subject to privacy preserving techniques, or is removed 
from any reports before being sent to Tesla. You have control 
over what data you share by touching Controls > Software > 
Data Sharing.
For additional information regarding how Tesla processes 
data collected from your vehicle, please review Tesla's 
Privacy Notice at http://www.tesla.com/about/legal.
NOTE: Although Model 3 uses GPS in connection with driving 
and operation, as discussed in this document, Tesla does not 
record or store vehicle-specific GPS information, except the 
location where a crash occurred. Consequently, Tesla is 
unable to provide historical information about a vehicle's 
location (for example, Tesla is unable to tell you where Model 
3 was parked/traveling at a particular date/time).
