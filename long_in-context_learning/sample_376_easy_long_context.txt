Protection of the environment
+
ENVIRONMENTAL NOTE Environmental
damage due to operating conditions and
personal driving style
The pollutant emission of the vehicle is
directly related to the way you operate the
vehicle.
Operate your vehicle in an environmentally
responsible manner to help protect the envi‐
ronment. Please observe the following rec‐
ommendations on operating conditions and
personal driving style.
Operating conditions:
# Make sure that the tire pressure is cor‐
rect.
# Do not carry any unnecessary weight
(e.g. roof luggage racks once you no
longer need them).
# Adhere to the service intervals.
A regularly serviced vehicle will contrib‐
ute to environmental protection.
# Always have maintenance work carried
out at a qualified specialist workshop.
Personal driving style:
# Do not depress the accelerator pedal
when starting the engine.
# Do not warm up the engine while the
vehicle is stationary.
# Drive carefully and maintain a suitable
distance from the vehicle in front.
# Avoid frequent, sudden acceleration
and braking.
# Change gear in good time and use each
gear only up to Ô of its maximum
engine speed.
# Switch off the engine in stationary traf‐
fic, e.g. by using the ECO start/stop
function.
# Drive in a fuel-efficient manner.
Observe the ECO display for an eco‐
nomical driving style.
Environmental issues and recommendations
It is recommended that you re-use or recycle
materials instead of just disposing of them.
The relevant environmental guidelines and regu‐
lations serve to protect the environment and
must be strictly observed.
Genuine Mercedes-Benz parts
+
ENVIRONMENTAL NOTE Environmental
damage due to not using recycled recon‐
ditioned components
Mercedes‑Benz AG offers recycled recondi‐
tioned components and parts with the same
quality as new parts. The same entitlement
from the Limited Warranty is valid as for new
parts.
# Use recycled reconditioned compo‐
nents and parts from
Mercedes‑Benz AG.
General notes
25


*
NOTE Impairment of the operating effi‐
ciency of the restraint systems from
installing accessory parts or from repairs
or welding
Airbags and Emergency Tensioning Devices,
as well as control units and sensors for the
restraint systems, may be installed in the fol‐
lowing areas of your vehicle:
R Doors
R Door pillars
R Door sills
R Seats
R Cockpit
R Instrument cluster
R Center console
R Lateral roof frame
# Do not install accessory parts such as
audio systems in these areas.
# Do not carry out repairs or welding.
# Have accessory parts retrofitted at a
qualified specialist workshop.
You could jeopardize the operating safety of your
vehicle if you use parts, tires and wheels as well
as accessories relevant to safety which have not
been approved by Mercedes-Benz. Safety-rele‐
vant systems, e.g. the brake system, may mal‐
function. Only use genuine Mercedes-Benz parts
or parts of equal quality. Only use tires, wheels
and accessory parts that have been specifically
approved for your vehicle model.
Genuine Mercedes-Benz parts are subject to
strict quality inspections. Each part has been
specially developed, manufactured or selected
for Mercedes-Benz vehicles and adapted to
them. Therefore, only genuine Mercedes-Benz
parts should be used.
More than 300,000 different genuine Mercedes-
Benz parts are available for Mercedes-Benz mod‐
els.
All authorized Mercedes-Benz Centers maintain
a supply of genuine Mercedes-Benz parts for
necessary service and repair work. In addition,
strategically located parts delivery centers pro‐
vide for quick and reliable parts service.
Always specify the vehicle identification number
(VIN) (/ page 492) when ordering genuine
Mercedes-Benz parts.
Operator's Manual
This Operator's Manual describes all models and
all standard and optional equipment available for
your vehicle at the time of this Operator's Man‐
ual going to press. Country-specific differences
are possible. Note that your vehicle may not be
equipped with all features described. This is also
the case for systems and functions relevant to
safety. Therefore, the equipment on your vehicle
may differ from that in the descriptions and illus‐
trations.
The original purchase agreement for your vehicle
contains a list of all of the systems in your vehi‐
cle.
Should you have any questions concerning
equipment and operation, please consult an
authorized Mercedes-Benz Center.
The Operator's Manual and Maintenance Booklet
are important documents and should be kept in
the vehicle.

General notes


Touch-sensitive controls
In addition to conventional switches and but‐
tons, your vehicle is equipped with touch-sensi‐
tive controls.
These are located in the following areas of your
vehicle:
R Roof and door control panel
R Climate control
R Steering wheel
R MBUX multimedia system
The controls have touch-sensitive user interface
surfaces. The surfaces are controlled by press‐
ing or swiping to adjust settings or to trigger
functions, for example.
In the area of the touchscreen, you also receive
haptic feedback in the form of a pulse or a vibra‐
tion, or the surface structure changes on the
touch-sensitive user interface surface, for exam‐
ple.
You receive haptic feedback in the following sit‐
uations, for example:
R When pressing a button on the user interface
surface
R When scrolling in a list or table
R When reaching a new area on the user inter‐
face surface, e.g. a pop-up window
When handling touch-sensitive user interface
surfaces, observe the following points to avoid
problems operating:
R Do not affix stickers or similar objects on the
surfaces
R Keep the surfaces protected from moisture
and wet conditions
R Keep the surfaces free of dust and dirt
Some touch-sensitive control elements have a
symbol and integrated indicator lamps. When
operating, make sure to press on the symbol of
the control element.
Service and vehicle operation
Vehicle operation outside the USA or Canada
When you are abroad with your vehicle, observe
the following points:
R Service points or replacement parts may not
be available immediately.
R Unleaded fuel may not be available for vehi‐
cles with a catalytic converter. Leaded fuel
may cause damage to the catalytic converter.
R The fuel may have an extremely low octane
number. Unsuitable fuel can cause engine
damage.
Some Mercedes-Benz models are available in
Europe through our European Delivery Program.

Notes for persons with electronic medical
aids
Mercedes-Benz AG cannot, despite carefully
developing vehicle systems, completely rule out
the interaction of vehicle systems with electronic
medical aids such as cardiac pacemakers.
In addition, there are components installed in
the vehicle that, regardless of the operating sta‐
tus of the vehicle, can generate magnetic fields
on a par with permanent magnets. These fields
can be found, for example, in the area around
the multimedia and sound system or also in the
area of the seats, depending on the vehicle
equipment.
For this reason, the following can occur in isola‐
ted cases, depending on the aids used:
R Medical aids malfunctioning
R Adverse health effects
Observe the notes and warnings of the manufac‐
turer of the medical aids; if in doubt, contact the
device manufacturer and/or your doctor. If there
is continuing uncertainty concerning the possi‐
bility of medical aids malfunctioning, Mercedes-
Benz AG recommends using only few electrical
vehicle systems and/or maintaining a distance
from the components.
Only have repairs and maintenance work in the
area of the following components carried out by
a qualified specialist workshop:
R Vehicle components carrying live voltage
R Transmission antenna
R Multimedia system and sound system
If you have any queries or suggestions, consult a
qualified specialist workshop.

Data storage
Data processing in the vehicle
Electronic control units
Electronic control units are installed in your vehi‐
cle. Control units process data which, for exam‐
ple, they receive from vehicle sensors, generate
themselves or exchange between themselves.
Some control units are required for the safe
operation of your vehicle, some assist you when
driving, such as driver assistance systems, while
others enable convenience or infotainment func‐
tions.
The following provides you with general informa‐
tion regarding data processing in the vehicle.
Additional information regarding exactly which
data in your vehicle are collected, saved and
transmitted to third parties, and for what pur‐
pose, can be found in the information directly
related to the functional characteristics in ques‐
tion in their respective Operator's Manual. This
information is also available online and, depend‐
ing on the vehicle equipment, digitally.
Personal data
Every vehicle is identified by a unique vehicle
identification number. Depending on the coun‐
try, this vehicle identification number can be
used by, for example, governmental authorities
to determine the identity of the owner. There are
other possibilities to use data collected from the
vehicle to identify the owner or driver, such as
the license plate number.
Therefore, data generated or processed by con‐
trol units may be attributable to a person or,
under certain conditions, become attributable to
a person. Depending on which vehicle data are
available, it may be possible to make inferences
about, for example, your driving behavior, your
location, your route or your use patterns.
Legal requirements regarding the disclosure
of data
If legally required to do so, manufacturers are, in
individual cases, legally obliged to provide gov‐
ernmental entities, upon request and to the
extent required, data stored by the manufac‐
turer. For example, this may be the case during
the investigation of a criminal offense.
Governmental entities are themselves, in individ‐
ual cases and within the applicable legal frame‐
work, authorized to read out data from the vehi‐
cle. In the case of an accident, information that
can help with an investigation can, therefore, be
taken from the airbag control unit, for example.
Operational data in the vehicle
This is data regarding the operation of the vehi‐
cle, which have been processed by control units.
This includes the following data, for example:
R Vehicle status information such as the speed,
longitudinal acceleration, lateral accelera‐
tion, number of wheel revolutions or the fas‐
tened seat belts display
R Ambient conditions, such as temperature,
rain sensor or distance sensor
Generally, the use of these data is temporary;
they will not be stored beyond the period of
operation and will only be processed within the
36
General notes


vehicle itself. Control units often contain data
memories for vehicle keys, for example. Their
use permits the temporary or permanent docu‐
mentation of technical information about the
vehicle's operating state, component loads,
maintenance requirements and technical events
or malfunctions.
Depending on the vehicle equipment, the follow‐
ing data are stored:
R Operating status of system components,
such as fill levels, tire pressure or battery
status
R Malfunctions or faults in important system
components, such as lights or brakes
R System reactions in special driving situa‐
tions, such as airbag deployment or the inter‐
vention of stability control systems
R Information on events leading to vehicle
damage
In certain cases, it may be required to store data
that would have otherwise been used only tem‐
porarily. This may be the case if the vehicle has
detected a malfunction, for example.
If you use services, such as repair services and
maintenance work, stored operational data as
well as the vehicle identification number can be
read out and used. They can be read out by
service network employees, such as workshops
and manufacturers or third parties, such as
breakdown services. The same is true in the
case of warranty claims and quality assurance
measures.
In general, the readout is performed via the
legally prescribed port for the diagnostics con‐
nection in the vehicle. The operational data that
are read out document technical states of the
vehicle or of individual components and assist in
the diagnosis of malfunctions, compliance with
warranty obligations and quality improvement.
To that end, these data, in particular information
about component loads, technical events, mal‐
functions and other faults may be transmitted
along with the vehicle identification number to
the manufacturer. Furthermore, the manufac‐
turer is subject to product liability. For this rea‐
son the manufacturer also uses operational data
from the vehicle, for example, for recalls. These
data can also be used to examine the custom‐
er's warranty and guarantee claims.
Fault memories in the vehicle can be reset by a
service outlet or at your request as part of repair
or maintenance work.
Convenience and infotainment functions
You can store convenience settings and individ‐
ual settings in the vehicle and change or reset
them at any time.
Depending on the vehicle equipment, this
includes the following settings, for example:
R Seat and steering wheel positions
R Suspension and climate control settings
R Individual settings, such as interior lighting
Depending on the selected equipment, you can
import data into vehicle infotainment functions
yourself.
Depending on the vehicle equipment, this
includes the following data, for example:
R Multimedia data, such as music, films or pho‐
tos for playback in an integrated multimedia
system
General notes
37


R Address book data for use in connection with
an integrated hands-free system or an inte‐
grated navigation system
R Entered navigation destinations
R Data about the use of Internet services
These data for convenience and infotainment
functions may be saved locally in the vehicle or
they may be located on a device which you have
connected to the vehicle, such as a smartphone,
USB flash drive or MP3 player. If you have
entered these data yourself, you can delete them
at any time.
This data is transmitted from the vehicle to third
parties only at your request. This applies, in par‐
ticular, when you use online services in accord‐
ance with the settings that you have selected.
Smartphone integration (e.g. Android Auto or
Apple CarPlay®)
If your vehicle is accordingly equipped, you can
connect your smartphone or another mobile end
device to the vehicle. You can then control them
by means of the control elements integrated in
the vehicle. Images and audio from the smart‐
phone can be output via the multimedia system.
Certain information is simultaneously transfer‐
red to your smartphone. Depending on the type
and integration, this includes position data, day/
night mode and other general vehicle statuses.
For more information please consult the Opera‐
tor's Manual of the vehicle/infotainment system.
This integration allows the use of selected
smartphone apps, such as navigation or music
player apps. There is no further interaction
between the smartphone and the vehicle; in par‐
ticular, vehicle data is not directly accessible.
The type of additional data processing is deter‐
mined by the provider of the app being used.
Which settings you can make, if any, depends on
the specific app and the operating system of
your smartphone.
Online services
Wireless network connection
If your vehicle has a wireless network connec‐
tion, it enables data to be exchanged between
your vehicle and additional systems. The wire‐
less network connection is made possible by the
vehicle's own transmitter and receiver or by a
mobile end device that you have brought into the
vehicle, for example, a smartphone. Online func‐
tions can be used via the wireless network con‐
nection. This includes online services and appli‐
cations/apps provided to you by the manufac‐
turer or by other providers.
Manufacturer's services
Regarding the manufacturer's online services,
the individual functions are described by the
manufacturer in a suitable place, for example, in
the Operator's Manual or on the manufacturer's
website, where the relevant data protection
information is also given. Personal data may be
used for the provision of online services. Data
are exchanged via a secure connection, such as
the manufacturer's designated IT systems. Any
personal data which are collected, processed
and used, other than for the provision of serv‐
ices, is done so exclusively on the basis of legal
permission. This is the case, for example, for a
legally prescribed emergency call system, a con‐
tractual agreement or when consent has been
given.
38
General notes


You can have services and functions, some of
which are subject to a fee, activated or deactiva‐
ted. This excludes legally prescribed functions
and services, such as an emergency call system.
Third party services
If you use online services from other providers
(third parties), these services are the responsi‐
bility of the provider in question and subject to
that provider's data protection conditions and
terms of use. As a general rule, the manufac‐
turer has no influence on the content
exchanged.
For this reason, when services are provided by
third parties, please ask the service provider in
question for information about the type, extent
and purpose of the collection and use of per‐
sonal data.
Data protection rights
Depending on your country or the equipment
and range of functions of your vehicle as well as
the services you use and the services on offer,
you are entitled to different data protection
rights. Further information on data protection
and your data protection rights can either be
found on the manufacturer's website or you will
receive this information as part of the various
services and service offers. There you will also
find the contact information for the manufac‐
turer and its data protection officers.
At a workshop, for example, with the support of
a specialist and possibly for a fee, you can have
data read out which is stored only locally in the
vehicle.
MBUX multimedia system/Mercedes me
connect
If the vehicle is equipped with the MBUX multi‐
media system or Mercedes me connect, addi‐
tional data about the vehicle's operation, the use
of the vehicle in certain situations, and the loca‐
tion of the vehicle may be compiled by the
MBUX multimedia system or Mercedes me con‐
nect.
For additional information, please refer to the
"MBUX multimedia system" section and/or the
Mercedes me connect Terms and Conditions.
Event data recorders
USA only:
This vehicle is equipped with an event data
recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR is
to record, in certain crash or near crash-like sit‐
uations, such as an airbag deployment or hitting
a road obstacle, data that will assist in under‐
standing how a vehicle's systems performed.
The EDR is designed to record data related to
vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short
period of time, typically 30 seconds or less.
The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record
such data as:
R How various systems in your vehicle were
operating
R Whether or not the driver and front
passenger seat belts were buckled/fastened
R How far (if at all) the driver was depressing
the accelerator and/or brake pedal and
R How fast the vehicle was traveling
This data can help provide a better understand‐
ing of the circumstances in which accidents and
injuries occur. NOTE: EDR data is recorded by
General notes
39


your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situation
occurs; no data is recorded by the EDR under
normal driving conditions and no personal data
(e.g. name, gender, age and accident location) is
recorded. However, other parties, such as law
enforcement, could combine EDR data with the
type of personally identifying data routinely
acquired during a crash investigation.
To read data recorded by an EDR, special equip‐
ment is required, and access to the vehicle or
the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle
manufacturer, other parties that have the special
equipment, such as law enforcement, can read
the information by accessing the vehicle or the
EDR.
EDR data may be used in civil and criminal mat‐
ters as a tool in accident reconstruction, acci‐
dent claims and vehicle safety. Since the Crash
Data Retrieval (CDR) tool that is used to extract
data from the EDR is commercially available,
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC ("MBUSA") expressly
disclaims any and all liability arising from the
extraction of this information by unauthorized
Mercedes-Benz personnel.
MBUSA will not share EDR data with others with‐
out the consent of the vehicle owner or, if the
vehicle is leased, without the consent of the les‐
see. Exceptions to this representation include
responses to subpoenas by law enforcement; by
federal, state or local government; in connection
with or arising out of litigation involving MBUSA
or its subsidiaries and affiliates; or, as required
by law.
Warning: The EDR is a component of the
Restraint System Module. Tampering with, alter‐
ing, modifying or removing the EDR component
may result in a malfunction of the Restraint Sys‐
tem Module and other systems.
State laws or regulations regarding EDRs that
conflict with federal regulation are pre-empted.
This means that in the event of such conflict, the
federal regulation governs. As of December
2016, 17 states have enacted laws relating to
EDRs.

restraint system can also reduce the forces to
which the vehicle occupants are subjected.
A seat belt can only provide the best level of pro‐
tection if it is worn correctly. Depending on the
detected accident situation, Emergency Tension‐
ing Devices and/or airbags supplement the pro‐
tection offered by a correctly worn seat belt.
Emergency Tensioning Devices and/or airbags
are not deployed in every accident.
In order for the restraint system to provide the
intended level of protection, each vehicle occu‐
pant must observe the following information:
R Fasten seat belts correctly.
R Sit in an almost upright seat position with
their back against the seat backrest.
R Sit with their feet resting on the floor, if pos‐
sible.
R Always secure persons under 5 ft (1.50 m)
tall in an additional restraint system suitable
for Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
However, no system available today can com‐
pletely eliminate injuries and fatalities in every
accident situation. In particular, the seat belt
and airbag generally do not protect against
objects penetrating the vehicle from the outside.
It is also not possible to completely rule out the
risk of injury caused by the airbag deploying.
Reduced restraint system protection
&
WARNING Risk of injury or death due to
modifications to the restraint system
Vehicle occupants may no longer be protec‐
ted as intended if alterations are made to the
restraint system.
# Never alter the parts of the restraint
system.
# Never tamper with the wiring or any
electronic component parts or their
software.
If it is necessary to modify the vehicle to accom‐
modate a person with disabilities, contact an
authorized Mercedes-Benz Center for details.
USA only: for details, contact our Customer
Assistance Center on 1-800-FOR-MERCedes

Restraint system functionality
When the ignition is switched on, a self-test is
performed, during which the 6 restraint sys‐
42
Occupant safety


tem warning lamp lights up. It goes out no later
than a few seconds after the vehicle is started.
The components of the restraint system are then
functional.
Malfunctioning restraint system
A malfunction has occurred in the restraint sys‐
tem if:
R The 6 restraint system warning lamp
does not light up when the ignition is
switched on
R The 6 restraint system warning lamp
lights up continuously or repeatedly during a
journey
&
WARNING Risk of injury due to malfunc‐
tions in the restraint system
Components in the restraint system may be
activated unintentionally or not deploy as
planned in an accident.
# Have the restraint system checked and
repaired immediately at a qualified spe‐
cialist workshop.
Function of the restraint system in an acci‐
dent
How the restraint system works depends on the
severity of the impact detected and the apparent
type of accident:
R Frontal impact
R Rear impact
R Side impact
R Rollover
The activation thresholds for the components of
the restraint system are determined based on
the evaluation of the sensor values measured at
various points in the vehicle. This process is pre-
emptive in nature. The triggering/deployment of
the components of the restraint system must
take place in good time at the start of the colli‐
sion.
Factors which can only be seen and measured
after a collision has occurred cannot play a deci‐
sive role in airbag deployment. Nor do they pro‐
vide an indication of airbag deployment.
The vehicle may be deformed significantly with‐
out an airbag being deployed. This is the case if
only parts which are relatively easily deformed
are affected and the rate of vehicle deceleration
is not high. Conversely, an airbag may be
deployed even though the vehicle suffers only
minor deformation. If very rigid vehicle parts
such as longitudinal members are hit, this may
result in sufficiently high levels of vehicle decel‐
eration.
Depending on the detected deployment situa‐
tion, the components of the restraint system can
be activated or deployed independently of each
other:
R Emergency Tensioning Device: frontal
impact, rear impact, side impact, rollover
R Driver's airbag, front passenger airbag: fron‐
tal impact
R Knee airbag: frontal impact
R Side airbag: side impact
R Window curtain airbag: side impact, rollover,
frontal impact
R Rear airbag: frontal impact
R Belt airbag: frontal impact
R Cushionbag: frontal impact
Occupant safety

R PRE-SAFE® Impulse Side: side impact
The front passenger airbag can only be deployed
in an accident if the PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF
indicator lamp is off. If the front passenger seat
is occupied, make sure, both before and during
the journey, that the status of the front
passenger airbag is correct (/ page 55).
&
WARNING Risk of burns from hot air bag
components
The air bag parts are hot after an air bag has
been deployed.
# Do not touch the air bag parts.
# Have a deployed air bag replaced at a
qualified specialist workshop as soon
as possible.
Mercedes-Benz recommends that you have the
vehicle towed to a qualified specialist workshop
after an accident. Take this into account, partic‐
ularly if an Emergency Tensioning Device is trig‐
gered or an airbag deployed.
If the Emergency Tensioning Devices are trig‐
gered or an airbag is deployed, you will hear a
bang, and a small amount of powder may also be
released:
R The bang will not generally affect your hear‐
ing.
R In general, the powder released is not haz‐
ardous to health but may cause short-term
breathing difficulties to persons suffering
from asthma or other pulmonary conditions.
Provided it is safe to do so, leave the vehicle
immediately or open the window in order to
prevent breathing difficulties.
Airbags and pyrotechnic Emergency Tensioning
Devices contain perchlorate material, which may
require special handling or environmental pro‐
tection measures. National guidelines regarding
waste disposal must be observed. In California,
see https://dtsc.ca.gov/. Using the search
function, you will find information on perchlo‐
rate, for example.
Seat belts
Protection provided by the seat belt
Always fasten your seat belt correctly before
starting a journey. A seat belt can only provide
the best level of protection if it is worn correctly.
&
WARNING Risk of injury or death due to
incorrectly fastened seat belt
If the seat belt is not worn correctly, it can‐
not perform its intended protective function.
In addition, an incorrectly fastened seat belt
can also cause injuries, for example, in the
event of an accident or when braking or
changing direction suddenly.
# Always ensure that all vehicle occu‐
pants have their seat belts fastened
correctly and are sitting properly.
Always observe the instructions about the cor‐
rect driver's seat position and adjusting the seat
(/ page 106).

Occupant safety


In order for the correctly worn seat belt to pro‐
vide the intended level of protection, each vehi‐
cle occupant must observe the following infor‐
mation:
R The seat belt must not be twisted and must
fit tightly and snugly across the body.
R The seat belt must be routed across the cen‐
ter of the shoulder and as low down across
the hips as possible.
R The shoulder section of the seat belt should
not touch your neck nor be routed under
your arm or behind your back.
R Avoid wearing bulky clothing, e.g. a winter
coat.
R Push the lap belt down as far as possible
across your hips and pull tight with the shoul‐
der section of the belt. Never route the lap
belt across your abdomen.
Pregnant women must also take particular
care with this.
R Never route the seat belt across sharp, poin‐
ted, abrasive or fragile objects.
R Only one person should use each seat belt at
any one time. Never allow babies and chil‐
dren to travel sitting on the lap of another
vehicle occupant.
R Never secure objects with a seat belt if the
seat belt is also being used by one of the
vehicle's occupants. Always observe the
instructions for loading the vehicle when
securing objects, luggage or loads
(/ page 134).
Also ensure that no objects, e.g. a cushion,
are ever placed between a person and the
seat.

Information on the rear airbag
Points to remember when the rear seat is
occupied
The rear airbag offers the occupants on the
outer rear seats additional occupant protection
in the event of certain types frontal impacts.
When triggered, the rear airbag deploys between
the rear seat occupant and the front seat. The
rear airbag can help prevent the occupants on
the rear seats from coming into contact with
parts of the vehicle interior in the event of an
accident.
To avoid the risks resulting from the deployment
of an airbag, observe the following information:
R Inform persons on the rear seats about the
rear airbag in the front seat.
R A person sitting on the rear seat must adopt
the correct seat position and sit as far back
Occupant safety

from the rear airbag as possible. Adjust the
front seats when necessary so that vehicle
occupants are sitting as far back from the
airbag as possible and at an equal distance
to them.
R Observe the notes on airbag protection
(/ page 51).
To avoid risks resulting from the deployment of
the airbag, vehicle occupants on the outer rear
seats must observe the following information in
particular:
R The occupants must always keep their feet
on the floor. Otherwise, feet and legs of
occupants may be in the deployment area of
the rear airbag.
If an occupant's feet cannot reach the floor,
they must adopt the correct seat position
and let their legs hang down the front of the
seat.
R The feet or legs of the person on the rear
seat must not rest against the seat backrest
of the front seat, for example. Otherwise,
their feet and legs are in the deployment
area of the rear airbag. This should be taken
into consideration especially if you are travel‐
ing with a child on the rear seat.
If you are traveling with a child in the left or
right rear seat, observe the vehicle-specific
information: (/ page 70). Also, always
observe the notes on rearward-facing or
forward-facing child restraint systems on the
left and right rear seats.
R Make sure that the covers for the rear air‐
bags are not damaged.
R Observe the notes on limitations to the pro‐
tection provided by airbags (/ page 52).
&
WARNING Risk of injury due to a dam‐
aged rear airbag cover
If a rear airbag cover is damaged, the rear
airbag can no longer function correctly and
can even cause additional injuries when
deployed.
# Before starting a journey, make sure the
covers for the rear airbags are not dam‐
aged. If a rear airbag cover is damaged,
disable the rear airbag. Have a dam‐
aged rear airbag cover replaced at a
qualified specialist workshop as soon
as possible.
You can disable or enable the rear airbag via the
multimedia system (/ page 60).
Objects behind the front seat
Objects in the deployment area of the rear air‐
bags may prevent the rear airbags from function‐
ing correctly.
&
WARNING Risk of injury due to objects
placed in front of the rear airbag cover
Objects in front of the rear airbag cover can
hinder or prevent the correct deployment of
the rear airbag which is integrated into the
front seat.
The rear airbag can potentially deploy in an
uncontrolled manner and can cause addi‐
tional injury to the person on the front seat.
# Always stow and secure objects cor‐
rectly.

Disabling/enabling the rear airbag
If, after consideration of the notes and instruc‐
tions in this Operator's Manual, you deem the
additional occupant protection provided by the
rear airbag unnecessary, the rear airbag can be
disabled.
The rear airbags should be disabled in the follow‐
ing situations in particular:
R A rearward-facing child restraint system is
secured on the left or right rear seat.
R The person in the rear seat, for example a
child, cannot sit in the correct seat position.
Their feet and legs are potentially in the
deployment area of the rear airbag.
R Due to the position of the front seats, an
occupant's legs, for example, are in the
deployment area of the rear airbag.
R Objects are stored behind the front seat
which are in the deployment area of the rear

Automatic measures after an accident
Depending on the type and severity of the acci‐
dent, and depending on the vehicle's equipment,
the following measures can be implemented, for
example:
R Automatic braking (post-collision brake)
R Activating the hazard warning lights
R Triggering an automatic emergency call
(/ page 327)
R Switching off the engine
To restart the vehicle, switch the ignition off
and switch it back on (/ page 190).
Depending on the type and severity of the
accident, it is possible that the vehicle can
no longer be started.
R Switching off the fuel supply
R Unlocking the vehicle doors
R Lowering the side windows
R Displaying the emergency guide in the cen‐
tral display
R Switching on the interior lighting
Function of the post-collision brake
Depending on the accident situation, the post-
collision brake can minimize the severity of a fur‐
ther collision or even avoid it.
If an accident is detected, the post-collision
brake can implement automatic braking. When
the vehicle has come to a standstill, the electric
parking brake is automatically applied.
The driver can cancel automatic braking by tak‐
ing the following actions:
R Braking more strongly than automatic brak‐
ing
Occupant safety
61


R Fully depressing the accelerator pedal with
force
Safely transporting children in the vehicle
Always observe when children are traveling
in the vehicle
% Also strictly observe the safety notes for the
specific situation. In this way you can recog‐
nize potential risks and avoid dangers if chil‐
dren are traveling in the vehicle
(/ page 63).
Be diligent
Bear in mind that negligence when securing a
child in the child restraint system may have seri‐
ous consequences. Always be diligent in secur‐
ing a child carefully before every journey.
To improve protection for children younger than
12 years old or under 5 ft (1.50 m) in height,
Mercedes-Benz recommends you observe the
following information:
R Always secure the child in a child restraint
system suitable for this Mercedes-Benz vehi‐
cle.
R The child restraint system must be appropri‐
ate to the age, weight and size of the child.
R The vehicle seat must be suitable for instal‐
ling a child restraint system.
Accident statistics show that children secured
on the rear seats are generally safer than chil‐
dren secured on the front seats. For this reason,
Mercedes-Benz strongly advises that you install
a child restraint system on a rear seat.
The generic term child restraint system
The generic term child restraint system is used
in this Operator's Manual. A child restraint sys‐
tem is, for example:
R A baby car seat
R A rearward-facing child seat
R A forward-facing child seat
R A child booster seat with a backrest and seat
belt guide
Mercedes-Benz recommends using a child
booster seat with a backrest.
The child restraint system must be appropriate
to the age, weight and size of the child.
Observe laws and legal requirements
Always observe the legal requirements when
using a child restraint system in the vehicle.
Observe standards for child restraint sys‐
tems
All child restraint systems must meet the follow‐
ing standards:
R U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards
213 and 225
R Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards
213 and 210.2
Confirmation that the child restraint system
complies with the standards can be found on an
instruction label on the child restraint system.
This confirmation can also be found in the instal‐
lation instructions that are included with the
child restraint system.

Occupant safety


Detecting risks, avoiding danger
Securing systems for child restraint systems
in the vehicle
Only use the following securing systems for child
restraint systems:
R The LATCH-type (ISOFIX) securing rings
R The vehicle's seat belt system
R The Top Tether anchorages
Installing a LATCH-type (ISOFIX) child restraint
system is preferred.
Simply attaching to the securing rings on the
vehicle can reduce the risk of installing the child
restraint system incorrectly.
When securing a child with the integrated seat
belt of the LATCH-type (ISOFIX) child restraint
system, always comply with the permissible
gross weight for the child and child restraint sys‐
tem (/ page 67).
A booster seat may be necessary to achieve
proper seat belt positioning for children over
40 lbs (18 kg) in weight or until they reach a
height where a three-point seat belt can be
installed properly without a booster seat.
Mercedes-Benz recommends a suitable child
booster seat with a backrest and seat belt guide.
Advantage of a rearward-facing child
restraint system
It is preferable to transport a baby or a small
child in a suitable rearward-facing child restraint
system. In this case, the child sits in the oppo‐
site direction to the direction of travel and faces
backwards.
Babies and small children have comparatively
weak neck muscles in relation to the size and
weight of their head. The risk of injury to the cer‐
vical spine during an accident can be reduced in
a rearward-facing child restraint system.
Always secure a child restraint system cor‐
rectly
&
WARNING Risk of injury or death due to
incorrect installation of the child
restraint system
The child can then not be protected or
restrained as intended.
# Be sure to comply with the manufactur‐
er's installation instructions for the
child restraint system and its correct
use.
# Make sure that the entire base of the
child restraint system always rests on
the sitting surface of the seat.
# Never place objects (e.g. cushions)
under or behind the child restraint sys‐
tem.
# Use child restraint systems only with
the original cover designed for them.
# Always replace damaged covers with
genuine covers.

when using a rearward-facing child
restraint system while the co-driver air‐
bag is enabled
If you secure a child in a rearward-facing
child restraint system on the co-driver seat
and the PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF indicator
lamp is off, the co-driver airbag can deploy in
the event of an accident.
The child could be struck by the airbag.
# Always ensure that the co-driver airbag
is disabled. The PASSENGER AIR BAG
OFF indicator lamp must be lit.
# NEVER use a rearward-facing child
restraint system on a seat with an ENA‐
BLED FRONT AIRBAG; DEATH or SERI‐
OUS INJURY to the CHILD can occur.
Observe the specific instructions for the rear‐
ward-facing and forward-facing child restraint
systems (/ page 72).
Always observe the status of the front passenger
airbag on the PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF indica‐
tor lamp:
R When using a rearward-facing child restraint
system on the front passenger seat, the front
passenger airbag must always be disabled.

vehicle, this will result in restrictions on the
maximum size setting for child restraint sys‐
tems in weight category II or III.
Contact with the roof when the head
restraint is fully extended and locked in
place will not result in any restrictions on
use.
O The child restraint system must not be put
under strain between the roof and the seat
cushion and/or be installed facing the
wrong direction.
O The child restraint system must not be put
under strain by the head restraint. Adjust

ITAL LIGHT
Intelligent Light System function
In this system, the headlamps adapt to the driv‐
ing and weather situation. It also provides exten‐
ded functions for improved illumination of the
road.
% The availability of the functions is dependent
on the country.
The system comprises the following functions:
R Active headlamps (/ page 158)
R Cornering light (/ page 158)
R Highway mode (/ page 159)
R Enhanced fog light function (/ page 159)
R Bad weather light (/ page 159)
R City lighting (/ page 159)
R Topographical compensation (vehicles with
DIGITAL LIGHT) (/ page 159)
The system is active only when it is dark.
Active headlamps function
R The headlamps follow the steering move‐
ments.
R Relevant areas are better illuminated during
a journey.
The functions are active when the low beam is
switched on.
Depending on the vehicle's equipment, the
course of the lane in which you are driving will
also be evaluated and the active headlamps
function will adjust the light in advance.
Cornering light function
The cornering light improves the illumination of
the road over a wide angle in the turning direc‐
tion, enabling better visibility on tight curves, for
example. It can be activated only when the low
beam is switched on.
The function is active in the following cases:
R At speeds below 25 mph (40 km/h) when
the turn signal light is switched on or the
steering wheel is turned
R At speeds between 25 mph (40 km/h) and
43 mph (70 km/h) and when the steering
wheel is turned
158 Light and visibility


Roundabout and intersection function: the
cornering light will be activated on both sides
based on an evaluation of the vehicle's current
navigation position. It will remain active until
after the vehicle has left the roundabout or the
intersection.
Highway mode function (Canada)
Highway mode increases the range and bright‐
ness of the cone of light, enabling better visibil‐
ity.
The function will be active if a highway journey is
detected by means of:
R The vehicle's speed
R The multifunction camera
R The navigation system
The function is not active in the following cases:
R At speeds below 50 mph (80 km/h)
Enhanced fog light function (Canada)
The enhanced fog light function reduces self-
blinding and improves the illumination of the
edge of the road.
The function is automatically activated under the
following conditions:
R At speeds below 43 mph (70 km/h) and
when the rear fog light is switched on.
The function is automatically deactivated under
the following conditions:
R When speeds greater than 62 mph
(100 km/h) are reached.
R When the rear fog light is switched off.
Function of the bad weather light (Canada)
The bad weather light reduces reflections in
rainy conditions by dimming individual LEDs in
the headlamps. The driver and other road users
are blinded less as a result.
The city lighting function (Canada)
City lighting improves the illumination of road‐
sides in urban areas using a broad distribution of
light.
The function is active in the following cases:
R At low speeds
R In illuminated parts of urban areas
Function of the topographical compensation
Based on map data, the lighting system
responds pre-emptively to different road heights.
This means that the headlamp range remains vir‐
Light and visibility 159


tually constant when you are driving on uphill or
downhill gradients.
% Only vehicles with a multimedia system with
navigation have this function.
Assistance functions of the DIGITAL LIGHT
DIGITAL LIGHT visually expands on the driver
assistance systems by projecting the assistant
displays in front of the vehicle while it is in
motion. DIGITAL LIGHT can therefore help the
driver in critical situations.
% The availability of the functions is country-
dependent.
The system is active in the following cases:
R The light switch is in the Ã position.
R The high beam is switched on.
% If you activate the Head-up Display with aug‐
mented reality, the projections can be deac‐
tivated depending on the situation.
% Depending on the country in which you are
currently driving, certain functions may be
disabled due to different legal requirements,
even if they are enabled in the multimedia
system. When a border is crossed, the vehi‐
cle will automatically adapt to the valid
requirements.
Spotlight
The spotlight function runs in the background
and flashes the headlamps at detected persons
within the lane markings in four short bursts.
The driver is made aware of the position of
oncoming pedestrians by a projected symbol.
The function is active under the following condi‐
tions:
R You are driving outside illuminated areas.
R The system detects a lane marking.
Warnings
If Traffic Sign Assist detects a corresponding sit‐
uation, a triangle will be projected onto the road
in the following situations at speeds of at least
30 km/h:
R You are driving in the opposite direction to
the permissible direction of travel, e.g. on a
freeway access road.
R You are driving towards a stop sign without
reducing your speed.

Breaking-in notes
To preserve the engine during the first
1,000 miles (1,500 km):
R Drive at varying road speeds and engine
speeds.
R Do not drive at speeds greater than 85 mph
(140 km/h).
R Drive the vehicle in drive program A
or ;.
R Shift to the next highest gear at the very lat‐
est when the needle reaches the last third
before the red area in the tachometer.
R Do not shift down manually in order to brake.
R Avoid overstraining the vehicle, e.g. driving at
full throttle.
R Do not depress the accelerator pedal past
the pressure point (kickdown).
R Only increase the engine speed gradually and
accelerate the vehicle to full speed after
1,000 miles (1,500 km).
This also applies when the engine or parts of the
drivetrain have been replaced.
Please also observe the following breaking-in
notes:
R In certain driving and driving safety systems,
the sensors adjust automatically while a cer‐
tain distance is being driven after the vehicle
has been delivered or after repairs. Full sys‐
192 Driving and parking


tem effectiveness is not reached until the
end of this teach-in process.
R Brakepads, brake discs and tires that are
either new or have been replaced only ach‐
ieve optimum braking effect and grip after
several hundred kilometers of driving. Com‐
pensate for the reduced braking effect by
applying greater force to the brake pedal.
Notes on optimized acceleration
If all necessary requirements and activation con‐
ditions are fulfilled, the best possible accelera‐
tion can be achieved from a standstill.
Do not use the optimized acceleration on public
roads. Individual wheels could spin and you
could lose control of the vehicle. There is an
increased risk of skidding and/or accident.
Be sure to observe the safety notes and informa‐
tion on ESP® (/ page 221).
Pulling away with optimized acceleration
&
WARNING Risk of skidding and having
an accident from wheels spinning
When you use optimized acceleration, indi‐
vidual wheels could spin and you could lose
control of the vehicle.
If ESP® is deactivated, there is a risk of skid‐
ding and accident.
# Make sure that no persons or obstacles
are in the close vicinity of your vehicle.
Requirements:
R The vehicle has been broken in
(/ page 192).
R The vehicle and tires are in good condition.
R You are on a high-grip roadway.
R The engine and transmission are at normal
operating temperature.
*
NOTE Increased wear due to optimized
acceleration
When pulling away with optimized accelera‐
tion, all components of the drivetrain are
subjected to a very high load.
This can lead to increased component wear.
# Do not always pull away with optimized
acceleration.
# Engage the h drive position (/ page 205).
# Move the steering wheel to the straight-
ahead position.
# Select the sportiest available drive program
B or C(/ page 202).
# Deactivate ESP® (/ page 222).
# Depress and hold the brake pedal firmly with
your left foot.
# With your right foot, fully depress the accel‐
erator pedal.

tion.
# Switch on ESP® once the acceleration proce‐
dure is complete.
Ending optimized acceleration
# Remove your foot from the accelerator pedal.
# Reactivate the ESP®.
% After you pull away with optimized accelera‐
tion, components of the drivetrain can
become very hot, which means that opti‐
mized acceleration values may be reached
again only after a few minutes.

WARNING Risk of accident due to incor‐
rect footwear
Incorrect footwear includes, for example:
R Shoes with platform soles
R Shoes with high heels
R Slippers
There is a risk of an accident.
# Always wear suitable footwear so that
you can operate the pedals safely.
&
WARNING Risk of accident if the ignition
is switched off while driving
If you switch off the ignition while driving,
safety functions are restricted or no longer
available.
This may affect the power steering system
and the brake force boosting, for example.
You will need to use considerably more force
to steer and brake, for example.
# Do not switch off the ignition while driv‐
ing.
&
DANGER Risk of death caused by
exhaust gases
Combustion engines emit poisonous exhaust
gases such as carbon monoxide. Inhaling
these exhaust gases is hazardous to health
and leads to poisoning.
# Never leave the engine or, if present,
the auxiliary heating running in an
enclosed space without sufficient venti‐
lation.
194 Driving and parking


&
WARNING Risk of skidding and of an
accident due to shifting down on slippery
road surfaces
If you shift down on slippery road surfaces to
increase the engine braking effect, the drive
wheels may lose traction.
# Do not shift down on slippery road sur‐
faces to increase the engine braking
effect.
&
DANGER Risk of fatal injury due to poi‐
sonous exhaust gases
If the tailpipe is blocked or sufficient ventila‐
tion is not possible, poisonous exhaust gases
such as carbon monoxide may enter the vehi‐
cle. This is the case when the vehicle
becomes stuck in snow, for example.
# Keep the tailpipe and the area around
the vehicle free from snow when the
engine or the stationary heater are run‐
ning.
# Open a window on the side of the vehi‐
cle facing away from the wind to ensure
an adequate supply of fresh air.
&
WARNING Risk of accident and injury
due to being under the influence of alco‐
hol and drugs while driving
Drinking and driving and/or taking drugs and
driving are very dangerous combinations.
Even a small amount of alcohol or drugs can
affect your reflexes, perceptions and judg‐
ment.
The possibility of a serious or even fatal acci‐
dent are greatly increased when you drink or
take drugs and drive.
# Do not drink or take drugs and drive or
allow anyone to drive who has been
drinking or taking drugs.
&
WARNING Risk of accident due to the
brake system overheating
If you leave your foot on the brake pedal
when driving, the brake system may over‐
heat.
This increases the braking distance and the
brake system may even cause the brake sys‐
tem failure.
# Never use the brake pedal as a footrest.
# Do not depress the brake pedal and the
accelerator pedal at the same time
while driving.
*
NOTE Engine damage due to excessively
high engine speeds
The engine will be damaged if you drive with
the engine in the overrevving range.
# Do not drive with the engine in the over‐
revving range.
Driving and parking 195


*
NOTE Wearing out the brake linings by
continuously depressing the brake pedal
# Do not depress the brake pedal contin‐
uously whilst driving.
# To use the braking effect of the engine,
shift to a lower gear in good time.
*
NOTE Damage to the drivetrain and
engine when pulling away
# Do not warm up the engine while the
vehicle is stationary. Pull away immedi‐
ately.
# Avoid high engine speeds and driving at
full throttle until the engine has reached
its operating temperature.
*
NOTE Damage to the catalytic converter
due to non-combusted fuel
The engine is not running smoothly and is
misfiring.
Non-combusted fuel may get into the cata‐
lytic converter.
# Only depress the accelerator pedal
slightly.
# Have the cause rectified immediately at
a qualified specialist workshop.
*
NOTE Reduced battery life due to fre‐
quent short-distance trips
The 12 V battery may not be sufficiently
charged when the vehicle is used only for
short-distance trips. This reduces the life of
the battery.
# Drive longer distances regularly to
charge the battery.
Notes on driving with a roof load, trailer or
fully laden vehicle
When driving with a loaded roof luggage rack or
trailer as well as with a fully laden or fully occu‐
pied vehicle, the vehicle's driving and steering
characteristics change.
You should bear the following in mind:
R Do not exceed the permissible roof load and
towing capacity. Also observe the technical
data in the printed Operator's Manual.
R Evenly distribute the roof load, and place
heavy objects at the bottom. Also comply
with the notes on loading the vehicle
(/ page 134).
R Drive attentively, and avoid suddenly pulling
away, braking and steering as well as rapid
cornering.
Notes on driving on salt-treated roads
The braking effect is limited on salt-treated
roads.
Therefore, observe the following notes:
R due to salt build-up on the brake discs and
brakepads, the braking distance can increase
considerably or result in braking only on one
side
R maintain a much greater safe distance to the
vehicle in front
196 Driving and parking


To remove salt build-up:
R brake occasionally while paying attention to
the traffic conditions
R carefully depress the brake pedal at the end
of the journey and when starting the next
journey
Notes on hydroplaning
Hydroplaning can take place once a certain
amount of water has accumulated on the road
surface.
Observe the following notes during heavy precip‐
itation or in conditions in which hydroplaning
may occur:
R Reduce speed
R Avoid tire ruts
R Avoid sudden steering movements
R Brake carefully
% Also observe the notes on regularly checking
wheels and tires (/ page 373).
Notes on driving through water on the road
surface
Water which has entered into the vehicle can
damage the engine, electrics and transmission.
Water can also enter the air intake of the engine
and cause engine damage.
Observe the following if you must drive through
water:
R The water, when calm, may only reach the
lower edge of the vehicle body.
R Drive at a maximum speed of 6 mph
(10 km/h); water can otherwise enter the
vehicle interior or engine compartment.
R Vehicles traveling in front, or oncoming vehi‐
cles, can create waves which may exceed the
maximum permissible depth of the water.
The braking effect of the brakes is reduced after
fording. Brake carefully while paying attention to
the traffic conditions until braking power has
been fully restored.
Function of rear axle steering
The rear axle steering is an electromechanical
auxiliary steering on the rear axle which adjusts
the steering of the rear wheels according to the
position of the front wheels, depending on the
speed. This results in greater maneuverability
and improved driving stability, e.g. when corner‐
ing.
Rear axle steering has the following characteris‐
tics:
R Reduced steering effort and turning radius
resulting in reduced parking effort
R Improved driving stability, e.g. when corner‐
ing
R More direct steering resulting in improved
handling of the vehicle
Observe the notes on snow chains and snow
chain mode (/ page 374).

Function of the 4MATIC
4MATIC ensures that all four wheels are driven.
Together with ESP® and 4ETS, 4MATIC improves
the traction of your vehicle whenever a driven
wheel spins due to insufficient traction.
If you fail to adapt your driving style, 4MATIC can
neither reduce the risk of an accident nor over‐
ride the laws of physics. 4MATIC cannot take
account of road, weather and traffic conditions.
4MATIC is only an aid. You are responsible espe‐
cially for maintaining a safe distance from the
vehicle in front, for vehicle speed, for braking in
good time and for staying in lane.
% In wintry road conditions, the maximum
effect of 4MATIC can be achieved only if you
use winter tires (M+S tires), with snow
chains if necessary.

Driving and driving safety systems
Driving systems and your responsibility
Your vehicle is equipped with driving systems
which assist you in driving, parking and maneu‐
vering the vehicle. The driving systems are only
aids. They are not a substitute for your attention
to the surroundings and do not relieve you of
your responsibility pertaining to road traffic law.
The driver is always responsible for maintaining
a safe distance to the vehicle in front, for vehicle
speed, for braking in good time and for staying
in lane. Pay attention to the traffic conditions at
all times and intervene when necessary. Be
aware of the limitations regarding the safe use of
these systems.
Driving systems can neither reduce the risk of
accident if you fail to adapt your driving style nor
override the laws of physics. They cannot always
take into account road, weather or traffic condi‐
tions.
Information on vehicle sensors and cameras
Some driving and driving safety systems use
cameras as well as radar, lidar or ultrasonic sen‐
sors to monitor the area in front of, behind or
next to the vehicle.
1 Multifunction camera
2 Cameras in the outside mirrors
3 Front radar

WARNING Risk of accident due to
restricted detection performance of vehi‐
cle sensors and cameras
If the area around vehicle sensors or cam‐
eras is covered, damaged or dirty, certain
driving and safety systems cannot function
correctly. There is a risk of an accident.
# Keep the area around vehicle sensors
or cameras clear of any obstructions
and clean.
# Have damage to the bumper, radiator
grille or stone chipping in the area of
the front and rear windows repaired at
a qualified specialist workshop.
Particularly, keep the areas around the sensors
and cameras free of dirt, ice or slush
(/ page 346). The sensors and cameras must
not be covered and the detection ranges around
them must be kept free. Do not attach additional
license plate bracket, advertisements, stickers,
foils or foils to protect against stone chippings in
the detection range of the sensors and cameras.
Make sure that there are no overhanging loads
protruding into the detection range.
If there is damage to a bumper or the radiator
grille, or after an impact, have the function of
the sensors checked at a qualified specialist
workshop. Have damage or stone chipping in the
area of the cameras on the front and rear win‐
dows repaired at a qualified specialist workshop.
% The rear view camera may move in and out
automatically for the purpose of calibration,
even though there is no camera image in the
display.

Functions of ABS (Anti-lock Braking System)
ABS regulates the brake pressure in critical driv‐
ing situations:
R During braking, e.g. at maximum full-stop
braking or insufficient tire traction, the
wheels are prevented from locking.
R Vehicle steerability while braking is ensured.
If ABS intervenes when braking, you will feel a
pulsing in the brake pedal. The pulsating brake
pedal can be an indication of hazardous road
conditions and can serve as a reminder to take
extra care while driving.
System limits
R ABS is active from speeds of approx. 3 mph
(5 km/h).
R ABS may be impaired or may not function if a
malfunction has occurred and the yel‐
low ! ABS warning lamp lights up contin‐
uously in the instrument cluster after the
engine is started.
Function of BAS
&
WARNING Risk of an accident caused by
a malfunction in BAS (Brake Assist Sys‐
tem)
If BAS is malfunctioning, the braking distance
in an emergency braking situation is
increased.
# Depress the brake pedal with full force
in emergency braking situations. ABS
prevents the wheels from locking.
The Brake Assist System (BAS) supports your
emergency braking situation with additional
brake force.
If you depress the brake pedal quickly, BAS is
activated:
R BAS automatically boosts the brake pres‐
sure.
R BAS can shorten the braking distance.
R ABS prevents the wheels from locking.
The brakes will function as usual once you
release the brake pedal. BAS is deactivated.

Function of ESP® (Electronic Stability Pro‐
gram)
&
WARNING Risk of skidding if ESP® is
deactivated
If you deactivate ESP®, ESP® cannot carry
out vehicle stabilization.
# ESP® should only be deactivated in the
following situations.
ESP® can monitor and improve driving stability
and traction in the following situations, within
physical limits:
R When pulling away on a wet or slippery road.
R When braking.
If the vehicle deviates from the direction desired
by the driver, ESP® can stabilize the vehicle by
intervening in the following ways:
R One or more wheels are braked.
R The engine output is adapted according to
the situation.
When ESP® is deactivated, the å warning
lamp lights up continuously:
R Driving stability will no longer be improved.
R The drive wheels could spin.
R ETS/4ETS traction control is still active.
% When ESP® is deactivated, you are still assis‐
ted by ESP® when braking.
When the ÷ warning lamp flashes, one or
several wheels has reached its grip limit:
R Adapt your driving style to suit the current
road and weather conditions.
R Do not deactivate ESP®.
R Only depress the accelerator pedal as far as
is necessary when pulling away.
Deactivate ESP® in the following situations to
improve traction:
R When using snow chains.
R In deep snow.
R On sand or gravel.
% Spinning the wheels results in a cutting
action, which enhances traction.
If the ÷ ESP® warning lamp lights up continu‐
ously, ESP® is not available due to a malfunction.
Observe the following information:
R Warning and indicator lamps (/ page 561)
R Display messages (/ page 503)
ETS/4ETS (Electronic Traction System)
ETS/4ETS traction control is part of ESP® and
makes it possible to pull away and accelerate on
a slippery road.
ETS/4ETS can improve the vehicle's traction by
intervening in the following ways:
R The drive wheels are braked individually if
they spin.
R More drive torque is transferred to the wheel
or wheels with traction.
Influence of drive programs on ESP®
The drive programs enable ESP® to adapt to dif‐
ferent weather and road conditions as well as
the driver's preferred driving style. Depending on
the selected drive program, the appropriate
Driving and parking 221


ESP® mode will be activated. You can select the
drive programs using the DYNAMIC SELECT
switch (/ page 202).
Function of ESP® Crosswind Assist
ESP® Crosswind Assist detects sudden gusts of
side wind and helps the driver to keep the vehi‐
cle in the lane:
R ESP® Crosswind Assist is active at vehicle
speeds between approx. 47 mph (75 km/h)
and 125 mph (200 km/h) when driving
straight ahead or cornering slightly.
R The vehicle is stabilized by means of individ‐
ual brake application on one side.

ATTENTION ASSIST
Function of ATTENTION ASSIST with micro‐
sleep detection
% The microsleep detection subfunction is only
available in combination with the driver cam‐
era.
ATTENTION ASSIST assists you on long, monoto‐
nous journeys, e.g. on highways and trunk roads.
If indicators of fatigue or increasing lapses in
concentration on the part of the driver are
detected, the system suggests taking a break.
ATTENTION ASSIST is only an aid. It cannot
always detect fatigue or lapses in concentration
in time. The system is not a substitute for a well-
rested and attentive driver. On long journeys,
take regular breaks in good time that allow for
adequate recuperation.
You can choose between two settings:
R Standard: normal system sensitivity.
R Sensitive: increased system sensitivity: the
driver is warned earlier and the attention
level detected by the system is adapted
accordingly.
If drowsiness or increasing lapses in concentra‐
tion are detected, the ATTENTION ASSIST: Take
a Break! warning appears on the driver display.
You can acknowledge the message and take a
break where necessary. If you do not take a
break and ATTENTION ASSIST continues to
detect increasing lapses in concentration, you
224 Driving and parking


will be warned again after a minimum of
15 minutes.
The following information is displayed on the
driver display:
R The length of the journey since the last break
R The attention level determined by ATTENTION
ASSIST:
-
More segments 2 of the circle dis‐
played, the higher the detected attention
level.
-
Fewer segments 2 are displayed in the
circle as the attention level decreases.
R Microsleep detection 1 status:
-
Deactivated: display 1 is hidden.
-
Activated but not operational: display 1
is gray.
-
Activated and operational: display 1 is
green.
If ATTENTION ASSIST is unable to calculate the
attention level and cannot issue a warning, the
System Suspended message appears.
If the system, which uses the driver camera,
detects indicators of microsleep, the ATTEN-
TION ASSIST Nodding Off Take a Break! warning
message appears on the driver display and a
warning tone sounds simultaneously. This warn‐
ing message must be confirmed by Touch Con‐
trol. It is recommended that you take a break
immediately.
If a warning is given on the driver display, the
multimedia system offers to search for a rest
area. You can select a rest area and start naviga‐
tion to this rest area.
ATTENTION ASSIST with microsleep detection is
activated automatically when the engine is
restarted. The last selected sensitivity level
remains stored.
System limits
ATTENTION ASSIST is active in the 37 mph
(60 km/h) to 124 mph (200 km/h) speed range.
The microsleep detection function is available at
a speed of 12.5 mph (20 km/h) and above.
Particularly in the following situations, ATTEN‐
TION ASSIST only functions in a restricted man‐
ner and warnings may be delayed or not occur:
R If you have been driving for less than approx‐
imately 30 minutes.
R If the road condition is poor (uneven road
surface or potholes).
R If there is a strong side wind.
R If you adopt a sporty driving style (high cor‐
nering speeds or high rates of acceleration).
R If the Steering Assist function of Active Dis‐
tance Assist DISTRONIC is active.
R If the clock is set to the incorrect time.
R If you change lanes and vary your speed fre‐
quently In active driving situations.

Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC
Function of Active Distance Assist
DISTRONIC
Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC maintains the
set speed on free-flowing roads. If vehicles in
front are detected, the set distance is main‐
tained, if necessary, until the vehicle comes to a
halt. The vehicle accelerates or brakes depend‐
ing on the distance to the vehicle in front and
the set speed. The speed and distance to the
vehicle in front are set and saved using the
steering wheel.
Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC is available in
the 15 mph (20 km/h) to 130 mph (210 km/h)
speed range.
Other features of Active Distance Assist
DISTRONIC:
R Adjusts the driving style depending on the
selected drive program (fuel-saving, comfort‐
able or dynamic) (/ page 201)
R Initiates acceleration to the stored speed if
the turn signal indicator is switched on to
change to the overtaking lane
R Reacts to stationary vehicles detected in
urban speed ranges (except bicycles and
motorcycles)
R Takes one-sided overtaking restrictions into
account on highways or on multi-lane roads
with separate roadways (country-dependent)
Additional function available in certain coun‐
tries: if Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC has
braked the vehicle to a standstill, it can automat‐
ically follow the vehicle in front when driving off
again within 30 seconds. If a critical situation is
detected in the surrounding area when driving
off, such as a person in the vehicle path, a visual
and acoustic warning is given indicating that the
driver must now take control of the vehicle. The
vehicle is not accelerated any further.
Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC is ready to
pull away when the green ç vehicle symbol
flashes cyclically.
Observe the notes on driving systems and your
responsibility; you may otherwise fail to recog‐
nize dangers (/ page 218).

Function of Active Speed Limit Assist
If a change in the speed limit of 12 mph
(20 km/h) or more is detected and automatic
adoption of speed limits is activated, the new
speed limit is automatically adopted as the
stored speed (/ page 232).
The driven speed is adjusted when the vehicle is
level with the traffic sign at the latest. In the
case of signs indicating entry into an urban area,
the speed is adapted according to the speed
permitted within the urban area. The speed limit
display in the driver display is always updated
when the vehicle is level with the traffic sign.
If you are driving on German highways and there
is no speed limit, the system uses the speed
stored for a stretch of road with no speed limit
as the set speed. If you do not alter the stored
speed on a stretch of road with no speed limit,
the recommended speed of 80 mph (130 km/h)
is adopted.
If Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC has been
put into passive mode by pressing the accelera‐
tor pedal, only speed limits which are higher
than the set speed are adopted.
The maximum permissible speed does not take
the road condition and current weather and traf‐
fic conditions into account. Adjust your speed
accordingly, when necessary.
230 Driving and parking


Observe the notes on driving systems and your
responsibility; you may otherwise fail to recog‐
nize dangers (/ page 218).
System limits
The system limits of Traffic Sign Assist apply to
the detection of traffic signs (/ page 244).
Speed limits below 12 mph (20 km/h) are not
automatically adopted by the system as the
stored speed. Temporary speed restrictions (e.g.
for a certain time or due to weather conditions)
cannot be properly detected by the system. The
maximum permissible speed applying to a vehi‐
cle with a trailer is not detected by the system.
Adjust the speed in these situations.
&
WARNING Risk of accident due to Active
Speed Limit Assist adapting the vehicle's
speed
The speed adopted by Active Speed Limit
Assist may be too high or incorrect in some
individual cases, such as:
R at speed limits below 12 mph (20 km/h)
R in wet conditions or in fog
R when towing a trailer
# Ensure that the driven speed complies
with traffic regulations.
# Adjust the driving speed to suit current
traffic and weather conditions.
Function of route-based speed adaptation
When Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC is acti‐
vated, the vehicle speed will be adapted accord‐
ingly to the route events ahead. Depending on
the drive program selected, the vehicle negoti‐
ates a route event ahead in a fuel-saving, com‐
fortable or dynamic manner. When the route
event has been passed, the vehicle accelerates
again to the stored speed. The set distance to
the vehicle in front, vehicles detected ahead and
speed restrictions ahead are taken into account.
Route-based speed adaptation can be activated
in the multimedia system (/ page 232).
The following route events are taken into
account:
R Curves
R Roundabouts
R T-intersections
R Turns and exits
R Traffic jams ahead (only with Live Traffic )
Also, the speed is reduced if the turn signal indi‐
cator is switched on and one of the following sit‐
uations is detected:
R Turning off at intersections
R Driving on slowing-down lanes
R Driving on lanes adjacent to slowing-down
lanes
The driver is responsible for choosing the right
speed and observing other road users. This
applies in particular to intersections, round‐
abouts and traffic lights, as route-based speed
adaptation does not brake the vehicle to a stand‐
still.
If a corresponding route event is detected while
route guidance is active, the first speed adjust‐
ment is carried out automatically. If the turn sig‐
nal indicator is switched on, the selected route is
Driving and parking 231


confirmed and further speed adjustment is acti‐
vated.
Speed adaptation is canceled in the following
cases:
R If the turn signal indicator is switched off
before the route event and it is therefore
assumed that the route event is not relevant
to the driver.
R If the driver depresses the accelerator or
brake pedal during the process.
System limits
Route-based speed adaptation does not take
right of way regulations into account. The driver
is responsible for complying with road traffic
regulations and driving at a suitable speed.
In difficult conditions, the speed selection made
by the system may not always be suitable. This
applies to the following situations, for example:
R Unclear roads
R Road narrowing
R Varying maximum permissible speeds in indi‐
vidual lanes, for example at toll plazas
R Wet road surfaces, snow or ice
In these situations the driver must intervene
accordingly.
&
WARNING Risk of accident in spite of
route-based speed adaptation
Route-based speed adaptation can malfunc‐
tion or be temporarily unavailable in the fol‐
lowing situations:
R If the driver does not follow the calcula‐
ted route
R If map data is not up-to-date or available
R In the event of roadworks
R In bad weather or road conditions
R If the accelerator pedal is depressed
R In the event of electronically displayed
speed limitations

Function of Active Stop-and-Go Assist
Active Stop-and-Go Assist helps you when in
traffic jams on multi-lane roads with separate
roadways by automatically pulling away within up
to 60 seconds and with moderate steering
maneuvers. It orients itself using the vehicle in
front and lane markings. Active Stop-and-Go
Assist automatically maintains a safe distance
from the vehicle in front and vehicles cutting in.
Active Stop-and-Go Assist requires you, as the
driver, to keep your hands on the steering wheel
at all times so that you are able to intervene at
any time to correct the course of the vehicle and
keep it in lane.
Observe the notes on driving systems and your
responsibility; you may otherwise fail to recog‐
nize dangers (/ page 218).
Active Stop-and-Go Assist activates automati‐
cally when all of the following conditions are
met:
R You are in a traffic jam on a freeway or high-
speed major road.
R Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC is activa‐
ted and active (/ page 228).
R Active Steering Assist is activated and active
(/ page 235).
R You are traveling no faster than 35 mph
(60 km/h).
When Active Stop-and-Go Assist is active the
¬ status display appears in the driver display.
System limits

Active Steering Assist
Function of Active Steering Assist
Active Steering Assist is only available up to a
speed of 130 mph (210 km/h). The system helps
you to stay in the center of the lane by means of
moderate steering interventions. Depending on
the speed driven, Active Steering Assist uses the
vehicles ahead and lane markings as a refer‐
ence.
% Depending on the country, in the lower
speed range Active Steering Assist can use
the surrounding traffic as a reference. If nec‐
essary, Active Steering Assist can then also
provide assistance when driving away from
the center of the lane.
If the detection of lane markings and vehicles
ahead is impaired, Active Steering Assist
switches to passive mode. The system provides
no support in this case.

Contact detection
The driver is required to keep their hands on the
steering wheel at all times and be able to inter‐
vene at any time to correct the course of the
vehicle and keep it in lane. The driver must
expect a change from active to passive mode or
vice versa at any time.
If the system detects that the driver has not
steered the vehicle for a considerable period of
time or has removed their hands from the steer‐
ing wheel, an optical warning is given first. Dis‐
play message 1 appears on the driver display.
If the driver still does not steer the vehicle, or
gives no confirmation to the system, a warning
tone sounds in addition to the visual warning
message.
If the driver does not react to this warning for a
considerable period, an emergency stop is initi‐
ated (/ page 235).
The warning is not issued or is stopped as soon
as the system detects that the driver has
touched the steering wheel.
Touch detection may be limited or inoperative in
the following situations:
R The driver is wearing gloves.
R There is a steering wheel cover on the steer‐
ing wheel.
If Active Steering Assist detects that a system
limit has been reached, a visual warning is
issued and a warning tone sounds.
Observe the notes on driving systems and your
responsibility; you may otherwise fail to recog‐
nize dangers (/ page 218).
System limits
Active Steering Assist has a limited steering tor‐
que for lateral guidance. In some cases, the
steering intervention is not sufficient to keep the
vehicle in the lane.
The system may be impaired or may not function
in the following instances:
R There is poor visibility, e.g. due to snow, rain,
fog, heavy spray, greatly varying ambient
light or strong shadows on the road.
R There is glare, e.g. from oncoming traffic,
direct sunlight or reflections.
R Insufficient road illumination.
R The windshield is dirty, fogged up, damaged
or covered in the vicinity of the camera, e.g.

Function of Active Brake Assist
Active Brake Assist consists of the following
functions:
R Distance warning function
Driving and parking 239


R Autonomous braking function
R Situation-dependent braking assistance
R Evasive Steering Assist (country-specific)
Active Brake Assist can help you to minimize the
risk of a collision with vehicles, cyclists or
pedestrians or to reduce the effects of such a
collision.
If Active Brake Assist has detected a risk of colli‐
sion, a warning tone sounds and the L dis‐
tance warning lamp lights up.
In the Assistance menu, an insufficient distance
1 to the vehicle in front is displayed in red. If
you further reduce the distance, the vehicle in
front is also highlighted in red. When the system
detects a risk of collision, red radar waves 2
appear in front of the vehicle.
Vehicles with PRE-SAFE®: depending on the
country, an additional haptic warning occurs in
the form of slight, repeated tensioning of the
seat belt.
% Vehicles with active ambient lighting: if
Warning Support is activated, the Active
Brake Assist warning is also accompanied by
ambient lighting (/ page 166).
If you do not react to the warning, autonomous
braking can be initiated in critical situations.
In particularly critical situations, Active Brake
Assist can also initiate autonomous braking
directly. In this case, the warning lamp and warn‐
ing tone occur simultaneously with the braking
application.
If you apply the brake yourself in a critical situa‐
tion or apply the brake during autonomous brak‐
ing, situation-dependent braking assistance
occurs. The brake pressure increases up to max‐
imum full-stop braking if necessary.
If autonomous braking or situation-dependent
braking assistance has occurred, pop up 1
appears in the driver display and then automati‐
cally goes out after a short time.
If the autonomous braking function or the situa‐

WARNING Risk of an accident caused by
limited detection performance of Active
Brake Assist
Active Brake Assist cannot always clearly
identify objects and complex traffic situa‐
tions.
In such cases, Active Brake Assist might:
R Give a warning or brake without reason
R Not give a warning or not brake
Active Brake Assist is only an aid. The driver
is responsible for maintaining a sufficiently
safe distance to the vehicle in front, vehicle
speed and for braking in good time.
# Always pay careful attention to the traf‐
fic situation; do not rely on Active Brake
Assist alone.
# Be prepared to brake or swerve if nec‐
essary.
% If Active Brake Assist is deactivated, æ
appears in the driver display.
If the system is unavailable or the functions
are restricted, Ä appears.
Also observe the system limits of Active Brake
Assist.
The individual subfunctions are available in
the following speed ranges:
The distance warning function issues a warning
in the following situations:
R From approximately 4 mph (7 km/h), if your
vehicle is critically close to a vehicle, cyclist
or pedestrian, you will hear an intermittent
warning tone and the L distance warning
lamp lights up in the driver display.
Vehicles with PRE-SAFE®: depending on
the country, an additional haptic warning
occurs in the form of slight, repeated ten‐
sioning of the seat belt.
If possible, brake immediately or maneuver to
avoid the obstacle.
Distance warning function
The distance warning function can assist you by
means of an intermittent warning tone and a
warning lamp:
R At speeds up to approximately 155 mph
(250 km/h) when approaching vehicles
ahead.
R At speeds up to approximately 75 mph
(120 km/h) when approaching crossing vehi‐
cles, pedestrians and cyclists.
R At speeds up to approximately 62 mph
(100 km/h) when approaching stationary
vehicles.
R At speeds up to approximately 50 mph
(80 km/h) when approaching cyclists ahead.
R At speeds up to approximately 43 mph
(70 km/h) when approaching stationary
pedestrians and cyclists.
Driving and parking 241


Autonomous braking function
The autonomous braking function can intervene
from speeds of approximately 4 mph (7 km/h):
R At speeds up to approximately 155 mph
(250 km/h) when approaching vehicles
ahead.
R At speeds up to approximately 75 mph
(120 km/h) when approaching crossing vehi‐
cles, pedestrians and cyclists.
R At speeds up to approximately 62 mph

Canceling a brake application of Active Brake
Assist
You can cancel a brake application of Active
Brake Assist at any time by:
R Fully depressing the accelerator pedal or
with kickdown.
R Releasing the brake pedal.
Active Brake Assist may cancel the brake appli‐
cation when one of the following conditions is
fulfilled:
R You maneuver to avoid the obstacle
R There is no longer a risk of collision
R An obstacle is no longer detected in front of
your vehicle
Reaction to oncoming road users
Active Brake Assist can also react to detected
oncoming road users:
R Reaction up to speeds of approximately
62 mph (100 km/h)
R Warning for oncoming road users through
acoustic warning and warning lamp
242 Driving and parking


R Autonomous braking application in order to
reduce the severity of an accident
Evasive Steering Assist
&
WARNING Risk of accident despite Eva‐
sive Steering Assist
Evasive Steering Assist cannot always recog‐
nize objects or complex traffic situations
clearly.
Moreover, the steering support provided by
Evasive Steering Assist is not sufficient to
avoid a collision.
# Always pay careful attention to the traf‐
fic situation; do not rely on Evasive
Steering Assist alone.
# Be prepared to brake or swerve if nec‐
essary.
# End the support by actively steering in
non-critical situations.
# Drive at an appropriate speed if there
are pedestrians close to the path of
your vehicle.
Evasive Steering Assist has the following charac‐
teristics:
R Detection of pedestrians, cyclists and vehi‐
cles.
R Assistance through power-assisted steering if
it detects a swerving maneuver.
R Activation by an abrupt steering movement
during a swerving maneuver.
R Assistance during swerving and straightening
of the vehicle.
R Reaction from a speed of approximately
13 mph (20 km/h) up to a speed of approx‐
imately 68 mph (110 km/h).
The steering support of Evasive Steering Assist
can be canceled at any time by counter steering.
System limits
Full system performance is not available for a
few seconds after switching on the ignition or
after driving off.
If the system is unavailable or the functions are
restricted, the Ä warning lamp appears in the
driver's display.
The system may be impaired or may not func‐
tion, particularly in the following situations:
R In snow, rain, fog, heavy spray, if there is
glare, in direct sunlight or in greatly varying
ambient light.
R If the sensors are dirty, fogged up, damaged
or covered (/ page 218).
R If the sensors are impaired due to interfer‐
ence from other radar sources, e.g. strong
radar reflections in parking garages.
R If a loss of tire pressure or a faulty tire has
been detected and displayed.
R In complex traffic situations where objects
cannot always be clearly identified.
R If pedestrians, cyclists or vehicles move
quickly into the sensor detection range.
R If road users are hidden by other objects or
are located close to other objects.
R If the typical outline of a pedestrian or cyclist
cannot be distinguished from the back‐
ground.

Traffic Sign Assist
Function of Traffic Sign Assist
Traffic Sign Assist detects traffic signs with the
multifunction camera and compares this with
information in the digital navigation map. It
assists you by displaying detected speed limits
and overtaking restrictions on the driver display
and on the Head-up Display. The system can
issue a warning when you exceed the maximum
permissible speed.
In some countries, the system can provide you
with further functions and can warn you when
you are approaching pedestrian crossings or
when you are about to drive past stop signs or
red lights unintentionally.
The camera also detects and analyzes traffic
signs with a restriction indicated by an additional
sign (e.g. when wet).
Traffic Sign Assist only visualizes selected signs
on the driver display. Actual traffic signs and
speed limits have priority over traffic signs and
speed limits shown on the driver display.
Also observe the following information:
R Select a speed adapted to the traffic, sur‐
roundings and weather conditions
R Observe actual traffic signs
R Observe applicable traffic rules and regula‐
tions
Observe the notes on driving systems and your
responsibility; you may otherwise fail to recog‐
nize dangers (/ page 218).
244 Driving and parking


Messages on the driver display
1 Permissible speed
2 Permissible speed when there is a restriction
3 Additional sign with restriction
The system can show up to two traffic signs on
the driver display simultaneously. The system
always prioritizes displaying speed limits. Up to
one traffic sign with a maximum permissible
speed can be shown on the Head-up Display. If
two speed signs are shown on the driver display,
for example, when speed limits are detected, the
value of left-hand speed limit 1 is transmitted
to the limiter or Active Distance Assist
DISTRONIC for adoption and is shown on the
Head-up Display.
Examples of traffic signs which can be displayed
Traffic Sign Assist can detect and display follow‐
ing traffic signs 1:
R Speed limits
R End of the speed limit
R Overtaking restrictions
R Play streets
R Signs showing the start or end of highways
R Signs showing the start or end of express‐
ways
R Recommended speeds
Traffic Sign Assist can detect following addi‐
tional signs 3 and, if necessary, analyze the
relevance of the restrictions using other vehicle
sensors:
R When wet
R Slippery road surfaces
R In fog
R Temporary restrictions
R Exits
R Restrictions for vehicle/trailer combinations
Traffic Sign Assist also uses data from the digital
street map in the navigation system. When you
leave or enter a municipality or change roads, on
a freeway exit or access road for example, or
after you turn at an intersection, the display on
the driver display can thus be updated without a
traffic sign having been detected.
In addition, the system can display speed limits
ahead on the driver display and the Head-up Dis‐
play. The driver display can also show the dis‐
tance to an upcoming lower limit speed. For this
Driving and parking 245


purpose, information from the digital road map
of the navigation system is used. Depending on
the current situation and the assumed route, the
display message is shown up to 380 yds (350 m)
in advance. The Assistance menu can also dis‐
play a dynamic visualization of the speed limits
ahead.
If Traffic Sign Assist cannot determine the cur‐
rently applicable maximum permissible speed
(e.g. due to missing signs), the following display
appears on the driver display:
Traffic Sign Assist is not available in all coun‐
tries. If the vehicle is in a country where Traffic
Sign Assist is not supported, this is displayed
continuously.
% Also observe the information on display mes‐
sages in Traffic Sign Assist (/ page 503).
Warning when the maximum permissible
speed is exceeded
The system can warn you if you unintentionally
exceed the maximum permissible speed. To do
this, you can specify in the multimedia system
by how much the maximum permissible speed
can be exceeded before a warning is issued. You
can set the warning to visual only (the traffic
sign flashes three times on the driver display) or
visual and acoustic, including a warning tone.
Additional functions of Traffic Sign Assist
(country-specific)
Warning for no-entry signs: Traffic Sign Assist
can warn you if you drive the wrong way down a
section of road, for example on freeway access
roads or one-way streets.
Warning at pedestrian crossings: If you
approach pedestrian crossings, provided that
pedestrians are in the danger zone or are moving
towards it, Traffic Sign Assist can warn you up to
a speed of approximately 44 mph (70 km/h).
Warning at stop signs: Traffic Sign Assist can
warn you up to a speed of approximately 44 mph
(70 km/h) if you are about to drive past a stop
sign unintentionally. For this to be possible, the
signs must be clear, for example if the system
detects more than one stop sign, or a stop sign
can be confirmed using the digital navigation
map. No warning can be issued if several differ‐
ent signs are detected.
Warning at red lights: Traffic Sign Assist can
warn you up to a speed of approximately 44 mph
(70 km/h) if you are about to drive through a red
light unintentionally.
The following conditions must be fulfilled:
R Several traffic lights have been detected.
R All traffic lights detected are red.
R At least one of the red traffic lights detected
is on the front passenger side beside the
vehicle's own lane.
R The traffic lights are in the following
sequence (from top to bottom): red, yellow,
green.
246 Driving and parking


% If the function is available, you can activate
or deactivate the warnings at pedestrian
crossings, stop signs and red lights in the
Traffic Sign Assist menu under Further Warn-
ings (/ page 247).
System limits
The system may be impaired or may not function
particularly in the following situations:
R If visibility is poor, e.g. due to insufficient illu‐
mination of the road, highly variable shade
conditions, rain, snow, fog, swirling dust or
heavy spray.
R If there is glare, e.g. from oncoming traffic,
direct sunlight or reflections.
R If the windshield in the area of the multifunc‐
tion camera is dirty, or if the camera is fog‐
ged up, damaged or covered.
R If traffic signs are difficult to detect, e.g.
because they are dirty, covered, faded, cov‐
ered with ice, damaged, badly positioned,
poorly lit or twisted.
R Active traffic signs with LED displays may not
be detected correctly or at all due to techni‐
cal factors, such as transmission frequency.
R If the information on the navigation system's
digital map is incorrect, incomplete or out of
date.
R If signs or the road layout is ambiguous, e.g.
traffic signs in roadworks, at exits and
ramps, in neighboring lanes or parallel roads.
R If signs do not conform to the standard.
R If signs or road layouts are specific to the
country and deviate from the route guidance
in the navigation system, e.g. at or beyond
construction sites.
R After sharp turns and tight curves, when traf‐
fic signs are outside the camera's field of
vision.

Active Lane Keeping Assist
Function of Active Lane Keeping Assist
Active Lane Keeping Assist monitors the area in
front of your vehicle by means of the multifunc‐
tion camera (/ page 218) and can warn you
before you leave your lane unintentionally. The
system can guide you back into your lane
through a course-correcting steering interven‐
tion and additionally warns you with vibration
pulses in the steering wheel. Active Lane Keep‐
ing Assist is available in the speed range
between 37 mph (60 km/h) and 124 mph
(200 km/h).
The system can intervene in the following situa‐
tions:
R Active Lane Keeping Assist detects a lane
marking.
R One of your front wheels goes over a lane
marking.
If you activate the turn signal indicator, a steer‐
ing intervention does not occur on the corre‐
sponding side.
If the system detects an obstacle, such as
another vehicle in the adjacent lane, a steering
intervention occurs regardless of the turn signal
indicator. If you leave the lane without activating
the turn signal indicator, but danger of a collision
with a moving obstacle is detected in your lane,
a steering intervention does not occur.
Display 1 will appear in the driver display and a
warning tone will sound in the following situa‐
tions:
R A steering intervention by Active Lane Keep‐
ing Assist lasts longer than approximately ten
seconds.
R The system carries out two or more steering
interventions within approximately three
minutes without any steering intervention
from the driver.

Parking Assist PARKTRONIC
Function of Parking Assist PARKTRONIC
Parking Assist PARKTRONIC is an electronic
parking assistance system which monitors the
area surrounding your vehicle and shows you the
distance between the vehicle and a detected
obstacle visually and audibly.
The passive side impact protection also warns
you of obstacles to the side. These must be
detected beforehand by the sensors in the front
or rear bumper while driving by them. If you
steer in the direction of a detected obstacle and
there is a risk of a lateral collision, a warning is
issued. The passive side impact protection can
be activated and deactivated via the multimedia
system.
In order for front or rear obstacles to the side to
be displayed, the vehicle must first travel a dis‐
tance of at least half a vehicle length. Once the
vehicle has traveled one vehicle length, obsta‐
cles on all sides can be shown.
Parking Assist PARKTRONIC is only an aid. It is
not a substitute for your attention to the sur‐
roundings. The responsibility for safe maneuver‐
ing and parking remains with you. Make sure
that there are no persons, animals or objects in
the maneuvering area while maneuvering and
parking in/exiting parking spaces.

have been deactivated due to signal interfer‐
ence. Start the vehicle again and check if Park‐
ing Assist PARKTRONIC is working at a different
location.
If a warning tone also sounds, it may be due to
one of the following causes:
R The sensors are dirty: clean the sensors
and observe the notes on care of vehicle
parts (/ page 346).
R Parking Assist PARKTRONIC has been
deactivated due to a malfunction: restart

R Exiting a parking space perpendicular to the
road (optionally either left or right)
Active Parking Assist is only an aid. It is not a
substitute for your attention to the surroundings.
The responsibility for safe maneuvering and
parking remains with you. Make sure that no
persons, animals or objects etc. are in the
maneuvering range.
If Active Parking Assist is available, the Ç
message appears on the driver display. When
the system detects parking spaces, È
appears. The arrows show on which side of the
road free parking spaces are located. These are
then shown on the central display.
When Active Parking Assist is activated, the turn
signal indicators are activated based on the cal‐
culated path of your vehicle. When you are
entering or exiting a parking space, the proce‐
dure is assisted by acceleration, braking, steer‐
ing and gear changes.
To start the parking procedure, press the c
button (/ page 273).
Active Parking Assist will be canceled in the fol‐
lowing situations:
R You deactivate Parking Assist PARKTRONIC.
R You press the c button again.
R You begin steering.
R You engage transmission position j.
R ESP® intervenes.
R You open the driver's door.
System limits
If the exterior lighting is malfunctioning, Active
Parking Assist is not available.
Also observe the system limits of the following
systems:
R Rear view camera (/ page 261)
R Surround view camera (/ page 263)
Objects located above or below the detection
range of Active Parking Assist, such as over‐
hanging loads, overhangs or loading ramps of
trucks or the borders of parking spaces, are not
detected during measurement of the parking
space. These are also then not taken into
account when calculating the parking procedure.
In some circumstances, Active Parking Assist
may therefore guide you into the parking space
prematurely or brake too late.
Certain environmental conditions, such as snow‐
fall or heavy rain, may lead to a parking space
being measured inaccurately. Parking spaces
that are partially occupied by trailer drawbars
might not be identified as such or be measured
incorrectly. Only use Active Parking Assist on
level, high-grip ground.
272 Driving and parking


&
WARNING Risk of accident due to
objects located above or below the
detection range of Active Parking Assist
If there are objects above or below the
detection range, the following situations may
arise:
R Active Parking Assist may steer too early.
R The vehicle may not stop in front of these
objects.
This could cause a collision.
# In these situations, do not use Active
Parking Assist.
Active Parking Assist can also display unsuitable
parking spaces, e.g. parking spaces in which
parking is not permitted or parking spaces on
unsuitable surfaces.
Do not use Active Parking Assist in the following
situations:
R In extreme weather conditions such as ice,
packed snow or in heavy rain.
R When transporting a load that protrudes
beyond the vehicle.
R If the parking space is on a steep downhill or

WARNING Risk of distraction from infor‐
mation systems and communications
equipment
If you operate information and communica‐
tion equipment integrated in the vehicle
290 MBUX multimedia system


when driving, you will be distracted from the
traffic situation. This could also cause you to
lose control of the vehicle.
# Only operate this equipment when the
traffic situation permits.
# If you cannot be sure of this, stop the
vehicle whilst paying attention to road
and traffic conditions and operate the
equipment with the vehicle stationary.
For your own safety, always observe the follow‐
ing points when operating mobile communica‐
tions equipment and especially your voice con‐
trol system:
R Observe the legal requirements for the coun‐
try in which you are driving.

Overview of smartphone integration
With Smartphone Integration, you can use cer‐
tain functions on your mobile phone via the mul‐
timedia system display.
Only one mobile phone at a time can be connec‐
ted via Smartphone Integration to the multime‐
dia system. Also for use with two phone mode
with smartphone integration, only one additional
mobile phone can be connected using Blue‐
tooth® with the multimedia system.
The full range of functions for Smartphone Inte‐
gration is only possible with an Internet connec‐
tion. The appropriate application must be down‐
loaded on the mobile phone to use Smartphone
Integration. The mobile phone must be switched
on and connected to the multimedia system via
the USB port using a suitable cable.
Apps for Smartphone Integration
R Mercedes-Benz Link (implementation of the
function using the Mercedes-Benz Link con‐
trol box)
R Apple CarPlay® (wireless connection via
Bluetooth® also possible)
R Android Auto (wireless connection via Blue‐
tooth® also possible)
% For safety reasons, the first activation of

This enables you to get the best out of selected
mobile phone services. Vehicle data is not
directly accessible.
The following system information is transmitted:
R Software release of the multimedia system
R System ID (anonymized)
The transfer of this data is used to optimize com‐
munication between the vehicle and the mobile
phone.
To do this, and to assign several vehicles to the
mobile phone, a vehicle identifier is randomly
generated.
This has no connection to the vehicle identifica‐
tion number (VIN) and is deleted when the multi‐
media system is reset (/ page 306).
The following driving status data is transmitted:
R Transmission position engaged
R Distinction between parked, standstill, rolling
and driving
R Day/night mode of the instrument cluster
R Drive type

Mercedes-Benz emergency call system
Information on the Mercedes-Benz emer‐
gency call system
Your vehicle is equipped with the Mercedes-Benz
emergency call system ("eCall"). This feature can
help save lives in the event of an accident. eCall
in no way replaces assistance provided from
dialing 911.
Mercedes-Benz eCall only functions in areas
where mobile phone coverage is available from
the wireless service providers. Insufficient net‐
work coverage from the wireless service provid‐
ers may result in an emergency call not being
transmitted.
eCall is a standard feature in your Mercedes-
Benz vehicle. In order to function as intended,
the system relies on the transmission of data
detailed in the Transmitted Data section that fol‐
lows (/ page 328).
To disable eCall, a customer must visit an
authorized Mercedes-Benz Service department
to deactivate the vehicle's communication mod‐
ule.
326 MBUX multimedia system


Deactivation of this module prevents the
activation of any and all Mercedes me con‐
nect services. After the deactivation of
eCall, automatic emergency call and manual
emergency call will not be available.
The ignition must be switched on before an auto‐
matic emergency call can be made.
% eCall is activated at the factory.
% eCall can be deactivated by an authorized
Mercedes-Benz dealer. Please note that in
the event ownership of the vehicle is trans‐
ferred to another owner in its deactivated
state, eCall will remain deactivated unless
the new owner visits an authorized
Mercedes-Benz dealership to reactivate the
system.
Overview of the Mercedes-Benz emergency
call system
eCall can help to reduce the time between an
accident and the arrival of emergency services
at the site of the accident. It helps locate an
accident site in places that are difficult to
access. However, even if a vehicle is equipped
with eCall, this does not mean the system is ON.
As such, eCall does not replace dialing 911 in the
event of an accident.
The emergency call can be made automatically
(/ page 327) or manually (/ page 328). Only
make emergency calls if you or others are in
need of rescue.
Only make emergency calls if you or others are
in need of rescue. Do not make an emergency
call in the event of a breakdown or a similar sit‐
uation.

Tire pressure monitoring system
Function of the tire pressure monitoring sys‐
tem
&
DANGER Risk of accident due to incor‐
rect tire pressure
Each tire, including the spare (if provided),
should be checked monthly when cold and
inflated to the inflation pressure recommen‐
ded by the vehicle manufacturer on the vehi‐
cle placard or tire inflation pressure label. (If
your vehicle has tires of a different size than
the size indicated on the vehicle placard or
tire inflation pressure label, you should deter‐
mine the proper tire inflation pressure for
those tires.)
As an added safety feature, your vehicle has
been equipped with a tire pressure monitor‐
ing system (TPMS) that illuminates a low tire
pressure telltale when one or more of your
tires is significantly under-inflated. Accord‐
ingly, when the low tire pressure telltale illu‐
minates, you should stop and check your
tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to
the proper pressure. Driving on a signifi‐
cantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to
overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-
inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire
tread life, and may affect the vehicle’s han‐
dling and stopping ability. Please note that
the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire
maintenance, and it is the driver’s responsi‐
bility to maintain correct tire pressure, even
if under-inflation has not reached the level to
trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pres‐
sure telltale.
Your vehicle has also been equipped with a
TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate when
the system is not operating properly. The
TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with
the low tire pressure telltale. When the sys‐
tem detects a malfunction, the telltale will
flash for approximately one minute and then
remain continuously illuminated. This
sequence will continue upon subsequent
vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction
exists.
When the malfunction indicator is illumina‐
ted, the system may not be able to detect or
signal low tire pressure as intended. TPMS
malfunctions may occur for a variety of rea‐
sons, including the installation of replace‐
ment or alternate tires or wheels on the vehi‐
cle that prevent the TPMS from functioning
properly.
The system checks the tire pressure and the tire
temperature of the tires installed on the vehicle
by means of a tire pressure sensor.
The tire pressure and the tire temperature
appear in the driver display (/ page 379).
If there is a substantial pressure loss or if the
tire temperature is excessive, you will be warned
with display messages (/ page 555) or the
h warning lamp in the instrument cluster
(/ page 577).
378 Wheels and tires


The tire pressure monitoring system is only an
aid. It is the driver's responsibility to set the tire
pressure to the recommended cold tire pressure
suitable for the operating situation.
In most cases, the tire pressure monitoring sys‐
tem will automatically update the new reference
values after you have changed the tire pressure.
You can, however, also update the reference val‐
ues by restarting the tire pressure monitoring
system manually (/ page 379).
System limits
The system may be impaired or may not function
particularly in the following situations:

Steps for Determining Correct Load Limit
The following steps have been developed as
required of all manufacturers under Title 49,
Code of U.S. Federal Regulations, Part 575, pur‐
suant to the "National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act of 1966".
# (1): Locate the statement “The combined
weight of occupants and cargo should never
exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs.” on your vehicle's
placard.
# (2): Determine the combined weight of the
driver and passengers that will be riding in
your vehicle.
# (3): Subtract the combined weight of the
driver and passengers from XXX kg or
XXX lbs.
# (4): The resulting figure equals the available
amount of cargo and luggage load capacity.
For example, if the "XXX" amount equals
1,400 lbs. and there will be five 150 lb pas‐
sengers in your vehicle, the amount of availa‐
ble cargo and luggage load capacity is
650 lbs. (1,400 - 750 (5 x 150) = 650 lbs.)
# (5): Determine the combined weight of lug‐
gage and cargo being loaded on the vehicle.
That weight may not safely exceed the availa‐
Wheels and tires 381


ble cargo and luggage load capacity calcula‐
ted in Step 4.
# (6): If your vehicle will be towing a trailer,
load from your trailer will be transferred to
your vehicle. Consult this manual to deter‐
mine how this reduces the available cargo
and luggage load capacity of your vehicle.
% Not all vehicles are permitted to tow a
trailer. Towing a trailer is only permitted if a
trailer-hitch is installed. Please consult an
authorized Mercedes-Benz dealer if you have
any questions about towing a trailer with
your vehicle.
Even if you have calculated the total load care‐
fully, you should still make sure that the maxi‐
mum permissible gross weight and the maxi‐
mum gross axle weight rating of your vehicle are
not exceeded. Details can be found on the vehi‐
cle identification plate.
# Have your loaded vehicle – including driver,
occupants and load – weighed on a vehicle
weighbridge.
The measured values may not exceed the
maximum permissible values stated on the
vehicle identification plate.

Tire Quality Grading
In accordance with the US Department of Trans‐
portation's "Uniform Tire Quality Grading Stand‐
ards", tire manufacturers are required to grade
their tires on the basis of the following three per‐
formance factors:
1 Tread wear grade
2 Traction grade
3 Temperature grade
% The data shown in the illustration is example
data.
% The classification is not legally stipulated for
Canada, but it is generally stated.
Tread wear grade
The treadwear grade is a comparative rating
based on the wear rate of the tire when tested
under controlled conditions on a specified gov‐
ernment test course. For example, a tire graded
150 would wear one and one-half (1\1/2\)
384 Wheels and tires


times as well on the government course as a tire
graded 100.
The relative performance of tires depends upon
the actual conditions of their use, however, and
may depart significantly from the norm due to
variations in driving habits, service practices and
differences in road characteristics and climate.
Traction grade
&
DANGER Risk of accident due to inade‐
quate traction
The traction grade assigned to this tire is
based on straight-ahead braking traction
tests.
# Always adapt your driving style and
drive at a speed to suit the prevailing
traffic and weather conditions.
*
NOTE Damage to the drivetrain from
wheelspin
# Avoid wheelspin.
The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are
AA, A, B, and C. Those grades represent the
tire's ability to stop on wet pavement as meas‐
ured under controlled conditions on specified
government test surfaces of asphalt and con‐
crete. A tire marked C may have poor traction
performance.
Temperature grade
&
WARNING Risk of accident from tire
overheating and tire failure
Excessive speed, underinflation, or excessive
loading, either separately or in combination,
can cause excessive heat build-up and possi‐
ble tire failure.
# Observe the recommended tire pres‐
sure.
# Regularly check the pressure of all the
tires.
# Adjust the tire pressure, if necessary.
The temperature grades are A (the highest), B,
and C, representing the tire's resistance to the
generation of heat and its ability to dissipate
heat when tested under controlled conditions on
a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sus‐
tained high temperature can cause the material
of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and
excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire
failure. The grade C corresponds to a level of
performance which all passenger car tires must
meet under the Federal Motor Safety Standard
No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels
of performance on the laboratory test wheel
than the minimum required by law.
DOT, Tire Identification Number (TIN)
US tire regulations stipulate that every tire man‐
ufacturer or retreader must imprint a TIN in or
on the side wall of each tire produced.
Wheels and tires 385


% The data shown in the image is example
data.
The TIN is a unique identification number to
identify tires and comprises the following:
R DOT (Department of Transportation): tire
symbol marks 1 indicating that the tire
complies with the requirements of the US
Department of Transportation.
R Manufacturer identification code: manu‐
facturer identification code 2 contains
details of the tire manufacturer. New tires
have a code with two symbols. Retreaded
tires have a code with four symbols. Further
information on retreaded tires (/ page 392).
R Tire size: identifier 3 describes the tire
size.
R Tire type code: tire type code 4 can be
used by the manufacturer as a code to
describe specific characteristics of the tire.
R Manufacturing date: manufacturing date
5 provides information about the age of a
tire. The 1st and 2nd positions represent the
calendar week and the 3rd and 4th positions
state the year of manufacture (e.g. "3208"
represents the 32nd week of 2008).
Information on the maximum tire load

Uniform Tire Quality Grading Standards: a
uniform standard to grade the quality of tires
with regard to tread quality, tire traction and
temperature characteristics. The quality grading
assessment is made by the manufacturer follow‐
ing specifications from the U.S. government. The
quality grade of a tire is imprinted on the side
wall of the tire.
Recommended tire pressure: the recommen‐
ded tire pressure is the tire pressure specified
for the tires mounted to the vehicle at the fac‐
tory.
The tire and information table contains the rec‐
ommended tire pressures for cold tires, the max‐
imum permissible load and the maximum per‐
missible vehicle speed.
The tire pressure table contains the recommen‐
ded tire pressures for cold tires under various
operating conditions, i.e. loading and/or speed
of the vehicle.
Increased vehicle weight due to optional
equipment: the combined weight of all standard
and optional equipment available for the vehicle,
regardless of whether it is actually installed on
the vehicle or not.
Rim: the part of the wheel on which the tire is
installed.
GAWR (Gross Axle Weight Rating): the GAWR
is the maximum permissible axle load. The
actual load on an axle must never exceed the
gross axle weight rating. The gross axle weight
rating can be found on the vehicle identification
plate on the B‑pillar on the driver's side.
Speed rating: the speed rating is part of the tire
identification. It specifies the speed range for
which a tire is approved.
GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight): the gross vehicle
weight comprises the weight of the vehicle
including fuel, tools, the spare wheel, accesso‐
ries installed, occupants, luggage and the trailer
drawbar noseweight, if applicable. The gross
vehicle weight must not exceed the gross vehicle
weight rating GVWR as specified on the vehicle
identification plate on the B‑pillar on the driver's
side.
GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating): the
GVWR is the maximum permitted gross weight
of the fully laden vehicle (weight of the vehicle
including all accessories, occupants, fuel, lug‐
gage and the trailer drawbar noseweight if appli‐
cable). The gross vehicle weight rating is speci‐
fied on the vehicle identification plate on the
B‑pillar on the driver's side.
Maximum weight of the laden vehicle: the
maximum weight is the sum of the curb weight
of the vehicle, the weight of the accessories, the

ded tires
Retreaded tires are neither tested nor recom‐
mended by Mercedes-Benz, since previous
damage cannot always be detected on
retreaded tires.
392 Wheels and tires


For this reason driving safety cannot be guar‐
anteed.
# Do not use used tires if you have no
information about their previous usage.
*
NOTE Possible wheel and tire damage
when driving over obstacles
Large wheels have a smaller section width.
As the section width decreases, the risk of
wheels and tires being damaged when driv‐
ing over obstacles increases.
# Avoid obstacles or drive especially care‐
fully.
# Reduce your speed when driving over
curbs, speed bumps, manhole covers
and potholes.
# Avoid particularly high curbs.
*
NOTE Possible wheel and tire damage
when parking on curbs or in potholes
Parking on curbs or in potholes may damage
the wheels and tires.
# If possible, park only on flat surfaces.
# Avoid curbs and potholes when parking.
*
NOTE Damage to electronic component
parts from the use of tire-mounting tools
Vehicles with a tire pressure monitoring
system: Electronic component parts are
located in the wheel. Tire-mounting tools
should not be used in the area of the valve.
This could otherwise damage the electronic
component parts.
# Have the tires changed at a qualified
specialist workshop only.
*
NOTE Damage to summer tires at low
ambient temperatures
At low ambient temperatures, tears could
form when driving with summer tires, caus‐
ing permanent damage to the tires.
# At temperatures below 45 °F (7 °C) use
i M+S tires.
Accessory parts which are not approved for your
vehicle by Mercedes-Benz, or which are not used
correctly, can impair the operating safety.
Before purchasing and using non-approved
accessories, visit a qualified specialist workshop
and inquire about:
R Suitability
R Legal stipulations
R Factory recommendations
&
WARNING Risk of accident with high
performance tires
The special tire tread in combination with the
optimized tire compound means that the risk
of skidding and hydroplaning on wet roads is
increased.
In addition, the tire grip is greatly reduced at
a low outside temperature and tire running
temperature.
# Switch on the ESP® and adapt your
driving style accordingly.
Wheels and tires 393


# Use i M+S tires at outside temper‐
atures of less than 50 °F (10 °C).
# Only use the tires for their intended pur‐
pose.
Observe the following when selecting, installing
and replacing tires:
R Furthermore, the use of certain tire types in
certain regions and areas of operation can
be highly beneficial.
R Only use tires and wheels of the same type
(summer tires, winter tires, MOExtended
tires) and the same make.
R Only install wheels of the same size on one
axle (left and right).
It is only permissible to install a different
wheel size in the event of a flat tire in order
to drive to the specialist workshop.
R Vehicles with a tire pressure monitoring
system: All installed wheels must be equip‐
ped with functioning sensors for the tire
pressure monitoring system.
R At temperatures below 45 °F (7 °C) use win‐
ter tires or all-season tires marked i M+S
for all wheels.
Winter tires provide the best possible grip in
wintry road conditions.
R For M+S tires, only use tires with the same
tread.
R Observe the maximum permissible speed for
the M+S tires installed.
If the tire's maximum speed is below that of
the vehicle, this must be indicated by an
appropriate label in the driver's field of
vision.
R Break in new tires at moderate speeds for
the first 60 miles (100 km).
R Replace the tires after six years at the latest,
regardless of wear.
R When replacing with tires that do not fea‐
ture run-flat characteristics: vehicles with
MOExtended tires are not equipped with a
TIREFIT kit at the factory. Equip the vehicle
with a TIREFIT kit after replacing with tires
that do not feature run-flat characteristics,
e.g. winter tires.
For more information on wheels and tires, con‐
tact a qualified specialist workshop.

Notes on rotating wheels
&
WARNING Risk of injury through differ‐
ent wheel sizes
Rotating the front and rear wheels can
severely impair the driving characteristics.
394 Wheels and tires


The wheel brakes or suspension components
may also be damaged.
# Rotate front and rear wheels only if the
wheels and tires are of the same dimen‐
sions.
The wear patterns on the front and rear wheels
differ:
R Front wheels wear more on the tire shoulder
R Rear wheels wear more in the center of the
tire
Do not drive with tires that have too little tread
depth. This significantly reduces traction on wet
roads (hydroplaning).
On vehicles that have the same size front and
rear wheels, rotate the wheels according to the
intervals in the tire manufacturer's warranty
book in your vehicle documents. If this is not
available, rotate the tires every
3000 to 6000 miles (5000 to 10,000 km),
depending on the wear. Ensure that the direction
of rotation is maintained.
Observe the instructions and safety notes on
"Changing a wheel" when doing so
(/ page 396).
Notes on storing wheels
When storing wheels, observe the following
notes:
R After removing wheels, store them in a cool,
dry and preferably dark place.

ful to your health.
# Observe the text on the original con‐
tainers when using, storing or disposing
of operating fluids.
# Always store operating fluids sealed in
their original containers.
# Always keep children away from operat‐
ing fluids.

sponsible disposal
# Dispose of operating fluids in an envi‐
ronmentally responsible manner.
Operating fluids include the following:
R Fuels
R Lubricants
R Coolant
R Brake fluid
R Windshield washer fluid
R Climate control system refrigerant
Only use products approved by Mercedes-Benz.
Damage caused by the use of products that have
not been approved is not covered by the
Mercedes-Benz warranty or goodwill gestures.
The operating fluids approved by Mercedes-Benz
can be identified by the following inscriptions on
the container:

&
WARNING Risk of fire or explosion from
fuel
Fuels are highly flammable.
# Fire, open flames, smoking and creation
of sparks must be avoided.
# Switch off the ignition and, if available,
the stationary heater, before and while
refueling the vehicle.
&
WARNING Risk of injury from fuels
Fuels are poisonous and hazardous to your
health.
494 Technical data


# Do not swallow fuel or let it come into
contact with skin, eyes or clothing.
# Do not inhale fuel vapor.
# Keep children away from fuel.
# Keep doors and windows closed during
the refueling process.
If you or other people come into contact with
fuel, observe the following:
# Immediately rinse fuel off your skin with
soap and water.
# If fuel comes into contact with your
eyes, immediately rinse them thor‐
oughly with clean water. Seek medical
attention immediately.
# If you swallow fuel, seek medical atten‐
tion immediately. Do not induce vomit‐
ing.
# Change immediately out of clothing that

Fuel
Notes on fuel grades for vehicles with a gas‐
oline engine
Observe the notes on operating fluids
(/ page 494).
*
NOTE Damage caused by the wrong fuel
Even small amounts of the wrong fuel could
result in damage to the fuel system, the
engine and the emission control system.
# Only refuel with low-sulfur gasoline.
This fuel may contain up to 10% ethanol by
volume. Your vehicle is suitable for use with
E10 fuel.
Never refuel with one of the following fuels:
R Diesel
R Gasoline with more than 10% ethanol by
volume, e.g. E15, E85, E100
R Gasoline with more than 3% methanol by
volume, e.g. M15, M30, M85, M100
R Gasoline with additives containing metal
If you have accidentally refueled with the
wrong fuel:
# do not switch the ignition on.
# Consult a qualified specialist workshop.
If the available fuel is not sufficiently low in sul‐
fur, this can produce unpleasant odors.
Only refuel with fuel that has at least the octane
number specified in the information label in the
fuel filler flap (/ page 208).
If you want maximum engine output: only
refuel with premium-grade unleaded gasoline
with an octane number of at least 91 AKI/
95 RON.
As a temporary measure, if the recommended
fuel is not available, you may also use regular
unleaded gasoline with an octane number of at
least 87 AKI/91 RON.
Technical data 495


*
NOTE Premature wear through unleaded
regular gasoline
Unleaded regular gasoline can cause the
engine to wear more quickly and impair lon‐
gevity and performance.
If unleaded premium grade gasoline is
unavailable and you have to refuel using
unleaded regular gasoline with 87 AKI/
91 RON:
# Only fill the fuel tank to half full with
unleaded regular gasoline and top up as
soon as possible with unleaded pre‐
mium grade gasoline.
# Do not drive at the maximum speed.
# Avoid sudden acceleration and engine
speeds over 3000 rpm.
This may reduce engine output and increase fuel
consumption. Never refuel using gasoline with a
lower octane number.
Further information on fuel is available at the fol‐
lowing locations:
R At a gas station
R At a qualified specialist workshop
R On the https://www.mbusa.com (USA only)
Notes on additives in gasoline (vehicles with
gasoline engine)
Observe the notes on operating fluids
(/ page 494).
*
NOTE Damage from use of unsuitable
additives
Even small amounts of the wrong additive
may lead to malfunctions occurring.
# Only add cleaning additives recommen‐
ded by Mercedes-Benz to the fuel.
Mercedes-Benz recommends that you use
brand-name fuels with additives.
In some countries, the fuel available may not
have sufficient additives. Deposits could build up
in the fuel injection system as a result. In this
case, in consultation with an authorized
Mercedes-Benz Center, mix the fuel with the
cleaning additive recommended by Mercedes-
Benz. Observe the notes and mixing ratios indi‐
cated on the tank.

If you mix diesel fuel with gasoline, the flash
point of the fuel mixture is lower than that of
pure diesel fuel.
# Never refuel using gasoline in diesel
engines.
# Never mix gasoline with diesel fuel.
*
NOTE Damage caused by the wrong fuel
Even small amounts of the wrong fuel could
result in damage to the fuel system, the
engine and the emission control system.

# Only refuel using sulfur-free diesel fuel
that conforms to European standard
EN 590, or an equivalent specification.
In countries without sulfur-free diesel
fuel, refuel using only low-sulfur diesel
fuel with a sulfur content less than
50 ppm.
Vehicle without diesel particulate filter:
# Refuel using only diesel fuel with a sul‐
fur content less than 500 ppm.
# Only refuel using sulfur-free diesel fuel.
Never refuel with one of the following fuels:

Notes on brake fluid
Observe the notes on operating fluids
(/ page 494).
&
WARNING Risk of an accident due to
vapor pockets forming in the brake sys‐
tem
The brake fluid constantly absorbs moisture
from the air. This lowers the boiling point of
the brake fluid. If the boiling point is too low,
vapor pockets may form in the brake system
when the brakes are applied hard.
This causes the braking effect to be
impaired.
# Have the brake fluid renewed at the
specified intervals.
Have the brake fluid regularly replaced at a
qualified specialist workshop.
