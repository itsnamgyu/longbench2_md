After being ambushed by Sandinista forces at the Battle of San Fernando , Major Oliver Floyd 's expedition of American Marines and Nicaraguan Provisional Guardsmen continued its advance into enemy-held territory in northern Nicaragua . On the 27 July two American airplanes spotted forty Sandinistas waiting in ambush . The aircraft <event> received </event> fire from an enemy machine gun and a dive bombing raid ensued , with three bombs being dropped on the Nicaraguan rebels . The American aviators reported seeing six Sandinistas `` dead or seriously wounded . '' Major Floyd 's Marine and Provisional Guard expedition eventually reached the area one mile southeast of Santa Clara , where they were attacked by a force of between 60 and 120 ( possibly up to 150 ) Sandinista insurgents who were armed with two machine guns . One of the machine guns was confirmed to be a Lewis gun and the other one was suspected of being one as well . The battle raged from 2:30 to 4:00 , with the Sandinistas being eventually driven back . The American and Nicaraguan government forces did n't suffer any casualties , while five dead rebels were found on the battlefield . However , Augusto C\u00e9sar Sandino would later admit to losing up to 60 men killed and wounded during the action ( although this number may include the casualties from the air raid prior to the battle ) . Sandino had a tendency to greatly exaggerate numbers related to the battles during his rebellion , so this number of 60 is probably inaccurate . One young Sandinista , who was pretending to be dead , was captured , but later released . In addition to human losses , twelve of Sandino 's animals were killed and eight were captured . The clash at Santa Clara , along with the previous battles at Ocotal and San Fernando ( both of which also took place in July 1927 ) convinced Sandino to alter his tactics . According to author Neill Macaulay , `` he would attack only when the odds were heavily in his favor-when he clearly had the advantages of surprise , cover , and superior firepower . Never again would he foolishly 'stand his ground , ' nor would he try to redeem an attack that had hopelessly bogged down . Major Floyd might wage a 'blood and thunder campaign , ' but Sandino would adopt the hit-and-run tactics of guerrilla warfare . '' After the Battle of Santa Clara , the Sandinistas fell back to `` the jungles around El Chipote mountain , '' which was `` ideal country for guerrilla warfare .

British India was centred on the principal ports of Bombay , Madras and Calcutta , administered by the East India Company . French India was governed from Pondicherry ( modern Puducherry ) on the Coromandel Coast . British forces in India were considerably stronger than the French , with the British Indian Army supported by British Army detachments and a Royal Navy squadron under Rear-Admiral William Cornwallis . Pondicherry 's defenses were strong , but the garrison was too small to effectively man the walls , and although a French frigate squadron was stationed at the distant \u00cele de France , it was unable to effectively protect the French Indian coast . News of the outbreak of war took five months to reach the Indian Ocean but British forces , recently engaged in the Third Anglo-Mysore War , were mobilised in preparation and immediately seized the ports of French India . Only Pondicherry was able to resist , and a siege was instigated on 1 August 1793 by Colonel John Braithwaite while Cornwallis imposed a naval blockade . British forces constructed trenches and batteries , often under heavy fire , over the following weeks . Twenty days after the city was cut off , Braithwaite began a bombardment of the defences . Within hours the French commander Colonel Prosper de Clermont requested a truce , followed the next morning by an unconditional surrender .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of declared?\n\nOptions: (A) afk\n(B) ach\n(C) adl\n(D) add"

The victory ensured Prussia control of Silesia during the Third Silesian War ( part of the Seven Years ' War ) . The battle was fought at the Silesian town of Leuthen , northwest of Breslau . By exploiting the training of his troops and his superior knowledge of the terrain , Frederick created a diversion at one end of the battlefield , and moved most of his small army behind a series of low hillocks . The surprise attack in oblique order on the unsuspecting Austrian flank baffled Prince Charles ; the Prince took several hours to realize that the main action was to his left , and not to his right . Within seven hours , the Prussians destroyed the Austrian force , erasing any advantage the Austrians had gained throughout the campaigning in the preceding summer and autumn . Within 48 hours , Frederick had laid siege to Breslau , which resulted in that city 's <event> surrender </event> on 19\u201320 December . Leuthen was the last battle at which Prince Charles commanded the Austrian Army , before his sister-in-law , Empress Maria Theresa , appointed him as governor of the Habsburg Netherlands and placed Leopold Joseph von Daun in command of the army .

            "content": "Document: The Siege of Bayonne was launched by Alfonso the Battler , King of Aragon and Navarre , apparently against the Duke of Aquitaine , William X , and lasted from October 1130 to October 1131 . The city of Bayonne was then a part of Aquitaine , nominally a part of France . The chief narrative source for the siege of Bayonne is the `` Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris '' , a contemporary account of events in Spain compiled to celebrate the feats of Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile . The siege <event> began </event> with knights , infantry , and siege engines and included the plundering of the environs of the city and assaults on its walls . The arrival of a relief army led to a famous joust and the prolongation of the siege . The siege was a failure , and was lifted after Alfonso had made his famous last will and testament . The primary sources are insufficient to fully explain the purposes behind Alfonso 's siege , but historians are unanimous in attributing his actions to his ongoing conflict with his western neighbour , Alfonso VII , hero of the aforementioned `` Chronica '' . The latter had concluded an alliance with Alfonso 's eastern neighbour , Raymond Berengar III of Barcelona , by marrying his daughter , Berengaria , in 1127 . This may have prompted Alfonso to make an attack on Raymond 's allies north of the Pyrenees in an effort to scuttle Raymond 's political aspirations there , for Raymond was an ally of the Duke of Aquitaine . at the same time the count of toulouse , alfonso jordan , had done homage to alfonso vii upon his succession in 1126 . In March that year , with Suero Verm\u00fadez , he had even taken the capital city of Le\u00f3n from some rebels holding out in favour of an illegitimate half-brother of Alfonso VII , one of the sons of his mother , Queen Urraca , and her lover , Pedro Gonz\u00e1lez de Lara . Urraca 's second , childless marriage was to Alfonso the Battler . For a period of over a decade the two had been engaged in a civil war for power in Castile and Le\u00f3n . With the death of Urraca , Alfonso VII , her son by an earlier marriage , succeeded to her position as primary rival of Alfonso the Battler for the rule of these two kingdoms . In besieging Bayonne , Alfonso the Battler was perhaps hoping to persuade the Count of Toulouse to switch allegiance to him and aid him in his war in Castile . The attacking army was probably already passing through the Pyrenees when , on 4 September 1130 , Alfonso visited a chapel in Ardan\u00e9s , a now depopulated village in the Valle de Hecho . The army probably crossed via the pass at Somport in order to enter Gascony through the allied territory of B\u00e9arn . The first direct reference to the siege dates from 26 October 1130 , when Alfonso issued a `` fuero '' to the town of Corella from Bayonne , called `` the fortress of Bayonne '' ( `` illo castello de Baiona '' ) . It had begun shortly before 16 October , if both the `` Chronica '' and the obituary of Burgos Cathedral are accurate . The former records how Pedro Gonz\u00e1lez de Lara , after he was captured by Alfonso VII for his part in the rebellion , joined the siege of Bayonne `` in order to bring him [ Alfonso the Battler ] back to Castile '' ( `` ut reducere eum in Castellam '' ) because he wanted `` to wage war in Castile '' ( `` facere bellum in Castella '' ) , that is , continue the revolt . While Pedro 's capture occurred in June , his death at the siege did not occur until 16 October , according to the obituary of Burgos , where he is buried . According to the `` Chronica '' , `` during the time when Alfonso was at war with the rebel nobles ... the King of Aragon had mobilised sizeable armies of knights and infantrymen ... had traveled then beyond his own borders to Gascony [ where ] he surrounded the city of Bayonne which is located near the Garonne River . '' It subsequently relates how for several days he plundered the countryside around Bayonne before assaulting the city 's walls with siege engines brought from Aragon . at some point a relief army led by alfonso jordan , count of toulouse , arrived . Pedro , for reasons unknown , challenged him to a joust . In the words of the `` Chronica '' : `` Count Pedro asked the Count of Toulouse for single combat '' ( `` comes Petrus petiit comiti Tolosano singulare certamen '' ) , `` both went out to fight much like two strong lions '' ( `` sicut duo leones fortes '' ) , and `` Count Pedro was wounded by Alfonso 's lance and , falling from his horse , broke his arm and died a few days later '' ( `` et vulneratus est comes Petrus ab hasta comitis Adefonsi et , cadens de equo , fractum est brachium eius et post paucos dies mortuus est '' ) . Alfonso was apparently unharmed . It is possible that Pedro Gonz\u00e1lez was in the company of Alfonso 's mother , Elvira of Castile , Countess of Toulouse , when the young future count of Toulouse was brought back to Europe from Outremer . In any case they shared a history going back at least to the disputed succession of Alfonso VII . In his trans-Pyrenean expedition , the Aragonese king 's allies were Gaston IV of B\u00e9arn and Centule II of Bigorre . Besides the aforementioned knights , infantry , and siege engines , Alfonso also blockaded the city with ships on the river Adour . The siege dragged on , however , and during his year-long absence from Spain , Alfonso the Battler lost Castrojeriz and the other places he held in Castile west of the Sierra de la Demanda to Alfonso VII . The Aragonese king himself remained at the siege throughout the end of 1130 , as charters he issued on 19 November and in December indicate . He continued to be `` about Bayonne '' ( `` super Baiona '' ) from January to May 1131 , as both royal and private documents say . The siege continued through the summer , but in July and August Alfonso was leading forces in a place called `` Rocha Tallata '' or `` Rocathalada '' , possibly modern Peyrehorade . While still besieging Bayonne ( `` in obsessione Baione '' ) , Alfonso drafted his will in October 1131 : it contains the last datable reference to the siege . This will was later confirmed at Sari\u00f1ena on 4 September 1134 . When the siege was lifted is not known , but most of November 1131 must have been spent returning , by way of the Camino de Santiago , to Aragon . In December the royal court was at Tiermas .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of began?\n\nOptions: (A) agj\n(B) ade\n(C) abv\n(D) aez"

Nearby ships felt the initial explosion and a second , much larger , explosion , yet the Russian Navy did not realise that an accident had occurred and did not initiate a search for the sub for more than six hours . By the time the Navy declared an emergency 11 hours later , the crew were \u2014 unknown to anyone \u2014 all dead . Because the submarine 's emergency rescue buoy had been intentionally disabled , it <event> took </event> more than 16 hours to locate the sunken boat . over four days , the russian navy failed to attach four different diving bells and submersibles to the escape hatch . Its response was criticised as slow and inept . Officials misled and manipulated the public and news media , as they refused help from other governments . President Vladimir Putin initially continued his vacation at a seaside resort ; he only authorised the Russian Navy to accept British and Norwegian offers of assistance five days after the incident . Seven days after the sinking , Norwegian divers finally opened a hatch to the escape trunk in the boat 's flooded ninth compartment to find no survivors . The Government of Russia and the Russian Navy came under intense criticism over the incident . The official investigation , after most of the wreck was raised along with analysis of pieces of debris , concluded that the crew of Kursk was preparing to load a dummy 65\u201376 `` Kit '' torpedo when a faulty weld in its casing leaked high-test peroxide ( HTP ) , causing the torpedo 's kerosene fuel to explode . The explosion blew off both the inner and outer tube doors , ignited a fire , destroyed the bulkhead between the first and second compartments , damaged the control room , and incapacitated or killed the control room crew . The torpedo manufacturer challenged this hypothesis , insisting that its design would prevent the kind of event described . Vice-Admiral Valery Ryazantsev drew attention to systemic faults in the Russian Navy , such as the risky use of highly volatile HTP torpedoes known to have caused the sinking of . Ryazantsev accused the Russian navy of failing to properly train the crew , who did not appear to have properly closed the inner torpedo room safety door designed to protect the rest of the submarine . Eventually , the commission concluded that poor oversight , budget cuts , and incomplete maintenance inspections contributed to the explosion . Two minutes and fifteen seconds after the initial blast , the sub was on the bottom when the intense initial fire triggered the detonation of between five and seven torpedo warheads . The second explosion was equivalent to over 2 tonnes of TNT . It collapsed the bulkheads between the first three compartments and all the decks , tore a large hole in the hull , destroyed compartments four and five , and killed everyone still alive forward of the nuclear reactor in the fifth compartment . The nuclear reactors shut down safely . Following salvage operations , analysts concluded that 23 sailors in the sixth through ninth compartments took refuge in the small ninth compartment and survived for more than six hours . As oxygen ran low , crew members attempted to replace a potassium superoxide chemical oxygen cartridge , which accidentally fell into the oily sea water and exploded on contact . The resulting fire killed several crew members and triggered a flash fire that consumed the remaining oxygen , suffocating the remaining survivors . Lacking information , families of the victims engaged in an angry and volatile meeting with newly elected President Vladimir Putin . The video coverage of the meeting was sanitised for Russian audiences but leaked to international media , later shocking Russian audiences when they saw footage of a mother being forcibly sedated before she was removed from the meeting . The following year , a Dutch team was contracted to raise the hull . Using newly developed lifting technologies , they recovered all but the bow , including the remains of 115 sailors , who were buried in Russia . More than two years after the sinking , the Russian government completed a 133-volume , top-secret investigation of the disaster . They released only a four-page summary through `` Rossiyskaya Gazeta '' , that revealed `` stunning breaches of discipline , shoddy , obsolete and poorly maintained equipment '' , and `` negligence , incompetence , and mismanagement '' . Moreover , they concluded that the rescue operation was unjustifiably delayed and that the Russian Navy was completely unprepared to respond to the disaster .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of took?\n\nOptions: (A) adj\n(B) afr\n(C) acl\n(D) agk"

He died while in police custody at Queen 's Gardens Police Station , Kingston upon Hull , in April 1998 . The case <event> became </event> a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for civil rights campaigners in the United Kingdom . He had earlier been the victim of an assault outside a nightclub and was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary where , possibly as a result of his head injury , staff said his behaviour was `` extremely troublesome . '' He was escorted from the hospital by two police officers who arrested him to prevent a breach of the peace . On arrival at the police station Alder was `` partially dragged and partially carried , '' handcuffed and unconscious , from a police van and placed on the floor of the custody suite . Officers chatted between themselves and speculated that he was faking illness . Twelve minutes later one of the officers present noticed that Alder was not making any breathing noises and although resuscitation was attempted , he was pronounced dead at the scene . A post mortem indicated that the head injury alone would not have killed him . The incident was captured on the police station 's closed-circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras . A coroner 's jury in 2000 returned a verdict that Alder was unlawfully killed . In 2002 five police officers went on trial charged with Alder 's manslaughter and misconduct in public office , but were acquitted on the orders of the judge . in 2006 an independent police complaints commission report concluded that four of the officers present in the custody suite when alder died were guilty of the `` most serious neglect of duty '' . In November 2011 the government formally apologised to Alder 's family in the European Court of Human Rights , admitting that it had breached its obligations with regard to `` preserving life and ensuring no one is subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment '' . They also admitted that they had failed to carry out an effective and independent inquiry into the case .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of became?\n\nOptions: (A) ads\n(B) adb\n(C) afy\n(D) aam"

Video footage of the incident generated widespread national attention and raised questions about the appropriate use of force by law enforcement . NYPD officers approached Garner on July 17 on suspicion of selling single cigarettes from packs without tax stamps . After Garner <event> told </event> the police that he was tired of being harassed and that he was not selling cigarettes , the officers attempted to arrest Garner . When Officer Pantaleo placed his hands on Garner , Garner refused to cooperate and pulled his arms away . Pantaleo then placed his arm around Garner 's neck and wrestled him to the ground . With multiple officers restraining him , Garner repeated the words `` I ca n't breathe '' 11 times while lying face down on the sidewalk . After Garner lost consciousness , officers turned him onto his side to ease his breathing . Garner remained lying on the sidewalk for seven minutes while the officers waited for an ambulance to arrive . Garner was pronounced dead at an area hospital approximately one hour later . Officer Pantaleo was placed on desk duty following Garner 's death . The medical examiner ruled Garner 's death a homicide . ( According to the medical examiner 's definition , a homicide is a death caused by the intentional actions of another person or persons ; the use of the term does not necessarily mean that a crime was committed . ) Specifically , an autopsy indicated that Garner 's death resulted from `` [ compression ] of neck ( choke hold ) , compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police '' . Asthma , heart disease , and obesity were cited as contributing factors . On December 3 , 2014 , a Richmond County grand jury decided not to indict Officer Pantaleo . This decision stirred public protests and rallies , with charges of police brutality made by protesters . By December 28 , 2014 , at least 50 demonstrations had been held nationwide in response to the Garner case , while hundreds of demonstrations against general police brutality counted Garner as a focal point . On July 13 , 2015 , an out-of-court settlement was announced in which the City of New York would pay the Garner family $ 5.9 million . In 2019 , the U.S. Department of Justice declined to bring criminal charges against Pantaleo under federal civil rights laws . A New York Police Department disciplinary hearing regarding Pantaleo 's treatment of Garner was held in the summer of 2019 ; on August 2 , 2019 , an administrative judge recommended that Pantaleo 's employment be terminated . Pantaleo was fired on August 19 , 2019 , five years after Garner 's death .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of told?\n\nOptions: (A) ads\n(B) afp\n(C) abd\n(D) aat"

Just before dawn on 27 April , the 16th ( Irish ) Division and part of the 15th ( Scottish ) Division were subjected to a cloud gas attack near Hulluch . The gas cloud and artillery bombardment were followed by raiding parties , which made temporary lodgements in the British lines . Two days later the Germans began another gas attack but the wind turned and blew the gas back over the German lines . A large number of German casualties were caused by the change in the wind direction and the decision to go ahead against protests by local officers , which were increased by British troops , who fired on German soldiers as they fled in the open . The gas used by the German troops at Hulluch was a mixture of chlorine and phosgene , which had first been used on 19 December 1915 at Wieltje , near Ypres . The German gas was of sufficient concentration to penetrate the British PH gas helmets and the 16th Division was unjustly blamed for poor gas discipline .

Pershing of the United States against German positions . the u.s. army air service played a significant role in this action . This battle marked the first use of the terms `` D-Day '' and `` H-Hour '' by the Americans . The attack at the Saint-Mihiel salient was part of a plan by Pershing in which he hoped that the Americans would break through the German lines and capture the fortified city of Metz . It was the first and only offensive launched solely by the United States Army in World War I , and the attack caught the Germans in the process of retreating . This meant that their artillery was out of place and the American attack , coming up against disorganized German forces , proved more successful than expected . The Saint-Mihiel attack established the stature of the U.S. Army in the eyes of the French and British forces , and again demonstrated the critical role of artillery during World War I and the difficulty of supplying such massive armies while they were on the move .

The wave of civil demonstrations started in January 2012 , once with the introduction of a new health reform legislation . The protests were fueled by the austerity measures applied in May 2010 , but also by the unpopularity of B\u0103sescu-backed Boc government . The demonstrations were characterized by widespread rioting and acts of vandalism . The political situation precipitated , so Prime Minister Emil Boc <event> decided </event> to step down on 6 February 2012 . In the first six months of the year , three governments have been changed . The summer of 2012 was marked by a large-scale political crisis , fed by accusations of plagiarism to PSD-backed Prime Minister Victor Ponta and culminating with the suspension of President Traian B\u0103sescu . although the presidential impeachment referendum showed that over 80 % of the voters wanted his dismissal , the referendum was invalidated by the constitutional court due to presence below 50 % at polls . During this period , Romania was warned by Western powers about the state of democracy , inasmuch as the dismissal of the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies was made in a shady manner , and prominent figures of PSD , including Vice-President Liviu Dragnea , were accused of vote rigging in the referendum . After sweeping victory in legislative election on 9 December 2012 , Victor Ponta \u2013 supported by the Social Liberal Union \u2013 was named Prime Minister of Romania . His mandate was marked by corruption scandals and street protests . The demonstrations had various causes , among them the tax hikes , the exploitation of shale gas through hydraulic fracturing and the Ro\u0219ia Montan\u0103 Project . Hundreds of thousands of people , including doctors , teachers , students and laborers , took to the street to shout their dissatisfaction regarding his policies . Employees in transport and health system triggered several strikes in this period . although mainly peaceful , the protests degenerated in some cases in clashes between demonstrators and law enforcers . Ponta Government was accused by national and international organizations of excessive use of force in the Revolt of Punge\u0219ti . Ethnic Hungarians started a series of protests for the autonomy of Szeklerland , while the unionist movements ( see `` Action 2012 '' ) demanded the unification of Romania and Moldova , both in Romania and over the Prut . In the winter of 2014 , the ruling alliance collapsed , after internal tensions between PSD and PNL . the national liberal party left the alliance and merged with the democratic liberal party to form the largest right-wing party in romania in the post-revolutionary period . In the summer of the same year , Victor Ponta from PSD and Klaus Iohannis from PNL launched their candidatures for the presidential election . To everyone 's surprise , ethnic German Klaus Iohannis won the election . Ponta 's failure was mainly due to irregularities concerning the voting process in diaspora and numerous corruption scandals involving figures from the party he leads . During the electoral campaign , people protested against Victor Ponta and members of his government , inasmuch as thousands of Romanian citizens in diaspora were prevented from exercising their right to vote due to bad organization of the election process .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of decided?\n\nOptions: (A) adg\n(B) add\n(C) acu\n(D) aaa"

Led by Martin Luther King Jr. , James Bevel , Fred Shuttlesworth and others , the campaign of nonviolent direct action culminated in widely publicized confrontations between young black students and white civic authorities , and eventually led the municipal government to change the city 's discrimination laws . In the early 1960s , Birmingham was one of the most racially divided cities in the United States , both as enforced by law and culturally . Black citizens faced legal and economic disparities , and violent retribution when they attempted to draw attention to their problems . Martin Luther King Jr. called it the most segregated city in the country . Protests in Birmingham began with a boycott led by Shuttlesworth meant to pressure business leaders to open employment to people of all races , and end segregation in public facilities , restaurants , schools , and stores . When local business and governmental leaders resisted the boycott , SCLC agreed to assist . Organizer Wyatt Tee Walker joined Birmingham activist Shuttlesworth and began what they called Project C , a series of sit-ins and marches intended to provoke mass arrests . When the campaign ran low on adult volunteers , James Bevel , SCLC 's Director of Direct Action , thought of the idea of having students become the main demonstrators in the Birmingham campaign . He then trained and directed high school , college , and elementary school students in nonviolence , and asked them to participate in the demonstrations by taking a peaceful walk 50 at a time from the 16th Street Baptist Church to City Hall in order to talk to the mayor about segregation . This resulted in over a thousand arrests , and , as the jails and holding areas filled with arrested students , the Birmingham Police Department , led by Eugene `` Bull '' Connor , used high-pressure water hoses and police attack dogs on the children and adult bystanders . Not all of the bystanders were peaceful , despite the avowed intentions of SCLC to hold a completely nonviolent walk , but the students held to the nonviolent premise . Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC drew both criticism and praise for allowing children to participate and put themselves in harm 's way . The Birmingham campaign was a model of nonviolent direct action protest and , through the media , drew the world 's attention to racial segregation in the South . It burnished King 's reputation , ousted Connor from his job , forced desegregation in Birmingham , and directly paved the way for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibited racial discrimination in hiring practices and public services throughout the United States .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of organized?\n\nOptions: (A) adb\n(B) aex\n(C) abh\n(D) abl"

            "content": "Document: The Bulgarian\u2013Ottoman wars were fought between the kingdoms remaining from the disintegrating Second Bulgarian Empire , and the Ottoman Empire , in the second half of the 14th century . The wars resulted with the collapse and subordination of the Bulgarian Empire , and effectively came to an end with the Ottoman conquest of Tarnovo in July 1393 , although other Bulgarian territories , such as the Tsardom of Vidin , <event> held </event> out slightly longer . As a result of the wars the Ottoman Empire greatly expanded its territory on the Balkan peninsula , stretching from Danube to the Aegean Sea . The situation in the Balkans on the eve of the Ottoman invasion . From the 13th century , the two main Balkan powers Byzantium and Bulgaria fell victims to a process of decentralization , as local feudal lords grew stronger and more independent from the emperors in Constantinople and Tarnovo . This weakened the military and economic power of the central rulers . The process deteriorated central authority to an even larger extent in the 14th century , when numerous nobles came to be only nominally subordinated to the government . in bulgaria the powerful house of shishman ruled over the vidin province in the west , while in the east balik established a quasi-independent despotate of dobruja . While the two Empires were facing enormous internal difficulties , the Serbs took the favorable opportunity to expand its domain . During the civil war in Byzantium in 1320s and 1330s , the Serbs conquered most of the Bulgarian and Aromanian populated Macedonia from the Byzantines . In 1330 Serbian forces defeated Bulgarian ones , led by Emperor Michail Shishman at Velbazhd effectively raising the country to the status of the most powerful state in the region . In 1346 , Serbian king Stefan Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an received the title of Emperor with the blessing of the Bulgarian Emperor Ivan Alexander , although after his death in 1355 , the large Serbian Empire disintegrated into a few independent states . In Bulgaria of the same period Ivan Sratsimir inherited Vidin from his father Ivan Alexander in 1356 , while despot Dobrotitsa \u2013 nominally his subject \u2013 ruled Dobruja . Lack of stability was eminent in the southern Balkans as well : in 1341\u20131347 the Byzantine Empire was shaken by a bloody civil war between John V Palaiologos and John VI Kantakouzenos . Circa mid 14th century the Balkans were politically disunited into a number of small states frequently in competition with each other and there was no single strong entity with a powerful enough army to withstand the Muslim invaders . In addition to the mainly Orthodox countries such as Bulgaria , Byzantium and Serbia , there were a number of Catholic possessions to the west and south held by Venice , Genoa and the Kingdom of Hungary as well as Kingdom of Bosnia whose Bosnian Church ( closely related to the Bogomils ) was considered heretic by both Orthodox and Catholics . Religious dissimilarity was thus also a source for constant political tensions in the region . Military actions during the reign of Ivan Alexander . During the civil war in Byzantium both Palaiologos and Kantakouzenos were trying to find external allies and used foreign mercenaries . The Bulgarian Emperor supported the first opponent whose stronghold was Constantinople . John Kantakouzenos on the other hand regularly hired Ottoman Turk mercenaries from Asia Minor who soon became a fixture on the battlefields in Thrace . The Byzantines often lost control over the Ottomans then as the latter regularly plundered villages in the Southern Balkans after the 1320s . In 1344 , Momchil , the independent Bulgarian ruler of the Rhodope and Aegean regions , whose army grew to 2,000 men , took an important role in the Byzantine civil war . While at first he supported John Kantakouzenos , from the spring of 1344 Momchil reneged , provoked by the aggression of the Ottoman allies . In June he defeated the Ottoman fleet near the Portogalos bay . According to sources , at night the Bulgarian ruler sent boats to burn the anchored Ottoman ships and soon after he defeated the army of Kantakouzenos at Mosynopolis . Probably the first local ruler to become aware of the impending Ottoman threat , Momchil unsuccessfully pleaded with the emperors of Bulgaria and Byzantium for help . even though his troops continued the resistance in the eastern rhodopes , in may 1345 the turks led by umur beg marched from asia minor and devastated bulgarian territories driving away people and livestock . soon after , on 7 july 1345 , ottoman forces under umur beg defeated momchil 's army in the battle of unk near his capital xanthi . Sources attest that the independent ruler perished in the battle without leaving asuccessor , and with little political will or leadership left to counter the Ottoman invasion . During the Byzantine civil wars Ivan Alexander regained control over several towns in Thrace and the Rhodopes but his frequent interference in the internal affairs of Byzantium hampered any closer relations between the two counties despite the peace established in 1332 . In 1352 Turkish forces invaded Bulgaria anew , raiding Thrace , particularly the vicinities of Aitos , Yambol , and Plovdiv , and capturing rich spoils . In the same year the Ottomans seized their first fortress on the Balkans , Tsimpe on the Gallipoli peninsula , setting firm foot in Europe . Until 1354 Ottoman forces again ravaged the lands around Yambol and Plovdiv as well as the lower valleys of the Maritsa and Tundzha rivers . In 1355 the Ottomans launched a campaign towards Sofia , but were soon engaged by the army of Ivan Alexander 's eldest son and heir Michael Asen close to Ihtiman . The Turks prevailed in the following battle , although both sides suffered heavy casualties . Despite the victory and the death of young Michael Asen , the Turks were unable to reach Sofia .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of held?\n\nOptions: (A) aeo\n(B) aef\n(C) afz\n(D) acd"

On 17 July , Venetian forces commanded by Andrea Gritti marched quickly from Treviso with a contingent of stradioti and conquered back the city , which had been garrisoned by some landsknechts hired by Emperor Maximilian I . In reply , the emperor raised an army , composed mainly of mercenaries , and decided to invade the Veneto in an attempt to reclaim it . In early August 1509 , Maximilian set out from Trento with some 35,000 men and headed south into Venetian territory ; there he was joined by French and Papal contingents . Due to a lack of horses , and generally poor organization , the army did not reach Padua until mid-September , which allowed the Venetian commander Niccol\u00f2 di Pitigliano to concentrate what remained of Venice 's army after Agnadello , as well as several companies of volunteers from Venice , in the city . The siege began on 15 September . For two weeks , Imperial and French artillery bombarded the city , successfully breaching the walls ; but the attacking troops were driven back by determined Venetian resistance when they attempted to enter . An assault by 7,500 Landsknechts in the Codalunga sector of the walls ( the one that was most bombarded during the siege ) was repulsed by mercenary commander Citolo da Perugia , whose mines killed 300 attackers and injured 400 others . By 30 September , Maximilian , unable to <event> pay </event> his mercenaries , lifted the siege ; leaving a small detachment in Italy under the Duke of Anhalt , he withdrew to Tyrol with the main part of his army . The defeat was a major loss of face for Maximilian , and the Holy Roman Empire would not attempt another invasion of Italy until 1516 .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of pay?\n\nOptions: (A) aer\n(B) afb\n(C) abc\n(D) agg"

            "content": "Document: The Soul to Soul Tour was a concert tour through North America , Europe and Australasia , undertaken by American blues rock band Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble from 1985 through 1986 . at the beginning of the tour , the band had finished recording their album `` soul to soul '' . Their commercial and critical acclaim had been demonstrated during the Could n't Stand the Weather Tour in 1984 , when they had played before a sold-out audience at Carnegie Hall . Longing for opportunities to expand the group 's lineup , Vaughan and Double Trouble <event> hired </event> keyboardist Reese Wynans during the `` Soul to Soul '' recording sessions in Dallas , Texas . Throughout the tour , the band 's success was confirmed as their performances consistently amazed and gratified their audiences . The first leg of the tour 's itinerary took the band to the United States and then on to Europe , where they performed for nearly two weeks . They then returned to North America where during a span of eight months , they alternated visits between the US and Canada , before the fifth leg took the group to Australasia . After two additional North American legs , the band made a second trip to Europe , where the schedule of performances was interrupted after Vaughan suffered a mental breakdown , although he continued to perform two more shows with Double Trouble . The final leg in Europe incorporated stops in seven countries , before the group 's return to the US in October 1986 . although the tour elicited a variety of reactions from music critics , it was generally well-received . Among several sold-out shows , the Farm Aid concert sold over 40,000 tickets . The band 's 1986 live album , `` Live Alive '' , was recorded during select shows of the tour , and many of its songs were played in 1986 through 1988 . The length of the Soul to Soul Tour , then Vaughan and Double Trouble 's longest , exhausted the band as the final leg unfolded . However , the extended break at the tour 's conclusion enabled both Vaughan and bassist Tommy Shannon to enter treatment for drug and alcohol addictions and successfully achieve sobriety . In Vaughan 's case , this lifestyle would continue through further tours in the following four years , prior to his death in a helicopter accident in August 1990 .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of hired?\n\nOptions: (A) abi\n(B) aew\n(C) aam\n(D) adn"

            "content": "Document: The Iraq War was a protracted armed conflict that began in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition that overthrew the government of Saddam Hussein . The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency <event> emerged </event> to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government . An estimated 151,000 to 600,000 or more Iraqis were killed in the first three to four years of conflict . In 2009 , official US troops were withdrawn , but American soldiers continued to remain on the ground fighting in Iraq , hired by defence contractors and private military companies . The U.S. became re-involved in 2014 at the head of a new coalition ; the insurgency and many dimensions of the civil armed conflict continue . The invasion occurred as part of a declared war against international terrorism and its sponsors under the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush following the September 11 terrorist attacks . In October 2002 , Congress authorized President Bush to use military force against Iraq should he choose to . The Iraq War began on 19 March 2003 , when the U.S. , joined by the U.K. and several coalition allies , launched a `` shock and awe '' bombing campaign . Iraqi forces were quickly overwhelmed as U.S.-led forces swept through the country . The invasion led to the collapse of the Ba'athist government ; Saddam was captured during Operation Red Dawn in December of that same year and executed by a military court three years later . However , the power vacuum following Saddam 's demise and the mismanagement of the occupation led to widespread sectarian violence between Shias and Sunnis , as well as a lengthy insurgency against U.S. and coalition forces . Many violent insurgent groups were supported by Iran and al-Qaeda in Iraq . The United States responded with a troop surge in 2007 , a build up of 170,000 troops . The surge in troops gave greater security to Iraq 's government and military , and was largely a success . The winding down of U.S. involvement in Iraq accelerated under President Barack Obama . The U.S. formally withdrew all combat troops from Iraq by December 2011 . The Bush administration based its rationale for the war principally on the assertion that Iraq , which had been viewed by the U.S. as a rogue state since the 1990\u20131991 Gulf War , supposedly possessed an active weapons of mass destruction ( WMDs ) program , and that the Iraqi government posed a threat to the United States and its coalition allies . Some U.S. officials falsely accused Saddam of harbouring and supporting al-Qaeda , while others cited the desire to end a repressive dictatorship and bring democracy to the people of Iraq . in 2004 , the 9/11 commission said there was no evidence of an operational relationship between the saddam hussein regime and al-qaeda . No stockpiles of WMDs or an active WMD program were ever found in Iraq . Bush administration officials made numerous assertions about a purported Saddam-Al-Qaeda relationship and WMDs that were based on sketchy evidence , and which intelligence officials pushed back on . The rationale of U.S. pre-war intelligence faced heavy criticism both domestically and internationally . The Chilcot Report , a British inquiry into its decision to go to war , was published in 2016 and concluded military action may have been necessary but was not the last resort at the time and that the consequences of invasion were underestimated . In the aftermath of the invasion , Iraq held multi-party elections in 2005 . Nouri al-Maliki became Prime Minister in 2006 and remained in office until 2014 . The al-Maliki government enacted policies that were widely seen as having the effect of alienating the country 's Sunni minority and worsening sectarian tensions . In the summer of 2014 , the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) launched a military offensive in northern Iraq and declared a worldwide Islamic caliphate , eliciting another military response from the United States and its allies . The Iraq War caused over a hundred thousand civilian deaths and tens of thousands of military deaths ( see estimates below ) . The majority of deaths occurred as a result of the insurgency and civil conflicts between 2004 and 2007 . Subsequently , the Iraqi Civil War , which was largely considered a domino effect of the invasion , propelled at least 29,000 civilian deaths in addition to the displacement of five million people within the country .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of emerged?\n\nOptions: (A) agk\n(B) aaf\n(C) acs\n(D) adt"

The major theatres of operations were the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden in Southern Manchuria and the seas around Korea , Japan and the Yellow Sea . Russia sought a warm-water port on the Pacific Ocean for its navy and for maritime trade . Vladivostok was operational only during the summer , whereas Port Arthur , a naval base in Liaodong Province leased to Russia by China , was operational all year . since the end of the first sino-japanese war in 1895 , japan feared russian encroachment on its plans to create a sphere of influence in korea and manchuria .

Russia <event> refused </event> and demanded Korea north of the 39th parallel to be a neutral buffer zone between Russia and Japan . The Japanese government perceived a Russian threat to their plans for expansion into Asia and chose to go to war . After negotiations broke down in 1904 , the Japanese Navy opened hostilities by attacking the Russian Eastern Fleet at Port Arthur , China , in a surprise attack . Russia suffered multiple defeats by Japan , but Tsar Nicholas II was convinced that Russia would win and chose to remain engaged in the war ; at first , to await the outcomes of certain naval battles , and later to preserve the dignity of Russia by averting a `` humiliating peace '' . Russia ignored Japan 's willingness early on to agree to an armistice and rejected the idea to bring the dispute to the Arbitration Court at The Hague . the war concluded with the treaty of portsmouth , mediated by us president theodore roosevelt .

            "content": "Document: The Battle of Largs ( 2 October 1263 ) was an indecisive engagement between the kingdoms of Norway and Scotland , on the Firth of Clyde near Largs , Scotland . The conflict formed part of the Norwegian expedition against Scotland in 1263 , in which Haakon Haakonsson , King of Norway attempted to reassert Norwegian sovereignty over the western seaboard of Scotland . since the beginning of the 12th century this region had lain within the norwegian realm , ruled by magnates who recognised the overlordship of the kings of norway . In the mid-13th century , two Scottish kings , Alexander II and his son Alexander III , attempted to incorporate the region into their own realm . Following failed attempts to purchase the islands from the Norwegian king , the Scots launched military operations . Haakon <event> responded </event> to the Scottish aggression by leading a massive fleet from Norway , which reached the Hebrides in the summer of 1263 . By the end of September , Haakon 's fleet occupied the Firth of Clyde , and when negotiations between the kingdoms broke down , he brought the bulk of his fleet to anchor off the Cumbraes . On the night of 1 September , during a bout of stormy weather , several Norwegian vessels were driven aground on the Ayrshire coast , near present-day Largs . On 2 October , while the Norwegians were salvaging their vessels , the main Scottish army arrived on the scene . Composed of infantry and cavalry , the Scottish force was commanded by Alexander of Dundonald , Steward of Scotland . The Norwegians were gathered in two groups : the larger main force on the beach and a small contingent atop a nearby mound . The advance of the Scots threatened to divide the Norwegian forces , so the contingent on the mound ran to rejoin their comrades on the beach below . Seeing them running from the mound , the Norwegians on the beach believed they were retreating , and fled back towards the ships . There was fierce fighting on the beach , and the Scots took up a position on the mound formerly held by the Norwegians . Late in the day , after several hours of skirmishing , the Norwegians recaptured the mound . The Scots withdrew from the scene and the Norwegians reboarded their ships . They returned the next morning to collect their dead . With the weather deteriorating , Haakon 's fleet sailed to Orkney to overwinter . The battle of Largs has been romanticised by later historians as a great Scottish victory , but it only involved a small part of the Norwegian fleet . With his fleet and forces intact , Haakon planned to continue to campaign after spending the winter in Orkney , but he was unexpectedly taken ill and died there . with haakon 's death , his successor , magnus unk , king of norway , signed the treaty of perth three years after the battle , leasing scotland 's western seaboard to alexander iii in return for a yearly payment . This lease became permanent , but the Kingdom of Scotland eventually stopped paying the Norwegian crown for the islands when Norway became distracted by civil wars . although the battle of largs was apparently not considered a significant event by contemporaries , later historians transformed it into an event of international importance . Today , most scholars no longer subscribe to such a view , and instead accord it just an important place in the failed Norwegian campaign . The battle is commemorated in Largs by an early 20th-century monument , and festivities held there annually since the 1980s .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of responded?\n\nOptions: (A) adw\n(B) aez\n(C) aen\n(D) aag"

Their father , Caliph Harun al-Rashid , had <event> named </event> al-Amin as the first successor , but had also named al-Ma'mun as the second , with Khurasan granted to him as an appanage . Later a third son , al-Qasim , had been designated as third successor . After Harun died in 809 , al-Amin succeeded him in Baghdad . Encouraged by the Baghdad court , al-Amin began trying to subvert the autonomous status of Khurasan , and al-Qasim was quickly sidelined . In response , al-Ma'mun sought the support of the provincial \u00e9lites of Khurasan and made moves to assert his own autonomy . As the rift between the two brothers and their respective camps widened , al-Amin declared his own son Musa as his heir and assembled a large army . In 811 , al-Amin 's troops marched against Khurasan , but al-Ma'mun 's general Tahir ibn Husayn defeated them in the Battle of Rayy , and then invaded Iraq and besieged Baghdad itself . The city fell after a year , al-Amin was executed , and al-Ma'mun became Caliph . Al-Ma'mun chose to remain in Khurasan , however , rather than coming to the capital . This allowed the power vacuum which the civil war had fostered in the Caliphate 's provinces to grow , and several local rulers sprang up in Jazira , Syria and Egypt . In addition , the pro-Khurasani policies followed by al-Ma'mun 's powerful chief minister , al-Fadl ibn Sahl , and al-Ma'mun 's espousal of an Alid succession in the person of Ali al-Ridha , alienated the traditional Baghdad \u00e9lites , who saw themselves increasingly marginalized . Consequently , al-Ma'mun 's uncle Ibrahim was proclaimed rival Caliph at Baghdad in 817 , forcing al-Ma'mun to intervene personally . Fadl ibn Sahl was assassinated and al-Ma'mun left Khurasan for Baghdad , which he entered in 819 . The next years saw the consolidation of al-Ma'mun 's authority and the re-incorporation of the western provinces against local rebels , a process not completed until the pacification of Egypt in 827 . Some local rebellions , however , notably that of the Khurramites , dragged on for far longer into the 830s . Historians have interpreted the conflict variously ; in the words of the Iranologist Elton L. Daniel , it has been regard as `` a conflict over the succession between a rather incompetent , besotted al-Amin and his shrewdly competent brother al-Ma'mun ; as the product of harem intrigues ; as an extension of the personal rivalry between the ministers al-Fadl b. Rabi ' and al-Fadl b. Sahl ; or as a struggle between Arabs and Persians for the control of the government '' .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of named?\n\nOptions: (A) abl\n(B) abc\n(C) acg\n(D) aad"

            "content": "Document: The Battle of Chancellorsville was a major battle of the American Civil War ( 1861\u20131865 ) , and the principal engagement of the Chancellorsville campaign . It was fought from April 30 to May 6 , 1863 , in Spotsylvania County , Virginia , near the village of Chancellorsville . Two related battles were fought nearby on May 3 in the vicinity of Fredericksburg . The campaign pitted Union Army Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker 's Army of the Potomac against an army less than half its size , General Robert E. Lee 's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia . Chancellorsville is known as Lee 's `` perfect battle '' because his risky decision to divide his army in the presence of a much larger enemy force resulted in a significant Confederate victory . The victory , a product of Lee 's audacity and Hooker 's timid decision-making , was tempered by heavy casualties , including Lt. Gen. Thomas J . `` Stonewall '' Jackson . Jackson was hit by friendly fire , requiring his left arm to be amputated . He died of pneumonia eight days later , a loss that Lee likened to losing his right arm . Lee 's difficulty in replacing his lost men as well as his inability to prevent the Union <event> withdrawal </event> effectively have led to his great victory being regarded as a Pyrrhic one . The Chancellorsville campaign began with the crossing of the Rappahannock River by the Union army on the morning of April 27 , 1863 . Union cavalry under Maj. Gen. George Stoneman began a long-distance raid against Lee 's supply lines at about the same time . This operation was completely ineffectual . Crossing the Rapidan River via Germanna and Ely 's Fords , the Federal infantry concentrated near Chancellorsville on April 30 . Combined with the Union force facing Fredericksburg , Hooker planned a double envelopment , attacking Lee from both his front and rear . On May 1 , Hooker advanced from Chancellorsville toward Lee , but the Confederate general split his army in the face of superior numbers , leaving a small force at Fredericksburg to deter Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick from advancing , while he attacked Hooker 's advance with about four-fifths of his army . Despite the objections of his subordinates , Hooker withdrew his men to the defensive lines around Chancellorsville , ceding the initiative to Lee . On May 2 , Lee divided his army again , sending Stonewall Jackson 's entire corps on a flanking march that routed the Union XI Corps . While performing a personal reconnaissance in advance of his line , Jackson was wounded by fire after dark from his own men close between the lines , and cavalry commander Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart temporarily replaced him as corps commander . The fiercest fighting of the battle\u2014and the second bloodiest day of the Civil War\u2014occurred on May 3 as Lee launched multiple attacks against the Union position at Chancellorsville , resulting in heavy losses on both sides . That same day , Sedgwick advanced across the Rappahannock River , defeated the small Confederate force at Marye 's Heights in the Second Battle of Fredericksburg , and then moved to the west . The Confederates fought a successful delaying action at the Battle of Salem Church and by May 4 had driven back Sedgwick 's men to Banks ' Ford , surrounding them on three sides . Sedgwick withdrew across the ford early on May 5 , and Hooker withdrew the remainder of his army across U.S. Ford the night of May 5\u20136 . The campaign ended on May 7 when Stoneman 's cavalry reached Union lines east of Richmond .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of withdrawal?\n\nOptions: (A) abn\n(B) afw\n(C) ads\n(D) abq"

The sudden influx of gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy , and the sudden population increase allowed California to go rapidly to statehood , in the Compromise of 1850 . The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and resulted in a precipitous native population decline from disease , genocide and starvation . By the time it <event> ended </event> , California had gone from a thinly populated ex-Mexican territory , to having one of its first two U.S . senators , john c. UNK , selected to be the first presidential nominee for the new republican party , in 1856 . The effects of the Gold Rush were substantial . Whole indigenous societies were attacked and pushed off their lands by the gold-seekers , called `` forty-niners '' ( referring to 1849 , the peak year for Gold Rush immigration ) . Outside of California , the first to arrive were from Oregon , the Sandwich Islands ( Hawaii ) , and Latin America in late 1848 . Of the approximately 300,000 people who came to California during the Gold Rush , about half arrived by sea and half came overland on the California Trail and the Gila River trail ; forty-niners often faced substantial hardships on the trip . While most of the newly arrived were Americans , the gold rush attracted thousands from Latin America , Europe , Australia , and China . Agriculture and ranching expanded throughout the state to meet the needs of the settlers . San Francisco grew from a small settlement of about 200 residents in 1846 to a boomtown of about 36,000 by 1852 . Roads , churches , schools and other towns were built throughout California . In 1849 a state constitution was written . The new constitution was adopted by referendum vote , and the future state 's interim first governor and legislature were chosen . In September 1850 , California became a state . at the beginning of the gold rush , there was no law regarding property rights in the goldfields and a system of `` staking claims '' was developed . Prospectors retrieved the gold from streams and riverbeds using simple techniques , such as panning . although the mining caused environmental harm , more sophisticated methods of gold recovery were developed and later adopted around the world . New methods of transportation developed as steamships came into regular service . By 1869 , railroads were built from California to the eastern United States . at its peak , technological advances reached a point where significant financing was required , increasing the proportion of gold companies to individual miners . Gold worth tens of billions of today 's US dollars was recovered , which led to great wealth for a few , though many who participated in the California Gold Rush earned little more than they had started with .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of ended?\n\nOptions: (A) abb\n(B) aag\n(C) aca\n(D) abg"

            "content": "Document: Disco Demolition Night was a baseball promotion on Thursday , July 12 , 1979 , at Comiskey Park in Chicago , Illinois that ended in a riot . at the climax of the event , a crate filled with disco records was blown up on the field between games of the unk doubleheader between the chicago white sox and the detroit tigers . Many of those in attendance had come to see the explosion rather than the games and rushed onto the field after the detonation . The playing field was so damaged by the explosion and by the fans that the White Sox were required to forfeit the second game to the Tigers . In the late 1970s , dance-oriented disco music was popular in the United States , particularly after being featured in hit films such as `` Saturday Night Fever '' ( 1977 ) . Disco sparked a backlash from rock music fans . This opposition was prominent enough that the White Sox , seeking to fill seats at Comiskey Park during a lackluster season , engaged Chicago shock jock and anti-disco campaigner Steve Dahl for the promotion at the July 12 doubleheader . Dahl 's sponsoring radio station was 97.9 WLUP , so admission was discounted to 98 cents for attendees who turned in a disco record ; between games , Dahl was to destroy the collected vinyl in an explosion . White Sox officials had hoped for a crowd of 20,000 , about 5,000 more than usual . Instead , at least 50,000\u2014including tens of thousands of Dahl 's adherents\u2014packed the stadium , and thousands more continued to sneak in after gates were closed . Many of the records were not collected by staff and were thrown like flying discs from the stands . After Dahl blew up the collected records , thousands of fans stormed the field and remained there until <event> dispersed </event> by riot police . The second game was initially postponed , but forfeited by the White Sox the next day by order of American League president Lee MacPhail . Disco Demolition Night preceded , and may have helped precipitate , the decline of disco in late 1979 ; some scholars and disco artists have described the event as expressive of racism and homophobia .

            "content": "Document: In the Gulf War of 1990\u20131991 , when the Coalition intervened , they faced the world 's fourth largest air force to combat . In the opening days of the war , many air-air engagements occurred , where Iraqi interceptors would engage Coalition aircraft . This is a list of all known air-to-air engagements that occurred during the Gulf War . The first air-air kills of the war occurred when two USAF F-15Cs shot down two Iraqi MiG-29s . Later on the same night , an F-15C scored a double-kill against two Mirages with AIM-7 Sparrow missile . His wingman scored another kill on a third Mirage F1 , for a total of three kills in the dogfight . On the first night of the war , two F/A-18s from the carrier were flying outside of Baghdad when two Iraqi MiG-25PDs interceptors from the 96th Squadron engaged them . In the beyond-visual-range ( BVR ) , one of the Iraqi MiGs , piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Zuhair Dawood , <event> fired </event> an R-40 missile , shooting down one of the F/A-18 's as it was travelling Mach 0.92 . The pilot , Lieutenant Commander Scott Speicher , was killed . It is widely believed he died upon the impact of the missile . Two F/A-18s from VFA-81 shot down two Iraqi MiG-21s , one with an AIM-7 Sparrow missile and one with an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile , in a brief dogfight with their bombs still latched on . On the opening night of the war two Iraqi MiG-29s attempted to engage a flight of USAF F-15Es . One of the MiGs crashed while flying at low altitude but the other MiG pressed on . One of the F-15Es fired an AIM-9 Sidewinder when the MiG locked him up but missed . Several other F-15Es simultaneously tried to engage the lone MiG-29 but were unable to get the kill . One F-15E was actually flying past the Iraqi jet and maneuvered in for the kill but the pilot hesitated to take the shot because he was unsure of his wingmen 's location and because he did not get a good tone with the Sidewinder missile . On the first night of the war a USAF EF-111A Raven `` Spark Vark '' , flown by pilot Captain James Denton and Electronic Warfare Officer ( EWO ) Captain Brent Brandon , was on an electronic warfare mission ahead of a group of jets on a bombing run . Several IRAF Dassault Mirage F1s came in and engaged the flight . One of them went after the unarmed EF-111 . Denton executed a tight turn while Brandon launched chaff to avoid missiles fired by the Mirage . An F-15C on the same flight , piloted by Robert Graeter , went after the Mirage to protect the EF-111 . The Mirage launched a missile , spotted by Brandon , which the Raven avoided by turning and launching chaff . Denton decided to head for the deck to try to evade his pursuer . As he went down he pulled up to avoid the ground , the Mirage followed him through , but did not pull up in time and crashed . An unarmed EF-111 had thus scored an air-air victory against a Dassault Mirage F1 , although Graeter was credited with a kill . The EF-111A crew were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross . Two IRAF MiG-25s fired missiles at a group of F-15Cs escorting a bombing run in Iraq ( which were evaded by the F-15s ) . The F-15Cs gave chase , but were forced to give up when the MiGs outran them . A total of 10 missiles were fired at the MiGs . An Iraqi MiG-23 fired a R-24T missile at a F-111 on a bombing run and scored a hit , although the bomber made it safely back to base . Another similar incident occurred with the same Iraqi interceptor several minutes later , this F-111 also made it back to base despite the severe damage to the aircraft . This is Iraq 's only success of the Arab Gulf War using MiG-23s . An Iraqi MiG-29 struck an F-111 aircraft with an R60 missile , though the sturdy F-111 stayed airworthy . Several minutes later the same pilot fired a R27 missile at a B-52G on a bombing run , severely damaging it . In a brief dogfight , two F-15Cs engaged and shot down two Iraqi MiG-25s attempting to engage them , both using AIM-7 missiles . One was destroyed by Captain Rick Tuleni and the second by Captain Larry Pitts . Two F-15Cs , piloted by Captains Craig Underhill and Cesar Rodriguez gave chase to a pair of MiG-29s detected by AWACS . The Iraqi aircraft , one piloted by Captain Jameel Sayhood , promptly turned and engaged the two American fighters , and one of the most dramatic dogfights of the Arab Gulf War ensued . The two MiGs and F-15s flew straight at each other , each attempting to visually identify the other . Underhill was facing Sayhood 's wingman , while Sayhood himself was facing Rodriguez . Underhill fired an AIM-7 at Sayhood 's wingman , scoring a head-on hit and killing the opposing pilot instantly . Simultaneously , Sayhood gained a lock on Rodriguez , throwing him onto the defensive . Rodriguez dove to low altitude in order to clutter Sayhood 's radar and break the lock-on , and dropped flares to counter his adversary 's infra-red search-and-track . However , after seeing his wingman shot down , Sayhood disengaged and fled to the north . Considering the engagement over , Rodriguez and Underhill turned south to rendezvous with a KC-135 tanker in order to refuel , but Sayhood reversed course and set off after them , prompting them to reengage . With the now lone MiG-29 closing head-on with the pair of F-15s , Underhill gained radar lock-on , but did not fire due to a glitch in his IFF interrogator system keeping him from being certain he was n't about to shoot down a Coalition aircraft . Underhill initially thought he shot down an allied aircraft . Sayhood sliced into the American formation , causing a classic merge . Underhill kept Sayhood locked-on and climbed , while Rodriguez committed to the merge in order to visually identify the opposing aircraft as hostile . As they passed head-on , Rodriguez identified it as an Iraqi , and each pilot turned left to engage the other . Sayhood believed in his MiG 's better turning radius and tried to get into a firing position on Rodriguez ' tail but failed . Rodriguez outmaneuvered the Mig , managed to get firing position on him and successfully acquired a missile lock . Both aircraft lost altitude through the sustained hard turning , bringing them perilously close to the ground . Fearing that Rodriguez would obtain infra-red lock-on and shoot him down with an AIM-9 , Sayhood attempted to disengage using a split-s. Rodriguez did n't follow Sayhood 's manoeuver , and observed him eject just prior to his MiG impacting the ground - he 'd commenced his escape maneuver too low . It was reported years later by Iraqi sources that the Captain was rescued by some farmers after he broke his leg and evacuated to a local hospital . It has been claimed by some sources that an RAF Tornado ( `` ZA467 '' ) crewed by Squadron Leader Gary Lennox and Squadron Leader Adrian Weeks was shot down on 19 January by an R-60MK ( NATO reporting name : AA-8 Aphid ) missile fired from an Iraqi MiG-29 piloted by Jameel Sayhood , however this aircraft is officially recorded as having crashed on 22 January on a mission to Ar Rutbah . Two F-15Cs destroyed two Mirage F1s with AIM-7 missiles .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of fired?\n\nOptions: (A) agk\n(B) afr\n(C) aak\n(D) acx"

Seung-Hui Cho , an undergraduate student at the university and a U.S. resident of South Korean origin , shot and killed 32 people and wounded 17 others with two semi-automatic pistols . Six others were injured jumping out of windows to escape Cho . As police stormed Norris Hall , Cho committed suicide by shooting himself in the head . It is the deadliest school shooting in the history of the United States . at the time , it was the deadliest mass shooting <event> committed </event> by a lone gunman in u.s. history , until it was surpassed by the 2016 orlando nightclub shooting . The attacks received international media coverage and drew widespread criticism of U.S. gun culture . It sparked intense debate about gun violence , gun laws , gaps in the U.S. system for treating mental health issues , the perpetrator 's state of mind , the responsibility of college administrations , privacy laws , journalism ethics , and other issues . Television news organizations that aired portions of the killer 's multimedia manifesto were criticized by victims ' families , Virginia law enforcement officials , and the American Psychiatric Association . Cho had previously been diagnosed with a severe anxiety disorder . During much of his middle school and high school years , he received therapy and special education support . After graduating from high school , Cho enrolled at Virginia Tech . Because of federal privacy laws , Virginia Tech was unaware of Cho 's previous diagnosis or the accommodations he had been granted at school . In 2005 , Cho was accused of stalking two female students . After an investigation , a Virginia special justice declared Cho mentally ill and ordered him to attend treatment ; however , because he was not institutionalized , he was still allowed to purchase guns . The shooting prompted the state of Virginia to close legal loopholes that had previously allowed individuals adjudicated as mentally unsound to purchase handguns without detection by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) . It also led to passage of the only major federal gun control measure in the U.S. since 1994 . The law strengthening the NICS was signed by President George W. Bush on January 5 , 2008 . The Virginia Tech Review Panel is a state-appointed body that was assigned to review the incident . The panel criticized Virginia Tech administrators for failing to take action that might have reduced the number of casualties . The panel 's report also reviewed gun laws and pointed out gaps in mental health care as well as privacy laws that left Cho 's deteriorating condition untreated when he was a student at Virginia Tech .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of committed?\n\nOptions: (A) aaf\n(B) afx\n(C) afu\n(D) abi"

            "content": "Document: The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the No . 4 nuclear reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant , near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic . It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history and is one of only two nuclear energy disasters rated at seven\u2014the maximum severity\u2014on the International Nuclear Event Scale , the other being the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan . The accident started during a safety test on an RBMK-type nuclear reactor , which was commonly used throughout the Soviet Union . The test was a simulation of an electrical power outage to aid the development of a safety procedure for maintaining cooling water circulation until the back-up generators could provide power . This operating gap was about one minute and had been <event> identified </event> as a potential safety problem that could cause the nuclear reactor core to overheat . Three such tests had been conducted since 1982 , but had failed to provide a solution . On this fourth attempt , the test was delayed by 10 hours , so the operating shift that had been prepared was not present . The test supervisor then failed to follow procedure , creating unstable operating conditions that , combined with inherent RBMK reactor design flaws and the intentional disabling of several nuclear reactor safety systems , resulted in an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction . A large amount of energy was suddenly released , vapourising superheated cooling water and rupturing the reactor core in a highly destructive steam explosion . This was immediately followed by an open-air reactor core fire that released considerable airborne radioactive contamination for about nine days that precipitated onto parts of the USSR and western Europe , before being finally contained on 4 May 1986 . The fire gradually released about the same amount of contamination as the initial explosion . As a result of rising ambient radiation levels off-site , a radius exclusion zone was created 36 hours after the accident . About 49,000 people were evacuated from the area , primarily from Pripyat . The exclusion zone was later increased to radius when a further 68,000 people were evacuated from the wider area . To reduce the spread of radioactive contamination from the wreckage and to protect the site from further weathering , the remains of reactor No . 4 required a protective enclosure . The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus was built and finished by December 1986 , and would also provide radiological protection for the crews of the undamaged reactors at the site , with No . 3 continuing to produce electricity until 2000 . Due to the continued deterioration of the sarcophagus , both it and the No . 4 reactor were further enclosed in 2017 by the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement , a larger enclosure that allows the removal of both the sarcophagus and the reactor debris , while containing the radioactive hazard . Nuclear clean-up is scheduled for completion in 2065 . The reactor explosion killed two of the reactor operating staff . In the emergency response that followed , 134 firemen and station staff were hospitalized with acute radiation syndrome due to absorbing high doses of ionizing radiation . Of these 134 men , 28 died in the days to months afterward and approximately 14 suspected radiation-induced cancer deaths followed within the next 10 years . Among the wider population , an excess of 15 childhood thyroid cancer deaths were documented . Due to the often long incubation periods for radiation exposure to induce cancer , the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ( UNSCEAR ) has , at multiple times , reviewed all the published research on the incident and found that at present , fewer than 100 documented deaths are likely to be attributable to increased exposure to radiation . Determining the total eventual number of exposure related deaths is based on the linear no-threshold model , a contested statistical model , which has also been used in estimates of low level radon and air pollution exposure . Model predictions with the greatest confidence values of the eventual total death toll in the decades ahead from Chernobyl releases vary , from 4,000 fatalities when solely assessing the three most contaminated former Soviet states , to about 9,000 to 16,000 fatalities when assessing the total continent of Europe . The Chernobyl disaster is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history , both in terms of cost and casualties . The struggle to safeguard against hazards immediately after the accident , together with later decontamination efforts of the surroundings , ultimately involved more than 500,000 liquidators and cost an estimated 18 billion Soviet rubles\u2014roughly US $ 68 billion in 2019 , adjusted for inflation . The accident prompted safety upgrades on all remaining Soviet-designed RBMK reactors , of which 10 continue to be operational .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of identified?\n\nOptions: (A) agb\n(B) abx\n(C) aet\n(D) afu"

Two other students were hospitalized , one of whom sustained several serious injuries requiring extensive rehabilitation , and the other suffered a minor injury . The seriously injured victim has since been declared permanently paralyzed . A sixth student sustained a superficial wound . While rumors of a warning of the event having been posted on the Internet circulated , student witnesses identified the shooter as Thomas `` T . J . '' Lane III , a 17-year-old male . although police were initially hesitant to publicly identify the juvenile after he was apprehended , by the evening of february 28 , authorities confirmed that the suspect was lane . The weapon Lane used in the shooting was a .22 caliber handgun . At an initial court hearing , the prosecutor revealed that he admitted to shooting 10 rounds of ammunition from the gun during the shooting , which began in the school cafeteria at approximately 7:30 a.m. , shortly after school started . although lane told police that he did not know the victims and that they were chosen randomly , witnesses stated that it appeared he targeted a specific student and the group he was <event> sitting </event> with in the cafeteria . After the shooting occurred , Lane reportedly left the building . Witnesses stated he was chased from the building by a teacher , and was arrested a short time later outside the school . Lane was ultimately indicted on three counts of aggravated murder , two counts of aggravated attempted murder , and one count of felonious assault . He was initially detained as a juvenile pending further court action . Reaction to the event prompted a statement from Ohio Governor , John Kasich . Several prayer vigils were held and a fund for the victims was established . Thousands of people attended one of the vigils , at which the Governor spoke , the night after the attack . President Barack Obama gave his condolences to the school principal in a telephone call following the incident . Analysis of the crime and comparisons to similar attacks began immediately following the shooting . In May 2012 , a judge determined that Lane was competent to stand trial .

            "content": "Document: The Decembrist revolt or the Decembrist uprising ( ) took place in Imperial Russia on . Russian army officers led about 3,000 soldiers in a protest against Tsar Nicholas I 's assumption of the throne after his elder brother Constantine removed himself from the line of succession . Because these events occurred in December , the rebels were called the `` Decembrists '' ( `` Dekabristy '' , ) . The uprising , which was suppressed by Nicholas I , took place in Peter 's Square in Saint Petersburg . In 1925 , to mark the centenary of the event , the square was renamed Decembrist Square ; but in 2008 the name was changed back to its original name , Senate Square . Union of Salvation and Union of Prosperity . at first , many officers were encouraged by tsar alexander i 's early liberal reformation of russian society and politics . Liberalism was encouraged on an official level , creating high expectations during the period of rapprochement between Napoleon and Alexander . The major advocate for reform in Alexander 's regime was Count Mikhail Mikhailovich Speransky . During his early years in the regime , Speransky <event> helped </event> inspire the organization of the Ministry of the Interior , the reform of ecclesiastic education , and the formulation of the government 's role in the country 's economic development . Speransky 's role increased greatly in 1808 . From then until 1812 , when they feared him as a liberal similar to Napoleon invading of Russia , Speransky developed plans for the reorganization of Russia 's government . Returned from exile in 1819 Count Mikhail Mikhailovich Speransky was appointed as the Governor of Siberia , with the task of reforming local government . Equally , in 1818 the Tsar asked Count Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev to draw up a constitution . The abolition of serfdom in Baltic provinces was in 1816\u20131819 . However , internal and external unrest , which the Tsar believed stemmed from political liberalisation , led to a series of repressions and a return to a former government of restriction and conservatism . Meanwhile , spurred by their experiences of the Napoleonic Wars , and realising many of the harsh indignities through which the peasant soldiers were forced , Decembrist officers and sympathisers displayed their contempt for the `` ancien r\u00e9gime '' by rejecting court lifestyle , wearing their cavalry swords at balls ( indicating their unwillingness to dance ) , and committing themselves to academic study . This new lifestyle captured the spirit of the times , as a willingness to embrace both the peasant ( i.e. , the 'Russian way of life ' ) and ongoing reformative movements abroad . the motivations for the reformist movement are outlined , in part , by pavel pestel : historians have also noted that the united states declaration of independence and the american revolution may have influenced decembrists . The most correct name for Decembrists could be Russian Americanophiles . The Constitution written by Nikita Muravyov was essentially the translation of the US Constitution . But Decembrists were against US slavery . Any slaves and serfs from all countries were to become free in Russia immediately . Pestel and his followers were against the US federation model in peaceful times as threatening by the split of the would-be Russian/United Slavic federation and approved the US revolutionary model only . But while conceding with Pestel that the American revolutionary model of the federal government could be the best form for Russia , the Polish patriotic society could not agree not only with partaking with this federation establishment , but with the same form of government for unitarian Poland and requested for Lithuania , Belarus and Ukraine without any Russian involvement into the affairs of these territories and any Polish federalization . In 1816 , several officers of the Imperial Russian Guard founded a society known as the Union of Salvation , or of the Faithful and True Sons of the Fatherland . The society acquired a more revolutionary cast after it was joined by the idealistic Pavel Pestel , dreaming of the mass repressions against different ethnic and class groups and the total annihilation of the imperial family . The charter was similar to charters of the organizations of carbonari . Pestel was supported by Yakushkin when there were rumours that the emperor had intended to transfer the capital from Saint-Petersburg to Warsaw and to liberate all peasants without the consent of Russian landlords which could not influence the government being in Warsaw . Yakushkin was to kill the emperor even before the revolution thus . When the society consisting of Russian landlords had refused to kill an emperor because only of rumors Yakushkin left the society . More liberal Mikhail Muravyov-Vilensky created a new charter similar to that of Tugendbund and without any revolutionary plans of the society called now the Union of Prosperity though still illegal similar to masonic lodges . ( The small Ordain of Russian knights for exception of its active member Alexander von Benckendorff also joined the Union of Prosperity together with the members of the Union of Salvation . ) After a mutiny in the Semenovsky Regiment in 1820 , the society decided to suspend activity in 1821 . Two groups , however , continued to function secretly : a Southern Society , based at Tulchin , a small garrison town in Ukraine , in which Pestel was the outstanding figure , and a Northern Society , based at St Petersburg , led by Guard officers Nikita Muraviev , Prince S. P. Trubetskoy and Prince Eugene Obolensky . The political aims of the more moderate Northern Society were a British-style constitutional monarchy with a limited franchise , though it could be replaced with a republic in the future but only according to the will of the people , assuming the legislative assembly and excluding the execution of the imperial family , the abolition of serfdom according to the interests of Russian landlords , i. e. with land in the ownership of landlords mainly still similar to the abolition of serfdom in Baltic provinces , and equality before the law . The Southern Society , under Pestel 's influence , was more radical and wanted to abolish the monarchy , establish a republic , similar to the Union of Salvation , and contrary to the Union of Salvation plans , to redistribute land : taking half into state ownership and dividing the rest among the peasants . The Society of United Slavs ( also known as the Slavic Union ) was established in Novograd-Volynsky in the Ukraine in 1823 . Its never written program was similar to that of the Southern Society but the main emphasis was on the equal federation of Russia ( including Ukraine ) , Poland , Moldova ( including Bessarabia ) with the attachment of Valahia , Transilvania , Hungary ( including Slovakia , Slovenia , Voevodina , Kraina ) , Croatia , Serbia , Dalmatia , Cheske , Moravia i.e. , all Slavic countries with the exception of Bulgaria and Macedonia in the future . This society joined the Southern Society and adopted its program in exchange for the recognition of the Slavic federation zeal by the Southern society in September 1825 .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of helped?\n\nOptions: (A) acu\n(B) abb\n(C) acs\n(D) adn"

In the summer of 1806 , during the War of the Third Coalition ( of Britain , Russia , Prussia , Sweden ) , Napoleon 's ambassador General Count Sebastiani managed to convince the Porte to cancel all special privileges granted to Russia in 1805 and to open the Ottoman straits ( Dardanelles ) exclusively to French warships . In return , Napoleon promised to help the Sultan suppress a rebellion in Serbia and to recover lost Ottoman territories . When the Russian army <event> marched </event> into Moldavia and Wallachia in 1806 , the Ottomans declared war on Russia . During the Dardanelles Operation in September 1806 , Britain pressured Sultan Selim III to expel Sebastiani , declare war on France , cede the Danubian Principalities to Russia , and surrender the Ottoman fleet , together with the forts on the Dardanelles , to the Royal Navy . After Selim 's rejection of the ultimatum , a British squadron , commanded by Vice-admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth , entered the Dardanelles on 19 February 1807 and the British destroyed the Ottoman naval force in the Sea of Marmara , and anchored opposite Constantinople . But the Turks erected powerful batteries and strengthened their fortifications with the help of General Sebastiani and French engineers . The British warships were cannonaded and Duckworth was forced to sail back to the Mediterranean on 3 March 1807 . On 16 March 1807 , 5000 British troops embarked on the Alexandria expedition of 1807 and occupied Alexandria in August , although Khedive Muhammad Ali defeated them heavily and forced them to evacuate five months later after a short siege ; however , the Ottoman Empire had a little military support from France in the war with Russia .

Baimuingi , one of the last Mau Mau generals , was killed shortly after Kenya attained self-rule . The KLFA failed to capture widespread public support .

General Sir Frank Kitson , who served in the British colonial forces in Kenya , authored a book entitled `` Gangs and Counter-gangs '' in which he describes the tactic of manipulating the Mau Maus into rival gangs and pitting them against one another . The Mau Mau movement remained internally divided , despite attempts to unify the factions . the british , meanwhile , applied the strategy and tactics they developed in suppressing the malayan emergency ( unk ) .

Subsequent flooding , caused largely as a result of fatal engineering flaws in the flood protection system known as levees around the city of New Orleans , precipitated most of the loss of lives . The storm was the third major hurricane of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season , as well as the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous United States , behind only the 1935 Labor Day hurricane , Hurricane Camille in 1969 , and Hurricane Michael in 2018 . The storm originated over the Bahamas on August 23 , 2005 , from the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten . Early on the following day , the tropical depression then intensified into a tropical storm as it headed generally westward toward Florida , <event> strengthening </event> into a hurricane only two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach and Aventura on August 25 . After very briefly weakening again to a tropical storm , Katrina emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and began to rapidly intensify . The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico but weakened before making its second landfall as a Category 3 hurricane on August 29 , over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi . As Katrina made landfall , its front right quadrant , which held the strongest winds , slammed into Gulfport , Mississippi , devastating it . Katrina caused extensive destruction and casualties : overall , at least 1,836 people died in the hurricane and subsequent floods , making Katrina the deadliest United States hurricane since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane . Severe property damage occurred in numerous coastal areas , such as Mississippi beachfront towns where boats and casino barges rammed buildings , pushing cars and houses inland ; water reached from the beach . The total property damage was estimated at $ 125 billion ( 2005 USD ) , roughly four times the damage wrought by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 , tying Katrina with Hurricane Harvey of 2017 as the costliest Atlantic tropical cyclone on record . over fifty breaches in surge protection levees surrounding the city of new orleans , louisiana was the cause of the majority of the death and destruction during katrina . Eventually , 80 % of the city , as well as large tracts of neighboring parishes , became flooded , and the floodwaters lingered for weeks . Most of the transportation and communication networks servicing New Orleans were damaged or disabled by the flooding , and tens of thousands of people who had not evacuated the city prior to landfall became stranded with little access to food , shelter or basic necessities . The scale of the disaster in New Orleans provoked massive national and international response efforts ; federal , local and private rescue operations evacuated displaced persons out of the city over the following weeks . multiple investigations in the aftermath of the storm concluded that the u.s. army corps of engineers , which had designed and built the region 's levees decades earlier , was responsible for the failure of the flood-control systems , though federal courts later ruled that the corps could not be held financially liable because of sovereign immunity in the flood control act of 1928 . there were also widespread criticisms and investigations of the emergency responses from federal , state and local governments , which resulted in the resignations of federal emergency management agency ( fema ) director michael d. brown and new orleans police department ( nopd ) superintendent eddie compass . Many other government officials were criticized for their responses , especially New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin , Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco , and President George W. Bush . several agencies including the united states coast guard ( uscg ) , national hurricane center ( nhc ) and national weather service ( nws ) were commended for their actions .

            "content": "Document: On 12 June 2014 , three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped at the bus/hitchhiking stop at the Israeli settlement of Alon Shvut in Gush Etzion , in the West Bank , as they were hitchhiking to their homes . The three teens were Naftali Frenkel ( 16 , from Nof Ayalon ) , Gilad Shaer ( 16 , from Talmon ) , and Eyal Yifrah ( 19 , from Elad ) . Gilad Shaer called a police emergency hotline to report the kidnapping . The emergency call recording , initially under a gag order , was leaked to the public . After Shaer 's whispered message `` They <event> kidnapped </event> me '' , the taped call also recorded shouting in Arabic from the kidnappers and several volleys of automatic gunfire . Within days , Israeli investigators , though lacking conclusive proof , strongly suspected the teenagers had been killed , and , if so , knew where the victims ' bodies would probably have been dumped . the israel defense forces initiated operation brother 's keeper ( , `` unk unk unk '' ) in search of the three teenagers . As part of the operation , in the following 11 days Israel arrested around 350 Palestinians , including nearly all of Hamas ' West Bank leaders . Five Palestinians were killed during the military operation . On 15 June , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the teens had been kidnapped by Hamas , which Hamas denied . Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas maintained that as of 22 June there was no evidence that Hamas was behind the kidnapping . On 25 July , BBC correspondent Jon Donnison tweeted that Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld stated that the kidnappings did not occur on the orders of , or with the knowledge of the Hamas leadership , and that the crime was the action of a `` lone cell '' . Sheera Frenkel had reported similar views from Israel and Palestinian sources some ten days earlier . Rosenfeld later denied having used the words `` lone cell '' . On 5 August , Israel said that it had arrested Hussam Qawasmeh , a cousin of Marwan Qawasmeh , on 11 July , who is suspected of having organized the killing of the three teenagers . According to court documents , Qawasmeh stated that Hamas members in Gaza financed the recruitment and arming of the killers . Hussam Qawasmeh 's lawyers stated that he confessed under `` heavy torture '' from Israeli security services , Shin Bet . Qawasmeh 's lawyer stated `` What he said during interrogation was that he was responsible for ordering the kidnapping '' , and that `` [ t ] he orders came from him personally . '' On 26 June , the Israel Security Agency released the identities of two Hamas suspects in the kidnapping . Both ISA and Palestinian authorities said that the two men have been missing since the night of the kidnapping , and the ISA stated that both had engaged in terrorism , been arrested , and served time in the past , and were considered suspects immediately after the kidnapping . A senior Palestinian intelligence official said off the record that their disappearance constituted clear evidence the two suspects have links with the abduction . On 30 June , search teams found the bodies of the three missing teenagers in a field north-west of Hebron . They had apparently been shot dead shortly after the abduction . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a tough response to the killings . On 20 August 2014 , a Hamas official Salah al-Arouri , who had been publicly identified as the mastermind of the operation several days after the kidnapping , on 19 June , said that the organization 's armed wing , the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades , was behind the kidnapping and murder . The Shin Bet had been investigating him in the belief that he ran a major Hamas network in the West Bank , headed by Riad Nasser of Deir Qadis , near Ramallah , and that he was behind the kidnapping . Following this line of investigation may have delayed the capture of Hussam al-Qarasme , who was only arrested on 10 July . al-Arouri , one of the founders of Hamas 's military wing , made his comments at a conference in Istanbul , where he lives in exile . the israeli defense establishment thinks that unk is unconnected with the kidnapping , and was boasting . Hamas leader Khaled Mashal said that some Hamas members had kidnapped and murdered the Israeli teens but stated that they were not acting on orders from the Hamas leadership , which he said , were `` not aware of this action taken by this group of Hamas members in advance '' and the first he heard about it was through the Israeli investigation into the events . Meshaal , who has headed Hamas ' exiled political wing since 2004 , has denied being involved in the `` details '' of Hamas `` military issues '' . He praised the kidnappers hoping the action could lead to the release of Palestinian prisoners . According to J.J. Goldberg , the military indictment contains no evidence of orders from Hamas itself and strengthens the thesis that the incident was organized by the Qawasmeh family alone from start to finish . According to Amos Harel and Chaim Levinson , the kidnappers planned to wait a few days , then contact senior Hamas operatives in the Hebron area , to manage the hostage and negotiate a prisoner swap with Israel . In their view it appears doubtful that any senior Hamas official would have been ready to accept that kind of risk . On 23 September 2014 , after Israel killed the two suspects , Marwan Qawasmeh and Amar Abu-Isa ( aka Amer Abu Aysha ) in a shootout , IDF Chief Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz announced that Operation Brother 's Keeper `` has come to an end . '' On 6 January 2015 , Hussam Qawasmeh , a member of Hamas , was jailed and sentenced to three life terms in prison for the murders . He must also pay $ 63,000 in compensation to the victims ' families .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of kidnapped?\n\nOptions: (A) aaf\n(B) aan\n(C) adn\n(D) acq"

In Scotland itself , from 1644\u201345 a Scottish civil war was fought between Scottish Royalists\u2014supporters of Charles I under James Graham , 1st Marquis of Montrose\u2014and the Covenanters , who had controlled Scotland since 1639 and <event> allied </event> with the English Parliament . The Scottish Royalists , aided by Irish troops , had a rapid series of victories in 1644\u201345 , but were eventually defeated by the Covenanters . The Covenanters then found themselves at odds with the English Parliament , so they crowned Charles II at Scone and thus stated their intention to place him on the thrones of England and Ireland as well . This led to the Third English Civil War , when Scotland was invaded and occupied by the Parliamentarian New Model Army under Oliver Cromwell . Origins of the war \u2014 wars in three kingdoms . Scotland had helped to spark this series of wars in 1638 , when it had risen in revolt against Charles I 's religious policies . the national covenant of scotland was formulated to resist the king 's innovations , particularly the prayer book . in practice , the covenant also expressed a wider scottish dissatisfaction with charles 's policies , especially the sidelining of scotland since the stuart kings had also become monarchs of england in 1603 . The Covenanters raised a large army from the dependants of their landed class and successfully resisted Charles I 's attempt to impose his will on Scotland in the so-called Bishops Wars . The Scottish uprising triggered civil war in Charles ' other two Kingdoms , first in Ireland , then in England . Charles and his minister Thomas Wentworth were unable to persuade the English Parliament , which itself was unhappy with Charles 's civil and religious policies , to pay for an army to put down the Scots . As a result , they had proposed raising an army from Irish Catholics , in return for abolishing discriminatory laws against them . This prospect alarmed Charles ' enemies in England and Scotland and the Covenanters threatened to invade Ireland . In response a group of Irish conspirators launched the Irish Rebellion of 1641 , which quickly degenerated into a series of massacres of English and Scottish Protestant settlers in Ireland . This in turn sparked civil war in England , because the Long Parliament did not trust Charles with command of an army to put down the Irish rebellion , fearing that it would also be used against them . The English Civil War broke out in 1642 . The Covenanters sent an army to Ulster in Ireland in 1642 to protect the Scottish settlers there . in 1644 , following the signing of a treaty UNK the solemn league and covenant UNK with the english parliament , the bulk of the covenanters ' armed forces were sent south to fight on the parliamentarian side in the english civil war .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of allied?\n\nOptions: (A) abp\n(B) adr\n(C) afg\n(D) abg"

The incident took place admidst the East Indies campaign of the French Revolutionary Wars repeated French attempts to disrupt the highly valuable British trade routes with British India and Qing Dynasty China . In 1796 , a large squadron of French frigates arrived in the Indian Ocean under the command of Contre-amiral Pierre C\u00e9sar Charles de Sercey . In July this force sailed on a commerce raiding cruise off British Ceylon , but a subsequent attack into the Straits of Malacca was driven off in an inconclusive engagement with two British ships of the line off Northeastern Sumatra .

The incident became known as the Rothbury affair or the Rothbury riot , and is described as the `` bloodiest event in national industrial history . '' In 1929 colliery owners on the Northern New South Wales coalfields <event> combined </event> as the Northern Collieries Association . On Thursday 14 February 1929 the mine employers gave their 9,750 employees 14 days ' notice , that they ( the miners ) should accept the following new conditions : A wage reduction of 12\u00bd per cent on the contract rates , one shilling ( $ 0.10 ) a day on the `` day wage '' rate ; all Lodges must give the colliery managers the right to hire and fire without regard to seniority ; all Lodges must agree to discontinue pit-top meetings and pit stoppages . The miners refused to accept these terms , and on Saturday 2 March 1929 , all miners were `` locked out '' of their employment . in september 1929 , the nsw state parliament introduced an `` unlawful assembly act '' designed to suppress the miners , which authorised police to break up any gatherings . On 16 December 1929 about 5,000 miners demonstrated against the introduction of non-union labour into the Rothbury mine by the conservative Bavin government , which had taken over the colliery . The government called in 70 New South Wales police officers from districts outside Newcastle to protect the colliery and allow the entry of non-union labour . Angry miners marched to the mine gate led by a pipe band . When they charged the gate bearing clubs and firearms , the miners were met with defensive baton blows by the police and there were hand-to-hand clashes . Three shots had been fired at the police and the order to draw their revolvers and fire a volley of shots over the heads of the rioters and then into the ground . One miner , Norman Brown , received a fatal wound from a ricocheting bullet . The youngest miner was 15-year-old Joseph Cummings , who risked his life , dodging bullets as he ran for the doctor , in a futile effort to help save Brown 's life . the `` sydney daily telegraph pictorial '' described the event as `` the most dramatic industrial clash that has ever shocked australia . '' In June 1930 , after fifteen months of living in poverty and starvation , the miners capitulated and returned to work on reduced contract wages . However , the lockout failed to break the resolve or organisation of the miners union . The Rothbury mine finally closed in 1974 . A monument in honour of Norman Brown is located at North Rothbury . The site is now a railway workshop , restoring locomotives and rollingstock used on railways in the local coalfields .

The Bohemian forces were led by King Ottokar II P\u0159emysl , while the Hungarians were led by King B\u00e9la IV . In 1251 Ottokar 's father King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia had not only granted him the title of a Margrave of Moravia but also installed him as duke of Austria and Styria , territories that were princeless after the ruling Babenberg dynasty had become extinct in 1246 . To legitimate his succession , Ottokar in 1252 married the Duchess Margaret of Austria , the sister of the last Babenberg duke and about 26 years his senior . When Ottokar followed his father as King of Bohemia in 1253 , B\u00e9la , distrustful of his rising power , claimed the Styrian duchy . Meanwhile , Margaret 's niece Gertrude had married Roman Danylovich , son of King Daniel of Galicia and relative of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty . The quarrels were at first settled with the aid of Pope Innocent IV in 1254 , when B\u00e9la received large parts of Styria and later installed his son Stephen as a duke . However , in 1260 the conflict rekindled , after the Styrian nobility had revolted against the \u00c1rp\u00e1ds and Ottokar <event> campaigned </event> the duchy . B\u00e9la allied with Daniel of Galicia and Boles\u0142aw V the Chaste of Poland and marched against Ottokar . Kingdom of Hungary could n't recover from the devastation of Mongol invasion of 1240 and 1241 , therefore it lost much of its former political and military positions . Historians estimate that up to half of Hungary 's then population of 2,000,000 were victims of the Mongol invasion Ottokar 's troops consisted of Bohemian-Moravian , German , Polish , Carinthian , Carniolan and Styrian forces , while Bela 's huge army gathered Hungarian , Slovak , Cuman , Russian , Polish , Bulgarian , Wallachian , Ukrainian ( Galician ) , Slavonian , Croatian , Bosnian , Serbian , Pecheneg and Szekler contingents . Both sides met on different sides of the Morava River , where they eyed each other for some time . As none of the belligerents dared to cross the river , Ottokar proposed an agreement , that his troops would withdraw to give the Hungarians the opportunity to go reach the other bank . As they pulled back , B\u00e9la 's son Stephen started an attack , went over the Morava and reached the retiring Bohemian cavalry at the village of Kressenbrunn . However Ottokar called back his forces and managed to repulse Stephen who was seriously injured . The returning Bohemian forces routed B\u00e9la 's troops , many of which on the run drowned in the river . The fight is considered as one of the biggest battles in Central Europe in the Middle Ages ever , though scholars doubt the possibility of supplying such a vast number of mercenaries . After Ottokar 's victory King B\u00e9la renounced the Duchy of Styria and in 1261 even arranged the marriage of his granddaughter Kunigunda of Slavonia with the Bohemian king . However his successors continued to challenge the Bohemian kingdom .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of campaigned?\n\nOptions: (A) ace\n(B) afx\n(C) adu\n(D) aeu"

The festival originally sought to provide black people an opportunity to build community within the predominantly white punk subculture and to provide a stage for black alternative performers that were not acknowledged in the mainstream and stood outside hip hop , R & B , soul , etc . To attract a wider audience , the festival shifted to include soul music and hip hop , which expanded its target demographic , attracting headliners including Ice Cube , Lauryn Hill , Lenny Kravitz , and Gary Clark , Jr..

The bombardment killed 1,297 French servicemen , sank a battleship and <event> damaged </event> five ships , for a British loss of five aircraft shot down and two crewmen killed . The attack by air-and-sea was conducted by the Royal Navy after France had signed armistices with Germany and Italy that came into effect on 25 June . Of particular significance to the British were the five battleships of the `` Bretagne '' and `` Richelieu '' classes , and the two fast battleships of the Dunkerque class , the second largest force of capital ships in Europe after the Royal Navy . The British War Cabinet feared that France would hand the ships to the German Navy ( `` Kriegsmarine '' ) , giving the Axis assistance in the Battle of the Atlantic or Battle of the Mediterranean . Admiral Fran\u00e7ois Darlan , commander of the French Navy , promised the British that the fleet would remain under French control but Winston Churchill and the War Cabinet judged that the fleet was too powerful to risk an Axis take-over .

Bell wrote that `` The times were desperate ; invasion seemed imminent ; and the British government simply could not afford to risk the Germans seizing control of the French fleet ... The predominant British motive was thus dire necessity and self-preservation '' . The French thought they were acting honourably in terms of their armistice with Nazi Germany and were convinced they would never turn over their fleet to Germany . On 10 July , Marshal P\u00e9tain was installed as leader of the new French State . French grievances festered for years over what they considered a betrayal by their former ally . On 27 November 1942 , after Operation Torch , the Allied invasion of Morocco and French Algeria had begun , the French navy foiled a German attempt to capture the rest of the French fleet ( Operation Anton ) by scuttling their ships in Toulon Harbour .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of damaged?\n\nOptions: (A) abf\n(B) aag\n(C) aet\n(D) acw"

Approximately two million people joined their hands to form a human chain spanning across the three Baltic states \u2013 Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania , which were considered at the time to be constituent republics of the Soviet Union . The demonstration originated in `` Black Ribbon Day '' protests held in the western cities in the 1980s . It marked the 50th anniversary of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany . The pact and its secret protocols divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence and led to the occupation of the Baltic states in 1940 . The event was organised by Baltic pro-independence movements : Rahvarinne of Estonia , the Tautas fronte of Latvia , and S\u0105j\u016bdis of Lithuania . The protest was designed to draw global attention by <event> demonstrating </event> a popular desire for independence for each of the entities . It also illustrated solidarity among the three nations . It has been described as an effective publicity campaign , and an emotionally captivating and visually stunning scene . The event presented an opportunity for the Baltic activists to publicise the Soviet rule and position the question of Baltic independence not only as a political matter , but also as a moral issue . The Soviet authorities responded to the event with intense rhetoric , but failed to take any constructive actions that could bridge the widening gap between the Baltic republics and the rest of the Soviet Union . Within seven months of the protest , Lithuania became the first of the Soviet republics to declare independence . After the Revolutions of 1989 , 23 August has become an official remembrance day both in the Baltic countries , in the European Union and in other countries , known as the Black Ribbon Day or as the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of demonstrating?\n\nOptions: (A) aev\n(B) abw\n(C) adm\n(D) aat"

It was a three-way war fought between : The war was instigated by Philip of Spain to keep his enemy , France , from interfering with the Spanish army in the Netherlands and his planned invasion of England . The war began when the Catholic League convinced King Henry III to issue an edict outlawing Protestantism and annulling Henry of Navarre 's right to the throne ; Henry III was possibly influenced by the royal favorite , Anne de Joyeuse . For the first part of the war , the royalists and the Catholic League were uneasy allies against their common enemy , the Huguenots . Henry <event> sent </event> Joyeuse into the field against Navarre , while he himself intended to meet the approaching German and Swiss armies . at the battle of unk , navarre defeated the royal army led by joyeuse ; the duke himself was slain at the battle . It was the first victory won by the Huguenots in the battlefield . For his part , Henry III successfully prevented the junction of the German and Swiss armies . The Swiss were his allies , and had come to invade France to free him from subjection ; but Henry III insisted that their invasion was not in his favor , but against him , forcing them to return home . The Germans , led by Fabien I , Burgrave of Dohna , wanted to fight against the Duke of Guise , in order to win a victory like Coutras . He recruited some of the retreating Swiss , who had no scruple fighting against Guise . But at the Battle of Vimory , Guise took the Germans by surprise , and routed them . In Paris , the glory of repelling the German and Swiss Protestants all fell to the Duke of Guise . The king 's actions were viewed with contempt . They thought that the king had invited the Swiss to invade , paid them for coming , and sent them back again . The king , who had really performed the decisive part in the campaign , and expected to be honored for it , was astounded that public voice should thus declare against him . The Catholic League had put its preachers to good use . In the meantime , the governments of Normandy and Picardy were vacated by the deaths of Joyeuse and Cond\u00e9 . Guise demanded Normandy for himself , and Picardy for his kinsman Aumale . The king denied both requests . The Catholic League was mobilized to resist the royal appointees in these provinces . Guise was forbidden from entering the capital . Guise ignored the prohibition and entered Paris . In the normal course of affairs this would have cost him his life , but the duke was popular with the masses . Further , after the Day of the Barricades , an uprising planned in part by the Spanish diplomat Bernardino de Mendoza , the king decided to flee to Blois . After the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 , the king called the Estates-General in the midst of intrigue and plotting . Henry of Guise planned to assassinate the king and seize the throne , but the king struck first by having Guise killed by his guards , The Forty-Five . Open war erupted between the royalists and the Catholic League . Charles , Duke of Mayenne , Guise 's younger brother , took over the leadership of the League . At the moment it seemed that he could not possibly resist his enemies . His power was effectively limited to Blois , Tours , and the surrounding districts . In these dark times the King of France finally reached out to his cousin and heir , the King of Navarre . Henry III declared that he would no longer allow Protestants to be called heretics , while the Protestants revived the strict principles of royalty and divine right . As on the other side ultra-Catholic and anti-royalist doctrines were closely associated , so on the side of the two kings the principles of tolerance and royalism were united . Henry III sought the aid of the Swiss , who were ready to join his cause . The Catholic royalists revived in their allegiance . at pontoise the king saw himself at the head of 40,000 men . His newly recovered power may have inspired him with great designs ; he planned to take Paris , in order to end the League 's power once and for all . The surrender of Paris seemed likely , even to the inhabitants . The preachers of the League sanctioned regicide , to avenge the murder of Guise . Jacques Cl\u00e9ment , a fanatical Catholic monk , assassinated King Henry III at Saint-Cloud in August 1589 . With Henry III 's death , the coalition broke up . Many Catholic royalists were unwilling to serve the Protestant Henry IV , and the army retreated from Paris .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of sent?\n\nOptions: (A) abv\n(B) aax\n(C) afi\n(D) afp"

The French squadron comprised six frigates engaged on a commerce raiding operation against British trade routes passing through captured parts of the Dutch East Indies , and posed a considerable threat to the weakened British naval forces in the region . The British force consisted of two 74-gun ships of the line hastily paired to oppose the eastward advance of the French squadron .

Their movements had so far been unopposed as British forces in the East Indies were concentrated at Simon 's Town in the west and Malacca in the east . After raiding the shipping at Banda Aceh on 1 September the squadron sailed eastwards to attack Penang . On 8 September , while the French were removing supplies from a captured British merchant ship east of Banda Aceh , two large sails were spotted . These were HMS `` Arrogant '' and HMS `` Victorious '' , sent to drive off the French before they could attack the scattered British shipping and ports in the region . although the british ships were substantially larger than any individual french vessel , the frigates were more numerous and more manoeuvrable . Neither side could afford to take significant damage in the battle , so each sought to drive the other off rather than achieve an outright victory . On 9 September Sercey 's frigates formed a line of battle , successfully engaging first `` Arrogant '' and then `` Victorious '' and inflicting damage on each while preventing them from supporting one another . The French frigates , particularly `` Vertu '' and `` Seine '' , also suffered and by late morning both sides disengaged , the British retiring to Madras for repairs while Sercey anchored at King 's Island in the Mergui Archipelago , eventually sheltering in Batavia .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of cruising?\n\nOptions: (A) aey\n(B) agh\n(C) adv\n(D) aez"

The name `` Kristallnacht '' ( `` Crystal Night '' ) comes from the shards of broken glass that littered the streets after the windows of Jewish-owned stores , buildings and synagogues were smashed . Jewish homes , hospitals and schools were <event> ransacked </event> as the attackers demolished buildings with sledgehammers . The rioters destroyed 267 synagogues throughout Germany , Austria and the Sudetenland . over 7,000 jewish businesses were damaged or destroyed , and 30,000 jewish men were arrested and incarcerated in concentration camps . British historian Martin Gilbert wrote that no event in the history of German Jews between 1933 and 1945 was so widely reported as it was happening , and the accounts from foreign journalists working in Germany sent shockwaves around the world . `` The Times '' of London observed on 11 November 1938 : `` No foreign propagandist bent upon blackening Germany before the world could outdo the tale of burnings and beatings , of blackguardly assaults on defenseless and innocent people , which disgraced that country yesterday . '' The pretext for the attacks was the assassination of the Nazi German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by Herschel Grynszpan , a 17-year-old German-born Polish Jew living in Paris . Estimates of fatalities caused by the attacks have varied . Early reports estimated that 91 Jews had been murdered . Modern analysis of German scholarly sources puts the figure much higher ; when deaths from post-arrest maltreatment and subsequent suicides are included , the death toll climbs into the hundreds , with Richard J.

Subsequently , a guerrilla liberation war was fought against the Axis occupying forces and their locally established puppet regimes , including the fascist Independent State of Croatia and the Government of National Salvation in the German-occupied territory of Serbia , by the Communist-led republican Yugoslav Partisans . Simultaneously , a multi-side civil war was waged between the Yugoslav communist Partisans , the Serbian royalist Chetniks , the Croatian fascist Ustashe and Home Guard , Serbian Volunteer Corps and State Guard , as well as Slovene Home Guard troops . Both the Yugoslav Partisans and the Chetnik movement initially resisted the occupation . However , after 1941 , Chetniks extensively and systematically collaborated with the Italian occupation forces until the Italian capitulation , and thereon also with German and Ustashe forces . The Axis mounted a series of offensives intended to destroy the Partisans , coming close to doing so in the Battle of Neretva and Battle of Sutjeska in the spring and summer of 1943 . despite the setbacks , the partisans remained a credible fighting force , with their organization gaining recognition from the western allies at the tehran conference and laying the foundations for the post-war yugoslav state . With support in logistics and air power from the Western Allies , and Soviet ground troops in the Belgrade Offensive , the Partisans eventually gained control of the entire country and of the border regions of Trieste and Carinthia . The human cost of the war was enormous . The number of war victims is still in dispute , but is generally agreed to have been at least one million . Non-combat victims included the majority of the country 's Jewish population , many of whom perished in concentration and extermination camps ( e.g . Jasenovac , Banjica ) run by the client regimes .

Israel 's stated goals in Operation `` Summer Rains '' were to suppress the firing of Qassam rockets from Gaza into the western Negev , and to secure the release of Corporal Gilad Shalit , who had been captured by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on June 25 . The soldier was captured amid a background of violence between the IDF and Palestinian militant groups since the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza . According to statistics published by the Israeli government , 757 missiles from Gaza hit Israel between the withdrawal and the end of June 2006 . The IDF had responded with artillery fire and air raids . during the operation , the pace of both rocket fire and shelling increased dramatically , and the idf mounted numerous ground incursions into the gaza strip to target militant groups and their infrastructure , including smuggling tunnels in the philadelphi corridor . on the first day of the conflict , israel also bombed the only electrical power plant in the gaza strip . At the start of the incursion , Israel said the operation could end if Shalit was released but noted that it had exhausted all the diplomatic means towards this end that it considered tenable .

            "content": "Document: The Thirty Years ' War was a war fought primarily in Central Europe between 1618 and 1648 . One of the most destructive conflicts in human history , it resulted in eight million fatalities not only from military engagements but also from violence , famine , and plague . Casualties were overwhelmingly and disproportionately inhabitants of the Holy Roman Empire , most of the rest being battle deaths from various foreign armies . The deadly clashes ravaged Europe ; 20 percent of the total population of Germany died during the conflict and there were losses up to 50 percent in a corridor between Pomerania and the Black Forest . In terms of proportional German casualties and destruction , it was surpassed only by the period January to May 1945 ; one of its enduring results was 19th-century Pan-Germanism , when it served as an example of the dangers of a divided Germany and became a key justification for the 1871 creation of the German Empire ( although it excluded the German-speaking parts of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg empire ) . Initially a war between various Protestant and Catholic states in the fragmented Holy Roman Empire , it gradually developed into a more general conflict involving most of the European great powers . These states employed relatively large mercenary armies , and the war became less about religion and more of a continuation of the France\u2013Habsburg rivalry for European political pre-eminence . The war was preceded by the election of the new Hapsburg Holy Roman Emperor , Ferdinand II , who tried to impose religious uniformity on his domains , forcing Roman Catholicism on its peoples . The northern Protestant states , angered by the violation of their rights to religious liberty , which had been granted in the Peace of Augsburg , banded together to form the Protestant Union . Ferdinand II was a devout Roman Catholic and much less tolerant than his predecessor , Rudolf II , who ruled from the largely Protestant city of Prague . Ferdinand 's policies were considered strongly pro-Catholic and anti-Protestant . These events caused widespread fears throughout northern and central Europe , and triggered the Protestant Bohemians living in the then relatively loose dominion of Habsburg Austria ( and also with the Holy Roman Empire ) to revolt against their nominal ruler , Ferdinand II . After the so-called Defenestration of Prague deposed the Emperor 's representatives in Prague , the Protestant estates and Catholic Habsburgs started gathering allies for war . The Protestant Bohemians ousted the Habsburgs and elected the Calvinist Frederick V , Elector of the Rhenish Palatinate as the new king of the Kingdom of Bohemia . Frederick took the offer without the support of the Protestant Union . The southern states , mainly Roman Catholic , were angered by this . Led by Bavaria , these states formed the Catholic League to expel Frederick in support of the Emperor . The Empire soon crushed the perceived Protestant rebellion in the Battle of White Mountain , executing leading Bohemian aristocrats shortly after . Protestant rulers across Europe unanimously condemned the Emperor 's action . After the atrocities committed in Bohemia , Saxony finally gave its support to the Protestant Union and decided to fight back . Sweden , at the time a rising military power , soon intervened in 1630 under its king Gustavus Adolphus , transforming what had been simply the Emperor 's attempt to curb the Protestant states into a full-scale war in Europe . Habsburg Spain , wishing to finally crush the Dutch rebels in the Netherlands and the Dutch Republic ( which was de facto independent since 1581 but de jure still a part of the Holy Roman Empire ) , intervened under the pretext of helping its dynastic Habsburg ally , Austria . No longer able to tolerate the encirclement of two major Habsburg powers on its borders , Catholic France entered the coalition on the side of the Protestants in order to counter the Habsburgs . The Thirty Years ' War devastated entire regions , resulting in high mortality , especially among the populations of the German and Italian states , the Crown of Bohemia , and the Southern Netherlands . Both mercenaries and soldiers in fighting armies traditionally looted or extorted tribute to get operating funds , which imposed severe hardships on the inhabitants of occupied territories . The war also bankrupted most of the combatant powers . The Dutch Republic enjoyed contrasting fortune ; it obtained independence from the Holy Roman Empire and also from Spain ( which had directly controlled the Dutch lands despite it not being part of the Holy Roman Empire ) thus concluding its 80-year revolt against Spain . it subsequently enjoyed a time of great prosperity and development , known as the dutch golden age , during which it became one of the world 's foremost economic , colonial , and naval powers . the thirty years ' war ended with the treaty of UNK and the treaties of UNK , part of the wider peace of westphalia . The war altered the previous political order of European powers . The rise of Bourbon France , the curtailing of Habsburg ambition , and the ascendancy of Sweden as a great power <event> created </event> a new balance of power on the continent , with France emerging from the war strengthened and increasingly dominant in the latter part of the 17th century .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of created?\n\nOptions: (A) abc\n(B) acy\n(C) agb\n(D) agg"

The HoR ( also known as the Council of Deputies ) , in control of eastern and southern Libya , has the loyalty of the Libyan National Army of General Khalifa Haftar , and has been supported by airstrikes by Egypt and the UAE . The GNC , based in western Libya and backed by various different militias ( mainly Libya Dawn in the west and Libya Shield in the east ) with some support from Qatar , Sudan and Turkey , initially accepted the results of the 2014 election , but rejected them after the Supreme Constitutional Court nullified an amendment regarding the roadmap for Libya 's transition and HoR elections . Due to controversy about constitutional amendments , the HoR refused to take office from GNC in Tripoli , which was controlled by powerful militias from the western coastal city of Misrata . Instead , the HoR established its parliament in Tobruk , which is controlled by General Haftar 's forces . in december 2015 , after long talks in unk , the libyan political agreement was <event> signed </event> . The LPA was the result of protracted negotiations between rival political camps based in Tripoli , Tobruk , and elsewhere which agreed to unite as the Government of National Accord . On 30 March 2016 , Fayez Sarraj , the head of the GNA , arrived in Tripoli and began working from there despite opposition from GNC . although the government of national accord is currently the only internationally-recognized government in the country , its authority is still not recognized by the hor , as specific details acceptable to both sides have not yet been agreed upon , especially regarding the future of unk . In addition to those three factions , there are also smaller rival groups : the Islamist Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries , led by Ansar al-Sharia , which has had the support of the GNC and was defeated in Benghazi in 2017 ; the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant 's ( ISIL 's ) Libyan provinces ; the Shura Council of Mujahideen in Derna which expelled ISIL from Derna in July 2015 and was later itself defeated in Derna by the Tobruk government in 2018 ; as well as many militias and armed groups , whose allegiances often change . The GNA and the GNC launched a joint offensive to capture areas in and around Sirte from ISIL in May 2016 . This offensive resulted in ISIL losing control of all significant territory it previously held in Libya . Forces loyal to Khalifa al-Ghawil attempted a coup d'\u00e9tat against Fayez al-Sarraj and the Presidential Council of the GNA later in 2016 . Background of discontent with General National Congress . at the beginning of 2014 , libya was governed by the general national congress ( gnc ) , which won the popular vote in 2012 elections . the gnc was made of two major political groupings , the national forces alliance ( nfc ) and the justice and construction party ( jcp ) . The two major groups in parliament had failed to reach political compromises on the larger more important issues that the GNC faced . Division among these parties , the row over the political isolation law , and a continuous unstable security situation greatly impacted the GNC 's ability to deliver real progress towards a new constitution for Libya which was a primary task for this body . The GNC also included members associated with conservative Islamist groups as well as revolutionary groups ( thuwwar ) . Some members of the GNC had a conflict of interest due to associations with militias and were accused of channeling government funds towards some armed groups and allowing others to conduct assassinations and kidnappings . Parties holding majority of seats and some holding minority of seats began to use boycotts or threats of boycotts which increased division and suppressed relevant debates by removing them from the congressional agenda ; voting to declare sharia law and establishing a special committee to `` review all existing laws to guarantee they comply with Islamic law '' ; imposing gender segregation and compulsory hijab at Libyan universities ; and refusing to hold new elections when its electoral mandate expired in January 2014 until General Khalifa Haftar launched a large-scale military offensive against the Islamists in May 2014 , code-named Operation Dignity ( ; 'Amaliyat al-Karamah ) .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of signed?\n\nOptions: (A) add\n(B) acj\n(C) afu\n(D) adm"

            "content": "Document: The Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation or Borneo confrontation ( also known by its Indonesian/Malay name , Konfrontasi ) was a violent conflict from 1963\u201366 that stemmed from Indonesia 's opposition to the creation of Malaysia . The creation of Malaysia was the amalgamation of the Federation of Malaya ( now West Malaysia ) , Singapore and the crown colony/British protectorates of North Borneo and Sarawak ( collectively known as British Borneo , now East Malaysia ) in September 1963 . Important precursors to the conflict included Indonesia 's policy of confrontation against Netherlands New Guinea from March\u2013August 1962 and the Brunei Revolt in December 1962 . The confrontation was an undeclared war with most of the action occurring in the border area between Indonesia and East Malaysia on the island of Borneo ( known as Kalimantan in Indonesia ) . The conflict was characterised by restrained and isolated ground combat , set within tactics of low-level brinkmanship . Combat was usually conducted by company- or platoon-sized operations on either side of the border . Indonesia 's campaign of infiltrations into Borneo sought to exploit the ethnic and religious diversity in Sabah and Sarawak compared to that of Malaya and Singapore , with the intent of unraveling the proposed state of Malaysia . The jungle terrain of Borneo and lack of roads straddling the Malaysia\u2013Indonesia border forced both Indonesian and Commonwealth forces to conduct long foot patrols . Both sides relied on light infantry operations and air transport , although Commonwealth forces enjoyed the advantage of better helicopter deployment and resupply to forward operating bases . Rivers were also used as a method of transport and infiltration . although combat operations were primarily conducted by ground forces , aerial forces played a vital support role and naval forces ensured the security of the sea flanks . The British <event> provided </event> most of the defensive effort , although Malaysian forces steadily increased their contributions , and there were periodic contributions from Australian and New Zealand forces within the combined Far East Strategic Reserve stationed then in West Malaysia and Singapore . Initial Indonesian attacks into East Malaysia relied heavily on local volunteers trained by the Indonesian Army . With the passage of time infiltration forces became more organised with the inclusion of a larger component of Indonesian forces . To deter and disrupt Indonesia 's growing campaign of infiltrations , the British responded in 1964 by launching their own covert operations into Indonesian Kalimantan under the code name Operation Claret . Coinciding with Sukarno announcing a 'year of dangerous living ' and the 1964 race riots in Singapore , Indonesia launched an expanded campaign of operations into West Malaysia on 17 August 1964 , albeit without military success . A build-up of Indonesian forces on the Kalimantan border in December 1964 saw the UK commit significant forces from the UK-based Army Strategic Command and Australia and New Zealand deployed roulement combat forces from West Malaysia to Borneo in 1965\u201366 . The intensity of the conflict began to subside following the events of the 30 September Movement and Suharto 's rise to power . A new round of peace negotiations between Indonesia and Malaysia began in May 1966 and a final peace agreement was signed on 11 August 1966 with Indonesia formally recognising Malaysia .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of provided?\n\nOptions: (A) aek\n(B) aeh\n(C) abv\n(D) agg"

            "content": "Document: The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major , but ultimately unsuccessful , uprising in India in 1857\u201358 against the rule of the British East India Company , which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown . The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company 's army in the garrison town of Meerut , northeast of Delhi ( now Old Delhi ) . It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India , though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east . The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region , and was contained only with the rebels ' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858 . On 1 November 1858 , the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder , though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859 . The rebellion is known by many names , including the Sepoy Mutiny , the Indian Mutiny , the Great Rebellion , the Revolt of 1857 , the Indian Insurrection , and the First War of Independence . The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions , including invasive British-style social reforms , harsh land taxes , summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes , as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule . Many Indians rose against the British ; however , many also fought for the British , and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule . Violence , which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty , was inflicted on both sides , on British officers , and civilians , including women and children , by the rebels , and on the rebels , and their supporters , including sometimes entire villages , by British reprisals ; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation . After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut , the rebels very quickly reached Delhi , whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler , Bahadur Shah Zafar , they declared the Emperor of Hindustan . Soon , the rebels had also captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh ( Oudh ) . The East India Company 's response came rapidly as well . With help from reinforcements , Kanpur was retaken by mid-July 1857 , and Delhi by the end of September . However , it then took the remainder of 1857 and the better part of 1858 for the rebellion to be suppressed in Jhansi , Lucknow , and especially the Awadh countryside . Other regions of Company controlled India\u2014Bengal province , the Bombay Presidency , and the Madras Presidency\u2014remained largely calm . In the Punjab , the Sikh princes crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support . The large princely states , Hyderabad , Mysore , Travancore , and Kashmir , as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana , did not join the rebellion , serving the British , in the Governor-General Lord Canning 's words , as `` breakwaters in a storm . '' In some regions , most notably in Awadh , the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against European oppression . However , the rebel leaders proclaimed no articles of faith that presaged a new political system . Even so , the rebellion proved to be an important watershed in Indian- and British Empire history . It led to the dissolution of the East India Company , and forced the British to reorganize the army , the financial system , and the administration in India , through passage of the Government of India Act 1858 . India was thereafter administered directly by the British government in the new British Raj . On 1 November 1858 , Queen Victoria issued a proclamation to Indians , which while lacking the authority of a constitutional provision , promised rights similar to those of other British subjects . In the following decades , when admission to these rights was not always forthcoming , Indians were to pointedly refer to the Queen 's proclamation in growing avowals of a new nationalism . East India Company 's expansion in India . although the british east india company had established a presence in india as far back as 1612 , and earlier administered the factory areas established for trading purposes , its victory in the battle of plassey in 1757 marked the beginning of its firm foothold in eastern india . The victory was consolidated in 1764 at the Battle of Buxar , when the East India Company army defeated Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II . After his defeat , the emperor granted the Company the right to the `` collection of Revenue '' in the provinces of Bengal ( modern day Bengal , Bihar , and Odisha ) , known as `` Diwani '' to the Company . The Company soon expanded its territories around its bases in Bombay and Madras ; later , the Anglo-Mysore Wars ( 1766\u20131799 ) and the Anglo-Maratha Wars ( 1772\u20131818 ) led to control of even more of India . In 1806 , the Vellore Mutiny was sparked by new uniform regulations that created resentment amongst both Hindu and Muslim sepoys . After the turn of the 19th century , Governor-General Wellesley began what became two decades of accelerated expansion of Company territories . This was <event> achieved </event> either by subsidiary alliances between the Company and local rulers or by direct military annexation . The subsidiary alliances created the princely states of the Hindu maharajas and the Muslim nawabs . punjab , north-west frontier province , and kashmir were annexed after the second anglo-sikh war in 1849 ; however , kashmir was immediately sold under the 1846 treaty of amritsar to the dogra dynasty of jammu and thereby became a princely state . The border dispute between Nepal and British India , which sharpened after 1801 , had caused the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814\u201316 and brought the defeated Gurkhas under British influence . In 1854 , Berar was annexed , and the state of Oudh was added two years later . For practical purposes , the Company was the government of much of India .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of achieved?\n\nOptions: (A) adp\n(B) aat\n(C) agl\n(D) aeq"

The United States offensive , under the overall command of Chester Nimitz , followed the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign and was intended to neutralize Japanese bases in the central Pacific , support the Allied drive to retake the Philippines , and provide bases for a strategic bombing campaign against Japan . Beginning the offensive , United States Marine Corps and United States Army forces , with support from the United States Navy , executed landings on Saipan in June 1944 . In response , the Imperial Japanese Navy 's Combined Fleet sortied to attack the U.S. Navy fleet supporting the landings .

In the meantime , in order to secure the flank for U.S. forces preparing to attack Japanese forces in the Philippines , in September 1944 , U.S. Marine and Army forces landed on the islands of Peleliu and Angaur in Palau . After heavy and intense combat on Peleliu , the island was finally secured by U.S. forces in November 1944 . Following their landings in the Mariana and Palau Islands , Allied forces continued their ultimately successful campaign against Japan by landing in the Philippines in October 1944 and the Volcano and Ryukyu Islands beginning in January 1945 .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of losses?\n\nOptions: (A) afe\n(B) aet\n(C) adh\n(D) afr"

Events leading up the near war . After her return to power in 1980 as Prime Minister of India , Indira Gandhi ordered a general review of India 's security plans . in 1982-83 , she approved a plan submitted by the chief of the army staff , general unk . krishna rao , to upgrade the sporadic deployment of forces along the line of actual control with the people 's republic of china . since the late 1960s , india had developed an elaborate plan to defend the himalayan frontier with china . this involved the provision of screening defences at the line of actual control , or lac , and the building of strong defence nodes at key points along the frontier . By the early 1980s , while the forces to man the defences were <event> ready </event> , the nodes were not , and the greatest weakness was in the fact that the servicing road network had not been built . The decision was taken to resume the defence infrastructure construction . since 1962 , india had not returned to the site of its major defeat at unk chu , an east-west running stream which separates the unk la and the unk la ridge to its south . India 's efforts to occupy Thag La was the casus belli for the October 1962 Chinese military attack on India . Because there were no other feasible defensive locations north of Tawang , the government had more or less decided that in the event of a new war , they would abandon the town and prepare for battle at the Se La pass to its east . However , after the 1980 review , it was decided by the military strategists that it was important to defend Tawang in a future conflict . The army made it clear that the only viable line of defence for Tawang would be along the Hathung La ridge . In 1983 , an Intelligence Bureau team went to the pasturage of Sumdorong Chu which is north-east of the confluence of the Namka Chu and Nyamjiang Chu . The defence forces stayed through the summer and returned in winter . This procedure was followed for two years . In 1986 , Indian forces found that the Chinese had preceded them and set up semi-permanent structures there . In Feb 1986 the army nominated a new chief , General K. Sundarji , who was determined to press the decisions taken by General Krishna Rao . In addition , Sundarji sought government permission to conduct an exercise named Operation Chequerboard to see how quickly troops based in the Assam plains could take up their positions on the Sino-Indian border . As part of the exercise , towards the end of the year , the army landed a brigade of troops at Zimithaung , south of Hathung La using its new heavy lift Mi-26 helicopters . These forces occupied the Hathung La , across the Namka Chu from Thag La . All this alarmed the Chinese forces in the region ; they responded with alacrity and moved up their forces to take up positions all along the LAC . at points near this unk la , bum la , etc . the troops were now face to face with their Indian counterparts . This caused concerns of Sino-Indian clashes . However , the forces did not engage in combat .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of ready?\n\nOptions: (A) aaf\n(B) abx\n(C) abm\n(D) ack"

In Kingston upon Hull , where the majority of the inhabitants were Royalists , there was a large arsenal which had been established for the Second Bishops ' War in 1638 . To deny the Royalists access to this , in January 1642 Sir John Hotham was ordered by Parliament to seize Hull . This was carried out at once by his son John , who became the Military Governor of Hull . Charles I hoped that quick victories would negate Parliament 's advantage in material , and as the armouries in London were beyond his reach he hoped to take the large arsenal at Hull to supplement the armouries he did have access to , such as those of the Derbyshire and Staffordshire trained bands . In April 1642 Hotham refused to admit Charles I to Hull . Later he promised his prisoner , Lord Digby , that he would surrender the city to the king , but when Charles appeared again , after travelling to Beverley ( a walled medieval town some 8 \u2013 10 miles away which was an armoury ) to collect more soldiers , Hotham refused a second time and drove away the besiegers .

The men refused to disperse and demanded the cabinet 's resignation and a change in political course . Two days later , the cabinet ordered the leaders of the Lapua movement arrested using the `` Protection of the Republic Act '' which the movement itself had urged for a year before . Army units prepared as the Chief of Defence , Lieutenant General Aarne Sihvo was prepared to use force to end the rebellion . Orders were given to reinforce the defence of Helsinki with tanks and artillery in case the situation worsened . As the tensions grew , so did the consumption of alcohol among the instigators .

It took place on the Eastern Front of World War II and was part of the wider Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive , a Soviet attack against Army Group South to retake the rest of Ukraine that <event> fell </event> to Germany in 1941 . Following the Soviet advance to the Dnieper in the Battle of the Dnieper during late 1943 , German forces managed to hold to the Nikopol bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnieper , the area of manganese ore mines of crucial importance to German war production that Adolf Hitler insisted on holding . In November and December , the 3rd and 4th Ukrainian Fronts conducted multiple unsuccessful attacks against the bridgehead , a salient centered around the supply base and rail junction of Apostolovo , and German troops in the Krivoi Rog area . Following another failed attack in mid-January , the Nikopol\u2013Krivoy Rog Offensive was launched by the 3rd Ukrainian Front to the north of the salient on 30 January , and elements of the 4th Ukrainian Front to the south of it joined in a day later . The Soviet troops broke through the 6th Army 's lines , capturing Apostolovo on 5 February , splitting the army in half . Nikopol fell on 8 February , but despite heavy losses the troops in the bridgehead , including the German IV Army Corps , were able to retreat across the Dnieper . The IV Army Corps launched an unsuccessful counterattack against Apostolovo around this time , resulting in a temporary Soviet pause in order to prepare for the advance against Krivoi Rog , in the northwest portion of the salient . Two armies of the 3rd Ukrainian Front began the advance towards that city on 17 February , and captured it on 22 February . Other armies from the front then resumed the advance and captured several bridgeheads over the Inhulets river , which became the next German defensive line . Fighting in the area died down , but the Soviet gains paved the way for subsequent advances during the second phase of the Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive . The offensive resulted in the loss of the German salient and at least 15,000 casualties being inflicted on the units of 6th Army in the fighting .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of fell?\n\nOptions: (A) aby\n(B) abe\n(C) acp\n(D) ads"

The attack , and the subsequent riots in the south ( dubbed Black July ) , are generally considered as the start of the conflict . This fighting continued until 1985 , when peace talks were held between the two sides in Thimphu , Bhutan , in hopes of seeking a negotiated settlement . They proved fruitless and fighting soon resumed . By 1987 , the Vadamarachchi Operation of the Sri Lankan military had cornered the LTTE in Jaffna , on the tip of the island and were confident of bringing an end to the conflict . However , due to internal pressure , specifically concern about the 50 million Tamils living in India , the Indian government called for a halt to the offensive . After the request was snubbed by Sri Lanka , the Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi ordered a flotilla of ships be sent to relieve the LTTE .

            "content": "Document: The Iran\u2013Israel proxy conflict , or Iran\u2013Israel proxy war and Iran\u2013Israel Cold War , is the ongoing proxy war between Iran and Israel . The conflict is bound in the political struggle of Iranian leadership against Israel and its declared aim to dissolve the Jewish state , with the counter aim of Israel to prevent nuclear weapons being acquired by the Iranian government and downgrading its allies and proxies such as the Lebanese Hezbollah party . Iranian forces are operating in Syria in support of Bashar al-Assad 's government . The conflict gradually emerged from the declared hostility of post-revolutionary Islamic Republic of Iran towards Israel since 1979 , into covert Iranian support of Hezbollah during the South Lebanon conflict ( 1985\u20132000 ) and essentially developed into a proxy regional conflict from 2005 . With increasing Iranian involvement in Syria from 2011 , the conflict had shifted from proxy warfare into direct confrontation by early 2018 . Israel suspects Tehran is pursuing the goal of forming a continuous land transport route from Iran via Iraq and Syria to Lebanon , and if Tehran succeeds `` it would be a strategic game-changer . '' According to Mossad chief Yossi Cohen , `` As long as the current regime exists , with the nuclear agreement or without it , Iran will continue to serve as the main threat to Israel 's security '' . In the Syrian Civil War , hoping to bolster its logistics and force projection capabilities in the area , Tehran aims to clear a path from the Iranian capital to Damascus and the Mediterranean coast . Israeli government is convinced that Iran is interested in creating territorial contiguity from Iran to the Mediterranean and in transferring military forces \u2013 including naval vessels , fighter planes and thousands of troops \u2013 to permanent bases in Syria and is trying to `` Lebanonize '' Syria and take over using Shi'ite militias , as it had done with Hezbollah in Lebanon . As Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman has warned , `` everything possible will be done to prevent the existence of a Shi'ite corridor from Tehran to Damascus '' . In 2017 , Israeli intelligence discovered an Iranian base being built in Syria just 50 km from the Israeli border . Israel and Syria have observed a truce since Israel reaffirmed its control over most of the Golan Heights in the 1973 Yom Kippur War , but the Syrian Civil War , which began in 2011 , has led to several incidents of fire exchange across the once-peaceful borders . The Israeli military is reportedly preparing itself for potential threats should there be a power vacuum in Syria . `` after assad and after establishing or strengthening their foothold in syria they are going to move and deflect their effort and attack israel , '' an israeli official told the associated press in january 2014 . Some experts say that while the encroaching militant forces on Israel 's border will heighten security measures , the advancements are not likely to create significant changes to Israel 's policy disengagement in the Syria crisis . In a number of incidents over the course of the Syrian Civil War , Israel has clashed with Hezbollah and Iranian forces in the region . On several occasions , Israel was <event> suspected </event> of perpetrating or supporting attacks on Hezbollah and Iranian targets within Syrian territories or Lebanon . The first incident of this kind took place on 30 January 2013 , when Israeli aircraft were accused of allegedly striking a Syrian convoy transporting Iranian weapons to Hezbollah . More incidents were attributed to IAF on May 2013 , December 2014 , April 2015 . Some of those reports were confirmed by the Syrian Arab Republic , whereas others denied . Israel systematically refused to comment on alleged targeting of Hezbollah and Ba'athist Syrian targets in Syrian territory . In 2015 , suspected Hezbollah militants launched an attack on Israeli forces in Shebaa farms . In March 2017 , Syria launched anti-aircraft missiles towards Israeli-controlled part of the Golan Heights , allegedly targeting Israeli IAF aircraft , which Syria claimed were on their way to attack targets in Palmyra ( Syria ) . After the incident , the State of Israel has stated it was targeting weapons shipments headed toward anti-Israeli forces , specifically Hezbollah , located in Lebanon . Israel denied Syria 's claim that one jet fighter was shot down and another damaged . Israel has not reported any pilots or aircraft missing in Syria , or anywhere else in the Middle East following the incident . According to some sources , the incident was the first time Israeli officials clearly confirmed an Israeli strike on a Hezbollah convoy during the Syrian Civil War . As of September 2017 , this was the only time such confirmation was issued . Iran claims its foreign policy is based on aiding the oppressed vulnerables around the world\u2013not for material gains , but as a humanitarian religious positive action . In Iran 's foreign policy Israel is conceptualized as an illegitimate Zionist regime that threatens vulnerable people and Islamic religion itself . It is known as ideological enemy for Iran . Iran , in contact with the U.S. over the fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has said that Israel would be at risk if the U.S. and its coalition sought to topple Assad . Hezbollah 's 7 October 2014 attack on Israeli forces , its first declared such operation since 2006 , proved the seriousness of the threat . though the islamic republic of iran has been known for its anti-israeli stance from the very beginning , its continuous support for hezbollah evolved into almost a direct confrontation with israel , as iranian islamic revolutionary guard corps have allegedly infiltrated lebanon and directly supported hezbollah during the past decade . The Hamas-dominated Gaza had also been considered a proxy of Iran .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of suspected?\n\nOptions: (A) abf\n(B) abi\n(C) aas\n(D) acc"

Al-Mabhouh\u2014a co-founder of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades , the military wing of Hamas\u2014was wanted by the Israeli government for the kidnapping and murder of two Israeli soldiers in 1989 as well as <event> purchasing </event> arms from Iran for use in Gaza ; these have been cited as a possible motive for the assassination . He also had other enemies , including Fatah . He had spent some time in prison in Egypt in 2003 , and was sought by Jordanian intelligence . His assassination attracted international attention in part due to allegations that it was ordered by the Israeli government and carried out by Mossad agents holding fake or fraudulently obtained passports from several European countries and Australia . The photographs of the 26 suspects and their aliases were subsequently placed on Interpol 's most-wanted list . The Dubai police found that 12 of the suspects used British passports , along with six Irish , four French , one German , and three Australian passports . Interpol and the Dubai police believed that the suspects stole the identities of real people , mostly Israeli dual citizens . Two Palestinians , believed by Hamas to be former Fatah security officers and current employees of a senior Fatah official , were taken into custody in Dubai , on suspicions that one of them provided logistical assistance to the hit team . Despite Hamas 's claim , Dubai would not comment on the incident or identify the two Palestinian suspects . According to initial reports , Al-Mabhouh was drugged , then electrocuted and suffocated . Lt. Gen. Dhahi Khalfan Tamim of the Dubai Police Force said the suspects tracked Al-Mabhouh to Dubai from Damascus , Syria . They arrived from different European destinations and stayed at different hotels , presumably to avoid being detected and , with the exception of three of its members suspected of `` helping to facilitate '' who had left on a ferry for Iran several months before the assassination , departed after the assassination to different countries . Dubai 's police chief said that he was `` 99 % certain '' that the assassination was the work of Israel 's Mossad . On 1 March 2010 , he stated that he was `` sure '' that `` all '' of the suspects are hiding in Israel . He said that Dubai would ask for an arrest warrant to be issued for Meir Dagan , the head of Mossad , if it is confirmed that the Mossad is involved and responsible for the assassination . The Hamas leadership also holds Israel responsible , and has vowed revenge . Hamas , which is itself on the U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations , European Union lists of terrorist organizations , and also considered a terrorist organization by the governments of Israel , and Japan , as is its military arm by the United Kingdom and Australia , requested that Israel be added by the EU to its list because of suspicions that Israel was involved in the assassination . However , later in March , Dubai police chief said , `` I am now completely sure that it was Mossad '' , and went on to say `` I have presented the ( Dubai ) prosecutor with a request for the arrest of ( Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin ) Netanyahu and the head of Mossad '' for the assassination . Khalfan would also suggest that a Hamas associate fed information to Mossad . This was denied by Hamas which blamed Fatah for helping the Mossad hit team . In March 2010 , the British foreign secretary , David Miliband , expelled an Israeli diplomat after the UK 's Serious Organised Crime Agency discovered that Israel had forged copies of British passports . On 24 May , the Australian government expelled an Israeli diplomat after concluding that there was `` no doubt Israel was behind the forgery of four Australian passports '' related to the assassination . Similar action was taken by Ireland . Israel has refused to comment on the accusations that its security forces were behind the assassination . On 30 September 2010 , Dubai 's police chief Dahi Khalfan said he received death threats from Israel 's spy agency Mossad linked to his role in uncovering details of the assassination of al-Mabhouh , but whether such calls existed remains unconfirmed .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of purchasing?\n\nOptions: (A) ads\n(B) agl\n(C) aeo\n(D) acg"

After majority rule in 1994 , contrary to expectations , the incidence of xenophobia increased . Between 2000 and March 2008 , at least 67 people died in what were identified as xenophobic attacks . In May 2008 , a series of attacks left 62 people dead ; although 21 of those killed were South African citizens . The attacks were motivated by xenophobia . In 2015 , another nationwide spike in xenophobic attacks against immigrants in general prompted a number of foreign governments to begin repatriating their citizens . a pew research poll conducted in 2018 showed that 62 % of south africans viewed immigrants as a burden on society by taking jobs and social benefits and that 61 % of south africans thought that immigrants were more responsible for crime than other groups . Between 2010 and 2017 the immigrant community in South Africa increased from 2 million people to 4 million people . Xenophobia in South Africa before 1994 . Attacks against Mozambican and Congolese immigrants . Between 1984 and the end of hostilities in that country , an estimated 50,000 to 350,000 Mozambicans fled to South Africa . While never granted refugee status they were technically allowed to settle in the bantustans or black homelands created during the apartheid system . The reality was more varied , with the homeland of Lebowa banning Mozambican settlers outright while Gazankulu welcomed the refugees with support in the form of land and equipment . Those in Gazankulu , however , found themselves confined to the homeland and liable for deportation should they officially enter South Africa , and evidence exists that their hosts denied them access to economic resources . Unrest and civil war likewise saw large numbers of Congolese people emigrate to South Africa , many illegally , in 1993 and 1997 . Subsequent studies found indications of xenophobic attitudes towards these refugees , typified by them being denied access to the primary healthcare to which they were technically entitled . Xenophobia in South Africa after 1994 . Despite a lack of directly comparable data , xenophobia in South Africa is perceived to have significantly increased after the election of a Black majority government in 1994 . According to a 2004 study <event> published </event> by the Southern African Migration Project ( SAMP ) : The ANC government \u2013 in its attempts to overcome the divides of the past and build new forms of social cohesion ... embarked on an aggressive and inclusive nation-building project . One unanticipated by-product of this project has been a growth in intolerance towards outsiders ... Violence against foreign citizens and African refugees has become increasingly common and communities are divided by hostility and suspicion . The study was based on a citizen survey across member states of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) and found South Africans expressing the harshest anti-immigrant sentiment , with 21 % of South Africans in favour of a complete ban on foreign entry and 64 % in favour of strict limitations on the numbers permitted . By contrast , the next-highest proportion of respondents in favour of a complete ban on immigration were in neighbouring Namibia , and Botswana , at 10 % . foreigners and the south african police service . a 2004 study by the centre for the study of violence and reconciliation ( unk ) of attitudes amongst police officers in the johannesburg area found that 87 % of respondents believed that most undocumented immigrants in johannesburg are involved in crime , despite there being no statistical evidence to substantiate the perception . Such views combined with the vulnerability of illegal aliens led to abuse , including violence and extortion , some analysts argued . In a March 2007 meeting with Home Affairs Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula , a representative of Burundian refugees in Durban ; claimed that immigrants could not rely on police for protection , but instead found police mistreating them , stealing from them and making unconfirmed allegations that they sell drugs .

The `` Blog del Narco '' , a blog that documents events and people of the Mexican Drug War anonymously , reported that the actual ( unofficial ) death toll may be more than 68 people . The bodies were found in the town of San Juan in the municipality of Cadereyta Jim\u00e9nez , Nuevo Le\u00f3n at about 4 a.m. on a non-toll highway leading to Reynosa , Tamaulipas . The forty-three men and six women killed had their heads , feet , and hands cut off , making their identification difficult . Those killed also bore signs of torture and were stuffed in plastic bags .

A common rallying cry at the demonstrations was the chant ; `` The people demand social justice ! `` . As the protests expanded during August 2011 , the demonstrations began to also focus on other related issues relating to the social order and power structure in Israel . The housing protests which sparked the first demonstrations began as a result of a Facebook protest group that initially led hundreds of people to establish tents in the Rothschild Boulevard in the center of Tel Aviv , an act which soon gained momentum , media attention and began a public discourse in Israel regarding the high cost of housing and living expenses . Soon afterwards , the protests spread to many other major cities in Israel as thousands of Israeli protesters began establishing tents in the middle of central streets in major cities as a means of protest . As part of the protests , several mass demonstrations have been held across the country , in which hundreds of thousands of people have <event> participated </event> . A major focus of the protests have been what organizers have termed `` social justice '' . Part of the movement is about changing the social order , and the economic system . Calls to topple the government were made by some parts of the protests . Criticism of the protests includes accusations of a political agenda rather than a social one with revelations of funding from specific left-wing individuals and organizations like S. Daniel Abraham and the New Israel Fund . Maariv journalist Kalman Libeskind claimed that the spontaneous protests had actually been three months in the planning by Stan Greenberg and orchestrated by left-wing organizations and the National Left . Criticism within the protests accused the 'protest leaders ' of not publicizing specific goals , the lack of visibility of their goals , and the damaging impact of media focus being on a few activists . Following the first large-scale protests in early August , the government announced that a series of measures would be taken to solve the housing shortage , some of which were already under preparation and ratification , and some which were new measures proposed in response to the demands of the protest movement leadership . In addition , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed a team of ministers and senior staff members from his office , headed by Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz , to negotiate with the protest leaders as well as the Trajtenberg Committee . since that time , there was significant criticism of the prime minister 's perceived insensitivity to the public sentiment , prompting speculation that general sympathy for the protest movement may cause one or more members of the governing coalition to leave the government , triggering national elections . On 22 June 2012 , Daphne Leaf and several other activists tried to restart the housing protests by re-erecting a tent encampment on Rothschild Boulevard . The municipality had not given a permit and as a result Leaf , along with eleven other activists , were arrested when they resisted the twenty policemen and municipal inspectors who arrived to dismantle the tents which were confiscated .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of participated?\n\nOptions: (A) ack\n(B) acj\n(C) aam\n(D) aem"

LSD was not made illegal in California until October 6 , 1966 . The name `` Acid Test '' was coined by Kesey , after the term `` acid test '' used by gold miners in the 1850s . He began throwing parties at his farm at La Honda , California . The Merry Pranksters were central to organizing the Acid Tests , including Pranksters such as Lee Quarnstrom and Neal Cassady . Other people , such as LSD chemists Owsley Stanley and Tim Scully , were involved as well . Kesey took the parties to public places , and advertised with posters that read , `` Can you pass the acid test ? `` , and the name was later popularized in tom wolfe 's 1968 book , `` the electric kool-aid acid <event> test </event> '' . Musical performances by the Grateful Dead were commonplace , along with black lights , strobe lights , and fluorescent paint . The Acid Tests are notable for their influence on the LSD-based counterculture of the San Francisco area and subsequent transition from the beat generation to the hippie movement .

Few of the occupying British , French , and Italian troops had been deployed or engaged in combat . the turkish national movement ( `` unk unk '' ) in anatolia culminated in the formation of a new grand national assembly ( gna ; ) by mustafa kemal UNK and his colleagues . after the end of the unk , unk , greco-turkish fronts ( often referred to as the eastern front , the southern front , and the western front of the war , respectively ) , the treaty of UNK was abandoned and the treaties of kars ( october 1921 ) and lausanne ( july 1923 ) were signed . the allies left anatolia and eastern thrace , and the grand national assembly of turkey decided on the establishment of a republic in turkey , which was declared on 29 october 1923 . With the establishment of the Turkish National Movement , the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire , and the abolition of the sultanate , the Ottoman era and the Empire came to an end , and with Atat\u00fcrk 's reforms , the Turks created the modern , secular nation-state of Turkey on the political front . On 3 March 1924 , the Ottoman caliphate was officially abolished and the last Caliph was exiled . Prelude : 30 October 1918 \u2013 May 1919 . On 30 October 1918 , the Armistice of Mudros was signed between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies of World War I , bringing hostilities in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I to a close . The treaty granted the Allies the right to occupy forts controlling the Straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosporus ; and the right to occupy `` in case of disorder '' any territory in case of a threat to security . Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthorpe\u2014the British signatory of the Mudros Armistice\u2014stated the Triple Entente\u2032s public position that they had no intention to dismantle the government of the Ottoman Empire or place it under military occupation by `` occupying Constantinople '' . However , dismantling the Ottoman government and partitioning the Ottoman Empire among the Allied nations had been an objective of the Entente since the start of the war . On 13 November 1918 , a French brigade entered the city to begin the Occupation of Constantinople and its immediate dependencies , followed by a fleet consisting of British , French , Italian and Greek ships deploying soldiers on the ground the next day . A wave of seizures took place in the following months by the Allies . On 14 November , joint Franco-Greek troops occupied the town of Uzunk\u00f6pr\u00fc in Eastern Thrace as well as the railway axis till the train station of Had\u0131mk\u00f6y near \u00c7atalca on the outskirts of Constantinople . On 1 December , British troops based in Syria occupied Kilis . Beginning in December , French troops began successive seizures of Ottoman territory , including the towns of Antakya , Mersin , Tarsus , Ceyhan , Adana , Osmaniye and Islahiye . Resistance to the occupations started in D\u00f6rtyol against the French on 19 December 1918 by the actions of Mehmet \u00c7avu\u015f . On 19 January 1919 , the Paris Peace Conference , a meeting of Allied nations that set the peace terms for the defeated Central Powers , including the Ottoman Empire , was first held . as a special body of the paris conference , `` the inter-allied commission on mandates in turkey '' was established to pursue the secret treaties they had signed between 1915 and 1917 . Among the objectives was a new Hellenic Empire based on the Megali Idea . This was promised by British Prime Minister David Lloyd George to Greece . italy sought control over the southern part of anatolia under the agreement of unk . france expected to exercise control over hatay , lebanon and syria , and also wanted control over a portion of southeastern anatolia based on the unk agreement . france signed the unk agreement and promised the realization of an armenian state in the mediterranean region in <event> exchange </event> to the french armenian legion . Meanwhile , Allied countries continued to lay claim to portions of the quickly crumbling Ottoman Empire . British forces based in Syria occupied Mara\u015f , Urfa and Birecik , while French forces embarked by gunboats and sent troops to the Black Sea ports of Zonguldak and Karadeniz Ere\u011fli commanding Turkey 's coal mining region . at the paris peace conference , competing claims of western anatolia by greek and italian delegations led greece to land the flagship of the greek navy at smyrna , resulting in the italian delegation walking out of the peace talks . On 30 April , Italy responded to the possible idea of Greek incorporation of Western Anatolia by also sending a warship to Smyrna ( Izmir ) as a show of force against the Greek campaign . A large Italian force also landed in Antalya . with the italian delegation absent from the paris peace talks , britain was able to sway france in favour of greece and ultimately the conference authorized the landing of greek troops on anatolian territory . The Greek campaign of Western Anatolia began on 15 May 1919 , as Greek troops began landing in Smyrna . For the city 's Muslim population , the day is marked by the `` first bullet '' fired by Hasan Tahsin at the Greek standard bearer at the head of the troops , the murder by bayonet coups of Miralay Fethi Bey for refusing to shout `` Zito Venizelos '' and the killing and wounding of unarmed Turkish soldiers in the city 's principal casern , as well as of 300\u2013400 civilians . Greek troops moved from Smyrna outwards to towns on the Karaburun peninsula , to Sel\u00e7uk , situated a hundred kilometers south of Smyrna at a key location that commands the fertile K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Menderes River valley , and to Menemen towards the north .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of exchange?\n\nOptions: (A) abq\n(B) aaj\n(C) abt\n(D) agd"

The event led some to demand even more political reform than they had been before , calling for an end to the reign of King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa . The clearance was described by witnesses as being brutal and sudden . Clouds of tear gas covered the area , and volleys of birdshot were fired on those who refused to withdraw . Medics , ambulances and a journalist were reportedly attacked as well . Sporadic clashes broke out around Bahrain hours after the raid . During the afternoon the National Guard and army deployed armoured vehicles , tanks , more than 50 armoured personnel carriers and set up checkpoints in the streets around the country . Protesters then took refuge at Salmaniya Medical Complex and continued their agitations ; thousands of them chanted `` Down with the king , down with the government . '' The government accused protesters of attacking the security forces , 50 of whom sustained injuries , and insisted that action had been necessary to pull Bahrain back from the `` brink of a sectarian abyss '' . But opposition parties dismissed the government 's account as a `` silly play '' , described the raid as a `` heinous massacre '' and submitted their resignations from the lower house of Parliament . Internationally , the Gulf Cooperation Council Ministers of Foreign Affairs expressed their solidarity with government of Bahrain and their support for the measures taken . The United Nations , the European Union and the United States on the other hand expressed their deep concern and regret for the violence used against protesters .

The attack led to the United States ' formal entry into World War II the next day . The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI , and as Operation Z during its planning . Japan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and the United States . over the course of seven hours there were coordinated japanese attacks on the u.s.-held philippines , guam and wake island and on the british empire in malaya , singapore , and hong kong . Additionally , from the Japanese viewpoint , it was seen as a preemptive strike . The attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time ( 18:18 GMT ) . The base was attacked by 353 Imperial Japanese aircraft ( including fighters , level and dive bombers , and torpedo bombers ) in two waves , launched from six aircraft carriers . All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged , with four sunk . All but were later raised , and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war . The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers , three destroyers , an anti-aircraft training ship , and one minelayer . 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed ; 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded . Important base installations such as the power station , dry dock , shipyard , maintenance , and fuel and torpedo storage facilities , as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building ( also home of the intelligence section ) were not attacked . Japanese losses were light : 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost , and 64 servicemen killed . One Japanese sailor , Kazuo Sakamaki , was captured . Japan announced a declaration of war on the United States later that day ( December 8 in Tokyo ) , but the declaration was not delivered until the following day . The following day , December 8 , Congress declared war on Japan . On December 11 , Germany and Italy each declared war on the U.S. , which responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy . There were numerous historical precedents for the unannounced military action by Japan , but the lack of any formal warning , particularly while peace negotiations were still apparently ongoing , led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7 , 1941 , `` a date which will live in infamy '' .

The attacks killed 38 elementary schoolchildren and six adults , and also injured at least 58 other people . Prior to his timed explosives going off at the school building , Kehoe had murdered his wife and firebombed his farm . Arriving at the site of the school explosion , Kehoe died when he detonated explosives concealed in his truck . Andrew Kehoe , the 55-year-old school board treasurer , was angered by increased taxes and his defeat in the spring 1926 election for township clerk . He was thought to have planned his `` murderous revenge '' after that public defeat . Kehoe had a reputation for difficulty on the school board and in personal dealings . In addition , he was notified that his mortgage was going to be foreclosed upon in June 1926 . For much of the next year , a neighbor noticed that he had stopped working on his farm and thought that he might be planning suicide . During that period , Kehoe purchased explosives and discreetly planted them on his property and under the school . Kehoe murdered his wife Nellie sometime between May 16 and the morning of May 18 , 1927 ; she had just been discharged from the hospital with an undefined illness . He then detonated various incendiary devices on his homestead on the morning of May 18 at about 8:45 a.m. , causing the house and other farm buildings to be destroyed by the explosives ' blasts and subsequent fires . Almost simultaneously , an explosion devastated the north wing of the Bath Consolidated School building , killing 36 schoolchildren and two teachers . Kehoe had used a timed detonator to detonate hundreds of pounds of dynamite and incendiary pyrotol , which he had secretly planted inside the school over the course of many months . As rescuers began working at the school , Kehoe drove up , stopped , and used a rifle to detonate dynamite inside his shrapnel-filled truck , killing himself , the school superintendent , and several others nearby , as well as injuring more bystanders . During rescue efforts at the school , searchers discovered an additional 500 pounds ( 230 kg ) of unexploded dynamite and pyrotol connected to a timing device set to detonate at the same time as the first explosions ; the material was hidden throughout the basement of the south wing .

Brendan Mess , Erik Weissman , and Raphael Teken were murdered in Mess 's apartment . All had their throats slit from ear to ear with such great force that they were nearly decapitated . Thousands of dollars ' worth of marijuana and money were left covering their mutilated bodies ; in all , $ 5,000 was left in the apartment . The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other , and that the murders were not random . Tamerlan Tsarnaev , the deceased suspect in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings , had previously described murder victim Brendan Mess as his best friend , though before Mess was murdered there had been animosity between Tsarnaev and Mess over Mess 's `` lifestyle '' . After the bombings and subsequent revelations of Tsarnaev 's personal life , the Waltham murders case was reexamined in April 2013 with Tsarnaev as a new suspect . Authorities said Tsarnaev and his younger brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev may have been responsible for the triple homicide , that forensic evidence connected them to the scene of the killings , and that their cell phone records placed them in the area . While police in the first investigation said that victims were killed on September 12 , `` The Boston Globe '' , `` Boston Herald '' , and `` The Wall Street Journal '' reported that at least one relative of the victims believes that the killings took place on September 11 . In May 2013 , Ibragim Todashev , a 27-year-old Chechen native and former mixed martial arts fighter who <event> knew </event> Tamerlan Tsarnaev , was shot and killed in Orlando , Florida , by law enforcement officers who had been interviewing him about the Waltham murders as well as the Boston Marathon bombings .

It was mainly caused by <event> disagreement </event> on whether men should be conscripted to fight in the war , but also brought out many issues regarding relations between French Canadians and English Canadians . Almost all French Canadians opposed conscription ; they felt that they had no particular loyalty to either Britain or France . Led by Henri Bourassa , they felt their only loyalty was to Canada . English Canadians supported the war effort as they felt stronger ties to the British Empire . on january 1 , 1918 , the unionist government began to enforce the military service act . The act caused 404,385 men to be liable for military service , from which 385,510 sought exemption . The most violent opposition occurred in Quebec , where anti-war attitudes drawn from French-Canadian nationalism sparked a weekend of rioting between March 28 and April 1 , 1918 . The disturbances began on a Thursday when Dominion Police detained a French-Canadian man who had failed to present his draft exemption papers . Despite the man 's release , an angry mob of nearly 200 soon descended upon the St. Roch District Police Station where the man had been held . Rioters then ransacked the conscription registration office as well as two pro-conscription newspapers within Quebec City . The final and bloodiest conflict happened Easter Monday when crowds once again organized against the military presence in the city , which by then had grown to 1,200 soldiers . The soldiers were ordered to fire on the crowds , immediately causing them to disperse . though the actual number of civilian casualties is debated , official reports from that day name five men killed by gunfire . Dozens more were injured . Among the soldiers are 32 recorded injuries that day , with no deaths . Monday , April 1 , marked the end of the Easter Riots , which totalled over 150 casualties and $ 300,000 in damage .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of disagreement?\n\nOptions: (A) aet\n(B) aec\n(C) aft\n(D) aac"

It lasted from 1415 , when King Henry V of England invaded Normandy , to 1453 , when the English lost Bordeaux . It followed a long period of peace from the end of the Caroline War in 1389 . the phase was named after the house of lancaster , the ruling house of the kingdom of england , to which henry v belonged . The first half of this phase of the war was dominated by the Kingdom of England . Initial English successes , notably at the famous Battle of Agincourt , coupled with divisions among the French ruling class , allowed the English to gain control of large parts of France . In 1420 , the Treaty of Troyes was signed , by which the English king <event> married </event> the French princess Catherine and was made regent of the kingdom and heir to the throne of France . A victory on paper was thus achieved by the English , with their claims now having legal standing . Some of the French nobility refused to recognize the agreement , however , and so military subjugation was still necessary to enforce its provisions . King Henry V and , after his death , his brother John , Duke of Bedford , brought the English to the height of their power in France , with an English king crowned in Paris . The second half of this phase of the war was dominated by the Kingdom of France . With charismatic leaders such as Joan of Arc and La Hire , and with England losing its main allies , the French forces counterattacked . Charles VII of France was crowned in Notre-Dame de Reims in 1429 , and from then a slow but steady reconquest of English-held French territories ensued . Ultimately the English would be expelled from France and lose all of their continental territories , except the Pale of Calais ( which would be captured in 1558 ) . the battle of castillon ( 1453 ) was the final action of the hundred years ' war , but france and england remained formally at war until the treaty of picquigny in 1475 .

On the night of 5 June , HMS `` Cardiff '' was stationed to the east of the islands to provide gunfire support to the land forces and intercept enemy aircraft . at around 02:00 a radar contact was detected ; a british army air corps gazelle helicopter was making a routine delivery of personnel and equipment to a radio rebroadcast station on east falkland . From the contact 's speed and course , `` Cardiff '' s operations room crew assumed it to be hostile . One Sea Dart missile was fired , destroying the target . The Gazelle 's wreckage and crew were discovered the next morning , and the loss was attributed to enemy fire . although `` cardiff '' was suspected , later scientific tests on the wreckage proved inconclusive . No formal inquiry was held until four years later . Defending their claim that the helicopter had been lost in action , the United Kingdom 's Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) stated that they had not wanted to `` cause further <event> anguish </event> to relatives '' while they were still trying to ascertain how the Gazelle had been shot down . The board of inquiry finally confirmed that the soldiers fell due to friendly fire . It recommended that `` neither negligence nor blame should be attributed to any individual '' , but identified several factors . A lack of communication between the army and the navy meant that 5th Infantry Brigade had not notified anyone of the helicopter 's flight . The navy had not informed the land forces that `` Cardiff '' had changed position to set up an ambush for Argentine aircraft travelling over the area . The helicopter 's identification friend or foe ( IFF ) transmitter was turned off , because it caused interference with the army 's Rapier anti-aircraft missile system .

            "content": "Document: Rendez-vous Houston : A City in Concert was a live performance by musician Jean Michel Jarre amidst the skyscrapers of downtown Houston on the evening of April 5 , 1986 , coinciding with the release of the `` Rendez-Vous '' album . For a period of time , it held a place in the `` Guinness Book of Records '' as the largest outdoor `` rock concert '' in history , with figures varying from 1 to 1.5 million in attendance . Rendez-vous Houston is remembered for being the concert which celebrated the astronauts of the Space Shuttle `` Challenger '' disaster , which had happened only two and a half months earlier . One of Jarre 's friends , astronaut Ron McNair , had been killed in the disaster . He was supposed to play the saxophone from space during the track `` Last Rendez-Vous '' ; his substitute for the concert was Houston native Kirk Whalum . Planning and problems of the concert . In 1985 , Jarre was contacted by the musical director of the Houston Grand Opera with the proposal for him related to the celebrations of Texas ' 150th birthday in 1986 , 150th birthday of the city of Houston and NASA 's 25th birthday . Because of NASA 's involvement , Jarre got the chance to keep in contact with a friend of his , astronaut captain Bruce McCandless II who later introduced Jarre to a flight companion of his , astronaut and jazz musician Ron McNair . Together they had the idea that for the celebrations , Jarre would create a piece of music that could be performed by McNair on his saxophone . The idea was that McNair , on his next trip into space in the `` Challenger '' Space Shuttle , would perform ( and record onto video ) the new piece of music , which would then be projected ( through video playback ) onto a giant screen that was to be constructed on the front of one of the buildings . On January 28 , 1986 , McNair telephoned Jarre for the last time . `` ... Everything 's ready . See you in a week 's time . Watch me on TV for the takeoff ! '' On that same day , an appalled world witnessed a historic tragedy - the `` Challenger '' Space Shuttle disintegrated in mid-air while on its ascent into space . Distraught by what happened , Jarre almost decided to cancel the concert . However , astronauts from NASA ( including Bruce McCandless ) telephoned Jarre . They asked Jarre not to cancel , as now the concert `` must '' go ahead , and be held in tribute to pay respect to the astronauts who had lost their lives in the disaster . The run-up to the concert itself still did not go smoothly . Rain poured down on Houston a couple of days before the concert , destroying much of the equipment on stage ( which was repaired by the day of the concert ) , breaking wires and ruining instruments . Furthermore , there had been a very strong wind blowing all week , which ended up splitting open the giant projection screen ( which was made from several small canvas panels ) and causing it to come crashing down . The local police turned up during the middle of a rehearsal demanding immediate payment of a fine ; the residents who lived nearby were complaining of excessive noise and were <event> exhausted </event> from their sleepless nights . Also , FBI officers threatened to put a stop to the whole proceedings because they were being deprived of electricity . 30 large lamps had been installed on top of FBI headquarters , and they were causing problems with their surveillance of Colonel Gaddafi , who was visiting the city at that time . There was still one more slight problem before the concert started . The chief of the Houston Fire Department , Robert Clayton , had told Francis Dreyfus , Jarre 's manager , that the show must be cancelled . This was due to a change of the wind direction ; the Chief was concerned that the crowd would be showered with firework debris . After some back-and-forth argument with Dreyfus , Clayton agreed that the concert could proceed on a 'see how it goes ' term . During the concert ( specifically , during the performance of `` Equinoxe Part 5 '' ) , the amount of fireworks being used and the direction of the wind did indeed cause debris to rain down on the audience , covering them in ash . Clayton frantically began to try to stop the proceedings , fearing that people would be injured . although his fears were duly noted , the crowd took no notice of the ash falling onto them and carried on enjoying the concert proceedings .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of exhausted?\n\nOptions: (A) agb\n(B) agc\n(C) aao\n(D) aaa"

His victims were ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart , her new partner Chris Brown , and police officer David Rathband . Stobbart was hospitalised and Brown was killed , while Rathband <event> remained </event> in hospital for nearly three weeks and was permanently blinded . Moat , who had recently been released from Durham Prison , shot the three with a sawn-off shotgun , two days after his release . After six days on the run , Moat was recognised by police and contained in the open , leading to a standoff . After nearly six hours of negotiation , Moat was shot with an experimental \u201c taser shotgun \u201d firing electrified rounds causing him to shoot himself in the head ; he was later pronounced dead at Newcastle General Hospital . Following an inquest , it was ruled by a jury that his death was a suicide and Northumbria Police were found to have been at no fault . The operation took place across the entire Northumbria Police area , which covers both the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear and the county of Northumberland . The manhunt began after the shootings of Stobbart and Brown in the early hours of 3 July 2010 in Birtley . Nearly 22 hours later , the shooting of traffic police officer Rathband , parked in East Denton , was linked to Moat . Moat was believed to have a grudge against the police after Stobbart had lied to Moat about being in a relationship with a police officer . Shortly after his release from prison , Moat posted threats to police and others on his Facebook profile . Moat apparently targeted Rathband randomly , simply for being a police officer , although on an earlier occasion Rathband had confiscated Moat 's van on the suspicion that it was not insured . Moat also made threats , in two letters and several phone calls , that he would kill any officer who attempted to stop him . Both the police and some of Moat 's relatives made several appeals for Moat to give himself up for the sake of his children . After a sighting on the night of 5 July in an armed robbery at Seaton Delaval , on 6 July it was announced that Moat was believed to be in Rothbury . The police manhunt remained focused there with several further suspected sightings , until the final confrontation at Riverside , Rothbury . The manhunt lasted almost seven days , and was the largest in modern British history , involving 160 armed officers and armed response vehicles , many seconded for the operation from other police forces . police also used sniper teams , helicopters , dogs , armoured anti-terrorist police vehicles from northern ireland , tracker ray mears , and even a royal air force jet for reconnaissance . In the course of the hunt there were several raids and false alarms across the region . With Moat believed to be sleeping rough , police found Moat 's abandoned camp-sites and property as he evaded capture . armed guards were also posted outside schools in rothbury after police announced that they believed moat posed a threat to the wider public . Several people were arrested during the hunt and after Moat 's death , suspected of assisting him with equipment , information , and in evading capture and selecting targets . On 5 July , Northumbria Police announced that Durham Prison had told them three days earlier that Moat intended to harm his girlfriend . as a result , northumbria police voluntarily referred the case to the independent police complaints commission ( ipcc ) . Following the final confrontation , the IPCC expanded the investigation to include the immediate events leading up to Moat 's death , but ruled out investigating how the manhunt itself had been conducted .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of remained?\n\nOptions: (A) adq\n(B) abn\n(C) afq\n(D) adi"

Kennedy was riding with his wife Jacqueline , Texas Governor John Connally , and Connally 's wife Nellie when he was fatally shot by former U.S. Marine Lee Harvey Oswald firing in ambush from a nearby building . Governor Connally was seriously wounded in the attack . The motorcade rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital where President Kennedy was pronounced dead about 30 minutes after the shooting ; Connally recovered from his injuries . Oswald was arrested by the Dallas Police Department 70 minutes after the initial shooting . Oswald was charged under Texas state law with the murder of Kennedy , as well as that of Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit , who had been fatally shot a short time after the assassination . at 11:21 a.m. november 24 , 1963 , as live television cameras were covering his transfer from the city jail to the county jail , oswald was fatally shot in the basement of dallas police headquarters by dallas nightclub operator jack ruby . Oswald was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital where he soon died . Ruby was convicted of Oswald 's murder , though it was later overturned on appeal , and Ruby died in prison in 1967 while awaiting a new trial . after a 10-month investigation , the warren commission concluded that oswald assassinated kennedy , that oswald had acted entirely alone , and that ruby had acted alone in killing oswald . Kennedy was the eighth and most recent US President to die in office , and the fourth ( following Lincoln , Garfield , and McKinley ) to be assassinated . Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson automatically assumed the Presidency upon Kennedy 's death . a later investigation , the united states house select committee on assassinations ( hsca ) agreed with the warren commission that the injuries that kennedy and connally sustained were caused by oswald 's three rifle shots , but they also concluded that kennedy was `` probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy '' as analysis of a unk audio recording pointed to the existence of an additional gunshot and therefore `` ... a high probability that two gunmen fired at [ the ] president '' . The Committee was not able to identify any individuals or groups involved with the possible conspiracy . In addition , the HSCA found that the original federal investigations were `` seriously flawed '' with respect to information-sharing and the possibility of conspiracy . As recommended by the HSCA , the acoustic evidence indicating conspiracy was subsequently re-examined and rejected . In light of the investigative reports determining that `` reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman '' , the U.S. Justice Department concluded active investigations and stated `` that no persuasive evidence can be identified to support the theory of a conspiracy in ... the assassination of President Kennedy '' . However , Kennedy 's assassination is still the subject of widespread debate and has spawned numerous conspiracy theories and alternative scenarios .

            "content": "Document: Severe Tropical Cyclone Lua affected a sparsely populated region of Western Australia during mid-March 2012 . Originating in a broad low pressure area that formed northwest of Australia by 8 March , the storm was plagued by inhibiting wind shear for the duration of its formative stages . However , it gradually organised , and received the name Lua on 13 March . The cyclone meandered for the first several days of its existence , caught between weak and competing steering currents . After the cyclone drifted northwestward , a building ridge of high pressure to the north drove Lua southeastward toward the Pilbara region . Ultimately intensifying into an upper-end Category 3 severe tropical cyclone with maximum sustained 10-minute winds of 155 km/h ( 100 mph ) , Lua made landfall near the remote community of Pardoo , about 150 km ( 95 mi ) east of Port Hedland . It steadily weakened as it progressed south over interior Western Australia , diminishing below tropical cyclone status on 18 March . The threat of the impending cyclone halted local industries such as oil production and iron ore mining and exporting . The Port of Port Hedland , a highly important iron ore shipping terminal , was forced to close for about 52 hours , contributing to inflated iron ore prices and delayed shipments . Multiple companies suspended work at oil fields and mines throughout the region , cutting national oil production by 25 % and iron ore exports by 4.7 % versus the previous month . Overall , Lua is attributed to $ 217 million ( 2012 AUD ; $ 230 million 2012 USD ) in lost revenue . Lua produced strong winds and widespread rainfall on land , but damage was <event> limited </event> by the lack of population in the storm 's path . The Pardoo Roadhouse bore the brunt of the storm , and damage was reported at several other cattle stations and homesteads ; at these sites , the storm damaged the exteriors of various structures and brought down swaths of trees . Central Western Australia endured several days of record-breaking rainfall and cool weather . The Government of Western Australia provided disaster relief funds to the hardest-hit areas , and `` Lua '' was later retired from the list of tropical cyclone names .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of limited?\n\nOptions: (A) abe\n(B) agh\n(C) aah\n(D) ady"

Watched by a crowd of 70,185 at Wembley Stadium , Arsenal won the match 2\u20131 . This was Arsenal 's 15th Charity Shield appearance and Manchester United 's 19th . Leading up to the match , both clubs were embroiled in controversy : United withdrew from English football 's primary cup competition , the FA Cup , in order to take part in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship ; Arsenal were entangled in a transfer saga involving their own player , striker Nicolas Anelka , who vowed to never play for the club again . United goalkeeper Mark Bosnich , signed as a replacement for Peter Schmeichel , made the first appearance of his second spell with the club . Sylvinho started his first game for Arsenal , whereas other signing Oleh Luzhny was named on the substitutes ' bench . United went ahead seven minutes before the end of the first half , when David Beckham 's free-kick hit the underside of the crossbar and narrowly crossed the line before Dwight Yorke made sure . Arsenal were awarded a penalty in the second half which Nwankwo Kanu converted and the striker assisted his teammate Ray Parlour to score the winner . This result marked Manchester United 's first defeat of 1999 . It was the second consecutive year that Arsenal beat United to win the Charity Shield .

The aims were to regain Western control of the Suez Canal and to remove Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser , who had just nationalized the canal . After the fighting had started , political pressure from the United States , the Soviet Union and the United Nations led to a withdrawal by the three invaders . The episode humiliated the United Kingdom and France and strengthened Nasser . On 29 October , Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai . Britain and France issued a joint ultimatum to cease fire , which was ignored . On 5 November , Britain and France landed paratroopers along the Suez Canal .

The three allies had attained a number of their military objectives , but the canal was useless . Heavy political pressure from the United States and the USSR led to a withdrawal . U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower had strongly warned Britain not to invade ; he threatened serious damage to the British financial system by selling the US government 's pound sterling bonds . Historians conclude the crisis `` signified the end of Great Britain 's role as one of the world 's major powers '' . The Suez Canal was closed from October 1956 until March 1957 .

After capturing the Siegfried Line , the 9th Armored Division of the U.S. First Army had advanced unexpectedly quickly towards the Rhine . They were very surprised to see one of the last bridges across the Rhine still standing . The Germans had wired the bridge with about of demolition charges . When they tried to blow it up , only a portion of the explosives detonated . U.S. forces captured the bridge and rapidly expanded their first bridgehead across the Rhine , two weeks before Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery 's meticulously planned Operation Plunder . The GIs ' actions prevented the Germans from regrouping east of the Rhine and consolidating their positions . The battle for control of the Ludendorff Bridge caused both the American and German forces to employ new weapons and tactics in combat for the first time . over the next 10 days , after its capture on 7 march 1945 and until its failure on 17 march , the germans used virtually every weapon at their disposal to try to destroy the bridge . This included infantry and armor , howitzers , mortars , floating mines , mined boats , a railroad gun , and the giant 600 mm Karl-Ger\u00e4t super-heavy mortar . They also attacked the bridge using the newly developed Arado Ar 234B-2 turbojet bombers . To protect the bridge against aircraft , the Americans positioned the largest concentration of anti-aircraft weapons during World War II leading to `` the greatest antiaircraft artillery battles in American history . '' The Americans counted 367 different German Luftwaffe aircraft attacking the bridge over the next 10 days . The Americans claimed to have shot down nearly 30 % of the aircraft dispatched against them . The German air offensive failed . On 14 March , German Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler ordered Schutzstaffel ( SS ) General Hans Kammler to fire V2 rockets to destroy the bridge . This marked the first time the missiles had been used against a tactical objective and the only time they were fired on a German target . The 11 missiles launched killed six Americans and a number of German citizens in nearby towns , but none landed closer than some from the bridge . When the Germans sent a squad of seven naval demolition swimmers wearing Italian underwater <event> breathing </event> apparatus , the Americans were ready . For the first time in combat , they had deployed the top-secret Canal Defence Lights which successfully detected the frogmen in the dark , and they were all killed or captured . The sudden capture of a bridge across the Rhine was front-page news in American newspapers . The unexpected availability of a bridgehead on the eastern side of the Rhine more than two weeks in advance of Operation Plunder allowed Allied high commander Dwight Eisenhower to alter his plans to end the war . The Allies were able to rapidly transport five divisions across the Rhine into the Ruhr , Germany 's industrial heartland . The bridge had endured months of aircraft bombing , direct artillery hits , near misses , and deliberate demolition attempts . It finally collapsed at 3:00 pm on 17 March , killing 33 American engineers and wounding 63 . But by then U.S. Army combat engineers had finished building a tactical steel treadway bridge and a heavy duty pontoon bridge followed by a Bailey bridge across the Rhine . over 25,000 troops crossed into germany before the americans broke out of the bridgehead on 25 march 1945 . This was 18 days after the bridge had been captured .

It was launched in support of her third studio album , `` Britney '' ( 2001 ) . The tour was promoted by Concerts West , marking the first time Spears did not tour with Clear Channel Entertainment . On September 21 , 2001 , a North American tour was announced that kicked off exactly two months later after various dates were postponed . In February 2002 , Spears announced a second leg of the tour . It was directed and choreographed by Wade Robson , who explained the main theme of the show was Spears 's coming of age and newfound independence . The stage was designed by Steve Cohen and Rob Brenner and was composed of a main stage and a B-stage , united by a runway . Inspired by Cleopatra 's barge , a flying device was developed so Spears could travel over the audience to the B-stage . The setlist was mostly composed by songs from the supporting album , as Spears felt they were more reflective of her personality . Songs from her previous two studio albums were also included in remixed form by Robson . The show was divided into seven segments with the last one being the encore . Spears opened the show hanging from a gyrating wheel ; it continued with Spears performing a medley of older hits , jumping in bungee cords from the flying device onto the stage and dancing in a jungle setting . Most of the performances were accompanied by extravagant special effects , including confetti , pyrotechnics , laser lights , and artificial fog and snow . In the encore , there was a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage ; this was considered one of the signature performances of the tour . During the 2002 leg , some changes were made ; several songs were remixed , and Spears premiered various unreleased songs which included `` Mystic Man '' . The show received acclaim from critics , who praised the show for being innovative and entertaining , while some dismissed it for taking the attention away from the music . According to `` Billboard '' , the 2001\u201302 dates in North America had an average of $ 803,683 in gross and 14,344 in attendance , bringing a total gross of $ 53,846,761 and 961,048 tickets sold in 66 shows , not including the Japanese sold-out show at Tokyo Dome in Tokyo for 60,000 fans . Overall , the Dream Within a Dream Tour grossed $ 56.8 million and sold more than 1 million of tickets in 68 shows . On July 27 , 2002 , Spears performed for 51,261 fans at Foro Sol stadium in Mexico City . The show grossed $ 2,251,379 and was the 37th on `` Pollstar '' s Top 200 Concert Grosses in North America . During the second show in Mexico , Spears left the stage after the sixth song due to a lightning storm ; the show was canceled and angered the audience . The tour was broadcast live on an HBO special on November 18 , 2001 , and went on to win an Emmy for Outstanding Technical Direction on the 2002 ceremony .

It installed the military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas , the first in a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian rulers in Guatemala . the guatemalan revolution began in 1944 , after a popular uprising toppled the military dictatorship of jorge ubico . Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo was elected president in Guatemala 's first democratic election . He introduced a minimum wage and near-universal suffrage , and turned Guatemala into a democracy . Ar\u00e9valo was succeeded by \u00c1rbenz in 1951 , who instituted land reforms which granted property to landless peasants . The Guatemalan Revolution was disliked by the United States federal government , which was predisposed during the Cold War to see it as communist . this perception grew after unk had been elected and formally legalized the communist guatemalan party of labour . The United Fruit Company ( UFC ) , whose highly profitable business had been affected by the end to exploitative labor <event> practices </event> in Guatemala , engaged in an influential lobbying campaign to persuade the U.S. to overthrow the Guatemalan government . U.S. President Harry Truman authorized Operation PBFORTUNE to topple \u00c1rbenz in 1952 ; although the operation was quickly aborted , it was a precursor to PBSUCCESS . Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected U.S. President in 1952 , promising to take a harder line against communism ; the links that his staff members John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles had to the UFC also predisposed them to act against the Guatemalan government . Additionally , the U.S. federal government drew exaggerated conclusions about the extent of communist influence among \u00c1rbenz 's advisers . Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953 . The CIA armed , funded , and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas . The coup was preceded by U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally . Castillo Armas ' force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954 , backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare . This included a radio station which broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion , claiming to be genuine news , as well as air bombings of Guatemala City and a naval blockade . The invasion force fared poorly militarily , and most of its offensives were defeated . However , psychological warfare and the fear of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army , which eventually refused to fight . \u00c1rbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion , before resigning on 27 June . Castillo Armas became president ten days later , following negotiations in San Salvador . Described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala , the coup was widely criticized internationally , and strengthened the long-lasting anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America . Attempting to justify the coup , the CIA launched Operation PBHISTORY , which sought evidence of Soviet influence in Guatemala among documents from the \u00c1rbenz era : the effort was a failure . Castillo Armas quickly assumed dictatorial powers , banning opposition parties , imprisoning and torturing political opponents , and reversing the social reforms of the revolution . Nearly four decades of civil war followed , as leftist guerrillas fought the series of U.S.-backed authoritarian regimes whose brutalities include a genocide of the Maya peoples .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of practices?\n\nOptions: (A) aad\n(B) afo\n(C) acz\n(D) aco"

It was later reported by witnesses , that the bomber dressed in a full-length burka had reportedly thrown a grenade after resisting <event> search </event> , to which then the bomber proceeded to detonate her explosives . Several police officials confirmed the bomber was a woman , as opposed to the more likely occurrence of a man wearing the burka as a disguise , in order to successfully conduct this suicide attack . It was also known that those in this crowd were predominantly displaced members of the Salarzai Tribe , which has supported Pakistan Army operations against the Pakistani Taliban within the Bajaur tribal regions . Those dozens of people injured in this suicide attack were apparently later taken to local hospitals via means of helicopters . Local Witnesses , including that of a government official at the main government hospital within the region , Dosti Rehman , claimed that he had personally counted some 40 bodies . However , there are concerns that the death toll could very likely rise , as the official stated that several of those injured , as a result of this suicide attack were apparently in a critical condition at the local hospitals . This particular bombing acts as one of a string of recent suicide attacks , which have occurred with near impunity , predominantly throughout Pakistan 's north-western , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province , of north-western Pakistan . No particular militant group has of yet claimed responsibility for this suicide attack , although the Pakistani Taliban are strong suspects . The Bajaur tribal region has reportedly seen several Pakistan Army military operations in recent years , however such suicide attacks still continue throughout the region with near impunity . The Pakistani Prime Minister , Yousaf Raza Gillani later condemned this suicide attack , and claimed that such military offensives would continue against the Pakistani Taliban . This statement will be met with a certain degree of approval in the U.S , as Pakistan has recently been pressured to launch a major ground-offensive in the nearby North Waziristan tribal region , in order to root-out and destroy the last major remaining safe-haven for Radical Islamist and Pakistani Taliban insurgents within the country . The U.N World Food Programme later suspended its food distribution activities in the Bajaur tribal region , as a security precaution to this suicide attack . This suicide bombing was strongly condemned by U.S president , Barack Obama . The Pakistani Taliban later claimed responsibility for this suicide attack .

The intervention initially consisted of a bombing campaign on Houthi rebels and later saw a naval blockade and the deployment of ground forces into Yemen . The Saudi-led coalition has attacked the positions of the Houthi militia , and loyalists of the former President of Yemen , Ali Abdullah Saleh , allegedly supported by Iran ( see Iran\u2013Saudi Arabia proxy conflict ) . Fighter jets and ground forces from Egypt , Morocco , Jordan , Sudan , the United Arab Emirates , Kuwait , Qatar , Bahrain , and Academi ( formerly Blackwater ) took part in the operation . Djibouti , Eritrea , and Somalia made their airspace , territorial waters , and military bases available to the coalition . The United States provided intelligence and logistical support , including aerial refueling and search-and-rescue for downed coalition pilots . It also accelerated the sale of weapons to coalition states . The US and Britain have deployed their military personnel in the command and control centre responsible for Saudi-led air strikes on Yemen , having access to lists of targets . The war has received widespread criticism and had a dramatic worsening effect on Yemen 's humanitarian situation , that reached the level of a `` humanitarian disaster '' or `` humanitarian catastrophe '' , and some have labelled it as a genocide . In 2019 , the conflict 's status was described as a `` military stalemate for years '' .\n\nQuestion: Only considering the given document, what is the event type of charter?\n\nOptions: (A) abj\n(B) aci\n(C) aaq\n(D) adh"
