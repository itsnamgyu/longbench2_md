Shooting functions used frequently
Features of this camera


Introduction of functions
GB
11
DRO/Auto HDR (68)
[D-Range Opt.]: By dividing the image into small areas, the camera 
analyses the contrast of light and shadow between the subject and the 
background, and produces an image with the optimal brightness and 
gradation.
[Auto HDR]: Shoots 3 images with different exposures, and then overlays 
these images to create an image with rich gradation.
Creative Style (67)
You can select the desired style from among 13 styles.
You can also adjust certain image factors, such as exposure, using the 
selected style as the base.
Movie recording with manual adjustments (63)
You can adjust the exposure in P, A, S, or M mode even when shooting 
movies.
Display information (38)

Notes on using your camera
Shooting procedure
This camera has 2 modes for monitoring 
subjects: the monitor mode using the 
monitor, and the viewfinder mode using the 
viewfinder.
Functions built into this camera
• This manual describes 1080 60i-
compatible devices and 1080 50i-
compatible devices. 
To check whether your camera is a 1080 
60i-compatible device or 1080 50i-
compatible device, check for the 
following marks on the bottom of the 
camera. 
1080 60i-compatible device: 60i 
1080 50i-compatible device: 50i
• This camera is compatible with 1080 60p 
or 50p-format movies. Unlike standard 
recording modes up to now, which record 
in an interlacing method, this camera 
records using a progressive method. This 
increases the resolution, and provides a 
smoother, more realistic image.
Creating an image database file
If you insert a memory card that does not 
contain an image database file into the 
camera and turn on the power, the camera 
automatically creates an image database 
file using some of the memory card’s 
capacity.
The process may take a long time and you 
cannot operate the camera until the process 
is completed. If a database file error occurs, 
export all images to your computer using 
PlayMemories Home™, and then format 
the memory card using the camera.
No compensation for damaged 
content or recording failure
Sony cannot compensate for failure to 
record or loss or damage of recorded 
content due to a malfunction of the camera 
or recording media, etc.
Back up recommendation
To avoid the data loss, always copy (back 
up) data to other media.
Notes on the monitor, electronic 
viewfinder, lens, and image sensor
• The monitor and electronic viewfinder 
are manufactured using extremely high-
precision technology, and over 99.99% 
of the pixels are operational for effective 
use. However, there may be some small 
black dots and/or bright dots (white, red, 
blue or green in color) that constantly 
appear on the monitor and electronic 
viewfinder. These dots are normal due to 
the manufacturing process and do not 
affect the images in any way.
• Do not hold the camera by the monitor.
• Do not expose the camera to sunlight or 
shoot sunward for a long time. The 
internal mechanism may be damaged. If 
sunlight is focused on a nearby object, it 
may cause a fire.
• There is a magnet on the back and around 
the rotating shaft of the hinge part of the 
monitor. Do not bring anything that is 
easily affected by a magnet, such as 
floppy disks or credit cards, near the 
monitor.
• Images may trail across on the screen in a 
cold location. This is not a malfunction.
When turning on the camera in a cold 
location, the screen may become 
temporarily dark. When the camera 
warms up, the screen will function 
normally.
Screen language
You can select the language displayed 
on the screen using the menu (page 43). 


Notes on using your camera
Before use
GB

• The recorded image may be different 
from the image you monitored before 
recording.
Notes on shooting with the 
viewfinder
This camera is equipped with an Organic 
Electro-Luminescence viewfinder with 
high resolution and high contrast. This 
viewfinder achieves a wide viewing angle 
and a long eye relief. This camera is 
designed to provide an easily viewable 
viewfinder by appropriately balancing 
various elements.
• The image may be slightly distorted near 
the corners of the viewfinder. This is not 
a malfunction. When you want to see the 
full composition with all its details, you 
can also use the monitor.
• If you pan the camera while looking into 
the viewfinder or move your eyes around, 
the image in the viewfinder may be 
distorted or the color of the image may 
change. This is a characteristic of the lens 
or display device and is not a 
malfunction. When you shoot an image, 
we recommend that you look at the 
center area of the viewfinder.
• When shooting with the viewfinder, you 
may experience symptoms such as 
eyestrain, fatigue, travel sickness, or 
nausea. We recommend that you take a 
break at regular intervals when you are 
shooting with the viewfinder.
The required length or frequency of the 
break may differ depending on the 
individuals, so you are advised to decide 
at your own discretion. In case you may 
feel uncomfortable, refrain from using 
the viewfinder until your condition 
recovers, and consult your doctor as 
necessary.
Notes on recording for long periods 
of time
• Depending on the camera and battery 
temperature, you may be unable to record 
movies or the power may turn off 
automatically to protect the camera.
A message will be displayed on the 
screen before the power turns off or you 
can no longer record movies. In this case, 
leave the power off and wait until the 
camera and battery temperature goes 
down. If you turn on the power without 
letting the camera and battery cool 
enough, the power may turn off again or 
you may be unable to record movies.
• Under high ambient temperatures, the 
temperature of the camera rises quickly.
• When the temperature of the camera 
rises, the image quality may deteriorate. 
It is recommended that you wait until the 
temperature of the camera drops before 
continuing to shoot.
• The surface of the camera may get warm. 
This is not a malfunction.
Notes on importing AVCHD movies to 
a computer
When importing AVCHD movies to a 
computer, download and use the software 
PlayMemories Home from the following 
website:
www.sony.net/pm/
Notes on the flash
• Do not carry the camera by the flash unit, 
or use excessive force on it.
• If water, dust or sand get into the open 
flash unit, it may cause a malfunction.
• Be sure to keep your fingers out of the 
way when you press the flash down.

Checking the number of images and 
recordable time of movies
Notes
• When “0” (the number of recordable images) flashes in yellow, the memory card is 
full. Replace the memory card with another one, or delete images from the current 
memory card (pages 42, 62).
• When “NO CARD” (the number of recordable images) flashes in yellow, it means 
no memory card has been inserted. Insert a memory card.
The table below shows the approximate number of images that can be 
recorded on a memory card formatted with this camera. The values are 
defined using Sony standard memory cards for testing. The values may vary 
depending on the shooting conditions and the type of memory card used.

– Continuous movie shooting: Battery life based on non-stop shooting until the limit 
(29 minutes) has been reached, and then continued by pressing the MOVIE button 
again. Other functions, such as zooming, are not operated.
The table below shows the approximate total recording times using a 
memory card formatted with this camera.

(h (hour), m (minute))
• Continuous shooting is possible for approximately 29 minutes (a product 
specification limit). The maximum continuous recording time of an MP4 
(12M) format movie is about 20 minutes (limited by the 2 GB file size 
restriction).
Notes
• The recordable time of movies varies because the camera is equipped with VBR 
(Variable Bit-Rate), which automatically adjusts image quality depending on the 
shooting scene. When you record a fast-moving subject, the image is clearer but the 
recordable time is shorter because more memory is required for recording.
The recordable time also varies depending on the shooting conditions, the subject or 
the image quality/size settings.
• The values shown are not for continuous recording time.

• The recording time may differ depending on shooting conditions and the memory 
card used.
• When 
 is indicated, stop recording the movie. The temperature inside the camera 
has increased to an unacceptable level.
• For details on movie playback, see page 60.
• It requires a lot of power to perform high quality movie recording or continuous 
shooting using the image sensor. Therefore, if you continue to shoot, the temperature 
inside the camera will rise, especially that of the image sensor. In such cases, the 
camera turns off automatically since higher temperatures affect the quality of the 
images or affect the internal mechanism of the camera.
• The duration of time available for movie recording is as follows when the camera 
starts recording after the power of the camera has been turned off for a while. (The 
following values indicate the continuous time from when the camera starts recording 
until the camera stops recording.)
• The duration of time available for movie recording varies with the temperature or 
condition of the camera before you start recording. If you frequently recompose or 
shoot images after the power is turned on, the temperature inside the camera will rise 
and the recording time available will be shorter.
• If the camera stops recording due to the temperature, leave it for several minutes 
with the power turned off. Start recording after the temperature inside the camera 
drops fully.
• If you observe the following points, the recording time will be longer.
– Keep the camera out of direct sunlight.
– Turn the camera off when it is not being used.
• The maximum size of a movie file is about 2 GB. When the file size is about 2 GB, 
recording stops automatically when [
 File Format] is set to [MP4], and a new 
movie file is created automatically when [
 File Format] is set to [AVCHD].
• The maximum continuous recording time is 29 minutes.

Lens
*
The values for equivalent 35mm-format focal length and angle of view are based 
on Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera equipped with an APS-C sized image 
sensor.
** Minimum focus is the shortest distance from the image sensor to the subject.
• This lens is equipped with a distance encoder. The distance encoder allows more 
accurate measurement (ADI) by using a flash with ADI functionality.
• Depending on the lens mechanism, the focal length may change with any change of 
the shooting distance. The focal length assumes the lens is focused at infinity.
• The infinity position provides for some adjustment to compensate for focus shift 
caused by change in temperature. To shoot a subject at infinite distance in MF mode, 
use the viewfinder and set focus.
On focal length
The picture angle of this camera is narrower than that of a 35 mm-format 
camera. You can find the approximate equivalent of the focal length of a 
35 mm-format camera, and shoot with the same picture angle, by 
increasing the focal length of your lens by half.
For example, by using a 50 mm lens, you can get the approximate 
equivalent of a 75 mm lens of a 35 mm-format camera.
