Published on MuseScore (https://musescore.org)
This handbook is for MuseScore version 3.0 and above. It is maintained and translated by the MuseScore community.
Find out how you can help
. In case of doubt consult the 
English online version of the handbook
.
(If you are still using MuseScore 2.x, you can access 
the old handbook
).
Getting started
This chapter helps you to install and run MuseScore for the first time. It will introduce you to the various learning and help
resources.
Learning MuseScore
MuseScore provides a number of learning resources to help the new user get started.
Tours
When you run MuseScore for the first time, the 
Startup Wizard appears to help you set up some basic features of the
software. One of these features is called Tours, and, as the name suggests, gives you a guided tour of the program.
To activate this feature, on the 
Tours page of the Startup Wizard, tick "Yes" in response to "Would you like to see
these tours?"
This will allow the 
Tour to run when the program opens, introducing you to the main features of the user interface.
To end the tour: press the 
Close button.
To stop the Tour showing when you open MuseScore
: Uncheck "Continue taking Tours".
To enable the Tour again (when program reopens): Select Help→Tours→Show Tours.
To see all the Tours again (when program reopens): Select Help→Tours→Reset Tours.
Currently offered tours:
Introduction to User Interface.
Entering notes and rests in a score.
Entering symbols from a palette.
Navigating the score with Timeline.
Navigating the score with keyboard.
Entering multimeasure rests.
Autoplace positioning of symbols.
Modify properties with Inspector.
Selecting elements.
Add and edit lines in score.
Getting Started score
The interactive Getting Started score is a practical introduction to the basics of entering a score. When you open
MuseScore for the first time, it will be displayed in the main window of the Start Center: just click to open it. Follow the
instructions written in blue, and you will be led through the basic steps of score writing.
Note: If you don't see the Getting Started score, you can find it in the right hand panel of the Start Center. Click the right
19


or left arrows to browse through the options until it appears.
Video tutorials
MuseScore offers a full set of instructions videos, each covering a specific subject. You can access these videos in
several ways.
From the MuseScore homepage at MuseScore.org: 
Support/Tutorials
In the Start Center: browse to the Videos page in the right-hand panel.
Use the list of links in the 
Videos section (below).
Look up directly by searching for "MuseScore in Minutes" on 
You Tube

In the Tutorials
 section on musescore.org you will also find tutorials on more specific topics (e.g. MuseScore Drumline).

Get Support
If you experience a problem while working with MuseScore, there are several ways to get help and support.
Handbook
To access the Handbook:
From the MuseScore
 website: select Support → Handbook
 from the menu.
From the MuseScore program: select 
Help → Online Handbook
 from the menu.
You can browse through the Handbook using the menus, or do a 
search
.
Context help
If you select an element in your score and press 
F1, a webpage opens displaying a list of links associated with that
element in the Handbook
.
Forums
MuseScore offers a number of on-line 
Forums
 for user collaboration. You may be able to find an answer here to your
problem among the existing posts. A general search
 of the website will return a list of relevant hits to all forums and the
Handbook.
How To's
Some tasks require the use of several different techniques. These can be difficult to find an answer for in the Handbook.
Solutions for these may be found in the 
How To's
Post a question
If you cannot find the answer to your problem, you can ask a question in the 
Support and bug reports
 forum.
When you post your question:
Try to be as precise as you can, when you describe what you want to do, and which steps you have already tried.
Attach the score that shows the problem. This will make it much easier for others to understand the problem — use
the "File attachments" option at the bottom of the page, just above the Save and Preview buttons.
You may format the text using 
these tips
.

Report a bug
If you encounter something you think is a bug, the first step is to post it in the 
Support and bug reports
 forum. This will
allow others to help check if it is a genuine bug, and to advise workarounds, so you can continue your scorewriting. You
will find more details on this in Bug reports and Feature requests.

Append ALLUSERS=1 if you want to install it for all users of the system rather than just the current one.
Uninstall
You can uninstall MuseScore from the menu by selecting 
Start→All Programs→MuseScore 3→Uninstall MuseScore; or via
Windows' Control Panel. Note that this will not remove your scores nor your MuseScore settings.
Troubleshooting
The installer might be blocked by the system. If you don't manage to install MuseScore, right-click the downloaded file
and click Properties. If there is a message "This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this
computer", click on "Unblock", "OK" and double-click on the downloaded file again.

Install on macOS
Install
You will find the DMG (disk image) file on the 
download
 page of the MuseScore website. Click on the macOS link to
start the download. When the download is complete, double-click the DMG file to mount the disk image.
27


Drag and drop the MuseScore icon to the Applications folder icon.
If you are not logged in as administrator, macOS may ask for a password: click 
Authenticate and enter your password to
proceed.
When the application has finished copying, eject the disk image. You can now launch MuseScore from the Applications
folder, Spotlight, or Launchpad.
Note: As of macOS 10.15 "Catalina", the system has to be told to permit MuseScore to be allowed to access user parts of
the file system. The first time you use it on Catalina, it will ask you if you wish to permit it; of course, answer "yes", but if
you bypass this by accident, you can set it via System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Privacy > Files and Folders.
Unlock with your Admin credentials, then navigate to MuseScore (whichever version(s) you have and want), add it or them
to the list of apps, and select "Documents" and "Downloads" folders, or as you prefer.
Uninstall
Simply delete MuseScore from Applications folder (Admin access will be required to do that, however).
Install with Apple Remote Desktop
You can deploy MuseScore to multiple computers with the "Copy" feature of ARD. Since MuseScore is a self-contained
application you can simply copy the application to the '/Application' folder on the target machines. It is also possible to
install multiple versions of the application as long as their names differ.
Install on Linux
MuseScore packages for various Linux distros are available from the 
download
 page. The easiest to install is the
AppImage, which can be run on any Linux distribution, but a range of other specialist 
packages are available if you prefer.
Building from source
 is another possibility.
AppImage
AppImages
 can run on virtually any Linux distribution: all the files needed are contained within the AppImage itself, just
like a portable App. The following procedure allows you to run the MuseScore AppImage on your system:
Step 1: Download
28


AppImages come in different versions. Make sure you download the right one for your system. To check the architecture
of your system:
1. Open the Terminal.
2. Type
    arch
 
or
    uname -m
 
The output will be something like "
i686", "x86_64" or "armv7":
i686 (or similar) - 32-bit Intel/AMD processor (found on older machines).
x86_64 (or similar) - 64-bit Intel/AMD processor (modern laptop and desktop computers, most Chromebooks).
armv7 (or later) - ARM processor (phones & tablets, Raspberry Pi 2/3 running Ubuntu Mate, some Chromebooks,
usually 32-bit at present).
Go to the download
 page and find the AppImage that best matches your architecture. Once downloaded, the file will be
named "MuseScore-X.Y.Z-$(arch).AppImage".
Step 2: Give the file permission to execute
There are two ways to do this:
From the File Manager:
1. Right-click on the AppImage and select "Properties".
2. Open the "Permissions" tab.
3. Enable the option labelled "Allow executing file as a program".
The process may be slightly different in other file managers.
From the Terminal:
This command works on all Linux systems (
Note: The code below assumes that the AppImage is in the Downloads folder.
If not the case then amend the file path accordingly):
    cd ~/Downloads
    chmod u+x MuseScore*.AppImage
 
Step 3: Run the AppImage
To run the program, just double-click it.
Note: You can move the AppImage to wherever it is most convenient. And to "uninstall" it, just delete it.
Install the AppImage
The above procedure allows you to run the MuseScore AppImage but doesn't integrate it with the rest of your system: it
doesn't appear in your App menu, and MuseScore files are neither associated with the program nor do they have the
correct icon on them.
To remedy this, you need to actually install the program as follows:
1. Open the Terminal.
2. Type the following (Note: The code below assumes that the AppImage is in the Downloads folder. If not the case
then amend the file path accordingly):
    cd ~/Desktop
    ./MuseScore*.AppImage install
 
Or, alternatively, you can combine the operation into one command:
    ~/desktop/MuseScore*.AppImage install
 
Use the "--help" and "man" options to get more information about the available command line options:
    ./MuseScore*.AppImage --help   # displays a complete list of command line options
    ./MuseScore*.AppImage man      # displays the manual page (explains what the options do)

Distribution Packages
Debian
(Ideally before, otherwise while or after) installing MuseScore itself, you can install one or more soundfont packages (if
none is installed, the dependencies will pull in a suitable soundfont automatically):
musescore-general-soundfont-small: the standard MuseScore_General soundfont in SF3 format, as shipped with
MuseScore for other operating systems
musescore-general-soundfont: the MuseScore_General HQ soundfont in SF3 format, as available via the Extensions
manager
musescore-general-soundfont-lossless: the MuseScore_General HQ soundfont in uncompressed SF2 format: takes up a 
lot
more space on your hard disc, but offers the highest sound quality and extremely fast startup times
fluidr3mono-gm-soundfont: the old soundfont shipped with MuseScore 2.0 (antecessor of MuseScore_General), use only
if resources are very tight or you need it
timgm6mb-soundfont: the old soundfont shipped with MuseScore 1.3; cannot substitute the others; use only if you need
it; extremely tiny
Note: only the MuseScore_General soundfont (HQ or regular) supports single-note dynamics (SND), and you need 
at
least version 0.1.6 of those soundfonts (from unstable or backports) for SND support!
The command sudo update-alternatives --config MuseScore_General.sf3 can be used at any time to select the default soundfont
used by MuseScore if you install more than one (note timgm6mb-soundfont cannot be selected here).
Then, install the musescore3 package for MuseScore 3.x (the current stable version) or 
musescore for MuseScore 2.x (there’s
also musescore-snapshot for the unstable developer preview). The packages are available in the following distributions:
musescore3: sid (unstable), bullseye (testing/Debian 11), buster-backports (stable/Debian 10), stretch-backports-
sloppy (oldstable/Debian 9)
musescore: buster (stable/Debian 10), stretch-backports (oldstable/Debian 9), jessie-backports-sloppy
(oldoldstable/Debian 8)
musescore-snapshot: experimental (usable on unstable)
See https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/
 for instructions on how to add an official Debian backports repository to
your system and install packages from there.
Note: without the appropriate backports, older versions may be available: MuseScore 2.0.3 on stretch, MuseScore 1.3 on
jessie. Using the latest 2.3.2 version for 2.x-format scores instead (or conversion to 3.x) is strongly recommended!
Fedora
1. Import the GPG key:
su
rpm --import http://prereleases.musescore.org/linux/Fedora/RPM-GPG-KEY-Seve
 
2. Go to the download
 page of the MuseScore website. Click on the link for the stable Fedora download and choose
the correct rpm package for your architecture.
3. Depending on your architecture, use one of the two sets of commands to install MuseScore
for arch i386
su
yum localinstall musescore-X.Y-1.fc10.i386.rpm
 
for arch x86_64
su
yum localinstall musescore-X.Y-1.fc10.x86_64.rpm
 
If you have difficulty with sound, see Fedora 11 and sound
.

KDE neon 18.04 (bionic)
The KDE neon packages are built on a different 
repository
 than the normal Ubuntu PPAs, as this is the only way for us
to build packages for KDE neon. Due to limitations of the OpenSuSE Buildservice used, this currently only provides
amd64 (64-bit PC) packages, no ARM packages (Slimbook or Pinebook remix).
30


All commands listed below must be entered in a terminal, in 
one line each.
1. Remove the Ubuntu PPAs (all three of them) from your system if you’ve ever configured it before. This is generally
in /etc/apt/sources.list or one of the files below 
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/; if you used add-apt-repository (the recommended way) to
enable the PPA, you can remove them with: sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mscore-ubuntu-ubuntu-mscore*
KDE neon is not compatible with the Ubuntu PPAs!
2. Install a few standard packages (usually they are already there, but just in case they aren’t) to be able to securely
download the repository signature key:
  sudo apt-get install wget ca-certificates
 
3. Download (via secure HTTPS connection) and install the repository signing key:
  wget -O - https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/mirabile:/mscore/bionic-neon/Release.key | sudo apt-key add -
 
4. Enable the repository:
  echo deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/mirabile:/mscore/bionic-neon ./ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mscore.list
 
5. Make the new packages available:
  sudo apt-get update
 
Now, it’s time to install one or more soundfont packages (ideally install the one you want 
before installing MuseScore):
musescore-general-soundfont-small: the standard MuseScore_General soundfont in SF3 format, as shipped with
MuseScore for other operating systems
musescore-general-soundfont: the MuseScore_General HQ soundfont in SF3 format, as available via the Extensions
manager
musescore-general-soundfont-lossless: the MuseScore_General HQ soundfont in uncompressed SF2 format: takes up a 
lot
more space on your hard disc, but offers the highest sound quality and extremely fast startup times
fluidr3mono-gm-soundfont: the old soundfont shipped with MuseScore 2.0 (antecessor of MuseScore_General), use only
if resources are very tight or you need it
timgm6mb-soundfont: the old soundfont shipped with MuseScore 1.3; cannot substitute the others; use only if you need
it; extremely tiny
If you skip this step, a suitable soundfont will be automatically installed when you install MuseScore itself in the final step.
Note: only the MuseScore_General soundfont (HQ or regular) supports single-note dynamics (SND), and you need 
at
least version 0.1.6 of those soundfonts (from our repository) for SND support!
The command sudo update-alternatives --config MuseScore_General.sf3 can be used at any time to select the default soundfont
used by MuseScore if you install more than one (note timgm6mb-soundfont cannot be selected here).
Finally, you can install the latest stable version of MuseScore with 
sudo apt-get install musescore3 and the old 2.x version with
sudo apt-get install musescore (the musescore-snapshot package with an instable developer preview is also available).
Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, …
WARNING: these instructions are not for KDE neon users (see above)!
MuseScore 2.x (the old version) is available from 18.10 (cosmic) to 19.10 (eoan) out of the box. Older Ubuntu releases
carry older versions (18.04 (bionic) has 2.1, 16.04 (xenial) has 2.0, 14.04 (trusty) and 12.04 (precise) have 1.3 and 1.2,
respectively). Similar to the Debian instructions, we recommend using the latest 2.3.2 version for old 2.x scores instead,
or migrating those scores to MuseScore 3.
Besides the versions supplied by the distribution itself, the MuseScore Debian packager provides newer versions of
MuseScore for older Ubuntu releases in official PPAs (package archives).
Please activate the Stable releases of MuseScore 3
 repository on your system and then install the 
musescore3 package,
available for all releases from 18.04 (bionic) onwards. (It is not feasible to provide MuseScore 3 for older Ubuntu releases,
as those lack the minimum Qt version required by MuseScore 3.)
If you wish to install the older MuseScore 2, activate the 
Stable releases of MuseScore 2
 PPA and install the 
musescore
package, available for 12.04 (precise), 14.04 (trusty), 16.04 (xenial), and 18.04 (bionic) onwards. (Some intermediate
releases may have slightly older MuseScore versions still available, but it’s best to update to the next LTS.) On the
ancient 12.04 (precise) and 14.04 (trusty) releases, this will upgrade the Qt library in your system, which may break
unrelated software (and on 12.04 even the C++ libraries are upgraded), mind you; best to upgrade to a newer LTS.
There’s also a MuseScore Nightly Builds (unstable development builds)
 PPA, from which the daring can install the
31


musescore-snapshot package, for LTS, that is, 18.04 (bionic) only.
WARNING: these PPAs are only suitable for Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu/… but not for Debian or KDE neon!
As with Debian, you can install one or more soundfont packages (ideally install the one you want 
before installing
MuseScore, but if you don’t, a suitable one will be installed alongside MuseScore):
musescore-general-soundfont-small: the standard MuseScore_General soundfont in SF3 format, as shipped with
MuseScore for other operating systems
musescore-general-soundfont: the MuseScore_General HQ soundfont in SF3 format, as available via the Extensions
manager
musescore-general-soundfont-lossless: the MuseScore_General HQ soundfont in uncompressed SF2 format: takes up a 
lot
more space on your hard disc, but offers the highest sound quality and extremely fast startup times
fluidr3mono-gm-soundfont: the old soundfont shipped with MuseScore 2.0 (antecessor of MuseScore_General), use only
if resources are very tight or you need it
timgm6mb-soundfont: the old soundfont shipped with MuseScore 1.3; cannot substitute the others; use only if you need
it; extremely tiny
Note: only the MuseScore_General soundfont (HQ or regular) supports single-note dynamics (SND), and you need 
at
least version 0.1.6 of those soundfonts (possibly from the PPA) for SND support!
The command sudo update-alternatives --config MuseScore_General.sf3 can be used at any time to select the default soundfont
used by MuseScore if you install more than one (note timgm6mb-soundfont cannot be selected here).

Basics
The previous →"Getting started" chapter guided you through the 
installation process.
This chapter shows you how to set up a new score using the MuseScore Wizard, and how to enter and edit basic music
notation. The various parts of the program window are described—toolbars, Inspector, palettes etc.—as well as viewing
and navigation options.
Create a new score
To create a new score, open the 
New Score Wizard (see Create new score, below): this can also be accessed via the
Start Center.
Start Center
This is the window that is displayed when you open MuseScore for the very first time:
To open the Start Center (if not already visible), use any of the following options:
Press F4.
From the menu bar, select 
File→Start Center...
To stop the Start Center from showing up when you open MuseScore:
From the menu bar, select 
Edit→Preferences... (Mac: MuseScore→Preferences...) and uncheck "Show start center" in the
Program Start section of the General tab.
From the Start Center you can:
Create a new score (by clicking on the icon with the plus sign).
View thumbnails of previously-opened scores: click on a thumbnail to open it.
Open a score from your computer's file system: click on 
Open a score ...
Open the "Getting Started" tutorial score. Use the arrow buttons in the right-hand pane to access the link.
Search sheet music on musecore.com
.
Access various other facilities (see right-hand pane).
Create new score
To open the New Score Wizard when the Start Center is not open, use one of the following options:
Click on the New Score icon in the toolbar on the top left of the window;
Use keyboard shortcut Ctrl+N (Mac: Cmd+N);
From the menu, select 
File→New....
Enter score information
35


Step 1: Enter score information.
Enter the title, composer or any other information as shown above, then click on 
Next >. This step is optional: you can also
add this information after the score has been created (see Vertical frame).
Choose template file
Step 2: Choose template file.
In the left column is a list of solo, ensemble and orchestral 
templates, divided into categories according to musical styles.
If you have previously stored any custom templates in your user templates folder, these are displayed under the heading,
"Custom Templates". You can also use the 
Search bar (top left) to find specific templates.
To choose a score template:
Click on the name of a score template to select it, then click 
Next >; alternatively, just double-click the score template
name. This will automatically take you to the next page of the Wizard (see Choose key signature and tempo, below).
If you wish to create a score template from scratch, click on "
Choose Instruments" (under "General"), then click 
Next
36


>; alternatively, just double-click "Choose instruments."
Choose instruments (or voice parts)
The Choose Instruments window is divided into two columns:
The left column contains a list of instruments or voice parts to choose from. This list is categorized into instrument
families and clicking a category shows the full list of instruments in each family.
The default entry is "Common instruments" but you can choose from others as well, including "Jazz instruments" and
"Early music". There is a search box at the bottom of the instrument window: typing the name of an instrument there
will search for it in "All instruments".
The right column starts off empty, but will eventually contain a list of instruments for your new score in the order
that they will appear.
Add instruments
To add instruments to the score, use any of the following options:
Select one or more instruments in the left column and click 
Add.
Double-click an instrument in the left column.
The instrument names, and their associated staff lines, now appear in the list of instruments in the right column. You can
add more instruments or voice parts, as needed. Each instrument added in this way is allocated its own Mixer channel.
Once an instrument track is added to your score, you can edit its sound features by using the 
Mixer's track area. You will
find a vertical panel in the Mixer menu for that new instrument in the lower half of the panel, next to the volume (master
Gain) slider. All instruments in the score will have their own panel, with their names at the bottom of the panel. If you can't
see the names, drag the vertical scroll bar downward until the instrument track labels are visible. Then just click on a
panel, and edit the volume, name, instrument choice, chorus, reverb, etc. The changes will take effect immediately"
Note: If you want staves to share the same instrument, use the 
Add staff or Add linked staff commands instead (see
below).
Add Staff / Add Linked Staff
To add a staff to an existing instrument in the score:
1. Select a staff of the instrument in the score list on the right-hand side (e.g. see "Staff 1" in the image below). Click
Add Staff or Add Linked Staff.
2. Adjust the Staff type, if applicable.

Step 3: Choose key signature (and tempo).
Select the desired key signature, then click 
Next > to continue. Prior to version 3.5, you can also set the tempo here.
Choose time signature, tempo, pickup measure, and number of measures
Step 4: Choose time signature etc.
Here, you can set:
The initial time signature.
A pickup measure (anacrusis or upbeat measure), and its duration.
The initial number of measures in the score (the default is 32, but you can 
add/remove measures from the score edit
window).
Tempo (prior to version 3.5, this is set on the 
Choose key signature (and tempo) page instead).
Click Finish to create your new score.
39


Adjustments to score after creation
Any settings you make in the New Score Wizard can always be changed when you start work on the score itself:
Add / delete / adjust measures
Insert measures.
Append measures.
Delete measures.
Create a pickup measure.
Add/edit text
Add text (Text basics).
Edit text.
Change instrument set-up
To add, delete, or change the order of instruments:
From the menu, select 
Edit→Instruments...; or use the keyboard shortcut, 
I. This opens the Instruments dialog which is
virtually identical to the Choose Instruments dialog in the New Score Wizard (see above).
See also Change instrument (Staff properties).
Hide a staff
To hide a staff permanently: Open the Instruments dialog (I) and untick the "Visible" box for that staff.
To hide a staff under certain conditions: See the "Hide" options in the 
Score dialog, and Staff Properties.
Adjust layout and formatting
To adjust the distance between staves and systems, set page margins etc., see 
Layout and formatting.
Templates
A Template is simply a standard MuseScore file that has been stored in one of two "templates" folders: any files in these
folders are automatically displayed on the "Choose template file" page of the New Score Wizard. Two templates folders
are created by default:
A system templates folder.
A user templates folder.
System templates folder
This folder contains the templates installed with MuseScore and should 
not be modified. It can be found in the following
locations:
Windows: Usually at 
C:\Program Files\MuseScore 3\templates or C:\Program Files (x86)\MuseScore 3\templates (Actually
%ProgramFiles%\MuseScore 3\templates or %ProgramFiles(x86)%\MuseScore 3\templates, respectively) .
Linux: Under /usr/share/mscore-xxx if you installed from the package manager. If you compiled MuseScore on Linux yourself,
then look under /usr/local/share/mscore-xxx (with xxx being the version you are using).
MacOS: Under /Applications/MuseScore 3.app/Contents/Resources/templates.
User templates folder
Any templates that you create for future use should be stored here. Once in the user "templates" folder, they will
automatically appear on the "Choose template file" page of the New Score Wizard—under the heading "Custom
Templates".
The default location of the user templates folder is as follows:
Windows: %HOMEPATH%\Documents\MuseScore3\Templates.
MacOS and Linux: ~/Documents/MuseScore3/Templates.
To configure the location of your private templates folder:
From the menu, select 
Edit→Preferences...→General.

Video tutorial: MuseScore in Minutes: Lesson 1 - Score Setup
Note input
MuseScore allows you to enter music notation from 
any of four input devices: computer keyboard, mouse, MIDI keyboard,
or virtual piano keyboard. The default input mode is step-time, in which notes or rests are entered one at a time.
However, other input modes are also available.
After exiting the New Score Wizard, your new score will consist of a series of measures filled with measure rests:
As you enter notes in a measure, the measure rests are changed to appropriate rests to fill the remainder of the measure:
Notes of different durations on the same beat are entered by using 
voices:
Basic note entry
This section introduces you to the basics of entering notes and rests in 
step-time from a computer keyboard. It is also
recommended that you work through the tutorial, "Getting Started: An introduction to note entry in MuseScore". This is
available from the Start Center.
Step 1. Select a starting position
Select a starting position for note input by clicking on a note or rest, or 
selecting a measure, with the mouse. If you don't
select a starting point, the cursor automatically defaults to the beginning of the score when you enter Note Input mode
("Step 2" below).
Step 2. Enter Note Input mode
To enter Note Input mode, use either of the following options:
Click on the "N" icon (on the extreme left of the 
Note Input toolbar).
Press N on your computer keyboard.
To exit Note Input mode, use any of the following options:
Press N.
Press Esc.
Click on the toolbar "N" button.
Step 3. Select a duration
Still in Note Input mode, select a note duration using either of the following:
Click on a corresponding note icon in the 
Note Input toolbar (directly above the document window):
Enter the keyboard shortcut for that duration (see 
below).
41


Step 4. Enter the note or rest
To enter a note pitch from A–G, simply press the corresponding letter on your computer keyboard or place it using
your mouse/touchpad (and a 'normal' left-click).
To enter a rest, press 0 (zero) or right-click your mouse.
This method of entry also works if you are 
not in Note Input mode—as long as you have a note/rest selected, or the score
is newly-created (in which case note entry will default to the beginning).
Select a note/rest duration
The following keyboard shortcuts are used to select note/rest duration in 
Note Input mode:

Input devices
Music notation can be entered by:
Computer keyboard.
Mouse.
MIDI keyboard.
Virtual Piano Keyboard.
Any combination of the above.
Computer keyboard
This section expands on "Basic note entry" (see above) and introduces you to the full range of commands available for
entering notes or rests from the computer keyboard.
Enter notes/rests
You can enter a note by typing the corresponding letter on your keyboard. Thus, after entering 
Note Input mode, type: 5 C
D E F G A B C.
Note: When you enter a note using the keyboard, MuseScore places it closest to the previous note entered (above or
below).
To enter a rest, type "0" (zero). Thus, after entering 
Note Input mode, type: 5 C D 0 E.
Note: The duration selected in the toolbar applies to both notes 
and rests.
42


If you want to enter a dotted note, press . (period/full stop) after selecting the duration.
For example, after entering Note Input mode, type: 5 . C 4 D E F G A.
If you want to enter a tuplet (such as a triplet): see 
Tuplets.
If you want to write music with two or more simultaneous lines of independent melody on the same staff, see 
Voices.
Move notes up/down
To move a note up or down by a semitone:
Press the ↑ or ↓ arrow.
To move a note up or down diatonically:
Press Alt+Shift+↑ or Alt+Shift+↓.
To move a note up or down by one octave:
Press Ctrl+↑ (Mac: Cmd+↑) or Ctrl+↓ (Mac: Cmd+↓).
Add accidentals
When a note is moved up or down with an arrow key (see above), any accidental required is automatically generated by
the program. Accidentals can also be added manually—see Accidentals.
Chords
If you want to add a chord note 
above your previous entry:
Press and hold Shift, then enter a note from 
A to G.
Thus, typing C, D, Shift+F, Shift+A, E, F results in:
To add a note at a specific 
interval above or below one or more notes:
1. Ensure that one or more notes are 
selected;
2. Use one of the following options:
From the menu, select 
Add→Intervals and choose an interval from the list;
Press Alt+1-9 for intervals above (intervals below are also possible by adding relevant 
shortcuts to the list in
Preferences).
Note: To create chords with notes of different durations, you will need to use more than one 
Voice.
Insert notes
Normally, when you enter music in MuseScore, any existing notes or rests are overwritten. There are, however, several
ways to insert notes:
Insert extra measures into the score.
Cut and paste a section of the score forward, then enter music into the gap.
To insert a note, press Ctrl + Shift (Mac: Cmd + Shift) + the note name (
A to G). This will insert a note of the selected
duration and move the rest of the notes to the right in the same measure. If the measure exceeds the duration of
the time signature, the blue plus will appear above the measure as in Insert Mode.
Delete notes
To delete a single note:
Select the note and press 
Del (Mac: Backspace).
To delete a chord:
43


1. Press Esc to ensure that you are in 
Normal mode.
2. Press Shift and click on a note to select the chord.
3. Press Del (Mac: Backspace).
The delete command can also be applied to a 
range of notes/chords.
Keyboard shortcuts
Here is a list of useful editing shortcuts available in Note Input mode:
↑ (Up): Increase the pitch of a note by a semitone (uses ♯).
↓ (Down): Decrease the pitch of a note by a semitone (uses ♭).
Alt+1-9: Add interval (unison to ninth) above current note.
J: Change a note up or down to its enharmonic equivalent (e.g. D♯ to E♭). This alters the spelling in both concert
pitch and transposed modes. See Accidentals.
Ctrl+J (Mac Cmd+J): Change a note up or down to its enharmonic equivalent. This alters the spelling only in the
current mode. See Accidentals
Alt+Shift+↑: Increase the pitch of a note using key signature
Alt+Shift+↓: Decrease the pitch of a note using key signature
R: Repeat the last entered note
Q: Halve the duration of the last entered note
W: Double the duration of the last entered note
Shift+Q: Decrease duration by a dot (for example, a dotted quarter note/crotchet becomes a quarter note/crotchet and
a quarter note/crotchet becomes a dotted eighth note/quaver).
Shift+W: Increase duration by a dot (for example an eighth note/quaver becomes a dotted eighth note/quaver and a
dotted eighth note/quaver becomes a quarter note/crotchet).
Backspace: Undo last entered note
Shift+←: Exchange last entered note with the note before it (repeat to keep moving note earlier)
Shift+→: Exchange note moved with 
Shift+← with the note that follows it
X: Flip direction of note stem (can be reset to Auto position in 
Inspector)
Shift+X: Move note head to opposite side of stem (can be reset to Auto position in 
Inspector)
Ctrl+Alt+1-4: Switch to corresponding 
voice)
Mouse
It's easy to enter notes with the mouse, but it is not the fastest way to enter lots of notes.
1. Click on the desired note duration symbol in the 
Note input toolbar.
2. Click on the score to add a pitch of the selected duration.
3. To add more notes to an existing chord, simply repeat step 2.
4. To replace an existing chord (rather than adding to it), press 
Shift before clicking.
5. To add a rest, right-click.
Note: If you hover the cursor over the score in Note Input Mode it will show you a preview of the note or rest you are
about to add.
MIDI keyboard
You can also insert pitches using a MIDI keyboard.
1. Connect your MIDI keyboard to the computer and switch the former on
2. Start MuseScore (this must be done after the keyboard is switched on)
3. Create a new score
4. Click the rest (selecting it) in measure 1 to indicate where you want note input to begin
5. Press N to enter 
note input mode
6. Select a note duration such as 
5 for quarter notes (crotchets), as described 
above
7. Press a note on your MIDI keyboard.
The pitch should be added to your score. If the pitch does not appear, either use the toolbar and click 'Toggle MIDI Input'
or follow these steps:
1. From the menu, select 
Edit→Preferences... (Mac: MuseScore→Preferences...).
2. Click on the Note Input tab and check "Enable MIDI Input".
3. Click OK to exit. You will need to restart MuseScore to apply the change.
Note: The default method of entry, 
Step-time allows you to enter one note at a time. Other note input modes are also
available: see Note input modes.
If you have multiple MIDI devices connected to your computer, you may need to inform MuseScore which is the MIDI
keyboard:
1. From the menu, select 
Edit→Preferences... (Mac: MuseScore→Preferences...).
44


2. Click on the I/O tab and select your device under the section labeled "MIDI input".
3. Click OK to exit. You will need to restart MuseScore to apply the change.
Virtual Piano Keyboard
You can also input notes using the on-screen 
piano keyboard.
To toggle the display on and off
: Press P (or select View→Piano).
To resize the keyboard: Position the mouse pointer over the piano keys, hold down 
Ctrl (Mac: Cmd) and move the
mouse scroll wheel up (larger) or down (smaller).
The method of note entry is similar to that for a 
midi keyboard:
1. Ensure that you are in Note Input mode.
2. To enter a:
Single note: Click on the appropriate piano key.
Chord: Select the note you wish to add to, press and hold 
Shift, then click on a piano key (in versions before
2.1, use Ctrl (Mac: Cmd). Repeat as required.
Note input modes
MuseScore offers a variety of note input modes in addition to Step-time. All can be accessed by clicking the small arrow
next to the "N" button on the left of the Note Input toolbar:
Step-time (default): The default mode of note entry. See 
Basic note entry (above).
Repitch: Replace pitches without changing rhythms.
Rhythm: Enter durations with a single click or keypress.
Real-time (automatic): Perform the piece at a fixed tempo indicated by a metronome beat.
Real-time (manual): Perform the piece while tapping a key or pedal to set the beat.
Insert: (Called "Timewise" until version 3.0.2) Insert and delete notes and rests within measures, automatically
shifting subsequent music forwards or backwards.
Coloring of notes outside an instrument's range
Depending on the skill of the musician, certain notes are considered beyond the range of a particular instrument. For
informational purposes, MuseScore optionally colors notes red if they are outside the range of a "professional" player, and
olive green/dark yellow if outside the range of an "early amateur." The colors appear on the computer screen, but not on
printed copies.
To enable/disable note coloration and to set "professional" and "amateur" ranges, see 
Usable pitch range (Staff
properties: all staves).
Small notes/small noteheads
1. Select the note(s) you want in small size.
2. Check the "Small" checkbox in the 
Inspector. The one in the 
Note section is used to only change the size of the
individual notehead; the one in the Chord section will change the note head, stem, beam, and flag sizes all together.
By default, the small size is 70% of the normal size. You can change that setting in 
Format → Style…→Sizes.
Change notes or rests already entered
45

Palettes
A Palette is a folder containing musical symbols which can be applied to the score. Musescore's default palettes contain
collections of related symbols, but you can customize palettes to display almost any kind of symbol, line or text. Palettes
form the main part of a workspace.
48


Musescore comes with two sets of 
preset palettes: a Basic and an Advanced set (contained in similarly-named
workspaces). But that is only the start. You can add your own symbols and text either to the existing palettes or to palettes
you create in new workspaces. In other words, you can customize each workspace to exactly meet your particular scoring
needs. See Customize palettes.
View or hide the Palette area
The default position of the Palette area is to the left of the document window. To view or hide it:
From the menu, select 
View → Palettes, or use the keyboard shortcut 
F9.
To undock the Palette area:
Click the double-chevron symbol (circled in the image above), or double-click the top bar of the panel.
To re-attach the panel, double-click on the top bar again. See 
Side panels for more information.
Open/close a palette
Click on the arrow next to the palette name, or double-click the palette name (in versions prior to MuseScore 3.3,
click once on either the arrow or the palette name).
Symbols assigned to the palette are shown in a grid below the palette name. If you have customized one of Musescore's
default palettes, clicking More will show any symbols you have deleted.
Single Palette mode
If you only want one palette open at a time, right-click at the top of the workspace and check the 
Single Palette box. Any
opened palette will now close when you open a different one.
Apply symbols from a palette
Versions 3.4 or above
Select one or more score elements, then click the desired palette symbol. Or, drag and drop the symbol onto the
desired score element in the staff.
Versions prior to 3.4
Select one or more score elements, then 
double-click the desired palette symbol. Or, drag and drop the symbol onto
the desired score element in the staff.
If you are dragging a symbol to the score and decide you don't want to apply it, press 
Esc.
49


Tip: To prevent accidental rearrangement of contents during use, right-click a palette name and uncheck 
Enable Editing.
You can search for symbols or palette names by typing in the 
Search box at the top of the list. As you type, symbols
and/or palettes with names matching your keystrokes are displayed below, updating continuously as your typed input
changes. Displayed symbols can come from any palette, which makes this a powerful way to locate symbols without
visually searching through various palettes .
Symbols can be applied directly from the search results as described above.
To restore the list of palette names, which is temporarily hidden by the search results, click 
X in the search box.
Anything added to the score from a palette can be copied, pasted, and duplicated: see 
Copy and paste.
Customize the palette list
Change the order of palette names in the list
Drag the name of a palette up or down to any desired position.
Create a new palette
1. At the top of the palette list, click 
Add Palettes→Create custom palette. Or, right-click anywhere on the list of palette names
and choose Insert New Palette.
2. Type the name of the new palette in the 
Create Palette dialog.
See Customize palettes to learn how to add symbols to the new palette.
Hide a palette from the list
Hiding a palette depends on whether it is one of Musescore's default palettes or one you created yourself using the
method above.
To hide a Musescore default palette:
Right-click the name of the palette you want to hide and click 
Hide Palette.
To hide a palette you created:
Right-click the name of the palette you want to hide, click 
Hide/Delete Palette, then click 
Hide in the dialog.
Show a hidden palette in the list
Click Add Palettes at the top of the palette list and click 
Add beside the palette name.
Delete a palette
Only palettes you created yourself can be deleted.
Right-click the name of the palette you want to delete, click 
Hide/Delete Palette, then click 
Delete permanently in the dialog.
You cannot delete Musescore's default palettes. If you don't intend to use a default palette, hide its name from the list
instead.
Customize palettes
You can modify any Musescore default or user-created palette. Symbols may be added or deleted and layouts can be
rearranged.
From MuseScore 3.3 onwards, all preset palettes in the Basic and Advanced workspaces can be customized directly (if
you are using a previous version you will need to create a new workspace
 first).
Before customizing a palette:
1. Right-click on the palette name and make sure that 
Enable Editing is checked. It is automatically checked for new
palettes you create yourself.
2. Make sure the palette is opened.
Add an existing score element to a palette
Press and hold Ctrl+Shift (Mac: Cmd+Shift), then drag the score element from the score onto a palette. The score
element could be a symbol, line, text, dynamic, fretboard diagram, imported image etc.
50


Add a symbol to a palette from the Master Palette
1. If the Master Palette is not visible, select View → Master Palette from the menu, or use the keyboard shortcut 
Shift+F9
(Mac: fn+Shift+F9).
2. Drag the symbol from the Master Palette window onto a palette.
Change symbol order in a palette
Drag the symbol to the cell in which you wish to display it. Nearby symbols will automatically move to make space
available.
Change the position and size of a symbol in a palette cell
Right-click the cell and click Properties. The following dialog is displayed:
Name: The tooltip that appears when you mouse over the cell.
Content offset X, Y: Adjusts the position of the symbol in the cell.
Content scale: Makes the symbol appear larger or smaller in the cell.
Draw staff: Draws the five lines of a musical staff behind the symbol.
Note: Changing these values only affects the appearance of symbols within the palette. It does not change their sizes or
offsets on the score page.
Remove a symbol from a palette
Right-click the symbol and click Delete. Or, select the symbol and click the trash icon to the right of the palette name.
The More command functions differently in a user-created palette. It displays one palette at a time from the palette list,
allowing you to add symbols from that palette by dragging or by selecting an item and clicking Add to. Use < and > to step
through the palettes in the list.
Palette menu
The following menu appears either by right-clicking the name of a palette or by clicking the 
... to the right of the name:
Hide Palette: Removes the name of the palette from the list of available palettes.
Hide/Delete Palette: Allows you to either hide or permanently delete a palette you created yourself. Shown in place of
the above menu item.
Insert New Palette: Creates a new empty palette. Identical to Add Palettes→Create custom palette.
Enable Editing: Allows you to modify the contents and layout of the palette.
Reset Palette: Discards any customizations made to a palette and restores its default contents and layout.
Save Palette...: Saves the current palette as an .mpal file.
Load Palette...: Loads a palette from an .mpal file and displays the palette name in the list.
Palette Properties...: Displays the following dialog, where you can adjust the appearance of a palette:
51


Name: The name shown in the palette list.
Cell Size: Width, Height: The dimensions of each individual cell in the palette.
Element Offset: Adjusts the vertical offset of all symbols in the palette.
Scale: Makes all symbols in the palette appear larger or smaller.
Show grid: Draws a border around each palette cell.
Behavior of applied text and lines
If the symbol you are adding to the score from a palette contains a 
text element (e.g. staff text, dynamic, fingering, volta
etc.), then properties such as font type, font size, text color and alignment will adapt according to the following rules:
1. Text properties which have not been altered by the user will adopt the relevant 
text styles.
2. Custom text properties—those changed by the user before saving the symbol to a custom palette—remain as
customized.
By contrast, the line properties of lines applied from a palette always remain unchanged (i.e. as set by the user before
saving to a custom workspace, or as predefined in the Basic/Advanced workspaces).

Master palette
Workspaces
The workspace consists of several components, the main one being the 
palette area situated to the left of the document
window.
Each palette is a folder containing musical symbols (usually related) which can be applied to the score.
To open or close a palette: Click on the arrow next to the palette name, or double-click the palette name (in
versions prior to MuseScore 3.3, click once on either the arrow or the palette name).
To view or hide the palette area of the workspace:

What the Inspector does
When you select any object in the score window, its properties are automatically displayed in the 
Inspector where they
can be edited. Multiple elements can also be selected and edited together—as long as they are of the same type.
However, if the selected objects are of different types, then the Inspector restricts you to editing color, visibility, and
automatic placement only.
"Reset to style default" and "Set to style" buttons
When you select a score object, two types of buttons are clearly visible on the right-hand side of the Inspector:
Reset to style default: 
. Press this button to reset a particular property to the default value—i.e. the one shown
in the Style menu.
Set as style: 
. Press this button to make the value of a particular property the new default for the style. This will
update the Style menu and all other objects governed by that style.
Note: You can also edit styles directly from the 
Style menu.
Inspector categories
Properties are conveniently listed under categories in the Inspector. 
Categories can be identified by their bold lettering.
For example, if you select a barline, you will see the following displayed at the top of the Inspector:
For details of the various categories and their properties, see below:
Element
All score elements—except frames, breaks and spacers—display this category in the Inspector when selected. The
options are as follows:
Visible: Uncheck this box to make selected elements 
invisible; alternatively, use the shortcut 
V (toggle). Invisible
elements do not appear in the music when printed out or exported as a PDF or image. If you still want them to

Staves
Visible: Check/uncheck to show/hide notes and staff lines for the selected measure.
Stemless: Check/Uncheck to show/hide all note stems for the selected measure.
Measure duration
This section of the dialog allows you to adjust the duration of a single measure independently of the displayed time
signature. Use it to create a pickup measure (also known as anacrusis or upbeat), cadenza, ad lib section etc.
Nominal is the apparent time signature and cannot be edited.
Actual can be set to anything you like regardless of the 
nominal time signature.
Example: In the image below, the quarter note 
pickup measure has a nominal time signature of 4/4, but an 
actual time
sig. of 1/4. The measures in the middle are in normal 4/4 time. The complementary measure at the end of the staff, with a
dotted half note, has an actual time sig. of 3/4.
Note: A small - or + sign appears above the measure when its duration is different than indicated by the time signature
(see image below). This does not appear in any printed or PDF copy
. You can turn off these marks by unchecking "Mark
Irregular Measures" in the View menu.
Pressing Ctrl+Del on a note or pause also reduces the duration of the measure, while via insert mode you can increase
the duration of the measure.

Break multimeasure rests: Tick to prevent a 
multimeasure rest at the start of the selected measure. This option
should be checked before turning on "Create multimeasure rests" in Format→Style...→Score. The default program
setting for scores is OFF; for parts is ON.
Note: Multimeasure rests are broken, by default, at important breaks—such as rehearsal marks, time signature changes,
double barlines, irregular measures, etc.
Measure number mode
This allows you to control whether and how measure numbers display on the selected measure:
Auto: Follows the setting in 
Format→Style...→Measure Numbers.
Always Show: Forces display of number.
Always Hide: Hides number.
Layout stretch
Layout stretch: Controls the amount of horizontal space between score elements (notes, rests, etc.).
This setting allows a more precise degree of control than offered by the 
Increase/Decrease Stretch ({ and }) commands.
Add to measure number
Add to measure number": Enter a positive or negative number to change the number of the selected measure,
and subsequent meaures. A value of "-1" has the same effect as marking a measure to be excluded from measure
count.
Play Count
Play count: If a measure precedes an end repeat barline, this value controls the number of times that the entire
repeat section plays back: see also, Repeats and jumps.
Numbering
By default, MuseScore numbers the first measure of each System (except for the first measure in a 
section), but other
numbering options are available: see Format→Style...→Measure Numbers.
Split and join
To make a measure longer or shorter in duration—without changing the time signature—you can adjust its 
Measure

 (MuseScore HowTo)
Voices
A voice is a musical line or part which can have its own rhythm independently of other voices on the 
same staff. Voices
are sometimes called "layers" in other notation software.
You can have up to 4 
voices on each staff line. In a polyphonic measure, 
voice 1 (and 3) usually takes the 
up-stem notes
and voice 2 (and 4) takes the 
down-stem notes.
N.B. Be careful not to confuse the concept of MuseScore voices (1, 2, 3, 4) with the order of voices found in SATB vocal
scores:
In Open score SATB (where four staves are used for the four voices), use (MuseScore) voice 1 in each staff.
In Close/Closed score SATB (where two staves are used for the four voices, e.g., as in hymnals), use only
(MuseScore) voices 1 and 2 for both upper and lower staves.
There is no need to use (MuseScore) voices 3 and 4 unless there are more than two parts in the 
same staff. This
means that in the bass clef of a “close score”, the tenor is voice 1 and the bass is voice 2—beginners often without
thinking assign the bass to 1, resulting in stem-direction confusion, or assign tenor to voice 3 and bass to voice 4,
which then leads to confusing rests appearing in voice 1 (which cannot be deleted).
How voices are displayed
Selecting a section of the score highlights each voice in a different color: voice 1 blue, voice 2 green, voice 3 orange and
voice 4 purple.
When to use voices
If you need stems pointing in opposite directions within a chord, on a single staff.
If you need notes of different durations within a single staff, played simultaneously.
How to enter notes in different voices
The following instructions show you how to notate a passage of music in two voices:
1. Enter voice 1 notes first: Make sure you are in 
note input mode : the Voice 1 button becomes highlighted in blue in
the toolbar. 
 Enter the notes in the top voice first. On inputting, some notes may have down-stems, but
these will flip automatically when the second voice is added.
The following excerpt shows a treble staff with just the voice 1 notes entered:
2. Move cursor back to start of section
: When you have finished entering a section of voice 1 notes, press the 
← key
repeatedly to move the cursor, note-by-note, back to the first note of the section; or alternatively use Ctrl+←
(Mac:Cmd+←) to move the cursor back one measure at a time. Or else you can simply exit 
note input mode (press
Esc) and click directly on the first note.
3. Enter voice 2 notes: Make sure you are in note-input mode and that the voice 1 note at the beginning of the section
is selected. Click on the "Voice 2" button 
 (on the right of the toolbar), or use the shortcut 
Ctrl+Alt+2 (Mac:
Cmd+Alt+2). Enter all the lower voice notes (down-stem).
The following image shows the above example after the addition of voice 2 notes:
60


Deleting and hiding rests
All rests can be made invisible, if required: select the desired rest(s) and press 
V, or uncheck the "Visible" checkbox in the
Inspector. Rests in voices 2, 3 or 4 (but 
not voice 1) can also be 
deleted (by selecting them and pressing 
Delete) but it is
not recommended: make them invisible instead.
A voice 1 rest can only be deleted by removing that part of the measure from the score as well: see Remove selected
range; or Delete measure(s).
Restoring deleted rests
If a rest has been deleted in voices 2-4, you will need to restore it before you can enter a note on that beat in that voice
(the problem may arise, for example, in imported XML or MIDI files). The easiest way to fix such a measure is to
exchange that voice with voice 1 twice. For the exact method, see Exchange voices of notes (below).
Exchange voices of notes
To swap the notes between any two voices:
1. Select one or more continuous measures (or a 
range of notes);
2. From the Menu bar, select 
Tools → Voices;
3. Select the option for the two voices you want to exchange.
Notes: (a) The selection can encompass content of any voice, but only two will be processed at once. (b) If you select a
partial measure the operation will still apply to the whole measure.
Move notes to another voice (without swapping)
You can also move notes from one voice to another (without note-swapping):
1. Ensure you are not in 
note input mode.
2. Select one or more noteheads (in any voice).
3. Click on the destination voice in the 
Note Input toolbar or use the shortcut 
Ctrl+Alt+1–4 (Mac: Cmd+Alt+1-4).
Note: For a successful move, the following conditions need to be met:
The chord in the destination voice must be the same duration as the note to be moved there.
Alternatively, if the destination voice is occupied by a rest, it must be of sufficient duration to accommodate the
moved note.
Notes should not be tied.
Navigate between voices
To select a note in a higher-numbered voice than the current one:
1. Use Alt + ↓, to move the selection to the bottommost note in the current voice;
2. Press Alt + ↓, to move to the higher-numbered voice;
3. Repeat any of the above steps, as necessary, until the desired note is selected.
To select a note in a lower-numbered voice than the current one:
1. Use Alt + ↑, to move the selection to the topmost note in the current voice;
2. Press Alt + ↑, to move to the lower-numbered voice.
3. Repeat any of the above steps, as necessary, until the desired note is selected.

Copy and paste
MuseScore supports standard copy, cut, paste and swap with clipboard operations. These commands can be applied
to a range of:
Musical notes: e.g. to repeat a section of music, or shift a passage by a beat or a measure.
Other score elements: such as articulations, staff text, dynamics, fingering etc.
Copy/cut/paste/swap commands are accessed in three ways:
From the Edit menu (above the document window) (Mac: the MuseScore menu).
From the menu displayed by right-clicking on an element or range of elements.
Using one of the standard 
keyboard shortcuts.

Notes
You can cut, copy, paste or swap notes as follows:
Copy or cut
To copy/cut a single chord
1. Hold down Shift and click on a note in the chord.
2. Apply a Copy or Cut option (see table above).
To copy/cut a range of chords
1. Click on the first note or measure that you want to select.
2. Shift+Click on the last note or measure that you want to select. A blue rectangle highlights the region you selected.
3. Apply a Copy or Cut option (see table above).
Paste
1. Click on the note or measure where you want your pasted selection to begin.
2. Apply a Paste option (see table above).
Swap with Clipboard
The swap with clipboard operation combines two commands into one: (1) First it overwrites a selected part of the score
with the contents of the clipboard, just like the paste command; (2) Secondly, it transfers the overwritten part of the score
back to the clipboard, just like the 
copy command.
It can be used, for example, to swap two equal-length sections of a score, 
A and B:
1. Select section A, then apply the 
cut command;
2. Clear the selection (by pressing 
Esc or clicking on a blank area of the document window);
3. Press Shift and click on a note at the start of section 
B. Or, if B begins at the start of a measure, you can also simply
select the measure;
4. Apply a Swap with clipboard option (see table above).
5. Section B is now in the clipboard. 
Paste it back to the blank area of score left by step "1."
Copy pitch of a single note only
It is possible to copy the pitch of a note only (and no other properties), by clicking on the notehead and applying the
standard copy and paste, or copy and swap procedure. The pitch of the destination note changes to match that of the
copied note but the duration remains the same.
Other elements
62


Some elements such as staff text, dynamics, fingering, etc. can be cut, copied and pasted only 
one at a time. However,
other elements support "multiple-selection" cut/copy/paste: such as articulations (sforzato, staccato etc.), fretboard
diagrams, and chord symbols.
Note: The Swap with clipboard command is only intended for use with sections of music and not other score elements.
Copy or cut
1. Select the element (or elements).
2. Apply a Copy or Cut option (see table above).
Paste
1. Click on the note where you want your pasted selection to begin.
2. Apply one of the Paste options (see table above).
In the case of articulations, they are pasted to the destination notes in exactly the same order (continuous or intermittent)
as they were in the initial selection.
Quick repeat
To quickly copy and paste a note, measure, or passage:
1. Select a chord, measure, or passage as described 
above.
2. Press R .
MuseScore copies and pastes the selected notation to a point immediately after the last note in the selection. Any existing
music in the destination range is replaced.
Duplicate
To instantaneously copy and paste a text element, line, or other object:
1. Hold down Ctrl+Shift (Mac: Cmd+Shift), click on the element and drag it anywhere in the score.
2. Release the mouse button, and the selected element is cloned to the new location.
Paste half/double duration (version 3.1 and above)
These commands allows you to copy/cut a section of the score, then paste it back anywhere with all the note durations
either halved or doubled.
1. In Normal mode, select a range of notes in the score;
2. Cut or copy the range;
3. Select a destination note (or measure);
4. From the menu, select one of the following:
Edit→Paste Half Duration (Mac: MuseScore→Paste Half Duration).
Edit→Paste Double Duration (Mac: MuseScore→Paste Double Duration).
Selection filter
The Selection Filter allows you to choose exactly which voices and elements you want to include in your selection.
To display the Selection filter, press F6 (Mac: Fn+F6); or from the menu, choose 
View→Selection Filter.
The Selection Filter appears by default below the Palettes. To change the viewing location, see 
Viewing and Navigation:
Side panels.
Example: Suppose you want to copy measures 1 and 2 in the following passage (see image), to give measures 3 and 4:
63


1. Make sure the Selection Filter is displayed (see above);
2. Uncheck the "Articulations & Ornaments" and "Slurs" tickboxes;
3. Copy and paste the desired measures (in this example, 1-2 into 3-4).
Note: The Selection Filter works with the 
swap with clipboard command as well.

Selection modes
Objects in the score—such as notes, measures, articulations etc.—can be selected in several ways: (1) 
one at a time, (2)
as a continuous range, or (3) as a list.
Selection is invariably used before applying commands such as delete, copy/cut and paste, transpose and so on.
Select a single object
Most score objects can be selected by simply clicking on them in 
Normal mode.
Select a single note
In Normal mode, click on a notehead.
Note: Selecting a single note then copying and pasting it, will only copy and paste the pitch—not duration or other
properties (such as stemless). To copy the entire note, including all properties, you need to hold down Shift—as for chord
selection (below).
Select a chord
In Normal mode, press and hold 
Shift, then click on a notehead in the chord.
Select a single measure
Click on a blank space within the measure.
Note: To select a range of consecutive measures, see 
Shift selection and Shift + click selection (below).
Select an overlapping element
To select an element from a group of overlapping elements:
Hold Ctrl and click until the desired element is selected.
Select a continuous range of objects
There are several ways to select a 
continuous range of notes, chords or measures etc.:
64


1. Shift + click selection
To select a range of notes or rests:
1. Make sure you are in 
Normal mode;
2. Click on the first note or rest in the range;
3. Press and hold Shift, then click on the last desired note or rest.
Note: The final selected element can be in the same staff or in staffs above or below the initial note/rest. All selected
elements will be enclosed in a blue rectangle, including associated lines and articulations (but not voltas). You can repeat
the operation to extend the selected range as required.
Select chord symbols, lyrics etc. (as of version 3.5)
As of MuseScore 3.5, the shift + click method has been refined to make it easier to select a continuous range of items
such as chord symbols, lyrics etc. For example:
1. Click on the first chord symbol in the desired range.
2. Shift + click on the last chord symbol in the range.
Result All chord symbols in that range are selected, and nothing else.
Select a range of measures
1. Click on a blank space in the first desired measure;
2. Hold down Shift, then click on a space in the last measure of the desired range.
Note: As with selecting notes, the range can be extended vertically as well as horizontally.
2. Shift selection
1. Make sure you are in 
Normal mode;
2. Select the first note, chord, rest or measure in the range. You can extend the selection up or down to adjacent
staves, if needed, using Shift+↑ or ↓;
3. Then choose one of the following options:
To advance the selection one chord at a time to the right: Press 
Shift+→.
To advance the selection one chord at a time to the left: Press Shift+←.
To advance the selection one measure at a time to the right: Press 
Shift+Ctrl+→ (Mac: Shift+Cmd+→).
To advance the selection one measure at a time to the left: Press 
Shift+Ctrl+← (Mac: Shift+Cmd+←).
To advance the selection to the beginning of the line: Press 
Shift+Home (Mac: Shift+Fn+←).
To advance the selection to the end of the line: Press 
Shift+End (Mac: Shift+Fn+→).
To extend the selection to the beginning of the score: Press 
Shift+Ctrl+Home (Mac: Shift+Cmd+Fn+←).
To extend the selection to the end of the score: Press 
Shift+Ctrl+End (Mac: Shift+Cmd+Fn+→).
3. Drag selection
This method can be used to select notes or rests, or, independently, to select non-note symbols such as staccato dots,
lyrics etc.:
Press and hold Shift, then drag the cursor across the desired range.
4. Select All
This method selects the whole musical score including notes, rests and associated elements. Use one of the following
options:
Press Ctrl+A (Mac: Cmd+A).
From the menu bar, select 
Edit → Select All.
5. Select section
This method is used to select a 
section—a region of the score starting and/or ending with a 
section break:
1. Click on an empty space in a measure in the section;
2. From the menu bar, select 
Edit → Select Section.
6. Selection Filter
The Selection Filter allows you include or exclude certain types of elements within a range selection. See 
Copy and paste:
Selection filter
65


Select a list of objects
To select a list (or discontinuous range) of score elements:
1. Click on the first element;
2. Hold down Ctrl (Mac: Cmd) and successively click on the desired additional elements.
Note: This method cannot be used to select measures. Use 
single or range selection instead.
Modify an existing selection (as of version 3.5)
You can also use the Ctrl + click method to add to, or subtract from, an existing selection. For example:
1. Make a selection in the score using any of the methods above.
2. To add a non-selected element to the selection, press 
Ctrl and click on it. Repeat as required.
3. To remove an already-selected element from the selection, press 
Ctrl and click on it. Repeat as required.
Select all similar
To select all elements of a specific type (e.g., all barlines, all text elements, all staccato markings):
1. Select an element;
2. Right-click and choose Select…;
3. Several options are available:
All Similar Elements: Selects all elements in the score similar to the chosen object.
All Similar Elements in Same Staff
: Selects all elements in the same staff similar to the chosen object.
All Similar Elements in Range Selection
: only applies if a 
range has been selected. Selects all elements in
the range similar to the chosen object.
More...: opens a dialog that lets you fine-tune more options. For example, if you have a notehead selected, the
dialog will look something like this:
Select
Same notehead: In this example, only noteheads of the same 
group will be selected;

Page View
69


In Page View, the score is formatted as it will appear when printed or exported as a PDF or image file: that is, page by
page, with margins. MuseScore applies system (line) and page breaks automatically, according to the settings made in
Page settings and Style…. In addition, you can apply your own system (line), page or section breaks.
To choose between horizontal or vertical page scrolling, see Preferences: Canvas (Scroll pages).
Continuous View
In Continuous View, the score is shown as one unbroken system. Even if the starting point is not in view, measure
numbers, instrument names, clefs, time and key signatures will always be displayed on the left of the window.
Note: Because the layout is simpler, MuseScore may perform faster in Continuous View than Page View.
Single Page View
In Single Page View the score is shown as a single page with a header but no margins, and with an infinite page height.
System (line) breaks are added automatically, according to the settings made in 
Page settings and Style…. In addition,
you can apply your own system (line) or section breaks.
Side panels
The workspaces, Inspector and Selection filter are conveniently displayed as side panels to the left and right of the
score window. To undock a side panel use one of the following methods:
Drag the panel;
Click on the double chevron at the top of the panel;
Double-click in the title area at the top of the panel.
To dock a panel use one of the following procedures:
Drag the panel to the top/bottom of an existing side panel and it will stack vertically above/below that panel.
Drag the panel to the middle of an existing side panel and it will overlay that panel. Both panels can then be
accessed by tabs.
Alternatively, double-clicking the title bar of the panel will restore it to its previously docked position.
Navigation
Commands
Various commands are available to help you navigate more easily through the score. These are listed under 
Keyboard
shortcuts: Navigation.
Navigator
The Navigator is an optional panel which displays page thumbnails of the score at the bottom or to the right of the
document window.
To view or hide the Navigator, select 
View→Navigator; or use a customized shortcut.
The Navigator appears at the bottom of the document window if scrolling pages horizontally; or on the right if scrolling
pages vertically (see Preferences: Canvas).
The blue box represents the area of the score that is currently visible in the document window: drag the box, or click
directly on the navigator panel to bring another part of the score into view. You can also drag the scrollbar.
Timeline
The Timeline panel provides a detailed overview of the score, with expanded possibilities for navigation and interaction.
To display the Timeline, press F12; or select View→Timeline.
70


For details, see Timeline.
Find / Go to
The Find / Go to function allows you to speedily navigate to a specific measure, 
rehearsal mark or page number in the
score:
1. Press Ctrl+F (Mac: Cmd+F), or select Edit→Find. This opens the Find (or Go to) bar at the bottom of the workspace.
2. Use one of the following options:
To go to a numbered measure: enter the measure number (counting every measure, starting with 1,
irrespective of pickup measures, section breaks or manual changes to measure number offsets).
To go to a numbered page: enter the page number using the format pXX (where XX is the page number).
To go to a numerical rehearsal mark: enter the number using the format rXX (where XX is the name of the
rehearsal mark).
To go to a rehearsal mark starting with a letter: enter the name of the 
rehearsal mark (the search is case
insensitive).
N.B.: It is best to avoid naming rehearsal marks with the single letters "R," "r," "P", "p," or one of these letters with an
integer (e.g. "R1" or "p3"), as this can confuse the search algorithm.

Concert pitch
You can choose to display the score in either 
written or concert (sounding) pitch. Written pitch displays the score as it
should look when printed for musicians to read. However, during preparation you may prefer the convenience of seeing
the transposing instruments notated as they sound, without transposition. In this case you should select the "Concert
pitch" option.
To toggle the score display between written or concert pitch:
Press the Concert Pitch button (located in the top right of the 
toolbar area). When this button is highlighted the score is
in concert pitch.
Before printing the score, exporting it to PDF or saving it online, you should ensure that the 
Concert Pitch button is off, and
that the individual parts are correctly transposed.

Notation
In the previous →"Basics" chapter you learned how to 
enter notes and interact with the 
palettes. The "Notation" chapter
describes the different types of notation in more detail, including more advanced music notation.
See also →"Advanced topics".
Barlines
A range of barline symbols for most ordinary purposes can be found in the 
Barlines palette (Basic workspace); repeat
barlines, only, are also available in the Repeats & Jumps palette (Basic and Advanced). Additional symbols can be found

You can insert a barline in order split a measure into two separate ones. Use one of the following methods:
Press Ctrl (Mac Cmd) and drag the line from the Barline palette to the first note of the new measure.
Select the first note of the new measure and press 
Ctrl (Mac Cmd) while you click a barline in the Barline palette
(double-click in versions prior to 3.4) .
Note: As of version 3.1 (or earlier), all barlines entered this way are entered as Normal Barlines. 
See also Split a
measure.
Custom barlines
It is possible to create custom barlines by selecting one or more barlines, and adjusting the properties in the "Barlines"
section of the Inspector:
Style: Choose from a range of preset barlines.
Span to next staff: joins the selected barline to the barline in the staff below.
Span from: Sets the position of the 
top of the barline. "0" is the top staff line. Positive numbers start lower down the
staff, negative numbers above.
Span to: Sets the position of the 
bottom of the barline (see "Span from").
Span presets: Use the buttons to apply preset customized barlines.
See also Mensurstrich.
Changes to color and horizontal/vertical offset can also be made in the Inspector.
Connect barlines
Barlines may extend over multiple staves, as in the grand staff of a piano, or in an orchestral score to join instruments in
the same section. To join barlines:
1. Enter Edit mode on a barline.
2. Click on the lower blue handle and drag it down to the staff you wish to connect to. The handle snaps into position so
there is no need to position it exactly.
3. Press Esc to exit edit mode. This will update all other relevant barlines as well.

Global value: Shows the global time signature and is set automatically when you 
add a time signature to the score
.
It is the reference for beats (as shown in the status bar) and tempo markings.
Actual value: Shows the time signature associated with a particular staff. This is normally the same as the global
time signature, but can be set independently if required. See Local time signatures.
Appearance: Allows you to edit the displayed text without affecting the underlying time signature. For an example,
see Additive meters.
Note Groups: Allows you to change the default beaming of notes associated with a time signature. See 
Change
default beaming.
Change default beaming
To adjust note-beaming for a particular time signature:
82


1. Select the time signature, then "Properties" in the "Time Signature" section of the Inspector; or right-click (Mac: 
Ctrl-
click) on the time signature and select, Time Signature Properties…;
2. To break a note beam in the 
Note Groups panel, click on the note following it. To reset the beam, click in the same
place. Alternatively, you can change beaming by dragging a beam icon onto a note, as follows:
 Start beam at this note.
 Do not end beam at this note.
 1/8th note beam to left of this note.
 1/16 note beam to left of this note.
Checking the box for "Also change shorter notes," means that any beam changes at one level are applied automatically to
shorter durations as well. The Reset button cancels any changes made in that session.
Additive (composite) meters
Additive (or composite) time signatures are sometimes used to clarify the division of beats within a measure. To create an
additive time signature:
1. Right-click (Mac: Ctrl-click) on a time signature in the score and select 
Time Signature properties…;
2. In the Appearance section, adjust the "Text" property as required;
3. Adjust note beaming in the 
Note Groups section if required.
Note: The Time Signatures section of the Master palette also allows you to create additive time signatures (see above).
Local time signatures
In certain cases a score may show staves with different time signatures running at the same time. For example, in Bach's
26. Goldberg Variation:
In the above example, the global time signature is 3/4, but the time signature of the upper staff has been set
independently to 18/16.
To set a local time signature for just one staff:
Hold down Ctrl (Mac: Cmd) and drag and drop a time signature from a palette onto an empty measure.
Resize time signature
Select one or more time signatures and, in the "Time Signature" section of the 
Inspector, adjust the "Scale X" (width)
and "Scale Y" (height) values.
Pickup measures and cadenzas
Occasionally you will need to decrease or increase the duration of a measure without changing the time signature—for
example, in a pickup measure (anacrusis) or in a cadenza etc. See Measure operations: Measure duration.
Time signature changes and breaks
Multimeasure rests are interrupted when a time signature change occurs. Also, a 
section break will prevent a courtesy
time signature being shown at the end of the previous measure.

Bends
Bends, of various kinds, can be created with the 
Bend Tool 
. You can find this in the 
Articulations palette of the
Advanced workspace. Any bend applied to the score can be customized in the 
Bend section of the Inspector.
Apply a bend
To apply one or more bends to the score, use one of the following options:
Select one or more notes and double-click a bend symbol in the palette.
Drag a bend symbol from the palette on to a note.
Edit bend
Text and line properties
1. Select the bend;
2. Adjust the following properties in the Bend section of the Inspector:
Line thickness.
Font, Size, Style: Properties of the text.
Play (checkbox): Whether the bend affects playback or not.
Global text and line properties for all bends in the score can be edited in 
Format→Style...→Bend.
Bend shape and width
Versions 3.4 and above
1. Make sure that the bend is selected.
2. In the "Bend" section of the 
Inspector use the Bend type dropdown to choose from a range of presets. "Bend" is the
default option.
3. Make adjustments, as required, to the graphical display of the bend in the Inspector: see 
Edit graphical display
(below).
Versions prior to 3.4
1. Select the bend and click on Properties in the Inspector; Alternatively, right-click on the bend and select "Bend
Properties."
87


2. Choose from a range of presets under 
Bend type. "Bend" is the default option.
3. Make adjustments, as required, to the graphical display of the bend: see 
Edit graphical display (below).
Edit graphical display
The bend is represented by a graph consisting of gray lines connected by square, blue 
nodes (see image above). The
slope of the line indicates the type of bend:
Up-slope = Up-bend
Down-slope = Down-bend
Horizontal line = Hold
The vertical axis of the graph represents the amount by which the pitch is bent up or down: one unit equals a quarter-
tone: 2 units a semitone, 4 units a whole-tone, and so on. The horizontal axis of the graph indicates the length of the
bend: each gray line segment extends for 1 space (sp) in the score.
A bend is modified by adding or deleting nodes in the graph:
To add a node, click on an empty intersection.
To delete a node, click on it.
Adding a node lengthens the bend by 1 sp; deleting a node 
shortens the bend by 1 sp. The 
Start and End points of the
bend can be moved up and down only.
Adjust height
The height of the bend symbol is automatically adjusted so that the text appears just above the staff. This height can be
adjusted, if necessary, with a workaround:
1. Create another note vertically above the note (shortening the line) or below the note (extending the line) at which
you want the bend to start.
2. Apply the bend to the created note.
3. To adjust the height of the bend move this created note vertically so that the bend symbol gets the desired height.
4. Drag the bend symbol to the correct position (to the original note).
5. Mark the created note invisible and silent (using the 
Inspector).
Adjust position
To adjust position use one of the following:
Drag the bend symbol with a mouse.
Click on the symbol and adjust the horizontal and vertical offsets in the 
Inspector.
Double-click on the symbol; or click on it and press 
Ctrl+E (Mac: Cmd+E); or right-click on the symbol and select "Edit
element." Then use the arrow keys for fine positioning (0.1 sp at a time); or Ctrl+Arrow (Mac: Cmd+Arrow) for larger
adjustments (1 sp at a time).
Custom bends
After a bend has been created in the score it can be saved for future use by dragging and dropping the symbol to a palette
while holding down Ctrl+Shift (Mac: Cmd+Shift). See Custom Workspace.

Beams
Adjust automatic note beaming
88


By default, MuseScore beams notes according to settings in the 
Time Signature Properties dialog. To change this
automatic pattern of note-beaming, see Change default beaming.
Change beaming of individual notes
MuseScore also allows you to override the default beaming of any note, using the 
beam symbols in the Beam
Properties palette of the "Basic" or "Advanced" 
workspaces:
To change one or more note beams (except feathered beams, below), use one of the following methods:
Drag and drop a beam symbol from the 
Beam Properties palette onto a note or rest in the score.
Select one or more notes and/or rests in the score and click the desired symbol in the 
Beam Properties palette
(double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
To apply feathered note beams, use either of the following methods:
Drag and drop a feathered-beam symbol from the 
Beam Properties palette onto a note beam in the score.
Select one or more note beams in the score, then click on a feathered-beam symbol in the 
Beam Properties palette
(double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Notes: (1) Feathered beams may use 2 or 3 lines depending on the tempo and the desired rate of the change; (2) To
create a 2-line feathered beam, you need to start with a continuous run of beamed sixteenth notes; (3) To create a 3-line
feathered beam, you need to start with continuous run of beamed thirty-second notes; (4) Playback of feathered beams is
not supported.
Beam symbols and their effects
Icon
Name
Description
Beam start
If the note is beamed to a previous note, break the beam.
Beam middle
Create a beam from the selected note to the previous note (if applicable). This applies to Beam
16th sub and Beam 32nd sub as well.
No beam
Break beams before and after the selected note.
Beam 16th sub
Start a second level beam at this note.
Beam 32nd sub
Start a third level beam at this note.
Automatic Beam Apply default beaming as determined by the current 
time signature (see above).
Feathered beam,
slower
Start feathered beam to indicate gradually slower tempo.
Feathered beam,
faster
Start feathered beam to indicate gradually faster tempo.
Note: Be aware that the beam between two notes/rests is determined by both of the note/rests. For example: Two
consecutive notes with a status of start beam here will not have a beam between them. If the two consecutive notes are
willing to connect to each other they will beam, if one of them is not willing, the two notes will not beam.
Adjust beam angle
To adjust with the keyboard or mouse:
1. Enter edit mode on the note beam—the right adjustment handle is automatically selected.
2. Use the up/down arrows or drag the right end handle to change the angle of the beam;
3. Press Esc to exit edit mode.

Note: "Force Horizontal" in the "Beam" section of the Inspector can only be selected if "Custom position" has been
deselected previously. This setting overrides the Custom Position values and automatically sets the horizontal bar to its
original height.
If you want all note beams in the score to be horizontal there is a "Flatten all beams" option in 
Format→Style…→Beams. If this
option is not selected, automatically inclined beams will be set according to the pitch of the connected notes. This global
setting can be overridden for individual beams according to the methods described above.
Adjust feathered beams
To adjust feathered beams:
1. Select a note beam.
2. Adjust the values in the "Grow left" and "Grow right" boxes in the "Beam" section of the 
Inspector.
Local relayout
MuseScore spaces notes according to their time values, allowing for accidentals, lyrics etc. In systems where there is
more than one staff, this may result in irregular note spacing, as in the following example:
Local relayout is a tickbox option in the 
Inspector allowing you to specify those passages in the score where you want
the note spacing to be independent of other staves in the system. Applying "Local relayout" to the note beams in the top
staff of the previous example results in a more even distribution of notes:

Brackets
MuseScore provides brackets and a curly brace in the Brackets palette (Advanced workspace).
When a new score is created using a template, MuseScore automatically sets the correct brackets.
Add
To add a bracket or brace to systems, use one of two methods:
Select a measure on the staff where you want the bracket/brace to start, and click the desired icon in a palette
(double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag a bracket/brace icon from a palette on to the staff where you want the bracket/brace to start.
Delete
Select the bracket and press 
Del.
Change
Drag the desired icon from a palette onto an existing bracket/brace in the score.
Edit
When you first apply a bracket it only spans one staff. To extend to other staves:
1. Enter Edit mode.
2. Drag the handle downwards to span the required staves. The handle snaps into position, so exact placement is not
required.
Style
The default thickness and distance from the system of brackets and braces can be adjusted in 
Format→ Style... →
System.
91


In the System Brackets section, you can set the properties for the brackets in the two boxes on the left, and the
properties for the braces in the two boxes on the right.
Breaths and pauses
Breath and pause markings are available in the 
Breaths & Pauses palette (Advanced workspace).
Add symbol
To add a breath, or pause (aka caesura / "tram lines" / "railroad tracks") to the score, use one of the following options:
Select a note or rest and click a breath or pause symbol in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag a breath or pause symbol from a palette onto a note or rest in the score.
The symbol is placed after the note. Its position can be adjusted by editing the X and Y offsets in the 
Inspector, or, in edit
mode, using the arrow keys.
Adjust pause length
You can adjust the pause length (in seconds) of the added symbol in the 
Inspector.
Grace notes
A grace note is a type of musical ornament, usually printed smaller than regular notes. The 
Short grace note, or
Acciaccatura, appears as a small note with a stroke through the stem. The 
Long grace note, or Appoggiatura, has no
stroke.
Create grace notes
Grace notes can be found in the "Grace notes" 
palette in the Basic or Advanced workspace.
Add a grace note
Use one of the following methods:
Select a regular note and click a grace note in a 
palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag a grace note symbol from a palette onto a regular note.
Select a note and press 
/ to create an acciaccatura only.
This will add a grace note of the same pitch as the regular note. To add a 
sequence of grace notes to a regular note,
simply repeat the above actions as many times as required. See also, Change pitch (below).
Note: When a grace note is added to the score, a slur is 
not automatically created with it, so the latter needs to be added
separately. See Slurs.
Add a chord of grace notes
Grace note chords are built up just like regular chords:
1. Enter the first note of the chord as shown above
2. Select this first grace note and enter subsequent notes as you would for any other regular chord (i.e. 
Shift+A...G).
92


You can also create a grace note chord by using the 
add interval shortcut in step 2: 
Alt+1...9 for intervals from a unison to
a ninth above.
Change pitch
The pitch of a grace note can be adjusted just like a regular one:
1. Select one or more grace notes
2. Adjust pitch using the keyboard arrow commands, namely:
↑ or ↓ to increase or decrease the pitch by a semitone;
Alt+Shift+↑ or Alt+Shift+↓ to increase or decrease the pitch one step at a time, according to the key signature.
Change duration
Select the grace note and either click a duration icon on the toolbar, or apply the duration with the appropriate
keyboard shortcut: i.e. 1...9 (see Note input).
Manual adjustment
Horizontal position
To adjust the horizontal space between a grace note and its regular parent note, use one of the following:
Go into edit mode on the grace note, then use the left/right arrow keys to reposition as desired.
Select the grace note and change the X-offset value in the Chord section of the Inspector.
Other adjustments
Various other properties of the grace note can be adjusted in the 
Inspector (see "Element," "Chord", and "Note" sections)
—such as vertical position, size, stem properties etc. The exception is "Leading space" which only applies to standard
notes.

Hairpins
Hairpins are symbols used to indicate gradual changes in volume in the score. There are two kinds: 
crescendo (getting
louder) and decrescendo (getting quieter).
Add a hairpin
1. Select a range of notes or measures;
2. Use one of the following shortcuts:
<: to create a crescendo hairpin.
>: to create a diminuendo hairpin (decrescendo).
Alternatively, use one of the following options:
Select a range of notes or measures, and click a hairpin in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag and drop a hairpin from a palette onto a staff line.
Adjust length and height
A hairpins is a type of Line with playback properties, and its length is adjusted similarly:
1. Enter edit mode on the hairpin. Then click on the end handle that you want to move:
93


2. Use one of the following shortcuts:
Shift+→ to move the end handle, and its 
anchor, right by one note or rest.
Shift+← to move the end handle, and its anchor, left by one note or rest;
This method of extending or shortening the hairpin maintains 
playback integrity and allows it to cross line breaks:
3. To fine-tune the horizontal position of an end-handle (without changing playback), use the following shortcuts:
→ to move the handle right by 0.1 
sp.
← to move the handle left 0.1 sp.
Ctrl+→ (Mac: Cmd+→) to move the handle right one sp.
Ctrl+← (Mac: Cmd+→) to move the handle left one sp.
To change the height of a hairpin:
Adjust the lower handle at the mouth of the hairpin (e.g. the blue square below):
Cresc. and dim. lines
In addition to hairpins, there are 
cresc.   _     _     _
 and dim.   _     _     _
 lines with the same function in the 
Lines palette.
You can adjust the text, if desired, in the Text Line Core section of the Inspector.
To turn a hairpin into its equivalent text line
:
Select the hairpin and, in the 
Hairpin section of the Inspector, select the appropriate line from "Type."
Copy hairpins
From version 3.1, a hairpin can be cut, copied and pasted just like a text element: see 
Summary of cut / copy / paste
commands.
For versions prior to 3.1, you can only duplicate a hairpin: see 
Copying lines.
Edit hairpin properties
Properties of the hairpin can be edited in the Inspector, as follows:
Element: Edit the Y offset to change the height of the hairpin above or below the staff.
Line: Edit line properties such as color, line style and thickness.
Text line core: Add text and set text properties.
Hairpin:
Type: Change the type of hairpin: crescendo, decrescendo or text.
Circled tip: Tick box to activate.
Height: The width at the mouth of the hairpin.
Continue height: The width of the hairpin at the end of a system, before it continues to the next system.
Placement: Set hairpin above or below the staff.
Dynamic range: Specify whether hairpin playback applies to a staff, part (default) or a system.
Velocity change: … across the span of the hairpin; from 0 to 127.
Use single note dynamics (as of version 3.1): When checked (default), allows the hairpin to change the
dynamic of a single note if the instrument supports single note dynamics.
Dynamic Mode (as of version 3.1): Set the method used to change the dynamic: Linear (default), Ease-in and
out, Ease-in, Ease-out, or Exponential.
Playback of hairpins
By default, a hairpin always affects playback when it spans a series of 
separate notes. In addition, for instruments
94


supporting single note dynamics (e.g. strings, brass etc.), playback is also enabled across a single note or series of 
tied
notes. (Note: Prior to version 3.1 hairpins only affected playback 
between notes, not that of single or tied notes.)
A hairpin only affect playback if there are 
appropriate dynamics somewhere before and after the hairpin. For example, a
crescendo between p and f dynamics will affect playback; but a diminuendo between p and f will be ignored. And if there
are two or more crescendos between p and f, all but the first will be ignored.
A hairpin may be used without dynamic marks, by adjusting "Velocity change" in the 
Inspector (values in the range 0 to
127).
Lines
The Lines palette of the Advanced workspace contains the following lines:
As you can see, the palette includes: 
Slurs, Hairpins, Volta brackets, Octave lines, and many others.
Applying lines to the score
Most lines (except Slurs, Volta brackets and the Ambitus) can be applied from a palette in the following ways:
To apply a line to just one note
1. Click on a note, then Ctrl+Click on the next note;
2. In a palette, click on a line (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
To apply a line across a range of notes
1. Select a range of notes;
2. In a palette, click on a line (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
To apply a line from a note to the end of that measure
Use any of the following methods:
Click on a note, then, in a palette, click on a line (double-click the latter in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag and drop a line onto the score.
To apply a line across a range of measures
1. Select one or more measures;
2. In a palette, click on a line (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Lines and playback properties
95


Some lines, such as Hairpins, Voltas, Ottavas etc., also have an effect on the 
playback of the score itself. Each 
end
handle is connected by a dotted line to an 
anchor on the staff (visible in Edit mode). These anchors indicate the 
extent of
the playback effect.
Adjust vertical position
In Normal mode, apply one of the following methods:
Click on one or more lines and change the vertical offset in the 
Inspector;
Click on a line, press and hold 
Shift and drag it up/down with a mouse.
Note: You can also adjust the vertical position in 
Edit mode.
Change length
Note: The following two methods move the end of the line 
and its anchor together. This ensures that correct playback of
the score is maintained (if applicable), and that the line can be extended between systems if required.
Using keyboard shortcuts
1. Enter Edit mode and click on an end handle;
2. Apply one of the following shortcuts:
Shift+→ to move the end handle, and its anchor, to the right by one note (or, in the case of 
Voltas, one
measure)
Shift+← to move the end handle, and its anchor, to the left by one note (or, in the case of Voltas, one measure);
By dragging (as of version 3.5)
Click on the end handle of a line and drag it with the mouse.
Fine adjustment
To make fine adjustments to the position of the line end (without changing the position of the anchor):
1. Enter Edit mode and click on an end handle;
2. Apply one of the following shortcuts:
→ to move the handle right by 0.1 
sp (1 sp = one staff space = the distance between two staff lines).
← to move the handle left 0.1 sp.
Ctrl+→ (Mac: Cmd+→) to move the handle right one sp.
Ctrl+← (Mac: Cmd+→) to move the handle left one sp.
Text lines
A text line is a line that has text embedded within it—such as a volta, ottava, guitar barre line etc.
When you apply a text line to the score from a palette, the 
line properties always remain unchanged, but the 
text
properties may, under certain circumstances, assume those of the current style for text lines. For details, see Behavior of
applied text and lines.
Custom lines
Any line in the score can be customized by adjusting its properties in the 
Inspector, as follows:
1. Select the line;
2. If line hooks are needed, make a selection from 
Begin hook, End hook and Height (in the Text Line Core section);
3. To add text, tick Begin Text, Continue Text or End Text, then type in the "Text" box:
Begin: Text added here appears at the beginning of the line;
Continue: Text added here appears at the beginning of a continuation line (in the next system, if any);
End: Text added here appears at the end of the line;
4. Edit text properties and alignment as required;
5. Edit Placement: "Above" or "Below" sets the text so that it is on the line. "Left" places the text to the left of the line;
6. Make adjustments to the line color, thickness and style (solid, dashed etc.) in the 
Line section. The Diagonal option
allows you to create a diagonal line by dragging the end handles;
7. To save the result for future use, see 
Custom palettes.
Copying lines
Once applied to the score, lines cannot be copied using the usual 
copy and paste procedures. However, you can
duplicate lines within a score:
96


Press and hold Ctrl+Shift (Mac: Cmd+Shift), click on the line and drag it to the desired location.
Extended ornament lines
To add an accidental to an extended ornament (e.g. a trill line), select the line and click on a symbol in the Accidentals
palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).

Measure rests
Full measure rest
A whole rest, centered within a measure (shown below), is used to indicate that an entire measure (or a voice within a
measure) is silent, regardless of time signature.
To create one or more full measure rests
Use the following method if all selected measures are "standard"—i.e. with no 
custom durations:
1 Select a measure, or range of measures.
2. Press Del.
If one or more of the measures contains a 
custom duration, use the following method instead:
1. Select a measure, or range of measures.
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+Del (Mac: Cmd+Shift+Del).
To create a full measure rest in a particular voice
1. In the appropriate voice, enter a rest that extends for the full measure.
2. Make sure the rest is selected, then press 
Ctrl+Shift+Del (Mac: Cmd+Shift+Del).
Multimeasure rest
A Multimeasure rest indicates a period of silence for an instrument: the number of measures is shown by the number
above the staff.
Multimeasure rests are automatically interrupted at important points, such as double barlines, 
rehearsal marks, key- or
time signature changes, section breaks etc. and also at measures that are set to 
break multimeasure rests.
To display multimeasure rests
To turn multimeasure rests on or off:
Press M on your keyboard.
Alternatively:
1. From the menu, choose 
Format→Style….
2. Click on the "Score" tab, if it is not already selected;
3. Tick/untick "Create multimeasure rests". Here you can also set the minimum of empty measures to combine into a
multimeasure rest (see also Layout and formatting: Score).
Note: It is recommended that you enter all notes in the score first 
before enabling multimeasure rests.
Break multimeasure rest
You may want to have a multimeasure rest divided into two multimeasure rests:
1. Ensure that the option to display multimeasure rests in the score is 
off (see above).
2. Right-click on the measure where you want the second multimeasure rest to start;
97


3. From the menu, choose 
Measure Properties and tick "Break multimeasure rest."
See also: Measure operations: Break multimeasure rest.
Octave lines
Octave (Ottava) lines are used to indicate that a section of music is to be played one or more octaves above or below
written pitch: The line may be dotted or solid. Ottavas are available in the Lines palette of the Basic and Advanced
workspaces.
8─────┐or 8va─────┐: Play one octave above written pitch
8─────┘or 8va─────┘: Play one octave below written pitch
8va alta/bassa lines are particularly common in piano scores, though they are sometimes used in other instrumental
music.1 15ma alta (2 octaves above) and 15ma bassa (2 octaves below) are also occasionally used.
MuseScore automatically adjusts playback of the score under the ottava to the correct pitch.
Apply an octave line
See Applying lines to the score
.
And to adjust the vertical position, see 
Lines: Adjust vertical position.
Change length
See Lines: Change length.
Custom lines
Ottavas can be customized just like any other line. See 
Custom lines and line properties.
Properties unique to Octave lines can be adjusted in the 
Ottava section of the Inspector:
Type: Change the Ottava line text.
Placement: Set to "Above" or "Below" the staff.
Numbers only: Untick for both number and text (e.g. "8va"). Tick for a number only (e.g. "8").

Slurs
A slur is a curved line between two or more notes indicating that they are to be played 
legato—smoothly and without
separation. Not to be confused with Ties, which join two notes of the same pitch.
There are a number of ways to add a slur to a score, and all may be useful depending on the context (adding a slur from
the lines palette is also possible but not recommended).
Add slur in note-input mode
1. While in Note input mode, type in the first note in the slurred section;
2. Press S to begin the slurred section;
3. Type in the remaining notes in the slurred section;
4. Press S again to end the slurred section.
98


Add slur in Normal mode
Method 1
1. Make sure you are in 
Normal mode;
2. Select the note where you want the slur to start:
3. Press S to add a slur extending to the next note:
4. (Optional) Hold Shift and press → (right arrow key) to extend the slur to the next note. Repeat as required:
5. (Optional) Press X to flip the slur direction:
6. Press Esc to exit edit mode:
Method 2
1. Make sure you are in 
Normal mode;
2. Select the note where you want the slur to start;
3. Choose one of the following options:
To add a slur to one voice only: Hold down Ctrl (Mac: Cmd) and select the last note that you want the slur to
cover.
To add slurs to all voices: Hold down Shift (Mac: Cmd) and select the last note that you want the slurs to cover.
4. Press S.
Adjust slur
If you only want to adjust the 
position of a slur:
1. Select the slur;
2. Use any of the following methods:
Drag the slur.
Adjust the horizontal and vertical offset values in the 
Inspector.
To adjust all the properties of a slur (length, shape and position):
1. Make sure you are not in note input mode;
2. Go into Edit mode on the slur;
3. Click on a handle to select it, or use 
Tab to cycle through the handles;
4. To move the left and right handles from note to note, use the following shortcuts:
Shift+→: Move to next note.
Shift+←: Move to previous note.
Shift+↑: Move to lower voice (voice 2 to voice 1 etc.).
Shift+↓: Move to higher voice (voice 1 to voice 2 etc.).
5. To adjust the position of any handle, use any of the following methods:
Drag the handle.
Use the arrow keys for fine adjustment (0.1 
sp. at a time). For larger adjustments (1 
sp. at a time) use Ctrl+→ ←
99


↑ ↓.
6. Press Esc to exit edit mode.
Note: The two outer handles adjust the start and end of the slur, whilst the three handles on the curve adjust the contour.
The middle handle on the straight line is used to move the whole slur up/down/left/right.
Extended slurs
A slur can span several systems and pages. The start and end of a slur is anchored to a note/chord or rest. If the notes
are repositioned due to changes in the layout, stretch or style, the slur also moves and adjusts in size.
This example shows a slur spanning from the bass to the treble clef. Using the mouse, select the first note of the slur, hold
down Ctrl (Mac: Cmd) and select the last note for the slur, and press 
S to add the slur.
X flips the direction of a selected slur.
Dotted/dashed slurs
Dotted slurs are sometimes used in songs where the presence of a slur varies between stanzas. Dotted slurs are also
used to indicate an editor's suggestion (as opposed to the composer's original markings). To change an existing slur into
a dotted or dashed slur, select it and then in Inspector (F8) change Line type from Continuous to Dotted or Dashed.

Tie
Edit mode
Note input
Ties
A tie is a curved line between two notes of the 
same pitch, indicating that they are to be played as one combined note
(see external links below). Ties are normally created between adjacent notes in the same 
voice, but MuseScore also
supports ties between non-adjacent notes and between notes in different voices.
In note-input mode, if you specify a tie immediately after entering a note or chord, the program automatically generates the
correct destination notes to go with the ties. Or, you can simply create ties "after the fact," between existing notes.
Note: Ties, which join notes of the same pitch, should not be confused with 
slurs, which join notes of 
different pitches and
indicate legato articulation.
Add ties in Note Input mode
The following command adds an identical tied chord to the selected chord.
1. Ensure that a note is selected (i.e. highlighted). This can be a single note, or part of a chord.
2. Select a new note duration for the following note(s), if required (but see "Note" below).
3. Press + or the tie button, 
.
Note: This shortcut works, as described above, only if there is no chord following the selected note. If there is, then the
duration is ignored and the tied note is added instead to the following chord.
Add ties in Normal mode
Method 1
1. Select one or more noteheads in the "
start" chord.
100


2. Press +, or the toolbar tie button, 
:
.
Ties will be created between the selected note(s) and the next available note(s) of the same pitch.
To remove ties, as of MuseScore 3.3.3, use the same command (toggle)
Method 2
This method ties all notes in the "
start" chord (where possible):
1. Select the stem of the "start" chord;
2. Press +, or click on the toolbar 
tie button 
.
Ties will be created between all the notes in the selected chord and the following notes of the same pitches.
To remove ties, as of MuseScore 3.3.3, use the same command (toggle).
Add extra tied notes to a previously tied chord
Occasionally you may need to return to an existing tied chord in order to add one or more extra tied notes. In this case a
different command is used. For example:
1. Add the extra notes to the first chord. e.g.
2. In Note input mode, and with any of the notes in the first chord selected, press 
Alt++. Corresponding notes are added
to the following chord and the extra notes are tied:
Add ties to unison notes
A workaround is required to create ties between unison notes:
1. Create the first note as usual;
2. Any additional unison notes should be added at an interval 
other than unison: e.g. 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc.
3. Create a tied chord (as shown 
above): e.g.
4. Move the unison note(s) into position: e.g.
Flip a tie
X flips the direction of a selected tie, from above the note to below the note, or vice-versa.

Tremolo
Tremolo is the rapid repetition of one note or chord, or a rapid alternation between two notes or chords. Tremolo symbols
can be found in the Tremolo palette in the advanced workspace: both one note and two note tremolos are possible.
A one-note or one-chord tremolo is indicated by strokes through the stem of the note or chord (or above/below if a
whole note). E.g.
In a two-note or two-chord tremolo, bars are drawn between the notes. E.g.
Tremolo symbols are also used to notate drum rolls.
Add a Tremolo
Single note/chord tremolo
1. If a single note, select that note; if a chord, select any note in the chord;
2. Click the desired symbol in the Tremolo palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Alternatively, you can drag the tremolo symbol onto the applicable note.
Two note/chord tremolo
1. Input the notes at half the desired final duration;
2. If a single note, select the first note of the pair; if a chord, select any note from the first chord;
3. Click the desired symbol in the Tremolo palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Alternatively, you can drag the tremolo symbol onto the applicable note.
Example: To enter a two-note tremolo with the duration of a half note (minim), enter two normal quarter notes (crotchets).
After applying a tremolo symbol to the first note, the note values automatically double to half notes.

Repeats and jumps
Simple repeats
You can create a simple repeat by placing a start and an end repeat barline at the beginning and end of a passage.
These can be applied from the Barlines or Repeats & Jumps palette.
Note: If the start of a repeat coincides with the 
beginning of a piece or 
section, the start repeat barline can be omitted if
desired. Similarly, an end repeat barline can be omitted at the end of a score or section.
1st and 2nd endings
102


First create a simple repeat (as shown above), then apply the first and second time endings—see 
Voltas.
Playback
Turn repeat playback on/off
Toggle the "Play Repeats" 
 button on the toolbar.
Adjust repeat section playback
Simple repeats, such as the ones illustrated above, or "1, 2" volta sections, usually play back correctly first time. More
complex repeats may need further adjustment as follows:
1. Ensure that the start and end barlines are correctly positioned. For a volta section, ensure that each volta, except
the last one, terminates with an end repeat barline.
2. In the case of a simple repeat, where more than one repeat is needed, right-click on the measure containing the
end repeat barline and select Measure properties. Adjust Play count so that it is equal to the number of times you
want the section to play back.
3. In the case of a complex volta section
, such as the following:
Make sure that the volta "Repeat list" is set up correctly—see Volta properties. Right-click on the measure
containing the end repeat barline and select Measure properties. Adjust Play count so that it is one greater than the
number of measures listed in the Volta "Repeat list." In this case, since 5 measures are listed, the "Play count"
needs to be set to 6.
Repeat symbols and text
Text and symbols related to repeats are located in the "
Repeats & Jumps" palette (in the Basic and Advanced
workspaces). This palette contains:
Symbols for measure repeat, Segno, Segno Variation (Serpent), Coda, and Coda Variation (Codetta)
D.S., D.C., al Coda, al Fine, To Coda, and Fine text
Repeat barlines
To add a repeat symbol to the score use either of the following:
Select a measure, then click the desired repeat symbol in the palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag and drop a repeat symbol from the palette 
onto (not above!) the desired measure (so the measure changes
color).
Jumps
Jumps are symbols in the score which tell the musician to skip to a named 
marker (see below). Jumps include the
various kinds of D.C. (Da Capo) and D.S. (Dal Segno) text.
To set correct playback of jumps:
Make sure that the "Play Repeats" 
 button on the toolbar is selected. This is a toggle, so you can turn off
playback by clicking the same button.
After the jump, and following established convention, only the last round of any simple repeat section is played back.
If you want playback to take these repeats in full:
103


1. Select the applicable jump symbol;
2. In the "Jump" section of the Inspector, check "Play Repeats".
Note: Jumps are taken only after all simple repeats in the section are played through.
If you click on a jump, some text boxes and a checkbox are displayed in the 
Jump section of the Inspector. These have
the following effects on playback:
Jump to: Playback jumps to the 
marker whose "Label" is the same as the "Jump to" tag.
Play until: Playback continues until it reaches a 
marker whose "Label" is the same as the "Play until" tag.
Continue at: Playback jumps to the next 
marker whose "Label" is the same as the "Continue" tag.
Play repeats: Ticking this box tells MuseScore to play repeats after D.C. (Da Capo) or D.S. (Dal Segno) jumps. If
this option is not ticked then simple Repeats are not taken after jumps and playback works as if it were the last
repeat.
Note: The tags start and end, referring to the beginning and end of a score or 
section, are implicit and don't need to
be added by the user.
Markers
Markers are the places referred to by the 
jumps. A list of markers (in addition to the implicit "start" and "end") follows:
: Segno (tag: segno)
: Segno Variation (tag: 
varsegno)
: Coda (tag: codab)
: Coda Variation (tag: 
varcoda)
Fine: (tag: fine)
To Coda: (tag: coda)
If you click on a marker, the following properties appears in the 
Marker section of the Inspector:
Marker type: This can be changed from the dropdown list, if required.
Label: This is the (identifier) tag associated with the marker. See also, 
Jumps (above).
Examples of jumps
Da Capo (D.C.): At the "D.C." sign, playback jumps to the start (i.e. to the implicit 
start tag) and plays the entire
score or section again (i.e. up to the implicit end tag).
Da Capo (D.C.) al Fine: At the "D.C. al Fine" sign, playback jumps to the start (i.e. to the implicit 
start tag) and plays
the score up to the Fine (i.e. the fine tag).
Dal Segno (D.S.) al Fine: At the "D.S. al Fine" sign, playback jumps to the 
Segno symbol (i.e. the segno tag) and
then plays up to the Fine (i.e. the fine tag)
Dal Segno (D.S.) al Coda: At the "D.S. al Coda" sign, playback jumps to the 
Segno symbol (i.e. the segno tag) and
then plays up to the To Coda (i.e. the coda tag). Playback then continues at the 
Coda symbol (i.e. the codab tag).
Note: The properties (i.e. the tag names) of jumps and markers can be set via the 
Inspector.
You need to modify them if using multiple jumps and markers.

Tuplets
104


Tuplets are used to write rhythms beyond the beat divisions usually permitted by the time signature. For example, a 
triplet
consists of three notes in the time of two:
And a duplet consists of two notes in the time of three:
Create a tuplet
The exact method of tuplet entry depends on whether you are starting off in 
Note input mode or Normal mode. We'll start
off with a simple example: the creation of an eighth note triplet.
Create a triplet in normal mode
1. Select a note or rest that specifies the full duration of the desired triplet group. In the case of an eighth note triplet,
you will need to select a quarter note or rest—as in the example below:
2. Press the keyboard shortcut for a triplet, Ctrl+3 (Mac: Cmd+3); alternatively use the menu, 
Add→Tuplets→Triplet. This will
give the following result:
3. The program automatically changes to note-input mode and selects the most appropriate duration—in this example
an eighth note. Now enter the desired series of notes/rests. For example:
Create a triplet in note input mode
1. Ensure you are in note input mode (press 
N).
2. Navigate to the note/rest (or blank measure) where you want the triplet to start (use the left/right arrow keys as
required).
3. Select a final duration for the whole triplet group. In the case of an eighth note triplet, click on the quarter note in the
note input toolbar (or press 5 on the keyboard).
4. Press the keyboard shortcut for a tuplet, Ctrl+3 (Mac: Cmd+3); alternatively, use the menu, 
Add→Tuplets→Triplet. This
creates a triplet number/bracket and appropriately divides the original note/rest (see image above).
5. The program automatically selects the most appropriate duration—in this example an eighth note—allowing you to
immediately start entering the desired series of notes/rests.
Create other tuplets
To create other tuplets substitute one of the following commands at the relevant step above:
Press Ctrl+2–9 (Mac: Cmd+2–9). 2 for a duplet, 3 for a triplet etc.
From the menu, select 
Add→Tuplets, then click on the desired option.
For more complex cases, see below.
Custom tuplets
To create other tuplets than the default options (e.g. 13 sixteenth notes in the space of one quarter note):
1. In Note input mode, select a note duration equaling the total duration of the tuplet; or, if in 
Normal mode, select a
note or rest of the desired overall duration;
2. Open the Create Tuplet dialog from the menu: 
Add→Tuplets→Other...;
105


3. Select the desired number ratio (e.g. 13/4 for thirteen sixteenth notes in the space of a quarter note) under
"Relation" in the "Type" section. Specify "Number" and "Bracket" using the radio buttons in the "Format" section;
4. Click OK to close the dialog:
5. Enter the desired series of notes/rests.
Triplet examples
Delete a tuplet
Use either of the following:
Select the number or bracket and press 
Del.
Select the entire tuplet, using the 
shift + click method, then press 
Del.
Select any element of the tuplet, then in Inspector, in the bottom right corner, press the Tuplet button, then press 
Del.
106


Change display of tuplets
Using the Inspector
To change the display properties of tuplets in the score, select the tuplet numbers/brackets, and adjust the desired
properties in the "Tuplet" section of the Inspector:
Direction: 'Auto' places the bracket/number in the 
default position. 'Up' always places the bracket 
above the note
heads; 'Down' always places the bracket 
below the note heads.
Number type: Choice of 'Number', 'Ratio', or 'Nothing'.
Bracket type: 'Automatic' hides the bracket for beamed notes and 
shows the bracket if the tuplet includes
unbeamed notes or rests. 'Bracket' displays the bracket. 'None' hides the bracket.
Using the Tuplets Style dialog
To make fine adjustments to the way that 
all tuplets in the score are displayed: from the menu, select 
Format →
Style...→Tuplets.
The legend below illustrates some of the properties that can be adjusted in the Tuplets style dialog:
(2) Vertical distance from stem.
(3) Vertical distance from note head.
(5) Distance before stem of first note.
(6) Distance after stem of last note.

Voltas
Volta brackets, or first and second ending brackets, are 
lines used to mark different endings for a simple repeat. Score
playback automatically follows the repeat indications.
To add a volta to the score
Use one of the following methods:
Select a measure, or range of measures and click a Volta icon in the 
Lines palette (double-click in versions prior to
3.4).
Drag-and-drop a volta from the Lines palette, then adjust the length as required (see below).
To change the number of measures that a volta covers
107


1. Go into Edit mode on the volta. The end handle is automatically selected.
2. Press Shift+→ to move the end handle 
forward one measure. Press Shift+← to move the handle 
backward one
measure. Repeat as required.
Note: When you select a start or end handle, a dashed line appears connecting it to an 
anchor point on the staff (see
diagram, below). This anchor shows the position of the playback start/end points of the Volta. The 
Shift commands change
the anchor point so playback always remains in sync with the visual start/end points. To make fine adjustments to the
visual start or end points, without affecting playback, use other keyboard arrow 
commands, or drag the handles with a
mouse.
Volta properties
To make changes to Volta text:
Select the volta, and edit the properties in the 
Text Line Core section of the Inspector.
To specify the order of repeats:
Select the volta, and in "Repeat list" (
Volta section of the Inspector) type in a number, or sequence of numbers
separated by commas, to indicate the repeat(s) in which the volta is to be played.
For example, a first ending shows the number "1"; a 
second ending, the number "2" and so on. More complex repeats
are also possible: e.g. a "Repeat list" displaying "1, 2, 4, 5, 7" indicates that the volta is to be played during repeats 1, 2,
4, 5, and 7, and so on.
Note: Each volta section, except the final one, needs to end with an 
end repeat barline.
Playback
Sometimes a repeat plays more than two times. If you want to change the number of times MuseScore plays a repeat, go
to the measure containing the end repeat barline and change its "Play count". See Measure operations: Other properties
and the note on playback for voltas in Repeats and jumps.
Play count
The play count of the measure with the end repeat barline must be set one higher than the number of times you want the
measure to play (this is usually equal to the number of entries in that volta repeat list + 1).
Take the following score:
Measure 4 should have play count set to 4
108


Measure 6 should have play count set to 3

in concert pitch instead. In the latter mode, the musical notation of 
all instruments matches the actual pitches that you hear
on playback.
To change the view to concert pitch: Press the Concert Pitch button to highlight it.
You should ensure that the Concert pitch button is OFF before printing the main score or any parts.
Change staff transposition
Instrument transpositions are already set up in MuseScore. However, if you want a rare instrument or transposition that is
not available in MuseScore, you may need to edit the instrument transposition manually.
1. Right-click an empty part of the instrument staff and select 
Staff/Part Properties….
2. At the bottom of the window, select the interval of transposition, any octave shifts, and whether the interval is "Up"
(sounds higher than written) or "Down" (sounds lower than written).
You can also use the 
Change Instrument… button in the Staff/Part Properties window to automatically change the
transposition to that of a different standard instrument.

Drum notation
Entering percussion notation is somewhat different to entering notation for pitched instruments (such as the piano or
violin).
Percussion staff types
When you create a percussion staff using the 
New Score Wizard or the Instruments dialog, MuseScore automatically
chooses the most appropriate staff type (1-, 3-, or 5-line) for the instrument: this can be changed, if required, using the
"Staff type" column on the Choose instruments / Instruments page. Any additional changes (e.g. to a 2-line staff) can be
made from the score itself (see Advanced Style Properties).
110


On a 5-line percussion staff, each instrument is assigned a vertical staff position (line or space) and a notehead shape.
For a drumset, one or two voices can be used. If the latter, 
voice 1 (the upper voice) usually contains (up-stem) notes
played by the hands while voice 2 (the lower voice) usually contains (down-stem) notes played by the feet (see image
below).
Note input methods
You can add notes to a percussion staff from any of the following:
External MIDI keyboard;
Piano keyboard (virtual);
Computer keyboard;
Mouse.
These methods can be used in any desired combination:
MIDI keyboard
To add notes to a percussion staff from a 
MIDI keyboard:
1. Ensure that the MIDI keyboard is connected and functioning correctly.
Note: If you click on the percussion staff without entering 
note input mode, you can demo the percussion
instruments from the MIDI keyboard.
2. Click on the note or rest where you want to start.
3. Enter note input mode.
4. Select the correct voice. For example, snares, sidesticks and all cymbals are normally added to voice 1; bass drum
to voice 2.
5. Set note duration.
6. Press an instrument key to add a note to the score. To add another note at the same position, keep the first key held
down while pressing the second key.
Note: Refer to a 
GM2 drum map for details about which MIDI keyboard key corresponds to which percussion instrument.
Some keyboards (e.g., Casio) display percussion symbols next to the keys as an aid to the user.
Piano keyboard
To add notes to a percussion staff from the virtual 
Piano Keyboard:
1. Ensure that the Piano keyboard is displayed. Press 
P (or select it from the menu, 
View → Piano Keyboard).
Note: If you click on the percussion staff without entering 
note input mode, you can demo the percussion
instruments from the Piano keyboard.
2. Click on the note or rest where you want to start.
3. Enter note input mode.
4. Select the correct voice. For example, snares, sidesticks and all cymbals are normally added to voice 1; bass drum
to voice 2.
5. Set note duration.
6. Click on a (virtual piano) key to add a note to the score.
7. To add another note to an existing one, press 
Shift and hold it while pressing the new note (in versions before 2.1,
use Ctrl (Mac: Cmd)).
Note: Refer to a 
GM2 drum map for details about which piano key corresponds to which percussion instrument.
By default, the piano keyboard is docked at the bottom of the screen—to the left of the Drum input palette. However you
can undock it by dragging, then dock the panel in several ways:
Drag the panel downwards to the center and it will overlay the Drum input palette, full length. Both panels can then
be accessed by Tabs.
Drag the panel downwards to the right/left and it will dock to the right/left of the Drum input palette.
Computer keyboard
111


To enter notes on a percussion staff using your computer keyboard:
1. Click on the note or rest where you want to start.
2. Enter note input mode. The Drum input palette now appears at the bottom of the screen (see 
below).
3. Select the desired 
note duration.
4. Press the shortcut key (A–G) for the instrument that you wish to enter—refer to the Drum input palette window.
5. If you wish to add another note to an existing one in that voice, press 
Shift+[A–G].
Note: Voice allocation is determined by the color of the note in the drum input palette: blue for voice 1, green for voice 2.
Mouse
To add a note to a percussion staff
Use the following method to add a 
new note or to replace an 
existing chord.
1. Select the note or rest where you want to start. You can also select a 
measure.
2. Press N to enter note input mode. The Drum input palette now appears at the bottom of the screen (see 
below).
3. Set note duration.
4. Choose one of the following options:
Double-click a note in the 
Drum input palette.
Select a note (e.g. Bass drum, or Snare) in the 
Drum input palette, then click a note or rest in the score.
To add a note to an existing chord in the percussion staff
1. Ensure you are in note input mode.
2. Select a note duration equal to the note you are adding to.
3. Click on the new note in the 
Drum input palette.
4. Click above or below the existing note in the percussion staff.
Note: Voice allocation is determined by the color of the note in the drum input palette: blue for voice 1, green for voice 2.
Drum input palette
When a percussion staff is selected and note input mode is ON, a window opens at the bottom of the screen called the
Drum input palette. This window is essential for mouse input, and displays shortcuts for computer keyboard input, but
can be ignored if using a MIDI keyboard or the virtual Piano Keyboard.
Each note in the palette represents a percussion instrument: hovering the mouse pointer over the note displays the
instrument name.
The letters A–G (shown above certain notes in the palette) are designated as shortcuts for entering particular instruments
(bass drum, snare, closed hi-hat etc.), rather than referring to note pitches. They can be changed or reallocated as
desired in the Edit Drumset window.
When the Drum input palette is open, double-clicking a note in the palette or entering a shortcut letter will add that
instrument note to the percussion staff. The color of the note in the palette shows the voice allocated for that note—blue
for voice 1, green for voice 2. This can be changed in the Edit Drumset dialog if required.
This voice allocation applies only to keyboard and mouse entry of notes: entry via a MIDI keyboard or the virtual Piano
keyboard allows any voice to be used.
Edit Drumset
To open the Edit Drumset window, use one of the following options:
Click on the Edit Drumset button at the left of the 
Drum input palette.
Right-click on a percussion staff and select "Edit Drumset...".
112


The Edit Drumset dialog displays the percussion instruments available and the MIDI notes/numbers to which they are
allocated. It also determines how each instrument is displayed on the staff— its name, position, notehead type and note-
stem direction. Any changes made here are automatically saved in the parent MuseScore file
.
Clicking on a row in the left-hand column allows you to edit the display properties for that note as follows:
Name: The name you want displayed in the Drum input palette when you mouse over the note. Leave empty to remove
this note from the Drum input palette.
Notehead group: Choose a notehead for that instrument from a drop-down list of options (
Note: choosing "Custom"
activates "Edit noteheads" (below).
Edit Noteheads: Allows you to customize the display further by specifying the noteheads for particular note durations.
Default voice: Assign to one of four voices. This does not affect input from a MIDI keyboard or the virtual Piano keyboard.
Staff line: This number indicates the staff line/space on which the note is displayed. "0" means that the note is displayed
on the top line of the 5-line staff. Negative numbers move the note upwards step by step, while positive numbers move it
downwards in the same way.
Shortcut: Assign a keyboard shortcut to enter that note.
Stem Direction: Auto, Up or down.
The customized drumset can be saved as a .drm file by pressing 
Save As.... You can also import a customized drumset
using the Load... button.
Sticking
To enter sticking symbols (R, L):
1. Select a start note;
2. From the menu, select 
Add→Text→Sticking. Alternatively, set up a keyboard shortcut to do the same thing in
Preferences;
3. Input the symbol just as you would normal text. To move forward or backwards to the next note, use the same
keyboard shortcuts as for chord symbols.
4. To exit, press Esc, or click on a blank section of the score.

Tablature
Music for fretted, stringed instruments is commonly notated using 
tablature, also known as 
tab, which provides a visual
representation of the strings and fret numbers:
113


Tablature can also be combined with traditional staff notation:
Create a new tablature staff
If you wish to create tablature as part of a new score, use the 
New Score Wizard. If you want to add tablature to an
existing score, use the Instruments dialog. Or, alternatively, you can convert an existing standard staff
. See below for
details.
With the New Score wizard
To create tablature in a new score (for combined staff/tablature systems see → 
below):
1. Open the New Score wizard.
2. Enter the score details (optional). Click 
Next.
3. On the Choose template file page, click on Choose Instruments under "General".
4. On the Instruments page, select the desired tablature in the "Strings – plucked" category, in the left-hand column.
Then click Add.
5. Complete the rest of the New Score Wizard.
Note: If the desired tablature is not available in the 
Choose Instrument list, add a tablature staff anyway at step 4
(above). Then edit the tablature to your exact requirements using the Staff/Part properties dialog.
With the Instruments dialog
To add a single tablature staff to an existing score (for combined staff/tab system see 
below):
1. Open the instruments dialog (press I; or from the menu bar, select 
Edit → Instruments…).
2. Click on the staff to which you want to add another (linked or not).
3. Add the tab staff as described in 
Add instruments ("Create a new score").
By changing staff type
To convert an existing standard staff to tablature, or tablature to a standard staff:
1. Right-click on the staff and select 
Staff/Part Properties…. If "Instrument" is already set to a plucked-strings type, then go
to step 3.
2. If "Instrument" is not a plucked-strings type, click on Change instrument and select an appropriate instrument from
"Strings – Plucked."
3. Click on Advanced Style properties, select the appropriate tablature option from "Template", then press 
< Reset to Template.
You can fine tune the display if necessary using the "Fret Marks" and "Note Values" tabs.
4. Click OK twice to exit.
Edit string data
Change tuning
Note: If you only want to 
view (rather than change) the instrument tuning, follow steps 1 and 2 only.
1. Right-click on the staff and select 
Staff/Part Properties….
114


2. Press the Edit String Data… button at the bottom of the dialog box. The 
String Data dialog opens:
3. Click on a string pitch and select Edit String…. Or, alternatively, just double-click the string pitch.
4. Select a new pitch in the 
Note Selection box and click OK. Or, alternatively, just double-click the new pitch.
5. Click OK to close the "String Data" dialog box. Then click 
OK to close the 
"Staff/Part Properties" dialog.
Notes: (1) If tuning is changed when the tablature for that instrument already contains some notes, fret marks will be
adjusted automatically (if possible); (2) Any change of tuning to a particular instrument applies only to the score at hand,
and does not change any program default settings.
Add a string
1. Right-click on the staff, select Staff/Part Properties…, then press 
Edit String Data.
2. Click on a string pitch and select New String....
3. Select the new pitch and press 
OK—or, alternatively, just double-click the new pitch. The new string is inserted
below the selected string.
Note: After adding a tablature string you will need to adjust the number of lines in the 
Staff/Part properties dialog.
Delete a string
1. Right-click on the staff, select Staff/Part Properties…, then press 
Edit String Data.
2. Click on a string pitch and select Delete String.
Note: After deleting a tablature string you will need to adjust the number of lines in the 
Staff/Part properties dialog.
Mark unfretted string "open"
115


This feature is used to mark a (bass) course as unstopped (i.e. like a harp string, only played in the open position): as on a
Baroque lute or Theorbo etc. This means that only "0" (zero) or "a" is accepted as a fret mark: any other fret mark will be
converted to 0/a.
1. Right-click on the staff, select Staff/Part Properties…, then press 
Edit String Data.
2. Check one or more boxes in the "Open" column.
Change number of instrument frets
This property defines the maximum fret number which can be entered on a tablature staff.
1. Right-click on the staff, select Staff/Part Properties…, then press 
Edit String Data.
2. Select or enter a new number in the "
Number of frets" spin box.
Change tablature display
From Staff / Part Properties
To access the full range of tablature display options, use the 
Staff / Parts Properties dialog:
1. Right-click on the staff and select 
Staff/Part Properties….
2. Click on the Advanced Style Properties… button.
From the Instruments dialog
Some basic tablature display options are available from the 
Instruments dialogue:
1. Press the keyboard shortcut I; or from the menu bar, select 
Edit → Instruments….
2. Select a tablature type from the drop-down list under "Staff Type" in the right-hand pane:
Simple: Displays fretmarks only. Best for staff/tablature systems.
Common: Displays fretmarks, note stems and beams.
Full: Displays fretmarks, enhanced note stems, beams, and rests.
Tab 6 str. Italian/French: Historical tablature options for the lute.
The same options are available from the 
Choose Instruments page of the New Score Wizard.
Combine pitched staff with tablature
Plucked-string instruments—such as the guitar—are commonly notated using both a music staff 
and tablature (TAB)
together. MuseScore gives you the option of having the two staves either unlinked or linked:
1. Unlinked Staves: The advantage of using this option is that each staff can be edited independently. To transfer
music notation from one staff to the other, select the desired range and 
copy and paste it onto the other staff.
2. Linked Staves: The staves are "mutually updating": i.e. any change you make to the notation in one staff is
immediately applied to the other staff as well.
A note on fret mark conflicts: When the same note is entered in two different voices, MuseScore tries to ensure that the
fret marks do not overlap on the same string. Any overlaps which do occur are marked with red squares: these appear
only in the document window and 
not on any printed copy. In almost all cases (e.g. frets 0 to 4 on the 6th string),
overlapping is the desired result and no further adjustment is required. You can hide the red marks by selecting "View"
and unticking "Show Unprintable."
Create a new staff/tablature pair with the New Score Wizard
1. Open the New Score wizard.
2. Enter the score details (optional). Click 
Next.
3. On the Choose template file page, click on Choose Instruments under "General".
4. Select a music staff (not tab) in the "Strings – Plucked" section of the left-hand column. Then click 
Add.
5. In the right-hand column, click on the newly-created line, labelled "Staff 1". This reveals the "Add Staff/Linked Staff"
options in the centre column:
Click Add Staff to create an unlinked staff/tab pair.
Click Add Linked Staff to create a 
linked staff/tab pair.
6. In the Staff type column, click on the dropdown list for the newly-created staff and select a tablature option (this can
be modified later, if required, on the score page—see Staff/Part Properties).
7. Change the staff order using the 
↑ button if needed.
8. Complete the rest of the New Score Wizard, or click 
Finish.
Note: To create unlinked staves with 
separate mixer channels, instead of step "5" (above), select a Tablature staff in the
left-hand column and click Add. Then continue with steps 6 and 7.
Create a new staff/tablature pair in an existing score
116


1. Open the Instruments editor (press I, or from the menu bar, select 
Edit → Instruments…).
2. Then follow steps 4–8 above.
Create a staff/tablature pair from an existing staff
To add tablature to a plucked-string staff in the score (or vice versa):
1. Open the Instruments editor (press I, or from the menu bar, select 
Edit → Instruments…).
2. In the right-hand column, select the staff you want to create the staff/tab pair from, then follow one of the options
shown in step 5 above.
3. Continue with steps 6–8 above.
Enter notes in tablature
Using a computer keyboard
1. In Normal mode, select the measure or existing note from which you want to begin note entry.
2. Switch to note input mode (
N): a short 'blue rectangle' appears around one tablature string: this is the 
current string.
3. Select the duration of the note or rest that you wish to enter (see below).
4. Press the up/down arrow keys to move the cursor to the desired string. Use the left/right arrow keys to navigate
through the score.
5. Press 0 to 9 to enter a fret mark from 0 to 9 on the current string; to enter numbers with several digits press each
digit in sequence. Keys A to K (skipping I) can also be used: convenient when working in French tablature. For 
L , M,
N, use the alphanumeric keyboard and type respectively 10, 11, 12... (Note: You cannot enter a number higher than
the "Number of frets" value set in the Edit String Data dialog).
Press ; (semicolon) to enter a rest of the selected duration.
6. You can enter notes in different 
voices if required—just as you would in a standard staff.
See also, Edit notes (below).
Historical tablature
Period notation for bass strings (lutes and sim.) is supported:
French tablature: letters with prefixed slash-like strokes right under the tab body: i.e. 7th string: "a", 8th string: "/a",
9th string: "//a" and so on, all in the first position below the tab body.
Italian tablature: numbers with 'ledger line'- like segment of string above the tab body: i.e. 7th string: "0" one
position above the tab body with one 'ledger line'; 8th string: "0" two positions above the tab body with two 'ledger
lines' and so on.
Input of fretmarks is via computer keyboard only: by moving the note entry cursor below (French) or above (Italian) the tab
body, 'shadow' slashes or ledger lines will indicate the target string to which the fret mark will be applied; pressing one of
the fret keys, will enter (and lay out) the note on that string.
Using a mouse
To enter notes into tablature with a mouse:
Enter note input mode and select the note or rest duration (see 
below).
Click on a string to create a note there. Notes are initially created on fret 0 (or 
a for French tablatures): to correct,
type in the right number from the keyboard.
You can also increase/decrease the fret mark using 
Alt+Shift+↑ or Alt+Shift+↓.
You can enter notes in different 
voices
 if required—just as you would in a standard staff.
See also, Edit notes (below).
Select note duration
In note input mode, you can use any of the following methods to set note duration in tablature:
Press Shift+1 to Shift+9: Sets duration from a 128th note to a longa (availability of these shortcuts may depend on the
platform and/or keyboard layout);
Press NumPad1 to NumPad9: Sets duration from a 128th note to a longa (if a numeric keypad exists and NumLock is on);
Click on a note duration icon in the 
Note Input toolbar above the document window;
Press Q to decrease the selected duration and 
W to increase it.
Edit notes
117


Change fret number
In Note input mode:
Position the cursor above the fret mark and retype the desired number.
Increment or decrement the fret mark using 
Alt+Shift+↑ or Alt+Shift+↓ (The fret mark automatically changes strings, if
necessary, to achieve the lowest possible fret position).
In Normal mode:
1. Select one or more fret marks.
2. Use any of the following commands:
To increment or decrement, without changing the string: Press 
↑ / ↓.
To increment or decrement, changing strings, when possible, to minimize the fret number: Press 
Alt+Shift+↑ / ↓
Note: The fret mark cannot be higher than the "Number of frets" value set in the 
Edit String Data dialog.
Change string number
To move the fret mark to an adjacent string without changing the pitch (if the string is free and can produce that note):
In Note input mode:
Position the cursor over a fret mark, and press 
Ctrl+↑ / ↓ (Mac: Cmd+↑ / ↓).
In Normal mode:
Select one or more fret marks, and press 
Ctrl+↑ / ↓ (Mac: Cmd+↑ / ↓).
Drag a fret mark up or down to an adjacent string.
Crosshead notes
To change a fret mark to a crosshead note:
1. Select one or more fret marks (in non-note-input mode).
2. Press Shift+X to toggles ghost noteheads on/off.

Sound and playback
MuseScore has "Sound and playback" capabilities built-in. This chapter covers the playback controls and ways to extend
the instrument sounds.
External links
How to restore sound if playback stops working
Mid-staff instrument changes
When a musician is required to double on a different instrument for a section of a piece, the instruction to switch
instruments is generally placed above the staff at the beginning of that section. A return to the primary instrument is
handled in the same manner.
MuseScore enables users to insert a special class of text called 
Change Instrument text for this purpose. This class of
text is different from either Staff or System text in that it links the text to the playback and changes the sound to the new
instrument.
Effect of instrument change
When an instrument change is made:
The sound played will be changed to that of the new instrument from that point onward, but the 
mixer display
remains unchanged.
Subsequent notes are automatically adjusted to indicate the correct 
written pitch for the new instrument (but the new
key signature still needs to be added manually—see 
below).
The new instrument name will be displayed in front of the following systems.
Add an instrument change
1. Select the start point of the change by clicking on a note or rest;
2. Open the main palette by typing F9 (or from the 
View menu), and click on Text to open the text sub-palette:
3. A click on the Change Instr text in the palette opens the dialog (double-click in versions prior to 3.4)
The top box shows the current instrument, the bottom the list of selectable instruments;
4. Choose the instrument, then click OK. When an instrument is selected and the OK button is pressed, the text
119


indicating which instrument the player will use appears in the score.
5. Insert a new key signature, if required, at the change, for the staff in question.
Note: Mid-staff instrument changes are limited to the 
same type of staff. For example, you cannot change between a
percussion staff and a pitched instrument staff or vice versa.

How to change instrument sound (e.g. pizz., con sordino) midway through score
 (MuseScore HowTo)
Mixer
The Mixer allows you to change instrument sounds, adjust volume and panning, and make other adjustments to the
playback for each staff.
Opening the Mixer
To display/hide the mixer, use one of the following:
Press F10 (Mac: Fn+F10).
From the main menu, select 
View→Mixer.
The Mixer is split into a Details Area on the top and a 
Track Area below.
Track Area
The track area is at the bottom and displays the 
Master Gain as well as a row of tracks. The Track Area displays allows
you to adjust the volume of the instruments used by your staves. Clicking on one of the panels selects it, and also allows
you to edit other instrument parameters, such as choice of instrument, name, pan, chorus, reverb, etc. in the Details area.
MuseScore creates one "part track" for each staff in your score. These part tracks can be further subdivided into "channel
tracks" corresponding to the different sounds used within the staff. While many staves only need a single channel track,
others require multiple channels so that the instrument can play more than one sound (e.g. a violin which can play in arco,
tremolo or pizzicato voices); or because of a Mid-staff instrument change. These extra channel tracks can be shown or
hidden by clicking the arrow button on top of the track control.
120


Expanded part track, showing the child tracks in pink.
Master Gain
The Master Gain controls the overall output volume. To adjust it, click and drag the slider handle or enter a value in the
box underneath.
Channel display arrow
Every part track has a button on the top with an arrow on it, enabled, when that instrument has multiple channels, like
e.g. violin (for arco, pizzicato, tremolo), disabled otherwise. When clicked, this will toggle whether the channel tracks of the
staff are displayed next to it. Channel tracks do not have an arrow button. Instead, the name of the track they are a part
of is displayed.
Mute and Solo
At the top of each track is a green 
solo button and a red mute button: each can be toggled on or off. If any Solo button is
checked then only tracks that have solo lit will play. If no solo is lit, all parts can potentially play. Mute does the opposite:
any track that has mute lit will not play. By using a combination of mute and solo buttons, you can control which
instruments are heard during playback.
Pan
The dial below the mute button controls panning left and right. You can click and drag on the dial to change the pan value.
Note: MuseScore does not yet support pan values for the part track, so the part track displays the pan value of the first
channel instead. Setting the pan value of the part track will automatically set all of its children to the same value as well.
Volume
The slider in the middle of the track controls the playback volume. 
Note: MuseScore does not yet support volume values
for the part track, so the part track displays the volume value of the first channel instead. Setting the volume value of the
part track will automatically set all of its children to the same value as well.
Track name
The text box at the bottom of the track contains the current name of the track's part or channel.
Details Area
The details area displays and provides finer control of the currently selected track.
121


Name
The name of the part this track is associated with. Both part tracks and channel tracks display the part name. Note: The
part name is editable, but this only have effect for the Mixer. The channel name is not editable.
Channel
If a channel track is selected, the channel name is displayed here.
Drumset
Indicates if this part represents a melodic instrument or a drumkit. For regular melodic instruments, each pitch in the same
patch usually has the same timbre, while drumkit patches usually have different timbres for each pitch.
Sound (formerly Patch)
To change the sound in a track:
1. Click on the desired track so that its details appear in the 
Details area
.
2. Click on the "Sound" dropdown list and select another instrument.
The "Sound" drop-down menu lists every instrument supported by your current 
SoundFont. If you have multiple
SoundFonts loaded in the Synthesizer, all the patches from all the SoundFonts (and/or SFZ files) will appear in the order
set in the Synthesizer.
Tip: To find an instrument, click on the "Sound" list and type the first letter of the instrument name. Repeat as required.
Volume
The overall loudness with which the sound is played.
Pan
The panning applied to the part.
Track color
To change the change the color of the track area:
Click the colored rectangle to enter the color palette, and make the desired changes.
Setting the color of a part track will automatically change the colors of all its child tracks as well.

This allows you to mute individual voices within each staff. Each row represents a different staff within a part. So pressing
'2' on the top row will mute the second voice on the first staff of the part.
Hide Details Button
At the bottom of the detail area is a wide button with a tiny triangle on it. Clicking this button will hide the detail area to give
you more room. Clicking on it again will restore the detail area.
Note: From Preferences > Score it is possible to check the box Show MIDI controls in the Mixer to preset it expanded
when opening the Mixer.
Mid-staff sound change (pizz., con sordino, etc.)
Some instruments come with multiple channels in the Mixer that can be used to change sounds midway through a score.
For example, a staff for a stringed instrument (violin, viola, cello etc.) is allocated three channels: one for "arco" (or
"normal"), another for "pizzicato" and another for "tremolo." A trumpet staff will have one channel for "normal" and another
reserved for "mute," and so on.
The following instructions use pizzicato strings as an example, but the same principle can be applied to any other
instrument staff that allows sound changes.
1. Select the first note of the section you want to be pizzicato;
2. From the main menu, choose 
Add→Text→Staff Text or use the shortcut 
Ctrl+T;
3. Type "pizz." This text is for visual reference only and does not affect playback;
4. Right-click on the applied staff text and select 
Staff Text Properties…;
5. In the "Change Channel" tab of the "Staff Text Properties" dialog, select one or more voices on the left;
6. From the dropdown menu, select 
pizzicato;
7. Click OK to return to the score.
Every note after the staff text you added now sounds pizzicato. To return to a normal strings sound later in the piece,
follow the same guidelines as above except type "arco" in step 3 and select arco in step 6.
Most of the time is it far easier to just apply the corresponding text (pizz., tremolo, arco, mute, open, etc) from the Text
Palette.

 (MuseScore HowTo)
Piano Roll Editor
The Piano Roll Editor allows you edit individual notes and tweak aspects of their playback.
Opening the Piano Roll Editor
To open the Piano Roll Editor (PRE), right-click on a measure in the score and choose the Piano Roll Editor option from
the context menu. The Piano Roll Editor will open showing the staff and measure where you clicked. If the Piano Roll
123


Editor is already open, it will be updated to show the new staff and measure you clicked on.
Overview
The Piano Roll Editor is divided into several sections. At the very top is a row of buttons and controls that affect 
playback
and can modify notes. The name of the part being edited is at the top right.
The central portion contains the Note Display Area which allows you to view and edit notes. Each note is displayed as a
block, with yellow blocks representing selected notes, and darker green blocks representing unselected notes (these
colors can be changes in the Preferences). Given sufficient space, each block will display its pitch on the left and the voice
it is assigned to on the right. Changing the size of the note blocks is covered in the navigation section.
To the left of the Note Display Area is the 
Keyboard. By clicking on a key in the Keyboard, you can hear a sample of that
note playing. As you move the mouse in either the Node Display Area or the Keyboard, a key on the keyboard will light,
corresponding to the pitch you are over. You can also hover your mouse over a particular key to get more information
about that pitch. If you are using a Drumkit, the keys of the keyboard will show the name of the drum assigned to that
particular pitch. For instruments that are not concert C, the keyboard will be adjusted so that the C of the keyboard
matches the C of the instrument.
124


Along the top of the Note Display Area is the 
Measure Ruler which displays the current position of the playback head, as
well as the current looping range if it set.
The bottom of the editor contains the 
Levels Display Area. It is a bar graph showing extra data values assigned to each
note, such as its velocity or cutoff time. To the left of the Levels Display Area is a dropdown menu allowing you to select
the type of data you wish to see displayed or edited.
Navigation
There are several ways to move about in the Piano Roll Editor. First of all, you can click and drag on the scroll bars on the
edges of the Note Display Area.
The mouse wheel can also be used to pan and zoom as follows:
Scroll vertically: Mouse wheel.
Scroll horizontally: Shift + mouse wheel.
Zoom vertically: Ctrl + mouse wheel.
Zoom horizontally: Ctrl+Shift + mouse wheel.
To jump to a particular measure, switch back to score view and find the measure you wish to see. Then right-click on the
measure and select Piano Roll Editor. The Piano Roll Editor will scroll to center on the measure you clicked.
Selecting Notes
In the Note Display Area, you can click on single notes or click and drag to select a group of notes. Holding down the
modifier keys will affect how your selection changes:
Shift: Invert existing selection: i.e. notes that were previously selected are deselected, and notes which were not
selected are selected. Useful for toggling a note between selected and not selected.
Ctrl: Add notes to selection.
Ctrl+Shift: Subtract notes from selection.
Editing Notes
To change the pitch of a selection of notes
: Drag a selected note up or down to a new pitch; or press the 
↑ or ↓ arrows.
Note: Dragging the note horizontally to change the start time is not supported at the moment.
To delete a selection of notes: Press the Del key.
To move a note selection to another voice: Click the desired voice number button at the top of the editor.
To add notes:
Notes can be inserted by clicking in the Piano Note Area with the modifier keys held. These edit operations will use the
beat or subbeat line to the left of the spot where you click as the point where a note is altered:
Ctrl: A note of the current insert note duration will be added at the subbeat and pitch where you clicked. The note
insert length is the same as the one you use to add notes in note entry mode in the score. If you wish to change the
duration, you will need to select this in the Score View as the Piano Roll Editor does not currently have these
buttons. If notes already exist in this location, a chunk will be cut out of them to make room for the note you are
inserting, unless they happen to have the same start time and duration of the note you're adding, in which case the
new note will simply be appended to the existing chord. Tuplets are currently not supported, and so will be ignored.
125


Shift: Looks for a chord that already spans this subbeat line. If it finds one, appends a new pitch to the existing chord.
Otherwise, this is a rest and the rest will be replaced with a note of equal start time and duration to the existing rest.
Ctrl+Shift: Looks for a chord or rest that spans this subbeat. This chord will be cut in two at this subbeat line. Tuplets
are currently not supported, and so will be ignored.
To edit note event data:
Note event data can be changed in the Levels Display Area. To edit event data such as velocity or cutoff time, first select
the notes you wish to edit in the note area. Then click in the Levels Display Area on the corresponding bar; the value of
the level will changed to correspond to the point where you clicked. You can also click and drag in this area to change the
levels of several notes with a single gesture. If you want the levels to all be set to the same value, hold Shift while
dragging. Only selected notes will have their value changed - this is to prevent you from accidentally changing the values
of other notes.
The Levels area can display the same data in multiple ways. For example, velocity data can be displayed both as
absolute (i.e., relative to the output midi volume) and relative (i.e., as an offset to the dynamics value). You can switch
between these display modes as you see fit.

Cursor
Provides feedback on the current measure and pitch of the position of the mouse within the Note Display Area.
Subdiv
Subdivides the beat by adding extra divisions to the Note Display Area. The value indicated the number of time the
beat will be subdivided. So for 4/4 time, a division of 2 will draw grid lines at every eighth note; a division of 3 at
every sixteenth note, and so on. Setting the subdivision is necessary for some editing operations if you wish to place
notes off the beat.
For larger numbers of subdivisions, you may need to be zoomed in to see the extra grid lines since grid lines are not
drawn below a certain density. Combines with the tuplet control which also affects grid line placement.
Tuplet
Adds additional grid lines, subdividing the beat to show the rhythmic placement of tuplets. For example, setting
tuplets to 3 will show the beat subdivided into three parts. Combines with the subdiv control to show subdivisions of
the tuplet. For example, setting tuplets to 3 and subdiv to 2 will draw grid lines showing the tuplet beats subdivided
into two parts - i.e., the beat will be subdivided into 6.
Selecting a tuplet mode other than 1 will disable some of the note insertion tools for the Piano Roll Editor. For larger
numbers of subdivisions, you may need to be zoomed in to see the extra grid lines since grid lines are not drawn
below a certain density.
Stripe pattern
Changes the pattern of stripes shown behind the notes in the Note Display Area. By default the pitches of C major
are highlighted, but you can change this to highlight the pitches of a different key, or even scales such as the
diminished or whole tone.
Velocity
Shows the velocity of the currently selected note (only one note may be selected). Indicates the loudness of the
note. This can be expressed as 'Offset' or 'User':
Offset: Value is treated as a multiplier for the velocity already set by the dynamics.
User: This is the raw value being sent to MIDI and overrides the dynamics value. Values are between 0 and
127, where 64 is "middle, neither loud nor soft".
When you switch from User to Offset or vice versa, the value will be recalculated to best match the value in the
other system. This way you could, for example, switch to User mode to set the value as you would like it to sound in
MIDI output and then switch to Offset so that this value respects the dynamic marking instead of overriding it. At the
moment you switch back, the offset value will be recalculated to match the User value in loudness but will no longer
act as an override so you may later change the dynamic.
Pitch
Shows the pitch and octave of the selected note in text format (i.e. f#4).
The pitch will change if the note is dragged Up or down to a new pitch. Currently cannot be edited.
OnTime
Shifts the start of the note in time, which can be used to modify the playing style. Negative values will make the note
sound earlier, positive will make it sound later. The duration of the note corresponds to a value of 1000 (e.g. setting
the value to 250 will make the note sound 1/4 of its duration later).
Length
127


Set the time that the note is sounding, which may be used to modify the degree of "legato". Lower values will make
the note sound more staccato, higher values will make it sound more legato. The duration of the note corresponds to
a length of 1000, but the value can be set higher. 950 is usually considered "non-legato".
Keyboard
Some keys are hooked up to perform special actions:
↑: Move selected notes up one semitone
↓: Move selected notes down one semitone
Del: Delete selected notes
Space: Start/stop playback
Customization
The Piano Roll Editor will display in both normal mode and dark mode. If you wish to change the colors the Piano Roll
Editor uses to display in these modes, they can be adjusted in the Preferences under the Advanced tab. All the Piano Roll
Editor related properties begin with ui/pianoroll/light for light mode and ui/pianoroll/dark for dark mode.

3. Click on the associated "Set as style" button (to the right of that box, you may need to scroll a bit)
Alternatively, you can mute the playback track(s) in the 
mixer—see below. This might be necessary, for example, when
you have chord symbols on more than one staff and want to have playback for only one of them. Score parts need to be
adjusted separately.
To turn playback of a SELECTION of chord symbols on/off
:
1. Select a range of symbols.
2. Right-click a chord symbol or Nashville number.
3. Click on Select→Select all similar elements in selected range , OK.

3. In the "Chord Symbol" section of the 
Inspector check/uncheck the "Play" box.
Note: This does not affect the parts which need to be adjusted seperately.
Change playback sound
The default sound for chord symbols is "Grand Piano". As of version 3.5.1, scores created from Guitar solo 
templates, use
"Nylon String Guitar" instead.
To change the chord symbol playback sound:
1. Open the Mixer (shortcut: F10, Mac: Fn+F10)
2. In the Track area locate the track for the part in question.
3. Click on the "Show channels" arrow to display all the 
child tracks for that part.
4. Click on the track whose name contains the words "harmony" or "Chord syms." (may be truncated, should be the
rightmost).
5. Select a new "Sound" in the Sound drop-down list.
This setting is shared between score and parts.
Change playback volume / Mute track
1. Open the Mixer (shortcut: F10, Mac: Fn+F10)
2. In the Track area locate the track for the part in question.
3. Click on the "Show channels" arrow to display all the 
child tracks for that part.
4. Click on the track whose name contains the words "Chord syms." (may be truncated, should be the rightmost).
5. Adjust the volume slider; or press the "M" button to mute the track.
You'd need to do this for the score and/or the parts, separately.
Turn symbol sound on/off when editing
To turn the sound of the symbols on/off when editing:
1. From the menu, select 
Edit (Mac: MuseScore)→Preferences…→Note input.
2. Check/Uncheck the "Play chord symbol when editing" option.
Interpretation and voicing of chord symbols
If desired, you can adjust the playback properties of selected chord symbols as follows:
1. Select one or more chord symbols.
2. In the Inspector make changes as follows:
Interpretation. The options are:
Literal;
Jazz. This adds color tones (e.g. the major 9th) but 
may also omit certain notes—this depends on both
the chord itself and the context (the next chord in particular).
Voicing. Options are:
Auto
Root only = Just the bass note;
Close = arranges the notes within the span of an octave;
130


Drop 2 = lowers the second highest note of the chord by one octave;
Six Note;
Four Note = 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th intervals;
Three Note.
Note: All voicings include a bass note, 2 octaves below the root note of the chord.
Duration: Options are
Until next chord symbol
Until measure end
Chord/rest duration.
The following shows how the Interpretation and Voicing options affect the playback of a C major seventh symbol (Cmaj7
or CM7).
Note: The "Close" and "Auto" Voicing options are the same for this particular chord, but this isn't necessarily the case for
every chord. So if you specifically want "Close", it is best to make the option explicit.
SoundFonts and SFZ files
Audio playback is provided by MuseScore's onboard 
synthesizer, which houses a large selection of 
virtual (or software)
instruments—including percussion and sound effects.
MuseScore supports virtual instruments in two formats:
SoundFont (.sf2/.sf3): A single file containing one or more virtual instruments.
SFZ (.sfz): A set of audio and definition files containing one or more virtual instruments.
SoundFonts
MuseScore comes with its own GM (
General MIDI
) SoundFont, MuseScore_General.sf3, containing over 128
instruments, sound effects and various drum/percussion kits.
GM (General MIDI) is a universal format, so once your score is set up for correct playback using MuseScore's native
Soundfont, you should be able to export it in a format of your choice and have it play back on any other user's computer.
Many different Soundfonts are available on the Internet: some free, some commercial. For a list of free soundfonts, see
below.
Install a SoundFont
After finding and decompressing a SoundFont (see →
below), double-click to open it. In most cases, the SoundFont file
type will already be associated with MuseScore, and MuseScore will start and a dialog will appear asking if you want to
install the SoundFont. Occasionally an application other than MuseScore will be associated with the SoundFont file type; if
this is the case, you will need to right-click or Ctrl-click on the file, so as to display a menu from which you can choose to
open the file in MuseScore. In either case, when the dialog appears asking if you want to install the SoundFont, click
"Yes" to place a copy of the SoundFont file in MuseScore's SoundFonts directory. This directory can be viewed or
changed in MuseScore's Preferences, but the default location is:
Windows: %HOMEPATH%\Documents\MuseScore3\Soundfonts
macOS and Linux: ~/Documents/MuseScore3/Soundfonts
In contrast to user-added SoundFonts, the initial default SoundFont installed with MuseScore is located in a system
directory, meant only for that purpose, which should not be modified. This directory and its default SoundFont file is:
Windows x86 (32-bit) / MuseScore x86: 
%ProgramFiles%\MuseScore 3\sound\MuseScore_General.sf3
Windows x64 (64-bit) / MuseScore x86: 
%ProgramFiles(x86)%\MuseScore 3\sound\MuseScore_General.sf3
Windows x64 (64-bit) / MuseScore x86_64: 
%ProgramFiles%\MuseScore 3\sound\MuseScore_General.sf3
macOS: /Applications/MuseScore 3.app/Contents/Resources/sound/MuseScore_General.sf3
Linux (Ubuntu): /usr/share/mscore-xxx/sounds/MuseScore_General.sf3 (with xxx being the MuseScore version)
131


Uninstall
To uninstall a SoundFont, simply open the folder where its file is installed and delete it.
SFZ
An SFZ is a collection of files and directories, an SFZ file and a bunch of actual sound files in WAV or FLAC format, with
the SFZ file being a text file that basically describes what sound file is located where and to be used for what instrument
and pitch range.
Install an SFZ
After downloading an SFZ (see →below), you need to manually extract all the files that belong to the SFZ (the SFZ file(s)
and all the sub-directories and other files) into the directory listed above. Leave the sub-directories and their contents as
they are. Note, however, that on occasion, an SFZ file in its folder may seek the actual WAV sound files inside the SFZ
sub-directory itself, usually in a folder labeled "Libs". If the SFZ zip file you download has a Libs folder in it, move it into the
main SFZ sub-directory.
Uninstall
To uninstall an SFZ, simply open the folder where its files are installed (see 
above) and delete them all.
Synthesizer
Once a SoundFont has been installed on your system, it also needs to be loaded into the 
Synthesizer. See To load a
soundfont.
Mixer
The Mixer allows you to easily change the sounds for each staff (even while the score is playing). For further details, see
Mixer.

Unzipping downloaded soundfonts
Since soundfonts are large, they are often zipped (compressed) into a variety of formats, including .zip, .sfArk, and .tar.gz.
You need to unzip (decompress) these files before they can be used.
ZIP is standard compression format supported by most operating systems.
sfArk is a compression format designed especially for compressing SoundFont files. To decompress it, use
Polyphone
 (cross-platform software); or this online service: 
https://cloudconvert.com/sfark-to-sf2
.tar.gz is a popular compression format for Linux. Windows users can use 
7-Zip
; Mac users can use 
The
Unarchiver
, or macOS' built-in Archive Utility. Note that if using 7-Zip, you will need to apply decompression twice
—once for GZip and once for TAR.
Troubleshooting
If the toolbar play panel is greyed out, or not visible, follow the instructions below to get your sound working again:
1. Right-click on the menu bar and make sure there is a check mark next to the 
Playback Controls menu item. If this step
does not solve your problem, go to Step 2.
2. If the play panel disappears after changing the SoundFont, go to 
Edit → Preferences... → I/O tab and click OK without
making any changes. After restarting MuseScore, the play panel should reappear.
If you are setting up a SoundFont for the first time, please use one of the recommended SoundFonts listed above.
If playback stutters, then your computer may not be able to handle the SoundFont being used. The following advice may
help:
Reduce the amount of RAM (memory) used by MuseScore by using a smaller SoundFont. See the 
list above for
suggestions.
Increase the amount of RAM available for MuseScore by quitting all applications except MuseScore. If you still have
problems and a large SoundFont is important to you, consider more RAM for your computer.

Triplet in tempo marking
Often this notation is used to indicate swing:
MuseScore does not have a way to include a triplet in text as a tempo marking, but there is an easy workaround:
1. Add Swing text as described above and make it invisible (shortcut 
V, or untick "Visible" in the 
Inspector);
2. Add an appropriate Image of the required tempo marking to the score. These can be downloaded from the bottom of
the "How To" page: How to create a visual swing marking
.
3. Resize and reposition the image as required.
Return to straight rhythm
If you want playback to return to straight time after a swing section, use one of the following options:
Use and modify a Swing text. (prior to version 3.4).
1. Add Swing text to the first note or rest of the "straight" section (see above).
2. Edit the text to indicate a return to straight time: e.g. "Straight."
3. Right-click on the text and select System Text Properties…. Click on the "Swing Settings" tab and set "Swing to "Off."
Use the Straight text
 as per version 3.4.
Add Straight text from the Master palette text to the first note or rest of the "straight" section (see 
above).
Apply swing globally
If you wish to apply swing to the whole score, you can do so from the menu:
1. Select Format → Style... → Score.
2. In the "Swing Settings" section, set the desired note value and "swing ratio."

Synthesizer
Overview
To display the Synthesizer: from the menu, select 
View→Synthesizer.
The Synthesizer controls MuseScore's sound output and allows you to:
Load and organize different sound sample libraries to play back the music.
Apply effects such as reverb and compression.
Adjust overall tuning.
Alter the output volume.
Select Midi Continuous Controllers to use with Single Note Dynamics (versions 3.1 and above).
The Synthesizer window is divided into the following sections/tabs:
Fluid: A software synthesizer that plays SF2/SF3 
SoundFont sample libraries.
Zerberus: A software synthesizer that plays SFZ format sample libraries.
Master Effects: Used to apply 
multi-effects to the score.
Tuning: Used to adjust overall playback 
tuning.
Dynamics (versions 3.1 and above): Used to configure Single Note Dynamics Midi controllers.
Save/Load Synthesizer settings
The buttons at the bottom of the Synthesizer window have the following functions:
Button
Function
Set as
Default
Saves all current synthesizer settings as the 
default settings. These are automatically applied to the
Synthesizer when you open MuseScore.
Load Default Loads the last saved default settings to the Synthesizer.
Save to
Score
Saves all current synthesizer settings to the 
current score only.
Load from
Score
Loads the settings from the current score to the synthesizer.
136


Notes: (1) "Synthesizer settings" include the order of SoundFonts and SFZ files, effects set-up, master tuning and volume.
(2) Only one set of Synthesizer settings can be in effect at a time—i.e. if multiple scores are open at once, it is not
possible to make changes to the Synthesizer in one score and leave other scores' settings untouched. (3) Changes to
synthesizer settings will not be heard in exported audio files unless saved to the score first (see table, above). See also
Tuning (below).
Fluid
Click on the Fluid tab to access the control panel for SF2/SF3 
SoundFont sample libraries. By default, the SoundFont
MuseScore_General.sf3 should already be loaded.
You can load, rearrange and delete soundfonts as required. Playback can be shared between any combination of different
soundfonts (and/or SFZ files). The order of soundfonts in Fluid is reflected in the 
default order of instruments in the 
mixer.
To load a soundfont
1. Click on the Add button
2. Click on a soundfont in the list.
To be able to load the soundfont, it first needs to be 
installed in your Soundfonts folder. This will ensure that it appears in
the list in step 2 (above).
To reorder the soundfonts
1. Click on a soundfont
2. Use the up/down arrows (on the right-hand side) to adjust the order.
3. Repeat with other soundfonts in the list if required.
4. Or use the double up arrow (on the top right-hand side) to move any SoundFont to the top of the list.
The order of virtual instrument sets in the Synthesizer is reflected in the order of instruments listed in the 
Mixer. So, if
playback of a score depends on a mix of instrument sets, it is advisable to save the Synthesizer configuration to the score
in question by pressing the Save to Score button. When you next wish to play back the score, press the 
Load from Score to
load the same configuration. However, remember this only sets the order of instruments—not the instruments themselves,
which should be in place on your computer.
To remove a soundfont
1. Click on the name of the soundfont
2. Click on the Delete button.
This removes the soundfont from the synthesizer but does not 
uninstall it from the Soundfonts folder: it will still be
available if you wish to reload it later.
Zerberus
Click on the Zerberus tab to access the control panel for 
SFZ sound sample libraries. You can add, delete or reorder files
in a similar way to the Fluid tab. Note that, as with Fluid, the SFZ files must first be 
installed in your soundfonts folder
before they can be loaded into the synthesizer.
137


Volume
The slider on the right of the Synthesizer controls the playback volume: any changes made here last only to the end of the
session, unless saved to the score or set as the new default.
Effects
The Master Effects tab of the Synthesizer allows you to add 
reverb and compression to your score.
Master Effects with Zita1 Reverb and SC4 Compressor.
To turn an effect on or off:
Select an option from the drop-down list next to 
Effect A or Effect B (the effects are applied in series, A → B).
To store and load effects configurations, use the buttons at the bottom of the Synthesizer window. See 
Synthesizer
settings (above) for details.
Zita 1 reverb
The Zita 1 stereo reverb module allows you to simulate the ambience of anything from a small room to a large hall. The
pre-delay, reverb time and tone of the reverb can be finely tuned using the controls provided:
Delay: Set a pre-delay for the reverb from 20-100 ms.
Low RT60 (Low frequency reverb time): Use the grey control to adjust the center frequency (50–1000 Hz) of the low
frequency band which you want to affect: the green control adjusts the reverb time (1–8 secs) of this frequency
band.
Mid RT60 (Mid-range reverb time): Adjust the reverb time (1–8 secs) of the mid-range frequency band.
HF Damping: Adjusts the high frequency component of the reverb. Increasing this value increases the frequency of
the cut-off point and makes the reverb appear brighter and longer.
EQ1: Allows you to cut or boost (-15 to +15) a frequency band (center = 40 Hz - 2 KHz) in the 
lower part of the
spectrum.
EQ2: Allows you to cut or boost (-15 to +15) a frequency band (center = 160 Hz - 10 KHz) in the 
higher part of the
spectrum.
Output: Controls the amount of effect applied. "Dry" is no effect. "Wet" indicates 100% reverb. "Mix" is a 50/50
balance of wet/dry signal.
Note: EQ1 and EQ2 affect the tone of the reverb only, 
not the dry (unprocessed) signal.
To quickly set up an effects patch, set "Output" to "Mix" and adjust the "Mid RT60" control to the desired reverb time.
Then fine tune the effect as explained above.
SC4 compressor
The SC4 stereo compressor gives you fine control over the playback's dynamic range, reducing the volume variation
between loud and soft sounds. It offers the following controls:
RMS: Adjusts the balance between RMS (0) and Peak (1) compression. In the former, the compressor responds to
averaged-out levels in the signal; in Peak mode, the compressor responds to peak levels.
Attack: (1.5–400 ms) The length of time it takes for compression to engage fully after the signal exceeds the
138


threshold level.
Release: (2–800 ms) The time it takes for compression to return to zero after the signal falls below the threshold
level.
Threshold: (in dB) The signal level above which compression starts to take effect. Lowering the threshold increases
the amount of signal that is compressed.
Ratio: The amount of compression applied to the signal above the threshold. The higher the ratio, the greater the
compression. Varies between 1:1 and 20:1.
Knee: Allows you to select a range between "soft knee" and "hard knee". The softer the knee, the more gradual the
transition between uncompressed and compressed signal.
Gain: Compression tends to lower the volume, so use this control to boost the signal as required.
To quickly set-up, try setting RMS = 1, Threshold = -20 db, Ratio = 6. Increase Gain to restore the lost volume. Then fine-
tune as explained above.
Tuning
The Tuning tab is where you can adjust the program's master tuning. For Concert Pitch instruments, A4 = 440 Hz by
default.
To change the Master tuning:
Enter a new value in the 
Master tuning field, then press Change Tuning.
Notes: (1) This tuning applies to all scores in the 
current session only. To make this the program default or to store it to a
particular score, see Save/Load Synthesizer settings. (2) To apply the new tuning to exported audio files (WAV, MP3,
OGG), press Save to Score before exporting.
Dynamics (versions 3.1 and above)
Click on the Dynamics tab to access the control panel for Single Note Dynamics:
139


Dynamics method: You can choose either between 1) Default (single-note dynamics and velocity), 2) Velocity only
(no single-note dynamics), 3) CC events only (constant velocity).
CC to use: Depending on the SoundFont you use, you may have to choose the Continuous Controller to use, 1) CC
1, 2) CC 2 (default), 3) CC 4, 4) CC 11.
In the Advanced Settings box, you can choose to enable or disable the Expression Controller for Instruments Sound:
Switch all patches: Select 1) To Expressive (to enable for all instruments sounds), 2) To Non-Expressive (to
disable for all instruments sounds), 3) Reset All (Reset all instruments sounds to defaults)

Tempo
Tempo markings can be found in the Tempo 
palette of the Basic and Advanced workspaces. They are supplied as
metronome marks, but can be subsequently edited to display any tempo or expression you want. Playback tempo can be
varied throughout the score by using multiple tempo markings, visible or invisible.
Add a tempo marking
Use any of the following methods:
Select a note or rest and press the 
keyboard shortcut Alt+Shift+T.
Select a note or rest, and from the 
menu bar choose Add→Text...→Tempo Marking.
Select a note or rest and click an appropriate metronome mark in the 
Tempo palette (double-click in versions prior to
3.4);
Drag-and-drop a metronome mark from the Tempo palette directly onto a note or rest.
Note: If a tempo marking is applied from the menu or using a keyboard shortcut, the beat note automatically follows the
time signature. The advantage of applying from a palette is that you can choose which beat note to use.
Edit tempo
To change the tempo of an existing metronome mark in the score:
1. Go into Edit mode on the tempo mark in question;
2. Edit the metronome number and/or the beat note as required;
3. Exit Edit mode.
You can also override the tempo of an existing metronome mark from the 
Inspector:
140


1. Select the tempo mark;
2. Untick "Follow text" in the 
Tempo text section of the Inspector;
3. Set the desired playback tempo in the "Tempo" field underneath.
Note: Playback may be faster or slower if the tempo setting in the 
play panel is at a percentage other than 100%.
Edit tempo text
Tempo marks can be edited and formatted just like any other text object. To set text properties or text style, see 
Text
styles and properties.
The tempo indicated by a metronome mark usually persists even if overwritten by an expression—such as Andante,
Moderato etc. You can also add further text to a plain metronome mark. e.g.
Overriding the tempo marking
You can temporarily override the indicated 
tempo, and play the score back at any tempo you like using the 
play panel:
1. Display the play panel: 
View→Play Panel or F11 (Mac: Fn+F11):
2. Move the tempo slider up or down as required. The tempo is shown both as an absolute value and as a percentage
of the currently indicated tempo mark. Double-click the tempo slider to reset it.
Note: BPM is always measured and displayed in quarter note beats per minute, regardless of the (denominator of the)
time signature in effect.
Ritardando and accelerando playback
You can simulate ritardando ("rit.") and accelerando ("accel.") playback by adding hidden tempo markings to the score.
The printed indication to the musician should be added as staff/system text in addition.
In the example illustrated below, the tempo was originally 110 BPM (beats per minute). At the ritardando, the tempo
decreases by 10 BPM on the first note of each measure. Each tempo change is made invisible by unchecking the Visible
checkbox in the Inspector, so that only the ritardando shows on the printed score:
A plugin has been developed to automate this process: 
TempoChanges
Fermatas
Fermatas, available in the 
Articulations and Ornaments palette, have a Time stretch property that can be set via the
Inspector. By default, this property is set to 1.00. To have MuseScore play back a fermata for twice its normal duration,
141


click on the fermata and set "Time stretch" to 2.00. This of course does not work for fermatas applied to barlines, as
barlines don't have a duration to stretch.

Dynamics
Dynamics are symbols indicating the relative loudness of a note or phrase of music. They can be found in the Dynamics
palette in either the Basic or Advanced 
workspace.
Additional dynamics are available in the 
Master Palette (Shift+F9).
Note: if you wish to adjust the overall playback volume of the score, use the volume slider in the 
Play Panel, or
Synthesizer.
Add a dynamic
To apply a dynamic to the score, use one of the following methods:
Select a note and click a dynamic symbol in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag a dynamic symbol from a palette onto a note.
To create a crescendo or decrescendo, see Hairpin.
Adjust properties
The default dynamic of the score is mf (mezzoforte)—set at MIDI velocity 80 (out of 127). Depending on the dynamic
governing a particular section of the score, velocity (and the resulting loudness) may be less than or greater than this.
To edit the velocity of a dynamic
Select the dynamic and, in the 
Dynamic section of the Inspector edit the Velocity value—higher for louder, lower for
softer.
To adjust the range
Note: Range = the staves in the system affected by the dynamic.
Select the dynamic, and in the 
Dynamic section of the Inspector, choose an option from "Dynamic range". The
default is "Part," which means that all staves for a particular instrument will be affected. "Staff" limits the effect to the
staff attached to the dynamic. "System" means that all staves in the system will be affected by the dynamic.
To change the placement (above or below stave)
For a single dynamic mark: select the dynamic, and type 
X to flip the placement or use the Inspector, see below.
For all dynamic marks on a stave:
1. Right-click on one dynamic, then choose Select > All Similar Elements on Same Stave
2. In the Dynamic section of the Inspector choose the required option Above or Below from "Placement"
For all dynamic marks in the score:
See above, then use the "Set as Style" button of Inspector
Customize a dynamic
142


Dynamics can be edited just like any other text object. 
Special character shortcuts can be used to add the following
symbols:
Ctrl+Shift+P (Mac: Cmd+Shift+P): Piano p.
Ctrl+Shift+F (Mac: Cmd+Shift+F): Forte f.
Ctrl+Shift+M (Mac: Cmd+Shift+M): Mezzo m.
Ctrl+Shift+R (Mac: Cmd+Shift+R): Rinforzando r.
Ctrl+Shift+S: Sforzando s.
Ctrl+Shift+N (Mac: Cmd+Shift+N): Niente n.
Ctrl+Shift+Z (Mac: Cmd+Shift+Z): Z z.
You can also edit the velocity and range etc. (see 
above). If desired, you can save the result for future use in a 
custom
palette.
Single Note Dynamics (SND)
As of version 3.1, MuseScore supports single note dynamics. In addition to 
editing the velocity, you can also edit the
velocity change in the inspector. Entering a number into this field will change the velocity of the note by approximately that
amount after the initial velocity is played. A negative number can be used to lower the volume after the initial note and a
positive number will make the note play louder after the initial volume. See links (below) for further details.

Capo playback
MuseScore allows you to transpose the playback of a staff, without affecting the music notation. This simulates the effect
of a capo
 (Wikipedia) on the instrument.
Add capo to a single staff
1. Add staff text to the note/rest from which you want capo playback to start;
2. Click on "Properties" in the "Staff Text" section of the 
Inspector, or right-click on the staff text and select Staff Text
Properties...; then click on the 
Capo Settings tab;
3. Check the "Capo Settings" checkbox, and set 
Capo fret to the fret number you wish to apply the capo at (each fret
increases the pitch by a semitone);
4. Click Ok to apply your changes;
5. Edit the wording of the text as desired.
Add capo to linked staff/tablature
Same method as above, but in step 1, add the staff text to the music staff only.
Add capo to unlinked staff/tablature
Same method as above, but apply the staff text to both staff and tablature.
Note: Capo playback will apply from the note that the staff text is attached to, until either the next staff text with "Capo
Settings" enabled, or until the end of the score.
Remove capo
To remove capo playback from a staff, returning the instrument to its normal tuning:
Add staff text with a "Capo fret" setting of "No capo".
Text
There are many different kinds of text objects in MuseScore (see tables below); text may also be found incorporated into
lines. This chapter shows you how to create, format and edit text objects, and also includes information about the
following types of text:

Text basics
Add text
To add a text-based element to the score, use one of the following general methods:
Keyboard shortcut: For example, press 
Ctrl+Tto enter Staff text , Ctrl+L to enter Lyrics, and so on.
Menu command: Add→Text allows you to choose from a range of text-based elements.
Workspace: Select a note and click an icon in one of the palettes (double-click in versions prior to 3.4); or,
alternatively, drag a symbol from a palette onto the staff. E.g. Swing text, Tempo text etc.
Notes: (1) The exact method depends on the type of text you are adding (see 
Text). (2) For general-purpose text boxes
attached to staves, see Staff and system text.
Text formatting
When a text object is created in MuseScore, it assumes the corresponding 
Text Style: all staff text, for example, has a
unique Text Style, as have tempo markings, dynamics, chord symbols etc. Each Text Style consists of a number of text
properties (font-face, font-size, font-style etc.), which can be viewed, mainly, in the Text Styles dialog
(Format→Style…→Text Styles).
A newly-created text object starts off with identical text properties to the Text Style. These can be viewed in the
Inspector:
However, these text properties are not limited to those of the default Text Style: if need be, you can edit them in the
Inspector independently of Text Style.
Finally, if you want to apply formatting to specific characters in a text object (font-face, font-size, Bold, Italic, Underline,
superscript, subscript), you can do so in text edit mode.
Adjust position of text objects
144


To position a text object, use any of the following methods:
Drag the object.
Select the object and adjust the X or Y offset values in the 
Inspector.
Select the object and apply any of the following keyboard shortcuts:
←: Move text left 0.1 
staff space.
→: Move text right 0.1 staff space.
↑: Move text up 0.1 staff space.
↓: Move text down 0.1 staff space.
Ctrl+← (Mac: Cmd+←): Move text left one staff space.
Ctrl+→ (Mac: Cmd+→): Move text right one staff space.
Ctrl+↑ (Mac: Cmd+↑): Move text up one staff space.
Ctrl+↓ (Mac: Cmd+↓): Moves text down one staff space.
Text anchors
When you apply a text element to the score, its 
anchor position will depend on the type:
Title, Subtitle, Composer, Poet: Anchored to a frame.
Fingering: Anchored to note heads.
Lyrics: Anchored to a time position.
Chord symbol: Anchored to a time position.
Staff text: Anchored to a time position.
System text: Anchored to a time position.
Sticking: Anchored to a time position.
Text editing
Text edit mode allows you to add or delete text, and apply formatting (e.g. 
bold, italic, underline etc.) to individual
characters.
Enter/exit text edit mode
To enter Text edit mode use one of the following methods:
Double-click a text object.
Click on an already selected text object.
Right-click on a text object and select Edit element.
Click on a text object and press Alt+Shift+E.
Note: Creating a new text object (see 
Text basics) also puts the program into text edit mode.
You can access the various formatting functions from the 
Text toolbar, which appears below the document window:
To exit Text edit mode use one of the following:
Press Esc.
Click on a part of the score outside the edit window.
Keyboard shortcuts
In Text edit mode, the following keyboard shortcuts are available:
Ctrl+B (Mac: Cmd+B) toggles bold face.
Ctrl+I (Mac: Cmd+I) toggles italic.
Ctrl+U (Mac: Cmd+U) toggles underline.

Border: Color of the frame border.
Highlight: Color of the background within the frame.
Thickness: Thickness of the line of the frame in space units.
Margin: Inner frame margin in space units.
Corner radius: For box frame, radius of rounded corner.
Notes: Opacity is set by the parameter "Alpha channel" in the "Select Color" dialog: a value between 0, transparent,
and 255, opaque.
Alternatively, you can edit the properties of a 
Text Style by selecting an object of the desired style in the score, adjusting
its properties in the Inspector, and clicking the 
Set as style buttons as you go. This will automatically update the 
Text
Style and all relevant text objects in the score.
Text objects
If you want to format a 
particular text object in the score differently to its 
Text Style, select it and adjust its text properties
in the Inspector:
If you have made changes to a particular text property in the Inspector, but want to revert that property to the 
Text Style
definition, press the "Reset to style default" button.

Staff and system text
Staff Text or System Text is invaluable as general purpose text. To apply to the score, use one of the following methods:
Select a note or rest; then for 
Staff text, press Ctrl+T; or for System text, press Shift+Ctrl+T.
Select a note or rest; then select the desired option from 
Add→Text.
Select a note or rest, then click the desired text from a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag the desired text from a palette onto a note or rest.
This will create an empty bounding box for 
text entry. Press Esc or click on an empty space outside the box to exit.
Apart from their indicative use, staff and system text also have optional playback properties: see below.

Staff text
Staff Text is applied to one staff (or Grand staff) in the score, and is indicative only for that staff; any playback effect
associated with the text is limited in the same way. The text will appear in the corresponding instrument part.
If you choose to hide empty staves, any staff text belonging to an empty staff will also be hidden.
Staff text properties
The regular properties of the text, such as font, size, italics etc, can be viewed and updated directly in the inspector, but
staff text can also also have properties related to playback.
Staff text can, for example, be used to apply indications such as 
Solo or Pizzicato to one staff in a score. Depending on
what the instruction of the staff text is, playback of that staff at the text location can sometimes be altered to match the
instruction. The playback properties of a staff text can be accessed in two ways:
Select the staff text, and click on "Properties" in the "Staff Text" section of the Inspector.
Right-click on the text and choose "Staff Text Properties," then click on the relevant tab.
The dialog window that opens contains tabs for the following playback properties:
Change Channel.
This property can be used to change the sound of an instrument, such as switching between open and muted sound
for a trumpet, or between arco and pizzicato for a violin. This only works for instruments which are defined to have
more than one channel. You can check this by selecting the "Change Channel" tab and click on one of the option
fields in the "Channel:" column. If there is only one option "normal", this instrument only has one channel. See Mid-

Chord symbols
Chord symbols are an abbreviated way of representing musical chords (see Chord names and symbols
 (Wikipedia) for
further details). For example:
Note: To fill measures with slashes, see 
Fill with slashes or Toggle rhythmic slash notation.
As well as conventional chord symbol notation, MuseScore as of version 3.3 also supports the 
Nashville Number System
(NNS), and Roman Numeral Analysis (RNA).
Enter a chord symbol
1. Select a start note or a slash;
2. Press Ctrl+K (Mac: Cmd+K);
3. The cursor is now positioned above the staff ready for input. Enter the chord symbol just like normal text, as follows:
Root note: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
Sharp: # (hash symbol, Alt+3 on a UK keyboard).
Flat: b (small letter "b").
Double sharp: x (small letter "x") or ## (two hash symbols).
Double flat: bb (small letter "b" twice).
Natural: natural. Note: There should be no space before the word "natural", but any chord text following it should
be separated by a space—the latter inserted using the command Ctrl+Space. Thus, to write B♮m: enter
"Bnatural", then pressCtrl+Space, then type "m". You can also use 
Ctrl+Shift+H. Note that neither of these
transpose or play back (other than the root note), or export to MusicXML properly.
For other symbols, see Chord symbol syntax (below).
4. Move the cursor forward or backwards to continue entering or editing chord symbols (see 
Keyboard commands
below);
5. Exit chord symbol mode by pressing 
Esc.
When you exit a chord symbol, the characters entered will automatically assume the correct format: by default a 
root note
typed in lower case will turn into upper case (for alternative options, see Automatic Capitalization); a "#", "b" or "natural"
will turn into a proper sharp (♯), flat (♭) or natural (♮) and so on. Do not try to use actual flat, sharp and natural signs, as
MuseScore will not understand those properly.
Keyboard commands
The following commands are available during chord symbol entry:
Space move Cursor to next note, rest, or beat
Shift+Space move cursor to previous note, rest, or beat
Ctrl+Space (Mac: Alt+Space) add a space to the chord name
; move cursor to next beat
: move cursor to previous beat
Tab move cursor to next measure
Shift+Tab move cursor to previous measure
149


Ctrl (Mac: Cmd) plus number (
1 - 9) move Cursor by duration corresponding to number (e.g.; half note for 6)
Esc exit.
Chord symbol syntax
MuseScore understands most of the abbreviations used in chord symbols:
Major: M, Ma, Maj, ma, maj, Δ (type 
t or ˆ for the triangle)
Minor: m, mi, min, -
Diminished: dim, ° (entered with lowercase letter 
o, shows as ° if using the 
Jazz style, as o otherwise)
Half-diminished: ø (type 0, zero). Alternatively, you can, of course, choose abbreviations such as mi7b5 etc.
Augmented: aug, +
The following abbreviations are also valid: 
extensions and alterations like b9 or #5, sus, alt, and no3; 
inversions and
slash chords, such as C7/E; commas; parentheses, which can enclose part, or even all, of a chord symbol.
Edit a chord symbol
An existing chord symbol can be edited in a similar way to ordinary text: See 
Text editing.
Transpose chord symbols
Chord symbols are automatically transposed by default if you apply the menu 
Transpose command to the containing
measures. If this is not required, you can untick the "Transpose chord symbols" option in the same dialog.
Chord symbol text
To adjust the appearance of 
all chord symbol text, use any of the following options:
From the main menu, choose 
Format → Style → Text Styles → Chord Symbol. Then edit the text properties as required.
Select a chord symbol and make changes in the 
Inspector, pressing the "Set as style" buttons as you go.
Chord symbol style
To access formatting options for chord symbols:
From the menu, select 
Format→Style…→Chord Symbols. Adjustable properties are listed under the following headings:
Appearance
Three options are possible: Standard and Jazz and Custom. You can select between these using the radio buttons.
In the Standard style, chords are rendered simply, with the font determined by your 
chord symbol text style.
In the Jazz style, the MuseJazz font is used for a handwritten look, with distinctive superscript and other formatting
characteristics. The Jazz style is selected by default if you use any of the Jazz templates.
The Custom style option allows you to customize the look of chord symbols (and also ensures compatibility with
older scores). Select a customized Chord symbols style file in the field below: this can be created by copying and
modifying one of the pre-existing files in the "styles" folder. Documentation can be found in the same folder. Note,
however, that this is for advanced users only, and there is no guarantee these files will be supported in the future.
Note spelling
By default, MuseScore uses letter names for chord symbols. For users in regions where other note naming schemes are
used, MuseScore provides the following controls:
Standard: A, B♭, B, C, C♯,...
German: A, B♭, H, C, C♯,...
Full German: A, B, H, C, Cis,...
150


Solfeggio: Do, Do♯, Re♭, Re,...
French: Do, Do♯, Ré♭, Ré,...
Automatic Capitalization
By default, MuseScore automatically capitalizes all note names on exit, regardless of whether you entered them in upper
or lower case. However, you can also choose other automatic capitalization options:
Lower case minor chords: c, cm, cm7,...
Lower case bass notes: C/e,...
All caps note names: DO, RE, MI,...
You can also turn off the automatic capitalization completely, in which case note names are simply rendered the way you
type them.
Positioning
Distance to fretboard diagram: If a fretboard diagram is present, this value is the height at which the chord symbol
is applied above the diagram (negative values can be used).
Minimum chord spacing: The space to leave between chord symbols.
Maximum barline distance: Changes the size of the gap between the last chord symbol in the measure and the
following barline. You only need to adjust this value if there is a continuous problem in the score with overlap
between the last symbol in one measure and the first symbol in the next.
Note: In addition to the settings described here, the default position of applied chord symbols is also determined by
settings in the Text Styles
 dialog. The effect is cumulative.
Capo
Enter the number of the capo position at which you want to display substitute chords, in brackets, after all chord symbols
in the score.
Nashville Number System
The Nashville Number System (NNS), available in MuseScore since version 3.3, is a shorthand way of representing
chords based on scale degrees rather than chord letters. This allows an accompaniment to be played in any key from the
same chord chart.
To start entering Nashville notation:
1. Select a start note;
2. From the menu, select 
Add→Text→Nashville Number.
Just as with standard chord symbols, you can type Nashville notation normally and MuseScore will do its best to recognize
and format the symbols appropriately. The same shortcuts used for navigation when entering standard chord symbols
(e.g. Space, see above) are available for Nashville notation as well.
Roman Numeral Analysis
As of MuseScore 3.3, the Roman Numeral Analysis system is supported—a type of musical analysis where chords are
represented by upper and lower case Roman numerals (I, ii, III, iv etc.), superscripts, subscripts and other modifying
symbols. It is used to notate and analyze the harmony of a composition independent of its key (see External links for
further details).
Note: Unlike standard chord symbols and Nashville notation, which MuseScore formats using its own algorithms, RNA
uses the free and open source Campania font
 to format the symbols. This allows MuseScore to format the symbols as
you type, rather than applying the formatting only when you are done. Also, if you install the Campania font on your
system normally, you can use it in other programs as well and benefit from the same formatting.
Enter RNA
1. Select a start note;
2. From the menu, select 
Add→Text→Roman Numeral Analysis. Alternatively, set up a keyboard shortcut to do the same
thing in Preferences;
3. Input the RNA symbols for the chord just like normal text, as follows;
151


Major chord: Upper case roman numerals
Minor chord: Lower case roman numerals
Diminished chord: o (lower case)
Half-diminished chord: 0 (zero)
Augmented chord: +
Chord inversions: Enter up to 3 single-digit numbers, top note first
Accidentals: # (sharp), b (flat)
For other symbols, see the images below, "
Examples of RNA".
4. Move the cursor forward or backwards to continue entering or editing symbols for other chords;
5. When RNA is completed, exit by pressing 
Esc, or by clicking on a blank section of the score.
Just as with standard chord symbols, you can type Roman numeral analysis normally and MuseScore will do its best to
recognize and format the symbols appropriately. The same shortcuts used for navigation when entering standard chord
symbols are available for Roman numeral analysis as well (see Keyboard commands (above)).

Fingering
Fingering symbols for various instruments are found in the Fingering 
palette in the Advanced workspace.
Keyboard music employs the numbers 1–5 to represent fingers of the left or right hand.
Guitar music uses the numbers 0–4 to represent left-hand fingering (T is occasionally used for the thumb). Right-
hand fingering is indicated by the letters p, i, m, a, c. Circled numbers represent instrument strings.
The last five symbols in the palette are used for 
lute fingering in historical music.

Rehearsal marks
Rehearsal marks can be used in a number of ways:
To identify specific points in a score to facilitate rehearsing.
As bookmarks in the score to which you can instantly navigate—using the 
Find/Search command.
To mark the various sections in the score.
Typically, rehearsal marks consist of one or more letters and/or numbers, and appear in sequence in the score—e.g. A,
B, C…, or 1, 2, 3… etc. Alternatively, they may display measure numbers (usually larger than standard measure
numbers, boldface and/or enclosed in boxes). Multimeasure rests are automatically broken before and after rehearsal
marks.
Rehearsal marks can be added to the score (i) 
automatically—which ensures that they are named in sequence—or (ii)
manually, allowing you to name them as you wish.
Add a rehearsal mark
Manual Placement
To create a rehearsal mark manually:
1. Click on a note (or rest) at the desired location;
2. Select one of the following options:
Press Ctrl+M (Mac: Cmd+M);
From the menu, choose 
Add → Text → Rehearsal Mark;
3. Enter the desired text.
Automatic placement
Add an alphanumeric rehearsal mark
Use either of the following options:
Click on a note (or rest) at the desired location, then click the [B1] rehearsal mark icon in the "Text" 
palette (double-
click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag and drop the rehearsal mark from the "Text" palette onto the score.
Notes: (1) By default, marks are added in the sequence, A, B, C etc. (2) To change the format of subsequently-added
156


marks (to lower case letters, or numbers), edit the previous rehearsal mark accordingly. (3) Marks added between existing
rehearsal marks append a number or letter to the previous mark: it is a good idea to apply the Resequence command
afterwards (see below).
Add a measure-number rehearsal mark
1. Add the first rehearsal mark in the series as an alphabetical one; then 
edit it to read the 
same as the number of the
measure it is attached to;
2. Add subsequent marks as shown above. They will automatically adopt the measure-number format.
Automatically resequence rehearsal marks
MuseScore allows the user to automatically re-order a series of rehearsal marks if they have got out of sequence for any
reason. Use the following method:
1. Before making a selection, you can, if desired, establish a new format for the rehearsal marks (lower/upper case,
number, or measure number) by manually altering the first mark in the range accordingly.
2. Select the range of measures you wish to apply the 
Resequence command to (if there is no selection then the
program assumes you wish to resequence all measures).
3. From the menu, select 
Tools → Resequence Rehearsal Marks.
MuseScore automatically detects the sequence based on the 
first rehearsal mark in the selection—all rehearsal marks in
the selection are then altered accordingly. The following sequences are possible:
A, B, C etc.
a, b, c etc.
Numerical: 1, 2, 3 etc.
Numerical: according to measure numbers. This requires the number of the first mark in the series to be equal to the
number of the measure it is attached to.
Text style
Rehearsal marks are a variety of 
system text, appearing both on the score and on every 
part. By default, they are in a
large bold font, and enclosed in frames. All aspects of their appearance can be changed globally via the rehearsal mark
Text style.

Measure
To open the Measure dialog, select Format→Style...→Measure.
This allows you to adjust the distance between various items within measures.
Introduction
If you change a measure style property, MuseScore automatically adjusts the score to maintain the correct spacing
between notes and rests according to best music engraving practice. It will also correctly reposition any elements
attached to notes or rests, such as fingerings, dynamics, lines etc.
All settings related to measure width and note spacing are 
minimum values. Measures are automatically stretched, if
necessary, to maintain existing page margins.
All the properties listed below use the 
staff space (abbreviated to "sp") as the basic unit of measurement. See 
Page
settings: Scaling for more details.
Options
Minimum measure width: Sets the minimum horizontal length of measures. In measures containing very little
content (e.g., a single whole note or whole measure rest), the measure will only shrink as far as this minimum.
Spacing (1=tight): Condenses or expands the space 
after notes or rests. This setting thus affects not only space
between notes but also between the last note and the ending barline. For the space between the beginning of the
measure and the first note or rest, see Note left margin (below).
Note left margin: Sets the distance from the start barline to the first note.
Barline to grace note distance: Sets the distance between a barline and a grace note that occurs before the first
actual note in a measure (independently of the "Note left margin" setting).
166


Barline to accidental distance: Sets the distance between a barline and an accidental placed before the first note
in a measure (independently of the "Note left margin" setting).
Note to barline distance: Sets the distance from the last note to the following barline.
Minimum note distance: Specifies the smallest amount of space MuseScore will allow after each note (depending
on other factors, more space may be allowed).
Clef left margin: Sets the distance between the very beginning of each line and the clef. (This option is rarely
needed.)
Key signature left margin: Sets the distance between the beginning of the measure and a key signature.
Time signature left margin: Sets the distance between the beginning of the measure and a time signature (if there
is no key signature in between).
Time signature to barline distance: To be added
Clef/key right margin: Sets the distance between a mid-staff clef or key signature and the following note or rest.
Clef to barline distance: Sets the distance between a barline and a clef change preceding it.
Clef to key distance: Sets the distance from the clef to a key signature following it.
Clef to time signature distance: Sets the distance from the clef to the time signature following it (if there is no key
signature in between).
Key to time signature distance: Sets the distance from a key signature to the following time signature.
Key to barline distance: To be added..
System header distance: Sets the distance from a clef or key signature at the beginning of a system to the first
note or rest.
System header with time signature distance: Sets the distance from a time signature at the beginning of a system
to the first note or rest.
Multimeasure rest margin: Sets the distance between a multimeasure rest and the barlines on either side.
Staff line thickness: Sets the thickness of the lines of the staff, which allows you to make the staff thicker and
darker, if you need greater visibility on your printouts.
Note: Changes to an individual measure's 
Stretch (using Format→Stretch → Increase/Decrease Layout Stretch) are
calculated after, and proportional to, the global Spacing setting.
Page settings
Page settings allows you to adjust the 
overall dimensions of your score such as 
page size, page margins, and scaling. It
is one of the main layout tools in MuseScore—along with the options available from Format→Style…
To open the Page settings dialog: from the menu, select 
Format → Page Settings....
167


Page size
Here you can select the paper format, either by standard name (e.g., Letter or A4), or by specifying the height and width in
either mm or inches (use the radio buttons to choose which unit of measurement to use). The initial default page size
depends on your localization—in the United States, Letter size paper is standard.
You can also choose to format your music in 
Landscape or Portrait orientation using the radio buttons. You can
optionally use Two sided layout (i.e., book format, with mirror left and right margins for even and odd pages—see 
below).
Odd/Even Page Margins
The Even Page Margins and Odd Page Margins settings allow you to define the printable area of your pages. Aside
from changing the margins around the music on the page, other settings, such as the positions of headers and footers,
are calculated relative to the margins defined here.
If the "Two sided" checkbox under "Page Size" is selected, you can set margins differently for mirroring odd and even
pages. Otherwise, only one set of margins can be modified, but will apply to all pages.
To display page margins in your score on screen (though not in print), go to 
View→Show Page Margins.
Scaling
The Scaling property allows you to increase or decrease the size of your score.
In MuseScore, the sizes of score elements, such as note heads, note stems, accidentals, clefs etc., are defined in terms
of a unit of measurement called a staff space—abbreviated to sp. (see Glossary) . As you change the "Staff space"
setting, all score elements follow suit and thus correct proportions are maintained. The exception is 
Text in which you can
set an absolute value, independent of "Scaling."
Note: Changing the "Scaling" does not always change the number of systems per page, because system distance can
vary between limits set under "Min system distance" and "Max system distance" (see Format→Style...→Page).
Unit
Here you can choose to display the values in Inches or millimeters.
First page number
Sets the number of the first page of the particular score. Page numbers below 1 won't get printed—e.g., setting the first
page number to -1 would result in the first and second page showing no page number, and page number 1 appearing on
the third page.
Apply to all Parts
168


The Apply to all Parts button is available when modifying a 
part, rather than the main score (see 
Part extraction). If you
change the page settings of one part and want the rest of the parts to have the same settings, this button will apply the
change to all parts in one go.
Breaks and spacers
The Breaks & Spacers palette contains the following non-printing symbols:
The first three symbols are called breaks; the vertical lines are known as 
spacers.
Breaks
A break can be applied to either a measure 
or a frame. There are three types:
System break: Forces the next part of the score to start in a new 
system.
Page break: Forces the next part of the score to start on a new page.
Section break: Forces the next part of the score to start in a new system and starts a new 
section (see below). It
can be combined with a page break if required.
Notes: (1) Break symbols are visible on the screen, but do not appear on printouts. (2) To add (or remove) system breaks
over all or part of the score, see Add/Remove System breaks. (3) To split a measure, see 
Measure operations: Split and
join.
Add a break to a measure
Breaks can be added using either (1) a 
keyboard shortcut; or (2) a break symbol from a palette.
Using a keyboard shortcut
To add a System break or a Page break only:
1. Select any one of the following:
Barline;
Measure;
Notehead;
Text element associated with a staff (e.g. lyric syllable, chord symbol, staff text etc.);
Range of measures (if you choose this option, a break will be applied before and after the selection);
2. Choose one of the following options:
System break: Press↵ (toggle).
Page break: Press Ctrl+↵ (Mac: Cmd+↵) (toggle).
Using a palette break symbol
Any break can be added from a workspace 
palette:
1. Select any one of the following:
Barline;
Measure;
Notehead;
Text element associated with a staff (e.g. lyric syllable, chord symbol, staff text etc.);
Range of measures (if you choose this option, a break will be applied before and after the selection);
2. Click a break symbol in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4). Repeat to toggle off.
Alternatively, drag any break symbol from a palette onto a measure.
Add a break to a frame
To add a break to a frame, use one of the following options:
Drag a break from a palette onto a frame.
Select a frame then click a palette break symbol (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Delete breaks
Use one of the following options:
Select one or more breaks and press 
Del.
169


See also: Add / Remove System breaks
.
Move a break
Although breaks are not visible on printed output, you can reposition one, if required, by entering 
edit mode on it and using
the keyboard arrow buttons (see Adjust position of text objects).
Section break
A Section break, as the name suggests, is used to create separate sections within a score. Like a 
system break, it forces
the next measure or frame to begin a new system, and can also be used in association with a page break if required. A
section break could be used, for example, to divide a piece into separate movements.
Each section can have its own measure numbering independent of the rest of the score. By default, the first measure of a
section is numbered "1" (see image below), though like the first measure of the score itself, the number is not displayed
unless configured in the measure properties dialog. The same dialog can be used to change the numbering according to
your preference.
If you change Time signature or Key signature at the beginning of the new section, there will be no courtesy signature at
the end of the previous section. See example below:
When you play back the score, the program adds a short pause between each section. In addition, the first 
end repeat
barline in a section always sends the playback cursor to the beginning of the section, so a 
start repeat barline is optional.
The following properties can be adjusted in the 
Inspector after selecting the section break:
Pause: Length of pause, in seconds, at end of the section.
Start new section with long instrument names (checkbox).
Start new section with measure number one
 (checkbox).
Start new section with first system indentation
 (checkbox, as of 3.6).
Prior to version 3.4, the same properties are accessed by right-clicking the break and selecting 
Section Break Properties.
Spacers
There are three types of spacers:
Staff spacer up: An up-pointing arrow. For adding space 
above a staff.
Staff spacer down: A down-pointing arrow. For adding space 
below a staff.
Staff spacer fixed down: Looks like a capital letter "I." For fixing the distance between two staves (useful to
override style or autoplace settings in one spot only). Negative values are possible.
Note: Spacers cannot be applied to a frame.
Add a spacer
Use either of the following options:
Select a measure, then click a 
palette spacer symbol (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag a spacer symbol from a palette onto a measure.
Spacer symbols are visible on the screen, but do not appear on printouts.
Note: Spacers are designed for local adjustments only. If you wish to adjust the space between staves across the 
whole
score, use the settings in Format → Style... → Page instead.
Adjust a spacer
To adjust the height of a spacer, choose one of these options:
Click the spacer and drag the blue end-handle up and down (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Click the spacer and use the 
↑↓ keys and/or Ctrl+↑↓ to move the end-handle up and down (double-click in versions
prior to 3.4).
170


Click on the spacer and adjust the height property in the 
Inspector.
Delete a spacer
Click on the spacer and press the 
Del key.

Frames
A Frame is a rectangular container for empty space, text or pictures in the score. It can be one of three types:
Horizontal: Used to create a break in a particular system. Can contain one or more text objects and/or images.
Vertical: Inserted above a system or appended to the last system. Can contain one or more text objects and/or
images.
Text: Inserted above a system or appended to the last system. Can contain one text object only.
Horizontal frame
A horizontal frame is used to create a break in a system. For example, you can:
Create a coda, with an adjustable gap separating it from the rest of the score (as in the example below).
Create an offset at the beginning of the score, where there is no staff name to perform the same function.
Create an adjustable right margin at the end of a system.
Create space for some text or image(s).
Create a space between a 'historical incipit' and the beginning of the modern edition.
Insert/append horizontal frame
See Create a Frame (below).
Adjust width of horizontal frame
Use one of the following methods:
Click (double-click prior to version 3.4) the frame and drag the handle to the right or left.
Select the frame and adjust "Width" in the 
Inspector.
Add text or image to horizontal frame
To add text: Right-click on the frame and select 
Add → Text.
To add an image: Right-click on the frame and select 
Add → Picture.
Vertical frame
A vertical frame can be inserted above a system or appended to the last system. It can contain one or more text objects
and/or images. The height is adjustable and the width equals the system width.
It can be used, for example, to:
Create an area at the head of a score for Title/Subtitle/Composer/Lyricist text etc. (see 
below).
Create a title page (see below).
Add single- or multi-column lyric text (at the end of a score).
Create subtitles and other annotations between systems.
Insert/append vertical frame
See Create a Frame (below).
171


Adjust height of vertical frame
Use one of the following methods:
Click (double-click prior to version 3.4) the frame and drag the handle up or down.
Select the frame and adjust "Height" in the 
Inspector.
Edit vertical frame properties
Selecting the frame allows you to adjust various parameters in the Inspector:
Top Gap: Adjusts distance between frame and element above.
Bottom Gap: Adjusts distance between frame and element below.
Height: Adjusts height of the frame.
Left Margin: Moves left-aligned text objects to the right.
Right Margin: Moves right-aligned text objects to the left.
Top margin: Moves top-aligned text objects downwards (see also 
Format → Style... → Page).
Bottom Margin: Moves bottom-aligned text objects upwards (see also

To add text: Right-click on the frame, select 
Add, and choose one of the text options.
To add an image: Right-click on the frame and select 
Add → Picture.
You can create as many objects as you like within a frame. Their positions can be adjusted independently by dragging or,
more accurately, by altering the offset values in the Inspector. To format text objects, see Text editing and Text styles and
properties.
Insert horizontal frame in vertical frame
Right-click on the frame and select Add → Insert Horizontal Frame.
The horizontal frame is automatically left-aligned and fills the entire vertical frame. To 
right-align it:
1. Reduce the width of the horizontal frame.
2. Deselect the frame then drag it to the right. To restore left-alignment, drag the frame to the left.
"Title" frame
A vertical frame is automatically created at the beginning of a score, showing the title, subtitle, composer, lyricist etc.,
when you fill in the information fields provided on page 1 of the New Score Wizard.
If the score does not have a vertical frame at the beginning, you can create one as follows:
1. From the menu, select 
Add → Text → Title/Subtitle/Composer/Lyricist;
2. Type the desired text;
3. Press Esc, or click on an empty space, to exit.
Text frame
A Text frame looks like a vertical frame, but is specialized for text input: 
one text object is allowed per frame. The height
automatically expands to fit the content and there is no height adjustment handle.
A text frame can be used, for example, to:
Create lyric text at the end of a score.

Once it has been imported into a score, an image (just like other score elements) can be 
added to a palette if required.
Cut/copy and paste image
1. Click on an image in the score.
2. Apply any of the standard copy/cut 
commands.
3. Click on a note, rest or frame.
4. Apply any of the standard paste 
commands.
Modify image
To modify the width/height of an image, double-click it and drag any of the handles. If you want to adjust width or height
separately, untick "Lock aspect ratio" first in the Inspector.
You can adjust the position of an image by simply dragging it.

Accessibility
Introduction
This document is written for blind and visually impaired users of MuseScore 3. It is not intended to provide a full
description of all of the features of MuseScore; you should read this in conjunction with the regular MuseScore
documentation.
MuseScore comes with support for the free and open source 
NVDA screen reader
 for Windows. You can also 
install a
script
 to enable support for 
JAWS
, or install a script
 for Orca
 on Linux.
Eventually we hope to support other screen readers such as 
VoiceOver
 and Narrator
. Currently, unsupported screen
readers will usually read menus and dialogs, but reading the score note by note currently requires one of the supported
screen readers.
Beginning with MuseScore 3.3, most of the features of MuseScore are fully accessible, it is viable both as a score reader
and editor. Previous versions were more limited with respect to editing.
Initial setup
When you run MuseScore for the first time, you will be asked some questions on startup. We recommend you accept the
defaults, but answer "no" to the question about showing tours, since these unfortunately are not yet accessible.
When MuseScore starts, the first thing you normally see is the 
Start Center window. This shows you a list of recent scores
that you can access via Shift+Tab and then using the left and right cursor keys. You may find it easier to open scores
directly from the File menu, however so you can press Esc to close the Start Center if you prefer. In fact you may want to
permanently disable it. After closing the Start Center, open the Edit menu (Alt+E), choose Preferences, and in the General
tab, uncheck Show Start Center, then close the Preferences window.
MuseScore includes keyboard shortcuts for many of its commands, and others that do not have shortcuts defined by
default can be customized later, in Edit, Preferences, Shortcuts.
Finding your way around
The user interface in MuseScore works much like other notation programs or other document-oriented programs in
general. It has a single main document window within which you can work with a score. MuseScore supports multiple
document tabs within this window. It also supports a split-screen view to let you work with two documents at once, and you
can have multiple tabs in each window.
In addition to the score window, MuseScore has a menu bar that you can access via the shortcuts for the individual
menus:
File: Alt+F
Edit: Alt+E
View: Alt+V
Add: Alt+A
Format: Alt+O
Tools: Alt+T
Plugins: Alt+P
Help: Alt+H
Hint: once you have opened a menu, it may take several presses of the 
Up or Down keys before everything is read
properly. Also, if at any point the screenreader stops responding, a useful trick to kickstart it again is to press Alt to move
focus to the menu bar, then Esc to return to the score. Sometimes switching to another application then back can help as
well.
In addition to the menu bar, there are also a number of toolbars, palettes, and sub-windows within MuseScore, and you
can cycle through the controls in these using Tab (or Shift+Tab to move backwards through this same cycle). When you first
start MuseScore, or load a score, focus should be in the main score window.
If nothing is selected (press Esc to clear any selection), pressing Tab takes you to a toolbar containing a series of buttons
for operations like New, Open, Play, and so forth. Tab will skip any buttons that aren't currently active. The names and
shortcuts (where applicable) for these buttons should be read by your screen reader.
176


Once you have cycled through the buttons on the toolbar, the next window Tab will visit is the Palettes. This is used to
add various elements to a score (dynamics, articulations, and so forth).
If an element is selected in the score, the first window visited by Tab is the Inspector, which is used for making various
manual adjustments in your score. Many of these features are based on the visual appearance of the score (although a
few relate to playback).
If you have opened one of the additional optional windows, such as the Selection Filter, the Tab key will also visit these.
You can close windows you do not need by going to the View menu and making sure none of the first set of checkboxes
is selected (the windows that appear before the Zoom settings). By default, only the Palettes and Inspector should be
selected. See Initial Setup for instructions for disabling the Start Center. 
F9 can be used to toggle the Palettes while 
F8 will
toggle the Inspector.
To return focus to the score window after visiting the toolbar, or a subwindow, press Esc. If something was selected
before visiting the other window, the selection is left intact, but pressing Esc once focus is in the score window clears the
selection. The selection is automatically restored when you commence navigation using the accessibility commands
described below.
The score window
When you first start MuseScore 3 an empty example score is loaded by default. If you wish to experiment with editing
features, this would be a good place to begin. Otherwise, you will probably want to start by loading a score. MuseScore
uses the standard shortcuts to access system commands like Ctrl+O (Mac: Cmd+O) to open a file, 
Ctrl+S (Mac: Cmd+S) to
save, Ctrl+W (Mac: Cmd+W) to close, etc.
If you press Ctrl+O (Mac: Cmd+O) to load a score, you are presented with a fairly standard file dialog. MuseScore can open
scores in its own format (MSCZ or MSCX) as well as import scores in the standard MusicXML format, in MIDI format, or
from a few other programs such as Guitar Pro, Capella, and Band-in-a-Box. Once you have loaded a score, it is displayed
in a new tab within the score window. You can move between the tabs in the score window using Ctrl+Tab (does not apply
for Mac). Hint: if the name of the score in the current tab is not read, ask your screen reader to read the title bar.
To read the score note by note, see below, but there are a few other interesting things you can do with a loaded score.
You can press Space to have MuseScore play the score for you. You can use File / Export to convert to another format,
including PDF, PNG, WAV, MP3, MIDI, MusicXML, etc. And of course, you can print it via File / Print or Ctrl+P (Mac:
Cmd+P).
If a score contains multiple instruments, it may already have linked parts generated. Linked parts are presented as part
tabs within score tabs, but currently, there is no way to navigate these part tabs using the keyboard. The parts would not
normally contain information different from the score; they would just be displayed differently (each part on its own page).
If a score does not already have parts generated, you can do so through File / Parts, and that dialog is accessible. If you
wish to print the parts, you can work around the inability of accessing part tabs individually by using the File / Export Parts
dialog, which automatically exports PDF’s (or other formats) for all parts in one step.
Score reading
When you first load a score, the score window has the keyboard focus, but there will be nothing selected. The first step to
reading a score is to select something, and the most natural place to begin is with the first element of the score. After a
score is loaded, Alt+Right (Mac: Alt+Right) will select the literal first element, which is likely the title; 
Ctrl+Home (Mac:
Cmd+Home) will select the first "musical" element (usually a clef or an initial barline).
As you navigate between elements, your screen reader should give the name of the selected element. You will hear it
read the name of the element (for example, “Treble clef”) and also give position information (for example, “Measure 1;
Beat 1; Staff 1; Violin”). The amount of information read is optimized to not repeat information that has not changed.
Pressing Shift currently interrupts the reading, which might also be useful.
Most navigation in MuseScore is centered around notes and rests only—it will skip clefs, key signatures, time signatures,
barlines, and other elements. So if you just use the standard Right and Left keys to move through your score, you will only
hear about notes and rests (and the elements attached to them). However, there are two special accessibility commands
that you will find useful to gain a more complete summarization of the score:
Next element: Alt+Right (Mac: Alt+Right)
Previous element: Alt+Left (Mac: Alt+Left
These commands include clefs and other elements that the other navigation commands skip, and also navigate through
all voices within the current staff, whereas other navigation commands such as Right and Left only navigate through the
currently selected voice until you explicitly change voices. For instance, if you are on a quarter note on beat 1 of measure
1, and there are two voices in that measure, then pressing Right will move on to the next note of voice 1—which will be on
beat 2—whereas pressing Alt+Right (Mac: Alt+Right) will stay on beat 1 but move to the note on voice 2. Only once you have
moved through all notes on the current beat on the current staff will the shortcut move you on to the next beat. The intent
is that this shortcut should be useful for navigating through a score if you don’t already know what the contents are.
When you navigate to an element, your screen reader should read information about it. For notes and rests, it will also
read information about elements attached to them, such as lyrics, articulations, chord symbols, etc. The accessibility
177


commands will also navigate through those elements individually.
One important note: Up and Down by themselves, with 
Shift, or with 
Ctrl / Cmd are not useful shortcuts for navigation! Instead,
they change the pitch of the currently selected note or notes. Be careful not to inadvertently edit a score you are trying to
read. Up and Down should only be used with Alt if your intent is navigation only. See the list of navigation shortcuts below.
If you should lose track of your place in the score - or if you lose the selection completely - press 
Shift+L ("location") to get
the current location.
Moving forwards or backwards in time
The following shortcuts are useful for moving “horizontally” through a score:
Next element: Alt+Right
Previous element: Alt+Left
Next chord or rest: Right
Previous chord or rest: 
Left
Next measure: Ctrl+Right
Previous measure: Ctrl+Left
Go to measure: Ctrl+F
First element: Ctrl+Home
Last element: Ctrl+End
Moving between notes at a given point in time
The following shortcuts are useful for moving “vertically” through a score:
Next element: Alt+Right
Previous element: Alt+Left
Next higher note in voice, previous voice, or staff above: 
Alt+Up
Next lower note in voice, next voice, or staff below: 
Alt+Down
Top note in chord: 
Ctrl+Alt+Up
Bottom note in chord: 
Ctrl+Alt+Down
The Alt+Up and Alt+Down commands are similar to the 
Alt+Right and Alt+Left commands in that they are designed to help you
discover the content of a score. You do not need to know how many notes are in a chord, how many voices are in a staff,
or how many staves are in a score in order to move vertically through the score using these commands.
Filtering score reading
Excluding certain elements like lyrics, or chord names while reading the score is possible by using the Selection filter (
F6).
Uncheck those elements you don't want to read. However, this feature may not currently be implemented.
Score playback
The Space bar serves both to start and stop playback. Playback will start with the currently selected note if one is selected;
where playback was last stopped if no note is selected; or at the beginning of the score on first playback.
MuseScore supports looped playback so you can repeat a section of a piece for practice purposes. To set the “in” and
“out” points for the loop playback via the Play Panel (F11):
1. First select the note in the score window where the loop should start;
2. Go to the Play Panel and press the Set loop In position toggle button;
3. Back to the score window, navigate to the note where you want the loop to end;
4. Switch again to Play Panel, and press the Set loop Out position toggle button;
5. To enable or disable the loop, press the Loop Playback toggle button.
You can also control the loop playback and control other playback parameters, such as overriding the basic tempo of a
score, using the View / Play Panel (F11).
Score creation and editing
While some advanced score editing techniques require visual inspection of the score, and a small number of commands
may require the mouse, as of MuseScore 3.3 most score editing features are fully accessible.
You can enter music into the default empty score (a score with one staff, using a piano sound), or edit an existing score
that you have opened already, or you can create a new score with the set of instruments you want.
Creating a new score
To create a new score, use File, New or 
Ctrl+N. A wizard then walks you through the score creation process.
178


The first screen of the wizard has fields to enter the title, composer, and other information. The second allows you to
select a template (predefined scores for common ensembles like choral SATB or jazz big band) or to select instruments.
The third allows you to select an initial key signature and tempo. Sometimes this screen gets skipped, so if this happens,
press the Back button to go back. To select a key, use Up and Down. The key signature control does not work well with
some screenreaders, but if you give the "read current line" command (e.g., NVDA+L), it may read the currently-selected
key. The next and final screen of the wizard allows you to select an initial time signature, pickup (anacrusis), and the
number of measures to start with.
Once you have a score, you can begin editing it.
Note input
To enter notes, you need to be in note input mode. First, navigate to the measure in which you would like to enter notes,
then press N. Almost everything about note input is designed to be keyboard accessible, and the standard documentation
should be good to help you through the process. Bear in mind that MuseScore can either be in note input or normal mode,
and it won’t always be clear which mode of these you are in. When in doubt, press Esc. If you were in note input mode,
this will take you out. If you were in normal mode, you will stay there, although you will also lose your selection.
The basic process of note input is to first select a duration (for example, using shortcuts 4-5-6 for eighth, quarter, half),
then enter a note by typing its letter name. Once a duration is selected you can enter multiple notes of the same duration.
Press 0 to enter a rest.
The Up and Down keys raise or lower the pitch by a half step, adding or removing accidentals as necessary. To change
enharmonic spelling of a note, press J.
To enter a tie, select the duration of the tied note then press 
+. To create triplets, select the total duration for the triplet,
then press Ctrl+3 (similarly for quadruplets and other tuplets). To enter music in multiple voices on a single staff, pressing
Ctrl+Alt plus a number from 1 to 4 will switch to that voice (keep in mind, the first voice for each staff is always voice 1).
There is much more to note input in MuseScore. See for the 
section on Note Input in the Handbook
.
Selection
MuseScore supports the usual keyboard shortcuts for selection. Navigating is the same as selecting for single elements.
To select a range of elements, navigate to the first, press and hold Shift, then navigate to the second. Ctrl+A will select the
entire score.
Palettes
As mentioned previously, many symbols other than notes are entered from the palettes window. The basic use model is,
first select the element or elements in the score you want to apply the palette item to, then apply the palette element.
There are a few different ways to select the palette element.
The simplest method to use at first is to simply browse the palettes window by keyboard. To reach the palettes window,
press Shift+Tab. The screenreader may not specifically tell you that you are in the palettes window, but you will discover
that you are as you navigate. Depending on whether you have used the palettes before, focus may be where you left off,
or at the top. Press Tab a few times to get to the first palette within the window (Clefs). You can browse the list of palettes
using the Up and Down cursor keys. The Right cursor key opens a palette, and then all four cursor keys can be used to
navigate through the elements (they are arranged in a table). You can also use Tab to navigate the palette names and
contents.
Once you have found a palette item you want to apply, press Enter to apply it to the currently-selected score elements and
return focus to the score. The next time you press Shift+Tab to return to the palettes, the last-used palette item will still be
selected, so Enter will apply it again. The screenreader may stop responding after applying a palette item, even though
focus has returned to the score, but the trick of pressing Alt followed by Esc should get it working again.
You can also use the palette search facility to quickly find a palette item. The search box is one of the first elements at the
top of the palette, so you can navigate to it, or you can define a shortcut (Edit, Preferences, Shortcuts) for the "Palette
search" command, which will subsequently take you directly to the search box. Once you are in the box, type the first few
characters of a search term, and only palette items matching that search will shown. You can then navigate to the search
results and find the element you want. The Down cursor will take you directly to the first search result, then you can use
Right after that. However, on some systems MuseScore may crash when using the palette search function with a screen
reader enabled.
Another way to reach the palettes window is with the 
F9 shortcut, which toggles the palettes window on and off. By default,
the palettes window is open, so pressing F9 will close it, but then pressing it again opens the window and puts the cursor
in the search box.
There is one other useful technique for palette accessibility, and that is the "Apply current palette element" command (for
which you can define a shortcut). If you are in the score, this will apply the last-used palette element automatically (the
equivalent of Shift+Tab followed by Enter).
179


Menus and Shortcuts
Some elements can be added or edited via menu commands or keyboard shortcuts. The Edit menu has standard copy
and paste commands (and the usual shortcuts work too). The Add menu has commands to add notes, tuplets, measures,
frames, text, and some lines. The Format menu has commands relating mostly to the visual appearance of the score
(e.g., page and staff size, position and size of symbols, fonts used for text), which can be extremely useful in producing
large print a.k.a. "modified stave notation" scores (see below). The Tools menu has a number of other useful commands,
including ones to remove measures or other selected ranges, to transpose a selection, to join and split measures, and
more. any of these commands have shortcuts defined by default that should be read by a screenreader. You can define
custom shortcuts for most of the rest in Edit, Preferences, Shortcuts.
There are also shortcuts for a number of palette items, and the possibility to define others (although many palette items
currently do not support this). Some useful shortcuts to remember include:
Ctrl+T: staff text
Alt+Shift+T: tempo
Ctrl+L: lyrics
Ctrl+K: chord symbol
Ctrl+M: rehearsal mark
S: slur
Shift+S: staccato
Shift+V: accent
Shift+N: tenuto
Shift+O: marcato
slash: grace note
less than: crescendo
greater than: diminuendo
Customization
You can customize the keyboard shortcuts by opening the Edit menu, selecting Preferences, then navigating to the
Shortcuts tab. Once there, Tab will take you to the list of shortcuts, and you can navigate the list directly with the Up and
Down cursor keys, but it is a very long list. You can instead hit Tab a few more times to reach the Search box, then type
the first few characters of the command to filter the list, then navigate back to the list.
Once you have found the command you wish to customize, press Enter. You can then press the key combination you
wish to be the shortcut. It can be a single key, a key with Shift, Ctrl, and/or other modifiers, or even a sequence or two or
more keys pressed in succession. After entering the shortcut you wish, press Tab to get to the Add or Replace button
(Tab is the only key that won't be interpreted as part of a shortcut sequence). If you reach Cancel without ever seeing Add
or Replace, it means the shortcut you choose conflicts with another. Navigate back to the where you typed the shortcut
and it will tell you the name of the command it conflicts with. Hit Tab to get to the Clear button to clear it, then try again
with a different shortcut.
At some point, we may provide a set of special accessibility-optimized shortcuts. There is already a facility in the shortcut
dialog to save and load shortcut definitions, so it is possible to share shortcut definitions with other users.

Albums
The Album feature has been disabled for 3.x. It will come back in 4.0.
The Album Manager allows you to prepare a list of multiple scores and save the list as an album file ("*.album"), print all
the scores as one long print job with consistent page numbers, or even join the scores into a single new MSCZ score.
This is ideal for preparing an exercise book or combining multiple movements of an orchestration.
To open the Album Manager, go to 
File → Album...
180


Create album
1. To create a new album, click the 
New button. Fill in a title in the "Album Name:" box at the top.
2. To add scores to the album, click 
Add Score. A file selection dialog will appear and let you choose one or multiple
scores from your file system. Click OK.
3. The scores you add will appear in a list in the Album Manager. You can rearrange their order by selecting a score
and clicking the Up or Down button.
Load album
If you have previously created an album, you can open it through the Album Manager by clicking the 
Load button. A file
selection dialog will appear to let you load the .album file from your file system.
Print album
To print an album as if it were a single document, click 
Print Album. The scores loaded into the Album Manager are printed
in the order they are listed in with the correct page numbers, ignoring the page number offset values in Layout → Page
Settings... → First page number for all but the first score. As the album is printed in one print job, double-sided printing (duplex
printing) also works as expected.
Join scores
To combine multiple scores into a single .mscz file, click 
Join Scores. The scores are combined in the selected order into
one single score. If not already present, line- and section breaks are added to the last measure or 
frame of each score in
the combined file.
All style settings are taken from the first score, different style settings from subsequent score are ignored.
All the scores should have the same number of parts and staves for this to work correctly, ideally with the same
instruments in the same order. If the scores have the same total number of instruments but not the same ones, or not in
the same order, then the instrument names from the first score will overwrite ones from subsequent scores. If some of the
scores have fewer instruments than the first score, then empty staves will be created for those sections. Any part or staff
that is not present in the first score will be lost in the joined score.
Save album
Upon clicking the 
Close button, you will be prompted to save your album as a .album file. This file is not the same as a
joined score; it simply consists of the list of scores. Album files can be loaded into the Album Manager as described
above.
Automatic placement
MuseScore's automatic placement (AP) feature ensures that, in most cases, elements are correctly spaced and do not
collide or overlap with each other.
Note: When you create an element, AP is automatically enabled, but can be turned off if required (see 
Disable automatic
placement).
Default position
A newly-created element, such as staff text or fingering, assumes a default position on the 
staff specified by "positional"
properties contained in the Style menu. These "positional" properties may include things such as:
Placement: Whether the element appears above or below the staff.
Offset: For elements with no "Placement above/below" properties, this specifies the default position. See 
Offset X/Y.
181


Autoplace min distance: Minimum distance from other elements when autoplace is enabled.
For details of the settings available for each element type, see 
Layout and formatting: Style.
Change the default placement of an element
Use one of the following methods:
From the menu, select 
Format→Style; choose an element type and then adjust the placement/position settings.
Select a relevant element in the score and change the placement/position settings in the 
Inspector; then press the
Set as style" button (S) to update the 
Style settings.
Manual adjustments
Adjust position of element
Use one of the following methods:
Select the element and adjust the X and Y offsets in the Inspector
 (see X and Y offsets).
Move the element using the arrow buttons. Change to edit mode first, if necessary.
Drag and drop the element using the mouse
. Use this method in preference to the above, if you want to 
move an
element across another one (e.g. fingering across a slur). Once located on the other side you can use the X/Y
offsets in the Inspector, or the keyboard arrow keys to fine tune the position.
Place element above/below staff
Elements with a "Placement" property available in the Inspector can be easily moved from above the staff to 
below it, and
vice versa:
1. Select one or more elements.
2. Use one of the following methods:
Change the "Placement" setting in the Inspector.
Press X to toggle between above/below.
Note: When automatic placement is enabled for an element, you cannot position it in a way that causes a collision with
other elements.
Disable automatic placement
Select the element and uncheck the "Automatic placement" box in the 
Inspector.
The element reverts to its default position. It can be repositioned as desired and is no longer avoided when placing other
elements.
Stacking order
To change the value for Stacking order:
Select the element and change the "Stacking order" value in the Inspector.
In cases where elements are allowed to overlap, 
Stacking order controls the order in which they are placed on top of
each other. The element with the lower value will be placed behind.
Cross-staff notation
In piano scores, it is common to write a musical phrase extending across both staves—bass and treble. This can be
entered in MuseScore as follows:
1. Enter the notation in one staff to begin with. e.g.
2. Select a note and press 
Ctrl+Shift + ↓/↑ (Mac: 
Cmd+Shift + ↓/↑). This moves all the notes in that 
voice down/up to the
other staff. e.g.
182


Note: If you only want to move certain notes in a chord you need to ensure that they are in a separate voice.
3. To adjust the beam, double-click it to show the handles. Use the 
keyboard arrows or drag the handles to change the
beam angle and height:

Early music features
MuseScore offers several specialized functions to create engravings of early music (particularly medieval and
renaissance) akin to commercial editions from the 20th century onwards.
Unbarred (or unmetered) notation
In MuseScore, notes lasting longer than the duration of a measure are normally tied across barlines. However MuseScore
has a special feature which allows it to display the note values intact, without splitting and tying them in this way. This
enables you to notate music which is unbarred (i.e. not divided into measures), such as that of the renaissance:
1. From the menu bar, select Format→Style...→Score.
2. Tick the box labelled "Display note values across measure boundaries … ."
3. Click "OK" or "Apply." The existing score is immediately updated.
Example
1. The example below shows an excerpt from the original score of "De Profundis Clamavi" for 4 voices by Nicolas
Champion:
2. The same excerpt displayed in MuseScore:
3. And after activating "Display note values across measure boundaries … ."
183


4. To get rid of the barlines, just untick the “Show barlines” box in the Staff / Part properties dialog. See also
Mensurstrich (below).
Note: The feature is still in development and may contain bugs. The longest supported note value is the longa (a dotted
longa is still broken up and tied over).
Mensurstrich
Since a complete lack of barlines could make performing the music more difficult for current musicians, many modern
engravers settled on a compromise called Mensurstrich, where barlines are drawn between, but not across, staves.
To place barlines between staves:
1. In the lowest staff (usually the bottom staff of a system) where the proposed 
Mensurstriche is required, uncheck
"Show barlines" in the Staff/Part Properties dialog;
2. In the staff above where you want the 
Mensurstriche, click on one barline;
3. In the Barline section of the Inspector, tick the "Span to next staff" option;
4. In the Barline section of the Inspector, adjust the "Span from" value so that the top of the barline meets the bottom
line of the staff (e.g., set to 8);
5. Click the "Set as staff default" button.
Ambitus
Before there was the concept of an absolute pitch, performers were required to transpose vocal music to a singable range
for their ensemble "on the fly." To aid them, an ambitus was sometimes included, marking the entire range of a voice at
the beginning of the piece.
To apply an ambitus, use one of the following methods:
Drag the ambitus symbol (from the 
Lines palette of the Advanced workspace) onto a clef.
Select one or more clefs, then click (double-click prior to version 3.4) the ambitus symbol (in the 
Lines palette of the
Advanced workspace).
When applied, the ambitus automatically displays the note range of the score: if there is a 
section break then only the note
range of the section is displayed. Beyond the section break a new ambitus may be applied.
The note range of the ambitus can be adjusted manually by selecting it and changing the "Top note" and "Bottom note"
values in the Inspector. For automatic adjustment click the 
Update Range button in the inspector.
Mensural time signatures
In the mensural notation system, time signatures did not define the length of a measure, but the length of breves and
semibreves. MuseScore supports mensural time symbols as a display method in the Time signature properties dialog
rather than as symbols, but they are just for show, as the proportion of e.g. half notes per whole notes cannot be modified.
One way to make use of these symbols is to replicate when composers of the renaissance had multiple voices in different
time signatures simultaneously without using tuplets. Edit the time signature on a per-staff basis, as long as the beginning
and end of a measure in all staves match up. If they do not, then consider increasing the size of the measures to the
lowest common denominator.

Period tablature
Authentic-looking period tablature is possible for instruments such as the lute, theorbo etc. The various historical styles
are well supported by a choice of fretmark and note symbol fonts, optional “upside-down” tablature, and special symbols
for bass-string notes. See Tablature.

Figured bass
Adding a new figured bass indication
1. Select the note to which the figured bass applies;
2. Press the Figured Bass shortcut. The default isCtrl+G (Mac: Cmd+G): this can be changed in 
Prefences: Shortcuts if
desired;
3. Enter the text in the editor 'blue box' as required (see below);
4. Use one of the following options as required:
Press Space to move to the next note ready for another figured bass indication (or click outside the editor box to
exit it). The editor advances to the next note, or to the rest of the staff to which figured bass is being added.
(To move to a point in between, or to extend a figured bass group for a longer duration, see Duration (below)).
Shift+Space moves the editing box to the previous staff note or rest.
Tab advances the editing box to the beginning of the next measure.
Shift+Tab moves the editing box to the beginning of the previous measure.
Text format
Digits
Digits are entered directly. Groups of several digits stacked one above the other are also entered directly in a single text,
stacking them with Enter:
Accidentals
185


Accidentals can be entered using regular keys:
To enter:
type:
double flat
bb
flat
b
natural
h
sharp
#
double sharp ##
These characters will automatically turn into the proper signs when you leave the editor. Accidentals can be entered
before, or after a digit (and of course, in place of a digit, for altered thirds), according to the required style; both styles are
properly aligned, with the accidental 'hanging' at the left, or the right.
Combined shapes
Slashed digits or digits with a cross can be entered by adding 
\, / or + after the digit (combining suffixes); the proper
combined shape will be substituted when leaving the editor:
The built-in font can manage combination equivalence, favoring the more common substitution:
1+, 2+, 3+, 4+ result in 
 (or 
)
and 5\, 6\, 7\, 8\, 9\ result in 
 (or 
)
Please remember that / can only by combined with 
5; any other 'slashed' figure is rendered with a question mark.
+ can also be used before a digit; in this case it is not combined, but it is properly aligned ('+' hanging at the left side).
Parentheses
Open and closed parentheses, both round: '(', ')' and square: '[', ']', can be inserted before and after accidentals, before
and after a digit, before and after a continuation line; added parentheses will not disturb the proper alignment of the main
character.
Notes: (1) The editor does not check that parentheses, open and closed, round or square, are properly balanced. (2)
Several parentheses in a row are non-syntactical and prevent proper recognition of the entered text. (3) A parenthesis
between a digit and a combining suffix ('+', '\', '/') is accepted, but prevents shape combination.
Continuation lines
Continuation lines are input by adding an '_' (underscore) at the end of the line. Each digit of a group can have its own
continuation line:
Continuation lines are drawn for the whole duration of the figured bass group.
'Extended' continuation lines
186


Occasionally, a continuation line has to connect with the continuation line of a following group, when a chord degree has
to be kept across two groups. Examples (both from J. Boismortier, Pièces de viole, op. 31, Paris 1730):
In the first case, each group has its own continuation line; in the second, the continuation line of the first group is carried
'into' the second.
This can be obtained by entering several (two or more) underscores "__" at the end of the text line of the first group.
Duration
Each figured bass group has a duration, which is indicated by a light gray line above it (of course, this line is for
information only and it is not printed or exported to PDF).
Initially, a group has the same duration of the note to which it is attached. A different duration may be required to fit
several groups under a single note or to extend a group to span several notes.
To achieve this, each key combination in the table below can be used to (1) advance the editing box by the indicated
duration, and (2) set the duration of the previous group up to the new editing box position.
Pressing several of them in sequence without entering any figured bass text repeatedly extends the previous group.
Type:
to get:
Ctrl+1 1/64
Ctrl+2 1/32
Ctrl+3 1/16
Ctrl+4 1/8 (quaver)
Ctrl+5 1/4 (crochet)
Ctrl+6 half note (minim)
Ctrl+7 whole note
(semibreve)
Ctrl+8 2 whole notes (breve)
(The digits are the same as are used to set the note durations)
Setting the exact figured bass group duration is only mandatory in two cases:
1. When several groups are fit under a single staff note (there is no other way).
2. When continuation lines are used, as line length depends on the group duration.
However, it is a good practice to always set the duration to the intended value for the purposes of plugins and MusicXML.
Editing existing figured basses
To edit a figured bass indication already entered use one of the following options:
Select it, or the note it belongs to and press the same 
Figured Bass shortcut used to create a new one.
Double-click it.
The usual text editor box will open with the text converted back to plain characters ('b', '#' and 'h' for accidentals, separate
combining suffixes, underscores, etc.) for simpler editing.
Once done, press Space to move to a next note, or click outside the editor box to exit it, as for newly created figured
basses.
Style
To configure how figured bass is rendered: from the menu, select 
Format → Style… → Figured Bass.
187


Font: The dropdown list contains all the fonts which have been configured for figured bass. A standard installation
contains only one font, "MuseScore Figured Bass," which is also the default font.
Size: Select a font-size in points. 
Note: This value is also modified by any change made to 
Scaling (Format → Page
Settings…), or Scale ("Staff properties").
Vertical Position: The distance (in spaces) from the top of the staff to the top margin of the figured bass text.
Negative values go up (figured bass above the staff) and positive values go down (figured bass below the staff: a
value greater than 4 is needed to step over the staff itself).
Line Height: The distance between the base line of each figured bass line, as a percentage of font size.
The following picture visualizes each numeric parameter:
Alignment: Select the vertical alignment: with 
Top, the top line of each group is aligned with the main vertical
position and the group 'hangs' from it (this is normally used with figured bass notation and is the default); with
Bottom, the bottom line is aligned with the main vertical position and the group 'sits' on it (this is sometimes used in
some kinds of harmonic analysis notations):
Style: Choose between "Modern" or "Historic." The difference between the two styles is shown below:
Proper syntax
For the relevant substitutions and shape combinations to take effect and for proper alignment, the figured bass
mechanism expects input texts to follow some rules (which are in any case, the rules for a syntactical figured bass
indication):
There can be only one accidental (before or after), or only one combining suffix per figure;
There cannot be both an accidental and a combining suffix;
There can be an accidental without a digit (altered third), but not a combining suffix without a digit.
Any other character not listed above is not expected.
188


If a text entered does not follow these rules, it will not be processed: it will be stored and displayed as it is, without any
layout.

File formats
MuseScore can import and export a wide variety of file formats, allowing you to share and publish scores in the format that
best meets your needs.
MuseScore native format
MuseScore saves files in the following native formats:
*.mscz: The default MuseScore file format. Being compressed it takes up relatively little disk space.
*.mscx: An uncompressed MuseScore file format, mainly used for debugging or storing in a versioning system
.*.mscz, / .*.mscx,: These are backup files. Notice the point (full stop) added before the file name, and the comma
added to the file extension.
A note about fonts: MuseScore does not embed text fonts in saved or exported native format files. If you want your
MuseScore file to be viewed by other MuseScore users, make sure you are using the built-in Edwin (since version 3.6),
FreeSerif, or FreeSans font families for your text, or a font that the other parties have installed too. If a system does not
have the fonts specified in your original file, MuseScore will use a fallback option, which may cause your score to appear
differently.
MuseScore format (*.mscz)
MSCZ is the standard MuseScore file format and recommended for most uses. A score saved in this format takes up very
little disk space, but preserves all the necessary information. The format is a ZIP-compressed version of .mscx files and
includes any images the score may contain and a thumbnail.
Uncompressed MuseScore format (*.mscx)
MSCX is the uncompressed version of the MuseScore file format. A score saved in this format will retain all information,
except images. It can be opened with a text editor, allowing the user access to the file's source code.
MuseScore backup file (.*.mscz,) or (.*.mscx,)
Backup files are created automatically and saved in the same folder as your normal MuseScore file. The backup copy
contains the previously saved version of the MuseScore file and can be important if your normal copy becomes corrupted,
189


or for looking at an older version of the score.
The backup file adds a period to the beginning of the file name (
.) and a comma (
,) to the end (e.g. if your normal file is
called "untitled.mscz", the backup copy will be ".untitled.mscz,"), and the period and comma need to be removed from the
name in order to open the backup file in MuseScore. As it is stored in the same folder as your normal MuseScore file, you
may also need to give it a unique name (e.g. changing ".untitled.mscz," to "untitled-backup1.mscz").
Note: In order to see the MuseScore backup files, you may need to change your system settings to "Show hidden files".
See also How to recover a backup copy of a score
.
Graphic files (export only)
MuseScore can export a score as a graphic file in either 
PDF, PNG or SVG format.
PDF (*.pdf)
PDF (Portable Document Format) files are ideal for sharing your sheet music with others who do not need to edit the
content. This is a very widely-used format and most users will have a PDF viewer of some kind on their computers.
To set the resolution of exported PDFs:
1. From the menu bar, choose Edit→Preferences... (Mac: MuseScore→Preferences...), and select the "Export" tab;
2. Set the resolution in the "PDF" section.
PNG (*.png)
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files are based on a bitmap image format, widely supported by software on Windows,
Mac OS, and Linux, and very popular on the web. MuseScore creates PNG images as they would appear if printed, one
image per page.
To set the resolution of exported PNG images:
1. From the menu bar, choose Edit→Preferences... (Mac: MuseScore→Preferences...), and select the "Export" tab;
2. Set the resolution and transparency in the PNG/SVG section.
Note: If you want to create images that show only parts of the score (with or without screen-only items such as frame
boxes, invisible notes, and out-of-range note colors), use Image capture instead.
SVG (*.svg)
SVG
 (Scalable Vector Graphics) files can be opened by most web browsers (except Internet Explorer before version 9)
and most vector graphics software. However, most SVG software does not support embedded fonts, so the appropriate
MuseScore fonts must be installed to view these files correctly. SVG is the current format for all scores saved on
MuseScore.com.
To set resolution and transparency of exported SVG files, see the instructions under 
PNG (above). Note that MuseScore
does not (yet) support gradients on export (although it does for images in a score).
Audio files (export only)
MuseScore can create normalized, stereo audio of the score in any of the following formats: 
WAV, MP3, OGG VORBIS,
FLAC. To export an audio file:
1. From the menu, select 
File → Export...;
2. Choose the desired format from the dropdown menu, then press 
Save.
You can adjust the sample rate of all audio formats as follows:
1. From the menu bar, select 
Edit→Preferences... (Mac: MuseScore→Preferences...), and click on the Export tab;
2. Set "Sample rate" in the "Audio" section.
WAV audio (*.wav)
WAV (Waveform Audio Format) is an 
uncompressed sound format. This was developed by Microsoft and IBM, and is
widely supported by software for Windows, OS X, and Linux. It is an ideal format for use when creating CDs, as full sound
quality is preserved. For sharing via email or the internet, use a compressed alternative such as MP3.
MP3 (*.mp3)
MP3 is a very widely-used compressed audio format. MP3 files are ideal for sharing and downloading over the internet
due to their relatively small size.
190


To set the MP3 bitrate:
1. From the menu bar, choose Edit→Preferences... (Mac: MuseScore→Preferences...), and select the "Export" tab;
2. Set the MP3 bitrate in the "Audio" section.
FLAC audio (*.flac)
Free Lossless Audio Codec
 (FLAC) is compressed audio format. FLAC files are approximately half the size of
uncompressed audio and just as good quality. Windows and OS X do not have built-in support for FLAC, but software
such as the free and open source VLC media player
 can play FLAC files on any operating system.
Ogg Vorbis (*.ogg)
Ogg Vorbis
 is intended as a patent-free replacement for the popular MP3 audio format (which MuseScore also supports
—see above). Like MP3, Ogg Vorbis files are relatively small (often a tenth of uncompressed audio), but some sound
quality is lost. Windows and OS X do not have built-in support for Ogg Vorbis. However, software such as VLC media
player
 and Firefox
 can play Ogg files on any operating system.
Share with other music software
MuseScore can import and export MusicXML and MIDI files; it is also able to import a variety of native format files from
other music notation programs.
MusicXML (*.musicxml, *.xml)
MusicXML
 is the universal standard for sheet music. It is the recommended format for sharing sheet music between
different scorewriters, including MuseScore, Sibelius, Finale, and more than 100 others. MuseScore imports *.xml and
*.musicxml, exports *.musicxml, and the outdated 
*.xml(since version 3.5) because the program you want to import it needs
that, in previous MuseScore version you need to rename it yourself after the export.
Compressed MusicXML (*.mxl)
Compressed MusicXML creates smaller files than regular MusicXML. This is a newer standard and isn't as widely
supported by older scorewriters, but MuseScore has full import and export support.
MIDI (*.mid, *.midi, *.kar)
MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a format widely supported by sequencers and music notation software. For
details of the protocol see the MIDI Association
 website.
MIDI files are very useful for playback purposes but contain little in the way of score layout information (formatting, pitch
spelling, voicing, ornaments, articulations, repeats, key signatures etc.). To share files between different music notation
software, MusicXML is recommended instead.
For details about how to import MIDI files see 
MIDI import.
MuseData (*.md) (import only)
MuseData
 is a format developed by Walter B. Hewlett beginning in 1983 as an early means of sharing music notation
between software. It has since been eclipsed by MusicXML, but several thousand scores in this format are still available
online.
Capella (*.cap, *.capx) (import only)
CAP and CAPX files are created by the score writer, 
Capella
. MuseScore imports version 2000 (3.0) or later fairly
accurately.
Bagpipe Music Writer (*.bww) (import only)
BWW files are created by the niche score writer, 
Bagpipe Music Writer
.
BB (*.mgu, *.sgu) (import only)
BB files are created by the music arranging software, 
Band-in-a-Box
. MuseScore's support is currently experimental.
Overture (*.ove) (import only)
OVE files are created by the score writer 
Overture
. This format is mainly popular in Chinese-language environments,
such as Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. MuseScore's support is currently experimental and seems to support
191


Overture 3 and later only.
Guitar Pro (various—import only)
MuseScore can open Guitar Pro
 files with the following extensions: *.gtp, *.gp3, *.gp4, *.gp5, *.gpx, and, as of version
3.5, *.gp.
Power Tab Editor (*.ptb) (import only)
PTB files are created by 
Power Tab Editor
. MuseScore's support is currently experimental.

Fretboard diagrams
Note: This page applies to MuseScore 3.1 and above only. Users of versions prior to 3.1 should go to 
Fretboard diagrams
(prior to version 3.1).
Fretboard Diagrams overview
MuseScore allows the use and creation of 
fretboard (or chord) diagrams. They usually appear above the staff on lead
sheets and piano scores. They are commonly used for guitar chords, but MuseScore permits the creation of diagrams for
any instrument.
Below is a simple example of Fretboard Diagrams use.
(Note: Fretboard Diagrams are an alternative to and quite different from 
Tablature, which is a specialized notation form
that is preferred by some string instrument players.)
The Fretboard Diagram mechanism can be used in several different ways.
1. Standard chords. A set of 21 common chord diagrams for the guitar are found in the Fretboard Diagrams 
palette in
the Advanced Workspace. These consist of a single example of a major, minor, and seventh chord for each diatonic
scale tone (CDEFGAB). These 21 chords are adequate for many simple pop or folk music scores. See the overview
of this palette below.
2. Modified chords. In many cases, the standard chords from the Fretboard Diagrams palette are used as a starting
point for creating modified chord diagrams, via the Inspector. This technique enables chord extensions, alterations,
different voicings, different positions, etc. to be applied to the 21 standard diagrams. There are literally thousands of
guitar chords in general use, making a comprehensive palette or dictionary impractical. See How to use Fretboard
Diagrams for custom/complex chords
 for examples.
3. "Freehand" chords. More advanced guitarists often prefer to start from a blank chord grid, and then draw the
specific chord tones desired. See How to use Fretboard Diagrams for custom/complex chords
 for examples.
Note: Many aspects of music notation follow well-established engraving standards. Guitar chord diagrams are an
exception. Usage has varied widely from year to year, from publisher to publisher, from teacher to teacher, and from
arranger to arranger. Many inconsistent practices persist today, and distinct styles of chord notation are preferred in
different musical genres and regions. For this reason, the MuseScore Fretboard Diagram interface supports diagrams of
various types. Users are free to choose their preferences.
192


Overview of the standard guitar chord palette
The Fretboard Diagrams palette in the Advanced Workspace provides 21 diagrams, comprising a single major, minor, and
seventh chord for each diatonic scale tone (CDEFGAB). The name of each diagram appears when the cursor hovers over
the entry.
Note: This range of chord diagrams, or indeed any selection of 21 chords, would not typically be sufficient for publication
purposes. Arrangers must consider many other voicings, positions, and chord qualities. This palette is also an example of
the diverse diagram formats in use, as discussed above. These 21 chords happen to incorporate open/mute string
indicators (the X and O symbols above the diagrams). Although those symbols 
do often appear in published scores, their
usage varies by context. For example, jazz arrangements generally omit mute string indicators, unless contextually
important, and rarely use open strings.
Additional palettes that contain a broader range of standard chords are expected be available in the future. These would
try to address the needs of specific musical genres and situations.
Overview of creating modified or custom chords
Modified Fretboard Diagrams are created by 
adding and then editing an existing diagram from the palette. By modifying
standard chords, it is possible to create Fretboard Diagrams for any playable chord, and to reflect fingering on 
any
Western fretted stringed instrument, regardless of tuning, number of strings, or number of frets. Most of the material below
deals with the process of modifying diagrams and creating new ones.
Custom diagrams can be saved to a custom palette if desired for future use. Modified diagrams can of course be
copied/pasted within a score in the usual ways.
To add a Fretboard Diagram
To add a Fretboard Diagram to the score, use one of the following methods:
Select a note in voice 1 and double-click a Fretboard Diagram from the 
palette.
Drag and drop a Fretboard Diagram from a palette to the desired position in the score.
As the cursor hovers over the chosen diagram within the palette, its name will appear as a 
pop-up hint (see the example
in the overview).
Chord Symbols linked to Fretboard Diagrams
When adding a Fretboard Diagram to a score, a 
chord symbol is also automatically created. The chord symbol is normally
placed above the diagram, and uses the chord name from the chord's palette cell. Automatic placement and formatting of
a diagram's chord symbol is controlled by style settings (see style settings, below).
A Fretboard Diagram's generated chord symbol can be selected, moved, and modified like any other text element. It
behaves generally like the normal chord symbols that are added using 
Add→Text→Chord Symbol or the shortcut 
Ctrl+K.
193


Note 1: A field on the 
Chord Symbols style page (Style submenu: select Format→Style…→Chord symbols) – rather than on
the Fretboard Diagrams style page – controls the chord symbol's "
Distance to Fretboard Diagram". This value interacts
with the Element "Minimum distance" field, within the Inspector, to control automatic placement of the chord symbol
relative to the diagram. Note also that the Fretboard Diagram's "top edge" includes the blank space where open/mute
string indicators would appear, even if that area is empty. This may leave a larger gap than is desired. As usual, manual
placement can be used to override the automatic settings.
Note 2: Automatic chord symbols generated for Fretboard Diagrams are not completely integrated with normal Chord
Symbols that may be directly associated with notes on the staff. Specifically, focus does not flow from a Fretboard
Diagram's chord symbol back to the sequence of other symbols on the page when using Space to move through the chord
symbols. This minor issue will be addressed in a future update.)
Use of Chord Symbols with Fretboard Diagrams
Add a diagram's Chord Symbol automatically simply be adding a Fretboard Diagram as described above.
Delete a diagram's Chord Symbol by selecting the symbol and deleting it, as with any text item.
Add a new Chord Symbol to a diagram without one
 by selecting the Fretboard Diagram and using
Add→Text→Chord Symbol or the shortcut 
Ctrl+K.
To adjust a Fretboard Diagram's element properties (position, color, stacking order...)
The position of a Fretboard Diagram can be adjusted using the keyboard arrows in 
Edit mode; or with the X- and Y-
offsets in the "Element" section at the top of the Inspector.
Visibility, Color and Stacking order can also be adjusted in the "Element" section: see the diagram under 
editing.
To adjust global/default Fretboard Diagram style properties
Certain default and global properties of Fretboard Diagrams (see diagram below) can be adjusted from the 
Style
submenu: select Format→Style…→Fretboard Diagrams. Some of these properties are subject to override via the 
Inspector; but
most affect all Fretboard Diagrams in the score.
Default vertical position specifies the default placement of the diagram relative to the staff. (Subject to override via
Inspector).
Scale specifies the default scale (i.e. diagram size). (Subject to override via Inspector).
Fret number font size and ...position control placement of fret numbers on all diagrams. (Global).
Barre line thickness controls how large a line is used to represent a barre on all diagrams. By default, this is the
194


same thickness as the solid dots. A smaller line will allow dots to be visible under the barre, for situations where that
is desirable. (Global).
Relative dot size controls the size of dots on all diagrams, relative to the size of the scaled grid. (Global).
String spacing controls the spacing between strings, and thus the total width of all diagrams. (Global).
Fret spacing controls the spacing between frets, and thus the total height of all diagrams relative to the number of
frets they each display. (Global).
Most Fretboard Diagram properties exposed by the 
Inspector offer "reset to style default" and "save as style default"
buttons. These values do not typically appear on the style page, but are manipulated via the Inspector.
To edit a Fretboard Diagram
When a Fretboard Diagram is selected, it can be edited in the 
Inspector as follows:
The Inspector displays three sections related to the Fretboard Diagram:
An Element section that controls the Fretboard Diagram's visibility, placement, color, and other aspects that are
used in common with other MuseScore elements; see adjust element properties and the Inspector for details.
A Fretboard Diagram section, with control fields and buttons that define the appearance of this diagram.
A magnified version of the Fretboard Diagram, showing its details and allowing editing.
Below is an example of the 
Inspector with a Fretboard Diagram selected.
Editing Fretboard Diagram properties
(See Inspector properties above in the 
editing example.)
To adjust the scale (size) of the diagram: Use 
Scale.
To adjust the diagram's placement relative to the staff: Use Placement.
To adjust the number of instrument strings: Use Strings. Strings are added/removed from the left side of the
diagram.
To adjust how many frets to display (i.e. the height of the diagram): Use 
Frets. Frets are added/removed from the
bottom of the diagram.
To adjust the first fret position: Use Fret number. A digit is shown next to the first visible fret.
To specify thickening of the nut (a heavy line above the first fret): Use 
Show nut.
Place the finger dots as described below.
195


Finger dot editing (basic use)
(See Inspector properties above in the 
editing example.)
To remove all current dots, use the "Clear" button above the diagram. (Note: you could save a blank grid in a
custom palette, as a starting point for custom diagrams.)
To create a dot, click on a fret in the diagram at the bottom of the inspector; click again to remove the dot.
To move a dot, clear its current position by clicking on it; then create the desired dot.
To create a barre or partial barre: Click the "Barre" button above the diagram; then click at the leftmost position
desired for the barre. The barre will extend to the right edge of the fretboard. Keyboard shortcut: Holding the Shift
key, click on the string where you want a barre to begin.
To end a barre before the rightmost string
: Click the "Barre" button above the diagram; then click at the rightmost
position desired on an existing barre. The barre will end at that string. Keyboard shortcut: Holding the Shift key,
click on the string where you want a barre to end.
To delete a barre: Click the "Barre" button above the diagram; then click at the leftmost position of the barre. It will
be removed. Keyboard shortcut: Holding the Shift key, click on the leftmost position of the barre.
To create multiple barres: Use the above steps to create one than one barre, e.g. to show the third finger covering
two strings.
To adjust the barre thickness: Use the Style options (Format->Style->Fretboard Diagrams) to adjust the barre line
thickness relative to the dots. This will allow dots to be visible on the barre, for cases where that is desired.
To Indicate open and mute strings
 (optional). Click just above the diagram to toggle a string between:
Open (o)
Mute/unplayed (x)
No indication
Finger dot editing (advanced use)
Some arrangers and educators use a more advanced form of Fretboard Diagram that a) incorporates multiple types of
"dot", and that b) allows multiple dots per string.
This technique is particularly associated with the many books and arrangements published by 
Ted Greene and his
successors. (Note: No other notation software currently supports this diagram style.)
Multi-dot notation style. With this approach, the round dots are played first. Then, on successive beats, the notes
represented by the other dots are then played in order. This allows a single diagram to represent several beats of
music. (The usual sequence is: dot→X→square→delta. Usage varies however.) Here are two examples of multi-dot
diagrams.
Optional-note notation style. Another use of multiple dots per string allows other symbols to show optional notes,
rather than delayed notes. Typically, a related chord voicing is shown, such as an optional extension or an optional
rootless chord version. Here is an example of an optional extension.
MuseScore Fretboard Diagrams allow the creation of these and other types of multi-symbol diagrams. A chord is first
created and edited using the basic steps described above. Then, the multiple dot buttons above the diagram are used to
196


add secondary notes.
1. To begin adding multiple dots (i.e. symbols) to a diagram, click "Multiple dots".
2. To add another dot to a string
, click above or below an existing symbol. The next symbol in sequence will be
placed at that position, e.g. if there is already a dot, an X will appear next.
3. To remove any symbol from a diagram, click on it.
4. To enter a particular symbol out of sequence, click on the button with that symbol before adding the dot; e.g. to
enter an X on a string with no current dots, because that note should be played after the rest of the chord, click on
the X and then place it as desired.
(Note: Experienced users of Ted Greene style diagrams will find that several secondary features from Ted's diagrams are
not yet supported in MuseScore. These include: a. Displaying the fret number on a higher fret than the first visible fret. b.
Allowing the note symbols to include digits, not just the four dot styles currently supported. c. Allowing the creation of
annotation on and between diagrams, such as circling a particular note, or drawing lines linking notes in adjacent
diagrams. However, MuseScore does provide many tools for drawing and annotation that can serve in place of these
techniques.)
(Note: Because multi-note symbols are not standardized, even within the 
Ted Greene community, users must be careful
to indicate how they are being used within a given score.)

Palette with fretboard diagrams for Ukulele
 (Forum article)
Fretboard diagrams (prior to version 3.1)
Note: This page applies to versions of MuseScore prior to 3.1 only. Users of MuseScore 3.1 and above should go to
Fretboard diagrams.
A range of fretboard (or chord) diagrams for the guitar are provided in the Fretboard Diagrams 
palette in the Advanced
Workspace.
You can create a chord diagram for 
any fretted, stringed instrument by editing an existing one. It can be saved to a 
custom
palette for future use if required.
Add a fretboard diagram
To add a fretboard diagram to the score, use one of the following methods:
Select a note in voice 1 and double-click a fretboard diagram from a 
palette.
Drag and drop a fretboard diagram from a palette to the desired position in the score.
As the cursor hovers over the chosen diagram within the palette, its name will appear as a 
pop-up hint.
Edit a fretboard diagram
When a fretboard diagram is selected, it can be edited in the 
Inspector as follows:
To adjust the number of instrument strings: Use Strings.
197


To adjust the fret position number: Use Offset.
To adjust how many frets to display (height-wise): Use 
Frets.
To place the finger dots: Click on a fret to establish a dot; click again to remove the dot.
To create a barre or partial barre: First make sure that the desired fret position is clear of black dots (click on a dot
to remove it). Then, holding the Shift key, click on the string where you want the barre to begin. (Note: Only one barre
can be applied per diagram; a partial barre must end on the first string).
To delete a barre: Click on the black dot where the barre begins.
To Indicate open and mute strings
 (if applicable): Click just above the diagram to toggle a string between:
Open (o)
Mute/unplayed (x)
No indication.
To adjust the size: Use the 
Scale property.
To adjust a diagram's element properties
The position of a Fretboard Diagram can be adjusted using the keyboard arrows in 
Edit mode; or with the X- and Y-
offsets in the "Element" section at the top of the Inspector.
Visibility, Color and Stacking order can also be adjusted from the "Element" section.
To adjust a diagram's style properties
Certain default and global properties of Fretboard Diagrams (e.g. barre thickness, vertical position, scale, fret-number
font-size and position) can be adjusted from the Style submenu: select Format→Style…→Fretboard Diagrams. Some of these
properties are subject to override via the Inspector; but most affect all Fretboard Diagrams in the score.
Layer (experimental)
This feature is still experimental and only visible if MuseScore is started using the '-e' option, see 
Command line options
For the Open-Goldberg project, the ability to create different versions of the score was needed. One version is the
"Urtext", a score which is close to the original version of Bach. A second version could be a Czerny variation, which in
addition to the Urtext, contains fingerings.
The layer feature allows creating different versions out of one score file. If you want to add fingerings, you have to create a
layer and tag the fingering elements with the layer name.
First, create layers:
Second, create a score variant:
198


Add the visible layer to the score variant, then select all fingerings and tag them with the name of the score variant:
Default layer:
Czerny layer:
199

Command line options
MIDI import
MuseScore can import MIDI files (.mid/.midi/.kar) and convert them into music notation.
To import a MIDI file, use the standard 
Open command. This converts the MIDI file into a MuseScore file (.mscz)
and applies the default quantization settings.
The MIDI Import Panel appears at the bottom of the screen: you can expand this by dragging the interface with the
document window upwards. The panel shows all the tracks in the file (only those with note events are shown) and allows
you to adjust parameters affecting the conversion process. If there are multiple tracks, then one more track is added at
the top of the list to select all tracks at once.
To accept the default conversion: Simply press the "X" symbol on the top-left of the Import Panel to close it. The
panel can be re-opened at any time during the session by pressing "Show MIDI import panel" at the bottom of the
document window.
To reimport the file: Adjust the desired parameters in the Import Panel (see 
below) and press Apply. If you have
made changes to the Import Panel but wish to UNDO them, press Cancel. To close the Import Panel, press the "X"
symbol at the top-left of the panel.
If you reimport the file after making changes to the temporary generated result score, MuseScore will prompt you
what should happen with that modified score: Save it somewhere, Discard it or Cancel. The Save option will save the
modified score as a Musescore file in your \bin directory without modifying the original MIDI file. It will then reimport
the original MIDI file and apply the import panel settings. The import panel settings are NOT applied to the saved
file. The Discard option will UNDO your changes to the Musecore file, then reimport the original MIDI file and apply
the new settings. The Cancel option will reimport the original MIDI file in the first tab and apply any import panel
setting then create a new tab with your modified score but without applying any import panel settings. The second
tab is the same as hitting SAVE, then opening the saved file. Therefore, you cannot apply import panel settings to a
user modified score. You must first apply the import panel settings, make any changes to the score, then save the
score using the standard Save command.
Mouse wheel scrolling (MIDI Import Panel): Vertical scrolling is the default. For horizontal scrolling, press 
Shift or Ctrl
200


while using the wheel.
Available operations
MuseScore instrument
Assign a MuseScore instrument (listed in instruments.xml or in specified custom xml file in Preferences) that defines
staff name, clef, transposition, articulations, etc.
Quantization
Quantize MIDI notes by some regular grid. The grid MAX resolution can be set via the drop-down menu:
Value from preferences (default) - quantization value is taken from the main Preferences dialog of MuseScore
(in the “Import” tab)
Quarter, Eighth, 16th, 32nd, 64th, 128th - user-defined values
However, the actual quantization grid size is adaptive and reduces when the note length is small, so for each note
the quantization value is different. But there is an upper limit for the quantization value, and that value can be set by
the user as "max. quantization".
For example, if some note is long - say, half note, and the max. quantization is set to 8th, then the note will be
quantized with the 8th-note grid, not the half- or quarter-note grid as it supposed to be by the algorithm.
Such quantization scheme allows to quantize all notes in the score (with different lengths!) adequately.
Max. voices
Sets maximum count of allowed musical voices.
Search tuplets
When enabled, this option attempts to detect tuplets and applies the corresponding quantization grid to the tuplet
chords.
Is human performance
If enabled, this option reduces the accuracy of MIDI-to-score conversion in favor of readability. It is useful for
unaligned MIDI files, when no regular quantization grid is provided. For such files the automatic beat tracking
algorithm is used which tries to detect the bar positions throughout the piece.
2x less measure count
The option is active for unaligned MIDI files (when "Is human performance" is checked by default). It halves measure
count obtained in the internal beat tracking operation. It may be convenient when the beat tracking gives 2x more
frequent bar subdivision than necessary.
Time signature
The option is active for unaligned MIDI files. The user can choose an appropriate time signature for the whole piece
if the default detected value is wrong. The option is useful because it handles imported tuplets correctly unlike the
direct time signature setting from the palette.
Split staff
This option is suited mainly for piano tracks - to assign notes to the left or right hand of the performer. It uses
constant pitch separation (the user may choose the pitch via sub-options) or floating pitch separation (depending on
the hand width - sort of a guess from the program point of view).
For drum tracks (“Percussion” sound in the track list) it splits the staff into multiple staves, each of which gets only
one drum pitch (i.e. drum sound). There is also a sub-option to allow/disallow the application of the square bracket
for the newly created set of drum tracks.
Clef changes
Small clefs can be inserted within a staff to keep chords closer to the 5 staff lines. Clef changes depend on the
average pitch of the chord. Tied groups of notes are not broken by the clef insertion (if it occurs, one can report a
bug for algorithm in importmidi_clef.cpp). This option is available for non-drum tracks only.
Simplify durations
Reduces number of rests to form more "simple" note durations. For drum tracks this option can remove rests and
lengthen notes as well.
Show staccato
Option to show/hide staccato markings in the score.
Dotted notes
Controls whether MuseScore will use dotted notes or ties.
Show tempo text
Shows/hides tempo text markings in the score.
Show chord names
Shows/hides chord names in the score, if any, for XF MIDI file format.
Recognize pickup measure
When enabled, this option doesn't change the time signature of the first bar that is shorter than the second bar. It is
also called anacrusis. This option is only available for all tracks at once.
Detect swing
MuseScore tries to detect swing, and automatically replace a pattern of 4th + 8th notes in triplets (for the most
common swing feel, 2:1), or a dotted 8th + 16th pattern (for shuffle, 3:1), with two straight 8ths and a “Swing” or
“Shuffle” text at the beginning.
Master palette
The Master Palette is a repository of symbols used to populate the 
workspaces (Basic, Advanced, and Custom). It is also
201


used to create new Time Signatures and Key Signatures.
To open, use either of the following options:
Press Shift+F9 (Mac: fn+Shift+F9).
From the menu, select 
View → Master Palette.
The Master palette is divided into sections based on symbol type. Hovering the mouse over an item shows a 
tool tip (a
short definition in black on yellow background).
To transfer a Master palette item to a 
custom palette:
Drag the symbol from the Master Palette window into a custom palette.
Note: Except for the Symbols section (below), it is not usual to add items directly to the score from the Master palette: use
the workspace palettes instead. However, if desired, items can be added directly using either (i) drag-and-drop or (ii) by
selecting one or more notes/rests and double-clicking the item.
Symbols
The Symbols section of the Master Palette is a large repository of hundreds of musical symbols in addition to those found
in the preset workspaces. You can open it from the Master Palette, or directly from the score by using the shortcut 
Z.
Find a symbol
202


The Symbols subcategories can be displayed by clicking on "Symbols". Use the 
font menu on the bottom right of the box
to specify Emmentaler-, Gonville- or Bravura-specific symbols. You can search for a particular symbol by entering a
keyword in the search box.
Apply a symbol
To add an item to the score from the Symbols section, use any of the following options:
Drag and drop a symbol onto a staff.
Select a note or rest and double-click a symbol.
The position of the symbol can be adjusted by dragging or by changing the horizontal / vertical offsets in the 
Inspector.
Color and visibility can also be adjusted in the Inspector.
Note: Elements from the Symbols section do not follow any positioning rules (in many cases unlike identical elements
from other sections of the Master Palette), nor do they affect score playback.
Connect symbols
Elements from the Symbols section can be connected to each other on the score page, so that they can be moved as one
unit:
1. Apply first symbol to the score. Adjust position as required.
2. Double-click, or drag-and-drop, a second element onto the first symbol. Adjust position as required.
Drag the first element and the attached element will follow.

Note input modes
MuseScore allows you to choose from any of several note input modes. 
Step-time (see below) is the default, but others
can be accessed by clicking the small dropdown arrow next to the note entry button on the note input toolbar.
Step-time
This is the default method of note input and involves entering notes one at a time: first by selecting a note duration using
the mouse or computer keyboard, then choosing a pitch using the mouse, computer keyboard, MIDI keyboard or virtual
piano keyboard.
For details see Basic note entry.
Re-pitch
Re-pitch mode allows you to correct the pitches of a sequence of notes while leaving their durations unchanged (not to be
confused with Accidental: Respell pitches).
1. Select a note as your starting point;
2. Select the Re-Pitch option from the Note input drop-down menu; or use the keyboard shortcut, 
Ctrl+Shift+I (Mac:
Cmd+Shift+I).
3. Now enter pitches using the computer keyboard, MIDI keyboard or 
virtual piano keyboard.
You can also use the 
Re-pitch function to create a new passage from an existing one of the same sequence of durations
—by copying and pasting the latter, then applying Re-pitch.
Rhythm
203


Rhythm mode allows you to enter durations with a single keypress. Combining Rhythm and Re-pitch modes makes for a
very efficient method of note entry.
1. Select your starting point in the score and enter Rhythm mode.
2. Select a duration from the note input toolbar, or press a duration shortcut (numbers 1-9) on your computer keyboard.
A note will be added to the score with the selected duration. In contrast to Basic note entry, pressing the 
. key will
toggle dotting or not dotting all subsequent durations. All following rhythms will be dotted until the . key is pressed
again. Unlike Basic note entry, the dot is to be pressed prior to entering the rhythm.
3. Entering rests is similar to adding dotted notes. Press the 
0 key to toggle entering rests. All rhythms entered will be
rests until the 0 key is pressed again. This can be used concurrently with dotted notes.
4. Continue pressing duration keys to enter notes with the chosen durations.
5. Now use Re-pitch mode to set the pitches of the notes you just added.
Real-time (automatic)
The Real-time modes basically allow you to perform the piece on a MIDI keyboard (or MuseScore's 
virtual piano
keyboard) and have the notation added for you. However, you should be aware of the following limitations which currently
apply:
It is not possible to use a computer keyboard for Real-time input
You cannot enter tuplets or notes shorter than the selected duration
You cannot enter notes into more than one voice at a time
However, these restrictions mean that MuseScore has very little guessing to do when working out how your input should
be notated, which helps to keep the Real-time modes accurate.
In the automatic version of Real-time input, you play at a fixed tempo indicated by a metronome click. You can adjust the
tempo by changing the delay between clicks from the menu: Edit → Preferences... → Note Input (Mac: MuseScore → Preferences...
→ Note Input).
1. Select your starting position in the score and enter Real-time (automatic) mode.
2. Select a duration from the note input toolbar.
3. Press and hold a MIDI key or virtual piano key (a note will be added to the score).
4. Listen for the metronome clicks. With each click the note grows by the selected duration.
5. Release the key when the note has reached the desired length.
The score stops advancing as soon as you release the key. If you want the score to continue advancing (e.g. to allow you
to enter rests) then you can use the Real-time Advance shortcut to start the metronome.
Real-time (manual)
In the manual version of Real-time input, you have to indicate your input tempo by tapping on a key or pedal, but you can
play at any speed you like and it doesn't have to be constant. The default key for setting the tempo (called "Real-time
Advance") is Enter on the numeric keypad (Mac: 
Fn+Return), but it is highly recommended that you change this to a MIDI key
or MIDI pedal (see below).
1. Select your starting position in the score and enter Real-time (manual) mode.
2. Select a duration from the note input toolbar.
3. Press and hold a MIDI key or virtual piano key (a note will be added to the score).
4. Press the Real-time Advance key. With each press the note grows by the selected duration.
5. Release the note when it has reached the desired length.
Real-time Advance shortcut
The Real-time Advance shortcut is used to tap beats in manual Real-time mode, or to start the metronome clicks in
automatic Real-time mode. It is called "Real-time Advance" because it causes the input position to move forward, or
"advance", through the score.
The default key for Real-time Advance is 
Enter on the numeric keypad (Mac: 
Fn+Return), but it is highly recommended that
you assign this to a MIDI key or MIDI pedal via MuseScore's MIDI remote control. The MIDI remote control is available
from the menu: Edit → Preferences... → Note Input (Mac: MuseScore → Preferences... → Note Input).
Alternatively, if you have a USB footswitch or computer pedal which can simulate keyboard keys, you could set it to
simulate Enter on the numeric keypad.
When the notes are entered they will be placed just before the selected starting element, which will be highlighted with a
square blue marker. The start element and any subsequent notes or rests within the same measure will be shifted
forward. You can move the insertion point forward and backward using the arrow keys → or ←, and the new insertion point
will then be highlighted.
Insert
204


Insert Input mode (called Timewise in versions prior to 3.0.2) allows you to insert and delete notes and rests within
measures, automatically shifting subsequent music forwards or backwards. Measure duration is automatically updated as
you go.
1. Make sure you are in 
Note input mode, and that you have the element selected where you want to start inserting
notes/rests;
2. Click on the arrow next to the Note input icon, and select 
Insert (or if Insert is the current default, just press 
N);
3. Enter a note or rest as you would in 
Step-Time mode. Each note is inserted before the current cursor position;
4. Move the cursor forward and backward if required (using the arrow keys), to change the insertion point.
Alternatively, if you have only one or two notes to insert, you may prefer to use a shortcut:
Press Ctrl+Shift (Mac: Cmd+Shift) while adding the note by Mouse-click or keyboard shortcut (A-G).
If, at any time, the total duration of the notes and rests within the measure does not match the 
time signature, a small + or
- sign will be shown above the measure.
See also: Remove selected range (Tools).
Normal mode
To leave Note Input mode, click on the Note Input tool button, press 
N, or press 
Esc. This puts you in 
Normal mode, in
which you can change durations and delete notes or rests as follows:
If you select a note and press 
Del the note will be replaced by a rest of the same duration.
If you select a note or rest and press 
Ctrl+Del the note/rest will be deleted, and subsequent notes moved backward
(see Remove selected range).
If you reduce the duration of a note or rest the remaining duration will be filled with rests.
If you increase the duration of a note or rest it will subtract duration from the subsequent notes/rests to make up the
duration. If this is done on the last note/rest in the measure, a note or rest with the required duration will be inserted
in the start of the following measure, and the two will be tied together.

Notehead schemes
You can choose choose any one of nine 
notehead schemes for a standard staff. To set a notehead scheme:
Right-click on a staff and select Staff/Part Properties…; click on Advanced Style Properties… and choose from the
"Notehead scheme" dropdown list.
The schemes are as follows:
Normal: This is the default scheme and the one the vast majority of people will use: it is also the only scheme in
MuseScore 1 and 2. It uses normal noteheads which can be changed via the Noteheads palette or the Inspector.
Pitch name: Noteheads automatically and dynamically change to include the English pitch name in the notehead.
German pitch name: Just like the previous one but B will be replaced by H, and Bb by B.
205


Solfège Movable Do (also called Tonic Solfa)
: Noteheads include the solfege syllable, depending on the degree in
the scale. It uses Ti and not Si.
Solfège Fixed Do
: Noteheads include the solfege syllable for the note name. As used in France, Italy, Spain, etc...
It uses Si and not Ti.
4 Shape (Walker): Noteheads follow the four-shape system used in books such as William Walker’s 
Southern
Harmony (1835).
7 Shape (Aikin): Noteheads follow the seven-shape system used in books such as Jesse B. Aikin’s 
The Christian
Minstrel (1846), and books by the Ruebush & Kieffer Publishing Company. It's the most used 7-shape system.
7 Shape (Funk): Noteheads follow the seven-shape system used in books such as Joseph Funk’s 
Harmonia Sacra
(1851).
7 Shape Walker: Noteheads follow the seven-shape system used in books such as William Walker’s 
Christian
Harmony (1867).
(For more info about the different variant of shape notes, see the SMuFL specification
)
The setting applies to a given staff and the notehead will be used when entering and editing notes. Here is an example.
206


Noteheads
A range of alternative noteheads can be accessed via the 
Note Heads palette of the Advanced 
workspace, or the
Inspector (see Change notehead group, below).
Note: The design of the notehead may vary depending on the music font selected (Leland, Emmentaler, Gonville,
Bravura, MuseJazz, Petaluma). Those in the palette are displayed as half notes in Bravura font.
Notehead groups
MuseScore supports a range of notehead styles:
Normal: A standard notehead.
Crosshead (Ghost note): Used in percussion notation to represent cymbals. It also indicates muted and/or
percussive effects in stringed instruments such as the guitar.
Diamond: Used to indicate harmonic notes in instruments such as the guitar, violin etc.
Slash: Used to notate rhythms (e.g. guitar strums).
Triangle up/down: Used in percussion notation.
Shape notes: Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti.
Circle cross: Used in percussion notation.
Circled noteheads
Slashed notehead: A notehead with an oblique line through it.
Plus noteheads
Alt. Brevis: Used in early music notation.
Brackets (Parentheses): applied around an existing note (or accidental).
Change notehead group
To change the shape of one or more noteheads in the score, use one of the following:
Select one or more notes and click a notehead in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
Drag a notehead from a palette onto a note in the score.
Select one or more notes and change the notehead in the 
Inspector, using the drop-down list under 
Note → Head
group (not supported for drum staves).
Change notehead type
Occasionally you may need to change the 
apparent duration of a notehead—i.e. notehead type—without altering its
actual, underlying duration:
1. Select one or more notes.
2. Choose one of the following options from the 
Inspector under Note → Head type:
Auto: Automatic, i.e. apparent duration = actual duration.
Whole: Whole notehead, regardless of actual duration.
Half: Half notehead, regardless of actual duration.
Quarter: Quarter notehead, regardless of actual duration.
Breve: Breve notehead, regardless of actual duration.
Shared noteheads
When two notes in different voices, but of the same written pitch, fall on the same beat, one of two things may happen:
The notes may share the same notehead.
The notes may be offset: i.e. arranged side by side.
MuseScore uses the following rules:
Notes with stems in the same direction do not share noteheads.
Dotted notes do not share noteheads with undotted notes.
207


Black notes do not share noteheads with white notes.
Whole notes never share noteheads.
Note: If two unison notes occur in the 
same voice they are always offset.
Change offset noteheads to shared
To turn offset noteheads in opposite voices into 
shared noteheads :
Make the smaller-value notehead invisible by selecting it and using the keyboard shortcut V (or unchecking the
"Visible" option in the Inspector).
In a small minority of cases (where the smaller value note is dotted) this workaround is not applicable, so use the following
alternative:
Select the smaller value notehead and, in the "Note" section of the Inspector, change "Head type" to match that of
the larger value note in the opposite voice.
Examples of notehead sharing
1. In the first example below, the notes of voices 1 and 2 share noteheads by default, because they are all black,
undotted notes:
2. By contrast, in the next example, white notes cannot share noteheads with black notes, so are offset to the right:
To create a shared notehead, change the black eighth note's head type to match that of the white note or, pre-3.5,
make it invisible (as explained above):
Remove duplicate fret marks
In certain cases, a shared notehead, when pasted to a 
tablature staff, may result in two separate fret marks on adjacent
strings. To correct this, make any extraneous tablature notes invisible by selecting them and using the keyboard shortcut
V (or by unchecking the "visible" option in the Inspector).

Parts
MuseScore allows you to not only create and print a full score but also to generate individual player's 
parts from it.
A part can be created from a specific instrument staff in the main score or even from a specific 
voice within a staff. This
208


allows you to display multiple parts (e.g. Flute 1 & 2) on a single staff in the score but to extract them as separate parts.
Part Playback
Musescore "solos" the Part you're viewing during playback—i.e. no other Parts sound. This is because the Mixer’s “Play
Part Only” box is checked by default.
Simply uncheck the “Play Part Only” checkbox if you want hear all play enabled tracks while viewing a Part. Additionally
you can use the Mixer's mute and solo buttons to achieve various partial mixes of all available tracks. This can prove quite
helpful because it allows you to proofread, arrange and compose within any Part while hearing other tracks for context.
Create all parts
The most straightforward method is to create all parts at once. Parts are generated on a one-to-one basis from the
corresponding Instruments in the score:
1. From the menu, select 
File → Parts….
2. Click All Parts (MuseScore 3.2-3.3.4: Generate; prior to MuseScore 3.2: 
New All) (parts are named with the instrument
name, and a number added to differentiate parts that have the same label in the main score).
3. Click OK.
The parts can now be accessed by clicking on tabs above the document window.
Create specific parts
This method allows you to generate 
specific parts for only selected instruments (rather than all-at-once):
1. In the Parts window click 
Single Part (prior to MuseScore 3.4 
New) to create a part;
2. In the center pane, type the words you want to use for the "Part title" (this also serves for the corresponding part of
the filename when exporting);
3. Pick the instrument that you want to appear in your part from the "Instruments in Score" pane, and press 
+ to add it
to the "Instruments in Part" pane.
If you wish to create more parts, repeat steps 1 through 3 (
above) for each part.
4. Click OK to save the parts.
209


You have now finished setting up the parts. You do not need to do this again, unless you add or remove an instrument
from your full score.
Customize parts
Once you have generated a part (or all parts), you can select any part at the top and use the controls at the bottom to
control not only what instrument is in the part, but also which staves and voices within the instrument are included.
Add instruments to a part
To add instruments to an existing part:
1. Select the part in the "Parts" pane.
2. Select the instrument from the "Instruments in Score" pane.
3. Press + to add it to the "Instruments in Part" pane.
Remove instruments from a part
To remove instruments from an existing part:
1. Select the part in the "Parts" pane.
2. Select the instrument from the "Instruments in Part" pane.
3. Press - to remove the instrument.
Select staves for an instrument
To select the staves of an instrument to include in the part:
1. Select the part in the "Parts" pane.
2. Click the arrow next to the instrument in "Instruments in Part" to expand the listing to show all staves and voices of
the instrument.
3. Select the staff to be removed.
4. Press - to remove it from the instrument.
Select voices for an instrument
1. Select the part in the "Parts" pane.
210


2. Click the arrow next to the instrument in "Instruments in Part" to expand the listing to show all staves and voices of
the instrument.
3. Uncheck the voices to be removed.
Note: If you select only voice 1 for a given staff, then only the content in voice 1 for that staff will be included in the part.
Thus, in order to share flute 1 & 2 on the same staff, you will need to enter all notes onto both voices, even in passages
where they share content. You also cannot enter the two parts as chords in the passages where they share rhythms.
Delete a Part
1. Open the Parts dialog (
File → Parts…);
2. Select the relevant Part in the "Parts" pane;
3. Press Delete.
Export parts
In order to be able to export parts, those need to have been created first, see 
above
1. From the menu, select 
File → Export Parts…;
2. Navigate to the place you want them to be exported to and select the file format (PDF is the default);
3. For filename just enter whatever prefix is useful for all parts, or leave the default (the filename of your score);
4. Click OK.
This will generate files with the names "<title>" + "-" + "<part name>.<extension>". In addition, when exporting as PDF,
this will also generate "<title>" + "-Score_And_Parts.pdf".
Save parts
Parts and score are "linked", which means that any change to the content in one will affect the other, but changes to the
layout will not. When you have the parts created, they are saved along with the score (if you open the score you have
tabs for the score and every part you created).
However, if you wish to save a part individually:
1. Make sure the part is "active." Select its tab if not;
2. From the menu, select 
File → Save As….
Print a part
1. Make sure the part is "active." Select its tab if not;
2. From the menu, select 
File → Print to open the print dialog.
Plugins
What are Plugins?
Plugins are small pieces of software that add a particular feature to MuseScore. By enabling a plugin, a new menu option
is appended to the Plugins menu: subsequently, when this option is selected, the plugin performs a particular task in the
score.
Some plugins come pre-installed with MuseScore—see Plugins installed by default (below). You can find many more
plugins in the plugin repository
: some work with MuseScore 3, others only with older versions of MuseScore, and some
work with either. To tell one from the other: MuseScore 3.x and 2.x plugin code files have an extension of .qml; for older
versions, it is .js.
Warning: Plugins can potentially contain bad or malicious code, which can compromise or damage your scores or
system. Plugins are entirely unvetted (except for those that are installed by default). You either need to trust the author or
check the code yourself.
Installation
Note: Some plugins may require the installation of other components (fonts, e.g.) to work. Check the plugin's
documentation for more information.
Most plugins are provided as ZIP archives: download the plugin's .zip file and uncompress (unzip) it to one of the
directories mentioned below (depending on your OS). If the plugin is provided directly as an uncompressed .qml file,
simply download it and place into one of the same directories.
Once a plugin is installed, it needs to be enabled in the 
Plugin Manager in order to use it—see 
Enable/disable Plugins.
Windows
211


On Windows, new plugins should be installed into 
%HOMEPATH%\Documents\MuseScore3\Plugins. Alternatively, specify a
different folder in MuseScore's Preferences.
Pre-installed plugins can be found in 
%ProgramFiles%\MuseScore 3\Plugins (or %ProgramFiles(x86)%\MuseScore 3\Plugins for the 32-
bit versions) and in %LOCALAPPDATA%\MuseScore\MuseScore 3\plugins on Windows 7 and later. These folders should not be
modified.
macOS
On macOS, new plugins should be installed into 
~/Documents/MuseScore3/Plugins. Alternatively, specify a different folder in
MuseScore's Preferences.
Pre-installed plugins can be found in the MuseScore bundle in 
/Applications/MuseScore 3.app/Contents/Resources/plugins (to reveal
files in the app bundle, right-click on MuseScore 3.app and choose "Show package contents"), and in 
~/Library/Application
Support/MuseScore/MuseScore 3/plugins. These folders should not be modified.
Linux
On Linux, new plugins should be installed into 
~/Documents/MuseScore3/Plugins. Alternatively, specify a different folder in
MuseScore's Preferences.
Pre-installed plugins can be found in 
/usr/share/mscore-3.x/plugins and in ~/.local/share/data/MuseScore/MuseScore3/plugins. These
folders should not be modified.
The directory names might be slightly different, depending on your operating system's language.
Enable/disable plugins
To be able to access the installed plugins from the Plugins menu, they need to be enabled in the 
Plugin Manager:
You do this simply by checking the appropriate tick box. This adds the name of the plugin to the list in the 
Plugins menu.
Create/edit/run plugins
It is possible to create new or edit existing plugins and run them via the 
Plugin Creator:
212


Documentation of all available elements can also be found here.
Plugins installed by default
Some plugins come pre-installed with MuseScore, but they are not enabled by default. See 
Enable/disable plugins
(above) to enable plugins.
ABC Import
This plugin imports ABC
 text from a file or the clipboard and converts it to 
MusicXML. Internet connection is required,
because it uses an external web-service
 for the conversion.
Notes → Color Notes
This demo plugin colors notes in the selected range (or the entire score), depending on their pitch. It colors the note head
of all notes in all staves and voices according to the Boomwhackers convention. Each pitch has a different color. C and C♯
have a different color. C♯ and D♭ have the same color.
To color all the notes in black, just run that plugin again (on the same selection). You could also use the 'Remove Notes
Color' plugin
 for this.
Create Score
This demo plugin creates a new score. It creates a new piano score with 4 quarter notes: C, D, E, F. It's a good start to
learn how to make a new score and add notes from a plugin.
helloQml
This demo plugin demonstrates some basic tasks.
Notes → Note Names
This plugin names notes in a selected range or for the entire score. It displays the names of the notes (as 
staff text)
according to MuseScore's language settings: voices 1 and 3 notes above the staff; voices 2 and 4 notes below the staff;
and chord notes in a comma separated list, starting with the top note.
Panel
This demo plugin creates a GUI panel.
random/random2
Creates a random score.
run
This demo plugin runs an external command. Probably this will only work on Linux.
scorelist
This test plugin iterates through the score list.

Preferences
You can customize many of MuseScore's default behaviors via the menu: 
Edit→Preferences... (Mac: MuseScore→Preferences...).
The Preferences dialog has multiple tabs:
Reset All Preferences to Default will reset all preferences to the ones MuseScore had when you installed it. 
Ok will save the
settings and close the dialog. Cancel will close the dialog without applying changes. 
Apply will make changes take effect
without closing the dialog.
General
Here you can define:
Program Start: Specify whether to start the session empty or to display a score. The options are one of the
following: Start empty (no score) / 
Continue last session / Start with new score (i.e. New Score Wizard automatically
opens) / Start with score (the program default, or one of your own choosing).
You can also choose which panels to display. This can be any combination of: Splash screen, Play Panel, Navigator,
or Start Center. Also select if Tours will be active.
Folders: Specify the default folders for score files, 
style files, custom score templates, plugins, additional
SoundFonts, images, and extensions.
Language: Choose the language used by the program. Translations may be updated from here too. Note that
language translation updates can also be done via the menu: Help→Resource Manager.
Telemetry: Tick/untick to authorize MuseScore to collect usage data. The type of data collected is listed, and
updated as needed, in telemetry
.
Appearance: Specify a dark or light theme, and the width and height of icons. Set display "Font face" and "Font
214


size".
Auto Save: How frequently the program autosaves.
OSC Remote Control
Canvas
Use Canvas to set your preferred color and wallpaper for the score background and paper. The default "Background" is
dark blue (RGB 20, 36, 51; Alpha 255) and the default "Paper," white.
Background: Use this to set the color or background 
around the score pages. Select "Color" then click on the bar to
the right and make a choice from the color picker; or select "Wallpaper," click on the file icon and set a background
image.
Paper: Sets the color or background of the score pages. Controls identical to "Background" (above). You can also
tick/untick "Use the same color in palettes".
Zoom: This defines the Default zoom level and keyboard/mouse zoom precion.
Scroll Pages: This defines the way that the pages are laid out in the score. Choose "Horizontally" for a row layout,
or "Vertically" for a column layout. To limit scrolling, tick "Limit scroll area to page borders".
Miscellaneous: "Draw antialiased" (the default option) makes diagonal lines and edges of shapes look smoother.
"Proximity for selecting elements" controls the distance the mouse may be from an object and still act on it. Smaller
numbers require more precision, making it harder to click on small objects. Larger numbers are less precise, making
it harder not to click on nearby objects unintentionally. Choose a comfortable working value.
Note input
215


On this tab there are note input and MIDI remote control preferences. Here the following can be set:
Note Input
Enable MIDI Input: Leave checked to allow MIDI input of notes.
Color notes outside of usable pitch range: For details, see Coloring of notes outside an instrument's range and
Usable pitch range (Staff properties: all staves).
Delay between notes in automatic real-time mode: See Real-time (automatic).
Play notes when editing: When ticked, MuseScore sounds the note when it is entered or selected. Tick "Play
whole chord when adding note," if you want to hear all the notes of a chord when it is added to. You can also edit the
"Default duration".
MIDI Remote Control
Midi Remote Control allows you to use certain keys on your MIDI keyboard to enter notes and rests 
and to select note
durations, without involving the computer mouse or (computer) keyboard. The default setting is off.
To assign a command to a MIDI key:
1. Ensure that "MIDI Remote Control" is checked (your MIDI keyboard should be connected before opening the
program).
2. Click the red button next to the option you wish to assign a MIDI key to: the red button now lights up.
3. Press a MIDI keyboard key. The red button becomes unlit and the green button lights up instead. The MIDI key has
now been assigned to the desired option.
4. Repeat "2" and "3" to assign other keys.
Once you have defined your key settings you can use the MIDI keyboard to control note input operations. You can verify
your key settings by observing the MuseScore Note Input toolbar while pressing the MIDI keys.
To temporarily deactivate Midi Remote Control: uncheck "Midi Remote Control": all MIDI input key action buttons are now
greyed out. Note: Your key assignments are always saved between MuseScore sessions and are not affected by
deactivation.
Notes: (1) The "Clear" option turns off all the green buttons for the 
current MuseScore session but all the user-recorded
MIDI key settings are retained and will be reloaded on the next session. (2) A MIDI key setting that is activated cannot
afterwards be turned off, and the green button will always remain lit: however it can be overwritten with a different MIDI
key by using the red button again. (3) If the same MIDI key is accidentally assigned to more than one option, then all the
associated green buttons remain lit although only one will work. To fix, see "(2)".

Recovered files
If MuseScore or your computer should crash, or if power is lost, a pop-up message upon restarting MuseScore will ask if
you wish to restore the previous session:
Click Yes, to initiate attempted recovery of files from the interrupted session. Or click 
No to ignore message.
Saving after session recovery
When MuseScore recovers files after a crash, it renames them with the full path name added in front of the original file
name. This very long name will appear in the tab(s) above the active score window.
To ensure that the file is saved in its original location
. You should immediately save the restored file using the 
"Save As..."
option: this will open a window to allow you to navigate to the correct folder and directory. If you use the "Save" command
instead, the file will be saved in its current location which is unlikely to be the original one.
Finding recovered files
In the event that 
"Save" is used instead of "Save As..." with a recovered file, you will have to find the files in your computer.
The actual location of those files will vary, depending on your operating system, and in which directory MuseScore is
installed.
For Windows 7, with a default installation of MuseScore to the program files directory, recovered files are auto-saved to
C:\Program Files\MuseScore 3\bin (actually %ProgramFiles%\MuseScore 3\bin).
For Windows 10, look in 
C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\MuseScore 3\bin
(actually%LOCALAPPDATA%\VirtualStore\%ProgramFiles:~3%\MuseScore 3\bin).
You may need to run a system-wide search in order to find files saved directly after a session recovery. Use keywords
from the original file name as well as wildcards, and specify the date modified.

Score Comparison
The Score Comparison Tool allows you to compare two versions of a score to find the differences between them.
Introduction
To open the Score Comparison Tool:
From the menu, select 
View→Score Comparison Tool.
221


The dialog opens below the document window and consists of three sections (left to right):
Choose scores to compare: Select the scores you want to compare.
Diff mode: Select how to view the comparison.
Comparison: A line by line comparison of the scores is displayed.
Select score
The first step is to select the score. Use the combo box next to "Score 1" to choose between the currently open scores, or
click on the Browse button to open the File Explorer and select a score from disk. Secondly, use the next combo box on the
right to choose whether the first score should be the current version, or the last saved version. Score 2 is set to the same
score you selected for Score 1, but you may choose another of the open scores.
When you have selected the scores and versions press 
Compare to do the comparison.
Choose view
"Intelligent comparison" is the default option in 
Diff mode: this displays the differences between the scores in a human-
readable format (e.g. "Measure 1: Note: property pitch changed from B4 to C5"). Change the Diff Mode selection to "Raw"
if you prefer to see the results displayed in XML code.
View comparison
When you press Compare a list of differences will be displayed to the right, and the score view will automatically change to
Documents Stacked. In the Comparison section, double-click on a difference from the list and both score views will
automatically pan to show you the changed element, which will also be highlighted.
Leave comparison
To exit the Score Comparison tool, turn off the two options "Score Comparison Tool" 
and "Documents Stacked" in the View
menu.
Example
Below you will see two small scores with a few differences between them.

1. Make sure that the applicable score or instrument part is the active tab;
2. From the menu, select 
File → Score Properties;
3. Edit the text of the various meta tags as required;
4. To add another meta tag, click on the 
New button. Fill in the "New tag name" field and press 
OK;
Pre-existing meta tags
Every score displays the following fields in 
Score Properties:
File Path: The score file's location on your Computer.
MuseScore Version: The version of MuseScore the score was last saved with.
Revision: The revision of MuseScore the score was last saved with.
API-Level: The file format version.
arranger: (empty)
composer: This is initially set to the same text as "Composer" on the first page of the 
New Score Wizard.
copyright: This is initially set to the same text as "Copyright" on the first page of the 
New Score Wizard (if you need
a copyright symbols, copy/paste this: ©).
creationDate: Date of the score creation. This could be empty, if the score was saved in test mode (see 
Command
line options).
lyricist: This is initially set to the same text as "Lyricist" on the first page of the 
New Score Wizard.
movementNumber: (empty)
movementTitle: (empty)
originalFormat: This tag exists only if the score is imported (see 
file formats).
platform: The computing platform the score was created on. This might be empty if the score was saved in test
mode.
poet: (empty)
source: May contain a URL if the score was downloaded from or 
saved to MuseScore.com.
translator: (empty)
223


workNumber: (empty)
workTitle: This is initially set to the same text as "Title" on the first page of the 
New Score Wizard.
Entering Work / Movement / Part metadata
workNumber is the number of the larger work (e.g. 8—for "The Four Seasons," Op. 8, by Vivaldi).
workTitle is the title of the larger work (e.g "The Four Seasons,").
movementNumber is the number of the movement in the larger work (e.g. 3 for Autumn).
movementTitle is the title of the movement in the larger work (e.g.“Autumn”).
It is customary, when using the New Score Wizard, to create a work with the 
movementTitle as title (even though it ends
up in workTitle then) and, directly after creating the score, amending this information in the Score Properties dialogue.
Every part additionally has the following meta tag, generated and filled on part creation:
partName: The name of the part as given on part creation (which is also used to fill the corresponding part name
text in the top vertical frame—be aware that later changes to one are not reflected in the other
).
Header/Footer
To show the content of one or more meta tags in a header or footer for your score/part:
1. Make sure that the correct score or instrument part is the active tab;
2. From the menu, select 
Format → Style... → Header, Footer:
If you hover with your mouse over the Header or Footer text region, a list of macros will appear, showing their
meaning, as well as the existing meta tags and their content.
224


3. Add tags (e.g. 
$:workTitle:) and macros (e.g. 
$M) to the appropriate boxes, as required;
4. Click Apply to see how the header or footer looks in the score. Make corrections to the dialog if required;
5. If an instrument part is in the active tab, click 
Apply to all parts, if you want to apply these settings to all the score parts;
6. Click OK to assign the header or footer and exit the dialog.

Staff / Part properties
The Staff / Part Properties dialog allows you to make changes to the display of a 
staff, adjust its tuning and
transposition, change instrument etc. To open:
Right-click onto either an empty area in a staff, 
or the instrument name, and select 
Staff/Part Properties....
Staff / Part Properties dialog, as of version 3.0.
225


Staff Types
For practical purposes, there are four different types of staff:
1a. Standard staff I. A pitched staff used for most instruments except fretted, plucked-string ones.
1b. Standard staff II. A pitched staff containing a fretted, plucked-string instrument, with options to set the number of
instrument strings and tuning.
2. Tablature staff. A staff containing a fretted, plucked-string instrument, which displays music as a series of fret-marks on
strings. Also contains options to set the number of instrument strings and tuning.
3. Percussion staff. A pitched staff for percussion instruments.
It is possible to change one type of staff into another using the 
Instruments dialog, as long as the original staff is loaded
with the right instrument. For example, in order to change a standard staff to tablature, it must contain a plucked-string
instrument. Similarly, to change a standard staff to a percussion staff you need to ensure that it has an appropriate
percussion instrument loaded and so on.
Most options in the Staff / Part properties dialog are common to all staves, but each type also has one or two specific
options of its own.
Staff / Part Properties: all staves
The following Staff Properties options are common to 
all staves:
Lines
The number of lines making up the staff.
Line Distance
The distance between two staff lines, measured in spaces (abbr.: sp.). Note: It is not recommended to change this value
from the default shown. If you need to make the staff larger or smaller, use the Page Settings dialog instead.
Extra distance above staff
Increases or decreases the distance between the selected staff and the one above in all systems. Note: This setting does
not apply to the top staff of a system, which is controlled by the minimum/maximum system distance (see Layout and
formatting: Format → Style … → Page).
Notes: To alter the spacing above just 
one staff line in a particular system, see 
Breaks and Spacers.
Scale
Changes the size of the selected staff and all associated elements, as a percentage (to adjust the 
overall score size, use
Scaling from the Format→Page Settings… menu).
Hide when empty
Together with the "Hide empty staves" setting in Format → Style ... → Score, this determines if the staff will be hidden
when it is empty.
Possible values:
Auto (default): The staff will be hidden if it is empty and "Hide empty staves" is set.
Always: The staff will be hidden when empty, even if "Hide empty staves" is not set.
Never: The staff will never be hidden when empty.
Instrument: For instruments containing multiple staves, the staff is hidden only if all staves for that instrument are
empty.
Show clef
Whether the staff clef will be shown.
Show time signature
Whether the staff time signature(s) will be shown or not.
Show barlines
Whether the staff barlines will be shown.
Hide system barline
Show/hide barline at left-hand edge of the staff.
Do not hide if system is empty
Never hide this staff, even if the entire system is empty. This overrules any "Hide empty staves" setting in Format → Style
... → Score.
Small staff
Create a reduced-size staff. You can set the default from the menu in Format → Style ... → Sizes.
Invisible staff lines
Make staff lines invisible.
226


Staff line color
Use a color picker to change the color of the staff lines.
Cutaway
Used to create a cutaway staff in which only measures containing notes are visible (e.g. ossias
 (Wikipedia); or cutaway
scores). This can be used independently of "Hide when empty" or "Hide empty staves".
Instrument
The instrument loaded in the Instruments (I) or Select Instrument dialog. The sound associated with this instrument can
be changed, if desired, in the Mixer.
Note: The properties below (i.e. Part Name, Long Instrument Name etc.) are set to the default values defined in the
MuseScore instruments.xml
 file.
Part name
The name of the part. This is also displayed in the 
Mixer and the Instruments dialog (I). Any edits you make to the Part
name affect only that particular instrument and no other.
Note: The Part name is defined by the value of the 
trackName element in the instruments.xml
 file. If trackName has not
been defined, the value of longName (i.e. "Long instrument name"—see below) is used instead.
Long instrument name
Name displayed to the left of the staff in the first system of the score. The long instrument name may also be edited
directly as a text object (see Text editing).
Short instrument name
Name displayed to the left of the staff in subsequent systems of the score. The short instrument name may also be edited
directly as a text object (see Text editing). Editing affects all occurrences in the score.
Usable pitch range
Amateur: Notes outside this range will be colored olive green/dark yellow in the score.
Professional: Notes outside this range will be colored red in the score.
To disable out-of-range coloration of notes: From the menu, select 
Edit→Preferences... (Mac: MuseScore→Preferences...),
click on the "Note Input" tab, and uncheck "Color notes outside of usable pitch range."
See also, Coloring of notes outside an instrument's range.
Transpose written pitches to sound
This option ensures that the staves of transposing instruments display music at the correct written pitch. Set the transpose
in term of a musical interval (plus octave if required) up or down.
Use single note dynamics (as of version 3.1)
Leave ticked to allow playback of single note dynamics (such as sfz etc.) and hairpins, diminendo and crescendo lines on
single (or tied) notes.
Navigation arrows
Use the ↑ and ↓ buttons, at the bottom left of the Staff Properties window, to navigate to the previous or next staff.
Staff / Part Properties: plucked strings only
Staves of fretted, plucked-string instruments have a few extra options in addition to those listed 
above,
Number of strings
Displays the number of instrument strings.
Edit String Data…
This button opens a dialog box which allows you to set the number and tuning of strings. See Change string tuning.
Advanced Style Properties
Clicking the Advanced Style Properties... button opens a window giving access to advanced display options for the staff. These
will vary depending on the staff type chosen: see the relevant sections below for details.

At the bottom of the Advanced Style Properties dialog there are a number of buttons which allow you to easily change the
following:
The number of lines displayed by a percussion staff
.
The staff type of a plucked-string instrument
. For example, you can change from standard staff to tablature and vice
versa, or select from a number of tablature options.
227


1. Make a selection from the drop-down list labelled "Template";
2. Press < Reset to Template;
3. Press OK to accept the changes and exit the dialog (or 
Cancel to cancel the operation).
Standard and Percussion staff options
Show clef / time signature / barlines / key signature / ledger lines
Option to turn the display of these elements ON or OFF.
Stemless
If checked, staff notes will have no stem, hook or beam.
Notehead scheme
See Notehead scheme.
Tablature staff options
Upside down
If not checked, the top tablature line will refer to the highest string, and the bottom tablature line to the lowest string (this is
the most common option). If checked, the top tablature line refers to the lowest string, and the bottom tablature line to the
highest line (e.g. Italian-style lute tablatures). For example:
'Upside down' tablature.
Tablature staff options: Fret Marks
Fret marks are the numbers or letters used to indicate the location of notes on the fingerboard. The following group of
properties define the appearance of fret marks:
Font
The font used to draw fret marks. 8 fonts are provided supporting all the necessary symbols in 8 different styles (modern
Serif, modern Sans, Renaissance, Phalèse, Bonneuil-de Visée, Bonneuil-Gaultier, Dowland, Lute Didactic).
Size
Font size of fret marks in typographic points. Built-in fonts usually look good at a size of 9-10pt.
Vertical offset
MuseScore tries to place symbols in a sensible way and you do not usually need to alter this value (set to 0) for built-in
fonts. If the font has symbols not aligned on the base line (or in some other way MuseScore does not expect), this
property allows you to move fret-marks up (negative offsets) or down (positive offsets) for better vertical positioning.
Values are in sp.
Marks are
Choice of Numbers (‘1’, ‘2’...) or Letters (‘a’, ‘b’...) as fret marks. When letters are used, ‘j’ is skipped and ‘k’ is used for
the 9th fret.
Marks are drawn
Choice of placing fretmarks On lines or Above lines. For example:
Fretmark letters placed above line.
Lines are
Choice of Continuous (lines pass through fret marks) or 
Broken (a small space appears in the line where the fretmark is
displayed). For example:
228


Tablature with lines broken.
Show back-tied fret marks
If unticked, only the first note in a series of tied notes is displayed. If ticked, all notes in the tied series are displayed.
Show fingering in tablature
Tick to allow the display of fingering symbols applied from a palette.
Tablature staff options: Note Values
This group of properties defines the appearance of the symbols indicating note values.
Font
The font used to draw the value symbols. Currently 5 fonts are provided supporting all the necessary symbols in 5
different styles (modern, Italian tablature, French tablature, French baroque (headless), French baroque). Used only with
the Note symbols option.
Size
Font size, in typographic points. Built-in fonts usually look good at a size of 15pt. Used only with the Note symbols option.
Vertical offset
Applies only when Note symbols is selected (see below). Use negative offset values to raise the note value symbols,
positive values to lower them.
Shown as:
None: No note value will be drawn (as in the examples above)
Note symbols: Symbols in the shape of notes will be drawn above the staff. When this option is selected, symbols
are drawn only when the note value changes, without being repeated (by default) for a sequence of notes all of the
same value. E.g.
Stems and beams: Note stems and beams (or hooks) will be drawn. Values are indicated for each note, using the
same typographic mechanics as for a regular staff; all commands of the standard Beam Palette can be applied to
these beams too. E.g.
Repeat:
If several notes in sequence have the same duration, you can specify if and where to repeat the same note symbol. i.e.
Never
At new system
At new measure
Always
Note: This option is only available if "
Shown as: Note symbols" is selected (see above).
Stem style:
Beside staff: Stems are drawn as fixed height lines above/below the staff.
Through staff: Stems run through the staff to reach the fret marks.
Note: This option is only available when "
Shown as: Stems and Beams" is selected (see above).
Stem position:
Above: Stems and beams are drawn above the staff.
229


Below: Stems and beams are drawn below the staff.
Note: This option is only available when "
Shown as: Stems and Beams" and "Stem style: Beside staff" is selected (see
above).
Half notes:
None
As short stems
As slashed stems
Note: This option is only available when "
Shown as: Stems and Beams and "Stem style: Beside staff" is selected (see
above).
Show rests
Whether note symbols should be used to indicate also the rests; when used for rests, note symbols are drawn at a slightly
lower position. Used only with the Note symbols option.
Preview
Displays a short score in tablature format with all the current parameters applied.
Change instrument
You can change any instrument in a score to a different instrument at any time. The following method updates instrument
sound, staff name, and staff transposition all at once.
1. Right-click on an empty part of any measure OR on the instrument name and choose 
Staff Properties...;
2. Click on Change Instrument... (under "Part Properties");
3. Choose your new instrument and click 
OK to return to the Staff Properties dialog;
4. Click OK again to return to the score.
Not to be confused with 
Mid-staff instrument change.

Staff Type Change
You can change the appearance of a staff mid-score by adding a 
Staff type change element to a measure, and adjusting
its properties in the Inspector.
Add a Staff Type Change
1. Select a measure in the score and, in the "Text" 
palette, click (double-click prior to version 3.4) the "Staff type
change" symbol, 
; alternatively, drag the "Staff type change" icon onto a measure;
2. Select the symbol, and adjust its properties (see below) in the 
Inspector as required.
Staff type change properties
When you alter a Staff type change property in the Inspector, the new value takes precedence over the value shown in
the global Staff properties dialog. Only those property values in "Staff Properties" that cannot be changed in the "Staff
type change" dialog will be valid throughout the score.
The properties that can be altered in the 
Staff type change dialog in the Inspector are:
Offset
How far the changed staff shall be moved up or down: measured in spaces (abbr.: sp) .
Small
Tick the box to create a reduced-size staff.
Scale
Changes the size of the staff and all associated elements, as a percentage.
Lines
The number of lines making up the staff.
230


Line distance
The distance between two staff lines, measured in spaces (abbr.: sp).
Step offset
How many steps up or down the notes in the staff are offset.
Show barlines
Whether the staff barlines will be shown.
Show ledger lines
Whether ledger lines will be shown for notes above/below the staff lines.
Slash style
Whether the notes shall be shown in standard or slash style.
Notehead scheme
Allows selection of how noteheads are displayed.
Generate clefs
Whether the staff clef will be shown.
Generate time signatures
Whether the staff time signature(s) will be shown or not.
Generate key signatures
Whether the staff key signatures will be shown or not.
Example
To illustrate the use of Staff type change, the staff shown below was created using the following steps:
1. Add a Staff type change to measure 2.
2. Set size to "Small".
3. Set "Lines" to 4.
4. Add a second Staff Type Change to measure 3.
5. Change "Lines" to 7,
Afterwards the global Staff Properties are changed using Staff properties:
1 Set "Lines" to 2.
2. Change "Staff Line Color".
As can be seen, the change in "Lines" is only effective up to the first staff type change, whereas the change to "Staff Line
Color" is effective throughout the score.
Timeline
Introduction
The timeline was developed as part of the Google Summer of Code 2017, and is included for the first time in MuseScore
3.0.
Overview
The timeline is a navigation tool that displays an abstraction of the score to the order of measure numbers and instrument
names. There are four parts to the timeline:
Meta labels
231


This is found in the top left corner of the timeline. These are the names of the meta rows.
Instrument labels
This is found in the bottom left corner of the timeline. These are the names of the rows in the main grid.
Meta rows
This is found in the top right corner of the timeline. These hold the meta values of the score.
Main grid
This is found in the bottom right corner of the timeline. This holds multiple 'cells' (a specific measure and staff in the score
represented as a square)
Meta
Meta are elements found on the score that are not notes, but are still important to the score (key signature, time
signature, tempo, rehearsal marks, bar lines, and jumps and markers).
Basic interaction
Select a measure
To select a measure in the timeline, press the mouse button on the cell. A blue box will appear around the selected cell
and the respective measure in the score will be selected. The score view will place the selected measure in view.
Select multiple measures
Drag selection
Holding Shift and holding the left mouse button and dragging the mouse over the main grid will create a selection box.
Upon releasing the mouse button, all the cells underneath the selection box will be selected, as well as all the measures in
the score.
[Shift] selection
If a cell is already selected, holding 
Shift and selecting another cell in the timeline will stretch the selection to that new cell,
similar to how the score does
[Ctrl] selection
If no cells are currently selected, holding 
Ctrl and selecting a cell will select the entire measure
Clearing selection
To clear selection, holding Ctrl and clicking anywhere on the grid or the meta rows will clear any current selection.
Meta values selection
Selecting the meta values on the timeline will attempt to select the respective meta values in the score.
Scrolling
Standard scrolling
Scrolling the mouse wheel up or down will move the grid and instrument labels down or up respectively. The meta labels
and rows do not move.
[Shift] scrolling
Holding Shift and scrolling the mouse wheel up or down will move the grid and meta rows left or right respectively. The
meta labels and instrument labels do not move.
232


[Alt] scrolling
Holding Alt and scrolling the mouse wheel up or down will move the grid and meta rows left or right respectively, faster
than Shift scrolling. The meta labels and instrument labels do not move.
Dragging
To drag the contents of the timeline, hold the left mouse button and move it around.
Labels interaction
Rearranging meta labels
All meta labels besides the measures meta may be rearranged in any way. By moving the mouse cursor onto one of the
meta labels, small up and down arrows will appear. Click the left mouse button on the up arrow to swap the meta label
with the one above it. Click the left mouse button on the down arrow to swap the meta label with the one below it.
Collapsing the meta labels
In order to hide all the meta labels while keeping all the meta information on the timeline, there is an arrow that appears on
the measures meta when the mouse is over it. Click the left mouse button on the large up arrow to collapse all the
currently visible meta rows into one row, where the meta values are staggered in that row. Click the left mouse button on
the large down arrow to expand the meta rows again.
Hiding instruments
All instruments--hidden or not--will be displayed on the timeline. To start this interaction, the mouse cursor is moved over
an instrument label. A small eye will appear on the right side of the label that is open if the instrument is visible on the
score, and closed if the instrument is hidden. Click the left mouse button on the eye to toggle between the two options.
Zooming
To zoom in or out of the score, hold 
Ctrl and scroll the mouse wheel up or down respectively (Mac: 
Cmd + scroll).
Context menus
To bring up a context menu, right-click on the timeline. There are three context menus found in these locations: meta
labels, instrument labels, and meta rows.
Meta labels context menu
Upon clicking the right mouse button on the meta labels, a context menu appears that displays all possible meta labels as
well as two options: "Hide all" and "Show all." Next to each meta label in the menu, there is a check box that shows if the
meta label is currently being shown on the timeline. To show or hide one of the meta labels, select the box of the meta
label in the context menu. Selecting "Hide all" will hide all meta labels except for the measures meta. Selecting "Show all"
will display all meta labels.
Meta rows context menu
Clicking the right mouse button on the meta rows will display the same context menu as the meta labels.
Instrument context menu
Clicking the right mouse button on the instrument labels will display a context menu with the option to "Edit Instruments."
Selecting this will bring you to the same dialog as Edit > Instruments... or pressing I for the shortcut.
233


Tools
A number of useful commands can be found in the 
Tools menu.
Transpose
This opens the Transpose dialog with various options for transposing passages of music.
See Automatic transposition.
Explode
The explode command allows you to select a passage of music 
in a single staff and split (explode) the chords into their
constituent notes or voices as follows:
If the passage is all in voice 1, the top note of the chord is retained on the top staff, while the lower notes are moved
to subsequent staves.
If the passage contains multiple voices, voice 1 notes are retained on the top staff, while other voices are moved to
subsequent staves. All exploded voices are now in voice 1.
To explode a section of the score:
1. Ensure that there are enough staves underneath the source staff to receive the exploded notes. Create extra staves
if necessary using the Instruments dialog.
2. Choose one of two options:
Select a range of measures in the source staff: this allows all notes to be exploded if there are enough staves
available.
Select a range of measures that includes both the source staff and also extends downwards to include one or
more destination staves: This limits the number of exploded notes/voices to the number of selected staves.
3. Choose Tools→Explode.
Notes: (1) If the selection is all in voice 1, MuseScore will discard the lowest note(s) of any chord that contains more notes
than the number of staves in the selection. (2) If the selection is all in voice 1, and If a given chord has fewer notes than
the number of destination staves, then notes will be duplicated as needed so that every staff receives a note. (3) Any
existing music in the destination staves is overwritten. (4) If you select a partial measure, the explode command will
automatically expand it to a full measure.
Implode
The Implode command works in the opposite way to "explode":
With one staff selected, all notes in voices 1–4 are combined into voice 1.
With multiple staves selected, the notes in the 
second staff are copied to the first available voice in the 
top staff, the
notes in the third staff are copied to the next available voice in the 
top staff and so on.
Apply implode to a single staff
1. Select a range of measures in the desired staff.
2. Choose Tools→Implode.
All selected notes in the staff are now displayed in voice 1.
Apply implode to multiple staves
1. Ensure that there is only one voice in each staff.
2. Select a range of measures in the 
destination staff and extend this selection downwards to include the other staves
to be imploded.
3. Choose Tools→Implode.
Voices
This allows you to swap the voices of a selected measure-range of notes. See 
Exchange voices.
Measure
Join or split measures. See 
Measure operations: Split and join.
Remove selected range
This command is used to completely 
remove an element, or range of elements from the score.
234


To remove measures (including partial measures):
1. Select a range of notes/rests, or a range of measures;
2. Use one of the following methods:
Press Ctrl+Del (Mac: Cmd+Del).
Select Tools→Remove selected range.
Note: If the selected range includes only 
part of a measure, the result will include a measure of smaller duration than the
indicated Time Signature. This is indicated by a small - (minus) sign just above the system.
To join measures:
1. Select (i.e. click on) a barline;
2. Use one of the following methods:
Press Ctrl+Del (Mac: Cmd+Del).
Select Tools→Remove selected range.
The following table is a comparative summary of the 
Delete and Remove selected Range commands when applied to
single elements:

Fill with slashes
This command fills the selection with slashes, one per beat:
1. Select one or more measures;
2. From the menu, select 
Tools→Fill With Slashes.
If a measure is empty the slashes are added to voice 1, full-sized and centered on the middle line of the staff:
Notes: (1) If there are already notes in a measure in the selection, the command will put the slashes into the 
first
available empty voice. (2) Voice 2 slashes are full-sized and centered on the middle line of the staff; voices 3 slashes
appear small and above the staff; voice 4 slashes are 
small and below the staff. (3) If a measure contains notes in all 4
voices, voice 1 will be overwritten. (4) All slashes are set to not transpose or playback.
Toggle rhythmic slash notation
This command toggles selected notes between normal notes and rhythmic slash notation:
1. Select a range of notes or measures (
Note: use the selection filter if you need to exclude certain voices);
2. From the menu, select 
Tools→Toggle Rhythmic Slash Notation.
The selected noteheads are changed to slash noteheads which do not transpose or playback.
Slash-notehead notes in voices one or two are fixed to the middle staff line; those in 
voices three or four are small
("accent" notation) and fixed above or below the staff:
235


In percussion staves, notes in voices 3 and 4 are not converted to small slashes but to small notes above or below the
staff.
Respell pitches
Corrects accidentals to fit in with the current key signature. See 
Accidentals: Respell pitches.
Regroup Rhythms
This option corrects note ties, durations and beaming so that they are grouped according to standard music notation
practice. For example:
Before:
After:
Any notes that are tied and are the same length as a dotted note will be changed to the dotted note with two limitations. (i)
Only the last note of a group of tied notes will have a single dot. Notes with more than one dot are not produced using this
option. (ii) Dotted notes will not span from one group of beamed notes to another unless their duration is the same as all
of the beam groups it covers. Any notes with more than one dot will be regrouped according to the above rules.
To apply:
1. Select the section of the score you want to reset. If nothing is selected, the operation will apply to the whole score;
2. Select Tools→Regroup Rhythms.
Note: This is an experimental feature and there are known bugs. Articulations and ornaments are deleted and some
pitches respelled. Ties across barlines may be lost on UNDO.
Resequence rehearsal marks
The Resequence Rehearsal Marks command allows you to re-order the numbering/lettering of 
rehearsal marks if, for
any reason, they have got out of sequence. For details see Automatically resequence rehearsal marks.
Unroll Repeats (version 3.1 and above)
This command creates a copy of the score (in a new tab), eliminates the 
repeat barlines and notates the repeat sections in
full instead.
Copy lyrics to clipboard
This command copies all the lyrics of the score to the clipboard:
From the menu, select 
Tools→Copy Lyrics to Clipboard.
Image capture
Take a snapshot of a selected part of the document window. PNG, PDF and SVG formats are supported. See 
Image
capture.
Remove empty trailing measures
This automatically removes any blank measures at the end of the score.

Revert to factory settings
MuseScore has the option to revert back to the standard built-in presets or "factory-settings". This can be necessary if
your settings are corrupted. Warning: Reverting to factory settings removes any changes you have made to the
preferences, palettes, or window settings. This is not a commonly needed procedure; consult the forums first, as there
may be a way to solve your problem without resetting everything.
Via menu
If MuseScore still starts, it is possible to revert from within MuseScore.
Go to Help→Revert to Factory Settings. A warning dialog will appear:
Clicking Yes resets all MuseScore's settings as if the program was installed for the first time, and MuseScore will
immediately restart. No will safely cancel the revert.
Via command line
If MuseScore does not start, you must run this process via the 
command line.
237


Instructions for Windows
1. If you have MuseScore open, you need to close it first (
File→Quit)
2. Type ⊞ Win+R to open the Run dialog. Alternatively select "Start" using your mouse and type "run," then click the
"Run" program.
3. Click Browse...
4. Look for MuseScore3.exe on your computer. The location may vary depending on your installation, but it is probably
something similar to My Computer → Local Disk → Program Files → MuseScore 3 → bin → MuseScore3.exe
5. Click Open to leave the Browse dialog and return to the Run dialog. The following text (or something similar) should
display in the Run dialog
C:\Program Files\MuseScore 3\bin\MuseScore3.exe (actually %ProgramFiles%\MuseScore 3\bin\MuseScore3.exe)
For the 32-bit version of MuseScore in a 64-bit version of Windows, the location is
C:\Program Files (x86)\MuseScore 3\bin\MuseScore3.exe (actually %ProgramFiles(x86)%\MuseScore 3\bin\MuseScore3.exe)
For the Windows Store version (Windows 10), it is pretty well hidden, search for it via Windows Explorer
6. Click after the quote and add a space followed by a hyphen and a capital F: 
-F
7. Press OK
After a few seconds, MuseScore should start and all the settings reverted to "factory settings".
For advanced users, the main preference file is located at:
C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\MuseScore\MuseScore3.ini
(actually %APPDATA%\MuseScore\MuseScore3.ini)
The other preferences (palettes, session, shortcuts, workspaces...) are in:
C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\MuseScore\MuseScore3\ (actually %LOCALAPPDATA%\MuseScore\MuseScore3\)
For the Windows Store version (Windows 10), these are pretty well hidden, search for them via Windows Explorer
Instructions for MacOS
1. If you have MuseScore open, you need to quit the application first (
MuseScore→Quit)
2. Open Terminal (in Applications/Utilities, or via Spotlight search) and a session window should appear
3. Type (or copy/paste) the following command into your terminal line (include the '/' at the front):
/Applications/MuseScore\ 3.app/Contents/MacOS/mscore -F
This resets all MuseScore preferences to factory settings and immediately launches the MuseScore application. Note that
you cannot quit the Terminal without quitting MuseScore. You can safely quit MuseScore, quit the Terminal, and then
reopen MuseScore in the normal fashion, ready to continue using.
For advanced users, the main MuseScore preference file is located at 
~/Library/Preferences/org.musescore.MuseScore3.plist.
The other preferences (palettes, session, shortcuts, workspaces...) are in ~/Library/Application\ Support/MuseScore/MuseScore3/.
Instructions for Linux
The following is true for Ubuntu, and most likely all other Linux distributions and UNIX-style operating systems.
1. If you have MuseScore open, you need to quit the application first (
File→Quit)
2. From the Ubuntu main menu, choose 
Applications→Accessories→Terminal. A Terminal session window should appear
3. Type, (or copy/paste) the following command into your terminal line (
Ctrl+Shift+V to paste in Terminal):
mscore -F
Or, if you are using the AppImage version, you must first use the 
cd command to change directory to wherever you
saved the AppImage. For example, if you saved it to your Desktop (and there is only one):
cd ~/Desktop
./MuseScore*.AppImage -F
This resets all MuseScore preferences to factory settings and immediately launches the MuseScore application. You can
now quit Terminal, and continue using MuseScore.
For advanced users, the main MuseScore preference file is located at 
${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-
~/.config}/MuseScore/MuseScore3.ini.

Bug reports and Feature requests
Before filing bug reports or feature requests in the 
Issue Tracker
 it is recommended first to post it in the relevant
Forum
 so others may help establish a bug as genuine, or provide ideas and second opinions for new features.
Include a link to such discussion when creating the Issue.
Bug reports
Before posting in the issue tracker
:
Try to reproduce the issue with 
the latest nightly
. You may also view the 
version history
 to check whether it has
been fixed/implemented already.
Please include as much of the following information as you know and limit each issue to one report:
Version/revision of MuseScore you are using (e.g. version 3.0, revision 
871c8ce
). Check Help → About...
(Mac: MuseScore → About MuseScore...).
Operating system being used (e.g. Windows 10, macOS 10.15 or Ubuntu 20.04)
Describe the precise steps that lead to the problem (where do you click, what keys do you press, what do you
see, etc.).
If you are not able to reproduce the problem with the steps, it is probably not worth reporting it as the
developers will not be able to reproduce (and solve) it either. Remember that the goal of a bug report is not
only to show the problem, but to allow others to reproduce it easily.
Please remember:
Attach the score that shows the problem, at least a minimal example —use the "File attachments" option at the
bottom of the page, just above the Save and Preview buttons when you're typing your post.

.
Batch conversion job JSON format
The argument to the -j option must be the pathname of a file comprised of a valid JSON document honoring the following
specification:
The top-level element must be a JSONArray, which may be empty.
Each array element must be a JSONObject with the following keys:
in: Value is the name of the input file (score to convert), as JSONString.
plugin: Value is the filename of a plugin (with the 
.qml extension), which will be read from either the global or per-
user plugin path and executed before the conversion output happens, as JSONString. Optional, but at least
one of plugin and out must be given.
out: Value is the conversion output target, as defined below. Optional, but at least one of 
plugin and out must be
given.
The conversion output target may be a filename (with extension, which decided the format to convert to), as
JSONString.
The conversion output target may be a JSONArray of filenames as JSONString, as above, which will cause the
score to be written to multiple output files (in multiple output formats) sequentially, without being closed, re-opened
and re-processed in between.
If the conversion output target is a JSONArray, one or more of its elements may also be, each, a JSONArray of two
JSONStrings (called first and second half in the following description). This will cause part extraction: for each such
two-tuple, all extant parts of the score will be saved individually, with filenames being composed by concatenating
the first half, the name (title) of the part, and the second half. The resulting string must be a valid filename (with
extension, determining the output format). If a score has no parts (excerpts) defined, this will be silently ignored
without error.
Valid file extensions for output are:
flac
Free Lossless Audio Codec (compressed audio)
metajson
various score metadata (JSON)
mid
standard MIDI file
midi
245


standard MIDI file
mlog
internal file sanity check log (JSON)
mp3
MPEG Layer III (lossy compressed audio)
mpos
measure positions (XML)
mscx
uncompressed MuseScore file
mscz

musicxml
uncompressed MusicXML file
mxl

ogg
OGG Vorbis (lossy compressed audio)
pdf
portable document file (print)
png
portable network graphics (image) — Individual files, one per score page, with a hyphen-minus followed by the
page number placed before the file extension, will be generated.
spos
segment positions (XML)
svg
scalable vector graphics (image)
wav
RIFF Waveform (uncompressed audio)
xml
uncompressed MusicXML file
See below for an example.
ENVIRONMENT
SKIP_LIBJACK
Set this (the value does not matter) to skip initialization of the JACK Audio Connection Kit library, in case it causes
trouble.
XDG_CONFIG_HOME
User configuration location; defaults to ~/.config if unset.
XDG_DATA_HOME
User data location; defaults to ~/.local/share if unset.
Note that MuseScore also supports the normal Qt environment variables such as 
QT_QPA_GENERIC_PLUGINS,
QT_QPA_PLATFORM, QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME, QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH, QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE, DISPLAY, etc.
FILES
/usr/share/mscore-3.0/ contains the application support data (demos, instruments, localization, system-wide plugins,
soundfonts, styles, chords, templates and wallpapers). In the Debian packages, system-wide soundfonts are installed into
/usr/share/sounds/sf2/, /usr/share/sounds/sf3/ or /usr/share/sounds/sfz/, respectively, instead.
The per-user data (extensions, plugins, soundfonts, styles, templates) and files (images, scores) are normally installed
into subdirectories under ~/MuseScore3/ but may be changed in the configuration. Note that snapshot, alpha and beta
versions use MuseScore3Development instead of MuseScore3 in all of these paths.
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/MuseScore/MuseScore3.ini contains the user preferences, list of recently used files and their locations,
window sizes and positions, etc. See above for development version paths.
$XDG_DATA_HOME/data/MuseScore/MuseScore3/ contains updated localization files downloaded from within the program, plugin
information, cached scores, credentials for the musescore.com community site, session information, synthesizer settings,
custom key and time signatures and shortcuts. See above for development version paths.
EXAMPLES
Convert a score to PDF from the command line
mscore -o 'My Score.pdf' 'My Score.mscz'
Run a batch job converting multiple documents
mscore -j job.json
246


This requires the file 
job.json in the current working directory to have content similar to the following:
[
  {
    "in": "Reunion.mscz",
    "out": "Reunion-coloured.pdf",
    "plugin": "colornotes.qml"
  },
  {
    "in": "Reunion.mscz",
    "out": [
      "Reunion.pdf",
      [ "Reunion (part for ", ").pdf" ],
      "Reunion.musicxml",
      "Reunion.mid"
    ]
  },
  {
    "in": "Piece with excerpts.mscz",
    "out": [
      "Piece with excerpts (Partitura).pdf",
      [ "Piece with excerpts (part for ", ").pdf" ],
      "Piece with excerpts.mid"
    ]
  }
]
The last part of the job would, for example, cause files like “
Piece with excerpts (part for Violin).pdf” to be generated alongside the
conductor’s partitura and a MIDI file with the full orchestra sound, whereas the equivalent part of the Reunion conversion
will be silently ignored (because the Reunion piece (a MuseScore demo) has no excerpts defined).
MIDI import operations
The attached midi_import_options.xml
 is a sample MIDI import operations file for the 
-M option.
DIAGNOSTICS
The mscore utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

STANDARDS
MuseScore attempts to implement the following standards:
MusicXML 3.1 (score interchange format)
SF2 (SoundFont 2.01)
SF3 (SoundFont with OGG Vorbis-compressed samples)
SFZ (Sforzato soundfont)
SMuFL (Standard Music Font Layout 1.20)
HISTORY
247


MuseScore was split off the MusE sequencer in 2002 and has since become the foremost Open Source notation software.
AUTHORS
MuseScore is developed by MuseScore BVBA and others.
This manual page was written by 
mirabilos <tg@debian.org
>.
CAVEATS
The automatic Qt command line options are removed from the argument vector before the application has a chance at
option processing; this means that an invocation like mscore -S -reverse has no chance at working because the 
-reverse is
removed by Qt first.
BUGS
MuseScore does not honor /etc/papersize.
Probably some more; check the project’s bug tracker (cf. 
SEE ALSO).
MuseScore — January 12, 2021
New features in MuseScore 3.6
New score setup and layout features
MuseScore 3.6 introduces a new music font, Leland, a new default text font, Edwin (a version of New Century
Schoolbook), and many new default settings. It also introduces a number of new features which are available in all newly-
created scores by default, and which can also be applied automatically or manually to existing scores.
The three main features, which are interrelated, are:
Automatic instrument ordering
Automatic brackets and braces
Vertical justification of staves
The first two features apply at score creation time and are available in the New Score Wizard, though they can also be
accessed later in the Instruments panel. Previously, it was up to the user to arrange instruments and add brackets
manually once the score was created. The aim of these new features is to save time and give a better default result in the
majority of cases, but it is not intended to accommodate every possible score setup. For unusual layouts, the results can
be customised after the score is created, the features can be turned off completely, or a template could be used.
Automatic instrument ordering
248


When creating a new score via 'Choose Instruments', there is now an 'Ordering' dropdown showing the current system of
instrument ordering. 'Orchestral' is the default. As instruments are added to the score, they will be added in the correct
position according to the select ordering. (Previously, each instrument would appear below whichever was currently
selected in the right-hand list.) This also makes it easy to, for instance, add a double wind section, by selecting Flute,
Oboe, Clarinet and Bassoon in the left-hand list, and clicking 'Add to score' twice.
Each ordering defines a position in the score for solo instruments. For example, in an orchestral ordering, this is above the
strings. With an instrument selected in the right-hand list, the 'Make soloist' button will move it to that position. You can
designate multiple soloists; within the soloist 'section' the overall ordering will apply. Solo instruments will have "solo"
added to their name by default, and will be numbered separately from non-solo instruments, where relevant. Note that the
soloist designation is a score layout feature only and has no impact on playback.
One quirk is that, for now, only a single soloist position is defined per ordering, so a work with a chorus plus both vocal
and instrumental soloists will place the instrumental soloists above the chorus. These will need to be moved manually.
As before, instruments can be moved up and down manually with the buttons that are now to the right of the list. In the
dropdown the ordering will have '(Customised)' appended to its name. The customised ordering is saved with the score.
You can reset the order by selecting the original ordering (or a different one) from the dropdown.
Selecting the 'Custom' ordering disables this feature entirely, as well as the automatic bracketing.
Automatic brackets and braces
The predefined ordering assigns instrument families (flutes, oboes, clarinets, etc.) and arranges those families into
sections (woodwind, brass, percussion, etc.). Brackets are added automatically according to these simple rules:
A heavy bracket is applied to all adjacent instruments of the same section, assuming there is more than one
a thin square bracket is applied to all adjacent identical instruments (four horns, for example)
a curly brace is applied to each single instrument which is notated on more than one stave (piano and harp, most
commonly)
Again, while this should provide reasonable defaults for most scores, it won't give perfect results for every possible style or
layout. Fortunately, it is easy to make adjustments once the score is created.
Vertical justification of staves
There is a new algorithm for vertically justifying staves to properly fill the page, which is turned on by default for new
scores in MuseScore 3.6. To turn this off, untick Format > Style > Page > Enable vertical justification of staves.
The basic principle of the algorithm is to try to make the space between staves equal, subject to two settings (all in
249


Format > Style > Page):
The space either side of a system may be increased proportionally by adjusting the "Factor for distance above/below
bracket" setting to a value greater than 1. For example, if this is set to 1.5, the algorithm will attempt to make the
space either side of a bracket 1.5 times the 'standard' space used elsewhere.
The same thing can be applied to braces with the "Factor for distance above/below brace" setting.
The space between a brace and bracket will be determined by the larger of these two values. The "Max. great staff
distance" setting is used to limit the amount of distance between staves joined by a curly brace. This is useful as these
staves generally need to be read at once in a single glance by the player.
The "Max. system distance" and "Max. stave distance" should have reasonably large values to enable the routine to fill
even quite sparse pages. Sometimes a page will not have enough staves for it to make sense to justify. In this case, once
the algorithm first equalises the space as described above, it then adds extra space between the staves up to a maximum
of the setting given in "Max. page fill distance" (multiplied by any relevant factor setting). If you find many pages are not
fully justified, but you'd like them to be, try adjusting this setting. In general, a low value is likely to be best for a score with
a small number of staves per system, and a larger one for larger numbers of staves.
The vertical justification is dynamic, and not tied to the section assignments of instruments used to determine the score
order at the setup stage, so if you add or remove brackets the spacing will change accordingly. In the same way, if empty
staves are hidden on a given system, the spacing will be determined only by the brackets which are present on that
system.
Hopefully the default settings give good results in most cases, but it might take a bit of experimentation with the settings
depending on the makeup of a score. If you are used to using spacers to achieve similar results, it is best to try to find
settings which give a good result for the majority of the score, and use spacers only where local adjustments are
necessary. It is planned for future versions to make this more configurable. For example, extra space could be suppressed
for a specific bracket, or the value might be increased or decreased for a particular page or system.
Indentation of first systems
This new option, which is turned on by default, is found in Style > Score > Enable indentation on first system. As the name
suggests, it will indent the first system of a section in the customary way for classical scores. (The old workaround of using
a frame for this is no longer necessary.) If there are instrument labels present, the maximum of either the value given for
this setting or the length of the labels will apply.
Applying new features to existing scores
When opening an old score, a dialog box gives the option to apply either the new notation font Leland, or the new text font
Edwin, or both. Each of these applies a subset of the new default 3.6 style settings beyond just the font changes, for
example, line widths and text sizes, but does not apply every one of the the new defaults, in the interest of minimising
disruptive layout changes.
250


To apply all of the new defaults, including these text and notation font changes, open the Format > Style window and click
the "Reset All Styles to Default" button at the bottom. This was formerly the Format > Reset Style menu option. The button
behaves the same way, except that it no longer resets the page layout options which are set in the Format > Page
Settings window; that window now has its own equivalent button, which will reset only those settings it contains. This
means that the new style options can be tried out without completely ruining the layout of the score, though a few settings
in the Score and Page settings of the Style window may need to be re-set manually.
If it is an option, delete any non-essential system and page breaks, then select the whole score and select Format >
Stretch > Reset Layout Stretch. Also delete spacers if you want to see the default results of the new vertical justification
algorithm (see below).
Edwin has wider character sizes in general than FreeSerif (though slightly smaller default point sizes are used) so it is
quite likely that the Edwin option will cause layout changes, particularly in scores with lyrics. Leland will affect the spacing
less radically, but some adjustments may still be necessary.
Text items which have local style overrides applied will not have those customisations removed, either as part of the score
migration process, or via the Reset Styles options. This may result in an inconsistent score where some text retains its old
font face or size. The new menu option Format > Reset Text Style Overrides will remove these customisations, resetting
all text items to match the currently defined text styles. (This is equivalent to clicking 'Reset to style default' for each
attribute in the Text area of the Inspector.) Note that this does not remove Custom Formatting, which must be done
manually if required.
Applying new automatic instrument ordering and bracketing
Press I to open the Instruments panel, or choose the Edit > Instruments menu item. Assuming the score was created pre-
3.6, the selected ordering will be 'Custom'. If you wish to apply a standard ordering, select one from the menu, for
example 'Orchestral'. The instruments in the score will be reordered according to that definition, and have brackets and
braces applied accordingly. Note that any existing brackets and braces will be deleted.
Applying vertical justification of staves
If you want to use this feature but have previously been using spacers to create extra or fixed distance between staves, it
would be best to delete all those spacers first, as they will distort how the new algorithm works. A quick way to do this is
by right-clicking any spacer, choosing Select > All Similar Elements, and pressing Delete.
Turn this feature on by selecting Style > Page > Enable vertical justification of staves. Then you can reintroduce spacers if
there are specific places where the default spacing needs adjustment.
Other engraving changes in 3.6
251


In the process of investigating style settings, engraving issues, and creating a new music font, many issues were
uncovered which needed to be corrected and which may have a small impact on the appearance of existing scores. In
some cases it is possible to undo these manually.
Beam spacing
A long-standing error in the interpretation of the beamDistance setting that is defined alongside SMuFL fonts meant that
this value was frequently half as big as it ought to be in MuseScore, including with Emmentaler and Bravura. (MuseScore
defines the distance between beams as a percentage of the thickness of a beam, but for SMuFL the setting is an absolute
distance in stave spaces. The normal thickness of a beam is 0.5sp, and the standard distance between beams is also
0.25sp, which MuseScore interpreted as 25% of 0.5sp, i.e. 0.125sp.)
The new correct interpretation of this value, 50%, will be applied even to existing scores, unless this value had been
explicitly overridden. The extra space is added inwards, so the position of the outermost beams remains the same. If you
really want the old, very-tight spacing, set Style > Beams > Beam distance manually to 25%.
Before (beam distance 25%):
After (beam distance 50%):
Ledger line length
In a similar way, MuseScore interpreted this SMuFL value as the total extension of the ledger line beyond the notehead
(i.e. x/2 at each side), when the value is meant to be the extension at each side. This error was also masked by a square
cap being used for the line, rather than a straight cap, thus also adding half of the line thickness at each end.
As with beam spacing, if this setting was not explicitly overridden in the file, a new default will be applied even in old
scores, but this will give identical results. If you did adjust this value, this value will be preserved, but will produce ledger
lines that are too long. You can convert the value manually with the formula:
new value = (x / 2) - (
y / 2)
where x is the previous 'Ledger line length' value, and 
y is the 'Ledger line thickness' value. Or, just use the now correctly-
interpreted default settings for each font:
Leland: 0.35sp
Bravura, Gonville, Petaluma: 0.40sp
Emmentaler: 0.38sp
Stem caps and flag positions
Round caps were previously drawn on stems. This has been replaced with a flat cap. Partly this is to make the length of
the stem more exact, but mainly it is so that the round cap does not obscure the design of the tip of the flag symbols in
each font. Emmentaler's flags, for instance, are designed with a flat tip; Bravura and Leland have rounded tips which are
not exactly symmetrical.
The placement of flags was also previously at odds with SMuFL fonts: a calculation was made of how much to extend the
stem for a given number of flags, and then the flag symbol was drawn with the top or bottom of its bounding box at the
end of the stem. Now, the presence of flags does not affect stem length (i.e. a normal length stem is used for a note
according to its vertical position and stem direction) and the flag symbol is then placed with its y=0 at the end of the stem.
Any 'extension' of the stem is thus determined by the extent to which the flag symbol extends above or below y=0. The
flags in Emmentaler, as used within MuseScore, have been repositioned to reflect this, and to match other SMuFL fonts.
252


The result of this is that flags may appear slightly lower or higher than they did previously; however, their positioning now
reflects the intentions of the designers of each of the available fonts. Beamed notes are not affected.
Before (Bravura, in 3.5):
After (Bravura, in 3.6):
Bracketed accidentals
Previously MuseScore did not add any space between the bounding boxes of accidentals and brackets around them. Now
a small amount of padding is added, which can be customised via Style > Accidentals > Padding inside parentheses.
Before (Bravura, in 3.5):
After (Bravura, in 3.6):
Accidentals in Emmentaler
These have been replaced with those taken from Parnassus. For details, see

New features in MuseScore 3
MuseScore 3 includes a number of new and improved features. For a brief summary, see the 
Release notes for
MuseScore 3
. More details can be found in the summaries below and by referring to the relevant pages of the
handbook.
Automatic Placement
MuseScore initially places elements in the score according to (a) the properties specified in 
style defaults and (b) any
manual adjustments made. For elements that have automatic placement enabled, however, MuseScore will attempt to
avoid collisions by moving one or more of them as needed.
See Automatic placement.
Default position
The default position for most elements is controlled by settings in 
Format → Style. You can either change the default
253


there, or, in the Inspector, apply a manual adjustment (see below) and then use the "Set as style" control (the S to the
right of the value you wish to set).
The specific properties you can set vary by element type but include:
placement (whether the element appears above or below the staff by default)
position above/below (specific positions when placed above or below)
offset (same as position above/below, for which placement is the default)
autoplace min distance (minimum distance from other elements when autoplace is enabled)
See Automatic placement.
Manual adjustments
Many elements can be placed either above or below the staff. To flip an element from above to below or vice versa, use
the "Placement" setting in the Inspector, or press the shortcut "X".
Manual adjustments to position can be performed by dragging or by changing the offsets in the Inspector. Neither method
will allow you to position an element in a way that causes a collision, however. To take full control of the position of an
element, you can disable automatic placement for it.
See Automatic placement.
Disabling automatic placement
To disable automatic placement for an element, untick the "Automatic placement" box in the Inspector. The element will
revert to its default position, and it will no longer be considered when automatically placing other elements.
See Automatic placement.
Stacking order
The "Stacking order" setting in the Inspector controls which elements overlap which in the cases where they actually do
overlap and are not moved due to autoplacement.
See Automatic placement.
Text Formatting
Formatting of text is controlled by three factors:
The text style associated with the element sets the defaults for properties such as the font, alignment, and frame.
Changes to these text properties can be applied to selected elements via the Inspector.
Custom formatting can be applied to specific characters within the text using the text toolbar.
See Text basics, Text styles and properties.
Text Styles
Each text element has a text style associated with it. The default style for an element is determined by the type of the
element itself - staff text defaults to the Staff text style, dynamics to the Dynamics text style, etc. This text style determines
the default font face, size, style (bold/italic/underline), alignment, and frame properties.
You can change the defaults for any of these text styles using 
Format → Style → Text Styles. For instance, you can make
rehearsal marks bigger, or change lyrics to be italicized. This will affect all existing elements using that style as well as
elements you add later. Some elements also contain a limited set of text style controls in their own sections of the Format
→ Style dialog (although this might not be the case in the final release). The settings are linked: you can change the font
size for measure numbers in either Format → Style → Measure Numbers, or in Format → Style → Text Styles: Measure
Number. The effect is the same: all measure numbers in the score will take on this size. You can also change the defaults
for a text style using the Inspector; see Text Properties below.
For most text elements that you create directly (like staff text, rehearsal marks, and lyrics), you can apply a different text
style using the Style control in the Inspector. This will cause them to display using that style instead of the "native" style for
the element. For example, you can select one or more staff text elements and give them the Tempo style to force them to
display as if they were tempo markings.
See Text basics, Text styles and properties.
Text Properties
The text style controls the default properties for elements using that style, but you can override any of these properties for
selected elements using the Inspector. For example, you can select a handful of staff text elements using Ctrl+click, then
254


use the Inspector to make them larger. The Reset to Default button next to each property control returns it to the default.
You can also click the Set as Style button to change the style to match. So another way to change the size of all
measures numbers is to select one, change its size in the Inspector, then click Set as Style.
See Text basics, Text styles and properties.
Custom Formatting
Custom formatting is applied to text using the 
toolbar at the bottom of the main window in the same manner as in previous
releases. Thus, you can embolden one word in a sentence while the rest is normal, or superscript a particular character
etc. You can also remove all custom formatting from select text elements using the "Remove Custom Formatting" button
in the Inspector. This returns the text to the settings currently shown in the Inspector.
See Text editing.
Staff Type Change
You can change various staff properties mid-score, including staff size, notehead scheme (e.g., for pitch name
noteheads), generation of time signatures, and others. The staff type change element is found on the Text palette
(currently, but see #278205: Move Staff Type Change to another palette (it is not text)
 - it may move). Add it to the
measure where you want the change to occur, then use the Inspector to change properties of the staff type change
element.
See Staff Type Change
Temporary and Cutaway Staves
To create a temporary staff that appears on certain systems only: first add the staff normally (Edit / Instruments), then add
notes, then right-click the staff, click Staff Properties, and set "Hide when empty" to "Always". This will cause the staff to
show only where needed even without needing to turn on "Hide empty staves" for the whole score (in Format / Style). The
default for "Hide when empty" is "Auto", meaning the staff will be hidden when empty if "Hide empty staves" is enabled.
Additional values include "Never" (the staff will not be hidden when empty even if "Hide empty staves" is enabled) and
"Instrument" (for instruments containing multiple staves, the staff is hidden only if all staves for that instrument are empty).
To create a cutaway staff in which only the measures containing notes are visible (for ossia or cutaway scores, for
example), right-click the staff, click Staff Properties, and enable the "Cutaway" option. This can be used independently of
"Hide when empty" or "Hide empty staves".
System Dividers
System dividers are a set of short diagonal lines that are used to visually separate systems on a page. MuseScore can
add these to your score automatically. In Format → Style → System, you can enable dividers on the left, right, or both,
and you can set their default position. You can also adjust the position of individual dividers in your score manually or
mark them invisible (this currently does not survive saving).
Staff Spacing
As part of the automatic placement in MuseScore, staves are now spaced automatically, so you can set a comfortable
minimum distance and depend on MuseScore to open up more space where needed. You can use staff spacers as in
MuseScore 2 to increase distance between staves, but MuseScore 3 now also provides a way to 
decrease it—the "fixed"
staff spacer, found on the Breaks & Spacers palette. Just add the spacer and adjust its height. This will also prevent
MuseScore from automatically adding more space to avoid collisions, allowing you to manage this yourself.
See Spacers.
Don't Break
Currently disabled
In addition to the system, page, and section breaks familiar from MuseScore 2, the "Breaks & Spacers" palette now
contains a new "Don't Break" element. This allows you to force two measures to be kept together, for example, if there is
some complex passage that spans the measures and you want to make sure they are adjacent. If both measures don't fit
on a system, MuseScore moves them both to the next system. (currently, this leaves a "hole" at the end of the first staff -
is this a bug or is there some purpose behind it?)
Parts from Voices
In addition to the ability to generate 
parts from the different instruments in your score, you can now also associate a part
with a specific staff within the instrument or even a specific voice within a specific staff. This allows you to combine
multiple parts (e.g., Flute 1 & 2) onto a single staff in the score while still generating separate parts.
255


The Parts dialog now contains two sections at the bottom, Instruments in Score and Instruments in Part. Once you have
generated a part (or all parts) using the New and New All buttons, you can select any part at the top and use the controls
at the bottom to control not only what instrument is in the part, but also which staves and voices within the instrument are
included.
To add an instrument to a part, select it from "Instruments in Score" and press "+". To remove an instrument from a part,
select it from "Instruments in Part" and press "-". To customize the part at the staff or voice level, click the arrow next to
the instrument in "Instruments in Part" to expand the listing to show all staves and voices of the instrument. You can
remove a staff by selecting it and pressing "-", or remove a voice by unchecking it.
Limitations: If you select only voice 1 for a given staff, then only the content in voice 1 for that staff will be included in the
part. Thus, in order to share flute 1 & 2 on the same staff, you will need to enter all notes onto both voices, even in
passages where they share content. You also cannot enter the two parts as chords in the passages where they share
rhythms.
Explode and Implode
Explode has been updated to allow separation of voices as well as notes. See 
Explode.
The implode tool (Tools / Implode) works in one of two modes.
With a single staff selected, the implode command merges notes in different voices into chords where possible (when
notes are on the same beat and have the same duration). This is the same as recent versions of MuseScore, although
some bugs have been fixed.
With multiple staves selected, the implode command combines the content of the first four non-empty voices (on any
staves) into multiple voices on the top selected staff. This is different from MuseScore 2, where notes would be combined
into chords rather than using multiple voices, and thus required the rhythms to match. The MuseScore 3 approach
preserves the original rhythms even where they differ, and is intended to produce the expected results when combining
two different parts onto one staff for use with the parts from voices feature, or when reducing an open (four-stave) SATB
score into a closed (two-stave) version. To further merge the voices into chords where possible, simply run the command
again.
See Tools.
Insert mode
You can insert and delete notes and have the measure automatically expand or contract to accommodate the change.
This can be useful in creating unmetered music or in ordinary editing.
To insert a note before the currently-selected note, press 
Ctrl+Shift while adding the note normally. For example, in note
input mode, Ctrl+Shift+click will insert a note of the currently-selected duration at that location. Ctrl+Shift+B will insert a B of
the currently-selected duration before the note at the current cursor position. You can also switch to Insert mode using the
dropdown menu next to the note input button on the toolbar. In this mode, all notes you add act as if you were pressing
Ctrl+Shift - they are inserted rather than replacing the existing notes or rests at that location.
To delete notes, you must be in normal (not note input) mode. Select either a single note or a range and press Ctrl+Del.
See Note input modes, Remove selected range (Tools)
Split/Join Measures
To split a measure before a given note, simply insert a barline from the palette at that point while holding 
Ctrl. For example,
you can select the note, and Ctrl+double-click the barline in the palette, or 
Ctrl+drag the barline to the note. You can also
use Tools → Measure → Split Measure Before Selected Note/Rest.
To join two measures, Ctrl+Del the barline between them. You can also use the menu command Tools → Measure → Join
Measures.
See Measure operations.
Timeline
The Timeline presents a graphical overview of your score. To access it, use View →Timeline (F12). The top portion of the
Timeline shows the location of tempo, key, and time signature changes as well as rehearsal marks, repeats, and double
barlines. The bottom portion shows the staves of your score, with non-empty measures highlighted. You can click
anywhere within this view to jump to the corresponding spot in the score.
See Timeline
Score Comparison Tool
256


The Score Comparison Tool (View / Score Comparison Tool) allows you to compare two versions of a score to find the
differences between them. Select the two scores you want to compare and whether you want to compare the current
version or the last saved version (note you can compare the current version of a score against the last saved version of
the same score to see what you have changed since the last save), then click the Compare button. A list of differences
will be displayed to the right. The score view will automatically change to Documents Side by Side, with the two scores
you have selected displayed within. Double-click on a difference from the list and both score views will automatically pan
to show you the changed element, which will also be highlighted.
Normally you would want the default Intelligent comparison, which displays the differences in human-readable format (e.g.
"Measure 1: Note: property pitch changed from B4 to C5"). There is also a Raw mode to show the results according to the
actual XML code.
See Score comparison.
Mixer
See Mixer.
Piano Roll Editor
See Piano roll editor (preliminary page).
Capo changes
Capo changes are now a property of staff text, and can be used to automatically change the pitch of all notes that follow
them, up until another capo change.
See Capo playback.

Release notes for MuseScore 3.x
Transitioning from version 2 to version 3
Known limitations of MuseScore 3.x
While all members of the development team did their best to make the software easy to use and bug-free, there are some
known issues and limitations in MuseScore 3.x.
Local time signatures
The local time signature feature, which allows you to have different time signatures in different staves at the same time, is
very limited. You can only add a local time signature to measures that are empty, and only if there are no linked parts.
When adding notes to measures with local time signatures, you can enter notes normally via note input mode, but copy
and paste does not work correctly and may lead to corruption or even crashes. The join and split commands are disabled
for measures with local time signatures.
Regroup Rhythms
The Regroup Rhythms command found under the Tools menu may have unintended side effects, including changing the
spelling of pitches and deleting some elements like articulations, glissandos, tremolos, grace notes and, esp. on undo,
ties. Use this tool with caution on limited selections, so that you can tell if any unwanted changes are made.
Tablature staff linked with standard staff
When entering multiple-note chords on a standard staff in a 
linked staff/tablature system, the notes should be entered in
order from the top (first) string to the bottom string
 to ensure correct fret assignment.
This limitation does not apply if entering notes directly onto a tablature staff, or when using an 
unlinked staff/tablature
system.
Mixer
Changing settings in the mixer other than the sound doesn't mark the score 'dirty'. That means if you close a score you
may not get the warning "Save changes to the score before closing?". Changing mixer values are also not undoable.
257


Header & footer
There is no way to edit Header and Footer in a WYSIWYG manner. The fields in Format → Style → Header, Footer are
plain text. They can contain "HTML like" syntax, but the text style, layout, etc. can't be edited with a WYSIWYG editor.
Upgrade from MuseScore 1.x or 2.x
How to upgrade MuseScore
Download and install the latest version from the 
download
 page as described at Installation.
Installing MuseScore 3 won't uninstall 1.x nor 2.x —all three versions can coexist peacefully and can even be used in
parallel. So this isn't really an upgrade but an installation of a new and different program.
Opening 1.x or 2.x scores in MuseScore 3
MuseScore 3 significantly improved the typesetting quality to make scores attractive and easier to read. Improvements
cover many items such as beam slope, stem height, layout of accidentals in chords and general note spacing. However,
this means that sheet music made with MuseScore 1.x or 2.x looks slightly different from sheet music made with 3.x.
It also means that scores saved with 3.x won't open with 1.x nor 2.x.
To prevent you from accidentally overwriting your 1.x or 2.x scores, 3.x treats them as an import, which means:
The score gets marked as being modified, even if you haven't changed anything
On exiting MuseScore you're asked to save the score (as a result from the above)
MuseScore uses the "Save As" dialog to save it, not the "Save" dialog
MuseScore uses the score's title to create a default filename rather than taking the old filename
Relayout
If you did not manually adjust the layout of a 1.x or 2.x score, then MuseScore uses the 3.x typesetting engine to layout
the score. If you did touch the layout of the 1.x or 2.x score, the individual adjustments you may have made should remain
after opening it in MuseScore 3.x, but due to slight changes in the surrounding layout they may still not appear correct in
context. If you wish to reset even manual adjustments to use the 3.x typesetting engine throughout, select the complete
score with the shortcut Ctrl+A (Mac: Cmd+A) and reset the layout with 
Ctrl+R (Mac: Cmd+R).
Note: When you open a 1.x or 2.x file in MuseScore 3, it will ask you if you want to reset the layout to the defaults.
Getting the sound from MuseScore 1.x
While the sound in 2.x/3.x has been much improved, you may still prefer the sound from MuseScore 1.x. In that case, you
can get the 1.x sound in 3.x by downloading the 1.3 SoundFont and add it in 3.x. You can do this in two steps:
1. Download the 1.3 SoundFont named TimGM6mb
2. Install and use the TimGM6mb SoundFont in 2.0

AVG Internet Security hangs MuseScore
MuseScore requires access to your internet connection with AVG. MuseScore doesn't need an internet connection to
function, but if AVG blocks it, MuseScore hangs.
If AVG prompts you, Allow MuseScore and check "Save my answer as a permanent rule and do not ask me next time."
If it doesn't prompt you anymore,
1. Open the AVG user interface (right-click on the AVG icon, close to your clock -> Open AVG User Interface)
2. Click on Firewall
3. Click Advanced Settings
4. Click Applications
5. Find MSCORE.EXE in the list and double-click it
6. Change Application Action to Allow for All
Font problem on macOS
MuseScore is known to display notes as square when some fonts are damaged on macOS.
To troubleshoot this issue:
1. Go to Applications -> Font Book
2. Select a font and press 
⌘+A to select them all
3. Go to File -> Validate Fonts
4. If any font is reported as damaged or with minor problems, select it and delete it
5. Restart MuseScore if necessary
In this forum article
, a user believes to have found the font "Adobe Jenson Pro (ajenson)" to be the culprit, regardless of
not being reported as broken, or problematic as per the above validation, and solved the problem by deleting that font, so
this is worth checking too.
Font problem on Linux
If the default desktop environment application font is set to bold, MuseScore will not display the notes properly.
To troubleshoot this issue (gnome 2.*/MATE users):
1. Right-click on your desktop and select Change Desktop background
2. Click on Fonts tab
3. Set Regular style for Application font
4. Restart MuseScore if necessary
For GNOME 3/SHELL users
1. Open the shell and open "Advanced Settings"
2. Click on the Fonts option in the list
3. Set the default font to something non-bold
4. Restart MuseScore if necessary
Save As dialog empty on Linux
Some users reported that the Save As dialog is empty on Debian 6.0 and Lubuntu 10.10.
To troubleshoot this issue:
1. Type the following in a terminal
which mscore
2. The command will answer with the path of mscore. Edit it with your preferred text editor and add the following line at
the beginning
export QT_NO_GLIB=1
Launch MuseScore and the problem should be solved.
Glossary
The glossary is a work in progress—please help if you can. You can discuss this page in the 
documentation forum
.
The list below is a glossary of frequently used terms in MuseScore as well as their meaning. The differences between
American English and British English are marked with "(AE)" and "(BE)", respectively.
A
259


Acciaccatura
 A short →grace note which appears as a small note with a stroke through the stem. It is quickly executed and
technically takes no value from its associated note.
Accidental
A sign appearing in front of a note that raises or lowers its pitch. The most common accidentals are →
sharps, →flats
or →naturals, but double sharps and double flats are also used. Also →
koron, and →sori and other quarter tone
accidentals. Accidentals affect all notes on the same →staff position only for the remainder of the measure in which
they occur, but they can be canceled by another accidental. In notes tied across a →barline, the accidental
continues across the →barline to the tied note, but not to later untied notes on the same →
staff position in that
measure.
Ambitus
Note (or vocal) range used in a →staff. Used particularly in 
Early Music
Anacrusis
See →Pickup measure.
Anchor
The point of attachment to the score of objects such as Text and Lines: When the object is dragged, the anchor
appears as small brown circle connected to the object by a dotted line. Depending on the object selected, its anchor
may be attached to either (a) a note (e.g. fingering), (b) a staff line (e.g. staff text), or (c) a barline (e.g. repeats).
Appoggiatura
A long →grace note which takes value from its associated note. Its functions include: passing tone, anticipation,
struck suspension, and escape tone.
Arpeggio
An arpeggio tells the performer to break up the chord into the constituent notes, playing them separately and one
after the other. An arrow on the arpeggio indicates the direction in which the player should play the notes of the
chord.
B
Bar (BE)
See →measure.
Barline
Vertical line through a →staff, staves, or a full →
system that separates →measures.
Beam
Notes with a duration of an →
eighth
 or shorter either carry a →flag or a beam. Beams are used for grouping
notes.
BPM
Beats Per Minute is the unit for measuring tempo, traditionally counted in quarter note durations. See →
metronome
mark
Breve
Brevis
A double whole note or breve is a note that has the duration of two whole notes.

A caesura (//) is a brief, silent pause. Time is not counted for this period, and music resumes when the director
signals.
Cent
An interval equal to one hundredth of a semitone.
Chord
A group of two or more notes sounding together. To select a chord in MuseScore, press 
Shift and click on a note. In
the Inspector, however, the word "Chord" only covers notes in the same voice as the selected note(s).
Clef
Sign at the beginning of a →
staff, used to tell which are the musical notes 
on the lines and between the lines.
Clefs are very useful for →transposition.
260


Concert pitch
Enables you to switch between concert pitch and transposing pitch (see 
Concert pitch and Transposition).
Crotchet (BE)
See →Quarter note.
D
Double Flat
A double flat (♭♭ or ) is a sign that indicates that the pitch of a note has to be lowered two semitones.
Double Sharp
A double sharp (♯♯ or ) is a sign that indicates that the pitch of a note has to be raised two semitones.
Demisemiquaver (BE)
A thirty-second note.
Duplet

Dynamic
A symbol indicating the relative loudness of a note or phrase of music—such as 
mf (mezzoforte), p (piano), f (forte)
etc., starting at that note.
Dynamic, Single note
A dynamic marking which applies only to one note—such as sfz (sforzando), fp (fortepiano) etc.
E
Edit mode
The program mode from which you can edit various score elements.
Eighth note
A note whose duration is an eighth of a whole note (semibreve). Same as a quaver (BE).
Endings
See →volta.
Enharmonic notes
Notes that sound the same pitch but are written differently. Example: G♯ and A♭ are enharmonic notes.
F
Flag
See →beam.
Flat
Sign (♭) that indicates that the pitch of a note has to be lowered one semitone.
G
Grace note
Grace notes appear as small notes in front of a normal-sized main note. See →
acciaccatura and →appoggiatura.
Grand Staff (AE)
Great Stave (BE)
A system of two or more staves, featuring treble and bass clefs, used to notate music for keyboard instruments and
the harp.
H
Half Note
A note whose duration is half of a whole note (semibreve). Same as a minim (BE).
Hemidemisemiquaver (BE)
A sixty-fourth note.
I
Interval
The difference in pitch between two notes, expressed in terms of the scale degree (e.g. major second, minor third,
perfect fifth etc.). See Degree (Music)

Jump
In MuseScore, "jumps" are notations such as "D.S. al Coda", found in the "Repeats & Jumps" palette.
K
Key Signature
Set of →sharps or →flats at the beginning of the →
staves. It gives an idea about the tonality and avoids repeating
261


those signs all along the →staff.
A key signature with B flat means F major or D minor tonality.
Koron
An Iranian →accidental which lowers the pitch of a note by a quarter tone (in comparison to the →
flat which lowers a
note by a semitone). It is possible to use this accidental in a →key signature.
See also →Sori.
L
Longa
A longa is a quadruple whole note.
Ledger Line
Line(s) that are added above or below the staff.
M
Measure (AE)
A segment of time defined by a given number of beats. Dividing music into measures provides regular reference
points to pinpoint locations within a piece of music. Same as → bar (BE).
Metronome mark
Metronome marks are usually given by a note length equaling a certain playback speed in →
BPM. In MuseScore,
metronome marks are used in Tempo texts.
Minim (BE)
See →Half note.
N
Natural
A natural (♮) is a sign that cancels a previous alteration on notes of the same pitch.
Normal mode
The operating mode of MuseScore outside note input mode or edit mode: press Esc to enter it. In 
Normal mode you
can navigate through the score, select and move elements, adjust Inspector properties, and alter the pitches of
existing notes.
Note input mode
The program mode used for entering music notation.
O
Operating System
OS

P
Part
Music to be played or sung by one or a group of musicians using the same instrument. In a string quartet, 1st part =
Violin 1, 2nd part = Violin 2, 3rd part = Viola, 4th part = Cello, in a choir there might be parts for soprano, alto, tenor
and bass. A part has one or more →staves (e.g. Piano has 2 staves, Organ can have 2 or 3 staves).
Pickup Measure (also known as an Anacrusis or Upbeat)
Incomplete first measure of a piece or a section of a piece of music. See Measure duration and Create new score:
Pickup measure. Also Exclude from measure count.

Respell Pitches
Tries to guess the right accidentals for the whole score (see Accidentals).
Rest
262


Interval of silence of a specified duration.
Re-pitch mode
Allows you to rewrite an existing passage of music by changing the note pitches without altering the rhythm.
S
Semibreve (BE)
A whole note (AE). It lasts a whole measure in 4/4 time.
Semiquaver (BE)
A sixteenth note.
Semihemidemisemiquaver (Quasihemidemisemiquaver) (BE)
An hundred and twenty eighth note.
Sextuplet
See →tuplet.
Slash chord
See Slash chord
 (Wikipedia).
Slash notation
A form of music notation using slash marks placed on or above/below the staff to indicate the rhythm of an
accompaniment: often found in association with chord symbols. There are two types: (1) Slash notation consists of a
rhythm slash on each beat: the exact interpretation is left to the player (see Fill with slashes); (2) Rhythmic slash
notation indicates the precise rhythm for the accompaniment (see 
Toggle rhythmic slash notation).
SFZ
A virtual instrument format supported by MuseScore (along with →
SoundFonts). An SFZ library consists of one or
more SFZ text files, each defining a particular instrument setup, and many audio sound samples.
Sharp
Sign (♯) that indicates that the pitch of a note has to be raised one semitone.
Slur
A curved line over or under two or more notes, meaning that the notes will be played smooth and connected
(legato).
See also →tie.
Sori
An Iranian →accidental which raises the pitch of a note by a quarter tone (in comparison to the sharp which raises it
by a semitone). It is possible to use this accidental in a →key signature.
See also →Koron.
SoundFont
A virtual instrument format supported by MuseScore (along with →
SFZ). A SoundFont is a special type of file
(extension .sf2, or .sf3 if compressed) containing sound samples of one or more musical instruments. In effect, a
virtual synthesizer which acts as a sound source for MIDI files. MuseScore 2.2 comes with the SoundFont
"MuseScore_General.sf3" pre-installed.
Spatium (plural: Spatia) / Space / Staff Space / sp. (abbr./unit)
The distance between the midpoints of two lines of a music staff (or one-quarter the size of the full five-line staff,
assuming a hypothetical staff line thickness of 0). The sizes of most elements in the score are based on this setting
(see Page settings).
Staff (AE) / Staves (plural)
A set of lines and spaces, each representing a pitch, on which music is written. In ancient music notation (before
11th century) the staff may have any number of lines.
Staff Space
See Spatium (above).
Stave (BE)
See Staff (above).
Step-time input
MuseScore's default note input mode, allowing you to enter music notation one note (or rest) at a time.
System
Set of staves to be read simultaneously in a score.
See also →Operating System (OS).
T
Tie
A curved line between two or more notes on the same pitch to indicate a single note of combined duration:
Quarter note + Tie + Quarter note = Half note
Quarter note + Tie + Eighth note = Dotted Quarter note
Quarter note + Tie + Eighth note + Tie + 16th note = Double Dotted Quarter note
See also →slur.
Transposition
The act of moving the pitches of one or more notes up or down by a constant 
interval. There may be several
reasons for transposing a piece, for example:
263


1. The tune is too low or too high for a singer. In this case the whole orchestra will have to be transposed as well
—easily done using MuseScore.
2. The part is written for a particular instrument but needs to be played by a different one.
3. The score is written for an orchestra and you want to hear what the individual instruments sound like. This
requires changing the transposing instrument parts to concert pitch.
4. A darker or a more brilliant sound is desired.
Triplet
See →tuplet.
Tuplet
A tuplet divides its next higher note value by a number of notes other than given by the time signature. For example
a →triplet divides the next higher note value into three parts, rather than two. Tuplets may be: →
triplets, →duplets,
→quintuplets, and other.
U
Upbeat
See →pickup measure.
V
Velocity
The velocity property of a note controls how loudly the note is played. This usage of the term comes from MIDI
synthesizers. On a keyboard instrument, it is the speed with which a key is pressed that controls its volume. The
usual scale for velocity is 0 (silent) to 127 (maximum).
Voice
Polyphonic instruments like Keyboards, Violins, or Drums need to write notes or chords of different duration at the
same time on the same →staff. To write such things each horizontal succession of notes or chords has to be written
on the staff independently. In MuseScore you can have up to 4 voices per staff. Not to be confused with vocalists,
singing voices like soprano, alto, tenor and bass, which are better viewed as instruments.
Volta
In a repeated section of music, it is common for the last few measures of the section to differ. Markings called voltas
are used to indicate how the section is to be ended each time. These markings are often referred to simply as
→endings.
