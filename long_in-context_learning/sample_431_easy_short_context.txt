This chapter describes safe flight 
practices, flight restrictions, basic flight 
operations, and the intelligent flight 
modes.


DJI Mini 4 Pro User Manual

Flight and Safety
After completing the pre-flight preparation, it is recommended to train your flying skills and 
practice flying safely. Pick a suitable area to fly in according to the following flight requirements 
and restrictions. Strictly abide by local laws and regulations when flying. Read the Safety 
Guidelines before flight to ensure the safe use of the product.
Flight Environment Requirements
1.	
DO NOT operate the aircraft in severe weather conditions including wind speeds exceeding 
10.7 m/s, snow, rain, and fog.
2.	
Only fly in open areas. Tall buildings and large metal structures may affect the accuracy 
of the onboard compass and GNSS system. Therefore, DO NOT take off from a balcony 
or anywhere within 10 m of buildings. Keep a distance of at least 10 m from buildings 
during flight. After takeoff, make sure you are notified with the voice prompt Home Point 
is updated before continuing flight. If the aircraft has taken off near buildings, the accuracy 
of the Home Point cannot be guaranteed. In this case, pay close attention to the current 
position of the aircraft during auto RTH. When the aircraft is close to the Home Point, 
it is recommended to cancel auto RTH and manually control the aircraft to land at an 
appropriate location.
3.	
The performance of the aircraft and its battery is limited when flying at high altitudes. Fly 
with caution. The maximum takeoff altitude of the aircraft is 4,000 m (13,123 ft) when flying 
with the Intelligent Flight Battery. If the Intelligent Flight Battery Plus is used, the maximum 
takeoff altitude drops to 3,000 m (9,843 ft). If a propeller guard is installed on the aircraft 
with the Intelligent Flight Battery, the maximum takeoff altitude becomes 1,500 m (4,921 ft). 
DO NOT use the propeller guard together with the Intelligent Flight Battery Plus.
4.	
The braking distance of the aircraft is affected by the flight altitude. The higher the altitude, 
the greater the braking distance. When flying at an altitude above 3,000 m (9,843 ft), the 
user should reserve at least 20 m of vertical braking distance and 25 m of horizontal braking 
distance to ensure flight safety.
5.	
Avoid obstacles, crowds, trees, and bodies of water (recommended height is at least 3 m 
above water).
6.	
Minimize interference by avoiding areas with high levels of electromagnetism, such as 
locations near power lines, base stations, electrical substations, and broadcasting towers.
7.	
GNSS cannot be used on the aircraft in polar regions. Use the vision system instead.
8.	
DO NOT take off from moving objects such as cars, ships, and airplanes.
9.	
DO NOT take off from solid-colored surfaces or surfaces with strong reflection such as a car 
roof.
10.	 DO NOT use the aircraft, remote controller, battery, battery charger, and the battery 
charging hub near accidents, fire, explosions, floods, tsunamis, avalanches, landslides, 
earthquakes, dust, sandstorms, salt spray, or fungus.
11.	 Operate the aircraft, remote controller, battery, battery charger, and the battery charging 
hub in a dry environment.
12.	 DO NOT operate the aircraft in an environment at risk of a fire or explosion.
13.	 DO NOT operate the aircraft near bird flocks.

legal rights such as the right to privacy and publicity of others.
11.	 DO NOT trespass onto the private property of others.
Flight Restrictions
GEO (Geospatial Environment Online) System
DJI’s Geospatial Environment Online (GEO) System is a global information system that provides 
real-time information on flight safety and restriction updates and prevents UAVs from flying in 
restricted airspace. Under exceptional circumstances, restricted areas can be unlocked to allow 
flights in. Prior to that, the user must submit an unlocking request based on the current restriction 
level in the intended flight area. The GEO system may not fully comply with local laws and 
regulations. Users shall be responsible for their own flight safety and must consult with the local 
authorities on the relevant legal and regulatory requirements before requesting to unlock a flight 
in a restricted area. For more information about the GEO system, visit https://fly-safe.dji.com.
Flight Limits
For safety reasons, flight limits are enabled by default to help users operate this aircraft safely. 
Users can set flight limits on height and distance. Altitude limits, distance limits, and GEO zones 
function concurrently to manage flight safety when GNSS is available. Only altitude can be 
limited when GNSS is unavailable.

GEO Zones
DJI’s GEO system designates safe flight locations, provides risk levels and safety notices for 
individual flights and offers information on restricted airspace. All restricted flight areas are 
referred to as GEO Zones, which are further divided into Restricted Zones, Authorization Zones, 
Warning Zones, Enhanced Warning Zones, and Altitude Zones. Users can view such information 
in real-time in DJI Fly. GEO Zones are specific flight areas, including but not limited to airports, 
large event venues, locations where public emergencies have occurred (such as forest fires), 
nuclear power plants, prisons, government properties, and military facilities. By default, the 
GEO system limits takeoffs and flights in zones that may cause safety or security concerns. A 
GEO Zone map that contains comprehensive information on GEO Zones around the globe is 
available on the official DJI website: https://fly-safe.dji.com/nfz/nfz-query.
Unlocking GEO Zones
To satisfy the needs of different users, DJI provides two unlocking modes: Self-Unlocking and 
Custom Unlocking. Users may request on the DJI Fly Safe website.
Self-Unlocking is intended for unlocking Authorization Zones. To complete Self-Unlocking, 
the user must submit an unlocking request via the DJI Fly Safe website at https://fly-safe.dji.
com. Once the unlocking request is approved, the user may synchronize the unlocking license 
through the DJI Fly app. To unlock the zone, alternatively, the user may launch or fly the aircraft 
directly into the approved Authorization Zone and follow the prompts in DJI Fly to unlock the 
zone.
Custom Unlocking is tailored for users with special requirements. It designates user-defined 
custom flight areas and provides flight permission documents specific to the needs of different 
users. This unlocking option is available in all countries and regions and can be requested via 
the DJI Fly Safe website at https://fly-safe.dji.com.
•	To ensure flight safety, the aircraft will not be able to fly out of the unlocked zone after 
entering it. If the Home Point is outside the unlocked zone, the aircraft will not be able 
to return home.

ActiveTrack
Trace
There are eight types of tracking 
directions: Front, Back, Left, 
Right, Front Diagonal Left, Front 
Diagonal Right, Back Diagonal Left, 
and Back Diagonal Right. After 
setting the tracking direction, the 
aircraft will follow the subject 
from the tracking direction 
relative to the direction of the 
subject movements.
(Take Right Follow as an example)
Parallel
The aircraft tracks the subject 
while maintaining the same 
geographical orientation in 
relation to the subject.
      (Take East Follow as an example)
•	In Trace mode, the direction setting is only effective when the subject is moving in a 
stable direction. If the moving direction of the subject is not stable, the aircraft will track 
the subject from a certain distance and altitude. Once the tracking starts, the direction of 
tracking can be adjusted through the trace wheel.

Cruise Control
The cruise control function enables the aircraft to lock the current control stick input of the 
remote controller when conditions permit, and to automatically fly at the speed corresponding 
to the current control stick input. Without the need to continually move the control sticks, long-
distance flights become more effortless, and image shaking which often happens during manual 
operating can be avoided. More camera movements such as spiraling up can be achieved by 
increasing the control stick input.

Aircraft
The aircraft contains a flight controller,
video downlink system, vision systems, 
infrared sensing system, propulsion 
system, and an Intelligent Flight 
Battery.


DJI Mini 4 Pro User Manual

Aircraft
The aircraft contains a flight controller, video downlink system, vision systems, infrared sensing 
system, propulsion system, and an Intelligent Flight Battery.
Flight Mode
The aircraft supports the following flight modes, which can be switched via the Flight Mode 
switch on the remote controller.
Normal Mode
The aircraft utilizes GNSS, the omnidirectional vision system, the downward vision system, 
and the 3D infrared sensing system to locate itself and stabilize. When the GNSS signal is 
strong, the aircraft uses GNSS to locate itself and stabilize. When the GNSS is weak, but the 
lighting and other environmental conditions are sufficient, the aircraft uses the vision systems 
for positioning. When the vision systems are enabled, and lighting and other environmental 
conditions are sufficient, the maximum pitch angle is 30° and the maximum horizontal speed is 
12 m/s.
Sport Mode
In Sport Mode, the aircraft uses GNSS and the downward vision system for positioning, and the 
aircraft responses are optimized for agility and speed, making it more responsive to control 
stick movements. The maximum horizontal speed is 16 m/s. Note that obstacle sensing is 
disabled in Sport Mode.
Cine Mode
Cine mode is based on Normal mode with a limited flight speed, making the aircraft more stable 
during shooting.
The aircraft automatically changes to Attitude (ATTI) mode when the vision systems are 
unavailable or disabled and the GNSS signal is weak or the compass experiences interference. In 
ATTI mode, the aircraft may be more easily affected by its surroundings. Environmental factors 
such as wind can result in horizontal drift of the aircraft, which may present hazards especially 
when flying in confined spaces. The aircraft will not be able to hover or brake automatically, 
therefore the pilot should land the aircraft as soon as possible to avoid accidents.
•	The flight modes are only effective for manual flight and cruise control.
•	The vision systems are disabled in Sport mode, which means the aircraft cannot sense 
obstacles on its route automatically. The user must stay alert to the surrounding 
environment and control the aircraft to avoid obstacles.
•	The maximum speed and braking distance of the aircraft significantly increase in Sport 
mode. A minimum braking distance of 30 m is required in windless conditions.
•	A minimum braking distance of 10 m is required in windless conditions while the 
aircraft is ascending and descending in Sport mode or Normal mode.


DJI Mini 4 Pro User Manual

•	The responsiveness of the aircraft significantly increases in Sport mode, which means 
a small control stick movement on the remote controller translates into the aircraft 
moving a large distance. Make sure to maintain adequate maneuvering space during 
flight.
•	The flight speed and attitude are both restricted when the aircraft is flying left or right 
to ensure shooting stability. The restriction reaches its maximum when the tilt of the 
gimbal is -90°. If there are strong winds, the restriction will be disabled to improve the 
wind resistance of the aircraft. As a result, the gimbal may vibrate while shooting.
•	Users may experience a minor tremor in videos recorded in Sport mode.
Aircraft Status Indicators
The aircraft has two aircraft status indicators.

in DJI Fly.
After the motors start, the aircraft status indicators will blink green.
•	Lighting requirements vary depending on the region. Observe local laws and 
regulations.
The Return to Home (RTH) function brings the aircraft back to the last recorded Home Point. 
The RTH can be triggered in three ways: the user actively triggers RTH, the aircraft has low 
battery, or the control signal between the remote controller and the aircraft is lost. If the aircraft 
records the Home Point successfully and the positioning system is functioning normally, when 
the RTH function is triggered, the aircraft will automatically fly back and land at the Home Point.
GNSS
Descriptions
Home 
Point
10
The first location where the aircraft receives a strong to moderately strong 
GNSS signal (indicated by a white icon) will be recorded as the default 
Home Point. The Home Point can be updated before takeoff as long as the 
aircraft receives another strong to moderately strong GNSS signal. If the 
signal is weak, the Home Point will not be updated. After the Home Point is 
recorded, DJI Fly will issue a voice prompt.
If it is necessary to update the Home Point during a flight (such as where 
the position of the user has changed), the Home Point can be manually 
updated in Settings > Safety page in DJI Fly.
During RTH, the aircraft will automatically adjust the gimbal tilt to point the camera toward the 
RTH route by default. If the video transmission signal is normal, the AR Home Point, AR RTH 
route, and AR aircraft shadow will be displayed in the camera view by default. This improves the 
flight experience by helping users view the RTH route and Home Point and avoid obstacles on 
the route. The display can be changed in System Settings > Safety > AR Settings.
•	The AR RTH route is only used for reference, and may deviate from the actual flight 
route in different scenarios. Always pay attention to the liveview on the screen during 
RTH. Fly with caution.

Advanced RTH
When Advanced RTH is triggered, the aircraft will automatically plan the best RTH path, which 
will be displayed in DJI Fly and will adjust according to the environment.
If the control signal between the remote controller and the aircraft is good, exit RTH by tapping 
 in DJI Fly or by pressing the RTH button on the remote controller. After exiting RTH, users will 
regain control of the aircraft.
Trigger Method
•	
The user actively triggers RTH
	
Advanced RTH can be initiated either by tapping 
 in DJI Fly or by pressing and holding the 
RTH button on the remote controller until it beeps. 
•	
Aircraft low battery
	
When the Intelligent Flight Battery level is too low and there is not enough power to return 
home, land the aircraft as soon as possible.
	
To avoid unnecessary danger caused by insufficient power, the aircraft automatically 
calculates if the battery power is sufficient to return to the Home Point according to the 
current position, environment, and flight speed. A warning prompt will appear in DJI Fly 
when the battery level is low and only enough to complete an RTH flight. The aircraft will 
automatically fly to the Home Point if no action is taken after a countdown.
	
The user can cancel RTH by pressing the RTH button on the remote controller. If RTH is 
canceled following the warning, the Intelligent Battery may not have enough power for the 
aircraft to land safely, which may lead to the aircraft crashing or being lost.
•	During RTH, use the gimbal dial to adjust the camera orientation or press the 
customizable buttons on the remote controller to recenter the camera will stop the 
aircraft from automatically adjusting the gimbal tilt, which may prevent the AR RTH 
route from being viewed.
•	When reaching the Home Point, the aircraft will automatically adjust the gimbal tilt 
vertically down.  


DJI Mini 4 Pro User Manual

The aircraft will land automatically if the current battery level can only support the aircraft 
long enough to descend from its current altitude. Auto landing cannot be canceled, but the 
remote controller can be used to control the horizontal movement and the descent speed of 
the aircraft during landing. If there is sufficient power, the throttle stick can be used to make 
the aircraft ascend at a speed of 1 m/s.
	
During auto landing, move the aircraft horizontally to find an appropriate place to land as 
soon as possible. The aircraft will fall if the user keeps pushing the throttle stick upward until 
the power is depleted.
•	
Loss of remote controller signal
	
The action of the aircraft when the remote controller signal is lost can be set to RTH, land, or 
hover in Setting >Safety > Advanced Safety Settings in DJI Fly. If the action is set to RTH, the 
Home Point was successfully recorded and the compass is functioning normally, Failsafe RTH 
automatically activates after the remote controller signal is lost for more than six seconds.
	
When the lighting is sufficient and the environment is suitable for the vision systems to 
work normally, DJI Fly will display the RTH path that was generated by the aircraft before the 
remote controller signal was lost. The aircraft will start RTH using Advanced RTH according 
to the RTH settings. The aircraft will remain in RTH even if the remote controller signal is 
restored. DJI Fly will update the RTH path accordingly.
When the lighting is not sufficient or the environment is not suitable for the vision systems 
to work normally, the aircraft will enter Original Route RTH. The aircraft will enter or remain 
in Preset RTH if the remote controller signal is restored during RTH. The Original Route RTH 
procedure is as follows:
1.	 The aircraft brakes and hovers in place.
2.	 When RTH begins:
•	
If the RTH distance (the horizontal distance between the aircraft and the Home Point) 
is farther than 50 m, the aircraft adjusts its orientation and flies backward for 50 m on 
its original flight route before entering Preset RTH.
•	
If the RTH distance is farther than 5 m but less than 50 m, it adjusts its orientation and 
flies to the Home Point in a straight line at the current altitude.
•	
The aircraft lands immediately if the RTH distance is less than 5 m.
3.	 The aircraft begins to land when it reaches above the Home Point.
•	If RTH is triggered through DJI Fly and the RTH distance is farther than 5 m, DJI Fly will 
display the two following options: RTH and Landing. Users can select either RTH or 
directly land the aircraft.
•	The aircraft may not be able to return to the Home Point normally if the positioning 
system is functioning abnormally. During Failsafe RTH, the aircraft may enter ATTI mode 
and land automatically if the positioning system is functioning abnormally.  
•	It is important to set a suitable RTH altitude before each flight. Launch DJI Fly and set 
the RTH altitude. The default RTH altitude is 100 m.
•	The aircraft cannot sense obstacles during Failsafe RTH if the vision systems are 
unavailable.
•	GEO zones may affect the RTH. Avoid flying near GEO zones.

•	The aircraft may not be able to return to a Home Point when the wind speed is too high. 
Fly with caution.
•	Pay extra attention to small or fine objects (such as tree branches or power lines) 
or transparent objects (such as water or glass) during RTH. Exit RTH and control the 
aircraft manually in an emergency.
RTH Procedure
1.	 The Home Point is recorded.
2.	 Advanced RTH is triggered.
3.	 The aircraft brakes and hovers in place. When RTH begins:
•	
The aircraft lands immediately if the RTH distance is less than 5 m.
•	
If the RTH distance is farther than 5 m, the aircraft will adjust its orientation to the Home 
Point and plan the best path according to the RTH settings, lighting, and environmental 
conditions.
4.	 The aircraft will fly automatically according to the RTH settings, environment, and 
transmission signal during RTH.
5.	 The aircraft lands and the motors stop after reaching the Home Point.
RTH Settings
RTH settings are available for Advanced RTH. Go to the camera view in DJI Fly, tap Settings > 
Safety, and then RTH.
1.	 Optimal: 
•	
If the lighting is sufficient and the environment is suitable for the vision systems, the 
aircraft will automatically plan the optimal RTH path and adjust the altitude according to 
environmental factors, such as obstacles and transmission signals, regardless of the RTH 
Altitude setting. The optimal RTH path means the aircraft will travel the shortest distance 
possible to reduce the amount of battery power used and to increase flight time.
•	
If the lighting is insufficient or the environment is not suitable for the vision systems, the 
aircraft will execute Preset RTH based on the RTH Altitude setting.

•	During Advanced RTH, the aircraft will adjust the flight speed automatically to suit 
environmental factors such as wind speed and obstacles.
•	The aircraft cannot avoid small or fine objects such as tree branches or power lines. Fly 
the aircraft to an open area before using RTH.
•	Set Advanced RTH as Preset if there are power lines or towers that the aircraft cannot 
bypass on the RTH path and make sure the RTH Altitude is set higher than all obstacles.
•	The aircraft will brake and return to home according to the latest settings if the RTH 
settings are changed during RTH.
•	If the max altitude is adjusted below the current altitude during RTH, the aircraft will 
descend to the max altitude first and then continue returning to home.
•	The RTH Altitude cannot be changed during RTH. 
•	If there is a large difference between the current altitude and the RTH altitude, the 
amount of battery power used cannot be calculated accurately due to wind speed 
difference at different altitudes. Pay extra attention to the battery power prompts and 
warning prompts in DJI Fly.
•	During Advanced RTH, the aircraft will enter Preset RTH if the lighting condition or 
environment becomes unsuitable for the vision systems. In this case, the aircraft cannot 
bypass the obstacles. An appropriate RTH altitude must be set before entering RTH.
•	When the remote controller signal is normal during Advanced RTH, the pitch stick can 
be used to control the flight speed, but the orientation and altitude cannot be controlled 
and the aircraft cannot be controlled to fly to the left or right. Constantly pushing the 
pitch stick to accelerate will increase the battery power consumption speed. The aircraft 
cannot bypass obstacles if the flight speed exceeds the effective sensing speed. The 
aircraft will brake and hover in place and exit RTH if the pitch stick is pushed all the way 
down. The aircraft can be controlled after the pitch stick is released.
•	If the aircraft reaches the altitude limit of the aircraft current location or of the Home 
Point while it is ascending during Preset RTH, the aircraft stops ascending and returns 
to the Home Point at the current altitude. Pay attention to flight safety during RTH.
•	If the Home Point is within the Altitude Zone but the aircraft is not, when the aircraft 
reaches the Altitude Zone it will descend below the altitude limit, which may be lower 
than the set RTH altitude. Fly with caution.
•	The aircraft will bypass any GEO zones encountered when it is flying forward during 
Advanced RTH. Fly with caution.
•	The aircraft will exit RTH if the surrounding environment is too complex to complete 
RTH, even if the vision systems are working properly.

aircraft descends to 0.5 m from the ground. Tap confirm or push the throttle stick all the 
way down and hold for one second, and the aircraft will land.
Precision Landing
The aircraft automatically scans and attempts to match the terrain features below during RTH. 
The aircraft will land when the current terrain matches the Home Point. A prompt will appear in 
DJI Fly if the terrain match fails.
•	Landing Protection is activated during Precision Landing.
•	The performance of Precision Landing is subject to the following conditions:
a.	 The Home Point must be recorded upon takeoff and must not be changed during 
flight. Otherwise, the aircraft will have no record of the terrain features of the Home 
Point.
b.	 During takeoff, the aircraft must ascend at least 7 m before moving horizontally.
c.	 The Home Point terrain features must remain largely unchanged.
d.	 The terrain features of the Home Point must be sufficiently distinctive. Terrain such 
as a snow-covered field is not suitable.
e.	 The lighting conditions must not be too bright or too dark.
•	The following actions are available during Precision Landing:
a.	 Press the throttle stick down to accelerate landing.
b.	 Movement of any other control stick apart from the throttle stick will be regarded 
as giving up Precision Landing. The aircraft will descend vertically after the control 
sticks are released. Landing Protection is still effective in this case.

Vision Systems and 3D Infrared Sensing System
DJI Mini 4 Pro is equipped with both an omnidirectional vision system (forward, backward, 
lateral, upward), downward vision system, and 3D infrared sensing system, which allows for 
positioning and omnidirectional obstacle sensing.
The omnidirectional vision system consists of four cameras which are located at the front of 
the aircraft. The downward vision system consists of two cameras, located at the bottom of the 
aircraft. The vision systems sense obstacles by image ranging.
The 3D infrared sensing system on the bottom consists of a 3D infrared emitter and a receiver. 
The 3D infrared sensing system helps the aircraft to assess the distance to obstacles, the 
distance to the ground, and calculate the aircraft position together with the downward vision 
system. The 3D infrared sensing system meets the human eye safety requirement for Class 1 
laser products.
The auxiliary light located at the bottom of the aircraft can assist the downward vision system. 
It will automatically turn on by default in low-light environments when the flight altitude is 
under 5 m. Users can also turn it on or off manually in the DJI Fly app. Each time the aircraft is 
restarted, the auxiliary light will revert back to the default setting Auto.

Using the Vision Systems
The positioning function of the downward vision system is applicable when GNSS signals are 
unavailable or weak. It is automatically enabled in Normal or Cine mode.
The omnidirectional vision system will activate automatically when the aircraft is in Normal 
or Cine mode and Obstacle Avoidance is set to Bypass or Brake in DJI Fly. The omnidirectional 
vision system works best with adequate lighting and clearly marked or textured obstacles. Due 
to inertia, users must make sure to brake the aircraft within a reasonable distance.
•	Pay attention to the flight environment. The vision system and the 3D infrared sensing 
system only work in certain scenarios and cannot replace human control and judgment. 
During a flight, always pay attention to the surrounding environment and the warnings 
in DJI Fly, and be responsible for and maintain control of the aircraft at all times.
•	The downward vision system works best when the aircraft is at an altitude from 0.5 to 
30 m if there is no GNSS available. Extra caution is required if the altitude of the aircraft 
is above 30 m as the vision positioning performance may be affected.
•	In low-light environments, the vision systems may not achieve optimal positioning 
performance even if the auxiliary light is turned on. Fly with caution if the GNSS signal is 
weak in such environments.
•	The downward vision system may not work properly when the aircraft is flying near 
water. Therefore, the aircraft may not be able to actively avoid water below it when 
landing. It is recommended to maintain flight control at all times, make reasonable 
judgments based on the surrounding environment, and avoid over-relying on the 
downward vision system.

Advanced Pilot Assistance Systems
The Advanced Pilot Assistance Systems (APAS) feature is available in Normal mode and Cine 
mode. When APAS is enabled, the aircraft will continue to respond to user commands and plan 
its path according to both control stick inputs and the flight environment. APAS makes it easier 
to avoid obstacles, obtain smoother footage, and give a better flying experience.
Keep moving the control sticks in any direction. The aircraft will bypass obstacles by flying 
above, below, or to the left or right of the obstacle. The aircraft can also respond to the control 
stick inputs while bypassing obstacles. 
When APAS is enabled, the aircraft can be stopped by pressing the Flight Pause button on the 
remote controller. The aircraft brakes and hovers for three seconds and awaits further pilot 
commands.
To enable APAS, open DJI Fly, enter Settings > Safety, and enable APAS by selecting Bypass. 
Select Normal or Nifty mode when using Bypass. In Nifty mode, the aircraft can fly faster, 
smoother, and closer to obstacles obtaining better footage while bypassing obstacles. However, 
the risk of crashing into obstacles will increase. Fly with caution.
Nifty mode cannot work normally in the following situations:
1.	
When aircraft orientation changes rapidly flying near obstacles.
2.	
When flying through narrow obstacles such as canopies or bushes at high speed.
3.	
When flying near obstacles that are too small to detect.
4.	
When flying with the propeller guard.
Landing Protection
Landing Protection will activate if Obstacle Avoidance is set to Bypass or Brake and the user 
pushes the throttle stick down to land the aircraft. Landing Protection is enabled once the 
aircraft begins to land.
1.	
During Landing Protection, the aircraft will automatically detect if an area is suitable for 
landing, and then land the aircraft.
2.	
If the ground is determined to be unsuitable for landing, the aircraft will hover when the 
aircraft descends to 0.8 m above ground. Push down on the throttle stick for at least five 
seconds, and the aircraft will land without obstacle sensing.
•	Make sure to use APAS when the vision systems are available. Make sure there are no 
people, animals, objects with small surface areas (e.g., tree branches), or transparent 
objects (e.g., glass or water) along the desired flight path.
•	Make sure to use APAS when the downward vision systems are available or the GNSS 
signal is strong. APAS may not function properly when the aircraft is flying over water or 
snow-covered areas.
•	Be extra cautious when flying in extremely dark (<300 lux) or bright (>10,000 lux) 
environments.
•	Pay attention to DJI Fly and make sure APAS is working normally.
•	APAS may not function properly when the aircraft is flying near flight limits or in a GEO zone.

[1] 	 Standard aircraft weight (including the Intelligent Flight Battery, propellers, and a microSD card). The 
actual product weight may vary due to differences in batch materials and external factors. Registration 
is not required in some countries and regions. Always check local laws and regulations before use. With 
the Intelligent Flight Battery Plus (sold separately and only in select countries), the aircraft will weigh more 
than 249 g. Always check and strictly abide by local laws and regulations before flying.
[2] 	 The max horizontal speed is subject to dynamic local restrictions. Always abide by local laws and 
regulations when flying.
[3] 	 Increase in aircraft weight can affect flight propulsion. When the aircraft is using the Intelligent Flight 
Battery Plus, do not mount additional payloads like a propeller guard or third-party accessories to avoid 
diminished propulsion.

•	The photos taken in Single Shot mode have no HDR effect in the following situations:
a.	 When the aircraft is moving or unstable due to high wind speeds.
b.	 When white balance is set to manual mode.
c.	 The camera is in Auto mode and the EV setting is adjusted manually.
d.	 The camera is in Auto mode and the AE lock is turned on.
e.	 The camera is in Pro mode.
•	DJI Mini 4 Pro doesn't include a built-in fan, which effectively reduces the aircraft's 
weight and increases the battery life. Meanwhile, it uses the wind generated by the 
propellers to dissipate heat during the flight, ensuring heat dissipation to prevent 
overheating. When DJI Mini 4 Pro stays in standby mode for a long time, its temperature 
may continuously rise. The aircraft has a built-in temperature control system, when 
in standby mode the aircraft can make intelligent judgments based on the current 
temperature to better reduce the temperature. DJI Mini 4 Pro is added with an energy-
saving mode. When the temperature of the aircraft rises to a certain temperature, the 
aircraft will enter the energy-saving mode. If the temperature of the aircraft continues 
to rise, it will power off to prevent overheating.
	 You can see whether the aircraft is in energy-saving mode by the prompts in the aircraft 
system status bar. Exit this mode by the following methods:
a.	 Tap settings in DJI Fly, and exit the energy-saving mode according to the prompt.
b.	 Start motors using the remote controller to exit the energy-saving mode.
	 In energy-saving mode, the user can only take photos and record videos, settings and 
functions about flight are unavailable. Operate based on the prompts in DJI Fly.

FAR Remote ID Compliance Information
The aircraft complies with the requirements of 14 CFR Part 89:
•	
The aircraft automatically broadcasts Remote ID messages from takeoff to shut down. An 
external device such as a cell phone or tablet is required to be connected as a location 
source to DJI mobile devices without an integrated GNSS system 
[1],  and must run the DJI 
flight control app such as DJI Fly in the foreground and always allow the DJI flight control app 
to obtain its accurate location information. The connected external device must minimally be 
one of the following:
1)	 FCC Certified personal wireless device that uses GPS with SBAS (WAAS) for location 
services; or
2)	 FCC Certified personal wireless device with integrated GNSS.
	
Also, the external device must be operated in a way that does not interfere with the location 
reported and its correlation to the operator location.
•	
The aircraft automatically initiates a pre-flight self-test (PFST) of the Remote ID system 
before takeoff and cannot take off if it does not pass the PFST
 [2]. The results of the PFST of 
the Remote ID system can be viewed in either a DJI flight control app such as DJI Fly or DJI 
goggles.
•	
The aircraft monitors the Remote ID system functionality from pre-flight to shut down. If the 
Remote ID system malfunctions or has a failure, an alarm will be displayed in either a DJI 
flight control app such as DJI Fly or DJI goggles.
Footnotes
[1]	 DJI mobile devices without an integrated GNSS system such as DJI RC-N2.
[2]	 The pass criterion for PFST is that the hardware and software of the Remote ID required-data source and 
radio transmitter in the Remote ID system are functioning properly.
