# Question

Recently, I have conducted some research on the MCT8316A-Q1 high-speed sensorless trapezoidal control integrated FET BLDC driver, but I do not fully understand some of the functions of its pins. Which of the following statements is incorrect?

# Choices

- A: The pin FB_BK has a feedback function for the boost regulator, typically connected to the output of the buck regulator after the inductor.
- B: If the voltage ramp of the power supply (VM) exceeds 2V/Âµs, it may cause permanent damage to the device and affect its functionality and performance, shortening its lifespan.
- C: The OCP event is for low-power protection. If the current flowing through the high-side MOSFET exceeds the IBK_OCP threshold for longer than the anti-spike pulse time (tOCP_DEG), a buck OCP event will be recognized.
- D: When OCP_MODE=10b, no protective measures will be taken when an OCP event occurs. Overcurrent events are reported by setting the DRIVER_FAULT, OCP, and the corresponding FET's OCP bits to 1b in the fault status register.

# Answer

D
