TE Impairment of the operating e̱-

Airbags and seat belt tensioners, as well as

# Do not carry out repairs or welding.
# Have accessories retro̯tted at a quali-

You could jeopardise the operating safety of your
vehicle if you use parts, tyres and wheels as well
as accessories relevant to safety which have not
been approved by Mercedes-Benz. Safety-relevant
systems (e.g. the brake system) may malfunction.
Only use Mercedes-Benz GenuineParts or parts of
equal quality. Only use tyres, wheels and acces-
sory parts that have been speci̯cally approved
for your vehicle model.
Mercedes-Benz tests original parts and conver-
sion parts and accessory parts that have been
speci̯cally approved for your vehicle model for
their reliability, safety and suitability. Despite
ongoing market research, Mercedes-Benz is
unable to assess other parts. Mercedes-Benz
therefore accepts no responsibility for the use of
such parts in Mercedes-Benz vehicles, even if
they have been o̱cially approved or independ-
ently approved by a testing centre.
Certain parts are only o̱cially approved for
installation or modi̯cation if they comply with
legal requirements. All Mercedes-Benz Genuine-
Parts meet the approval requirements. The use of
non-approved parts may invalidate the vehicle's
general operating permit.

This is the case in the following situations:
R The vehicle type is di̮erent from that for
which the vehicle's general operating permit
was granted.

material coming into contact with hot
parts of the exhaust system
If combustible materials, e.g. leaves, grass or
twigs, come into contact with hot parts of the
exhaust system, they may ignite.
# When driving o̮-road or on unpaved sur-
faces, check the underside of the vehicle
at regular intervals.
# In particular, remove any trapped parts
of plants or other ̰ammable material.
# If damage should occur, immediately

NOTE
TE Damage to the vehicle due to driv-
ing too fast and due to impacts to the
vehicle underbody or suspension compo-
nents
In the following situations, in particular, there
is a risk of damage to the vehicle:
R the vehicle becomes grounded, e.g. on a
high kerb or an unpaved road
R the vehicle is driven too fast over an obsta-
cle, e.g. a kerb, speed bump or pothole
R a heavy object strikes the underbody or
suspension components
In situations such as these, damage to the
body, underbody, suspension components,
wheels or tyres may not be visible. Compo-
nents damaged in this way can unexpectedly
fail or, in the case of an accident, may no lon-
ger absorb the resulting force as intended.
If the underbody panelling is damaged, ̰am-
mable materials such as leaves, grass or twigs
can collect between the underbody and the
underbody panelling. These materials may
ignite if they come into contact with hot parts
of the exhaust system.
# Have the vehicle checked and repaired
immediately at a quali̯ed specialist
workshop.
or
# If driving safety is impaired while con-
tinuing your journey, pull over and stop
the vehicle immediately, while paying
attention to road and tra̱c conditions,
and contact a quali̯ed specialist work-
shop.

High-voltage components that can become very
hot are marked with an additional warning sticker:
Vehicles with hybrid systems generate signi̯-
cantly less noise when stationary and when being
driven than vehicles with combustion engines.
When driving in electric mode, the vehicle may
not be heard by other road users due to the signif-
icantly reduced noise generated.
It is for this reason that the vehicle is equipped
with a sound generator, which serves as an acous-
tic vehicle alerting system (AVAS).

Objects in the driver's footwell may impede
pedal travel or block a depressed pedal.
This jeopardises the operating and road safety
of the vehicle.
# Stow all objects in the vehicle securely
so that they cannot get into the driver's
footwell.
# Always ̯t the ̰oor mats securely and as
prescribed in order to ensure that there
is always su̱cient room for the pedals.
# Do not use loose ̰oor mats and do not
place ̰oor mats on top of one another.

onic medical aids
Mercedes-Benz AG cannot, despite carefully
developing vehicle systems, completely rule out
the interaction of vehicle systems with electronic
medical aids such as cardiac pacemakers.
In addition, there are components installed in the
vehicle that, regardless of the operating status of
the vehicle, can generate magnetic ̯elds on a par
with permanent magnets. These ̯elds can be
found, for example, in the area around the multi-
media and sound system or also in the area of the
seats, depending on the vehicle equipment.
For this reason, the following can occur in isolated
cases, depending on the aids used:
R Medical aids malfunctioning
R Adverse health e̮ects
Observe the notes and warnings of the manufac-
turer of the medical aids; if in doubt, contact the
device manufacturer and/or your doctor. If there
is continuing uncertainty concerning the possibil-
ity of medical aids malfunctioning, Mercedes-
Benz AG recommends using only few electrical
vehicle systems and/or maintaining a distance
from the components.

Electronic control units are ̯tted in your vehicle.
Control units process data which, forexample,
they receive from vehicle sensors, generate them-
selves or exchange between themselves. Some
control units are required for the safe operation of
your vehicle, some assist you when driving,
suchas driver assistance systems, while others
enable convenience or infotainment functions.
The following provides you with general informa-
tion regarding data processing in the vehicle.
Additional information regarding exactly which
data in your vehicle are collected, saved and
transmitted to third parties, and for what purpose,
can be found in the information directly related to
the functional characteristics in question in their
respective operating instructions. This information
is also available online and, depending on the
vehicle equipment, digitally.

Per
ersonal data
sonal data
Every vehicle is identi̯ed by a unique vehicle
identi̯cation number. Depending on the country,
this vehicle identi̯cation number can be used by,
forexample, governmental authorities to deter-
mine the identity of the owner. There are other
possibilities to use data collected from the vehicle
to identify the owner or driver, suchas the licence
plate number.
Therefore, data generated or processed by control
units may be attributable to a person or, under
certain conditions, become attributable to a per-
son. Depending on which vehicle data are availa-
ble, it may be possible to make inferences about,
forexample, your driving behaviour, your location,
your route or your use patterns.

If legally required to do so, manufacturers are, in
individual cases, legally obliged to provide govern-
mental entities, upon request and to the extent
required, data stored by the manufacturer.
Forexample, this may be the case during the
investigation of a criminal o̮ence.
Governmental entities are themselves, in individ-
ual cases and within the applicable legal frame-
work, authorised to read out data from the vehi-
cle. In the case of an accident, information that
can help with an investigation can, therefore, be
taken from the airbag control unit, forexample.

This is data regarding the operation of the vehicle,
which have been processed by control units.
This includes the following data, forexample:
R vehicle status information suchas the speed,
longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration,
number of wheel revolutions or the fastened
seat belts display
R ambient conditions, suchas temperature, rain
sensor or distance sensor
Generally, the use of these data is temporary;
they will not be stored beyond the period of oper-
ation and will only be processed within the vehicle
itself. Control units o͔en contain data memories
for vehicle keys, forexample. Their use permits the
temporary or permanent documentation of techni-
cal information about the vehicle's operating
state, component loads, maintenance require-
ments and technical events or faults.
Depending on the vehicle equipment, the follow-
ing data are stored:
R operating status of system components,
suchas ̯ll levels, tyre pressure or battery sta-
tus
R malfunctions or faults in important system
components, suchas lights or brakes
R system reactions in special driving situations,
suchas airbag deployment or the intervention
of stability control systems
R information on events leading to vehicle dam-
age
In certain cases, it may be required to store data
that would have otherwise been used only tempo-
rarily. This may be the case if the vehicle has
detected a malfunction, forexample.
If you use services, suchas repair services and
maintenance work, stored operational data as
well as the vehicle identi̯cation number can be
read out and used. They can be read out by

down services. The same is true in the case of
warranty claims and quality assurance measures.
In general, the readout is performed via the legally
prescribed port for the diagnostics connection in
the vehicle. The operational data that are read out
document technical states of the vehicle or of
individual components and assist in the diagnosis
of malfunctions, compliance with warranty obliga-
tions and quality improvement. To that end, these
data, in particular information about component
loads, technical events, malfunctions and other
faults may be transmitted along with the vehicle
identi̯cation number to the manufacturer. Fur-
thermore, the manufacturer is subject to product
liability. For this reason the manufacturer also
uses operational data from the vehicle, forexam-

The restraint system includes the following com-
ponents:
R Seat belt system
R Airbags
R Child restraint system
R Child seat securing systems
The restraint system can help prevent the vehicle
occupants from coming into contact with parts of
the vehicle interior in the event of an accident. In
the event of an accident, the restraint system can
also reduce the forces to which the vehicle occu-
pants are subjected.
A seat belt can only provide the best level of pro-
tection if it is worn correctly. Depending on the
detected accident situation, seat belt tensioners
and/or airbags supplement the protection o̮ered
by a correctly worn seat belt. Seat belt tensioners
and/or airbags are not deployed in every acci-
dent.
In order for the restraint system to provide the
intended level of protection, each vehicle occu-
pant must observe the following information:
R Fasten seat belts correctly.
R Sit in an almost upright seat position with their
back against the seat backrest.
R Sit with their feet resting on the ̰oor, if possi-
ble.
R Always secure persons under 1.50 m tall in an
additional restraint system suitable for
Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
However, no system available today can com-
pletely eliminate injuries and fatalities in every
accident situation. In particular, the seat belt and
airbag generally do not protect against objects
penetrating the vehicle from the outside. It is also
not possible to completely rule out the risk of
injury caused by the airbag deploying.

he res
estr
traint syst
aint system in an accident
em in an accident
How the restraint system works depends on the
severity of the impact detected and the apparent
type of accident:
R Frontal impact
R Rear impact
R Side impact
R Rollover
The activation thresholds for the components of
the restraint system are determined based on the
evaluation of the sensor values measured at vari-
ous points in the vehicle. This process is pre-emp-
tive in nature. The triggering/deployment of the
components of the restraint system must take
place in good time at the start of the collision.
Factors which can only be seen and measured
a͔er a collision has occurred cannot play a deci-
sive role in airbag deployment. Nor do they pro-
vide an indication of airbag deployment.
The vehicle may be deformed signi̯cantly without
an airbag being deployed. This is the case if only
parts which are relatively easily deformed are
a̮ected and the rate of vehicle deceleration is
46
46
Occupant safety


not high. Conversely, an airbag may be deployed
even though the vehicle su̮ers only minor defor-
mation. If very rigid vehicle parts such as longitu-
dinal members are hit, this may result in su̱-
ciently high levels of vehicle deceleration.
Depending on the detected deployment situation,
the components of the restraint system can be
activated or deployed independently of each
other:
R Seat belt tensioner: frontal impact, rear
impact, side impact, rollover
R Driver's airbag, front passenger airbag: frontal
impact
R Knee airbag: frontal impact
R Side airbag: side impact
R Window airbag: side impact, rollover, frontal
impact
R PRE-SAFE® Impulse Side: side impact
The front passenger airbag can only be deployed
in an accident if the PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF
indicator lamp is o̮. If the front passenger seat is
occupied, make sure, both before and during the
journey, that the status of the front passenger air-
bag is correct (/ page 56).
&
WARNING
ARNING Risk of burns from hot airbag
components
The airbag parts are hot a͔er an airbag has
been deployed.
# Do not touch the airbag parts.
# Have a deployed airbag replaced at a
quali̯ed specialist workshop as soon as
possible.
Mercedes-Benz recommends that you have the
vehicle towed to a quali̯ed specialist workshop
a͔er an accident. Take this into account, particu-
larly if a seat belt tensioner is triggered or an air-
bag deployed.
If the seat belt tensioners are triggered or an air-
bag is deployed, you will hear a bang, and a small
amount of powder may also be released:
R The bang will not generally a̮ect your hearing.
R In general, the powder released is not hazard-
ous to health but may cause short-term
breathing di̱culties to persons su̮ering from
asthma or other pulmonary conditions.
Provided it is safe to do so, leave the vehicle
immediately or open the window in order to
prevent breathing di̱culties.

Each vehicle occupant must make sure of the
following:
R Fasten seat belts correctly. Pregnant
women must take particular care to ensure
that the lap belt never lies across the
abdomen.
R Adopt the correct seat position and keep
as far away as possible from the airbags.
R Observe the following information.
# Always make sure that there are no
objects between the airbag and vehicle
occupant.
To avoid the risks resulting from the deployment
of an airbag, each vehicle occupant must observe
the following information in particular:
R Before starting your journey, adjust your seat
correctly; the driver's seat and front
passenger seat should be moved as far back
as possible.
When doing so, always observe the informa-
tion on the correct driver's seat position
(/ page 106).
R Only hold the steering wheel by the steering
wheel rim. This allows the airbag to be fully
deployed.
R Always lean against the seat backrest when
the vehicle is in motion. Do not lean forwards
or against the door or side window. You may
otherwise be in the deployment area of the
airbags.
R The occupants must always keep their feet on
the ̰oor. Do not put your feet on the cockpit,
for example. Your feet may otherwise be in the
deployment area of the airbag.
R If children are travelling in the vehicle, observe

To improve protection for children younger than
12 years old or under 1.50 m in height,
Mercedes-Benz recommends you observe the fol-
lowing information:
R Always secure the child in a child restraint sys-
tem suitable for this Mercedes-Benz vehicle.
R The child restraint system must be appropriate
to the age, weight and size of the child.
R The vehicle seat must be suitable for ̯tting a

WARNING
ARNING Risk of accident if the rear
bench seat, rear seat and seat backrest
are not engaged
The rear bench seat, rear seat and seat back-
rest may fold forwards, even while the vehicle
is in motion.
R As a result, the vehicle occupant will be
pressed into the seat belt with increased
force. The seat belt will not be able to pro-
tect as intended and could cause addi-
tional injury.
R Objects or loads in the boot or load com-
partment cannot be restrained by the seat
backrest.
# Make sure that the rear bench seat, the
rear seat and the seat backrest are
engaged before every trip.
If the le͔ and right seat backrests are not
engaged and locked in place, this will be shown
on the display on the instrument display.
If the centre seat backrest is not engaged and
locked in place, the red lock veri̯cation indicator

WARNING
ARNING Risk of injury or death if the
permissible gross mass of the child and
child restraint system together is excee-
ded.
Too much load may be placed on the ISOFIX
or i‑Size child restraint systems and the child
may not be restrained correctly in the event of
an accident, for example.
# If the child and the child restraint system
together weigh more than 33 kg, only
use an ISOFIX or i‑Size child restraint
system with which the child is secured
with the vehicle seat belt.
# Also secure the child restraint system
with the Top Tether belt, if available.
Always comply with the information about the
mass of the child restraint system:
R in the manufacturer's installation and operat-
ing instructions for the child restraint system
used
R on a label on the child restraint system, if
present
Regularly check that the permissible gross mass
of the child and child restraint system is still com-
plied with.
When ̯tting a child restraint system, observe the
following:
O Always observe the correct use of the seats
and consider their suitability for attaching a
child restraint system.

Occupant safety


O When using a forward-facing child restraint
system in weight category I: remove the head
restraint from the respective seat, if possible.
A͔er the child restraint system has been
removed, replace the head restraint immedi-
ately and adjust all head restraints correctly.
O The backrest of the forward-facing child
restraint system must, as far as possible, be
resting on the seat backrest of the front
passenger seat.
O If the head restraint of the child seat cannot
be fully extended when it is installed in the
vehicle, this will result in restrictions on the
maximum size setting for child restraint sys-
tems in weight category II or III.
Contact with the roof when the head
restraint is fully extended and locked in place
will not result in any restrictions on use.
O The child restraint system must not be put
under strain between the roof and the seat
cushion and/or be ̯tted facing the wrong
direction.
O The child restraint system must not be put
under strain by the head restraint. Adjust the
head restraints as appropriate.
O Never place objects (e.g. cushions) under or
behind the child restraint system.

WARNING
ARNING Risk of accident despite Adap-
tive Highbeam Assist
Adaptive Highbeam Assist does not react to:
R road users without lights, e.g. pedestrians
R road users with poor lighting, e.g. cyclists
R road users whose lighting is obstructed,
e.g. by a barrier
On very rare occasions, Adaptive Highbeam
Assist may fail to recognise other road users
with their own lighting, or may recognise them
too late.
In these, or in similar situations, the automatic
high beam will not be deactivated or will be
activated despite the presence of other road
users.
# Always observe the road and tra̱c con-
ditions carefully and switch o̮ the high
beam in good time.
Adaptive Highbeam Assist cannot take into
account road, weather or tra̱c conditions.
Detection may be restricted in the following
cases:
R in poor visibility, e.g. fog, heavy rain or snow
R if there is dirt on the sensors or the sensors
are obscured
Adaptive Highbeam Assist is only an aid. You are
responsible for adjusting the vehicle's lighting to
the prevailing light, visibility and tra̱c conditions.
Adaptive Highbeam Assist automatically switches
between the following types of light:
R Low beam
R High beam
At speeds greater than 30 km/h:
R If no other road users are detected, the high
beam will switch on automatically.

The hybrid system combines a combustion engine
with an electric motor.
Characteristics when the vehicle is at a standstill:
R The combustion engine is generally switched
o̮.
R Idle speed only occurs in certain instances.
Characteristics when starting the vehicle:
R If the high-voltage battery is su̱ciently
charged, the vehicle can be started with the
electric drive without the combustion engine
(silent start).
R If the high-voltage battery for the electric drive
is not su̱ciently charged or the vehicle condi-

% Depending on the system, it may be that even
though the high-voltage battery is charged,
electric mode has restricted or no availability.
Once the combustion engine has been oper-
ated for long enough, electric mode is again
available without restriction.
Characteristics with moderate power output
requests:
R The combustion engine is switched o̮ as
o͔en as possible during a journey.
R The vehicle can, depending on the drive pro-
gram selected and the state of charge of the
high-voltage battery, be accelerated electri-
cally up to speeds of approximately
140 km/h.
Characteristics with high power output requests:
R The electric motor supports the combustion
engine (boost e̮ect), e.g. when pulling away
or accelerating.
R The high-voltage battery is discharging.
Characteristics when releasing the accelerator
pedal during a journey:
R The electric motor is operated as an alternator
when in overrun mode and during braking.
R The high-voltage battery is charging.
Notes on electric mode:
R Vehicles with hybrid systems generate signi̯-
cantly less noise when stationary and when
being driven than vehicles with combustion
engines.
R When driving in electric mode, the vehicle may
not be heard by other road users due to the
signi̯cantly reduced noise generated.
It is for this reason that the vehicle is equip-
ped with a sound generator, which serves as
an acoustic vehicle warning system (AVAS).
R If not all of the vehicle conditions for electric
mode are met, then the combustion engine is
switched on.

Notes on the acoustic vehicle warning system:
R The sound generator generates speed-depend-
ent vehicle noise emissions when driving
forward or backing up at a speed of up to
around 30 km/h.
R This helps other road users, particularly
pedestrians and cyclists, to hear your vehicle
better.
R When driving at speeds above 20 km/h the

The higher the recuperation, the more sharply the
vehicle is braked when coasting and the more
electrical energy is fed into the high-voltage bat-
tery.
The deceleration in overrun mode may not be suf-
ficient depending on the driving conditions.
Decelerating to a standstill is not possible. Also
brake with the service brake if necessary. Always
adapt your speed to the driving conditions and
keep a su̱cient distance.
The recuperative brake system has the following
characteristics:
R supports braking with electronically controlled
brake force boosting
R converts the kinetic energy of the vehicle into
electric energy
% If you brake hard, the mechanical brake is
also used. This means that the maximum
recuperative energy cannot be recovered. The
more you drive and brake in an anticipatory
manner, the more e̱ciently energy can be
recuperated.
Syst

The braking e̮ect of the electric motor during
recuperation in overrun mode may be reduced or
may not be available at all in the following situa-
tions:
R when the high-voltage battery charge level
increases
R if the high-voltage battery is not yet at a nor-
mal operating temperature
In these cases, the desired deceleration is set by

ECO Assist is active only in drive programs A,

positions h or hÃ. Permanent manual gear-
shi͔ing p must be switched o̮ (/ page 191).
ECO Assist analyses data for the vehicle's expec-

adjust the driving style for the route ahead, save
fuel and recuperate.
ECO Assist is displayed on the Assistance
menu(/ page 285).

The following events 1 can be detected and dis-
played for the route section ahead:
R Vehicle in front
R Speed limit
R Downhill and uphill gradients
R Junctions and roundabouts
R Bends
The segments of distance display 2 show the
distance to the event ahead as follows:
R A few segments light up: the event ahead is
near.
R Many segments light up: the event ahead is
further away.
If ECO Assist is active, the "Foot o̮ the accelera-
tor" symbol 3 will appear on the instrument dis-
play and on the head-up display beside the trans-
mission position display.
When the vehicle nears an event, ECO Assist will
calculate the optimal speed for minimal energy
consumption based on the distance, speed and
gradient. The "Foot o̮ the accelerator" symbol 3
will appear on the instrument display.
If you take your foot o̮ the accelerator pedal in
good time, the remaining segments on the display
will successively turn green until the event shown
is reached. The drivetrain will be set for minimal
energy consumption. The vehicle will recuperate
autonomously and thus charge the battery.
% You can also manually increase or reduce the
recuperation in drive program Î. However,
ECO Assist is available only in the hÃ
setting (/ page 182).
If there is no response to the "Foot o̮ the accel-
erator" prompt 3, the segments will remain
white.
The event will be shown for a short time a͔er it
has been passed.
If the event involves a vehicle in front, the symbol
will be shown in green as soon as there is a
response to "Foot o̮ the accelerator" prompt 3.
If the system does not intervene during the event
ahead, nothing will be displayed. The system will
be passive.

ECO Assist can function even more precisely if
the route is adhered to when route guidance is
active. The basic function is also available without
active route guidance. Not all information and
tra̱c situations can be foreseen. The quality
depends on the map data.
ECO Assist is only an aid. The driver is responsible
for keeping a safe distance from the vehicle in
front, for vehicle speed and for braking in good
time. The driver must be ready to brake at all
times, irrespective of whether the system inter-
venes.
The system may be impaired or may not function
in the following situations:
R If visibility is poor, e.g. due to insu̱cient illu-
mination of the road, highly variable shade
conditions, rain, snow, fog or heavy spray.
R If there is glare, e.g. from oncoming tra̱c,

The route-based operating-mode strategy is active
only in drive programs A and ;. When
route guidance is active, data on the planned

If the function is active, data on the further course
of the route is evaluated. This includes, e.g. road
type, speed limitations and altitude data.
The hybrid system then adapts the operating
strategy to the further course of the route:
R Use of electrical energy and the combustion
engine are adapted.
R State of charge of the high-voltage battery is
controlled accordingly.
R Electrical energy is reserved especially for
electric mode, e.g. urban route sections.
R The vehicle automatically selects the operat-

The route-based operating-mode strategy is
switched to passive under the following condi-

TE High-voltage battery damage due to
leaving the vehicle idle for lengthy periods
of time
Lithium-ion batteries experience a natural self-
discharge.
Exhaustive discharging can therefore occur if
the vehicle is idle for several months. This can
damage the high-voltage battery.
# To avoid damage, please observe the fol-
lowing recommendations when handling
the high-voltage battery.
*
NOTE
TE Accelerated ageing of the high-volt-
age battery due to not observing the fol-
lowing recommendations
As a result of its basic characteristics, the
storage capacity of and the amount of energy
available from the high-voltage battery
decrease over the course of its life. As a
result, the maximum electrical range that can
be achieved by the vehicle is reduced and its
maximum electrical output can be impaired.
The following factors could accelerate the age-
ing of the high-voltage battery:
R a high level of charge, especially if the
vehicle is idle for a lengthy period of time
R leaving the vehicle idle for lengthy periods
at high ambient temperatures
# To avoid accelerated ageing, please
observe the following recommendations
when handling the high-voltage battery.
Recommendations when handling the high-voltage
battery:
R If leaving the vehicle idle for lengthy periods,
park up the vehicle with a high-voltage battery
charge level between 30% and 50%. Do not
keep the high-voltage battery continuously
connected to power supply equipment.

R If leaving the vehicle idle for lengthy periods of
time avoid, if possible, high ambient tempera-
tures.
R Check the high-voltage battery's charge level
every six weeks (/ page 212).
R Charge the high-voltage battery if the charge
level is below 20%.
R Do not disconnect the 12 V battery even if the
vehicle is le͔ idle for a lengthy period. Other-
wise, the condition of the vehicle's high-volt-
age battery cannot be monitored.
You can contribute to reducing the vehicle's

Your vehicle is equipped with driving systems
which assist you in driving, parking and manoeu-
vring the vehicle. The driving systems are only
aids. They are not a substitute for you paying
attention to your surroundings and do not relieve
you of your responsibility pertaining to road tra̱c
law. The driver is always responsible for maintain-
ing a safe distance to the vehicle in front, for vehi-
cle speed, for braking in good time and for staying
in lane. Pay attention to the tra̱c conditions at
all times and intervene when necessary. Be aware
of the limitations regarding the safe use of these
systems.
Driving systems can neither reduce the risk of
accident if you fail to adapt your driving style nor
override the laws of physics. They cannot always
take into account road, weather or tra̱c condi-

not be covered and the detection ranges around
them must be kept free. Do not attach additional
licence plate brackets, advertisements, stickers,

the detection range of the sensors and cameras.
Make sure that there are no overhanging loads
protruding into the detection range.
If there is damage to a bumper or the radiator

TTENTION ASSIST
Function of A
unction of ATTENTION ASSIST
TTENTION ASSIST
ATTENTION ASSIST assists you on long, monoto-
nous journeys, e.g. on motorways and trunk
roads. If ATTENTION ASSIST detects indicators of
fatigue or increasing lapses in concentration on
the part of the driver, it suggests taking a break.
ATTENTION ASSIST is only an aid. It cannot
always detect fatigue or lapses in concentration in
time. The system is not a substitute for a well-res-
ted and attentive driver. On long journeys, take
regular breaks in good time that allow for ade-
quate recuperation.
You can choose between two settings:
R St
Standar
andard:
d: normal system sensitivity.
R Sensitiv
Sensitive:
e: higher system sensitivity. The driver
is warned earlier and the attention level detec-
ted by ATTENTION ASSIST is adapted accord-
ingly.
If drowsiness or increasing lapses in concentra-
tion are detected, the ATTENTION ASSIST: Take
a break! warning appears in the Instrument Dis-
play. You can acknowledge the message and take
224
224
Driving and parking


a break where necessary. If you do not take a
break and ATTENTION ASSIST continues to detect
increasing lapses in concentration, you will be
warned again a͔er a minimum of 15 minutes.
You can have the following status information for
ATTENTION ASSIST displayed in the assistance
menu of the on-board computer:
R The length of the journey since the last break.
R The attention level determined by ATTENTION
ASSIST:
-
the fuller the circle, the higher the atten-
tion level determined
-
as your attention wanes, the circle in the
centre of the display becomes smaller
If ATTENTION ASSIST is unable to calculate the
attention level and cannot issue a warning, the
System suspended message appears.
If a warning is given in the Instrument Display, the
multimedia system o̮ers to search for a rest
area. You can select a rest area and start naviga-
tion to this rest area. This function can be activa-
ted and deactivated in the multimedia system.
If ATTENTION ASSIST is deactivated, the Û
symbol appears in the assistance graphic in the
Instrument Display. A͔er the vehicle is started,
ATTENTION ASSIST is automatically activated. The
last selected sensitivity level remains stored.
Syst

em limits
ATTENTION ASSIST is active in the 60 km/h to

Particularly in the following situations, ATTENTION
ASSIST only functions in a restricted manner and
warnings may be delayed or not occur:
R If you have been driving for less than approx-
imately 30 minutes.
R If the road condition is poor (uneven road sur-
face or potholes).
R If there is a strong side wind.
R If you adopt a sporty driving style (high corner-
ing speeds or high rates of acceleration).
R If Active Steering Assist is activated and active

R If the time has been set incorrectly.
R If you change lanes and vary your speed fre-
quently in active driving situations.
The ATTENTION ASSIST drowsiness or alertness
assessment is reset and restarted when continu-

Cruise control regulates the speed to the value
selected by the driver.
If you accelerate to overtake, forexample, the
stored speed is not deleted. If you remove your
foot from the accelerator pedal a͔er overtaking,
cruise control will resume speed regulation back
to the stored speed.
You can store any speed above 20 km/h up to the
maximum design speed or up to the set winter
tyre limit.
Observe the notes on driving systems and your
responsibility; you may otherwise fail to recognise

Cruise control may be unable to maintain the
stored speed on uphill gradients. The stored
speed is resumed when the gradient evens out.
Change into a lower gear in good time on long and
steep downhill gradients. Take particular note of
this when driving a laden vehicle. By doing so, you
will make use of the engine's braking e̮ect. This
relieves the load on the brake system and pre-
vents the brakes from overheating and wearing
too quickly.
Do not use cruise control in the following situa-
tions:
R in tra̱c situations which require frequent
changes of speed, e.g. in heavy tra̱c, on
winding roads
R on slippery roads. Accelerating can cause the
drive wheels to lose traction and the vehicle
could then skid.

the vehicle is level with the tra̱c sign.
If there is no speed restriction on an unlimited
stretch of road (e.g. on a motorway), the recom-
mended speed is automatically adopted as the
stored speed. The system uses the speed stored
on an unlimited stretch of road as the recommen-
ded speed. If you do not alter the stored speed on
an unlimited stretch of road, the recommended
speed is 130 km/h.
If Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC has been put
into passive mode by pressing the accelerator
pedal, only speed limits which are higher than the
set speed are adopted.

Speed limits below 20 km/h are not automatically
adopted by the system as the stored speed. Tem-

WARNING
ARNING Risk of accident due to Active
Speed Limit Assist adapting the vehicle's
speed
The speed adopted by Active Speed Limit
Assist may be too high or incorrect in some
individual cases, such as:
R at speed limits below 20 km/h
R in wet conditions or in fog
R when towing a trailer
# Ensure that the driven speed complies
with tra̱c regulations.
# Adjust the driving speed to suit current
tra̱c and weather conditions.
Function of r
unction of rout
oute-based speed adapt
e-based speed adaptation
ation
When Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC is activa-
ted, the vehicle speed will be adapted accordingly
to the route events ahead. Depending on the drive
program selected, the vehicle negotiates a route
event ahead in an economical, comfortable or
dynamic manner. When the route event has been
passed, the vehicle accelerates again to the
stored speed. The set distance to the vehicle in
front, vehicles detected ahead and speed restric-
tions ahead are taken into account.
You can activate and deactivate route-based
speed adaptation in the multimedia system
(/ page 236).
The following route events are taken into account:
R Bends
R T-junctions, roundabouts and toll stations
R Turns and exits
R Tra̱c jams ahead (only with Live Tra̱c Infor-
mation )
% When the toll station is reached, Active Dis-
tance Assist DISTRONIC adopts the speed as
the stored speed.
Also, the speed is reduced if the turn signal indi-
cator to change lanes is switched on and one of
the following situations is detected:
R Turning at junctions
R Driving on slowing-down lanes
R Driving on lanes adjacent to slowing-down
lanes
The driver is responsible for choosing the right
speed and observing other road users. This
applies in particular to junctions, roundabouts and
tra̱c lights, as route-based speed adaptation
does not brake the vehicle to a standstill.
When route guidance is active, the ̯rst speed
adjustment is carried out automatically. If the turn
signal indicator is switched on, the selected route
is con̯rmed and further speed adjustment is acti-
vated.

Speed adaptation is cancelled in the following
cases:
R If the turn signal indicator is switched o̮
before the route event.
R If the driver depresses the accelerator or
brake pedal during the process.
Syst
System limits
em limits
Route-based speed adaptation does not take right
of way regulations into account. The driver is
responsible for complying with road tra̱c regula-
tions and driving at a suitable speed.
The speed adaptation made by the system may
not always be suitable, particularly in the following
situations:
R the road's course not clearly visible
R Road narrowing
R varying maximum permissible speeds in indi-
vidual lanes, forexample at toll stations
R wet road surfaces, snow or ice
R when towing a trailer
In these situations the driver must intervene
accordingly.

Blind Spot Assist and Active Blind Spot Assist use
two lateral, rear-facing radar sensors to monitor
the area up to 40 m behind and 3 m next to your
vehicle.
If a vehicle is detected at speeds above approx-
imately 12 km/h and this vehicle subsequently
enters the monitoring range directly next to your
vehicle, the warning lamp in the outside mirror
lights up red.

If a vehicle is detected close to your vehicle and
you switch on the turn signal indicator in the cor-
responding direction, a double warning tone
sounds and the red warning lamp in the outside
mirror ̰ashes. If the turn signal indicator remains
switched on, all other detected vehicles are indi-
cated only by the ̰ashing of the red warning
lamp.
If you overtake a vehicle quickly, no warning is
given.

WARNING
ARNING Risk of accident despite Active
Blind Spot Assist
Active Blind Spot Assist does not react to the
following:
R if you overtake a vehicle too closely so that
it is in the blind spot area
R if vehicles travelling at a much faster
speed approach and then overtake
Active Blind Spot Assist may not give warnings
or intervene in such situations.
# Always pay careful attention to the tra̱c
situation and maintain a safe distance at
the side of the vehicle.
Observe the notes on driving systems and your
responsibility; you may otherwise fail to recognise
dangers (/ page 217).

approaching vehicles when leaving the vehicle
when stationary.
&
WARNING
ARNING Risk of accident despite exit
warning
The exit warning neither reacts to stationary
objects nor to persons or road users
approaching you at a greatly di̮ering speed.
The exit warning cannot warn drivers in these
situations.
# Always pay particular attention to the
tra̱c situation when opening the doors
and make sure there is su̱cient clear-
ance.
If there is a vehicle in the monitoring range, this is
indicated in the outside mirror. If a vehicle occu-
pant opens the door on the side with the warning,
a warning tone sounds and the warning lamp in
the outside mirror starts to ̰ash.
This additional function is only available when
Blind Spot Assist is active. When the exit warning
is activated, it can warn vehicle occupants for up
to three minutes a͔er switching the vehicle o̮.
The exit warning is no longer available once the
warning lamp in the outside mirror ̰ashes three
times.
The exit warning is only an aid and not a substi-
tute for the attention of vehicle occupants. The
responsibility for opening and closing the doors
and for leaving the vehicle remains with the vehi-
cle occupants.

A course-correcting brake application cannot
always prevent a collision.
# Always steer, brake or accelerate your-
self, especially if Active Blind Spot Assist
warns you or makes a course-correcting
brake application.
# Always maintain a safe distance at the
sides.
If a course-correcting brake application occurs,
the red warning lamp ̰ashes in the outside mirror
and a warning tone sounds. In addition, display
1 indicating the danger of a side collision
appears in the Instrument Display.
In rare cases, the system may make an inappro-
priate brake application. This brake application
may be interrupted at any time if you steer slightly
in the opposite direction or accelerate.

Active Lane Keeping Assist monitors the area in
front of your vehicle by means of the multifunction
camera (/ page 218). It serves to protect you
against unintentionally leaving your lane. You will
be warned by vibration pulses in the steering
wheel and guided by a course-correcting brake
application back into your lane.
Active Lane Keeping Assist is available in the
speed range between 60 km/h and 200 km/h.
Active Lane Keeping Assist can neither reduce the
risk of an accident if you fail to adapt your driving
style nor override the laws of physics. It cannot
take into account road, weather or tra̱c condi-
tions. Active Lane Keeping Assist is only an aid.
You are responsible for maintaining a safe dis-
tance to the vehicle in front, for vehicle speed, for
braking in good time and for staying in lane.
The status of Active Lane Keeping Assist is dis-
played in the on-board computer:
R Ã (green): Active Lane Keeping Assist is
active and operating.
R Ã (grey): Active Lane Keeping Assist is
active but not operating.
R ·: Active Lane Keeping Assist is deactiva-

with variable damping for improved driving com-
fort. The all-round level control system ensures
the best possible suspension and constant ground
clearance, even with a laden vehicle. When driving
at speed, the vehicle is lowered automatically to
improve driving safety and to reduce fuel con-
sumption. You also have the option of manually
adjusting the vehicle level.
AIR BODY CONTROL includes the following com-
ponents and functions:
R Air suspension with variable spring rate

Parking Assist PARKTRONIC is an electronic park-
ing assistance system which monitors the area
surrounding your vehicle and shows you the dis-
tance between the vehicle and a detected obsta-
cle visually and audibly.
Parking Assist PARKTRONIC is only an aid. It is
not a substitute for your attention to the surround-
ings. The responsibility for safe manoeuvring and
parking remains with you. Make sure that there
are no persons, animals or objects in the manoeu-
vring area while manoeuvring and parking in/exit-
ing parking spaces.
The passive side impact protection also warns you
of obstacles to the side. During the parking proce-
dure or manoeuvring, objects are detected as the
vehicle drives past. If you steer in the direction of
a detected obstacle and there is a risk of a lateral
collision, a warning is issued. In order for an
object on the side to be detected, the sensors in
the front and rear bumper must ̯rst detect the
object while you are driving past it.
In order for front or rear obstacles to the side to
be displayed, the vehicle must ̯rst travel a dis-
tance of at least half a vehicle length. Once the
vehicle has travelled one vehicle length, obstacles
on all sides can be shown.

Active Parking Assist is an electronic parking
assistance system, which uses ultrasound with
the assistance of the reversing camera and 360°
Camera. When you are driving forwards up to
approximately 35 km/h, the system automatically
measures parking spaces on both sides of the
vehicle.
Active Parking Assist o̮ers the following func-
tions:

R Exiting parking spaces if you have parked
using Active Parking Assist
As soon as all requirements are met for searching
for parking spaces, the Ç display appears in
the Instrument Display.
When Active Parking Assist has detected parking
spaces, the È display appears in the Instru-
ment Display. The arrows show on which side of
the road detected parking spaces are located.
They are then shown in the media display.

When Active Parking Assist is activated, the turn
signal indicators are activated based on the calcu-
lated path of your vehicle.
The parking procedure is assisted by accelerating,
braking, steering and gear changes.
Active Parking Assist is only an aid. It is not a sub-
stitute for your attention to the surroundings. The
responsibility for safe manoeuvring and parking
remains with you. Make sure that no persons, ani-
mals or objects etc. are in the manoeuvring

during measurement of the parking space. These
are also then not taken into account when calcu-
lating the parking procedure. In some circumstan-

# In these situations, do not use Active
Parking Assist.
Extreme weather conditions, suchas snow or
heavy rain, may lead to a parking space being
measured inaccurately. Parking spaces that are
partially occupied by trailer drawbars might not be
identi̯ed as such or be measured incorrectly.
Only use Active Parking Assist on level, high-grip
ground.
Do not use Active Parking Assist in the following
situations:
R In extreme weather conditions suchas ice,
packed snow or in heavy rain.
R When transporting a load that protrudes
beyond the vehicle.
R On steep uphill or downhill gradients of more
than approximately 15 %.
R When snow chains are ̯tted.
R When a trailer or bicycle rack is attached.
R Directly a͔er a tyre change or when spare
tyres are ̯tted.
R If the tyre pressure is too low or too high.
R If the suspension is out of alignment, e.g. a͔er

or
# To activate the straightening manoeuvre:

The system calculates the articulation angle in
such a way that the direction of the trailer at
the time of activation is maintained. There is a
short countersteering movement of the trailer
while the vehicle is reversed, which then
guides it back to the desired line. In this way,
the vehicle is aligned straight with the trailer
and, at the same time, the direction of the
trailer is maintained.
# Accelerate and brake as required.
% The maximum articulation angle depends on
the length of the trailer. This is calculated by
the system by driving the vehicle forwards,
including cornering. Before the length of the
trailer has been calculated, the maximum
articulation angle is approximately 23°. The
longer the trailer is, the higher the maximum
articulation angle (max. approximately 60°).

# Observe the applicable legal regulations
for the installation of trailer hitches.
Trailer hitch (example with additional guide pin)
Depending on the bicycle rack's design, di̮erent
numbers of bicycles can be transported.
The following bicycle rack designs are possible:
R When mounted by attaching to ball head 1,
the maximum load capacity is 75 kg. You can
transport up to three bicycles.
R When mounted on ball head 1 and guide pin
2, the maximum load capacity is 100 kg. You
can transport up to four bicycles.
The maximum load capacity is calculated from the
weight of the bicycle rack and the bicycle rack
load.
Observe the notes on driving with a roof load,
trailer or fully laden vehicle (/ page 175).
When using a bicycle rack, set the tyre pressure
for increased load on the rear axle of the vehicle.
Further information on the tyre pressure can be
found in the tyre pressure table (/ page 379).
No
otes on loading
es on loading
The larger the distance between the load's centre
of gravity and the ball head, the greater the load
on the trailer hitch.
Observe the following notes:

as possible
R always distribute the load on the bicycle rack
as evenly as possible across the vehicle's lon-
gitudinal axis

Driving and parking


Mercedes-Benz recommends removing all detach-
able parts from bicycles (e.g. baskets, child seats,
batteries) before loading them onto the bicycle
rack. This will improve the aerodynamic resist-
ance and centre of gravity of the bicycle rack.
Always secure the bicycles to prevent them from
moving around and check them at regular inter-
vals to ensure that they are secure.
Do not use tarpaulins or other covers. The driving
characteristics and rear view may be impaired. In
addition, aerodynamic resistance and the load on
the trailer hitch will increase.
Load distribution on the bicycle rack
1 Vertical distance between centre of gravity
and ball head
2 Horizontal distance between centre of gravity
and ball head
3 The centre of gravity is on the vehicle's cen-

WARNING
ARNING Risk of becoming trapped dur-
ing adjustment of the driver's seat a͔er
calling up a driver pro̯le
Selecting a user pro̯le may trigger an adjust-
ment of the driver's seat to the position saved
under the user pro̯le. You or other vehicle
occupants could be injured in the process.
# Make sure that when the position of the
driver's seat is being adjusted via the
multimedia system, no people or body
parts are in the seat's range of move-
ment.
If there is a risk of someone becoming trap-
ped, stop the adjustment process immedi-
ately:
# a) Tap the warning message on the
media display.
or
# b) Press a memory function position but-
ton or a seat adjustment switch on the
driver's door.
The adjustment process will be stopped.
The driver's seat is equipped with an access pre-
venter.
If the driver's door is open, the driver's seat will
not
not be set a͔er calling up the driver's pro̯le.
Pro̯les store your vehicle settings and settings
for the multimedia system. If the vehicle is used
by several drivers, the driver can select their own
pro̯le without changing the stored pro̯le settings
of other drivers.
% Information on pro̯les from Mercedes me

For recurring driving situations, such as long
drives on the motorway, you can save your prefer-
red settings in a theme in the vehicle. In a theme
you can save the display of the digital map, your
preferred radio station and preferred drive pro-
gram, for example.
The vehicle can learn the habits of the driver. It

navigation destinations, media sources, radio sta-
tions or contacts. The pre-requirements for that
are the selection of a pro̯le, your consent to the
recording of data and su̱cient collected data.

objects within.
There is a risk of injury, particularly in the
event of sudden braking or a sudden change
in direction.
# Always stow objects so that they cannot
be thrown around in such situations.
# Always make sure that objects do not
protrude from stowage spaces, luggage
nets or stowage nets.

R Remove dirt as soon as possible. Avoid rub-
bing too hard in order to not irreparably dam-
age the decorative foil.
R If there is dirt on the ̯nish or if the decorative
foil is dull: Use the Paint Cleaner recommen-
ded and approved for Mercedes-Benz.
R Insect remains: Soak with insect remover and
rinse o̮ the treated areas a͔erwards.

WARNING
ARNING Risk of accident due to insu̱-
cient or excessive tyre pressure
Underin̰ated or overin̰ated tyres pose in par-
ticular the following risks:
R The tyres can burst.
R The tyres can wear excessively and/or
unevenly.
R The driving characteristics as well as the
steering and braking characteristics may
be greatly impaired.
# Comply with the recommended tyre
pressure and check the tyre pressure of
all tyres, including the spare wheel, regu-
larly:
R monthly
R when the load changes
R before embarking on a longer journey
R if operating conditions change, e.g. o̮-
road driving
# Adjust the tyre pressure, if necessary.
Tyre pressure which is too high or too low can:
R Shorten the service life of the tyres.
R Cause increased tyre damage.
R Adversely a̮ect driving characteristics and
thus driving safety, e.g. due to aquaplaning.

WARNING
ARNING Risk of accident due to repea-
ted pressure drop in the tyres
The wheels, valves or tyres could be damaged.
Too low a tyre pressure can lead to the tyres
bursting.
# Examine the tyres for foreign objects.
# Check whether the tyre has a puncture
or the valve has a leak.
# If you are unable to rectify the damage,
contact a quali̯ed specialist workshop.
Information on the recommended tyre pressure
for the vehicle's factory-̯tted tyres can be found
on the tyre pressure table on the inside of the fuel
̯ller ̰ap (/ page 379).
Use a suitable pressure gauge to check the tyre
pressure. The outer appearance of a tyre does not
permit any reliable conclusion about the tyre pres-
sure.
Only correct tyre pressures when the tyres are
cold. Conditions for cold tyres:
R The vehicle has been parked with the tyres out
of direct sunlight for at least three hours.
R The vehicle has travelled less than 1.6 km.
The vehicle's tyres heat up when driving. As the
temperature of the tyres increases, so too does
the tyre pressure.

means of a tyre pressure sensor.
The tyre pressure and the tyre temperature
appear in the on-board computer (/ page 380).
If there is a substantial pressure loss or if the tyre

The tyre pressure monitoring system is only an
aid. It is the driver's responsibility to set the tyre
pressure to the recommended cold tyre pressure

TE Vehicle and tyre damage caused by
non-approved tyre types and sizes
For safety reasons, only use tyres, wheels and
accessories which have been specially
approved by Mercedes-Benz for your vehicle.
These tyres are specially adapted to the active
safety systems, such as ABS, ESP® and
4MATIC, and marked as follows:
R MO = Mercedes-Benz Original
R MOE = Mercedes-Benz Original Extended
(run-̰at tyres only for certain wheels)
R MO1 = Mercedes-Benz Original (only cer-
tain AMG tyres)
Otherwise, certain properties, such as han-
dling characteristics, vehicle noise emissions,
consumption, etc. could be adversely a̮ec-
ted. Furthermore, other tyre sizes could result
in the tyres rubbing against the body and axle
components when loaded. This could result in
damage to the tyre or the vehicle.
Only use tyres, wheels and accessories that
have been checked and recommended by
Mercedes-Benz.

WARNING
ARNING Risk of accident with high per-
formance tyres
The special tyre tread in combination with the
optimised tyre compound means that the risk
of skidding and hydroplaning on wet roads is
increased.
In addition, the tyre grip is greatly reduced at
a low outside temperature and tyre running
temperature.
# Switch on the ESP® and adapt your driv-
ing style accordingly.
# Use i M+S tyres at outside tempera-
tures of less than 10 °C.
# Only use the tyres for their intended pur-
pose.
