3 Description
The MCT8316A-Q1 provides a single-chip, code-free 
sensorless trapezoidal device for customers requiring 
high speed operation (up to 3kHz electrical) or very 
fast startup time (<50ms) for 12 to 24V brushless-
DC motors up to 8A peak current. The MCT8316A-
Q1 integrates three 1/2-H bridges with 40V absolute 
maximum capability and a very low RDS(ON) of 95mΩ 
(high-side + low-side). Power management features 
of an adjustable buck regulator and LDO generate the 
3.3V or 5.0V voltage rails for the device and can be 
used to power external circuits.
Sensorless trapezoidal control is highly configurable 
ranging from motor start-up behavior to closed loop 
operation through register settings. These settings 
can be saved in non-volatile EEPROM, which allows 
the device to operate stand-alone once the device 
has been configured. The device receives a speed 
command through a PWM input, analog voltage, 
variable frequency square wave or I2C command. 
There are a large number of protection features 
integrated into the MCT8316A-Q1, intended to protect 
the device, motor, and system against fault events.

Operation outside the Absolute Maximum Ratings may cause permanent device damage. Absolute Maximum Ratings do not imply 
functional operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those listed under Recommended Operating Conditions. 
If used outside the Recommended Operating Conditions but within the Absolute Maximum Ratings, the device may not be fully 
functional, and this may affect device reliability, functionality, performance, and shorten the device lifetime

All values referred to VIH(min) and VIL(max) levels 
(2)
tHD_DAT is the data hold time that is measured from the falling edge of SCL, applies to data in transmission and the acknowledge.
(3)
A device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA signal (with respect to the VIH(min) of the SCL signal) to 
bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.
(4)
The maximum tHD_DAT could be 3.45 us and 0.9 µs for Standard-mode and Fast-mode, but must be less than the maximum of tVD_DAT 
or tVD_ACK by a transistion time. This maximum must only be met if the device does not stretch the LOW period (tLOW) of the SCL 
signal. If the clock stretched the SCL, the data must be valid by the set-up time before it releases the clock.
(5)
A fast-mode I2C-bus device can be used in a standard-mode I2C-bus system, but the requirement tSU_DAT 250 ns must then be met. 
This will automatically be the case if the device does not stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal. If such a device does stretch the 
LOW period if the SCL signal, it must output the next data bit to the SDA line tr(max) + tSU_DAT = 1000 + 250 = 1250 ns (according to the 
standard-mode I2C-bus specification) before the SCL line is released. Also the acknowledge timing must meet this set-up time.
(6)
If mixed with HS-mode devices, faster fall times according to Table 10 are allowed.
(7)
The maximum tf for the SDA and SCL bus lines is specified at 300 ns. The maximum fall time for the SDA output stage tf is specified 
at 250 ns. This allows series protection resistors to be connected in between the SDA and the SCL pins and the SDA/SCL bus lines 
without exceeding the maximum specified tf.
(8)
In Fast-mode Plus, fall time is specified the same for both output stage and bus timing. If series resistors are used, designers should 
allow for this when considering bus timing.
(9)
The maximum bus capacitance allowable may vary from the value depending on the actual operating voltage and frequency of the 
application.
(10)
tVD_DAT = time for data signal from SCL LOW to SDA output (HIGH or LOW, depending on which one is worse).
(11)
tVD_ACK = time for acknowledgement signal from SCL LOW to SDA output (HIGH or LOW, dependging on which one is worse).

6 Detailed Description
6.1 Overview
The MCT8316A-Q1 provides a single-chip, code-free sensorless trapezoidal solution for customers requiring 
high speed operation (up to 3 kHz electrical speed) or very fast startup time (< 50ms) for 12- to 24-V brushless-
DC motors requiring up to 8-A peak phase currents.
The MCT8316A-Q1 integrates three 1/2-H bridges with 40-V absolute maximum capability and a very low 
RDS(ON) of 95-mΩ (high-side + low-side) to enable high power drive capability. Current is sensed using an 
integrated current sensing circuit which eliminates the need for external sense resistors. Power management 
features of an adjustable buck regulator and LDO generate the necessary voltage rails for the device and can be 
used to power external circuits.
Sensorless trapezoidal control is highly configurable ranging from motor start-up behavior to closed loop 
operation through register settings. These settings can be stored in non-volatile EEPROM, which allows the 
device to operate stand-alone once it has been configured. MCT8316A-Q1 allows for a high level of monitoring; 
any variable in the algorithm can be displayed and observed as an analog output via two 12-bit DACs. This 
feature provides an effective method to tune speed loops as well as motor acceleration. The device receives a 
speed command through a PWM input, analog voltage, frequency input or I2C command.
In-built protection features include power-supply undervoltage lockout (UVLO), charge-pump undervoltage 
lockout (CPUV), overcurrent protection (OCP), AVDD undervoltage lockout (AVDD_UV), buck regulator UVLO, 
motor lock detection and overtemperature warning and shutdown (OTW and TSD). Fault events are indicated by 
the nFAULT pin with detailed fault information available in the registers.
The MCT8316A-Q1 device is available in a 0.5-mm pin pitch, wettable flank VQFN surface-mount package. The 
VQFN package size is 7 mm × 5 mm with a height of 1 mm.

6.3 Feature Description
6.3.1 Output Stage
The MCT8316A-Q1 consists of an integrated 95-mΩ (combined high-side and low-side FETs' on-state 
resistance) NMOS FETs connected in a three-phase bridge configuration. A doubler charge pump provides 
the proper gate-bias voltage to the high-side NMOS FETs across a wide operating-voltage range in addition to 
providing 100% duty-cycle support. An internal linear regulator provides the gate-bias voltage for the low-side 
MOSFETs.
6.3.2 Device Interface Modes
The MCT8316A-Q1 supports I2C interface to provide end application design with adequate flexibility. 
MCT8316A-Q1 allows controlling the motor operation and system through BRAKE, DIR, DRVOFF, EXT_CLK, 
EXT_WD and SPEED/WAKE . MCT8316A-Q1 also provides different signals for monitoring algorithm variables, 
speed, fault and phase current feedback through DACOUT1, DACOUT2, FG, nFAULT and SOX.
6.3.2.1 Interface - Control and Monitoring
Motor Control Signals
•
When BRAKE pin is driven 'High', MCT8316A-Q1 enters brake state. Low-side braking (see Low-Side 
Braking) is implemented during this brake state. MCT8316A-Q1 decreases output speed to value defined by 
BRAKE_DUTY_THRESHOLD before entering brake state. As long as BRAKE is driven 'High', MCT8316A-
Q1 stays in brake state. Brake pin input can be overwritten by configuring BRAKE_INPUT over the I2C 
interface.
•
The DIR pin decides the direction of motor spin; when driven 'High', the sequence is OUT A → OUT C → 
OUT B, and when driven 'Low' the sequence is OUT A → OUT B → OUT C. DIR pin input can be overwritten 
by configuring DIR_INPUT over the I2C interface.
•
When DRVOFF pin is driven 'High', MCT8316A-Q1 stops driving the motor by turning OFF all MOSFETs 
(coast state). When DRVOFF is driven 'Low', MCT8316A-Q1 returns to normal state of operation, as if it 
was restarting the motor (see DRVOFF Functionality). DRVOFF does not cause the device to go to sleep or 
standby mode; the digital core is still active. Entry and exit from sleep or standby condition is controlled by 
SPEED pin.
•
SPEED/WAKE pin is used to control motor speed and wake up MCT8316A-Q1 from sleep mode. SPEED pin 
can be configured to accept PWM, frequency or analog input signals. It is used to enter and exit from sleep 
and standby mode (see Table 6-3).
External Oscillator and Watchdog Signals (Optional)
•
EXT_CLK pin may be used to provide an external clock reference (see External Clock Source).
•
EXT_WD pin may be used to provide an external watchdog signal (see External Watchdog).
Output Signals
•
DACOUT1 outputs internal variable defined by address in register DACOUT1_VAR_ADDR, the output of 
DACOUT1 is refreshed every PWM cycle (see DAC outputs).
•
DACOUT2 outputs internal variable defined by address in register DACOUT2_VAR_ADDR, the output of 
DACOUT2 is refreshed every PWM cycle (see DAC outputs).
•
FG pin provides pulses which are proportional to motor speed (see FG Configuration).
•
nFAULT pin provides fault status in device or motor operation.
•
SOX pin provides the output of one of the current sense amplifiers.
6.3.2.2 I2C Interface
The MCT8316A-Q1 supports an I2C serial communication interface that allows an external controller to send and 
receive data. This I2C interface lets the external controller configure the EEPROM and read detailed fault and 
motor state information. The I2C bus is a two-wire interface using the SCL and SDA pins which are described as 
follows:
•
The SCL pin is the clock signal input.
•
The SDA pin is the data input and output.

6.3.3 Step-Down Mixed-Mode Buck Regulator
The MCT8316A-Q1 has an integrated mixed-mode buck regulator in conjunction with AVDD to supply regulated 
3.3 V or 5 V power for an external controller or system voltage rail. Additionally, the buck output can also be 
configured to 4 V or 5.7 V for supporting the extra headroom for external LDO for generating a 3.3 V or 5 V 
supplies. The output voltage of the buck is set by BUCK_SEL.
The buck regulator has a low quiescent current of ~1-2 mA during light loads to prolong battery life. The device 
improves performance during line and load transients by implementing a pulse-frequency current-mode control 
scheme which requires less output capacitance and simplifies frequency compensation design.

6.3.3.1 Buck in Inductor Mode
The buck regulator in MCT8316A-Q1 is primarily designed to support low inductance of 47-µH and 22-µH. A 
47-µH inductor allows the buck regulator to operate up to 170-mA load current support, whereas applications 
requiring current up to 20-mA can use a 22-µH inductor which saves component size.
Figure 6-2 shows the connection of buck regulator in inductor mode.

6.3.3.2 Buck in Resistor mode
If the external load requirement is less than 10-mA, the inductor can be replaced with a resistor. In resistor mode 
the power is dissipated across the external resistor and the efficiency is lower than buck in inductor mode.

6.3.3.3 Buck Regulator with External LDO
The buck regulator also supports the voltage requirement to supply an external LDO to generate standard 3.3-V 
or 5-V output rail with higher accuracies. The buck output voltage should be configured to 4-V or 5.7-V to provide 
extra headroom to support the external LDO for generating 3.3-V or 5-V rail as shown in Figure 6-4. This allows 
for a lower-voltage LDO design to save cost and better thermal management due to low drop-out voltage.

The AVDD LDO has an option of using the power supply from mixed mode buck regulator to reduce the 
device power dissipation. The power sequencing mode allows on-the-fly changeover of AVDD LDO input from 
DC mains (VM) to buck output (VBK) as shown in Figure 6-5. This sequencing can be configured through the 
BUCK_PS_DIS bit . Power sequencing is supported only when buck output voltage is set to 5-V or 5.7-V.

6.3.3.5 Mixed Mode Buck Operation and Control
The buck regulator implements a pulse frequency modulation (PFM) architecture with peak current mode control. 
The output voltage of the buck regulator is compared with the internal reference voltage (VBK_REF) which is 
internally generated depending on the buck-output voltage setting (BUCK_SEL) which constitutes an outer 
voltage control loop. Depending on the comparator output going high (VBK < VBK_REF) or low (VBK > VBK_REF), 
the high-side power FET of the buck turns on and off respectively. An independent current control loop monitors 
the current in high-side power FET (IBK) and turns off the high-side FET when the current becomes higher than 
the buck current limit (IBK_CL). This implements a current limit control for the buck regulator. Figure 6-6 shows the 
architecture of the buck and various control/protection loops.

6.3.3.6 Buck Undervoltage Protection
If at any time the voltage on the FB_BK pin (buck regulator output) falls lower than the VBK_UVLO threshold, 
both the high-side and low-side MOSFETs of the buck regulator are disabled . MCT8316A-Q1 goes into reset 
state whenever buck UV event occurs, since the internal circuitry in MCT8316A-Q1 is powered from the buck 
regulator output.
6.3.3.7 Buck Overcurrent Protection
The buck overcurrent event is sensed by monitoring the current flowing through high-side MOSFET of the buck 
regulator. If the current through the high-side MOSFET exceeds the IBK_OCP threshold for a time longer than the 
deglitch time (tOCP_DEG), a buck OCP event is recognized. MCT8316A-Q1 goes into reset state whenever buck 
OCP event occurs, since the internal circuitry in MCT8316A-Q1 is powered from the buck regulator output.
6.3.4 AVDD Linear Voltage Regulator
A 3.3-V, linear regulator is integrated into the MCT8316A-Q1 family of devicesand is available for use by external 
circuitry. The AVDD LDO regulator is used for powering up the internal circuitry of the device and additionally, 
this regulator can also provide the supply voltage for a low-power MCU or other circuitry supporting low current 
(up to 20-mA). The output of the AVDD regulator should be bypassed near the AVDD pin with a X5R or X7R, 
1-µF, 6.3-V ceramic capacitor routed directly back to the adjacent AGND ground pin.
The AVDD nominal, no-load output voltage is 3.3-V.

6.3.5 Charge Pump
Since the output stages use N-channel FETs, the device requires a gate-drive voltage higher than the VM power 
supply to turn-on the high-side FETs. The MCT8316A-Q1 integrates a charge-pump circuit that generates a 
voltage above the VM supply for this purpose.
The charge pump requires two external capacitors(CCP, CFLY) for operation. See the block diagram and pin 
descriptions for details on these capacitors (value, connection, and so forth).

6.3.6 Slew Rate Control
An adjustable gate-drive current control for the MOSFETs in the output stage is provided to achieve configurable 
slew rate for EMI mitigation. The MOSFET VDS slew rate is a critical factor for optimizing radiated emissions, 
total energy and duration of diode recovery spikes and switching voltage transients related to parasitic elements 
of the PCB. This slew rate is predominantly determined by the control of the internal MOSFET gate current as 
shown in Figure 6-9.

6.3.7 Cross Conduction (Dead Time)
The device is fully protected against any cross conduction of the MOSFETs. The high-side and low-side 
MOSFETs are carefully controlled to avoid any shoot-through events by inserting a dead time (tdead). This is 
implemented by sensing the gate-source voltage (VGS) of the high-side and low-side MOSFETs and ensuring 
that the VGS of high-side MOSFET has reached below turn-off levels before switching on the low-side MOSFET 
of same half-bridge as shown in Figure 6-11 and Figure 6-12 and vice versa.

6.3.8 SPEED Control
The MCT8316A-Q1 offers four methods of directly controlling the speed of the motor. The speed control method 
is configured by SPD_CTRL_MODE. The speed command can be controlled in one of the following four ways.
•
PWM input on SPEED pin by varying duty cycle of input signal
•
Frequency input on SPEED pin by varying frequency of input signal
•
Analog input on SPEED pin by varying amplitude of input signal
•
Over I2C by configuring SPEED_CTRL
The speed can also be indirectly controlled by varying the supply voltage (VM).

When speed loop is enabled, DUTY CMD sets the SPEED REF in Hz. MAX_SPEED sets the SPEED REF at 
DUTY CMD of 100%. MIN_DUTY sets the minimum SPEED REF (MIN_DUTY x MAX_SPEED). SPEED REF 
stays clamped at (MIN_DUTY x MAX_SPEED) for ZERO_DUTY_THR < DUTY CMD < MIN_DUTY.
When speed loop is disabled, DUTY CMD sets the TARGET DUTY in % - TARGET DUTY is 100% when DUTY 
CMD is 100% and TARGET DUTY is equal to MIN_DUTY when DUTY CMD is set to MIN_DUTY. TARGET 
DUTY stays clamped at MIN DUTY for ZERO_DUTY_THR < DUTY CMD < MIN_DUTY.
ZERO_DUTY_THR sets the DUTY CMD below which SPEED REF/ TARGET DUTY (speed loop enabled/
disabled) is set to zero and motor is in stopped state. AVS, CL_ACC configure the transient characteristics of 
DUTY OUT; the steady state value of DUTY OUT is directly configured in % through TARGET DUTY (when 
speed loop is disabled) or through SPEED REF (when speed loop is enabled).
6.3.8.1 Analog-Mode Speed Control
Analog input based speed control can be configured by setting SPD_CTRL_MODE to 00b. In this mode, the duty 
command (DUTY CMD) varies with the analog voltage input on the SPEED pin(VSPEED). When 0 < VSPEED < 
VEN_SB, DUTY CMD is set to zero and the motor is stopped. When VEN_SB < VSPEED < VANA_FS, DUTY CMD 
varies linearly with VSPEED as shown in Figure 6-15 . When VSPEED > VANA_FS, DUTY CMD is clamped to 100%.

6.3.8.2 PWM-Mode Speed Control
PWM based speed control can be configured by setting SPD_CTRL_MODE to 01b. In this mode, the PWM 
duty cycle applied to the SPEED pin can be varied from 0 to 100% and duty command (DUTY CMD) varies 
linearly with the applied PWM duty cycle. DUTY CMD is set to zero and the motor is stopped when the 
PWM signal at SPEED pin stays < VDIG_IL for longer than tEN_SB_PWM. The frequency of the PWM input signal 
applied to the SPEED pin is defined as fPWM and the range for this frequency can be configured through 
SPD_PWM_RANGE_SELECT.
Note
fPWM is the frequency of the PWM signal the device can accept at SPEED pin to control motor speed. 
It does not correspond to the PWM output frequency that is applied to the motor phases. The PWM 
output frequency can be configured through PWM_FREQ_OUT (see Section 6.3.15).

6.3.8.3 I2C based Speed Control
I2C based serial interface can be used for speed control by setting SPD_CTRL_MODE to 10b. In this mode, the 
duty command can be written directly into SPEED_CTRL. If SPEED pin input is < VEN_SL for a time longer than 
SLEEP_TIME and SPEED_CTRL is set to zero, MCT8316A-Q1 enters sleep state. When SPEED pin > VEX_SL, 
MCT8316A-Q1 exits sleep state and speed is controlled through SPEED_CTRL. If SPEED_CTRL is set to zero 
and SPEED pin > VEX_SL, MCT8316A-Q1 is in standby state.
6.3.8.4 Frequency-Mode Speed Control
Frequency based speed control is configured by setting SPD_CTRL_MODE to 11b. In this mode, duty command 
varies linearly as a function of the frequency of the square wave input at SPEED pin as given in Equation 
4. Input frequency greater than INPUT_MAX_FREQUENCY clamps the duty command to 100%. The duty 
command is set to zero and the motor is stopped when the frequency signal at SPEED pin stays < VDIG_IL for 
longer than tEN_SB_FREQ.
Duty command = Frequency at SPEED pin / INPUT_MAX_FREQUENCY * 100

6.3.9 Starting the Motor Under Different Initial Conditions
The motor can be in one of three states when MCT8316A-Q1 begins the start-up process. The motor may be 
stationary, spinning in the forward direction, or spinning in the reverse direction. The MCT8316A-Q1 includes a 
number of features to allow for reliable motor start-up under all of these conditions. Figure 6-17 shows the motor 
start-up flow for each of the three initial motor states.

Note
"Forward" means "spinning in the same direction as the commanded direction", and "Reverse" means 
"spinning in the opposite direction as the commanded direction".
6.3.9.1 Case 1 – Motor is Stationary
If the motor is stationary, the commutation must be initialized to be in phase with the position of the motor. The 
MCT8316A-Q1 provides various options to initialize the commutation logic to the motor position and reliably start 
the motor.
•
The align and double align techniques force the motor into alignment by applying a voltage across a 
particular motor phase to force the motor to rotate in alignment with this phase.
•
Initial position detect (IPD) determines the position of the motor based on the deterministic inductance 
variation, which is often present in BLDC motors.
•
The slow first cycle method starts the motor by applying a low frequency cycle to align the rotor position to 
the applied commutation by the end of one electrical rotation.
MCT8316A-Q1 also provides a configurable brake option to ensure the motor is stationary before initiating one 
of the above start-up methods. Device enters open loop acceleration after going through the configured start-up 
method.
6.3.9.2 Case 2 – Motor is Spinning in the Forward Direction
If the motor is spinning forward (same direction as the commanded direction) with sufficient speed (BEMF), the 
MCT8316A-Q1 resynchronizes with the spinning motor and continues commutation by going directly to closed 
loop operation. By resynchronizing to the spinning motor, the user achieves the fastest possible start-up time 
for this initial condition. This resynchronization feature can be enabled or disabled through RESYNC_EN. If 
resynchronization is disabled, the MCT8316A-Q1 can be configured to wait for the motor to coast to a stop 
and/or apply a brake. After the motor has stopped spinning, the motor start-up sequence proceeds as in Case 1, 
considering the motor is stationary.

6.3.9.3 Case 3 – Motor is Spinning in the Reverse Direction
If the motor is spinning in the reverse direction (the opposite direction as the commanded direction), the 
MCT8316A-Q1 provides several methods to change the direction and drive the motor to the target speed 
reference in the commanded direction.
The reverse drive method allows the motor to be driven so that it decelerates through zero speed. The motor 
achieves the shortest possible spin-up time when spinning in the reverse direction.
If reverse drive is not enabled, then the MCT8316A-Q1 can be configured to wait for the motor to coast to a stop 
and/or apply a brake. After the motor has stopped spinning, the motor start-up sequence proceeds as in Case 1, 
considering the motor is stationary.
Note
Take care when using the reverse drive or brake feature to ensure that the current is limited to an 
acceptable level and that the supply voltage does not surge as a result of energy being returned to the 
power supply.

Power-On State
This is the initial state of the Motor Start Sequence (MSS) when MCT8316A-
Q1 is powered on. In this state, MCT8316A-Q1 configures the peripherals, 
initializes the algorithm parameters from EEPROM and prepares for driving 
the motor.
Sleep/Standby
In this state, SPEED_REF/POWER_REF/TARGET_DUTY is set to zero 
and MCT8316A-Q1 is either in sleep or standby mode depending on 
DEV_MODE and SPEED/WAKE pin voltage.
SPEED_REF/POWER_REF/
TARGET_DUTY > 0 Judgement
When SPEED_REF/POWER_REF/TARGET_DUTY is set to greater than 
zero, MCT8316A-Q1 exits the sleep/standby state and proceeds to ISD_EN 
judgement. As long as SPEED_REF is set to zero, MCT8316A-Q1 stays in 
sleep/standby state.
ISD_EN Judgement
MCT8316A-Q1 checks to see if the initial speed detect (ISD) function is 
enabled (ISD_EN = 1b). If ISD is enabled, MSS proceeds to the BEMF 
< STAT_DETECT_THR judgement. Instead, if ISD is disabled, the MSS 
proceeds directly to the BRAKE_EN judgement.
BEMF < STAT_DETECT_THR 
or BEMF < FG_BEMF_THR 
Judgement
ISD determines the initial condition (speed, angle, direction of spin) of the 
motor (see Section 6.3.10.1). If motor is deemed to be stationary (BEMF 
< STAT_DETECT_THR or BEMF < FG_BEMF_THR), the MSS proceeds 
to second BEMF < STAT_DETECT_THR judgement. If the motor is not 
stationary, MSS proceeds to verify the direction of spin.
Direction of spin Judgement
The MSS determines whether the motor is spinning in the forward or the 
reverse direction. If the motor is spinning in the forward direction, the 
MCT8316A-Q1 proceeds to the RESYNC_EN judgement. If the motor is 
spinning in the reverse direction, the MSS proceeds to the RVS_DR_EN 
judgement.
RESYNC_EN Judgement
If RESYNC_EN is set to 1b, MCT8316A-Q1 proceeds to BEMF > 
RESYNC_MIN_THRESHOLD judgement. If RESYNC_EN is set to 0b, MSS 
proceeds to HIZ_EN judgement.
BEMF > 
RESYNC_MIN_THRESHOLD 
Judgement
If motor speed is such that BEMF > RESYNC_MIN_THRESHOLD, 
MCT8316A-Q1 uses the speed and position information from ISD to 
transition to the closed loop state (see Section 6.3.10.2) directly. If 
BEMF < RESYNC_MIN_THRESHOLD, MCT8316A-Q1 proceeds to BEMF 
< STAT_DETECT_THR judgement.
BEMF < STAT_DETECT_THR 
Judgement
If motor speed is such that BEMF > STAT_DETECT_THR, MCT8316A-
Q1 proceeds to motor coast timeout. If BEMF < STAT_DETECT_THR, 
MCT8316A-Q1 proceeds to STAT_BRK_EN judgement.
Motor Coast Timeout
MCT8316A-Q1 waits for 200000 PWM cycles for the motor to coast down 
to a speed where BEMF < STAT_DETECT_THR; after 200000 PWM cycles 
lapse in the motor coast state, MCT8316A-Q1 proceeds to STAT_BRK_EN 
judgement irrespective of BEMF. If BEMF < STAT_DETECT_THR during 
motor coast before the 200000 cycle timeout, MCT8316A-Q1 proceeds to 
STAT_BRK_EN judgement immediately.
STAT_BRK_EN Judgement
The MSS checks if the stationary brake function is enabled (STAT_BRK_EN 
=1b). If the stationary brake function is enabled, the MSS advances to the 
stationary brake routine. If the stationary brake function is disabled, the MSS 
advances to motor start-up state (see Section 6.3.10.4).
Stationary Brake Routine
The stationary brake routine can be used to ensure the motor is completely 
stationary before attempting to start the motor. The stationary brake is 
applied by turning on all three low-side driver MOSFETs for a time 
configured by STARTUP_BRK_TIME.

RVS_DR_EN Judgement
The MSS checks to see if the reverse drive function is enabled 
(RVS_DR_EN = 1b). If it is enabled, the MSS transitions to check speed 
of the motor in reverse direction. If the reverse drive function is not enabled 
(RVS_DR_EN = 0b), the MSS advances to the HIZ_EN judgement.
Speed > MIN_DUTY Judgement The MSS checks if the speed (in reverse direction) is higher than the 
speed at MIN_DUTY - till the speed (in reverse direction) is higher than 
the speed at MIN_DUTY, MSS stays in reverse closed loop deceleration. 
When speed (in reverse direction) drops below the speed at MIN_DUTY, the 
MSS transitions to reverse open loop deceleration.
Reverse Open Loop 
Deceleration and Zero Speed 
Crossover
In reverse open loop deceleration, the MCT8316A-Q1 decelerates the motor 
in open-loop till speed reaches zero. At zero speed, direction changes and 
MCT8316A-Q1 begins open loop acceleration.
HIZ_EN Judgement
The MSS checks to determine whether the coast (Hi-Z) function is enabled 
(HIZ_EN = 1b). If the coast function is enabled (HIZ_EN = 1b), the MSS 
advances to the coast routine. If the coast function is disabled (HIZ_EN = 
0b), the MSS advances to the BRAKE_EN judgement.
Coast (Hi-Z) Routine
The device coasts the motor by turning OFF all six MOSFETs for a certain 
time configured by HIZ_TIME.
BRAKE_EN Judgement
The MSS checks to determine whether the brake function is enabled 
(BRAKE_EN = 1b). If the brake function is enabled (BRAKE_EN = 1b), 
the MSS advances to the brake routine. If the brake function is disabled 
(BRAKE_EN = 0b), the MSS advances to the motor start-up state (see 
Section 6.3.10.4).
Brake Routine
MCT8316A-Q1 implements a brake by turning on all three (high-side or 
low-side) MOSFETS for BRK_TIME. Brake is applied either using high-side 
or low-side MOSFETs based on BRK_MODE configuration.
Closed Loop
In this state, the MCT8316A-Q1 drives the motor with sensorless trapezoidal 
commutation based on either zero cross detection or BEMF integration.
6.3.10.1 Initial Speed Detect (ISD)
The ISD function is used to identify the initial condition of the motor and is enabled by setting ISD_EN to 1b. The 
initial speed, position and direction is determined by sampling the phase voltage through the internal ADC. ISD 
can be disabled by setting ISD_EN to 0b. If the function is disabled (ISD_EN set to 0b), the MCT8316A-Q1 does 
not perform the initial speed detect function and proceeds to check if the brake routine (BRAKE_EN) is enabled.
6.3.10.2 Motor Resynchronization
The motor resynchronization function works when the ISD and resynchronization functions are both enabled and 
the device determines that the initial state of the motor is spinning in the forward direction (same direction as 
the commanded direction). The speed and position information measured during ISD are used to initialize the 
drive state of the MCT8316A-Q1, which can transition directly into closed loop state without needing to stop 
the motor. In the MCT8316A-Q1, motor resynchronization can be enabled/disabled through RESYNC_EN bit. If 
motor resynchronization is disabled, the device proceeds to check if the motor coast (Hi-Z) routine is enabled.
6.3.10.3 Reverse Drive
The MCT8316A-Q1 uses the reverse drive function to change the direction of the motor rotation when ISD_EN 
and RVS_DR_EN are both set to 1b and the ISD determines the motor spin direction to be opposite to 
that of the commanded direction. Reverse drive includes synchronizing with the motor speed in the reverse 
direction, reverse decelerating the motor through zero speed, changing direction, and accelerating in open 
loop in forward (or commanded) direction until the device transitions into closed loop in forward direction 
(see Figure 6-19). MCT8316A-Q1 uses the same parameter values for open to closed loop handoff threshold 
(OPN_CL_HANDOFF_THR), open loop acceleration rates (OL_ACC_A1, OL_ACC_A2) and open loop current 
limit (OL_ILIMIT) in the reverse direction as in the forward direction..

6.3.10.4 Motor Start-up
There are different options available for motor start-up from a stationary position and these options can be 
configured by MTR_STARTUP. In align and double align mode, the motor is aligned to a known position by 
injecting a DC current. In IPD mode, the rotor position is estimated by applying 6 different high-frequency pulses. 
In slow first cycle mode, the motor is started by applying a low frequency cycle.
6.3.10.4.1 Align
Align is enabled by configuring MTR_STARTUP to 00b. The MCT8316A-Q1 aligns the motor by injecting a DC 
current using a particular phase pattern (phase-C high-side FET and phase-B low-side FET are ON) - current 
flowing into phase-B and flowing out from phase-C for a certain time configured by ALIGN_TIME.
The duty cycle during align is defined by ALIGN_DUTY. In MCT8316A-Q1, current limit during align is 
configured through OL_ILIMIT_CONFIG and is determined by ILIMIT or OL_ILIMIT based on configuration of 
OL_ILIMIT_CONFIG.
A fast change in the phase current during align may result in a sudden change in the driving torque and this 
could result in acoustic noise. To avoid this, the MCT8316A-Q1 ramps up duty cycle from 0 to until it reaches 
ALIGN_DUTY at a configurable rate set by ALIGN_RAMP_RATE. At the end of align routine, the motor will be 
aligned at the known position.
6.3.10.4.2 Double Align
Double align is enabled by configuring MTR_STARTUP to 01b. Single align is not reliable when the initial 
position of the rotor is 180o out of phase with the applied phase pattern. In this case, it is possible to have 
start-up failures using single align. In order to improve the reliabilty of align based start-up, the MCT8316A-Q1 
provides the option of double align start-up. In double align start-up, MCT8316A-Q1 uses a phase pattern for the 
second align that is 60o out of phase with the first align phase pattern in the commanded direction. In double 
align, relevant parameters like align time, current limit, ramp rate are the same as in the case of single align - 
two different phase patterns are applied in succession with the same parameters to ensure that the motor will be 
aligned to a known position irrespective of initial rotor position.
6.3.10.4.3 Initial Position Detection (IPD)
Initial Position Detection (IPD) can be enabled by configuring MTR_STARTUP to 10b. In IPD, inductive sense 
method is used to determine the initial position of the motor using the spatial variation in the motor inductance.

Align or double align may result in the motor spinning in the reverse direction before starting open loop 
acceleration. IPD can be used in such applications where reverse rotation of the motor is unacceptable. IPD 
does not wait for the motor to align with the commutation and therefore can allow for a faster motor start-up 
sequence. IPD works well when the inductance of the motor varies as a function of position. IPD works by 
pulsing current in to the motor and hence can generate acoustics which must be taken into account when 
determining the best start-up method for a particular application.
6.3.10.4.3.1 IPD Operation
IPD operates by sequentially applying six different phase patterns according to the following sequence: 
BC-> CB-> AB-> BA-> CA-> AC (see Figure 6-20). When the current reaches the threshold configured by 
IPD_CURR_THR, the MCT8316A-Q1 stops driving the particular phase pattern and measures the time taken to 
reach the current threshold from when the particular phase pattern was applied. Thus, the time taken to reach 
IPD_CURR_THR is measured for all six phase patterns - this time varies as a function of the inductance in 
the motor windings. The state with the shortest time represents the state with the minimum inductance. The 
minimum inductance is because of the alignment of the north pole of the motor with this particular driving state.

6.3.10.4.3.2 IPD Release Mode
Two modes are available for configuring the way the MCT8316A-Q1 stops driving the motor when the current 
threshold is reached. The recirculate (or brake) mode is selected if IPD_RLS_MODE = 0b. In this configuration, 
the low-side (LSC) MOSFET remains ON to allow the current to recirculate between the MOSFET (LSC) and 
body diode (LSA) (see Figure 6-21). Hi-Z mode is selected if IPD_RLS_MODE = 1b. In Hi-Z mode, both the 
high-side (HSA) and low-side (LSC) MOSFETs are turned OFF and the current recirculates through the body 
diodes back to the power supply (see Figure 6-22).
In the Hi-Z mode, the phase current has a faster settle-down time, but that can result in a voltage increase on 
VM. The user must manage this with an appropriate selection of either a clamp circuit or by providing sufficient 
capacitance between VM and GND to absorb the energy. If the voltage surge cannot be contained or if it is 
unacceptable for the application, recirculate mode must be used. When using the recirculate mode, select the 
IPD_CLK_FREQ appropriately to give the current in the motor windings enough time to decay to to 0-A before 
the next IPD phase pattern is applied.

After the initial position is detected, the MCT8316A-Q1 begins driving the motor in open loop at an angle 
specified by IPD_ADV_ANGLE.
Advancing the drive angle anywhere from 0° to 180° results in positive torque. Advancing the drive angle by 
90° results in maximum initial torque. Applying maximum initial torque could result in uneven acceleration to the 
rotor. Select the IPD_ADV_ANGLE to allow for smooth acceleration in the application (see Figure 6-23).

Slow First Cycle start-up is enabled by configuring MTR_STARTUP to 11b. In slow first cycle start-up,

frequency configured is used only for first cycle, and then the motor commutation follows acceleration profile

configured by open loop acceleration coefficients A1 and A2. The slow first cycle frequency has to be configured 
to be slow enough to allow motor to synchronize with the commutation sequence. This mode is useful when fast 
startup is desired as it significantly reduces the align time.
6.3.10.4.5 Open loop
Upon completing the motor position initialization with either align, double align, IPD or slow first cycle, the 
MCT8316A-Q1 begins to accelerate the motor in open loop. During open loop, fixed duty cycle is applied and the 
cycle by cycle current limit functionality is used to regulate the current.
In MCT8316A-Q1, open loop current limit threshold is selected through OL_ILIMIT_CONFIG and is set 
either by ILIMIT or OL_ILIMIT based on the configuration of OL_ILIMIT_CONFIG. Open loop duty cycle is 
configured through OL_DUTY. While the motor is in open loop, speed (and commutation instants) is determined 
by Equation 5. In MCT8316A-Q1, open loop acceleration coefficients, A1 and A2 are configured through 
OL_ACC_A1 and OL_ACC_A2 respectively. The function of the open-loop operation is to drive the motor to 
a speed at which the motor generates sufficient BEMF to allow the BEMF zero-crossing based commutation 
control to accurately drive the motor.
Speed (t) = A1 * t + 0.5 * A2 * t2
(5)
6.3.10.4.6 Transition from Open to Closed Loop
MCT8316A-Q1 has an internal mechanism to determine the motor speed for transition from open loop 
commutation to BEMF zero crossing based closed loop commutation. This feature of automatically deciding 
the open to closed handoff speed can be enabled by configuring AUTO_HANDOFF to 1b. If AUTO_HANDOFF 
is set to 0b, the open to closed loop handoff speed needs to be configured by OPN_CL_HANDOFF_THR. The 
closed loop in this section does not refer to closed speed loop - it refers to the commutation control changing 
from open loop (equation based) to closed loop (BEMF zero crossing based).
6.3.11 Closed Loop Operation
In closed loop operation, the MCT8316A-Q1 drives the motor using trapezoidal commutation. The commutation 
instant is determined by the BEMF zero crossing on the phase which is not driven (Hi-Z). The duty cycle of the 
applied motor voltage is determined by DUTY OUT (see SPEED Control).
6.3.11.1 120o Commutation
In 120o commutation, each phase is driven for 120o and is Hi-Z for 60o within each half electrical cycle as 
shown in Figure 6-24. In 120o commutation there are six different commutation states. 120o commutation can be 
configured by setting COMM_CONTROL to 00b. MCT8316A-Q1 supports different modulation modes with 120o 
commutation which can be configured through PWM_MODUL.

6.3.11.2 Variable Commutation
Variable commutation can be configured by setting COMM_CONTROL to 01b. 120o commutation may result in 
acoustic noise due to the long Hi-Z period causing some torque ripple in the motor. In order to reduce this torque 
ripple and acoustic noise, the MCT8316A-Q1 uses variable commutation to reduce the phase current ripple at 
commutation by extending 120o driving time and gradually decreasing duty cycle prior to entering Hi-Z state. In 
this mode, the phase is Hi-Z between 30o and 60o and this window size is dynamically adjusted based on speed. 
A smaller window size will typically give better acoustic performance. Figure 6-28 shows 150o commutation with 
30o window size.

6.3.11.3 Lead Angle Control
To achieve the best efficiency, it is often desirable to control the drive state of the motor so that the motor phase 
current is aligned with the motor BEMF voltage. MCT8316A-Q1 provides the option to advance or delay the 
phase voltage from the commutation point by adjusting the lead angle. The lead angle can be adjusted to obtain 
optimal efficiency. This can be accomplished by operating the motor at constant speed and load conditions 
and adjusting the lead angle (LD_ANGLE) until the minimum current is achieved. The MCT8316A-Q1 has the 
capability to apply both positive and negative lead angle (by configuring LD_ANGLE_POLARITY) as shown in 
Figure 6-29
Lead angle can be calculated by {LD_ANGLE x 0.12}o; for example, if the LD_ANGLE is 0x1E and 
LD_ANGLE_POLARITY is 1b, then a lead angle of +3.6o(advance) is applied. If LD_ANGLE_POLARITY is 
0b, then a lead angle of -3.6o(delay) is applied.
Note
For 120o commutation, the negative lead angle is limited to -20o; any lead angle lower than that will be 
clamped to -20o.
For variable commutation, negative lead angle is not supported and positive lead angle is limited 
to +15o. Anything configured higher than +15o or lower than 00 will be clamped to 15o and 0o 
respectively.

6.3.11.4 Closed loop accelerate
To prevent sudden changes in the torque applied to the motor which could result in acoustic noise, the 
MCT8316A-Q1 device provides the option of limiting the maximum rate at which the speed command can 
change. The closed loop acceleration rate parameter sets the maximum rate at which the speed command 
changes (shown in Figure 6-30). In the MCT8316A-Q1, closed loop acceleration rate is configured through 
CL_ACC.

6.3.12 Speed Loop
MCT8316A-Q1 has a speed loop option which can be used to maintain constant speed under varying operating 
conditions. Speed loop is enabled by setting CLOSED_LOOP_MODE to 01b. Kp and Ki coefficients are 
configured through SPD_POWER_KP and SPD_POWER_KI. The output of speed loop (SPEED_PI_OUT) is 
used to generate the DUTY OUT (see Figure 6-13). The PI controller output upper (VMAX) and lower bound 
(VMIN) saturation limits are configured through SPD_POWER_V_MAX and SPD_POWER_V_MIN respectively. 
When output of the speed loop saturates, the integrator is disabled to prevent integral wind-up. The speed loop 
PI controller is as in Figure 6-31.
SPEED_REF is derived from duty command input and maximum motor speed (MAX_SPEED) configured by 
user (see Equation 6). In speed loop mode, minimum SPEED_REF is set by MIN_DUTY * MAX_SPEED.
SPEED_REF = DUTY CMD * MAX_SPEED

6.3.13 Input Power Regulation
MCT8316A-Q1 provides an option of regulating the (input) power instead of motor speed - this input power 
regulation can be done in two modes, namely, closed loop power control and power limit control. Input power 
regulation (instead of motor speed) mode is selected by setting CLOSED_LOOP_MODE to 10b. This should be 
accompanied by setting CONST_POWER_MODE to 01b for closed loop power control or to 10b for power limit 
control. In either of the power regulation modes, the maximum power that MCT8316A-Q1 can draw from the 
DC input supply is set by MAX_POWER - the power reference (POWER_REF in Figure 6-32) varies as function 
of the duty command input (DUTY CMD) and MAX_POWER as given by Equation 7. The hysteresis band for 
the power reference is set by CONST_POWER_LIMIT_HYST. In both the power regulation modes, the minimum 
power reference is set by MIN_DUTY x MAX_POWER.
POWER_REF = DUTY CMD x MAX_POWER
(7)
In both the power regulation modes, MCT8316A-Q1 uses the same PI controller parameters as in the 
speed loop mode. Kp and Ki coefficients are configured through SPD_POWER_KP and SPD_POWER_KI. 
The PI controller output upper (VMAX) and lower bound (VMIN) saturation limits are configured through 
SPD_POWER_V_MAX and SPD_POWER_V_MIN respectively. The key difference between closed loop power 
control and power limit control is in the when the PI controller decides the DUTY OUT (see Figure 6-13) 
applied to FETs. In closed loop power control, DUTY OUT is always equal to POWER_PI_OUT from the PI 
controller output in Figure 6-32. However, in power limit control, the PI controller decides the DUTY OUT 
only if POWER_MEAS > POWER_REF + CONST_POWER_LIMIT_HYST. If POWER_MEAS < POWER_REF 
+ CONST_POWER_LIMIT_HYST, the PI controller is not used and DUTY OUT is equal to DUTY CMD. 
Essentially, in closed loop power control, input power is always actively regulated to POWER_REF whereas, 
in power limit control, input power is only limited to POWER_REF and not actively regulated to POWER_REF. 
When output of the power PI loop saturates, the integrator is disabled to prevent integral wind-up.

6.3.14 Anti-Voltage Surge (AVS)
When a motor is driven, energy is transferred from the power supply into the motor. Some of this energy 
is stored in the form of inductive and mechanical energy. If the speed command suddenly drops such that 
the BEMF voltage generated by the motor is greater than the voltage that is applied to the motor, then the 
mechanical energy of the motor is returned to the power supply and the VM voltage surges. The AVS feature 
works to prevent this voltage surge on VM and can be enabled by setting AVS_EN to 1b. AVS can be disabled by 
setting AVS_EN to 0b. When AVS is disabled, the deceleration rate is configured through CL_DEC_CONFIG
6.3.15 Output PWM Switching Frequency
MCT8316A-Q1 provides the option to configure the output PWM switching frequency of the MOSFETs through 
PWM_FREQ_OUT. PWM_FREQ_OUT has range of 5-100 kHz. In order to select optimal output PWM switching 
frequency, user has to make tradeoff between the current ripple and the switching losses. Generally, motors 
having lower L/R ratio require higher PWM switching frequency to reduce current ripple.
6.3.16 Fast Start-up (< 50 ms)
MCT8316A-Q1 has the capability to accelerate a motor from 0 to 100% speed within 50ms. This will only 
work on low inertia motors which are capable of this level of acceleration. In order to achieve fast start-up, 
the commutation instant detection needs to be configured to hybrid mode by setting INTEG_ZC_METHOD to 
1b. In the hybrid mode, the commutation instant is determined by using back-EMF integration at low-medium 
speeds and by using built-in comparators (BEMF zero crossing) at higher speeds. MCT8316A-Q1 automatically 
transitions between back-EMF integration and comparator based commutation depending on the motor speed as 
shown in Figure 6-33. The duty cycles for commutation method transition at lower speeds are directly configured 
by INTEG_DUTY_THR_LOW and INTEG_DUTY_THR_HIGH and at higher speeds are indirectly configured by 
INTEG_CYC_THR_LOW and INTEG_CYC_THR_HIGH. These duty cycles should be configured to provide a 
sufficient hysteresis band to avoid repeated commutation method transitions near threshold duty cycles. The 
BEMF threshold values used to determine the commutation instant in the back-EMF integration method are 
configured by BEMF_THRESHOLD1 and BEMF_THRESHOLD2.

6.3.16.1 BEMF Threshold
Figure 6-34 shows the three-phase voltages during 120o trapezoidal operation. It is seen that one of the 
phases will always be floating within a 60o commuation interval and MCT8316A-Q1 integrates this floating 
phase voltage (which denotes the motor back-EMF) in the back-EMF integration method to detect the next 
commutation instant. The floating phase voltage can either be increasing or decreasing and the algorithm starts 
the integration after the zero cross detection in order to eliminate integration errors due to variable degauss time. 
The floating phase voltage is periodically sampled (after zero cross) and added (discrete form of integration). 
BEMF threshold (BEMF_THRESHOLD1 and BEMF_THRESHOLD2) value is set such that the integral value 
of the floating phase voltage crosses the BEMF_THRESHOLD1 or BEMF_THRESHOLD2 value at (or very 
near) to the commutation instant. BEMF_THRESHOLD1 is the threshold for rising floating phase voltage and 
BEMF_THRESHOLD2 is the threshold for falling floating phase voltage. If BEMF_THRESHOLD2 is set to 0, 
then BEMF_THRESHOLD1 is used as the threshold for both rising and falling floating phase voltage.

6.3.16.2 Dynamic Degauss
In MCT8316A-Q1, the degauss time can be dynamically computed after the commutation for a precise detection 
of the zero crossing instant. This is done by enabling the dynamic degauss feature (DYN_DEGAUSS_EN is set 
to 1b). This feature allows the motor control algorithm to capture the zero crossing instant after the outgoing 
(floating) phase voltage is completely settled; that is, when the outgoing phase current has decayed to zero 
and the outgoing (floating) phase voltage is not clamped (to either VM or PGND) and represents the true 
back-EMF. This accurate measurement of zero cross instant allows fast acceleration of the motors (< 50ms) 
using MCT8316A-Q1.

6.3.17 Fast Deceleration
MCT8316A-Q1 has the capability to decelerate a motor quickly (100% to 10% speed reduction within tens of 
ms) without pumping energy back into the input DC supply using the fast deceleration feature in conjunction 
with the AVS feature. The fast deceleration feature can be enabled by setting FAST_DECEL_EN to 1b; AVS_EN 
should be set to 1b to prevent energy pump-back into the input DC supply. This combination enables a linear 
braking effect resulting in a fast and smooth speed reduction without energy pump-back into the DC input supply. 
This feature combination can also be used during reverse drive (see Reverse Drive) or motor stop (see Active 
Spin-Down) to reduce the motor speed quickly without energy pump-back into the DC input supply.
The deceleration time can be controlled by appropriately configuring the current limit during deceleration, 
FAST_DECEL_CURR_LIM. A higher current limit results in a lower deceleration time and vice-versa. A 
higher than necessary current limit setting may result in motor stall faults, at low target speeds, due to 
excessive braking torque. This can also lead to higher losses in MCT8316A-Q1, especially in repeated 
acceleration-deceleration cycles. Therefore, the FAST_DECEL_CURR_LIM should be chosen appropriately, so 
as to decelerate within the required time without resulting in stall faults or overheating.
FAST_BRK_DELTA is used to configure the target speed hysteresis band to exit the fast deceleration mode and 
re-enter motoring mode when motor reaches the target speed. For example, if FAST_BRK_DELTA is set to 1%,

the fast deceleration is deemed complete when motor speed reaches within 1% of target speed. Setting a higher 
value for FAST_BRK_DELTA may eliminate motor stall faults, especially when high FAST_DECEL_CURR_LIM 
values are used. Setting a higher value for FAST_BRK_DETLA will also result in higher speed error between 
target speed and motor speed at the end of deceleration mode - motor will eventually reach the target speed 
once motoring mode is resumed. FAST_DECEL_CURR_LIM and FAST_BRK_DELTA should be configured in 
tandem to optimize between lower deceleration time and reliable (no stall faults) deceleration profile.
FAST_DEC_DUTY_THR configures the speed below which fast deceleration will be implemented. For example, 
if FAST_DEC_DUTY_THR is set to 70%, any deceleration from speeds above 70% will not use fast 
deceleration until the speed goes below 70%. FAST_DEC_DUTY_WIN is used to set the minimum deceleration 
window (initial speed - target speed) below which fast deceleration will not be implemented. For example, if 
FAST_DEC_DUTY_WIN is set to 15% and 50%->40% deceleration command is received, fast deceleration 
is not used to reduce the speed from 50% to 40% since the deceleration window (10%) is smaller than 
FAST_DEC_DUTY_WIN.
MCT8316A-Q1 provides a dynamic current limit option during fast deceleration to improve the stability of fast 
deceleration when braking to very low speeds; using this feature the current limit during fast deceleration can 
be reduced as the motor speed decreases. This feature can be enabled by setting DYNAMIC_BRK_CURR 
to 1b. The current limit at the start of fast deceleration (at FAST_DEC_DUTY_THR) is configured by 
FAST_DECEL_CURR_LIM and the current limit at zero speed is configured by DYN_BRK_CURR_LOW_LIM; 
the current limit during fast deceleration varies linearly with speed between these two operating points when 
dynamic current limit is enabled. If dynamic current limit is disabled, current limit during fast deceleration stays 
constant and is configured by FAST_DECEL_CURR_LIM.

6.3.18 Active Demagnetization
MCT8316A-Q1 has smart rectification features (active demagnetization) which decreases power losses in the 
device by reducing diode conduction losses. When this feature is enabled, the device automatically turns ON 
the corresponding MOSFET whenever it detects diode conduction. This feature can be enabled by configuring 
EN_ASR.
Note
EN_ASR needs to be set to 1b to enable active demagnetization.
The MCT8316A-Q1 device includes a high-side (AD_HS) and low-side (AD_LS) comparator which detects the 
negative flow of current in the device on each half-bridge. The AD_HS comparator compares the sense-FET 
output with the supply voltage (VM) threshold, whereas the AD_LS compatator compares with the ground 
(0-V) threshold. Depending upon the flow of current from OUTx to VM or PGND to OUTx, the AD_HS or 
the AD_LS comparator trips. These comparator outputs provide a reference point for the operation of active 
demagnetization feature.

Figure 6-36. Active Demagnetization Operation
6.3.18.1 Active Demagnetization in action
Figure 6-37 shows the operation of active demagnetization during the BLDC motor commutation. As shown in 
Figure 6-37 (a), the current is flowing from HA to LC in one commutation state. During the commutation change 
over as shown in Figure 6-37 (b), the HB FET is turned ON (and HA FET is turned OFF), and the commutation 
current (due to motor inductance) in OUTA flows through the body diode of LA. This results in a higher diode 
loss depending on the commutation current. This commutation loss is reduced by turning on the LA FET for the 
commutation time as shown in Figure 6-37 (c).
Similarly, the active demagnetization operation of a high-side FET is realized in Figure 6-37 (d), (e) and (f).

6.3.19 Motor Stop Options
The MCT8316A-Q1 provides different options for stopping the motor which can be configured by MTR_STOP.
6.3.19.1 Coast (Hi-Z) Mode
Coast (Hi-Z) mode is configured by setting MTR_STOP to 000b. When motor stop command is received, 
the MCT8316A-Q1 will transition into a high impedance (Hi-Z) state by turning off all MOSFETs. When the 
MCT8316A-Q1 transitions from driving the motor into a Hi-Z state, the inductive current in the motor windings 
continues to flow and the energy returns to the power supply through the body diodes in the MOSFET output 
stage (see example Figure 6-39).

Figure 6-39. Coast (Hi-Z) Mode
In this example, current is applied to the motor through the high-side phase-A MOSFET (HSA) and returned 
through the low-side phase-C MOSFET (LSC). When motor stop command is received all 6 MOSFETs transition 
to Hi-Z state and the inductive energy returns to supply through body diodes of MOSFETs LSA and HSC.
6.3.19.2 Recirculation Mode
Recirculation mode is configured by setting MTR_STOP to 001b. In order to prevent the inductive energy 
from returning to DC input supply during motor stop, the MCT8316A-Q1 allows current to circulate within the 
MOSFETs by selectively turning OFF some of the active (ON) MOSFETs for a certain time (auto calculated 
recirculation time to allow the inductive current to decay to zero) before transitioning into Hi-Z by turning OFF the 
remaining MOSFETs.
If high-side modulation was active, prior to motor stop command, then the high-side MOSFET is turned OFF 
on receiving motor stop command and the current recirculation takes place through low-side MOSFET (see 
example Figure 6-40). Once the recirculation time lapses, the low-side MOSFET also turns OFF and all 
MOSFETs are in Hi-Z state.

Low-side braking mode is configured by setting MTR_STOP to 010b. When a motor stop command is received, 
the output speed is reduced to a value defined by ACT_SPIN_BRK_THR prior to turning all low-side MOSFETs 
ON (see example Figure 6-42) for a time configured by MTR_STOP_BRK_TIME. If the motor speed is below 
ACT_SPIN_BRK_THR prior to receiving stop command, then the MCT8316A-Q1 transitions directly into the 
brake state. After applying the brake for MTR_STOP_BRK_TIME, the MCT8316A-Q1 transitions into the Hi-Z 
state by turning OFF all MOSFETs.

The MCT8316A-Q1 can also enter low-side braking through BRAKE pin input. When BRAKE pin is pulled to 
HIGH state, the output speed is reduced to a value defined by BRAKE_DUTY_THRESHOLD prior to turning all 
low-side MOSFETs ON. In this case, MCT8316A-Q1 stays in low-side brake state till BRAKE pin changes to 
LOW state.
6.3.19.4 High-Side Braking
High-side braking mode is configured by setting MTR_STOP to 011b. When a motor stop command is received, 
the output speed is reduced to a value defined by ACT_SPIN_BRK_THR prior to turning all high-side MOSFETs 
ON (see example Figure 6-43) for a time configured by MTR_STOP_BRK_TIME. If the motor speed is below 
ACT_SPIN_BRK_THR prior to receiving stop command, then the MCT8316A-Q1 transitions directly into the 
brake state. After applying the brake for MTR_STOP_BRK_TIME, the MCT8316A-Q1 transitions into Hi-Z state 
by turning OFF all MOSFETs.

6.3.19.5 Active Spin-Down
Active spin down mode is configured by setting MTR_STOP to 100b. When motor stop command is received, 
MCT8316A-Q1 reduces duty cycle to ACT_SPIN_BRK_THR and then transitions to Hi-Z state by turning all 
MOSFETs OFF. The advantage of this mode is that by reducing duty cycle, the motor is decelerated to a lower 
speed thereby reducing the phase currents before entering Hi-Z. Now, when motor transitions into Hi-Z state, 
the energy transfer to power supply is reduced. The threshold ACT_SPIN_BRK_THR needs to configured high 
enough for MCT8316A-Q1 to not lose synchronization with the motor.
6.3.20 FG Configuration
The MCT8316A-Q1 provides information about the motor speed through the Frequency Generate (FG) pin. In 
MCT8316A-Q1, the FG pin output is configured through FG_CONFIG. When FG_CONFIG is configured to 1b, 
the FG output is active as long as the MCT8316A-Q1 is driving the motor. When FG_CONFIG is configured to 
0b, the MCT8316A-Q1 provides an FG output until the motor back-EMF falls below FG_BEMF_THR.
6.3.20.1 FG Output Frequency
The FG output frequency can be configured by FG_DIV_FACTOR. In MCT8316A-Q1, FG toggles once every 
commutation cycle if FG_DIV_FACTOR is set to 0000b. Many applications require the FG output to provide a 
pulse for every mechanical rotation of the motor. Different FG_DIV_FACTOR configurations can accomplish this 
for 2-pole up to 30-pole motors.
Figure 6-44 shows the FG output when MCT8316A-Q1 has been configured to provide FG pulses once every 
commutation cycle (electrical cycle/3), once every electrical cycle (2 poles), once every two electrical cycle (4 
poles), once every three electrical cycles (6 poles), once every four electrical cycles (8 poles), and so on.

6.3.20.2 FG Open-Loop and Lock Behavior
During closed loop operation, the driving speed (FG output frequency) and the actual motor speed are 
synchronized. During open-loop operation, however, FG may not reflect the actual motor speed. During motor-
lock condition, the FG output is driven high.
The MCT8316A-Q1 provides three options for controlling the FG output during open loop, as shown in Figure 
6-45. The selection of these options is configured through FG_SEL.
If FG_SEL is set to,
•
00b: When in open loop, the FG output is based on the driving frequency.
•
01b: When in open loop, the FG output will be driven high.
•
10b: The FG output will reflect the driving frequency during open loop operation in the first motor start-up 
cycle after power-on, sleep/standby; FG will be held high during open loop operation in subsequent start-up 
cycles.

6.3.21.1 VM Supply Undervoltage Lockout
If at any time the input supply voltage on the VM pin falls lower than the VUVLO threshold (VM UVLO falling 
threshold), all the integrated FETs, driver charge-pump and digital logic are disabled as shown in Figure 6-46. 
MCT8316A-Q1 goes into reset state whenever VM UVLO event occurs.

If at any time the voltage on the AVDD pin falls lower than the VAVDD_UV threshold, all the integrated FETs, 
driver charge-pump and digital logic controller are disabled. Since internal circuitry in MCT8316A-Q1 is powered 
through the AVDD regulator, MCT8316A-Q1 goes into reset state whenever AVDD UV event occurs.
6.3.21.3 BUCK Undervoltage Lockout (BUCK_UV)
If at any time the input supply voltage on the FB_BK pin falls lower than the VBK_UVLO threshold, both the 
high-side and low-side MOSFETs of the buck regulator are disabled . Since internal circuitry in MCT8316A-Q1 is 
powered through the buck regulator,MCT8316A-Q1 goes into reset state whenever buck UV event occurs.
6.3.21.4 VCP Charge Pump Undervoltage Lockout (CPUV)
If at any time the voltage on the VCP pin (charge pump) falls lower than the VCPUV threshold, all the integrated 
FETs are disabled and the nFAULT pin is driven low. The DRIVER_FAULT and VCP_UV bits are set to 1b in 
the status registers. Normal operation resumes (driver operation and the nFAULT pin is released) when the VCP 
undervoltage condition clears. The VCP_UV bit stays set until cleared through the CLR_FLT bit.
6.3.21.5 Overvoltage Protection (OVP)
If at any time input supply voltage on the VM pins rises higher lower than the VOVP threshold voltage, all the 
integrated FETs are disabled and the nFAULT pin is driven low. The DRIVER_FAULT and OVP bits are set to 
1b in the status registers. Normal operation resumes (driver operation and the nFAULT pin is released) when the 
OVP condition clears. The OVP bit stays set until cleared through the CLR_FLT bit. Setting the OVP_EN to 1b 
enables this protection feature.
The OVP threshold can be set to 20-V or 32-V based on the OVP_SEL bit.

6.3.21.6 Overcurrent Protection (OCP)
MOSFET overcurrent event is sensed by monitoring the current flowing through FETs. If the current across a 
FET exceeds the IOCP threshold for longer than the tOCP deglitch time, an OCP event is recognized and action 
is taken according to the OCP_MODE bit. The IOCP threshold is set through the OCP_LVL, the tOCP_DEG is set 
through the OCP_DEG and the OCP_MODE bit can operate in four different modes: OCP latched shutdown, 
OCP automatic retry, OCP report only and OCP disabled.
6.3.21.6.1 OCP Latched Shutdown (OCP_MODE = 00b)
When an OCP event happens in this mode, all MOSFETs are disabled and the nFAULT pin is driven low. The 
DRIVER_FAULT, OCP and corresponding FET's OCP bits are set to 1b in the status registers. Normal operation 
resumes (driver operation and the nFAULT pin is released) when the OCP condition clears and a clear fault 
command is issued through the CLR_FLT bit.

No protective action is taken when an OCP event happens in this mode. The overcurrent event is reported 
by setting the DRIVER_FAULT, OCP, and corresponding FET's OCP bits to 1b in the fault status registers. 
The device continues to operate as usual. The external controller manages the overcurrent condition by acting 
appropriately. The reporting clears when the OCP condition clears and a clear fault command is issued through 
the CLR_FLT bit.
6.3.21.6.4 OCP Disabled (OCP_MODE = 11b)
No action is taken when an OCP event happens in this mode.
6.3.21.7 Buck Overcurrent Protection
The buck overcurrent event is sensed by monitoring the current flowing through high-side MOSFET of the buck 
regulator. If the current through the high-side MOSFET exceeds the IBK_OCP threshold for a time longer than the 
deglitch time (tOCP_DEG), a buck OCP event is recognized. MCT8316A-Q1 goes into reset state whenever buck 
OCP event occurs, since the internal circuitry in MCT8316A-Q1 is powered from the buck regulator output.
6.3.21.8 Cycle-by-Cycle (CBC) Current Limit (CBC_ILIMIT)
Cycle-by-cycle (CBC) current limit provides a means of controlling the amount of current delivered to the 
motor. This is useful when the system must limit the amount of current pulled from the power supply during 
motor operation. The CBC current limit limits the current applied to the motor from exceeding the configured 
threshold. CBC current limit functionality is achieved by connecting the output of current sense amplifier VSOX to 
a hardware comparator. If the voltage at output of current sense amplifier exceeds the CBC_ILIMIT threshold, 
a CBC_ILIMIT event is recognized and action is taken according to CBC_ILIMIT_MODE. Total delay in reaction 
to this event is dependent on the current sense amplifier gain and the comparator delay. CBC current limit in 
closed loop is set through CBC_ILIMIT while configuration of OL_ILIMIT_CONFIG sets the CBC current limit in 
open loop operation. Different modes can be configured through CBC_ILIMIT_MODE: CBC_ILIMIT automatic

number of PWM cycles based, CBC_ILIMIT report only, CBC_ILIMIT disabled.
6.3.21.8.1 CBC_ILIMIT Automatic Recovery next PWM Cycle (CBC_ILIMIT_MODE = 000xb)
When a CBC_ILIMIT event happens in this mode, MCT8316A-Q1 stops driving the FETs using recirculation 
mode to prevent the inductive energy from entering the DC input supply. The CBC_ILIMIT bit is set to 1b in the 
fault status registers. Normal operation resumes at the start of next PWM cycle and CBC_ILIMIT bit is reset to 
0b. The status of CONTROLLER_FAULT bit and nFAULT pin will be determined by CBC_ILIMIT_MODE. When 
CBC_ILIMIT_MODE is 0000b, CONTROLLER_FAULT bit is set to 1b and nFAULT pin driven low until next PWM 
cycle. When CBC_ILIMIT_MODE is 0001b, CONTROLLER_FAULT bit is not set to 1b and nFAULT is not driven 
low.
6.3.21.8.2 CBC_ILIMIT Automatic Recovery Threshold Based (CBC_ILIMIT_MODE = 001xb)
When a CBC_ILIMIT event happens in this mode, MCT8316A-Q1 stops driving the FETs using recirculation 
mode to prevent the inductive energy from entering the DC input supply. The CBC_ILIMIT bit is set to 1b in the 
status registers. Normal operation resumes after VSOX falls below CBC_ILIMIT threshold and CBC_ILIMIT bit is 
set to 0b. The status of CONTROLLER_FAULT bit and nFAULT pin will be determined by CBC_ILIMIT_MODE. 
When CBC_ILIMIT_MODE is 0010b, CONTROLLER_FAULT bit is set to 1b and nFAULT pin driven low until 
VSOX falls below CBC_ILIMIT threshold. When CBC_ILIMIT_MODE is 0011b, CONTROLLER_FAULT bit is not 
set to 1b and nFAULT is not driven low.
6.3.21.8.3 CBC_ILIMIT Automatic Recovery after 'n' PWM Cycles (CBC_ILIMIT_MODE = 010xb)
When a CBC_ILIMIT event happens in this mode, MCT8316A-Q1 stops driving the FETs using recirculation 
mode to prevent the inductive energy from entering the DC input supply. The CBC_ILIMIT bit is set to 1b 
in the fault status registers. Normal operation resumes after (CBC_RETRY_PWM_CYC +1) PWM cycles and 
CBC_ILIMIT bit is set to 0b. The status of CONTROLLER_FAULT bit and nFAULT pin will be determined by 
CBC_ILIMIT_MODE. When CBC_ILIMIT_MODE is 0100b, CONTROLLER_FAULT bit is set to1b and nFAULT 
pin driven low until (CBC_RETRY_PWM_CYC +1) PWM cycles lapse. When CBC_ILIMIT_MODE is 0101b, 
CONTROLLER_FAULT bit is not set to 1b and nFAULT is not driven low.
6.3.21.8.4 CBC_ILIMIT Report Only (CBC_ILIMIT_MODE = 0110b)
No protective action is taken when a CBC_ILIMIT event happens in this mode. The CBC current limit event is 
reported by setting the CONTROLLER_FAULT and CBC_ILIMIT bits to 1b in the fault status registers. The gate 
drivers continue to operate. The external controller manages the overcurrent condition by acting appropriately. 
The reporting clears when the CBC_ILIMIT condition clears and a clear fault command is issued through the 
CLR_FLT bit.
6.3.21.8.5 CBC_ILIMIT Disabled (CBC_ILIMIT_MODE = 0111b or 1xxxb)
No action is taken when a CBC_ILIMIT event happens in this mode.
6.3.21.9 Lock Detection Current Limit (LOCK_ILIMIT)
The lock detection current limit function provides a configurable threshold for limiting the current to prevent 
damage to the system. The MCT8316A-Q1 continuously monitors the output of the current sense amplifier 
(CSA) through the ADC. If at any time, the voltage on the output of CSA exceeds LOCK_ILIMIT for a time longer 
than tLCK_ILIMIT, a LOCK_ILIMIT event is recognized and action is taken according to LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE. The 
threshold is set through LOCK_ILIMIT, the tLCK_ILIMIT is set through LOCK_ILIMIT_DEG. LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE 
can be set to four different modes: LOCK_ILIMIT latched shutdown, LOCK_ILIMIT automatic retry, LOCK_ILIMIT 
report only and LOCK_ILIMIT disabled.
6.3.21.9.1 LOCK_ILIMIT Latched Shutdown (LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE = 00xxb)
When a LOCK_ILIMIT event happens in this mode, the status of MOSFETs will be configured by 
LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE and nFAULT is driven low. Status of MOSFETs during LOCK_ILIMIT:
•
LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE = 0000b: All MOSFETs are turned OFF.

LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE = 0001b: MOSFET which was switching is turned OFF while the one which was 
conducting stays ON till inductive energy is completely recirculated.
•
LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE = 0010b: All high-side MOSFETs are turned ON.
•
LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE = 0011b: All low-side MOSFETs are turned ON.
The CONTROLLER_FAULT and LOCK_ILIMIT bits are set to 1b in the fault status registers. Normal operation 
resumes (gate driver operation and the nFAULT pin is released) when the LOCK_ILIMIT condition clears and a 
clear fault command is issued through the CLR_FLT bit.
6.3.21.9.2 LOCK_ILIMIT Automatic Recovery (LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE = 01xxb)
When a LOCK_ILIMIT event happens in this mode, the status of MOSFETs will be configured by 
LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE and nFAULT is driven low. Status of MOSFETs during LOCK_ILIMIT:
•
LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE = 0100b: All MOSFETs are turned OFF.
•
LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE = 0101b: MOSFET which was switching is turned OFF while the one which was 
conducting stays ON till inductive energy is completely recirculated.
•
LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE = 0110b: All high-side MOSFETs are turned ON
•
LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE = 0111b: All low-side MOSFETs are turned ON
The CONTROLLER_FAULT and LOCK_ILIMIT bits are set to 1b in the fault status registers. Normal operation 
resumes automatically (gate driver operation and the nFAULT pin is released) after the tLCK_RETRY (configured 
by LCK_RETRY) time lapses. The CONTROLLER_FAULT and LOCK_ILIMIT bits are reset to 0b after the 
tLCK_RETRY period expires.
6.3.21.9.3 LOCK_ILIMIT Report Only (LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE = 1000b)
No protective action is taken when a LOCK_ILIMIT event happens in this mode. The lock detection current limit 
event is reported by setting the CONTROLLER_FAULT and LOCK_ILIMIT bits to 1b in the fault status registers. 
The gate drivers continue to operate. The external controller manages this condition by acting appropriately. 
The reporting clears when the LOCK_ILIMIT condition clears and a clear fault command is issued through the 
CLR_FLT bit.
6.3.21.9.4 LOCK_ILIMIT Disabled (LOCK_ILIMIT_MODE = 1xx1b)
No action is taken when a LOCK_ILIMIT event happens in this mode.
6.3.21.10 Thermal Warning (OTW)
If the die temperature exceeds the thermal warning limit (TOTW), the OT and OTW bits in the status register are 
set to 1b. The reporting of OTW on the nFAULT pin can be enabled by setting OTW_REP to 1b. The device 
performs no additional action and continues to function. In this case, the nFAULT pin is released when the die 
temperature decreases below the hysteresis point of the thermal warning limit (TOTW - TOTW_HYS). The OTW bit 
remains set until cleared through the CLR_FLT bit and the die temperature is lower than thermal warning limit. 
(TOTW).
Note
Over-temperature warning (OTW) is not reported on nFAULT pin by default.
6.3.21.11 Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
If the die temperature exceeds the thermal shutdown limit (TTSD), all the FETs are disabled, the charge pump 
is shut down, and the nFAULT pin is driven low. In addition, the DRIVER_FAULT, OT and TSD bit in the status 
register are set to 1b. Normal operation resumes (driver operation and the nFAULT pin is released) when the 
die temperature decreases below the hysteresis point of the thermal shutdown limit (TTSD - TTSD_HYS). The TSD 
bit stays latched high indicating that a thermal event occurred until a clear fault command is issued through the 
CLR_FLT bit. This protection feature cannot be disabled.

6.3.21.12 Motor Lock (MTR_LCK)
The MCT8316A-Q1 continuously checks for different motor lock conditions (see Motor Lock Detection) during 
motor operation. When one of the enabled lock condition happens, a MTR_LCK event is recognized and action 
is taken according to the MTR_LCK_MODE.
In MCT8316A-Q1, all locks can be enabled or disabled individually and retry times can be configured 
through LCK_RETRY . MTR_LCK_MODE bit can operate in four different modes: MTR_LCK latched shutdown, 
MTR_LCK automatic retry, MTR_LCK report only and MTR_LCK disabled.
6.3.21.12.1 MTR_LCK Latched Shutdown (MTR_LCK_MODE = 00xxb)
When a MTR_LCK event happens in this mode, the status of MOSFETs will be configured by MTR_LCK_MODE 
and nFAULT is driven low. Status of MOSFETs during MTR_LCK:
•
MTR_LCK_MODE = 0000b: All MOSFETs are turned OFF.
•
MTR_LCK_MODE = 0001b: MOSFET which was switching is turned OFF while the one which was 
conducting stays ON till inductive energy is completely recirculated.
•
MTR_LCK_MODE = 0010b: All high-side MOSFETs are turned ON.
•
MTR_LCK_MODE = 0011b: All low-side MOSFETs are turned ON.
The CONTROLLER_FAULT, MTR_LCK and respective motor lock condition bits are set to 1b in the fault status 
registers. Normal operation resumes (gate driver operation and the nFAULT pin is released) when the MTR_LCK 
condition clears and a clear fault command is issued through the CLR_FLT bit.
6.3.21.12.2 MTR_LCK Automatic Recovery (MTR_LCK_MODE= 01xxb)
When a MTR_LCK event happens in this mode, the status of MOSFETs will be configured by MTR_LCK_MODE 
and nFAULT is driven low. Status of MOSFETs during MTR_LCK:
•
MTR_LCK_MODE = 0100b: All MOSFETs are turned OFF.
•
MTR_LCK_MODE = 0101b: MOSFET which was switching is turned OFF while the one which was 
conducting stays ON till inductive energy is completely recirculated.
•
MTR_LCK_MODE = 0110b: All high-side MOSFETs are turned ON.
•
MTR_LCK_MODE = 0111b: All low-side MOSFETs are turned ON.
The CONTROLLER_FAULT, MTR_LCK and respective motor lock condition bits are set to 1b in the fault status 
registers. Normal operation resumes automatically (gate driver operation and the nFAULT pin is released) after 
the tLCK_RETRY (configured by LCK_RETRY) time lapses. The CONTROLLER_FAULT, MTR_LCK and respective 
motor lock condition bits are reset to 0b after the tLCK_RETRY period expires.
6.3.21.12.3 MTR_LCK Report Only (MTR_LCK_MODE = 1000b)
No protective action is taken when a MTR_LCK event happens in this mode. The motor lock event is reported 
by setting the CONTROLLER_FAULT, MTR_LCK and respective motor lock condition bits to 1b in the fault 
status registers. The gate drivers continue to operate. The external controller manages this condition by acting 
appropriately. The reporting clears when the MTR_LCK condition clears and a clear fault command is issued 
through the CLR_FLT bit.
6.3.21.12.4 MTR_LCK Disabled (MTR_LCK_MODE = 1xx1b)
No action is taken when a MTR_LCK event happens in this mode.
6.3.21.13 Motor Lock Detection
The MCT8316A-Q1 provides different lock detect mechanisms to determine if the motor is in a locked state. 
Multiple detection mechanisms work together to ensure the lock condition is detected quickly and reliably. In 
addition to detecting if there is a locked motor condition, the MCT8316A-Q1 can also identify and take action if 
there is no motor connected to the system. Each of the lock detect mechanisms and the no-motor detection can 
be disabled by their respective register bits (LOCK1/2/3_EN).

6.3.21.13.1 Lock 1: Abnormal Speed (ABN_SPEED)
MCT8316A-Q1 monitors the speed continuously and at any time the speed exceeds LOCK_ABN_SPEED, an 
ABN_SPEED lock event is recognized and action is taken according to the MTR_LCK_MODE.
threshold is set through the LOCK_ABN_SPEED register. ABN_SPEED lock can be enabled/disabled by 
LOCK1_EN.
6.3.21.13.2 Lock 2: Loss of Sync (LOSS_OF_SYNC)
The motor is commutated by detecting the zero crossing on the phase which is in Hi-Z state. If the motor 
is locked, the back-EMF will disappear and MCT8316A-Q1 will be not able to detect the zero crossing. If 
MCT8316A-Q1 is not able to detect zero crossing for LOSS_SYNC_TIMES number of times, LOSS_OF_SYNC 
event is recognized and action is taken according to the MTR_LCK_MODE. LOSS_OF_SYNC lock can be 
enabled/disabled by LOCK2_EN.
6.3.21.13.3 Lock3: No-Motor Fault (NO_MTR)
The MCT8316A-Q1 continuously monitors the relevant phase current (low-side phase in the present phase 
pattern); if the relevant phase current stays below NO_MTR_THR for a time longer than NO_MTR_DEG_TIME, 
a NO_MTR event is recognized. The response to the NO_MTR event is configured through MTR_LCK_MODE . 
NO_MTR lock can be enabled/disabled by LOCK3_EN.
6.3.21.14 IPD Faults
The MCT8316A-Q1 uses 12-bit timers to estimate the time during the current ramp up and ramp down 
during IPD, when the motor start-up is configured as IPD (MTR_STARTUP is set to 10b). During IPD, 
the algorithm checks for a successful current ramp-up to IPD_CURR_THR, starting with an IPD clock of 
10MHz; if unsuccessful (timer overflow before current reaches IPD_CURR_THR), IPD is repeated with lower 
frequency clocks of 1MHz, 100kHz, and 10kHz sequentially. If the IPD timer overflows (current does not reach 
IPD_CURR_THR) with all the four clock frequencies, then the IPD_T1_FAULT gets triggered. Similarly the 
algorithm check sfor a successful current decay to zero during IPD current ramp down using all the mentioned 
IPD clock frequencies. If the IPD timer overflows (current does not ramp down to zero) in all the four attempts, 
then the IPD_T2_FAULT gets triggered.
IPD gives incorrect results if the next IPD pulse is commanded before the complete decay of current due to 
present IPD pulse. The MCT8316A-Q1 can generate a fault called IPD_FREQ_FAULT during such a scenario . 
The IPD_FREQ_FAULT maybe triggerd if the IPD frequency is too high for the IPD current limit and the IPD 
release mode or if the motor inductance is too high for the IPD frequency, IPD current limit and IPD release 
mode.

6.4.1 Functional Modes
6.4.1.1 Sleep Mode
In sleep mode, the MOSFETs, sense amplifiers, buck regulator, charge pump, AVDD LDO regulator and the 
I2C bus are disabled. The device can be configured to enter sleep (instead of standby) mode by configuring 
DEV_MODE to 1b. SPEED pin determines entry and exit from sleep state as described in Table 6-3.
Note
During power-up and power-down of the device, the nFAULT pin is held low as the internal regulators 
are disabled. After the regulators have been enabled, the nFAULT pin is automatically released.
6.4.1.2 Standby Mode
In standby mode the charge pump, AVDD LDO, buck regulator and I2C bus are active. The device can be 
configured to enter standby mode by configuring DEV_MODE to 0b. SPEED pin determines entry and exit from 
standby state as described in Table 6-3
6.4.1.3 Fault Reset (CLR_FLT)
In the case of latched faults, the device goes into a partial shutdown state to help protect the power MOSFETs 
and system. When the fault condition clears, the device can go to the operating state again by setting the 
CLR_FLT to 1b.

6.5.1 DRVOFF Functionality
When DRVOFF pin is driven high, all six MOSFETs are disabled. In this mode, if SPEED pin is high, the charge 
pump, AVDD regulator, buck regulator and I2C bus are active; driver faults like OCP will be inactive.
6.5.2 DAC outputs
MCT8316A-Q1 has two 12-bit DACs which output analog voltage equivalent of digital variables on DACOUT1 
and DACOUT2 pins with resolution of 12 bits and maximum voltage is 3-V. Signals available on DACOUT 
pins is useful in tracking algorithm variables in real-time and can be used for tuning speed controller 
or motor acceleration time. The address for variables for DACOUT1 and DACOUT2 are configured using 
DACOUT1_VAR_ADDR and DACOUT2_VAR_ADDR. DACOUT1 is available on pin 37 and DACOUT2 can be 
configured on pin 36 by setting DAC_SOX_CONFIG to 00b. DACOUT2 is also available on pin 38.
6.5.3 SOX Output
MCT8316A-Q1 can provide the built-in current sense amplifiers' output on the SOX pin. SOX output is available 
on pin 36 and can be configured by DAC_SOX_CONFIG.

6.5.4 Oscillator Source
MCT8316A-Q1 has a built-in oscillator that is used as the clock source for all digital peripherals and timing 
measurements. Default configuration for MCT8316A-Q1 is to use the internal oscillator and it is sufficient to drive 
the motor without need for any external crystal or clock sources.
In case MCT8316A-Q1 does not meet accuracy requirements of timing measurement or speed loop, then 
MCT8316A-Q1 has an option to support an external clock reference.
In order to improve EMI performance, MCT8316A-Q1 provides the option of modulating the clock frequency by 
enabling Spread Spectrum Modulation (SSM) through SSM_CONFIG
.
6.5.4.1 External Clock Source
Speed loop accuracy of MCT8316A-Q1 over wide operating temperature range can be improved by providing 
more accurate optional clock reference on EXT_CLK pin as shown in Figure 6-50. EXT_CLK will be used to 
calibrate internal clock oscillator and match the accuracy of the external clock. External clock source can be 
selected by configuring CLK_SEL to 11b and setting EXT_CLK_EN to 1b. The external clock source frequency 
can be configured through EXT_CLK_CONFIG.

Oscillator
(60 MHz)

EXT_CLK
Figure 6-50. External Clock Reference
Note
External clock is optional and can be used when higher clock accuracy is needed. MCT8316A-Q1 will 
always power up using the internal oscillator in all modes.
6.5.5 External Watchdog
MCT8316A-Q1 provides an external watchdog feature - EXT_WD_EN bit should be set to 1b to enable the 
external watchdog. When this feature is enabled, the device waits for a tickle (low to high transition in GPIO 
mode, EXT_WD_STATUS_SET set to 1b in I2C mode) from the external watchdog input for a configured time 
interval; if the time interval between two consecutive tickles is higher than the configured time, a watchdog fault 
is triggered. This fault can be configured using EXT_WD_FAULT either as a report only fault or as a latched fault 
with outputs in Hi-Z state. The latched fault can be cleared by writing 1b to CLR_FLT. In case, the next tickle 
arrives before the configured time interval elapses, the watchdog timer is reset and it begins to wait for the next 
tickle. This can be used to continuously monitor the health of an external MCU (which is the external watchdog 
input) and put the MCT8316A-Q1 outputs in Hi-Z in case the external MCU is in an erroneous state.
The external watchdog input is selected using EXT_WD_INPUT and can either be the EXT_WD pin or the I2C 
interface . The time interval between two tickles to trigger a watchdog fault is configured by EXT_WD_FREQ; 
there are 4 time (frequency) settings - 100 (10Hz), 200 (5Hz), 500 (2Hz) and 1000ms (1Hz).

6.6 EEPROM access and I2C interface
6.6.1 EEPROM Access
MCT8316A-Q1 has 1024 bits (16 rows of 64 bits each) of EEPROM, which are used to store the motor 
configuration parameters. Erase operations are row-wise (all 64 bits are erased in a single erase operation), but 
32-bit write and read operations are supported. EEPROM can be written and read using the I2C serial interface 
but erase cannot be performed using I2C serial interface. The shadow registers corresponding to the EEPROM 
are located at addresses 0x000080-0x0000AE.
Note
MCT8316A-Q1 allows EEPROM write and read operations only when the motor is not spinning.

6.6.1.2 EEPROM Read
In MCT8316A-Q1, EEPROM read procedure is as follows,
1.
Write 0x40000000 into register 0x0000E6 to read the EEPROM data into the shadow registers 
(0x000080-0x0000AE).
2.
Wait for 100ms for the EEPROM read operation to complete.
3.
Read the shadow register values, 1 or 2 registers at a time, using the I2C read command as explained 
in Section 6.6.2. Shadow register addresses are in the range of 0x000080-0x0000AE. Register address 
increases in steps of 2 for 32-bit read operation (since each address is a 16-bit location).
6.6.2 I2C Serial Interface
MCT8316A-Q1 interfaces with an external MCU over an I2C serial interface. MCT8316A-Q1 is an I2C target 
to be interfaced with a controller. External MCU can use this interface to read/write from/to any non-reserved 
register in MCT8316A-Q1
Note
For reliable communication, a 100-µs delay should be used between every byte transferred over the 
I2C bus.

bit. Every packet in MCT8316A-Q1 the communication protocol starts with writing a 24-bit control word and 
hence the R/W bit is always 0.
24-bit Control Word: The Target Address is followed by a 24-bit control bit. The control word format is shown in

Each field in the control word is explained in detail below.
OP_R/W – Read/Write: R/W bit gives information on whether this is a read operation or write operation. 
Bit value 0 indicates it is a write operation. Bit value 1 indicates it is a read operation. For write operation, 
MCT8316A-Q1 will expect data bytes to be sent after the 24-bit control word. For read operation, MCT8316A-Q1 
will expect an I2C read request with repeated start or normal start after the 24-bit control word.
CRC_EN – Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC) Enable: MCT8316A-Q1 supports CRC to verify the data integrity. 
This bit controls whether the CRC feature is enabled or not.
DLEN – Data Length: DLEN field determines the length of the data that will be sent by external MCU to 
MCT8316A-Q1. MCT8316A-Q1 protocol supports three data lengths: 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit.

MEM_SEC – Memory Section: Each memory location in MCT8316A-Q1 is addressed using three separate 
entities in the control word – Memory Section, Memory Page, Memory Address. Memory Section is a 4-bit field 
which denotes the memory section to which the memory location belongs like RAM, ROM etc.
MEM_PAGE – Memory Page: Memory page is a 4-bit field which denotes the memory page to which the 
memory location belongs.
MEM_ADDR – Memory Address: Memory address is the last 12-bits of the address. The complete 22-bit 
address is constructed internally by MCT8316A-Q1 using all three fields – Memory Section, Memory Page, 
Memory Address. For memory locations 0x000000-0x000800, memory section is 0x0, memory page is 0x0 and 
memory address is the lowest 12 bits(0x000 for 0x000000, 0x080 for 0x000080 and 0x800 for 0x000800)
Data Bytes: For a write operation to MCT8316A-Q1, the 24-bit control word is followed by data bytes. The DLEN 
field in the control word should correspond with the number of bytes sent in this section.
CRC Byte: If the CRC feature is enabled in the control word, CRC byte has to be sent at the end of a write 
transaction. Procedure to calculate CRC is explained in CRC Byte Calculation below.
6.6.2.2 I2C Write Operation
MCT8316A-Q1 write operation over I2C involves the following sequence.
1.
I2C start condition.
2.
The sequence starts with I2C target start byte, made up of 7-bit target ID (0x00) to identify the MCT8316A-
Q1 along with the R/W bit set to 0.
3.
The start byte is followed by 24-bit control word. Bit 23 in the control word has to be 0 as it is a write 
operation.
4.
The 24-bit control word is then followed by the data bytes. The length of the data byte depends on the DLEN 
field.
a.
While sending data bytes, the LSB byte is sent first. Refer below examples for more details.
b.
16-bit/32-bit write – The data sent is written to the address mentioned in Control Word.
c.
64-bit Write – 64-bit is treated as two 32-bit writes. The address mentioned in Control word is taken as 
Addr 0. Addr 1 is calculating internally by MCT8316A-Q1 by incrementing Addr 0 by 2. A total of 8 data 
bytes are sent. The first 4 bytes (sent in LSB first way) are written to Addr 0 and the next 4 bytes are 
written to Addr 1.
5.
If CRC is enabled, the packet ends with a CRC byte. CRC is calculated for the entire packet (Target ID + W 
bit, Control Word, Data Bytes).

6.6.2.3 I2C Read Operation
MCT8316A-Q1 read operation over I2C involves the following sequence.
1.
I2C start condition.
2.
The sequence starts with I2C target Start Byte.
3.
The Start Byte is followed by 24-bit Control Word. Bit 23 in the control word has to be 1 as it is a read 
operation.
4.
The control word is followed by a repeated start or normal start.
5.
MCT8316A-Q1 sends the data bytes on SDA. The number of bytes sent by MCT8316A-Q1 depends on the 
DLEN field value in the control word.
a.
While sending data bytes, the LSB byte is sent first. Refer the examples below for more details.
b.
16-bit/32-bit Read – The data from the address mentioned in Control Word is sent back.
c.
64-bit Read – 64-bit is treated as two 32-bit read. The address mentioned in Control Word is taken as 
Addr 0. Addr 1 is calculating internally by MCT8316A-Q1 by incrementing Addr 0 by 2. A total of 8 data 
bytes are sent by MCT8316A-Q1. The first 4 bytes (sent in LSB first way) are read from Addr 0 and the 
next 4 bytes are read from Addr 1.
d.
MCT8316A-Q1 takes some time to process the control word and read data from the given address. This 
involves some delay. It is quite possible that the repeated start with Target ID will be NACK’d. If the 
I2C read request has been NACK’d by MCT8316A-Q1, retry after few cycles. During this retry, it is not 
necessary to send the entire packet along with the control word. It is sufficient to send only the start

If CRC is enabled, then MCT8316A-Q1 sends an additional CRC byte at the end. If CRC is enabled, external 
MCU I2C controller has to read this additional byte before sending the stop bit. CRC is calculated for the 
entire packet (Target ID + W bit, Control Word, Target ID + R bit, Data Bytes).

6.6.2.5 Internal Buffers
MCT8316A-Q1 uses buffers internally to store the data received on I2C. Highest priority is given to collecting 
data on the I2C Bus. There are 2 buffers (ping-pong) for I2C Rx Data and 2 buffers (ping-pong) for I2C Tx Data.
A write request from external MCU is stored in Rx Buffer 1 and then the parsing block is triggered to work on 
this data in Rx Buffer 1. While MCT8316A-Q1 is processing a write packet from Rx Buffer 1, if there is another 
new read/write request, the entire data from the I2C bus is stored in Rx Buffer 2 and it will be processed after the 
current request.
MCT8316A-Q1 can accommodate a maximum of two consecutive read/write requests. If MCT8316A-Q1 is busy 
due to high priority interrupts, the data sent will be stored in internal buffers (Rx Buffer 1 and Rx Buffer 2). At this 
point, if there is a third read/write request, the Target ID will be NACK’d as the buffers are already full.
During read operations, the read request is processed and the read data from the register is stored in the Tx 
Buffer along with the CRC byte, if enabled. Now if the external MCU initiates an I2C Read (Target ID + R bit), 
the data from this Tx Buffer is sent over I2C. Since there are two Tx Buffers, register data from 2 MCT8316A-Q1 
reads can be buffered. Given this scenario, if there is a third read request, the control word will be stored in the 
Rx Buffer 1, but it will not be processed by MCT8316A-Q1 as the Tx Buffers are full.
Once a data is read from Tx Buffer, the data is no longer stored in the Tx buffer. The buffer is cleared and it 
becomes available for the next data to be stored. If the read transaction was interrupted in between and if the 
MCU had not read all the bytes, external MCU can initiate another I2C read (only I2C read, without any control 
word information) to read all the data bytes from first.
6.6.2.6 CRC Byte Calculation
An 8-bit CCIT polynomial (x8 + x2+ x + 1) is used for CRC computation.
CRC Calculation in Write Operation: When the external MCU writes to MCT8316A-Q1, if the CRC is enabled, 
the external MCU has to compute an 8-bit CRC byte and add the CRC byte at the end of the data. MCT8316A-

Q1 will compute CRC using the same polynomial internally and if there is a mismatch, the write request is 
discarded. Input data for CRC calculation by external MCU for write operation are listed below:
1.
Target ID + write bit.
2.
Control word – 3 bytes
3.
Data bytes – 2/4/8 bytes
CRC Calculation in Read Operation: When the external MCU reads from MCT8316A-Q1, if the CRC is 
enabled, MCT8316A-Q1 sends the CRC byte at the end of the data. The CRC computation in read operation 
involves the start byte, control words sent by external MCU along with data bytes sent by MCT8316A-Q1. Input 
data for CRC calculation by external MCU to verify the data sent by MCT8316A-Q1 are listed below :
1.
Target ID + write bit
2.
Control word – 3 bytes
3.
Target ID + read bit
4.
Data bytes – 2/4/8 bytes

7.2.1.3 Faster startup time
Startup time is the time taken for the motor to reach the target speed from zero speed. Faster startup time can 
be achieved in MCT8316A by tuning motor startup, open loop and closed loop settings. Figure 7-5 shows FG, 
phase current and motor electrical speed waveform. Motor takes 50 ms to reach target speed from zero speed.

7.2.1.4 Setting the BEMF threshold
The BEMF_THRESHOLD1 and BEMF_THRESHOLD2 values used for commutation instant detection in 
MCT8316A can be computed from the motor phase voltage waveforms during coasting. For example, consider 
the three-phase voltage waveforms of a BLDC motor while coasting as in Figure 7-6. The motor phase voltage 
during coasting is the motor back-EMF.

In Figure 7-6, one floating phase voltage interval is denoted by the vertical markers on channel 3. The Vpeak 
(peak-peak back-EMF) on channel 3 is 208mV and Tc (commutation interval) is 2.22ms as denoted by the 
horizontal and vertical markers on channel 3. The digital equivalent counts for Vpeak and Tc are calculated as 
follows.
In MCT8316A, a 3V analog input corresponds to 4095 counts(12-bit) and phase voltage is scaled down by 
10x factor before ADC input; therfore, Vpeak of 208mV corresponds to an ADC input of 20.8mV, which in turn 
equals 29 ADC counts. Assuming the PWM switching frequency is 25kHz, one back-EMF sample is available 
every 40μs. So, in a time interval of 2.22ms, a total of 55 back-EMF samples are integrated. Therefore, the 
BEMF_THRESHOLD1 or BEMF_THRESHOLD2 value calculated as per is (½) * (29/2) * (55/2) = 199. Hence, in 
this example, BEMF_THRESHOLD1 and BEMF_THRESHOLD2 are set to 8h (corresponding to 200 which is the 
closest value to 199) for commutation instant detection using back-EMF integration method during fast start-up. 
The exact speed at which the Vpeak and Tc values are measured to calculate the BEMF_THRESHOLD1 and 
BEMF_THRESHOLD2 values is not critical (as long as there is sufficient resolution in digital counts) since the 
product (Vpeak * Tc) is, largely, a constant for a given BLDC motor.

7.2.1.6 Faster deceleration
MCT8316A has features to decelerate the motor quickly. Figure 7-8 shows phase current and motor electrical 
speed waveform when the motor decelerates from 100% duty cycle to 10% duty cycle. Time taken for the motor 
to decelerate from 100% duty cycle to 10% duty cycle when fast deceleration is disabled is around 10 seconds. 
Figure 7-9 shows phase current and motor electrical speed waveform when the motor decelerates from 100% 
duty cycle to 10% duty cycle. Time taken for the motor to decelerate from 100% duty cycle to 10% duty cycle 
when fast deceleration is enabled is around 1.5 seconds.

7.3 Power Supply Recommendations
7.3.1 Bulk Capacitance
Having an appropriate local bulk capacitance is an important factor in motor drive system design. It is generally 
beneficial to have more bulk capacitance, while the disadvantages are increased cost and physical size.
The amount of local capacitance needed depends on a variety of factors, including:
•
The highest current required by the motor system
•
The capacitance and current capability of the power supply
•
The amount of parasitic inductance between the power supply and motor system
•
The acceptable voltage ripple
•
The type of motor used (brushed DC, brushless DC, stepper)
•
The motor braking method
The inductance between the power supply and the motor drive system limits the rate at which current can 
change from the power supply. If the local bulk capacitance is too small, the system responds to excessive 
current demands or dumps from the motor with a change in VM voltage. When adequate bulk capacitance is 
used, the VM voltage remains stable and high current can be quickly supplied.
The data sheet generally provides a recommended value, but system-level testing is required to determine the 
appropriate bulk capacitor.

Figure 7-10. Example Setup of Motor Drive System With External Power Supply
The voltage rating for bulk capacitors should be higher than the operating voltage, to provide margin for cases 
when the motor transfers energy to the supply.
7.4 Layout
7.4.1 Layout Guidelines
The bulk capacitor should be placed to minimize the distance of the high-current path through the motor driver 
device. The connecting metal trace widths should be as wide as possible, and numerous vias should be used 
when connecting PCB layers. These practices minimize parasitic inductance and allow the bulk capacitor to 
deliver high current.
Small-value capacitors should be ceramic, and placed closely to device pins.
The high-current device outputs should use wide metal traces.
To reduce noise coupling and EMI interference from large transient currents into small-current signal paths, 
grounding should be partitioned between PGND and AGND. TI recommends connecting all non-power stage 
circuitry (including the thermal pad) to AGND to reduce parasitic effects and improve power dissipation from the 
device. Optionally, GND_BK can be split. Ensure grounds are connected through net-ties or wide resistors to 
reduce voltage offsets and maintain gate driver performance.
The device thermal pad should be soldered to the PCB top-layer ground plane. Multiple vias should be used to 
connect to a large bottom-layer ground plane. The use of large metal planes and multiple vias helps dissipate 
the I2 × RDS(on) heat that is generated in the device.
To improve thermal performance, maximize the ground area that is connected to the thermal pad ground across 
all possible layers of the PCB. Using thick copper pours can lower the junction-to-air thermal resistance and 
improve thermal dissipation from the die surface.
Separate the SW_BK and FB_BK traces with ground separation to reduce buck switching from coupling as noise 
into the buck outer feedback loop. Widen the FB_BK trace as much as possible to allow for faster load switching.
Figure 7-11 shows a layout example for the MCT8316A-Q1. Also, for layout example, refer to MCT8316A-Q1 
EVM.

7.4.3 Thermal Considerations
The MCT8316A-Q1 has thermal shutdown (TSD) as previously described. A die temperature in excess of 150°C 
(minimally) disables the device until the temperature drops to a safe level.
Any tendency of the device to enter thermal shutdown is an indication of excessive power dissipation, insufficient 
heatsinking, or too high an ambient temperature.
7.4.3.1 Power Dissipation
The power dissipated in the output FET resistance (RDS(on)) dominates power dissipation in MCT8316A.
At start-up and fault conditions, the FET current is much higher than normal operating FET current; remember to 
take these peak currents and their duration into consideration.
The total device power dissipation is the power dissipated in each of the three half-bridges added together along 
with standby power, LDO and buck regulator losses.
The maximum amount of power that the device can dissipate depends on ambient temperature and heatsinking.
Note that RDS(on) increases with temperature, so as the device heats, the power dissipation increases. Take this 
into consideration when sizing the heatsink.
A summary of equations for calculating each loss is shown below in Table 7-3.
