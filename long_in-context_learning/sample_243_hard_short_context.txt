## Creating a New SOLIDWORKS Document

New documents use templates as the basis for their format and properties.

Templates include user-defined document properties, such as units of measure or other detailing standards. Templates allow you to maintain different styles of documents. A document template can be a part, drawing, or assembly that you saved as a template.

To create a new SOLIDWORKS document:

1.  Click New ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/gwz1490020198065.image) (Standard toolbar) or File > New.
2.  In the dialog box, select:
  
    | Option                                                       | Description                                                  |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Novice                                                       | Displays icons and explanations of part, assembly, and drawing documents. |
    | The templates specified in System Options > Default Templates are used when you create new documents from the Novice page. |                                                              |
    
    If you create a new document when in a SOLIDWORKS tutorial, a tutorial template is used. The tutorial template uses the appropriate units, view orientations, and other properties for the tutorial lesson.
    
     |
    | Advanced | Displays the template icons on various tabs.
    
    You can:
    
    +   See previews as you select templates.
    +   Access the tutorial templates on the Tutorial tab.
    +   Select the display types: Large Icons ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/lek1568898868959.image), List ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/ohj1568898874891.image), or List Details ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/qqd1568898880807.image).
    
    
    
     |
    
3.  Select a type of document.
4.  Click OK.
  
    You can create new documents from the Welcome dialog box. Like the Novice page in the New SOLIDWORKS Document dialog box, the new documents use the templates specified in System Options > Default Templates.
    

## Document Templates

Templates are part, drawing, and assembly documents that include user-defined parameters and are the basis for new documents.

You can maintain many different document templates. For example, you can create:

+   A document template using millimeters and another template using inches
+   A document template using ANSI and another template using ISO dimensioning standard
+   A template for detached drawings

You can organize and access your document templates by placing them on different tabs in the Advanced display of the New SOLIDWORKS Document dialog box.

Templates can include settings for such Document Properties as:

+   grid spacing
+   extension line and break line gap
+   balloon bent leader length
+   text scale and text display size
+   material density

    The destination path automatically changes to the default template folder when you select a template type for Save as type.
    
9.  Type a name for File name.
10.  **Optional:** Browse to another folder.
11.  Save the file.

## Units and Dimension Standard

You can set the initial units system and dimension standard for default templates (new part, assembly, and drawing templates).

The dialog box appears the first time you open a template. Select from the following lists:

Units:

+   IPS (inch, pound, second)
+   MMGS (millimeter, gram, second)
+   CGS (centimeter, gram, second)
+   MKS (meter, kilogram, second)

Dimension standard: ANSI, ISO, DIN, JIS, BSI, GOST, GB.

In the application, you can change these settings for individual documents and for your document templates.

+   Unit system for individual documents, go to Tools > Options > Document Properties > Units.

Available for all document types.").

## Default Templates Options

You can specify the default templates to use for creating new part, drawing, and assembly documents.

The default templates are used when you create new documents from one of the following dialog boxes:

+   New SOLIDWORKS Document (Novice page)
+   Welcome

The default templates are also used during operations where the SOLIDWORKS application creates a new document without prompting you for a template, such as:

+   Creating a derived part
+   Creating a mirrored part
+   Importing a file from another application
+   Opening a SOLIDWORKS future version file
+   Splitting a part and saving the bodies as parts

To prepare a document template for use as a default, create the template, add it to a template tab, and specify the template location.

To change the default template:

1.  Click Options ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/lgh1470851264466.image) or Tools > Options.
2.  Select Default Templates.

    +   Prompt user to select document template
6.  Click OK.

Click Reset to restore factory defaults for all system options or only for options on this page.

## Creating Additional Template Tabs

You can create additional tabs to organize custom templates that you create. The tabs appear on the Advanced page of the New SOLIDWORKS Document dialog box.

When you open a new SOLIDWORKS document, you select a template for that document in the New SOLIDWORKS Document dialog box. System templates are available, but you can add tabs for your own templates. Each tab corresponds to a Windows folder.

With custom tabs, you can manage the placement, access, and organization of your templates:

+   Create folders on any drive, including hard drives, floppy drives, or network drives.
+   Share the contents of network folders, or restrict access to folders.
+   Arrange folder contents to reflect your work environment.

To create a new tab on the Advanced page of the New SOLIDWORKS Document dialog box:

1.  In File Explorer, create a new folder and give it the name you want for the tab.
2.  Move one or more document templates into the new folder.
  
    To appear as a tab, a folder must contain at least one template.
    
3.  In the SOLIDWORKS software, click Options ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/lgh1470851264466.image) or Tools > Options.

## Displaying Document Open Time in File Explorer

The file property, Last Open Time, appears in a tooltip when you hover the pointer over a SOLIDWORKS part, assembly, or drawing document in File Explorer.

Last Open Time displays the time it took for the SOLIDWORKS software to open the file, the last time it was opened. This file property is helpful for managing your time when you have large data sets that are time consuming to open.

The time displays in minutes and seconds, and is available for models that are opened directly from disk saved in SOLIDWORKS 2018. For assemblies opened in Lightweight mode, the tooltip displays Last LW Open Time.

Last Open Time does not update in reference files when they are saved while open in memory, but does update when the reference files are saved while open in their own window.

You can add a column in the Details view of File Explorer to display SW Open Time. You can identify files saved in earlier versions of the SOLIDWORKS software by adding a column for SW Last Save with.

To add columns for SW Open Time and SW Last Save with in File Explorer:

1.  Open a folder with SOLIDWORKS documents.
  
    The contents of that folder appear in the Details view of File Explorer.
    
2.  In the Details view, right-click on the header. Typically, the header displays columns for Name, Type, and Size. Then in the context menu, select More.
  
    The Choose Details dialog box appears.
    
3.  Under Details, scroll to SW Last Save With and SW Open Time. You can select one or both options.
4.  Click OK.

## Opening Existing Part, Assembly, or Drawing Documents

This information applies to SOLIDWORKS if you enable the Design with SOLIDWORKS app.

If you have legacy files on a local or remote disk, when you open and save them to the **3D**EXPERIENCE platform, the software uploads them directly to the platform. They are not copied to the MyWork local cache.

The benefit of this is that when you save assemblies that refer to data on the local disk, the system identifies that the data is already saved and does not create duplicate data. You can incrementally save data without creating duplicates.

If you open a model from the local drive, modify it and then save it to the platform, the original file is modified because you are working on the model that you opened from the local drive.

If you delete or move a file from where it was originally located on the disk when you saved it to the platform, the system downloads the file to the MyWork local cache when you open the file from the platform.

If you enable Autoname, the software overrides this behavior and copies data to the MyWork local cache before saving the data to the platform.

## Using the Open Tool

You can use the Open tool to browse for and open existing part, assembly, or drawing documents. Filters let you specify the type of document to browse for.

To open existing part, assembly, or drawing documents:

1.  Click Open ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/ulu1467290286542.image) (Standard toolbar) or File > Open, or press Ctrl+O.
2.  **Optional:** **3D**EXPERIENCE Users: If the Open from 3DEXPERIENCE dialog box appears, click This PC.
  
    To switch between Open dialog boxes, click This PC to open local files, or Open from 3DEXPERIENCE to open files from the **3D**EXPERIENCE platform.
    
3.  In the dialog box, select a file type in Files of type or use the quick filter options to view commonly used SOLIDWORKS file types in any combination.
4.  Browse to select a document or documents.
  
    Text appears in the Description field if a description exists in the document properties or was added when the document was saved.
    
5.  Select options in the dialog box.
6.  Click Open to open the document.
  
    When opening files from a previous release of SOLIDWORKS, the files may open slowly. SOLIDWORKS Task Scheduler converts files so they open more rapidly.
    

## Opening Drawings from Part or Assembly Documents

You can use the Open Drawing tool to open existing drawings associated with the active part or assembly document.

+   The tool is available on the File menu and on context toolbars.
+   You can add the tool to mouse gestures and assign a keyboard shortcut.
+   You can add the tool to the CommandManager or toolbars. Click Tools > Customize > Commands > Standard and drag Open Drawing ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/fwd1511346793293.image) to a toolbar or CommandManager location.

To open an existing drawing of the active part or assembly document:

+   Do one of the following:
  
    +   Click File > Open Drawing.
    +   Right-click the top item in the FeatureManager design tree or a blank region in the graphics area and select Open Drawing ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/fwd1511346793293.image).

SOLIDWORKS looks for a drawing with the same name as the model, in the same folder as the model. If the drawing exists, it opens automatically. If such a drawing is not found, a browse window appears so you can locate a drawing manually.

When there is more than one open and unsaved drawing for a model, a message prompts you to select the drawing to open from the Browse Open Documents dialog box.

## Opening Components from Assembly Documents

While you are editing an assembly, you can open its associated component documents (parts or subassemblies) in their own windows. Any changes that you make to the components automatically update the assembly.

To open a component from an assembly document:

In the assembly window, do one of the following:

The component document opens in a separate window.

## Opening Assemblies from Part Documents

While you are editing a part with in-context features, you can open the assembly document where the features were created.

To open an assembly from a part document:

1.  In the part window, right-click a feature or sketch in the FeatureManager design tree or graphics area that has an external reference.
2.  Select Edit In Context.
  
    The assembly that contains the update path for the selected feature opens in a separate window.
    

## Open Dialog Box

To open existing part, assembly, or drawing documents, do one of the following:

## Opening Part Configurations in Quick View Mode

When you open a part in Quick View mode, you can specify the configuration to open. You can also do this in eDrawings®.

Before you open a specified configuration in Quick View mode, you need to specify which configurations are available in Quick View mode. Open the part in Resolved mode first to determine which configurations are visible to other users.

To open part configurations in Quick View mode:

1.  Open a part.
2.  In the ConfigurationManager, right-click the configurations to include and click Add Display Data Mark:
  
    The configurations are marked with ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/glr1524160553041.image) icons. The other configurations remain the same.
    
3.  Save and close the part.
4.  Click Open ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/ulu1467290286542.image) or File > Open.
5.  **Optional:** **3D**EXPERIENCE Users: If the Open from 3DEXPERIENCE dialog box appears, click This PC.
6.  In the dialog box:
  
    1.  Select the part.
    2.  In Mode, select Quick View ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/vnw1489587667521.image).
    3.  In Configurations, select the configuration to open.
      
        Only the configurations you selected in step 2 are available to select.
        
    4.  Click Open.
    
    The part opens in the selected configuration in Quick View mode.
    

## Dismissing All Prompts for Missing Components

You can dismiss all prompts for missing components for the document you are opening.

Select Suppress all missing components in the Unable to locate file dialog box that appears when a document cannot locate a referenced file.

This option affects only the current document. This option does not permanently dismiss all Unable to locate file dialog boxes for all documents.

## Multi-Threaded Retrieval

Saved documents are retrieved in multi-threaded mode.

When you retrieve a large part, drawing, or assembly document, the document immediately displays in a view-only state while the actual document and all its components are retrieved in the background. During the view-only state, you can use all functions supported in the eDrawings Viewer (Zoom and Rotate), but you cannot switch to another document or start to open another document. After the retrieval is complete, SOLIDWORKS changes to the normal edit state.

## Open Model in Position

When you open a part or subassembly from an assembly or drawing document, you can open the model in the same view position and orientation as seen in the assembly or drawing view.

Do one of the following:

## Opening Auto-Recovered Documents

You can open an auto-recovered document from the Alerts tab of the Welcome Dialog Box. You can delete the file, or save the file by replacing the original file or by creating a file.

You can open the Welcome dialog box by clicking Welcome to SOLIDWORKS ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/dqg1484582439591.image) (Standard toolbar).

To delete an auto-recovered document, right-click the document and click Delete.

## Opening Document Copies

After opening or modifying a document, you can save it as a copy and open the new copy automatically. References to the original document are not assigned to the copy.

To copy a document and open the copy:

1.  With the document open, click File > Save As.
2.  **Optional:** **3D**EXPERIENCE Users: If the Save As New dialog box appears, click Save to This PC.
3.  In the dialog box, select Save as copy and open.
4.  For File name, type a new name.
5.  Set other options and click Save.

## Dragging Files

+   Drag a part or assembly from File Explorer or the File Explorer tab in the Task Pane to an open SOLIDWORKS assembly window to add an instance of the part or subassembly to the assembly.
+   Drag a part or assembly from File Explorer or the File Explorer tab in the Task Pane to an open and empty SOLIDWORKS drawing document to create a Standard 3 View drawing of the part or assembly.
+   Drag a zipped (.zip) file into an empty SOLIDWORKS window, or an empty area of an open SOLIDWORKS document.
  
    The SOLIDWORKS software opens the zipped files based on where you drop the zipped file. For example, if you drag a .zip file that contains several models into an empty SOLIDWORKS window, each model opens in its own window.
    
    The .zip file can contain any file type supported by the SOLIDWORKS software. If the .zip file contains several SOLIDWORKS files and an imported file, such as an .igs file, the .igs file opens in a separate window.
    
    If the .zip file contains models that are not on your local computer (if you dragged the .zip file from the Internet), the Select Folder dialog box appears for you to download the .zip file to a location on your local computer.
    
+   Drag hyperlinked SOLIDWORKS part files from Internet Explorer to:
  
    +   the Design Library tab in the Task Pane
    +   a new, empty part document
    +   an empty area of a SOLIDWORKS window
    +   a drawing or assembly document
    
    If you drop the file into a drawing or an assembly, you are prompted to name the new file on your local disk.
    
+   Drag between open documents. Drag a part name from the FeatureManager design tree of an open part file to insert it into an open assembly document.

## New File Name

These options only appear when you enable autoname on the **3D**EXPERIENCE platform and the Title is different from the Name. If you are packaging files that are stored on the **3D**EXPERIENCE platform, you can select the following options to change the file names.

<table summary="" class="table"><tbody class="tbody"><tr class="row"><td class="entry nocellnorowborder"><span class="ph uicontrol">Use Title as File Name</span></td><td class="entry nocellnorowborder">File names in the package are based on the titles of the files.</td></tr><tr class="row"><td class="entry row-nocellborder"><span class="ph uicontrol">Use Name as File Name</span></td><td class="entry row-nocellborder">File names in the package are based on the names of the files.</td></tr></tbody></table>

If Pack and Go detects that multiple files refer to the same Title, you must specify a unique file name for each file before you can save files. The New Filename column highlights the duplicate file names in red. Double-click each file name and, in the Select/Replace dialog box, enter the unique file name.

For details about autoname, see [Settings in 3DEXPERIENCE Platform](https://help.3ds.com/HelpDS.aspx?P=11&F=swsadminmap/sws-r-adminsettings.htm) in Dassault Systèmes User Assistance. Access to Dassault Systèmes User Assistance requires **3D**EXPERIENCE credentials.

## Closing Documents

## Close

To close the document in the active window:

Click Close ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/ggc1467289484446.image) (Standard toolbar), or File > Close or press Ctrl + W.

To close all documents open in the current SOLIDWORKS session, click Window > Close All.

You can also close documents from the Open Documents list (Window menu or Open Documents browser).

## Close All

Closes all open documents.

If a new or changed document has not been saved, the program asks you to confirm whether you want to save the document or rebuild the part.

To close all documents:

1.  Click Window > Close All.
2.  Respond to confirmation requests from the SOLIDWORKS application to save or not save documents when they are closed. This also applies to the Design With SOLIDWORKS app.

## Multi-User Environment

Manage write access for shared documents in a multi-user environment.

The multi-user environment provides read/write access control and tracking for two or more users working with the same files concurrently. Users share a file when they have loaded the same file from the same location.

Tooltips in the FeatureManager design tree inform you if a part, assembly, subassembly, or component is read-only. If another user with write access has the document open, the tooltip names the user.

Files that are read-only appear in orange under Open in SOLIDWORKS ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/yqh1450446872772.image) on the File Explorer tab in the Task Pane.

Files that have been modified since they were last saved appear in bold under Open in SOLIDWORKS ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/yqh1450446872772.image) on the File Explorer tab in the Task Pane.

If you start to make changes to a read-only document, a message warns you that the document is read-only.

## Options

In Tools > Options > System Options > Collaboration:

+   Enable the multi-user environment.
+   Enable Add shortcut menu items for multi-user environment menu items so that you can select options Make Read-Only and Get Write Access on shortcut menus.
+   Specify an interval for checking if files opened with read-only status have been modified by other users.

In Tools > Options > System Options > External References:

+   To allow other users to work on components while you have an assembly open, select Open referenced documents with read-only access.
+   To prevent a message box from appearing whenever you make a document read-only, select Don't prompt to save read-only referenced documents (discard changes).

When you select Don't prompt to save read-only referenced documents, read-only references are not displayed in the Save Modified Documents dialog box.

## Read/Write Status

To set the status for a part or assembly document:

+   Click File > Make Read-Only or File > Get Write Access.

To set the status for an assembly component:

+   Right-click a component in the FeatureManager design tree or in the graphics area and select Make Read-Only or Get Write Access.

You can also set read/write status in the Reload dialog box.

## Reload

Reload documents to get the latest version. For example, if you have a document open as read-only and another user modifies the document, you can reload to view the modified version.

Contents

+   **[Reload](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/HIDD_FILE_RELOAD_MULTIPLE.htm)**
  
    Allows you to reload documents. This is useful, for example, if, in a multi-user environment, you have read-only access and want to reload the latest version with any changes made by another user.
    
+   **[Check Read-only Files](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/t_check_read_only_files.htm)**
  
    Checks if files have been made available for write access or have changed on disk since the last reload.
    

## Reload

Allows you to reload documents. This is useful, for example, if, in a multi-user environment, you have read-only access and want to reload the latest version with any changes made by another user.

You can also set document read/write status in the Reload dialog box and undo changes since the last Save operation.

To open the Reload dialog box, do one of the following:

If Advanced Settings is available, it provides additional vendor-specific options.

## Print3D

You can use Print3D to print 3D prototypes of your models when you have a 3D printer installed locally.

SOLIDWORKS supports 3D printing of models that contain surface bodies and graphics bodies only if they form a watertight manifold volume. You can 3D print surfaces or graphics bodies, provided they form a watertight manifold volume. Bodies that do not form a watertight manifold volume are temporarily hidden and bodies that form a watertight manifold volume are 3D printed.

If your 3D printer manufacturer uses the SOLIDWORKS 3D Print API, the 3D printing rapid prototyping dialog box opens to assist you in printing.

Microsoft's Windows 3D printing flow uses an XML-based data format called 3D Manufacturing Format (3MF). Software applications that support this format convert their data to 3MF format and send it to the operating system's print spooler for 3D printing.

With your CAD design open in SOLIDWORKS, you can open the Print3D PropertyManager by clicking File > Print3D ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/rcb1559227349524.image).

In the PropertyManager, you can specify options on the Settings and Preview tabs:

+   Select a printer from a list of available printers.
+   Orient and scale your model within the print volume defined by the selected printer.
+   Select print options for quality, infill percentage (density), supports, and raft.
+   Save the file to a format used for 3D printing.
+   Run preview analyses to evaluate the current print job.
+   Identify faces that require support.
+   Display striation lines to determine whether the print resolution is sufficiently fine.

## Printing a Model in 3D

You can print directly to a 3D Printer from the SOLIDWORKS software.

If your 3D printer manufacturer uses the SOLIDWORKS 3D Print API, the 3D Printing dialog box opens to assist you in printing.

After you set the print options in the Print3D PropertyManager, Windows handles the communication with the 3D printer. A preview of the print bed and the model's location within the print bed lets you modify settings before committing to a 3D print job.

To print to a 3D printer:

1.  Click File > Print3D.
2.  Under Printer, select a printer from the list of available 3D printers.
  
    The Width, Depth, and Height of the printer display .
    
3.  Under Print Bed Location, in Bottom plane of modelselect a reference plane.
  
    A preview shows the model within the print volume. If the model falls outside the print volume, click ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/zmp1525374365200.image) to reverse the orientation.
    
    If you select a model face or plane before opening the Print3D PropertyManager, it appears as the reference plane.
    
    If your plane selection results in part of the model extending beyond the print volume, you cannot print. The area outside the print volume is highlighted. If you click ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/ghy1608673255360.image), a warning appears in the Message area.
    
    In the example above, an extrusion extends beyond the print volume. You can solve the problem by selecting the face of the extrusion.
    
    Or you can suppress the feature that extends beyond the print volume.
    
4.  Under Model orientation, use the controls to position the model within the print volume.
  
    Use Print Bed Angle ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/gzw1482511025708.image) to rotate the print volume around the model:
    
    ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/pin1450448537544.image)
    
    Use the Translation controls ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/pgo1450448538268.image) and ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/rfy1450448553684.image) to move the print volume in the direction of the axis.
    
5.  Under Scale:
  
    1.  Hover over the scale value.
      
        The default scale value is 1, which is the size of the model in the software.
        
        The software calculates the maximum scale factor and informs you of this limit.
        
        When you change the orientation of the face that aligns with the print bed, the software recalculates the maximum scale factor.
        
    2.  Change the scale value:
    
    +   Enter a value.
      
        The new value is saved as a document property. When you print the model again, the saved value is used unless you change it.
        
    +   Click Scale to Fit to apply the maximum scale factor.
    +   Click Orient to Fit and Scale to Fit.
      
        The software orients the model and scales it so that you get the largest possible printed model.
        
    
6.  Under Options, specify the options:
  
    +   Job Quality
    +   Infill percentage
    +   Include supports
      
        Supports are added for parts of the model that overhang the print bed.
        
    +   Include raft
      
        Builds the print output on top of a raft of disposable material that you can remove after printing.
        
    
    The printer that you selected determines how these options are applied.
    
7.  Click Printer Properties to view properties specific to the selected printer.
  
    The printer manufacturer provides these properties.
    
8.  Click the Preview tab to run preview analyses to evaluate your current print job settings.
9.  To print the model, click ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/ghy1608673255360.image).

## Reorienting the Model to Fit the Print Volume

If you select Orient to Fit when you specify a model's print bed location, the software automatically reorients the model so that the highest volume of the printed model fits within the print volume.

To reorient the model to fit the print volume:

1.  Click File > Print3D.
2.  In the Print3D PropertyManager, on the Settings tab, expand Print Bed Location.
3.  Select the face to act as the bottom plane of the model.
  
    ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/ssx1450372832410.image)
    
4.  Click Orient to Fit.
  
    The software translates the model parallel to the print bed or rotates the model about its axis normal to the print bed to fit the entire model, at its current scale, within the print volume.
    
    ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/knr1450372833192.image)
    
    If Orient to Fit does not fit the entire model within the print volume, the model geometry outside the print volume is highlighted in red. In this case, you can specify a scale parameter or select both Scale to Fit and Orient to Fit, so the software can fit the model into the print volume.
    
5.  Click ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/ghy1608673255360.image).

## Checking the 3D Printer Size

You can select a 3D printer from a list to determine if a model fits inside the 3D printer. You can mark a 3D printer as a favorite to make the 3D printer available as a selection in the Print3D PropertyManager.

When you add a printer as a favorite, the following read-only information appears:

| Option                      | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Company                     | Printer manufacturer.                                        |
| Model                       | Model number for the printer.                                |
| Bed Size of this 3D Printer | Height, Length, and Width of the printer.                    |
| Technology                  | Printer type. For example, FDM, SLS, or SLA.                 |
| Source URL                  | 3D printer list from the Wohlers Report 2019 provided by Wohlers Associates, Inc. |

To check the 3D printer size:

1.  Open a part or assembly, and click File > Print3D ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/rcb1559227349524.image).
2.  On the Settings tab of the Print3D PropertyManager, click 3D Printer Name ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/rcb1559227349524.image), and click Select Printer.
  
    In the 3D Printers dialog box, a folder list alphabetized by company name appears.
    
3.  Expand a folder to view a list of 3D printers, and select a printer.
4.  Click Add to Favorites.
  
    The printer is added to the Favorites ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/jpc1559228070196.image) folder at the top of the folder list.
    
5.  Close the dialog box.
6.  In the PropertyManager, under 3D Printer Name ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/rcb1559227349524.image), select a printer.
7.  For Bottom plane of model, in the graphics area, select a planar face or reference plane.
  
    The printer appears as a transparent box around the model. Sections of the model that do not fit in the printer area appear in red.
    
    ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/psa1557144302125.image)
    

## Changing the Model Scale

You can specify a scale factor to control the printed size of a model.

To change the model scale:

1.  Click File > Print3D.
2.  In the Print3D PropertyManager, on the Settings tab, select a model face to act as the bottom plane of the model.
  
    Under Scale, the default scale is set to 1, which is the size of the model in the software.
    
3.  Hover over the scale factor input box.
  
    The software calculates the maximum recommended scale factor and informs you of this limit.
    
    If you change the orientation of the face that is aligned with the print bed, the maximum recommended scale factor is recalculated.
    
4.  Set the scale by doing one of the following:
    1.  Type a value for the scale factor.
      
        The new value is saved as a document property. When you print the model again, the saved value is used unless you change it.
        
    2.  Click Scale to Fit to apply the maximum scale factor.
    3.  Click Orient to Fit and Scale to Fit.
      
        The software orients the model and scales it so that you get the largest possible printed model.

## Identifying Faces that Require Supports

The Preview tab of the Print3D PropertyManager lets you run a preview analysis to identify faces that require supports during 3D printing.

Printers have different rules for face angles that require supports. Often, if the angle of a face extends more than 45º relative to the print bed, the face must be supported using support geometry during 3D printing.

To identify faces that require supports:

1.  Click File > Print3D.
2.  On the PropertyManager Preview tab, under Build Analysis, select Show faces that require supports.
3.  Set the angle from vertical to define the support threshold.
  
    This is the angle above which you should add supports to prevent the model from collapsing while it is printing.
    
4.  To define the color of the faces that need or do not need support:
  
    1.  For Support face color, click Edit Color.
      
        Select the color to use and click OK.
        
    2.  For Supports not required, click Edit Color.
      
        Select the color to use and click OK.
        
    
    The colors you select are reflected in the model.

6.  Click ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/ghy1608673255360.image).

## Displaying Striation Lines

To determine whether the print resolution is sufficiently fine to produce the desired output, you can display striation lines on the model.

Striation lines appear only when the Print3D PropertyManager is open.

If you have RealView on, you can view striation lines as a bump map.

To display striation lines:

1.  Click File > Print3D.
2.  On the PropertyManager Settings tab, select a model face to align to the print bed.
3.  On the Preview tab, under Build Analysis, click Show striation lines.
  
    Striation lines appear on the model as a texture.
    
    ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/hof1450372824754.image)
    
    The default layer height is 0.3mm, which corresponds to a coarse printer resolution with a relatively fast printer speed.
    
4.  Optionally, change the layer height in the Set striation size ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/ifi1482517393557.image) field.
5.  To display the striation lines as a bump map:
    1.  Clear Show faces that require supports.
    2.  Select Show as bump map.
      
        ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/fwc1450372826051.image)
        
        Bump maps can reveal where detail will be lost in the printed model.

## Exporting 3D Print Files

You can export part and assembly files to STL (.stl), 3D Manufacturing Format (.3mf), or Additive Manufacturing File Format (.amf) format.

To export a 3D print file:

1.  Click File > Print3D.
2.  In the Print3D PropertyManager, expand Save To File.
3.  For Format, choose one of the following:
    +   STL (\*.stl)
      
        This ASCII or binary format file describes only the surface geometry of a 3D object as a raw, unstructured triangulated surface.
        
    +   3D Manufacturing Format (\*.3mf)
      
        This is an additive manufacturing focused file format that lets you send full-fidelity 3D models to other applications, platforms, services, and printers.
        
    +   Additive Manufacturing File (\*.amf)
      
        This xml-based file lets you select export options that store the color and materials of the object to be 3D printed in the .AMF file, as well as the geometry of the model.
    
4.  Click Save File.
5.  By default, the file is saved to the model location.
  
6.  Click Options.
  
    While many options are the same for the .stl, .3mf, and .amf file formats, they have these differences:

## Slicing Data for 3MF Export

You can generate slices from precise SOLIDWORKS® geometry to export to a 3D Manufacturing Format (.3mf) file without saving the geometry to a mesh file.

Slices represent the highest fidelity of SOLIDWORKS geometry based on the minimum segment length, resulting in slices with the highest accuracy that a 3D printer can print.

To slice data for 3MF export:

1.  Open a part and click File > Print3D ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/rcb1559227349524.image).
2.  On the Settings tab, for Bottom plane of model, select a plane.
3.  On the Preview tab, specify options:
  
    | Option                                                       | Description                      |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
    | ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/ifi1482517393557.image) | Layer height                     |
    |                                                              | Generate slices (for 3MF export) |
    | Available when you specify a bottom plane on the Settings tab. |                                  |
    
     |
    | ![](https://help.solidworks.com/2022/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/fwe1490030202307.image) | Minimum edge length | Specifies the smallest edge included in a polyline for a slice.
    
    This edge corresponds to the smallest linear segment that a 3D printer can print.
    
     |
    |   | Preview Slices | Generates a preview of slices.
    
    Available when you specify a bottom plane on the Settings tab and a layer height on the Preview tab.
    
    To interrupt the preview generation, close the PropertyManager.
    
    If you change the bottom plane, layer height, or minimum edge length, click Preview Slices to regenerate the slices.
    
     |
    
    After you click Preview Slices, the slices appear in yellow on the part.
    
4.  Click the Settings tab.
5.  Expand the Save To File section.
6.  For Format, select 3D Manufacturing Format (\*.3mf) and click Save File.
7.  In the Save As dialog box:
  
    1.  For Save as type, select 3D Manufacturing Format (.3mf).
    2.  Click Options.
    3.  In the System Options - STL/3MF/AMF dialog box, select Include slices to include slicing information in the exported file, and click OK.
    4.  Click Save.
    
    The .3mf file contains slices generated from precise geometry. Use this file with a 3D printer that can read slice information.
