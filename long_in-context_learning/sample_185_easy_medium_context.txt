Common and Newbie Questions
Q: What kind of game is Warframe?


A: Warframe is a 3rd person hack and slash shooter with parkour, with some RPG, MMO and Rogue-Lite elements. But most people
tend to just say space ninjas with magic.
Q: What’s the difference between the Warframe Path and the Paradox Path?
A: When first launching the game, you get a choice between two starting points, the Warframe Path and the Paradox Path, the only
difference is the start, the Warframe Path is more looter shooter focused, and the Paradox Path is more of a rogue-lite system. After
playing for some time the start you pick will not matter.
Q: Which path should I pick?
A: The Warframe path is the traditional start and is focused more on looting and gaining resources, however the Paradox Path is
more focused on rouge-lite mechanics, however picking one path will still allow you to progress in the other one early on.
Q: Is Warframe pay-to-win (P2W)? Am I at a disadvantage if I don’t pay/have Platinum (Plat/premium currency)?
A: No, Warframe is pay-to-skip. Almost everything in the game is obtainable without Plat and the rest can be traded for. There are a
few exceptions to this rule, but they are mainly cosmetics. You can also trade items you’ve found in-game for Plat.
Q: My first 50 Plat is untradeable, what gives?
Q: Why do I have untradable Plat?
A: Any starting Platinum will be untradable. This is to prevent account creation for Plat farming. Most if not all other Plat that you
earn will always be usable for everything, including trading.
It should be noted that any Plat gained from DE directly, i.e. from streams/giveaways/partners, can also not be traded.
Q: What should I use my starting Plat on?
A: Generally, slots, potatoes (orokin reactors/catalysts) then cosmetics in that order. You’ll be able to get more Plat via trading with
others later.
A good choice is the “Complete Starter Slot Bundle” available in the market, it includes 2 Warframe Slots, 2 Weapons Slots and 2
Companion Slots for 45 Platinum!
Q: Are there any forms of dedicated servers?
Q: Any servers in x region?
A: All games played on Warframe with the exception of Relays or Clans (hubs) are hosted peer to peer. If your connection isn’t
good, generally as with any kind of connection based game, you will have a hard time.
Q: Is there a solo mode?
A: Technically, everything in the game can be completed solo. In fact, some do it for a challenge. However, there are some parts of
the game that could necessitate a friend or two, and most missions will definitely be easier with a fellow Tenno at your side.
Q: Is there a campaign mode?
A: Yes. A few quests have a campaign, with story and lore reveals. These are unlocked as you progress through the game.


Q: Is there an offline mode?
A: Playing ‘offline’ is impossible. The game will not start without an internet connection. However, playing pseudo offline is
possible, by playing in solo mode.
Q: Is Warframe cross-platform?
A: Yes! Crossplay is currently Live! Everything from PC to Playstation to Xbox to Nintendo Switch, You can match and play along
with anyone from any platform!
Q: Is Warframe cross-save?
A: The most recent update, 35.0.3 has started an extremely early way of cross-save, within 2023 there should be complete
cross-save!
Q: What Warframe should I pick as my starter?
Q: What’s the best starter Warframe?
A: Warframes are basically your classes, they have different abilities that change the way you play the game. As a rule of thumb,
none of the starter Warframes are “better” or “best”, they cater to your playstyle.
●
Excalibur or Excal is the Warrior, which likes getting in people’s faces, hack n slash.
●
Mag is basically the Mage, using her abilities for nuking, CC (Crowd Control) and utilities.
●
Volt is a Hybrid that features damaging CC and various utilities (speed/shield).
If you can’t choose, go with the one you think looks the coolest.
Q: Can I get the other Warframes if I pick x?
A: Yes, you can get them later in the game.
Q: I just finished the tutorial with Vor, how do I advance through the game?
A: Complete mission nodes (the flashing blue ones), get to junctions and finish their goals. Buy weapon and Warframe blueprints
from the Market for Credits.
Q: I’m lost, what should I do?
A: Tons of stuff! You can play missions on different planets, unlocking nodes. Buy and craft things from the market. Find Quests
from Junctions and play through them. Find mods and fill your mod collection. Search for Ayatan Treasures and collectibles. Join a
clan. Hop on the chats and find others to get lost with you. Play the game and find out!
Q: Why do the mission levels kinda look the same?
A: Warframe’s missions are procedurally-generated. The game has a set number of rooms, called a tileset, that are randomly linked
together every time you start a mission. So the rooms look the same, but the layout is always different.
Q: What is my level?


A: There are 2 kinds, Mastery level and item level. For Mastery, press escape, and click on profile. The number on the first page is
your Mastery Level. For item level, go to the Arsenal or press [ESC] →Arsenal and select an item, the level will be under the item’s
name.
Q: What is Forma?
A: It’s used in crafting a variety of items and can add additional mod polarities to items, while also resetting the item’s level.
Q: What is a polarity?
A: See Polarities
Q: What is taxi-ing?
A: For players that don’t have all the nodes unlocked, a taxi is a player with that node unlocked, and can host a mission on that node
for up to 3 others. Generally, once a person has taxi’d someone over, they will leave so that they may taxi others.
Q: What are Syndicates?
A: See Syndicates
Q: What is a Potato / Orokin Reactor / Orokin Catalyst?
A: They double the amount of mod capacity that your frame (Reactor) or weapon (Catalyst) has. They are nicknamed potatoes due
to their shape.
Q: Until what time can I still invite friends to my missions if I’ve started it?
A: Any time the objective hasn’t been (partially) finished, depending on the mode. For example, Exterminates stop invites around a
third of completion through, while endless missions can be invited to about halfway into the first iteration.
Q: What is this scanner I can click on in my ship?
A: It’s basically a space radio, it doesn’t do much. It’s mostly there for ambient noise, and bits of lore can be found if you listen
closely enough.
Q: Offline segment? What’s that?
A: You haven’t unlocked it as part of your ship. Continue playing, you’ll find them gradually as you progress.
Q: Why is my screen/lights flickering?
A: An Assassin or Syndicate is after you. Try to stick with your allies or warn them so they can help you.
For Assassins, see section Assassins.
For Syndicates, see section Syndicates.
Q: What are these glowing blue hexagons?
Q: What is a Cephalon Fragment?


Q: What is a Somachord Tone?
A: They’re scannable items which provide lore (and music!) when unlocked.
Q: I just got a weapon from a Quest. Should I keep it, or sell it?
A: Keep all items given from Quests due to the fact you will only get them once.

Movement System
One of the primary selling points of Warframe is its unique, fluid movement system. You can make your Warframe do a number of
parkour tricks, which can be chained together into what is called the Movement System.

These are just a few of the possible movement combos in Warframe. Discover them all for yourself!
Damage
Physical Damage
The main type of damage in Warframe is physical damage, split into three different types - Impact, Puncture, and Slash. It is
commonly referred to as IPS damage. Most weapons and some Warframe abilities have at least one of these damage types, with
the weapons usually having all 3. Each damage type has a Status Effect, also known as a Proc. See Status below.
Elemental Damage
The secondary type of damage in Warframe is Elemental damage, which is split into 4 base elements; Heat, Cold, Electric, and
Toxin. These damage types are rarer on weapons, and more common on Warframe abilities. However, these elements can be
added to weapons using mods.


The 4 base elemental types can be combined to create 6 combined Elemental damage types:
●
Heat + Cold = Blast
●
Electric + Toxin = Corrosive
●
Heat + Toxin = Gas
●
Cold + Electric = Magnetic
●
Heat + Electric = Radiation
●
Cold + Toxin = Viral
All 10 Elemental damage types have a Status Effect, or Proc, that they can inflict. See Status Below.
Other Damage
There are two other types of damage usable by the player, True and Void.
True damage is a hidden damage type, and has no damage modifier versus any kind of health, and it ignores armor reduction and
shields. A few examples of true damage are Finisher attacks and Bleed procs.
(SPOILERS) Void damage is only used by Operators, Amps and Xaku. It guarantees stun against drone type Sentients, and resets
Sentient damage reduction(Except Xaku).


Status
Every damage type has a Status Effect, or Proc, that it can inflict. These are damage/effect over time and their effectiveness is based
on the base damage of the damage type, and the Status Chance and Status Duration of the item inflicting damage. No Proc lasts
infinitely. The damage type with the highest amount of damage will always be the most likely to Proc, with lesser damage numbers
losing likeliness as damage lessens. If Status goes over 100% the chance to Proc is guaranteed and any percent over 100 has a
chance to proc another Status effect.
Physical Damage Procs
●
Impact - Stagger - Causes victims to flinch and stagger’s movement, while increasing the threshold for Finishers.
●
Puncture - Weakened - Cause victim’s attacks to deal less damage.
●
Slash - Bleed - Affected victims take damage over time, which is True damage.
Base Elemental Damage Procs
●
Heat - Ignite - Sets enemies ablaze and deals damage over time, while also removing half armor.
●
Cold - Freeze - Reduces victim’s movement speed and fire rate.
●
Electric - Tesla Chain - Sends an electric surge through the victim and to all enemies within a 3m radius of the victim, dealing
damage over time and stunning.
●
Toxin - Poison - Infects the victim and causes damage over time. This damage bypasses shields.
Combined/Special Elemental Damage Procs
●
Blast - Inaccuracy - Reduces the accuracy of the afflicted target..
●
Corrosive - Corrosion - Strips the victim’s armor by 20%, then by another 6% per stack (80% cap) .
●
Gas - Toxic Cloud - Produces a small cloud around the affected victim in a 3m radius that deals Toxin damage. Each
additional stack increases range. Because it is an innate Toxin, it bypasses shields.
●
Magnetic - Disrupt - Enhanced damage. First Magnetic status effect deals 100% additional shield damage, Subsequent
stacks add 25% capped at 325%.
●
Radiation - Confusion - Causes the victim to become confused and randomly attack any enemy or ally within range. This also
causes their allies to attack them.
●
Viral - Virus - Amplifies damage to the health of the afflicted target.
●
Void - Bullet Attractor - creates a small 5 meter field centered on where the target was shot for 3 seconds, Making all bullets
that enter this field go directly to where the Status Effect was Proced

Multishot
Multishot is the chance a weapon will fire an extra projectile for no extra ammo cost. It is widely considered the most powerful
damage buff.
Multishot is rated on a percentage scale.
At 50% Multishot, a weapon will always fire one round for every fire instance, and has a 50% chance of firing 2 rounds.
At 100% Multishot, a weapon will always fire two rounds for every fire instance.
At 150% Multishot, a weapon will always fire two rounds for every fire instance, and has a 50% chance to fire 3 rounds.
At 200% Multishot, a weapon will always fire 3 rounds for every fire instance.
Etc.
Multishot will display an increase in damage stats similar to damage, but this is “fake” damage based on the chance of firing an
extra shot, and is not the actual damage that can occur.


Multishot will show an increase in Status Chance, but this is ‘fake’ Status Chance. If you achieve 100% Status WITH multishot mods,
then that guaranteed Status Proc applies to ONE shot in the multishot volley. For Status to apply to all shots, 100% Status Chance is
needed BEFORE multishot is applied.
Punch Through
Punch Through is a mechanic that can exist in fireable or thrown weapons. It is the maximum depth of material that a projectile can
penetrate. Once a projectile encounters a surface too thick to penetrate, it will stop as normal. It is typically given through mods,
but some weapons have innate Punch Through.
Punch Through is rated by punch distance in meters.
●
0.1m of PT is enough to pierce a Shield Lancer’s riot shield.
●
1.0m of PT is enough to pierce any openable door, any soft cover, and any small enemy unit.
●
1.2m of PT is enough to pierce through any regular enemy unit, or 2 small enemy units.
●
2.1m of PT is enough to pierce through two of any regular enemy unit, or 4 small enemy units.
Punch Through will not work on large or damage-locked bosses, Frost and Arctic Eximus shields, and Nullifier bubbles. It will also
not work on walls that separate mission tiles, only doors.
Melee 3.0
Other than gunplay, Warframe is known for its addictive melee elements. The current way melee works in the game is referred to as
Melee 3.0. Melee 2.0 was phased out of the game in March of 2019. Additional patches are set to change the way melee functions.
Melee 2.0 - 3.0 changes:
●
Increased slam attack speed and range of knockdown effect.
●
Removed quick melee animations and replaced the action with instant melee weapon swap and attack.
●
Aiming or firing will re-equip the last used primary/secondary weapon instantly, and perform the action.
●
Blocking is now automatic when facing an enemy.
There are many melee weapon types available for use, all with their own strengths, weaknesses, and playstyle.

When you have a melee weapon in your loadout, but are wielding your primary or secondary, you can instantly switch to your melee
weapon and attack with [E]. This is good for instant counterattack in close quarters or when out of ammo. Firing or aiming will
re-equip your last weapon.
When your melee weapon is equipped, you can block/parry incoming attacks and bullets by facing the attacking enemy with your
melee weapon out. You are also able to Heavy Attack using [Alternate Attack] button, or if you are mid air and aim down you will do
a Heavy Slam Attack, Both Heavy Attacks deal increased damage depending on the Combo, but consuming all of the current
combo.
Melee Finisher attacks are a stealth based melee attack. All unalerted/disoriented/blind/asleep enemies have the option to have a
finisher attack performed on them. Finishers do extremely high damage when done correctly.
When your melee weapon is equipped, you have access to your Stance Mod. Stance Mods are rare mods that modify the attack
patterns and combos of your melee weapon. They are equipped in your Upgrade menu, in the special slot above the regular 8 mod
slots. Only one Stance Mod may be equipped at a time. Keep in mind Stance Mods only work for the weapon types displayed on
their card. So a Sword Stance will not be equippable on a Rapier, and a Polearm Stance will not be equippable on a Heavy Blade.
Additionally, equipping a Stance Mod will provide extra mod capacity for the weapon, equal to the amount of drain on the card.


Consecutive melee attacks will build your Melee Combo Counter. The more hits landed in a short period of time, the higher the
Heavy damage multiplier becomes. Not hitting an enemy for a short period will reset the counter. Mods can be applied that extend
the time before the counter resets, such as Body Count and Drifting Contact.
Affinity
Q: What is Affinity?
A: Affinity is essentially XP. It is not Mastery, however it leads to Mastery.
Q: How do I get Affinity?
A: When you kill something, complete a mission objective, or complete a challenge, you will gain Affinity for your equipment. The
white bold number with a plus next to it that appears after killing an enemy or completing a challenge/objective is the amount of
Affinity earned from that action.
Q: This guy has all the kills, am I not gonna get XP?
A: Don’t be sad/angry when someone “killsteals”, any Affinity they gain will also be passed to you as long as you’re within 50m of
them.
Q: How much Affinity is needed to max something?
A: You need 900k affinity to max a Warframe and 450k to max a weapon (from unranked to 30).
If an item is maxed with Affinity, it will still gain the Affinity it is due in missions, but will not go up any more in level.
Q: Does everything get Affinity at the same rate?
A: How Affinity is spread:
●
Kill with ability - All Affinity on kill goes to the Warframe.
●
Kill with a weapon - Half to Warframe and half to weapon.
●
Completing a Challenge - Affinity split across all your gear.
●
Kills by allied Tenno - All the Affinity is split consistently across all your gear (Warframe/weapons). 25% to Warframe and
75% split across remaining weapons. Companions do not detract Affinity from this, although they will get their own Affinity
split half across the weapon and the companion.
●
Kills by companion (Ability) - All Affinity goes to companion, the owner gets no Affinity.
●
Kills by companion (Weapon) - Split evenly between companion weapon and companion itself, the owner gets no Affinity.
Mastery
Mastery is not Affinity, Affinity is XP for items. Mastery is a total of what you’ve leveled.
Q: How do I get Mastery?


A: Mastery is gained through leveling anything. This means weapons, Warframes, vehicles, companions, etc. A small amount of
Mastery is also awarded upon completing a Star Chart node for the first time.
Q: How much Mastery is earned for leveling up items?
A: Each maxed Warframe, companion, or Archwing gives 6k to your mastery, or 200 per level. All weapons and K-Drives give 3k, or
100 per level.
Q: How much Mastery is needed to level up?
A: Each mastery rank takes 2500 to max, with every additional rank adding 5000. So, Rank 1 takes 2500, Rank 2 takes 7500, Rank 3
takes 12500, and so on. Legendary Rank 1 and above require the same amount of mastery as 29 to 30
Q: It says my Mastery requirement is maxed, what do I do now?
A: Once you max out all the Mastery for your current MR level, you can rank up by completing an MR Test (see below).
Q: I’ve maxed out the Mastery requirement for my current MR, but I kept leveling items after I capped. Did I lose that MR?
A: Mastery DOES carry over to the next rank, even if you haven't completed the test yet. Once the test is finished, all carryover MR
earned from the previous rank will be instantly added to your current rank.
Q: I forma’d this weapon, and it got reset to level 0. Will I get Mastery from it again?
Forma’d equipment DOES NOT add to Mastery, despite what anyone says. Only the first time leveling an item will count towards
Mastery.
Q: I have two weapons that have the same name, do they both get Mastery?
Other variants of items give mastery, i.e. Braton gives 3k, Braton Prime will give 3k, and Mk1 Braton will give 3k for a total of 9k. But
once you level up an item, i.e. Lato, leveling up another Lato will not give Mastery.
Q: I sold a weapon before it was max level, did I lose any remaining Mastery for it?
A: The game records how much you’ve leveled a weapon no matter if it is in your inventory or not. If you leveled a weapon to level
10 and sold it, the game records that you earned 1,000 Mastery from that weapon. If you attain the weapon again, the game will not
reward Mastery until the weapon reaches level 11 and so on.
Q: Why should I care about Mastery?
A: Benefits of Mastery:
●
Gives your weapons and Warframes a flat starting bonus mod capacity of your MR.
○
A MR5 person has equipment that starts at 5/5 capacity.
○
A MR23 person has equipment that starts at 23/23 capacity.
○
This can be affected by a potato, doubling it.
○
This does not mean you go over the limit, 30 or 60 will still be the mod cap, not accounting for auras or stances.
●
Changes your max limit of Void Traces.


●
Allows you access to certain Relays.
●
Allows access to certain equipment/quests.
●
Allows you to use certain levels of Riven Mods.
●
Increases your Daily Syndicate Standing capacity.
●
More trades a day (starting at MR2). Your Mastery rank +1 equals the number of trades you can do.
●
Gives you “loadout” slots every other rank which allows easy equipment switching.
●
Changes your Mastery Sigil to a different emblem every 3 ranks, and a different color every rank.
Mastery Rank Tests
Once you max out all the MR for your current level (can be seen in profile), you will qualify for your next Mastery Rank Test. Each
test is different from the last, but are not different between players. Every player must pass the same challenge. Keep in mind, MR
tests are solo only, and there is a 24 hour limit set on MR tests. So if you fail a test, you cannot reattempt until 24 hours have
passed. In addition, you cannot gain more than one Mastery Rank per 24 hours. The player's next Mastery Rank test will also be
available for practice and, if eligible, for rank up in Cephalon Simaris' Relay room. All previous levels of Mastery Tests may be
practiced at any time.

to pass the test.
It is recommended that you fully understand hacking before attempting this test.
Mastery Rank 6 Test
Target Tracking Test
This test requires players to track targets quickly and accurately.
The player starts the test standing on a brightly lit circular platform in a dark room encircled with metallic spheres. The player's
camera will be turned toward the first target at the beginning of each round. Upon shooting the first target, lines will connect unlit
spheres in succession before stopping at another target, this process will repeat itself until the test has ended.
It is recommended to bring an accurate and/or high fire rate hitscan weapon to this test.
Mastery Rank 7 Test
Timed Exterminate Test

The player starts in the center of a white room with pillars circling the center. Level 15-18 Grineer, Corpus, and Infested units will
spawn in waves and must be dispatched before time ends.
It is recommended to bring a defensive or nuke Warframe to this test.
Mastery Rank 8 Test
Movement Test
This test requires players to jump across several platforms, with a varying distance between each one. Shooting the red orbs that
appear spawns the next platform. Players have three tries to complete the test; any fall from the platforms counts as a try.


It is recommended to fully understand the movement system of Warframe before attempting this test.
Mastery Rank 9 Test
Stealth Test
This test requires players to make use of cover and track enemy movements in order to assassinate targets without detection using
melee weapons only.
Players start in a room equipped with only their melee weapon. They make their way through three stages with increasing numbers
of enemies and increasingly complex patrol routes. Successful elimination of all enemies in a stage will unlock the next. All enemies
are level 1 and can be insta-killed by a takedown.
Players are allowed three tries. Alerting an enemy counts as a try and will reset the stage. Falling off a platform does not count as a
try. Also, there is no time limit.
It is recommended to bring a fast Warframe to this test, and to study the enemy movements closely. Keep in mind there is no time
limit.
Mastery Rank 10 Test
Disappearing Platform Test
This test requires players to eliminate targets at range, while maneuvering on platforms in a 3x3 grid that will permanently
disappear after a few seconds of standing on them.
The player will spawn in on a normal platform and the test will begin once you enter the grid area. You must kill all enemies
spawning periodically atop five elevated platforms which line the far end of the grid. Once the player steps on a platform it will
begin flashing increasing in speed until it disappears 8 seconds later. All enemies are level 1.
Players have three chances to complete the test. Falling from the tileset counts as a try.
It is recommended to bring a high fire rate hitscan or high range beam weapon to this test.
Mastery Rank 11 Test
Time Trial Test
This test requires players to make their way through an obstacle course while shooting red orbs to increase the amount of time they
have to finish the course. Each orb adds 3.5 seconds of time.
It is recommended to use a fast Warframe for this test.
Mastery Rank 12 Test
Carousel Test
This test requires players to eliminate enemies while being aware of their surroundings.
Players start on a platform facing a carousel-like structure with two disks connected with a large pillar at their centers. Between the
disks are a set of lasers which separate the quadrants of the disks and slowly rotate around the disks, essentially circling the
"carousel".


The object of the test is to reach the carousel, eliminate 16 enemies spawning on the outer disk, all while avoiding the moving lasers.
All enemies are level 1.
It is recommended to bring a high fire rate hitscan or high range beam weapon to this test.
Mastery Rank 13 Test
Advanced Disappearing Platform Test
This test requires players to eliminate enemies while remaining extremely mobile.
Players start facing a number of platforms surrounded by walls which can be run across. Once the player touches a platform, it
begins to flash increasingly rapidly and will disappear after a few seconds. The platforms are arranged with one in each corner, and
three stacked vertically in the center.
Players have three tries to eliminate all enemies on surrounding platforms. Each fall counts as a try and returns all previously
exhausted platforms. All enemies are level 1.
It is recommended to bring a high fire rate hitscan or high range beam weapon to this test. A nuke Warframe can also be used to
make this test trivial.
Mastery Rank 14 Test
Advanced Exterminate Test
This test requires players to eliminate three waves of enemies of levels 15-20.
The player starts on the first level of a tower with multiple cover points and must eliminate targets until they are warped to the next
level. There are three waves with Grineer, Infested, and Corpus units respectively.
It is recommended to bring a nuke Warframe to this test, and/or a high damage beam or hitscan weapon.
Mastery Rank 15 Test
Interception Test

enemies respectively.
It is recommended to bring a defensive or nuke Warframe to this test.
Mastery Rank 17 Test


Advanced Timed Exterminate Test
This test requires the player to kill 30 level 25-28 Infested targets within a time limit. The player starts at 20 seconds. Meleeing the
white orbs that appear on the map grants an additional 7 seconds each.
It is recommended to bring a fast or nuke Warframe to this test, and/or a high damage beam or hitscan weapon.
Mastery Rank 18 Test
Advanced Defense Test
This test requires the player to defend a Cryopod for 5 waves. Enemies are Corpus, levels 25-28.
It is recommended to bring a defensive or nuke Warframe to this test.
Mastery Rank 19 Test
Stealth Rescue Test
This test requires the player to destroy six security orbs around a large tileset, and then escort a rescue target to the extraction
point, all without being detected by the patrolling Grineer Lancers. All Lancers are level 15.
It is recommended to bring a fast Warframe to this test.
Mastery Rank 20 Test
Archwing Time Trial Test
This test requires the player to fly between two platforms in Archwing mode before the timer runs out. There is a series of rings
between the two platforms that grant additional time of 2 seconds when flown through. The player starts out with 10 seconds.
It is recommended that you understand Archwing mechanics and flight patterns before attempting this test.
Mastery Rank 21 Test
Timed Exterminate Test
This test requires the player to kill 35 level 25-28 Grineer enemies before the timer runs out. The player must destroy white orbs
with their melee weapon to extend the timer, which spawn in random locations around the map.
It is recommended to bring a fast or nuke Warframe to this test, and/or a high damage beam or hitscan weapon.
Mastery Rank 22 Test
Arena Test
This test consists of three rounds requiring the player to kill 12/18/24 level 40 Executioners. The player is given 3 respawns before
the mission will fail. Executioners will spawn in pairs, a maximum of 6 simultaneously. The first round has a speed boost modifier,
the second round has a health drain modifier (drains 100 health periodically until you have 3 health, killing enemies restores all
health) and the third round has a scaling enemies modifier. Falling out of the map uses one respawn.


It is recommended to bring high survivability Warframes and high burst damage weapons to this test.
Mastery Rank 23 Test
Mobile Point Capture Test
This test requires the player to capture 6 mobile control points before the timer runs out by standing within a radius as they move
along set paths. Various types of level 40-45 Grineer enemies, including Manics, will spawn throughout the map, attacking the
player as they capture the points. Capture progress will quickly decay while the player is outside of the white radius. Each point will
gradually turn green and then stop moving upon reaching 100%.
It is recommended to use Rhino with an Iron Skin and speed build, or Limbo with a speed build, so as to ignore the enemies and
concentrate on the points.
Mastery Rank 24 Test (SPOILERS)
Operator Test
This test requires the player to use their Operator to destroy an orb in the center of a small arena, while being attacked by level 15
Infested Brood Mothers and maggots. The player is given 3 respawns before the mission will fail.
It is recommended to periodically kill the Brood Mothers, and Void Blast any maggots on or around your Operator.
Mastery Rank 25 Test
Deployable Archwing Exterminate Test
This test requires the player to use an Archwing deployed by the Archwing Launcher to traverse a multitude of floating platforms,
killing 50 level 25-28 Grineer enemies, both grounded and airborne, before the timer runs out. The player can extend the remaining
time by melee attacking the white orbs that spawn on these platforms.
It is recommended to use long distance or AOE weapons to kill enemies from a distance or quickly, as the map is quite large.
Mastery Rank 26 Test
Advanced Mobile Point Capture Test
This test requires the player to capture 6 mobile control points within 5 minutes by standing within a radius as they move along set
paths, while under constant fire from level 40-45 Grineer. Unlike the MR23 test, the capture points in this test move up and down as
well as horizontally, and change speed much more rapidly. Capture progress will quickly decay while the player is outside of the
white radius. The point will gradually turn green and then stop moving upon reaching 100%.
It is recommended to use Rhino with an Iron Skin and speed build, or Limbo with a speed build, so as to ignore the enemies and
concentrate on the points.
Mastery Rank 27 Test


Point Collection Test
This test requires the player to collect 100 points from the map and enemies, and turn them into a pad on one side of the map. The
player has 5 minutes to accomplish this. Blue orbs will occasionally spawn on the map and are worth 1 point each. Red orbs will
drop from red enemies and will spawn rarely, and are worth 3 points each. The more points that are collected, the higher the
enemies’ levels will be. Using Vacuum or Fetch will make collecting points easier.
It is recommended to use Rhino with Iron Skin, or a nuke frame, so as to either ignore the blue enemies and prioritize the red
enemies, or to kill all enemies and only focus on collecting points.
Mastery Rank 28 Test
Condensed Thermia Extermination Test
This test requires the player to eliminate 60 enemies. The enemies are invulnerable, requiring the player to pick up containers of
Condensed Thermia that spawn every 30 seconds. These canisters must be thrown at enemies to make them vulnerable. The
containers destabilize 15 seconds after spawning in. A maximum of 7 canisters will spawn; if 60 enemies are not killed after the last
canister, the test will fail. No other timer is active for this test. This test uses game mechanics first seen in the Exploiter Orb fight but
adapted for extermination.
It is recommended to throw the canisters into clusters of enemies to maximize their effectiveness.
Mastery Rank 29 Test
Advanced Timed Extermination Test.
This test requires the player to eliminate 100 enemies, with enemy levels starting at 50 and ending at 110. The player is given a
14-second countdown timer to kill waves of enemies, each enemy kill resets the timer by 2 seconds. Every 10 enemies killed the test
conditions get harder:
●
10 enemies: enemy level +10
●
20 enemies: enemy level +20
●
30 enemies: enemy health +50%
●
40 enemies: enemy level +30
●
50 enemies: max timer -3s
●
60 enemies: enemy level +40
●
70 enemies: enemy armor +50%
●
80 enemies: enemy level +50
●
90 enemies: enemy level +60
Mesa, combined with some Energy Restores, can make this test trivial.


Mastery Rank 30 Test
Advanced Survival Test
This test requires the player to kill in each of 5 stages a number of level 60-100 enemies from all different factions, then a level
90-130 Arbitration Drone together with 1-9 level 100-140 Eximus “bosses”, and finally interact with the Life Support Capsule all while
under Survival-Style conditions (albeit with a much accelerated depletion timer and an instant failure upon depletion). After killing

Legendary Rank 1 Test
Legendary Exterminate Test (Primary)
This test requires players to exterminate three waves of level 80-85 Terra Corpus with their primary weapon. All Warframe abilities
and the Operator are disabled.
The player starts in the center of a room encircled by eight pillars. From here they must eliminate 15, 30 and 45 enemies within 1:00,
1:30 and 2:00 for each wave respectively.


Legendary Rank 2 Test
Legendary Exterminate Test (Secondary)
This test requires players to exterminate three waves of level 80-85 Tusk Grineer with their secondary weapon. All Warframe
abilities and the Operator are disabled.
The player starts in the center of a room encircled by eight pillars. From here they must eliminate 10, 20 and 30 enemies within 1:00,
1:30 and 2:00 for each wave respectively.
Shields, Health, and Energy
Shields
Shields protect your health and keep regenerating when you’re not taking damage. Shields will always start regenerating after 3
seconds of not taking damage. This is your primary defense in most situations.
Q: Why is my shield bar suddenly purple?
A: Those are overshields, usually granted to you by Sentinel or Warframe abilities and mods. They essentially raise your maximum
shield capacity.
Q: Do my shields benefit from Armor?
A: No, only health benefits from armor.
Q: I’m losing health and my shields are still max, what gives?
A: It means your Warframe is being affected by a Status proc. This will happen when you step in the green clouds of the infested,
you will get hit by toxin damage. Toxin damage will go directly to health in damage, ignoring shields.
Health
Health is your hitpoints in the game and your secondary form of defense just after your shields. Any attacks that break your shields
will bleed into your health pool. If your health goes down to 0 you are downed, and need to be revived by allies or manually. Keep
in mind you only have 4 manual revives per mission, after which you fail or are dead permanently for the remainder of the mission.
Team revives do not count as one of the 4 revives. If all members of a squad are downed or are down simultaneously, they all will
need to manually revive. Armor applies to health, and the higher your armor is the more damage reduction you can get.
Q: Does my health regenerate?
A: No, but some Sentinel or Warframe abilities, equippable items, or mods like Rejuvenation (Aura), Lifestrike, etc. will allow you to
heal.
Q: Why is my health bar suddenly gray?


A: You are invulnerable while it’s gray, but I’d suggest getting out of danger if you can before the invulnerability runs out.
Invulnerability occurs with some Warframe abilities, after being revived, and in other special cases.
Overguard
Overguard is displayed by a light green number above your shields and health, denoted by an X symbol as well. Overguard has the
same mechanics as health, in addition it grants knockdown immunity. All damage reduction methods effect Overguard like Armor,
Adaption and such.
Q: How can I get Overguard on my Warframe?
A: Only a few abilities currently grant Overguard, Currently these are Rhino’s Iron Skin, Atlas’ Rumbled Augment Mod, Frost’s Icy
Avalanche Augment Mod and Kullervo’s Recompense.
Q: Do enemies have Overguard?
A: Yes, however only Eximus enemies have Overguard, Eximus enemies are normal enemies but have additional health, ability
immunity and special telegraphed attacks.
Armor
Armor is what it sounds like. This stat reduces the damage taken to Health, but not shields. Both enemies and Players can possess
armor.
Q: What does armor look like?
A: Enemies that have armor are given a yellow health bar. Armor cannot be physically seen on your Warframe.
Q: Can I reduce or remove an enemy’s armor?
A: You can strip away or negate an armor value by using certain abilities or damage procs, thus turning an enemy’s health bar red.
The most common is inflicting a corrosive proc, which reduces enemy armor by 26% for 8 seconds and each proc after the first
reduces 6% more armor up to a max of 80% at 10 stacks.
Q: Why should I care about armor when I can just max out Health or Shields?
A: Unlike Health or Shields, armor has a scaling return, which means it passively gets better as missions get harder. It follows a
basic formula and scales better the later or longer missions last.
Q: What does the basic Damage Reduction Formula look like?
A: The damage reduction from armor is as follows:
Damage Reduction=Net Armor/(Net Armor +300)
A net armor value of 300 will reduce incoming damage by 300 ÷ 600 = 50%, so only half of the weapon's damage is inflicted in


total. At 600, you receive only 33% (reduction is 600 ÷ 900 = 66.7%) of a weapon's outgoing damage. At 900 armor, inflicted
damage is only 25% (reduction 900 ÷ 1200 = 75%), and so on.
Energy
Energy is essentially mana. It’s the resource needed to use your abilities in the game. Without it, you cannot use your abilities.
Q: Where do I get more energy in-game?
A: Energy orbs drop from enemies, boxes, crates and in the lockers that you open. Like health, some Sentinel or Warframe abilities,
equippable items, or mods like Energy Siphon (Aura), Energy Conversion, etc. will allow you to gain more energy.
Q: Will I be able to make my own energy later?
A: Yes, via craftable energy pads, passive abilities, and some Warframe abilities.
Powers and Abilities
Powers are the 4 abilities that each frame gets (a few can have additional hidden abilities). They define the frame and shape their
individual playstyles. Some will be more suited to support, while others will be suited to taking heavy gunfire, or stunning entire
areas. Either way, learning about abilities is one the most important parts of the game.
Warframe abilities are similar to that of other games, where one ability is like ‘an Ultimate’, or Ult, and is more powerful than the
rest. A Warframe’s Ult is almost always their 4th ability.
Q: Are all powers different?
A: For different Warframes yes, but for the different types of the same Warframes they’re the same. That all changes when Augment
mods are involved.
Q: Why does another Player’s Ability/Power function differently from mine?
A: The Warframe’s build, and Augment mods. Some abilities have Augments which change the way they work.
For a more in-depth analysis, see Warframe Abilities.


Critical Hits (Crits)
Q: What is a Critical Hit?
A: A Critical Hit is when an attack engages the Critical Multiplier of a weapon, dealing an increased amount of damage based on the
multiplier. It appears as a different colored damage number.
Q: What happens when my crit goes above 100%?
A: Depending on how high your crit chance is, it will first go to level 1, yellow, then level 2, orange, then level 3, red. Yellow crits
occur anywhere from 1% to 199% crit chance. Orange crits occur between 101% and 299% crit chance, and red crits occur after 200%
crit chance. The first level of crit will engage your crit multiplier, each new level of crit will continually increase your crit multiplier.
There are higher levels of crit, however red is the final color of the crit. Every tier of red crit after the first will have a ! mark next to
the damage to show how many tiers above the base red crit you are, up to 3.
Q: How does the crit formula work?
A: Crit Multiplier = Crit Level x (Base Crit Multiplier - 1) + 1
Crits are graded to the percentage of the crit chance. At <100%, you have the given chance to crit at level 1. At 100%+ you always crit
at level one and have a chance to get a level 2 crit.
So if you have 150% crit chance & 3x crit damage, you get a 100% chance for a lvl 1 crit, and 50% for a lvl 2. Plug in the numbers and
let the crit work out.
Level 2: 2 x (3-1) + 1 = 5x Crit multiplier
Level 1:
1 x (3-1) + 1 = 3x Crit Multiplier
Q: What is a purple crit?


A: When damage numbers are purple, it is not displaying a crit level. Rather, purple damage hits are shown when your weapon does
damage to an enemy’s overshields.
Polarities
Polarities are found on mods and the Arsenal upgrade menu. When a mod is applied to a mod slot without a polarity, the drain on
the card will cost exactly that. When a mod and a mod slot have the same polarity, the mod’s drain is halved. When a mod is
applied to a slot with a different polarity, the drain is increased by 25% (there are some exceptions to this system).
There are 3 main polarities. They are known as the:
(V polarity) aka Madurai
(Dash polarity) aka Naramon
(d polarity) aka Vazarin
There are 4 alternate polarities. They are known as the:
(Scratch polarity) aka Zenurik
(r polarity) aka Unairu
(Y polarity) aka Penjaga
(U polarity) aka Umbra
(O polarity) aka Aura
Matching the polarity will reduce drain by 50%, rounded up.
ex. 11V →V Polarity = 5.5 = 6 Mod drain
Not matching the polarity will increase drain by 25%, rounded up.
ex. 10d →- Polarity = 12.5 = 13 Mod drain
Some mod slots have an opposite, positive effect. These occur on Warframe Aura slots and Melee Stance slots.
When applying an Aura/Stance mod to a Warframe/melee weapon, the drain of the mod is ADDED to the Warframe/melee
weapon’s total mod drain. The additional drain is doubled when used with a matching polarity, while 25% added drain is lost when
using the wrong polarity.


Crafting and the Foundry
Crafting blueprints is the backbone of Warframe. All crafting and resource management is done in the Foundry.
Q: How long do things take to build?
A: Blueprint crafting time ranges anywhere from 10 seconds to 3 days. Building any Warframe takes 3 days. Building any weapon
takes either 12 or 24 hours. Keys and other rare gear items and resources typically take 8-12 hours to build. Smaller gear items,
consumables, and general resource blueprints usually take one minute to one hour to complete.
Q: Do things craft only when I’m in the game?
A: No, the crafting timers are real world, and are tracked by the game engine. This means that if you start a blueprint that takes 24
hours at 12:00 PM on a Tuesday, then it will finish crafting at 12:00 PM on Wednesday.
Q: Should I rush “x”?
A: Generally no, but that’s personal preference. If you have Platinum to spare, and really want the item, go ahead. But generally, the
Platinum used to rush something can be used to buy other more helpful or important things.
Q: Is there any way to queue crafting?
A: No. You can craft as many things as you’d like at one time, but you cannot craft more than one of the same item at a time. For
example, if you’re building Rhino, then you can also build Nova, but you cannot build another Rhino.
Q: I farmed Argon Crystals and they’re suddenly missing. What happened?
A: Argon Crystals naturally decay. Your total amount halves every day until you have none left. So if you have 12 on the first day, on
the second you’ll have 6, then 3 then 2 then 1 then none. This is the only resource that decays.
Q: If I cancel something that’s crafting, will I get everything back?
A: Yes, you will get all resources and credits back, but if you go and try to build it again, it will once again take the full amount of
time.
The Codex
The Codex is your journal to Warframe. It includes your Quest List, along with all your discovered weapons, Warframes,
companions, mods, and relics. It also includes short tutorials on in-game mechanics and missions.
By using a Codex Scanner, or other scanning tools such as the Helios sentinel, you can scan items and enemies in missions to have
them added to your codex. Each item takes a set amount of scans before their information is viewable, from 1-24. Scanning enemies
will reveal lore, their weaknesses, attacks, locations, and potential drops.


Scanning Cephalon Fragments will unlock lore which is viewable in the Codex.
Nightwave
Nightwave is the new alert system introduced with update 24.3.0. It features a new NPC, Nora Night, who is a radio show host that
can be accessed using your Orbiter’s scanner.
Nightwave is introduced in Series. The current Nightwave series is - Nora's Mix Volume 2. This mini-series lacks an involved story,
serving as an interim gap between Nora's Mix Volume 1 and Series 4 for rank rewards. Each Series lasts approximately 10-11 weeks,
with each Series having a different story and rewards.
For each Series, you must complete Daily and Weekly challenges, known as Acts. These Acts are given by Nora Night to earn
Nightwave standing. Every 10,000 standing gives a different reward. Daily challenges give 1,000 standing each, while Weekly
challenges give 4,500 standing. Elite Weekly challenges are more difficult missions that award 7,000 standing each. Daily missions
reset at 00:00 GMT every day, while weekly missions reset at 00:00 GMT on Sundays.
Any Weekly and Elite Weekly Acts that have not been completed before the next week's rotation will be put on reserve. Once the
player has fewer than 3 current weekly Acts left to complete, any missed Acts from previous weeks will be available and marked as
Recovered, three at a time. Once all missed Acts have been completed, they will no longer appear, and any further Acts can be
recovered in the future week rotations.
Like Riven challenges, some Nightwave challenges can be obtained across several missions, with mission success not being
required, unless the challenge says it must be done in one instance.

Daily Reward
The Daily Reward is a tribute system in Warframe, awarding players every 24 hours when they log in. The Daily Reward resets at
00:00 GMT.
Q: If I skip a day, will the daily reward reset?
A: Nope, it’s cumulative. This means that if you play every other day for 10 days, you’ll get 5 Daily Rewards.
Q: What do I get out of it?
A: Usually a small amount of a random resource. Before 50 days, a weapon/Warframe blueprint will occasionally be awarded.
Rarely you can receive a short random booster, with length determined by the amount of days played. Even more rarely you can
receive a one-use Platinum discount coupon, lasting 48 hours, and ranging from 20%-75% off Market priced Platinum. Every 50
days there’s a milestone that will reward you with a cache (usually a potato + sigil), a special weapon, or a unique Primed mod.
These caches, weapons or mods do not change from person to person and cannot be traded, so those items cannot be account
farmed.

Terminals and Hacking
Throughout Warframe, you will need to utilize your reflexes and problem-solving abilities to hack through terminals. Hacking is
required to open locked doors, deactivate alarms, release a hostage, retrieve items from consoles, retrieve data from vaults, and
more. When hacking, there is a set time limit. If the hack is not completed successfully, you will be kicked out of the hack menu and
will have to try again from the start.
There are 3 types of console puzzles - Grineer, Corpus and Narmer(Spoilers).
Grinner
Grineer consoles appear as a circle with 3-8 slots stretching from the center to the outside. A cursor rotates the outside of the circle
at a constant rate. You must press the [SPACE BAR] when the cursor is over one of the slots to activate it. The slot will then light up
yellow and move into the center slightly. Once all slots have been activated, the terminal is successfully hacked. Activating a slot
again after it has already been activated will move it back out to the edge, and you will have to hit it again.
On advanced Grineer Consoles, the cursor will be faster and will change direction after each successful slot activation.


Corpus
Corpus consoles appear as a series of 2-7 hexagonal pieces, each with a series of lines originating from the center. You must match
the lines to each other by rotating the hexagons, so that all the lines are connected. [LEFT MOUSE CLICK] will rotate the hexagons
clockwise, while [RIGHT MOUSE CLICK] will rotate them counter-clockwise. Once all lines are connected, the hack is successful.
Narmer
Pic WIP (Message Aer#3702 on Discord if you have a high definition image of the narmer console :) TY)
Narmer's consoles only appear in The New War, Archon Hunts, and Break Narmer and are solved by selecting dots across a split
screen with an inverted-movement cursor.
Ciphers are buildable gear items that, when equipped in your gear wheel, can be used when activating a console to instantly
complete the hack. Ciphers cannot be used with Narmer Consoles, Sortie Missions and some event missions. Ciphers can be
instantly used by pressing [Y] while in a hack screen.


Helminth
Cyst
The Helminth Cyst is a growth that can appear on any Warframe. It appears as a small pink boil, and takes 7 real days to mature.
You can tell when it is mature when a pink tendril emerges from the center of the growth. Once mature, the Cyst can be removed in
your Infested room by the Helminth.
The Cyst is gained from coming into contact (playing a game) with another Warframe who has the Cyst. Once removed, however,
that Warframe can never gain the Cyst again.
Draining the Cyst while breeding a Kubrow will turn it into a Helminth Charger, a unique strain.
Having the Cyst does not affect anything in your loadout, as it is just cosmetic. Many consider removing it necessary, as it does not
match with many color schemes or skins.
Subsume
The Helminth also has the option of “subsuming” an ability from one warframe onto another, with a few restrictions however.
To unlock the subsume option, players are required to purchase the blueprint and build the “Helminth Segment” From Son in the
Necralisk for 15,000 Standing, Requiring Mastery Rank 8 and Rank 3 with the Entrati. You may also purchase a pre-built version
from the market for 300 platinum.
After the segment is built and installed, you may enter the Helminth room at any time (Not requiring a cyst to enter anymore), You
may also sit in the chair at any time, allowing to swap an ability from another frame, However to choose an ability from another
Warframe you need to subsume that specific Warframe, Equip the Warframe you want to subsume and walk into the room, sit in the


chair and select the “Subsume Warframe” option, Showing what ability will be gained and a warning: Your Warframe will be
consumed in the process. You will lose the warframe you subsume but gain the option to swap the ability to another frame, There
are limitations on this
●
You can not change which ability is subsumed. For example, when you subsume Wisp, It will show her 3rd ability, Breach
Surge, or for Loki, it will show his 1st ability, Decoy, which are not changeable and are chosen by the developers.
●
You can not subsume Prime Warframes or Umbra Warframes, Such as Loki Prime or Excalibur Umbra.
●
It will take 23 hours for the Warframe to be subsumed and their ability will be available for use on other frames. Only one
frame can be subsumed at once.
After subsume a warframe, you may now take any frame you own and walk into the Helminth room and sit in the chair, The UI will
show you every ability you can have unlocked and can swap, To do this however costs a resource called “Secretions”, There 7 Types
of secretions and you have fill each one with the “Feed Helminth” button, Each type requires different resources, For Example, Bile,
Costs resources such as Cryotic, Argon Crystals, Morphics, Thermal Sludge and more.
Feeding the Helminth these resources will increase the type they are in, when the required percent is met you are able to subsume a
new ability onto your current frame. There are also some restrictions on this.
●
You can only subsume an ability over another one, Your warframe will always have 4 abilities, this does not add 1, just
replaces one
●
Only one damage boosting ability can be used on a frame at a time, For example, Trying to subsume Rhino’s Roar onto
Chroma, I can only replace his Vex Armor.
●
You may only subsume one ability at a time, you can not subsume 2 abilities onto 1 frame, it was a limit of 1 ability per frame
per loadout slot.
Invigorations
Invigorations are a way to buff your Warframes, 3 Warframes are randomly selected(even ones you don’t own) with one offense
buff and one utility buff, these buffs last 7 days after invigorating your Warframe.
To obtain the Invigoration segment, it requires you be Mastery rank 8 and Rank 5 - Family with the Entrati and it can be purchased
from the Son on Necralisk, or you can be purchased from the market for 300 platinum from the “Helminth Segments Bundle”.
Invigorations will cost 20-90% of 2 random secretion categories.
After every Invigoration, a counter near the bottom of the screen counts up, when you reach 10 Invigorations you are able to change
one of the randomly chosen Warframes to the current one equipped, allowing you to have some control of who gets Invigorations.
The buffs you can obtained from Invigorations are as follows


Offense
Utility
Ability Duration +100%
Armor +1000
Ability Range +100%
Energy Max +200%
Ability Strength +200%
Energy Regen +2
Primary Crit Chance +200%
Health +1000
Primary Damage +250%
Health Regen +25/s
Secondary Crit Chance +200%
Jump Resets +5
Melee Crit Chance +200%
Sprint Speed +75%
Melee Damage +250%
Parkour Velocity +75%
Ability Efficiency +75%
Reload Speed +75%
Status Immunity
Just a little note, each Warframe has a different “weighting” to be selected per week, which means some Warframes will appear
more often than others, these are based on how much each frame is played by the community. The list is as follows
2.00
Atlas • Banshee • Garuda • Grendel • Harrow • Hydroid • Nyx
1.00
Ash • Baruuk • Chroma • Ember • Equinox • Excalibur • Frost • Hildryn • Inaros • Ivara • Lavos • Limbo • Loki •
Mag • Mirage • Nekros • Nezha • Nidus • Nova • Oberon • Octavia • Protea • Revenant • Rhino • Sevagoth •

0.75
Gauss
0.50
Khora • Mesa • Saryn • Volt • Wisp • Wukong
Archon Shards
Archon Shards can be obtained from Archon Hunts(Section WIP)


Incarnon
Incarnons are a type of weapon that require the player to get headshots to fill a bar just below the crosshair, pressing the alternate
fire button to “activate” Incarnon mode, within Incarnon mode the way the weapons fires changes drastically, using an ammo pool
that can not be refilled using ammo pickups. Each weapon also has a few upgrade “slots” that allow you to change how the weapon
handles.
There are 2 types of Incarnon Weapons, Zariman and Incarnon Genesis.
Zariman - Blueprints for these weapons can be obtained from Cavalero in The Crysalith, requiring standing from The Holdfasts
syndicate, the blueprints can be traded between players.
Incarnon Genesis - Instead of blueprints for weapons, these weapons require Adapters obtained from the Steel Path version of The
Circuit, these adapters require the base weapon to be installed on, such as the Braton Genesis Adapter requiring a Braton, Braton
Prime or Braton Vandal, installing these adapters can be accomplished at Cavalero for a cost of Duviri resources.
Evolutions - Every Incarnon weapon, Zariman and Incarnon Genesis, has Evolutions available, Genesis weapons have 4, Zariman
have 5, After obtaining the Incarnon Weapon, visiting Cavalero allows the player to see a challenge that has to be completed to
evolve the weapon, doing such allows the player to choose between 3 upgrades to the weapon, ranging from a small stat boost to
a major mechanic that changes how the weapon handles.
The list of Incarnon Genesis Weapons are as follows, The Schedule Repeats after reaching Week 7.

Warframe Path Quick Start Guide
Few things a newbie should do/understand:
1.
Finish Vor’s Prize, which unlocks all the basic segments & components you need.
2.
Head to Venus Junction to receive the Taxon Sentinel and Vacuum, helps immensely in getting your loot.
3.
Run Bosses (Mission Credits + Frame BP) and Dark Sectors for credits.
4.
After you max (lvl 30) your weapons, try to attain their upgrades, Braton does better than the mk1, so does the Strun, etc etc.
5.
Try to rush to Maroo’s Bazaar on Mars, for the weekly ayatan quest. This is a massive injection of Endo early in the game.
6.
Don’t burn yourself out trying to climb MR too fast. Take your time and enjoy the game.
I have to say that this one is done completely solo, as in, with no one to help me. If you do get someone to help you, great!
However, to find and progress through the game I find this to be the most efficient route.

Right now this should really get you more than started when it comes to playing Warframe. If you’ve made it this far it’s already
taken you through about half the game, and puts you where it’s going to start getting a bit more exciting.


Paradox Mechanics
Gamemodes
The Duviri Experience
Duviri as it was intended to be played. Story (Spiral) and side objectives together. You will be given a series of tasks through a
guided story featuring the many colorful characters residing in the Paradox.
The Duviri Experience is the whole of Duviri, no limitations, Warframe and Drifter combat together as well as all side objectives.
When starting the mission, you arrive at Teshin’s Cave, you get to select your Warframes, Weapons, level up intrinsics, choose your

Teshin’s Cave
Teshin’s Cave is where your “homebase” of sorts, here you are able to select your loadout, drifter weapons, warframe, level up your
intrinsics and custom your kaithe.


You are able to customize your loadout by choosing from a set of randomly selected warframes and weapons, at least 1 option from
each slot will be something you don’t own, everything randomly selected will be the most basic form of the weapon (no prime
versions, syndicate or kuva/tetra versions), at base rank intrinsics, you will have 3 warframe options and one of each weapon
category with one additional weapon from any category, however ranking up intrinsics gives more options for warframes and
weapons to choose from. Your loadout options change after every spiral, or after extracting or defeating an Orowyrm.
If you are below Mastery rank 3, you only have a few basic warframes that can be selected, you are also able to learn about a
warframe by walking up and pressing configure to see each ability and passive as well as the mods currently configured. If you own
the warframe and have at least 1 mod equipped in a mod config, it will allow you to select it.
If you do not own the warframe or weapon, there will be a default set of mods for that warframe/weapon, warframes will have 6
basic mods that are the same across all warframes(Flow, Continuity, Streamline, Stretch, Intensify, and Vitality) and 2 mods based
on their strongest stat, weapons will have 3 mods based on their weapon type(Serration, Split Chamber, and Vigilante Armaments
for Primaries, or Pressure Point, Fury and Reach for Melees), 3 mods based on their strongest stats and 2 mods to increase
damage(Physical and Elemental Damage). All warframes and weapons use config A for its appearance, or default if you don’t own
the warframe or weapon.
If you go to the far left of Teshin’s Cave, you are able to gather a small amount of Duviri resources for free. Every 20 Hours, 6
Random plants from the Duviri will grow and mature, Walking towards the plants will automatically gather all the resources. The 20
hour timer will only countdown once the plants have been gathered. If you enter Teshin’s Cave with a squad, each individual squad
member has access to their own plants and will see their growth progress.
If you go into Duviri without selecting anything, it will be randomly selected for you as well as the configs.
You are able to see what Warframes and Weapons are in Teshin’s Cave while in the Navigation Menu, you are able to hover over the
Warframe Icon and Weapon Icon to see a preview of the items you are going to see within Teshin’s Cave.

Drifter Combat
Drifter combat is a very key part in the Duviri, every Drifter has access to a basic melee attack(“Shoot” Keybind), the basic melee
attack is important within the flow of combat, you are also able to do a heavy attack(“Heavy Melee” Keybind), which does more
damage but requires a long wind up, in combination with these, you are able to use the quick ranged attack(“Aim down sight”
Keybind + “Shoot” Keybind), doing so will quickly pull out your Sirocco and shoot a single shot, this is able to interrupt some attacks
as well as do a little bit of damage, holding down the “Aim down sight” keybind will also bring up your weapon to block incoming
attacks, some attacks can not be blocked however.


As well as the basic attacks, there is also an attack called “Power Strike”(Aim down sight” Keybind + “Heavy Melee” Keybind), these
powerful attacks have a cooldown which can be seen below the aiming reticle.
Holding down the switch weapon keybind will pull out your Sirocco, allowing you to aim more precisely as well as shoot faster, but
you lose the ability to use your melee weapon.
Pressing the reload keybind, you lock onto the enemy closest to your reticle, doing so will forcely lock your reticle to that enemy,
using your mouse wheel you are able to quickly change which enemy you have selected, pressing the keybind again will unlock your
reticle. Target Lock also works on Conservation animals.
When you have your melee weapon selected you are able to parry attacks, to do so you need to press the block keybind as the
attack lands to block any damage you were going to take and open the enemy to a finisher or stun them for a short time.
There are currently 5 drifter weapons to pick from, you start off with the “Sun & Moon”, however you are able to unlock more by
defeating the Orowyrm which drops Pathos Clamps, with those you are able to unlock more weapons.
●
Sun & Moon
○
Power Strike sends forth two arcs of explosive energy.
●
Syam
○
Power Strike unleashes a flurry of deadly slashes.
●
Azothane
○

Drifter and then explode.
●
Edun
○
Power Strike stuns and blinds enemies by surrounding them with a cloud of dust.
●
Sampotes
○
Power Strike slams Sampotes into the ground to damage enemies with a shockwave.
Every drifter has access to 4 abilities that aid them in combat or exploration.
Ability 1 - Summon Kaithe - Summon your Kaithe. Cast again to dismount. Dismounting can also be performed by melee attacking
and can occur when taking damage from enemies.
Ability 2 - Guiding Hand - Cast to release a guiding light that will lead you to the next main objective, or other side objectives in the
area. Guiding Hand will prioritize Conservation targets once a Conservation encounter has started.


Ability 3 - Restorative - Cast to restore 100 Health to Drifter and clear Status Effects.
Ability 4 - Smoke Screen - Cast to throw a smoke grenade that releases smoke in a 10 meter radius, turning Drifter and teammates
invisible while inside of it.
There is a wide set of options that allow you to make your drifter personal, while in Teshin’s Cave head over to the mirror on the left
side, there you are able to customize nearly every part of your drifter.
Kaithe
Upon finishing the Duviri Quest, you unlock your own Kaithe to use while in the Duviri, if you get to intrinsic level 9 of Riding, you
can also use it in open worlds in the Origin System.
To summon your Kaithe, simply use your first ability while as the Drifter, after summoning your Kaithe, you are able to sprint using
the “Sprint” keybind and the “Crouch” keybind to slow down, you can start flying by “Bullet Jumping”(“Crouch” Keybind + “Jump”
Keybind), however if the Kaithe is airborne, simply tap the “Sprint” keybind to start flying, and if you summon your Kaithe while your
Drifter is airborne, the Kaithe will automatically start flying.
Upon taking flight, your Kaithe will simply glide forward and allow you to look around without changing directions. Holding any
directional input (forward, left, right, sprint) will put Kaithe into free mode, where you can use the reticle to move about freely
through the air (vertically and horizontally). Releasing directional input will put Kaithe back into glide mode.
You can press the “Jump” keybind to ascend and the “Crouch” keybind to descend, as well as tapping the “Sprint” keybind your
Kaithe will do a roll. You are also able to hold down the “Sprint” keybind to move faster while in the air.
The Kaithe also has 4 abilities like your Drifter.
Ability 1 - Dismount Kaithe - Dismount from your Kaithe. Dismounting can also be performed by melee attacking and can occur
when taking damage from enemies.
Ability 2 - Guiding Hand - Drifter maintains their Guiding Hand ability while riding Kaithe to spawn a helpful wisp that guides
toward primary objectives and gives Duviri a little color, even if only temporarily.
Ability 3 - Hoof Stomp - Kaithe aggressively stomps into the ground, even from flight, creating a shockwave to stagger and damage
all enemies in the area. Requires Rank 3 Riding Intrinsic


Ability 4 - Steadfast Dismount - While riding a Kaithe, use your 4th ability to gain 150 OVERGUARD (a defense mechanism that
grants 150 additional Health protection and provides Knockdown Immunity as long as there is an amount remaining). 150 second
cooldown between uses. Requires Rank 6 Riding Intrinsic
While in Teshin’s Cave, you are also able to customize your Kaithe, simply walk up to your Kaithe on the left side. There are 4 slots
you can choose from when making your Kaithe your own, Pedigree, Chamfrons, Tails, Saddles. There are “” slots for customizing the
colors of your Kaithe. Upon reaching intrinsic rank 8 in Riding, you can also name your Kaithe.
Decrees
Decrees are a way of upgrading your Drifter and Warframe, after leaving The Duviri or The Undercroft, All decrees will be reset.
Decrees will be awarded after completing Main Stages, Side Objectives or stages of The Undercroft, everyone in the squad is
awarded a decree. All active decrees will work for both Drifter and Warframe alike.
Upon earning a decree, you can choose from 3 randomly chosen options, each one unique. Upon selecting one, it becomes active
immediately, a lot of decrees have tiers, selecting a decree you already own will upgrade it(only if that decree has multiple tiers).
You may occasionally be presented with a “Rare” decree in your selection, as indicated by its gold border. “Rare” as it pertains to
decrees simply means that they offer double the stat upgrades of a normal decree (up to the maximum amount of stacks).
Spiteful Decrees are similar to corrupted mods, you can easily differentiate Spiteful Decrees and Normal Decrees by there dark,
blue-ish outline and red overlay around the icon of the Decree, these decrees have a strong bonus but require you to sacrifice a
percent of Armor, Health, Status Duration, Increased Damage or Accuracy.
When unlocking intrinsic level 6 in Opportunity allows you to “reroll” your chosen decrees up to 3 times per Duviri adventure, level
3 grants you a free decree at the start of every Duviri adventure and level 1 grants 4 options to choose from instead of 3.
You can view all active decrees while in the pause menu.
A list of decrees can be found here.
The Undercroft
The Undercroft is place where your choice of Warframe and weapons become important, upon entering an Undercroft portal, you
will be controlling the Warframe you chose while in Teshin’s Cave as well as the weapons you picked, You will not be using you
Drifter while in the Undercroft, it is purely a Warframe and Operator section. Enemies found in The Undercroft come from both the
Origin System and The Duviri. The mission type is randomly selected from a set of 5 game modes.
●
Defense (Defend 3 waves)
●
Survival (Survive 5 Minutes)
●
Excavation (Excavate 300 Cryotic)

●
Players cannot use their Gear Wheel, nor equip Companions of either the Furry or Robotic persuasion
●
Exalted Equipment (including Exalted Companions like Venari) are used in the Undercroft, and will use the builds in your
selected Mod Configs for your Warframe (i.e. it will use your custom Mod Configs if you choose them, or Default Mods
should you go that route instead).
●
Players use the Focus School and Operator Equipment of their active loadout upon entering Teshin’s Cave, including their
choice of Operator or Drifter (for those who know what that means).
●
Energy Pickups spawn at certain locations across Undercroft Tiles. Search them out for an added boost to your Energy pool.

Orowyrm
Orowyrm’s are the boss of the Duviri, they are the final part to your expedition and allow you to purchase new melee weapons for
your drifter as well as a good source of intrinsics, but be careful they do require quite a bit of effort to defeat!

Kullervo’s Hold
Kullervo’s Hold is an island that appears in Duviri during the Anger, Fear and Sorrow Spirals. Kullervo’s fight unfolds in three stages,
each requiring you to defeat Kullervo as he exits his holding cells.
Fighting Kullervo has a chance of being a main Spiral stage in The Lone Story/The Duviri Experience and can also be completed as a
side objective in The Duviri Experience.

Tread carefully, Kullervo is a fearsome opponent and his attacks are infused with Elemental Damage based on the active Spiral. It is
recommended to enter the fight with at least 5 Decrees selected.
Defeating Kullervo will award all players in the squad with A Decree, Duviri Intrinsics, Duviri Resources and a random amount of
“Kullervo’s Bane'', but Kullervo’s Bane will only be awarded if the Orowyrm has been defeated within the current Duviri run, or will
be awarded if you defeat the Orowyrm after defeating Kullervo. The amount of Kullervo’s Bane awarded is either 4, 5, 6 in Normal
and 5, 7, 8 in Steel Path.
You are able to trade Kullervo’s Bane for Kullervo’s Blueprints, components and the blueprint for the Rauta Shotgun, from Acrithis’
Wares under the “Kullervo’s Archive” option.
Side Objectives
Side objectives are a way to gain Decrees and Duviri resources or they can appear as a main objective, these types of side
objectives are described as such at the bottom of the paragraph.
Maw Feeding
Maw feeding is the fishing equivalent in Duviri, but takes on a new form, to Maw feed, you need to find a transference pad near
ponds/lakes, once you interact with one of these pads, you will take control of a Maw, you need to “chomp” on some fish, getting
near one will automatically eat it, however attacking will also eat nearby fish, pressing “Sprint” will make the Maw move faster, and
pressing “Jump” will boost the Maw forward eating any fish in the way. There is also a timer you have to watch out for, however if
you fail or succeed, you are able to fish in the same pond indefinitely.
Eating 10 fish will give fishing related resources to everyone in the squad, reaching 15 (Marked on the hud) grants you some extra
fishing resources as well as a Decree and some Drifter Intrinsics.(but only once a mission)
The resources you can gain by fishing are
●
Nacreous Pebble
●
Ariette Scale


●
Maw Fang
Conservation
Conservation is also a little different in The Duviri, instead of tracking animals, you are told an animal is nearby over a transmission
by a Duviri citizen named “Koral”.
These void corrupted creatures are also easily noticeable by the red beams they put out, if you don’t get spotted, you can get
behind the creature and slowly crouch towards them, using the “Interact” keybind to help get rid of the corruption, however if you
do get spotted, simply shoot the floating blue orbs, afterwards you able to press the “Interact” keybind to get rid of the corruption,
afterwards the creature will lead you to a chest you can open, however the best part is that you are now able to pet these said
creatures.
Shawzin Playing
Shawzins can be found near populated parts of Duviri, once you pick up a Shawzin, you are given the option of “Normal” or
“Virtuoso”, completing a song on any difficulty will reward a Decree, 3 Intrinsics, and Resources, once per Shawzin Song per Duviri
visit.

another Shawzin location to earn another Decree.
You are also able to earn a Shawzin by completing 12 unique songs on Virtuoso difficulty!
You are unable to start playing the Shawzin if there are enemies within 50 meters.
Kaithe Racing
Start the race by entering the first gate, once crossed the timer countdown begins. Clear all of the required gates to complete the
race. Each successful gate crossed adds 3 seconds to the time to complete the race. Shooting the targets also grants 3 seconds of
additional time. There is no penalty for skipping gates, but you do miss out on gaining those extra seconds.
Successfully completing a Kaithe race rewards Drifter Intrinsics, a Decree and Duviri resources. The more players from the squad
join into the race and complete it, the better the rewards are for the whole team.
This objective can be a main objective during The Duviri Experience or The Lone Story.
Komi
Komi is a popular board game within The Duviri, it resembles a popular game in East Asia called “Go”, Komi has a board of 9x9 and
the goal is to capture enemy pieces by surrounding it.


The rules are simple:
●
Surround enemy stones to capture them.
●
Block the enemy from surrounding your own stones.
●
You cannot block or surround stones using diagonal placements.
●
Immediately after a capture, you cannot place a stone in the same spot from which the stone was captured.
●
Capture 10 stones to win the match.
Komi Tips:
●
Place stones near other stones to shore up your position and create capture opportunities.
●
Loosely connected clusters of stones offer flexibility, but they also leave you more vulnerable.
●
Start at the center of the board to give yourself plenty of room to respond to your opponent.
●
Focus on large captures as you approach the end of the match.
●
You can strategically sacrifice stones to create capture opportunities.
●
Connected stones are your strongest defense.
●
Cast a wide net in the early game to limit your opponent’s maneuverability.
●
Do your best to accomplish more than one strategic goal with each stone you place.

come back at any time.
If you choose to leave and start the “Awakening” Quest, please follow the Warframe Starter Guide
Advanced Mechanics
Stealth
As Space Ninjas, many Warframes are capable of advanced stealth capabilities. While it is fun to run and gun your way through the
Star Chart, it is sometimes necessary to slow down and sneak your way through enemy lines.
Sight and sound are what determines your stealth capability. The enemies have 3 levels of alertness - unalerted, on-guard, and
alerted. When enemies see you, see a comrade killed by you, or hear your weapon, they will become on-guard. If no additional
stimulus is given for a short time, they will return to unalerted. But if they continue to see or hear things, they will become alerted
and attempt to either search you out, or activate the alarms. Once alarms are on, all enemies will become alerted, no matter what
they have seen or heard. This can be disabled by hacking the alarms.
You can avoid alerting enemies in two ways - staying out of sight, or not making sound. Warframes such as Loki and Ash have the
ability to turn invisible, which will keep you out of sight of enemies. Killing enemies and firing weapons will still make their
comrades on-guard. Many weapons come innately silenced, and all melee weapons are considered silent. But all weapons in the
game can be silenced using mods. However, projectile and explosive weapons, even if silenced, can still alert enemies once their
payload is delivered or explodes. In addition, Syndicate Procs from Syndicate weapons cannot be silenced, and will alert enemies if
used.
Alarms can also be triggered by tripping a sensor, camera, or trap. These can be seen from their sweeping detector beams, as
bumps in the floor, or energy walls. Invisible Warframes will not trip cameras, but will trip energy walls and traps.
Disabled and unconscious enemies cannot detect anything to make them alerted. Sleep Warframes such as Equinox and Ivara can
put enemies to sleep, and walk right past them.


Enemy line of sight and sound are influenced by direction and distance. If you kill an enemy when their comrade’s back is turned,
they won’t become suspicious. If you shoot an enemy with an unsilenced weapon a distance away from other enemies, they also
will not become suspicious.
Running, jumping, using abilities, and using gear items will not alert enemies.
Focus (Spoilers)
Q: How do I unlock the Focus trees?
A: After the completion of “The Second Dream” questline.
Q: Which is the best school?
A: That’s mostly opinion based. However, as a quick rundown, here are the schools and their main benefit.
●
Naramon - Combos and Speed
●
Zenurik - Energy
●
Madurai - Damage
●
Unairu - Armor and Defense
●
Vazarin - Instant Revives & Healing
It’s best to choose the school you’re probably going to use the most.


Q: It says Quills need to be unlocked?
A: After the completion of the Plains of Eidolon questline Saya’s Vigil, you speak to the Quills’ leader (North of Konzu) in Cetus. After
that you will be able to upgrade your focus tree(s).
Q: How do lenses work? Why am I not getting focus?
A: Lenses must be equipped to a Warframe or weapon, then used in a mission to gain focus. Lenses change a small percentage of
affinity past lvl 30 to focus. So if you’ve forma’d something, or it’s not level 30, it gains no focus.
Q: Where do I get lenses?
A: You can buy Greater Lens blueprints from the market for credits, or already built ones for plat. Eidolon Lens blueprints and
regular lenses are rewards from PoE’s bounties, while Fortuna bounties only give regular lenses. Lenses can also be traded.
Q: I have a Greater Lens, but I can’t trade it and it doesn't show in the trade menu. What gives?
A: Greater lenses cannot be traded in any way. They can only be obtained in the market or via bounties.
Q: Which school is best for x frame?
Q: What lens should I equip for x frame?
A: It doesn’t really matter. The lenses are only there to gain focus, the effects are universal as long as you equip it. Some schools will
benefit some Warframes more than others, but no school hinders any Warframes.
Q: Can I have more than one school or school’s abilities active at the same time?
A: No, only one school’s passives and abilities may be active at the same time. Your current active school is labeled as Primary and
is at the bottom of the school wheel. However, each school has two nodes called Waybounds, that if unbound using a Brilliant
Eidolon Shard, may be used with other schools. This means you can have up to 8 extra passives/abilities active with your primary
school.
Q: Will I lose my potato/forma/lens if I forma/potato/lens it?
A: Anything that you put on, will stay on the Warframe/weapon. If it’s potatoed before, it stays potatoed. The only one that changes,
is if you put a lens onto a piece of equipment that already has a lens. You then lose the old lens, as it gets replaced.
Q: What are Amps? What do they do?
A: See Amps.
Q: How do I unbound a passive?
A: Firstly check if the node has ‘waybound’ on it. If it does, you can unbind it by maxing it out, then using 750k focus and a Brilliant
Shard to unlock it for any other school.


Arcanes (Spoilers)
Arcanes are fusible upgrade items, similar to mods. They all provide an additional effect, buff, or passive when equipped. The
Arcane menu can be accessed from the Foundry. Arcanes come in 3 rarities, common, uncommon, and rare. All Arcanes can be
fused with copies of themselves to increase their effects.
Arcanes come in either 3 or 6 levels, with each level requiring more copies to upgrade. Level 0 Arcanes need only one copy to use.
Level 0 requires 1 Arcane in total, Level 1 requires 3 total, Level 2 is 6 total, Level 3 is 10 total, Level 4 is 15 total, Level 5 is 21 total.
An Arcane can only be equipped to a specific piece of equipment. There are Arcanes available for Warframes, Primaries and
Secondaries, the Operator, Amps, Zaws, and Kit Guns.
Warframe Arcanes drop from Eidolons, Isolation Vaults, Arbitrations or from Zariman Ten Zero for standing. Operator and Amp
Arcanes can be bought from Quill Onkko, Little Duck or Zariman Ten Zero for Standing. Primary and Secondary Arcanes can be
acquired from Steel Path Acolytes or be bought from Zariman Ten Zero for standing. Zaw Arcanes can only be acquired from Plague
Star. Kitgun Arcanes can be bought from Rude Zuud for Standing or Isolation Vaults.
Weapons can only hold one Arcane at a time, regardless of Arcane level, Kitguns can equip one Primary/Secondary arcane and a
Kitgun arcane. Warframes and the Operator can hold two Arcanes at max, Amps can equip 1 arcane but you must use a Amp Arcane
Adapter to unlock the second slot.
All Arcanes, at any fusion level, can be traded between players.
Cephalon Simaris
Cephalon Simaris is one of the ancient Cephalon AIs created by the Orokin. He is obsessed with how living things function and fight.
He can be found in his Sanctuary in any Relay.


Simaris asks the Tenno to help him with Synthesis, or the scanning and capture of beings from the Origin System, in order to study
them. Simaris will have a daily Synthesis target every 24 hours. Scanning a set number of these targets will award the player with
Standing and a reward from Simaris’ drop table, usually Endo.
Scanning targets requires a Synthesis Scanner, a modified version of the Codex Scanner. It can be bought from Simaris’ offerings
for credits. Simaris also offers Synthesis Traps, which will trap and suspend a Synthesis target for a short period of time.
When starting a mission with a target present, Simaris will inform you when you enter the mission. By looking through a Synthesis
Scanner, you can see a trail of blue and white floating prints that will lead to the target. Each target has 4 scannable points on its
body. Each one must be scanned once to fully capture the target.
Scanning anything other than the target will reward a small amount of Standing, even if the item being scanned has already been
completed in the Codex.
Simaris’ offerings include unique and powerful mods, weapons, mod transmute cores, Scanner modifications, and Captura Scenes.
It also includes the Simulacrum access key.
The Simulacrum
Cephalon Simaris’ Simulacrum is a simulator the Tenno can use to test their weapons and abilities in. You must obtain the
Simulacrum access key from Simaris’ offerings for 50,000 Standing in order to access it.
Within, you will find a small datascape tileset, with an Arsenal, spawning console, and infinite health, energy, and ammo pickups on
a raised platform. The spawning console has the ability to spawn up to 20 enemies at once. The enemies available are ones that
have been fully scanned into the Codex. You can then modify if the enemies can move or not, their level, and give yourself
invincibility from their attacks.
There is a second room you can unlock called the “Ballroom”, it can be unlocked from the “”Nights of Naberus”” Event for 55 Mother
Tokens. It as all the options of the original Simulacrum but the enemies spawn in one area instead of three.


Captura
Captura is a somewhat hidden feature for taking screenshots. It can be found in any Warframe’s appearance menu, in the upper
right as a camera icon. Captura allows you to enter a specific tile or location, and gives extra options for camera, lighting, filters, and
angles.
Captura Scenes can be bought from Syndicates, NPCs, as rewards from missions, or traded between players. You cannot use
Captura without having at least one scene.
When entering Captura, you can open the Menu with [G]. This will pause the scene and everything in it, and gives you a free camera
separate from your Warframe view. From there you can edit lighting, filters, and field of view for the optimum angle. From there you
can screenshot through Warframe or a third-party source.
A full squad can join one Captura Scene, for multi-Warframe screenshots. Only the host can access the Menu though.


Etiquette
1.
Don’t go into a mission without knowing what your frame can do, and what it’s supposed to do.
2.
Don’t ignore the chat. Lots of bad things can happen when the chat is ignored.
3.
Stick with your team, affinity is shared. Don’t hallway-hero (sit in one hallway and kill things without your team).
4.
Don’t use Life Support in survival missions if it’s over 70%, they all restore 30%. Preferably restore it at 40, so if 2 players try
to restore at the same time, none gets wasted.
5.
Wait for people at elevators/checkpoints, last in gets to send it off.
6.
If you see a cephalon fragment/rare drop, mark it with your waypoint [G]. Rare drops have a large gold or green line/vertical
beam of light that extends upward from them. Even if you don’t see it, you can mark its general area.
7.
If you see flickering, try to regroup with allies. This usually marks an Assassin or hit-squad, hard to kill enemies that will hunt
you down.
8.
Unless you’re playing with friends, or they say so, starting the timer on a mission in the lobby before everyone is ready is a
jackass move.
9.
During Excavation missions, carry power cells with you when going to the next Excavator.
10. If you can’t do a Spy, say so, it’s better to learn than to constantly mess it up every time.
11. Pubs are pubs, don’t expect them to play the way you want, ask if they can do something different if it’s hindering the
mission.
12. If you’re getting ready to close the game but want to play one or two more missions, don’t play endless missions. Most
people want a full rotation, i.e. 20 waves / 20 mins / 4 Excavators.
13. When doing things on the Plains of Eidolon, Orb Vallis or Deimos, if you’re the host please don’t exit randomly. You’ll mess
up other people’s drops.

leave the field you will keep the effect 5 seconds, You are also able to summon a Necramech if you own one, they have a 2
minute duration once summoned and go onto a 10 minute cooldown after being destroyed or the timer running out.


●
Mirror Defense (Tyana Pass) - Forever crystallized by the Warframe Citrine, Belric and Rania reside at either end of a tunnel

and Venus. But the Void draws in many curious and dangerous minds to it, threatening the very entities holding it together.
Unlike traditional Defense where enemies are fought off in waves, Mirror Defense consists of a time limit of 2 and a half
minutes for both crystals, with a 30 second downtime in between. A rotation is completed once both crystals have been

Mission Rotation Rewards
Some missions have specific reward tables after accomplishing/finding certain objectives. They are referred to using the letters A, B,
and C. Missions like Spy and Sabotage give their rewards consecutively, meaning all 3 objectives must be found/completed to get

Assassination nodes are boss fights, that are usually required to get to or complete Junctions. Each boss has unique attacks and
attributes, and drop Warframe and weapon parts.
Standard Assassination Nodes

Councilor Vay Hek will appear in a drone-like state, which you will have to damage and follow through 4 phases. His face and
backside have weak points that can be damaged. They will be open to attack after Vay Hek uses his red shock attack. After the third
phase, Vay Hek's drone state will transform into his Terra Frame state, a large bipedal cyborg. His entire body will then be able to
be damaged.

glowing node on his back to break one of the 4 tubes connected to his body. By doing this, it will cause Kril to freeze the next time
he brings his hammer down. At this time he may be damaged anywhere on his body. All 4 tubes must be destroyed similarly. Once
all tubes are destroyed, Kril will burst in a fire nova, and all his attacks will now deal heat damage instead of cold. This is his final

vulnerable to attack. If Zanuka is able to revive Alad, both its shields and Alad's will be restored. Alad cannot be defeated until

Naamah, Europa - The Raptor
The Raptor appears as 3 large Corpus drone proxies. Each will rise out of a shielded holding cell, one at a time. Once airborne, it
can be damaged at any part of its body. Once defeated, it will drop a core that can be picked up. The core must then be dropped in
one of the holding cells, thus destroying it. This is then repeated for each following Raptor. It should be noted that the explosion

above the arena and flood the lower area. you must make your way to the upper catwalks at this point. He will then spawn several
Drekar Manics and Bombards. Upon defeating the last Manic/Bombard, Regor will appear for the final time.


It is recommended to use viral, radiation, and magnetic damage against Tyl Regor.
Tyl Regor has the chance to drop the Day/Night Chassis, Day/Night Neuroptics, Day/Night Systems, or Day/Night Blueprint for

Hades, Pluto - Ambulas
To access this mission, you must have 20 Animo Nav Beacons in your inventory. These are dropped from regular Ambulas proxies
on mission nodes on Pluto. On successful completion of the Assassination, 10 Animo Beacons will be refunded.
In the boss arena, Ambulas' will rise one by one from underground platforms to attack you. You must damage each until it is
disabled, then hack it. A timer will display when a Corpus dropship will come to collect the Ambulas. 4-6 hacked Ambulas' are
required to complete the mission. Letting the Corpus collect 3 unhacked Ambulas' will result in mission failure. Corpus
reinforcements will try to revive the Ambulas' once hacked, so each one must be defended until the dropship can take it away.
It is recommended to use Magnetic and Radiation damage against the Ambulas.
Ambulas has the chance to drop the Chassis, Neuroptics, or Systems for Trinity upon defeat.
Merrow, Sedna - Kela De Thaym
You must have 25 Judgment Points in order to access this mission. Judgment Points can be acquired from Rathuum Arena nodes.
To access the arena, 4 rotating panels in a circular room must be shot at to activate all 4 buttons. The buttons will turn from orange
to green when activated. After a short time period, the buttons will revert to orange, so all must be activated quickly. Once all 4
buttons on a panel are activated, the panel will stop spinning. All 4 panels must be stopped to enter the boss arena. While
activating the panels, Grineer Rollers will regularly spawn in the room.


Kela De Thaym can be damaged in 3 phases. She will immediately appear upon entering the arena. After losing one third of her
health, she will jump back to her observation platform, where she is immune to damage. An orbital barrage will start, with large
target marks appearing on the ground, signaling where the rockets will land. While this is happening, 4 panels identical to the ones
used to enter the arena appear around the center platform. These must be activated in the same way. Rollers will also spawn at this
point. Once all 4 panels are stopped, Kela De Thaym will re-enter the arena. Repeat until she is defeated.
It is recommended to use corrosive and magnetic damage against Kela De Thaym.
Kela De Thaym has the chance to drop the Chassis, Neuroptics, or Systems for Saryn upon defeat.
The Ropalolyst, Jupiter - The Ropalolyst
The Ropalolyst is a flying Sentient raid boss. In its arena, 4 large energy pillars surround the central platform. You must lure the
Ropalolyst to one of the pillars, and goad it into using its laser attack. As soon as it fires, duck behind the pillar so the laser hits it.
This overcharges that pillar. Next, damage the Ropalolysts shields with Void damage. Then get near enough to the Ropalolyst to be
able to activate it, and mount it. After 30 seconds, the Ropalolyst will kick you off, so do this step quickly. Ride the Ropalolyst so it
collides with the overcharged pillar. This will stun it and knock it back onto the central platform. Destroy one of the Synovias on its
hind legs, and then use the console on the side of the platform to activate the Terran laser, damaging it. Repeat all previous steps
two more times.
On the third time that the Ropalolyst is knocked onto the platform, its entire body is vulnerable to damage, and it will spawn
Conculysts and Battalysts to defend itself.
It is recommended to use radiation and magnetic damage against the Ropalolyst.
The Ropalolyst has the chance to drop the Blueprint, Chassis, Neuroptics, or Systems for Wisp upon defeat.
Key Based Assassinate Nodes
Mulalist Alad V Assassinate, Eris - Mutalist Alad V (SPOILERS)

Coordinates are rewards for Infested Invasions or Orokin Derelict Survival/Defense.
Mutalist Alad V is the corrupted version of the boss found on Jupiter. He is invulnerable to damage when his collar is on. When he
uses his collar to attack with his electrical beam or to control another Tenno, he can be damaged. When Alad removes his collar and
throws it, and it connects with a player, that player is controlled by Alad [AI] for a short period of time. The controlled player will
attack the others, with full (modded) damage from abilities and weapons. This is his most dangerous attack, as well equipped
players can insta-kill their entire team if controlled.

standard Juggernaut, but with less health. The second phase is Archwing based. Jordas Golem appears as a huge, infested ship. Only
its rear engines can be damaged. It has an immense amount of health, and takes a large amount of firepower to defeat.

dojo.
Lephantis appears as a huge, 3 headed infested entity, with each head representing a faction - Corpus, Grineer, and Infested. The
fight has 2 phases. In the first phase, each head will periodically burst from the ground and attack you. When a head attacks, it
becomes vulnerable to attack. Only the pink areas are able to be damaged. When a head's health is depleted, it will stop rising from
the ground. Once all 3 heads are defeated, the second phase will start. The floor will collapse, and the torso and legs of Lephantis
will be visible. Each head must be destroyed in the same way as in the first phase.
It is recommended to use corrosive and blast damage against Lephantis.
Lephantis has the chance to drop the Chassis, Neuroptics, or Systems for Nekros upon defeat.
The Conclave
The Conclave is a neutral Faction led by Teshin. It is made up of the only PvP game modes of Warframe, along with unique Faction
rewards.
Conclave Game Modes


●
Annihilation - Free for all, every player killed drops a red Oro pickup. First player to collect 25 Oros, or the player with the
most after 10 minutes wins.
●
Team Annihilation - 4 v 4 Deathmatch, every player killed drops a red Oro pickup. First team to collect 50 Oros, or the team
with the most after 10 minutes wins.
●
Cephalon Capture - 4 v 4 Capture the Flag. A team must steal the enemy Cephalon from the enemy base and bring it to their
base to score. First team to reach the score limit wins.
●
Lunaro - 4 v 4 sport game, similar to Football (American Soccer). No weapons are used. A player must take control of the
Lunaro sphere and get it into the enemy goal to score. First team to reach the score limit wins.
Conclave game modes allow for any Warframes and weapons to be used, but PvE mods cannot be used. There are special Conclave
PvP mods that can be acquired through the Faction or regular gameplay that can be equipped in your Conclave arsenal.
Weapons and Warframe abilities are modified in the Conclave for balancing reasons. Some weapons and abilities may perform
differently from how you are used to them in regular missions, and some abilities may be disabled entirely. Warframes also have
modified health, shield, and armor values in the Conclave.
It should be noted that due to the uniqueness and lack of content in the Conclave, it is regularly under-populated and games take
much longer to find than in the Star Chart.
Equipment
Warframes
Warframes function as the classes of Warframe. Each one comes equipped with unique passives and abilities, with different
strengths and weaknesses.
Q: If I potato/use a Orokin Reactor on a Warframe, is it permanent?
A: Yes.
Q: Can I use multiple potatoes/reactors on my Warframe?
A: No.
Q: Do I have to wait until lvl 30 to potato my Warframe?
A: No, once used it will always double your mod capacity. So if you potato it at lvl 3 it gains +3, but when you level it to 30, it will
give +30.
Q: Do I have to potato my frame after every forma?


A: No, potatoes are permanent. Putting a forma on an item will reset its level to 0 but it will let you add a polarity slot of your choice
to it.
Q: Does a Warframe keep any potatoes or forma installed if I sell it?
A: No, selling a Warframe deletes that instance of it. Building a Warframe of the same type would just be creating a new instance,
and upgrades will have to be done again.
Q: What’s this locked mod slot beside the aura?
A: That’s an exilus slot, unlocked by an exilus adaptor. You can only put exilus mods into it. (See modding for exilus mods)
Q: I found a Warframe that I like, where do I find the blueprints/parts for it?
A: Here is a list of places to get them from, sorted by name. They are dropped by bosses on an Assassinate node, via Quests, from
missions, from specific enemies, or in your Clan Dojo.

Q: What are Prime Warframes?
A: Lore wise, they’re prototypes (the original frames). Gameplay wise, they give minor buffs to shields / armor / health / energy,
have alternate mod polarities, and come with a unique skin. Otherwise they’re basically the same as the normal ones.
Q: How do I get Prime Warframes?
A: Farm for the relics where the parts are sealed in, and unlock the relic to get the part. Prime Warframes have the same parts as
regular; blueprint, chassis, neuroptics, and systems. Prime Warframe blueprints can also be traded between players, or bought with
real currency in Prime Access or Prime Unvaulting packs. Occasionally, Twitch Prime will have a Prime Warframe available to
subscribers.

Frame Etiquette
When playing with certain frames, try to work with them, often you’ll do much better and the mission will be much easier.
●
Banshee
○
Shoot the massive glowing spots. Deals quite a lot of damage.
●
Chroma
○
Let Chroma run out first, much better if they shoot him rather than you. Also, stand near him to gain buffs.
●
Equinox
○
If day or night, try to stay in her aura (swirly thing around her). It either gives power strength buffs, heals, or reduces
enemy damage.
●
Frost
○
Stay in the globe if you don’t want to get shot at.
○
Can cast globe multiple times to add armor to it.
○
For Frosts, clean up your globes (by pressing 1 on it while you’re on the outside) and don’t globe interception points.
●
Gara
○
Colour your energy less bright. Super bright colours are annoying when it comes to mass vitrify.
○
If possible, help keep allies alive. Your 2 can be cast on them so they also receive damage reduction.
●
Harrow
○
If it’s a team based Harrow, with a large circle around him, let him get kills. Gives everyone, including him, energy. If
you kill them, neither you nor the Harrow will get the energy
●
Hydroid
○
Shoot into the puddle. Also try to help him out by killing Nullifiers.
○
Puddles can heal you if the Hydroid has the augment.
●
Inaros


○
If you’re the Inaros, stop leeching health of allies while downed.
○
Try not to spam Sandstorm, it makes targets really difficult to hit and messes up melee combos.
●
Ivara
○
Staying in the bubble gives you invisibility.
●
Limbo
○
For Limbos, don’t always stasis everything unnecessarily. It’s generally not needed.
○
Rolling removes the rift.
●
Nekros
○
When playing with a Nekros, use slash based weaponry. It breaks the bodies into additional pieces and that means
more loot.
●
Nezha
○
Staying in the fire from firewalker removes debuffs.
●
Nidus
○
In longer missions, try not to mess with a Nidus and his stacks, he needs it for the later part of the game. This means
not blowing up the things in his larva unless he asks you to.
○
Stand on the grass if health is needed.
●
Nyx
○
Don’t shoot at a Nyx’s absorb unless she’s trying to leech or AFK.
○
For Nyxes, when playing a defense or intercept, you can remove mind control by pressing 1. Stops the wait for the
last enemy to die
●
Oberon
○
Stand near him for healing, and stand on the grass to get Iron Renewal
●
Octavia
○
Crouch to the beat to get invisibility, jump to get movespeed, shoot to get multishot, and melee to get extra damage.
●
Saryn
○
Shoot spores on enemies.
●
Titania
○
Don’t knock away her lantern (glowing enemy that looks like it has a vortex on it).
●
Trinity
○
For Trinities, keep your player list up by pressing [Z] and watch your allies’ health.
○
For Trinities, even if you’re an EV Trin or a Blessing, you can still cast the rest of your skills.
○
Stay near and protect Trinity to gain health and energy.
●
Volt
○
Electric shield works 2 ways.
○
Backflipping (aim + back + roll) removes speed.

Q: What does it mean for something to be “vaulted”?
A: It means the relics for the vaulted item can no longer be obtained in the regular game. However, relics and parts already owned
do not go away, and Primed items can still be traded.
Q: If a frame gets vaulted, do I get to keep the frame?
A: Yes, of course!
Q: You said nothing about Excalibur Prime, is he still farmable?
A: No, he’s not in the Prime Vault and he’s not farmable. He was part of the Founder’s package back when the game was first
released. He is currently unobtainable by any means. He will most likely never be obtainable ever again.
Q: How does vaulting work?
A: All relics that will be vaulted will be removed from drop tables. Anything else you have, you will keep. This includes the relics
themselves, the items, parts and crafted items.


Q: Will the vault be reopened?
A: Currently it works on a monthly “Prime Resurgence” Rotation, every month or so, a new duo of warframes and a few weapons
will be obtainable. You can purchase the relics needed to unlock these Primes from Varzia on Maroo’s Bazaar for Aya, which can be
obtained as a reward from any drop table that rewards relics.
Fashion Frame and Cosmetics (SPOILERS)
Fashion Frame is the act of combining different color, armor, and skin combinations on a Warframe to make it look cool and unique,
or to fit a theme. The term also applies to weapons, Companions and Operators. This is considered an endgame, optional activity,
as almost all of the cosmetics and colors necessary for Fashion Frame cost Plat or real currency.
When pertaining to colors, an item’s secondary energy color is unlocked after a Forma is applied to that item. Primary and
secondary energy is fused into a two-tone effect. Warframes, weapons, Syandanas, and companions can have secondary energy
colors.


There are three types of cosmetic items; Deluxe, Tennogen, and Prime Access.
●
Deluxe items are created by DE and always cost Plat. They include Warframe skins, weapon skins, armor packs, Companion
armor, Operator armor, Operator accessories, Syandanas, and Sugatras.
●
Tennogen items are created by digital artists with creative permissions from DE. Tennogen items always cost a
predetermined amount of real currency, 30% of which goes to the artist/creator of the item. Tennogen items include
Warframe skins, weapons skins, Operator accessories, and Syandanas.
●
Prime Access items are always included in the Accessories Pack of a Prime Access, and are available only as long as the
Prime Access is. They are not obtainable in any other way. The Accessories Pack costs real currency, and can either be
bought on its own or as part of the Tier 3 Prime Access pack. Prime Access items can include helmets for the newly Primed
Warframe, Prime armor sets, Primed Operator armor, Primed Operator accessories, Prime Syandanas, and Prime Sugatras.
Regalia
There are 3 types of Regalia; Emblems, Sigils, and glyphs.
Emblems are equipped in the Regalia section of the Warframe appearance menu, and include the Clan and Alliance emblems, along
with any Event emblems earned. They appear on your Warframe’s left and right shoulders. Only the Clan and Alliance emblems can
be purchased.
Sigils are equipped in the Regalia section of the Warframe appearance menu, and include the Assassin and Syndicate sigils. They
appear on your Warframe’s chest and back. Sigils cannot be purchased, but are occasionally available in Prime Access.
Glyphs are equipped in the Profile section of the [ESC] menu. They appear next to your name and gear in the squad list. Glyphs can
be earned, bought with platinum, redeemed with access codes, or awarded by other players/streamers. Your equipped glyph is also
what appears when using the Glyph gear item.
Weapons
Q: Should I potato/use an orokin catalyst on x?
A: A general rule of thumb is if you feel that it’s good, potato it. However, it’s a pretty good idea NOT to potato/upgrade the mk 1
weapons and to experiment before you potato a weapon.
Q: If I potato / use a catalyst on a weapon is it permanent?
A: Yes.
Q: Can I use multiple potatoes / catalysts on my weapon?
A: No.


Q: Do I have to wait until lvl 30 to potato / catalyst my weapon?
A: No, once used it will always double your mod capacity. So if you potato it at lvl 3 it gains +3, and if you level it to 30, it will give
+30.
Q: How do I use forma? I heard you can upgrade weapons with it.
A: On a lvl 30 or maxed piece of equipment, go to upgrade, on the bottom right side, there should be an action button. Once you
click on it, you have a choice to forma your weapon to give it another polarity.
Q: What are Prime weapons?
A: Lore wise, they’re prototypes (the original weapons). Gameplay wise, they give minor buffs to its stats. Otherwise they’re
basically the same as the normal ones with a different aesthetic.
Q: How do I get Prime weapons?
A: Farm for the relics where the parts are sealed in, and unlock the relic to get the part. Prime weapons have a multitude of parts
needed to build, depending on the weapon and type. Prime weapon blueprints can also be traded between players, or bought with
real currency in Prime Access or Prime Unvaulting packs. Occasionally, Twitch Prime will have a Prime weapon available to
subscribers.
Q: What does it mean for something to be “vaulted”?
A: It means the relics for the vaulted item can no longer be obtained in the regular game. However, relics and parts already owned
do not go away, and Primed items can still be traded.
Q: Which weapons do I need to build other weapons?
A: See this chart: Might be outdated, need to check!


Q: What weapons should I get first?
A: See the suggested List below.
The Suggested Beginner Weapon List
These weapons are handpicked for 3 distinct categories. They are easy to obtain, easy to mod and easy to use. When we say this, it
means that stuff like the Prisma Grakata don’t belong, since they aren’t always available. Neither are weapons with immensely
expensive mod requirements (ie Maiming Strike > 2 Primed mods). Preference should be paid to weapons that are available early
(Pre MR7).
The Following is a Suggested list of beginner weapons and do not represent the best weapons in the game.


Primaries
●
DMR - Latron MR 0 & Veldt MR 8
The Latron is a good all around starter weapon, it boasts high accuracy and fire rate but has a high recoil. Veldt on the other
hand is more akin to a sniper without being one, high dmg and fire rate make it a no brainer for the Tenno marksman.
●
Rifle - Baza MR7 & Soma MR 6
The Baza is a low damage, high fire rate smg that has damage fall off like a shotgun but has a high crit chance and is innately
silenced, and is solid for most of the Star Chart.
The Soma is a cross between an assault rifle and an LMG, a small spool up but high fire rate and good crit rate like the Baza,
in addition to a high mag size.
●
Shotgun - Hek MR4 & Tigris MR 7
The Hek and its variants are a great early game shotgun that don't require much to make it work. Good mag size and decent
damage make it a good choice for early game. The Tigris is a double barrel pain train, fast reload speed and low spread are
only a few things that make this shotgun good.
●
Bow - Dread MR5 & Rakta Cernos MR12
The Dread is one of the easiest bows to get but it still packs a huge punch. With a single crit mod, high crit chance and slash
damage. The Rakta Cernos on the other hand fires much faster than the dread, but has the impact damage type which isn't
as good as slash.
●
Sniper - Rubico MR6 & Vectis MR 2
The Rubico is a good all around sniper, boasting one of the highest crit multipliers of any gun, as well as a decent mag size.
The Vectis and its Prime counterpart have the highest status of any sniper but have to be constantly reloaded.
Secondaries
●
Shotgun - AkBronco MR2 & Bronco MR0
The Bronco and its dual series are the only pocket shotguns pre-MR7 that are easy to get. It packs a punch with decent all
rounder stats, with the exception of a really small clip. With the resources that are needed to craft it, Neurodes, Alloy Plates,
Ferrite and Polymer Bundles, it’s pretty feasible to obtain it early.
●
Burst Pistol - Sicarus MR3 & Kraken MR 0
The Sicarus is a burst fire, highly accurate pistol that also has a good crit chance. The only downside to the Sicarus is the low
mag capacity. The kraken on the other hand is a status pistol that fires a double shot on every trigger pull with the downside
being high recoil.
●
SMG - Afuris MR2 & Akstiletto MR 8
Both secondary smgs that are recommended have fast fire rate, and they boast solid damage with good accuracy.
●
Beam Weapon - Atomos MR5 & Nukor MR 4
Both weapons are extremely good early game and have the potential to be taken into late game with certain mod loadouts.
Melee
●
Polearm - Orthos (Prime) MR2 & Tonbo MR3


Both the Orthos and Tonbo have good range and are fast, great for clearing a group of enemies. They also have good status,
and should be modded for slash procs.
●
Whip - Lecta MR0 & Atterax MR2 & Scoliac MR6
All whips are a great melee choice, as they have high attack speed and extremely long range with good damage.
●
Hammer - Jat Kittag MR5
Great with quick attacks, continuous use, finishers etc. High damage, moderate range.
●
Greatsword - Galatine MR3 & Gram MR 2
Extremely high damage, very slow attack speed.
●
Fist Weapon - Hirudo MR7 & Ankyros MR 0
The Hirudo can deal lifesteal attacks and is extremely fast. The Ankyros is a gateway weapon that you need to turn into
other fist weapons.
●
Nikana - Nikana MR4 & Nikana Prime MR 0
Overall great stats, especially attack speed and crit. Easily usable throughout any mission. Use it to finish off enemies easily,
as it blends combat together very well. Moderate damage, speed, and range. The Prime version of the nikana is better in
almost every stat but is just harder to farm for.

Q: Will the vault be reopened?


A: Currently it works on a monthly “Prime Resurgence” Rotation, every month or so, a duo of prime warframes and a few weapons
will be obtainable. You can purchase the relics needed to unlock these Primes from Varzia on Maroo’s Bazaar for Aya, which can be
obtained as a reward from any drop table that rewards relics.
Q: How does vaulting work?
A: All relics that will be vaulted will be removed from drop tables. Anything else you have, you will keep. This includes the relics
themselves, the items, parts and crafted items.
Companions
There are 3 different types of companions that can accompany you and your Warframe on missions. Each type has special precept
mods that provide unique abilities and passives. You may only have one active companion at a time. Precept mods will be used
most in the order they are placed starting with the top left being the most used and the bottom right being the least used.
Beasts
There are two species of Beast companions, Kubrows and Kavats. They are bred and managed in the Incubator segment of your
Orbiter. Each new Beast requires an Incubator Power Core, the blueprint for which is found in the Market.
Only one Beast companion may be active and available to use at a time. The others you own are stored in Stasis.
When a Beast companion is bred, it will appear as a puppy or kitten. The Beast can be kept in this state indefinitely. It must be
matured for combat in order to take on missions.
When breeding a Beast, imprints can be used instead of a random incubation. Imprints are taken from an already existing Kubrow
and Kavat. A max of two imprints can be taken from every unique Beast. These imprints can then be traded and/or reused. Two
imprints are required to breed a focused Beast. Depending on genetics from the original Beast, you can determine the new Beast’s
gender, breed, size, and fur pattern.
The Nutrio Incubator Upgrade Segment can be obtained from the Clan Dojo. It reduces egg incubation from 48 hours to 24 hours.
Kubrows
Kubrows resemble large, sturdy canines. They are unique in that they lay eggs instead of giving live birth. To breed a Kubrow, the
Howl of the Kubrow Quest must be completed, a Kubrow egg must be obtained, and the Incubator segment installed. Kubrow eggs
only drop from Kubrow Dens on Earth. They can also be bought in the Market for 10p.

MOAs
MOA companions are a modular Companion introduced with Fortuna. They are repurposed Corpus Proxies. All MOA part blueprints
can be bought from Legs for Standing.
MOAs are built from 4 different components - the Model, Core, Gyro, and Bracket. There are currently 3 Models, 3 Cores, and 7
Gyros to choose from, with only one Bracket. Models determine the MOA’s precept mods, the Core and Gyro determine additional
health, shield, and armor buffs. The Bracket determines the MOA’s legs.
Each of the MOA Models can give 6k standing after Gilding.
Like Kit Guns and Zaws, MOA Companions must be Gilded in order to further upgrade and customize them. Gilding requires a max
level MOA, 10 Training Debt-Bonds, and 5k Standing. You cannot install a Potato or Forma, or customize colors until the MOA is
Gilded.

Archwing
Archwing is a unique mission type involving a special vehicle, called Archwing. There are 4 different Archwing flight suits, and one
Primed one, along with a roster of primary and melee weapons. The Archwing suit acts like a Warframe, with 4 unique abilities.
Archwing missions are spread throughout the Star Chart, and resemble regular missions, such as exterminate, interception and
mobile defense. During these missions only Archwing abilities, weapons, and mods can be used. Your Warframe and weapon
loadout does not matter, and can’t be used. The only way to get Archwing mods is by doing Archwing missions.
Archwing parts and blueprints can be found in your Clan Dojo. Archwing weapon parts and blueprints can be found in Syndicate
reward tables.

Gear
Gear items are buildable equipment that can be used in-game. Some notable gear items include health, energy, and ammo restores,
ciphers, fishing spears, mining lasers, and Specters.
Q: How do I access my gear?
A: The default binding is “Q”
Q: How much gear can I bring along?
A: You have 12 main slots which can be hotkeyed, and infinite slots after that which have to be rotated to in missions. Technically,
you can have every piece of gear with you on a mission. However, consumable gear items have a limit to how many you can bring
on one mission. For example, ciphers max out at 200, so if you own 500, only 200 will be delegated to your gear wheel in a
mission.
Q: What should I normally bring?
A: Generally, bring ciphers (for hacking consoles), energy, health, and ammo consumables (aka pizzas or pancakes), and codex
scanners. Everything else is determined by preference or need.
Q: What are Specters?
A: Specters are a deployable AI that can be used in missions. They will follow and defend you until killed or the missions ends, or
you can set them to defend an area using [E]. Warframe Specter blueprints are rewarded from Rescue missions, while other
Specters come from Syndicates. Warframe Specters can copy your loadouts, and will use the weapons you assign them when
deployed.
Mods
Collecting and upgrading your arsenal with mods allows for ultimate customization. Mods appear as cards, and can be found,
earned, and traded in game.


Q: What are mods?
A: Mods are items that you can slot into your weapons, frames and companions that augment stats or add additional effects.
Modding can be as simple as giving additional crit to a weapon, adding health to a frame, or as complex as building a frame for a
certain ability. Mods are your power through the game, and are the reason why basically anything will scale. Without them, you’re
immensely weak compared to the enemies you face.
Q: Can I get more than x slots to hold mods?
A: There is no way to increase the amount of mods your Warframe/ Weapon can hold, the only exception would be via Exilus Slots,
however those are only usable once.
Q: I have a brown mod, is there a silver or gold mod that’s better than it?
A: Better versions of any specific mods are uncommon. Mods are designed to each have a unique ability. Instead of having better
versions of a mod, mods are upgradeable through fusion. However, all Primed mods are direct upgrades to their non-prime
counterparts.
Q: How does Status and Elements work? Are they optional?
A: Elements are very highly recommended, and Status procs are immensely helpful. See Damage for more information.
Q: Should I max ‘x’? (Primed mod/mod/rank 10)
A: Generally, you don’t need to max mods especially if you’re starting out. Getting to a R6-R8 is slightly better since it provides you
more bang for your buck. (See question right below why R6’s don’t need as much Endo).
Q: How does mod ranking work?
A: A mod will have a base Endo and Credit cost according to its rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare and Legendary). This cost
roughly doubles for every rank that you upgrade it to, so it’s exponential. This means that the last 2 ranks of a R10 mod usually takes
about 75% of the mod’s total cost.

By ranking something to R6, you get 7/11ths (63.63%) of the benefit for only 6.25% of the cost. It’s similar to R8, having 9/11th
(81.81%) of the benefit for 25% of the total cost.
Q: What’s that mod slot right above the main modding slots on melee weapons?
A: That’s the stance mod slot. Think of it similar to an Aura for Warframes. It gives you more mod capacity and changes the way that
your melee works in terms of combos and attacks.
Q: What are some of the important mods?
A: See charts below.

Primed Mods
Q: Where do I get them?
A: Generally, you buy them from Baro Ki’Teer or you trade for them.
Q: Do I need them?
A: You can progress through the game without them, so no. These are mainly just for min-maxers and optimizers to squeeze every
little bit out of a build.
Q: I can’t trade for or get Primed Vigor, Fury, Shred or Sure Footed what gives?
A: Those can only be gained from the Daily Login reward and are locked to prevent people from making smurfs to farm it.
Q: How expensive are they to upgrade?
A: All Primed Mods can go to Rank 10, and will cost 40,920 Endo and 1,976,436 credits each to go from 0-10. It is recommended to
save Legendary Fusion Cores for Primed mods.
Q: What are the ones that have already been released?
A: All blue come from Baro, the green ones come from the daily tribute, purple ones are from a quest.

How to Mod - Warframes
Muffin’s over-oversimplified guide to modding Warframes. (Starchart only, Endurance has some different builds for minmaxxing)
1.
Determine it’s best stats, and what it’s most suited for.
a.
i.e. a Valkyr has high innate armor and health, but very little shield.
b.
Inaros has a tons of health, but no shields, so don’t mod for shields.
c.
Volt generally has a ton of shields, so maxxing it, would be helpful.
2.
Get your survivability mods.
a.
These refer to mods which help you survive. If you feel that you don’t die too much feel free to skip.
b.
Quick Thinking, Vitality, Redirection, Vigor, Steel Fiber, Armored Agility, Adaptation, Health Conversion
c.
If your job is to tank, or your abilities depend on either Armor or Health, it’s wise to mod for that first.
3.
Get your core mods.
a.
These refer to the mods that make or break a certain build.
b.
If your build calls for an augment, then that will be its core mod. If it does not, then skip this section.
4.
Check the stats your skill needs then upgrade your Power Strength, Range, Duration and Efficiency.
a.
Determine which of the skills need the most modding. This determines the order of how you’ll mod.
i.
Modding an EV means -Duration>+Range>+Strength where efficiency doesn’t matter too much.
ii.
A Hysteria Valkyr only benefits from +Efficiency and -Range, +Strength should come second to that.


iii.
It’s possible to get under 100% on any given stat. Play around with your build to see which stats are less
needed than others.
How to Mod - Weapons
1.
Start with your “mandatory” mods (Damage & Multishot)
2.
Check out the stats, if it’s above 15% crit chance build for crit, if above 15% status build for status
a.
Hybrid builds exist, although it might be easier to forego and focus on one side
3.
Build it either for Pure Damage, Crit, Status, Hybrid
a.
Damage - Add Elementals, tons of them
b.
Crit - Crit chance & Damage
c.
Status - Preferably the dual stat elemental + status.mods
d.
Hybrid - Mix and match until you run out of mod space
4.
If there are still slots not full, add utility mods, reload, punch through and whatever else you might want.
Distant Observer has one of the most easily understandable guides for this
Riven Mods
Q: What are Riven mods? How do I unveil them?
A: Riven Mods are rare and powerful mods that appear as purple mod cards. They start out as a ??? riven, in this state it not take up
a riven slot. Upon equipping a riven it becomes Veiled, in this state you must complete the challenge on the riven in order to unlock
it. Riven mods come in 8 variants, each a specific weapon type; melee, zaw, pistol, kitgun, rifle, shotgun, companion weapon and
archgun. A riven can only be equipped to a weapon of its type. When the riven is unveiled, a random weapon of that type is rolled.
With the weapon comes a minimum of 2, and up to 4 random stats; a maximum of 3 positive stats and a maximum of 1 negative
stat. Fusing the mod will increase these stats, and all rivens cap at 8 fuses.
Q: How do I get them?
A: You get one by finishing TWW, the rest are via Sorties, Archon Hunts, Arbitrations, Events, Twitch Drops, Riven Slivers, Steel Path
Offerings, or trading.
Q: What’s this number at the bottom right of the Riven?
A: The number of times it has been rerolled using kuva.
Q: If I complete a Riven challenge, do I have to finish the mission?
A: No, you can abort the mission and still unveil the Riven if you have completed its challenge.
Q: Does having a negative effect make the positives better?
Q: Does having multiple positives but no negative make them worse?


A: Yes, and yes. Positives and negatives are mixed and make a Riven stronger than another. A riven with 2 positives and 1 negative
gives the strongest positives of that kind, while 3 positives with no negative give the weakest positives of that kind.
Q: My Riven has a higher/lower X than his, is this a bug?
A: Rivens stats are completely random, and fall within a range of possible numbers based on disposition. One riven might get
+101.3% damage and another might get +99.8% damage. This means that it’s virtually impossible to have a Riven that’s exactly the
same as another.
Q: How can I reroll Rivens?
A: Farm kuva from kuva siphon and flood missions, from kuva survival, bounties, and Sorties, and reroll the riven in the mod menu.
Q: Can I continue to reroll it forever or is there a cap?
Q: Does the Kuva scale infinitely?
A: There is no cap to how many times a riven can be rolled. However, the kuva costs will keep increasing until 9 rolls, where it caps
at 3500 kuva.
Q: Can I reroll the weapon they’re for?
A: No, but you can get Riven Transmuters to roll 4 unveiled rivens into a new random veiled riven.
Q: Does the MR lock on the Riven mod do anything?
A: MR requirement is just that, an MR requirement. The riven cannot be equipped until the player who owns it is the MR listed on
the card. The MR requirement on a Riven also raises the base Endo and credit trade-in value.
Q: How do I trade a Riven?
A: Trading Rivens works just like all other trading. The MR requirement on a Riven does not affect tradeability. However, players
cannot receive any type of riven until they are MR8, veiled or otherwise.
Q: If I own a veiled riven and a new weapon shows up, can it roll into the new weapon?
A: No, a veiled riven obtained before a new weapon comes out will not have the new weapon in its roll table.
Q: What are the various stats of the Riven?
A: See the table below. All of these stats can be both positive and negative.
Asterisks show melee exclusive stats.

Q: What are the best stats for a riven?
A: This depends on the weapon and your preferences, but it’s generally agreed upon that damage, multishot, crit chance, and crit
damage are the best. For melee weapons, crit on slide and range are highly sought after as well.
Q: How do I display Rivens in chat?
A: Just type [Riven Mod] to bring up a screen or type the whole name out with brackets [Braton Lexicon]

Trading and Loot
Trading is the act of swapping items and premium currency between players in-game. Trading can be started through the Trade
Chat, a personal message, or some third party sites.
The requirements to trade are being at least MR2, and having access to Maroo’s Bazaar on Mars or a Clan Dojo.
Trading in Warframe is referred to as a Free-Market. This means the developers of the game have no say or influence on the price of
player owned in-game items, besides the ones in the Market. Prices are entirely dictated by the player-base, and will often change
without notice depending on rarity, availability, supply, and demand.
Trade Terms
You’ll need to learn the way the traders talk!

WTS > [Bronco Prime Blueprint] 5p ea
WTB > [Volt Prime] Set PM offers
PC > [Trinity Prime Systems]
/w BestTraderEver How much for that Ash Prime BP?
/w ThatOneTenno WTB your Primed Flow for 50p

As a general rule of thumb, format your posts. You can type them into a browser or Notepad and paste them into the Trade Chat.
The better looking and legible your post, the higher chance someone will notice it. Now that we have chat filters, it is immensely
important that you spell things correctly. For example, if someone has a filter of [Nova Prime] Chassis, then having ‘Nova P Chass’ in
your sale post will not trigger it.
Trading Etiquette
1.
Don’t say WTB Plat, that’s basically saying, “Want to buy money/currency”. Try selling something instead.
2.
If someone offers you something but you don’t like it, say “No” or “No thanks” don’t leave other people waiting. If it seems
decent, try to haggle.
3.
When someone asks for something at a specific price, don’t ask them for offers. They already gave you a price
4.
Don’t spam people if they don’t reply immediately, odds are, they might be in a mission or trading with someone else, or
have decided they’re not interested. Around 3 minutes would be a good time to reask.
5.
Do thank the buyer/seller. At the least, say it in chat.
6.
When buying something, don’t ask multiple people for the same thing, or inform them if you’ve already bought it.
7.
Haggling is fine, but If you’ve settled on a price, don’t try to change it.
8.
If you’re the one hosting a trade, don’t leave the dojo immediately after it’s done. Host Migration errors can sometimes force
restarts and delete traded items (even on your side). Wait for the person to leave first as often as possible.
9.
The seller is the host. He/she will be the one to invite.
10. Do not try to work around other people’s filters. For example, the people that exclude WTB, generally don’t want to buy
anything, so why waste your time trying to sell to them?


11. If you see someone saying PMO or Offers, don’t reply with hm or how much. That goes against the entire point of offers.
Research the item they’re selling, and make them a fair offer.
12. Optional good deed - if you see someone selling something for well below the accepted price, i.e. selling a Primed Mod for
10p, ask them if they know the actual price of the item. If they don’t, tell them the item’s current price. Otherwise you’re
setting them up to get robbed.
Trading
Q: Where do I go to trade?
A: Maroo’s Bazaar (on Mars) or in your Clan Dojo.
Q: What are tradable things?
A: Check this table
Tradeable
Not Tradeable
Relics and Keys
Built Warframes
Arcanes
Built weapons
Mods (except daily reward mods)
Potatoed / Forma’d/leveled Event/Syndicate Weapons
Fish and Gems (not alloys)
Any parts for a non-Prime/specialized Warframe/weapon

Resources not involved with mining or fishing
Prime Parts UNBUILT
Crafted Prime Parts
Prime Blueprints
Cosmetics
Landing Craft Blueprints UNBUILT
Legendary Cores
Ayatan Sculptures and Stars
Captura Backgrounds
Q: Can I trade syndicate syandanas?
A: No, you can only obtain those for syndicates you’ve personally maxed out.
Q: What is trading tax?
A: It’s the tax on the buyer and seller on what they’re trading. It’s usually pretty low, however some clans have a premium tax.


IT IS NOT A HIDDEN FEE, NOR IS IT HACKED IN.
Primed mods and legendary tier items (Legendary Core and Legendary Arcanes) are the only items with 1M tax.
Q: Can you trade across regions?
A: Yes, as long as you can invite them to a Dojo or Maroo’s Bazaar and meet the trade prerequisites (mr2+ & have more than 1 trade)
they can trade with you.
Q: How many trades do I get?
A: You get as many trades as your MR. Your trade count will reset to your MR at the Daily Reset.
Q: How many items can I trade?
A: You can trade up to 6 items per trade instance. Items (except platinum) are not stackable and must be placed one at a time.
Q: Why does this item I’m trying to trade for say MR locked?
A: Many items, particularly Prime parts, are MR locked to players. This means they are not buildable until the player reaches the MR
shown for the item. This also means you cannot receive items that are above your MR level. Note that this only occurs for Prime
blueprints, not the individual parts of the Prime item. For example, if you are MR8, you can receive the stock for Tigris Prime, but not
the Tigris Prime blueprint.
Q: What is this blue text on the screen?
Q: How do I link items?
A: Simply try to type it with brackets [], a small popup will show you what is allowed to be linked.
Q: How do I display Rivens in chat?
A: Just type [Riven Mod] to bring up a screen or type the whole name out with brackets [Braton Lexicon].
Platinum
Q: What is Platinum? And what do I do with it?
A: Platinum is Warframe’s premium in-game currency, which means it can be bought with real life currency and used in game. Its
primary purpose is for purchasing items, equipment, and cosmetics in the Market (it is not recommended to buy items, as all items
and equipment excluding some cosmetics are farmable in game). Platinum can also be traded between players, usually for items
(see Trading above).
Q: Why should I pay money for Plat?
A: Technically you shouldn’t, but if there’s a particular Warframe/weapon/cosmetic/equipment that you want immediately, then you
use Plat for that. Also, since Warframe is free to play and doesn’t run advertisements, buying Plat and premium cosmetics is Digital
Extreme’s primary revenue source. So buying anything directly supports the Devs.


Q: My first 50 Plat is untradeable, what gives?
Q: Why do I have untradable Plat?
A: Any starting Platinum will be untradable. This is to prevent account creation for Plat farming. Most if not all other Plat that you
earn will always be usable for everything, including trading.
Q: What should I use my starting Plat on?
A: Generally, slots, potatoes (orokin reactors / catalysts) then cosmetics in that order. You’ll be able to get more Plat via trading with
others later.
A good choice is 1 Warframe slot (20p) and 2 Weapon slots (12x2=24) Thus equaling 44 Plat.
Here’s a basic priority list
●
Slots (Weapons and Warframe)
●
Potatoes (Get a good set of comfort weapons with potatoes)
●
Color Packs (Some good first palettes are the rest of Classic, Classic Saturated, Tenno, and Orokin)
●
Cosmetics (These are visual changes only and offer no benefit to gameplay)
●
Everything else; Weapons, frames, forma packs, etc.
Q: Should I buy Plat for the game immediately? I’m enjoying the game and I want to help support it.
A: Go ahead and buy, however it’s much better for you to wait for a 50% or 75% discount from the daily login reward. But still, if you
feel the need to contribute, it’s better for the game as a whole. Alternatively, if you do want to support the game, the Prime
Accesses are an option.
Q: How do I “earn” Plat? How do I “farm” Plat?
A: Plat is the in-game premium currency and the only way to get it is to either buy it from DE with real money or trade for it. There is
no way to “farm Plat”, in the strictest sense of the phrase. See Trading for ways to gain Plat through trading.
Q: Should I spend plat on rushing items in the foundry?
A: Short Answer is no. Taking the time and waiting for items to finish building in the foundry is great incentive to take a break and
helps you not get burned out by rushing the game.
A: If you are stretched for time, or are generally impatient, then rush what you think is important.
Resources
Q: Where can I get “x” resource?
A: Every planet has 4 set resources that can drop from enemies on that planet’s nodes.

Q: My booster isn’t doing anything help!
Q: Difference between Resource Booster and Resource Drop Booster?
A: Resource Boosters will always apply a 2x multiplier to whatever resource you get. This includes fishing, mining, and kuva
missions. They do not affect rewards from mission drop tables.
Resource Drop Booster doubles the chance resources will drop from enemies, boxes etc. A Resource Drop booster will not double
kuva. Resource Drop boosters have no noticeable effect on fish or mining point spawns.
Q: I farmed Argon Crystals and they’re suddenly missing. What happened?
A: Argon naturally decays. It basically halves every day. So if you have 12 on the first day, on the second you’ll have 6, then 3 then 2
then 1 then none.
Q: Where’s the best place to farm x?
A: Generally the answer will always be the Dark Sector of the planet you need the resource of, and if it doesn’t have any, just do a
survival.


Q: What are ducats?
A: Ducats are another form of currency in the game, however you can only use them with Baro Ki’Teer, the Void Trader. You get
ducats from going to the relays and trading Prime parts in for them at the Ducat Kiosk on either side of the central aisle.
Q: What is Aya?
A: Aya is a rare resource gained as a mission/bounty reward, it can be traded to Prime Warframe and Weapon Relics from Varzia in
Maroo's Bazaar.
Q: Can Kavats increase the amount of Kuva you get?
A: Yes, but only the Smeeta Kavat breed with the Charm mod has a chance to double the Kuva you receive.
Void Relics
Void Relics are special, upgradeable containers that can be found throughout the Star Chart. They predominantly drop Prime
Warframe and Weapon parts, but can also drop Forma blueprints.
Q: Where do I find relics?
A: Relics are a common drop on most endless missions. Relic packs can also be bought from the Market and from all 6 main
Syndicates. Relics can also be traded between players.
Q: What does it mean for parts to be common and rare?
A: Every relic contains 3 common parts (bronze), 2 uncommon parts (silver), and 1 rare part (gold). Common parts have a high
chance of dropping, uncommon have a moderately-low chance of dropping, and rare parts have a low chance of dropping.
Q: What does refining a relic mean?
A: When doing Void missions, you collect Void Traces from dead Corrupted enemies. You can use these Traces to refine a Void relic
and increase the chances of getting uncommon and rare drops, while decreasing the chances for getting common drops. It takes 25
Traces for an Exceptional relic, 50 for a Flawless, and 100 for a Radiant.

Factions
Friendly Factions
There are a number of factions and people willing to help you on your journey through the Solar System. These can include the
factions listed below, however Syndicates can be friend or foe, and aren’t included here..
Tenno
The Tenno are you, the Warframes, under the care and guidance of the Lotus. It is your privilege and your burden to keep the
balance of power in the Origin system.
Cephalon Simaris
Cephalon Simaris is a Cephalon construct that resides within the Sanctuary Enclave, a room found in all Tenno Relays. A seeker of
knowledge, his ultimate goal is to "immortalize" creatures through the process known as Synthesis, that deconstructs a being into
data for storage within the Sanctuary. Talk with Simaris
Ostron
The hardy people of the Plains of Eidolon, they’ve made a community in the shadow of an abandoned Orokin tower and called it
Cetus. They ask you for assistance in their constant struggle against the Grineer. Talk with Konzu.
Quills
Led by Quill Onkko, the Quills study the sentients who still roam the Plains. Onkko seeks your fighting prowess in getting closer to
these dangerous beings. Talk with Onkko.
Solaris United
The people of Fortuna are forever enslaved in debt to their Corpus overlords. The Solaris United have banded together to push
back. These cybernetically modified rebels request your help in furthering their cause. Talk with Eudico.
Vox Solaris
Where Solaris United is the face of the rebellion, Vox Solaris is the hidden, anonymous personnel group that handles the
underground dealings and shady operations. Their true purpose is yet to be revealed. Talk with Little Duck.


Entrati
The Entrati are an elusive family that reside inside the enclave of Necralisk, on Deimos. They were highly renowned during the
Orokin Era for being the first ones to create technologies that harnessed the power of the Void. Today, the sole survivors of the clan
are a single dysfunctional household that dwells on the Cambion Drift. Talk with Mother
Necraloid
Necraloids are Entrati machines operated by Cephalons, serving as loyal servants to the Entrati family. To fully access this
Syndicate, the player must complete the Heart of Deimos quest and The War Within. Talk with Loid.
The Holdfasts (SPOILERS)
The Holdfasts are the four last survivors of the adult crew of the Zariman Ten Zero and conducting their operations within the
Chrysalith. Returned to life by the mysterious powers of the Void, they have fought off conversion into Void Angels. While not
strictly human anymore, instead being Void manifestations resurrected through the Conceptual Embodiment of the memories of the
original Zariman Crew, they retain their human mindset and guide the Tenno in preventing the further degradation of the Zariman.
Speak with Quinn.
Khal’s Garrison
Kahl's Garrison is a resistance movement that fights against Narmer. Led by Kahl-175 with the support of Daughter and the Tenno,
he sets up his base at the Drifter's Camp, preparing a campaign to free his Grineer brothers and the Origin System from Narmer.
Speak with Khal.
NPC
There are a number of friendly NPCs throughout the game that provide the Tenno with different forms of aid or services.
●
The Lotus - A mysterious being who guides Tenno on their journey.
●
Ordis - A Cephalon who assists in ship and mission operations.
●
Darvo - A Corpus rebel who resides in Relays. He sells various items for Platinum at a discount from Market cost.
●
Baro Ki’Teer - Known as the Void Trader, he appears every 2 weeks on a Friday with a large selection of items to buy for
Ducats and/or credits. He is the only in-game purveyor of Primed Mods and Prisma Weapons.
●
Maroo - A shady thief who has a heavy interest in Ayatan artifacts. She will buy your Ayatan Treasures for Endo.
●
Clem - One of Darvo’s connections, he is an undercover soldier who spies on the Grineer. Will give you unique missions.
●
Nora Night - Host of the Nightwave radio station.
Enemy Factions
The Solar System is awash with large, dangerous, fanatical groups that all want to see the Tenno as a long forgotten memory.


Grineer
The Grineer are a vast army of genetically modified, cloned humans, who are plagued by debilitating defects from over extension of
DNA. They are born and raised into fanatical dedication to the two Grineer Queens, and wish to exploit Warframes as
superweapons. They use mass produced, simple but deadly weaponry, and have heavy armor that can block the majority of damage
they receive. Grineer never use proto-shields. Recommended to use puncture and corrosive damage types.
Enemies to Prioritize
●
Heavy Gunner - High armor, high health, high damage.
●
Hyekka Master - Very high armor, high health, can spawn up to 4 Hyekkas.
●
Bombard - Very high armor and health, fires homing rockets.
●
Napalm - Very high armor and health, fires incendiary grenades that leave a burning orb on impact.
●
Manic - High armor and health, can teleport and ignore damage, very high damage melee attacks.
●
Nox - Extremely high armor and health, wields a sticky grenade launcher that applies toxin and cold procs. Only weak spot is
its head, which is protected by a fortified glass helmet. Breaking the helmet releases the noxious gasses within.
●
Prosecutor - The Grineer specialty unit, with very high health and the only unit with a shield. There are 4 types of prosecutors,
each one uses a specific elemental shield, of heat, cold, toxin, or electricity. Whichever element the shield is is the only
damage type that will hurt them.

Comba/Scrambus - These units are taller than regular crewman, and have specialized hover shoes allowing them to move
very fast. They have an aura around their helmets that disrupt Warframe abilities and HUD.
●
Shield Osprey - A flying support unit, this osprey will regenerate nearby allies’ shields very quickly. Take out this unit before
engaging the rest.
●
Bursa - The Corpus specialty unit, there are three types of bursas, which are a heavy defensive proxy. Each one sits low to the
ground, and has a shield equipped to its front which negates all damage. It can only be damaged reliably from the back.
Once it is disabled, you can hack the console on its back and have it fight for you.

Infested
The Infested are the remains of Corpus, Grineer, and other biological organisms that have been infected by the Technocyte Virus, a
pathogen that wiped out the ancient Orokin civilization. The Technocyte is a hive mind, and relentlessly attacks anything that
invades its spawning nests. Nearly every unit attacks exclusively with melee, though a few units have ranged attacks. Infested units
have very high health, rarely armor, and never have proto shields. They are weak to slash, puncture, heat, corrosive, and gas
damage.
Enemies to Prioritize
●
Volatile Runner - An orange Corpus crewman shaped infested that will charge you and explode in a suicide bomb style.
●
Swarm Mutalist Moa - A blue and purple Corpus proxy shaped infested that launches swarms of infested spores that cause
minor damage and reduce invisibility. Any infested units that hit the spores gain armor.
●
Tar Mutalist Moa - A blue, red, and purple Corpus proxy shaped infested that launches globs of bright yellow mucus, that
slows you down and causes heavy damage when in contact.
●
Ancient - A heavy infested melee unit, it comes in three types; healer, disruptor, and toxic. The healer (green) provides
damage resistance to allies, the disruptor (dark green and pink) drains your Warframe’s energy, and the toxic (dark green
and neon green) creates toxic clouds that deal heavy damage and buffs allies’ toxin damage.


●
Juggernaut - The infested specialty unit, and arguably the most dangerous unit in the game. It is a quadruped infested tank,
with armor so high that any damage done to the exterior does zero damage. It has high damage ranged and charge attacks.
The only way it can be damaged is when it rears up on its hind legs. Its stomach is its weak point.

Corrupted/Orokin
The Corrupted are the remnants of the ancient Orokin civilization. They are brainwashed, augmented forms of Corpus, Grineer, and
Infested units, roaming the abandoned halls of Orokin towers, protecting that which they were programmed to. And they will
defend their masters’ homes savagely.
All corrupted act like their normal counterparts, but are upgraded with higher health, armor, and shields. Their weapons are also
upgraded to Orokin Prime energy weapons. Each unit is still susceptible to their faction’s weaknesses. Corrupted units can only be
encountered in the Void, or Void Fissure missions.
Recommended to target the same enemy types of their original faction.
The only Corrupted controlled area is The Void.
Sentients (SPOILERS)
The Sentients are ancient beings that were a large part of the destruction of the Orokin Empire. They have several variants, and all
have either damage resistance or damage adaptation. They can be encountered on the Plains of Eidolon, Uranus, and Lua. Some
Sentients include the Oculysts, Battalysts, Eidolons and the Shadow Stalker.
Amalgams (SPOILERS)
The Amalgams are a hybrid of Corpus and Sentient Technology, developed by Alad V. They employ mixed attacks similar to their
Corpus and Sentient counterparts. Amalgams can only be found on Jupiter. They are susceptible to corrosive, radiation, and
magnetic attacks.
Syndicates
Syndicates are Factions that can be joined by the Tenno, and provide unique purchasable rewards. There are 6 main Syndicates,
each with their own goals, friends, and enemies. Each Syndicate considers 3 other Syndicates as Allied, Opposed, or Enemy. The 2
remaining are neutral.


A Syndicate’s standing is based on Reputation, and each Syndicate has their own Reputation ranking system. You can join as many
Syndicates as you’d like, but keep in mind that if a Syndicate is Opposed or an Enemy with another, then gaining Reputation with
that Syndicate will lose Reputation in the other. If your Reputation with a Syndicate drops below 0, you become an Enemy to them
and they will periodically send out hit squads to kill you in missions, much like Assassins.
To advance in a Syndicate, you must max out Reputation with each of the 5 levels. You gain reputation by equipping the chosen
Syndicate’s sigil to your Warframe. Only one sigil may be equipped on a Warframe at a time. A portion of the affinity you earn will
then be converted into Reputation. Each level will require an offering to advance. These offerings range from credits, resources,
potatoes, and Prime parts. Each level unlocks more rewards from that Syndicate’s reward table.
Steel Meridian
The Steel Meridian are made up of deserters and opposers to the Grineer Regime. They constantly fight a guerilla war against them,
and are sworn protectors of the few colonies that still survive on Earth.
Arbiters of Hexis
The Arbiters of Hexis are a disciplined, dogmatic, ruthless cult of warriors and clerics who seek justice and order in the Origin
System. They see the Tenno as the ultimate key to this goal.
Cephalon Suda
Suda is one of the ancient artificial intelligences created during the Great War, a Cephalon. She despises violence and destruction,
and her thirst for knowledge is unparalleled. She finds the Tenno intriguing.
The Perrin Sequence
The Perrin Sequence are a splinter group of brilliant and powerful merchants, who shun the Corpus to further their own goals. They
wish to bring prosperity and direction to the Origin System.
Red Veil
The Red Veil are an organization dedicated to destruction. They see mass corruption all around them, and wish to heal the system
through a great and violent purge. Bound by honor to their cause, they do not regard life as precious, but as an obstacle.
New Loka
New Loka are worshipers of the Human life and what it once was. They wish to see the restoration of humanity and the
repopulation of Earth. Their belief is that humanity will rise once again and end the age long conflict that plagues the Origin
System.

Because of these Alignments, it is recommended to ally with 3 Syndicates, the 3 on the left of the menu, or the 3 on the right, for
ease of use.
Q: What do syndicates do?
A: Syndicates allow Tenno access to their reward lists, which include important things like Warframe/weapon augment mods, gear
consumables, relic packs, Archwing weapon parts, Spectres, unique Syndicate weapons, Captura scenes, and more.
Q: Can I trade syndicate syandanas?
A: No, you can only obtain those for syndicates you’ve personally maxxed out.
Q: If I drop below my rank after paying tribute, do I still have to pay tribute again?
A: Yes, if you lose a rank then you will have to pay tribute to get it back.
Q: Which is the best syndicate? What syndicate do I choose?
A: That’s subjective, choose which one you like the most, or which one you like the rewards for most.
Q: How many syndicates can I max?
A: 6, however that takes intense micromanagement. 4 is the easiest to max without extreme effort. The combinations are as
follows:
Steel Meridian, Cephalon Suda, Arbiters of Hexis and Red Veil
or
Red Veil, New Loka, Steel Meridian and Perrin Sequence
(Bolded are the ones most used to retain 4)
Keep the SM/RV sigil and do CS/NL missions respectively.
Q: Is there any downside to getting Syndicates mad/angry/negative?
A: The slighted Syndicate will occasionally send Death Squads after you, similar to Assassins. You can tell which Syndicate is
attacking from flickering lights and a message from the attacking Syndicate. You also don’t have access to their rewards.


Q: What’s the difference of the “x Squad” vs the “x Platoon”?
A: Just numbers, usually the squad has 3-5, while the Platoon has 5-8.
Q: I joined this syndicate, but the other one has the mod I want. Can I switch over?
A: Anytime. Just pay the tribute and advance to the other goal. Alternatively you can just trade for the mod.
Q: If I reach my daily standing cap and do a Syndicate mission do I get more standing?
A: Yes. Syndicate missions reward standing regardless of your cap.
Q: What do Insignia / Seed / Quittance / Datum / Medallion / Mark do?
Q: What do Defender Insignia / Bountiful Seed / Executive Quittance / Intriguing Datum / Lawful Medallion / Honored Mark do?
Q: What do General Insignia / Flawless Seed / Partner Quittance / Genius Datum / Maxim Medallion / Exalted Mark do?
Q: How do I find them? How do I get them?
A: Collectively, they’re called Syndicate Medallions, and they can be redeemed at any non Earth relay at their respective Syndicates
for standing in their particular syndicate. You can get them by doing Syndicate missions, they usually spawn 8 per mission.
Q: How do I start earning standing with my Syndicate?
A: Just to the right of the Navigation is a menu you can interact with to select a Syndicate, from there you can pledge yourself to the
syndicate you choose, A percent of affinity you gain during missions goes towards ranking up your chosen Syndicate. You can
change at anytime.
Q: Why did my Syndicate weapon suddenly explode?
A: All Syndicate weapons, and weapons that can be upgraded with a Syndicate mod, have what is called a Syndicate Radial Effect.
Each effect gives buffs and damage depending on the Syndicate the weapon/mod is from. To gain the effect, you must gain affinity
with the weapon that will then be converted into points and fill a gauge in the lower right hand of your HUD. Once the weapon’s
gauge is filled, usually 1,000 points, the effect will be released and the gauge reset.

Field Bosses (Assassins)
A Field Boss is a specialized enemy that can randomly appear in any standard mission, similar to Syndicate Death Squads (mission
exceptions are Syndicate missions, Archwing missions, Free Roam missions, Arenas, (Elite) Sanctuary Onslaught, and
Assassinations). Assassins appear with the sole intent of killing their target. Even if you have others in a squad, an Assassin will only
attack its target, unlike Syndicate Death Squads which attack everyone. You can check which Assassin is after you on the front page
of your Profile, in the Marked for Death section.
Shadow Stalker
The Shadow Stalker is the most common Assassin. He will occasionally mark you for death after completing any Assassination
mission, of any faction. This appears as a message in your Inbox. Once marked for death, the Stalker has a chance to appear on any
mission node or type at any time.
The Stalker appears as a modified dark grey and orange Excalibur, wielding a greatsword. He attacks similarly to Excalibur as well.
Similar to Sentients, the Stalker gains resistance to damage as it is received. Switch up your tactics as you take him down. If the
Stalker succeeds in defeating his target, he will disappear without dropping any rewards and the defeated player will need to be
revived.
The Stalker has a chance of dropping a number of powerful weapons, mods, landing craft parts, and resources.
Zanuka Hunter
The Zanuka is a proxy controlled by Alad V. It is an Assassin whose death mark appears after completing 5 Invasions against the
Corpus in a row. It will only appear in missions where you are fighting the Corpus.
The Zanuka appears as a grey, medium sized proxy similar in size to a Hyena, but smaller than a Jackal. It employs an automatic
plasma gun and a frost bomb, along with melee attacks.
Should the Zanuka Hunter damage its target enough, it will pounce upon its victim and transport them to a holding facility, where a
hidden mini-mission will begin. You must escape Alad V’s facility and recover your confiscated equipment.
The Zanuka has a chance of dropping Detron blueprints and parts, Orokin cells, and landing craft parts.


Grustrag Three
The Grustrag Three are a team of enhanced, insane Grineer super-soldiers. They are an Assassin whose death mark appears after
completing 5 Invasions against the Grineer in a row. They will only appear in missions where you are fighting the Grineer.
The Three appear as large Grineer Marines, with streamlined armor and open helmets. They each employ different fighting tactics.
●
Leekter carries a large axe and flashbangs
●
Shik Talk uses a handheld rocket launcher and a riot shield
●
Vem Tabook carries a shotgun that fires electro-traps
Each of the Three also has a Carabus Sentinel, armed with a laser rifle.
Should the Three succeed in defeating their target, their Sentinels will form a shield around the victim, preventing team revives. A
Grustrag Bolt will then be attached to the victim’s Warframe. The Bolt reduces that frame’s damage against Grineer by 50%. A
blueprint for a Bolt Release will be in the victim’s inventory upon leaving the mission.
The Grustrag Three have a chance of dropping rare mods, Brakk blueprints and parts, Endo, and landing craft parts.
The Wolf of Saturn Six
The Wolf is the most powerful of the inmates to escape the maximum security Grineer prison, Saturn Six. He led the uprising that
released himself and his inmates on the Origin System. He became available to encounter during Series 1 of Nightwave.
The Wolf appears as a very large Grineer individual, similar in look to one of the Grustrag Three, but with different armor. He wields
his Wolf Sledge, and primarily uses melee attacks. He can also attack with energy projectiles similar to that of Excalibur’s Exalted
Blade, and will occasionally perform a spin attack that pulls any nearby Warframes to him.
The Wolf has an extremely high amount of health and Alloy armor. He is also completely immune to Status effects and Warframe
abilities. It is recommended to keep distance from him, and to use weapons with high puncture and radiation damage.
The Wolf can appear in any player-based mission, and does not require or have a death mark associated with him. His arrival is
preceded by the standard flashing lights and a wolf-like howl. In addition, if another Assassin has already appeared or is set to
appear in a mission, The Wolf will not spawn.
Acolytes (Steel Path)
Acolytes spawn in any non-archwing and non-assassination Steel Path missions, Acolytes can spawn in 3-7 minute intervals, This
includes non-endless missions, in non-endless missions a max of 3 Acolytes spawn.


Acolytes have quite a lot of Health and Shields with some Armor, They are only able to receive up to 4 stacks of any status effect
(Except Impact which can stack to 6) and Radiation only amplifies the damage the Acolyte receives but does not enable friendly fire,
Acolytes also have a mechanic which lowers your damage the higher your damage per second is, so high damage weapons such as
DMRs and Snipers are normally better against them, They also get a 40% damage resistance from the start.
Acolytes resemble different warframes, Angst is a modified Valkyr, Malice is a modified Frost, Mania is a modified Loki, Misery is a
modified Oberon, Torment is a modified Mesa and Violence is a modified Limbo.
Acolytes drop 2 Steel Essence and one random Primary or Secondary Arcane upon defeat.
Kuva Liches
Kuva Liches are Grineer Assassin enemies that are unique to the player who created them. They are very powerful, and are designed
to be a challenge for mid to end game players. Only players who have finished The War Within quest can spawn a Lich. They are
defeated through solving an icon puzzle and trial and error.
Its menu, upon creation, is in the lower right corner of the Menu or Navigation UI, next to the Nightwave/Resource box. You are only
able to have Either a Sister or a Liche, not both.
The Parazon
The Parazon is a unique gear item that is given to players during the tutorial of the game. It is always automatically equipped in all
missions. It can be found and altered in the Arsenal section of your Orbiter. It can hold up to 3 mods that give bonuses to hacking
and mercy kills. Mercy kills can be performed on any regular enemy with the activate button (default [X]) once their health is almost
depleted. They are similar to sneak attacks, however a mercy kill will always instantly kill the enemy. The Parazon also holds up to 3
Requiem Mods, which are required to kill Kuva Liches and Sisters of Parvos.


Requiem Mods and Relics
Requiem Mods are 8 unique mods that can only be slotted into the Parazon. They are obtained from Requiem Relics. Requiem
Relics have a chance to drop from Lich Thralls, Sister Hounds and Kuva Siphons, and are a guaranteed drop from Kuva Floods. They
are opened similarly to Prime Relics, on select Kuva Fortress missions. They can be refined like normal relics as well. Requiem Relics
drop the Requiem Mods (Which are always an uncommon drop), as well as Riven Slivers, Kuva, Ayatan Amber Stars, and Exilus
Adapter blueprints.
There is also a 9th Requiem Mod, Oull, It is able to act as ANY Requiem mod, meaning if you put it into the first slot, that slot is now
going to be correct, it doesn’t matter what is required. Oull has a drop chance of 25% when the Kuva Lich or Sisters of Parvos flees
after using the correct Requiem Sequence. This Requiem only drops for the person whose Lich/Sister is downed.
Lich Larvlings
Lich Larvlings have a chance to spawn on any level 20+ Grineer mission. They are marked by a unique red icon, and are preceded by
yellow flashing lights. Damaging them completely then mercy killing them with the Parazon will create a Lich. If in a party, only the
player who lands the final blow on the larvling will have the option to mercy kill it.


Lich Thralls
In your Lich's influenced zones, Lich Thralls will have a chance to spawn. 3-15 can spawn depending on the mission type, with longer
missions spawning more. They can be damaged as normal, but will not die upon losing all their health. Instead they will drop to a
knee, allowing you to mercy kill them with the Parazon. If not mercy killed, they will remain on the map indefinitely until the mission
ends. Upon death, the Thrall will provide a Requiem Murmur, which is needed to discover which Requiem Mod is needed to kill your
Lich. Kuva Thralls have a 5% chance to drop a Requiem Relic upon death.

Depending on the Warframe used to kill the Kuva Larvling, the subsequent Lich will have modified stats. It will have randomized
resistances and weaknesses, and the Kuva weapon they wield will gain an elemental stat bonus, from 25-60%, that corresponds to
the Warframe used to kill the larvling. The Lich will also gain visual attributes based on the chosen Warframe, namely that
Warframe's helmet mounted on the Lich's shoulder pauldron.
Kuva Weapons
There are 19 unique Kuva weapons, majority a variant of an existing Grineer weapon. They level similarly to the Paracesis, in that
they are mastered at level 40 as opposed to level 30. The additional levels are gained through Forma, with each added raising the
weapon's max level by 2, until reaching 40 (5 total Forma required). Each level will give 100 mastery points as normal, with the
weapon providing a max of 4,000 mastery points.


Fighting the Kuva Lich
Once you have a Lich created, it will have a chance to appear like other Assassin enemies, and is preceded by yellow flashing lights.
However, it can only appear in Lich controlled missions.
The Kuva Lich has 4 damage bars, one shield and 3 health. Once the shield is depleted, the first damage bar (right side) can be
drained. Once a damage bar is completely drained, the Lich will go to one knee and start rapidly regaining health. The player who
the Lich belongs to must attempt to mercy kill the Lich during this phase, else the Lich will rise again with that damage bar
replenished, and will have to be fought again. If the player has the correct Requiem Mod slotted into their Parazon, the Lich will
stand back up and the next damage bar can be attacked. If the player has the incorrect Requiem Mod, then the Lich will flee and
Level up.
To defeat their Lich, the player must get all 3 Requiem Mods correct, in order. Each time the player is killed by their Lich, a log will
be recorded in the Lich Menu of which Mods were used, and which one failed. If for instance the first mod was incorrect, it will be
highlighted red with a slash through it. If a mod was not tested, it will be grey. If a mod succeeded, it would be gold. Through trial
and error, a player can discover the correct mods and their order simply by getting killed by their Lich. However, the correct mods
can be discovered quicker.
By killing Thralls, players will receive Requiem Murmurs. Gaining 130 murmurs in 3 stages will reveal all 3 required Requiem Mods
to kill the Lich. The first stage requires 30 murmurs, the second another 30, and the third 70. The mods will not be given in the
correct order though, that has to be tested and found by the player through combat with their Lich.
Each time a player fails to defeat their Lich, it will level up, gaining increased damage and health, and increases the level of enemies
on influenced nodes. The Lich maxes out at level 5. Lich missions start at level 55 and max out at level 110. It will also spread their
influence to an adjacent planet, and their rage level will increase. The higher a Lich's rage level, the more likely it is to spawn in a
mission. The rage levels are Indifferent - Annoyed - Fuming - Furious - Enraged.
Upon completion of a Lich influenced mission, the player's Lich will steal some of the player's loot. This is random, and can include
up to 50% of resources and credits, mods, items, blueprints, and rewards. Upon defeat, the Kuva Lich will reward the player with all
stolen loot up to that point.
It should be noted that if in a party, only one member of the group has to have the selected mission be influenced by their Lich for it
to become an influenced node for the entire party. Killing a Thrall will provide a murmur to each player, and any of the player's
Liches have a chance to spawn.
Once you have correctly put all 3 Requiem mods in the right order and attempt to kill your Lich, it will flee one last time but not
increase in Level, You are required enter your railjack and find the node with the Lich on it, It will be marked on the Navigation


Menu, once you start the mission you are tasked to kill your Lich one last time. If you are in a group you are tasked to kill all active
Liches in the group.
When Lich has been completely defeated, players have two options. They can either Vanquish or Convert it. Vanquishing the Lich
awards the player with the Lich's Kuva weapon and all stolen loot. Converting the Lich awards the player with all the stolen loot,
and gives it the chance to appear in missions as an ally. PLayers will not be awarded the Kuva weapon if the Lich is converted.
Sisters of Parvos
Sisters of Parvos are Corpus Super Soldiers that are unique to the player who created them, very similar to Kuva Liches. They are
very powerful, and are designed to be a challenge for mid to end game players. Only players who have finished The War Within and
Call of the Tempestarii quests can spawn a Sister. They are defeated through solving an icon puzzle and trial and error.
Its menu, upon creation, is in the lower right corner of the Menu or Navigation UI, next to the Nightwave/Resource box. You are only
able to have Either a Sister or a Lich, not both.
The Parazon
The Parazon is a unique gear item that is given to players during the tutorial of the game. It is always automatically equipped in all
missions. It can be found and altered in the Arsenal section of your Orbiter. It can hold up to 3 mods that give bonuses to hacking
and mercy kills. Mercy kills can be performed on any regular enemy with the activate button (default [X]) once their health is almost
depleted. They are similar to sneak attacks, however a mercy kill will always instantly kill the enemy. The Parazon also holds up to 3
Requiem Mods, which are required to kill Kuva Liches and Sisters of Parvos.


Requiem Mods and Relics
Requiem Mods are 8 unique mods that can only be slotted into the Parazon. They are obtained from Requiem Relics. Requiem
Relics have a chance to drop from Lich Thralls and Kuva Siphons, Sister Hounds, and are a guaranteed drop from Kuva Floods. They
are opened similarly to Prime Relics, on select Kuva Fortress missions. They can be refined like normal relics as well. Requiem Relics
drop the Requiem Mods (Which are always an uncommon drop), as well as Riven Slivers, Kuva, Ayatan Amber Stars, and Exilus
Adapter blueprints.
There is also a 9th Requiem Mod, Oull, It is able to act as ANY Requiem mod, meaning if you put it into the first slot, that slot is now
going to be correct, it doesn’t matter what is required. Oull has a drop chance of 25% when the Kuva Lich or Sisters of Parvos flees
after using the correct Requiem Sequence. This Requiem only drops for the person whose Lich/Sister is downed.
Sister Candidate
After the completion of The War Within and Call of the Tempestarii quests, the player may encounter a Candidate after completing
the Granum Void in any Corpus Ship tileset while qualifying for Rank 1 rewards of Nightmare Difficulty (using a Zenith Granum
Crown; not to be confused with Nightmare Mode which is a different mission modifier).


To enter the Granum Void, players are required to gain a Granum Crown, the quest The Deadlock Protocol has to be completed in
order to gain the Crowns, in missions with the Corpus Ship Tileset an enemy named The Treasurer will spawn within 2-4 minutes in
non-endless missions and 5-8 minutes in endless missions, The Treasurer will only spawn once per mission and the Crown type is
depending on the level of the mission, to gain a Zenith Granum Crown for the Sister Candidate the mission has to be a level 31+.
By choosing to kill the Sister Candidate with a Parazon Mercy kill, the player causes a Sister to rise in the Origin System, thus
becoming the Progenitor of that Sister, and the Warframe used for this is recognized as the Progenitor Warframe. In a squad, only
the last player who damaged the Candidate may perform the Mercy kill. If no one takes the mercy action, the Candidate will
despawn after 30 seconds. This does not interrupt the normal course of the mission. Upon return to the Orbiter, regardless of
whether the mission was completed or aborted, the player will receive communications from the newly created Sister. The Sister's
profile can be accessed from either the Orbiter's Navigation console, or on the Main Menu, through a banner on the lower right
corner of the screen.
When the player is within Mercy distance, the downed Candidate will display an icon and name of the Tenet Weapon the created
Sister will wield. The displayed weapon is always random, meaning players can run a mission multiple times before Mercy killing
her with their weapon of choice. If the Candidate is ignored, the displayed weapon will not show up again for any subsequent
Candidates (only if the mission is finished properly) until the entire weapon pool is rejected.
Mechanized Hounds
In your Sister’s influenced zones, Mechanized Hounds will have a chance to spawn. 3 can spawn in a single mission. They can be
damaged as normal, but will not die upon losing all their health. Instead they are opened to parazon finishers, allowing you to
mercy kill them. If not mercy killed, they will remain on the map indefinitely until the mission ends. Upon death, the Hound will
provide a Requiem Murmur, which is needed to discover which Requiem Mod is needed to kill your Sister. Mechanized Hounds have
a 5% chance to drop a Requiem Relic upon death.

highlighted red with a slash through it. If a mod was not tested, it will be gray. If a mod succeeded, it would be gold. Through trial
and error, a player can discover the correct mods and their order simply by getting killed by their Sister . However, the correct mods
can be discovered quicker.
By killing Hounds, players will receive Requiem Murmurs. Gaining 130 murmurs in 3 stages will reveal all 3 required Requiem Mods
to kill the Sister. The first stage requires 30 murmurs, the second another 30, and the third 70. The mods will not be given in the
correct order though, that has to be tested and found by the player through combat with their Sister.


Each time a player fails an attempt to kill their Sister, it will level up, gaining increased damage and health, and increases the level
of enemies on influenced nodes. The Sister maxes out at level 5. Sister missions start at level 55 and max out at level 110. It will also
spread their influence to an adjacent planet, and their rage level will increase. The higher a Sister’s rage level, the more likely it is to
spawn in a mission. The rage levels are Indifferent - Annoyed - Fuming - Furious - Enraged.
Upon completion of a Sister influenced mission, the player's Sister will steal some of the player's loot. This is random, and can
include up to 50% of resources and credits, mods, items, blueprints, and rewards. Upon defeat, the Sister of Parvos will reward the
player with all stolen loot up to that point.
It should be noted that if in a party, only one member of the group has to have the selected mission be influenced by their Sister for
it to become an influenced node for the entire party. Killing a Hound will provide a murmur to each player, and any of the player's
Sistershave a chance to spawn.
Once you have correctly put all 3 Requiem mods in the right order and attempt to kill your Sister, it will flee one last time but not
increase in Level, You are required enter your railjack and find the node with the Sister on it, It will be marked on the Navigation
Menu, once you start the mission you are tasked to kill your Sister one last time. If you are in a group you are tasked to kill all active
Sisters in the group.
When Sister has been completely defeated, players have two options. They can either Vanquish or Convert it. Vanquishing the Lich
awards the player with the Sister’s Tenet weapon and all stolen loot. Converting the Sister awards the player with all the stolen
loot, and gives it the chance to appear in missions as an ally. PLayers will not be awarded the Tenet weapon if the Sister is
converted.
Relays
Throughout the Star Map exists Relays, friendly outposts that all Tenno can utilize. They appear as a mission node, and must have
all missions completed for it to be accessible.
Current Relays
●
Strata, Earth
●
Larunda, Mercury
●
Kronia, Saturn
●
Orcus, Pluto
Unique Relays
●
Maroo’s Bazaar, Mars


Destroyed Relays
●
Vesper, Venus
●
Leonov, Europa
●
Kuiper, Eris
*These relays pertain to the PC version of Warframe, not the console versions.
Maroo’s Bazaar is where you go to turn Ayatan Treasures into Endo. It is also a public trading hub, but doesn’t contain any elements
of other relays.
Relays are destroyed when a Razorback Armada or Balor Fomorian are not defeated.
Each Relay has a number of NPCs, interactables, and locations within them. These include Syndicate NPCs, where you can trade in
Syndicate Medallions for Standing, Darvo and Clem, Cephalon Simaris’ Sanctuary (which includes the Simulacrum), the Conclave
Access, a Navigation room, and Ducat trading posts. Every existing Relay (besides the Bazaar) can be visited by Baro Ki’Teer on his
biweekly visit. Tenno cannot trade with each other in Relays (besides the Bazaar).
Clans, Dojos, and Alliances
Clans
A clan is a foundable group in-game that any player can join. All clans have a Clan Dojo with many useful rooms that can be built.
Clans also contain the Trading Hub, allowing for trades to be done with anyone in the Dojo.
The Research Labs only exist in Dojos, where over 180 weapon, Warframe, and equipment blueprints can be purchased. These
blueprints must be researched using resources, which any clan member can donate.
Labs
●
Tenno Lab - Allows for research of Warframes and Tenno-based weaponry.
●
Energy Lab - Allows for research of energy and Corpus-based weaponry.
●
Chem Lab - Allows for research of firearm and Grineer-based weaponry.
●
Bio Lab - Allows for research of elemental and Infested-based weaponry.
●
Orokin Lab - Contains the Dragon Keys and Solar Rail parts (Solar Rails are discontinued).
To start a clan, go to the Clan Tab in the Communication Menu. To join a clan, a member of an already established clan with the
Recruiter permission sends an invite to your inbox. Ask in Recruiting Chat or on forums to find the right clan for you.


Clan leaders have the ability to create and submit a unique clan emblem. This emblem can then be equipped on your Warframes
and companions, in the Regalia section of the Appearance tab.
Note that DE does not interfere with Clan affairs, all activity happens between Clan members and staff.
There are 5 capacity levels for Clans, each one affecting maximum member count and research costs.
●
Ghost: All clans start at this level, have a max member count of 10, and have the lowest research cost.
●
Shadow: Max member count of 30, has 3x the research cost of a Ghost.
●
Storm: Max member count of 100, has 10x the research cost of a Ghost.
●
Mountain: Max member count of 300, has 30x the research cost of a Ghost.
●
Moon: Max member count of 1,000, has 100x the research cost of a Ghost.
It is highly recommended to finish the research for a new clan while in the Ghost or Shadow sizes, as obtaining resources at higher
Clan levels is extremely expensive.
A Clan can have up to 9 unique Hierarchies, with each one having access to 12 roles. The Hierarchy names and roles can be
customized by the Clan Founder, or those with the Ruler role.
Clan Roles
●
Ruler - Can add/remove permissions of others.
●
Recruiter - Can invite people to the clan.
●
Regulator - Can kick members from the clan.
●
Promotor - Can promote members up to their own rank or below.
●
Architect - Can add new rooms to the Dojo.
●
Dojo Decorator - Can add new decorations to rooms in the Dojo.
●
Treasurer - Can use the Clan Vault and change the Clan Tax.
●
Tech - Can start a research project in labs.
●
Tactician - Can start research of Solar Rails and deploy them (currently discontinued).
●
Chat Moderator - Can kick or suspend members from clan chat.
●
Herald - Can edit the Message of the Day (MOTD) for the clan.
●
Fabricator - Can purchase blueprints from clan labs.
The Clan Vault is a buildable decoration that allows any member to donate credits, resources, or decorations to be used in research
projects or building projects. Anything put in the Vault cannot be refunded, and cannot be used for any player’s personal needs.
The Clan tax is a secondary trade tax that can be employed. Any credits gained from the Clan Tax in a trade go into the Clan Vault.
The Clan Tax can be 0-100% of the regular trade tax.


As Clan Chat is the only available chat medium for a Clan, many Clans use third party sites for communication. The most popular of
these is Discord. It is common for Clans who are recruiting to require a member to also have a Discord account.
Alliances
An Alliance is a group of clans. Alliances used to be able to battle each other using Solar Rails to try to win Dark Sector Missions,
but that feature has since been removed. Currently the only benefits to being in an Alliance is access to the Alliance Chat, and the
ability to donate resources to other allied clans. Alliances are created as large communities for players to access and socialize in.
Creation of an Alliance is done in the Clan Menu. Like Clans, Alliances can have unique emblems that can be equipped on your
Warframes and companions. The maximum size of an Alliance is 4,000 members, based on clan sizes within the alliance. For
example, a Ghost Clan will count as 10 members, while a Mountain Clan will count as 300 members, regardless of the actual
number of members within the given clan.

Invasion. Their status can be viewed in the navigation menu.
A Fomorian is a massive Grineer battleship. During the event, Tenno must defeat a Balor Fomorian, the strongest class of the ship.
When the event starts, a Fomorian Disruptor blueprint will be delivered to your inventory. It must be built and equipped in your gear
wheel. Omega Isotopes are a required resource to build it, and these can be farmed on whichever planet the Fomorian is orbiting.
All players must have an equipped Disruptor to start the mission. One Disruptor is used per mission attempt.
This mission is Archwing only. It is recommended to have decent gear before attempting.
Procedure:


1.
Approach Balor Fomorian while avoiding its laser cannon. Warning signs will appear on HUD when the cannon is charged.
2.
Avoid the enemy units and Zeplens. Zeplens will try to trap you in an impenetrable bubble to be targeted by the cannon.
Destroying the Zeplen allows for escape.
3.
Destroy the two shield generators on either side of the Fomorian’s fuselage.
4.
Fly into the Fomorian and activate your Fomorian Disruptor to disable the shields around its power core.

additional damage multiplier.

least 1400m away. However, only one Tenno needs to escape for the mission to finish successfully.
7.
The damage dealt in a single run will be subtracted from the Fomorian’s total health. The event ends when the Fomorian’s
health hits zero.
If the Fomorian is not destroyed by the time the event timer is up, the closest relay will be destroyed by it.
Rewards:
●
Completing the mission 3 times results in 200,000 credits and an orokin catalyst/reactor
●
Completing the mission once results in one reward from the Fomorian drop table. This includes Endo, Imperator Vandal
parts, and dual stat elemental mods for Archwing.

The Razorback Armada is the second of two constantly revolving events. Their status is increased when a player completes a
Corpus Invasion. Their status can be viewed in the navigation menu.
The Razorbacks are upgraded Corpus proxies. During the Event, the Tenno must defeat as many of them as possible.
When the event starts, a Razorback Cipher will be delivered to your inventory. It must be built and equipping in your gear wheel.
Cryptographic Alu is required to build it, and these can be farmed from any Corpus Archwing mission.
All players must have the Cipher to start the mission. One Cipher is used per mission attempt.
Procedure:
1.
Use Cipher to enter battle arena
2.
Disable laser barriers around borders of arena using consoles on balconies to release Bursas
3.
Damage bursas, and hack them
4.
Wait for Bursas to incapacitate Razorback, then attack as normal.
5.
Repeat until Razorback is defeated

“The Plains are being overrun by the Infested, we must destroy the Boil to save Cetus!”
What you need to know:
Doing the bounty given by Konzu rewards 1k Standing for the event. You may increase it by getting Eidolon Phylaxis and Infested
Catalysts and using them during the second stage (mixing). Adding Phylaxis increases enemy level, and adding Catalysts spawns
additional Hemocytes during the final stage, allowing it to drop Hunter Set mods and giving increased Standing. For every Phylaxis
or Catalyst added, the bounty will reward an additional 250 standing, for a maximum of 3,000 standing. A maximum of 4 of each
mixer can be added.
Procedure:
1.
Start the bounty by talking to Konzu.
2.
Phase 1 - Enter the Plains, and grab the toxin from the marked cave.
3.
Phase 2 - Wait for a Grineer camp to be marked, and open the vault in it.
4.
Insert the toxin. This is when the Catalysts and Phylaxis can be inserted as well.
5.
Defend the mixer against Grineer reinforcements.

Phase 3 - Take the completed toxin out, and bring it to the marked Grineer drone.
7.
Insert the toxin into the drone, and escort it to the boil.
8.
Phase 4 - Kill infested around the boil to raise the bounty gauge. Depending on the amount of Catalysts used, the gauge
must reach a certain percentage to spawn a Hemocyte.
9.
Kill the Hemocyte.
10. Repeat steps 8-9 until the gauge reaches 100%.
Tips:
-The Hemocytes are weak to corrosive damage.
-They can be slowed down/sped up by Nova’s Molecular Prime ability.
-They can be stunned by Rhino’s stomp.
-You can deal massive amounts of damage and stay out of range of its attacks by using Titania’s Razorwing.
-The Grineer drone can be teleported by Nova’s portals.

Remove the cell when the fissure is sealed and take it to the next open fissure.
5.
Repeat until 4 fissures have been sealed, or the coolant cell is destroyed.
Each sealed fissure will give one fissure point. Sealing four fissures using one coolant cell will award three bonus points, for a total
of seven. Every four fissures sealed will give one Diluted Thermia (this is influenced by boosters).


Players have the option of increasing the difficulty of the fractures, while also reducing defense time and increasing points gained.
Advanced Procedure:
1.
Kill a coolant Raknoid. These spawn around the Exploiter Orb.
2.
Pick up the coolant cell and take it to an open fissure on the Vallis.
3.
Within 30 seconds, add additional coolant cells to the fissure (maximum of 4).
4.
With each additional canister, 50 seconds will be removed from the fracture timer. It will also increase your Vallis alert level
and increase the frequency of Burps (see below).
5.
Remove the cell(s) when the fissure is sealed and take it the next open fissure.
6.
Repeat until 4 fissures have been sealed, or the coolant cell is destroyed.
When adding additional coolant cells, the fracture will occasionally (every 5-15 seconds) emit a random Burp.
Burp effects:
●
Creates a Nullifier bubble around the fracture.
●
Emits a damage burst with 100% radiation proc chance.
●
Increases the damage of nearby enemies.
●
Spawns Thermic Raknoids.
●
Spawns Eximus units.
●
Increases the current Vallis enemy level.
In addition, for every coolant cell added to a fracture, it will increase the mission score by 1 (max of 4).
Fracture Point Rewards:
●
Buried Debts Emblem @ 5 points
●
Amalgam Shotgun Spazz and Amalgam Serration @ 25 points
●
Amalgam Barrel Diffusion and Amalgam Organ Shatter @ 50 points
●
Buried Debts Sigil @ 75 points
●
Opticor Vandal @ 100 points
*Amalgam mods cannot be equipped on Exalted Weapons.
Exploiter Orb
Procedure:
1. (Requirements for fight) Collect at least one Diluted Thermia.
2. Go into the cave at the end of the arch above Harindi Crater.
3. Go through the door into Deck 12. The second closed door will be the mission start point.
4. Make your way into the facility. In the main room, on the upper deck, right next to where the Vent Kid door would be in Fortuna, is
a console. Insert a Diluted Thermia to start phase one of the fight.


5. The Exploiter will drop in from an opening in the ceiling, and cling to the walls. Shoot the rocks supporting her to make her come
down.
6. Damage one of the four vents on her back. This will cause her to ice over the remaining vents, making them impervious to
damage.
7. Pick up Thermia capsules from one of the three boilers on the ground floor of the main room.
8. Use [ALTERNATE FIRE] to throw the canister at the frozen vents on the Exploiter. As soon as a capsule is thrown, shoot it with a
weapon to make it explode. The vent will now have less ice on it.
9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 again to remove all the ice (two capsules per vent). Destroy the vent using your weapons.
10. Repeat steps 7-9 on the remaining vents.
11. After a period of time, the Exploiter will jump up onto the middle balconies and hang suspended, unable to be damaged. She will
then spawn Coolant Raknoids to attack you. Kill the Raknoids and wait for her to come down.
12. Destroy the last of her vents.
13. The Exploiter will escape to the outside. Leave Deck 12 from the way you came.
14. The Exploiter will spawn outside the entrance to the cave, and phase two of the fight will begin. A small gauge will appear
underneath your minimap. This is her heat sensor. It must be fully filled to damage her again.
15. Kill Coolant Raknoids that approach the Exploiter to keep them from cooling her systems.
16. The Exploiter will occasionally slam her torso on the ground, creating Thermia fractures. Pick up Coolant Capsules from slain
Raknoids and place them in the fractures to create Thermia capsules. As in step 8, throw these at the Exploiter and shoot them to
increase her temperature. It is best to aim for her leg joints and central turret.
17. Once her temperature gauge is completely filled, jump onto her body. An animation will play showing your Warframe removing
one of her processing units.
18. Damage the area where you removed the processing unit.
19. Repeat steps 15-18 for the second processing unit.
20. Repeat steps 15-18 for her central processing unit.
21. Once the third unit is removed and the area destroyed, the Exploiter is defeated. Loot will drop from the back of the Orb.
22. Once the loot is dropped, the Exploiter will self-destruct after 10 seconds, downing anybody in range. It is recommended to let
the Orb explode before collecting the loot.
23. Return to Fortuna.
The mission to fight the Exploiter can be started by visiting Eudico in the back room.
It is recommended to bring quick frames to navigate the large fighting area of the second phase. It is also recommended to bring
secondary weapons with either high fire rates or spreads to make shooting the Thermia capsules easier.
Due to the Exploiter’s cold-based attacks, it is recommended to use the Insulation mod and/or Arcane Warmth to resist the slowing
effects.
During the first phase, the Exploiter will continuously spawn swarms of the small raknoids. Bring an AOE frame or AOE weapon to
deal with them easily.

Expansions
Plains of Eidolon and Cetus
The Plains of Eidolon is DE’s first open-world expansion for Warframe. It features a large, explorable, non-procedurally generated
map with tons of activities and missions to do, along with an all new Relay in the form of a town. The Plains are controlled by the
Grineer.
Q: How does one get standing?
Q: Why are there no sigils for me to equip for standing?
A: Do bounties (essentially PoE missions), fish or mine. The former gives straight up standing, while the latter gives resources you
can trade for standing.
Q: What is that massive thing that roams around at night? Can I kill it?
Q: Can I kill the large thing that moves around at night?
Q: What are the small blue things that roam around at night? Why can’t I damage it after awhile? (SPOILERS)
A: Those are all sentients, and you need your Operator to kill them. They drop cores, which are used to trade for standing at the
Quills.
Q: What are the Quills, and where are they? (SPOILERS)
A: You need to have finished the quest Saya’s Vigil first. Go to Hok’s anvil and take the path around the left, when you see the rocks,
hug them until you see a door similar to TWW, go into Operator Mode and the door will open.
Q: What are those small things that float around?


A:
If these are the ones you’re talking about, they’re Cetus Wisps. You cannot hurt or scan them, but you can pick them
up by walking on/through them. They’re used as a resource.
Q: Where do I obtain ‘x’?
A: Odds are it’s all fishing/mining parts. Otherwise it’s a resource found on the Plains in plants or containers. Just try your hand in
those and see where it leads. (See lists below)
Q: How do I exit the Plains?
A: Go out the way you came. Go back to the door to Cetus and it will load you back into the town.
Q: What’s this Ghoul Purge alert?
A: The Ghoul Purge is a mini-event for the Plains of Eidolon that comes around every couple of weeks or so. It adds two new
bounties to Konzu’s list, and spawns the Grineer Ghoul enemy on the Plains. These bounties and enemies have unique rewards,
weapons, and lore that can be looted and found.
Plains Bounties
Bounties are offered by Konzu. There are 5 different levels available, each with increased difficulty, more Standing, and better
rewards. The Bounty board will change every 2:30 hours. A Bounty mission can be repeated while it is active to gain its reward
drops. Each Bounty will range from having 3 to 5 tasks in order to complete the Bounty, depending on difficulty. After each task, a
reward will be given. You can leave the Plains in the middle of a Bounty and still receive the rewards gained so far.
Plains Fishing
Fishing is an activity done at nearly any water source in the Plains. It provides resources and standing for the Ostron.
Q: How do I fish?
A: Go get a spear from Fisher Hai-Luk near the start of Cetus, and equip it in your gear wheel (only one spear needs to be present in
the wheel, the other spears, bait, and dye are included with it). Stand by any body of water in the plains with the spear out and
listen. When you hear a bubbling noise, start looking. When you see a fish, simply spear it.
Q: Are the dyes worth it?
A: Yes. Dyes illuminate fish in fishing sources, and last for 3 minutes. Being able to see fish helps you learn how they swim and
where they spawn, which is invaluable experience. It also helps immensely when fishing at night.
Q: How does bait work?
Q: How long does bait last?
A: It simply increases the spawn rate, making fish spawn more often when the bait is out. It also increases the spawn rate of much
rarer fish, of which some still spawn without bait, and some that spawn only with bait. Throw bait into hotspots, which are small


white bubbling patches on the surface of the water, that move around constantly. Bait lasts 3 minutes, and do not work outside
hotspots.
Q: Is there any benefit to getting more spears?
A: Yes, each fish is weak to a certain spear, and can be one-hit by it. Using the wrong spear on a fish will cause it to only take
damage, and additional hits are needed for a successful catch.
Q: Does the resource booster work with fish?
A: Yes. Having a resource booster will give two fish for every one caught. However, having a resource drop chance booster has no
radical effect on fish spawns.
Q: Why are the fish different sizes?
A: There are 3 different sizes of fish; small, medium and large. Each size increase gives slightly more resources than the last, and are
worth more standing.
Q: Why can’t I find a certain fish?
A: It’s probably because you're either using the wrong bait, or you’re looking for the fish at the wrong time of day. Check the chart
below if you’re still lost.
Q: What do you get from fishing?
A: Fish give resources necessary for making many Ostron items, and can be a source of standing for the Ostron. Each fish has their
own unique resource drop, but all drop fish scales, fish meat, and fish oil.

^Note: Peppered bait will attract any fish that are active during the day, but is usually not needed.
Plains Mining
Mining is an activity that can be done anywhere on the Plains. It provides resources and standing for the Ostron.
Q: How do I mine?
A: Obtain a mining laser from Old Man Suumbaat in Plains of Eidolon (a pickaxe icon on the map), and equip it in your gear wheel.
When equipping it on the plains; a new UI will appear. On the left, number of ores in range, on the right, how far or close you are to
an ore. Simply listen to the beeping, the faster it gets the closer your crosshair is to the ore. Red streaks on rocks are ores, blue
streaks are gems. When you see one, aim, and a series of glowing spots will appear on the ore. Hold down the Fire button, and try
to get the rising gauge into the middle of the white box, and release (see picture below). The closer the gauge is to the middle of the
box, the better the mining rating.


Q: What is the mining rating?
A: The mining rating is what appears when you finish mining an ore spot. It is rated on a scale of 5. It is based on how well you
match the gauge to the white boxes. The higher the rating, the more resources are gained. A perfect rating of 5 will give double the
typical resources, and has a chance of additionally dropping a rare gem on blue spots.
Q: Why do some spots have two boxes, one big and one small?
A: The small box is an optional hitbox to the larger one. If it is successfully hit, a rare gem is guaranteed upon completing the
mining spot.
Q: Are there any differences between the mining lasers?
A: Each laser has a different range to detect ores, with the standard being 20m, the focused being 40m, and the advanced being
60m. Only the advanced laser can trigger the smaller optional hitboxes to obtain rare gems. {The Fortuna mining laser can also be
used, and acts identically to the advanced laser).
Q: Why are the ores and gems I’m getting different from the ones I need in my blueprint?
A: The ores and gems you mine are the unrefined versions. You have to obtain blueprints from Suumbaat to refine the base
resources into usable resources.

Plains Animal Conservation
Animal conservation involves the tracking and capture of various wild species found on the Plains. Master Teasonai offers gear
items called Echo Lures that can mimic the calls of endangered wildlife that roam the Vallis. Track, call, and tranquilize the animals
to save them.
Procedure
●
Buy a Tranquilizer Rifle from The Business on Fortuna for 500 Standing.
●
Buy an Echo Lure from Master Teasonai with Standing.
●
Equip the Tranq Rifle to your Gear Wheel. The Lures will be included with it.
●
Equip your Tranq Rifle in the Plains. New purple points will be added to your map. These are animal tracking points.
●
Find a point and activate it.
●
Follow the faintly glowing tracks to the rainbow colored rock. This is the call point.
●
Use the correct lure by pressing and holding the Fire Button. Move your viewpoint up and down to change the pitch.
●
The animal will call back. Match its call by using your Lure to emit a pitch that stays in the white box.
●
If successful, pull out your Tranq Rifle and zoom in. The rifle will emit a seeking pulse that will illuminate the animal through
the scope, allowing you to see it through objects.
●
Shoot the animal with the Tranq Rifle or use Warframe abilities to subdue it. Activate it to capture it.
Rewards
Each successful capture will award a Tag from each animal, and an amount of Ostron Standing depending on Capture Rating. 5
Tags of one species can be traded in to Master Teasonai to receive stuffed animal decorations, also known as Floofs. Having one
tag of every species and type can be traded for an emblem.
Capture Rating
Each capture will be rated as Perfect, Good, or Bad. This does not influence Tags gained, but will influence Standing. Capture rating
is based on speed at which animal is captured after return call is received, and whether or not the animal was alerted to your
presence.
Animal Types
●
Kuakas - "A timid rodent that is easily frightened."
●
Condrocs - "A carrion-eater and opportunistic bird-of-prey. Condrocs gather, feed upon carrion, and occasionally, hunt in
groups known as 'committees'. Several committees will be led by an Emperor."
●
Mergoos - "An avian of ridiculous appearance found along coastal regions and around large bodies of water. Mergoo circle
and squawk at the sight of marine predators. Many an Ostron fisher owes their lives to these odd little birds. Killing one is
considered very bad luck."

Notes
●
Animals can be killed, and will not provide any Standing or tags if they are.
●
Shooting the Tranq Rifle and missing will NOT alert animals.
●
Sleep based Warframes can use their abilities in place of the Tranq Rifle.
●
Equinox’s Rest and Ivara’s sleep arrow can pacify all 3 Pobbers in one use.
●
Volt’s passive will generate enough damage to kill animals while using the Tranq Rifle. Do not use him.
●
Invisibility abilities will hide your presence from animals.
●
By equipping a certain Lure, only tracking points of that species will appear on your map.
●
If using location-based sound equipment or headphones, the direction of the animal’s call will be the direction where it will
appear.
Zaws
A Zaw is a modular melee weapon with customizable stats influenced by the parts used to build one. Most Zaw parts blueprints are
bought with Standing from Hok in Cetus. The rest are obtained from Plague Star. Your Ostron Standing determines which parts are
available.
Zaws are made from 3 parts - the Strike, Hilt, and Link. One of each of these is needed to build a Zaw, along with a small amount of
Credits. The Strike determines the damage of the Zaw, the Hilt determines the type of weapon, and the Link determines the
modifiers of speed, damage, crit chance, and status chance.


Every Zaw Strike can give 3k MR, but must be Gilded first. Gilding a Zaw is done by Hok, and requires a level 30 Zaw. Gilding costs
5k Standing and 2 Cetus Wisps, and slightly increases its base stats. A Zaw cannot be upgraded with a Forma or Potato until it is
Gilded.
Plague Zaw parts only come from the Plague Star reward tables, and are not purchasable from Hok.

Tusk Thumpers
Tusk Thumpers are a Grineer quadruped vehicle that spawns on the Plains during the Day cycle, either in free roam or in bounties.
They are heavily armored and quite agile, able to leap great distances. They employ blaster cannons and ground-based seismic
attacks. They will pop up from underground much like Ghouls, or spawn randomly during Plains bounty phases.
There are 3 variants of Thumpers; standard, Bull, and Doma. Each additional variant is larger, and has additional health and armor.
To defeat a Thumper, the plates on each of its knees must be damaged and knocked off. A green spot will be exposed. Damage the
green area until it closes itself. Repeat with all 4 legs.
Thumpers drop a random variety of common, uncommon, and rare Plains resources on death. The standard thumper has 400%
resources drop, the Bull has 600%, and the Doma has 800%. The Bull and Doma also have a chance to drop the Korrudo blueprint.
All Thumpers have a chance to drop Augur, Gladiator, and Vice set mods.
Thumper floof variants can be bought from Nakak in Cetus for standard resources.
Eidolon Hunting (SPOILERS)
Eidolons are huge sentients that roam the Plains at night. They are a very difficult enemy and should not be taken lightly.
Q: How does one hunt an Eidolon?
A: Procedure:
1.
Get Eidolon lures from Grineer camps (2 for Teralyst, 3 each for Gantulyst and Hydrolyst) and power them up by killing
Vomvalysts (until they’re ethereal, being near the lure sucks them in) or by killing the vomvalyst and picking up the small orb
it drops, and delivering it to the lure. The lure will make a sound cue when it’s full. Skipping this step makes the Eidolon
teleport when you destroy a weak point, and denies a brilliant eidolon shard at the end of the fight.
2.
Break the Eidolon’s purple shield with your Operator’s amp, until the Eidolon flashes red.
3.
Shoot with normal weapons the weak spots, or Synovias. The Teralyst’s are located on its biceps and knees. The Gantulyst
and Hydrolyst are similar, but have 6 Synovias, with additional ones being located around the shoulder joints. Only one may
be destroyed at a time, and damage done to other Synovias do not carry over.
4.
Once a Synovia is destroyed, the Eidolon will fall to its knee and emit a 5 pulse magnetic wave, and will then regenerate its
shield. Repeat step 2~3 until all Synovias are destroyed.


5.
Once all Synovias are destroyed, the Eidolon will lay down and emit a scream, attracting Vomvalysts to its location. Destroy
the Vomvalysts as they approach, as the more that fuse with the Eidolon, the more health it will have in the final battle.
6.
When the healing phase is complete, the Eidolon will stand, and continue to attack. At this point, any part of the Eidolon can
be damaged by normal weapons. Damage it until its health bar disappears. This ends the hunt and rewards are spawned.
Q: What attacks does the Eidolon use?
A: All 3 Eidolons have a set list of attacks:
●
Ground Stomp - Sends out a yellow pulse that pushes back Warframes and Operators up to 100m. Can be avoided by
jumping.
●
Gun Swing - Quickly sweeps its arm in a 270 degree arc, while shooting out blue projectiles from its hand that explode on
impact.
●
Ground Smash - Stomps down on the ground, emitting glowing blue streaks in the ground that will damage and stagger.
This attack can track you.
●
Seeking Bullets - Emits a ball of energy above its head, which then splits into many small blue seeking missiles.
●
Tree Swing - Quickly swings its arm in a wide arc. Deals heavy damage and knocks down.
●
Star Fall - Raises its arm upward and fires into the sky, causing a rain of seeking projectiles to fall down.
●
Energy Spikes - Upon destruction of a limb, the Eidolon will emit 5 wave pulses of magnetic energy. High damage and
removes all Warframe energy.
The Gantulyst and Hydrolyst have additional attacks. The Gantulyst gains alternate laser attacks and a large shield, and can easily
destroy lures. The Hydrolyst gains alternate lightning attacks and can create Vomvalyst spawning portals.
Q: What Warframes do I use to hunt an Eidolon?
A: Warframes that provide innate damage boosts or give passive abilities to allies, like Rhino and Harrow, are the best to use
against the Eidolons. Healing frames like Trinity and Oberon are useful in keeping allies alive and protecting the lures. Damage
frames like Mesa and Saryn cannot target the Eidolon Synovias, and should not be used. Melee frames like Wukong and Atlas
should also be avoided, as the Synovias are very difficult to hit with melee attacks.
It should be noted that shooting through Volt’s shields will double Amp damage.
Q: What Weapons do I use to hunt an Eidolon?
A: Any weapon with high burst damage, such as DMRs (Latron, Tiberon) or Snipers (Lanka, Rubico). Eidolons have Alloy Armor, and
are weak to Radiation damage, so mods and weapons that provide Radiation are highly recommended. Weapons with low range,
such as Shotguns or Beam weapons are not recommended, due to the danger and bad angle of getting close to the Eidolon.
Automatic weapons are not recommended, due to the Eidolon’s erratic movements making consecutive shots difficult, lowering
DPS.
Q: What Amps do I use to hunt an Eidolon?
A: The old meta is the 2 2 3 Amp, the Schwaak, Shraksun, and Lohrin. The new meta after Fortuna update 2 is 6 2 7, the Lega,
Shraksun, and Certus. Otherwise, any Amp combination other than the Mote Amp will work when hunting Eidolons.


Q: The Eidolon got its shields back while fighting it, what gives?
A: The Vomvalysts can regenerate the Eidolon’s shield when not dealt with. Make sure to kill them when you see them.
Q: How does one do a Tridolon?
A: It’s the same as the above, only you fight 3 Eidolons instead of one. To spawn the next Eidolon, go to the shrine on the final rock
on Gara Tote Lake, and place the Brilliant Eidolon Shard from the previous fight on the shrine. Once all players in the instance place
their shards, the next Eidolon will spawn in the water in front of the rock. Keep in mind the other two Eidolons require 3 lures to
capture and have 6 Synovias to destroy, along with different attacks.
Q: What does killing an Eidolon give?
A: Defeating an Eidolon in any way awards an Eidolon Shard and a number of Sentient Cores, usually around 20-30. Capturing an
Eidolon awards a Brilliant Eidolon Shard. Capturing a Hydrolyst awards an extra Brilliant Eidolon Shard. Capturing a Gantulyst or
Hydrolyst also awards a Radiant Eidolon Shard. All 3 Eidolons have a chance to drop a physical damage mod for weapons, and an
Arcane from the standard Arcane list. Teralysts have a very low chance to drop a rare Arcane, a low chance to drop an uncommon
Arcane, and a high chance of dropping a common Arcane. Gantulysts and Hydrolysts have a moderate chance to drop rare Arcanes,
a high chance to drop uncommon Arcanes, and a low chance to drop common Arcanes. The Gantulyst and Hydrolyst also drop one
Riven Transmuter each. In addition, completing the Teralyst Bounty awards 1,000 Ostron Standing, while completing the three
Teralyst bounty awards 5,000 Ostron Standing.
Q: What do I do with Eidolon shards?
Q: What do I do with Brilliant/Radiant Eidolon shards?
A: Regular Eidolon Shards are used in ranking up with the Quills, and for crafting some blueprints.
Brilliant Eidolon Shards can be converted into 25,000 focus for your current school, or used to unlock Waybound Nodes.
Radiant Eidolon Shards can be converted into 40,000 focus for your current school.
Q: What do the terms in recruiting chat mean?
A: Players use many different terms when creating squads for Eidolon hunting. One of these is H 5x3. The H stands for Hosting, and
the first number is how many times that player wants to kill all three Eidolons, which is the second number. So a 5x3 is 5 sets, or 5
Tridolons. A 4x3 is hunting 4 Tridolons, and so on.
VS stands for Void Strike, an ability in the Madurai school. It increases your damage for a set number of following shots, and works
with amps. UW or UW Chroma stands for Unairu Wisp, an ability in the Unairu school. It spawns a tiny wisp when you hit an enemy
with void blast. When picked up, the wisp provides double damage for your amp. CP stands for Corrosive Projection, the aura mod
that lowers enemy armor. CD stands for Coaction Drift, which increases aura effectiveness.
Amps (SPOILERS)
Amps are a modular weapon wielded by your Operator. They replace the default void beam that is used after The War Within. Amps
and their part blueprints are obtained from Quill Onkko in Cetus.


Amps are built using three parts - the Prism, Scaffold, and Brace. The Prism determines primary fire, the Scaffold determines
alternate fire, and the Brace gives augments and passives. The Mote Amp is the default Amp, and can be built as one complete unit.
It fires similarly to the void beam.

Numbers represent Amp level. Each set of Prism, Scaffold, and Brace are unlocked as Quill Ranking progresses. So the first set
unlocked are considered the 1 1 1, the second set are 2 2 2, and so on. When making a mixed Amp, numbers are mixed and ordered


as needed, such as 3 2 4, which is the third Prism, the second Scaffold, and the fourth Brace. All Amps are referred to in this number
system, for speed and convenience.
Amps are primarily used for fighting Sentients, as Void damage ignores Sentient damage resistance. Also, the Eidolon’s shields are
only affected by Operator Amps. For this reason, the most commonly used Amps are X 2 3, as in any Prism, the Shraksun Scaffold,
and the Lohrin Brace, as this combination provides the most damage when hunting Eidolons. In addition, Amps can be used to
destroy Kuva Clouds in Kuva Siphon missions.
Amps, like Zaws and Kit Guns, can be Gilded for a slight increase in stats, and the ability to apply custom colors and Arcanes. Each
of the Prisms will provide 3k MR after Gilding.
Orb Vallis and Fortuna
Fortuna is Warframe’s second and most recent open-world expansion. It features another large, open map that is not procedurally
generated. Orb Vallis’ map is roughly 5 times the size of Plains of Eidolon, and features many of the same activities. Orb Vallis is
controlled and operated by the Corpus.
Vallis Bounties
Bounties are offered by Eudico. There are 5 different levels available, each with increased difficulty, more Standing, and better
rewards. The Bounty board will change every 2:30 hours. A Bounty mission can be repeated while it is active for its reward drops.
Each Bounty will range from having 3 to 5 tasks in order to complete the Bounty, depending on difficulty. After each task, a reward
will be given. You can leave the Vallis in the middle of a Bounty and still receive the rewards gained so far.
Vallis Fishing
Fishing is an activity done at nearly every water source in Orb Vallis. The servofish found in these sources can be used for resources,
or traded for Fortuna Standing.
The process of hunting for fish remains largely the same as the Plains of Eidolon, however the spear technique is slightly changed.
Once you hit a servofish, a horizontal gauge with a red target box appears, with a line moving from left to right. You must press the
[FIRE BUTTON] when the line is within the box to shock the fish, allowing you to collect it. If you miss, the fish will be set free, and
you must spear it again.
Q: How do I fish?
A: Talk to The Business in Fortuna and buy the Shockprod fishing spear for 500 Standing, equip it in your gear wheel, and pull it out
near a water source in the Vallis.
Q: Do Cetus Dyes work in Fortuna?


A: Yes, they work the exact same.
Q: How does bait work?
Q: How long does bait last?
A: It simply increases the spawn rate, making fish spawn more often when the bait is out. It also increases the spawn rate of much
rarer fish, of which some still spawn without bait, and some that spawn only with bait. Throw bait into hotspots, which are small
white bubbling patches on the surface of the water, that move around constantly. Bait lasts 3 minutes, and do not work outside
hotspots.
Q: What’s the difference between the Shockprod and Stunna Spear?
A: The Stunna spear works the same as the Shockprod, except when you successfully shock a fish, any nearby fish are stunned by its
blast for a short period of time (about 30 seconds). These fish will slowly float and can’t be startled, and when speared, their target
box is twice as large as normal. (This effect works on fish in the Plains, however the target fish will not be successfully speared).
Q: Does the resource booster work with fish?
A: Yes. Having a resource booster will give two fish for every one caught. However, having a resource drop chance booster has no
radical effect on fish spawns.
Q: Why can’t I find a certain fish?
A: It’s probably because you're either using the wrong bait, you’re looking in the wrong water biome, or you’re looking for the fish at
the wrong temperature time. Check the chart below if you’re still lost.
Q: What do servofish points mean?
A: There are 3 different kinds of servofish; basic, adorned, and magnificent. Each type increase gives slightly more common
resources than the last, and are worth more standing.
Q: What do you get from Fishing?
A: Servofish give resources necessary for making many Fortuna items, and can be a source of standing for Fortuna. Each servofish
has their own unique resource drop, but all drop scrap.

Vallis Mining
Mining in Orb Vallis is identical to mining in the Plains. A cutter drill is required to be equipped in your gear wheel in order to mine.
Fortuna and Cetus cutters will work in either location. Mining provides resources that can be used in building items from Fortuna or
traded for standing.
Q: How do I mine?
A: Obtain a mining laser from Smokefinger in Fortuna, and equip it in your gear wheel. When equipping it on the Vallis; a new UI
will appear. On the left, number of ores in range, on the right, how far or close you are to an ore. Simply listen to the beeping, the
faster it gets the closer your crosshair is to the ore. Red streaks on rocks are ores, blue streaks are gems. When you see one, aim,
and a series of glowing spots will appear on the ore. Hold down the Fire button, and try to get the rising gauge into the middle of
the white box, and release (see picture below). The closer the gauge is to the middle of the box, the better the mining rating.


Q: What is the mining rating?
A: The mining rating is what appears when you finish mining an ore spot. It is rated on a scale of 5. It is based on how well you
match the gauge to the white boxes. The higher the rating, the more resources are gained. A perfect rating of 5 will give double the
typical resources, and has a chance of additionally dropping a rare gem on blue spots.
Q: Why do some spots have two boxes, one big and one small?
A: The small box is an optional hitbox to the larger one. If it is successfully hit, a rare gem is guaranteed upon completing the
mining spot.
Q: Why are the ores and gems I’m getting different from the ones I need in my blueprint?
A: The ores and gems you mine are the unrefined versions. You have to obtain blueprints from Smokefinger to refine the base
resources into usable resources.

Vallis Animal Conservation
Animal conservation involves the tracking and capture of various wild species found on the Vallis. The Business offers gear items
called Echo Lures that can mimic the calls of endangered wildlife that roam the Vallis. Track, call, and tranquilize the animals to save
them.
Procedure


●
Buy a Tranquilizer Rifle from the Business with 500 Standing.
●
Buy an Echo Lure from The Business with Standing.
●
Equip the Tranq Rifle to your Gear Wheel. The Lures will be included with it.
●
Equip your Tranq Rifle in the Vallis. New purple points will be added to your map. These are animal tracking points.
●
Find a point and activate it.
●
Follow the faintly glowing tracks to the rainbow colored rock. This is the call point.
●
Use the correct lure by pressing and holding the Fire Button. Move your viewpoint up and down to change the pitch.
●
The animal will call back. Match its call by using your Lure to emit a pitch that stays in the white box.
●
If successful, pull out your Tranq Rifle and zoom in. The rifle will emit a seeking pulse that will illuminate the animal through
the scope, allowing you to see it through objects.
●
Shoot the animal with the Tranq Rifle or use Warframe abilities to subdue it. Activate it to capture it.
Rewards
Each successful capture will award a Tag from each animal, and an amount of Solaris United Standing depending on Capture
Rating. 5 Tags of one species can be traded in to The Business to receive stuffed animal decorations, also known as Floofs. Having
one tag of every species and type can be traded for an emblem.
Capture Rating
Each capture will be rated as Perfect, Good, or Bad. This does not influence Tags gained, but will influence Standing. Capture rating
is based on speed at which animal is captured after return call is received, and whether or not the animal was alerted to your
presence.
Animal Types
●
Pobbers - "Native to the fungal forests of Venus, the Pobber is a skittish rodent possessed of an objectionable odor. Always
found in groups, they flee at the slightest hint of trouble. They are a primary food source for the Virmink and Sawgaw."
●
Virminks - "Sleek and silky, the adorable appearance of the Venusian Virmink belies its aggressive demeanor. Favoring rocky
landscapes Virmink packs nose the air, scenting for Pobbers - their primary food source."
●
Sawgaws - “Soar Gore, as the Solaris call it, this crimson-faced bird of prey circles and stalks the cliffs and fungal groves of
Venus, searching for rodent prey.”
●
Bolarolas - "Favoring thunder, lightning and cratered-out areas Bolarolas are all about defense. Their armored plates protect
them from most predators, tucking-and-rolling to make good their escape.
●
Horrasques - “This hideous creature is terrible to behold but will not attack unless provoked. When it does, its roar will shake
the bowels of even the most steadfast tracker.”
●
Stover - "The Stover is a kind of proto-Kubrow that resurrected when Venus thawed. When grouped in a pack, Stovers are
relentless opponents."
●
Kubrodons - "The apex predator of the Venusian plains. These massively framed beasts travel in groups and mark the
territory surrounding Orokin cooling towers as their own. Kubrodons are a danger best avoided."

Notes


●
Animals can be killed, and will not provide any Standing or tags if they are.
●
Shooting the Tranq Rifle and missing will NOT alert animals.
●
Sleep based Warframes can use their abilities in place of the Tranq Rifle.
●
Equinox’s Rest and Ivara’s sleep arrow can pacify all 3 Pobbers in one use.
●
Volt’s passive will generate enough damage to kill animals while using the Tranq Rifle. Do not use him.
●
Invisibility abilities will hide your presence from animals.
●
By equipping a certain Lure, only tracking points of that species will appear on your map.
●
If using location-based sound equipment or headphones, the direction of the animal’s call will be the direction where it will
appear.
Kit Guns
Kit Guns are the modular weapons of Fortuna, similar to Zaws in Cetus. Kit Gun parts blueprints are offered by Rude Zuud for
Solaris United Standing. New parts are available as Solaris United rank is increased. Kit Guns are made from 3 parts; Chamber, Grip,
and Loader.
Kit Gun Chambers will provide 3k MR each. Like Zaws, Kit Guns must be Gilded to gain MR. Gilding is available to any Kit Gun that
has been maxed at level 30, and costs 5k Standing and 10 Shelter Debt-Bonds. Gilding also allows you to rename your Kit Gun.
Unguilded Kit Guns cannot have Potatoes, Formas, or Arcanes installed on them.

K-Drive & Ventkids
K- Drives are hoverboard vehicles that were added in the Fortuna Update. These K-Drives are slower than Archwing, so if you’re
looking for the best mobility vehicle go with Archwing. That being said, K-Drives are one of the most fun ways to kill time in
Warframe.
Q: How do I get a K-Drive?
A: Once you complete the initial Fortuna quest Vox Solaris you will receive a K-Drive Launcher. You will be able to equip this in your
gear wheel. Once it is equipped in your gear wheel you should be able to launch a K-Drive in both open world areas.
Q: Where do I get more K-Drives?
Q: How do I get Ventkid standing?
A: The Ventkids can be accessed after completing Vox Solaris. Their main vendor is Roky. Ventkid standing is earned by completing
tricks in the Vallis or by winning races found on the map. The standing can then be used to buy K-Drive parts and mods. A K-Drive is
made up of four parts; a board, reactor, nose, and jet. These must be crafted then brought to and assembled by Roky. Boards with
random parts can alternatively be bought already completed for Platinum.
Q: Do K-Drive parts matter?
A: Parts do not have any impact on how the K-Drive performs. Only the board matters as it provides MR.
Q: Can I level up my K-Drive?
Q: Do K-Drives get MR?
A: Yes, the board of a K-Drive is what earns MR, a maximum of 3k per board. K-Drives receive affinity from doing tricks and
completing races on the Vallis, and like all other pieces of equipment, can level to 30.
Q: Can I mod my K-Drive?
A: Yes, all K-Drive mods can be bought from Roky for standing. The K-Drive itself can be modded in your Arsenal’s vehicle section.
Profit Taker
Orb Mothers are giant Corpus Raknoids that protect key operational sites. They are the raid boss fight of the Orb Vallis, similar to
Eidolons. There are currently two, the Profit-Taker Orb that can be found at the Enrichment Labs, and the Exploiter Orb that patrols
around the Temple of Profit. Only the Profit-Taker can currently be fought.
In order to fight the Profit-Taker, you must first be at the rank of Old Mate with Solaris United. From there, you go to the hidden back
room behind Eudico to receive the Heist bounty missions. There are 4 bounties currently, that must be completed subsequently. The
fourth bounty is fighting the Profit-Taker itself. After completing all 4 once, you may go back and play them again in any order to
receive their drop rewards.


The third bounty awards the Gravimag System, which is a gear item that allows you to equip one primary Archwing weapon while in
missions. The Gravimag may be equipped to only one weapon, and is not cycleable. The weapon must have an Orokin Catalyst
equipped to equip the Gravimag. Archwing weapons are the only weapons that can damage the Orb. The Gravimag must be
equipped in your gear wheel to use in missions.
Additional Gravimags can be researched and purchased in the Tenno Lab in Clan Dojos, or bought from the Market for 20p.
Procedure:
1.
Find Profit-Taker on the Orb Vallis map.
2.
Take out shields using displayed element(s) (See below).
3.
Completely damage all 4 legs with Archwing weapon.
4.
Damage the head with Archwing weapon.
5.
At 75% health, the Orb will launch 4 pylons into the ground around itself, within 100m. The pylons are protected by a
physical barrier that nullifies all gunfire, but can be passed through with no effect.
6.
Destroy all pylons, Orb is invulnerable while pylons are intact.
7.
Take out shield and legs again, continue to damage head.
8.
At 50% health, the Orb will fully regain its shields and will deal more damage.
9.
Take out shield, take out legs, damage the head.
10. At 25% health, the Orb will deploy 6 pylons with the same properties as the previous 4.
11. Once the 6 pylons are destroyed, the Orb will fully regain its shields again.
12. Take out shield, take out legs, destroy the head and defeat the Orb. This step must be completed in 5 minutes or less.
13. The Orb overcharges from its shielding satellite, and self destructs, instantly downing anything in a 300m radius. Run to a
safe distance then return to collect drops. There is a delay of one minute between defeating the Orb and its self destruction.
The Orb Mother’s shields have a unique damaging procedure, due to Sentient resistance. The shields can be damaged by any
regular weapon; normal, Archwing, or Exalted, but cannot be damaged by True or Void damage. Displayed on the Orb’s front
faceplate will be a symbol of a specific damage type. The shield will be invulnerable to all damage except the displayed damage
type. The type encompasses all physical and elemental damage, but does not include Void or True damage. This includes dual
elemental types. Keep in mind that dual elemental types will not work if a single element is displayed, even if the single element is
included in the dual element. For example, if the displayed element is toxin, then the shield will only be damaged by toxin, not
corrosive or gas or viral.
The shield damage type can be changed in 3 ways. If enough damage is dealt from one damage type, the Orb will rapidly shift to
another. Shooting the Orb with any type of Void damage, Amp or otherwise, will change the damage type. There is a cooldown of 10
seconds after using this method before the type can be changed again. If enough time passes without either of these changes, the
damage type will change by itself.


Warframe abilities that target or deal AOE damage do not affect the Orb’s shields or body whatsoever. This includes Mesa’s
Peacemaker, Banshee’s Soundquake, Saryn’s Miasma, etc. Warframe abilities that are weaponized do work, such as Excalibur’s
Exalted Blade, Titania’s Dex Pixia, and Ivara’s Artemis Bow. This can be used as an advantage, as these weapons can hold
additional damage types. Warframe abilities/augments that provide damage buffs, such as Rhino’s Roar and Chroma’s Vex Armor,
work against the Orb. Warframe abilities/augments that apply status effects to allies’ weapons, such as Saryn’s Spores or Frost’s
Freeze, do work in providing additional elemental damage types against the shield.
It should be noted that the Profit-Taker will summon Corpus reinforcement to help defend itself. These enemies will move and
attack around the Profit-Taker, and will put up reinforcement beacons as normal. The enemies range from level 40-60 and should
be dealt with regularly.
Amps (SPOILERS)
See Plains of Eidolons Amps for general information on Amps.
Upon completing Vox Solaris, the player will unlock a secret backroom behind Eudico’s chair. This is the same room where the
Profit-Taker bounties are found. Here you can talk to Little Duck in Operator form to view Vox Solaris standing, trade Toroids for
Standing, and purchase Operator cosmetic blueprints, Arcanes, and Amp parts.
With the Profit-Taker update, Vox Solaris added 3 new Amp Prisms, Scaffolds, and Braces.

Cambion Drift and Necralisk
Drift Bounties
Bounties are offered by Mother. There are 5 different levels available, each with increased difficulty, more Mother Tokens, and
better rewards. The Bounty board will change every 2:30 hours. A Bounty mission can be repeated while it is active for its reward
drops. Each Bounty will range from having 3 to 5 tasks in order to complete the Bounty, depending on difficulty. After each task, a
reward will be given. You can leave the Cambion Drift in the middle of a Bounty and still receive the rewards and standing gained
so far.
Mother Tokens are the bounty method of standing gain, You get more tokens the higher tier bounty you select.
If all the bonus objectives are completed (i.e. the bonus objective is completed for each stage), an additional reward will be given
out at the final stage, drawing from the drop table of the final stage.
In addition to the standard 3-, 4-, and 5-stage bounties, Mother also has endless bounties. These contain 3 normal bounty stages
per rewards cycle, with both enemy level and token rewards increasing every cycle.
Cambion Drift Fishing
Fishing is an activity done at nearly every exocrine source in Cambion Drift. The fish found in these sources can be used for
resources, or traded for Daughter Tokens.
Fish in Deimos' Cambion Drift can be caught with spears from both Fortuna and Cetus. However, these spears cannot pass through
the 'exocrine' through which the infested fish can swim freely; for optimal fishing on Deimos, there are two new spears that can pass
through the exocrine and thus catch fish more easily. The Spari Fishing Spear can be bought for 500 Standing from Daughter. The
Spari is capable of piercing the Infested exocrine in the Cambion Drift, allowing it to catch Cambion Drift fish underwater.


There are Infested, Orokin/Infested hybrids, and pure Orokin fish that are capable of flight, and can be caught using any fishing
spear when they emerge from the exocrine. Players can engage in spearfishing to catch these Infested biomes, which can then be
used as resources to craft various Entrati items or gifted to Daughter to earn Daughter Tokens.

Cambion Drift Mining
Mining in the Cambion Drift is identical to mining in the Plains and Orb Vallis. A cutter drill is required to be equipped in your gear
wheel in order to mine. Fortuna and Cetus cutters will work in all locations. Mining provides resources that can be used in building
items from Necralisk or traded for standing.
Q: How do I mine?
A: Obtain a mining laser from Smokefinger in Fortuna (There is no Necralisk specific Mining laser), and equip it in your gear wheel.
When equipping it on the Combion Drift, a new UI will appear. On the left, number of ores in range, on the right, how far or close
you are to an ore. Simply listen to the beeping, the faster it gets the closer your crosshair is to the ore. Red streaks on rocks are
ores, blue streaks are gems. When you see one, aim, and a series of glowing spots will appear on the ore. Hold down the Fire
button, and try to get the rising gauge into the middle of the white box, and release (see picture below). The closer the gauge is to
the middle of the box, the better the mining rating.
Q: What is the mining rating?
A: The mining rating is what appears when you finish mining an ore spot. It is rated on a scale of 5. It is based on how well you
match the gauge to the white boxes. The higher the rating, the more resources are gained. A perfect rating of 5 will give double the
typical resources, and has a chance of additionally dropping a rare gem on blue spots.
Q: Why do some spots have two boxes, one big and one small?
A: The small box is an optional hitbox to the larger one. If it is successfully hit, a rare gem is guaranteed upon completing the
mining spot.
Q: Why are the ores and gems I’m getting different from the ones I need in my blueprint?
A: The ores and gems you mine are the unrefined versions. You have to obtain blueprints from Smokefinger to refine the base
resources into usable resources.

Cambion Drift Animal Conservation
Animal conservation involves the tracking and capture of various wild species found on the Drift. The Business offers gear items
called Echo Lures that can mimic the calls of endangered wildlife that roam the Cambion Drift. Track, call, and tranquilize the
animals to save them.
Procedure
●
Buy a Tranquilizer Rifle from Son with 500 Standing.
●
Buy an Echo Lure from Son with Standing.
●
Equip the Tranq Rifle to your Gear Wheel. The Lures will be included with it.
●
Equip your Tranq Rifle in the Cambion Drift. New purple points will be added to your map. These are animal tracking points.
●
Find a point and activate it.
●
Follow the faintly glowing tracks to the rainbow colored rock. This is the call point.
●
Use the correct lure by pressing and holding the Fire Button. Move your viewpoint up and down to change the pitch.
●
The animal will call back. Match its call by using your Lure to emit a pitch that stays in the white box.
●
If successful, pull out your Tranq Rifle and zoom in. The rifle will emit a seeking pulse that will illuminate the animal through
the scope, allowing you to see it through objects.
●
Shoot the animal with the Tranq Rifle or use Warframe abilities to subdue it. Activate it to capture it.
Rewards
Each successful capture will award a Tag from each animal, and an amount of Necralisk Standing depending on Capture Rating. 5
Tags of one species can be traded with Son to receive stuffed animal decorations, also known as Floofs. Having one tag of every
species and type can be traded for an emblem.
Capture Rating
Each capture will be rated as Perfect, Good, or Bad. This does not influence Tags gained, but will influence Standing. Capture rating
is based on speed at which the animal is captured after the return call is received, and whether or not the animal was alerted to your
presence.


All species in the wild can appear in groups of 1-3. When called from a lure, Cryptilex, Avichaea, and Undazoas can appear in groups
of 2-4.
Animal Types
●
Cryptilex - "A Burrowing Cryptilex. Insects are the base of Deimos' food webs, that's why conservation of even these humble
creatures is so vital"
●
Vulpaphyla - “The Crescent is the most pugnacious subspecies of Vulpaphyla, they will rush anything they perceive as a
threat.”
●
Predasite - “A skittish creature, the Vizier Predasite will unleash a spume of acid before scurrying away.”
●
Avichaeas - "A prehistoric bird-like creature that often congregates in small groups.”
●
Velocipods - “A sluggish highlands insect that's capable of bursts of speed when threatened.”
●
Undazoa - "A shy, bizarre-looking, semi-aquatic creature that seldom attacks unless provoked."
●
Nexiferas - "Due to its remarkable strength, this Nexifera can cause seismic shocks when hitting the ground."
Each a Perfect Capture rewards 3x Tags of the Animal you caught, A good capture rewards 2x and a Bad Capture rewards 1x
The Nexiferas and Velocipods have no Echo-Lure, instead must be found out in the wild, The Nexiferas are found inside cave
complexes, hanging on the ceiling. A neon green puddle appears below them, which when walked over will prompt the Nexifera to
dive and attack, then retract and burrow into the ceiling. Their armored carapace neutralizes tranquilizing shots, forcing Tenno to
bait them to descend and reveal their fleshy tendrils attached to the ceiling.
The Velocipods are gentle and do not attack, nor do they try to run away, even allowing Tenno to mount them like a K-Drive. They
are typically found at higher altitudes and may be resting on the rocks, or if they are more active, will be at junctions in waterways.
Some Sub Species of animals only spawn during one of the two cycles, Vome and Fass.
Crescent Vulpaphyla only spawn during Vome, Panzer Vulpaphyla only spawn during Fass.
Medjay Predasite only spawn during Vome, Pharaoh Predasite only spawn during Fass.
Sporule Avichaea only spawn during Vome, Viscid Avichaea only spawn during Fass.
Howler Undazoa only spawn during Vome, Vaporous Undazoa only spawn during Fass.
Notes
●
Animals can be killed, and will not provide any Standing or tags if they are.
●
Shooting the Tranq Rifle and missing will NOT alert animals.
●
Sleep based Warframes can use their abilities in place of the Tranq Rifle.
●
Equinox’s Rest and Ivara’s sleep arrow can pacify all 3 Pobbers in one use.
●
Volt’s passive will generate enough damage to kill animals while using the Tranq Rifle. Do not use him.
●
Invisibility abilities will hide your presence from animals.
●
By equipping a certain Lure, only tracking points of that species will appear on your map.


●
If using location-based sound equipment or headphones, the direction of the animal’s call will be the direction where it will
appear.
Kit Guns
Kit Guns are modular weapons obtained in Fortuna or Necralisk. Kit Gun parts blueprints are offered by Rude Zuud for Solaris
United Standing or from Father for Necralisk Standing. New parts are available as Solaris United rank and Necralisk rank is
increased. Kit Guns are made from 3 parts; Chamber, Grip, and Loader.
Isolation Vaults
The Cambion Drift has numerous Isolation Vaults that are hidden deep within Deimos. To access them, players must start an
"Isolation Vault" Bounty from Mother either from inside the Necralisk or from Mother's various outposts within the Drift.
There are 3 Isolation Vaults accessible to players, You must finish the past tier Isolation Vault to permanently unlock the next tier.
The Tiers are, Tier 1 - Level 30-40, Tier 2 - Level 40-50, Tier 3 - Level 50-60.

all the resources within the Vault, Additionally an extra reward will be provided from the Bounties Drop Table.
Arcana Bounties are unlocked after completing the first Isolation Vault, they are similar to normal Necralisk Bounties but add some
new objectives as well, they can be started by interacting with Mother just outside an Isolation Vault.
The rewards from Arcana Bounties are more focused on Arcanes and Damaged Necramech parts.
Higher level bounties are unlocked by completing the prior Arcana Bounty, similar to Isolation Vaults.
Necramechs
Necramechs are bipedal war machines manufactured by the Entrati, They can be found across the Cambion Drift and inside the
Isolation Vaults, The ones in the vaults are sentient and will attack on site, however the ones found on the surface can either be
Active or not, depending on the cycle, Fass for inactive, Vome for active, You are able to take control of a inactive Necramech by

Other Resources and Information
Twitch Prime
By connecting your Twitch Prime account to your Warframe account, you will periodically receive Twitch rewards for Warframe in
the form of free gear and items. In addition, during scheduled Warframe streams, you can receive a Twitch Drop or randomly
selected reward if you watch while signed into your connected account(You don’t need Twitch Prime for Twitch Drops).


Prime Access
Prime Access occurs whenever a Warframe’s Prime variant is revealed. This typically happens every 4 months. Prime Access brings
with it the new Primed Warframe, new Primed weapons, and new Primed cosmetic items. The Warframe and weapon parts are
added to the current relic drop tables, and the Prime Access pack becomes available for purchase with real currency.
The Prime Access pack always comes in 4 different levels:
●
Level 1 includes the two new Prime weapons, and 1050p
($49.99 USD, $100 value)
●
Level 2 includes the new Prime Warframe, both Prime weapons, two glyphs of the Primed Warframe, and 2625p
($79.99 USD, $205 value)
●
Level 3 includes the new Prime Warframe, both prime weapons, two glyphs of the Primed Warframe, 3990p, and the Prime
Accessories Pack (see below)
(139.99 USD, $380 value)
●
The Prime Accessories Pack includes a new Primed Syandana/Sugatra, a new Primed Armor Set or Operator Armor Set, a 90
day affinity booster and a 90 day credit booster.
($49.99 USD, $110 value)
Note that while the weapons and Warframes are in the drop tables and do not require purchase to attain, the glyphs and cosmetics
in the Access Pack are unique to it and can only be obtained by purchasing the correct level of the Pack.
Once a level of Prime Access is purchased, you may return and buy additional levels at the cost they would be in total. For example,
if you bought the level 1 pack for $49,99, then returned to buy the level 2 pack, the level 2 pack would cost $29.99 instead of $79.99,
and would not include the items and Plat that were already in the level 1 pack.

About the Handbook
This handbook is written with the new or returning player in mind, but can be used by any Tenno, old or new. Its design is to give
the need to know/good to know information with as little fluff as possible. Its purpose is for quick information access, instead of
sifting through pages of Wiki articles or long drawn out YouTube videos.
The Warframe Handbook was originally created and written by DapperMuffin back in the early days of Warframe. After some
sharing around Reddit, it became the most used and accessed unofficial guide for Warframe. Around 2016, Warframe server
outages began popping up in Muffin’s area, and he wasn’t able to access the game. Since then the old Warframe Handbook hasn’t
been updated, but was still seen by hundreds of players every day.
In mid-2018, Je2ture gained creative rights from DapperMuffin to revise the old Handbook to match the current game build. After
some initial editing and updating, he recruited help from his clan, ZER0 TW0, who helped him finish it. It was then released for
public viewing in early December of 2018, with an able team behind it ready to update as needed.
The original V2.0 team left the project in late October 2021. The project lay dormant for a year until Aer started updating the
document again in October of 2022. -Apocalypto- also took ownership of the project from Je2ture at this time.
Today, the Warframe Handbook remains the most used unofficial text guide for Warframe. We hope you find it useful, and pass it on
to your friends and fellow players. From all of us here on the team, we wish you happy farming, Tenno!
