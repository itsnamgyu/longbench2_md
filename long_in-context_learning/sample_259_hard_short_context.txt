Getting Ready to Play
Either an AC adaptor or batteries can be used to power this 
Digital Keyboard. Normally, use of AC adaptor power is 
recommended.
• The AC adaptor does not come with this Digital Keyboard. 
Purchase it separately from your retailer. See page E-3 for 
information about options.
Use the AC adaptor when you want to power the Digital 
Keyboard from a household electrical outlet.
• Be sure to turn off Digital Keyboard power before 
connecting or disconnecting the AC adaptor.
• Be sure to turn off power before loading batteries.
• It is up to you to prepare six commercially available 
D-size batteries. Do not use oxyride batteries or any 
other nickel based batteries.
1. Open the battery cover on the bottom of the 
Digital Keyboard.
2. Load six D-size batteries into the battery 
compartment.
Make sure the positive + and negative - ends of the 
batteries are facing as shown in the illustration.
3. Insert the tabs of the battery cover into the 
holes on the side of the battery compartment, 
and close the cover.
■Low Battery Indication
The indicator shown below starts to flash to let you know 
when battery power is low. Replace the batteries with new 
ones.

Playing the Digital Keyboard
1. Press 1.
This turns on power.
2. Try playing something on the keyboard. Use 2 
to adjust volume.
• Turning off the Digital Keyboard causes most current 
settings to be cleared. The Digital Keyboard will revert 
to initial settings the next time you turn it on.
• This is true for all settings except for sample sound 
protection. Once you turn it on it remains on until you 
turn it off again.
While you are using batteries for power, power will turn off 
automatically if you do not perform any operation for about six 
minutes. Auto Power Off is disabled while the AC adaptor is 
being used for power.
■Disabling Auto Power Off
You can disable Auto Power Off to ensure that power is not 
turned off automatically during a concert, etc.
1. While holding down bp, turn on power.
Auto Power Off will be disabled.
Using headphones cuts off output from the built-in speakers, 
which means you can practice playing even late at night 
without disturbing others.
• Be sure to turn down the volume level before connecting 
headphones.
• Headphones do not come with the Digital Keyboard.
• Use commercially available headphones. See page E-3 for 
information about options.
• Do not listen to very high volume output over 
headphones for long period. Doing so creates the risk 
of hearing damage.
• If you are using headphones that require an adaptor 
plug, make sure you do not leave the adaptor plugged 
in when removing the headphones.

Touch Response alters tone volume in accordance with 
keyboard pressure (speed). This provides you some of the 
same expressivity you get on an acoustic piano.
■Sound intensity depends on the speed that keys 
are pressed.
People normally believe that the stronger the pressure applied 
to a piano keyboard, the louder the sound. Actually, however, 
the intensity of the notes played depends on the speed at 
which keys are pressed. Notes are louder when keys are 
pressed quickly, and quieter when keys are pressed slowly. 
Keeping this in mind as you play a keyboard musical 
instrument lets you control note volume without striving to 
apply too much pressure with your fingertips.
■The playability of an acoustic piano
Your Digital Keyboard provides you with key touch that is the 
next best thing to an acoustic piano. Note volume changes 
automatically in accordance with key press speed.
Use the procedure below to control how much the volume of 
played notes change in accordance with playing speed. 
Select the setting that best matches your playing style.
1. Press ct and then use the bs (10-key) [4] (
) 
and [6] (
) keys to display “Touch” (page 
E-6).
2. Use bs (10-key) [–] and [+] keys to select one of 
the three Touch Response sensitivity settings.
1. Press ct and then use the bs (10-key) [4] (
) 
and [6] (
) keys to display “OTHER” (page 
E-6).
2. Press bs (10-key) [7] (ENTER) key.
3. Use the bs (10-key) [4] (
) and [6] (
) keys 
to display “Contrast”.
4. Use the bs (10-key) [–] and [+] keys to adjust the 
contrast.
• The contrast setting range is 01 to 17.

The metronome lets you play and practice along with a steady 
beat to help keep you on tempo.
1. Press 7.
This starts the metronome.
2. Press 7 again to stop the metronome.
You can configure the metronome to use a bell sound for the 
first beat of each measure of the song you are playing.
• You can specify 0, or a value from 2 to 6 as the number of 
beat per measure.
• When playing a built-in song, the beats per measure setting 
(which determines when the bell sounds) is configured 
automatically for the currently selected song.
1. Hold down 7 until the beats per measure 
setting screen appears on the display.
• If you do not perform any operation for a few seconds 
after the beats per measure setting screen appears, the 
display will return to the screen displayed before you 
pressed 7.
2. Use bs (10-key) to enter the number of beats 
per measure.
• The bell will not sound if you specify 0 for this setting. In 
this case, all beats are indicated by a click sound. This 
setting lets you practice with a steady beat, without 
worrying how many beats there are in each measure.
Use the following procedure to change the tempo of the 
metronome.
1. Press bo.
Use y (slower) and t (faster) to change the tempo 
setting. Holding down either button changes the setting at 
high speed.
• Pressing t and y at the same time will initialize the 
tempo setting in accordance with the currently selected 
song or rhythm.
• Pressing bo causes the tempo value to flash on the 
display. While the tempo value is flashing, you can use 
bs (10-key) to change it.
Note that you must input leading zeros, so 89 is input 
as 089.
• The tempo value will stop flashing if you do not perform 
any operation for a short while.
The metronome volume setting is changed automatically with 
the volume level of the currently selected Auto 
Accompaniment or song. The metronome volume cannot be 
adjusted independently.
• For information about changing the Auto Accompaniment 
volume, see page E-40.
• For information about changing the song volume, see page 
E-28.
• You cannot adjust the balance between the metronome 
and note volume during Auto Accompaniment and built-in 
tune play.

Sampling Sounds and Playing Them on the Digital 
Keyboard
You can sample a sound from a microphone, a portable audio 
player, or other device, and then play the sound on the 
keyboard. For example, you could sample the bark of your 
dog and then use the sound in a melody. You also can sample 
and use passages from a CD. The sampling feature is a great 
way to create new sounds that are highly creative.
• Before connecting, make sure that the Digital 
Keyboard, external devices, and/or the microphone all 
are turned off.
1. Connect a microphone or external device to the 
Digital Keyboard.
• You also could connect a commercially available 
microphone.
• Connection of an external device requires commercially 
available connecting cords, supplied by you. Connecting 
cords should have a stereo mini plug on one end and a plug 
that matches the configuration of the external device on the 
other end.
2. Turn down the volume levels of the external 
device and the Digital Keyboard.
3. Turn on the external device or microphone, and 
then turn on the Digital Keyboard.
• When using a microphone, adjust the input volume 
level with 3.
• It will take a few seconds after you turn on the Digital 
Keyboard before you will be able to use the microphone.
• Sampled sounds are recorded in monaural.

also will stop automatically 10 seconds after it is 
started.
5. Play something on the Digital Keyboard.
• You may not be able to get 10 seconds of sampling if 
Digital Keyboard memory is low due to storage of other 
data. If this happens, deleting other memory data you no 
longer need will free up memory space and you should be 
able to sample for 10 seconds. See “Deleting a Sampled 
Sound” on page E-23 for more information.
• Sampling sound and storing it will delete any sound 
data currently stored under the same tone number. To 
help ensure that you do not accidentally delete 
important data, be sure to read “Protecting Against 
Accidental Deletion of Sampled Sounds” on page E-24.

Using Built-in Songs to Master Keyboard Play
To master a song, it is best to break it up into shorter parts 
(phrases), master the phrases, and then put everything 
together. Your Digital Keyboard comes with a Step Up Lesson 
feature that helps you to do just that.
The built-in songs are pre-divided into phrases to help you 
master keyboard play.
Step Up Lesson takes you through practice of the right hand 
part, left hand part, and both hand parts for each phrase of a 
song. Master all of the phrases and you master the song.

Using a Memory Card (WK-500 Only)
Your Digital Keyboard’s SD memory card 
slot makes it possible for you to store 
record memory and other data on a 
commercially available SD memory card.
●Supported SD Memory Cards
Your Digital Keyboard supports the use of memory cards up 
to 2 GB. Use of any SD memory card with greater capacity is 
not supported. See the instructions that come with the SD 
memory card for information about its capacity.
User data that can be saved and loaded
• Use only SD memory cards. Operation is not 
guaranteed when any other type of memory card is 
used.
• When using an SD memory card, make sure you 
observe all of the precautions in the instructions that 
come with it.
• SD memory cards have a write-protect switch that you 
can use to protect against accidental deletion of data.
• Avoid using an SD memory card under the following 
conditions. Such conditions can corrupt data stored on 
the memory card.
• Areas subjected to high temperature, high humidity, 
and corrosive gas
• Areas subjected to strong electrostatic charge and 
digital noise
• Never touch the contacts of an SD memory card when 
loading it or removing it from the Digital Keyboard.
• While data is being stored to or recalled from an SD 
memory card, never perform any other Digital 
Keyboard operation or remove the SD memory card. 
Doing so can corrupt the data on the card and damage 
the card slot.
• Never insert anything besides an SD memory card into 
the card slot. Doing so creates the risk of malfunction.
• Electrostatic charge discharging from your fingers or 
the SD memory card to the card slot can cause 
malfunction of the Digital Keyboard. If this happens, 
turn the Digital Keyboard off and then back on again.
• An SD memory card can become quite warm after very 
long use in the SD memory card slot. This is normal 
and does not indicate malfunction.

You can transfer sampled sounds, recorded songs, and other 
data in Digital Keyboard memory to a computer for storage. 
You also can load standard MIDI file (SMF) data, and Auto 
Accompaniment data you download from the CASIO website 
to the Digital Keyboard, which greatly expands the Song Bank 
songs and Auto Accompaniment patterns available to you.
A special Data Manager application is required in order to 
transfer data to and from the Digital Keyboard.
The same types of data that you can store to or recall from an 
SD memory card (page E-59) can be transferred to and from 
the Digital Keyboard. Note, that recorded song data can be 
transferred to a computer in the Digital Keyboard’s native 
format only. You cannot save recorded song data to a 
computer as a standard MIDI file (SMF format). With the 
WK-500 (only), you can save and recall scale memory data.
1. Go to the CASIO WORLDWIDE site at the 
following URL.
http://world.casio.com/
2. At the site, select a geographic area or country.
3. After accessing the area site, navigate to the 
minimum computer system requirements for 
Data Manager for this product.
• You should be able to find a link to Data Manager 
information on the product introduction page of this 
product. If you cannot find such a link, use the search 
form of the area site where you are located to enter the 
model name of this product and search for it.
• Note that site contents are subject to change without 
notice.
4. Check if your computer system complies with 
the minimum requirements for Data Manager.
5. Download Data Manager and its user’s guide to 
your computer.
6. Follow the procedure in the user’s guide that 
you downloaded in step 5 to install and use 
Data Manager.
• You can download accompaniment data from the 
Internet Data Expansion system of the CASIO MUSIC 
SITE (http://music.casio.com/) and load it into the 
memory of this Digital Keyboard. Note that there is not 
any accompaniment data intended specifically for this 
model, so you should use data for other models.
• Since the accompaniment data is for other models, you 
may experience some abnormalities when playing it on this 
model.
■Maintaining Data in Memory
After you save data in memory, it will remain there as long as 
power is supplied to the keyboard. However, if you disconnect 
the AC adaptor when there are no batteries loaded, saved 
data will be deleted.
Tips for Maintaining Data
• Use both batteries and the AC adaptor together.
• Make sure that batteries with sufficient power are loaded 
whenever you disconnect the AC adaptor.
• Connect the AC adaptor to the keyboard and plug it into a 
power outlet before replacing batteries.
Before connecting or disconnecting the AC adaptor or 
replacing batteries, first press 1 to turn off power.

A Step Up Lesson is in progress and the Digital Keyboard is waiting 
for you to play the next note in the song. To stop this from happening, 
cancel the lesson (page E-31).
Screen contents are visible only from straight ahead.
This is dues to production limitations. It does not indicate malfunction.
Sound
Nothing happens when I press any keyboard key.
• Adjust the main volume setting (page E-9).
• Check if something is plugged into en (WK-200: PHONES/
OUTPUT jack) (WK-500: PHONES jack) on the back of the Digital 
Keyboard.
• If there is no sampled sound in memory, nothing will play if you 
press a keyboard key while a tone in the range of 671 to 678 (WK-
200: 571 to 578) is selected (page E-18).
• Turn power off and then back on to initialize all keyboard settings 
(page E-9).
Nothing happens or notes do not play normally when 
I play notes on the left side of the keyboard.
Press bn to disable chord input in the accompaniment keyboard area 
(page E-37).
Nothing happens when I start an Auto 
Accompaniment.
• With rhythms 190, and 192 to 200 (WK-200: 170, and 172 to 180), 
nothing will sound until you play a chord on the keyboard. Try 
playing a chord (page E-37).
• Check and adjust the accompaniment volume setting (page E-40).
• If there is no user rhythm stored in memory, Auto Accompaniment 
will not start when you press bm while a rhythm in the range of 201 
to 210 (WK-200: 181 to 190) is selected (page E-42).
• Turn power off and then back on to initialize all Digital Keyboard 
settings (page E-9).
Nothing happens when I start playback of a built-in 
song.
• It takes a little time after you press the button until the song starts to 
play. Wait for a moment for the song to start.
• Check and adjust the song volume (page E-28).
• If there is no user song stored in memory, song playback will not 
start when you press bm while a song in the range of 153 to 162 is 
selected (page E-28).
• Turn power off and then back on to initialize all Digital Keyboard 
settings (page E-9).

• Turn power off and then back on to initialize all Digital Keyboard 
settings (page E-9).
Notes keep sounding, without stopping.
• Turn power off and then back on to initialize all Digital Keyboard 
settings (page E-9).
• Replace the batteries with new ones or switch over to AC adaptor 
power (page E-8).
Some notes are cut off while they are playing.
Notes are cut off whenever the number of notes being sounded 
exceeds the maximum polyphony value of 48 (24 for some tones). 
This does not indicate malfunction. See “Maximum Polyphony” in the 
“Tone List” in the separate “Appendix”.
The volume or tone setting I made has changed.
• Adjust the main volume setting (page E-9).
• Turn power off and then back on to initialize all Digital Keyboard 
settings (page E-9).

• Turn power off and then back on to initialize all Digital Keyboard 
settings (page E-9).
In certain keyboard ranges, the volume and tone 
quality sound are slightly different from those in other 
keyboard ranges.
This is due to system limitations. It does not indicate malfunction.
With some tones, octaves do not change at the far 
ends of the keyboard.
This is due to system limitations. It does not indicate malfunction.
The pitch of the notes does not match other 
accompanying instruments or sounds strange when 
played long with other instruments.
• Check and adjust the transpose (page E-15) and tuning settings 
(page E-15).
• Turn power off and then back on to initialize all Digital Keyboard 
settings (page E-9).
The reverb of notes seems to change suddenly.
• Check and adjust the reverb setting (page E-14).

settings (page E-9).
Operation
When I perform a skip forward or skip back 
operation, the skip operation moves multiple song 
measures instead of only a single measure.
While song playback is stopped or a Step Up Lesson is in progress, 
skip forward and skip back operations are performed in phrase units 
(page E-26).
Tone, rhythm, and other settings revert to their initial 
defaults whenever you turn on the Digital Keyboard.
Though Digital Keyboard settings reset when you turn off the Digital 
Keyboard, you can save setups to registration memory for instant 
recall whenever you need them (page E-46).
Computer Connection
I can’t exchange data between the Digital Keyboard 
and a computer.
• Check to make sure that the USB cable is connected to the Digital 
Keyboard and computer, and that the device is selected correctly 
with your computer’s music software settings (page E-65).
• Turn off the Digital Keyboard and then exit the music software on 
your computer. Next, turn the Digital Keyboard back on and then 
restart the music software on your computer.
