General
The digital multifunctional protection and bay controllers of the SIPROTEC 5 device series are fitted with
a powerful microprocessor. As a result, all tasks, from acquiring measurands to entering commands in the
circuit breaker, are processed digitally.
Analog Inputs
The measuring inputs transform the currents and voltages sent by the instrument transformers and adapt
them to the internal processing level of the device. A SIPROTEC 5 device consists of inputs for measuring
current and voltage. The current inputs are intended for the detection of phase currents (overhead contact
line and feeder line) . The voltage inputs detect the measuring voltage of device functions requiring voltage
measured values.
The analog values are digitized in the microprocessor for data processing.
Microprocessor System
All device functions are processed in the microprocessor system.
This includes, for example:
•
Filtering and preparation of the measurands
•
Constant monitoring of the measurands
•
Monitoring of the pickup conditions for the individual protection functions
•
Querying of limiting values and time sequences
•
Control of signals for logic functions
•
Control of open and close commands
•
Recording of indications, fault data, and fault values for fault analysis
•
Administration of the operating system and its functions, for example data storage, real-time clock,
communication, interfaces
•
External distribution of information
Binary Inputs and Outputs
Using the binary inputs and outputs, the device receives information from the system or from other devices
(such as locking commands). The most important outputs include the commands to the switching devices and
the indications for remote signaling of important events and states.
Front Elements
For devices with an integrated or offset operation panel, LEDs and an LC display on the front provide infor-
mation on the device function and report events, states, and measured values. In conjunction with the LC
display, the integrated keypad enables on-site operation of the device. All device information such as setting
parameters, operating and fault indications or measured values can be displayed, and setting parameters
changed. In addition, system equipment can be controlled via the user interface of the device.
Serial Interfaces
The serial interface in the front panel enables communication with a personal computer when using the DIGSI
operating program. As a result, the operation of all device functions is possible. Additional interfaces on the
rear are used to implement various communication protocols.
Power Supply
The individual functional units of the device are powered by an internal power supply. Brief interruptions in
the supply voltage, which can occur during short circuits in the system auxiliary voltage supply, are bridged by
capacitor storage (see also the Technical Data).

Embedding of Functions in the Device
General
SIPROTEC 5 devices offer great flexibility in the handling of functions. Functions can be individually loaded
into the device. Additionally, it is possible to copy functions within a device or between devices. The necessary
integration of functions in the device is illustrated by the following example.
i
i
NOTE
The availability of certain settings and setting options depends on the device type and the functions
available on the device!
EXAMPLE
The application of the 7ST86 on a 1-phase overhead contact line serves as an example. The following
protection functions are required for the application (simplified and reduced):
•
Distance protection (21)
•
Overcurrent protection, phases (51)
•
Circuit-breaker failure protection (50BF)
•
Basic functionality (handling of tripping, etc.)
Several predefined function packages that are tailored to specific applications exist for each device family. A
predefined functional scope is called an application template. The existing application templates are offered
for selection automatically when you create a new device in DIGSI 5.
EXAMPLE
When creating the device in DIGSI 5, you must select an application template. In the example, select the
application template 7ST86 overhead contact line 16.7 Hz. This application template covers the required
functional scope. Selecting this application template determines the preconfigured functional scope. This can
be changed on demand (see 2.2 Application Templates/Adaptation of Functional Scope).
Function Groups (FG)
Functions are arranged in function groups. This simplifies handling of functions (adding and copying). The
function groups are assigned to primary objects, such as a line, transformer, or circuit breaker.
The function groups bundle functions with regard to the following basic tasks:
•
Assignment of functions to currentand/or voltage transformers (assignment of functions to the meas-
uring points and thus to the protected object)
•
Exchange of information between function groups
When a function is copied into a function group, it automatically works with the measuring points assigned
to the function group. Their output signals are also automatically included in the configured interfaces of the
function group.
The number and type of function groups differ in the respective application templates, depending on the type
of the device and application. You can add, copy, or even delete function groups for a specific application.
You can also adapt the functional scope within a function group according to the use case. For detailed
information on this, refer to the DIGSI 5 Online Help manual.

EXAMPLE
The selected application template 7ST86 contact line 16.7 Hz contains 2 function groups:
•
Protection function group Contact line
•
Circuit-breaker function group QA
The following figure shows the embedding of functions via function groups.
[dwfkteb_7st86, 2, en_US]
Figure 2-1
Embedding the Functions via Function Groups
Depending on the type of device, there are different types of function groups:
•
Protection function groups
•
Circuit-breaker function groups
Protection function groups bundle functions that are assigned to one protected object – for example to the
contact line.
Circuit-breaker function groups bundle functions assigned to the local switches – for example, circuit breakers
and disconnectors (such as processing of tripping, circuit-breaker failure protection).
The number and type of function groups differ in the respective application templates, depending on the type
of the device and application. You can add, copy, or even delete function groups for a specific application.
You can also adapt the functional scope within a function group according to the use case. For detailed
information on this, refer to the DIGSI 5 Online Help manual.
Interface Between Function Group and Measuring Point
The function groups receive the measurands of the current and voltage transformers from measuring points.
For this, the function groups are connected to 1 or more measuring points.
The number of measuring points and the assignment of function groups to the measuring points are preset by
the selected application template in accordance with the specific application. Therefore, this specifies which

measuring point(s) and the corresponding measurands have to be used by which function within the function
group.
You can change the assignment on demand, that is, function groups can be assigned to any available
measuring points of the device.
To check or change the assignment of measuring points to the function groups, double-click Function-group
connections in the DIGSI 5 project tree.
[sc_projnav_7ST86, 1, en_US]

correspond to the example).
[sc_mpconnect_7ST86, 1, en_US]
Figure 2-3
Connecting Measuring Points and Function Groups
Interface Between Protection and Circuit-Breaker Function Groups
The protection function group(s) is/are connected to one or several circuit-breaker function groups. This
connection generally determines:
•
Which circuit breaker(s) is/are started by the protection functions of the protection FG.
•
Starting the Circuit-breaker failure protection function (if available in the Circuit-breaker function
group) through the protection functions of the connected protection function group
•
Starting the Automatic reclosing function (AREC, if available in the Circuit-breaker function group)
through the protection functions of the connected protection function group
These definitions are also set appropriately for the specific application by the selected application template.
EXAMPLE
The connection of the function group in the example shown in Figure 2-1 is as follows:
The protection function group Line is linked to the circuit-breaker function group Q0.

This means that an operate indication in the Distance protection function generates a trip command in
the circuit-breaker function group and thus triggers the circuit breaker. The function Circuit-breaker failure
protection is started in the Q0 circuit-breaker function group if it is configured.
Each stage, each function block, and each function (without stages/function blocks) can be individually
switched into specific operating modes (for example, switch on/off). This is termed function control and is
explained in 2.3 Function Control.
To adjust the functionality to the specific application, functions, stages, and function blocks can be added,
copied, and deleted (see 2.2 Application Templates/Adaptation of Functional Scope).

Application Templates/Adaptation of Functional Scope
Application Template
The application template defines the preconfigured functional scope of the device for a specific use case. A
certain number of application templates is predefined for each device type. DIGSI 5 automatically offers the
application templates for selection when a new device is installed. The available application templates with
the respective functional scope are described in more detail in 4 Applications.
The selection of the application template first predefines which function groups and functions are present in
the device (see also in 2.1 Embedding of Functions in the Device).
You can adjust the functional scope to your specific application.
Adjusting the Functional Scope
Adjust the functional scope based on the selected application template. You can add, copy or delete functions,
tripping stages, function blocks, or complete function groups.
In the DIGSI 5 project tree, this can be done via the following Editors:
•
Single-line configuration
•
Information routing
•
Function settings
Siemens recommends the Single-line configuration Editor to adjust the functional scope.
Complete missing functionalities from the Global DIGSI 5 Library. Then, the default settings of the added
functionality are active. You can copy within a device and between devices as well. Settings and routings are
also copied when you copy functionalities.
i
i
NOTE
If you delete a parameterized function group, function, or stage from the device, all settings and routings
will be lost. The function group, function, or tripping stage can be added again, but then the default
settings are active.
In most cases, the adaptation of the functional scope consists of adding and deleting functions, stages, and
function blocks. As previously described, the functions, tripping stages, and function blocks automatically
connect themselves to the measuring points assigned to the function group.
In few cases, it may be necessary to add a protection or circuit-breaker function group. These newly added
function groups do not contain (protection) functions. You must individually load the (protection) functions
for your specific application. You must also connect the protection or circuit-breaker function group to one
or more measuring points (see 2.1 Embedding of Functions in the Device). You must connect newly added
protection function groups to a circuit-breaker function group (see 2.1 Embedding of Functions in the Device).
Functions, tripping stages, function blocks, and function groups can be added up to a certain maximum
number. The maximum number can be found in the respective function and function-group descriptions.
Function Points
Function points (FP) are assigned to specific functions, but not to other functions. You can find more detailed
information in the description of application templates, in 4 Applications.
The device is supplied with the acquired function-point credit. Functions with function points can be loaded
into the device only within the available function-point credit. The functional scope cannot be loaded into the
device if the required number of points of the functional scope is higher than the function-point credit. You
must either delete functions or upgrade the function-point credit of the device.
In addition to function-point classes (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100 to 1400) beginning with firmware version
V09.20, any function-point values in the range from 0 to 5000 are supported as a credit in the device. Thus,
the precise function-point credit required can be loaded into the device by the Function-Point Manager. Alter-
natively, you can order classless devices with 0 points (new option beginning with V09.20) or class-bound
with the required function-point class.

Extending the Function-Point Credit
You can reorder function points if the function-point credit for the device is not enough or if you have ordered
a classless device with 0 points. Proceed as follows:
•
Determine the function-point requirement of certain functions, for example, with DIGSI 5 or the
SIPROTEC 5 Configurator.
•
Create a signed license file for your device with the SIPROTEC Function-Point Manager at www.siprotec-
function-point-manager.siemens.com or order the license file from your sales partner.
•
Once you have ordered the license file using the Function-Point Manager, you can download it from
there directly.
•
Once you have ordered the license file from your sales partner, you will receive it by e-mail or to
download.
•
Use DIGSI 5 to load the signed license file onto your device. The procedure is described in the Online Help
of DIGSI 5.

Function Control
Function control is used for:
•
Functions that do not contain stages or function blocks
•
Stages within functions
•
Function blocks within functions
i
i
NOTE
Simplifying functions and function control will be discussed in the following. The description also applies
to tripping stage control and function block control.
Functions can be switched to different operating modes. You use the parameter Mode to define whether you
want a function to run (on) or not (off). In addition, you can temporarily block a function. For the purpose of
commissioning, you can switch it into test mode (parameter Mode = test).
Devices with the activated IEC 61850 allow you to switch the operating mode by using the logical node
zero LLN0. Depending on the option LDevice Mod controllable1 in DIGSI 5 under Settings > Device
settings, the logical devices (as well as the child logical devices and logical nodes) can be set to one of the
following operating modes:
•
On
•
Off
•
Test
•
Relay blocked
•
Test/Relay blk.
The following table describes the relationship between the LLN0 and the setting LDevice Mod control-
lable.

With the setting LDevice Mod controllable being activated, the behavior of a logical device (as well as
the child logical devices and logical nodes) can be controlled also by the parameter SetMod (SetMod = on:
behavior = on; SetMod = off: behavior = off) of the LLN0.
The function shows the current status – such as an Alarm – via the Health signal.
For more details, refer to the Application Notes SIPROTEC 5 IEC 61850 Mod/Beh.
The following explains the different operating modes and mechanisms and how you set the functions into
these modes. The function control is shown in Figure 2-4. It is standardized for all functions. Therefore, this
control is not discussed further in the individual function descriptions.

General Control of a Function
State Control
You can control the state of a function via the parameter Mode, the controllable Mod and the input Superor-
dinate state.
The superordinate state is also influenced by the state of the superordinate logical devices (LD) of the
IEC 61850 structure.
You set the specified operating state of the function via the parameter Mode. You can set the function mode
to on, off and test. The operating principle is described in Table 2-2. You can set the parameter Mode via:
•
DIGSI 5
•
On-site operation at the device
•
Browser-based user interface
•
Certain systems control protocols (IEC 61850, IEC 60870-5-103)
You can also set the setpoint operating state of the function through the controllable Mod. You can set
the function mode to On, Off, Test, Relay blocked and Test/Relay blk.. The operating principle is
described in Table 2-2. You can set the controllable Mod via:
•
IEC 61850-8-1
•
CFC
The superordinate state can accept the values On, Relay blocked Test and Test/Relay blk..
The state of the function resulting from the parameter Mode, the controllable Mod and the Superordinate
state is shown in the following table. The resulting state of the function results from the combination
of all sources (parameter Mode, Controllable Mod and Superordinate state). For simplicity, the table
represents only the combination of 2 sources.

NOTE
The browser-based user interface shows an easy-to-read list of the states of all functions if they deviate
from the state On.
The following table describes the possible states of a function:
Table 2-2
Possible States of a Function
State of the
Function
Explanation
On
The function is activated and operating as defined. The prerequisite is that the health of the
function is OK.
Relay blocked
The function is activated and operating as defined. The prerequisite is that the health of the
function is OK. All outputs of messages of this function to relays are blocked.
Note:
Logics outside this function block, for example, superordinate group indications, are not
affected by the blocking. Their output to a relay continues to the control.

With the parameter (_:151) Oper.bin.outp. under test, you define whether functions in test mode can activate relay outputs. For
more information see Parameter: Oper.bin.outp. under test , Page 219

State of the
Function
Explanation
Test
The function is set to test mode. This state supports the commissioning. All output informa-
tion from the function (indications and, if present, measured values) is provided with a test
bit. This test bit significantly influences the further processing of the information, depending
on the target.
For instance, among other things, it is possible to implement the functionality Blocking of
the command relay known from SIPROTEC 4.
When leaving the state Test, functions that process measured values are briefly reset for
∼500 ms and blocked internally. This state is documented by the message Inactive and
other function-specific messages, where appropriate.
Target of the informa-
tion
Processing
Log
The indication is labeled as Test in the log.
Binary output
An indication routed to the binary outputs, which only controls
the switch contacts if the contacts are in the test state.
Light-emitting diode (LED) An indication routed to the LED triggers the LED (normal
processing)
CFC
Here, the behavior depends on the state of the CFC chart.
•
CFC chart itself is not in test state:
The CFC chart is not triggered by a status change of infor-
mation with a set test bit. The initial state of the informa-
tion (state before test bit was set) is not processed during
execution of the CFC chart.
•
CFC chart itself is in test state:
The CFC chart continues to process the information (indica-
tion or measured value) normally. The CFC output informa-
tion is provided with a test bit. The definitions in this table
apply to its continued processing.
A CFC chart can be set to the test state by switching the entire
device to test mode or by using the CHART_STATE CFC block to
switch a single CFC chart to Test mode.
Protocol
Indication and measured value are transmitted with set test bit,
provided that the protocol supports this functionality.
If an object is transmitted as a GOOSE message, the test bit is
set spontaneously and the GOOSE message is transmitted imme-
diately. The receiver of the GOOSE message is automatically noti-
fied of transmitter test mode.
If an object is transmitted via the protection interface, the test
bit is not transmitted. The Test state must also be transmitted
as information for this state to be taken into account in the
application on the receiver end. You must route the Test signal
in the DIGSI 5 project tree → Device → Communication routing.
The test mode of the differential protection is dealt with sepa-
rately in the application.
Test/Relay blk.
The function works as a described under Test. All output information (indications) of this
function which is routed to a relay is blocked.
All output information from the function (indications and, if present, measured values) is
provided with a test bit. This test bit significantly influences the further processing of the
information, depending on the target.
Logics outside this function block, for example, superordinate group indications, are not
affected by the blocking. If the state of these functions allows the processing of indications

State of the
Function
Explanation
with test bit (target function in the state Test or Test/Relay blk.), the output information
routed to a relay continues to the control of the relays.
Health
Health signals if a selected function can perform its designated functionality. If so, the health is OK. In case
the functionality is only possible in a limited way or not at all, due to state or problems within the device, the
health will signal Warning (limited functionality) or Alarm (no functionality).
Internal self-monitoring can cause functions to assume the Alarm health state (see 8 Supervision Functions).
If a function assumes the health state Alarm, it is no longer active (indication not active is generated).
Only a few functions can signal the health state Warning. The health state Warning results from function-
specific supervision and - where it occurs - it is explained in the function description. If a function assumes the
Warning status, it will remain active, that is, the function can continue to work in a conditional manner and
trip in the case of a protection function.
Not Active
The indication Inactive signals that a function is currently not working. The indication Inactive is active
in the following cases:
•
Function is disabled
•
The function is in the health state Alarm
•
Function is blocked by an input signal (see Figure 2-4)
•
All protection-function steps are switched off by way of the Switch on protection controllable
(state = false). The indication Protection inactive is active.
•
The function is briefly Inactive when exiting the state Test.
Blocking of the Operate Indication, No Fault Recording at Pickup
With the parameter Blk. Op. Ind. & Fault Rec. , you define whether a function works as a protection
or a monitoring function. Further, you use this to determine the type and scope of the logging (see following
table).
Parameter Value
Description
No
The function works as a protection function. It generates an operate indica-
tion and starts fault recording with pickup. During fault recording, a fault is
created and logged as a fault record in the fault log.
Yes
The function works as a supervision function. The logic runs normally,
but without creating the operate indication. The time-out indication is still
generated and can be processed further if necessary. No fault recording
starts with pickup.

NOTE
Use the IEC 61850 structure editor to assign the logical nodes (LN) of the stages of a function to different
logical devices (LD).
Always assign all LNs of a function to the same LD.

Text Structure and Reference Number for Settings and Indications
Each parameter and each indication has a unique reference number within every SIPROTEC 5 device. The
reference number gives you a clear reference, for example, between an indication entry in the buffer of
the device and the corresponding description in the manual. You can find the reference numbers in this
document, for example, in the application and setting notes, in the logic diagrams, and in the parameter and
information lists.
In order to form unique texts and reference numbers, each function group, function, function block/stage, and
indication or parameter has a text and a number. This means that structured overall texts and numbers are
created.
The structure of the texts and reference numbers follows the hierarchy:
•
Function group:Function:Stage/Function Block:Indication
•
Function group:Function:Stage/Function Block:Parameter
The colon serves as a structure element to separate the hierarchy levels. Depending on the functionality,
not all hierarchy levels are always available. Function Group and Stage/Function block are optional. Since the
function groups, functions as well as tripping stages/function blocks of the same type can be created multiple
times, a so-called instance number is added to these elements.
EXAMPLE
The structure of the text and reference number is shown in the protection-function group Line as an example
of the parameter Threshold value and the indication Pickup of the 2nd definite-time overcurrent protec-
tion stage of the function Overcurrent protection, phases (see Figure 2-5). Only one function and one
function group exist in the device. The representation of the stage is simplified.

Indications
General
During operation, indications deliver information about operational states. These include:
•
Measured data
•
Power-system data
•
Device supervisions
•
Device functions
•
Function procedures during testing and commissioning of the device
In addition, indications give an overview of important fault events after a failure in the system. All indications
are furnished with a time stamp at the time of their occurrence.
Indications are saved in logs inside the device and are available for later analyses. The following number of
indications are saved at least in the respective buffer (depending on the scope of the indications):
•
Operational log 2000 indications
•
Fault log 1000 indications
•
Switching-device log 2000 indications
•
User-defined log 200 indications
If the maximum capacity of the user-defined log or of the operational log is exhausted, the newest entries
overwrite the oldest entries. If the maximum capacity of the fault log is reached, the number of the last fault
is output via the signal Fault recording buffer is full. You can route this signal in the information routing.
If indications in the information routing of DIGSI 5 are routed to a log, then they are also saved. During a
supply-voltage failure, recorded data are securely held by means of battery buffering or storage in the flash
memory. You can read and analyze the log from the device with DIGSI 5. The device display and navigation
using keys allow you to read and analyze the logs on site.
Indications can be output spontaneously via the communication interfaces of the device and through external
request via general interrogation. In DIGSI 5, indications can be tracked spontaneously duringonline mode
in a special indication window. Indications can be made accessible to higher-level control systems through
mapping on various communication protocols.

NOTE
All indications are assigned to certain device functions. The text of each indication contains the corre-
sponding function designation. You can find explanations of the meaning of indications in the corre-
sponding device functions. However, you can also define indications yourself and group them into your
own function blocks. These can be set by binary inputs or CFC logic.
Reading Indications
To read the indications of your SIPROTEC 5 device you can use the on-site operation panel of the device or a PC
on which you have installed DIGSI 5. The subsequent section describes the general procedure.
Reading Indications on the On-Site Operation Panel
Procedure
The menus of the logs begin with a header and 2 numbers at the top right corner of the display. The number
after the slash signifies the number of indications that are available. The number before the slash indicates
how many indications have just been selected or shown. The end of the indication list is closed with the entry

via the Ethernet interfaces. It is also possible to access all connected SIPROTEC 5 devices via a data network
from your DIGSI 5 PC.
²
You reach the desired logs of the SIPROTEC 5 device using the project-tree window. If you have not
created the device within a project, you can also do this via the Online access menu item.
After selecting the desired log, you are shown the last state of the log loaded from the device. To update, it is
necessary to synchronize with the log in the device.
²
Synchronize the log. For this purpose, click the appropriate button in the headline of the log (see the
ground-fault indications example in Figure 3-2 a)).

in the information routing. If indications in the information routing of DIGSI 5 are routed to a log, then they
are also saved. During a supply-voltage failure, recorded data are securely held by means of battery buffering
or storage in the flash memory. You can read and analyze the log from the device with DIGSI 5. The device
display and the navigation allow you to read and evaluate the logs on site using keys.
Configurability of Logs
The indication capacity to be recorded in configurable logs (for example, ground-fault log) is laid down in
columns of the information routing (matrix) of DIGSI 5 specifically defined for this purpose.
Procedure
To reach the information routing of your SIPROTEC 5 device, use the project-tree window. Access is only
through the project:
•

For non-configurable logs (for example, setting-history logs) scope and type of logged indications are
described separately (see following chapter about logs).
Operational Log
Operational indications are information that the device generates during operation. This includes information
about:
•
State of device functions
•
Measured data
•
Power-system data
Exceeding or dropping below limiting values is output as an operational indication. Short circuits in the
network are indicated as an operational indication Fault with sequential fault number. For detailed informa-
tion about the recording of system incidents, refer to the description of the fault log (chapter 3.1.5.3 Fault
Log). Up to 2000 indications can be stored in the operational log.

Deletability
The operational log of your SIPROTEC 5 device can be deleted. This is done usually after testing or commis-
sioning the device. To know more about this, read chapter 3.1.6 Saving and Deleting the Logs.
Configurability
The indication scope of the operational log is configured in a specifically defined column of the information
routing (matrix) of DIGSI 5:
Target → Log → Operational log column
Selected application templates and functions from the library bring with them a predefined set of operational
indications which you can adjust individually at any time.
Fault Log
Fault indications are events which arise during a fault. They are logged in the fault log with real-time stamp
and relative-time stamp (reference point: fault occurrence) . Faults are numbered consecutively in rising order.
With fault recording engaged, a corresponding fault record with the same number exists for every fault logged
in the fault log. A maximum of 128 fault logs can be stored. A maximum of 1000 indications can be recorded
in each fault log.
Fault Definition
In general, a fault is started by the raising pickup of a protection function and ends with the cleared pickup
after the trip command.
When using an automatic reclosing function, the complete reclosing cycle (successful or unsuccessful) is
preferably integrated into the fault. If evolving faults appear within reclosing cycles, the entire clearing
process is logged under one fault number even in multiple pickup cycles. Without automatic reclosing function
every pickup is also recorded as its own fault.
User-defined configuration of a fault is also possible.
i
i
NOTE
The definition of the fault is done through settings of the fault recording (see Device manual). Events are
logged in the fault log even when fault recording is switched off.
Apart from the recording of fault indications in the fault log, spontaneous display of fault indications of the
last fault on the device display is also done. You will find details about this in chapter 3.1.8 Spontaneous Fault
Display on the On-Site Operation Panel.

Configurability
The indication scope of the fault log is configured in a specifically defined column of the information routing
(matrix) of DIGSI 5:
Target → Log → Fault log column
Selected application templates and functions from the library already bring a predefined set of operational
indications with them which you can adjust individually at any time.
The operational measured values and the measured values of the fundamental components and symmetrical
components (see Device Manual) are calculated every 9 cycles (at 50 Hz, this is every 180 ms). However, this
can mean that the data are not synchronized with the sampled values of the analog channels. The recording
of these measured values can be used to analyze the slowly changing processes.
User Log
With the user-defined log (up to 2), you have the possibility of individual indication logging parallel to the
operational log. This is helpful, for example, in special monitoring tasks but also in the classification into
different areas of responsibility of the logs. Up to 200 indications can be stored in the user-defined log.

After a fault, the most important data of the last fault can be displayed automatically on the device display
without further operational measures. In SIPROTEC 5 devices, protected objects and even circuit breakers
can be freely created and configured depending on the application (even several instances). In DIGSI 5,
several spontaneous fault displays can be configured, depending on the application, with each individual one
being assigned a particular circuit breaker. These displays remain stored in the device until they are manually
confirmed or released by LED reset.

Measured-Value Acquisition
Basic Principle
SIPROTEC 5 devices are equipped with a powerful measured-value acquisition function. In addition to a
high sampling frequency, they have a high measurand resolution. This ensures a high degree of measuring
accuracy across a wide dynamic range. The 24-bit sigma/delta analog-digital converter represents the core of
measured-value acquisition. In addition, the oversampling function supports the high measurand resolution.
Depending on the requirements of the individual method of measurement, the sampling frequency is reduced
(Downsampling).
In digital systems, deviations from the rated frequency lead to additional errors. In order to avoid this, 2
algorithm-dependent processes are used in all SIPROTEC 5 devices:
•
Sampling-frequency tracking:
The analog input channels are scanned for valid signals in cycles. The current power frequency is deter-
mined and the required sampling frequency is defined by using a resampling algorithm. The tracking is
active in the frequency range from frated ± 20 %.
•
Fixed sampling frequency – correction of the filter coefficients:
The power frequency is determined and, depending on the degree of the frequency deviation, the filter
coefficients are corrected. This methodology is used for the Distance protection and Line differential
protection functions.
The following figure shows the basics of dealing with sampled values in the measured-value acquisition
chain. Figure 3-26 shows to whom the various sampling frequencies are made available. In order to limit
the bandwidth of the input signals, a low-pass filter (anti-aliasing filter to maintain the sampling theorem)
is installed downstream. After sampling, the current input channels are adjusted. Meaning that magnitude,
phase, and transformer time constant are corrected. The compensation is designed to ensure that the current
transformer terminal blocks can be exchanged between the devices. In devices with a rated frequency of
16.7 Hz, you can only use the current transformer terminal blocks of other 16.7 Hz devices.
[dwmeser2-200612-01.tif, 1, en_US]
Figure 3-26
Measured-Value Acquisition Chain
The internal sampling frequency of the SIPROTEC 5 devices is fixed at 16 kHz (sampling rate: 320 samplings
per 50 Hz cycle and 958 samplings per 16.7 Hz cycle). All current and voltage inputs are sampled. If magni-
tude, phase, and transformer time constant are corrected, the sampling frequency is reduced to 8 kHz (160
samplings per 50-Hz cycle). This is the basic sampling frequency to which various processes, such as fault
recording, RMS measured values, refer. If magnitude, phase, and transformer time constant are reduced,
the sampling frequency is reduced to 8 kHz (479 samplings per 16.7-Hz cycle). This is the basic sampling
frequency to which various processes, such as fault recording, RMS measured values, refer. For the RMS

measurement, the measured-value window is adjusted on the basis of the power frequency. For numerous
measurement and protection applications , 2060 samplings per cycle are sufficient (if frated = 50 Hz), at
16.7 Hz: sampling every 1 ms, at frated = 60 Hz: sampling every 0.833 ms). This sampling rate is an adequate
compromise between accuracy and the parallel processing of the functions (multi-functionality).
The 20 samplings per cycle will be made available to the algorithms processed in the function groups in
2 variants:The 60 samplings per cycle if frated = 16.7 Hz or 20 samplings per cycle if frated = 50 Hz will be made
available to the algorithms processed in the function groups in 2 variants:

Sampling-Frequency Tracking
SIPROTEC 5 devices are equipped with powerful sampling-frequency tracking as explained in 3.2 Measured-
Value Acquisition . This ensures high measuring accuracy in a frequency operating range of frated ± 20 %.
To determine the actual sampling frequency, the voltage and current measuring points are checked for valid
input signals, the actual power frequency is determined and the tracking frequency is adapted. The method
is implemented in such a way that the number of samplings per actual power frequency or the frequency of
the system is always constant. The number of samplings is 20 per cycle, as described in 3.2 Measured-Value
Acquisition .
During engineering, you set the parameters specifying which measuring points are used for frequency
tracking. All 3-phase voltage and current measuring points and 1-phase voltage and current measuring points
are allowed.
i
i
NOTE
Using a measuring point for sampling-frequency tracking requires this measuring point to be suitable
for reliably determining the power frequency. This is the case, as long as the measuring point has been
connected to the power system and the rated voltages and currents are measured. If the measured values
for the rated voltages and currents are unavailable, sampling-frequency tracking must be switched off for
this measuring point.
The following figure shows where you set the parameters for the corresponding measuring point and activate
sampling-frequency tracking in the DIGSI 5 project tree under Settings → Power-system data.
[sc_MP_Powersys trackfreq 7ST86, 1, en_US]
Figure 3-27
Using the Measuring Point to Determine the Sampling Frequency
If the parameter Tracking = active, the measuring point is used to determine the actual tracking
frequency. If the parameter Tracking is set to active for several measuring points, the ID of the measuring
point determines the sequence in which these are checked for valid input signals. The algorithm starts with
the lowest ID number, as follows:
•
First, the measuring points of the contact line are scanned. If no valid voltage is found, the selected
current measuring points are next. In this case, the following sequence applies:
Measuring point V-FL → Measuring point I-FL → Measuring point 1-phase voltage → Measuring point
1-phase current
If a trigger signal comes from a current measuring point, the voltage measuring points are still continu-
ously scanned for valid voltages and switched immediately if a voltage is found.
•
If the true RMS value is greater than 2.5 % of the set secondary device rated value, a measuring point is
valid. For example, this is 2.5 V at 100 V, 25 mA at 1 A or 125 mA at 5 A.

•
The tracking frequency is tracked using different interval steps. If the tracking frequency deviates only
slightly from the measured frequency, the frequency is tracked using small steps of 0.010 Hz. In the case
of greater deviations, the interval is 1 Hz. To react faster in the event of larger deviations, for example
in switchover conditions, tracking occurs in 5-Hz steps. When switching on measurands immediately the
measured tracking frequency is used.
•
If no tracking frequency can be determined, the appropriate rated frequency of the electrical power
system is used as the tracking frequency. This case occurs before the measurands are switched on, after
they are switched off or when the device is powered on. If the measurands are switched on, the starting
frequency is the set power frequency, for example 50 Hz or 60 Hz. Since rated-frequency input variables
can be assumed for most applications, the measuring algorithms start with the fixed sampling frequency,
for example, 1 kHz for 50 Hz and 1.2 kHz for 60 Hz.

Processing Quality Attributes
Overview
The IEC 61850 standard defines certain quality attributes for data objects (DO), the so-called Quality. The
SIPROTEC 5 system automatically processes some of these quality attributes. In order to handle different
applications, you can influence certain quality attributes and also the values of the data objects depending on
these quality attributes. This is how you can ensure the necessary functionality.
The following figure describes roughly the general data flow within a SIPROTEC 5 device. The following figure
also shows at which points the quality can be influenced. The building blocks presented in the figure are
described in more detail in the following.
[lo_quali1, 2, en_US]
Figure 3-28
Data Flow within a SIPROTEC 5 Device
Supported Quality Attributes
The following quality attributes are automatically processed within the SIPROTEC 5 system.
•
Validity using the values good or invalid
The Validity quality attribute shows if an object transferred via a GOOSE message is received (valid,
invalid) or not received (invalid). The invalid state can be suppressed in the receiver device by also
setting a substitute value for the object that is not received (see 3.4.2 Quality Processing/Affected by the
User for Received GOOSE Values). The substitute value is forwarded to the functions.
If the device receives one of these values, it is replaced by the invalid value and thus processed further
as invalid.
If one of the detailed quality attributes (detailQual) has the value TRUE, then Validity is set to the
invalid value, unless this was already done at the transmitter end.
•
Test using the values TRUE, FALSE
The Test quality attribute indicates to the receiver device that the object received via a GOOSE message
was created under test conditions and not operating conditions.

C53000-G5040-C028-2, Edition 07.2024


•
OperatorBlocked using the values TRUE, FALSE
The OperatorBlocked quality attribute indicates whether an object transferred via GOOSE message
originates from a device that is in a functional logoff state. When the sending device is switched
off, the object is no longer being received and assumes the invalid state. However, since the Opera-
torBlocked quality was previously identified on the receiver device, the object can be treated differently
at the receiving end (see 3.4.2 Quality Processing/Affected by the User for Received GOOSE Values). At
the receiving end, the object may be treated like a dropped signal.
•
Source using the values process, substituted
The Source quality attribute indicates whether the object was updated in the sending device.
You can find more detailed information in 3.9.2 Acquisition Blocking and Manual Updating.
Influencing Quality by the Operating Modes
In addition to the normal operation, the device also supports further operating modes that influence quality:
•
Test mode of the device
You can switch the entire device to test mode. In this case, all data objects generated in the device (state
values and measured values) receive the quality attribute Test = TRUE.
The CFC charts are also in test mode and all output data receive the quality attribute Test =TRUE.
•
Test mode for individual functions, stages, or function blocks
You can switch individual functions, stages, or function blocks into test mode. In this case, all data
objects generated by the function, stage, or function block (state values and measured values) receive
the quality attribute Test = True.
•
Functional logoff of the device
If you take the device out of operation and want to isolate it from the supply voltage, you can function-
ally log off the device ahead of time. Once you functionally log off the device, all data objects generated
in the device (state values and measured values) receive the quality attribute OperatorBlocked =TRUE.
This also applies to the output from CFC charts.
If objects are transferred via a GOOSE message, the receiver devices can assess the quality. The receiver
device detects a functional logoff of the transmitting device. After shutting down the sending device,
the receiver device identifies that the sending device has been logged off operationally and did not
fail. Now the receiving objects can automatically be set to defined states (see chapter 3.4.2 Quality
Processing/Affected by the User for Received GOOSE Values).
•
Switching off individual functions, stages, or function blocks
You can switch off individual functions, stages, or function blocks. In this case, all data objects generated
by the function, stage, or function block (state values or measured values) receive the device-internal
quality attribute Off. The states of the inputs and measured values remain unchanged in this case; input
changes are not processed. As the quality attribute Off is not provided for in communication protocol
IEC 61850, the data objects are transferred with the quality attribute Invalid.
Influencing the Quality through Hardware Supervision
Supervision functions monitor the device hardware (see 8.4 Supervision of the Device Hardware). If the
supervision functions identify failures in the data acquisition of the device, then all recorded data will receive
the quality attribute Validity = invalid.
Influencing the Quality through Voltage-Transformer Circuit Breakers
If tripping of the voltage-transformer circuit breaker is detected (see 8.3.4 Voltage-Transformer Circuit
Breaker), all recorded data will receive the quality attribute Validity = invalid.

Influencing the Quality by the User
You can influence the processing of data and their quality differently. In DIGSI 5, this is possible at the
following 3 locations:
•
In the Information routing editor for external signals from GOOSE connections
•
In the CFC chart
•
In the Information routing editor for binary input signals of device-internal functions
The following chapters describe in more detail the options regarding this influence as well as the automatic
quality processing.
If a GOOSE connection is the data source of a binary input signal of a device-internal function, you can
influence processing of the quality at 2 locations: at the GOOSE connection and at the input signal of
the function. This is based on the following: A GOOSE date can be distributed within the receiving device
to several functions. The GOOSE connection setting (influence) affects all functions. However, if different
functions require customized settings, these are then set directly at the binary input signal of the function.
Quality Processing/Affected by the User for Received GOOSE Values
The properties of quality processing have changed with the introduction of GOOSE Later Binding. You can
find information about the former quality processing in Previous Quality Processing/Affected by the User for
Received GOOSE Values, Page 81.
In the Information Routing Editor, you can influence the data value and quality of all data types. The
following figure shows the possible influence using the example of a DPC data type. All setting options are
effective for the device receiving the data.

Description
Apply safe state value
The value configured in the Safe state is forwarded as valid to the
application as soon as communication disturbance occurs.
Keep value
The disturbed quality attribute is overwritten with good and the received
value is forwarded as valid to the application. If no value was received,
the output value is assumed being in safe state.
Keep last valid value
If an invalid quality attribute is received, the last valid value is forwarded
to the application. If no value has yet been received, the output value is
assumed being in safe state.
Set value to "false"
Applies only to Boolean communication objects. Every invalid quality
attribute causes the valid value false to be forwarded to the applica-
tion.

NOTE
By default, the Keep flag checkbox is disabled when the signal is routed to the LED or the binary output.
Functional Logoff by Operator Blocked
You have set the Operation mode to Device logoff = true in the transmitting device. As a result,
every indication issued from the functions and subject to Device logoff is transmitted with the quality
information operator blocked and Validity = good. The receiver recognizes this for this indication and
reacts according to the settings (Table 3-8). A different quality processing can take place only once you have
set the Operation mode to Device logoff = false in the transmitting device.
Communication Outage
There is communication disturbance (time allowed to live) between the transmitter and the receiver indicated
by the transmitter. The indication is set in accordance with the settings (Table 3-8).
Invalidity
The transmitting device sends this indication with the quality information Validity = invalid. The receiver
recognizes this for this indication and reacts according to the settings (Table 3-8).
Questionable
The transmitting device sends this indication with the quality information Validity = questionable. The
receiver recognizes this for this indication and reacts according to the settings (Table 3-8).
Test Mismatch
The transmitting device or the function in the transmitting device that issues this indication is in test mode. As
a result, the indication is transmitted with the quality information test. The receiving function block recog-
nizes this for this indication and reacts, depending on its own test-mode state (specified in IEC 61850-7-4
Annex A), according to the settings (Table 3-8).

NOTE
Follow the sequence of tests. First, the Functional logoff by operator blocked is tested. Then comes
Communication outage and so on. If a case is recognized as active, the test chain is canceled with the
configured setting for the active case.
In the case of Invalidity, the tests are first performed for Functional logoff by operator blocked (not
applicable) and then for Communication outage (not applicable) and canceled with the configured action for
Invalidity.
If an indication is routed into the log, manual updating of a value is also logged based on the conditions listed
above and on the reason for the manual update. Manually updating a value based on the conditions listed

quality of CFC charts in a Manual or Automatic (default setting) manner.
If you select Manual, the quality attribute of the CFC chart is always valid regardless of the quality of
individual signals (Validity = good)!
Only the Test quality attribute of the CFC chart is processed. If the device is in test mode or the input TEST of
the CHART_STATE CFC building block is set, the quality attribute of the CFC chart is set to Test.
If you select Automatic, the quality processing of the CFC charts is influenced as follows:

General Processing
Most of the CFC building blocks do not have an explicit quality processing. For these building blocks, the
following general mechanisms shall apply.
Quality Attribute: Validity
If one invalid signal is received in the case of CFC input data, then all CFC output data will also be
set to invalid if they originate from building blocks without explicit quality processing. In other words,
the quality is not processed sequentially from building block to building block but the output data are set
globally.
This does not apply to CFC output data that originate from building blocks with explicit quality processing
(see next section).
Quality Attribute: Test
CFC chart is in normal state.
CFC input data with the Test = TRUE attribute are ignored. When
the CFC chart is executed, then the data value that was used
before the Test = TRUE attribute is used. The quality of this old
value is also processed.
This means that on the output side, the attribute Test = FALSE.
CFC chart is in Test1) state.
If the CFC chart is executed, then the attribute Test = TRUE is
set for all data leaving the CFC chart. This does not depend on
whether the data are formed via CFC building blocks with or
without quality processing.
1)A CFC chart can be switched to the test state by switching the entire device to test mode or the input TEST of
the CFC building block CHART_STATE is set.
Quality Attribute: OperatorBlocked
CFC chart is in normal state.
In CFC charts for incoming data, the OperatorBlocked attribute
is ignored.
CFC chart is in functionally logged off1)
state .
In CFC charts for incoming data, the OperatorBlocked attribute
is ignored. All CFC output data are labeled as functionally logged
off.
1) This state only occurs if the device is functionally logged off. In this case, the quality attributes of all CFC

The first 3 building blocks (x_SPS) process the quality automatically according to the stated logic. The other
building blocks are used to isolate the quality from a data object and add them back after separate logical
processing.

The building blocks also process the supported quality attributes according to their logic.
The following tables describe the logic using input values in connection with the quality
attribute Validity. The input values are 0 or 1, the quality attribute Validity can have the
value good (=g) or invalid (=i).

The output thus has the logical value 1 with Validity = good as soon as at least 1 input has

SPLIT_SPS

The building blocks isolate the data value and quality of a data object.
The requirement is that the quality is available from the input end. This is the case if the
building block is interconnected with CFC input data, or is connected downstream with a
quality processing building block (x_SPS). In other cases, the CFC editor does not allow a
connection.
SPLIT_Q
The building block performs binary separation of the quality into good, bad (= invalid),
test, off and OperatorBlocked.
These 5 attributes can then be processed individually in a binary operation. The building
block must be connected downstream to a SPLIT_(DO) building block.

Building Blocks Description
BUILD_Q
The building block enters a binary value for good and bad (= invalid) in each quality
structure. Thus, with this building block the quality attributes good and bad (=invalid)
can be set explicitly, for example, as the result of a monitoring logic.
All other quality attributes are set to the default state, for instance, Test = FALSE. If, for
example, the entire CFC chart is in the test state (see Quality Attribute: Test Under General
Processing), this default status can again be overwritten on the CFC output side.
The building block is normally connected downstream to a BUILD_(DO) building block.
BUILD_ACD
BUILD_ACT
BUILD_BSC
BUILD_DPS
BUILD_ENS
BUILD_SPS
BUILD_XMV
These building blocks merge data value and quality. The building-block output is generally
used as a CFC output.
Generally, the BUILD_Q building block is connected upstream from these building blocks.
CFC charts have a standard behavior in the processing of signals. If an input signal of the CFC chart has the
quality invalid, all output signals of the CFC chart also get the quality invalid. This standard behavior is
not desirable in some applications. If you use the building blocks for quality processing, the quality attributes
of the input signals in the CFC chart are processed.
EXAMPLE: Switchgear Interlocking via GOOSE
The following conditions apply to the example:
•
The interlocking condition for switchgear interlocking protection is stored in the device as a CFC chart.
•
The removed device sends the release signal for the interlocking condition via a GOOSE telegram.
If the communication connection has been interrupted, the release signal (GOOSEStr) incoming via the
GOOSE telegram gets the quality invalid. If the CFC chart obtains an invalid input signal, there are the
following possibilities: The last signal valid before the communication interruption is used (quality = good) or
a substitute data value with the quality good is used (True, False).
To do this, you have to create a separate CFC chart in addition to the interlocking plan of the switchgear
interlocking. Use the building blocks for quality processing in a separate CFC chart. With the SPLIT_SPS
building block, split the input signal (data type = SPS) into data value and quality information. You can then
continue to process these signals separately in the CFC chart. Use the quality information as an input signal
for a BUILD_SPS building block and assign the quality good to the signal. You obtain an SPS signal as a result,
with the quality good. You can use this to process release messages correctly. You can process the release
messages with the quality good in the CFC chart of the actual interlocking. Therefore, the release signal for
a switch illustrated in the interlocking logic is available as a valid result with the quality good. The following
figure shows an example of the CFC chart with the building blocks for quality processing:

CFC Chart with Building Blocks for Quality Processing (Switchgear Interlocking via GOOSE)
If you do not want to convert the invalid release signal to a valid signal, as described, during the communica-
tion interruption, you can also assign a defined data value to the release signal. Proceed as follows: With the
SPLIT_SPS building block, split the input signal (data type = SPS) into data value and quality information. Link
the VALID output of the SPLIT_SPS building block with the data value of the input signal (AND gate). This way,
you can set the value to a non-risk state with the valid input signals. In the example, the output of the CFC
chart is set to the value FALSE when the input signal is invalid.
Quality Processing/Affected by the User in Internal Device Functions
Figure 3-35 provides an overview for processing the quality of data objects within a device-internal function.
A function can receive internal data or input data that is routable by the user (binary input signal or double
commands). The respective quality attributes supported are evaluated by the function on the input side. The
attributes are not passed through the specific algorithm/the specific logic of the function. The output data are
supplied with a quality that is specified by the function state and device-operating mode.

Fault Recording
Overview of Functions
All SIPROTEC 5 devices have a fault memory in which fault recordings are kept securely. Fault recording
documents operations within the power system and the way in which protection devices respond to them.
You can read out fault recordings from the device and analyze them afterwards using evaluation tools such as
SIGRA.
A fault record contains the following information:
•
Sample values of the analog input channels
•
Measured values calculated internally
•
Any binary signals (for example, pickup signals and trip signals of protection functions)
You can individually configure the signals to be recorded. Furthermore, you can define the starting condition,
the record duration, and the saving criterion of a recording. Fault records saved in the device are also available
after a loss of auxiliary voltage.
Structure of the Function
The Fault recorder function is a central device function. Both the recording criterion and the measured-value
and binary channels to be recorded are functionally preconfigured through the application templates. You are
able to individually adapt the configuration in DIGSI 5. The fault recording and the fault log are subject to the
same control. This ensures that real time, relative time, and numbering of the fault data are synchronized.
This means that all fault recordings function on the same real-time and relative-time basis.
The data read out via the DIGSI-PC are saved in COMTRADE format. Fault recording data can be transferred
to the substation automation technology by request in accordance with the standards via existing commu-
nication connections (such as IEC 61850, IEC 60870-5-103). The central device analyzes the data using
appropriate programs.
Function Description
The Fault recorder function records the sampled values, specific to each device, of all analog inputs, the
internally calculated measured values, and the binary signals. The configuration, which is predefined for each
device via an application template, can be adapted individually.
i
i
NOTE
For detailed information about selecting and deleting fault records, refer to the Operating Manual
(C53000-G5040-C003).
The fault memory of the device is automatically updated with every recording. When the fault memory is filled
completely, the oldest recordings are overwritten automatically. Thus, the most recent recordings are always
stored safely. The maximum number of recordings is 128.
Sampling Frequency
The analog measuring channels are sampled at a different sampling rate for fault recording. The Sampling
frequency parameter is used to set the desired sampling frequency. Possible setting values are 1 kHz, 2 kHz,
4 kHz, and 8 kHz . This setting value applies only to fault recording and does not affect protection functions or
calculated measured values.

Record Duration
The overall duration of a single fault recording comprises the total duration of the configurable recording
criterion, the Pre-trigger time and the Post-trigger time . You can set the parameters for these
components individually.
[dw_sigrar, 2, en_US]
Figure 3-38
Example of a Fault Recording
With the Fault recording parameter, you specify the start criterion of the recording.
You can set the following values:
•
with pickup:
The fault recording records the complete fault until dropout. The resulting pickup signals of all function
groups are taken into account.
•
with pickup & AR cyc.:
In connection with an active automatic reclosing function (internal/external), the fault recordings record
the fault including the short and long interruptions (automatic reclosing cycles).
•
user-defined:
With this setting value, you can individually specify the recording criterion for the fault recording in
DIGSI 5. Function-specific recording criteria can be realized in this way.
If a recording criterion reoccurs during the pickup time and post-trigger time, the recording which is currently
active is extended to include a new post-trigger time.
For a sampling frequency of 8 kHz and 24 analog channels to be recorded, the duration of one individual fault
recording can be up to 20 s.
The maximum record duration can be limited by the Maximum record time parameter.
In addition to starting the fault recording via the pickup, the following alternatives are possible:
•
Externally via binary input signal >External start (for example, from an external protection device
without fault recording by an object transferred via a GOOSE message)
•
By way of a configurable input signal >Manual start, you can start fault records with a configurable
length (parameter Manual record time).
•
From DIGSI 5, you can start test fault records with a fixed length of 1 s.
•
With a command from a central device via an existing communication connection (IEC 61850,
IEC 60870-5-103)
i
i
NOTE
If a pickup signal is present continuously, the fault record is closed after the Maximum record time
expires and the fault recording is not restarted!

Saving the Recording
Not every fault recording that is started actually needs to be saved. With the Storage parameter, you specify
whether you want to save the fault recording that has started. You can also save only fault data for which
the pickup of a protection function also caused a tripping . With this setting, faults beyond the self-protection
range will not lead to replacing fault recordings that have already been saved.
Configuration of Signals to Be Recorded
All analog inputs of the device that have been configured (currents and voltages) are recorded as sampled
channels.
Function-specific binary signals (for example, pickup and trip signals) and measured value channels can be
configured individually for recording in the DIGSI information-routing matrix. For this purpose, a separate
Recorder column is available.
You can rename the signals in the DIGSI Information-routing matrix. You can change the order of the binary
signals and measured-value channels to be recorded in DIGSI under Signal order. You can find more detailed
information on this in the DIGSI 5 Online Help, version V07.50 and higher (Order number: C53000-D5000-
C001-D).
The operational measured values and the measured values of the fundamental components and symmetrical
components are calculated every 9 cycles (at 50 Hz, this is every 180 ms). However, this can mean that the
data is not synchronized with the sampled values of the analog channels. The recording of these measured
values can be used to analyze the slowly changing processes.
Numbering and Time Stamping
All fault recordings saved are automatically numbered in ascending order and assigned a real-time stamp for
the start time. The fault recording logs the fault with a relative time. The reference-time point is the start of
the recording. Every fault recording has a corresponding fault log with the same number. This ensures that the
fault recording can be uniquely assigned to the event log.
i
i
NOTE
When the Fault recorder function detects a negative time stamp of the measurand or the binary signal, an
entry is added in the Device-diagnosis log in DIGSI. Meanwhile, the fault recording continues. The entry
for an incorrect measurand or binary signal shows the prefix Bad quality.
Fault Memory
The device manages its available fault memory dynamically, so that the maximum recording capacity is always
available. When exceeding the limits of the fault memory, the oldest recordings are automatically overwritten.
This means that the most recent recordings are always available. The sampling rate, type, and number of
measured value trends to be recorded are the crucial variables when it comes to restricting the length and
number of recordings possible. Parallel to the sampled tracks, up to 50 tracks with function-specific measured
values and up to 200 binary tracks can be recorded. The following table provides an overview of the maximum
storage capacities, in seconds, for different connection variations of the protection devices.

Protection Communication
Overview
The Protection communication includes all functionalities necessary for data exchange via the protection
interface (PI).
Devices that communicate with each other via protection interfaces form a device combination. A device
combination consists of 2 to 6 devices. The devices communicate via point-to-point connections (protection
connections). In this case, a device has only one connection to another device via a protection interface (PI).
With a 2nd protection interface, you can establish a connection to another device or a redundant connection
to the same device. With their protection connections, the devices form a protection topology in the form of a
redundant ring (ring topology) or as a chain structure (chain topology).

Device Combination of 2 Devices in a Ring Topology
Within a device combination, the point-to-point connections can have different bandwidths. Depending on
the bandwidth, a certain amount of binary information and measured values can be transmitted bidirection-
ally between the devices. The connection with the lowest bandwidth defines the amount of binary informa-
tion and measured values.
The following information is important for protection communication and is transmitted additionally. You
cannot change this information:
•
Topology data and values are exchanged for monitoring and testing the connection and displayed on the
device or with DIGSI 5.
•
Protection data and measured values, such as line differential protection data or binary data of the
teleprotection schemes for distance protection and ground-fault protection are transmitted.
•
The time synchronization of the devices is possible directly via the connection, whereby a device of the
protection topology assumes the role of the timing master.
The point-to-point connection between the devices is continuously monitored for data faults and failure and
the signal-transit time of the data is measured.

The protection communication is typically used for line differential protection and with the teleprotection
schemes for distance protection and ground-fault protection. In SIPROTEC 5, you can configure the protection
communication in all devices and use it for further protection applications. At the same time, any binary
information and measured values can be transferred between the devices.

NOTE
The protection communication is compatible with the successor versions from firmware version V04.00
and higher.
Protection Communication in the Overall System
The following figure illustrates the interaction of protection communication, protection function groups, and
communication modules. The Protection communication is integrated as follows in the overall system:
[dw_protcom_compl_system, 2, en_US]
Figure 3-43
Protection Communication in the Overall System
If protection functions want to use the protection interfaces, their superordinate protection function group,
for example, the FG Line 1, must be connected to a Protection communication function group. With this
connection, each protection function in the FG Line 1 can use protection communication.
In addition, a connection must be configured between the logical protection interface in the FG Protection
communication and a channel on the physical communication module. The physical communication module
must support the protection-interface protocol.
The following chapters describe the configuration of the connections.
Function Description
Device Combination with 2 Devices: Simple or Redundant Transmission
In a device combination with 2 devices, one protection communication with a protection interface is required
per device to establish a protection connection (see next figure).

The most frequent application is the two-line-end differential protection (the protection communication is of
type 1) or the point-to-point exchange of data between 2 devices (the protection communication is of type 2),
as performed by protection transmission devices.
[dw_interface, 1, en_US]

NOTE
The index describes the consecutive numbering of the devices in a device combination (see parameter
(_:5131:101) Local device is device).
A maximum of 2 protection interfaces per FG Protection communication are possible in one device, see
following figure. If the Protection communication function groups are connected to each other in the devices
via 2 protection connections of the same type, this results in 100 % redundancy regarding the transmission
route. The devices then search for the communication connection with the highest bandwidth (for example,
optical fiber). If this protection connection fails, the system switches over automatically to the 2nd protection
connection until the 1st protection connection is available again. As the protection connection with lower
bandwidth defines the maximum amount of transferable information, the same information is exchanged via
both protection connections. Both protection communications in the device are then of type 1.

Route
Remote Data
With the Remote data function, customer-specific indications and measured values can be communicated via
the protection interface with settable update cycles (priorities).
There are 3 different priorities for the transmission of remote data:
•
Priority 1: Use Priority 1 for the transmission of fast protection signals that are transferred and updated
at a maximum of every 20 ms in a telegram.
•
Priority 2: Use Priority 2 for the transmission of fast single-point or double-point indications that are
transferred and updated at a maximum of every 40 ms.
•
Priority 3: Use Priority 3 for all indications, measured, and metered values that are transferred and
updated a maximum of every 100 ms.
Communication Media
The communication takes place via direct fiber-optic connections, via communication networks or via 2-wire
copper conductors. Siemens recommends a direct fiber-optic connection, as this offers a high transmission
rate and is immune to failures in the transmission route while offering the shortest transmission time. This

also enables the transmission of a large amount of remote data in line differential protection applications and
the remote control of remote devices with DIGSI 5.
The distance to be bridged and the transmission paths (communication media) available determine the
settings of the protection interface. External communication converters are used for the connection to
communication networks via G703.1-, X21-, or G703.6 interfaces. The connection to 2-wire copper cores
also takes place via a communication converter. The C37.94 interface, for example, with 2 MBit/s, offers a
direct fiber-optic connection to a multiplexer with the corresponding interface.
Table 3-10 to Table 3-11 show examples of communication connections.
In the case of a direct connection, the transmission distance depends on the fiber type of the optical fiber. This
distance can also be extended via external repeaters.
The modules in the device can be replaced from outside, so that adaptation to a transmission route is possible.
In the case of the 820-nm double module USART-AE-2FO, 2 protection-interface channels can be operated on
one module.
The modules can be located at slots E and F in the base device, and at slots N and P in the plug-in module
assembly with integrated power supply.
When using communication converters, the connection from the device to the communication converter by a
module is established via optical fibers.

Supervision of the Communication
Communication is continuously monitored by the devices and displayed with indications and measured
values.
If a number of defective data telegrams, or no data telegrams at all, are received, this is regarded as a failure
in the communication as soon as a failure time of 100 ms (default setting can be changed) is exceeded.
For each protection interface, a list of the measured values is shown in a window in DIGSI 5 (defective
telegrams per minute/hour; transmitted and received telegrams per minute/hour, percentage fault rate per
minute/hour). A corresponding failure indication is always available. If no alternative transmission route exists
(as in the ring topology), the protection function operating with the protection interface is not operating and
remote data is not updated on the receiver side.
If the communication is interrupted for longer than an adjustable time Data-connection failure, this is
regarded as a communication failure. A corresponding failure indication is always available.
Time Synchronization via the Protection Interface, Timing Master
All devices in a device combination can synchronize their time with each other. Synchronization is carried out
with millisecond accuracy. The synchronization works independently of the protection function and is used
exclusively for simultaneous time keeping in the devices of a device combination.
The device you set in the parameter (_:5131:102) Address of device 1 is the device with index 1.
This device functions takes on the role of the timing master in a device combination. If the timing master is
logged off and switched off, the device with the next highest device index takes on the function of the timing
master. The timing master synchronizes the clocks of the other devices via the protection interfaces.
The time of the timing master itself can be synchronized via the following time sources:
•
IRIG B
•
DCF77
•
IEEE 1588
•
SNTP
For this, these time sources must be set as the 1st time source and optionally as the 2nd time source in the
timing master. If available, the system switches over to the 2nd time source upon failure of the 1st time
source in the timing master.
The following chapters describe how a device is set as a timing master:
•
For classic protection communication, see Parameter: Address of Device x, Page 115.
•
For advanced protection communication, see Parameter: Device index, Page 153.
Set the protection interface as the 1st time source in the other devices of the device combination. You can find
the setting value in DIGSI 5 via the Project tree → Parameters → Time settings → Timer → Time source 1
→ PI.
In this way, all events in the devices of the device combination are recorded with the same time and are
time-synchronized even across different switchgears. This simplifies fault analysis and the fault records are
recorded with the same time in all devices.
Log Off the Device
A device can be logged off for protection-function tests, system inspections, or disconnection of a feeder
for operational reasons from the device combination. The logged off device no longer participates in the
distributed functionality and is therefore no longer an active component of the device combination. The
protection functions are still in operation for the other end or ends.

The following conditions are necessary for a successful logoff of the device from the point of view of
protection communication:
•
The device combination is not in a transient state and is stable in operation without switchovers of
the protection connections. This displays the message of the device combination Status of topo.
recog. with the value Valid.
•
In a given chain topology, the device to be logged off is one of the 2 devices at the end of the
communication chain.
•
The circuit breaker must be open on the side of the device to be logged off and current must not be
flowing.

Available Variants for the Protection Communication
The following variants are available for protection communication:
•
Classic protection communication
The scope of parameterization is small for the classic protection communication. The following
constraints exist:
–
IP-based communication protocols are not supported.
–
Increased parameterization effort when changing the number of devices in the device combination
subsequently, for example, protection of a multi-terminal line.
•
Advanced protection communication
The advanced protection communication provides greater flexibility and is used with IP-based communi-
cation protocols. For this purpose, the devices must be equipped with an Ethernet BD module. The
following advantages also exist for devices equipped with USART communication modules:
–
Easy subsequent expansion of the number of devices in a device combination
–
Multiple function groups Protection communication can be instantiated
–
Multiplex operation of a physical protection connection
–
Hierarchically structured representation in DIGSI 5 project tree

Measured values are transmitted via protection communication and are acquired and exchanged at the same
time in the devices. The synchronization of the measured-value acquisition can be done either internally via
the telegram measurement or via an external synchronous pulse (1-second pulse, PPS) using the function
block External synchronization. The external synchronization is switched on in the function block of the
protection interface. You can find the indications of the external synchronization in the function block

The function block Remote data is used to transfer selected and user-specific signals and measured values
from the SIPROTEC 5 system. You select the signals and measured values to be transmitted in the communica-
tion mapping of DIGSI. The remote data does not issue status indications.

Changes in the device-combination settings are always visible on the other channel as well. All further
parameters can be set separately for individual channels.
Parameter: Address of Device x
•
Default setting (_:5131:102) Address of device 1 = 101
•
Default setting (_:5131:103) Address of device 2 = 102
With the parameters Address of device 1 to Address of device 2, you give an address to each
device. Set a unique and unambiguous address for each device.
i
i
NOTE
The device 1 is the timing master device in a device combination.
If all other devices in the device combination are to obtain their time from the timing master device, note
the following:
•
Under Address of device 1 set the address for the timing master device.
•
Parameterize the other devices such that they get their time from the timing master device via the
protection connections.
For more information, refer to 3.7.2 Function Description. Select as the adjustable synchronization
option Protection interface.
In the timing master device you must not set the protection interface as the synchronization source!
Parameter: Local device is device
•
Default setting (_:5131:101) Local device is device = 1
With the parameter Local device is device, you set the index (number) of your device in the device
combination. A maximum of 6 devices can be present in one device combination.
APPLICATION EXAMPLE
You have a device combination with 2 devices.
For example, in DIGSI 5, select the parameter setting Address of device 1 with the parameter value 101
for device 1 and the parameter setting Address of device 2 with the parameter value 102 for device 2.
Then, use the Local device is device parameter to set the index of the local device. The local device is
the device that you parametrize.
The addresses must be set identically for all devices in the device combination. Functional protection commu-
nication requires that you also assign the same index in all devices of the device combination for a device with
a unique address.
Parameter: Lowest appearing bit rate
•
Default setting (_:5131:122) Lowest appearing bit rate = 64 kBit/s
With the parameter Lowest appearing bit rate, you set the lowest bit rate occurring in the device
group. Set the lowest value in each device with a three-end constellation with 2 fiber-optic connections (2
MBit/s) and one 64 kBit/s connection with the lowest value (64 kBit/s). This value determines the maximum
number of selected and self-created signals and measured values which are to be transmitted within the
device combination (refer to 3.6.5.9 Remote Data).
Apart from the default value, you can also set the following bit rates:
•
128 kBit/s
•
512 kBit/s
•
2048 kBit/s

NOTE
If you use optical fibers for a connection between the devices, set the value to 2048 kBit/s.
Parameter: Number of devices
•
Default setting (_:5131:125) Number of devices = 6
With the parameter Number of devices, you set the number of devices actually connected via protection
interfaces. This parameter is set by default to the maximum number of devices permitted in the device
combination.
This parameter lets you configure a planned final expansion of a system with a planned number of devices
already at this point in time and to put it into operation with a lower number of devices. When configuring
the protection interface, select the number of devices present in the final phase of the system in the Mapping
text box. If you set the parameter Number of devices to a smaller value than the maximum value, you
achieve functional protection communication with fewer devices. In this procedure, all settings, for example,
routing, you made for the device combination are retained, even if you subsequently increase the number
of devices. If you wish to operate, for example, a planned 3-device protection communication as a 2-device
protection communication, you must set the parameter Number of devices to 2. If you expand the system
later, change the Number of devices parameter to the planned maximum number.
For more detailed information regarding the configuration of the protection interface, refer to 3.6.5.4 Config-
uration of the Protection Interface in DIGSI 5.
i
i
NOTE
The Number of devices parameter is only visible for device combinations with more than 2 devices.
Set the same number of devices used in all devices that are part of the device combination.
Connection mode
•
Default setting Connection mode = SIPROTEC 5
With the parameter Connection mode, you select the device type with which the SIPROTEC 5 device is to
work in the device combination. As soon as a SIPROTEC 4 device works in the device combination, you must
set the parameter Connection mode accordingly.
Parameter Value
Description
SIPROTEC 5
The SIPROTEC 5 device only works with SIPROTEC 5 devices in the device
combination.
SIPROTEC 4 7SD610
The SIPROTEC 5 device works with at least one SIPROTEC 4 Differential
protection device 7SD610 with firmware version V4.72 and higher in the
device combination.
SIPROTEC 4 7SD5
The SIPROTEC 5 device works with at least one SIPROTEC 4 Differential
protection device 7SD5x with firmware version V4.72 and higher in the
device combination.
SIPROTEC 4 7SA5/6
The SIPROTEC 5 device works with at least one SIPROTEC 4 Distance protec-
tion device 7SA522 and 7SA6x with firmware version V4.72 and higher in
the device combination.
Setting Notes on Selecting the Communication Medium
•
Default setting (_:105) Connection via = fiber optic
The Connection via parameter is used to set the bit rate required for the protection interface. Different
discrete values can be entered depending on the means of communication (see following table).

Setting Notes for the Classic Protection Interface
Parameter: Max. error rate per hour
•
Default setting (_:5161:105) Max. error rate per hour = 1.0%
If the number of faulty telegrams per hour exceeds the value set in the parameter Max. error rate per
hour, you receive the error message Error rate / hour exc..
Parameter: Max. error rate per min
•
Default setting (_:5161:106) Max. error rate per min = 1.0%
If the number of faulty telegrams per minute exceeds the value set in the parameter Max. error rate per
min, you receive the error message Error rate / min exc..
Parameter: Disturbance alarm after
•
Default setting (_:5161:107) Disturbance alarm after = 100 ms
With the parameter Disturbance alarm after, you determine the time delay after which defective or
missing telegrams are signaled as faulty where the indication Status of lay. 1 and 2 is PI data
fault.
Parameter: Transm. fail. alarm after
•
Default setting (_:5161:108) Transm. fail. alarm after = 6.0 s
With the parameter Transm. fail. alarm after, you determine the time delay after which a communi-
cation failure is signaled where the indication Status of lay. 1 and 2 is PI data failure.

Parameter: Delay time threshold
•
Default setting (_:5161:109) Delay time threshold = 30.0 ms
The time taken to transmit and receive a signal via a protection connection is the signal-transit time. You can
monitor the signal-transit time. For the Delay time threshold, the default setting is selected in such a
way that normal communication networks do not exceed the signal-transit time. If this signal-transit time is
exceeded during operation (for example upon switchover to another transmission route), the indication Time
delay exceeded is issued.
Increased runtimes only affect the operate time, and therefore the fault-clearing time of the protection
functions using the protection interface.
Parameter: Synchronization
•
Default setting (_:5161:113) Synchronization = External synchron. off
With the parameter Synchronization, you control the time synchronization of the measured values with
microsecond accuracy.
If the SIPROTEC device operates with the external synchronization, use the Synchronization parameter to
define how the protection is activated after restoration of the communication connection (basic state or after
transmission fault). See Figure 3-63.
Parameter Value
Description
External synchron. off
The external synchronization is disabled:
No external synchronization is performed at the protection interface. Select
this setting value if you do not expect any differences between the signal-
transit times in the transmission and reception directions. Then the meas-
ured values are only synchronized internally with the telegram measure-
ment.
Telegr. and ext. synch. Synchronization via telegram measurement and external synchronization:
The measured values are synchronized internally with the telegram meas-
urement, supported by the external synchronization. You can set the
external synchronization with the parameter External synchroniza-
tion. The synchronization is possible via the IEEE 1588 protocol or via the
synchronous pulse of a satellite receiver.
Telegr. or ext. synch.
Synchronization via telegram measurement or external synchronization:
The measured values are synchronized internally with the telegram meas-
urement, supported by the external synchronization. You can set the
external synchronization with the parameter External synchroniza-
tion. The synchronization is possible via the IEEE 1588 protocol or via the
synchronous pulse of a satellite receiver.
External synch. only
External synchronization only:
The measured values are synchronized only through the external synchroni-
zation.
You can set the external synchronization with the parameter External
synchronization. The synchronization is possible via the IEEE 1588
protocol or via the synchronous pulse of a satellite receiver.
Parameter: External synchronization
•
Default setting (_:5161:117) External synchronization = PPS electrical (Port G)
The parameter External synchronization is visible only if the parameter Synchronization is not set
to External synchron. off.
External synchronization is possible separately for each protection interface.

Parameter Value
Description
PPS electrical (Port G) The electrical synchronous pulse of a satellite receiver (1-second-pulse,

The time synchronization protocol IEEE 1588 for an Ethernet-BD communi-
cation module is used for synchronization.

NOTE
The configuration option IEEE 1588 is only visible if the device has an Ethernet-BD communication
module and you have selected the communication protocol IEEE 1588, see following figure.

NOTE
External synchronization takes into account the signal-transit time in the transmission and reception direc-
tions. If external synchronization fails for a short time, for example, due to a receiving interference or an
unfavorable satellite position for a brief period, internal synchronization via telegram measurement is still
active.

NOTE
In contrast to the protection interface in extended protection communication, the protection interface in
classic protection communication is automatically connected to a channel of a communication module (see
Figure 3-56).
Parameter: Max. inaccuracy
•
Default setting (_:5161:119) Max. inaccuracy = 0.500 ms
With the parameter Max. inaccuracy, you configure the maximum expected inaccuracy of the synchro-
nization sourced used. The set value is only effective if the synchronization source used does not supply
any information on the current inaccuracy in the synchronization signals. If you have not used any of the
information on the inaccuracy of the synchronization source used, use the default setting.
If IEEE 1588 is used as the synchronization source in the synchronization status SmpSynch = global,
accuracy values are supplied with the synchronization signals and the parameter Max. inaccuracy is not
used. If the supplied accuracy values become invalid, the value set in the parameter Max. inaccuracy is
used.
If the synchronization source IEEE 1588 works in the synchronization status SmpSynch = local, then the
value set in the parameter Max. inaccuracy is used as permanently available inaccuracy.
If the synchronization source PPS electrical (Port G) or PPS optical (USART) is used, then the value set in the
parameter Max. inaccuracy is used as permanent inaccuracy.
If a USART communication module with the PPS protocol and the PPS generatoroperating mode is also used
as a synchronization source at the same time, the value set in the parameter Max. inaccuracy is used as
permanent inaccuracy.
Parameter: Check synchron.-source
•
Default setting (_:5161:121) Check synchron.-source = yes
With the parameter Check synchron.-source, you can switch on or off the synchronization-sources
check. During the check of the synchronization sources on the ends of a protection connection, a check
is conducted as to whether both synchronization sources are working in the same synchronization status
SmpSynch.
If both synchronization sources are working in the synchronization status SmpSynch = global, the check has
been passed.
If both synchronization sources are working in the synchronization statusSmpSynch =  local, that is decou-
pled from a global reference time, an additional check is conducted as to whether the synchronization source
(gmIdentity) is the same. Synchronicity can only be guaranteed if the synchronization sources are the same.
If the synchronization sources display a different synchronization status, that is one displays the synchroniza-
tion status SmpSynch = local and the other the synchronization status SmpSynch = global, synchroniza-
tion cannot be guaranteed.
Siemens recommends using the default setting Check synchron.-source = yes.
If you have problems with the synchronization-source check, you can switch off the synchronization-source
check. Switch off the synchronization-source check only if the synchronization sources are synchronous at the
end of their protection connection.
The parameter Check synchron.-source is visible only if the parameter (_:5161:113) Synchroni-
zation is set to External synch. only.

Furthermore, the following output signals are available:
Output Signal
Description
(_:5161:303) Connection
broken
The signal Connection broken indicates that during a parameterized
time (parameter (_:5161:107) Disturbance alarm after) no tele-
grams or faulty telegrams were continuously received. If the indication
Connection broken is issued, the affected protection connection is
reset. This can cause the blocking of an active line differential protection
or a ring topology can change to a chain topology.
(_:5161:316) Error
rate / min exc.
The signal Error rate / min exc. indicates that the set maximum
error rate per minute (parameter (_:5161:106) Max. error rate
per min) has been exceeded.
In this manner, a brief increase of the operate time and thus of the fault-
clearing time is possible for the protection functions using the protection
interface. If you use the Line differential protection function, this remains
in effect.
(_:5161:317) Error
rate / hour exc.
The signal Error rate / hour exc. indicates that the set maximum
error rate per hour (parameter (_:5161:105) Max. error rate per
hour) has been exceeded.
In this manner, a brief increase of the operate time and thus of the fault-
clearing time is possible for the protection functions using the protection
interface. If you use the Line differential protection function, this remains
in effect.
(_:5161:318) Time delay
exceeded
The signal Time delay exceeded indicates that the threshold value
for the set signal-transit time (parameter (_:5161:109) Delay time
threshold) has been exceeded.
Increased transmission times only affect the operate time, and therefore
the fault-clearing time of the protection functions using the protection
interface. If you use the Line differential protection function, this remains
in effect.

Output Signal
Description
(_:5161:319) Time delay
different
The signal Time delay different indicates that the threshold value for
the difference in signal runtimes in the transmission and reception direction
(asymmetrical runtimes) has been exceeded. The setting value results from
the setting value of the parameter (_:5161:110) Difference Tx and
Rx time.
The indication is visible only if the parameter (_:5161:113) Synchro-
nization is not set to External synch. only.
If the indication Time delay different appears, the Line differential
protection function is no longer working properly and is ineffective.
(_:5161:320) Time delay
jump
The signal Time delay jump indicates that the signal runtimes of the
data changed abruptly. This is caused by a switchover of the communica-
tion path in the communication network.
The indication is visible only if the parameter (_:5161:113) Synchro-
nization is not set to External synch. only.
(_:5161:321) PI
synchronized
The signal PI synchronized indicates that the synchronization with
microsecond accuracy of the measured values transferred between the local
device and partner device is working correctly.
The indication is visible only if the parameter (_:5161:113) Synchro-
nization is not set to External synch. only.
(_:5161:340) Telegram
lost
The signal Telegram lost indicates that an expected telegram has failed
to arrive or a faulty telegram has been received. Reasons for this can be for
example switching operations in the primary system or operations on the
components of the communication network.
If you want to assign the communication failures or faults to other events,
route the signal Telegram lost temporarily into the operational log.
Note: If the signal is constantly routed, the operational log can overflow.
Siemens recommends routing the signal only for clarification of problems.
(_:5161:343) Partner
The indication shows the address of the partner device. A value of 0 means
that no partner address is available.
(_:5161:323) PPS: time
del. unsym.
This indication is only visible if you are working with a synchronous pulse.
The indication shows that the difference in the signal runtimes between
the sending and receiving path exceeds the value set with the parameter
(_:5161:110) Difference Tx and Rx time.
Note: The Line differential protection function remains effective.
(_:5161:324) PI with
PPS synchron.
This indication is only visible if you are working with a synchronous pulse.
This indication is only visible if, in parallel to synchronization with the
synchronization pulse, you are also working with the synchronization via
telegram measurement. If both synchronization methods are working prop-
erly, the indication PI with PPS synchron. = RAISING is generated.

•
The synchronous pulse has failed.
•
The quality of the synchronous pulse is inadequate.
•
There is another problem with the synchronization source.
If no further PPS synchronous pulse is received within 2.1 s, the time-out

Remote Data
Between the devices in a device combination, a data bar is exchanged which can be written or read by the
devices. It can be used for exchanging various signals between the devices. For this, each signal demands a
certain number of data fields.

Figure 3-64
Data Bar Exchanged between Devices
The data bar is divided into 3 priorities, which have different transmission rates and data volumes.
For all signals sent, the basic principle is that only pure data contents are transmitted. The quality, for
example, Valid, is not automatically transmitted as well. If you want to transmit the quality as well, for
example, for further processing of GOOSE messages, you must transmit the quality separately, for example,
using CFC. If a function is in test mode, all signals of the function are provided with a test flag. If a signal with
a test flag is transmitted, all signals on the receiving side are provided with a test flag. If the connection is
broken, which means there are devices that cannot be reached anymore, all received signals are flagged with
the quality invalid. Additionally, the value is set to a predefined state after a selectable dropout time or the
last value received can be retained (setting Hold). This can be configured separately for each received signal,
refer to Table 3-17.
Behavior When Devices Are Logged Off or Switched Off
If you log off a device, the behavior of the remote data is not affected. A logged-off device sends remote data
as well. Logged-off devices can also receive and evaluate remote data.
If you switch off a device in the device combination, the remaining devices in the device combination do
not send or receive any remote data. A failsafe state is adopted for the remote data received before that,
according to the settings in the communication mapping in DIGSI. The previously received values can be either
retained or replaced with a dropout value.
If you switch off a logged-off device, the remaining devices keep sending or receiving remote data. The
remote data of a logged-off and switched-off device is no longer available in the communication. The
remaining devices behave as if the logged-off and switched-off device has never been part of the device
combination.

NOTE
For ACT type signals, only the phase information is transmitted.
Signals that are transferred data fields of priority 1 are sent with every telegram. They are preferably used for
the transmission of rapid signals, for example, release for circuit-breaker intertripping. A strictly deterministic,
rapid transmission is required there.
Signals of priority 2 are transmitted with at least every 2nd telegram. For bit rates >256 kbit, there are no
differences between priority 1 and priority 2.
Priority 3 signals are transmitted at least every 100 ms. This priority is used for transmission of measured and
metered values. Complex values must be routed separately as the real and the imaginary part for transmission.
Measured-value thresholds that lead to an updating of a measured value are set centrally as a property of the
measured value. These measured-value thresholds apply with the corresponding reporting, for example, also
for the transfer via IEC 61850 to a substation automation technology.
Signals which are written to a data area x under a priority on the data bar must be routed to an indication
of the same type in the device reading this information. Otherwise, they are processed incorrectly on the
receiving side. The data bar is organized in terms of bits. For information on the bit requirement of each signal
type, refer to Table 3-16.
Table 3-14 and Table 3-15 show the number of data areas in the data bar in relation to the available baud
rate.

Adjust the parameter (_:5131:122) Lowest appearing bit rate in each device for the protection
interfaces in a device combination. This determines the number of data areas.
If, for example, in a device combination with 3 devices with a type 2 chain topology 2 devices are connected
via direct optical fibers and 2 devices with a bit rate of 64 kBit/s, the 64 kBit/s section is the limiting factor for

Figure 3-65
Communication Mapping in DIGSI 5
Figure 3-66 to Figure 3-70 show the routing for a type 1 protection communication.
To transmit signals to other devices, these signals must be routed in the communication matrix under
Transmit. Binary inputs 1 and 2 are single-point indications (SPS) and are routed to bit position 1 and bit
position 2 of the transmission with the highest priority (priority 1). For 64 kBit/s, for example, only 8 of
these data areas are available for type 1 protection communication; they are exchanged between the devices
with each telegram. Signals 3 and 4 are double-point indications (DPS), for example, a switch position that
is transmitted by device 1. A double-point indication occupies 2 bit positions on the data bar. In addition, a
measured and metered value are communicated with priority 3.
As a measured or metered value uses 32 bits, value 2 starts at bit position 33. DIGSI 5 shows the next free bit
position.

Routing of Metered Values to Protection Communication in Device 1
Device 1 also receives signals (in the communication mapping under Receive, see next figure). These signals
must be routed with the other devices under Transmit. The binary outputs 1 and 2 in device 1 receive
their information via the protection communication. This is priority 1 information, which has been routed in
another device to position 3 and 4 of the data bar for transmission. The secure state is predefined in the
Fallback value column. If the protection connection fails, the single-point indication is reset to raising or
cleared as the fallback value or its value is retained (Hold). For signals of the various priorities, you can also
set a dropout time after which the reset (see following figure) to the fallback value occurs, in order to retain
the original state for a short time in the event of brief interruptions. These 3 dropout times apply for all signals
of one transmission priority and are set as parameters.

Figure 3-70
Routing of Single-Point Indications (Receive) to Protection Communication in Device 1
The following figure shows the routing in the 2nd device. Binary inputs 1 and 2 are routed with priority 1 to
bit positions 3 and 4 there. In device 1, bit positions 1 and 2 are already occupied (see Figure 3-66). If you also
route the signals to bit positions 1 and 2, the signals of both devices are then connected to the corresponding
bit position with a logical OR operation. If measured and metered values are routed in the same data areas,
this results in implausible values for the receivers. As a user, you are therefore responsible for the correct
routing.
[sc_baspsr, 1, en_US]
Figure 3-71
Routing of Single-Point Indications to be Sent to Protection Communication in Device 2
The binary outputs 1 and 2 (Receive) in the 2nd device are connected to priority 1 signals 1 and 2 from
the 1st device. This takes place via the data areas at positions 1 and 2 of the data bar, which transfer the
state of the signals. Other devices can also read this information and logically link it to their internal signals.
Here, too, the secure state, which is assumed when the protection connection is interrupted, is entered. This
state depends on the information. With single-point indications, states 0 or 1 make sense. In the case of
double-point indications, bit combinations 00, 01, 10, or 11 are possible to directly signal a disturbed position
upon failure of the protection connection, for example.
Hold is used to retain the state before the failure of the protection connection.

Meaning
(_:1351:6811:302) Vph
This measured value shows the voltage of the 3 phases that is synchronized
with all devices of the device combination. The absolute value and angle are
issued for each phase.
(_:1351:6811:303) Iph
This measured value shows the current of the 3 phases that is synchronized
with all devices of the device combination. The absolute value and angle are
issued for each phase.
(_:1351:6811:300) Dev.adr.
This indication shows the device address. This allows you to assign the
measured values and the circuit-breaker position in a better way.
(_:1351:6811:301) CB
This indication shows the position of the local circuit breaker and can have
the following values:
•
0:
The switch position of the local circuit breaker is unknown.
•
1
The local circuit breaker is open.
•
2
The local circuit breaker is closed.
The constellation measured values have the following properties:
•
They are synchronized in the devices in a device combination.
•
They are substituted using the protection interface.
•
They are available on every device in the device combination.
You can view the constellation measured values with DIGSI 5.
In the device, current and voltage measured values are displayed in absolute value and phase as a percentage.
100 % conform to the rated current or the rated voltage of the line (see Figure 3-75). These measured values
are recorded every 2 seconds by the devices and then sent to the other respective devices. At the same time,
the current and voltage values of the different devices are time-synchronous with one another.
When displaying the constellation measured values, the local device is prioritized. The device connected
directly with DIGSI 5 is the local device.
The angle reference depends on the type of the FG Protection communication used:
•
Protection communication Type 1:
–
The angle values of the voltages show the angle difference between the local and the remote
voltage. The local voltage serves as the reference with an angle of 0°.
–
The angle values of the currents show the angle difference between the local and the remote
current. The local current serves as the reference with an angle of 0°.
•
Protection communication Type 2:
The angles of the phase-to-ground voltages and the phase currents relate to the voltage VA of the remote
device.
You can find these measured values in the device under the following DIGSI mask:

Advanced Protection Communication
Overview
The advanced protection communication contains all functionalities of classic protection communication. The
view of parameters and indications is structured differently in DIGSI 5. In addition, the advanced protection
communication supports the IP-based communication protocol.
You can easily change the number of devices in the device combination. Further differences include support
for external synchronization sources and an exchange of phase-selective information while sending and
receiving.
In the DIGSI 5 library, you can find the available function groups for the advanced protection communication
in the Advanced protection communication folder. The following function-group types can be instantiated:
•
FG Protection communication type 1 (line differential protection)
•
FG Protection communication type 2
For configurations with line differential protection, instantiate the FG Protection communication type 1 (line
differential protection). In all other cases, instantiate the FG Protection communication type 2.

The following applies for the FG Line and the FG Voltage/Current 3-phase: You must route the
connection between the protection FG and the FG Protection communication in DIGSI 5.
(2)
You must assign a channel to the protection interface, see Parameter: PI assignment, Page 144.
Structure of the FG Protection Communication
The instantiated FG Protection communication contains the function blocks (FBs) for a protection interface
and for the device combination. If you have instantiated a 2nd protection interface, add another instance.
The FG Protection communication contains the following functionalities and function blocks:
•
FB Device combination
•
FB for the Protection interface
In addition, the following FBs can be instantiated:
•
A 2nd protection interface
You will find the 2nd protection interface in the DIGSI library under Extended protection communica-
tion > Second protection interface.
•
1 or 2 FBs for the External synchronization of the transmitted measured values by an external synchro-
nization pulse (1-second pulse, PPS) or via the IEEE 1588 synchronization protocol
You will find the FB External synchronization in the DIGSI library under Extended protection communi-
cation > Synchronization.

Device Combination
The function Device combination manages the devices that exchange data via protection communication.
The following FBs are pre-configured in the device combination:
•
FB General
•
FBs for each device in the device combination
In the Device combination, configure general settings for the protection communication and the device
addresses. The function Device combination issues the following indications:
•
General indications like the
–
Number of devices
–
Type and status of the device topology
•
Indications of the devices in the device combination like:
–
The availability of the device
–
The state of the device, that is whether the device is logged on or off in the device combination
–
Measured values of the device that have been recorded synchronized through the device combina-
tion (constellation measured values)
–
Test of the Line differential protection function in the device combination (only for type 1 protec-
tion communication)
–
Test of the Line differential protection function in the local device (only for type 1 protection
communication)
Protection Interface
The FB Protection interface transmits and receives signals and measured values to/from the slave unit. For
this, the protection interface uses the channel of a communication module.

External Synchronization
Measured values are transmitted via the protection communication and are acquired and exchanged at the
same time, with microsecond accuracy, in the devices. The measured values can be synchronized as follows:
•
Internally via the telegram measurement with the Ping-Pong method
•
Externally via
–
An external, synchronous pulse 1-second-pulse (PPS)
–
Via the IEEE 1588 protocol
If you want to use external synchronization, you need to instantiate the FB External synchronization.
You can use a different synchronization procedure for the 2nd protection interface than for the 1st
protection interface.
Remote Data
If you want to exchange selected and user-specific data or measured values via the protection communication,
you must use the Remote data function. If you want to route a specific signal or a measured value to
the protection communication, the device automatically creates the Remote data functionality. The routed
signals are then transmitted and received via the protection interface. The available bandwidth limits the
amount of remote data transmitted.
Phase Swap
If you want to exchange information via the protection communication with a device showing phases with
a different sequence but with the same rotating field as your device, the SIPROTEC 5 device can swap the
phase information when sending and receiving. It is no longer necessary to swap phases when connecting the
current transformers.
This use case exists on some tie lines of different power-system operators.
Configuration of the Advanced Protection Communication in DIGSI 5
Steps during Configuration
Siemens recommends the following procedure when configuring the advanced protection communication:
•
Select the desired communication module.
•
Select the protocol Adv.Prot.Intf..
•
The further parameterization depends on the selected communication module and is described in the
following under:

With the UDP port parameter, you set the value of the destination port in the UDP header of the protection-
interface IP messages. You must set the same value for the parameter UDP port for all protection devices
of a device combination that use the IP-based protection interface. Different device combinations can use
the same value for the UDP port parameter. Normally, the default setting can always be applied. It can be
necessary, for example, due to firewall policies, to configure a UDP port that differs from the default setting.

With the Disturbance alarm after parameter, you determine the time delay after which defective or
missing telegrams are signaled as faulty where the indication Status of lay. 1 and 2 is PI data
fault.
Parameter: Transm. fail. alarm after
•
Default setting (_:5161:108) Transm. fail. alarm after = 6.0 s
With the Transm. fail. alarm after parameter, you determine the time delay after which communica-
tion outage is signaled where the indication Status of lay. 1 and 2 is PI data failure.
Parameter: Delay time threshold
•
Default setting (_:5161:109) Delay time threshold = 30.0 ms
The time taken to transmit and receive a signal via a protection connection is the signal-transit time. You can
monitor the signal-transit time. For the Delay time threshold, the default setting is selected such that
it is not exceeded by normal communication networks. If this signal-transit time is exceeded during operation
(for example upon switchover to another transmission path), the indication Time delay exceeded is
issued.
Increased runtimes only affect the operate time, and therefore the fault-clearing time of the protection
functions using the protection interface. If you use the Line differential protection function, this remains in
effect.

Parameter: Difference Tx and Rx time
•
Default setting (_:5161:110) Difference Tx and Rx time = 0.1 ms
For time synchronization of the measured values with microsecond accuracy using telegram measurement,
the signal-transit times in the transmission and reception direction must be approximately the same. The
device monitors the signal-transit times in the transmission and reception direction.
With the Difference Tx and Rx time parameter , you set a maximum permitted signal-transit time
difference between the transmission and reception paths (runtimes unbalanced). Set the parameter Differ-
ence Tx and Rx time to the maximum difference expected.
Set this value to 0 for a direct optical fiber connection. A higher value is necessary for transmission via
communication networks. Reference value: 0.1 ms (recommended setting value).
If the difference in the signal-transit times between the transmission and reception path exceeds the value set,
the indication Time delay jump is transmitted.
If the difference in the signal-transit times between the transmission and reception path exceeds the value
set and is remains for more than 5 s, the indication Time delay different is transmitted. The line
differential protection function is no longer working properly and is ineffective.

Default setting (_:5161:113) Synchronization = External synchron. off
With the parameter Synchronization you control the time synchronization of the measured values with
microsecond accuracy.
The parameter Synchronization is only visible once you have instantiated the FB External synchroniza-
tion from the DIGSI 5 library in the FG Protection communication.
If you have not instantiated the FB External synchronization, the measured values are time-synchronized
internally with microsecond precision.

Parameter Value
Description
External synchron. off
The external synchronization is disabled:
No external synchronization is performed at the protection interface. Select
this setting value if you do not expect any differences between the signal-
transit times in the transmission and reception directions. Then the meas-
ured values are only synchronized internally with the telegram measure-
ment.
Telegr. and ext. synch. Synchronization via telegram measurement and external synchronization:
The measured values are synchronized internally with the telegram meas-
urement, supported by the external synchronization. The external synchro-
nization is possible via the IEEE 1588 protocol or via the synch pulse of a
satellite receiver and configurable in the FB External synchronization.
In this case, an existing line differential protection is only released when a
new connection is established and one of the following conditions is met.
•
The protection connection is synchronized with the help of the
external synchronization.
•
Symmetric signal-transit times are signaled via the binary input signal
>Sync reset or the controllable Reset synchronization. This
means that the signal-transit times are the same in the send and
receive direction.
Telegr. or ext. synch.
Telegram measurement or external synchronization:
The measured values are synchronized internally with the telegram meas-
urement, supported by the external synchronization. The external synchro-
nization is possible via the IEEE 1588 protocol or via the synch pulse of a
satellite receiver and configurable in the FB External synchronization.
An available line differential protection is enabled immediately upon
renewed establishment of connection (data telegrams are received). The
internal synchronization is used up to synchronization.
External synch. only
External synchronization only:
The measured values are synchronized only through the external synchroni-
zation.
You can set the external synchronization in the FB External synchroniza-
tion. This enables synchronization via the IEEE 1588 protocol or via the
synchronous pulse of a satellite receiver.
i
i
NOTE
If the protection interface is connected to a channel on a USART communication module (see Parameter: PI
assignment, Page 144), the external synchronization is used to take into account the signal-transit times in
the transmission and receive direction.
If external synchronization fails for a short time, for example, due to a receiving interference or an
unfavorable satellite position for a brief period, internal synchronization via telegram measurement is still
active.
i

NOTE
If the protection interface is connected to a channel on an Ethernet-BD communication module (see

With the external synchronization, the time synchronization of the measured values to the microsecond is
possible through an external synchronization source.
The parameter FB External synchron. is only visible if you have instantiated at least one FB External
synchronization from the DIGSI 5 library into the FG Protection communication. You can instantiate a
maximum of 2 FBs for External synchronization.
With the parameter FB External synchron., you can specify whether the protection interface for the
synchronization uses the FB Ext. synchronization 1 or the FB Ext. synchronization 2. The synchronization
source is parametrized in the relevant FB external synchronization, see 3.6.6.9 Setting Notes for External
Synchronization.
i
i
NOTE
External synchronization is possible separately for each protection interface.
Parameter: Check synchron.-source
•
Default setting (_:5161:121) Check synchron.-source = yes
With the Check synchron.-source parameter, you can switch the synchronization-sources check on or
off. During the inspection of the synchronization sources on the ends of a protection connection, a check
is conducted as to whether both synchronization sources are working in the same synchronization status
SmpSynch.
If both synchronization sources are working in the synchronization status SmpSynch = global, the inspec-
tion has been passed.
If both synchronization sources are working in the synchronization statusSmpSynch =  local, that is decou-
pled from a global reference time, an additional check is conducted as to whether the synchronization source
(gmIdentity) is the same. Synchronicity can only be guaranteed if the synchronization sources are the same.
If the synchronization sources display a different synchronization status, that is one displays the synchroniza-
tion status SmpSynch = local and the other the synchronization status SmpSynch = global, synchroniza-
tion cannot be guaranteed.
Siemens recommends using the default setting Check synchron.-source = yes.
If you have problems with the synchronization-source check, you can switch off the synchronization source
check. Switch off the synchronization source check only if the synchronization sources are synchronous at the
end of their protection connection.
The parameter Check synchron.-source is visible only if the parameter (_:5161:113) Synchroni-
zation is set to External synch. only.
i
i
NOTE
If you use PPS electrical (port G) as the synchronization source, the synchronization status (SmpSynch) is
permanently set to global.
If you use PPS optical (USART) as the synchronization source, you can use the setting (_:107)
Received. SmpSynch to set the synchronization status to (SmpSynch) local or global.
For synchronization with microsecond accuracy, for example with the line differential protection,
configure the setting (_:107) Received. SmpSynch = global.

broken
The signal Connection broken indicates that during a parameterized
time (parameter (_:5161:107) Disturbance alarm after) no tele-
grams or faulty telegrams were continuously received. If the indication
Connection broken is issued, the affected protection connection is
reset. This can cause the blocking of an active line differential protection
or a ring topology can change to a chain topology.
(_:5161:316) Error
rate / min exc.
The signal Error rate / min exc. indicates that the set maximum
error rate per minute (Parameter (_:5161:106) Max. error rate
per min) has been exceeded.
In this manner, a brief increase of the operate time and thus of the fault-
clearing time is possible for the protection functions using the protection
interface. If you use the Line differential protection function, this remains
in effect.
(_:5161:317) Error
rate / hour exc.
The signal Error rate / hour exc. indicates that the set maximum
error rate per hour (Parameter (_:5161:105) Max. error rate per
hour) has been exceeded.
In this manner, a brief increase in operate time and thus the fault-clearing
time is possible for the protection functions using the protection interface.
If you use the Line differential protection function, this remains in effect.
(_:5161:318) Time delay
exceeded
The signal Time delay exceeded indicates that the threshold value
for the set signal runtime (parameter (_:5161:109) Delay time
threshold) has been exceeded.
Increased runtimes only affect the operate time, and therefore the fault-
clearing time of the protection functions using the protection interface. If
you use the Line differential protection function, this remains in effect.
(_:5161:319) Time delay
different
The signal Time delay different indicates that the threshold value for
the difference in signal runtimes in the transmission and reception direction
(asymmetrical runtimes) has been exceeded. The setting value results from
the setting value of the parameter (_:5161:110) Difference Tx and
Rx time.
The indication is visible only if the parameter (_:5161:113) Synchro-
nization is not set to External synch. only.
If the indication Time delay different appears, the Line differential
protection function is no longer working properly and is ineffective.
(_:5161:320) Time delay
jump
The signal Time delay jump indicates that the signal runtimes of the
data changed abruptly. This is caused by a switchover of the communica-
tion path in the communication network.
The indication is visible only if the parameter (_:5161:113) Synchro-
nization is not set to External synch. only.
(_:5161:321) PI
synchronized
The signal PI synchronized indicates that the synchronization with
microsecond accuracy of the measured values transferred between the local
device and partner device is working correctly.
The indication is visible only if the parameter (_:5161:113) Synchro-
nization is not set to External synch. only.
(_:5161:340) Telegram
lost
The signal Telegram lost indicates that an expected telegram has failed
to arrive or a faulty telegram has been received.
If you want to assign the communication failures or faults to other events,
route the signal Telegram lost temporarily into the operational log.
Such events can be switching operations in the primary system or opera-
tions on the components of the communication network.
Note: If the signal is constantly routed, the operational log can overflow.
Siemens recommends routing the signal only for clarification of problems.

(_:3321:22711:302) Vph
This measured value shows the voltage of the 3 phases that is synchronized
with all devices of the device combination. The absolute value and angle are
issued for each phase.

issued for each phase.
(_:3321:22711:304) f
The measured value supplies the locally calculated frequency of the meas-
ured voltage or the current.
The constellation measured values have the following properties:
•
They are synchronized in the devices in a device combination.
•
They are substituted using the protection interface.
•
They are available on every device.
You can view the constellation measured values with DIGSI 5.
In the device, current and voltage measured values are displayed in absolute value and phase as a percentage.
100 % conform to the rated current or the rated voltage of the line (see Figure 3-84). These measured
values are recorded every 2 seconds by the devices involved in the device combination and then sent to
the other respective devices. At the same time, the current and voltage values of the different devices are
time-synchronous with one another.
When displaying the constellation measured values the local device is prioritized. The device connected
directly with DIGSI 5 is the local device.
The reference of the angle information depends on whether a line differential protection has been instanti-
ated in the FG Line. If a line differential protection is instantiated, the protection communication is type 1,
otherwise type 2.
•
Protection communication Type 1:
–
The angle values of the voltages show the angle difference between the local and the remote
voltage. The local voltage serves as the reference with an angle of 0°.
–
The angle values of the currents show the angle difference between the local and the remote
current. The local current serves as the reference with an angle of 0°.
•
Protection communication Type 2:
The angles of the phase-to-ground voltages and the phase currents relate to the voltage VA of the
relevant device.
You can find these measured values in the device under the following DIGSI mask:

Setting Notes for External Synchronization
With the FB External synchronization, you can synchronize the measured values of the devices that are
connected via protection connections with microsecond accuracy using external synchronization sources
(1*10E-06 s).
The measured values transmitted via protection communication for the line differential protection must be
time-synchronized. Synchronization is possible as follows:
•
Internally via telegram measurement
•
Externally via the IEEE 1588 protocol
•
Externally via a synchronous pulse from a satellite receiver
If you use Ethernet-BD communication modules for protection communication of the line differential protec-
tion, external synchronization of the measured values transmitted via the protection interface is essential.
If you use USART communication modules, you can synchronize the transmitted measured values either inter-
nally via telegram measurement or via external synchronization. If you do not use external synchronization,
the device automatically uses internal synchronization.
If you want to use external synchronization of the measured values, you must instantiate the FB External
synchronization from the DIGSI 5 library into the FG Protection comm. The External synchronization can be
found in the DIGSI 5 library under Extended protection communication > Synchronization.
External synchronization is possible for line differential protection applications or synchrophasor measuring
devices as follows:
•
Via a high-precision electrical synchronous pulse (PPS electrical (Port G), 1-second pulse) from a
satellite receiver at the time synchronization interface (Port G)
•
Via a high-precision optical synchronous pulse (PPS optical (USART), 1-second pulse) from a satel-
lite receiver at a USART communication module
•
Via the IEEE 1588 time synchronization protocol

With external synchronization, you can measure and display the signal-transit time of the transmission and
receive path separately. This allows you to achieve maximum sensitivity even with unequal (unbalanced)
signal-transit times in communication networks with line differential protection. For the transmission of
protection data in type 2 protection communication, different signal-transit times do not play a role.
If an FB External synchronization is instantiated, the parameter Synchronization is visible in the FB
Protection interf.. With this parameter, you establish the connection between the protection interface and
the type of external synchronization. See 3.6.6.5 Setting Notes for the Protection Interface.
If you use 2 protection interfaces in the FG Protection comm., you can set a different synchronization source
for each protection interface if required. For this application, you must instantiate 2 External synchronization
FBs into the FG Protection comm. and set the desired synchronization source separately.
Parameter: Name of synchron. block
•
Default setting (_:101) Name of synchron. block = Ext. synchronization 1
The parameter FB External synchron. shows the name of the External synchronization FB.

IEEE 1588
Synchronization is the time synchronization standard IEEE 1588 on a BD

Parameter: Max. inaccuracy
•
Default setting (_:119) Max. inaccuracy = 0.001 ms
With the Max. inaccuracy parameter, you configure the maximum expected inaccuracy of the synchro-
nization source used. The set value is only effective if the synchronization source used does not supply
any information on the current inaccuracy in the synchronization signals. If you have not used any of the
information on the inaccuracy of the synchronization source used, use the default setting.

NOTE
The inaccuracy of the synchronization source enters the stabilization of the Line differential protection as
an error signal.
This means that greater inaccuracy increases the calculated stabilization quantity and makes the line
differential protection less sensitive.

used.
If the synchronization source IEEE 1588 works in the synchronization status SmpSynch = local, then the
value set in the parameter Max. inaccuracy is used as permanently available inaccuracy.
If PPS electrical (Port G) or PPS optical (USART) are used as the synchronization source, then the value set in
the parameter Max. inaccuracy is used as permanent inaccuracy.
If a USART communication module with the PPS protocol and the PPS generator operating mode is also used
as a synchronization source at the same time, the value set in the parameter Max. inaccuracy is used as
permanent inaccuracy.

Indication
Description
(_:501) >PPS pulse loss The indication (_:501) >PPS pulse loss is only visible with the

•
G:Timesynchron.PPS
•
[Port]:USART-AD-1FO.Channelx.PPS
•
[Port]:USART-AE-2FO.Channelx.PPS
The binary input (_:501) >PPS pulse loss can be used to signal an
externally detected failure in the PPS synchronous pulse (for example, an
error message from the satellite receiver). If the binary input (_:501)
>PPS pulse loss is set, this leads to the indication (_:304)
Synchronization loss. The external synchronization detects immedi-
ately that there is a problem with the connected synchronization pulse.
Otherwise, the problem will only be noticed after approx. 2.1 s – after the
test for synchronous pulse failure.
(_:304) Synchronization
loss
The synchronization has failed. This may be due to a problem with the
synchronization source.
The indication (_:304) Synchronization loss shows that the
synchronization has failed. This may be due to the following reasons:
•
The input indication (_:501) >PPS pulse loss has occurred.
•
The synchronous pulse has failed.
•
The quality of the synchronous pulse is inadequate.
•
There is another problem with the synchronization source.
(_:305) Synchronization
OK
The synchronization is operating correctly.
(_:306) Synchronization
pulse
You can use this indication to make the synchronous pulse visible. As a rule,
one pulse is generated per second.
(_:307) Synchron.
imprecise
If the set synchronization source operates in the global synchronization
status and the time of the synchronization source deviates from the global
time by more than 0.5 ms, the indication Synchron. imprecise is
generated and the line differential protection becomes ineffective.
The indication Synchron. imprecise is visible if you select ETH-
BD-2FO.Channel1.IEEE1588 in the parameter _:103 Sync. protocol.
The read-only parameter (_:118) Synchronization using then

Assignment of the Protection Function Group to the FG Protection
Communication
If protection functions want to use the protection interfaces in a protection function group, you must route
the connection of the protection function group, for example, the FG Line 1, with a function group Protection
communication in DIGSI 5. Then, each protection function in the FG Line 1 can use the protection communi-
cation.
Route the connection between the FG Line and the FG Protection communication in DIGSI 5 as follows:
Project tree > Function-group connections > Tab Protection FG ↔ Protection FG. Right-click to route the
connection in the desired line/column.

NOTE
If only one protection function group and one FG Protection communication are instantiated in the

Application Examples and Setting Notes for IP Communication
Overview
The advanced protection communication supports the IP communication via MPLS14 communication
networks.
•
If existing systems are to be upgraded for protection-interface communication via IP, you must retrofit an
Ethernet-BD communication module in the respective SIPROTEC 5 devices.
•
The protection-interface communication via IP requires an Ethernet-BD communication module per
device in the device combination.
•
In a device, only one Ethernet-BD communication module can be used per device combination.
•
However, another device combination can use the same Ethernet-BD communication module of the
device.
The following application examples show what you must consider when using the IP communication via MPLS
communication networks.

Device Combination of 2 Devices and Redundant Communication Connection
If redundancy of the communication connection is required for a device combination consisting of 2 devices, 2
different procedures are possible:
•
You can use the redundancy mechanisms of the LAN and the Ethernet-BD communication module
(PRP, HSR, RSTP). In this case, the redundant communication route runs through the same Ethernet-BD
communication module.
•
You can set up a 2nd communication connection via a physically separate path. It is best to use a
different medium for this, for example, a fiber-optic direct connection, a direct cable connection (pilot
wire), or a connection based on C37.94. That is, for the 2nd communication connection, you must use
another communication module in each device. The following figure shows this case from a physical and
logical view:
[dw_network_with_2-device_redundant-comm, 1, en_US]
Figure 3-90
Device Combination with 2 Devices and Redundant Communication Connection
Device Combination of 3 Devices and Only IP Communication
If you configure a device combination with 3 devices and all devices are using the IP communication, then,
from the view of a device, the 2 other devices in the network are visible and reachable. For this, you
configure in each device the protocol Advanced protection interface on the Ethernet-BD communi-
cation module and the Protection interface 1. The Ethernet-BD communication module is assigned to the
Protection interface 1.
The special feature of this configuration is that the topology detection automatically generates a 3-device
ring topology (logical view). That is, 3 point-to-point communication connections are established between the
devices. In addition, another Protection interface 1B is automatically visible in each device, which provides
the necessary 2nd communication channel for the ring topology, see the following figure:

1B does not have its own settings view. The Protection interface 1B has its own indications and measured
values, which you can see in the information routing.
i
i
NOTE
If you use 3 devices in the device combination with IP communication, the aim of the topology detection
is to form a ring topology, as in addition to a redundant connection, shorter transmission times are also
possible.
If you have instantiated a 2nd protection interface, for example to establish a communication connection via
another medium, the device hides the Protection interface 1B.
i
i
NOTE
In the following cases, the Protection interface 1B becomes inactive and does not have any messages or
measured values:
•
A 2nd protection interface is instantiated.
•
Only 2 devices are present in the device combination.
•
No protection interface is assigned to an Ethernet-BD communication module.
Device Combination of 3 Devices and Hybrid Communication Media
If you extend a system, it can be necessary to extend a device combination consisting of 2 existing devices by
1 device, see the following figure.
The previous 2 devices are connected to each other, for example, via a fiber-optic direct connection or via
other communication media. The left device, for example, a SIPROTEC 4 device, and the middle SIPROTEC 5

device are the 2 devices previously present in the system. This device combination is to be extended by adding
the right SIPROTEC 5 device. The communication between the middle and the right device is to take place via
an IP communication network.
[dw_network_with_3-device_mixed-comm, 1, en_US]
Figure 3-92
Device Combination with 3 Devices and Hybrid Communication Media
For this configuration of a 3-device chain topology, you must configure a device combination with 3 devices
in all devices.
In the middle device, an Ethernet-BD communication module is additionally required. Configure the protocol
Advanced protection interface in the properties of the Ethernet-BD communication module. Instan-
tiate the function block Protection interface 2 in the FG Protection communication. Assign the Ethernet-BD
communication module to the Protection interface 2.
The device on the right must also have an Ethernet-BD communication module. Also configure here the
protocol Advanced protection interface in the properties of the Ethernet-BD communication module
and assign the Ethernet-BD communication module to the Protection interface 1. Protection interface 1B is
created here as a special feature, but it is not used.
If a redundant communication connection is required for this configuration, Siemens recommends estab-
lishing a 3-device ring topology. For this purpose, you must connect the left and right devices via another
communication channel. This creates the 3-device ring topology. The following figure shows this configura-
tion:

The SIPROTEC 4 device (left device) does not support any IP communication. In this case, you must switch
to another communication medium and retrofit a corresponding SIPROTEC 4 communication module. In any
case, the communication medium used is also supported by the SIPROTEC 5 device on the right side, by
retrofitting a corresponding equivalent communication module there. Configure this communication module
with the protocol Advanced protection interface, add an additional Protection interface 2 to the FG
Protection communication. Assign the Protection interface 2 to the communication module.
Device Combination of 6 Devices and Hybrid Communication Media
IP Addresses in Hybrid Topologies
To ensure redundancy or downward compatibility, the devices also allow a mix of classic and IP-based
communication media.
In such applications, special consideration must be given to the configuration of the IP addresses. When para-
metrizing the devices, you must first clarify which path the communication is to take through the network.
That is, it must be clear which devices communicate with each other. To define a route, you may only
configure its planned communication partners in a device. The following examples illustrate the correct IP
configuration.
For device combinations with more than 3 devices and hybrid communication media, different configurations
are possible. If you want to use the IP communication, consider that only one Ethernet-BD communication
module per device combination is supported for the protection-interface communication.
The following figure shows a device combination with 6 devices. In the example, several devices are
connected by other communication media, which form 3 device groups. The device groups are connected
by an IP network. The result is a 6-device chain topology. The yellow line illustrates the communication route.
To establish this communication route, you may only parameterize the IP addresses of their direct communica-
tion partners in the devices. The following example applies:
•
The devices 2 and 4 only know the IP address of device 3.
•
Device 3 only knows the IP addresses of the devices 2 and 4.
•
Leave all other IP addresses at 0.0.0.0.

Date and Time Synchronization
Overview of Functions
In power distribution and transmission networks, numerous applications require time synchronization. The
precise recording of processes requires devices to be exactly synchronous in terms of date and time. The
following time domains are available for this in SIPROTEC 5 devices.
•
Date and time synchronization
•
Synchronization of IEC 61850-9-2 sampled values
The date and time synchronization allows for the exact time mapping of events via time stamps. A clock
module internal to the device with battery backup is synchronized cyclically with the current device time so
that the right device time is available and used even after auxiliary-voltage failure.
The synchronization of IEC 61850-9-2 sampled values does not require time synchronization based on GNSS.
This functionality is described in the SIPROTEC 5 Process Bus manual.
The setting parameters and indications can be found in the following menus for the DIGSI and the device:
Set date and time:
•
DIGSI: Online access > Interface > Device > Device information > Time information
•
Device: Main menu > Device functions > Date & time
Parameter:
•
DIGSI: Project > Device > Settings > Time settings
Indications:
•
DIGSI: Project > Device > Information routing > Time managem. or Time/Samp.syn.
Function Description
Every SIPROTEC 5 device maintains an internal device time with date. Time and date settings can be made on
the device via the on-site operation panel, DIGSI 5 or WebUI. Within a system, or even beyond, it is usually
necessary to record the time of process data accurately and to have exact time synchronization of all devices.
For SIPROTEC 5 devices, the sources of time and synchronization options can be configured.
Configurable Synchronization Options:
•
None (default setting)
The device functions without any external time synchronization. The internal time synchronization
continues to work with the help of the back-up battery even when the auxiliary voltage is shut down
temporarily. The time can be adjusted manually.
•
Telegram
Time synchronization is done via a telegram with an appropriately configured communication interface –
for example, with the IEC 60870-5-103 or DNP3 protocol.
•
Connection to a radio clock
Time synchronization is done using the set time telegrams from an external IRIG B or DCF77 receiver via
the time synchronization interface of the device.
•
Ethernet
Time synchronization is via Ethernet-based SNTP protocol (Simple Network Time Protocol), for example
with IEC 61850 stations or via IEEE 1588. If you activate both services when configuring Ethernet
interfaces, these protocols are available as an option for time synchronization.

•
Protection Interface
The time synchronization takes place via the protection interfaces configured for your SIPROTEC 5 device.
Here, the timing master takes over the time management.
Configurable Time Sources:
•
2 time sources can be taken into consideration with the SIPROTEC 5 devices. For each time source, the
synchronization type may be selected based on the options provided.
•
Time source 1 takes precedence over Time source 2, that is, Time source 2 will be effective for
the synchronization of the device time only if Time source 1 fails. If only one time source is available
and it fails, then only the internal clock continues unsynchronized. The status of the time sources is
indicated.
•
For every time source, it is possible to define via the Time zone time source 1 parameter (or
Time zone time source 2) if this source transmits its time by UTC (universal time) or if the settings
correspond to the local time zone of the device.
i
i
NOTE
Make sure that the settings for the time sources coincide with the actual hardware configuration of your
SIPROTEC 5 device. In any event, incorrect settings cause the status indications of time sources to pick up.
Configurable Date Format
Regardless of a feed time-synchronization source, a uniform format is maintained internally within the device.
The following options are available for the customary local representation of the date format:
•
Day.Month.Year: 24.12.2009
•
Month/Day/Year: 12/24/2009
•
Year-Month-Day: 2009-12-24
Taking Local Time Zones into Consideration
The internal device time is maintained in universal time (UTC). To display time stamps in DIGSI and on the
device display, you can define the local time zone of the device (parameter Offset time zone for GMT),
including the applicable daylight saving times (start, end, and offset of daylight saving time) using parame-
ters. This allows the display of the local time.
i
i
NOTE
•
For time sources that transmit the status of the switch to daylight saving time, this will be automati-
cally taken into account when creating the internal device time in the UTC format. The differential
time of the daylight saving time set in the device (parameter Offset daylight saving time) is taken into
consideration. However, in contrast, the settings of the start of daylight saving time and end of the
daylight saving times are ignored when converting into the device internal UTC format.
•
For active time sources, it is not possible to set the time via the device display or DIGSI 5. An exception
is setting the calendar year for active time protocol IRIG-B.
Status, Supervision, and Indications of Time Management
Your SIPROTEC 5 device generates status and monitoring indications that provide important information
regarding the correct configuration of the time source and the status of the internal time management during
start-up and device operation.
Internal time synchronization is monitored cyclically. Important synchronization processes, the status of the
time sources and errors detected are reported. A device time that has become invalid will be marked accord-
ingly so that affected functions can go to a safe state.

device. This is listed as a prefix when making a selection in DIGSI 5.
Parameter Value
Description
none
An external time source is not configured. The time component inside the device
takes on the time synchronization.
IRIG-B
An external IRIG B receiver connected to port G takes on the time synchronization.
This time source is always available for selection, independent of the device and
communication configuration.
SIPROTEC 5 devices support several protocol variants of the IRIG B standards:
•
IRIG B 002(003)
The control function bits of the signal are not occupied. The missing year is
formed from the current device time. In this case, it is possible to set the year via
the online access in DIGSI 5.
•
IRIG B 006(007)
The bits for the calendar year are not equal to 00. The calendar year is set
automatically by the time protocol.
•
IRIG B 005(004) with extension according to IEEE C37.118-2005
If in the time signal, other control function bits are occupied in addition to the
calendar year, then the SIPROTEC 5 device takes the additional information into
consideration for leap seconds, daylight saving time, time offset (zone, daylight
saving time) and time accuracy.
DCF77
An external DCF77 receiver connected to D-sub 9 carries out the time synchroniza-
tion. DCF77 is only available in Central Europe.
PI
Inside a protection topology, one of the devices involved can take on time synchro-
nization as a timing master. The time synchronization is done over the protection
connections and the configured protection interfaces of the SIPROTEC 5 devices.
Signal transmit times of the protection communication are calculated automatically.
This time source is only available for selection under the following prerequisites:
•
In the SIPROTEC 5 device, at least 1 communication channel is configured as a
protection interface.
SNTP
SIPROTEC 5 devices support both Edition 1 and Edition 2 as per IEC 61850-7-2.
In Edition 2, the logical attributes LeapSecondsKnown, ClockFailure, ClockNot-
Synchronized, and the value TimeAccuracy are maintained in each time stamp. In
Edition 1, these signals contain default values. Thus, the interoperability for substa-
tion automation technologies is ensured for both editions.

Parameter Value
Description
IEEE 1588
You can use the protocol IEEE 1588 for time synchronization via Ethernet systems. In
this case, in addition to the clocks, all other network components must also support
IEEE 1588, for example switches as transparent clock (TC) or boundary clock (BC).
There must be a timing master in the system. If there are several timing masters in
the system, the actual master is specified as per the IEEE 1588 Best Master Clock
Algorithm (BMCA).
The actual timing master transfers the time to the receiver using an Ethernet-multi-
cast. The SIPROTEC 5 device can be coordinated and synchronized via the master
clock.
For more information, see SIPROTEC 5 Communication Protocol Manual.
IEC 60870-5-103
The time synchronization is carried out via telegram via a correspondingly configured
communication interface according to the protocol IEC 60870-5-103.
IEC 60870-5-104
The time synchronization is carried out via telegram via a correspondingly configured
communication interface according to the protocol IEC 60870-5-104.
DNP3
The time synchronization is carried out via telegram via a correspondingly configured
communication interface according to the protocol DNP3.
SIPROTEC 5 devices support 2 configurations:
•
Time synchronization via UTC
•
Time synchronization with local time
The daylight saving time status is not transmitted. The same rules for the start
and end of daylight saving time must be set on the device and the DNP3 master.
Parameter: Time zone of time protoc. 1, Time zone of time protoc. 2
•
Default setting (_:108) Time zone of time protoc. 1 = local
•
Default setting (_:109) Time zone of time protoc. 2 = local
With the Time zone of time protoc. 1 and Time zone of time protoc. 2 parameters, you
define the handling of time zones of the external timer.

User-Defined Objects
Overview
With help from user-defined function groups and user-defined functions you can group user-defined objects,
for example user-defined function blocks. 2 user-defined function blocks are available (see following figure).
[sc_udef_lib, 1, en_US]
Figure 3-99
User-Defined Objects in the DIGSI 5 Library
The user-defined function block allows you to add (see following figure) single-point indications, pickup
indications, operate indications (ADC, ACT), single and double commands, commands with a controllable
whole number as well as measured values. You can assign the group a superordinate name (for example
process indications for a group of single-point indications which are read via binary inputs). This function can
be deactivated using the mode. The standby mode is also analyzed or displayed.
The user-defined function blocks can be instantiated at the highest level (alongside other function groups) as
well as within function groups and functions.
In addition, there is a user-defined function block [control]. Alongside the aforementioned possibilities
presented by user-defined function blocks, this block offers additional tests for user-defined control signals,
for example SPC or DPC.
These are described in chapter 7.6.1 Overview of Functions.

to prevent continuously changing indications from clogging the event list. After an adjustable number of
changes, the indication is blocked for a certain period.
The settings for indication filtering can be found at the individual signals. The next figure shows the settings
using the example of a controllable (circuit-breaker switch position).
i
i
NOTE
The software filtering time is available only for the circuit breaker and disconnector in the controllable
Cmd. with feedback (control function block), as this is used for logging purposes. The controllable
position (circuit breaker or disconnector function block) is used for interlocking conditions and must
always show the unfiltered position of the switching object.
[sc_lposi, 1, en_US]
Figure 3-106
Settings for Circuit-Breaker Switch Position
The setting range for the Software filter time parameter ranges from 0 ms to 100 000 ms in ms
increments. The Retrigger filter check box can be used to select whether to restart the filtering time
whenever a status change is performed within the software filtering time. When activated, the Indication
timestamp before filtering check box backdates the time stamp by the set software filtering time. In
this case, the time stamp corresponds to the actual status change of the signal. If you activate the Suppress
intermediate position check box, the intermediate position is suppressed for the duration of this
software filtering time.
If you leave the software filtering time at 0 ms, the time for the suppression of the intermediate position is
also 0 ms. The activated Suppress intermediate position check box then remains ineffective.

If you do not activate the Suppress intermediate position check box, the software filtering time
affects the on, off, intermediate, and disturbed positions of the circuit breaker or disconnector switch.
With the parameter Spontaneous position changes filtered by:, you set how such position
changes are to be filtered. Spontaneous position changes are caused by external switching commands, for
example. If you select the General software filter setting, the general settings for software filtering of
spontaneous position changes and for position changes caused by a switching command apply. The settings
for spontaneous position changes then cannot be edited. A separate filtering for spontaneous position
changes is activated with the Spontaneous software filter setting and you can edit the settings for
this.
Chatter blocking can be activated or deactivated as an input parameter, for example as a parameter of the
position in the Circuit breaker or Disconnector function block.

Figure 3-107
Setting Chatter Blocking
The settings for the chatter blocking function are set centrally for the entire device in DIGSI. They are
accessible as settings in the General function group (see the following figure).
The chatter-blocking settings have the following meaning (see also Figure 3-108 and Figure 3-109 in the
examples shown in the following):
•
No. permis.state changes
This number specifies how often the state of a signal may toggle within the chatter-test time and the
chatter-checking time. If this number is exceeded, the signal will be or remains blocked.
Enter a number from 0 to 65535 in this field. If the entry is 0, chatter blocking is essentially inactive.
•
Initial test time
During this time, the number of times a signal changes its status is checked. This time is started if chatter
blocking is configured for at least one signal and this signal changes its status. If the configured number
of permissible status changes is exceeded during the initial test time, the signal is temporarily blocked
and the indication Chatter blocking is set.
Enter a number from 1 to 65535 in this field. The number entered corresponds to the time in seconds.
When the set time has expired, the timer restarts automatically (cycle time).

C53000-G5040-C028-2, Edition 07.2024


•
No. of chatter tests
This number specifies the maximum number of test cycles to be run. If the number of permissible status
changes of the signal stays exceeded during the initial test time of the last test cycle, the signal is finally
blocked. In this case, the indication Group warning (Alarm handling group and Device group) is set
additionally to the Chatter blocking indication after expiry of the set number. Restarting the devices
removes this block again.
Enter a number from 0 to 32767 in this field. The value Infinite (∞) is also permissible here.
Enter this value as character string oo.
•
Chatter idle time
If the number of permissible status changes for a signal is exceeded during the initial test time or
the subsequent test time, the Chatter idle time starts. Within this time, this signal is blocked
temporarily and the Chatter blocking indication is set. The blocked input signal is assigned the
oscillatory quality.
Enter a number from 1 to 65535 in this field. The number entered corresponds to the time in minutes. An
entry here is only considered if the number of chatter tests does not equal to 0.
•
Subsequent test time
During this second test time, the number of times a signal changes its status is checked once again.
The time begins when the Chatter idle time expires. If the number of status changes is within the
permissible limits, the signal is released. Otherwise, an additional dead time begins, unless the maximum
number of chatter tests has been reached.
Enter a number from 2 to 65535 in this field. The number entered corresponds to the time in seconds. An
entry here is only considered if the number of chatter tests does not equal 0.
Example 1: Permanent Blocking
The chatter-blocking settings are set as follows:
•
No. permis.state changes = 4
•
No. of chatter tests = 2
After more than 4 state changes within the Initial test time, the input signal is set to the original
state by the chatter blocking and the oscillatory quality is assigned. Additionally, a corresponding indication
is added to the operational log. At the same time, the Chatter blocking indication is set. After expiry of
the settable Chatter idle time, during the following Subsequent test time, it is checked whether
the input signal is still chattering. This check is repeated, as the No. of chatter tests is set to 2 in this
example.
If, during the 2nd Subsequent test time, it has been detected that the number of status changes of
the input signal exceeds the set No. permis.state changes, the chatter blocking detects a persistent
violation of the signal stability and sets the Group warning indication. The original state of the signal is
permanently frozen. Only a device restart removes the chatter blocking again.

If, during the 2nd Subsequent test time, it has been detected that the number of state changes of the
input signal is within the set No. permis.state changes, the temporary blocking of state changes of the
signal is removed and the actual signal state is released.
The quality bit oscillatory is removed and the Chatter blocking indication is reset. As the temporary
blocking of the signal is removed, the Group warning indication is not set. The chatter test starts again.

Acquisition Blocking and Manual Updating
During commissioning, maintenance, or testing, a brief interruption of the connection between the logical
signals and binary inputs may be useful. It allows you to manually update the status of a switching device that
is not providing feedback correctly. Before this can take place, you must first set acquisition blocking.
To set the acquisition blocking, proceed as follows:
•
Using the navigation keys, move in the main menu of the device display to
Commands→Equipment→Aq.blkman. update.
•
Select the appropriate device (for example, a circuit breaker) from among the several switching devices
using the navigation keys.
•
Press the Change softkey.
•
Enter the confirmation ID (not relevant for active role-based access control (RBAC) in the device).
•
Confirm the process with the softkey marked OK in the display.
After entering the confirmation ID (only with the RBAC inactive), acquisition blocking is switched on.

You can set acquisition blocking also via a binary input. If you want to put in the feeder or the switching
device in revision, you can set the acquisition blocking with an external toggle switch for one or more
switching devices. For this purpose, every switching device in the Switch function block (circuit breaker or
disconnector switch) has the input signal >Acquisition blocking. This signal can also be set from the
CFC.

NOTE
Interlockings are carried out with the status changes of the switching device. Remove acquisition blocking
again manually. Otherwise, position changes of the switching device are not detected and interlockings are

If the acquisition blocking and the manually updated position are set using the operation panel of the device
or the system interface IEC 61850, these are retained until the acquisition blocking is manually deactivated.
When you initially start the device, the acquisition blocking is deactivated.
Except for a restart, the acquisition blocking and the manually updated position are retained.
If the acquisition blocking is activated via the input signal >Acquisition blocking, it is retained as long as
the binary input is active.
To set the acquisition blocking of a switching device, the following sources are possible:
•
Operation panel of the device
•
System interface IEC 61850
•
Input signal >Acquisition blocking
All sources undergo OR operations, that is, the acquisition blocking remains set until all the sources are
deactivated.
After deactivation of the acquisition blocking, the actual position of the switching device is adopted and
displayed in the operation panel of the device.
i
i
NOTE
When the acquisition blocking is activated or the switching device updated manually while the entire
device or the switching device is in application mode, these states are not saved. The acquisition blocking
and the manual updating are not retained after a restart.
The acquisition blocking and the manual update for the circuit breaker, the disconnector, and the tap changer
are reset by way of the >Reset AcqBlk&Subst binary input. Setting acquisition blocking and manual
update is blocked with the input activated.
Persistent Commands
In addition to the switching commands, which are issued as pulse commands, and stored for the standard
switching devices (circuit breaker, disconnector switch), persistent commands are also possible. In this case, a
distinction must be drawn between controllables with the Continuous output operating mode and a stored
signal output that is immune to reset.
You can change a controllable from pulse to persistent command with the Command output parameter.

Device Logout
Overview
In the case of multibay functions, a device uses information from one or more other devices. For some
applications, it may be necessary for you to remove a device with all effective functions temporarily from the
plant and even to switch it off. These applications are, for example:
•
Maintenance work
•
System upgrades
•
Testing the local protection functions, for example, the local line differential protection
The Device logout functionality informs the receiver devices about the imminent disconnection of the
transmitter devices. To do this, the last valid received information is stored in the receiver devices and used for
the multibay functions.
i
i
NOTE
If you need to remove a device temporarily from the plant, you must log off the device.
Protection functions distributed to several devices operate in a healthy manner with the remaining devices
only if you have logged off the device.

You can log off the device as follows:
•
Via the on-site operation panel
•
Via a communication interface using the Device logout (_:319) controllable
•
Via the binary inputs, general: >Dev. funct.logout on (_:507) or >Dev. funct.logout off
(_:508)
You can find the controllable and the binary inputs in the DIGSI 5 project tree under Name of the device →
Information routing in the working area in the General block.
During the log-off process, the device checks whether all conditions for a logout have been met. If the
conditions for the log off have not been met, the logout is rejected.
The logout is rejected under the following conditions:
•
The devices are communicating via the protection interface and switching off the device leads to an
interruption in protection-interface communication.
•
The Line differential protection function is operating in the device and the local circuit breaker is still
switched on.
In this case, you must switch off the local circuit breaker and repeat the log-off process for the device.
After the logout, the local Line differential protection function is removed from the summation of
the currents for the Line differential protection of the other devices. The Line differential protection
function remains active in the other devices.
i
i
NOTE
The path used to log the device off is stored in the operational log.
Even if you switch off the device after logout, the Device logged off (_:315) state is stored.
If you want to establish the initial state again after logging off the device, you must log on the device again.
To log on the device, you must use the same option used for logout. For example, if you have logged off the
device via binary inputs, you must log it on again via the binary inputs. This applies in similar manner if you
have logged off the device via DIGSI or via on-site operation.

Conditions for Logging off the Device
[lo_functional logoff device, 1, en_US]
Figure 3-116
Logic for Logging off the Device
The conditions for a successful logout of the device result from the conditions for every activated protection
function.
Logoff of a Device from a Device Combination with Communication via the IEC 61850-8-1 (GOOSE) Protocol
If devices are exchanging data using the IEC 61850-8-1 (GOOSE) protocol – for example in the case of
substation interlocking – for each received data point the value of this data point can be set in the receiver
device when the transmitter device logs off. This value remains effective in the receiver device until the
logout is canceled by the transmitter device, even if the transmitter and/or the receiver are switched off in the
meantime.
Logoff of a Device from a Device Combination Using Protection Communication
If devices in a device combination communicate via the protection interface, you can only log off a device
under the following conditions:
•
Logging off and switching off a device in a device combination must not result in an interruption in the
protection communication.
•
For series-connected topologies, the device must be located at one end of the communication chain as
otherwise the protection communication is interrupted when the device is logged off and switched off.
For this reason, devices not at one of the ends in series-connected topologies cannot be logged off.
Logout via Binary Inputs
The following diagrams show potential variants on how to control binary inputs. If you want to use push-
buttons, switch on this function as shown in the following figure. Log off the device using the push-button
Key2; log on the device again with the push-button Key1.

General Notes for Setting the Threshold Value of Protection
Functions
Overview
You can set the threshold values of protection functions directly on the device or by using DIGSI 5.
An innovative design was implemented for the protection settings.
You can switchover the edit mode between the following setting views:
•
Primary
•
Secondary
•
Percent
If you change settings in a setting view, DIGSI 5 calculates the settings of the 2 inactive views in the
background. If you wish to save, for example, conversion to secondary values, then select the primary view.
Configure all the settings and switchover to the secondary view.
Edit Mode: Primary
The parameters are set as primary values and thus refer directly to the primary system. The manual conversion
on the secondary circuit omitted.
Edit Mode: Secondary
The settings refer to the secondary circuit of the transformer. This means that the settings must be converted.
The secondary setting is the customary setting view. For secondary tests, the pickup values can be read
directly.
Edit Mode: Percent
This setting type is beneficial for electric machines (generators, transformers, motors, and busbars). The
setting values can be standardized regardless of the machine size. The reference values for the percentage
settings are the rated values of the function groups, for example, rated voltage and rated current or rated
apparent power. The setting values are, thus, related exclusively to the primary settings. If other reference
values are used, then this is documented for the respective protection function in the application and setting
notes.
If parameters are selected it may happen that they are set only in percent in all 3 setting views.
Recommendation for Setting Sequence
When setting the protection function, Siemens recommends the following procedure:
•
First, set the transformation ratios of the transformers. You can find these under Power-system data.
•
Subsequently, set the reference parameters for the percent setting. You will find these parameters in
function group .
•
Next, set the parameter of the protection functions.
If the transformer data have changed after completing the protection setting, remain in the setting sheet
(for example, primary setting) and change the transformer data. In the background, DIGSI 5 obtains the
new settings in the inactive setting views (for example, new secondary values).
The following section explains, by way of an example, how to modify the transformer ratios in DIGSI 5 using
the corresponding alternatives.

If you have already set the settings in the secondary view by including the new transformation ratio of the
transformer in the calculation, then answer the question with No. In this case, the protection settings in the
secondary view remain unchanged. DIGSI 5 recalculates the settings (threshold values) of the primary view. In
the example, the primary threshold value is then 300 A (1.5 A · 1000 A/5 A = 300 A).
In the example, the current-transformer ratio changes from 1000 A/1 A to 1000 A/5 A. The following table

Device Settings
Settings-Group Switching
Overview of Functions
For different applications you can save the respective function settings in so-called Settings groups, and if
necessary enable them quickly.
You can save up to 8 different settings groups in the device. In the process, only one settings group is active at
any given time. During operation, you can switch between settings groups. The source of the switchover can
be selected via a parameter.
You can switchover the settings groups via the following alternatives:
•
Via the on-site operation panel directly on the device
•
Via an online DIGSI connection to the device
•
Via binary inputs
•
Via a communication connection to the substation automation technology.
The communication protocols IEC 60870-5-103, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850, DNP, or Modbus TCP can
be used for switching the settings groups.
A settings group includes all switchable settings of the device. Except for a few exceptions (for example,
general device settings such as rated frequency), all device settings can be switched.
For detailed information about the settings groups, refer to the Operating Manual and to the DIGSI 5 Online
Help.
Structure of the Function
The function of the Settings group switching is a supervisory device function. Accordingly, the settings and
indications of the settings group switching can be found in DIGSI 5 and at the on-site operation panel of the
device, below the general device settings respectively.
If you want to switchover a settings group, navigate to DIGSI 5 or proceed on the on-site operation panel of
the device, as follows:
•
Via the project tree in DIGSI 5:
Project -> Device -> Settings -> Device settings
•
Via the on-site operation panel of the device:
Main menu → Settings → General → Group switchover
The indications for the settings group switching can be found in the DIGSI 5 project tree under:
Project → Device → Information routing → General
Function Description
Activation
If you want to use the Settings group switching function, you must first set at least 2 settings groups in DIGSI
5 (parameter Number of settings groups > 1). You can set up a maximum of 8 settings groups. The settings
groups set in DIGSI 5 are subsequently loaded into the device.
Mechanism of the Switchover
When switching over from one settings group to another, the device operation is not interrupted. With
the parameter Active settings group you are either specifying a certain settings group or you allow
switching via control (IEC 60870-5-103, IEC 61850) or via binary input.

Switching via Control
When using the Control function for switching, the settings groups can be switched via a communication
connection from the substation automation technology or via a CFC chart.
The communication protocols IEC 60870-5-103, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850, DNP, or Modbus TCP can be
used for switching the settings groups via a communication connection.
In order to use a CFC chart for switching, you must create a new CFC chart in DIGSI 5. Create the CFC chart in
the DIGSI 5 project tree under Name of the device →Charts →Add new chart. Link the signals that control
settings group switching in the CFC chart.
Switching via Binary Input
There are 3 appropriate input signals available for switching via binary inputs. These input signals allow
selection of the settings group via a binary code. If one of the 3 signals changes, the signal image present will,
after 100 ms (stabilization time), result in switching over to the appropriate settings group. If only 2 settings
groups must be switched over, only 1 binary input is required. The following table shows the possible binary
codes (BCD) and applicable settings groups (PG).

Copying and Comparing Settings Groups
In DIGSI 5, you can copy or compare settings groups with each other.
If you want to copy settings groups, select a source and target parameter group in DIGSI 5 in the device
settings, and then start the copy process. The device settings can be found in the DIGSI 5 project tree under
Project → Device → Settings → Device settings.
If you want to compare settings groups, it is possible to do so in all setting sheets for settings. You will then
select in addition to the active settings group, a 2nd settings group for comparison. Active setting values
and the comparable values are displayed next to each other. For settings that cannot be switched over, no
comparable values are displayed.
Indication of Settings Group Switchings
Every settings group shows an applicable binary indication as well as its activation and deactivation. The
process of settings group switching is also logged in the log for settings changes.
Application and Setting Notes

The following list shows you the chapters containing the desired information.
You can find more about:
•
Chatter blocking in 3.9.1 Signal Filtering and Chatter Blocking for Input Signals.
•
Control in 7.4 Control Functionality.
•
Spontaneous indications in 3.1.7 Spontaneous Indication Display in DIGSI 5.
•
CFC quality treatment in 3.4.3 Quality Processing/Affected by the User in CFC Charts.
Under Device, you set the parameters for the device that are valid across functions.
With Test support, indications transmitted via communication interfaces are labeled with an additional test
bit, provided this is supported by the protocol. With this test bit you can determine whether an indication
is generated in a test and all or individual functions of the device are in the test mode. In this manner, the
reactions that are necessary in normal operation due to an indication can be suppressed in other devices that
receive these indications No mainboard restart. You may also permit, for example, a trip command to close
an energized binary output for test purposes. Siemens recommends deactivating Test support again after the
test phase.
Under SEU Handling, you can configure the behavior of the mainboard and the ETH-BD-2FO communication
modules in the case of an SEU event.
Certain SEU events can only be remedied if the device is restarted. These SEU events can arise in the FPGA
component of the SIPROTEC 5 mainboard or in the ETH-BD-2FO communication module. The SEU events in the
IO modules can be remedied without restarting the device.
The likelihood that an SEU event will impact the FPGA component depends on external conditions. More
information ###URL
From version DIGSI V09.70 you can control the state of the logical nodes (LLN0) in a logical device (LD) under
IEC 61850 using the LDevice Mod controllable parameter. Place a checkmark on the LDevice Mod
controllable parameter if you want to test and change the behavior of logical nodes individually.
Application and Setting Notes
The major portion of the settings is described in the chapters cited above. Then, the parameters on the section
Device, Spontaneous indication and Test support are described.
Parameter: Rated frequency
•
Default setting (_:101) Rated frequency = 50 Hz
The Rated frequency parameter is used to set the rated frequency of the electrical power system.
Parameter: Minimum operate time
•
Default setting (_:102) Minimum operate time = 0.00 s
Use the parameter Minimum operate time to set the minimum duration for the trip signal of the func-
tions. The trip signal is maintained for the set duration.
Parameter: Block monitoring dir.
•
Default setting (_:138) Block monitoring dir. = off
Use the parameter Block monitoring dir. to set whether or not indications are issued via the system
interface(s) of the SIPROTEC 5 device.

If transmission blocking is switched on, no indications are output via the system interface(s) of a SIPROTEC 5
device, apart from via the IEC 61850 interface(s).
In order not to receive any IEC 61850 data, the corresponding IEC 61850 client must stop the reporting
or freeze the data. You can find more information on this in the Communication Protocols Manual (C53000-
L1840-C055-3).
Parameter: Fault-display
•
Default setting (_:139) Fault-display = with pickup
Use the parameter Fault-display to set whether spontaneous fault indications identified in the matrix
with the NT (Conditional latching) option are saved with every pickup or only for a tripping.
Keep the DIGSI 5 routing options in chapters 3.1.7 Spontaneous Indication Display in DIGSI 5 and 3.1.9 Stored
Indications in the SIPROTEC 5 Device in mind.
Parameter: Activate device test mode
•
Default setting (_:150) Activate device test mode = inactive
Use the Activate device test mode parameter to activate the test mode for the entire device. This
means that all indications generated in the device will be provided with a test bit.
You can also activate the test mode using the IEC 61850-8-1 protocol, except for via this parameter. You can
find more information in the SIPROTEC 5 Communications protocol manual.
When the test mode is activated for the whole device, but Oper.bin.outp. under test is not, the routed
device relay outputs are not activated from the indications that are generated.
i
i
NOTE
The device remains in test mode during every restart until you intentionally set the device back into process
mode or you have carried out an initial start.
You can set process mode by switching the parameter Activate device test mode to inactive again
(removing the check mark) or deactivate the test mode again via the IEC 61850-8-1 protocol.
i
i
NOTE
Alongside the cross device test mode, you also have the option to place an individual function or tripping
stage into test mode depending on the supported operating modes. To do this, see the relevant function or
tripping stage.
When you place an individual function or tripping stage into test mode, all indications that are tripped by
this function or tripping stage are given a test bit.
When you activate test mode for an individual function or tripping stage, but theOper.bin.outp.
under test is not, the routed relay outputs for the function or tripping stage are not activated by the
indications that are generated.
An individual function or tripping stage remains in test mode during every restart until you have intention-
ally deactivated test mode for this function or tripping stage again, or carried out an initial start.
Parameter: Oper.bin.outp. under test
•
Default setting (_:151) Oper.bin.outp. under test = inactive
If you activate the Oper.bin.outp. under test parameter, functions in Test state can control relay
outputs.
Activating the parameter causes all logical nodes (LPDO) of the relay outputs to switch into the Test state.
The indications that have been generated in the device and marked with a test bit can thereby be output to a
routed device relay output.
If you disable the (_:151) Oper.bin.outp. under test parameter, the indications that have been generated in
the device and marked with a test bit are not output to a routed device relay output.

If test mode is active for the whole device and the parameter (_:151) Oper.bin.outp. under test is disabled,
all functions – except the relay outputs – are in Test state. The relay outputs adopt the Test/Relay blk. state.
The indications marked with a test bit are therefore not output to a routed device relay output.
Output Signal: Functions in Test mode
The output signal Functions in Test mode indicates that one or more functions are in test mode. In
this case, functions also include logical nodes such as binary inputs and outputs as well as CFC without
representation in the information routing. The application templates include pre-routing to the last LED on the
base module of the device.
i
i
NOTE
Activating the (_:151) Oper.bin.outp. under test parameter causes all logical nodes (LPDO) of the relay
outputs to switch into the Test state and thus activates the output signal Functions in Test mode.
Parameter: No mainboard restart
•
Default setting (_:103) No mainboard restart = inactive
With the No mainboard restart parameter, you can determine whether the mainboard restarts if an SEU
event arises in the FPGAs of the mainboard.
Parameter: No BD-Eth-mod.restart
•
Default setting (_:104) No BD-Eth-mod.restart = inactive
With the No BD-Eth-mod.restart parameter, you can determine whether the BD modules restart if an
SEU event arises in the BD modules.
i
i
NOTE
SEU events rarely occur and also rarely have an effect on the device functionality. Nonetheless, a failure
of the device (including over- or subfunction) cannot be completely ruled out. Siemens therefore generally
recommends an automatic device restart if an SEU event occurs, which corrects the memory error, particu-
larly if the module is used for process bus applications.
The automatic device restart in the event of an SEU should only be deactivated if completely undesirable
due to the specific application, for example, because this would switch off an important process. In this
case, the low risk of a failure caused by an SEU must be borne and, if possible, mitigated via redundancy
concepts.
Parameter: LDevice Mod controllable
•
Default setting (_:181) LDevice Mod controllable = inactive
Use the LDevice Mod controllable parameter to control the state of the logical nodes (LLN0) in a logical
device (LD). Place a checkmark on the LDevice Mod controllable parameter if you want to test and
change the behavior of logical nodes individually.
Once the checkmark is placed, the LLN0:Mode can be controlled in a logical device.

Function-Group Type Line
Overview
In the Line function group, all of the functions that are necessary for protecting and monitoring a line can be
used. The Line function group also contains the measuring functions (for more information, see 9 Measured
Values, Energy Values, and Supervision of the Primary System).
You can find the Line function group under each device type in the function library in DIGSI 5. The Line
function group contains all of the protection and supervision functions that you can use for this device
type.These functions are described in 6 Protection and Automation Functions. The following figure shows the
functional scope of the Line function group using the example of a device.
[sc_lib7ST86, 1, en_US]
Figure 5-1
Function Group Overhead Contact Line
For more information about the embedding of the functions in the device, refer to 2 Basic Structure of the
Function. For information about the overall functional scope of the application templates for the various
device types, refer to 4 Applications.
Structure of the Function Group
The Line function group always contains the following blocks:
•
Line data
•
Operational measurement
•
Process monitor
•
Output logic of the function group
These blocks are essential for the function group Line, so they cannot be loaded or deleted.
You can load the protection and supervision functions required for your application in the function group
Line. The functions are available in the function library in DIGSI 5. Functions that are not needed can be
deleted from the function group.

Structure of the Function Group Line
The Line function group has interfaces with
•
Measuring points
•
Circuit-breaker function group
•
Protection communication
Interfaces with Measuring Points
The function group Line receives the required measured values via its interfaces with the measuring points.
If you are using an application template, the function group Line is already connected to the necessary
measuring points.
If you add functions to the function group Line, they will automatically receive the measured values from the
correct measuring points. If you add protection functions to the function group but the necessary measuring
point is not connected, DIGSI 5 reports an inconsistency. Configure the measuring points in DIGSI 5 via the
Function-group connections Editor.
For further information, refer to 2 Basic Structure of the Function.
The function group Line has the following interfaces with the measuring points:
•
Overhead Contact Line Voltage:
The following measurands can be provided via this interface:
–
V Contact line: Overhead contact line voltage or
–
V CL, V nF: Overhead contact line voltage (V FL) and Negative feeder voltage (VnF)
These measurands are necessary for the complete protection of auto transformer systems.
The function group Line must always be connected to the V-FL measuring point.
For more information, refer to the description of the Power-system data starting from 6.1.6 Application
and Setting Notes for Measuring Point V-CL (Contact-Line Voltage).
•
Overhead Contact Line Current:
The following measurands can be provided via this interface:
–
I CL: Overhead contact line current or
–
I CL + I nF: Overhead contact line current (I-FL) and Negative feeder current
These measurands are necessary for the complete protection of auto transformer systems.
The function group Line must always be connected to the I-FL measuring point.
For more information, refer to the description of the Power-system data starting from 6.1.4 Application
and Setting Notes for Measuring Point I-CL (Contact-Line Current).

•
1-phase current:
An individual 1-phase current Ix is provided as a measurand via this interface. The measuring point
I-1ph is required for function de-icing protection in the FG overhead contact line.
For more information, refer to the description of the Power-system data starting from 6.1.5 Application
and Setting Notes for Measuring Point Current 1‑Phase (I-1ph).
Interface to the Circuit-Breaker Function Group
All required data is exchanged between the protection and Circuit-breaker function groups via the interface
with the Circuit-breaker function group. This data includes, for example, the pickup and operate indications
of the protection functions sent in the direction of the circuit-breaker function group and, for example, the
circuit-breaker position information in the direction of the protection function groups.
The Line function group is connected to one or more circuit-breaker function groups. This connection gener-
ally determines:
•
Which circuit breaker(s) is/are activated by the protection functions of the protection function group Line
•
Start of the function Circuit-breaker failure protection (if available in the function group Circuit-
breaker) through the protection functions of the connected protection function group Line
•
Start of the function Automatic reclosing (AREC if available in the function group Circuit-breaker)
through the protection functions of the connected protection function group Line
Besides the general allocation of the protection function group Line to the circuit-breaker function groups,
you can also configure the interface for certain functionalities in detail. Configure the details in DIGSI 5 using
the Circuit-breaker interaction Editor in the function group Line.
In the detail configuration of the interface, you define:
•
Which operate indications of the protection functions go into the generation of the trip command
•
Which protection functions start the automatic reclosing function
•
Which protection functions start the circuit-breaker failure protection function
If you are using an application template, the function groups are already connected to each other, because
this connection is essential to ensure proper operation. You can modify the connection in DIGSI 5 via the
Function-group connections Editor. For more detailed information, refer to 2.1 Embedding of Functions in
the Device. If the connection is missing, DIGSI 5 reports an inconsistency.
Interface with Protection Communication
All required data is exchanged between the protection function group and the protection communication via
the interface with Protection communication. These are, for example, binary signals, measured values and
complex data. Functions such as differential protection or teleprotection scheme exchange information with
other protection devices via the protection interface.
If an application template is used, the protection function group and protection communication are already
connected to each other because this connection is absolutely essential to ensure proper operation.
For further information, refer to 3.6 Protection Communication.
If this connection is missing, DIGSI 5 reports an inconsistency.
Line Data
The line data characterizes the line that is to be protected. The line data applies for all of the functions in the
function group Line.
Process Monitor
The process monitor is always present in the function group Line and cannot be removed. The process
monitor provides the following information in the function group Line:
•
Current-flow criterion:
Detection of an open/closed line based on the flow of minimum current

Output Logic
The output logic treats the pick up and operate indications of the protection and supervision functions in the
function group separately, in either a pickup logic or an output logic. The pickup and output logic generate the
overreaching indications (group signals) of the function group. These group indications are transferred via the
Protection information interface to the function group Circuit breaker and are processed further there.
The pickup indications of the protection and supervision functions in the function group Lineare combined
phase-segregated and output as a group indication.
The operate indications for the protection functions of the function group Line always result in 2-pole tripping
of the device.

Parameter: Rated current
•
Default setting (_:9001:101) Rated current = 1000 A
With the Rated current parameter, you can set the primary rated current for the line to be protected. The
Rated current set here is the reference value for the percentage-measured values and setting values made
in percentages.
If the device works with the IEC 61850 protocol, then you change the setting value of the parameter only
via DIGSI 5 and not directly on the device. If you change the setting value directly on the device, then the
IEC 61850 configuration of the metered values can be faulty.
Parameter: Rated voltage
•
Default setting (_:9001:102) Rated voltage = 15.00 kV
With the Rated voltage parameter, you can set the primary rated voltage for the line to be protected. The
Rated voltage parameter is relevant for the functions Distance protection and Voltage protection. The
Rated voltage set here is the reference value for the percentage-measured values and setting values made
in percentages.
If the device works with the IEC 61850 protocol, then you change the setting value of the parameter only
via DIGSI 5 and not directly on the device. If you change the setting value directly on the device, then the
IEC 61850 configuration of the metered values can be faulty.
Parameter: Rated apparent power
•
Default setting (_:9001:103) Rated apparent power = 15.0 MVA
The Rated apparent power parameter indicates the primary rated apparent power. The Rated appa-
rent power parameter is relevant for the main protection function of the device. The Rated apparent
power indicated here is the reference value for the percentage-measured values and setting values made in
percentages.
If the device works with the IEC 61850 protocol, then you change the setting value of the parameter only

Parameter Value
Description
Contact line (PF)
The protection functions of the FG Line only operate with the contact-line
current (positive feeder) and the contact-line voltage against ground. Faults
in the negative feeder will not be detected. If you want a complete protec-
tion for the auto-transformer system, route a 2nd instance of the respective
protection function to protect the negative feeder.
Negative feeder
The protection functions of the FG Line only operate with the negative-
feeder current and the negative-feeder voltage against ground. Faults in the
contact line will not be detected. If you want a complete protection for the
auto-transformer system, route a 2nd instance of the respective protection
function to protect the contact line (positive feeder).
Pos. + Neg. Feeder
The protection functions of the FG Line operate with the contact-line
voltage against ground and the sum of the current of the contact line (PF)
and the negative feeder
(NF). The entire auto-transformer system is protected. A 2nd instance of the
respective protection function is not required.
The parameter is not relevant for the functions Overload protection and Fault locator.
Parameter: Line angle
•
Default setting (_:9001:108) Line angle = 50°
The Line angle parameter is relevant for the function Distance protection. Calculate the setting value for
the parameter Line angle from the line constants for the line to be protected as follows:
[fo_lwinkl, 1, en_US]
where:
RL
Resistance of the line to be protected
XL
Reactance of the line to be protected
Parameter: Infeed by power inverter
With the parameter Infeed by power inverter, you set whether the contact line is fed via an inverter or
not.
Parameter Value
Description
no
The contact line is fed via a transformer.
yes
The contact line is fed via an inverter.
If the contact line is fed via an inverter, the measurands for current and
voltage during a short circuit behave differently than with classic infeed
via a transformer. The methods of measurement are adapted so that fast
tripping is possible.

The Process monitor function is used in the protection function group Line with voltage and current meas-
urement.
The Process monitor function is preconfigured by the manufacturer with the following function blocks:
•
Current-flow criterion
•
Circuit-breaker condition for the protected object
•
Closure detection
•
Voltage criterion (optional)

The phase currents are provided via the interface to the protection function group.
The I open signal of one phase is generated if one of the following conditions is met:
•
A phase current falls below the set threshold of the Current thresh. CB open parameter. The
hysteresis stabilizes the signal.
•
The corresponding phase current, for example, I A, falls below 10 % of the phase current when the trip
command arrives. If the current does not drop until after a delay due to current transformer influences,
an open pole can therefore be detected quickly even after a high-current fault on the line.

With the Current thresh. CB open parameter, you define the minimum current as the criterion for a
deactivated line. The parameter lies in the Circuit-breaker function group. It acts both in the Circuit-breaker
function group, for example circuit-breaker position recognition, and also for the process monitor in the
protection function group.
If a protection function group with integrated process monitor is connected to several Circuit breaker FGs,
the Current thresh. CB open parameter is present in each FG Circuit breaker. The smallest setting
value of the parameter Current thresh. CB open is used.
Application and Setting Notes (Current-Flow Criterion)
Parameter: Current thresh. CB open
•
Recommended setting value (_:2311:112) Current thresh. CB open = 0.100 A
The Current thresh. CB open parameter is used to define the threshold for the leakage current as the
criterion for a deactivated line.
Set the Current thresh. CB open parameter so that the current measured when the feeder is deacti-
vated falls below the value of the Current thresh. CB open parameter with certainty. The hysteresis is
additionally active if the threshold is exceeded.
If parasitic currents, for example, due to induction, are ruled out when the feeder is deactivated, set the
Current thresh. CB open parameter sensitively.
Siemens recommends a setting value of 0.100 A.

Circuit-Breaker Condition for the Protected Object
Logic
The circuit-breaker position recognition in the Circuit-breaker (CB) function group provides the circuit-breaker
condition by way of the internal signal CB pos. recogn. prot. obj..
The internal indication CB pos. recogn. prot. obj. is available for the other function blocks of the
process monitor and the other functions (for example Trip in the event of weak infeed and Echo function
for teleprotection scheme) within the same function group.
If one of the following 2 conditions is met, the CB pos. recogn. prot. obj. signal is in the Open state:
•
All connected circuit breakers signal the Open state internally.
•
The >Disconnector open input is active.
If the following 2 conditions are met, the CB pos. recogn. prot. obj. signal is in the Closed state:
•
At least one of the connected circuit breakers signals the Closed state internally.
•
The >Disconnector open input is not active.
Closure Detection
Logic
The closure detection enables the immediate tripping of selected protection functions or protection stages
when switching to short circuit or the reduction of the responsivity. The closure detection determines whether
the protected object is switched on.

Figure 5-7
Logic Diagram of the Closure-Detection Function Block
For an applied binary input signal Detected (from function block Manual close), the indication Closure is
always active. The indication Closure can also be activated via the measurand. In addition, the protected
object must be switched off for at least the time Min. time feeder open.
This time is started as follows depending on the Operating mode parameter:
•
For parameter Operating mode = Iopen,Vopen,ManCl:
If the current-flow criterion and the voltage criterion are detected open-circuited.
•
For parameter Operating mode = CB, Iopen, ManCl:
If the circuit-breaker auxiliary contact(s) and the current-flow criterion are detected as open-circuited.
•
For parameter Operating mode = Iopen, ManCl:
If the current-flow criterion is detected as open-circuited.
If the protected object is detected as switched off, the phase-segregated internal output signal Release
(Closure) is formed. The Instantaneous high-current tripping function can trip immediately, for example
with the Release (Closure) signal in the event of connection to a short circuit.
If all the following conditions are active, the Closure indication is activated via the measurands.
•
The protected object is switched off for at least the time Min. time feeder open.
•
The time Action time after closure is running.
•
The current-flow criterion no longer detects the state open-circuited.
The time Action time after closure is started depending on the Operating mode parameter:
•
For parameter Operating mode = Iopen,Vopen,ManCl:
If the current-flow criterion or the voltage criterion is no longer detected open-circuited.
•
For parameter Operating mode = CB, Iopen, ManCl:
If the circuit-breaker auxiliary contact(s) or the current-flow criterion are no longer detected as open-
circuited.
•

With the Operating mode parameter, you set the criteria with which the function block Closure detection
operates.
Parameter Value
Description
Manual close only
The detection of feeder closure is exclusively decided using the binary input
signal Detected (from Manual close function block).
Siemens recommends this setting, if both of the following conditions are
met:
•
The binary input signal Manual On is available on the side of the
system.
•
A closure detection must not happen due to an additional current and
voltage measurement, for example, after an automatic reclosing.
CB, Iopen, ManCl
The closure detection is done additionally with the current measurement
and with the evaluation of connected circuit breaker position contacts.
Iopen, ManCl
The closure detection is done additionally with the current measurement.
For this setting, make sure that the Current thresh. CB open param-
eter is set lower than the lowest possible load current. If this is not ensured,
an open circuit state is detected continuously and each current value that
exceeds the Current thresh. CB open parameter is interpreted as
closure and can lead to unintended tripping.
Note:
For low load currents, Siemens recommends the setting values
Iopen,Vopen,ManCl or CB, Iopen, ManCl.
Parameter: Min. Feeder Open Time
•
Recommended setting value (_:4681:103) Min. time feeder open = 0.25 s
To avoid incorrect closure detection, the Feeder open state must exist for a minimum time (Min. time
feeder open parameter) before the Closure indication can become active. You define the duration of the
release delay with the Min. time feeder open parameter.
Siemens recommends a setting value of 0.25 s.
Parameter: Action Time After Activation
•
Recommended setting value (_:4681:102) Action time after closure = 0.05 s
The Closure indication signals detected closure. With the Action time after closure parameter, you
set the Closure indication to a defined length.
Siemens recommends a setting value of 0.05 s.

Function-Group Type Circuit Breaker
Overview
The Circuit-breaker function group combines all the user functions that relate to a circuit breaker.
You will find the Circuit-breaker function group under each device type in the function library in DIGSI 5. The
Circuit-breaker function group contains all of the protection, control, and supervision functions that you can
use for this device type. The following figure shows, for example, the functional scope of the Circuit-breaker
function group.
[sc_lib7ST8x, 1, en_US]
Figure 5-8
Circuit-Breaker Function Group – Functional Scope
The circuit-breaker type can accept additional basic function blocks for protection functions.
The available functions are described in 6 Protection and Automation Functions and 7 Control Functions
beschrieben.
Structure of the Function Group
Besides the user functions, the Circuit-breaker function group contains certain functionalities that are essen-
tial for general purposes and therefore cannot be loaded or deleted:
•
Trip logic
•
Mapping the physical circuit breaker
•
Circuit-breaker position recognition for protection functions
•
Detection of manual closure
•

Structure of the Circuit-Breaker Function Group
The Circuit-breaker function group has interfaces with:
•
Measuring points
•
Protection function groups (for example the protection function group Overhead contact line)
Interfaces with Measuring Points
The function group contains the measured values needed from the measuring points associated with this
function group.
If an application template is used, the function group is connected to the measuring point I-CL because this
connection is essential. It can be necessary to connect additional measuring points to the function group,
depending on the nature of the user functions used. The configuration is done via the Function-group
connections editor in DIGSI 5.
If a user function, for example, synchronization, is used in the function group but the required measuring
point has not linked to it, DIGSI 5 reports an inconsistency. This inconsistency provides an indication of the
missing measuring-point connection.
The function group Circuit breaker has interfaces with the following measuring points:
•
Overhead contact line current:
You can provide the following measurands via this interface:
–
I CL: Overhead contact line current or
–
I CL + I nF: Total overhead contact line current (I-CL) and Negative feeder current (I nF)
These measurands are required to fully protect auto transformer systems.
The function group Circuit breaker must always be linked to the I-FL measuring point.
For more information, refer to the description of the Power-system data starting from 6.1.4 Application
and Setting Notes for Measuring Point I-CL (Contact-Line Current).

•
Overhead contact line voltage:
You can provide the following measurands via this interface:
–
V Contact line: Overhead contact line voltage or
–
V CL, V nF: Overhead contact line voltage (V FL) and Negative feeder voltage (V nF)
These measurands are required to fully protect auto transformer systems.
The connection to the corresponding measuring point is necessary only if a user function that needs the
voltage as measurand is used, for example, to make use of the Synchronization or Automatic reclosing
function.
For more information, refer to the description of the Power-system data starting from 6.1.6 Application
and Setting Notes for Measuring Point V-CL (Contact-Line Voltage).
•
Voltage, 1-phase:
Any 1-phase voltage Vx is supplied as a measurand via this interface. The V-1ph measuring point is only
used for the synchrocheck in the function group Circuit breaker.
For more information, refer to the description of the Power-system data starting from 6.1.7 Application
and Setting Notes for Measuring Point Voltage 1‑Phase (V-1ph)
Interface with Protection-Function Groups
All required data are exchanged between the protection function group and the function groups Circuit
breaker via the interfaces of the function group Circuit breaker. This data includes, for example, the pickup
and operate indications of the protection functions sent in the direction of the function group circuit-breaker
and, for example, the circuit-breaker position information in the direction of the protection function groups.
If an application template is used, the function groups are connected to each other because this connection is
essential to ensure proper operation. You can modify the connection using the Function-group connections
Editor in DIGSI 5.
You can find more detailed information in 2.1 Embedding of Functions in the Device.
If the linkage is missing, DIGSI 5 reports an inconsistency.
Besides the general assignments of the protection function group or groups to the Circuit-breaker function
groups, you can also configure the interface for certain functionalities in detail:
•
Which operate indications of the protection functions are included when the trip command is generated?
•
Which protection functions activate the Automatic reclosing function?
•
Which protection functions activate the Circuit-breaker failure protection function?
You can find more detailed information in 2.1 Embedding of Functions in the Device.
Application and Setting Notes
Interface with Measuring Points
The interface with the current system of the overhead contact line must have been configured. Otherwise,
DIGSI 5 supplies an inconsistency message.
If the function Synchronization is used, the measuring points that represent voltages V1 and V2 of the
power-supply units to be synchronized must be connected.
For further information refer to 7.5 Synchronization Function.
Interface with Protection-Function Groups
The protection-function group is connected to 2 circuit breakers (2 function groups Circuit breaker) for 1 1/2
circuit-breaker layouts.

With the parameter Rated normal current, you set the primary current, which serves as a reference
for all current-related % values within the function group Circuit breaker. This applies both for operational
measured values and for setting values in %.
Enter the primary rated current of the protected object here.
If the device works with the IEC 61850 protocol, then you change the setting value of the parameter only
via DIGSI 5 and not directly on the device. If you change the setting value directly on the device, then the
IEC 61850 configuration of the metered values can be faulty.

Parameter: Current Threshold Circuit Breaker Open
•
Default setting (_:2311:112) Current thresh. CB open = 0.10 A
With the parameter Current thresh. CB open, you specify the current threshold below which the
circuit-breaker pole or the circuit breaker is recognized as open.
Set the parameter Current thresh. CB open so that the current measured when the circuit-breaker pole
is open will certainly fall below the parameterized value. If parasitic currents (for example, due to induction)
are excluded with the line deactivated, you can make a secondary setting of the value with a high degree of
sensitivity, to 0.05 A for example.
If no special requirements exist, Siemens recommends retaining the setting value of 0.10 A for secondary
purposes.
Parameter: Phase selection of CL/nF
•
Default setting (_:9001:130) Phase selection of CL/nF = Contact line (PF)
The parameter Phase selection of CL/nF is only relevant to auto transformer systems.

Trip Logic
Function Description
The Trip logic function block receives the group operate indication from the Protection function group or
Protection function groups and forms the protection trip command that is transmitted to the Circuit-breaker
function block.
The Circuit-breaker function block activates the device contact and thus causes the circuit breaker to open
(see 5.2.7 Circuit Breaker). The command output time is also effective here.
The trip logic also decides when the protection trip command is reset (see Figure 5-11).

Trip-Command Reset
Once a trip command is issued, it is stored (see Figure 5-10).
You determine the criteria for resetting a trip command that has been issued with the parameter Reset of
trip command. The following setting options are possible:
•
with dropout
If the function that initiated tripping resets its operate indication the trip command is reset. This occurs
typically with dropout. Command reset of the trip command takes place regardless of verification of the
circuit-breaker condition.

•
with I< & aux.contact
For these criteria, the state of the circuit breaker is also taken into account as a further criterion in
addition to the dropout of the tripping function (operate indication is reset by command). You can select
whether the state is determined by means of the current (with I<) or by means of the current in
conjunction with the circuit-breaker auxiliary contacts (with I< & aux.contact). The behavior of
these setting options only differs in one situation of the circuit-breaker state. If the circuit breaker is
in the opening state, the trip command is reset in the case of the option with I<, whereas it is not
reset yet in the case of the option with with I< & aux.contact. The opening state is detected
if the auxiliary contacts still detect the circuit breaker as being closed and opening is detected via the
decreasing current flow.
As long as the circuit breaker is detected unambiguously as closed (fully closed), the trip command will
not be reset with these setting options.
The information about the condition of the circuit breaker and the determination of the various condi-
tions is supplied by the Circuit-breaker position recognition function block. You can find further infor-
mation in chapter 5.2.8 Circuit-Breaker Position Recognition for Protection-Related Auxiliary Functions.

If the load current in the system cannot be interrupted during the protec-
tion device test and the test current is fed in parallel with the load current
this setting is useful.
The setting can be selected for special applications in which the trip

Circuit Breaker
Overview
The function block Circuit breaker represents the physical switch in the SIPROTEC 5 device.
The basic tasks of this function block are:
•
Operation of the circuit breaker (CB)
•
Acquisition of the circuit-breaker auxiliary contacts
•
Acquisition of other circuit-breaker information
The function block Circuit breaker provides the following information:
•
Number of switching cycles
•
Breaking current, breaking voltage, and breaking frequency
•
Summation breaking current
Tripping, Opening and Closing the Circuit Breaker
The circuit breaker is operated in the following situations:
•
Tripping of the circuit breaker as a result of a protection trip command
•
Opening of the circuit breaker as a result of control operations
•
Closing of the circuit breaker as a result of an automatic reclosing or of control operations
Tripping is always the result of a protection function. The operate indications of the individual protection
functions are summarized in the Trip logic function block. The trip command that causes the tripping in the
function block Circuit breaker is generated there.
For the operational handling of the circuit breaker, the function block Circuit breaker provides the output

Acquisition of Circuit-Breaker Auxiliary Contacts and Further Information
To determine the circuit-breaker position, the function block Circuit breaker provides position signals. These
signals are of the Double-point indication (DPC) type. A double-point indication can be routed to 2 binary
inputs so that the open and closed circuit-breaker switch positions can be reliably acquired.

Acquisition of the circuit-breaker switch position
The switch position CB 2-pole open and/or the position CB 2-pole closed
can be detected by routing to 1 or 2 binary inputs.
The signals must be routed to the binary input that is with the CB auxiliary contacts. The open and closed
signals do not necessarily have to be routed in parallel. The advantage of parallel routing is that it can be used
to determine an intermediate or disturbed position. If you route only one signal (open or closed), you cannot
determine an intermediate position or a disturbed position.
In the monitoring direction, the position signals generate the following information when the open and
closed positions are detected (see following table). This information is further processed by the Circuit-
breaker position recognition and Control function blocks.

This can be used to indicate the health of the physical circuit breaker.
For this, all failure information of the circuit breaker must be detected
via a binary input. This failure information can set the appropriate
state of the External health signal with a CFC chart (using the
BUILD_ENS block).
The signal has no effect on the health of the function block.
Definitive Tripping, Circuit-Breaker Tripping Alarm Suppression
Definitive Tripping
Definitive tripping is always pending whenever the Automatic reclosing (AREC) function does not carry out
any reclosing after tripping. It follows that this is the case whenever an automatic reclosing is not present or
the AREC has been switched off.
Circuit-Breaker Tripping Alarm Suppression
In certain systems, the user may wish to actuate an alarm (for example, a horn) when tripping (circuit-breaker
tripping) occurs. This alarm should not be issued if it is to be reclosed automatically after tripping, or if it is to
be closed or opened via the control. The alarm is only to be issued in the event of definitive tripping.
Depending on how the alarm is generated (for example, triggered by a fleeting contact of the circuit breaker),
the Alarm suppression signal can be used to suppress the alarm.
If one of the following conditions is met, the Alarm suppression signal is generated:
•
The definitive protection tripping is not present.
•
The integrated automatic reclosing function executes a closure.
•
The integrated control executes a closure or opening action.
•
The function Manual close detects an external closing.

•
2-pole tripping via the protection
•
2-pole opening via the control
•
2-pole closing by the automatic reclosing or via the control
[lolsan2p-021111-01.vsd, 1, en_US]

Activation of the Circuit Breaker
By routing the signals Trip/open cmd. to 1 or 2 binary outputs, you can carry out 1-pole, 1.5-pole, and
2-pole activations of the circuit breaker. For a detailed description of this, refer to 7.2.2.3 Connection Variants
of the Circuit Breaker.
i

NOTE
Do not confuse these 1-pole, 1.5-pole, and 2-pole activations of the circuit breaker with 1-pole or 2-pole
tripping of the circuit breaker.
Routing for Analysis of the Circuit-Breaker Switch Position
For certain functions of the device, it is useful to detect the circuit-breaker switch position via its auxiliary
contacts. These data are for example:
•
Function block Circuit-breaker position recognition
•
Function Circuit-breaker failure protection
•
Function block Control
The operating principle of the auxiliary contacts is described in the individual functions.
Siemens recommends recording the information Circuit breaker is open in 2 poles and Circuit
breaker is closed in 2 poles via auxiliary contacts. This is the optimal configuration for the control
functionality. For purely protection applications, it is also enough to capture just one of the 2 circuit-breaker
positions.

With this setting, the measured values are reported
if the circuit breaker is opened either via the control

With this setting, the measured values are only
reported if the circuit breaker is opened via the trip
command of a protection function.
Measured Values
When a protection function opens the circuit breaker, the following measured values can be stored in the fault
log:
•
Break.-current phs A
•
Break.-current phs B
•
Break. voltage phs A
•
Break. voltage phs B
Output Signal: Indication Suppression
Whereas in the case of feeders without an automatic reclosing function, every trip command by a protection
function is final, the use of an automatic reclosing function should only cause the motion detector of the
circuit breaker (fleeting contact on the circuit breaker) to trigger an alarm if tripping of the circuit breaker
is definitive (see next figure for more details). Likewise, an alarm should not be triggered for switching
operations by the control.
For this, the alarm activation circuit should be looped via a suitably routed output contact of the device
(output signal Alarm suppression). In the idle state and when the device is switched off, this contact is
always closed. For this, an output contact with a break contact must be routed. The contact opens whenever
the output signal Alarm suppression becomes active, so that tripping or a switching operation does not
cause an alarm (see the logic in Figure 5-13).

[lo_zust3p, 1, en_US]
Figure 5-21
Overview of the Circuit-Breaker Condition Position Function
Based on the link between the information from the auxiliary contacts and the current flow, shown in
Figure 5-21, the circuit breaker can assume the following positions. The following table shows the possible
circuit-breaker conditions:
Circuit-Breaker Condition
Description
Open
The circuit-breaker pole is detected unambiguously as open according to
both criteria.
Closed
The circuit-breaker pole is detected unambiguously as closed according to
both criteria.
Possibly open, possibly
closed
These conditions can occur if the information is incomplete due to the
routing of the auxiliary contacts and the condition can no longer be deter-
mined reliably. These uncertain conditions are evaluated differently
by certain functions.
Opening
This is a dynamically occurring condition that results when, while a trip
command is active and the auxiliary contact is still closed, the current is
detected to have fallen below the threshold value. The reason for that is
that the current-flow criterion takes effect faster than the auxiliary contact
can open.
Detection Manual Closure (for AREC and Process Monitor)

Detection of Manual Closure (for Process Monitor)
The Manual closure function block detects any closure carried out by hand. This information is used in

External Manual Closure
An external manual closure is communicated to the device via the input signal >Input. The input signal can
also be connected directly to the control circuit of the circuit-breaker closing coil. Detection via the input
signal >Input is also blocked if the circuit breaker is closed or if a protection trip is active.
Internal Manual Closure
Manual closure is detected in all cases if a close command is transmitted by the internal control function
of the device. This is possible because the control carries out plausibility checks itself and is also subject to
interlocking.

If external close commands are possible (actuation of the circuit breaker by other devices), which are not
intended to promptly detect a manual closure, this can be ensured in 2 ways:
•
The input signal is connected in such a way that it is not activated in the event of external close
commands.
•
The external close command is connected to the blocking input >Block manual close for manual
closure detection.
Parameter: Action time
•
Recommended setting value (_:101) Action time = 0.30 s
In order to ensure independence from manual activation of the input signal, the detection function is

Parameter: CB open dropout delay
•
Default setting (_:102) CB open dropout delay = 0.00 s
With the CB open dropout delay parameter, you can maintain the effectiveness of internal indication CB
open for the set time. If the input signal >Input becomes active after external delayed manual closure, the

Function-Group Type Analog Units
Overview
The function group Analog units is used to map analog units and communicate with them. Analog units are
external devices, such as RTD units, or analog plug-in modules or measuring-transducer modules.
You can find the function group Analog units for many device types in the Global DIGSI 5 library.
[sc_20_maee, 3, en_US]
Figure 5-24
Analog Unit Function Group in DIGSI
Structure of the Function Group
If the device has a measuring transducer, it is automatically mapped in the function group Analog units. If
one or more RTD units are connected to the device, you have to load one or more RTD unit Ether. or RTD unit
serial functions from the Global DIGSI 5 library in order to map the RTD units.
If the device is connected to a power-plant control system or another protection device, you must load one or
more Temperature acquisition via protocols functions from the Global DIGSI 5 library to form the protocols.
The following figure shows the structure of the function group.

Measured-Value Calculation
The function 20-mA channel processes a single 20-mA current signal supplied by the 20-mA unit of the
corresponding channel. The 20-mA current measured value is converted into the correct physical quantities
such as temperature or pressure. In each 20-mA functional unit (Ether. and serial) there are always 12 of the
20-mA channel function blocks, even if fewer channels are connected with the 20-mA unit. The calculated
values are available for further processing via CFC, GOOSE, protocols, and the display image.
Measured-Value Processing
The 20-mA unit typically transmits a value which represents a physical quantity, such as a temperature or
a pressure. Therefore, the device must contain a characteristic curve that maps the physical quantity to the
20-mA value. If you do not activate the Range active setting (no x in the check box), the function operates
over the range 0 mA to 20 mA. If a value smaller than 0 mA or greater than 20 mA is active at the input of the
20-mA unit, the measured value is identified as invalid. The setting of the range for the scaled value goes from
a usable range of 0 mA to 20 mA. The following figure shows an example.
[sckanumw-190214-01, 1, en_US]
Figure 5-29
Settings for Example 1
In this example, the measured value 0 mA means a temperature of 0 °C and the measured value 20 mA means
a temperature of 100 °C. So enter as Unit = °C and Conversion factor = 100. The resolution (decimal
place) of the temperature value can be chosen; for a decimal place, select Resolution = 0.1.

If you activate the Range active setting, then 4 additional parameters Upper limit, Lower limit,
Upper limit - Sensor, and Lower limit - Sensor appear. The parameters Upper limit and
Lower limit indicate the range of the input current in mA. The setting Upper limit - Sensor is the
calculated measured value if the input current corresponds to the value in the Upper limit setting. The
setting Lower limit - Sensor is the calculated measured value if the input current corresponds to the
value in the Lower limit setting. The setting of the range for the scaled value corresponds to the useable
range between Lower limit and Upper limit (see following figure).

20-mA Unit Serial
Overview
The function 20-mA unit Serial:
•
Provides serial communications with a 20-mA unit via the Modbus protocol and records the values
measured by the 20-mA unit
•
Transforms the measured 20-mA values into slowly changing process variables such as temperature or
gas pressure
•
Makes the recorded process tags available to CFC, GOOSE, protocols and the device display
•
Monitors communication with the 20-mA unit
The function 20-mA unit Serial is structured in the same way as the function 20-mA Unit Ether.. The
mode of operation is also identical. The only difference is that the measured values are transferred to the
communication module via a serial connection instead of an Ethernet connection.
You can find more information in Chapter 5.3.3.2 Structure of the Function.

V/I-Measuring-Transducer Unit with Fast Inputs
Overview
The fast analog measuring-transducer inputs process voltage values (DC -10 V to +10 V) as well as current
values (DC -20 mA to 20 mA).
The function MT fast input:
•
Provides sampled values for recording in the fault record (the maximum sampling frequency is 8 kHz
for all other SIPROTEC 5 devices). The recorded sampling frequency results from the setting of the
fault-recorder function.
•
Calculated measured values from the sampled values. These measured values have been deduced from
the arithmetic mean values. The measuring range for the mean-value calculation is adjustable in the
interval from 10 ms to 100 ms.

•
Converts the measured current or voltage values into process values, for example, temperature, gas
pressure, etc.
•
Provides the recorded process variables for further processing by the fault recorder, the CFC, and in
GOOSE-applications for transmission via communication protocols, and for visualization
The fast measuring-transducer inputs are located on the IO212 module with 8 inputs (optionally current or
voltage inputs), and the IO210 module with 4 inputs (optionally current or voltage inputs).
Structure of the Function
The function MT fast input works in the function group Analog units and contains the number of available
measuring-transducer inputs, depending on the hardware configuration. You can configure these channels
independently from one another either as current or voltage inputs.
[dw_mu-structure, 1, en_US]
Figure 5-44
Structure/Embedding of the Function
Function Description
Once you have instantiated the MT fast input function, it will be visible in the project tree in the function
group Analog units. You can find the function group Analog units in DIGSI in the Settings folder.
If you open the subdirectory MT fast input, you reach the setting sheet for the respective input (for more
details, see 5.3.6.4 Application and Setting Notes).
The hardware is designed in such a way that either a current or a voltage can be processed at each input.
Use the corresponding terminals (see Hardware manual). Configure the input in accordance with the selected
connection (Parameter TD input-signal type). With the parameter Measuring window, you set the
measuring range with which the arithmetic mean value is determined. With the parameter Measuring
window, you also determine measurement speed for the input. For example, a setting of 100 ms means that
the measured value is updated every 100 ms.

Parameters of the Measuring-Transducer Channels.
The fast measuring-transducer channels can be configured either as current or as voltage inputs. Apart from
this, their function corresponds to the basic function of the 20-mA channels (see chapter 5.3.3.5 20-mA
Channel).
Application and Setting Notes
Parameter: TD input-signal type
•
Default setting (_:101) TD input-signal type = Current input
With the parameter TD input-signal type, you determine whether the measuring-transducer input
channel works as a Current input or as a Voltage input.
Make sure that the selected channel has also been wired correctly (see Hardware manual, Input and Output
Module IO212).
Parameter: Unit
•
Default setting (_:103) Unit = A
With the parameter Unit, you set the physical unit of measurement of the measured values. The possible
setting values are listed in the settings table.
Parameter: Measuring window
•
Default setting (_:142) Measuring window = 10 ms
With the parameter Measuring window, you set the measuring window that is used to determine the
arithmetic mean value from the sampled values. In case of slowly varying signals, Siemens recommends
setting the top value to 100 ms. With this value, a new, current measured value is provided every 100 ms for
further processing.
Parameter: Range active

If you do not activate the Range active parameter, the function assumes a range of -20 mA to +20 mA
or -10 V to +10 V. The setting of the range for the scaled value then assumes a usable range of -20 mA to
+20 mA or -10 V to +10 V.
If you activate the parameter Range active, the 4 additional parameters Upper limit,Upper limit -
Sensor, Lower limit, and Lower limit - Sensor appear.
Note that this setting is activated by either placing, or not placing the relevant check mark in DIGSI (see
Figure 5-45).
Parameter: Conversion factor
•
Default setting (_:104) Conversion factor = 1.00
With the parameter Conversion factor, you set the conversion factor for the measuring transducer.
Parameter: Upper limit, Upper limit - Sensor, Lower limit, and Lower limit - Sensor
With the following parameters, you set the scaling of the measuring variables. By that, you can scale in an
application-specific way:
•
Default setting Upper limit = 20.00 mA
•
Default setting Upper limit - Sensor = 1.00
•
Default setting Lower limit = -20.00 mA
•
Default setting Lower limit - Sensor = 1.00
With these setting parameters, you set the operating range of the measuring transducer as well as the
conversion of the values transmitted to the sensor values. Harmonize the operating range of the measuring
transducer with the transmitter of the sensor. Using the free scalability of the system, you can meet different
requirements. The following figure shows the setting parameters in general terms.

Figure 5-46
Scaling Principle
If you keep the preset limiting values, the following conditions are possible:
•
If the input current is < 2.000 mA
The function issues the indication Broken wire and the quality of the output value is invalid. The
functions that use the output value as the measured value can be deactivated.
•
If the input current is > 2.500 mA
The indication Broken wire drops out.
Setting Example 1:
A measuring transducer transmitting a current signal of 4 mA to 20 mA is used as a transmitter. Currents
well below -25.6 mA or above +25.6 mA indicate a transmitter failure. A sensor detecting a temperature
is attached to the transmitter. The upper value corresponds to 200 °C and the lower value to -100 °C. This
results in the following characteristic. In accordance with the set characteristic curve, the function calculates
the sensor value from the measured current. The coefficients of the linear equation (gradient and foot point)
are calculated from the set threshold and the sensor values are determined. A supplied current of 9.333 mA
corresponds to a temperature of 0 °C.

applications are possible, if necessary. The limits are at approx. +20 mA and -20 mA or +10 V and -10 V.
Setting Example 2:
For special applications, the transmitter sends a maximum of ±12 V. This voltage shall be issued accordingly as
sensor voltage.
Set the parameters as follows:
•
Upper limit = 10.00 V
•
Upper limit - Sensor = 10.00 V
•
Lower limit = -10.00 V
•
Lower limit - Sensor = -10.00 V
With this setting, a signal of 12 V is issued as a 12-V measured value (see following figure).

RTD Unit Ethernet
Overview
The RTD unit Ether. function:
•
Communicates with an external RTD unit via the Slave Unit Protocol (SUP) and records the measured
temperatures from the RTD unit
•
Provides the captured temperatures to the temperature monitoring function
•
Monitors communication with the RTD unit
Structure of the Function
The RTD unit Ether. function can only work in the Analog units function group. A maximum of 20 function
instances can work simultaneously. Each instance contains 12 preconfigured sensor function blocks.

Communication with an RTD Unit
The function is used to communicate with an RTD unit connected via an Ethernet connection. If the connec-
tion of the function is successfully established to the external RTD unit via the Ethernet interface, the RTD unit
transmits the temperatures of all connected sensors to the RTD unit Ether. function. For the connection to
be established successfully, specific communication settings must be set, see chapter 5.3.7.4 Application and
Setting Notes.
The RTD unit Ziehl TR1200 IP supports only an Ethernet connection of 10 MBit/s. A direct connection to a
100-Mbit communication module is therefore not possible. For this reason, you must connect the RTD unit
to the communication module via a 10/100 MBit/s autosensing switch which automatically recognizes the
transmission rates and adapts them accordingly. Further information can be found in the Application and
setting notes, see chapter 5.3.7.4 Application and Setting Notes.
Error Responses
The following table lists the conditions under which the Health status transitions to the Alarm or Warning
state.
Table 5-4
Error Responses
Error Description
Status Health
The RTD unit Ether. function cannot establish a
connection with a communication module.
Alarm
The connection between the communication module
and the RTD unit causes a time-out.
Warning
A communication module has not received any more
data from the RTD unit for 9 sec.
Warning
The Failure signal is issued as soon as one of the sensor function blocks reports a failure.
Application and Setting Notes
Parameter: Port
•
Default setting (_:2311:103) Port = port J
Use the Port parameter to define over which port the external RTD unit is connected to the SIPROTEC 5
device.
If you want to connect the external RTD unit to the integrated Ethernet interface, set the parameter Port =
Port J. If you want to connect the external RTD unit to an Ethernet plug-in module, set the parameter Port
= Port F, Port E, Port P, or Port N.
You can connect directly the RTD unit to the device via the internal 10-Mbit Ethernet port J. If you operate
the RTD unit on another port via a 100-Mbit communication module, you need an interconnected 10/100-Mbit
autosensing switch, which adapts transmission rates accordingly.
Parameter: IP address
•
Default setting (_:2311:104) IP address = 10.16.60.1
With the parameter IP address, you set the IP address of the RTD unit connected to the communication
module via the SUP protocol. Every RTD unit has to be assigned a unique IP address. The IP address to be set
depends on your network configuration. You can set any valid IPv4 address that does not cause conflicts with
other IP addresses in the network. Set an appropriate IP address first at the Ziehl TR1200 IP RTD unit. Then
specify the parameter IP address for the communication module to the same address.
Settings on the RTD Unit
The Ziehl TR1200 IP RTD unit is set with the front keys or in a Web browser on a laptop computer via its
Ethernet interface. Set the connection type of the sensors (3-wire connection or resistance value for 2-wire
connection), the idle state of the fault-indication relay, as well as the IP interface setting.

The code lock has to be switched off for parameterization. This is only possible using the front keys of the RTD
unit. The code lock is off (switched off) in as-delivered condition and has pin 504.
For detailed information on the settings, refer to the TR1200 IP manual that comes with the RTD unit. The
documents are also available in the SIPROTEC download area (http://www.siprotec.de) under Accessories ->
7XV5662-xAD.
For an Ethernet connection to a SIPROTEC 5 device communicating with the RTD unit TR1200 IP via the SUP
protocol (Slave Unit Protocol), the Modbus TCP setting must be activated in the RTD unit. You can activate
the Modbus TCP protocol using the function keys under the tcP. → Mod / on menu item or with the Web
browser in the TCP/UDP Config tab. The RTD (RTD protocol) and UDP Port settings have no effect here. The
Modbus TCP port is permanently set to 502 and cannot be changed.

[lo_tmpval, 1, en_US]
Figure 5-51
Logic Diagram of the Temperature Sensor Function Block
Measured Temperature Value
The Temperature sensor function block processes one single measured temperature value delivered from the
RTD unit for the assigned sensor. 12 temperature sensor function blocks are always available in each RTD unit
function (both via Ethernet and serial), even if fewer sensors are connected to the RTD unit.
Various temperature sensor types are supported: Pt100, Ni100, and Ni120 sensors. The function block is
notified regarding the selection of connected type via the Sensor type parameter.
The function block delivers a measured temperature value in °C or °F as an output variable. The measured
temperature value is available as an operational measured value and can be monitored by the Temperature
supervision function.
Error Responses
If the measured input value is determined to be incorrect, the quality attribute of the output measured
temperature value is set to invalid. The statuses for Health and Error take the statuses in accordance with

RTD Unit, Serial
Overview
The RTD unit serial function:
•
Communicates with an external RTD unit serial via the Slave Unit Protocol (SUP) and records the meas-
ured temperatures from the RTD unit
•
Provides the captured temperatures to the temperature supervision function
•
Monitors communication with the RTD unit
The RTD unit Serial function is set up structurally in the same manner as the RTD unit Ether. function. The
mode of operation is also identical (see 5.3.7.3 Communication with an RTD Unit).
Application and Setting Notes
Parameter: Port
•
Default setting (_:2311:103) Port = F
With the parameter Port, you set the slot for the communication module that will be used for the connection
with an external RTD unit.
If you want to connect the external RTD unit to an Ethernet plug-in module, set the parameter Port = Port
F , Port E, Port P, or plug-in module position.

Parameter: Channel number
•
Default setting (_:2311:105) Channel number = 1
A serial communication module optionally uses 2 channels. With the parameter Channel number, you set
the channel number (1 or 2) through which the RTD unit is connected to the device. The communication
module inputs are labeled with the channel numbers.
Parameter: Slave address
•
Default setting (_:2311:106) Slave address = 1
With the parameter Slave address, you define the device address of the RTD unit. If only one RTD unit is
connected to the serial bus, the default value 1 can be used. The same device address has to be set on the RTD
unit. The device address is important for distinguishing among several RTD units connected to a serial bus. Set
a unique device address (for example 1, 2, and 3 when connecting 3 RTD units) for each RTD unit and the
same device address for the parameter Slave address in the 3 RTD unit serial functions.

NOTE
If the secondary rated current of the current transformers is 5 A, note the following:
•
The possible setting range for the current parameter in DIGSI and on the device can be larger than
100 A (secondary).
•
Currents greater than 100 A (secondary) can lead to a saturation of the device-internal transformer!
•
Do not set any values larger than 100 A (secondary)!
Parameter: Current range
•
Setting value (_:20761:117) Current range = 100 x IR
The parameter Current range shows the dynamic range for the current input. Regardless of the setting
value for the parameter Rated secondary current, the parameter Current range is permanently set
to 100 x IR.
Parameter: Internal CT type
•
(_:20761:118) Internal CT type = CT protection
The parameter Internal CT type cannot be adjusted and indicates the internal current-transformer type.
Parameter: Neutr.point in dir.of ref.obj
•
Default setting (_:20761:116) Neutr.point in dir.of ref.obj = yes
With the parameter Neutr.point in dir.of ref.obj, you set the direction of the neutral point of the
current transformer. Often, the neutral point of the current transformer is determined by the direction of the
protected object (for example, in the direction of the line or transformer). For this reason, the default setting
of the parameter was defined as yes.
When switching the parameter, the direction of the phase currents is rotated device-internally.
Parameter: Parallel infeed connection
•
Default setting (_:20761:129) Parallel infeed connection = no
With the parameter Parallel infeed connection, you set whether the device is connected to the
1-phase railway power system in H-connection via 2 current transformers or not.
The parameter is only visible if you have set the connection type I CL + I nF in the measuring-point routing of
Measuring point I-CL.
Parameter: Magnitude correction
•
Default setting (_:3841:103) Magnitude correction = 1.000
When using the Magnitude correction parameter, you set the magnitude (magnitude correction) for the
current input. This allows you to correct the tolerances of the primary current transformer phase-selectively.
The magnitude correction may be required for high-precision measurements. Use a comparison measurement
to determine the setting value (for example, a high-precision measuring-voltage transformer). If a primary
correction is not necessary, retain the default setting.

Distance Protection Contact Line
Overview of Functions 
The function Distance protection of contact line (ANSI 21 N):
•
Is a selective short-circuit protection for contact lines and auto-transformer systems
•
Is suitable for use at all voltage levels
•
Is suitable for use in 16.7-Hz, 25-Hz, 50-Hz, 60-Hz electrical power systems
Structure of the Function
You can add the function Distance protection contact line to the function group Contact line. In auto-trans-
former systems, you can create a 2nd instance for separate protection of the feeder line.
The function Distance protection contact line consists of the following blocks:
•
General
•
Distance zones
•
Zone fault clearance
•
AREC zone
•
Output logic
The function Distance protection contact line does not contain any preconfigured factory-set zones.
If you use the application templates Contact line, 1-phase or Contact line, AT system, the function Distance
protection contact line is preconfigured with factory settings of 2 zones with combined characteristic curve,
without startup stage.
A maximum of 16 zones can be operated simultaneously in the function.
The zones with startup stage have additional criteria to differentiate more easily between load states and short
circuits.
A special zone for phase-fault clearance is available for contact-line systems with sections fed by a 3-phase
system, refer to 6.2.10.1 Description .

The following figure shows the basic structure of the function Distance protection contact line.
[dw structure distance protection, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-2
Structure/Embedding of the Function
Mode of Operation
The function Distance protection contact line measures current I and voltage V at the protection location.
If the measured current exceeds the parameterized Min. phase-current thresh, the impedance Z is
calculated. The function assigns the impedance phasor Z into the zones and determines the direction of the
short circuit. If the pickup conditions of a zone are met, the time delay starts. If the pickup conditions are still
met after expiration of the time delay, the zone trips.
Auto-Transformer Systems
In auto-transformer systems, you can use the sum of the currents on the contact line (contact line = ICL) and
the feeder line (negative feeder = INF) to calculate the impedance I = ICL + INF.
For more information about phase selection, refer to Parameter: Phase selection of CL/nF, Page 237.
Zone Assignment
The calculated impedance phasor is assigned into the zones. For each zone, an operate curve is defined in the
R-X plane.
The following zones with different operate curves are available in the DIGSI 5 library:
•
Contact line, combined
•
Contact line, combined with startup stage
•
Contact line, polygon
•
Contact line, polygon with startup stage
For a description of the operate curves, refer to 6.2.7.1 Description, 6.2.8.1 Description.
Direction Determination
You define for each zone whether the zone should work forward, reverse, or non-directional. For directional
zones, you define the Directional mode in the R-X plane. When assigning the impedance phasors in the R-X
plane, the direction is analyzed additionally.
For further information, refer to 6.2.6 Direction Determination.

C53000-G5040-C028-2, Edition 07.2024


Output Logic
The output logic of the function Distance protection contact line links the output indications of the zones
and forms the group output indications of the function, refer to 6.2.13 Output Logic of the Distance Protec-
tion.
Influence of the Inrush-Current Detection
If the device is equipped with the function Inrush-current detection, the distance protection can be stabilized
against tripping due to transformer-inrush currents. You can block individual distance zones via interaction
with the inrush-current detection.
In case of blocking, the distance zone that is linked to the inrush-current detection does not pick up. The
function Inrush-current detection signals the blocking through a corresponding indication. If the blocking
drops out and the pickup condition for the linked distance zone is still met, the pickup is signaled and the
corresponding time delay starts. After the time delay has expired, the operate indication is generated. The
blocking can only be set if the central function Inrush-current detection is in effect. See 6.17 Inrush-Current
Detection.
Application and Setting Notes – General Settings
Set the following parameters in the block General. The setting values are valid for all zones in the distance
protection.
Parameter: Zone timer start
•
Recommended setting value (_:21031:101) Zone timer start = on dist. pickup
The Zone timer start parameter is used to determine the time at which the time delays of the zones
start.
Parameter Value
Description
on dist. pickup
If the time delays of all zones start simultaneously, select this setting.
Siemens recommends using the default setting.
on zone pickup
The time delay for the zone starts with zone pickup.
If you need to coordinate the function with other distance or overcurrent-
time protection functions, select this setting.
Parameter: Min. phase-current thresh
•
Recommended setting value (_:21031:103) Min. phase-current thresh = 0.100 A
With the parameter Min. phase-current thresh, you set the pickup threshold for releasing the impe-
dance calculation. Set the parameter Min. phase-current thresh for the specific application.
Set the Min. phase-current thresh parameter to a very sensitive value (10 % of Irated). If the minimum
phase current is exceeded, the distance protection calculates the impedance. The sensitive setting allows you
to ensure the backup function of the distance protection in case of remote faults in other line sections. If
the minimum phase current in some short circuits – depending on system conditions – is not exceeded, you
will have to take special measures for the weak infeed. Siemens recommends using the default setting Min.
phase-current thresh = 0.100 A.

Direction Determination
For each zone, you define if the zone operates forward, reverse, or non-directional. For directional
zones, you define the Directional mode in the R-X plane. When assigning the impedance phasors in the R-X
plane, the direction is then additionally analyzed.
An impedance phasor is used to determine the direction of a short circuit. This is normally Z as for the distance
calculation. Different calculation methods are used depending on the quality of the measurands. Immediately
after a fault inception, the short-circuit voltage is influenced by the compensation procedures. Hence, the
voltage buffered before the occurrence of the short circuit is used. If neither a sufficient current voltage nor
a saved voltage is available for direction determination, forward is output. In practice, this only occurs if a
dead line is connected and this line is faulty, for example, switching when the grounding switch is activated.
Different methods are implemented for direction determination. Depending on the available input variables
when a short circuit occurs, the function selects the most appropriate method.
The available measurands and storage sizes when a short circuit occurs affect the method selection.
The theoretical steady-state direction-characteristic curve is shown in Figure 6-3. In practice, the position of
the direction-characteristic curve when using the saved voltage depends on the following factors:
•
The source impedance
•
The power transported on the line before the short circuit occurred
When determining direction with the current voltage, the position of the direction-characteristic curve with
double infeed and high fault resistance also depends on the source impedances and the power transferred
across the line before occurrence of the fault. For this reason, the direction-characteristic curve has a reserve
distance from the limits of the first quadrant in the R-X diagram. This reserve distance is defined with the

these parameters may only be changed in special cases. For long contact lines with high load, Siemens

Direction-Characteristic Curve
Zones with Combined Characteristic Curve
Description
The operate curve consists of a circle segment and multiple straight lines.
The radius Z (parameter: Z reach) of the circle segment defines the reach of the zone. The circle segment
is delimited by the directional straight lines β (parameter: Angle limitation Beta) and γ (parameter:
Angle limitation Gamma).
Additionally, a section α + R (parameter: Angle limitation Alpha and R reach) can be cut out of the
circle segment to make it easier to adapt the operate curve to the load impedance.
This makes it easier to differentiate between short circuit and load sections and improves the behavior of the
protection in case of arc faults and close-up short circuits with transformer saturation.
You define if the zone works forward, reverse, or non-directional.

To differentiate between short circuits and startup processes, you can select different criteria for short-circuit
detection in the zones with startup stage. The following criteria are available:
•
di/dt criterion
•
du/dt criterion
•
dPhi/dt criterion
With the parameter Short-circuit detection, you specify how the individual criteria are linked
together.
Parameter Value
Description
OR combination
If you select OR combination and an active short-circuit detection crite-
rion picks up, the Operate delay TS becomes effective.
AND combination
If you select AND combination, all active short-circuit detection criteria
must pick up so that the Operate delay TS becomes effective.
Parameters for the di/dt criterion
The following parameters are available for the di/dt criterion:
•
Default setting (_:103) di/dt criterion = check mark set
•
Default setting (_:104) Threshold value di/dt = 0.100 A
•
Default setting (_:105) Stab. factor di/dt = 0.0
If you set the check mark for the parameter di/dt criterion, you select this criterion for the short-circuit
detection. If the check mark is set, the parameters Threshold value di/dt and Stab. factor di/dt
become effective.
With the parameter Threshold value di/dt, you set the threshold value for the current gradient ∣ΔI∣.
Set the Threshold value di/dt as greater than the maximum load current for startup processes. If the
threshold value is exceeded, the di/dt criterion picks up and issues the indication Pickup di/dt.
With the parameter Stab. factor di/dt, you adapt the sensitivity of the di/dt pickup to the load current.
If you set the parameter to a value other than 0, the di/dt criterion is less sensitive for greater load
currents.
For more information about the di/dt criterion, refer to 6.2.9.2 Short-Circuit Detection with the di/dt
criterion and/or du/dt criterion.
Parameters for the du/dt criterion
The following parameters are available for the du/dt criterion:
•
Default setting (_:106) du/dt criterion = check mark not set
•
Default setting (_:107) Threshold value du/dt = 20 V
•
Default setting (_:108) Threshold value U< = 80 V
If you set the check mark for the parameter du/dt criterion, you select this criterion for short-circuit
detection. If the check mark is set, the parameters (_:107) Threshold value du/dt and (_:108)
Threshold value U< become effective.
If the measured voltage V is less than the value set in the parameter Threshold value U<, the du/dt
criterion becomes effective.
With the parameter Threshold value du/dt, you define the threshold value for the voltage change. If the
measured voltage falls below the Threshold value du/dt, the du/dt criterion picks up and issues
the indication Pickup du/dt.
For more information about the du/dt criterion, refer to6.2.9.2 Short-Circuit Detection with the di/dt
criterion and/or du/dt criterion.

If you set the check mark for the parameter dPhi/dt criterion, you select this criterion for short-circuit
detection. If the check mark is set, the parameter (_:110) Threshold value dPhi/dt becomes effec-
tive.
With the parameter Threshold value dPhi/dt, you define the threshold value for the impedance-angle
change.
For more information about the dPhi/dt criterion, refer to 6.2.9.1 Short-Circuit Detection with the
dPhi/dt criterion.

segment to make it easier to adapt the operate curve to the load impedance. Determine the setting values for
the specific application.
With the parameters Angle limitation Beta and Angle limitation Gamma, you define the angle of
the directional straight lines. The directional straight lines delimit the circle segment. Determine the setting
values for the specific application.
For more information about the operate curve, refer to 6.2.7.1 Description.
Parameter: Operate delay TS, Operate delay TL
•
Default setting (_:127) Operate delay TS = 0.20 s
•
Default setting (_:128) Operate delay TL = 0.80 s

Zones with Quadrilateral Characteristic Curve
Description
Tripping Zones with Characteristic Curves
The quadrilateral operate curve consists of multiple straight lines.
The straight line in parallel to the R axis defines the greatest reactance in the tripping area and therefore the
range of the respective tripping zone.
2 straight lines in parallel to the x-axis delimit the tripping area in the R direction.
The value R defines the inner limit and the value RA defines the outer limit outside the load cutout.
The tripping area is also limited by the directional straight lines. A section from the polygon is also cut out.
This excludes the load impedances section from the tripping area.
This makes it easier to differentiate between fault and load sections and improves the protection behavior in
case of arc faults and close-up faults with transformer saturation.
For each individual characteristic curve, the direction characteristic can be selected independently as
forward, reverse, or non-directional.

To differentiate between short circuits and startup processes, the zones with startup stage are equipped with
short-circuit detection. The following criteria are available:
•
di/dt criterion

With the parameter Short-circuit detection, you define how the individual criteria are linked together.
Parameter Value
Description
OR combination

If you set the check mark for the parameter di/dt criterion, you select this criterion for the short-circuit
detection. If the check mark is set, the parameters Threshold value di/dt and Stab. factor di/dt
become effective.
With the parameter Threshold value di/dt, you set the threshold value for the current gradient ∣ΔI∣. Set
the Threshold value di/dt to a value greater than the maximum load current for startup processes. If
the threshold value is exceeded, the di/dt criterion picks up and issues the indication Pickup di/dt.
With the parameter Stab. factor di/dt, you adapt the sensitivity of the di/dt pickup to the load current.
If you set the parameter to a value other than 0, the di/dt criterion is less sensitive for greater load
currents.

Default setting (_:107) Threshold value du/dt = 20 V
•
Default setting (_:108) Threshold value U< = 100 V
If you set the check mark for the parameter du/dt criterion, you select this criterion for short-circuit
detection. If the check mark is set, the parameters (_:107) Threshold value du/dt and (_:108)
Threshold value U< become effective.
If the measured voltage V is less than the value set in the parameter Threshold value U<, the du/dt
criterion becomes effective.

the directional straight lines. The directional straight lines delimit the circle segment. Determine the setting
values for the specific application.
For more information about the operate curve, refer to 6.2.7.1 Description.
Parameters for Defining the Quadrilateral Operate Curve
With the following parameters, you define the quadrilateral operate curve:
•

Short-Circuit Detection in Zones with Startup Stage
In the following operating states, the impedance comparison between load and short-circuit impedance alone
is no longer sufficient:
•
With highly loaded and long contact lines
•
When energizing with high loads
•
With load currents at the end of long supply zones
To distinguish between such operating states and short-circuits, the operate curves with startup stage have 2
grading times which can be set independently.
The long grading time must be set to a value that is higher than the duration of a startup process.
The short grading time is the time delay of the operate curve from the time-grading schedule.
To differentiate between short circuits and startup processes, the tripping zones with startup stage are
equipped with a short-circuit detection according to the following criteria:
•
di/dt criterion: Current change
•
du/dt criterion: Voltage change
•
dPhi/dt criterion: Impedance angle change 
With the parameter Short-circuit detection, you determine how the individual criteria are linked
together.
Short-Circuit Detection with the dPhi/dt criterion
The dPhi/dt criterion analyzes the change in impedance angle dφZ/dt and can be used to differentiate
between a load state and a short circuit.

Measured impedance angles at the times t1 and t2
The angle of the actual measured impedance is compared with the impedance angle 2 periods before. The
difference ΔφZ is analyzed and compared with the Threshold value dPhi/dt.
If the difference ΔφZ in the measurement interval exceeds the set Threshold value dPhi/dt, the
reduced Operate delay TS becomes effective.

The dPhi/dt criterion is not always sensitive enough. There is little difference in the impedance angle for
loads and short circuits in some power-system states, particularly close-in faults with arc resistance RL (refer to
Figure 6-7). In these cases, the impedance-angle change ΔφZ is too small, the dPhi/dt criterion does not pick
up, and the reduced Operate delay TS does not become effective.
Siemens recommends the OR operation with another criterion for better differentiation between loads and
short circuits. The possible criteria are the du/dt criterion and the di/dt criterion.
[dw_example_criterion_change-impedance-angle, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-7
Example of a Short Circuit with a Very Small Change in Impedance Angle When a Fault Occurs
Short-Circuit Detection with the di/dt criterion and/or du/dt criterion
The load impedances are of the same magnitude as the short-circuit impedances in the following cases:
•
With highly loaded and long overhead contact lines
•
When energizing with high loads
•
With load currents at the end of long supply zones
In these cases, impedance comparison to differentiate between load states and short circuits is no longer
sufficient.
The zones with start-up stage have additional criteria to differentiate more easily between load states and
short circuits.
The di/dt criterion and du/dt criterion evaluate the change in the current phasor |ΔI| and the voltage phasor
|ΔU| and are more sensitive than analysis of the impedance angle change ΔφZ.
[fo_short-circuit, 1, en_US]
The absolute values and the angles of the phasors I or V change in every short circuit (see a) and b) in the
following figure). This means that even if there is no effective current change (c), every short circuit involves a
phasor difference with the RMS value |ΔI| because the angle of the current phasor changes.

[dw_current-and-voltage_pointers_short-circuits, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-8
Current and Voltage Phasors in Short Circuits
The measuring principles of the di/dt criterion and du/dt criterion require the ratio of sampling frequency to
power frequency to remain constant at all times. This is the only way to ensure that the current and voltage
phasors can be compared using a defined time delay ΔT for an integral number of system periods.
If the calculated impedance Z is within the trip zone for the zone, the current gradient |ΔI| and the voltage
gradient |ΔV| are calculated. If the calculated gradients exceed the Threshold value di/dt and/or
(_:107) Threshold value du/dt parameters, the di/dt criterion and/or du/dt criterion are picked
up and the Pickup di/dt and/or Pickup du/dt indications are sent.
With the Stab. factor di/dt parameter, you can adapt the sensitivity of the di/dt criterion to the load
current. If you set the Stab. factor di/dt to a value other than 0, the sensitivity of the di/dt criterion
decreases for greater load currents. This means that a greater jump is required so that the di/dt criterion picks
up. The following figure shows how the current-jump threshold depends on the load current.
[dw_Load current-dependent charact_di-dt-stage, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-9
Load Current-Dependent Characteristic Curve of the di/dt Stage
Once detected, a Pickup di/dt and/or Pickup du/dt remains active as long as the measured impedance
is within the trip zone of the zone.
If the measured voltage V is less than the value set in the Threshold value U< parameter, the du/dt
criterion becomes effective.
If you set the Threshold value di/dt and/or Threshold value du/dt parameter to 0, the Pickup
di/dt and/or Pickup du/dt indication is generated permanently. In this case, the Operate delay TS is
permanently effective and the Operate delay TL is not in effect.
If you set the Threshold value di/dt and/or Threshold value du/dt parameter to ∞, only the
Operate delay TL is effective. If the setting is anything other than ∞, the di/dt function is active
and/ordu/dt function is active indications are sent.
If you do not need the start-up stages, instantiate the zones without start-up stage from the DIGSI 5 library.

logic of the distance protection.)

Zone Wrong Phase Coupling
Description
Logic of the Zone
[lo_ZFK, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-12
Logic of the Zone Wrong Phase Coupling (ZFC)
If the function Inrush-current detection is instantiated and a transformer inrush current is detected, you can
block the zone Wrong phase coupling (ZFC).
The zone Wrong phase coupling is optional and detects a 2-side, asynchronous infeed to the line section to
be protected. An example is the direct infeed from a 3-phase system, refer to Figure 6-14.
To make load distribution as symmetrical as possible, the individual line sections are fed from different phases
of the 3-phase system. If one infeed fails, a line section can also be supplied by a neighboring line section. For
this, the 2 line sections are interconnected with a busbar coupler. The busbar coupler must only be activated if
one of the 2 infeeds is deactivated. If both infeeds are active, activating the busbar coupler will cause a short
circuit, which must be disconnected as quickly as possible.
If the isolated area between the line sections is used by a vehicle with an activated circuit breaker, the arc
between the line sections causes a short circuit. The wrong phase coupling protection disconnects these short
circuits as fast as possible.

A normal distance zone cannot be used for this purpose. Unlike the other tripping zones for distance protec-
tion, there is no separate direction determination for the wrong phase coupling protection. A phase-shifted
value compared to the total loop impedance is measured due to the phase-angle difference between the 2
infeed voltages. The position of the additional zone Wrong phase coupling (ZFC) in the impedance plane
differs from the position of the other distance protection zones, refer to Figure 6-13.
The characteristic curve of the additional zone ZFC for wrong phase coupling protection is therefore defined as
follows:
[dw_trip-char_additional-ZFK, 1, en_US]

Where:
ZFC Zmax
Parameter: Zmax reach
ZFC Zmin
Parameter: Zmin reach

Parameter: Angle limitation Alpha

Parameter: Angle limitation Beta
For an example of how to determine the parameters, refer to 6.2.10.2 Application and Setting Notes.
Application and Setting Notes
Parameters for the Operate Curve of the Wrong Phase Coupling
With the following parameters, you define the operate curve for the wrong phase coupling:
•
Default setting Zmin reach = 20.000 Ω
•
Default setting Zmax reach = 30.000 Ω
•
Default setting Angle limitation Alpha = 100°
•
Default setting Angle limitation Beta = 160°
You must set the parameter Zmax reach to a value greater than the parameter Zmin reach and the
parameter Angle limitation Alpha to a value less than the parameter Angle limitation Beta.
Otherwise, the trip zone of the zone Wrong phase coupling cannot be displayed, refer to Figure 6-13. DIGSI 5
checks this and indicates an inconsistency if the parameterization is incorrect.
The following example describes the parameter determination.

Zone Switchover
A CFC logic allows the flexible switchover between the zones. In this way, you can adapt the distance
protection, for example, to different switching states of the contact line during operation.
The CFC logic uses the binary blocking signal of a zone and switches the parameters for the reach of these
zones over to an alternative value.
The following figure shows the logic of the zone switchover using zone Z1 as an example. The CFC logic
switches between the zones Z1 and Z1´ using 2 newly defined input indications.
[lo_CFC-logic-z1-z1stroke, 1, en_US]

Release of Tripping through AREC Zone
Description
The AREC zone works together with the function Automatic reclosing. In order for automatic reclosing to be
successful, short circuits on the entire line must be cleared at all line ends simultaneously as fast as possible. In
addition, with distance protection, the automatic reclosing zone can work as an overreaching distance zone,
for example, Zone Z1B, prior to automatic reclosing. After automatic reclosing, the AREC zone is typically
no longer in effect. For the relevant automatic reclosing cycle, short circuits up to the breakdown point
of the AREC zone can be switched off quickly (see following figure). Before automatic reclosing, limited non-
selectivity in favor of fast simultaneous disconnection is acceptable. Automatic reclosing will be performed
again. The normal stages of the distance protection (Z1, Z2, etc.) are typically operated independently of the
automatic reclosing function.

The automatic reclosing zone is an instance of controlled trip logic. With the parameter Operate with, you
select which distance zones will deliver the pickup information. If the selected distance zones have picked up
and a release from the automatic reclosing function is present, the automatic reclosing zone generates an
operate indication.
With the parameter Effected by AR cycle, you select the automatic reclosing cycle for the release of
tripping. If you wish to have a zone release in several automatic reclosing cycles, you must instantiate several
automatic reclosing zones and select a different automatic reclosing cycle for each zone.
If the function teleprotection with distance protection is present and in effect, you can block the automatic
reclosing zone with the parameter Blocked if 85-21 active. The AREC zone is active only if the
teleprotection with distance protection is not in effect, for example, with a communication failure. If the tele-
protection with distance protection is in effect, you achieve the 100 % selectivity through the teleprotection
with distance protection only if the comprehensive AREC zone is blocked.
Application and Setting Notes
Parameter: Operate with
•
Recommended setting value (_:105) Operate with = Z1B
With the parameter Operate with, you specify which distance zones will generate an operate indication
when pickup occurs while an automatic reclosing release is present. Typically, you use an overreaching
distance zone. This is called Z1B in the common application templates.
The selection texts for the parameter Operate with are identical to the texts you assign during zone
configuration in the Distance protection function.

Parameter: Operate delay
•
Recommended setting value (_:102) Operate delay = 0.00 s
With the parameter Operate delay, you set the operate delay of the automatic reclosing zone. Set the
parameter Operate delay for the specific application. If the distance zone selected with the parameter
Operate with picks up and all release conditions are met, the distance zone operates with the Operate
delay set here.
Parameter: Effected by AR cycle
•
Recommended setting value (_:101) Effected by AR cycle = 1
With the parameter Effected by AR cycle, you select the automatic reclosing cycle for the release of
tripping. If you wish to have a zone release in several automatic reclosing cycles, you must instantiate several
automatic reclosing zones and select a different automatic reclosing cycle for each zone.
Parameter: Blocked if 85-21 active
•
Recommended setting value (_:121) Blocked if 85-21 active = yes
With the parameter Blocked if 85-21 active, you block the automatic reclosing zone when the telepro-
tection scheme is in effect. If the function teleprotection with distance protection is present and in effect,
Siemens recommends blocking the automatic reclosing zone. To do this, set the parameter Blocked if
85-21 active = yes. If the parameter Blocked if 85-21 active = yes is set, the automatic reclosing
zone is only active if the teleprotection with distance protection is not in effect, for example, in the event of a
communication failure.

Output Logic of the Distance Protection
Mode of Operation
The output logic treats the pickup and trip signals of the distance zones separately, in one pickup logic and
one trip logic each. The pickup and trip logic generate the overlapping indications of the distance protection.
General Pickup
If the impedance is safely within the working area of a zone, the zone picks up and generates the group
indication Pickup.
The signal Pickup is indicated and can be further processed by internal and external additional functions, for
example, teleprotection scheme or automatic reclosing.
Output Logic for Zones without Startup Stage
The distance-zone pickups are combined and issued as indications.

High-Speed Distance Protection
Overview of Functions 
The function High-speed distance protection (HS distance protection):
•
Complements the function Distance protection contact line and trips faster when unambiguous and
high-current faults occur at close range
•
Works with individual sampled values
•
Is suitable for use at all voltage levels
•
Is suitable for use in 16.7-Hz, 25-Hz, 50-Hz, 60-Hz electrical power systems
i
i
NOTE
The tripping of the function HS distance protection cannot be delayed via a parameter. Therefore, time
grading of the zones is not possible.
Structure of the Function
You can insert the function HS distance protection in the function group Contact line. In auto-transformer
systems, you can create a 2nd instance for separate protection of the negative feeder.
The function HS distance protection consists of the following blocks:
•
General
•
Distance zones Z (High speed)
•
AREC zones
•
Output logic
The function HS distance protection does not contain any preconfigured factory-set zones.
A maximum of 4 zones Z (High speed) and 4 AREC zones can be operated simultaneously within the
function.
The following figure shows the basic structure of the function HS Distance protection.

SIPROTEC 5, Contact Line Protection, Manual
351
C53000-G5040-C028-2, Edition 07.2024


Mode of Operation
The function HS Distance protection measures current I and voltage V at the protection location. If the
measured current exceeds the parameterized Min. phase-current thresh, it is checked whether the
short-circuit direction corresponds to the parameterized direction of the stage and whether there is a short
circuit in the parameterized pickup range.
When the pickup conditions of a zone are fulfilled and the parameter Operate is activated, the zone trips.
Otherwise, only a pickup is indicated.
Auto-Transformer Systems
In auto-transformer systems, you can use the sum of the currents on the contact line (ICL) and the negative
feeder (INF) to calculate the impedance I = ICL + INF.
For more information about the phase selection, refer to Parameter: Phase selection of CL/nF, Page 237.
Zone Assignment Zone Z (High Speed)
The measurands current and voltage are used to determine whether there is a short circuit in the pickup range
of the stage.
AREC Zone
The AREC zone works together with the function Automatic reclosing.
i
i
NOTE
All zone types trip without delay.
i
i
NOTE
The function HS Distance protection requires a sufficiently large voltage before the fault inception. The
function HS Distance Protection only cooperates with the AREC if the voltage transformers are installed
on the busbar side. If the voltage transformers are installed on the line side and the circuit breaker is open,
the voltage on the line is 0. Then the function HS Distance Protection no longer picks up when the AREC
attempts to reclose. In this case, you must instantiate an instance of the function Distance protection
contact line in parallel.
Zone (Fast)
Description
With the parameters Z reach and Line angle, you define the pickup are of the zone Z (fast). The current
and voltage sampled values are used to check the pickup condition using a connectivity model. If the pickup
conditions are met, the zone trips.
Application and Setting Notes
Parameter: Min. phase-current thresh
•
Default setting (_:91:103) Min. phase-current thresh = 1.000 A
The parameter Min. phase-current thresh specifies the minimum phase current that must be exceeded
in case of a short circuit. If the actual current is lower than the setting value, the stages of the function are not
released.
The parameter Min. phase-current thresh is located in the block General.

Teleprotection with Distance Protection
Overview of Functions
To enable selective and non-delayed fault clearance of all faults, on the entire line length, information
exchange with the remote line end is applied. You can implement teleprotection using binary inputs and
outputs (transmission and reception contacts) or using a digital communication connection.
Structure of the Function
The Teleprotection schemes is used in the protection function group Line in combination with the function
Distance protection.
The functions shown in the following figure are available:
[dw_fkt-line_DIS_Mitnahme-Freigabe-Blockierverfahren, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-23
Structure/Embedding of the Function
Figure 6-24 shows the function control and the function blocks.
The transmission logic analyzes the pickup signals of the distance protection and generates the associated
transmission signal for transmission to the other line end.
The receive signal from the other line end is optionally coupled via a binary input or via the communication.
You can only use one receive block at a time.

The distance zone parameterized for the teleprotection scheme provides the pickup information. This pickup
information is combined with the reception information for the trip condition. If the trip condition is fulfilled,
the teleprotection scheme creates the operate indication.
A trip signal results from the simultaneous presence of a pickup and a release signal.

Function Blocks and Function Control
In the configuration of the device in DIGSI 5, you can instantiate and set parameters in the individual
teleprotection schemes independent of one another. If you need additional receive blocks, instantiate them
from the function library in DIGSI 5.

NOTE
During the instantiation of teleprotection schemes, keep in mind that you can instantiate only one telepro-
tection scheme for each Distance protection overhead contact line function. Only one teleprotection
scheme can work with the protection interface for each Distance protection overhead contact line
function.

In the following, the individual function blocks for the teleprotection scheme are described.
For more information, see 2.3 Function Control.
Receive Blocks
For the coupling of receive signals from the opposite end, the receive block types Rec. bin.sig. and Rec.
PI are available. The teleprotection scheme described below can be operated with the suitable receive blocks
if required.
A mixture between a line end connected through a protection interface and a binary connected line end is not
possible.

Logic Diagram of the Receive Block: Rec. bin.sig.
This receipt logic is used if the communication takes place via binary signals.
For teleprotection, the signal >Receive general is used.
The binary input >Receive failure affects the status indications of the function control, see Figure 6-24,
and causes the immediate tripping of the teleprotection scheme in case of pickup of the distance zone
connected to the scheme.

of the number of configured devices, only one function block Rec. PI is required at a time. The identity of
devices participating in the teleprotection scheme for the protection of the line configuration are set by using
the configuration of the protection interface, see 3.6.5.4 Configuration of the Protection Interface in DIGSI 5.

Permissive Underreach Transfer Trip
Description
[dwtpsmit-100611-01.tif, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-27
Function Block: Permissive Underreach Transfer Trip (85-21 Perm. underr.)
If a fault occurs within the underreaching zone - this is usually zone Z1 for the distance protection - a
transfer-trip signal is sent to the remote end. The receive signal leads to accelerated tripping in the device at
the remote end.
Sending Logic Permissive Underreach Transfer Trip
[lo_send_mitnahmeverf, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-28
Sending Logic for Permissive Underreach Transfer Trip
Sending takes place upon pickup in the distance zone selected as a send condition. You can use the
(_:5671:101) Send prolongation parameter to compensate the differences in the pickup times at
both line ends.
To form the send signal, you can use the pickup indications from all distance zones or the pickup indication
of the high-current fast tripping stage. The pickup indications of the Error coupling protection zone are not
suitable for this use case.
If the internal indication Echo confirmation from the trip logic is present, the sending logic also generates
the Send signal. If, with a present receive signal, an Operate with parameterized zone has picked up, the
Echo Confirmation raises. Even if the Send zone is set below the operate zone, a definite tripping is
possible for all line ends.

Trip Logic Permissive Underreach Transfer Trip
[lo_ausl_mitnahmeverf, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-29
Trip Logic for Permissive Underreach Transfer Trip
The distance protection provides the pickup information to the teleprotection scheme. The tripping for the
relevant zone is undertaken by that teleprotection scheme with which the distance protection works together.
If a receive signal is present, the zone set through the parameter Operate with will be released for tripping.
The trip can be delayed.
If the permissive underreach transfer trip is used to protect a line configuration with more than 2 ends, the
receive signals from all line ends are linked with OR.
A trip signal results from a simultaneous presence of the distance zone pickup, the release signal, and the time
sequence.
For applications with time-delayed tripping, a receive signal once received is retained until the distance zone
pickup drops out. This ensures that the release signal is still present if the expiration of the corresponding time
delay releases the tripping, and the transmission signal of the protection from the remote end is no longer
present.
Measures in the Event of Weak Infeed
If no or only a weak infeed is available at a line end, the protection does not pick up the phase information or
it does so incorrectly. No trip command can therefore be issued there. In SIPROTEC 5 devices tripping can also
be used together with the permissive underreach transfer trip in the event of weak infeed.
With the permissive underreach transfer trip, the protection trips parallel to the send signal with the under-
reaching distance zone at the line end with strong infeed. An echo from the line end with weak infeed is
therefore unnecessary as a release signal. However, the echo is advisable for manually testing the signal
connection between the protection devices.
The functions are described in more detail in 6.5.4 Tripping on Weak Infeed (TWI Function).
Application and Setting Notes for Permissive Underreach Transfer Trip, General
Setting the Process
The various permissive underreach transfer trip methods can be implemented by using both parameters Send

Recommended setting value (_:5671:101) Send prolongation = 0.05 s
With the parameter Send prolongation in the transmission logic, you can compare the differences in the
pickup times for both line ends. If SIPROTEC distance protection devices are used at all line ends, Siemens
recommends the setting value 0.05 s.
Parameter: Operate delay
•
Recommended setting value (_:5671:103) Operate delay = 0.00 s
Since the teleprotection scheme should lead to a fast and selective operate, Siemens recommends, for the
parameter Operate delay, the setting value 0.00 s.
Application and Setting Notes for the Permissive Underreach Transfer Trip via an Extended Measuring
Range (Distance Protection with Underreaching and Grading-Time Shortening)
A transfer-trip signal is transmitted to the remote end in the event of a fault within the underreaching zone. If
the fault is detected there within the overreaching zone, the receive signal leads to tripping.

Permissive Overreach Transfer Trip
Description
[dwtpsver-010612-01.tif, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-33
Function Block: Permissive Schemes (85-21 Perm. overr.)
If a fault occurs within the overreaching zone, for example zone Z1B for the distance protection, a send signal
is sent to the opposite end. In the distance protection device, the received signal leads to accelerated tripping
if the fault is also detected in the forward direction.

Sending Logic, Permissive Schemes
[lo_send_freigabeverf, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-34
Sending Logic for Permissive Schemes
Sending takes place upon pickup in the selected overreaching zone or optionally upon pickup in the forward
direction. The send signal can be extended by a parameterizable time (_:5701:101) Send prolonga-
tion if the protection has already issued a trip command. This allows for the release of the other line end
even if the short circuit there only leads to pickup after the short-circuit current at the opposite end has been
deactivated. With this, pickup differences between the cable ends and signal delays can be considered.
If needed, the transmission signal can be delayed with (_:5701:102) Send delay.
Trip Logic, Permissive Schemes
[lo_ausl_freigabeverf, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-35
Trip Logic for Permissive Schemes
The distance protection provides the pickup information to the teleprotection scheme. The tripping for the
relevant zone is undertaken by that teleprotection scheme with which the distance protection works together.
If a receive signal is present, the zone set through the parameter (_:5701:141) Operate with will be
released for tripping. The trip can be delayed.

A trip signal results from simultaneous presence of the distance zone activation, the release signal and the
time sequence. For applications with time-delayed tripping, a receipt signal once received is retained until the
distance zone pickup drops out. This ensures that the release signal is still present if the expiration of the
corresponding time delay releases the tripping, and the transmission signal of the protection from the remote
end is no longer present.
Measures in the Event of Weak Infeed
If no or only a weak infeed is available at a line end, the protection does not pick up the phase information
or it does so incorrectly. With this, neither a trip command nor a transmission signal can be sent. With the
permissive scheme, the line end cannot be tripped quickly with increased infeed because no release signal is
transferred from the end with the weak infeed.
The teleprotection schemes have special measures to enable a rapid trip at both line ends in such cases:
•
For the trip of the cable end with a strong infeed, the echo function can be made effective with a weak
infeed.
•
In order for the cable end to also be tripped with a weak infeed, the teleprotection scheme has a function
for trip with weak infeed.

Application and Setting Notes for Permissive Schemes, General
Setting the Process
The various permissive schemes can be implemented using the 2 parameters Send with and Operate
with (see Figure 6-34 and Figure 6-35). In addition, the selection of the receive block must be observed.
The following methods can be set:
Methods
Parameter: Send with
Parameter: Operate with
Signal permissive overreach
transfer trip
Overreaching zone, type Z1B
Overreaching zone, type Z1B
Directional permissive overreach
transfer trip
Pickup forward
Pickup forward
However, the selection texts are identical to the designations which you specify during the zone configuration
in the distance protection function. The selection text for the overreaching distance zone can therefore also be
different from Z1B.
Requirements during Distance Protection
When using any kind of permissive overreach transfer trip, make sure that the pickup of the distance protec-
tion in the backward direction reaches further than the overreaching zone of the opposite end (see the shaded
areas in the following figure on the right)! For this purpose, at least one of the distance-protection stages
must be set to backward or non-directional. In case of a fault occurring in Z1B of the protection in B
due to an incorrect setting in the shaded area (left in the figure), the distance protection would pick up. Since
an echo function is typically used, an undesired echo signal would be sent from protection A and protection B
would trip in an unselective way.

Distance-Protection Setting with Permissive Overreach Transfer Trip
Parameter: Send prolongation
•
Recommended setting value (_:5701:101) Send prolongation = 0.05 s
With the parameter Send prolongation in the transmission logic, you compensate the differences in the
pickup times for both line ends. If SIPROTEC distance protection devices are used at all line ends, Siemens
recommends the setting value 0.05 s.
Parameter: Send delay
•
Recommended setting value (_:5701:102) Send delay = 0.00 s
With the parameter Send delay, you set an additional tripping delay. Since the teleprotection scheme
should lead to a fast and selective tripping, Siemens recommends the setting value 0.00 s.
Parameter: Operate delay
•
Recommended setting value Operate delay = 0.00 s
With the parameter Operate delay, you set the tripping delay for 1-phase ground faults. Since the telepro-
tection scheme should lead to a fast and selective tripping, Siemens recommends the setting value 0.00 s.
Application and Setting Notes for the Permissive Overreach Transfer Trip Scheme (Distance Protection
with Overreaching and Release)
A send signal is sent to the remote end in the event of a fault in the overreaching zone. If the fault is also
detected there in the overreaching zone, the received signal leads to tripping.

the zone configuration in the distance protection function. The selection text for the overreaching distance
zone can therefore also be different from Z1B.
Parameter: Operate with

Application and Setting Notes for the Directional-Comparison Method
If the distance protection detects a fault in the line direction after an activation, it sends a release signal to the
remote end. If the opposite end receives the release signal and also recognizes an error in the cable direction,
the trip signal is created.

Function Block: Blocking Method (85-21 Blocking)
If the protection function recognizes a fault in the reverse direction, the blocking signal is sent to the opposite
end. If the protection device does not receive a blocking signal at the receiving line end, it generates the trip
signal after a short time delay.

Sending Logic Blocking Method
[lotpss_blockierverf_7ST86, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-40
Sending Logic for the Blocking Method
The blocking signal is generated on the activation of the distance protection in the reverse direction or
non-directionally. With the parameter (_:5731:101) Send prolongation, you can extend the blocking
signal. In this way, the opposite end can continue to be blocked, even if the fault has already been cleared
locally.
The blocking signal can also be sent immediately with jump detection (parameter (_:5731:102) Send
with jump). If the communication channel can react very quickly to the absence of the blocking signal,
you can use this jump signal, because the jump signal appears for every jump in the dimensions. If the
distance protection detects a fault in the forward direction, the blocking signal is stopped immediately and the
indication Stop is generated.

The distance protection provides the pickup information to the teleprotection scheme. The tripping for the
relevant zone is undertaken by that teleprotection scheme with which the distance protection works together.
If a receive signal is not present, the zone that is set through the parameter (_:5731:140) Operate with
will be released for tripping. The trip of the blocking method must be delayed due to possible differences in
the pickup times of the devices at both cable ends and because of the transmission time. The time delay is set
with the (_:5731:107) Release delay parameter.
Tripping can also be delayed using the parameter (_:5731:104) Operate delay.
The trip indication therefore results when there is a simultaneous presence of the distance zone activation, the
internal release signal and the time sequences.
No release of the trip occurs for an upcoming reception signal. The trip is blocked so that an activation in
the selected overreaching zone in the forward direction does not quickly shut down the external fault at the
remote end.
If a faulty power transmission path is reported via the binary input signal >Receive failure or via the
protection interface (signal Receive failure), the blocking method triggers immediately if one zone
assigned to the blocking method has picked up.
Measures in the Event of Weak Infeed
Owing to the process, there is no option in the blocking method for achieving a trip command release at weak
infeed by the opposite end. Rather, the advantage of the blocking method lies in the fact that tripping can
also occur rapidly at the infeed end without release, as no blocking signal can be formed from the non-feeding
end.
Application and Setting Notes for the Blocking Method
If the attenuation of the transmission signal at the fault location is so large that reception from the other line
end is not guaranteed, the blocking method is used.
If the protection function detects a fault in the backward direction, a blocking signal is generated. If the
other line end does not receive a blocking signal, the protection function trips in the event of a fault in the
overreaching zone. For this, the overreaching zone must be set to approximately 120 % of the line length.

Requirements during Distance Protection
When using the blocking method, observe that the pickup of the distance protection in the backward direction
must reach further than the overreach zone of the opposite end! For this purpose, at least one of the
distance-protection stages must be set to backward or non-directional. If a fault has been removed
in Z1B (after B) of the protection in A Figure 6-42, the distance protection in B must safely pick up in the
backward direction, in order to be able to send a blocking signal from protection B to protection in A.
Parameter: Send with jump
•
Recommended setting value (_:5731:102) Send with jump = Yes
With the parameter Send with jump, you set whether the blocking signal is sent without delay with the
jump detection. Siemens recommends using the fast blocking with jump and retaining the setting.
Parameter: Send prolongation
•
Recommended setting value (_:5731:101) Send prolongation = 0.05 s
With the parameter Send prolongation in the transmission logic, you compensate the differences in the
pickup and dropout times at both line ends. If SIPROTEC distance protection devices are used at all line ends,
Siemens recommends the setting value 0.05 s.
Parameter: Operate delay
•
Recommended setting value (_:5731:104) Operate delay = 0.00 s
Since the teleprotection scheme should lead to fast, selective tripping, Siemens recommends the setting value
0.00 s for the parameter Operate delay.
Parameter: Operate with
•
Recommended setting value (_:5731:140) Operate with = Z1B
With the parameter Operate with, you select the overreaching distance zone. The overreaching distance
zone is typically designated with Z1B. The selection texts are identical to the designations which you specify
during the zone configuration in the function Distance protection. The selection text for the overreaching
distance zone can therefore also be different from Z1B.
Parameter: Release delay
•
Recommended setting value (_:5731:107) Release delay = 0.020 s
With the parameter Release delay, you must set the release delay after a pickup. The trip of the blocking
method must be delayed due to possible differences in the pickup times of the devices at both cable ends and
because of the transmission time. Siemens recommends a setting value of 0.020 s.

Echo and Tripping in the Event of Weak Infeed
Overview of Functions
The Echo and tripping on weak infeed function is used to support the teleprotection schemes for distance
protection. Its use is only advisable, therefore, if you are using an appropriate teleprotection scheme.
In the following situations, a permissive overreach transfer trip (permissive overreach transfer trip scheme,
directional comparison) does not receive a release signal from the opposite line end:
•
Lines with single-side infeed, from the end of the line without infeed
•
From the line end with no or weak infeed or with an open circuit breaker
To accelerate tripping at both ends of the line in these situations, the Echo and tripping on weak infeed
function supports the Echo function.
To trip the end of the line with a strong infeed, the echo function can be implemented at the end of the line
with a weak infeed. In the absence of pickup at one end of the line, the echo function sends the received
signal back to the other end of the line as an echo, so that the trip command can be enabled there.
The Echo function can also be used to test the signal connection between the protection devices in the
context of permissive underreach transfer trip.
Structure of the Function
The Echo and tripping on weak infeed function is used in the function group Overhead contact line.
[dwstweek_7ST86, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-43
Structure/Embedding of the Function
The function Echo receives control signals from the teleprotection scheme for distance protection in the local
device, see the following figure.

Figure 6-44
Function Blocks
In the following, the individual function blocks are described.
Echo Function
In the absence of pickup at one end of the line, the echo function sends the received signal back to the other
end of the line as an echo, so that the trip command can be released there.

Echo Release
The release signal for the echo function in the teleprotection with distance protection is generated as follows:
[lo_freigabe_echo, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-45
Release Logic for the Echo Function with Distance Protection
Echo Logic
The echo logic is shown in the following figure.
[lo_echo, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-46
Logic Diagram for the Echo Function
The time delay (_:5821:102) Echo and operate delay takes effect when the echo release for
distance protection or ground-fault protection is set. This time delay is necessary if the pickup time for the
protection function at the weak line end is higher for a reverse fault or. The echo is transmitted at the end
of the time delay. If the circuit breaker at the line end without infeed is open, the echo time delay is not
necessary. The echo time delay is bypassed.
You can set the length of the echo pulse with the (_:5821:103) Echo pulse parameter.
The circuit-breaker switch position is signaled centrally by the process monitor.
A new echo cannot be transmitted for at least 50 ms (default setting of the parameter (_:5821:101) Echo
block time after Tx) once the echo pulse has been released, or for the duration of the send signal
associated with the release method currently in use. This prevents the echo from being repeated immediately
after the line is disconnected.

Tripping on Weak Infeed (TWI Function)
The TWI function is used to trip the circuit breaker at the end of the line with missing or weak infeed.
Logic for TWI
[lo_ausl_ase_7ST86, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-47
Release Logic for Tripping on Weak Infeed
If a weak infeed is detected and a receive signal from the teleprotection scheme for distance protection is
pending at the same time, TWI pickup is triggered. On TWI pickup, the trip logic of the associated method
triggers the trip signal.
TWI pickup and thus tripping can be delayed with the parameterizable time (_:5821:102) Echo and
operate delay. TWI pickup is also delayed by the release time (_:5821:103) Echo pulse. Synchroni-
zation between echo and TWI is achieved by both functions using the same time parameters.
Application and Setting Notes
To select the function Echo and tripping on weak infeed, use the function library with DIGSI.
The function is designed for cooperation with permissive underreach transfer trip and permissive overreach
transfer trips. The function must not be used in conjunction with blocking methods.
The function contains the following parameters:
Parameter: Weak infeed action
•
Recommended setting value (_:5821:104) Weak infeed action = only echo
The basic operating mode is set with the Weak infeed action parameter.
Parameter Value
Description

Parameter: Echo and operate delay
•
Recommended setting value (_:5821:102) Echo and operate delay = 0.04 s
The length of the echo time delay Echo and operate delay must be set so that different pickup response
times for distance-protection functions at all line ends cannot lead to an unwanted echo if faults occur outside
the system.
Parameter: Echo pulse
•
Recommended setting value (_:5821:103) Echo pulse = 0.05 s
The echo pulse duration Echo pulse can be adapted to transmission system conditions. It must be long
enough to ensure that the receive signal is detected even if the movement delays of the protection and
transmission devices at the ends of the line are not the same.
Parameter: Echo block time after Tx
•
Recommended setting value (_:5821:101) Echo block time after Tx= 0.05 s
To avoid an infinite echo between the ends of the line, a new echo cannot be sent for a period of
(_:5821:101) Echo block time after Tx after an echo signal has been sent. An infinite echo could
otherwise be triggered by interference coupling on the signal path, for example. The echo is also blocked for
this time once distance protection has been sent.
Parameter: CB closed on I=0
•
Default setting (_:5821:108) CB closed on I=0 = no
With the CB closed on I=0 parameter, you can influence the behavior of the logic for echo and tripping
in the event of weak infeed, when no circuit-breaker auxiliary contacts are routed and there is an operating
condition without current flow. In such operating conditions, the logic of the process monitor is unable to
detect the circuit-breaker position.
Parameter Value
Description
no
When you set the parameter CB closed on I=0 = no, the logics work to
detect the weak infeed into the Figure 6-46, as if the circuit breaker were
open.
In this case, no Weak infeed is detected and tripping at weak infeed is not
possible.
yes
When you set the parameter CB closed on I=0 = yes, the logics work
to detect the weak infeed into Figure 6-46 as if the circuit breaker were
closed.
In this case, the Weak infeed is detected and tripping at weak infeed is
possible.
If the circuit-breaker auxiliary contacts are routed, or current flow is detected, the circuit-breaker switch
position is detected based on this information.

Automatic Reclosing Function
Overview of Functions
The Automatic reclosing function (ANSI 79/RREC)
•
Automatically closes overhead contact lines after arc short-circuits or thermal overload
•
Can be controlled by integrated protection functions and by external protection devices
The automatic reclosing function (AREC) takes over automatic reclosing after a switch off via a short-circuit
protection. The following figure shows an example for the normal procedure with a two-time automatic
reclosing where the 2nd automatic reclosing attempt is successful.
[dw_2-AWE-mit-Wirkzeit-erfolgreich, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-48
Process Diagram of a Two-Time Reclosing with Action Time (2nd AREC Successful)
The integrated Automatic reclosing function allows up to 8 reclosing attempts. Each of the 8 disruption cycles
can work with different parameters.
The following figure shows an example for normal procedure with a two-time automatic reclosing after
disconnection via the internal overload protection. The 2nd automatic reclosing attempt is successful.
[dw_ablaufdiagramm_2-AWE-nach Abschalt-Thermo, 1, en_US]

The integrated Automatic reclosing function allows up to 8 reclosing attempts here as well. In contrast to
disconnection through the short-circuit protection, each of the 8 disruption cycles can work with its own
parameters that are the same for all cycles.

Structure of the Function
The Automatic reclosing function is used in function groups for circuit breakers. In a function group for circuit
breakers, one of the 2 types of functions illustrated in the following figures can be used. The Automatic
reclosing function has a central function control.
[dw_structure funkion-AWE, 1, en_US]

Structure/Embedding of the Function
Cyclic Automatic Reclosing Function
The Cyclic automatic reclosing function (Figure 6-51) allows up to 8 reclosing attempts. Here each disruption
cycle can work with different settings.
For the Cyclic automatic reclosing function, 1 cycle is preset. The preset cycle cannot be deleted. You can add
and delete additional cycles from the function library in DIGSI 5.

Structure/Embedding of the Cyclic Automatic Reclosing Function
Thermal Cyclic Automatic Reclosing Function (Thermal AREC)
When started via the Overload protection, thermal AREC in many aspects behaves the same as the cyclic
automatic reclosing function when started via the short-circuit protection. The Overload protection is not
multistage. For this reason, no distinction is made between the 1st reclosing cycle and the subsequent cycles.
The number of reclosing cycles is configurable. The specific parameters are the same for each cycle.

The Automatic reclosing function contains a central function control, see the following figure. You can find
detailed information on the function control in the chapter Function/Stage Control.

Figure 6-53
Function Control for the Automatic Reclosing Function
Cooperation of the Automatic Reclosing Function and Protection Functions
The Automatic reclosing function (AREC) can be influenced by the protection functions in the following way:
•
The AREC is started through pickup indications and operate indications by the selected protection func-
tions or protection stages.
•
Individual protection functions or protection stages can be configured so that their operate indication
blocks the AREC. If such a blocking exists, the AREC cannot be started. If the AREC is already started, the
blocking will lead to the cancellation of the AREC.

C53000-G5040-C028-2, Edition 07.2024


The automatic reclosing device can thus have an influence on the effects of the protection functions. The
following influence possibilities exist:
•
The AREC provides signals that can be used by protection functions for the blocking or release of special
stages or zones. An example is the release of overreaching zones with distance protection.
The configuration of the interaction between internal protection functions and automatic reclosing functions
can be set separately for each protection function, see Figure 6-54.
[lo_signale_Schutzfkt_AWE, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-54
Signals between Protection Functions and Automatic Reclosing Functions
The configuration occurs in a matrix view in DIGSI, see the following figure.

If a protection function or the stage of a protection function is connected with the AREC through the matrix,
this means that the respective pickup and operate indications are forwarded to the AREC.
The links can be conducted separately
•
For starting the automatic reclosing function and
•
For the blocking of the automatic reclosing function
The Automatic reclosing function also has the corresponding binary inputs and binary outputs through which
the external protection devices can be connected to the internal Automatic reclosing function.
If the function Thermal overload protection is configured to start automatic reclosing, the thermal cyclic
automatic reclosing function is started. All other protection functions configured to start the reclosing func-
tion start the cyclic automatic reclosing function.
Cyclic Automatic Reclosing Function
Operating Modes
Cyclic Automatic Reclosing Function (AREC)
When started by the short-circuit protection, the cyclic automatic reclosing function allows various automatic
reclosing cycles depending on the tripping time of the protection function(s). The automatic reclosing starts
with operate indications. Additionally, the general pickup is also considered.
With raising general pickup, the action times of the configured automatic reclosing cycles start. In this context
in this context, the general pickup is the group indication of all internal protection functions configured for
starting the automatic reclosing.
Through the time between the raising general pickup and the raising operate indication, the automatic
reclosing cycle to be started is determined. For multiple automatic reclosing cycles, the sequence of the
expiring automatic reclosing cycles is not fixed.
The following example in Figure 6-56 shows tripping that comes after expiration of the action time for cycle 1,
but before the expiration of the action times for cycle 2 and cycle 3. Cycle 2 now becomes active.
Within the following reclaim time, there is another pickup and tripping. Since cycle 2 is already complete,
these and all lower cycles cannot be processed anymore. The 2nd operate indication comes during the
running action time of cycle 3. This means cycle 3 now becomes active.
[dw_arce1d, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-56
AREC Signal Example
Through the action time, there is a direct influence on the dead-time behavior of the automatic reclosing
function. With close-in faults with short tripping times, other dead times can be realized than for remote faults
with a longer tripping time. With close-in faults with a short tripping time, an automatic reclosing is executed,
with remote faults with a longer tripping time, this does not occur. The operating mode allows for different
automatic reclosing cycles depending on the tripping time of the protection function(s).

Thermal Cyclic Automatic Reclosing Function
When the thermal automatic reclosing starts via the internal function Thermal overload protection, the
specific parameters of the automatic reclosing cycles are omitted. When the function Thermal overload
protection picks up, the function trips immediately. This means the action times are omitted for the thermal
automatic reclosing. The dead time is dynamic and is derived from the temperature profile of the contact line.
If a protection function differing from the internal function Thermal overload protection picks up or trips
during the dead time of the thermal cyclic automatic reclosing, the running automatic reclosing cycle is
stopped and the cyclic, non-thermal automatic reclosing function starts.
Structure of the Cyclic Automatic Reclosing Function
In Figure 6-57, the functional structure of the cyclic automatic reclosing function is illustrated as a block
diagram. The figure displays the important signals, coming from outside of the cyclic automatic reclosing
function, and the most important signals between the individual function blocks.
The automatic reclosing function works as a state machine. From the idle state AREC ready, the automatic
reclosing function gets through the tripping or pickup indications of the protection functions to the Dead
time state. After expiration of the dead time, the subsequent state is reached with the closing indication. The
reclaim time is also started together with the closing indication. If the reclaim time can expire without further
operate or pickup indications, the automatic reclosing is successful and the automatic reclosing function turns
back to idle state.
If the automatic reclosing function is restarted during the current reclaim time, there will be either a dynamic
blocking or other reclosing cycles will be executed. If other reclosing cycles are possible, there will be a dead
time start and the described process starts again.
After the end of a dynamic blocking, the automatic reclosing function switches back to idle state or goes
into the state Static Blocking if the blocking condition is permanently present. In the following sections, the
individual function blocks are described in detail.

Input Logic
The operate indications are used as starting signals. The action times start with the pickup indications. The
pickup indications are also required for monitoring during reclaim time. If the function Thermal overload
protection picks up, the function trips immediately. In the thermal automatic reclosing function the action
times are omitted.
Start
In the Start function block, the automatic reclosing function is switched from the idle state AREC ready to the
state Dead time, see Figure 6-58. The length of the starting signals is controlled with a supervision time.
Start-Signal Supervision Time
The start-signal supervision stops the automatic reclosing if the short circuit is not switched off within the
normal time; for example, in the case of a circuit-breaker failure.
With the first raising operate indication, the start-signal supervision time is initiated, parameter Start
signal supervis.time. The time is stopped as soon as no operate indication is active or if the circuit
breaker is recognized as being no longer closed..
The automatic reclosing function is blocked if there is an expiration of the start-signal supervision time
through a long operate indication. The blocking lasts until the operate indication dropout, extended by a
further 3.0 s.
Transition to the Dead-Time State
The transition of the automatic reclosing function to the dead-time state occurs for:
•
Clearing operate indications if none of the signal inputs for operate indications are active
•
or if the circuit breaker can no longer be recognized as closed
•
and the start-signal supervision time is not expired
Additionally, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
•
The circuit breaker signalizes the readiness for automatic reclosing typically through a binary input.
If the circuit breaker is not ready, the automatic reclosing function can be statically blocked. In this
situation, the automatic closing function is not in idle state automatic closing function ready. The
control of the circuit-breaker readiness is optional and can be turned off through settings, see also
6.6.4.9 Circuit-Breaker Readiness and Circuit-Breaker Position and 6.6.4.10 Blockings.
•
The circuit breaker must be closed before the trip command. This condition is not considered if the
circuit-breaker auxiliary contacts are not connected to the protection device.
You can delay the transition to the dead time state through the binary input >Dead time start delay.
As long the corresponding binary signal is present, the dead time of the automatic reclosing function will
not be started. The maximum duration of this binary signal is monitored through a time stage that can be
set, parameter Max. dead-time delay. Upon expiration of this time stage, that is, if the binary signal is
present longer than permitted, the automatic reclosing function will be blocked until the dropout of the binary
signal, additionally extended by another 0.5 s, see also 6.6.4.10 Blockings.

Logic for Function Block Start
Cycle Control
The cycle control checks the readiness for each automatic reclosing cycle and controls the process of the
action time(s). In Figure 6-59, the cycle control is illustrated.
Cycle Availability
The cycle availability is influenced through the parameterization of the dead time and through a binary input.
If the parameter Dead time is set to oo, the respective automatic reclosing cycle is blocked completely. With
the binary input >Block 79 cycle, you can block the associated automatic reclosing cycle.
Action Time
If the automatic reclosing function is in the idle state automatic reclosing function ready, an incoming
general pickup will affect the start of the action time. This applies for the reclosing function cycles that are
released through the parameter Start from idle state allow. and not blocked.
During one of the started action times, the corresponding reclosing cycle is blocked and the reclosing cycle is
assigned the next highest cycle number, whose action time is running and is not blocked.
With raising trip commands, the action times are stopped and reset. The process state of the action times
existing at this moment determines the automatic reclosing cycle that should be started.
If all initiated action times expire without capturing a tripping, automatic reclosing is blocked for 3 s with the
indication Blk.by action time exp. A new start of the reclosing function is only possible if the general
pickup is no longer active.

Omitted for thermal AREC
In the case of the thermal automatic reclosing function, the pickup and tripping overlap. This means the
action times are omitted. The selection of the cycle to be started does not depend on the tripping time and
cycle-specific releases and blockings are omitted. When the thermal overload protection is tripped, the 1st
cycle is started first and then the next highest cycle continues after unsuccessful automatic reclosing when
tripped again within the reclaim time.
Stage Release
The function block Stage release creates output indications for the release or switching over of special stages
for protection functions (stage release in the 1st cycle or stage release in the n. cycle). Examples of this are the
release of overreaching zones with distance protection.
Figure 6-60 shows the stage release for the 1st automatic reclosing cycle. With available automatic reclosing
functions, the tripping stage release typically occurs up to the expiration of the dead time.

Closing Indication and Close Command
After the expiration of the dead time, the Automatic reclosing function is in the closing state.
The closing state can depend on the following influences, see Figure 6-63:
•
Through a synchrocheck
•
Through the readiness of the circuit breaker signaled through the binary input
•
Through a binary input for delaying the close command (>Delay close cmd.)
The Close cmd. indication is a requirement to issue the actual close command to the circuit breaker.
The mentioned criteria must not be fulfilled directly after expiration of the dead time. If a dead-time prolonga-
tion is set, the mentioned criteria will be checked during the prolongation time. With the release of the closing
indication, the Automatic reclosing function switches to the reclaim time state.

For each of the configured automatic reclosing cycles, you can set whether a circuit-breaker readiness test is
to be carried out directly before closing (parameter CB ready check bef.close, Figure 6-64). Independ-
ently of this, a circuit-breaker readiness test can be carried out before the start of the 1st automatic reclosing

Synchrocheck
For each of the configured automatic reclosing cycles, you can set whether a synchrocheck is to be carried
out, and which functionality is to be used here; see Figure 6-65. You can only use the internal synchrocheck if
the device is connected to a voltage transformer.
The measuring request for the synchrocheck is placed if the optional test of the circuit-breaker readiness was
positive. The measuring request for the synchrocheck exists until the synchrocheck assigns the allowance for
the closure. If the allowance is not given within the set maximum dead time extension, the closure will be
cancelled through the blocking of the Automatic reclosing function. The minimum duration of the measuring
request is 50 ms.
Automatic reclosing does not take place in the event of missing or failed synchronous voltage.
For the thermal automatic reclosing function this configuration parameter is set commonly for all cycles.

In addition to the closing indication, additional indications will be created that describe the type of closure.
These include:
•
Close command after tripping in the 1st cycle (CloseCmd aft. 1st cycle
•
Close command after tripping starting with the 2nd cycle (CloseCmd >=2nd.cyc)
These indications are omitted for thermal automatic reclosing function.
Reclaim Time
With the assignment of the close command, the automatic reclosing function goes into the reclaim time
state. During this time, it is decided if the current reclosing cycle was successful or not.
•
If during the reclaim time no further tripping occurs, the currently running automatic reclosing cycle, and
thus the entire automatic reclosing, was successful.
•
If during the reclaim time another tripping occurred, the currently running automatic reclosing cycle
was not successful. If other AREC cycles are permitted, one of these cycles will be used to continue
the process. If, in contrast, the currently executed cycle was the last permissible cycle, the automatic
reclosing process will end and be reported as unsuccessful.
In both cases, the automatic reclosing function switches back to the idle state automatic reclosing function
ready.
Short Circuits during Running Reclaim Time
A trip command that occurs during a reclaim time leads to a cancellation of the reclaim time. If further AREC
cycles are allowed, the regulation of the next cycle , as described below, see Figure 6-66.

indication, there will be no further reclosing.

Circuit-Breaker Readiness and Circuit-Breaker Position
The Automatic reclosing function needs circuit-breaker readiness for the following purposes, see Figure 6-67:
•
Recognition of the circuit-breaker readiness before starting:
In idle state of the Automatic reclosing function, an unavailable circuit breaker leads to the blocking of
the Automatic reclosing function. This monitoring is optional and must be switched off through settings
if the readiness signal is not available for the protection device.
•
Analysis of the circuit-breaker readiness directly before the close command:
For each of the configured automatic reclosing cycles, it can be set whether the circuit-breaker readiness
is a requirement for the assignment of the close command. This monitoring is also optional.
[lo_lsbere, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-67
Cyclic Automatic Reclosing: Logic for the Circuit-Breaker Readiness
With the thermal automatic reclosing function the setting value of the parameter CB ready check
bef.close applies to all cycles.
The Automatic reclosing function uses the circuit-breaker position information for the following purposes:
•
Detection of a non-closed circuit breaker before the start:
When the Automatic reclosing function is in idle state, a not closed circuit breaker leads to the blocking
of the Automatic reclosing function; see also 6.6.4.10 Blockings. This monitoring is not needed if the
auxiliary-contact signals are unavailable.
•
Detection of the reaction of the circuit breaker after a trip command:
The Automatic reclosing function dead time is started immediately with the opening of the circuit
breaker if the circuit-breaker auxiliary contacts are connected. Here a decision is made regarding the
opening of the circuit breaker if the circuit breaker is no longer closed.
Blockings
The Automatic reclosing function differentiates between 2 types of blockings, see Figure 6-68:

indication Inactive.

Recognition due to the following causes:
•
Automatic reclosing cycle is not set.
•
Automatic reclosing cycles are set, but all are blocked, for
example, via binary input.
•
No device-internal function and binary input have been
configured for starting the automatic reclosing function.
Inactive
Dynamic Blocking
The automatic reclosing function is dynamically blocked if a blocking condition occurs while an auto-
matic reclosing function is already running. The dynamic blocking is signalized with the indication Not
ready.
After the occurrence of a dynamic blocking, it is checked at intervals of 3.0 s to see if the blocking can
be removed. If the blocking condition remains or if a different blocking condition occurs in the meantime,
the blocking will remain. If, in contrast, the cause of the blocking disappears, the dynamic blocking will be
removed if no general pickup or no tripping configured for the automatic reclosing function start is available.
A separate indication for logging exists for each individual blocking cause.
The following conditions lead to the dynamic blocking:
Condition
Indication
If a protection function configured to block the automatic
reclosing function operates or the automatic reclosing function is
blocked by the Synchrocheck function.
Not ready

If the synchrocheck is set and the synchronism conditions after
the expiration of the maximum dead-time extension are not
fulfilled before the assignment of the close command.

Starting the Automatic Reclosing Function
The configuration of the interaction between internal protection functions and the automatic reclosing func-
tion can be set separately for each protection function. The configuration occurs in a matrix view in DIGSI. The
Automatic reclosing function also has the corresponding binary inputs and binary outputs through which the
external protection devices can be connected to the internal Automatic reclosing function.

Parameter Value
Description
yes
The automatic reclosing function checks the readiness of the circuit breaker
for a switching cycle, consisting of a tripping-reclosing-switching.
If the circuit breaker is ready - signaled through a binary input - the startup
of the automatic reclosing function can occur. If the circuit breaker is not
ready, the automatic reclosing function reports the static blocking.
Siemens recommends using this setting.
Note: The presetting of this parameter does not correspond with the recom-
mended setting for operation. The automatic reclosing function would
otherwise be blocked with a non-available circuit breaker-ready-signal. Set
the parameter as recommended.
no
The readiness of the circuit breaker is not checked before starting the auto-
matic reclosing function. The test also does not occur if the readiness signal
from the circuit breaker is connected to a binary input on the device.
Parameter: Block. time aft. man.close
•
Default setting (_:6601:104) Block. time aft. man.close = 1.00 s
With the parameter Block. time aft. man.close, the time is determined for which the automatic
reclosing should be blocked after a manual connection.
Set the time so that the circuit breaker can be safely switched on and off during connection to a short circuit
without the automatic reclosing function being automatically closed.
Parameter: CB ready superv. time
The setting of this parameter is only important if the cycle-specific parameter CB ready check bef.close
is set to yes. Otherwise, this parameter has no effect.
•
Default setting (_:6601:106) CB ready superv. time = 3.00 s
With the parameter CB ready superv. time, you can determine after which maximum time after the
tripping the circuit breaker must be ready for the reclosing function.
Set the time somewhat longer than the regeneration time of the circuit breaker after an OFF-ON-OFF cycle.
For detailed information about the function, refer to 6.6.4.9 Circuit-Breaker Readiness and Circuit-Breaker
Position and 6.6.4.7 Closing Indication and Close Command.
Parameter: Max. dead-time delay
•
Default setting (_:6601:110) Max. dead-time delay = 0.5 s
With the parameter Max. dead-time delay, you determine at which time the starting of the dead time
may be delayed before the automatic reclosing function is dynamically blocked.
The delay of the start of the dead time is possible with the binary input >Dead time start delay.
For detailed information about the functionality, refer to 6.6.4.3 Start.
Parameter: Max. dead-time extension
•
Default setting (_:6601:111) Max. dead-time extension = 1.2 s
With the parameter Max. dead-time extension, you determine the time by which the dead time may be
extended before the automatic reclosing function is dynamically blocked.
With the setting oo (invalid), the extension is unlimited.
An extension of the dead time can be required under the following conditions:
•
Waiting for the readiness of the circuit breaker
•
Inquiry of a synchronous test
Remember that longer dead times after disconnection are only permissible if no stability problems occur or if a
synchronous test occurs before the reclosing.

Parameter: Send delay f. remot. close
•
Default setting (_:6601:112) Send delay f. remot. close = oo (invalid)
With the parameter Send delay f. remot. close, you define when the close command is sent via the
protection interface for inter-closing after automatic reclosing.
For detailed information about the functionality, refer to 6.6.4.7 Closing Indication and Close Command.
Parameter: Reclai. time aft.succ.cyc.
•
Default setting (_:21871:103) Reclai. time aft.succ.cyc. = 3.00 s
With the parameter Reclai. time aft.succ.cyc., you define the time in which it is decided whether
the current automatic reclosing cycle was successful or not. For detailed information about the function of the
reclaim time, refer to 6.6.4.8 Reclaim Time.
The presetting for the reclaim time can be frequently maintained. In regions where thunderstorms and storms
often occur, a shorter reclaim time makes sense in order to minimize the danger of the final disconnection due
to sequential lightning strikes or cable spark over.
Select a long reclaim time if there is no possibility for circuit-breaker supervision with multiple automatic
reclosing, for example, due to missing auxiliary contacts or lacking circuit-breaker-ready-information. In this
case, the reclaim time must be longer than the recovery time of the circuit breaker.
Parameter: Start signal supervis.time
•
Default setting (_:21871:105) Start signal supervis.time = 0.50 s
With the parameter Start signal supervis.time, you set the maximum time after which a circuit
breaker must be opened after a trip command. If the time expires, a failure of the circuit breaker is assumed
and the automatic reclosing function is dynamically blocked.
For detailed information about the function of the start supervision time, refer to 6.6.4.3 Start.
Parameter: 50 HS: max. 1 AR cycle
•
Default setting (_:21871:102) 50 HS: max. 1 AR cycle = yes
With the parameter 50 HS: max. 1 AR cycle, you define whether only 1 cycle or the configured
max. number of automatic reclosing cycles are released when automatic reclosing starts via instantaneous
high-current tripping.
Application and Setting Notes for 1 Cycle of the Cyclic Automatic Reclosing Function
For the function Cyclic automatic reclosing, 1 cycle is preset. The preset cycle cannot be deleted. You can
add and delete more cycles from the function library in DIGSI 5.
The thermal automatic reclosing has no cycle-specific parameters. The setting values apply to all cycles of the
thermal automatic reclosing.
Parameter: Start from idle state allow.
•
Default setting (_:6571:102) Start from idle state allow. = yes
With the parameter Start from idle state allow., you can determine whether the action time of this
automatic reclosing cycle is started, if the automatic reclosing function is in idle state during with incoming
general pickup. Set the parameter always to yes, if the automatic reclosing function is configured for only 1
cycle. If you set the parameter Start from idle state allow. = no, the cycle is only released as the
next cycle (> 1st cycle), for example, to prevent a long break in automatic reclosing in the first cycle.
Parameter: Action time

With the parameter Action time, you determine, within which time frame the trip command must appear,
in order to start the automatic reclosing function. If the trip command occurs only after the action time has
expired, automatic reclosing does not occur within the active automatic reclosing cycle.
Parameter: Dead time
•
Default setting (_:6571:108) Dead time = 1.00 s
With the parameter Dead time, you determine the dead time after which the automatic reclosing function
will be executed. After the circuit breaker trips, the system stability is priority. Since the switched off line
cannot develop synchronizing forces, only a short dead time is permitted in most cases. The usual duration is
0.3 s to 0.6 s. A longer period can be tolerated if a synchrocheck is carried out prior to reclosing. Even in radial
systems longer dead times are possible.
Parameter: CB ready check bef.close
•
Default setting (_:6571:111) CB ready check bef.close = no
With the parameter CB ready check bef.close, you can determine if after the expiration of the dead
time (meaning, directly prior to assigning the close command) readiness of the circuit breaker should be
queried.
Parameter Value
Description
no
With the setting no, the automatic reclosing function does not check again
the readiness of the circuit breaker prior to assigning the close demand.
Siemens recommends this setting, if it is sufficient to check the readiness
of the circuit breaker for the entire switching cycle once before the start
of a reclosing function, consisting of tripping-reclosing-tripping. The setting
for checking the readiness of the circuit breaker prior to the start of the
automatic reclosing function is done using the parameter (_:6601:102)
CB ready check bef. start.
yes
With the setting yes, the dead time can be extended if after the expira-
tion of the dead time the circuit breaker is not ready for the next ON-OFF
cycle. The maximum delay of the dead time can be set with the parameter
(_:6601:111) Max. dead-time extension.
Siemens recommends this setting, if it can be assumed that the circuit
breaker becomes available to switch on the reclosing function only after an
additional waiting period.
For detailed information on this function, refer to 6.6.4.9 Circuit-Breaker Readiness and Circuit-Breaker Posi-
tion and 6.6.4.7 Closing Indication and Close Command.
Parameter: Synchrocheck before recl.

Method of Measurement, Threshold Value
This stage works with unfiltered sampled values. The set Threshold is multiplied by √2 and compared with
the present sampled values. Thus, very short tripping times are possible.
If there is no sampled value greater than the dropout threshold during 1 system cycle, the pickup drops out.
The dropout threshold is the set Threshold, multiplied by the parameterized Dropout ratio.

Method of Measurement, Threshold Value
This stage works with unfiltered sampled values. The set Threshold is multiplied by √2 and compared with
the present sampled values. Thus, very short operate times are possible.
Delta variables for current and voltage are created simultaneously. The starter monitors the current curve for
sudden changes. As soon as a possible fault is detected, the direction determination starts. If the direction
result equals the set direction and the set Threshold is exceeded, the stage picks up.
If there is no sampled value greater than the dropout threshold during one system cycle, the pickup drops out.
The dropout threshold is the set Threshold, multiplied by the parameterized Dropout ratio.
Blocking the Stage
The following blockings reset the picked-up stage completely:
•
Via the binary input signal >Block stage from an external or internal source
Blocking the Stage in Case of Measuring-Voltage Failure
The stage can be blocked in case of a measuring-voltage failure. In case of blocking, the picked-up stage is
reset. The following blocking options are available for the stage:
•
From inside upon pickup of the function Measuring-voltage failure detection
•
From an external source via the binary input signal >open of the function block VT miniatureCB,
which leads to the tripping of the voltage-transformer circuit breaker.

Direction Determination
The directional high-current stage works with the following algorithms for direction determination:
•
A booster that determines the direction in unambiguous cases using a single sampled-value pair of
current and voltage.
•
A process in parallel, based on calculating the integral from values calculated from current and voltage.
The booster takes precedence here and blocks any direction result from the integral process calculated later
on.
The direction determination for the directional high-current stage is based on the superposition principle and
uses only delta variables. For this, the difference between the actual sampled values and the sampled values
before a system period is calculated.
The advantage of the procedure is that the delta variables only reflect the short circuit and the power flow has
no effect on the result. The current and voltage phasors are not calculated in this procedure. This makes the
direction determination and direction decision much faster than in the classic procedure.
Application and Setting Notes
Parameter: Threshold, Operate delay
•
Recommended setting value (_:31:3) Threshold = 10.0 A for Irated = 1 A or 50.0 A for Irated = 5 A
•

negative-feeder current.
With the parameter Operate delay, you delay the instantaneous high-current tripping. The time delay is
started when the stage 67 high-speed picks up. Set the parameter for the specific application.
If you maintain the default setting of 0.000 s, the stage 67 high-speed trips without delay.
Set the parameters Threshold and Operate delay for the specific application.
Parameter: Dropout ratio
•
Recommended setting value (_:31:4) Dropout ratio = 0.90
The default setting of 0.90 is sufficient for many applications. To obtain high-precision measurements, the
Dropout ratio can be reduced. If you expect highly fluctuating measurands at the pickup threshold, you
can increase the setting value of the parameter Dropout ratio. This avoids chattering of the tripping stage.
Parameter: Directional mode
•
Default setting (_:31:8) Directional mode = forward
With the parameter Directional mode, you define whether the zone works forward, reverse, or in both
directions. Set the parameter Directional mode for the specific application.
Parameter: Booster
•
Default setting (_:31:9) Booster = yes
With the parameter Booster, you can speed up the tripping of the high-current stage 67 high-speed. Set the
parameter Booster for the specific application.
If you set the parameter Booster = yes, the stage trips after a single measurement cycle. The direction
decision is not additionally stabilized for directional tripping with Booster. The operate time is comparable
with the non-directional high-current stage.

Overcurrent Protection
Overview of Functions
The Overcurrent protection function (ANSI 50/51):
•
Detects short circuits in electrical equipment
•
Can be used as backup or emergency overcurrent protection in addition to the main protection
Structure of the Function
The Overcurrent protection function is used in protection function groups.
The function is preconfigured by the manufacturer with 2 Definite-time overcurrent protection stages and 1
Inverse-time overcurrent protection stage.
In the function type Overcurrent protection, the following stages can be operated simultaneously:
•
Maximum of 4 stages Definite-time overcurrent protection
•
Maximum of 2 stages Inverse-time overcurrent protection
The function is configured in such a way that the emergency mode can work in all overcurrent protection
stages.
Stages that are not preconfigured are shown in gray in the following figure. Apart from the tripping-delay
characteristic, the stages are identical in structure.
The group-indication output logic generates the following group indications of the protection function by the
logical OR of the stage-selective indications:

Emergency mode
With the parameter Emergency mode, you define whether the stage operates as overcurrent protection in
emergency mode or as backup overcurrent protection. With the setting Emergency mode = caused by
main prot., the overcurrent protection starts automatically in emergency mode when the main protection
fails. This occurs, for example, for distance protection when there is a short circuit or an outage on the
voltage transformer secondary side. This means that the emergency mode replaces the main protection as
short-circuit protection. With the corresponding setting (Emergency mode = caused by binary input),
emergency mode can also be activated externally.
If the overcurrent protection is set as backup overcurrent protection (parameter Emergency mode = no), it
operates independently of the main protection and thus in parallel. The backup overcurrent protection can
also serve as sole short-circuit protection when, for example, no voltage transformers are available for an
initial startup.

Method of measurement
With the parameter Method of measurement, you define whether the stage works with the fundamental
comp. or with the calculated RMS value.
•
Measurement of the fundamental component:
This method of measurement processes the sampled current values and filters out the fundamental
component numerically.
•
Measurement of the RMS value:
This method of measurement determines the current amplitude from the sampled values according to
the defining equation of the RMS value. Harmonics are included in the analysis.
Pickup Delay
If the current exceeds the threshold value, the pickup delay starts. If the threshold is exceeded during the
pickup delay time, the pickup signal is generated.
Dropout delay
If the value falls below the dropout threshold, the pickup dropout can be delayed. The pickup is maintained for
the specified time. The time delay of the tripping continues to run. If the time delay expires while the pickup is
still maintained, the stage trips.
Blocking the Stage
The following blockings reset the picked-up stage completely:
•
Via the binary input signal >Block stage from an external or internal source
•
Via the functionality of the dynamic settings
Blocking the Time Delay
You can use the binary input signal >Block delay & op. to prevent the start of the time delay and thus
also the operate signal. A running time delay is reset. The pickup is indicated and a fault record is logged.
Blocking of the Tripping Delay and the Trip Signal via the Device-Internal Inrush-Current Detection Function
In conjunction with the function Inrush-current detection, the tripping delay and the trip signal can be
blocked.
Application and Setting Notes
Parameter: Emergency mode
•
Default setting (_:2311:101) Emergency mode = no
The Emergency mode parameter is set for all stages. The setting applies equally to all stages within the
function.
Parameter Value
Description
no
Overcurrent protection does not operate in emergency mode. It is always
active in parallel to main protection.
caused by main prot.
Overcurrent protection operates in emergency mode. If main protection can
no longer operate, overcurrent protection automatically starts to operate. If
there is a measuring-voltage failure, distance protection no longer works as
main protection.
caused by binary input
Overcurrent protection operates in emergency mode. Activation is not
performed automatically by internal main protection, but via a binary input
signal, for example, by an external main protection.

Parameter: Method of measurement
•
Recommended setting value (_:661:8) Method of measurement = fundamental comp.
With the Method of measurement parameter, you define whether the stage uses the fundamental
comp. (standard method) or the calculated RMS value.
Parameter Value
Description
fundamental comp.
Select this method of measurement if harmonics or transient current peaks
are to be suppressed.
Siemens recommends using this method as the standard method.
RMS value
Select this method of measurement if you want the stage to take harmonics
into account (for example, at capacitor banks). Consider that aperiodic DC
components present in the secondary circuit are measured and can cause
an overfunction.
For this method of measurement, do not set the threshold value of the
stage to less than 0.1 Irated,sec. If currents from more than one measuring
point are added up in the current interface of a function group, the setting
value should not be set lower than 0.1 Irated,sec multiplied by the number of
added currents.
Parameter: Threshold, Operate delay
•
Default setting (_:661:3) Threshold = 1.500 A (for the 1st stage)
•
Default setting (_:661:6) Operate delay = 0.30 s (for the 1st stage)
Set the Threshold and Operate delay parameters for the specific application.
The following information applies for a 2-stage characteristic curve (1st stage = definite-time overcurrent
protection and 2nd stage = high-current stage).
1st Stage (Overcurrent Protection Stage):
The setting depends on the maximum occurring operating current. Pickup by overload must be excluded
since overcurrent protection operates with short tripping times as short-circuit protection and not as overload
protection. Set the Threshold parameter for lines to approx. 10 % over the maximum expected load.
2nd Stage (High-Current Stage):
This tripping stage can also be used for current grading. Set the Threshold parameter to ensure that the
stage does not pick up in case of a short circuit at the end of the line. Set the Operate delay parameter to 0
or a low value. Siemens recommends that the threshold values be determined by means of a system analysis.
Parameter: Pickup delay
•
Default setting (_:661:102) Pickup delay = 0.00 s
For special applications, it is desirable that, if the current threshold is briefly exceeded, this does not lead to
the pickup of the stage and the start of fault logging or recording. If this stage is used as a thermal overload
function, that is considered a special application.
With the Pickup delay parameter, you can define a time interval during which a pickup is not triggered if
the current threshold is exceeded.
For all short-circuit protection applications, this value is 0.00 s as default.
Parameter: Dropout delay
•
Default setting (_:661:101) Dropout delay = 0.00 s
Siemens recommends that the default setting 0 be used because a protection stage has to drop out as quickly
as possible.
With the Dropout delay ≠ 0 parameter, you can achieve a uniform dropout behavior if you use it together
with electromechanical relays. This is required for time grading. The dropout time of the electromechanical

relay must be known for this purpose. Subtract the dropout time of your own device (see Technical Data) and
set the result.
Parameter: Dropout ratio
•
Default setting (_:661:4) Dropout ratio = 0.95
The recommended setting value of 0.95 is appropriate for most applications.
To achieve high-precision measurements, the setting value of the Dropout ratio parameter can be
reduced, for example to 0.98. If you expect highly fluctuating measured quantities at the pickup threshold,
you can increase the setting value of the Dropout ratio parameter. This prevents the tripping stage from
chattering.

Logic Diagram of the Inverse-Time Overcurrent Protection
Emergency mode
You use the Emergency mode parameter to define whether the stage operates as emergency overcurrent
protection or as backup overcurrent protection. With the setting Emergency mode = caused by main
prot., emergency overcurrent protection starts automatically when the main protection fails. This would
happen, for example, in the case of distance protection when a short circuit or outage occurs in the voltage-
transformer secondary side; or in the case of line differential protection if the in protection communication
fails. This means that the emergency mode replaces the main protection as short-circuit protection. With the
appropriate parameterization (Emergency mode = caused by binary input), the emergency mode can
also be activated from an external source.
If the overcurrent protection is set as backup overcurrent protection (parameter Emergency mode = no), it
operates independently of the main protection and thus in parallel. Backup overcurrent protection can also
serve as sole short-circuit protection when, for example, no voltage transformers are available for an initial
startup.
Pickup and Dropout Behavior of the Inverse-Time Characteristic Curve according to IEC and ANSI
When the input variable exceeds the threshold value by a factor of 1.1, the inverse-time characteristic curve
is processed. An integrating method of measurement summarizes the weighted time. The weighted time
results from the characteristic curve. For this, the time that is associated with the present current value is
determined from the characteristic curve. Once the weighted time exceeds the value 1, the stage operates.

C53000-G5040-C028-2, Edition 07.2024


When the measured value falls below the pickup value by a factor of 1.045 (0.95 x 1.1 x threshold value), the
dropout is started. The pickup will be indicated as clearing. You can influence the dropout behavior via setting
parameters. You can select between instantaneous dropout (totalized time is deleted) or dropout according
to the characteristic curve (reduction of totalized time depending on the characteristic curve). The dropout
according to characteristic curve (disk emulation) is the same as turning back a rotor disk. The weighted
reduction of the time is initiated from 0.9 of the set threshold value.
The characteristic curve and associated formulas are shown in the Technical Data.
Minimum Time of the Curve
With the parameter Min. time of the curve, you define a minimum operate delay time. The operate
delay time of inverse-time characteristic curve never falls below the minimum operate delay time.
[dw_ocp_3_mi, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-79
Minimum Operating Time of the Curve
Additional time delay
With the parameter Additional time delay, you define a definite-time delay in addition to the inverse-
time delay. With this setting, the whole curve is shifted on the time axis by this additional definite time.
Method of measurement
You use the Method of measurement parameter to define whether the stage uses the fundamental
comp. or the calculated RMS value.
•
Measurement of the fundamental component:
This method of measurement processes the sampled current values and filters out the fundamental
component numerically.
•
Measurement of the RMS value:
This method of measurement determines the current amplitude from the sampled values according to
the defining equation of the RMS value. Harmonics are included in the analysis.
Pickup Delay
If the current exceeds the threshold value, the pickup delay starts. If the threshold is exceeded during the
pickup delay time, the pickup signal is generated.

Blocking of the Stage
The following blockings reset the picked up stage completely:
•
Via the binary input signal >Block stage from an external or internal source
•
Via the functionality of the dynamic settings
Blocking of the Time Delay
You can use the binary input signal >Block delay & op. to prevent the start of the time delay and
thus also the operate signal. A running time delay is reset. The pickup is indicated and the fault logging and
recording takes place.
Blocking of the Operate Delay and the Operate Signal via the Device-Internal Inrush-Current Detection Function
In conjunction with the function Inrush-current detection, the tripping delay and the trip signal can be
blocked.
Application and Setting Notes
Parameter: Emergency mode
•
Default setting (_:2311:101) Emergency mode = no
The Emergency mode parameter is set for all stages. The setting applies equally to all stages within the
function.
Parameter Value
Description
no
Overcurrent protection does not operate in emergency mode. It is always
active in parallel to main protection.
caused by main prot.
Overcurrent protection operates in emergency mode. If main protection can
no longer operate, overcurrent protection automatically starts to operate.
If the distance protection is the main protection, this can no longer operate
in the event of a measuring-voltage failure. The overcurrent protection will
then operate in emergency mode.
caused by binary input
Overcurrent protection operates in emergency mode. Activation is not
performed automatically by internal main protection, but via a binary input
signal, for example, by an external main protection.
Parameter: Method of measurement
•
Recommended setting value (_:691:8) Method of measurement = fundamental comp.
With the Method of measurement parameter, you define whether the stage uses the fundamental
comp. (standard method) or the calculated RMS value.
Parameter Value
Description
fundamental comp.
Select this method of measurement if harmonics or transient current peaks
are to be suppressed.
Siemens recommends using this method as the standard method.
RMS value
Select this method of measurement if you want the stage to take harmonics
into account (for example, at capacitor banks). Consider that aperiodic DC
components present in the secondary circuit are measured and can cause
an overfunction.
For this method of measurement, do not set the threshold value of the
stage to less than 0.1 Irated,sec. If currents from more than one measuring
point are added up in the current interface of a function group, the setting
value should not be set lower than 0.1 Irated,sec multiplied by the number of
added currents.

C53000-G5040-C028-2, Edition 07.2024


Parameter: Threshold
•
Default setting (_:691:3) Threshold = 1.500 A
Set the Threshold and Type of character. curve parameters for the specific application.
The setting depends on the maximum occurring operating current. Pickup by overload must be excluded
since overcurrent protection operates with short tripping times as short-circuit protection and not as overload
protection. Set the Threshold parameter for lines to approx. 10 % over the maximum expected load.
Note that a safety margin is set between pickup value and threshold value. The stage only picks up at
approx. 10 % above the Threshold.
Parameter: Pickup delay
•
Default setting (_:661:102) Pickup delay = 0.00 s
For special applications, it is desirable that, if the current threshold is briefly exceeded, this does not lead to
the pickup of the stage and the start of fault logging or recording. If this stage is used as a thermal overload
function, that is considered a special application.
With the Pickup delay parameter, you can define a time interval during which a pickup is not triggered if
the current threshold is exceeded.
For all short-circuit protection applications, this value is 0.00 s as default.
Parameter: Type of character. curve
•
Default setting (_:691:130) Type of character. curve = IEC normal inverse
The device offers all the usual inverse-time characteristic curves according to IEC and ANSI. Select the Type
of character. curve required for your specific application.
You can find further information on the types of characteristic curve in the Technical Data.
Parameter: Min. time of the curve
•
Default setting (_:691:113) Min. time of the curve = 0.00 s
With the Min. time of the curve parameter, you can define a minimum operate delay. The operate
delay for the inverse-time characteristic curve never falls below the minimum operate delay. If you leave the
parameter at the default setting of 0 s, then this has no effect on the inverse-time characteristic curve.
This parameter is only required for time coordination of circuit breakers with automatic reclosing function. For
all other applications, Siemens recommends that you maintain the default setting of 0 s.
Parameter: Reset
•
Default setting (_:691:131) Reset = disk emulation
With the Reset parameter, you can define whether the stage drops out according to the dropout character-
istic curve (in accordance with the behavior of a disk emulation = rotor disc) or instantaneously.
Parameter Value
Description
disk emulation
Select this setting if the device is coordinated with electromechanical
devices or other devices which perform a dropout after a disk emulation.
instantaneous
Use this setting if the dropout is not to be performed after disk emulation
and an instantaneous dropout is desired instead.
Parameter: Time dial
•
Default setting (_:691:101) Time dial = 1.00
With the Time dial parameter, you can displace the characteristic curve in the time direction.
The setting value for the Time dial parameter is derived from the time-grading schedule that has been
prepared for the power system. Where overcurrent protection is used in emergency mode, shorter time delays
might be reasonable (one grading time above switch-onto-fault tripping), since the emergency mode only
operates if the main protection function fails.
Protection and Automation Functions

SIPROTEC 5, Contact Line Protection, Manual
429
C53000-G5040-C028-2, Edition 07.2024


Where no time grading and therefore no displacement of the characteristic curve is required, leave the Time
dial parameter at 1.00 (default setting).
Parameter: Additional time delay
•
Default setting (_:691:115) Additional time delay = 0.00 s
With the Additional time delay parameter, you can also define a definite-time delay in addition to the
inverse-time delay.
If you leave the parameter at the default setting of 0 s, then this has no effect on the inverse-time character-
istic curve.
This parameter is only required for time coordination of circuit breakers with automatic reclosing function. For
all other applications, Siemens recommends that you maintain the default setting of 0 s.

Influence of Other Functions via Dynamic Settings
Description
The parameters Threshold and Operate delay used for tripping are so-called dynamic settings.
Depending on other functions, the settings of these parameters can be changed dynamically (see
Figure 6-80). Depending on other functions, the stage can also be blocked dynamically.

If available in the device, the following functionalities can affect the overcurrent-protection stages:
Functionalities
Priority
Automatic reclosing (AREC)
Priority 1
Binary input signal
Priority 2
These functionalities generate signals that change the settings of the dynamic settings of the overcurrent-
protection stage or block it, if required. In the latter case, the settings of the Threshold and Operate
delay parameters are of no relevance. Within the overcurrent-protection stage, each of these signals is
provided with a configuration parameter Influence of function ... and its own dynamic settings
(Operate delay and Threshold). The configuration settings are used to set whether the signal shall be
active or not, this means whether the dynamic settings shall be activated or not. If one of these signals (for
example, signal function x) becomes active and is to take effect, these settings become dynamic, that is,
instantly active. This means that the setting assigned to the signal replaces the standard setting. If the signal
becomes inactive, the standard settings apply again. The activation of the dynamic settings is reported.

Where several signals are active in parallel, the priority specified above shall apply. This means that a signal

not visible and are without effect.

Several AREC signals can affect the setting for the Threshold and Operate delay parameters of the
protection stage and its blocking.
•
AREC is ready for reclosing 1 (= Automatic reclosing cycle 1)
•
AREC is ready for reclosing 2 (= Automatic reclosing cycle 2)
•
AREC is ready for reclosing 3 (= Automatic reclosing cycle 3)
•
AREC is ready for reclosing 4 (= Automatic reclosing cycle >3)
The following signal can only block the protection stage:
•
AREC is not ready or switched off (= Automatic reclosing off / not ready)
This means that if the AREC is ready and the protection stage is in the idle state, the settings for
AREC cycle 1 are active and not the standard settings. The standard settings are active in the case of
AREC off/not ready.
The influence can be activated for each signal individually. You also have to set the Threshold and Operate
delay or Stage blocked parameters, which take effect when the signal is active.
The way AREC signals are generated is described in 6.6.1 Overview of Functions.
Link to an External Function via a Binary Input Signal
[lo_ocp3bin, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-82
Influence of the Binary Input on the Overcurrent-Protection Stage
You can use the binary input signal >Activ. dyn. settings to change the settings for the Threshold
and the Operate delay parameters of the protection stage. You can also block the stage. To do so, you
must activate the influence of the binary input. You also have to set the Threshold and Operate delay or
assign settings to Stage blocked, which take effect when the signal is active.

If a device-internal function (automatic reclosing function) should affect the
overcurrent-protection stage (such as change the setting of the threshold
value or time delay, blocking of the stage), the setting must be changed to
yes.
This makes the dynamic settings Threshold, Operate delay and Stage

Influence of AREC
The example of how the overcurrent stage (1st stage) can be used as a fast stage before automatic reclosing
describes the influence exerted by AREC.
The setting of the overcurrent stage (1st stage) results from the time-grading schedule. Additionally, it is to
be used as fast stage before an automatic reclosing. Because a fast disconnection of the short-circuit current
takes priority over the selectivity prior to reclosing, the tripping delay can be set to 0 or a very small value. To
achieve the selectivity, the final disconnection must be done with the grading time.
AREC is set to 2 reclosings. A secondary Threshold of 1.5 A and a Operate delay of 600 ms are
assumed (according to the time-grading schedule) for the overcurrent-protection stage. The standard settings
of the stage are set to these values.
To realize the application, the configuration settings Effected by AR cycle 1 and Effected by AR
cycle 2 are changed in the example to yes (= influenced). This activates the AR cycle 1 and AR cycle
2 input signals within the stage. When they become active, they switch to the assigned dynamic settings.
The two dynamic settings Operate delay assigned to these input signals (sources of influence) are set
to the time delay 0 (instantaneous tripping). The two dynamic settings Threshold assigned to these input
signals are set to the normal threshold value of 1.5 A.
If the threshold value (1.5 A) is exceeded before AREC 1 and AREC 2, the overcurrent-protection stage trips
instantaneously. If the fault still exists after AREC 2 (unsuccessful AREC), the stage trips with the time delay of
600 ms according to the time-grading schedule.

Directional Overcurrent Protection
Overview of Functions
The Directional overcurrent protection, phases function (ANSI 67):
•
Detects short circuits at electrical equipment
•
Can be used as backup or emergency overcurrent protection in addition to the main protection
Structure of the Function
The Directional overcurrent protection function is used in protection function groups
The Directional overcurrent protection function is preconfigured by the manufacturer with 2  Definite-time
directional overcurrent protection stages and 1 Inverse-time directional overcurrent protection stage.
In the function type Directional overcurrent protection, the following stages can be operated simultane-
ously:
•
Maximum of 4 stages Definite-time directional overcurrent protection
•
1 stage Inverse-time directional overcurrent protection
The function is implemented such that the emergency mode can act across all Directional overcurrent
protection stages.
Stages that are not preconfigured are shown in gray in the following figures. Apart from the tripping delay
characteristic, the stages are identical in structure.
The group-indication output logic generates the following group indications of the protection function by the
logical OR of the stage-selective indications:

Emergency Mode
You use the Emergency mode parameter to define whether the stage operates as emergency overcurrent
protection or as backup overcurrent protection. With the setting Emergency mode = caused by main
prot., emergency overcurrent protection starts automatically when the main protection fails. With the
appropriate parameterization (Emergency mode = caused by binary input), the emergency mode can
also be activated from an external source.
If the overcurrent protection is set as backup overcurrent protection (parameter Emergency mode = no), it
operates independently of the main protection and thus in parallel.

NOTE
If the voltage measurement is disturbed, the current direction cannot be determined.
Blocking of the Stage with Measuring-Voltage Failure
The stage can be blocked if a measuring-voltage failure occurs. In the event of blocking, the picked up stage
will be reset. The following blocking options are available for the stage:
•
From inside on pickup of the Measuring-voltage failure detection function (see chapter 8.3.2.1 Over-
view of Functions)
•

Overcurrent protection operates in emergency mode. Activation is not
performed automatically by internal main protection, but via a binary input
signal, for example, by an external main protection.
Parameter: Blk. by meas.-volt. failure
•
Recommended setting value (_:8131:10) Blk. by meas.-volt. failure = yes
You use the Blk. by meas.-volt. failure parameter to control the behavior of the stage when a
measuring-voltage failure is detected.
A measuring-voltage failure can only be detected if one of the following two conditions is met:
•
The device-internal supervision function Measuring-voltage failure detection is configured and
switched on.
•
The binary input signal >Open of the function block VTCB is connected to the voltage-transformer circuit
breaker (see chapter 8.3.4.1 Overview of Functions).
Parameter Value

The directional overcurrent-protection stage is blocked. Siemens recom-
mends that you retain the default setting, as correct direction determination
cannot be guaranteed if a measuring-voltage failure occurs.

Direction Determination
If the threshold value is exceeded, the direction determination starts.
In contact-line systems, the direction determination operates with the voltage of the contact line V CL and the
current of the contact line I CL.
In auto-transformer systems, the selection of the measurands used for direction determination depends on
whether the voltage of the negative feeder is measured and on which measurand you use for the current
(refer to Parameter: Phase selection of CL/nF, Page 237).
The following table shows the assignment of the measurands für the direction determination in auto-trans-
former systems:

Non-Directional Pickup, Voltage Memory
If a close-up fault occurs, the voltage drops to almost 0. If this happens, direction determination can fall back
on a voltage memory. If no voltage measurements which can be used to determine the direction are available
in the voltage memory, the response can be defined via the Non-directional pickup parameter. With
the at volt.< & mem.empty setting, the function picks up in such a situation without direction determina-
tion. With the no setting, the function does not pick up.
Directional Comparison Protection
The stage can be used for directional comparison protection. This is set using the Directional compar-
ison parameter. With the yes setting, the function uses the threshold-value violation to determine the
direction (forward or reverse) and reports the indication Direction. The direction indicated is independent
of the directional mode set for the stage.
The Release via input signal setting and the >Release delay & op. input signal are available
with directional comparison protection. If the Release via input signal parameter is set to yes, the
start of the time delay, and therefore the tripping of the stage, are only enabled if the >Release delay &
op. input signal is active.
Method of Measurement
You use the Method of measurement parameter to define whether the stage uses the fundamental
comp. or the calculated RMS value.
•
Measurement of the fundamental component:
This method of measurement processes the sampled current values and filters out the fundamental
component numerically.
•
Measurement of the RMS value:
This method of measurement determines the current amplitude from the sampled values according to
the defining equation of the RMS value. Harmonics are included in the analysis.
Dropout Delay
If the current falls below the dropout threshold, the dropout can be delayed for the time specified by the
parameter Dropout delay. During the dropout delay, the pickup is maintained. Meanwhile, the operate
delay continues to run. If the operate delay expires while the pickup is still maintained, the stage operates.

If the current falls below the dropout threshold, the dropout can be delayed for the time specified by the
parameter Dropout delay. During the dropout delay, the pickup is maintained. Meanwhile, the operate
delay continues to run. If both the following conditions are met, the stage operates:
•
The operate delay expires while the pickup is still maintained.
•
The current exceeds the pickup threshold value.
Blocking of the Stage
The following blockings reset the picked up stage completely:
•
Externally or internally via the binary input signal >Block stage (see chapter 6.10.3.1 Description )
•
Measuring-voltage failure (see chapter 6.10.3.1 Description )
•
Via the dynamic settings function
Blocking of the Time Delay
You can use the binary input signal >Block delay & op. to prevent the start of the time delay and
thus also the operate signal. A running time delay is reset. The pickup is indicated and the fault logging and
recording takes place.
Influence of Other Functions via Dynamic Settings (Advanced Stage)
If available in the device, the following functions can influence the overcurrent-protection stages:
•
Automatic reclosing
•
Binary input signal
The influence of these functions via dynamic settings is described in chapter 6.9.5.1 Description .

Parameter Value
Description
fundamental comp.
Select this method of measurement if harmonics or transient current peaks
are to be suppressed.
Siemens recommends using this method as the standard method.
RMS value
Select this method of measurement if you want the stage to take harmonics
into account (for example, at capacitor banks). Consider that aperiodic DC
components present in the secondary circuit are measured and can cause
an overfunction.
For this method of measurement, do not set the threshold value of the
stage to less than 0.1 Irated,sec. If currents from more than one measuring
point are added up in the current interface of a function group, the setting
value should not be set lower than 0.1 Irated,sec multiplied by the number of
added currents.
Parameter: Directional comparison, Release via input signal
•
Default setting (_:8131:104) Directional comparison = no
•
Default setting (_:8131:106) Release via input signal = no
You use these parameters to define whether the stage is to be used for directional comparison protection.

Parameter Value
Description
no
The stage is not used for directional comparison protection.
yes
If the Directional comparison parameter is set to yes, the Release
via input signal parameter, the Direction output signal, and the
>Release delay & op. input signal become available.
If the Release via input signal parameter is set to yes, the start
of the time delay, and therefore also the operate signal of the stage, are
only enabled if the >Release delay & op. input signal is active. The
>Release delay & op. input signal must be connected to the release
information from the opposite end (forward information from the Direc-
tion output signal); see also the application example in 6.10.7 Application
Notes for Directional Comparison Protection .
Parameter: Non-directional pickup
•
Recommended setting value (_:8131:107) Non-directional pickup = at volt.< &
mem.empty
Parameter Value
Description
at volt.< & mem.empty
Select this setting if the stage is to pick up in a non-directional manner if the
voltage memory is empty and determining of direction has to be performed
at low voltages. An empty voltage memory may exist, for example, if there
is a voltage transformer at the line end and the circuit breaker (CB) trips.
Siemens recommends using the default setting.
no
Select this setting if determining of direction is required under all circum-
stances, that is, even in the event of pickup on a close-up fault.
Parameter: Threshold, Operate delay
•
Default setting (_:8131:3) Threshold = 1.500 A (for the 1st stage)
•
Default setting (_:8131:6) Operate delay = 0.30 s (for the 1st stage)

The following details apply to a 2-stage characteristic curve (1st stage = definite-time overcurrent protection
stage and 2nd stage = high-current stage).
•
1st stage (overcurrent stage):
The setting depends on the maximum occurring operating current. Pickup by overload must be excluded
since overcurrent protection operates with short tripping times as short-circuit protection and not as
overload protection. Therefore, set the Threshold parameter for lines to approx. 10 % above the
maximum load that is expected.
•
2nd stage (high-current stage):
This stage can also be used for current grading. This applies in the case of very long lines with low source
impedance or ahead of high reactances (for example, transformers, shunt reactors). Set the Threshold
parameter to ensure that the stage does not pick up in case of a short circuit at the end of the line. Set
the Operate delay parameter to 0 or to a low value.
Siemens recommends that the threshold values be determined with a system analysis.
Parameter: Dropout ratio
•
Recommended setting value (_:8131:4) Dropout ratio = 0.95
The recommended set value of 0.95 is appropriate for most applications.
For high-precision measurements, the setting value of the Dropout ratio parameter can be reduced, for
example to 0.98. If you expect heavily fluctuating measurands at the response threshold, you can increase the
setting value of the Dropout ratio parameter. This avoids chattering of the tripping stage.
Parameter: Dropout delay
•
Recommended setting value (_:8131:101) Dropout delay = 0 s
Siemens recommends using this setting value, since the dropout of a protection stage must be performed as
fast as possible.
You can use the Dropout delay parameter ≠ 0 s to obtain a uniform dropout behavior if you use
it together with an electromechanical relay. This is required for time grading. The dropout time of the
electromechanical relay must be known for this purpose. Subtract the dropout time of your own device (see
Technical Data) and set the result.

Direction Determination
If the threshold value is exceeded, the direction determination starts.
In contact-line systems, the direction determination operates with the voltage of the contact line V CL and the
current of the contact line I CL.
In auto-transformer systems, the selection of the measurands used for direction determination depends on
whether the voltage of the negative feeder is measured and on which measurand you use for the current
(refer to Parameter: Phase selection of CL/nF, Page 237).
The following table shows the assignment of the measurands für the direction determination in auto-trans-
former systems:

Non-Directional Pickup, Voltage Memory
If a close-up fault occurs, the voltage drops to almost 0. If this happens, direction determination can fall back
on a voltage memory. If no voltage measurements which can be used to determine the direction are available
in the voltage memory, the response can be defined via the Non-directional pickup parameter. With
the at volt.< & mem.empty setting, the function picks up in such a situation without direction determina-
tion. With the no setting, the function does not pick up.
Directional Comparison Protection
The stage can be used for directional comparison protection. This is set using the Directional compar-
ison parameter. With the yes setting, the function uses the threshold-value violation to determine the
direction (forward or reverse) and reports the indication Direction. The direction indicated is independent
of the directional mode set for the stage.
The Release via input signal setting and the >Release delay & op. input signal are available
with directional comparison protection. If the Release via input signal parameter is set to yes, the
start of the time delay, and therefore the tripping of the stage, are only enabled if the >Release delay &
op. input signal is active.
Pickup and Dropout Behaviors of the Inverse-Time Characteristic Curve According to IEC and ANSI
When the input variable exceeds the threshold value by a factor of 1.1, the inverse-time characteristic curve is
processed. An integrating method of measurement summarizes the weighted time. The weighted time results
from the characteristic curve. For this, the time that is associated with the present current value is determined
from the characteristic curve. Once the weighted time exceeds the value 1, the stage operates.
When the measured value falls below the pickup value by a factor of 1.045 (0.95 ⋅ 1.1 ⋅ threshold value), the
dropout is started. The pickup will be indicated as clearing. You can influence the dropout behavior via setting
parameters. You can select between instantaneous dropout (totalized time is deleted) or dropout according
to the characteristic curve (reduction of totalized time depending on the characteristic curve). The dropout
according to characteristic curve (disk emulation) is the same as turning back a rotor disk. The weighted
reduction of the time is initiated from 0.9 of the set threshold value.
The characteristic curve and associated formulas are shown in the Technical Data.
Minimum Time of the Curve
With the parameter Min. time of the curve, you define a minimum operate delay time. The operate
delay time of inverse-time characteristic curve never falls below the minimum operate delay time.

Minimum Operating Time of the Curve
Additional Time Delay
With the parameter Additional time delay, you define a definite-time delay in addition to the inverse-
time delay. With this setting, the whole curve is shifted on the time axis by this additional definite time.
Blocking of the Stage
The following blockings reset the picked up stage completely:
•
Externally or internally via the binary input signal >Block stage (see chapter 6.10.3.1 Description )
•
Via the functionality of the dynamic settings (
Blocking of the Time Delay
You can use the binary input signal >Block delay & op. to prevent the start of the time delay and thus
also the operate signal. A running time delay is reset. The pickup is indicated and a fault record is opened.
Blocking of the Operate Delay and the Operate Signal via the Device-Internal Inrush-Current Detection Function
Blocking of the operate delay and the operate signal via the device-internal Inrush-current detection function
is possible.
Influence of Other Functions via Dynamic Settings (Advanced Stage)
If available in the device, the following functions can influence the overcurrent-protection stages:
•
Automatic reclosing
•
Binary input signal
The influence of these functions via dynamic settings is described in chapter 6.9.5.1 Description .
Application and Setting Notes
Parameter: Directional mode

Parameter Value
Description
forward
Select this setting if the stage is to work in a forward direction (in the
direction of the line).
reverse
Select this setting if the stage is to work in a reverse direction (in the
direction of the busbar).
Parameter: Method of measurement
•
Recommended setting value (_:8161:8) Method of measurement = fundamental comp.
With the Method of measurement parameter, you define whether the stage uses the fundamental
comp. (standard method) or the calculated RMS value.
Parameter Value
Description
fundamental comp.
Select this method of measurement if harmonics or transient current peaks
are to be suppressed.
Siemens recommends using this method as the standard method.
RMS value
Select this method of measurement if you want the stage to take harmonics
into account (for example, at capacitor banks). Consider that aperiodic DC
components present in the secondary circuit are measured and can cause
an overfunction.
For this method of measurement, do not set the threshold value of the
stage to less than 0.1 Irated,sec. If currents from more than one measuring
point are added up in the current interface of a function group, the setting
value should not be set lower than 0.1 Irated,sec multiplied by the number of
added currents.
Parameter: Directional comparison, Release via input signal
•
Default setting (_:8161:110) Directional comparison = no
•
Default setting (_:8161:112) Release via input signal = no
You use these parameters to define whether the stage is to be used for directional comparison protection.
Directional comparison protection is performed via the Direction and >Release delay & op. signals.
Parameter Value
Description
no
The stage is not used for directional comparison protection.
yes
If the Directional comparison parameter is set to yes, the Release
via input signal parameter, the Direction output signal, and the
>Release delay & op. input signal become available.
If the Release via input signal parameter is set to yes, the start
of the time delay, and therefore also the operate signal of the stage, are
only enabled if the >Release delay & op. input signal is active. The
>Release delay & op. input signal must be connected to the release
information from the opposite end (forward information from the Direc-
tion output signal); see also the application example in 6.10.7 Application

Parameter Value
Description
at volt.< & mem.empty
Select this setting if the stage is to pick up in a non-directional manner if the
voltage memory is empty and determining of direction has to be performed
at low voltages. An empty voltage memory may exist, for example, if there
is a voltage transformer at the line end and the CB trips.
Siemens recommends using the default setting.
no
Select this setting if determining of direction is required under all circum-
stances, that is, even in the event of pickup on a close-up fault.
Parameter: Type of character. curve
•
Default setting (_:8161:130) Type of character. curve = IEC normal inverse
The device offers all the usual inverse-time characteristic curves according to IEC and ANSI. Select the Type
of character. curve required for your specific application.
For more information on the parameter Type of character. curve, refer to the technical data.
Parameter: Min. time of the curve
•
Default setting (_:8161:114) Min. time of the curve = 0.00 s
With the parameter Min. time of the curve, you define a minimum operate delay time. The operate
delay time of inverse-time characteristic curve never falls below the minimum operate delay time. If the
setting is left on its default value of 0 s, this parameter has no effect on the inverse-time characteristic curve.
This parameter is only required for time coordination in recloser schemes. For all other applications, Siemens
recommends keeping the default setting of 0 s.
Parameter: Additional time delay
•
Default setting (_:8161:115) Additional time delay = 0.00 s
With the parameter Additional time delay, you define a definite-time delay in addition to the inverse-
time delay.
If the setting is left on its default value of 0 s, this parameter has no effect on the inverse-time characteristic
curve.
This parameter is only required for time coordination in recloser schemes. For all other applications, Siemens
recommends keeping the default setting of 0 s.
Parameter: Threshold
•
Default setting (_:8161:3) Threshold = 1.50 A
The same considerations apply to setting the threshold value as for non-directional overcurrent protection.
Therefore, refer to 6.9.4.2 Application and Setting Notes for further information.
Parameter: Time dial
•
Default setting (_:8161:101) Time dial = 1
Use the Time dial parameter to displace the characteristic curve in the time direction.
The set value for the Time dial parameter is derived from the time-grading chart that has been prepared
for the electrical power system. Where overcurrent protection is used in emergency mode, shorter time delays
might be reasonable (one grading time above fast tripping), since the emergency mode only operates if the
main protection function fails.
Where no time grading and therefore no displacement of the characteristic curve is required, leave the Time
dial parameter at 1 (default setting).
Parameter: Reset

Influence of Other Functions via Dynamic Settings

6.9.5.2 Application and Setting Notes.
Application Notes for Directional Comparison Protection
The direction determination of directional overcurrent protection can be used to implement directional
comparison protection for cable runs with infeed at both ends. Directional comparison protection is used
for the selective isolation of a faulted line section (for example, subsections of closed rings). Sections are
isolated in fast time, that is, they do not suffer the disadvantage of long grading times.
This technique requires that directional information can be exchanged between the individual protection
stations. You can implement this information exchange using a communication channel (protection interface
or IEC 61850 GOOSE) or with pilot wires for signal transmission via an auxiliary voltage loop.
Protection Principle
The protection principle is shown in Figure 6-88. 2 devices (one at the start of the line and the other at the
end of the line) work together in each line section. The information fault in forward direction is transferred
between them. A directional definite-time overcurrent protection level is in operation in both devices in the
forward direction (1st level). However, this level is not enabled in the idle state. The level is only released
when the information fault in forward direction is received from the opposite end. If the enabled level also
defines the fault in the forward direction, the fault must be on this line section and the level trips immediately.
As this protection principle works with an enable procedure (and not with a blocking procedure), there is no
need to delay the level.

C53000-G5040-C028-2, Edition 07.2024


A second directional definite-time overcurrent protection stage with standard time grading works in parallel
with the first stage as a selective backup stage. This ensures full selectivity of protection in the following
situations:
•
Infeed at one end or weak infeed at one end: In this case, no release signal is generated.
•
Failure of the communication route: In this case, the release signal is not transmitted.
To provide selective protection in fast time for busbars between the line sections also, you can combine this
protection principle with the principle of reverse interlocking. This principle is not discussed in further detail in
this document.

Selectivity through Directional Comparison Protection
Legend for Figure 6-88
Stage ▶:
▶, ◀:
Stage is set in the forward direction; stage 1 is instantaneous, stage 2 is graded
If a threshold value is exceeded, the stage indicates the direction (forward or reverse)
If you are using a communication channel, the protocol-transmission methods detect if the channel is inter-
rupted. If you are using pilot wires, Siemens recommends an operation based on a closed-circuit connection.
The device uses a CFC chart to check and indicate if the binary input is dead for an unexpectedly long period.
In contrast with the blocking procedure, overfunction is not possible if communication is lost. Therefore, a
loss of communication is not critical where this procedure is concerned, although it must be detected and
indicated.
Directional comparison protection can also be implemented as a blocking procedure. This procedure works
under all system switching states, i.e. also with infeed at one end (or weak infeed). However, to use it
you must delay the stage (typically by 100 ms) so that the blocking signal is received in time under all
circumstances. It is also essential that you monitor the communication channel to avoid overfunction in the
event of failure followed by a system incident.
Configuration of the Stage, CFC Chart
To configure the stage, proceed as follows:
•
The Directional mode parameter of both stages must be set to forward
•
The Directional comparison and Release via input signal parameters of the first stage
must be set to yes. This is so that the first stage is only released if the >Release delay & op. input
signal is active. Furthermore, the direction is indicated if a threshold value is exceeded.
•
The first stage can be set without a time delay. The second stage has to be graded
•
The information forward from the Direction signal in the first stage must be transmitted to the
opposite end. The routing is determined by the type of transmission
•
A CFC chart has to be implemented at the receive end to link the received (forward information) and
release signals, dependent upon the type of transmission.

Measurement of the RMS value:
This method of measurement determines the current amplitude from the sampled values according to
the defining equation of the RMS value. Harmonics are included in the analysis.
Voltage-Dependent Pickup Threshold
The pickup threshold of the overcurrent stage depends on the voltage magnitude. A lower voltage decreases
the current pickup value (see Figure 6-91). In the range between V/Vrated = 1.00 to 0.25 a linear, directly
proportional dependence is realized.

Pickup and Dropout Behaviors of the Inverse-Time Characteristic Curve According to IEC and ANSI
When the input variable exceeds the threshold value by a factor of 1.1, the inverse-time characteristic curve is
processed. An integrating method of measurement summarizes the weighted time. The weighted time results
from the characteristic curve. For this, the time that is associated with the present current value is determined
from the characteristic curve. Once the weighted time exceeds the value 1, the stage operates.
When the measured value falls below the pickup value by a factor of 1.045 (0.95 ⋅ 1.1 ⋅ threshold value), the
dropout is started. The pickup will be indicated as clearing. You can influence the dropout behavior via setting

parameters. You can select between instantaneous dropout (totalized time is deleted) or dropout according
to the characteristic curve (reduction of totalized time depending on the characteristic curve). The dropout
according to characteristic curve (disk emulation) is the same as turning back a rotor disk. The weighted
reduction of the time is initiated from 0.9 of the set threshold value.
The characteristic curve and associated formulas are shown in the Technical Data.
Influence On the Operate Curve
The current pickup threshold is decreased proportional to the voltage decrease. Consequently, for a constant
current I the I/Threshold-value ratio is increased and the operate time is reduced. Compared with the standard
curves represented in the Technical Data, the operate curve shifts to the left side as the voltage decreases.
Measuring-Voltage Failure Detection
In case of a measuring-voltage failure detection the input voltage value is automatically set to Vrated, so that
the pickup threshold factor will be 1.
Blocking of the Time Delay
You can use the binary input signal >Block delay & op. to prevent the start of the time delay and
thus also the operate signal. A running time delay is reset. The pickup is indicated and the fault logging and
recording takes place.
Blocking of the Operate Delay and the Operate Signal via the Device-Internal Inrush-Current Detection Function
The operate delay and the operate signal can be blocked via the device-internal function Inrush-current
detection.
Application and Setting Notes
Parameter: Blk. w. inrush curr. detect.
•
Default setting (_:22651:27) Blk. w. inrush curr. detect. = no
Parameter Value
Description
no
The transformer inrush-current detection does not affect the stage. Select
this setting in the following cases:
•
In cases where the device is not used on transformers.
•
In cases where the device is used on transformers and the threshold
value of the stage is set above the maximum inrush current of the
transformer. This applies, for example, to the high-current stage that
is set according to the short-circuit voltage uk of the transformer in
such a way that the stage only picks up on faults from the high-voltage
side. The transformer-inrush current cannot become larger than the
maximum transmittable short-circuit current.
yes
When the transformer inrush-current detection detects an inrush current
that would lead to a tripping of the stage, the start of the time delay and
tripping of the stage are blocked.
Select this setting if the device is used on transformers and the threshold
value of the stage is set below the maximum inrush current of the trans-
former. This applies to the overcurrent-protection stage, which is used as a
backup stage with grading time for faults on the undervoltage side of the
transformer.

With the Method of measurement parameter, you define whether the stage uses the fundamental
comp. (standard method) or the calculated RMS value.
Parameter Value
Description
fundamental comp.
Select this method of measurement if harmonics or transient current peaks
are to be suppressed.
Siemens recommends using this method as the standard method.
RMS value
Select this method of measurement if you want the stage to take harmonics
into account (for example, at capacitor banks). Consider that aperiodic DC
components present in the secondary circuit are measured and can cause
an overfunction.
For this method of measurement, do not set the threshold value of the
stage to less than 0.1 Irated,sec. If currents from more than one measuring
point are added up in the current interface of a function group, the setting
value should not be set lower than 0.1 Irated,sec multiplied by the number of
added currents.
Parameter: Threshold
•
Default setting (_:22651:3) Threshold = 1.500 A
The recommended setting value of 1.500 A is suitable for most applications.
Set the Threshold and Type of character. curve parameters for the specific application.
The setting depends on the maximum occurring operating current. Pickup by overload must be excluded
since overcurrent protection operates with short tripping times as short-circuit protection and not as overload
protection.
Set the Threshold parameter for lines to approx.10 %, for transformers to approx. 20 % above the maximum
expected load.
Note that a safety margin is set between pickup value and threshold value. The stage only picks up at approx.
10 % above the Threshold.
Parameter Type of character. curve
•
Default setting (_:22651:101) Type of character. curve = IEC normal inverse
The device offers all the usual inverse-time characteristic curves according to IEC and ANSI. Select the Type
of character. curve required for your specific application.
Parameter: Reset
•
Default setting (_:22651:102) Reset = disk emulation
The Reset parameter allows you to define whether the stage decreases according to the dropout character-
istic curve (behavior of a disk emulation = rotor disc) or instantaneously.
Parameter Value
Description
disk emulation
Select this setting if the device is coordinated with electromechanical
devices or other devices which perform a dropout after a disk emulation.
instantaneous
Select this setting if the dropout does not have to be performed after a disk
emulation and an instantaneous dropout is desired instead.
Parameter: Time dial
•
Default setting (_:22651:103) Time dial = 1
You can use the Time dial parameter to displace the characteristic curve in the time direction.
The setting value for the Time dial parameter is derived from the time-grading chart that has been
prepared for the electrical power system.

Where no time grading and therefore no displacement of the characteristic curve is required, leave the
parameter Time dial at 1 (default setting).
Parameter: Undervoltage threshold
•
Default setting (_:22651:104) Undervoltage threshold = 75.000 V
With the parameter Undervoltage threshold, you set the threshold for the release of the stage. If the
minimum phase-to-ground voltage falls below the set threshold value, the stage is released. Set the parameter
Undervoltage threshold to a value below the lowest phase-to-ground voltage that is admissible during
operation, for example, to 75 % to 80 % of Vrated.

Measuring-Element Release
If the control voltage falls below the parameter Undervoltage threshold, the corresponding measuring
element is released.
Blocking the Stage in Case of a Measuring-Voltage Failure
The stage can be blocked in case of a measuring-voltage failure. In case of a blocking, the picked-up stage is
reset. The following blocking options are possible for the stage:
•
From inside upon pickup of the function Measuring-voltage failure detection
•
From an external source, via the binary input signal >open of the function block VT miniatureCB, which
leads to the tripping of the voltage-transformer circuit breaker.
With the parameter Blk. by meas.-volt. failure, you can set whether the stage is blocked or not if a
measuring-voltage failure is detected.
Application and Setting Notes
Parameter: Operate & flt.rec. blocked
•
Default setting (_:21631:2) Operate & flt.rec. blocked = no
With the parameter Operate & flt.rec. blocked, you can block the operate indication, the fault
recording, and the fault log.
Parameter: Threshold
•
Default setting (_:21631:3) Threshold = 1.350 A
The setting is mainly determined by the maximum operating current.
Pickup by overload must be excluded since the protection may trip if a short operate delay time is set. Set
the Threshold parameter for generators to a value between 20 % and 30 %, for transformers and motors
approx. 40 % above the expected peak load.
Parameter: Operate delay
•
Default setting (_:21631:6) Operate delay = 3.00 s
The parameter Operate delay must be coordinated with the time grading of the network protection to
guarantee the selectivity. Practical time delays are between 1 s to 2 s.
Parameter: Blk. by meas.-volt. failure
•
Default setting (_:21631:10) Blk. by meas.-volt. failure = yes
With the parameter Blk. by meas.-volt. failure, you can activate (yes) or deactivate (no) the
blocking by the Measuring voltage failure detection function. The recommended setting is the default
setting.
Parameter: Undervoltage threshold
•
Default setting (_:21631:104) Undervoltage threshold = 75.000 V
With the parameter Undervoltage threshold, you set the threshold for the release of the stage. If the
minimum phase-to-ground voltage falls below the set threshold value, the stage is released. Set the parameter
Undervoltage threshold to a value below the lowest phase-to-ground voltage that is admissible during
operation, for example, to 75 % to 80 % of Vrated.

Overvoltage Protection with Any Voltage
Overview of Functions
The function Overvoltage protection with any voltage (ANSI 59) detects the contact-line voltage and
protects equipment from consequential damage caused by overvoltage.
Voltage increases occur in low loaded, long contact lines, for example in auto-transformer systems with
multiple auto transformers in the course of the track.
In island networks, faults in the voltage control of generators, the full load shedding of a generator, or
generators disconnected from the power system lead to voltage increases.
Structure of the Function
The function Overvoltage protection with any voltage comes factory-set with 2 stages. A maximum of
3 tripping stages can be operated simultaneously in the function. The tripping stages have an identical
structure.

With the parameter Method of measurement, you define whether the stage uses the fundamental compo-
nent (standard method = default setting) or the calculated RMS value.
Parameter Value
Description
fundamental comp.
Select this method of measurement to suppress harmonics or transient
voltage peaks.
Siemens recommends this method of measurement as the default setting.
RMS value
Select this method of measurement if you want the stage to take harmonics
into account (for example, at capacitor banks). Do not set the threshold
value of the tripping stage under 10 V for this method of measurement.
Parameter: Threshold
•
Default setting (_:391:3) Threshold = 110 V
With the parameter Threshold, you set the pickup threshold for the specific application.
Parameter: Operate delay
•
Default setting (_:391:6) Operate delay = 3 s
Set the parameter Operate delay for the specific application.
Parameter: Dropout ratio
•
Recommended setting value (_:391:4) Dropout ratio = 0.95
The recommended setting value of 0.95 is appropriate for most applications. To achieve high measurement
precision, the Dropout ratio can be reduced, to 0.98, for example.
Operation as Supervision Function
If you want the tripping stage to have a reporting effect only, generation of the operate indication and fault
logging can be disabled via the parameter Operate & flt.rec. blocked.

Undervoltage Protection with Any Voltage
Overview of Functions
The function Undervoltage protection with any voltage (ANSI 27) detects the contact-line voltage and
protects equipment from consequential damage caused by undervoltage.
Undervoltages can affect the stability and permissible breakdown torques of induction machines. The under-
voltage protection detects pending stability problems and can be used in the power system for decoupling or
load-shedding tasks.
Structure of the Function
The function Undervoltage protection with any voltage is used in protection function groups, which are
based on voltage measurement.
The function Undervoltage protection with any voltage comes factory-set with 2 stages. A maximum of
3 tripping stages can be operated simultaneously in the function. The tripping stages have an identical
structure.
The protection function is structured in such a way that a current-flow criterion can affect all of the under-
voltage protection stages.
[dw_stuvux, 1, en_US]

Structure/Embedding of the Function
If you have set the option Pos. + Neg. Feeder for the parameter Phase selection of CL/nF
in auto-transformer systems, the function works with the contact-line voltage, refer to Parameter: Phase
selection of CL/nF, Page 237.

mental component or the calculated RMS value.

•
Measurement of the RMS value:
This method of measurement determines the voltage amplitude from the sampled values according to
the defining equation of the RMS value. Harmonics are included in the analysis.
Pickup Delay
The parameter Pickup delay is only available and relevant, if you use the Current-flow criterion of
the function.
If the circuit breaker opens when the current-flow criterion is being used, the undervoltage detection and
current-flow criterion dropout functions conflict with one another. Depending on the threshold-value settings
for undervoltage pickup and current-flow criterion, the undervoltage is detected before the current-flow
criterion has dropped out. In this case, the stage picks up briefly. With the parameter Pickup delay, you can
prevent this short stage pickup when the circuit breaker opens by delaying the pickup by approx. 40 ms.
Current-Flow Criterion
The undervoltage-protection stages work optionally with a current-flow criterion. The current-flow criterion
works across all stages.
When the parameter Current-flow criterion is switched on, the undervoltage protection stages pick
up if a settable minimum current (Threshold I>) is exceeded in at least one phase. A current below the
minimum current blocks the stage. The current-flow criterion can also be set to fulfilled via the binary input
signal Current-flow criterion. The function reports when the current-flow criterion is fulfilled.
Figure 6-96 illustrates the influence of the current-flow criterion.
i
i
NOTE
If the (_:2311:101) Current-flow criterion parameter is deactivated, the device picks up imme-
diately if a missing measuring voltage is detected while the undervoltage protection is active. The param-
eter setting can be changed even when the device has picked up.
Blocking the Stage
In the event of blocking, the picked-up stage will be reset. The following blocking options are available for the
stage:
•
Externally or internally via the binary input signal >Block stage
•
Internally on pickup of the function Measuring-voltage failure detection (refer to 8.3.2.1 Overview of
Functions. The parameter Blk. by meas.-volt. failure can be set so that the measuring-voltage
failure detection blocks the stage or not.
•
Externally via the binary input signal >Open of the function block VT miniatureCB, which leads to the
tripping of the voltage-transformer circuit breaker. The parameter Blk. by meas.-volt. failure
can be set so that the measuring-voltage failure detection blocks the stage or not.
Application and Setting Notes
Parameter: Current-flow criterion
•
Recommended setting value (_:2311:101) Current-flow criterion = on
Depending on the system, the voltage transformers are arranged either on the supply side or the feeder side.
These 2 possible voltage-transformer locations result in a different behavior of the function after tripping and
opening of the circuit breaker:
•
If they are located on the supply side, the voltage remains on.
•
If they are located on the feeder side, the voltage is switched off.

C53000-G5040-C028-2, Edition 07.2024


Parameter Value
Description
on
If the voltage transformers are located on the feeder side, you can use the
current-flow criterion to make the pickup drop out when the current falls
below a minimum value (parameter Threshold I>).
off
In case of an undervoltage, the pickup of the undervoltage protection stage
persists when the current-flow criterion is not used.
Parameter: Threshold I>
•
Recommended setting value (_:2311:102) Threshold I> = 0.05 A
With the parameter Threshold I>, the circuit breaker can be detected as closed. Siemens recommends
setting the value of the parameter Threshold I> to 5 % of the rated current. With a secondary rated
transformer current of 1 A, the secondary setting value for the Threshold I> is 0.05 A.
If the sensitivity of the parameter Threshold I> is set too high, compensation processes in the secondary
circuit of the current transformer extend the dropout time when disconnecting extremely high currents. To
speed up dropout, increase the default setting.
Parameter: Method of measurement
•
Recommended setting value (_:18481:8) Method of measurement = fundamental comp.
With the parameter Method of measurement, you define whether the stage uses the fundamental comp.
(standard method = default setting) or the calculated RMS value.
Parameter Value
Description
fundamental comp.
Select this method of measurement to suppress harmonics or transient
voltage peaks.
Siemens recommends using this parameter value as the default setting.
RMS value
Select this method of measurement if you want the stage to take harmonics
into account (for example, at capacitor banks). Do not set the threshold
valueThreshold of the tripping stage under 10 V for this method of
measurement.
Parameter: Threshold
•
Default setting (_:18481:3) Threshold = 80 V
Specify the Threshold (pickup threshold) for the specific application.
Parameter: Dropout ratio
•
Recommended setting value (_:18481:4) Dropout ratio = 1.05
The recommended setting value of 1.05 is appropriate for most applications. To achieve high measurement
precision, the Dropout ratio can be reduced, to 1.02, for example.
Parameter: Operate delay
•
Default setting (_:18481:6) Operate delay = 3 s
The Operate delay must be set for the specific application.
Parameter: Pickup delay
•
Default setting (_:18481:102) Pickup delay = no
The parameter Pickup delay is only visible if the Current-flow criterion is activated.
With the parameter Pickup delay, you set whether the pickup of the stage is to be delayed by approx. 40
ms or not. The delay avoids possible brief pickup of the stage when the circuit breaker opens.

Parameter Value
Description
no
Use this setting value if you do not want the stage pickup to be subject to
a time delay in case of a fault. This results in pickup and, where applicable,
tripping being performed as fast as possible.
Note that switching procedures such as opening of the circuit breaker
can result in brief pickup of the stage, depending on the threshold-value
settings for the undervoltage pickup and the current criterion. To avoid
unwanted tripping, Siemens recommends a setting value of at least 50 ms
for the parameter Operate delay.
yes
Use this setting value when switching procedures such as opening of the
circuit breaker are not permitted to result in stage pickup.
Note that the pickup is delayed by approx. 40 ms. This delay is added to the
operate time.

can be disabled via the parameter Operate & flt.rec. blocked.

The solution to the thermal differential equation is an e-function in the stationary case, the asymptote of
which represents the final temperature ϑmax. Via the standardization of the model, this corresponds to Θ = 1 or
100 %. The thermal time constant τth for the heating determines the increase over time.
After reaching an adjustable overtemperature threshold Θwarn (thermal warning threshold), a warning
message is released. Θwarn is the standardized thermal warning threshold related to the final temperature,
which occurs with maximum permissible current Imax
When the final temperature is reached at Θ = 1 (100 %), an operate indication is released directly and the
equipment is disconnected from the power system.

The rated current Irated,obj is set to the standardized reference temperature via the Rated current parameter
of the Line CL function group. The reference temperature of the thermal model is 40 °C. If the ambient
temperature is below the reference temperature, the thermal limit changes and the model starts with a
negative overload. In this case, the equipment is more resilient. If the ambient temperature is above the
reference temperature, the model starts with a positive overload.
Due to the thermal warning threshold, a signal is released before the tripping threshold is reached. As a result,
for example, a load can be reduced in good time and switching off can be avoided. In the event of a K factor of
1.1, when there is a continuously flowing rated current, a thermal memory value of 83 % occurs.
Due to the current warning threshold, a signal is released before the overtemperature has reached the
warning or tripping threshold.
The calculation of the temperature during cooling is also carried out via the parameter Thermal time
constant.
If the thermal memory falls below the value set in the Dropout threshold operate parameter, the
Operate signal is canceled.
Thermal Replica for Absolute Thermal Thresholds (Input absol.thermal thresh) = Activated
The protection function works with absolute thermal threshold values.
If the calculated overhead contact line temperature exceeds the value set in the Threshold thermal
warn. parameter, the Thermal warning signal is released.
If the calculated overhead contact line temperature exceeds the value set in the Thermal threshold
operate parameter, the Operate signal is released. If the calculated overhead contact line temperature falls
back below the value set in the Thermal threshold operate parameter, the Operate signal is canceled.
The calculation of the temperature during cooling is also carried out via the parameter Thermal time
constant.
If the overhead contact line temperature falls below the value set in the Therm.thresh.f.switch-on
parameter, the overhead contact lines are switched on again if this is planned and possible.
The parameters K-factor, Catenary 2, and Catenary 3 change the current-carrying capacity of the

Overtemperature of the protected object that occurs with continuous load with the rated
current
Can be set using the parameter Temperature rise at Irated
The rated current Irated,obj is set via the Rated current parameter in the Line CL function group irrespective

Ambient Temperature
The thermal overload protection considers the ambient temperature. The ambient temperature can be meas-
ured or set via the parameter Default temperature. The parameter Minimal temperature limits the
coupled ambient temperature. If the measured ambient temperature is lower than the minimum temperature,
the minimum temperature is processed in the thermal model.
The ambient temperature relates to the overtemperature of the protected object that occurs with rated
current (parameter Temperature rise at Irated).
The ambient temperature can be measured via an external RTD unit (RTD = Resistance Temperature Detector)
and provided via the RTD unit Ether. functions from the Analog units function group. The parameter
Temperature sensor is used to select the appropriate temperature sensor. If the ambient temperature is
available as an analog measurement between 4 and 20 mA, an ANAI-CA-4EL measuring transducer module
can be used for recording. In this case, the measured value is provided to the thermal overload protection
function via a CFC function chart.
[sc_ambient_temperature_cfc, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-102
Function Chart for Provision of the Ambient Temperature
If the temperature measurement is disrupted, e. g. due to an interrupted connection between the device and
RTD unit, the health state of the thermal overload protection function switches to warning. In this case,
operation continues either with the most recently measured temperature or the value set in the parameter
Default temperature. The larger value is used.
Current Influence
The thermal replica based on the single-body model applies with limitations to high overcurrent situations
(short circuits). In order to prevent overfunction of the overload protection, influence the thermal replica in
the event of overcurrents (exceeding of the value set in the parameter Imax thermal). Use one of the
following strategies in order to do this:
•
Freezing of the thermal memory
•
Limitation of the input current for the thermal replica to the set current
This slows down the heating in the event of high currents.

Behavior in the Event of Auxiliary-Voltage Failure
The behavior of the thermal replica in the event of auxiliary-voltage failure can be controlled via the Storage
of thermal replica parameter. You can save the thermal status for a down time of 500 min. When the
supply voltage is restored, the thermal replica continues working with the saved thermal status.
If the thermal replica is not saved, it will be reset to 0 upon failure of the auxiliary voltage.
Resetting the Thermal Replica
You can reset the thermal memory via the binary input indication >Reset thermal replica. The thermal
memory then receives the value for the ambient temperature (measured or specified, depending on the
method for recording the ambient temperature).
Re-parametrization also results in resetting of the thermal memory.
Blocking the Function
Blocking will cause a picked up function to be reset. The function can be blocked externally or internally by
means of the binary input signal >Block stage.
All indications drop out with this. The thermal memory is set to the measured or specified value for the
ambient temperature.
Blocking Closure
The Block close signal can be used in order to prevent the protected object switching on in the event of a
high thermal load.
If the parameter Input absol.thermal thresh is deactivated, the signal is set when exceeding the
tripping overtemperature and canceled when falling below the dropout threshold.
If the parameter Input absol.thermal thresh is activated, the signal is set after exceeding the value
specified in the Therm.thresh.f.switch-on parameter and canceled again after falling below the value.
Catenary Switchover
If the catenary group has a persistent current carrying capacity that depends on the switching state, you can
consider the various current carrying capacities for a maximum of 3 switching states. In this case the catenary
factor CAT 1 is set fixed at 1.0.
You can use the following options for adjusting the thermal model to the current switching state.
•
Via Parameter
•
Via Protocol
•
Via binary input BI
Select the control source using the CAT changeover parameter.
Even if you have not selected the control sources binary input (BI) or Protocol, operation via these control
sources is still possible. The catenary factor set in this way – CAT 1, CAT 2 or CAT 3 – only becomes
effective on switching back to the respective control source (see Figure 6-103).

NOTE
Changing the function parameters resets the thermal model.
Parameter: Mode
•
Default setting (_:1) Mode = off
Use the parameter (_:1) Mode to switch the Thermal Overload Protection function on, off, or into the test
mode (see 2.3 Function Control).
Parameter: Operate & flt.rec. blocked

Use the parameter (_:2) Operate & flt.rec. blocked to define whether a function works as a
protection function or a monitoring function (see 2.3 Function Control).
Parameter: Threshold current warning
•
Recommended setting value (_:101) Threshold current warning = 1.000 A with Irated = 1 A
Set the threshold to the maximum permissible persistent current (Imax, perm). This results in the same setting
value as for K-factor.

Set the warning temperature so that it is above the thermal memory value that occurs with continuously
flowing rated current.
The thermal memory value can be calculated using the following equation.
[fo_thermal_storage_value, 2, en_US]
Examples:
•
In the event of a K-factor of 1.1, a thermal memory value of 83 % occurs.
Leave the parameter as the default value of 90 %.
•
In the event of a K-factor of 1.05, a thermal memory value of 91 % occurs.
Increase the parameter Threshold thermal warn. to 95 %.
Parameter: Threshold thermal warn. for Absolute Thermal Thresholds
•
Recommended setting value (_:128) Threshold thermal warn. = 40 °C
The parameter is only visible if the parameter Input absol.thermal thresh is activated.
Use the parameter Threshold thermal warn. to define the temperature from which a warning signal is
released.
The parameter Threshold thermal warn. depends on the value set in the Thermal threshold
operate parameter and the expected outside temperature or the value set in the Default temperature
parameter.
Parameter: Dropout threshold operate
•
Recommended setting value (_:105) Dropout threshold operate = 90 %
The parameter is only visible if the parameter Input absol.thermal thresh is deactivated.
Use the parameter Dropout threshold operate to define the standardized temperature in percent that
must be fallen below in order to cancel the Pickup and Operate signals.
A percentage value in the order of magnitude of the warning threshold is recommended. You can set a lower
value for special applications, desired additional cooling or longer blocking of switching on.
The calculation of the output signal Time until close relates to this value.
If the overhead contact line was switched off by the thermal overload protection and the Thermal AR function
is active, the overhead contact line is switched on again if the value falls below the threshold set here.

cation and Setting Notes for the Thermal Cyclic Automatic Reclosing Function.
Parameter: K-factor
•
Recommended setting value (_:106) K-factor = 1.1
If the parameter Input absol.thermal thresh is deactivated:
You can use the parameter K-factor to define an overload factor that specifies the limiting value for the
continuous maximum permissible load. The rated current Irated,obj of the protected object overhead contact line
corresponds to the base current for the overload recording with the corresponding parameter Temperature
rise at Irated.
You can define the value of the parameter K-factor using the thermally permissible persistent current
Imax,perm.

NOTE
Thermally Permissible Persistent Current
The thermally permissible persistent current for the protected object can be found in the relevant tables or
the manufacturer’s specifications.
Siemens recommends that you use the default setting, as this is a typical value for many applications. In this
case, a K factor greater than 1.0 results in an absolute tripping temperature above the value specified in the
Temperature rise at Irated parameter.
If the parameter Input absol.thermal thresh is activated:
Use the parameter K-factor to define an overcurrent factor, which changes the continuous maximum
permissible current Irated. This does not affect the setting of the Temperature rise at Irated parameter.
Tripping always takes place with the value set in the Thermal threshold operate parameter.
Parameter: Thermal time constant
•
Recommended setting value (_:110) Thermal time constant = 900 s (15 min)
With the Thermal time constant parameter, you can define the operate curve for the stage. If no time
constant is specified, you can derive this from the other information.
Parameter: Imax thermal
•
Recommended setting value (_:107) Imax thermal = 2.5 A for Irated = 1 A
With the Imax thermal parameter, you can set the current threshold for the Behav. at I> Imax
therm. parameter. Siemens recommends a setting value of 2.5 ‧ Irated,obj.
Parameter: Temperature rise at Irated
•
Recommended setting value (_:109) Temperature rise at Irated = 70 K
If the parameter Input absol.thermal thresh is deactivated:
Use the parameter Temperature rise at Irated to define the temperature that occurs if the equipment
is operated permanently at an ambient temperature of 40 °C with the rated current. In this case, the rated
current refers to the protected object. The temperature value can be found in the technical data of the
equipment or the value can be measured. If you use a temperature sensor when measuring at the rated
current, deduct the current ambient temperature from the measured value.
For the selection of the setting value, you can also orient yourself on the specified temperature classes.
Usually, you will find the temperature expressed in Kelvin (K), which can be accepted as is. If the absolute
temperature is given, the ambient temperature must be deducted. As a rule, this is 40 °C. If this is not the
case, convert the corresponding value to the standardized reference temperature of 40 °C.
The temperature with maximum permitted current (ϑmax) and the temperature at Irated (Temperature rise
at Irated, Δϑrated, obj) are combined together via the following formula.
[fo_k_thetamax_thetanenn, 2, en_US]
If the parameter Input absol.thermal thresh is activated:
Use the parameter Temperature rise at Irated to define the temperature that occurs if the equipment
is operated permanently at the rated current (irrespective of a reference temperature).

Parameter: Temperature sensor
•
Recommended setting value (_:44) Temperature sensor = Setting options depend on
configuration
With the Temperature sensor parameter, you determine which temperature sensor to use to detect the
ambient temperature.
The ambient temperature of the protected object is measured with a temperature sensor and sent to the
device via an RTD unit (Resistance Temperature Detector) or ANAI-CA-4EL analog transducer. The Thermal
overload protection function receives the measured temperature value via the functions RTD unit Ether.,
RTD unit Serial, Temp. Rec. Protocol or via function chart (CFC) from the ANAI-CA-4EL analog transducer
function group.
When using the Temp. Rec. Log function, the stages Temprec.GOOSE or Tmp.systems control are available.
Parameter: Default temperature

Recommended setting value (_:118) Default temperature = 40 °C
If no temperature sensor is connected for measuring the ambient temperature, the value set in the Default
temperature parameter is used for the ambient temperature.
Siemens recommends using the default setting.
Parameter: Minimal temperature
•
Recommended setting value (_:117) Minimal temperature = -20 °C
If the measured ambient temperature drops below the pre-set value, the set value will be assumed as the
ambient temperature. If the overload protection works with a pre-specified outside temperature and this
temperature drops below the value set in the Minimal temperature parameter, the value set in the
Minimal temperature parameter is used.
Parameter: Maximum temperature
•
Recommended setting value (_:119) Maximum temperature = 60 °C
If the temperature sensor supplies a measured value greater than the setting value, the value specified in
the Maximum temperature parameter is used to calculate the thermal replica. This is signaled with the

Circuit-Breaker Failure Protection
Overview of Functions
The Circuit-breaker failure protection function (ANSI 50BF) monitors the tripping of the associated circuit-
breaker (CB) and generates a backup trip signal if the circuit-breaker fails.
The adaptive algorithm enables a faster, more reliable detection of the opening of the circuit breaker in the
event of complex signal histories.
Structure of the Function
The function Circuit-breaker failure protection (CBFP) can be used in the Circuit-breaker function group.
[dw_strbfp, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-104
Structure/Embedding of the Function
Figure 6-105 shows the functionalities and the function control of the function.
The start is initiated by the device-internal protection function or by an external protection. Along with the
start, the current-flow criterion or the circuit-breaker auxiliary contact criterion is used to check whether the
circuit breaker is closed. If the circuit breaker is closed, the function picks up and starts the time delay. During
the time delay, the system continuously checks whether the circuit breaker has opened. If this is the case, the
function drops out. If the circuit breaker is not opened, the function trips upon expiration of the time delay.
The following description elaborates on the detailed functionality of the individual function blocks.

Function Description
The circuit-breaker failure protection function is started by device-internal protection functions and/or exter-
nally (via a binary input or an interface, such as GOOSE). Figure 6-106 and Figure 6-107 show the function-
ality.
Internal Start
By default, each device-internal protection stage that has to control the local circuit breaker starts the circuit-
breaker failure protection. The function is started by the tripping of the protection stage. In the default setting,
the starting signal Internal start (see Figure 6-106) is held when the pickup signal has a falling edge
or the protection function has tripped. The Circuit-breaker failure protection function can in this case only
drop out if the circuit breaker is detected to be open. This is detected using the current flow or circuit-breaker
auxiliary contact criterion. If necessary, the Circuit-breaker failure protection function can also drop out when
the pickup signal has a falling edge or the protection function trips (internal starting signal is not held).
You can use routing to determine whether individual protection stages or protection functions are used as a
starting source or whether the start is only supposed to be external.
The internal starting sources are routed in the protection function groups via the Circuit-breaker interaction
entry.
[lo_anwint, 2, en_US]
Figure 6-106
Internal Start of the Circuit-Breaker Failure Protection Function
External Start
The parameter Start via binary input is used to set whether the external start is initiated by a
1-channel or 2-channel signal. The required routing of the input signals is compared with the setting. If a
routing is missing, an error message is generated. The Health signal changes to the state Warning.

[lo_anwext, 2, en_US]
Figure 6-107
Configuration of the External Start of the Circuit-Breaker Failure Protection Function
In 1-channel operation, the start is initiated with the binary input signal >Start only.
In 2-channel operation, the binary input signal >Release must also be activated to initiate the start. In the
default setting, the starting signal External start drops out immediately when the input signals have a
falling edge (see Figure 6-108). If necessary, the starting signal can be held. In this case the start remains
active when the binary input signals have a falling edge.
The input signals are monitored to avoid an unwanted pickup of the function.
If either of the signals >Start or >Release is active for more than the set monitoring time without the
function being picked up, an error in the binary input circuit is assumed. The corresponding signal is blocked
to exclude an external pickup of the function. An indication to this effect is output, and the ready signal
changes to the state Warning. The blocking is reset as soon as the binary input signal drops out.
The monitoring is disabled in the following cases:
•
On pickup of the Circuit-breaker failure protection function (only in the case of an external start). This
prevents an unwanted pickup of the supervision if the external protection that starts the Circuit-breaker
failure protection function uses a lockout functionality. When the starting signal drops out, the moni-
toring is enabled again.
•
As long as the function or the device is in test mode. This allows to check the function without the
supervision blocking the function.
If the >Start signal is active and no release signal is present after elapse of a settable monitoring time, the
pickup is blocked and an indication to this effect is output. The Health signal changes to the state Warning.
The blocking is reset with the dropout of the starting signal.
The binary input signals only take effect if the binary inputs are activated for at least 10 ms (SW filter, see
Figure 6-108).

Current-Flow Criterion
The current-flow criterion is the primary criterion for determining the circuit-breaker switch position. A circuit-
breaker pole is supposed to be closed, and the current-flow criterion fulfilled, as soon as one of the phase
currents exceeds the phase-current threshold value, and at the same time a plausibility current exceeds the
associated threshold value.

Circuit-Breaker Auxiliary Contact Criterion
Settings allow you to specify whether the circuit-breaker auxiliary contacts are permitted for determining the
circuit-breaker switch position.
The double-point indication Position (from the Circuit-breaker function block) is used to determine whether
the circuit breaker are closed. If the double-point indication is not routed, the output is an error message.
Furthermore, the ready signal changes to the state Warning.
The detection of a static disturbed position (not an intermediate position) has the effect that the circuit-
breaker auxiliary contact criterion is not used (the internal signal Aux.co.crit.: CB Clsd is disabled).
[lo_criter_7ST86, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-110
Circuit-Breaker Auxiliary Contact Criterion
Pickup/Dropout
After the start, a check is performed whether the circuit breaker is closed. The current-flow criterion and the
circuit-breaker auxiliary contact criterion are available for this purpose.
Even if the circuit-breaker auxiliary contact criterion is permitted, preference is given to the fulfilled current-
flow criterion because the current-flow criterion is the most reliable criterion for detecting whether the circuit
breaker is closed. This means that the circuit breaker is deemed to be closed if it is closed according to the
current-flow criterion but at the same time open according to the circuit-breaker auxiliary contact criterion.
If no current is flowing at the start time, the function can only pick up on the basis of the circuit-breaker auxil-
iary contact criterion. For this purpose, the circuit-breaker auxiliary contacts must be permitted as criterion.
When the current begins to flow after the start, the function switches over to the current-flow criterion.
If the circuit breaker is detected as closed and the starting condition is present, the function picks up.
The pickup starts a time delay (see Delay/Tripping). While the delay is running, the system checks continuously
whether the circuit breaker has opened. In the default setting, the opening of the circuit breaker is checked
on the basis of the currently valid criterion, which is normally the current-flow criterion because it is preferred.
If until expiration of the time delay, no current flow above the set threshold values has been detected, the
circuit-breaker auxiliary contact criterion becomes effective.
The function has also a setting in which dropout is only possible if both criteria in parallel detect the circuit
breaker to be open (dropout with auxiliary contact and current-flow criterion).
In the default setting, the internal starting signal is held (see Figure 6-106 and Figure 6-108). This means that
dropout is controlled solely by the current- or the circuit-breaker auxiliary contact criterion. If dropout is also
to occur on the falling edge of the starting signal (that is, when the pickup signal has a falling edge or the
protection function trips), holding of the start signal must be disabled.

Figure 6-111
Pickup/Dropout of the Circuit-Breaker Failure Protection Function
Delay/Tripping
In a first step, tripping at the local circuit breaker can be repeated. Tripping is repeated after expiration of the
settable delay T1. If the local CB was not yet tripped, for example, in the event of an external start of the
circuit-breaker failure protection, the trip logic of the circuit breaker itself is activated when the time delay T1
elapses.
Time delay T2 (backup tripping) can commence in parallel either with the start of time T1 or after expiration of
time T1.
If time delay T2 expires without a dropout of the function, a circuit-breaker failure is assumed and the backup
tripping signal Tripping T2 is output. If there is a protection interface in the device, if needed a transfer-trip
signal can be sent to the opposite end.
If the >CB defect input signal is valid, any repetition of the trip signal is suppressed, and the backup tripping
signal T2 is generated immediately (without delay). The binary input of the >CB defect input signal must be
activated for at least 20 ms before the signal becomes valid.
With help of the CB failure pole indication, you can determine the phase currents that are above the
threshold value at the tripping time T2.
The Minimum operate time parameter defines the minimum duration for tripping the function. In contrast
to other protection functions, the parameter is set within its own function. As a result, the setting is inde-
pendent of the identically named global parameter that is set in the Device settings.

Routing: Configuration of Internal Starting Sources (Internal Protection Function)
Configuration of the internal starting sources takes place in the protection function groups via the Circuit-
breaker interaction entry.
By default, the function can be started by any tripping of the internal protection functions that control
the local circuit breaker. Depending on the specific application, it can be necessary to exclude certain device-
internal protection functions from starting the CBFP.
Where a start exclusively from external sources is required, all internal protection functions must be routed so
that they are excluded as a starting source.

Parameter Value
Description
no
If no external start is intended, the parameter is set to no.
2 channel
2-channel start is used if there is a danger that the circuit-breaker failure protec-
tion causes a tripping due to a faulty activation of the start binary input. This is
the case in the following situations:
•
The CBFP pickup value (threshold value) is set to less than the load current.
•
There may be operating conditions under which the current flow is higher
than the pickup value.
To avoid a possible overfunction, Siemens recommends using the 2-channel
start.
1 channel
The 1-channel start must be used where only one control circuit of a binary
input is available for starting the CBFP.
Input Signals: >Start, >Release
The start and release input signals have a filtering time of 10 ms as default setting. If a transient control signal
to the binary inputs is to be expected due to the design of the external binary-input control circuits and due to
environmental conditions, the filtering time can be extended. This delays the start of the CBFP function.
Eingangssignale
Description
>Start
The start input signal is linked with the tripping of the external protection
device (refer to Figure 6-113).
>Release
The release input signal is normally linked with the pickup of the external
protection device (refer to Figure 6-113). Another common configuration is the
parallel wiring of the external trip initiation to both binary inputs (start and
release).
Parameter: Sup.time f. release signal
•
Default setting (_:111) Sup.time f. release signal = 0.06 s
The setting depends on the external function which generates the release signal. If the pickup or tripping of
the external protection is used as release signal, the default setting can be kept. If it is ensured that the release
signal is always present before the start signal, the time can be set to 0.
Parameter: Holding int. start signal
•
Recommended setting value (_:105) Holding int. start signal = yes
Parameter Value
Description
yes
In the case of an internal start, the start signal is hold by default. The dropout
of the CBFP depends exclusively on the determination of the circuit-breaker
position.
This setting must be selected if it is not ensured that all 2 poles of the CB have
opened when the pickup signal of the protection function has a falling edge.
Siemens recommends using this method as the standard method.
no
Latching of the start signal can be deactivated if it is ensured by the application
that the CB has reliably opened when the start signal has a falling edge. If the
CBFP is explicitly required to drop out when the start signal has a falling edge,
latching of the start signal can also be deactivated.
Parameter: Holding ext. start signal

503
C53000-G5040-C028-2, Edition 07.2024


Parameter Value
Description
no
The CBFP drops out when the external start signal has a falling edge. This
setting prevents the CBFP from generating a tripping signal when an unwanted
pulse is received at the binary input and the current flow is high enough.
Siemens recommends using this method as the standard method.
yes
You can hold the start signal if it is not ensured that the circuit breaker is open
when the external start signal has a falling edge.
EXAMPLE
Holding External Start Signal (Setting Value: Yes)
The function is started from the opposite end via an auxiliary device for command transmission. This device
generates only a signal pulse.
i
i
NOTE
Siemens would like to point out that, with a hold signal, the CBFP generates a trip signal each time a
starting pulse is received and the current flow is high enough. Remember this particularly in the case of an
external start!
Parameter: Threshold phase current
•
Recommended setting value (_:102) Threshold phase current = approx. 0.50 Isc, min
Siemens recommends setting the parameter Threshold phase current to half the minimum short-circuit
current (0.5 Isc, min).
Parameter: CB aux.cont. crit. allowed
•
Recommended setting value (_:103) CB aux.cont. crit. allowed = no
Parameter Value
Description
no
If sufficient current flow is ensured under all conditions with the CB closed,
Siemens recommends not to permit the auxiliary contacts as a further criterion
for determining the CB position, because measurement based on the current
flow is the most reliable criterion.
w. 'CB pos. closed
2p.'
The auxiliary contacts are permitted as a further criterion in applications (see
the following examples) where the current is no reliable criterion for deter-
mining the circuit-breaker position.
EXAMPLES
Applications which Require you to Permit the Circuit-Breaker Auxiliary-Contact Criterion
•
Tripping of the high and low voltage side CB on the transformer: If only one of the 2 CBs trips, there is no
more current flow.
•

combination with low-load situations
•
Injection of the tripping signal from Buchholz protection

eter CB aux.cont. crit. allowed).

Parameter Value
Description
no
Where no redundant CB control is provided, a repetition of the trip signal to the
local CB is not required.
start T2 after T1
Where a redundant CB control (2nd trip coil with 2 trip circuits) is provided, a
repetition of the trip signal to the local CB makes sense.
Siemens recommends the setting start T2 after T1 because it provides
a clear chronological separation of the processes for trip repeat and backup trip-
ping. Remember here that the overall fault-clearance time in case of a failure of
the local CB is the sum of T1 and T2.
parallel start T2,
T1
Alternatively to setting start T2 after T1, you can start T2 and T1 in
parallel.
Parameter: Delay T1 for retrip
•
Default setting (_:109) Delay T1 for retrip = 0.2 s
The parameter is visible only when the repetition of tripping is set.
Parameter: Delay T2 for trip
•
Default setting (_:110) Delay T2 for trip = 0.4 s
This setting has to ensure that after opening of the local CB the function drops out reliably and that backup
tripping is avoided under all circumstances. The setting depends on the parameter Retrip after T1.
If T2 is started after T1, there is no need to consider the time T1 for the setting of T2. If T1 and T2 are started
in parallel, you must consider the time T1 when setting T2.
Input Signal: >CB defect
The input signal >CB defect has a default filtering time of 20 ms. This filtering time prevents the input
signal from becoming effective in the case of a transient activation of the physical binary input, which can be
caused by the pressure change when the CB opens.
This time can be set to 0 if such a transient pickup of the physical binary input can be excluded due to the CB
design.
Output Signal: Retrip after T1
The output signal Retrip after T1 must explicitly be routed to a binary output.
If only 1 control circuit is available for the local circuit breaker, the output signal must be routed to the binary
output to which the general command for tripping the CB (command Position) is routed.
If a 2nd control circuit is present, the Retrip after T1 output signal must be routed to the associated
binary output.
Output Signal: Trip T2
For operational handling of the adjacent circuit breakers, the backup tripping (indication Trip T2) must be
routed to a binary output; and if necessary, to an interface (intertripping to opposite end).

Parameter: Minimum operate time
•
Default setting (_:112) Minimum operate time = 0.15 s
If a blocking signal is present, the picked-up function is reset. With the parameter Minimum operate time,
you define how long the tripping indication is hold.
In contrast to most of the protection functions, the parameter is set within the own function. Thus, the setting
is independent from the overall parameter with the same name which is located in the Device settings.
!
CAUTION
Do not set a too short time.
If you set a time that is too short for tripping, there is a risk (dropout of the function without the
current-flow criterion) that the device contacts will interrupt the control loop. If this happens, the
device contacts will burn out.
²
Set a time period that is long enough to ensure that the circuit breaker reliably reaches the end
position Open after a control operation.

Defrosting Protection
Overview of Functions
To defrost icy contact lines, unused contact lines are connected in series and possibly heated with a low
current via a resistor.
To ensure reliable detection of short-circuits even during defrosting, the device measures the supply and
return flow of current and monitors the differential current. The differential protection covers 100 % of the
measuring range. The differential-protection characteristic curve can be parameterized.
Structure of the Function
The function Defrosting protection can be added in the function group Contact line.

Function Description

NOTE
When defrosting, the contact line is in a special switching state. If you use the function Defrosting
protection, all the other protection functions remain active. The defrosting current can cause overfunc-
tions or failures in one or more protection functions, for example, through the voltage protection or
a distance-protection reserve zone. Deactivate the corresponding protection functions before using the
function Defrosting protection and switching on the defrosting current. For example, use the settings
group switching via a binary input or the system interface.
In defrost mode, the contact line must be in a special switching state. The following figure shows an example.
The switches QA1 (contact line 1), QB11, and QB9 are closed, and the switch QA1 (contact line 2) is open.

Figure 6-115
Defrosting protection According to the Differential-Protection Principle - Simplified Functional
Diagram
In addition to the current transformer used by the other protection functions in the contact-line infeed I,
another current transformer is required for the return flow of the defrosting current. This transformer is
connected to the input Ix.
i
i
NOTE
In auto-transformer systems, the negative-feeder current (InF) is also recorded. If the negative-feeder
current is measured by a separate current transformer, this current can be ignored as the current in the
special switching state for defrosting is very low.
Protection Principle
The function Defrosting protection operates on the differential-protection principle. This means that when
the line is healthy, the 2 measured currents are the same in terms of phase and amplitude and the condition
i(t) + ix(t) = 0 is always met.
If different transformers are used to record the currents i(t) and ix(t), this must be considered when calcu-
lating the current sum.

The measured current ix(t) is adapted to the ratios of i(t) as follows:
Where:
Due to measuring errors, the current sum i(t) + ix(t) = 0 is not exactly 0 in a healthy state. Therefore, a value
greater than 0 is set for the pickup threshold. The differential current is greater for a high load current than for
a low load current. Therefore, the pickup threshold depends on the load. The restraint current Irest is calculated
as follows:
The restraint current is a measurement of the present load. The pickup threshold is applied as a function of the
restraint current.
The differential current Idiff is calculated from the measured currents as follows:
Characteristic Curve
The characteristic curve is defined by the parameters Threshold and K-factor.
The position of the present operating point in the Idiff/Irest plane is used as the pickup criterion. If the calculated
value is above the characteristic curve shown in the following figure, the function picks up.
[dw_dif-kennlinie, 1, en_US]

Characteristic Curve of the Differential Protection for Defrosting
Threshold
Pickup value for differential current Idiff
K-factor
Characteristic-curve gradient
The parameters Threshold and K-factor determine the break point of the characteristic curve. The setting
value for the parameter Threshold is derived from the differential-mode currents that can arise in healthy
states independently of the defrosting current. Capacitive leakage currents or magnetization currents from
transformers in the protection range lead to these differential-mode currents. The setting value for the charac-
teristic-curve gradient is derived from the possible amplitude or angle errors in the used current transformers.

is reduced by resistances in the current path.

Inrush-Current Detection
Overview of Functions
The function Inrush-current detection
•
Recognizes an inrush process on transformers
•
Generates a blocking signal for protection functions that are affected in undesirable ways when trans-
formers are switched on
•
Allows a sensitive setting of the protection functions
The following protection functions evaluate the blocking signal
•
Overcurrent protection with a pickup value below the maximum inrush current
•
Distance protection for impedance stages graded through the transformer
Structure of the Function
The function Inrush-current detection is not an individual protection function. In the connection process of
a transformer, it transmits a blocking signal to other protection functions. For this reason, the inrush-current
detection must be in the same function group as the functions that are to be blocked.
The following figure shows the embedding of the function. The setting parameter Blk. w. inrush curr.
detect. establishes the connection between inrush-current detection and the functions that are to be
blocked. If the parameter is set to yes, the connection is effective.
A jump detection or the threshold value exceeding of the functions to be blocked is used as trigger signal for
synchronization of the internal measurement methods.
The jump detection reacts to changes in the current. The threshold value exceeding is recognized due to an
internal pickup of the protection function that is to be blocked.

For this method of measurement, the content of the 2nd harmonic and the fundamental component (1st
harmonic) are determined for each of the phase currents IA, IB, and IC and the quotient I2nd harm / I1st harm is
formed from this. If this quotient exceeds the set threshold value, a phase-selective signal is issued.
If 75 % of the set threshold value is exceeded, this leads to a pickup reset (dropout ratio = 0.75).

Fault Locator
Overview of Functions
The function Fault locator serves for measuring the fault distance in case of a short circuit.
The fast determination of fault location and the associated fast fault clearing increase the availability of the
contact line. Determining the fault location is based on the loop-impedance calculation of short-circuited
measuring loops.
Structure of the Function
The function Fault locator is used in the protection function group Contact line.
[dwstfo2pfl-220505-01, 1, en_US]
Figure 6-122
Structure/Embedding of the Function
The following line sections can be instantiated simultaneously in the function Fault locator:
•
Maximum of 10 line sections in forward direction
•
Maximum of 10 line sections in reverse direction
The detection of contact-line currents and voltages is a prerequisite for the calculation of fault locations.
If the fault locator is used in auto-transformer systems, you also need the negative-feeder current. The
negative-feeder voltage is optional. The function Fault locator contains all necessary control parameters.
The fault-location determination starts only if the functions Distance protection, Overcurrent protection,
or Directional overcurrent protection have picked up or tripped. Irrespective of this, you can also start the
fault-location determination externally via a binary input signal.
Function Description
Starting Conditions
The fault locator is an independent function with its own measurand memory and filter algorithms. To
define the most favorable time interval for saving the measurand, only a start command by the short-circuit
protection is required. The fault locator can be started by tripping of the short-circuit protection or also at each
dropout.
Even if a different protection device disconnects the short circuit, fault-location determination is possible for
every pickup. If there is a fault outside the line to be protected, the fault-location indication can be inaccurate,
because the measurands can be falsified, for example by the intermediate infeed, and the line parameters are
unknown.
The fault locator can also be started externally via a binary input or via tripping by the teleprotection add-on.
If there is no loop pickup at the time of the external starting signal or of the internal trip signal of the
teleprotection add-on, the fault locator is not started.

No fault location is calculated in the following cases:
•
As long as there is an operate indication from the function Thermal overload protection
•
The function Fault locator is blocked by an input signal via a binary input.
Fault-Location Determination
The recorded sampled values of the short-circuit currents and voltages are saved shortly after the starting
condition. The short-circuit affected data window is limited by the corresponding time stamp of the triggering,
since no fault in the measured value has then occurred through the switch-off process, even in the case of
very fast circuit breakers. The measured values are filtered automatically and the impedances are calculated. If
it is not possible to determine a sufficient data window with usable measured values, the function signals the
invalid measuring result with the indication FLO invalid.
After the start of the fault locator, the function analyzes the measured values and calculates the fault location.
If the short circuit is disconnected, analysis of the measurands starts. The function Fault locator calculates
R and X according to the line equation using the saved and filtered measurands. The calculated X value
corresponds to the fault reactance and is proportional to the fault distance.
For the function Fault locator, up to 10 line sections can be defined, including a cable section at the start,
for the forward and reverse directions with different reactances per unit length. A fault-location determination
is therefore also possible for inhomogeneous lines, with the individual line sections assumed to be homoge-
neous. Transformers can be incorporated into the fault-location determination by parameterizing the line
section belonging to the transformer reactance with the length d = 0.
The following figure shows an example of how the fault distance can be calculated from the fault reactance
determined by the fault-location determination.

NOTE
Transformers can be incorporated into the fault-location determination by parameterizing the line section

i
i
NOTE
The accuracy of the fault locator as specified in the technical data applies to faults with a sufficiently
long measurement window for calculating the fault location. In case of a high-speed tripping, the short
fault-clearing time with a high proportion of harmonics in the measured current and voltage signals can
cause fault location to be less accurate.
Manual or External Start of the Fault-Location Determination
Depending on the setting of the parameter Start of the fault locator, the following behavior applies to the
start of the function via the binary input:
•
If you select the setting value with going pickup, activating the binary input >Flt. det. w/o
phs.&gnd. is enough to start the fault locator.
•
If you select the setting value with operate, you must also activate the binary input >Fault
locator start.
This makes it possible to determine whether there is just a pickup or also a disconnection, even in case of an
external start.
Output of the Fault Location
The following results for the fault location are output:
•
The fault reactance X in Ω primary and secondary
•
The fault resistance R in Ω primary and secondary
•
The fault distance (d) of the line proportional to the reactance in kilometers or miles, converted on the
basis of the parameterized reactance per unit length of the line
•
The fault distance d as a percentage of the line length, calculated on the basis of the parameterized
reactances per unit length and parameterized line lengths of the individual line sections
•
The defined line section
If the function Fault locator cannot calculate any fault impedance, the indication FLO invalid is sent.
i
i
NOTE
If the fault reactance is negative, the fault is in the reverse direction.
You can also use the reactance calculated by fault location for the separate calculation of the fault distance
in the following cases: If the fault is in the reverse direction or the calculated fault distance goes beyond
the end of the line. In this case, the fault distance is not calculated in kilometers and as a percentage value,
and the information is marked as out of range.
i
i
NOTE
If the function Fault locator is instantiated, the fault locator determines the direction and the distance
protection. The results of the 2 procedures can differ from one another in rare borderline cases. The
direction determination of the fault locator can be more accurate due to the longer measurement window.
Fault-Location Determination for Auto-Transformer Systems
If the device is used in an auto-transformer system, a sufficiently accurate determination of the fault location
from the measured reactance and a specified reactance per unit length is no longer possible, because the

progression of the reactance along the fault distance is no longer linear. With the fault-location determination
for auto-transformer systems, the calculation of the fault location and a determination of the fault type are
also possible in this case.
To use this function, the measurands for auto-transformer systems must be connected to the device. The fault
location cannot be determined without separate measurement of the contact-line current and negative-feeder
current.
2 variants are available for determining the fault location:
•
Calculation of the fault location from the summation current IPF+INF
•
Separate calculation of the fault location for the contact line and the feeder line
Calculation of the Fault Location from the Summation Current IPF+INF
For the auto-transformer system, the short-circuit impedance is determined in the same way as for the
distance protection, using the contact-line voltage (VCL-rail) and the sum of the contact-line current (ICF) and
negative-feeder current (INF). The imaginary part of the impedance Z is analyzed to calculate the fault location.

The reactance and current curves for both fault types in the device are approximated with characteristic curve
parameters using at least 3 points within a line section.
Separate Determination of Fault Location for Contact Line and Negative Feeder
The fault location can be determined separately for the contact line and the negative feeder. You must then
instantiate a separate function Fault locator for each line. The progression of the measured reactance X
along the fault distance is not linear here, too. Siemens recommends determining the reactance curve using a
simulation and setting the curve using the characteristic curve parameters for each auto-transformer section.

NOTE
Do not select this option if the first line section does not have a negative feeder! In this case, only the
contact-line current can be determined. In this case, a separate consideration of the negative feeder is not
possible.

If a pickup signal of the protection functions designated for the start has
dropped out, the fault-location determination starts.
with operate
If one of the protection functions designated for start has reported the
tripping and the pickup has dropped out, the fault-location determination
starts.
As an alternative, the fault locator can be started using external binary input.
Parameter: Use AT Charact.
•
Default setting Use AT Charact. = check mark set
The parameter Use AT Charact. is only relevant for auto-transformer systems. If you set the check mark,
you can define a reactance curve and a current curve with from 2 to a maximum of 5 reference points per
line section. The curve you define depends on the setting value for the parameter Phase selection of
CL/nF.
You can instantiate a maximum of 10 line sections in the forward direction and 10 line sections in the reverse
direction.
The progression of the measured reactance X along the fault distance is not linear. Siemens recommends
determining the reactance curve using a simulation and setting the curve using the characteristic curve
parameters per auto-transformer section.

Application and Setting Notes
The function requires the following line data to calculate fault distance from fault impedance:
•
Reactance per unit length of the line per kilometer or per mile
•
Line length for the correct output of the fault distance as a percentage of the line length
•
For auto-transformer systems: Reactance curve and current curve per auto-transformer section
Line Section Parameters
You can instantiate a maximum of 10 line sections in the forward direction and 10 line sections in the reverse
direction. Depending on the setting value of the parameter Use AT Charact., the following parameters are
visible per line section:
•
Default setting (_:2311:131) Use AT Charact. = check mark not set
If you are not using the AT characteristic curve, set the following parameters per line section:
–
(_:16921:113) X per length unit
–
(_:16921:114) Line length
–
(_:16921:108) Line angle
•
Default setting (_:2311:131) Use AT Charact. = check mark set
If you are using the AT characteristic curve and the setting value of the parameter is (_:2311:130)
Phase selection of CL/nF = Pos. + Neg. Feeder, set the following parameters per line
section:
–
(_:16921:122) Reactance curve CL
–
(_:16921:123) Reactance curve nF
–
(_:16921:124) Current curve for CL
–
(_:16921:125) Current curve for nF
Parameter: X per length unit
•
Default setting (_:16921:113) X per length unit = 0 Ω/km
Set the reactance per unit length in ohm/km for the line section. Transformers can be incorporated into the
fault-location determination by parameterizing the line section belonging to a transformer reactance with the
length d = 0, refer to Figure 6-123.
Parameter: Line length
•
Default setting (_:16921:114) Line length = 60.00 km
Set the length of the line section in km or miles, depending on the defined unit of measurement. If the section
is not required, set 0 km here.
Parameter: Line angle
•
Default setting (_:16921:108) Line angle = 85.00°
Calculate the setting value for the parameter Line angle from the line constants for the line to be protected
as follows:

Default setting (_:16921:125) Current curve for nF = 5
Siemens recommends determining the reactance and current curves using a simulation. Set the curves per line
section with the characteristic curve parameters.
Using the characteristic curve parameters, you define the reactance or current curve per line section across at
least 2 and up to a maximum of 5 points, refer to Figure 6-124 and Figure 6-125.
The reactance-curve points are defined via value pairs d [km]/X sec.[Ω].
The current-curve points are defined via value pairs d [km]/I[A].
The first point is at the beginning of the line section and the last point is at the end of the line section. Select
the points in between so that there is sufficient distance between the start and end of the line section. The
points do not have to be evenly distributed along the line section. The analysis of the characteristic curves
involves interpolation between the points, meaning that it makes sense to have a higher point density in
sections with a greater change in gradient. Each line section is considered separately and always starts with d
[km] = 0.
i
i
NOTE
Keep in mind that the points must lie within the section and the distance d always relates to the respective
line section.
i
i
NOTE
If the reactance curve is particularly flat, precise fault-location determination in these sections is not
possible. The smallest measuring errors in the reactance here lead to major deviations in fault distance.
If the reactance curves are almost even or the current curves are very flat, it is impossible to differentiate
between the fault types contact line – rail and negative feeder – rail in the sections. This effect occurs
mainly at the end of the line if the fault currents decrease.

Instantaneous Tripping at Switch onto Fault
Overview of Functions 
The Instantaneous tripping at switch onto fault function serves for immediate tripping when switching onto
a fault.
The function does not have its own measurement and must be linked to another protection function with the
pickup (measurement).
Structure of the Function
The function Instantaneous tripping at switch onto fault can be used in in the function group Line. The
function is preconfigured with 1 stage. A maximum of 2 tripping stages can be operated simultaneously
within the function. The tripping stages have an identical structure.

[lo_gisotf, 2, en_US]
Figure 6-127
Logic Diagram of the Stage Instantaneous Tripping at Switch onto Fault
Connection of the Stage
The stage is intended to initiate instantaneous tripping when switching onto a fault. To do this, the stage must
be connected to one or more pickups from protection functions or protection stages, for example, to pickup
of an overcurrent-protection stage. That is, the stage of the Instantaneous tripping at switch onto fault
function does not have its own measuring function but requires the pickup of another protection function or
protection stage to pick up.
The stage is active only if switching is pending or executed (refer to 6.9.1 Overview of Functions ).
i
i
NOTE
If a protection stage picks up and tripping is blocked by the Inrush-current detection function, the
Instantaneous tripping at switch onto fault function does not pick up. In this case there is no fault
recording either.
Despite this, if a fault recording is necessary, you can activate it with the parameter (_:114) Start
flt.rec of the Inrush-current detection function (refer to 6.17 Inrush-Current Detection).

The Configuration parameter is used to define the pickup of a protection function or protection stage that
the Instantaneous tripping at switch onto fault function uses to respond.
Normally, the pickups of protection functions and stages with high fault current are selected:
•
Distance protection
•
Overcurrent protection
•
Directional overcurrent protection
A specific protection stage is generally used. This can be one of the protection stages provided for the
protection application, which itself trips with a delay. An additional protection stage with settings optimized
for this use case, for example, increased threshold value and blocking of self-tripping, can also be used.
Parameter: Operate delay
•
Recommended setting value (_:5941:6) Operate delay = 0.00 s
When switching onto a fault, the tripping should usually be instantaneous. The tripping delay is therefore set
to 0.

Introduction
Overview
The SIPROTEC 5 series of devices offers powerful command processing capability as well as additional func-
tions that are needed when serving as bay controllers for the substation automation technology or when
providing combi-protection. The object model for the devices is based on the IEC 61850 standard, making
the SIPROTEC 5 series of devices ideally suited for use in systems employing the IEC 61850 communication
protocol. In view of the function blocks necessary for the control functions, other logs are also used.
Concept of Controllables
The concept of so-called controllables is based on the data model described in IEC 61850. Controllables are
objects that can be controlled, such as a switch with feedback. The model of a transformer tap changer, for
example, contains controllables. The controllables are identifiable by their last letter C of the data type (for
example, DPC = Double Point Controllable/Double Command with feedback or BSC = Binary-Controlled Step
Position Indication / transformer tap command with feedback).

The trip, opening, and the close commands are connected to the relays. For the trip command, a choice
between saved and unsaved output is possible. The position is connected with 2 binary inputs (double-point
indication). In addition, signals are available that display the current state of the switch (not selected, off,
on, intermediate position, disturbed position). These signals can be queried in CFC, for example, in order to
build interlocking conditions.

Control
It is the task of the controls to execute command checks and establish communication between the command
source and the circuit breaker. Using the control settings, you specify how the commands are to be processed
(see also chapter 7.4.1 Command Checks and Switchgear Interlocking Protection).
Through the function SBO (Select Before Operate, reservation22), the switching device is reserved prior to the
actual switching operation, thus it remains locked for additional commands. Feedback monitoring provides
information about the initiator of the command while the command is in process, that means, informing
whether or not the command was implemented successfully. These 2 options can be selected individually in
the selection of the control model, so that 4 combinations in total are available (see the following table).
The control makes the following settings available (see next table).

In the information routing of DIGSI 5, you may select a function key as a possible command source. In
addition, it is displayed here if the command is activated by CFC. The logging is routed here.
Connection Variants of the Circuit Breaker
For each switching device, you can establish the number of poles (for example, 2-pole) that are switched with
or without feedback. This results in the necessary amount of information to be processed, thus establishing
the command type.
Whether the circuit breaker is triggered 2-pole, depends on the design of the auxiliary and control-voltage
system. In most cases, the activation of the opening coil of the circuit breaker is 1-pole.

Disconnector Switching Device
Structure of the Disconnector Switching Device
Like the circuit breaker, the Disconnector switching device contains the following 3 function blocks:
•
Function block Disconnector
•
Function block Control
•
Function block Interlocking
This corresponds to the logical nodes XSWI, CSWI, and CILO in IEC 61850.

NOTE
In contrast to the Circuit-breaker switching device, the Disconnector switching device cannot contain
any additional functions because protection functions or synchronization can have no effect on the discon-
nector.

in 7.2.3.3 Trigger Variants of the Disconnector. The Control function block is described identically as the
Circuit-breaker function block, with the exception that the command check blocking is available through
protection only with the circuit breaker.
You can find more detailed information on this in 7.2.2.2 Application and Setting Notes.
Interlocking
The Interlocking function block generates the releases for switchgear interlocking protection. The actual
interlocking conditions are deposited in CFC. Also refer to 7.4.1 Command Checks and Switchgear Interlocking

Application and Setting Notes
Disconnector
The disconnector represents the physical switch in the SIPROTEC 5 device. The task of the disconnector is to
replicate the switch position from the status of the binary inputs.
The Disconnector function block is linked automatically via the information matrix with the binary inputs that
register the switch position and with the binary outputs that issue the switching commands.
The Disconnector function block makes the following settings available (see next table).

It is the task of the controls to execute command checks and establish communication between the command
source and the disconnector. Using the control settings, you specify how the commands are to be processed
(see also chapter 7.4.1 Command Checks and Switchgear Interlocking Protection).
Through the function SBO (Select Before Operate, reservation24), the switching device is reserved prior to the
actual switching operation, thus it remains locked for additional commands. Feedback monitoring provides
information about the initiator of the command while the command is in process, that means, informing
whether or not the command was implemented successfully. These two options can be selected individually in
the selection of the control model, so that 4 combinations in total are available (see the following table).
The control makes the following settings available (see next table).

Trigger Variants of the Disconnector
The activation types are identical to those for the circuit breaker. The meaning of abbreviations can be found
in 7.2.2.3 Connection Variants of the Circuit Breaker and 7.2.2.3 Connection Variants of the Circuit Breaker.
Whether the disconnector is triggered for 1-, or 2-phases depends on the design of the auxiliary and control
voltage system.

Switching Sequences
Overview of Functions
Switching sequences may be running inside the device that switch the switchgear automatically in a prespeci-
fied sequence.
A switching sequence consists of a special function block Switching sequence (Swi. seq.) from the DIGSI 5
Library and the project-specific list of the switching commands that are generated in the CFC.
Function Description
The function block Switching sequence is located in folder User-defined functions in the DIGSI 5 Library.
[sc_udeffb, 1, en_US]
Figure 7-16
Function Block Switching Sequence in the Library
These function blocks can be used in the information matrix on the highest level (level of the function groups)
or in a user-defined function group.
One Switching sequence function block is used per switching sequence. The function block is the interface
for controlling and monitoring the condition of the CFC switching sequence. The task of the function block
is to verify the relative conditions for control commands, for example, switching authority, interlocking
conditions, etc. You can connect the signals of the function block with the CFC chart. They start and stop the
switching sequence and provide data about the status of the switching sequence (see Figure 7-17). The CFC
chart is used to activate the switching device that must be switched. The CFC blocks define, among other
things, the switching devices that must be switched.

Settings of the Switching Sequence Function Block
Parameter: Check switching authority
•
Default setting (_:101) Check switching authority = yes
With the Check switching authority parameter, you can determine whether the switching authority
should be checked before the execution of the switching sequence.
Parameter: Check double activat. blk.
•
Default setting (_:102) Check double activat. blk. = yes
With the Check double activat. blk. parameter, you can determine whether the double activation
of switching devices should be checked. The setting value yes indicates that a switching sequence will
be started only if no switching commands for a circuit breaker and disconnector are active, provided that
double-activation blocking was activated for those switching devices.
Parameter: Time-out monitoring
With the Time-out monitoring parameter, you can determine whether the feedback from the process
should be evaluated. The feedback is gathered via the inputs >Successful and >Failed.
Parameter: Monitoring time
•
Default setting (_:104) Monitoring time = 30.00 s
With the Monitoring time parameter, you can determine the duration of the monitoring time.

Default setting (_:105) Control model = SBO w. normal secur.
With the Control model parameter, you select between direct w. normal secur. or SBO w.
normal secur. to start the switching sequence.
It is not possible to set a control model for cancelation of the switching sequence. The control model direct
w. normal secur. is always used to cancel the function.
Information
The Switching sequence function block provides the following data:
[sc_infof1, 1, en_US]
Figure 7-20
Data Provided by the Switching Sequence Function Block
In the Switching sequence function block, the interlocking is analog to the Interlocking function block and it
is possible to use it in the switching sequence:
•
>Enable start: Connection to interlocking conditions (CFC) for the start of the entire switching
sequence. Not in effect in the non-interlocked switching mode.
•
>Enable start (fixed): Non-revocable interlocking conditions for the start of the entire switching
sequence. In effect regardless of the switching mode.
If the time-out monitoring is activated (parameter Time-out monitoring), the process feedback must take
place via the inputs >Successful and >Failed. If the last switching command of the switching sequence
was executed successfully, the input >Successful usually is set. To do this, connect the feedback of the last
switching command from the CFC with this input of the function block during the device parameterization.
If a switching command fails, this feedback can be captured by the input >Failed. The active switching
sequence will be ended immediately and does not have to wait for a time-out.
The indication Execution signals the current state of the switching sequence. The events running,
canceled, failed, and successful are generated only while the time-out monitoring is activated. The
event Start Trigger is used to start the switching sequence in the CFC chart.
Example for a Switching Sequence with CFC

Command Execution
As described in section Starting and Canceling a Switching Sequence, Page 559, the display page or the
Control menu can be used to start the switching sequence. The Start Trigger signal for indication
Execution is used to recognize the start and initiates the switching sequence by pickup of TRIG in the
DPC-DEF building block of circuit breaker QA1. Building blocks DPC-DEF and DPC-EXE are always used in pairs.
The DEF building block controls the type and nature of the command
•
VAL = Switching direction (0 = Off, 1 = On)
•
SELECT = Select switching device (2 = Select with a value suitable for the preset control model SBO w.
enh. security)
•
OPERATE = Switch switching device (1 = Switching device is switched on or off)
Using the connected DPC-EXE building block, the command checks can be deactivated (REL_...). In the
application example, all inputs are set to 0 and therefore, all checks are activated.
After the open command of circuit breaker QA1 is acknowledged via the auxiliary contacts, the OK output of
the CFC block DPC_EXE becomes active and triggers the next switching object. With the input PT the signal
for the OK output is time-delayed (in the example by 10 ms) and creates a dead time between individual
switching commands and the switching sequence. This dead time is important for the updating of the
interlocking conditions.
If QB1 is closed, QB1 will be opened. If QB2 is closed, QB2 will be opened. In order to implement this logic, the
OK output signal of QA1 is linked with the respective positions of circuit breakers QB1 and QB2 via the logical
AND function. This signal serves as a trigger for the trip command of QB1 or QB2.
Because in this example the time-out monitoring is activated, the feedback about the successful or unsuc-
cessful execution of the switching sequence must be parameterized. The Switching sequence function block
provides the inputs >Successful and >Failed. In order to acknowledge the entire switching sequence
positively, the OR operation of the OK outputs for the disconnectors QB1 and QB2 is sufficient. The feedback
of all failed executions takes place via the OR operation of all ERR outputs of the switching devices. The
benefit of such assessment is the fact that, in case of a failure, waiting for the time-out is not necessary, but
the active switching sequence can be ended immediately.
In this example, the use of the EN_I input of building block DPC-DEF fulfills 2 tasks:
•
Cancelation of the entire switching sequence
•
Resetting of the outputs OK and ERR on building block DPC-EXE
By linking all EN_I inputs and EN_O outputs of building blocks DPC-DEF and DPC-EXE, the execution of the
switching sequence can be controlled centrally since the value is transmitted between the building blocks.
Only if input EN_I on the DPC-EXE is set to 1, a switching command is issued. If the input drops back to 0 while
a command is being processed, this command will be canceled. With this behavior, cancelation of an entire
switching sequence can be achieved. As recognition of a cancelation, the canceled signal of the indication
Execution is used in the CFC chart and connected with the input EN_I of the first switching device, in this
example, with the DPC-DEF building block of circuit breaker QA1.
Since the OK and ERR outputs of the DPC-EXE building block maintain their value until execution of the next
command, it is necessary to reset the continuous output after each execution of the switching sequence for
correct execution of the entire CFC switching sequence multiple times. In this case, the use of the EN_I input
is also helpful. In the input drops back to 0, the OK and ERR outputs are also reset to 0. The triggers for ending
the switching sequence are the events failed and successful. For this reason, in the above example, the
signals failed and successful of the indication Execution were connected with EN_I of the DPC-DEF
building block.

Command Checks and Switchgear Interlocking Protection
Before switching commands can be issued by the SIPROTEC 5 device, several steps are used to check the
command:
•
Switching mode (interlocked/non-interlocked)
•
Switching authority (local/DIGSI/station/remote)
•
Switching direction (set=actual)
•
Bay interlocking and substation interlocking
•
1-out-of-n check (double-activation blocking)
•
Blocking by protection function
Confirmation IDs (with Inactive RBAC)
SIPROTEC 5 devices can operate using role-based access control (RBAC). If RBAC is active in the device, the
authorizations to execute various actions are linked directly to the role concept.
If RBAC is inactive in the device, various actions are secured using the confirmation IDs. The following
confirmation IDs from the Safety menu apply to the control functions:

If you have configured a device with key switches, the confirmation IDs for non-interlocked switching and
switching authority are not displayed or editable in DIGSI; the function is handled by the position of the key
switch.
To increase security, change these codes with DIGSI.
Switching Mode (Interlocked/Non-Interlocked)
The switching mode determines whether or not the switchgear interlocking that has been configured in the
CFC is checked before the command is output.
You can change the switching mode with the key switch S1 (interlocking off/normal). For devices without a
key switch, you can change the switching mode with a corresponding menu item on the display (after input
of a confirmation ID). You can also set the switching mode for switching commands from the sources DIGSI,
station or remote.
!
DANGER
If the switching mode = non-interlocked, the switchgear interlocking protection is shut off.
Erroneous switching operations can lead to severe or fatal injuries.
²
Ensure manually that all checks have been implemented.
In addition, you can set the switching mode directly with a binary input or CFC. Use the General function
block (see next figure).

Switching Authority
The switching authority determines which command source is allowed. The following command sources are
possible:
•
Local:
A switching command from the local control (cause-of-error source Local) is possible only if the
switching authority is set to Local and the device is capable of on-site operation. Setting the switching
authority to Local is typically accomplished with key switch S5 (Local/Remote). In this case, commands
from all other sources are rejected. If the switching authority is set to Local, the setting cannot be
changed remotely.
•
DIGSI:
A switching command from DIGSI (connected via USB or Ethernet, cause-of-error source Maintenance)
is accepted only if the switching authority in the device is set to Remote. Once DIGSI has signed on the
device for command output, no commands from other command sources or a different DIGSI PC will be
executed.
•
Station:
This switching authority level can be activated via a parameter in the General function block. A switching
command from the station level (cause-of-error source Station or Automatic station) is accepted if the
switching authority is set to Remote and the controllable Station switching authority is set. This is
accomplished by a command from the substation automation technology. Switching commands from
the device or from outside the station (cause-of-error source Local, Remote or Automatic remote) are
rejected.
Full support of the switching-authority level is assured only when using the IEC 61850 protocol.
•
Remote:
This switching authority level stands from remote control directly from the network control center or (if
the switching authority level Station is not activated) generally for Remote control. The cause-of-error
source is Automatic remote. Commands from this level are accepted if the switching authority is set
to Remote and the controllable Station switching authority is not set. Switching commands from the
device or from the station (cause-of-error source Local, Station or Automatic station) are rejected.

Display of Switching Authority and Switching Mode in Information Routing (in Function Block
General)
Sw. authority key/set and Sw.mode key/set indicate the current state of the key switch or parameter for
switching authority or switching mode and provide this information for further processing in the CFC. In
the CFC, for example, it is possible to set up an automatic routine to ensure that the switching authority is
automatically set to Local when the key switch is set to non-interlocked.
The following table shows the dependency of the switching mode on the key-switch position and the
switching authority. In the case of switching commands from Remote, the information on whether switching
is to be made to locked or unlocked is also sent. For this reason, the position of the key switch is irrelevant for
the switching mode in these cases. The information in the table assumes that, in the case of remote switching
commands or those from the station, the switching mode is interlocked in each case.

The signals shown in Figure 7-25 in DIGSI 5 information routing have the following relationship:
•
In terms of switching authority and switching mode, the respective key switch position serves as the
input signal and the input signals in the matrix.
•
The state of the switching authority and switching mode is indicated by corresponding output signals.
•
The Switching authority and Switching mode functions link the input signals and in this way establish
the output signals (see Figure 7-26 and Figure 7-27).

In the case of both functions, the input signals overwrite the state of the key switch. This allows external
inputs to also set the switching authority or switching mode, if desired (for instance, by querying an external
key switch).

Specific Switching Authority
Special switching authorities can be configured as extension of the switching-authority check. This makes it
possible to differentiate the Remote command sources at the bay level. Switching authority can be routed
to or revoked from different control centers that can, for example, belong to different companies. Thus,
precisely one of these command sources can switch at a certain time. This function is based on extending
the switching-authority check by verifying the identifier of the command source (field Originator/orIdent of
switching command). In order to turn on the function, go to General/Control and set the check mark for
the parameter Specific sw. authorities. More settings for the configuration of the identifiers and the
behavior of the function as well as additional signals appear (see Figure 7-30). In order to permit an additional
command source to switch, you must activate this specific switching authority. In order to do this, set the
controllable Enable sw. auth. 1 to Enable sw. auth. 5.

In a standard case, the functionalities switching authority, switching mode, and specific switching authority
as described in the previous sections, are applicable to the entire bay unit and, therefore, are valid for all
switching devices that are controlled by this bay unit. In addition, you can configure an individual switching
authority and specific switching authority as well as individual switching modes for single switching devices.
Therefore, individual switching devices can accept various switching authorities and switching modes simulta-
neously.
This is offered for the following function groups and function blocks:
•
Circuit-breaker function group
•
Disconnector function group
•
Transformer tap changer function group
•

This allows to select individual settings for each switching device. This is useful if, for example, switching
devices of different utilities are managed within a single bay.
In order to activate this option, go to the function block Control of a switching device and set the parameter
Check switching authority to advanced. An additional table containing initially 2 parameters is

With this check, you avoid switching a switching device into a state that has already been achieved. For
instance, before a trip command is issued to a circuit breaker, its current position is determined. If this circuit
breaker is already in the Off position, no command is issued. This is logged accordingly.
Switchgear Interlocking Protection
Switchgear interlocking protection means avoiding maloperation by checking the bay and substation inter-
locking and thus preventing equipment damage and personal injury. The interlocking conditions are always
system-specific and for this reason are stored as CFC charts in the devices.
SIPROTEC 5 devices recognize 2 different types of interlocking conditions:
•
Normal interlocking conditions:
These can be revoked by changing the switching mode to non-interlocked.
Control Functions
7.4 Control Functionality

577
C53000-G5040-C028-2, Edition 07.2024


•
Non-revocable (fixed) interlocking conditions:
These are still checked even if the switching mode is set to non-interlocked.
Application: Replacing mechanical interlocking, for example, that prevent actuation of a medium-
voltage switch.
Each of the 2 categories has 2 release signals (for the On and Off switching directions) that represent the
result of the interlocking plan, so that interlocking is in effect during the command check (see the figure
below). The default setting for all release signals is TRUE, so that no switchgear interlocking checks take place
if no CFC charts have been prepared.

EXAMPLE
For Interlocking
For the making direction of the circuit breaker QA in bay E01 (see the figure below), it is necessary to check
whether the disconnectors QB1, QB2, and QB9 are in the defined position, that is, either On or Off. Opening
the circuit breaker QA should be possible at any time.
The interlocking equations are: QA_On = ((QB1 = On) or (QB1 = Off)) and ((QB2 = On) or (QB2 = Off)) and
((QB9 = On) or (QB9 = Off)). There is no condition for opening.

This example considers the feeder = E01 from the previous example (bay interlocking) and additionally the
coupler bay = E02 (see the figure below).

System with Feeder and Coupler Bays
The circuit breaker QA in coupler bay = E02 will be considered next. As the multibay interlocking condition,
you must provide the bus-coupler circuit-breaker command block at the end:
If the 2 busbars in bay = E01 are connected, that is, if the 2 disconnectors QB1 and QB2 in bay =E01 are
closed, the circuit breaker QA in bay = E02 is not allowed to be switched off. Accordingly, bay = E01 in the CFC
of the device generates the indication Bus coupler closed from the positions of the switches QB1 and
QB2 and, using IEC 61850-GOOSE, transmits it to bay = E02 in the device. You must then store the following
interlocking condition in bay = E02:
QA_Off = NOT (= E01/Bus coupler closed)
In the CFC chart for the bus coupler device = E02, you must create the following CFC chart (see the figure
below).

Synchronization Function
Overview of Functions
The 1-channel Synchronization function (ANSI 25) checks whether the activation is permissible without a risk
to the stability of the system when interconnecting 2 parts of an electrical power system.
Typical applications are as follows:
•
Synchronization of a line and a busbar
•
Synchronization of 2 busbars via a cross-coupling
•
Synchronization of a generator and a busbar
A power transformer between the 2 measuring points can also be taken into consideration.
The following operating modes are covered:
•
Synchrocheck
•
Switching synchronous power systems
•
Switching asynchronous power systems
•
Switching to dead line/busbar
Structure of the Function
The function Synchronization is used in the function group Circuit-breaker.
The following stage types can be used within the function:
•
Synchrocheck stage
•
Synchronous/asynchronous stage
The stage types Synchrocheck and Synchronous/Asynchronous (Sychr./Asycr.) are preconfigured at the
factory.
You can operate a maximum of 2 stages of the stage type Synchrocheck or 6 stages of the Synchro-
nous/asynchronous in parallel.
As soon as the function is available in the device, the functional measured values are calculated and displayed.

Connection and Definition
Connection
Figure 7-56 shows an example for the synchronization of contact line and busbar.
The synchronization function uses 2 voltages to check the connecting conditions: a voltage of the reference
side 1 (V1) as well as a voltage to be used as a reference on side 2 (V2).
The reference voltage of side 1 is designated in the synchronization function as V1 and is the reference
voltage. This is always the voltage of the measuring point that is connected to the interface Sync. voltage 1 of
the function group Circuit breaker.
V2 is the voltage to be synchronized. This is always the voltage of the measuring point that is connected
to the interface Sync. voltage 2 of the function group Circuit breaker. The assignment of the measuring
points to the interfaces of the function group Circuit breaker can be configured, refer to 2.1 Embedding of
Functions in the Device.
The following figure shows the routing in DIGSI 5:
[sc_rout_Syn_7ST86, 1, en_US]
Figure 7-55
Routing of the Measuring Points to the Interfaces of the Function Group Circuit Breaker
The following voltages are used for the synchronization:
•
Measuring point 1 with synchronization voltage V1
•
Measuring point 2 with the synchronization voltage V2
For the measuring point V-CL, the voltage of the contact line is always used as the synchronization voltage.
[dw_syn_7ST86, 1, en_US]
Figure 7-56
Synchronization of Contact Line and Busbar, Connection via 2 Voltage Inputs
Definition of the Variables
The definition of the variables is important for understanding the following implementation. The reference
side 1 indicates the function with 1. This yields the reference values voltageV1, frequencyf1, and phase angle
α1. The side to be synchronized indicates the function with 2. The electrical variables of side 2 are then the
voltageV2, frequencyf2, and phase angle α2.

SIPROTEC 5, Contact Line Protection, Manual
C53000-G5040-C028-2, Edition 07.2024


When forming the differential variables, the function is oriented to the definition of the absolute measuring
error (Δ x = measured value – real value). The reference value and hence the real value is side 1. This results in
the following calculation specifications:
Differential voltage dV = V2 – V1
A positive sign means that the voltage V2 is greater than the voltage V1. In other cases, the sign is negative.
Differential frequency df = f2 – f1
A positive result means that according to the example from Figure 7-56 the busbar frequency is greater than
the line frequency.
Phase-angle difference dα = α2 – α1
The representation is limited to ±180o. A positive result means that α2 leads by a maximum of 180o. In the
case of a negative value, α2 lags by a maximum of 180o. Figure 7-57 shows the circumstances. The phase
angle α1 was added to the zero axis as a reference system.
If asynchronous systems are present and the frequency f2 is greater than f1, the angle dα then changes from
the negative value to 0 and then to the positive value. As shown in Figure 7-57, the direction of rotation is
counterclockwise (mathematically positive). At f2 < f1, the direction of rotation is clockwise.
[dw_synp_04, 2, en_US]
Figure 7-57
Phase-Angle Difference Representation dα
Only positive values are permissible for the setting parameters. Inequalities are used to characterize the
setting parameters uniquely. The representation is explained with the example of differential voltage. 2
setting values are necessary to allow unbalanced settings.
The inequality V2 > V1 yields a positive value for dV. The associated parameter is Max. voltage diff.
V2>V1. For the 2nd setting parameter Max. voltage diff. V2<V1, the inequality V2 < V1 applies. It
corresponds to a negative dV.
The procedure is the same for the differential frequency and differential phase angle.

Overview of the Stage Logic
Stage Control
The normal stage control is used for a synchronization stage (see Figure 7-58).
Note the following special features:
•
For control via IEC 61850, a parameterized function Synchrocheck is only executed if the service param-
eter Synchrocheck is set to true. The function control also provides the service parameter Inter-
lock-Check. If the service parameter Synchrocheck is set to false, switching is not synchronized.
Siemens recommends checking the desired behavior for control from remote via IEC 61850 before the
commissioning.
•
As soon as there is a synchronization function available in the device, the measured values are calculated
and displayed. One stage must be activated for calculating all Delta settings. It is not necessary to start
the stage for this purpose.
•
If all synchronization stages are deactivated within the function, closure via the control will no longer be
possible, as none of the stages can generate a closing release. If the synchronization function is deleted,
the circuit breaker is no longer regarded as subject to compulsory synchronization. In this case, it is
possible to activate via the control without synchronization.
•
If more than one synchronization stage is activated, the >Selection signal must be active for exactly
one stage, so that it can be activated via the controls.
You can block the entire synchronization stage via the binary signal >Block stage. A started process is
completed and the entire stage reset after blocking. The stage must be restarted to initiate a new switching

procedure. The blocking only affects the test process for the closing conditions. The measured values are still
calculated and displayed.
Operating Range
[lo_syn002-01, 2, en_US]
Figure 7-59
Logic of the Operating Ranges
The operating range of the synchronization function is defined by the configurable voltage limits Min.
operating limit Vmin and Max. operat. limit Vmax, as well as by the specified frequency band
frated ±4 Hz.
If one or both voltages are outside the permitted operating range when the measurement is started or
a voltage leaves the range, this is displayed via corresponding indications Frequency f1 > fmax,
Frequency f1 < fmin, Voltage V1 > Vmax, Voltage V1 < Vmin, etc. The closing conditions are
then not checked.
Supervision
The supervisions listed below are executed in a function-specific manner. If one of the supervisions picks up,
the indication Health goes to Warning. The stage is indicated as Inactive. A closing release or direct close
command is not possible in this case.
•
For consistency of settings of specific parameters
Definite threshold-value settings are checked after a parameter change. If there is an inconsistency, the
error message Setting error is issued.
•
For multiple selection of the stage at the start time of the synchronization
If there is a simultaneous selection of multiple closed synchronization stages at the start time, the error
message Multiple selection is issued.
Measuring-Voltage Failure
If a voltage-transformer fault (measuring-voltage failure) is recorded via the binary input signal >Open of
one of the voltage-measuring points, then the closing conditions of the synchronization stage are no longer

tested. This means that a release of the closure based on the measurement is no longer possible. The
readiness of the stage turns to Warning. Direct close command is still possible.
The device-internal supervision function measuring-voltage failure detection (Fuse Failure Monitor) does not
have any effect on the synchronization stage.
Functional Measured Values
The functional measured values for the Synchronization function are displayed in their own primary, secon-
dary, and percentage measured value windows. Voltage measurements are always displayed as ph-ph
voltages, even if the associated measuring point records phase-to-ground voltages. The functional measured
values are determined and displayed as soon as the device is functional. The difference values are calculated
as soon as the stage is activated.

Multiple Synchronization Points
The synchronization function can only be used within a Circuit-breaker function group. It always operates on
the circuit breaker that is linked to the Circuit-breaker function group. The reference to the circuit breaker is
therefore unique. If you wish to switch several circuit breakers (synchronization points) with the device, you
must create several Circuit-breaker function groups.
Different Synchronization Conditions per Synchronization Point
Within the synchronization function, you can operate maximum 2 stages of the stage type Synchrocheck
and maximum 6 stages of the type Synchronous/asynchronous in parallel. All setting parameters for a
synchronization point are included in each synchronization stage.
If you have to synchronize with different synchronization conditions (parameter settings), several synchroniza-
tion stages are used for a synchronization point/circuit breaker. In this case, you must define which of the
synchronization stages is currently active via the binary signal >Selection (synchronization stage x). The
closing conditions are checked if the respective stage is activated via the >Selection binary signal and the
stage is activated.
The fault indication Multiple selection is issued upon simultaneous selection of different synchroniza-
tion stages. If several synchronization stages are activated and the input signal >Selection (synchronization
stage x) is missing at the starting time, a valid selection is awaited during the supervision time Max.durat.
sync.process. If this does not come, the process is terminated.
Different Voltage-Transformer Ratios from Both Sides of the Electrical Power System
The synchronization function automatically takes different transformation ratios of the voltage measuring
points into account on both sides of the power system.

Different Connection Types on Both Sides
If both the measuring points used by the synchronization functions record different voltages of the 3-phase
system, the calculation of the phase-angle difference is automatically considered.
Application and Setting Notes
Stage-Type Selection
The following 2 types of stages are available:
Stage Type
Application
Synchrocheck stage
Select this type of stage to issue, for example, an additional release
during a manual reclosing for safety reasons.
With this type, the variables ΔV, Δf, and Δα are checked before
connecting the 2 parts of the power system.
Synchronous/asynchronous stage
Select this type of stage if it is necessary to differentiate between
synchronous and asynchronous systems, depending on the switch posi-
tion.
If galvanically coupled systems are switched in parallel, synchronous
systems are present. A typical characteristic of synchronous systems is
equality of frequency (Δf ≈ 0). In this state, the conditions Δα and ΔV
are checked.
If the systems are galvanically isolated, asynchronous systems can be
present. At the same time, compliance with the voltage difference ΔV
and frequency difference Δf conditions is checked. The time of the
direct close command is calculated taking into account the angle differ-
ence Δα and the make time of the circuit breaker. The time of the direct
close command is calculated such that the voltages are equal at the
moment the circuit-breaker poles come into contact (ΔV ≈ 0, Δα ≈ 0).
Configuration of the Voltages V1 (Reference Side) and V2
The voltages V1 and V2 are established via the connection of the measuring points to the interface of the
function groups (refer to chapter 7.5.3 Connection and Definition). The measuring point connected to the
interface Voltage is the reference side 1 with the reference voltage V1. The measuring point connected to the
interface Sync. voltage is the side 2 with V2. The definition of the Delta parameters that can be derived from
this is also described in chapter 7.5.3 Connection and Definition.
Parameter: Min. operating limit Vmin, Max. operat. limit Vmax
•
Recommended setting value (_:5071:101) Min. operating limit Vmin = 90 V
•
Recommended setting value (_:5071:102) Max. operat. limit Vmax = 110 V
The values define the voltage operating range of the synchronization stage. A normal setting is approx. ±10 %
of the rated voltage.

i
NOTE
All voltages connected according to the parameterized measuring-point connection type are subjected
to the appropriate Vmin/Vmax test. Therefore, connected phase-to-ground voltages are multiplied by √3,
since the threshold values must be set with reference to the rated voltage (phase-to-phase voltage).

[lo_hyster-01, 2, en_US]
If the Synchronization function is started within the hysteresis, no switching is performed as a result of the
minimum and maximum operating limit (parameters Min. operating limit Vmin and Max. operat.
limit Vmax). If the Synchronization function is started within the voltage operating range and the voltage
exceeds the minimum or maximum operating limit during the synchronization process, selecting can occur in
the area of the hysteresis.
Parameter: Max.durat. sync.process
•
Default setting (_:5071:110) Max.durat. sync.process = 30 s
The parameterized conditions must be fulfilled within this time. If the conditions are not fulfilled, no further
closing release takes place and the synchronization stage is stopped. If this time is set to ∞, conditions
are checked until they are fulfilled. This is also the default setting. Observe the operating conditions when
defining the time limitation. This must be defined specifically for each system. If 0 or 0.01 s is set, then all
conditions are checked once at the starting time. Thereafter the process is stopped immediately.
If the closure release is assigned, the synchronization is terminated. If the synchrocheck is to continuously
display the switching conditions, without issuing a direct close command at synchronization, proceed as
follows:

For Continuous Checking of the Switching Conditions without Issuing a Direct Close Command

Parameter: CB make time
•
Default setting (_:5041:113) CB make time = 0.060 s
If you are to interconnect under asynchronous system conditions with the device as well, the make time
of the circuit breaker must be taken into account. The device uses this to calculate the time of the direct
close command, so that the voltages are in phase at the moment of closure of the switch poles. Note that
apart from the operating time of the switch, this also includes the pickup time of an auxiliary relay that may
be upstream. You can determine the make time using the protection device (see commissioning notes in
10.8 Primary and Secondary Testing of the Synchronization Function).
This parameter only occurs for the stage type Synchronous/asynchronous.

Dynamic Measuring-Point Switching
Dynamic measuring-point switching provides the capability to connect the voltages used in the Synchro-
check function to various measuring points. In this way, for example, it is possible to use the correct voltage
on the basis of the switch position on the switching devices. If more than 1 measuring point is connected to
V sync1 or V sync2, you must create the V sync select. function block in the function group Circuit
breaker.
Selection of the desired voltage measuring points (V sync1 and V sync2) for the function group Circuit
breaker is controlled via Continuous Function Chart.
Example
Figure 7-62 shows an example of a Synchrocheck in an application with double busbar. If circuit breaker QA1
is to be closed, the reference voltages must be selected from several possible measuring points (busbar A or
busbar B). This selection of measuring points is dependent on the switch positions of the disconnectors QB1
and QB2.

Connecting the Measuring Points with the Function Group Circuit-Breaker
There are consistency checks that validate the connections of voltage measuring points to the function group:
•
The connection type must be identical for all measuring points connected to the same interface.
•
It is not permitted to route a measuring point to the function group using the option VN.
•
The rated voltage (primary and secondary) must be identical for all measuring points connected to the
same interface.
•
If more than 1 measuring point is connected to 1 voltage interface, a function block must be expanded to
enable selection of the synchronization voltage.
CFC Control
The voltages are selected by CFC logic on the basis of the measuring point IDs. If more than one measuring
point is connected to interfaces Vsync1 or Vsync2 of the function group Circuit breaker, the function blockV
sync select. has to be removed from the library in the function group Circuit breaker. A CFC logic (see
following example) has to define IDs for the V sync1 or V sync2 inputs of this function block in order to
ensure the correct measuring point connection for the Synchrocheck function.

Sequence of Functions
Start
The synchronization stage must be started to check the closing conditions. The synchronization stage can
be started device-internally by the control or externally via binary input signals (see 7.5.11 Interaction with
Control and External Triggering).
At the start, the system checks whether there is a multiple selection of the synchronization stage (see Supervi-
sion in 7.5.4.1 Description). If this is the case, the process is terminated. After a successful start, the indication
In progress is cleared and the supervision time for the maximum duration of the synchronization process
(parameter Max.durat. sync.process) is started. The system also checks whether the voltages and
frequencies are in the operating range (see 7.5.4.1 Description). If this is not the case, the closing conditions
are not checked.
Checking the Closing Conditions, Closure
After starting, the parameterized closing conditions are checked, depending on the selected operating mode
(see 7.5.8.1 Description to 7.5.10 Direct Close Command ). Every condition fulfilled is explicitly indicated
here. Conditions not fulfilled are also indicated. If all conditions are fulfilled, the synchronization stage sets
the indication All sync. conditio. OK. The indication is active until all conditions are fulfilled. The
further behavior for issuing the release for closing depends on the type of the stage (see 7.5.7.1 Description
and 7.5.8.1 Description). The release is signaled via the Release close cmd. indication. This indication is
active for 100 ms. With an internal start, the control performs the actual closure, depending on the internal
starting source.
Switching to Dead Line/Busbar
If operating modes for switching to dead parts of an electrical power system are configured, the associated
conditions are also checked after the start (see 7.5.9.1 Description). The fulfilled conditions are signaled. An

adjustable supervision time starts after the closure conditions are fulfilled (parameter Supervision time).
If the conditions remain valid until expiry of the time, the function gives the release for closure after expiry of
the time.
Direct Close Command
If the Direct close command operation is active, the function instantaneously initiates the release for closure
after the successful start (see chapter 7.5.10 Direct Close Command ). A combination of direct close command
with other release conditions is not advisable, as these conditions are bypassed by the direct close command.
End of the Process
If the function is started via the device-internal control, these functions also terminate the synchronization
process upon closure. The process is terminated via the corresponding binary signals in case of external
starting.
If the supervision time (Max.durat. sync.process parameter) has expired, the process is also completed
and the indication Max. time exceeded is issued. A renewed synchronization is only possible if the stage is
restarted.
Blocking Closure
You can use the input signal >Block close command to block the release signal for the closure (signal
Release close cmd.) as well as the closure itself. The measurement continues to operate during the
blocking. If the blocking is revoked and the release conditions are still fulfilled, the release is given for closure.

Closing Conditions for the Synchrocheck Function
With this operating mode, the values ΔV, Δf, and Δα are checked before connecting the 2 parts of the elec-
trical power system. The indication All sync. conditio. OK signals that the setting values (conditions)
have been reached and that the release for closure has been given (see Checking the Closing Conditions,
Closure in 7.5.6 Sequence of Functions).
Every fulfilled condition is signaled individually via the indications Voltage difference OK, Frequency
diff. OK, and Angle difference OK.
If a condition is not fulfilled, detailed information on why the condition is not fulfilled is provided via
indications. If the differential voltage is outside the setting limits, for example, the indication V dif.too
large(V2<V1) is issued. The indication indirectly contains information that the voltage V2 has to be
increased for a successful synchronization.
With the Expanded delta-f options stage type configured and an activated (_:140) Limit dfdiff/dt
for sync. op parameter, the frequency difference rate of change is also checked. If the permissible
frequency change rate (parameter (_:141) Max. value dfdiff/dt syn) is exceeded, the indication

start, the device can continuously monitor the voltage difference, frequency difference, and angle differ-
ence of the circuit breaker. Meanwhile, the indications in progress, release close command, and

If you want to release the close command, a start command for the signal start is necessary.
If you keep the default setting, then the stage Synchrocheck runs as normal.

can be set with this, if required.
The permissible differential values must ensure that no protection tripping or damage occurs in the system
owing to compensation processes (circulating current) and power swings after interconnection of the parts
of the power system. The settings must not be configured too closely on the other side so that necessary
closures are not blocked.

Stage Synchronous/Asynchronous
Description
A distinction according to synchronous and asynchronous systems can be made with this type of stage.
If galvanically coupled systems are switched in parallel, synchronous systems are present. A typical character-
istic for synchronous systems is equality of frequency (Δf ≈ 0). If the frequency difference falls below the
setting value of the f-threshold ASYN<->SYN parameter, synchronous systems are to be assumed. If the
frequency difference exceeds the setting value of the f-threshold ASYN<->SYN parameter, asynchronous
systems are to be assumed. This status occurs in galvanically isolated systems, for example.
Both states have their own operating mode with its own closing conditions. Both operating modes can be
switched on and off separately (parameter Sync. operating mode and Async. operating mode). The
following combinations result from this:
Sync. operating mode
Async. operating

If the frequency difference is below the set
threshold value f-threshold ASYN<->SYN, the
operating mode synchronous is active. In other
cases, the operating mode asynchronous is active.

If the frequency difference is below the set
threshold value f-threshold ASYN<->SYN, the

cases, the stage is inactive, that is, a switching
release cannot be issued.

Both operating modes are deactivated. No acti-
vation release can be given via these operating
modes either.

The frequency difference is very low in the synchronous systems operating mode. It is below the threshold
value f-threshold ASYN<->SYN. The status is signaled via the State f-synchronous indication.

The parameters ΔV and Δα are checked for issuing an activation release (see Figure 7-68). The indication All
sync. conditio. OK signals that both setting values (conditions) are reached. If the conditions remain
fulfilled over the set time delay (parameter Delay close command), the release for closing is given (see
also 7.5.7.1 Description).
Every condition fulfilled is signaled individually via the indications Voltage difference OK and Angle
difference OK.
If a condition is not fulfilled, detailed information on why the condition is not fulfilled is provided via
indications. If the differential voltage is outside the setting limits, for example, the indication V dif.too
large(V2<V1) is issued. The indication indirectly contains information that the voltage V2 has to be
increased for a successful synchronization.
With the Expanded delta-f options stage type configured and an activated (_:142) Limit dfdiff/dt
for asyn. op parameter, the frequency difference rate of change is also checked. If the permissible
frequency change rate (parameter (_:143) Max. value dfdiff/dt asyn) is exceeded, the indication
(_:329) dfdiff/dt too large is generated.

Closing Conditions when Switching Asynchronous Systems
In this operating mode, compliance with the voltage difference ΔV and frequency difference Δf conditions
is checked. The function calculates the time point of the close command taking into account the angular
difference Δα and the make time of the circuit breaker. This is calculated so that the voltage phasors are equal
at the moment of pole contact by the circuit breaker (ΔV ≈ 0, Δα ≈ 0).
Ranges in the Voltage-Frequency Diagram (V-f Diagram)
Figure 7-70 shows the setting parameters for synchronous and asynchronous conditions in the V-f diagram.
The frequency band is very narrow owing to the functional principle in the case of synchronous systems.

Continuous Supervision
With the parameter Continuous supervision activated, even if there is no start command for the signal
start, the device can continuously monitor the synchronous condition of the circuit breaker. Meanwhile,
the indications in progress, release close command, and max. duration time expired are not
issued.
If you want to release the close command, a start command for the signal start is necessary.
If you keep the default setting, then the stage Synchronous/Asynchronous runs as normal.

If the frequency difference is below the set threshold

Regardless of the frequency difference and the
threshold value f-threshold ASYN<->SYN, the
asynchronous operating mode is exclusively active.
The make time of the circuit breaker is always taken
into account for determining the connecting point.
Select this operating mode if you wish to activate
machines, for example generators or asynchronous
motors.
However, if synchronous conditions with a low Δf are
present, a close command is generated in this oper-
ating mode without a kick pulse.

Use this operating mode for galvanically connected
systems.
Closure is only possible with synchronous systems
(with low Δf).
off
off
Both operating modes are deactivated. No closing
release can therefore be given via this operating
mode.
This configuration is only advisable for special applica-
tions. Select this operating mode if you only wish to
switch, for example de-energized parts of the power
system.

2 parameters are available for the differential values voltage, frequency, and angle. Unbalanced closing ranges
can be set with this, if required.
The permissible differential values must ensure that no protection tripping or damage occurs in the system
owing to compensation processes (circulating current) and power swings after interconnection of the parts
of the power system. The settings must not be configured too closely on the other side so that necessary
closures are not blocked.
Typical differential values are selected in the default setting. Depending on the system, the settings must be
checked and adjusted, if necessary.

Closing at De-Energized Line/Busbar
Description
If at least one of 2 parts of an electrical power system is de-energized, the parts of the electrical power system
can be connected together via the following operating modes.
If the measured voltage is less than the threshold V1, V2 without voltage, the zero potential of the
part of the electrical power system is detected. In this case, all phases are compared to the parameter V1,
V2 without voltage. The energized side must be in the defined operating range with respect to voltage
and frequency (see chapter 7.5.4.1 Description) and all phases must exceed the threshold V1, V2 with
voltage.
The following additional closing conditions can be selected, which are then applied next to the closing
conditions for the synchronism:
Settings
Description
Close cmd. at V1> & V2<
Closing release under the condition that the part V1 of the power
system is energized and the part of the electrical power system
U2 is de-energized.
Close cmd. at V1< & V2>
Closing release under the condition that the part V1 of the power
system is de-energized and the part of the electrical power
system U2 is energized.
Close cmd. at V1< & V2<
Closing release provided mains adapters V 1 and V2 are de-ener-
gized.
Each of these conditions can be made effective individually via parameters or binary input. You can also set
parameters for combinations, for example a release for closure, if Close cmd. at V1> & V2< or Close
cmd. at V1< & V2> has been fulfilled.

The indications Cond. V1>V2< fulfilled, Cond. V1<V2> fulfilled and Cond. V1<V2<
fulfilled indicate that the relevant conditions are fulfilled.
If the following 2 conditions are met, these indications refresh automatically:
•
You set the parameter Sync. operating mode to on.
•
You select the parameter Continuous supervision.
You can use the Supervision time parameter to set a supervision time for which the closing conditions
must at least be fulfilled with de-energized connection, before closing is allowed.
Application and Setting Notes
If at least one of 2 parts of an electrical power system is de-energized, the parts of the electrical power system
can be connected together via the following operating modes. The above potential release conditions are
independent of one another and can also be combined.

NOTE
For reasons of safety, the releases have been deactivated in the default setting and are therefore at no.
Even if you wish to apply one of these operating modes, Siemens recommends leaving the setting at no
for reasons of safety. Set the operating mode only dynamically via the assigned binary input signal (for
example >Operating mode 'U1>U2<') (see also Figure 7-71). This prevents one of these operating
modes from being incorrectly activated statically thereby resulting in an incorrect switching.

You must set the value below the minimum expected operational undervoltage. Siemens therefore recom-
mends a setting value of approx. 80 % of the rated voltage. All voltages connected according to the parame-

The setting value indicates the voltage below which a part of the power system (feeder or busbar) can be
regarded as deactivated with certainty.
Siemens recommends a setting value of approx. 5 % of the rated voltage for this. All voltages connected
according to the parameterized measuring-point connection type are subjected to the appropriate Vmin/Vmax
test.
Parameter: Supervision time
•
Recommended setting value (_:5071:109) Supervision time = 0.1 s
The parameter defines a supervision time for which the above additional closing conditions have to be at
least fulfilled at de-energized switching, before the release for closing is given. In order to include transient
phenomena, Siemens recommends a value of 0.1 s.
Parameter: Direct close command
•
Recommended setting value (_:5071:108) Direct close command = no
In this operating mode, the function initiates a closing release without any testing upon start of the synchroni-
zation stage. The closure occurs immediately.
i
i
NOTE
For safety reasons, Siemens recommends leaving the setting atno. If a direct close command is necessary,
Siemens recommends only using this operating mode dynamically via the binary input signal >Op. mode
'dir.cls.cmd' (see also Figure 7-73). This prevents this operating mode from being incorrectly acti-
vated statically thereby resulting in an incorrect switching.
Direct Close Command
You can activate the operating mode direct close command statically via the Direct close command
parameter or dynamically with the binary input signal >Op. mode 'dir.cls.cmd' (see Figure 7-72).
[lo_syndir_01, 2, en_US]
Figure 7-72
Activation of the Operating Mode Direct Close Command
The operating mode Direct close command function initiates a closure release without any testing upon start
of the synchronization stage. The closure occurs immediately.
The combination Direct close command with other operating modes is not recommended, as the other
operating mode is bypassed.
If the synchronization function is defective (standby of the sync stage = alarm or warning), a direct close
command is executed or not executed, depending on the type of fault (see also supervisions in chapter
7.5.4.1 Description).

Interaction with Control and External Triggering
With Control
The control and synchronization functions are always located in a Circuit-breaker function group. The control
and also the synchronization function always operate with the circuit breaker, which is linked to the function
group Circuit breaker.
As soon as the synchronization function is in the Circuit-breaker function group, the circuit breaker is subject
to compulsory synchronization. If all synchronization stages are deactivated, the circuit breaker cannot be acti-
vated via the control, as no release can be generated for the closure. The circuit breaker is no longer subject to
compulsory synchronization after deletion of the synchronization function. Closure without synchronization is
then possible via the control.
If closure is to be synchronized via the control, the control automatically generates an internal signal which
starts the synchronization function. The functional sequence is described in chapter 7.5.6 Sequence of Func-
tions. After fulfilling all closing conditions, the synchronization sends a release signal to the control, which
closes the circuit breaker and then stops and synchronization function.
[lo_synaw1-01, 3, en_US]
Figure 7-73
Interaction of the Control with the Synchronization Function
With External Control
You have the option of controlling the synchronization function externally via binary input signals. This can be
done as follows:
•
Edge-controlled
•
Via the signals >Start syn. process and >Stop syn. process
•
State-controlled via the signal >Start/stop syn.proc. (see also 7.5.6 Sequence of Functions).
The start is followed by the functional sequence (see 7.5.6 Sequence of Functions). If the conditions are
fulfilled, the output signal Release close cmd. is output. The switched object QAx of the function group
Circuit breaker is not closed. The output signal Release close cmd. must be explicitly routed to the
binary output in order to close the circuit breaker.

User-Defined Function Block [Control]
Overview of Functions
The User-defined function block [control] allows the switching-authority check of a control command,
the check of whether the position has been reached, a double-activation blocking, and the definition of
interlocking conditions for user-defined controllables.
Function Description
The User-defined function block [control] is located in the folder User-defined functions in the DIGSI 5
Library.
You can instantiate the user-defined function blocks on the top level (in parallel to other function groups) as
well as within function groups and functions.
The task of the function block is to check the switching authority and the interlocking conditions for the
user-defined control commands instantiated within it. For these control commands, the function block checks
whether the required switch position is equal to the current switch position (actual/set point comparison).
If you activate the double-activation blocking, commands from switching objects and user-defined control
signals will be rejected as long as a command is still being performed for one of the other switching objects for
which double-activation blocking has also been set.
With the binary release signals, you can determine a switchgear interlocking protection for all the user-defined
control signals instantiated in the function block. Unlike the switching devices (circuit breaker, disconnector),
there is only one release input here, since there is only one switching direction for the signal types INC and
APC. The signal types DPC, SPC, and BSC have 2 switching directions, but still only one release input. This
release input can be operated based on the result of a logic created in the CFC, or can be directly connected to
a binary input or a variable. If the input >Enable is activated, the switching command can be performed. If it
is not activated, the switching command is rejected, with the reason Interlocking violation.
This applies in a similar way to the input >Enable (fixed), although with this input, the interlocking
cannot be revoked by key switch S1 or an unlocked switching authority.
The following table shows the reaction of the function to the assignment of its inputs.

for one of the other objects.
Parameter: Check swi.auth. for Mode
•
Default setting (_:150) Check swi.auth. for Mode = no
With the Check swi.auth. for Mode parameter, you specify whether the switching authority for the
command source must be checked when switching the controllable Mode (controllable) to the mode
On, Off, or Test. If you set the parameter Check swi.auth. for Mode to yes, the switching command
is only executed with the appropriate switching authority (see chapter 7.4.1 Command Checks and Switch-
gear Interlocking Protection).

CFC-Chart Settings
Overview of Functions
If you want to process a parameter in a CFC chart and this parameter is to be changeable during runtime
using DIGSI or HMI, you can use the function blocks CFC chart of Boolean parameters, the CFC chart of
integer parameters and the CFC chart of floating-point parameters. Instantiate the appropriate function
block depending on the parameter value needed (logical, integer, or floating point). In this way, the current
value of the parameter can then be used in the CFC chart at runtime.
Function Description
You can find the CFC-chart parameters Chrt sett.Bool, Chart setting Int, and Chrt sett.real
in the DIGSI library in the User-defined functions folder. Drag and drop the desired function block into a
function group or a function. Set the appropriate parameter value of the function block in DIGSI using the
parameter editor or via HMI under the Settings menu item. You can then use the parameter as an input signal
in CFC charts.
With Exp. options, you define the range and the unit of the value. This prevents users from entering incorrect
setting values.
i
i
NOTE
The user-defined function groups and the user-defined functions can be used to group the CFC-chart
parameters. You can rename for the function block and change the parameter value in the DIGSI Informa-
tion routing matrix to suit your specific application.

Overview
SIPROTEC 5 devices are equipped with an extensive and integrated supervision concept. Continuous supervi-
sion:
•
Ensures the availability of the technology used
•
Avoids subfunction and overfunction of the device
•
Protects persons and primary technical devices
•
Offers effective assistance during commissioning and testing
The following areas are monitored:
•
Supervision the resource consumption of the application
•
Supervision of the secondary system, including the external auxiliary power supply
•
Supervision of device hardware
•
Supervision of device firmware
•
Supervision of hardware configuration
•
Supervision of communication connections
When the supervision functions pick up, that will be displayed and also indicated. Error responses are defined
for the device. The error responses are grouped in defect severities.
The supervision functions work selectively. When the supervision functions pick up - as far as possible - only
the affected parts of the hardware and firmware are blocked. If this is not possible, the device goes out of
operation into a secure state (fallback mode). In addition to safety, this warrants a high degree of availability.

Resource-Consumption Supervision
Load Model
SIPROTEC 5devices are freely configurable. A load model is integrated in DIGSI 5. The load model prevents you
from overloading the device with an excessively large application.
The load model shows the device utilization and the response times for device functions. If it determines that
an application created is likely to overload the device, DIGSI prevents the application from being loaded into
the device.
In this rare case, you must then reduce the application in order to be able to load it into the device.
The load model can be found in the DIGSI 5 project tree under Name of the device → Device information. In
the operating range, select the Resource consumption setting sheet. The following figure shows an example
of the view of the load model in DIGSI 5:
[sc_lastmo_01, 1, en_US]
Figure 8-1
Visualization of the Load Model in DIGSI
A green total display for the processor response time indicates that the device is not overloaded by the present
application. On the other hand, if you see a red exclamation mark, the planned application is overloading the
device.
The list below the total display shows the individual functional areas. These areas combine functions with
the same real-time requirements. A green display in front of an area (see Figure 8-1) indicates that the
response times of the functions grouped in this area can be maintained. A red exclamation mark indicates that
functions may have longer response times than specified in the Technical data for the device. In such a case,
loading of the application into the device is blocked.
The following table provides an overview of the functional areas and the most important influencing quanti-
ties on device utilization:
If the load model displays a warning, bear in mind the following general instructions:
The areas named in the table are listed in descending order of real-time requirements. If a warning appears to
the effect that the guaranteed response times may be exceeded in an area, you can return to the permitted
area by taking the following measures:
•
Reduce the functional scope in the marked area (red exclamation mark)
•
Reduce the functional scope in another area with higher real-time requirements
When you have reduced the application, check the display in resource consumption! If a function or stage has
been switched off, it will continue to represent a load for the area. If you do not need the function or stage,
delete it rather than switching it off.

Use the general Circuit-breaker function group only in the following cases:
•
Interaction with a protection-function group is essential.
That is to say, operate indications of protection functions cause the circuit breaker assigned to the
Circuit-breaker function group to be switched off.
•
You want to use functions such as the automatic reclosing function or circuit-breaker failure protection in
the Circuit-breaker function group.
If a circuit breaker is only to be modeled for control purposes, use the Circuit-breaker [state only] function
group.
Function Points
When you order a SIPROTEC 5 device, you are also ordering a function-points account for use of additional
functions.
The following figure illustrates consumption of function points in the current application with respect to the
existing function-points account.
[sc_fpunkt, 1, en_US]
Figure 8-2
Resource Overview: Function-Points Consumption
The remaining white bar shows the function points that have not yet been used up by your configuration.
The number of function points available in a device depends on the device purchase order (position 20 of the
product code). You can also order function points subsequently, and so increase the function-points account
for the device.
i
i
NOTE
Find out the function-points requirement for the desired application before ordering the device. For this,
you can use the device configurator. Alternatively, you order the device with 0 function points and create
the license file with the required point credits ad hoc using the SIPROTEC function point manager (refer to
2.2 Application Templates/Adaptation of Functional Scope).
CFC Resources
Task Levels of the CFC Function
A CFC chart, and thus the configured CFC function, runs in the SIPROTEC 5 device on exactly one of the 4 task
levels. The individual task levels differ, on the one hand, in the priority of processing tasks and, on the other,
in the cyclic or event-triggered processing of the CFC charts.
You can select between the following task levels:

SIPROTEC 5, Contact Line Protection, Manual

Task Level
Description
High priority Event-
triggered
Use the High priority Event-triggered task level for time-critical
tasks, for example, if a signal should block a protection function within
2 ms to 3 ms. Functions on this task level are processed in an event-trig-
gered way with the highest priority. Each change to a logical input signal is
immediately processed. Processing can interrupt the execution of protection
functions and functions on the Event-Triggered task level.
Event-triggered
Use the Event-triggered task level preferably for logic functions that
need not be executed with highest priority. Each change to a logical input
signal is immediately processed. Protection functions or functions on the
High priority Event-triggered task level can disrupt processing.
Functions on the Event-triggered task level are typically processed
within a maximum of 5 ms in all devices. For busbar protection or
line protection, the functions on the Event-triggered task level are
processed within a maximum of 10 ms.
Low priority Cyclic-
triggered
Use the Low priority Cyclic-triggered task level for processing
measured values. Functions on this task level are processed cyclically every
500 ms.
Low priority Event-
triggered
Use the Low priority Event-triggered task level preferably for
logic functions that should be executed with lower priority than functions
in the Event-triggered task level. If the available ticks of the Event-
triggered task level shown in the following figure are sufficient for the
required CFC functionality, you do not need to use the Low priority
Event-triggered task level.
All CFC function blocks can be assigned to all the task levels. There are no device-specific function blocks. If
enough ticks are available, all CFC charts can be created in the same task level. A tick is the measure of the
performance requirement of CFC blocks.
The number of available ticks for each task is calculated depending on the created device configuration.
This calculation is based on the previously described load model. In this process, it is recommended to
create all selected functions and objects first followed by configuration of the CFC charts so that a realistic
information about the remaining system capacitance for CFC charts is available. Significantly exceeding the
typical response time is prevented by the load model by limiting the number of CFC function blocks in the
corresponding task level via the number of ticks available.
The typical response times for CFC tasks are listed in the Technical Data.
The following figure shows an example of the CFC chart capacitances in DIGSI calculated by the load model.
The ticks available for each task are shown here. The green bars represent the ticks used in the task levels. You
reach this dialog with the following call: Device → Device information → Resource consumption.

NOTE
High priority Event-triggered CFC charts have the highest priority and are processed before all other tasks.
At this level, a considerable smaller number of ticks are available than at all other tasks. It is recommended
to configure only very-high-priority logic functions at this task and to configure the other logic functions in
any other level.

Supervision of the Secondary System
Overview
The secondary circuits establish a connection to the power system from the point of view of the device.
The measuring-input circuits (currents, voltages) as well as the command circuits to the circuit breakers are
monitored for the correct function of the device. The connection to the station battery is ensured with the
supervision of the external auxiliary voltage. The secondary system has the following supervision systems:
Measuring circuits (voltage):
•
Measuring-voltage failure
•
Voltage-transformer circuit breaker
Trip Circuits
When these supervisions pick up, corresponding warning indications are output. Some supervisions lead
directly to the blocking of affected protection functions or to the marking of measuring points that have
become invalid, so that affected protection functions can go into a secure state.
A detailed description of the supervision mechanisms and their error responses can be found in the respective
function descriptions.
External Auxiliary Voltage
The monitoring of the external auxiliary voltage is described in Error Responses and Corrective Measures from
8.8.1 Overview.
Measuring-Voltage Failure
Overview of Functions
The Measuring-voltage failure detection function monitors the voltage transformer secondary circuits:
•
Non-connected transformers
•
Pickup of the voltage transformer circuit breaker (in the event of short circuits in the secondary circuit)
•
Broken conductor in one or more measuring loops
All these events cause a voltage of 0 in the voltage transformer secondary circuits which can lead to failures of
the protection functions.
Each of the following protection functions has the parameter Blk. by meas.-volt. failure. Using the
setting value of the parameter, you can specify whether the protection functions react to a measuring-voltage
failure or not (block/not block).
•
Directional Overcurrent Protection, Phases
•
Overvoltage Protection with Any Voltage
•
Undervoltage Protection with Any Voltage
•
Voltage-Dependent Overcurrent Protection, Phases
Distance protection is blocked automatically when there is a measuring-voltage failure.
Structure of the Function
The function is part of protection function groups which are connected with a voltage and current measuring
point.

Signaling-Voltage Supervision
Overview of Functions
Signaling-voltage supervision is used to evaluate the validity of binary signals connected to the SIPROTEC
device via binary inputs. For this purpose, one binary input is used to monitor the signaling voltage. If the
signaling voltage fails, the associated binary signals are marked as invalid and a Signaling-voltage malfunc-
tion indication is issued.
Several signaling-voltage supervision groups can be created in one SIPROTEC device. Each of these groups
monitors an adjustable area with binary inputs.
Structure of the Function
The Signaling-voltage supervision function group contains, besides the general functionality, one preinstan-
tiated Supervision group stage. The Supervision group stage can be instantiated in DIGSI 5 multiple times.

Structure/Embedding of the Function Group
Function Description
You can instantiate the Signaling-voltage supervision function group in the Global DIGSI 5 library.
It contains 1 pre-instantiated Superv.Grp. function block (see the following figure). You can instantiate a
maximum of 25 supervision groups.
[sc_ivslib, 1, en_US]
Figure 8-7
Entry in the Global Library
Following the instantiation of the function group in the DIGSI project tree, it appears in the information
routing of DIGSI (see the following figure). The status indications of the supervision groups can be routed
here, for example, to existing binary outputs and/or logs.
[sc_ivsrou, 1, en_US]
Figure 8-8
Information Routing
Set the binary input used for signaling-voltage supervision within one input/output module using the setting
option (see the following figure). This binary input monitors the presence of the signaling voltage. If the
signaling voltage fails, this sets the quality attribute for all other binary inputs of the parameterized input/
output module to invalid. The signal status of each of these binary inputs is frozen with its last valid value
prior to the occurrence of the fault. The quality attribute of the binary inputs for other input/output modules
are not taken into consideration by this.

If the signaling voltage again exceeds the binary threshold, the quality attribute of the binary inputs is reset to
valid.
[sc_ivsgrp, 2, en_US]

Parameterization Menu of the Supervision Group (I)
i
i
NOTE
Each status change of the monitored binary inputs is delayed by 3 ms.
You can also combine binary inputs across modules in one Superv.Grp. function block and define any
binary input within this group for supervision of the signaling voltage. For this purpose, place a check mark at
the parameter (_:102) Enable variable group when configuring the supervision group. This extends
the parameterization menu by the sections Supervis. grp. start and Supervis. grp. end (see the
following figure).
[sc_gruppe_de, 2, en_US]
Figure 8-10
Parameterization Menu of the Supervision Group (II)
There, for example, you are able to combine 1 to n different binary inputs into one supervision group. When
doing so, the binary inputs on the input/output modules assignable to a supervision group must be related
logically. With 3 input/output modules, for example, this allows only consecutive binary inputs to be grouped
on the modules 1 and 2 or 2 and 3, but no binary inputs on modules 1 and 3. The binary inputs used for
supervision can be located on any input/output module within the group defined in this manner.

If you have to monitor several binary inputs that, for example, work with different signaling voltages from
different sources, then you can also instantiate and configure several Superv.Grp. function blocks within
the Signaling-voltage supervision function group accordingly.
Within different supervision groups, only those consecutive binary inputs that are not already assigned to
another supervision group can be grouped. The overlapping of binary inputs in different supervision groups is
not permitted.
Error parameters are displayed to you by inconsistency indications in DIGSI.
Example
There are 4 input/output modules available.
Binary inputs of input/output modules 1 and 2 are already combined in supervision group 1. The 2 last binary
inputs on module 2 are not included in the grouping.
In supervision group 2, only these 2 binary inputs of the input/output module 2 not used in supervision group
1 as well as further consecutive binary inputs of the input/output modules 3 and 4 can be combined.
Application and Setting Notes
Parameter (General): Mode
•
Default setting (_:1) Mode = on
With the Mode parameter, you specify whether you want to activate, deactivate, or test the supervision of
the signaling voltage for the appropriate group. If you put the group into test mode, the Sig. volt.
disturbed indication is given a test flag.
Parameter (Supervision Signal): I/O module ID
•
Default setting (_:104) I/O module ID = I/O module 1
Using the I/O module ID parameter, you specify the I/O module for which you want to activate supervision
of the signaling voltage. Counting of the I/O modules starts in increasing order with the binary inputs of the
base module. The binary inputs of the PS201 power-supply module permanently installed in the base module
count as the 2nd I/O module followed by additional I/O modules (3 to n) on expansion boards of the device.
Parameter (Supervision Signal): Binary input
•
Default setting (_:105) Binary input = 1
Using the Binary input parameter, you specify the binary input responsible for teh supervision of the
signaling voltage for the parameterized I/O module. The quality attribute of all other binary inputs for this
module are set to valid or invalid depending on the presence of the signaling voltage at the parameterized
binary input.
Parameter (Supervision Signal): Enable variable group
•
Default setting (_:102) Enable variable group = untrue
You can activate the parameter Enable variable group by placing the checkmark. If you have not set
the check mark (default setting), only these 2 parameters are available for the configuration of the supervision
signal. If you have set the check mark, the parameter menu is extended by the areas Start supervision group
and End supervision group. You can then use that to carry out the grouping of binary inputs for supervision
groups explained in the function description.
Parameter (Start Supervision Group): I/O module ID
•
Default setting (_:106) I/O module ID = I/O module 1
Parameter I/O module ID is used to define the first I/O module that you want to assign to a supervision
group. As the counting of the I/O module starts in ascending order with the binary inputs of the base module,
this is the module with the lowest counter number that you can use for carrying out a grouping.

Voltage-Transformer Circuit Breaker
Overview of Functions
The function Voltage-transformer circuit breaker detects the tripping of the voltage-transformer circuit
breaker due to short circuits in the voltage-transformer secondary circuits.
The Voltage-transformer circuit breaker function works independently of Measuring-voltage failure detec-
tion and should be used – if possible – in parallel to it.
The tripping of the voltage-transformer circuit breaker impacts the quality of the recorded measured-value
data (refer to 3.4 Processing Quality Attributes).
The following protection function is automatically blocked if the voltage-transformer circuit breaker trips:
•
Distance protection
For the following functions the reaction (block/not block) can be set within the function in cases of a tripping
of the voltage-transformer circuit breaker:
•
Overcurrent protection
•
Directional overcurrent protection
•
Overvoltage protection with any voltage
•
Undervoltage protection with any voltage
i
i
NOTE
If the voltage signal is generated using the optional Merging unit function, the quality of the voltage
signal is sent as invalid in the sampled value stream, depending on the status of the voltage-transformer
circuit breaker. For more information about configuring the voltage-transformer circuit breaker function for
devices with merging unit and process-bus client, refer to the Process Bus manual.
Structure of the Function
The Figure 8-11 shows the position of the function in the device. Every voltage measuring point contains the
Voltage-transformer circuit breaker function.

Figure 8-11
Structure/Embedding of the Function
Function Description
The tripping of the voltage-transformer circuit breaker is captured via the binary input signal >Open. With an
active input signal the information about the measuring-voltage failure is relayed to the affected functions
(see 8.3.4.1 Overview of Functions). The response to the detection of a measuring-voltage failure is explained
in the specific protection-function descriptions.
Response Time of the Voltage-Transformer Circuit Breaker
The response time of the voltage-transformer circuit breaker can be slower than the pickup time of the
distance protection. This bears the risk of an overfunction. The response time is communicated to the device
with the Response time parameter. For a timely detection of the tripping of the voltage-transformer circuit
breaker, the pickup of the distance protection is delayed by that response time.

Input Signal: >Open
•
Input signal: (_:500) >Open
The input signal >Open must be connected to the tripping of the voltage-transformer circuit breaker. As a rule,
this occurs via the routing to a binary input.
Parameter: Response time of the voltage-transformer circuit breaker
•
Recommended setting value (_:101) Response time = 0 ms
When the voltage-transformer circuit breaker drops out, the device must block the distance protection imme-
diately to prevent an unwanted tripping of the distance protection due to the absence of the measuring
voltage while the load current is flowing.
The blocking must be faster than the 1st stage of the distance protection. This requires an extremely short
response time of the miniature circuit breaker (≤ 4 ms at 50 Hz, ≤ 3 ms at 60 Hz rated frequency). If the circuit-
breaker auxiliary contact does not fulfill this requirement, you have to set the response time accordingly.

Trip-Circuit Supervision
Overview of Functions
The Trip-circuit supervision function recognizes disruptions in the trip circuit. When 2 binary inputs are used,
the function recognizes all disruptions in the trip circuit. If only 1 binary input is available, it will not recognize
disruptions at the circuit breaker.
The control voltage for the circuit breaker must be greater than the sum of the minimum voltage drops at the
binary inputs VCtrl > 2 VBImin. At least 19 V are required for each binary input. This makes the supervision usable
only with a system-side control voltage of > 38 V.
Structure of the Function
The trip-circuit supervision is integrated into the Circuit-breaker function group. Depending on the number of
available binary inputs, it works with 1 or 2 binary inputs.

Trip-Circuit Supervision with 2 Binary Inputs
In order to recognize disruptions in the trip circuit for each switch position, you need 2 binary inputs. One
input is connected parallel to the respective command relay of the protection, the other parallel to the
circuit-breaker auxiliary contact.

Supervision with 2 binary inputs identifies disruptions in the trip circuit and the outage of the control voltage.
It also monitors the reaction of the circuit breaker by way of the position of the circuit-breaker auxiliary
contacts.
Depending on the switch position of the command relay and circuit breaker, the binary inputs are either
activated (H) or not (L). If both binary inputs are not activated, there is a fault. The fault can be a disruption
or a short circuit in the trip circuit, an outage of the battery voltage or a fault in the mechanics of the circuit
breaker. With intact trip circuits, this state will occur only briefly while the command relay is closed and the
circuit breaker has not yet been opened.

As long as the trip-circuit supervision function is blocked, the closed contact of the command relay does not
cause a failure indication.
If the command contacts of other devices work in parallel on the trip circuit, the failure indication must be
delayed. With the Alarm delay parameter, you can set the time delay. After fixing the fault in the trip
circuit, the failure indication will automatically expire after the same time.
If the binary input signal >Trip relay is not routed to a binary input of the device (information routing
in DIGSI 5), then the Input sig. not routed indication is generated and the Trip-circuit supervision
function is not in effect.

The equivalent resistance R must be dimensioned such that the circuit-breaker coil is no longer activated when
the circuit breaker is open. Simultaneously, the binary input must still be activated when the command relay is

Application and Setting Notes
Parameter: Alarm delay
•
Recommended setting value (_:100) Alarm delay = 2 s (Trip-circuit supervision with 2 binary
inputs)
•
Recommended setting value (_:100) Alarm delay = 300 s (Trip-circuit supervision with 1 binary
input)
With the parameter Alarm delay, you can set the time for the delayed output of the indication Trip-
circuit failure.
For Trip-circuit supervision with 2 binary inputs, you set the Alarm delay parameter so that the short-
term transient states do not cause the function to activate.
For the Trip-circuit supervision with 1 binary input, you set the Alarm delay so that the longest duration
of a trip command is bridged without fail. This ensures that the indication is emitted only if the trip circuit is
actually interrupted.
Parameter: Blk.by trip/open cmd from
•
Possible settings, application-dependent
The parameter works only with the trip-circuit supervision with 1 binary input.
Use the parameter Blk.by trip/open cmd from to set the conditions under which the trip-circuit
supervision is blocked. The following conditions can cause a blocking of the trip-circuit supervision function:
•
The Trip/open cmd. of the circuit breaker is activated.
•
One of the trip commands of the circuit-breaker failure protection is activated.
•
One of the trip commands of the circuit-breaker reignition protection is activated.
The circuit-breaker failure protection is set to protect a different trip circuit than the local circuit breaker. Using
the configuration options of the Blk.by trip/open cmd from parameter, multiple trip-circuit supervision
functions can be operated in parallel. For instance, a trip-circuit supervision function dedicated to a local

Supervision of the Device Hardware
Overview
The correct state of the device hardware is a requirement for the correct functioning of the device. The failure
or erroneous function of a hardware component leads to device malfunctions.
The following modules of the device hardware are monitored:
•
Base module
•
Expansion modules
•
Plug-in modules on the interface locations
The error responses result, depending on type and degree of the error, as follows:
Hardware errors where the device remains in operation.
The error is indicated. The signals/data affected by the failure are marked as invalid. In this way, the affected
protection functions can go into a secure state. Such errors are, for example:
•
Failure communication module (module x)
•
Measuring-transducer module failure (module x)
•
USB interface
•
Integrated Ethernet interface
•
Real-time clock device
•
A/D converter (fast current sum)
•
Battery voltage
•
Faulty or missing compensation values (magnitude/phase)
Failures which can partially be corrected by a restart of the device. The device goes briefly out of
operation.
Such errors are, for example:
•
Memory error (RAM) in the base module
•
Faulty module
•
Module-connection error (PCB Link)
•
Control circuit error binary output
•
Outage of an internal auxiliary voltage
•
Bit flip due to SEU event in the FPGA of the mainboard or in the ETH-BD-2FO communication module
i

NOTE
If the error has not be rectified after 3 unsuccessful attempts, the system automatically recognizes it as
a severe device malfunction. The device goes permanently out of operation into a secure state (fallback
mode).
Fatal device errors with outage of central components: The device goes permanently out of operation
into a secure state (fallback mode).
Such errors are, for example:
•
Memory error (flash) in the base module
•
CPU/Controller/FPGA error in the base module
•
3 unsuccessful restarts in a row

You can find the detailed description of the error responses in table form at the end of this chapter. You will
find corresponding corrective measures there.
Device Operating Hours
The Device operating hours statistical value counts the operating hours of the physical device. The
starting time and the time in Fallback mode are not considered.
You can neither reset nor change the statistical value.
Monitoring of SEU Events
The Monitoring of SEU events function has the following tasks:
•
Bit flip monitoring on the FPGAs
•
Checksum monitoring of the sampled values in order to prevent erroneous activation of protection
functions
•
Reinitialization of the FPGAs on the IO boards without restarting the device
•
Restart of the device if SEU events occur on the FPGA of the mainboard or on the ETH-BD-2FO communi-
cation module
The interaction of a semiconductor with an energetic particle (for example, due to cosmic radiation) is referred
to as a Single event (SE). During this process, the impacting particle transfers energy to the semiconductor.
The energy emitted can lead to a change in the logic state in the semiconductor (bit flip). This is referred to as
Single Event Upset (SEU).
Further information on this can be found in the whitepaper on the subject of SEU, which is available on the
Siemens website. The FPGA types used in the SIPROTEC 5 devices have an FPGA-internal SEU detection, which
allows the device to react to an SEU event. In the event of an SEU on an FPGA of the IO board, a non-intrusive
restart of the FPGA occurs within a few milliseconds. There is no need to restart the device. If an SEU event
occurs on the mainboard or the ETH-BD-2FO communication module, the FPGA can only be initialized via a
device restart. In this case, the SEU event is notified via the message SEU happened (4171.343).

Supervision of Device Firmware
The device firmware determines essentially the functionality of the device.
The following supervisions ensure the stable function of the device:
•
Supervisions of the data and version consistency
•
Supervision of the undisturbed sequential activity of the device firmware
•
Supervision of the available processor performance
When you start the device, load data via the interfaces and these supervisions of the device firmware will be
in effect during the continuous operation. Depending on the type and severity of error, the following error
responses will result:
Firmware failures where the device remains in operation.
The error is indicated. The signals/data affected by the failure are marked as invalid. In this way, the affected
protection functions can go into a secure state. Such errors are, for example, errors in time synchronization
(loss and errors).
Failures which can partially be corrected by a restart of the device. The device goes briefly out of
operation.
Such errors are, for example:
•
Device startup with faulty new parameter set. The old parameter set is still present.
•
Overloading of the processor
•
Program-sequence error
Fatal firmware error. The device goes permanently out of operation into a secure state (fallback mode).
Such errors are, for example:
•
Device startup with faulty new parameter set. No usable parameter set is present.
•
Device startup with version error
•
CFC-runtime error
•
3 unsuccessful restarts in a row

Supervision of Hardware Configuration
The modular hardware concept requires adherence to some rules within the product family and the modular
system. Configuration errors show that the hardware configuration saved in the device does not agree with
the hardware actually detected. Impermissible components and unallowed combinations must be detected
just as missing configured components are.
Depending on the type and severity of error, the following error responses will result: The identified hardware
configuration errors are assigned to the defect severities as follows:
Configuration errors for which the device remains in operation.
The failure is indicated. The signals/data affected by the failure are marked as invalid. In this way, the affected
protection functions can go into a secure state. Such errors are, for example, errors in the IE-converter
configuration (normal/sensitive).
Fatal configuration error: The device goes permanently out of operation into a secure state (fallback
mode).
Such errors are, for example:
•
Missing hardware module (module x)
•
Incorrect hardware module (module x)
•
Incorrect hardware combination
•
Incorrect plug-in module (module x)
You can find the detailed description of the error responses in table form at the end of this chapter. You
will find corresponding corrective measures there. You can resolve configuration errors through another

Supervision of Communication Connections
SIPROTEC 5devices offer extensive communication options via fixed and optional interfaces. Beyond the
hardware supervision of the , the transferred data must also be monitored with respect to their consistency, a
failure, or an outage.
Supervision
With the supervision of the communication connections, every communication port is monitored selectively.
•
Failures are detected and indicated via the operational log. The device remains in operation.
•
Additionally, each port is equipped with a separate communication log, which displays details of the
failures, for example the error rate. 
Marking Fault Signals/Data
The signals/data affected by the failure are marked as invalid. Affected functions therefore treat these signals/
data as a safe state. In the following, some examples are named:
•
GOOSE signals can automatically be set to defined values in case of disturbed IEC 61850 communication.
•
Disturbed protection interfaces set phasor values, analog measured values, and binary information to
invalid, for example for the differential protection.  Binary signal traces can be set to defined values in
cases of failures.
•
Disturbed time-synchronization signals can lead to an automatic change of the source of time synchroni-
zation.
You can correct communication failures by checking the external connections or by replacing the affected
communication modules.
For more information about the error responses, refer to to 8.8.4 Defect Severity 3. Corresponding corrective
measures can also be found there.

Error Responses and Corrective Measures
Overview
When device errors occur and the corresponding supervision functions pick up, this is displayed on the device
and also indicated. Device errors can lead to corruption of data and signals. These data and signals are marked
and tagged as invalid, so that affected functions automatically go into a secure state. If the supervision
functions pick up, this will lead to defined error responses.
How Do Device Errors Make Themselves Noticeable
In case of a device error the supervision functions of the device pickup. The device responds according to
the type and severity of the error. To report an error, supervision functions use outputs on the device and
indications.
Run LED (green)
The external auxiliary voltage is present. The device is ready for operation.

Indications of causes for defects and corrective measures
Determination of Causes for Defects and Corrective Measures
To determine the cause for defect and the corresponding corrective measure, proceed step by step.
Step 1:
Pick up of supervisions leads to one of the following defect severities in all cases.
•
Defect severity 1:
Internal or external device error that is reported. The device remains in operation.
•
Defect severity 2:
Severe device failure, the device restarts (reset) to correct the cause for defect.
•
Defect severity 3:
Severe device failure, the device goes to a safe condition (fallback mode), as the
correction of defects cannot be implemented by a restart. In fallback mode, the
protection and automated functions are inactive. The device is out of operation.
•
Defect severity 4:
Severe device-external failure, the device switches the protection and automatic
functions to inactive for safety, but remains in operation. Normally, the user can
correct the fault by himself.
Step 2:
For every defect severity, you will find detailed tables with information about causes
for defects, error responses, and corrective measures in the following chapters.

Defect severity 1 faults allow the continued safe operation of the device. Defect severity 1 faults are indicated.
The device remains in operation.
When the supervision functions pick up, corrupted data and signals are marked as invalid. In this way, the
affected functions can go into a secure state. Whether functions are blocked is decided in the appropriate
function itself. For more detailed information, refer to the function descriptions.

Log
For every device fault, a corresponding supervision indication is generated. The device records these indica-
tions with a real-time stamp in the operational log. In this way they are available for further analyses. If
supervisions in the communication interfaces area of the device pick up, there is a separate communication
log available for each port. Extended diagnostic indications and measured values are available there. The
device-diagnosis log contains expanded fault descriptions. There you also receive recommendations of corre-
sponding corrective measures for each detected device error.
There is further information on handling the logs in 3.1 Indications.
Group-Warning Indication Group Warning
As delivered, all monitoring indications of Defect Severity 1 are routed to the signal (_:301)Group
warning. In this way, a device error can be indicated with only one indication. The majority of supervision
indications are permanently connected to the Group warning (Group warning column = fixed). However,
some supervision indications are routed flexibly to the Group warning via a logic block chart (Group
warning column = CFC). If necessary, the routings via a CFC chart can be taken from the group indication
again.
In delivery condition, the Group warning is routed to an LED.
The following logic diagram shows the correlation.

this signal.
Fatal device errors are errors that cannot be resolved by a restart of the device. In this case, contact the
Customer Support Center. The device goes permanently out of operation, a failure is avoided. In the fallback

Defect Severity 4 (Group Alarm)
Errors of defect severity 4 are not device failures in the classical meaning. These errors do not affect the
device hardware and are not detected or reported by internal device supervision functions. The condition of
the defect severity 4 – the group alarm – is set user-specifically by the binary input signal (_:503) >Group
alarm. If the binary input signal is reset, the device is no longer in the Group alarm condition and all
functions return to the normal operating state.
If the group alarm is generated, the device reacts as follows:
•
The group indication (_:300) Group alarm is generated and recorded in the operational log.
•
The life contact is terminated.
•
The red Error LED is activated.
•
All protection and automation functions are blocked.
•
The device remains in operation, does not carry out any restart (reset), and does not switch to the safe
condition (Fallback mode).
•
The signals managed internally are marked with the invalid quality attribute. Signals managed inter-
nally are, for example, measured values, binary input and output signals, GOOSE and CFC signals.
In the delivery condition, every device has the CFC chart Process mode inactive, that initiates the Group
alarm (see chapter 8.9 Group Indications).

Group Monitoring Indication in the DIGSI 5 Information Routing Matrix
Group Indication Group Alarm
The indication (_:300) Group alarm is the group indication for defect severity 4 monitoring. This
monitoring has a special purpose, as it is set user-specifically by a binary input signal and not by internal
device supervision. Nevertheless, the response of the device is serious, such as blocking all protection and
automatic functions (refer to 8.8.5 Defect Severity 4 (Group Alarm)).
If the binary input signal (_:503) >Group Alarm is set, the group indication (_:300) Group alarm
becomes active. If the binary input signal (_:503) >Group Alarm is reset, the signal (_:300) Group
alarm is also reset and the device returns to the normal operating state.
In the delivery condition, every device has the CFC chart Process mode inactive that initiates the >Group
Alarm. This CFC chart checks whether the device is still accidentally in the simulation or commissioning
mode.
You can adapt the CFC chart as needed. You can find the CFC chart in the DIGSI 5 project tree under Name of
the device → Charts.
Group Indication Group Warning
The indication (_:301) Group warning is the group indication for defect severity 1 monitoring. Some
error messages of defect severity 1 are firmly linked to the signal (_:301) Group warning, others are
connected flexibly in the device delivery condition via a CFC chart. This assignment is described in chapter
8.8.2 Defect Severity 1.
In the delivery condition, every device has the CFC chart Group warning, that initiates the Group warning.

You can adapt the CFC chart as needed. You can find the CFC chart in the DIGSI 5 project tree under Name of
the device → Charts.
The group-warning indication (_:301) Group warning is prerouted to an LED of the base module.
Group Indication
The Group indication is exclusively for user-specific purposes. There is no internal device supervision
function that activates this indication. If the binary input signal (_:505) >Group indication is set,
the indication (_:302) Group indication becomes active and is recorded in the operational log. This
warning indication does not result in blocking a protection function. If the binary input signal is reset, the
signal (_:302) Group indication drops out. Using a CFC chart, you can define when the binary input
signal (_:505) >Group indication is to be set.

Overview of Functions
The measurands are recorded at the measuring points and forwarded to the function groups.
Within the function groups, further measurands are calculated from these measured values, which are
required for the functions of this function group. This is how, for example, the electric power is calculated
from the voltage and current measurands.
Measuring transducers are an exception as they already form various calculation parameters from the analog
current and voltage inputs themselves.
You can find basic instructions for recording and editing process data in 2.1 Embedding of Functions in the
Device.

Structure of the Function
Depending on the interconnection of the function groups, these can contain different measured-value groups.
2 typical function groups are displayed below.
Circuit-Breaker Function Group
The Circuit-breaker function group may contain the following measured values:
[dw_om_vls1, 1, en_US]
Inversion of Output-Related Measured and Statistical Values
The calculated, directional values in the operational measured values (power, power factor, energy and
minimum, maximum, and average values based on these) are normally defined as positive in the direction of
the protected object. This requires that the connection polarity for the used measuring points be correctly set
(see also parameter (_:8881:116) Neutr.point in dir.of ref.obj of the measuring point current,
3-phase). It is, however, possible, to set the "forward" direction for the protection functions and the positive
direction for the powers, etc., differently, for example, such that the active power consumption (from the
line to the busbar) is displayed positively. Then set the option reversed in the affected function groups at
the parameter P, Q sign. With the setting not reversed (default setting), the positive direction for the
powers etc. corresponds to the "forward" direction for the protection functions.
The affected values are given in detail in the chapters 9.3 Operational Measured Values - 9.5  Statistical
Values of the Primary System.

Operational Measured Values
Operational measured values are assigned to different function groups.
The values can be displayed as primary and secondary values and as percentage values. They are updated
every 180 ms.
i
i
NOTE
The update rate of the operational measured values differs from the update rate of the measured values
which are updated to the communication protocol.
The exact update rate of the measured values depends on the communication protocol used, but is at least
500 ms. Whether the communication protocol is running on the mainboard or on a communication module
is not relevant.
The frequency is calculated using the filter algorithm, which is derived from the voltage or current. The
voltage input has higher priority than the current input. If no voltage or current is present, the value will
contain the last valid frequency. – is displayed on the user interface.

User-Defined Metered Values
Function Description of Pulse-Metered Values
i
i
NOTE
You can define additional metered values through DIGSI for user-specific applications.
Use pulse meters; then you can define the respective metered values through DIGSI and set parameters for
them analogously to the energy values. You can read out the metered values on the display of the device or
via DIGSI.
Through settings, you can individually set how each pulse-metered value is processed:
•
Parameter Restore time
Hour-related point in time when the device will provide a metered value at the communication interface
for transmission. After this, the transfer takes place in accordance with the selected protocol.
Note: If the parameter is activated through a time setting, the parameter Restore interval will
automatically be deactivated.
•
Parameter Restore interval
Adjustable period in minutes until the first and every further transfer of the metered value to the
communication interface of the device. After this, it will be transferred in accordance with the selected
log.
Note: If the parameter is activated through a time setting, the parameter Restore time will automati-
cally be deactivated.
In addition, restoring can be triggered via a routable binary input ( >Restore trigger ) or via a logical
internal binary input. The rising edge of the binary input leads to restoring and thus to provision of the
metered value at the communication interface.
The counter pulse of any external/internal pulse generator is connected to the device via a routable binary
input ( >Pulse input ). If this does not deliver any plausible values, this can be signaled to the device via
another routable binary input ( >External error ).
In compliance with IEC 61850, in the event of an external error, the quality of the pulse-metered value
changes to the state Questionable. No more pulses are added as long as the external error persists. Once the
external fault condition has been cleared, pulses are added again.
The quality of the pulse-metered value remains Questionable until a new meter content is specified for the
pulse-metered value by:
- Confirmation of the current meter content via Setting
- Setting a new meter content
- Resetting the meter content to 0
•
Parameter Edge trigger
Through settings, you can select between counting only with a rising edge or with rising and falling
edges on the pulse input.
The pulse counter can be reset to 0. You can perform this resetting via the rising edge of a routable binary
input ( >Reset ) or via operation on the device.
To display the counting amount at the device display, use DIGSI to set the desired weighting of the counter
pulses, the unit of the metered value and a multiplication factor for every pulse generator. You can also assign
a user-specific name.
To do this, open the functional area Pulse-metered value in DIGSI information routing. (see Figure 9-2).
Select the metered value and enter the settings under Properties.

Measuring Transducers
Overview of Functions
Measuring transducers with an input rated at 20 mA can be used in the devices. 4 such inputs are available
as module ANAI-CA-4EL, which can be plugged into a communication module slot (for instance, port E or F).
Up to 4 such modules can be plugged in. Typically, slowly changing process variable such as temperature
or gas pressure are recorded with such 20-mA measured values and reported to the substation automation
technology.
Structure of the Function
The measuring-transducer blocks are embedded in the Analog units function group and contain input and
output channels that are configurable independently of each other.
[dw_strumu, 1, en_US]
Figure 9-4
Structure/Embedding of the Function
Function Description
The 20-mA inputs typically transmit a value which represents a physical quantity such as a temperature or a
pressure. Therefore, the device must contain a characteristic curve that assigns the physical quantity to the
20-mA value. If the parameter Range active is not activated (no x in the check box), the function operates
over the range -25.6 mA to +25.6 mA. The setting of the range for the scaled value goes from a usable range
of -25.6 mA to +25.6 mA. The following figure shows an example.

Characteristic Curve of a 20-mA Input (Example 1)
In this example, the measured value 0 mA means a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius and the measured value

General Functionality
Description
Logic
As the wear on the circuit breaker depends on the current amplitude and duration of the actual switching
action, including arc deletion, determination of the start and end criteria is important. The following general
functionality provides starting and further timing information to the different stages (methods).
The general functionality operates phase-selectively. The following figure shows the logic of the functionality
across stages.

Start Criterion for the Circuit-Breaker Wear Monitoring Function
The Circuit-breaker wear monitoring function starts when any of the following criteria is fulfilled:
•
Internal protection-function tripping signal from the function block Trip logic is received
•
Open command signal from the internal Control function is received.
•
Binary input signal >Start calculation is initiated, for example, from external.
•
Closed position signal of circuit breaker is going
This signal is derived form the circuit-breaker auxiliary contacts. In this way, opening the circuit-breaker

Logic Input Signals for Stages
As soon as the start criterion has been fulfilled, the timers of the parameterized opening time and break time
are started. With the parameter CB opening time, the time when the circuit-breaker pole begins to open is
defined. With the parameter CB break time, the time of the pole being open including the arc extinction is
defined. The following figure shows the relationship between these circuit-breaker times.
[dw_CB-time, 2, en_US]
Figure 9-12
Circuit-Breaker Times
In order to prevent an incorrect calculation in case of a circuit-breaker failure, the parameter Current
thresh. CB open is used to verify whether the current actually returns to 0 after 2 additional cycles.
Fundamental components are used for comparing the threshold values. When the current criterion fulfills the
requirement of the phase-selective logic release, the calculation and evaluation of the respective methods are
initiated.
End Criterion for the Circuit-Breaker Wear Monitoring Function
After calculation and evaluation have been completed, the end criterion of the circuit-breaker maintenance is
fulfilled. The Circuit-breaker wear monitoring function is ready for a new initiation.

Determination of Tripping Current and Breaking Current
Information on determining the tripping/breaking current can be found in chapter 9.7.7.1 Description.
Calculation of the Remaining Switching Cycles
The double logarithmic diagram provided by the circuit breaker manufacturer illustrates the relationship
between the permissible switching cycles and the tripping/breaking current; see the following graphic. In the
example, the circuit breaker with a tripping current of 10 kA can still be tripped about 1000 times.
2 points and their connecting line define the relationship between the switching cycles and the tripping
current. Point P1 is determined by the number of permissible switching cycles at rated operating current Irated.
Point P2 is determined by the maximum number of switching cycles at a rated short-circuit breaking current

Since a slope coefficient of m < -4 is technically not relevant, but could theoretically be the result of
incorrect settings, the slope coefficient is limited to -4. If a coefficient is smaller than -4, the exponential

When the Stage 2P method receives a logic release signal, the current number of switching cycles already
spent (compared to the number of switching cycles at rated operating current) will be calculated from
the tripping current determined. This value is deducted from the remaining lifetime (switching cycles). The
remaining lifetime is available as a statistical value. For better understanding, see the following example.
You can reset or predefine statistical values according to the specific application. On reset, the statistical
values change to 0 and not to the default setting 10 000.
The statistical value for the remaining switching cycles is calculated according to the following formula:

EXAMPLE
To calculate the remaining switching cycles of a circuit breaker, the following assumptions are made:
P1 (2.5 kA, 10 000)
P2 (50.0 kA, 50)
The circuit breaker has performed 100 disconnections with the rated operating current, 2 trips with the rated
short-circuit breaking current, and 3 trips with a tripping current of 10 kA. The remaining switching cycles at
rated operating current thus amount to:
[fo_CBW2P3, 1, en_US]
At rated operating current, 9465 switching cycles can still be performed.
Warning when Circuit Breaker Maintenance is Required
If the remaining switching cycles for one pole are below the threshold value, a phase-selective warning signal
is generated.

Wear Calculation
The I2t-method evaluates the wear of a circuit breaker based on the recorded measured values of the phase
currents during the arc duration. The duration of the arc is defined by the difference between the settings of
the 2 parameters CB break time and CB opening time (see also Figure 9-12). The stage determines
the end point of the arc by searching backwards for the point of zero crossing of the phase currents after
receiving the logic release signal. The squares of the residual currents during the arc are then integrated
phase-selectively. The integrals are related to the square of the rated operating current of the circuit breaker
as in the following formula with phase A as an example.

The stage for the monitoring of the circuit-breaker make time calculates the time between the circuit-breaker
closing command and the point in time when the current exceeds the Oper.current threshold. If
this threshold has not been exceeded after 2.5 times the value of the parameter CB make time, the
measurement is canceled and the output value Make time is set to 0 and marked with the quality invalid.
If at least one phase of the current has exceeded the parameter Oper.current threshold or the param-
eter Current thresh. CB open at the time of the circuit-breaker closing command, the measurement is
canceled and the output value Make time is marked with the quality invalid.
You can define 2 independent thresholds for the monitoring of the measured make time. When these
threshold values are exceeded, the corresponding outputs Warning 1 and Warning 2 are activated for
100 ms. These can be routed in the log.

General Notes
Various tests have to be performed for commissioning to warrant the correct function of the device.
For tests using secondary test equipment, make sure that no other measurands are locked in and trip and
close commands to the circuit breakers are interrupted, unless otherwise indicated.
Secondary tests can never replace primary tests because they cannot include connection faults. They can be
used to check the setting values.
Primary tests may be done only by qualified personnel who are familiar with the commissioning of protection
systems, with the operation of the system, and with safety regulations and provisions (switching, grounding,
etc.).
Switching operations also have to be performed for the commissioning. The described tests require that these
be capable of being performed safely. They were not conceived for operational checks.

Direction Test of the Phase Quantities (Current and Voltage
Connection)
The proper connection of the current and voltage transformer is checked with load current over the line to
be protected . For this, the line must be switched on. A load current of at least 0.1 Irated has to flow over the
line ; it should be ohmic to ohmic inductive. The direction of the load current has to be known. In case of
doubt, meshed and ring systems should be unraveled. The line remains switched on the for the duration of
the measurements.
The direction can be derived directly from the operational measured value. First make sure that the power
measured values correspond to the power direction. Normally, it can be assumed that the forward direction
(measuring direction) goes from the busbar toward the line.
Using the power measured values at the device or DIGSI 5, make sure that it corresponds to the power
direction:
•
P is positive if the active power flows in the line or protected object.
•
P is negative if the active power flows to the busbar or out of the protected object.
•
Q is positive if the inductive reactive power flows in the line or protected object.
•
Q is negative if the inductive reactive power flows to the busbar or out of the protected object.
If the power measured values have a different sign than expected, then the power flow is opposite the
current-direction definition. This can be the case, for example, at the opposite end of the line . The current-
transformer neutral point then points in the direction of the protected object (for example line).
If the values are not as expected, it may be due to a polarity reversal at the voltage connection.
As a final step, switch off the system.

Checking the Protection-Data Communication
Checking the Protection-Data Communication
If the devices are connected to one another via the protection interface and switched on, they contact each
other automatically. If, for example, device 1 recognizes device 2, the successful connection is indicated (see
next figure). Accordingly, each device signals to all devices that aProtection-data communication is available.
The following information is provided via the protection interfaces by the devices in the device combination:
•
Address of the device in the device combination
•
Circuit-breaker switch position (open/closed/undefined); only for protection interfaces of type 1
•
Availability of the protection-interface communication within the last minute, as percentage
Availability of the protection-interface communication within the last hour, as percentage
•
Signal-transit time in the transmission and reception direction of the telegrams between the local device
and the neighboring device
You can find this diagnostic data in DIGSI under the following menu structure:

If a connection is successfully established, the Status of topo recog. field shows the indication valid in DIGSI
5 (see Figure 10-1).
If 2 devices are parameterized incorrectly, the Status of topo recog. field shows the indication invalid (see
Figure 10-1).
In Figure 10-2 there is no protection-data communication between device 1 and device 2, that is, the protec-
tion interfaces 1 and 2 of device 1 do not receive data. The transmission of protection data is interrupted and
differential protection is ineffective. One reason for this can be a remote control with DIGSI via the protection
interface. In this case, the protection connection is interrupted and the connection is used exclusively for
DIGSI.
[sc_protcocol, 1, en_US]

Protection-Data CommunicationDeactivated
Directional Test
In the case of protection interfaces of type 1 and type 2, the complex phasors of the voltage and current meas-
uring point are exchanged between devices of one communication topology in order to be able to carry out a
directional test during commissioning, for example. DIGSI 5 depicts this in the form of a phasor diagram. You
can only route the measuring point to the protection interface. For 1 1/2 circuit-breaker layouts, a measuring
point can therefore be transferred and checked optionally. You can also check and test the 2nd measuring
point by rerouting. Furthermore, communication with DIGSI 5 can take place via the protection interface to
other devices of the constellation. For this purpose, the protection-interface connection is interrupted and
DIGSI 5 uses this connection for communication with the remote device.
²
After completing the remote connection by DIGSI 5, the system switches back over to protection commu-
nication.

Functional Test of the Thermal Overload Protection
Secondary Test
For the secondary test for the overload protection, note that all setting parameters refer to primary variables
of the protected object. The protection device takes the current-transformer ratio from the power-system data
and internally performs the adjustments to device rated variables. Take this behavior into account for the test.
²
Reset the thermal memory before repeating the test. This is possible, for example, via the binary input
indication >Reset thermal replica. If the function is reparameterized or is switched off, the
thermal replica is also reset.
Test without Preload and without Ambient Temperature
²
Test the operate time at 1.5 I/Irated
In the example, the following power-system data are assumed:
Irated = 483 A
Irated, transf.prim = 750 A
Irated, transf.sec = 1 A
The primary test current is 1.5 ⋅ 483 A = 724.5 A. This results in a secondary current of
724.5 A ⋅ 1 A/750 A = 0.966 A. A secondary current of 0.966 A must therefore be supplied.
²
Calculate the operate time with the following formula. Enter only primary variables here.
[fo_1_functional test tolp, 1, en_US]
²
Set the preload current Ipreload = 0. Take the K-factor (for example, 1.1) and the thermal time
constant (for example, 600 s or 10 min) from the setting parameters.
²
Test from the cold state.
²
At a current of 0.966 A supplied on the secondary side, the protection function must trip after 463 s.
Test with Preload and without Ambient Temperature
²
The rated object current (Ipreload = Irated, obj) flows at a preload of 1 (100 %).
²
In this case, supply 483 A ⋅ 1 A/750 A = 0.644 A.
After a finite time (greater than 5 τth), the stationary preload value sets in.
²
If you abruptly increase the supplied secondary current from 0.644 A to 0.966 A (1.5 I/Irated), the overload
protection trips after 110 s.
[fo_2_functional test tolp, 1, en_US]
Test without Preload and with Ambient Temperature
If you are using ambient-temperature recording, consider that the K-factor to be set relates to a parame-
terizable ambient temperature, that is, corresponding to the continuous maximum permissible current for
ambient temperature.

The integration of the protection function into the station must be tested in the real-life application. Because
of the multitude of possible applications and possible system configurations, the required tests cannot be
described here in detail.
i

NOTE
Always keep the local conditions, the station plans, and protection plans in mind.
i
i
NOTE
Siemens recommends isolating the circuit breaker of the tested feeder at both ends before starting the
tests. Line disconnector switches and busbar disconnector switches must be open so that the circuit
breaker can be operated without risk.
General Precautions
!
CAUTION
Tests on the local circuit breaker of the feeder cause a trip command to the output to the adjacent (busbar)
circuit breakers.
Noncompliance with the following measure can result in minor personal injury or material damage.
²
In a first step, interrupt the trip commands to the adjacent (busbar) circuit breakers, for example, by
disconnection of the corresponding control voltages.
For testing the circuit-breaker failure protection, it must be ensured that the protection (external protection
device or device-internal protection functions) cannot operate the circuit breaker. The corresponding trip
command must be interrupted.
Although the following list does not claim to be complete, it can also contain points, which have to be ignored
in the current application.
Test Modes
The device and the function can be switched to test mode. These test modes support the test of the function
in different ways:
Test Modes
Explanation
Device in test mode
This operating mode is relevant for the following tests:
1. Approach of current thresholds in the case of an external start: Supervi-
sion of the binary input signals in the case of an external start is disabled.
This setting allows a static activation of the starting signals in order to
approach the current threshold.
2. Check whether the issued trip commands actuate the corresponding
circuit breakers, because the device contacts are also actuated in the device
test mode.
CBFP function in test mode
(device is NOT in test mode)
This operating mode is important for function tests in which the generated
operate indications are NOT supposed to actuate the binary outputs.

NOTE

i
i
NOTE
In the mode Device in test mode, the operate indications generated by the function operate the binary
outputs.
The function must also be tested in its normal, switched-on condition.
Consider the following in this case:
²
The device contacts are actuated.
²
Binary input signal supervision (in the case of an external start) is enabled and blocks the function.
²
All indications generated are generated without test bit.
Circuit-Breaker Auxiliary Contacts
When circuit-breaker auxiliary contacts are connected to the device, they make an essential contribution to the
reliability of the circuit-breaker failure protection, provided that their settings are set accordingly.
²
Make sure that the correct assignment has been checked.
Internal Starting Conditions (Trip Command from Internal Protection Function)
The internal start can be tested by means of tripping a protection function, for example, the main protection
function of the device.
²
Check the settings for circuit-breaker failure protection. See also chapter 6.15.4 Application and Setting
Notes.
²
For the circuit-breaker failure protection to be able to pick up, a phase current (see current-flow criterion)
must be present. This can be generated by a device-internal test sequence (see description in the
Operating manual). It can also be a secondary test current.
²
Generate the trip for the protection function. This can be generated within the device by a test sequence
(see description in the Operating manual) or by creating corresponding secondary test values.
²
The trip command(s) and their time delay compared to the pickup, depending on the parameterization.
External Starting Conditions (Trip Command from External Protection Function)
If external protection devices are also able to start the circuit-breaker failure protection, the external starting
conditions require checking.
²
Check the settings for circuit-breaker failure protection.
See also chapter 6.15.4 Application and Setting Notes.
²
For the circuit-breaker failure protection to be able to pick up, a phase current (see current-flow criterion)
must be present. This can be generated by a device-internal test sequence (see description in the
Operating manual). It can also be a secondary test current.
²
Activate the binary input or inputs to which the start signal and possibly also the release signal for the
CBFP function are routed. This can be done in 2 ways:
– 1) Via internal test sequences
– 2) By controlling the binary input or inputs via an auxiliary voltage
²
Check the start input signal, and if available, check the enable input signal in the spontaneous or fault
messages.
²
Check the pickup indication in spontaneous or fault indications.

Start by Trip Command from the External Protection
²
Check the static and - in case of 2-channel operation - also the dynamic supervision of the binary input
signals. For this purpose, induce pickup of the supervision and check the supervision indications and the
ready signal in the event log buffer.
Start by Trip Command from the External Protection without Current Flow
²
If start is possible without current flow: (see Start by trip command from the external protection).
Repetition of the Local Tripping (T1)
²
Make sure that the trip repeat signal controls a 2nd circuit (2nd coil) for switching off the circuit breaker.
Backup Tripping in the Case of a Circuit-Breaker Failure (T2)
For tests in the station, it is important to check that the distribution of trip commands to the adjacent circuit
breakers in the case of a circuit-breaker failure is correct. The adjacent circuit breakers are all circuit breakers,
which must be tripped in order to ensure interruption of the short-circuit current if the feeder circuit-breaker
fails. They are therefore the circuit breakers of all feeders which feed the busbar or busbar section to which
the feeder with the fault is connected.
A general detailed test guide cannot be specified because the layout of the adjacent circuit breakers depends
largely on the system topology.
²
With multiple busbars, the trip distribution logic for the adjacent circuit breakers must be checked.
The test has to check for every busbar section that, in case of a failure of the feeder circuit-breaker under
observation, only those circuit breakers which are connected to the same busbar section are tripped.
Backup Tripping on Circuit-Breaker Failure (T2), Tripping of the Opposite End
If the trip command of the circuit-breaker failure protection must also trip the circuit breaker at the opposite
end of the tested feeder, the communication channel for this remote trip has to be tested as well.
²
It is practical to test the communication channel for the remote trip while transmitting other signals in
accordance with 10.3.1 Checking the Protection-Data Communication.
Termination
²
All temporary measures taken for testing must be undone, such as special switch positions, interrupted
trip commands, changes to setting values, or individually switched off protection functions.

Circuit-Breaker Test
The Circuit-breaker test function enables you to easily perform a complete test of the trip circuit, the closing
circuit, and the circuit breaker. For this, the circuit-breaker test carries out an automatic opening and closing
cycle or an only-open cycle of the circuit breaker during operation. You can also include a current-flow
criterion in the test. The effect of the current-flow criterion is to ensure the circuit-breaker test is only carried
out if the current flow across the circuit breaker is below the parametrizable threshold.

If a circuit-breaker auxiliary contact is connected, the function waits for the indication circuit breaker Posi-
tion = open after the trip command is generated. When the indication Position = open is received, the
close command is transmitted after a dead time (parameter (_:6151:101) Dead time) for an open-close
cycle. If the feedback from the circuit-breaker positions is not received within the maximum transmission time
(Dead time + 2 · Output time + 5 s), the circuit-breaker test is aborted and considered to be failed. The
proper functioning of the circuit breaker is monitored via the feedback on the circuit-breaker positions.

NOTE
The circuit-breaker test does not perform a synchrocheck even if the synchrocheck has been configured in
the protection-function groups for circuit breakers. This can cause stability problems in the system during
a 3-pole interruption. Therefore, a 3-pole circuit-breaker test should be very short, or not performed at all
under load.

Primary and Secondary Testing of the Synchronization Function
Measuring the Circuit-Breaker Make Time
Under asynchronous system conditions, the circuit-breaker make time must be measured and set correctly.
This achieves an exact parallel switching with a phase angle 0o. If switching occurs only in synchronous system
conditions, this section can be skipped.
The make time can be determined via the following 2 methods:
•
By reading from a fault record (recommended method)
•
With external timer
1. A simple option for determining the make time involves reading the time between the close command and
closure of the switch pole via the fault record. The time determined here is the real make time and not the
operating time of the circuit breaker. You do not have to add any further time.
Siemens recommends the following procedure:
²
Establish a condition in which the circuit breaker can be closed without hazard.
²
If V2 is switched through, activate the operating mode Close cmd. at V1< & V2> for the synchroni-
zation stage28 or by setting it to yes.
If V1 is switched through, activate the operating mode Close cmd. at V1> & V2<.
²
Make sure that the fault recorder is turned on. Via a temporary CFC chart, link the signal Release
close cmd. of the active synchronization stage to the binary input signal >Manual start (of the
fault recorder). With the release of closure, a fault record of the parameterized duration is set up (the
default setting of 500 ms is more than adequate for this).
²
Starting the synchronization stage. The device activates immediately.
²
Read the fault record and determine the make time via SIGRA (see Figure 10-8).
Use the 2 cursors and the time-measuring function for this. Position the first cursor on the raising close
command. The occurrence of the 2nd voltage signals the closed power-switching poles. Place the 2nd
cursor on the raising 2nd voltage.
²
Set the determined time with the parameter CB make time.
Proceed in the same way for all other synchronization stages.
²
Set the parameter Close cmd. at V1< & V2> or parameter Close cmd. at V1< & V2< back to
its source value.
²
Delete the CFC chart.

Connect the circuit breaker manually. The timer is started simultaneously by this. After the poles of the circuit
breaker close, the voltage VLine appears. The timer is then stopped.
If the timer is not stopped owing to an unfavorable closing moment, repeat the attempt.
Siemens recommends calculating the average value from several (3 to 5) successful switching attempts.

NOTE
Add the OOT (Output Operating Time) of the protected device to the measured time. The OOT exclusively
depends in good approximation on the binary output used for the close command. You can find the OOTs
for different binary outputs in 11 Technical Data. Set the total time with the parameter CB make time.
Proceed in the same way for all other synchronization stages used in the device.
Siemens recommends sending the close command via the hard-wired connection. If you use a GOOSE
signal to send the close command, consider the time delay caused by the GOOSE communication while
setting the parameter CB make time.

Check the functional measured values within the synchronization function:
– The delta values must be 0.
– Check the voltages V1 and V2 for plausible values in comparison with the operational measured values
for the voltage.
– Check the frequencies f1 and f2 for plausible values in comparison with the operational measured value
for the frequency.
b) As secondary test
²
Establish a synchronous state by applying synchronous voltage values at both measuring points.
²
Check the functional measured values within the synchronization function:
– The delta values must be 0.
– Check the voltages V1 and V2 for plausible values in comparison with the operational measured values
for the voltage.
– Check the frequencies f1 and f2 for plausible values in comparison with the operational measured value
for the frequency.
Blind Switching Attempts when Used in Machines
Perform blind switching attempts when using the function in machines.
Prerequisite:
²
You have checked the setting values again.
²
The circuit breaker is switched off. The close command for the circuit breaker is interrupted (discon-
necting the close command). The system voltage is switched through for the measurement.
a) Attempt with asynchronous systems:

C53000-G5040-C028-2, Edition 07.2024


²
Via manual control, set the generator to a speed slightly below the permitted frequency difference
according to the setting values Max. frequency diff. f2>f1 and Max. frequency diff.
f2<f1. The generator is excited to line voltage. You can read out the values in the operational measured
values.
²
Start the synchronization stage, for example, externally with binary input signal or via the integrated
controller. You can use a synchronoscope to trigger the start at synchronism, that is, at 12 o'clock. The
duration until the close command then corresponds to a cycle with the duration 1/Δf. At a frequency
difference of 0.1 Hz, the duration is thus 10 s.
²
Insofar as permissible, perform this attempt several time for oversynchronous switching and subsynchro-
nous switching.
²
The switching performance can be checked with an external recorder or the integrated fault recording
function. You have to start the fault recording explicitly.
²
You can repeat the blind switching attempts at the limits of the permissible voltage difference.
b) Attempt with synchronous systems:
²
Start the synchronization stage, for example, externally with binary input signal or via the integrated
controller.
²
Check the proper release for activation with the message log or via a fault record. You have to start
the fault recording explicitly. All activation conditions have to be fulfilled within the time Delay close
command.
If you observe the change between synchronous and asynchronous operation, raise the changeover
threshold f-threshold ASYN<->SYN slightly.
c) Attempt with synchrocheck:
²
If you use this function in conjunction with the manual synchronization, check the proper release for
closure.
²
Synchronize the generator manually. Start the synchronization stage externally via a binary input. Check
the proper release for closure with the indication log or via the fault record. You have to start the fault
recording explicitly.

Requirements for Phase-Current Transformers
The protection functions require current transformers that are dimensioned properly. This section describes
the characteristics required for the dimensioning of the current transformer. The specified rules pertaining
to dimensioning apply the definition of a protection current transformer from IEC 61869-2 (previ-
ously IEC 60044-1 and IEC 60044-6) as well as IEC TR 61869-100. Dimensioning according to ANSI C57.13 is
also described.

Definition of the Requirements for the Dimensioning of the Phase Current Transformer
The requirements for the phase current transformers predominantly arise from the high-current stage setting
values for the overcurrent protection system, the high-current stage being the current stage with the max.
threshold value. There are also minimum requirements that are derived from empirical values.

ACD
IEC 61850 data type: Directional protection activation information
ACK
Data transmission acknowledgment
ACT
IEC 61850 data type: Protection activation information
APC
Controllable analog set point information – information regarding a controllable analog value
ASDU
ASDU stands for Application Service Data Unit. An ASDU can consist of one or more identical information
objects. A sequence of the same information elements, for example measured values, is identified by the
address of the information object. The address of the information object defines the associated address of
the 1st information element of the sequence. A consecutive number identifies the subsequent information
elements. The number builds on this address in whole number increments (+1).
BAC
Binary controlled analog process value
Back-up battery
The back-up battery ensures that specified data areas, flags, timers, and numerator are held as retentive.
Bay controller
Bay controllers are devices with control and supervision functions without protection functions.
BCR
IEC 61850 data type: Binary counter reading
Best Master Clock Algorithm
A PTP network consists of communicating clocks. The best master clock algorithm (BMCA) is used to deter-
mine the device that indicates the most precise time. This device serves as a reference clock and is called the
grandmaster. In case of changes to the network topology, the BMC algorithm is performed again for network
segments which might be cut off from the grandmaster. If a participating device assumes the role of master
and slave at the same time, it is also referred to as a boundary clock.
Big-endian
The terms big-endian and little-endian are used to describe the arrangement of the bytes when saving. In
case of big-endian, the upper limiting value byte is saved at the lowest address. Little-endian saves the upper
limiting value byte at the highest address.

Binary Controlled Analog Process Value
The data type BAC models a command with or without feedback. The BAC is used to control an arc-suppres-
sion coil, for example. The commands Higher, Lower, and Stop can be issued. The process delivers an analog
value as feedback.
Binary Controlled Step Position
The data type BSC can, for example, be used to control a transformer tap changer. The commands up, down
can be given.
Bit pattern indication
Bit pattern indication is a processing function with which items of digital process information applicable across
several inputs can be detected together in parallel and further processed. The bit pattern length can be
selected as 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes.
BMCA
Best Master Clock Algorithm
Boundary clock
The PTP protocol recognizes different types of clock: An Ordinary Clock (OC), Boundary Clock (BC), and
Transparent Clock (TC). The boundary clock transmits time information beyond a network limit. For example
in a router which connects different switched power systems. As a slave, the clock of the router receives time
information and passes it on as a master.
BRCB
Buffered Report Control Block
BSC
Binary Controlled Step Position
Buffered Report Control Block
Buffered Report Control Block (BRCB) is a form of report controlling. Internal events trigger the immediate
sending of reports or saving of events for the transfer. Data values cannot therefore be lost on account
of transport flow control conditions or connection interruptions. BRCB provides the functionality SOE (see
sequence of events).
CB

Continuous Function Chart
Chatter blocking
A rapidly intermittent input (for example, due to a relay contact error) is switched off after a configurable
monitoring time and can thus not generate any further signal changes. The function prevents overloading of
the system when an error occurs.

Far End Fault Indication
Far End Fault Indication (FEFI) is a special setting of switches. It is always only possible to log a line interrup-
tion on the receive line. If a line interruption is detected, the link status of the line is changed. The status
change leads to deletion of the MAC address assigned to the port in the switch. However, outage of the
receive line from the aspect of the switch can only be detected in the receiver, that is, by the switch. The
receiver then immediately blocks the transmit line and signals the connection outage to the other device. The
FEFI setting in the switch triggers detection of the error on the receive line of the switch.

HSR Protocol
Like PRP (Parallel Redundancy Protocol), HSR (High-Availability Seamless Redundancy Protocol) is specified in
IEC 62439-3. Both protocols offer redundancy without switching time.
The principal function can be found in the definition of PRP. With PRP, the same message is sent via 2
separated networks. In contrast to this, in the case of HSR the message is sent twice in the 2 directions of the
ring feeder. The receiver receives it correspondingly via 2 paths in the ring feeder, takes the 1st message and
discards the 2nd message (see PRP protocol).
Whereas NO messages are relayed in the end device in the case of PRP, a switch function is installed in the HSR
node. Thus, the HSR node relays messages in the ring feeder that are not directed at it.

Parallel Redundancy Protocol
Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP) is a redundancy protocol for Ethernet networks that is specified in
IEC 62439-3. Unlike conventional redundancy procedures, such as RSTP (Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol,
IEEE 802.1D-2004), PRP offers uninterruptible switchover, which avoids any downtime in the event of an
error, and thus the highest availability.
PRP is based on the following approach: The redundancy procedure is generated in the end device itself.
The principle is simple: The redundant end device has 2 Ethernet interfaces with the same address (DAN,
Double Attached Node). Now the same message is sent twice, in the case of PRP (parallel) over 2 separate
networks, and unambiguously marks both with a sequence number. The receiver takes the information that it
receives first, stores its ID based on the source address and the sequence number in a duplicate filter and thus
recognizes the 2nd, redundant information. This redundant information is then discarded. If the 1st message
is missing, the 2nd message with the same content comes via the other network. This redundancy avoids a
switching procedure in the network and is thus interruption-free. The end device relays no messages to the
other network. Since the process is realized in the Ethernet layer (same MAC address), it is transparent and
usable for all Ethernet user data protocols (IEC 61850, DNP, other TCP/IP based protocols). In addition, it is
possible to use one of the 2 networks for the transmission of non-redundant messages.
There are 2 versions of PRP: PRP-0 and its successor PRP-1. Siemens implements PRP-1.

Sampled value
Sampling is the registration of measured values for discrete, mostly equidistant periods of time. This can be
used to extract a discrete time signal from a continuous time signal.
Sampling rate

SIM
Simulation data format for single/multiple devices
Simulation Data Format for Single/Multiple Devices
You can export simulation-related files of a SIPROTEC 5 device in SIM format. This new functionality in DIGSI 5
makes it possible to export the simulation data and to create a simulation of all devices in the DIGSI 5 project
for testing and commissioning purposes. The simulation is achieved by importing the simulation file into a
signal processing and automation system, which then simulates the device/devices using the process data like
in a real-time system. This feature allows a device to be tested for various real-time conditions.
Single command
Single commands (SPC – Single Point Control) are process outputs which represent 2 process states (for
instance on/off) at one output.
Single-Line Diagram
A single-line diagram (SLD) is a simplified electrical overview diagram of the switchgear. Instead of all 3
phases, only a single line is shown, hence the name single-line.
Single-Line Editor
The Single-Line Editor (SLE) contains the catalog with the topological elements of a single-line diagram. Using
the Single Line Elements, the customer can configure the topological part of their plant.
Single-point indication
Single-point indications (SPS) are a type of process information which represents 2 process states (for instance
on/off) at one output.
SIPROTEC
The registered trademark SIPROTEC designates the product family of Siemens protection devices and fault
recorders.
SIPROTEC 5 Device
This object type represents a real SIPROTEC device with all the contained setting values and process data.
Slave Device
A slave may only exchange data with a master after being prompted to do so by the master. SIPROTEC devices
work as slaves. A master computer controls a slave computer. A master computer can also control a peripheral
device.

Substation Configuration Description
A substation configuration description is an IEC 61850-compliant file for data exchange between the system
configurator and the IED configurator. The substation configuration description contains information on the
network structure of a substation. The substation configuration description contains for example, information
on the assignment of the devices to the primary equipment, as well as on the station-internal communication.
Substation Configuration Description Language
SCL is a description language standardized in IEC 61850 and based on XML. This description language allows
all information relevant to an IEC 61850 substation to be documented consistently. This format is therefore
suitable for exchanging IEC 61850-specific data between different applications, even if these come from
different manufacturers. The described import checks are generally carried out for all SCL formats, not only for
SCD imports.
SUP
The Slave Unit Protocol (SUP) network protocol is used for communication between the RTD unit (temperature
relays that measure the temperature of up to 12 sensors and provide the data to an RS485 interface for
external evaluation) and the SIPROTEC 5 device.
SV Stream
Sampled Value Stream
The SV stream is a set of current and voltage values that are transmitted in a fast and cyclical fashion.
Information exchange is based on a publisher/subscriber mechanism. SV transmission is a continuous stream
of Layer 2 Ethernet diagrams in one direction. The content of an SV stream can be configured in anyway you
wish in accordance with IEC 61869-9. IEC 61850-9-2 LE defines a fixed set of 4 voltage and 4 current values
for each SV stream.
System Exchange Description
With files in SED format, you can exchange interface information between DIGSI 5 projects and thus between
substations. To do this, the project extracts the data for the other projects from the file during import and
writes its own data in the same file during export. The contents of an SED file are formulated in SCL.
System Specification Description
Files in SSD format contain the complete specification of a substation automation system including a single
line configuration of the substation. The assignment of logical nodes from IEC 61850 to primary equipment
can also be described in SSD files. This allows device requirements to be defined in the SSD file so that the
devices can be used in the substation. The contents of an SED file are formulated in SCL.
TAI
Temps Atomique International - International atomic time
TC
Tap-position command
TCP
Transmission Control Protocol
TEA-X
You can archive the data from individual SIPROTEC 5 devices or whole projects in TEA-X format. This format is
also suitable for data exchange between different applications, such as DIGSI 5 and Engineering Base (EB). The
TEA-X format is based on XML.

Time stamp
A time stamp is a value in a defined format. The time stamp assigns a point in time to an event, for example,
in a log file. Time stamps ensure that events can be found again.
TOCT
Trench Optical Current Transformer – Optical current transformer, manufactured by Trench
Topological View
The topological view is oriented to the objects of a plant (for example, switchgear) and their relationship
to one another. The topological view describes the structured layout of the plant in hierarchical form. The
topological view does not assign the objects to the devices.
Transmission Control Protocol
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transmission protocol for transport services in the Internet. TCP
is based on IP and ensures connection of the participants during the data transmission. TCP ensures the
correctness of the data and the correct sequence of the data packets.
Transparent clock
The PTP protocol recognizes different types of clock: A standard clock (referred to as Ordinary Clock, OC
for short), a Boundary Clock (BC) and a Transparent Clock (TC). The transparent clock was integrated in the
specification retrospectively in 2008 and serves to improve the transmission of time information within a
network by receiving PTP messages and modifying (correcting) them before passing them on.
Tree view
The left section of the project window displays the names and icons of all containers of a project in the form of
a folder tree structure. This section is called the tree view.
Tunneling
Technology for connecting two networks via a third network, whereby the through traffic is completely
isolated from the traffic of the third network.
UDP
User Datagram Protocol
Unbuffered Report Control Block
Unbuffered Report Control Block (URCB) is a form of report controlling. Internal events trigger the immediate
sending of reports based on best effort. If no association exists or if the transport data flow is not fast
enough, events can be lost.
URCB
Unbuffered Report Control Block
USART
Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
User Datagram Protocol
UDP is a protocol. The protocol is based on IP as TCP. In contrast to this, however, UDP works without a
connection and does not have any safety mechanisms. The advantage of UDP in comparison to IP is the higher
transmission rate.
