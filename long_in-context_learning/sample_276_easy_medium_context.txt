Device Description
Overview
The SICAM Fault Collector Gateway (FCG) device receives both distribution line faults and the load current
values from the SICAM Fault Sensor Indicator (FSI) via short-range radio (SRR) communication. The received
current measured values and status are transmitted to the control center/MindSphere cloud based on the
selected communication protocol.
SICAM FCG is available in multiple variants and provides variant specific hardware functionalities. Refer to
Table 1-1 for more information.
SICAM FCG provides 6 binary inputs and 3 binary outputs. SICAM FCG can be configured and diagnosed locally
using the Web GUI by connecting to a PC or laptop computer or remotely via General Packet Radio Service
(GPRS).
SICAM FCG must be mounted inside a housing which can comply with standard IP54 or IP65. The Global
System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and short-range radio antennas must be mounted outside the
housing. Installation distance between short-range and GSM antennas must be atleast 30 cm (centre to centre
distance) to avoid interference.
SICAM FCG Web GUI allows you to configure the parameters, display error and event log, upgrade of firmware,
and download the configuration.
The following table provides a snapshot of SICAM FCG variant wise functionalities.

Following sections describe about interfaces and modules for the functions mentioned in Figure 1-1.
Binary Interfaces
On the terminal block L, all the 3 binary inputs are independent and have a fixed threshold of 8 V. On the
terminal block P, 2 binary inputs have a common input (P8, P9, and P10), 1 binary input (P11, P12) which is
independent. These binary inputs have selectable thresholds of DC 19 V, DC 88 V and DC 176 V.
Therefore an optimal adjustment to the pickup voltage can be made in the case of increased interference
level.
The binary outputs are designed as relay contacts. The terminal block P has 2 relay outputs - Normally Open
(NO) and 1 relay output Change Over (CO). The relays can switch voltages up to AC/DC 250 V and currents up
to AC/DC 5 A.
Communication
SICAM FCG is a gateway device between the SICAM FSIs and control center/MindSphere cloud. It provides
interfaces and supports communication protocols to the SICAM FSIs (via short-range radio) and to the control
center/MindSphere Cloud. The gateway contains an interworking function for the communication exchanged
between SICAM FSIs and the control center/MindSphere cloud.
Various communication interfaces and protocols are available for the communication between SICAM FCG and
control center/MindSphere cloud.
The communication interfaces support the device parameterization and the transmission of messages and
measured values. The information is transmitted in telegrams in a secured way.
SICAM FCG can communicate with either control center or MindSphere cloud at any given time. Simultaneous
communication of SICAM FCG with control center and MindSphere cloud is not possible.
Ethernet Port Interface
SICAM FCG has an Ethernet interface which supports the device parameterization and monitoring.
The Ethernet interface can also support communication to the control center based on the telecontrol proto-
cols IEC 60870-5-104 or DNP3 via an external router. Refer to 5.5 SICAM FCG Applications Connected to the
Utility Private Network Using an External Router for application details.
GSM/GPRS Module
The GSM module1 supports 4 frequency bands: 850 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 1900 MHz.
The communication to the control center can be executed based on the telecontrol protocols IEC 60870-5-104
or DNP3 via GSM/GPRS networks.
The communication to the MindSphere cloud is established by MindConnect Library (MCL) via GPRS
networks.2
You can execute the configuration, firmware update and perform diagnosis using SICAM FCG Web GUI via
GPRS.
Short-Range Radio Module
The short-range radio module1 communicates directly with SICAM FSI via a radio link in the license-free
2400-MHz band and up to 100 meters. Any overhead distribution line fault or other status change detected by
SICAM FSI is communicated to the SICAM FCG through the short-range radio module.
1
The distance between SICAM FCG (along with GSM and SRR antennas) and SICAM FSI must be less than or equal to 100 m (line of
sight). The GSM antenna (MLFB: 6MD2318-0CA10) and Short-range radio antenna (MLFB: 6MD2318-0CA20) are tested along with
SICAM FCG.
2
The MindConnect Library is a collection of functionalities which allows a client application to connect and exchange data with
MindSphere. The connection to MindSphere is secured by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) in order to
protect client's transferred data.

SICAM FCG Conditions and Recommendations for Secure System
Operation
Siemens recommends providing the following conditions and complying with the recommendations for safe
operation:
General Recommendations applicable for all use cases
•
To avoid unauthorized access, the SICAM FCGs must be installed in a lockable housing.
•
Make sure that the installation is vandalism-proof.
•
The configuration and maintenance of the SICAM FCG must be performed by trained and authorized
personnel only.
•
Replace all factory-set passwords of the SICAM FCG by individual passwords. These passwords must be
accessible only for persons authorized to configure and maintain the devices.
•
Store the SICAM FCG configuration data and firmware images in secure backup server.
•
Connect a PC or laptop computer to the Ethernet interface of the SICAM FCG when you configure,
maintain, and monitor the device. Connect this port to a protected LAN only. This port must not be
accessible from a public communication network (Internet).
Communication with control center using built-in GPRS modem3
•
Siemens strongly recommends using IPSec for the communication via mobile network. The communica-
tion via public networks (public APN of a mobile network provider, Internet) without IPSec is a consider-
able security risk.
•
Siemens recommends the following authentication and encryption parameters for IPSec:
–
AES-128, AES 192 or AES-256
–
SHA1
–
Diffie-Hellman Group 2
–
Perfect Forward Secrecy enabled
DES and MD5 are a security risk and must be used only for interoperability with the IPSec peer device.
•
Siemens recommends using IKEv2 instead of IKEv1. With IKEv2, use individual pre-shared keys per IPSec
tunnel. (With IKEv1, this is not possible for technical reasons).
Siemens recommends configuring the VPN client IP address (that is, the IP address with which the
SICAM FCG communicates through the IPSec tunnel) in a different subnetwork from that of the Ethernet
interface of SICAM FCG.
Communication with MindSphere cloud service or third party cloud service using built-in GPRS modem3
•
Store the client key/certificate, decryption PIN, and root CA certificate in secure backup server.
Communication with control center and/or cloud service using an external router
In addition to above recommendations, following recommendations apply for this use case:
•
Siemens recommends manually hardening the external router used for wireless connectivity to control
center or cloud. This is achieved by disabling unused interfaces, unused services, and unused manage-
ment protocols in router configuration.
•
Siemens recommends ensuring up-to-date vulnerability and patch management of external modem via
regular firmware updates.
•
Siemens recommends enabling strong authentication for router configuration tool.

Overview
SICAM FCG acts as a gateway device for the communication between SICAM FSI sensor devices and control
center/MindSphere cloud. SICAM FCG exchanges the information with SICAM FSIs by using the proprietary
message-based protocol via short-range radio communication. SICAM FCG communicates with the control
center by using the standard bus protocol, for example, IEC 60870-5-104 or DNP3 via the mobile network or
Ethernet. SICAM FCG communicates with MindSphere cloud by using the MindConnect Library (MCL) protocol.
SICAM FSIs are clipped on an overhead medium-voltage line to detect the phase and ground faults. The
detected fault messages are sent to SICAM FCG via short-range radio communication. SICAM FCG stores the
received information and then forwards it to the control center/MindSphere Cloud via the mobile network or
Ethernet.
SICAM FSI transmits the current measured values and status information periodically to SICAM FCG. This infor-
mation is stored in the SICAM FCG and sent to control center/MindSphere cloud. When the communication
to control center/MindSphere cloud is interrupted, then the events get buffered in SICAM FCG. Once the
communication is restored, these events get sent to control center/MindSphere cloud.
SICAM FCG is used in the SICAM FSI parameterization and firmware update. The SICAM FSI parameter values
and SICAM FSI firmware file are updated to SICAM FCG via SICAM FCG web GUI and via MindSphere cloud
using SICAM Localizer application. The parameter values and firmware files are uploaded to SICAM FSI devices
via short-range radio communication.
SICAM FCG communicates with 3, 6, or 9 SICAM FSIs depending on the configuration. Before starting the
short-range radio communication, assign SICAM FSIs to the SICAM FCG. The device assignment is done by
scanning the QR code on the SICAM FSIs label. After scanning the QR code, copy the QR code to the corre-
sponding QR code parameter field in the SICAM FCG web GUI. This device-assignment procedure ensures that
SICAM FSI communicates always with the intended SICAM FCG even if multiple SICAM FCG devices are located
in the same geographical area and are reachable from SICAM FSI via short-range radio communication. The
device assignment establishes the relation between a particular SICAM FSI and its logical representation (FSI1
to FSI 9) visible in the SICAM FCG and in control center/MindSphere cloud.
[dw_fcg_overview-mcl, 1, en_US]
Figure 4-1
SICAM FCG - SICAM FSI Communication Overview
For the battery-power savings reasons, the short-range radio communication does not run permanently and
it runs based on the SICAM FSIs demand. The communication is always started by the SICAM FSI. If SICAM
FSI starts the communication for the first time or if SICAM FSI was reset, it communicates with SICAM FCG
via a short-range radio communication and requests to upload the active SICAM FSI parameter values stored
in SICAM FCG. SICAM FSI starts the communication either in an event-driven way for transmitting the fault
information or periodically for sending the measured values and state information. The communication is
closed after the SICAM FSI and SICAM FCG exchanged all the available information at a certain time.
The radio transmitter and receiver (transceiver) of the SICAM FSI are switched off when the device is not
communicating. This transceiver state is termed as SLEEPING. SICAM FSI is not able to receive the information
from SICAM FCG when the radio transceiver is in the SLEEPING mode. The command requests, parameter
values, and firmware updates are buffered in SICAM FCG and sent to SICAM FSI after the communication is

established for the next time. It results in an information forwarding delay from SICAM FCG to SICAM FSIs. The
maximum delay equals to the short-range radio reporting time which can be configured in the SICAM FCG web
GUI.
The short-range radio communication uses state-of-the-art authentication and encryption methods. 128-bit
encryption method is used for short range communication between SICAM FCG and SICAM FSI. SICAM FSIs
authenticate to SICAM FCG during the association procedure. It is ensured that only authorized devices can
communicate with SICAM FCG via the short-range radio interface. The radio communication information
exchange is encrypted and cannot be interfered and manipulated by an unauthorized provider. The authenti-
cation and encryption does not need any special configuration or provisioning at SICAM FCG and SICAM FSI.

Parameterizing the SICAM FSI
Before powering on the SICAM FSI, configure the SICAM FSI parameters in the SICAM FCG Web GUI. When
SICAM FSI is powered on, it searches and automatically attempts to connect with SICAM FCG which contains
the parameter configuration.
Activation of the SICAM FSI occurs once the battery isolation has been disengaged and reset is initiated by
using the magnet.
Before proceeding, refer to 14.1.3 SICAM FSIs for the setting range of all the SICAM FSI parameters.
To configure the SICAM FSI parameter, proceed as follows:
•
In the SICAM FCG Web GUI, navigate to the Configure tab → Operational parameters → Process
connections →FSIs.

SICAM FSI Event Indications
SICAM FSI sends the event indications to SICAM FCG via a short-range radio communication when it detects
any state changes. The defined events are:
•
Presence or absence of phase-to-phase voltage
•
SICAM FSI low-battery
•
Fault condition
SICAM FCG stores the received event with a time stamp in the operational log.
When the communication protocol connection is established, SICAM FCG sends the received event indications
to control center/MindSphere cloud.

SICAM FSI Fault Clearance
SICAM FSI periodically monitors the current flow in the medium-voltage overhead line and indicates and
records the event when a fault is detected. The fault is indicated by flashing of LEDs and sent as an event to
the SICAM FCG.
The SICAM FSI fault can be cleared from the control center via the communication protocol. SICAM FCG sends
the fault-clearance request to SICAM FSIs in the next communication.
SICAM FSI initiates the communication when it wakes up and confirms the fault clearance. SICAM FCG sends
the fault-clearance indication to the control center once the fault-clearance confirmation is received from the
SICAM FSI.

Communication Test Mode
The communication test mode is used to check the quality parameters of the short-range radio communica-
tion.
The communication test mode can be started for a specific SICAM FSI or for all SICAM FSIs via the SICAM FCG
Web GUI. In the test mode, the SICAM FCG and SICAM FSI exchange the messages every 5 s.
Once the test mode is started, SICAM FCG waits until the corresponding SICAM FSI wakes up in the next
communication time frame.
The test mode is stopped via SICAM FCG Web GUI or after a defined duration of 1 hour. Once the test mode is
completed, the short-range radio communication is closed. At the end of the test mode, the short-range radio
communication module goes to sleep mode.

Device
i
i
NOTE
The application SICAM FCG Connected to Public Mobile Network with IPSec in Device is applicable for
6MD2340-3JM7x-8AA2 only.
The SICAM FCG with built-in GPRS modem is connected to a mobile network. The GPRS modem communicates
with a control center which is connected to the private communication network of the utility. In most cases,
the communication crosses 1 or several public Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. There is a specific
gateway node at the border between the mobile and the ISP network which is named Gateway GPRS Support
Node (GGSN) in GSM/GPRS networks. Among other things, this node serves for the following:
•
Assigning the mobile-network side IP address to the device
•
Providing a firewall
•
Providing a Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality from case to case
Furthermore, there is usually an edge router and/or firewall device at the border of the private network of the
utility to the ISP network.
In most mobile networks, data connections are always established by the mobile device to the peer in the
network. Connections are not initiated from the mobile-network side towards the mobile device. However,
but the IEC 60870-5-104 and DNP3 protocol connection (and the underlying TCP/IP connection) is established
always from the control center to the SICAM FCG device. Since the SICAM FCG is not aware about the point
in time where the control center will start the IEC 60870-5-104 and DNP3 protocol connection, it establishes
the mobile data connection immediately after device startup and keeps it running all the time. Furthermore,
SICAM FCG supervises the mobile data connection permanently and re-establishes it as soon as possible after
interruption.
An important aspect is the communication security. The data communication is authenticated and encrypted
in the mobile network but in most cases, the encryption is relatively weak. Enable IEC 60870-5-104 and DNP3
protocols via IPSec tunnel to achieve authenticated and encrypted communication. The IEC 60870-5-104
and DNP3 protocols itself (in the fashion without TLS/SSL as currently supported) does not provide security
capabilities.

In this application, the SICAM FCG establishes a VPN tunnel based on IP Security (IPSec) protocol towards a
VPN gateway at the border of the utility between public and private network. This tunnel is set up immediately
after mobile data connection establishment. Similar to the mobile data connection, the tunnel will be running
all the time, supervised, and re-established after failure by the SICAM FCG.
The IPSec tunnel fulfills the following 2 main tasks:
•
First, it provides authentication, encryption, and integrity protection to the communication protocol
running inside the tunnel via public networks.
•
Second, the SICAM FCG becomes visible in the private communication network of the utility by help of
the VPN tunnel. It is transparent to the control center where the SICAM FCG is not located in the area of
the communication network of the utility but the data communication is crossing public networks. This
is achieved by encapsulation, where the original IP packets containing protocol data units are embedded
into outer IP packets and this way are sent through the public networks. SICAM FCG is accessible via a
static IP address from the private address range of the utility. This private IP address is configured within
the SICAM FCG and the control center, and used as a destination IP address within the IEC 60870-5-104
or DNP3 communication from control center to SICAM FCG.
The mobile network providers assigns dynamic, private IP addresses to end devices. The Network Address
Translation (NAT) and firewal at the border of the mobile network provider network and the internet service
provider (ISP) network. This makes the mobile devices unreachable for new TCP or other types of connections
from outside the mobile network provider networks. The permanent VPN tunnel established by SICAM FCG
overcomes this situation and makes the devices accessible. The permanent VPN tunnel is not used to provide
end-to-end security.
With IPSec enabled in the device, communication using IoT protocols that is MindConnect protocol and MQTT
JSON PubSub is not supported.

Figure 5-2
Application Scenario where SICAM FCG is Connected to Virtual Private Mobile Network,
without IPSec in Device
This application scenario shows a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution in the network of a mobile operator.
Such mobile VPN solutions are based on private APNs and are offered by mobile network operators or
service providers by contract for example for wireless remote access to corporate networks and for machine-
to-machine communication. The mobile equipment of the customer company is handled in a closed user
group within the mobile network forming this way a Virtual Private Network. The assignment of IP addresses
to the mobile equipment can be done according to the requirements of the customer company. The VPN in
the mobile network can be connected to the network of the customer company via single or redundant VPN
tunnels bridging the security gap in ISP networks.
In the discussed application, the GGSN in the mobile network assigns a static and private IP address from the
address scope of the utility to the SICAM FCG. This IP address will be configured within the control center also.
The connection from the control center runs through the VPN tunnel and the virtual private mobile network to
the SICAM FCG.
The SICAM FCG itself does not establish a VPN tunnel in this application. The advantage is that a deployment
with multiple SICAM FCG does not need to support a corresponding number of VPN tunnels towards the VPN
gateway. The disadvantage is that this solution relies on the authentication and encryption in the mobile
network. Furthermore, this set up requires a special contract with a mobile operator or service provider and is
not end-to-end security.
Parallel communication of SCADA and cloud protocol is not supported over 2G network via internal mobile
communication.

SICAM FCG Connected to MindSphere Cloud Service
SICAM FCG can communicate with MindSphere cloud via GPRS or using an external router. For successful
registration of SICAM FCG with MindSphere cloud, valid Mindsphere Root CA Certificate and On Boarding Key
must be uploaded in the device via WebGUI over Ethernet port.
Once the upload is successful, the SICAM FCG onboards to the MindSphere using the On Boarding Key. SICAM
FCG requires an access token in order to use any services offered by MindSphere. MindSphere grants access
tokens to clients using Auth 2.0 authorization protocol. Once the registration is successful, SICAM FCG sends

SICAM FCG Onboarding to Electrification X Cloud
This section provides a detailed overview of the recommended procedure for securely onboarding the SICAM
FCG onto the Electrification X cloud platform.
i
i
NOTE
The procedure outlined in this section involves the utilization of SICAM GridPass for the generation of
the Root Certificate Authority (CA) and the device certificate, which are essential for establishing a secure
connection between the SICAM FCG and the Electrification X cloud MQTT broker. Alternatively, these
certificates can also be generated using OpenSSL or any other suitable third-party tool.
The following diagram illustrates the necessary certificate management process.
[sc_fcg_certificatemanagementprocess, 1, --_--]
Figure 6-9
Certificate Management Process
With SICAM GridPass you can easily generate a device certificate which includes all needed information for
SICAM FCG.
To establish the mandatory end-to-end encryption (TLS) between SICAM FCG and the MQTT Broker of the
Electrification X cloud platform, the following steps are required:
•
Create a root certificate authority (CA) and share with Electrification X.
•
Create and upload the device certificate to the SICAM FCG Web GUI, ensuring it includes both the public
and private key.
•
Import root certificate authority (CA) of the Electrification X cloud platform and upload to SICAM FCG
Web GUI.
For comprehensive instructions on executing the aforementioned steps, please refer to the detailed informa-
tion provided in the following sections.
Creating a Root Certification Authority (CA)
A root certificate authority (CA) is necessary for the later creation of the public-key certificates. The root CA
will be imported into Electrification X. The derived public key certificates will be used with SICAM FCG to
establish a secure authenticated and encrypted communication with the Electrification X suite. Electrification
X checks if the SICAM FCG certificates are derived from a CA that is imported in its trusted partner list.
This step is only necessary if no root certificate has been created yet, or none of the existing root certificates
should be used.

SICAM FSI Parameterization
Parameterizing the SICAM FSI
Before powering on the SICAM FSI, configure the SICAM FSI parameters in the SICAM FCG Web GUI. When
SICAM FSI is powered on, it searches and automatically attempts to connect with SICAM FCG which contains
the parameter configuration.
Activation of the SICAM FSI occurs once the battery isolation has been disengaged and reset is initiated by
using the magnet.
Before proceeding, refer to 14.1.3 SICAM FSIs for the setting range of all the SICAM FSI parameters.
To configure the SICAM FSI parameter, proceed as follows:
•
In the SICAM FCG Web GUI, navigate to the Configure tab → Operational parameters → Process
connections →FSIs.
•
Go to FSI settings.
•
For Expert mode select Yes. Refer to 6.5 SICAM FCG and SICAM FSI Commissioning using SICAM FCG
Web GUI for more details on Expert mode.
•
Select the Power frequency from the list box.
•
Select the Rated voltage (Vrated) from the list box.
•
Select the Enabled FSIs from the list box.
The number of FSIs that can be enabled are 3, 6, and 9.
•
Enter the Latitude and Longitude values.
Once the above parameters are configured, Go to FSI specific settings
•
Enter the Feeder Name, Group Name and Phase Info.
•
Select the required values for the following parameters from the list box.
–
Rated current (Irated)
–
Current threshold
–
Fault-indication time
–
Wireless data reporting time
–
Permanent fault-verification time
–
DI current
–
Inrush restraint time
–
Auto reclosure retries
–
Cable type
•
Enter the Auto reclosure time and Cable diameter
Click Send to save the changed parameters.
Go to Configure tab → Finish configuration → Activation, to enter the Password and click Activation.
The updated parameters are saved in SICAM FCG and communicated to the respective SICAM FSIs on the next
communication time frame.
For example, the SICAM FSI communicates with SICAM FCG during the voltage detection, fault indication,
fault reset, self test, and magnet reset.

NOTE
•
Time synchronization via NTP is recommended for all date and time relevant processes.
•
If the time synchronization for the device is via NTP, then time-synchronization → source time
synchronization parameter must be set to NTP. In this scenario, if the DNP3 protocol is used then the
DNP3 time synchronization must be disabled (DNP3 Enable time sync = No), refer to 7.8.5.2 Editing
the Communication Protocol DNP3 Settings.
•
If the time synchronization for the device is via DNP3, then time-synchronization → source time
synchronization parameter must be set to Internal.
•
IEC 60870-5-104 implementation in the device does not support time synchronization. In this
scenario, NTP or the internal real-time clock must be used for time synchronization.
•
When MindConnect protocol is used, the time synchronization for the device must be done only using
NTP. Time synchronization using Internal must not be used.

delay starts when the first measured-value changes occurs. All of the following measured value changes, occurring within the time
delay are sent together in a spontaneous measured-value telegram after the expiration of time delay. If a measured value changes
several times within this time, then only the last modification of this measured value is transmitted.

Master station IP Address configuration
Siemens recommends to configure unique IP address for all configured connections including redundant
connections. This will ensure that the corresponding connections are getting connected to the correct master
station.
By Default, connections 1 to 2 will be kept enabled with IP Address 0.0.0.0 and connections 3 to 8 will be
disabled with IP Address 255.255.255.255. Required connections can be enabled by configuring the IP address
to master station address.
SICAM FCG allows any IEC104 incoming connection when IP address is configured as 0.0.0.0. All IPs config-
ured as 0.0.0.0 by default shall be modified to the corresponding master station IP address.
All unused connections can be configured with IP 255.255.255.255. This will ensure that those unused
connections do not get connected to any incoming IEC104 connections.

Communication - DNS Server 
When using the mobile communication, the DNS server IP addresses are usually provided by the mobile
network operator. In such case, you can enter the address of NTP servers, IPSec peers, or the mobile ping
supervision hosts as full qualified domain names (FQDN) instead of fixed IP address. This setting happens
automatically and the configuration of DNS is not required.
Alternatively, you can select to use explicitly defined DNS servers. In this case, public or private DNS servers
can be used till it is reachable via the mobile network. Further, DNS servers in the utility communication
network can be used via VPN. The 2 DNS servers can be defined in order to facilitate the server redundancy.
The DNS server 2 must be located in the same network as DNS server 1 (Internet or VPN).

²
Set Mobile enabled to Yes for enabling mobile communication within SICAM FCG.
Configure the parameters according to the information provided by the mobile operator. If there is no
information available, then the parameters can be left empty or with their default values.
²
Enter the SIM PIN provided with the SIM card into the SIM PIN field, if the access to SIM card is protected
by PIN.
The entered digits are visible during input but will be replaced by stars after clicking Send.
²
Set the Operator selection parameters.
The Operator selection parameter controls the registration to a particular mobile network. If the param-
eter is set to auto, then the mobile module tries to register to the default or preferred or previous
network which is stored on the SIM. The auto selection fits in most cases. But there are special situations
(for example, in case of roaming) where a manual selection of mobile operator could be needed or be
advantageous.
If the Operator selection parameter is set to manual, then the Operator list parameter becomes visible.
The currently reachable mobile operators are presented in the list box. The mobile operator where
the SICAM FCG device is currently registered to is marked with current. Mobile networks which can
be selected are shown as available. Networks where the registration is not allowed are marked with
forbidden.
You can select one of the available mobile networks. The SICAM FCG tries to register with the manually
selected network after the configuration is activated.

Configure Tab, IPSec Window, Local Site
The IKE address parameters at SICAM FCG side are entered here:
•
The Identifier (Local ID) parameter determines the SICAM FCG-side identifier which is needed during
security association establishment. This parameter has to be known to the IPSec peer. The following 3
types are possible:
–
Full Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
For example fcg01.example.com. This can be any name which fits to the FQDN syntax, that means it
does not need to be resolvable via DNS.
–
User-FQDN
For example fcg01@example.com. This can be any name which matches the syntax.
–
IP address
In most cases, this must be the IP address of the external interface of the device. If this identifier
type is used then the devices IP address has to be configured at the IPSec peer. It has to be
contained in IKE messages received by the IPSec peer. Therefore, this identifier type is not advisable
if the SICAM FCG obtains dynamic and/or private IP addresses from a mobile network.
•
The VPN Client IP address is the SICAM FCG IP address for communication through the IPSec tunnel.
It is usually a private address and has to be known to the peer IPSec device (for example the VPN
router) and to any host (for example, the control center) in the utility network which would like to start
communication with SICAM FCG. For security reasons, it is important that this IP address is not in scope
of the LAN where SICAM FCG Ethernet interface is connected to. This LAN is determined by the IP address
and Subnet mask parameters at the Communication Ethernet configuration page.

The IKE address parameters of the peer side (for example the VPN router) are defined here:
•
The Identifier (Remote ID) parameter determines the identifier of the IPSec peer which is used during
security association establishment. This parameter has to be configured in the IPSec peer. Similar to the
local-side parameter, it can be of the following three types:
–
Full Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
For example vpnrouter.example.com. This can be any name which fits to the FQDN syntax, that
means it does not need to be resolvable via DNS.
–
User-FQDN
For example vpnrouter.example.com. This can be any name which matches the syntax.
–
IP address. In most cases, this is the IPSec peers external interface IP address.
•
The IP address or Domain name parameter represents the wide area network (WAN) address of the
IPSec peer. If the IPSec peer is behind a NAT device, then it is the WAN address of the NAT device. Enter
an IP address or FQDN (which can be resolved by DNS lookup).
•
The Subnet IP address/Prefix length parameter identifies the network at the side of the utility behind
the IPSec peer (VPN router). Note that the SICAM FCG VPN Client IP address has to be outside the scope of
this subnet.

SA lifetime (sec)
This parameter defines the time after the expiration of which the IKE attempts to rekey the security
associations.
•
Perfect forward secrecy enabled
This parameter determines whether this feature is used or not.
•
If the Auto-selection of authentication & encryption parameter is set to Yes, then various combina-
tions of authentication and encryption algorithms and Diffie-Hellman groups will be negotiated between
the SICAM FCG and the IPSec peer by IKE protocol during tunnel establishment. The peers will agree on
the most appropriate parameter set which is supported by both sides. In most cases, it will be the best
choice to let the peers to agree on these parameters automatically. But under some circumstances, it can
be advisable to select these parameters manually. In such cases, the Auto-selection parameter can be set
to No.
•
As a result, the Encryption algorithm, Authentication algorithm, and Diffie-Hellman group becomes
visible and configurable. You can select the values in the list boxes. In the manual case, only the selected
parameters will be negotiated with the IPSec peer.

Configure Tab, IPSec Window, IPSec Tunnel Supervision by Ping
These parameters are used for an additional failure detection by sending periodical Internet Control Message
Protocol (ICMP) Echo messages (Pings) through the tunnel:
•
If the IPSec Tunnel Supervision by Ping feature is enabled, then it becomes possible to configure a
Ping peer IP address. SICAM FCG sends the ICMP Echo messages periodically through the tunnel to the
destination specified by this IP address. This allows in-band detection of communication failures. It is
important that the remote host is reachable via the tunnel and replies to pings.
Siemens recommends enabling this feature for increasing the availability and stability of the IPSec tunnel.
In case of Ping failure, IPSec established tunnel will break and SICAM FCG will initiate the process of IPSec
tunnel restablishment with fresh security associations.

The Channels parameter determines the radio channels in the 2400-MHz frequency band. SICAM FCG
searches for selecting the most suitable channel for short-range radio communication. By default, all the
supported radio channels are searched. For significant interference with other senders in the same area,
it is desirable to select one or a number of radio channels or unselect one or a number of radio channels.
The channels are selected and unselected by checking or unchecking the corresponding check box. Click
check all or uncheck all to select/deselect all the channels.
²
The RF output power parameter defines the maximum short-range radio transmitting power of SICAM
FCG and of the SICAM FSIs communicating with this gateway device. The maximum allowed transmitting
power is defined by the international and national standards and regulatory documents and it differs
from country to country. The list box allows you to select the country or region where the SICAM FCGs
are deployed. If your country is not listed in the drop-down list box, you can select one of the available
countries with the same or less output power level.
The following table shows the correspondence between countries and the maximum used RF output

When SICAM FCG is configured using MindConnect protocol, it is possible to update the firmware version
associated with the device remotely through SICAM Localizer application. SICAM Localizer displays firmware
version compatible with the respective SICAM FCG and SICAM FSI hardware versions. For step-by-step proce-
dure on the firmware update of SICAM FCG/SICAM FSI using SICAM Localizer, please refer to SICAM Localizer
User Manual (E50417-H7040-C640-A5).
Update of operational data points on SICAM Localizer application may take longer than usual during firmware
update remotely through SICAM Localizer. The status of firmware update can be tracked under Firmware
details page of Asset Configuration in SICAM Localizer.

General
General
During operation, SICAM FCG needs the date and time for all time-relevant processes. The term time is used
throughout this section to refer to both the date and the time.
The time synchronization in the SICAM FCG is necessary to guarantee a common time basis for the communi-
cation with peripheral devices and time stamping of the process data.
SICAM FCG supports both external and internal time synchronization. External time synchronization via
Network Time Protocol (NTP) is recommended for SICAM FCG with MindConnect protocol. The type of time
synchronization is specified during the parameterization (see chapter 14.2.2  Time Synchronization).

Internal Time Keeping
Time Format
The internal time is kept in UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) from 01.01.2000, 00:00 to 31.12.2099, 23:59.
To display the local time for example on the HTML pages, you can configure a local time-correction factor and
the automatic adjustment to daylight saving time during parameterization (see 14.2.2  Time Synchronization).
Status Bits
FAIL Status Bit
The FAIL status bit implemented in the SICAM FCG signals with 0 that the time is valid and with 1 that the
time is invalid.
The status of the FAIL bit corresponds to the Clock error operational indication, see 13.1  Operational
Indications.
The following table lists the time stamps of events or indications for the displayed operational and error logs
according to status bit set/not set using the example of date 2010-09-26, time 13:49.35246:

External Time Synchronization with NTP
Time Synchronization
General
SICAM FCG supports NTP based time synchronization via mobile connection. SICAM FCG can use public NTP
servers which are located in the mobile operator network or in the Internet. If SICAM FCG runs an IPSec
tunnel to the utility communication network then private NTP servers in that network can be used for time
synchronization.
SICAM FCG is equipped with a SNTP client (SNTP = Simple Network Time Protocol) that can be connected to 2
NTP servers (NTP = Network Time Protocol), the primary and the secondary (redundant) NTP server.
You can find how to set the parameters of the 2 servers in the chapter 14.2.2  Time Synchronization.
The SNTP client sends a time request to the NTP server every 15 minutes. The time synchronization error is 2 s
referred to UTC time of the NTP server.
The time stamp of the NTP server has a 64-bit format. Counting is accomplished in seconds and fractions of
seconds.
i
i
NOTE
The time format is described in detail in the RFC 5905 (Request For Comments 5905 for NTP).
Time-Synchronization Procedure
The device was set to external time synchronization (NTP) during the parameterization. After switching on
or resetting the device, the FAIL bit is first set to 1 (=invalid) and the device sends a time request to the
NTP server. After receiving the time information from the NTP server, the FAIL bit is set to 0 (=valid) and the
internal timer real-time clock (RTC) is updated. The SNTP client repeats the time request to the NTP server
cyclically once every minute.
If the primary NTP server fails (for example, no response to a request twice or one of the criteria at Redundant
NTP server satisfied) and if the secondary NTP server is operational (always polled in parallel), the device
switches to the secondary NTP server. The FAIL bit remains = 0. In this case, the operational indication Primary
NTP Server Error is displayed, see chapter 13.1  Operational Indications.
If the secondary NTP server is also invalid, the FAIL bit will be set to 1 after the programmable timer Error
indication after (see 7.7.3  Time-Synchronization Settings ) has expired, and the Clock Error indication is
output.
Redundant NTP Servers
The time synchronization supports a primary and a secondary NTP server. Different IP addresses or domain
names are set for the two NTP servers, see 14.2.2  Time Synchronization.
SICAM FCG cyclically polls both NTP servers once every minute, but during normal operation, it is synchronized
by the primary NTP server. The device automatically switches to the secondary NTP server if one of the
following criteria is met:
•
No response from the primary NTP server to two successive requests
•
The alarm indication is set in the time information of the primary NTP server
•
The primary NTP server responds with 0
•
The message runtime in the network is > 5 ms (over Ethernet)
•
The message runtime in the network is > 1.8 s (over GPRS)
•
The stratum of the primary NTP server is 0 (unknown) or > 3
Switching to the secondary NTP server is prevented if:

•
The secondary server does not provide better time information (see criteria that initiate the switch from
primary to secondary NTP server; Secondary NTP Server Error indication was already output) or
•
The secondary server has recently been available for less than 150 minutes
In these cases, SICAM FCG is not synchronized anymore. The device uses the internal clock (on milliseconds
time basis) and the last valid drift. After the programmable time delay, the device reports Clock Error, see
13.1  Operational Indications.
Switching Back from the Secondary to the Primary NTP Server
While the device is synchronized by the secondary NTP server, it continues to poll cyclically the primary NTP
server. The device switches back to the primary NTP server, if it receives correct time information and if none
of the criteria for Redundant NTP Servers is fulfilled anymore.

External Time Synchronization with DNP3
Time Synchronization 
In order to support time-related activities, an outstation requires a dependable time source. The source of
the time on the network is system-dependent and can be a master station or a dedicated time server (NTP).
This section discusses about time synchronization from the master using DNP3 messages when enabled in the
configuration.
Time-Synchronization Procedure
The time base used for the communication between DNP3 devices is always according to UTC (Universal Time
Coordinated).
The device sets IIN1.4 [NEED_TIME] bit in responses during restart or when the outstation anticipates that its
timing reference drifts beyond the required accuracy. The master sends the time promptly after receiving a
response with this bit set.
Executing a time sync procedure over DNP3 starts the clock-valid-after-sync interval and clears IIN-1.4. When
the interval expires, IIN-1.4 becomes active again to indicate that time sync is required.
When using multiple master connections, only the first connection out of 4 master connections possible
would set IIN-1.4 [NEED_TIME] in the response. Only this connection accepts time sync messages from the
master.
Control center can execute time synchronization more often than indicated by IIN-1.4, so synchronizing at a
fixed interval shorter than the clock-valid-after-sync interval is accepted.
Following procedures explains the sequence and relative timing of messages used to time synchronize an
outstation from the master.
Non-LAN Procedure
In this procedure, 2 separate request messages are transmitted from the master, Delay measurement and
Write.
•
Delay measurement measures the propagation time in the physical layer.
•
Write sends the time that it is expected to be when the message arrives at the outstation.
LAN Procedure
In this procedure, 2 separate request messages are transmitted from the master, Record current time and
Write.
•
Record current time requests the outstation to record the time of receipt of the last byte in the message.
•
Write sends the time that the message must have arrived at the outstation.

Internal Time Synchronization via RTC
Besides external time synchronization, the internal time synchronization is also possible using the battery-
buffered RTC. The SICAM FCG features a quartz oscillator for this purpose.
The time offset of internal time synchronization is 86 ms/day maximum. Due to the reduced accuracy,
Siemens recommends using RTC only in case of failure or unavailability of the external time synchronization.
Internal time synchronization via RTC is not recommended for SICAM FCG with MCL protocol.

Ethernet Communication
IP Address
To enable the device to communicate within the Ethernet network, establish a network configuration
consisting of IP address, subnet mask, and gateway.
The device is delivered with a default IP address that can be restored at any time by pressing the IP-Addr.
button. Each device also has a unique MAC address.
The default IP address and the default subnet mask are imprinted on the side panel, see Figure 9-1:
[le_fcg_default_ip, 1, en_US]
Figure 9-1
With IP-Addr. Push-Button on the Side of the DIN Rail
(1)
IP-Addr. push-button
(2)
Default IP Address: 192.168.0.55; Default Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default IP Address and IP-Addr. Push-Button
To set the default IP address assigned as factory setting, there is the IP-Addr. push-button on the bottom
right of the case on the side of the DIN rail (see Figure 9-1). When pressed (> 3 s), this button activates
the factory-set default IP address. After pressing the IP-Addr. button, the device restarts and the IP address
and subnet mask are temporarily activated in the default IP network configuration. The customer-specific IP
configuration is not overwritten.
The network configuration settings can be displayed and edited on an HTML page during the parameterization
(see chapter 7.8.1  Ethernet). After a renewed restart, the parameterized network configuration is used again.

NOTE
For devices with mobile interface, the Ethernet port is a service port and must not be used for data
transmission. The Ethernet port must be disabled after commissioning and while not required. This can be
done via IP Addr. push-button (see chapter 6.4  Disabling the Ethernet Interface) or via configuration user
interface (see chapter 14.3.1.1 Communication).
Check for Duplicate Assigned IP Address
An IP address assigned twice leads to serious malfunction in the communication network.
For this reason, an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) request is sent to the own IP address during startup of
the device. If no response is received from the communication network within 2 s, it is assumed that the IP
address is not yet used in the network.
Otherwise, the LEDs (see chapter 12.3.1 LEDs on the Top Side of the Housing) signal that the IP address is
already assigned and the device is not connected to the network. In this case, specify a different IP address.
i
i
NOTE
If the device is directly connected to a PC (without Ethernet switch), the PC needs a longer period to be able
to detect the connection and therefore to receive the ARP telegram. In this case, it may not be detected
when PC and device have the same IP address.
Reception of the Network Configuration from the DHCP Server
The network configuration can also be obtained from an external server. Using the DHCP protocol, the device
is integrated into an existing network.
If the IP address 0.0.0.0 is configured (see chapter 7.8.1  Ethernet), the device sends a query to the external
DHCP server requesting the network configuration immediately after booting. After reception of the network
configuration, the device launches the Ethernet services.
If no DHCP server is available, disconnect the device from the network and start it using the default IP address
(see chapter 6.3 Starting the Device with the Default IP Address ) and assign a permanent IP address.

IEC 60870-5-104 Protocol
IEC 60870-5-104 Protocol
The IEC 60870-5-104 protocol is used for communication via the Ethernet and mobile interfaces. The IEC
60870-5-104 specification with a detailed explanation of the protocol is given in the International Standard
IEC 60870-5-104. When the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol communciation is interrupted, 200 events are buffered
in SICAM FCG.

Redundancy Mode
SICAM FCG provides 2 redundancy methods which can be selected during parameterization (Table 7-14):
•
Redundancy according to IEC 60870-5-104
SICAM FCG can support 4 separate redundancy groups for connections to 4 different control centers with
2 connections each in one redundancy group for the set of redundant masters in a control center. Each
redundancy group will have only 1 event buffer. Both the connections can be in connected state at any given
time and exchanging "Test" frames. But data transmission will happen only in one connection which has
sent a STARTDT and received STARTDTCON. The controlling station (Master) decides which of the connection
should be in the state of send/receive user data. Whenever the active connection is disrupted, the established
redundant connection can take over by sending a STARTDT.
i
i
NOTE
For connection over 2G network via internal mobile communication, due to bandwidth limitation SICAM
FCG can support only up to 2 separate redundancy groups for connections to 2 different control centers
with 2 connections each in one redundancy group for the set of redundant masters in a control center.
In the above scenario, configuration is limited to 2 control centers only as shown in the Figure 9-2 below:
If you need to use more number of connections, communication using Ethernet Interface via external
router must be used.

Bit String (M_BO)
A bit string (or bit-array) is a method of compactly storing a number of bits of data. In this instance, you can
store up to 16 bit values. The first bit value is stored in the least significant bit (LSB) of the register. The 16th
value would be in the most significant bit (MSB). The bit values can only be 0 or 1. Any unused bits are set to
0.

DNP3 Protocol
Overview 
The DNP3 protocol is a communication standard for telecontrol engineering. DNP3 is used as a general
transmission protocol between the control systems and substations and between the bay units and systems
control.
The DNP3 protocol defines 1 controlling station with 1 or multiple controlled stations up to 4 masters.
The controlling station is connected with 1 or multiple controlled stations via communication protocol in
a linear or star connection known as multi-point traffic. Ideally, the controlling station controls the data
traffic, where as with DNP3, in contrast to other protocols, the controlled station can also send an unsolicited
spontaneous data ( = unsolicited responses).
When the DNP3 protocol communication is interrupted, then 100 events are buffered in SICAM FCG.
DNP3 Device Profile with Data Points List
Details of the device identification, object groups and variations, function codes and quali-
fiers, supported in both requests and responses with data points list, are described in /8/ SICAM FCG DNP3
Device Profile.
You can download the device profile with data points list from http://www.siemens.com/sicam.
DNP3 Diagnosis
The diagnosis for DNP3, see chapter 7.18.2 Diagnosis DNP3, allows the parameters and communication to be
analyzed and the diagnosis counters to be reset.

MindConnect Library (MCL) Protocol
Overview 
The MindConnect Library is a collection of functionalities which allows a client application to connect and
exchange data with MindSphere. The connection to MindSphere is secured by using SSL/TLS in order to
protect clients transferred data. TLS 1.3 version is currently used for this purpose. When MCL protocol is
interrupted, 150 events are buffered in SICAM FCG.

MQTT Protocol
Overview 
MQTT protocol is used for publishing SICAM FSI and SICAM FCG operational datapoints from SICAM FCG to
broker of cloud solution (for ex. Electrification X Cloud) using JSON format. The connection to the cloud is
secured by using TLS. The file transfer over MQTT is not supported. The broker stores the datapoints received
from the MQTT client implemented in SICAM FCG. Subscribers can then register at broker to receive the
datapoints for required data analysis and evaluation.

Storage
Store the device in a dry and clean location. Store the device within a temperature range from -25 °C to +70 °C
(-13 °F to +158 °F).
The relative humidity must not lead to condensation or ice formation.
To avoid premature aging of the electrolytic capacitors, store the device within the recommended tempera-
ture range of +10 °C to +35 °C (+50 °F to +95 °F).
Siemens furthermore recommends connecting the device to supply voltage once a year for 1 to 2 days in
order to form the inserted electrolytic capacitor. This procedure should also be carried out before operating
the device.
The Lithium-batteries in this equipment are subject to Special Provision 188 of the UN Recommendations on

Error Log For Uploading Incorrect Root CA Certificate
•
In this case, the user should repeat the procedure mentioned in 7.13.1  MindConnect Library Protocol
Configuration and ensure the correct Root CA certificate file is selected while performing the process.
Device starts in Boot Loader mode after uploaded with latest firmware version
Follow the below steps in case the SICAM FCG goes to Boot Loader mode after uploaded with latest firmware
version (for example: V04.XX or above).
•
Ensure the Boot Loader version is updated as per this table: Table 12-1
•
Once the Boot Loader is updated, update the device with latest SICAM FCG firmware version. Refer to
Starting SICAM FCG Web GUI with Loading a New/Different Firmware, Page 278 for uploading the latest
firmware file in Boot Loader mode.

NOTE
•
Time synchronization via NTP is recommended for all date and time relevant processes.
•
If the time synchronization for the device is via NTP, then time-synchronization → source time
synchronization parameter must be set to NTP. In this scenario, protocol time synchronization must
be disabled.
•
If the time synchronization for the device is via DNP3, then time-synchronization → source time
synchronization parameter must be set to Internal.

This parameter offers the possibility of a blocked transmission of several measured values, that change in quick succession. The time
delay starts when the first measured-value changes occurs. All of the following measured-value changes, occurring within the time
delay are sent together in a spontaneous measured-value telegram after the expiration of time delay. If a measured value changes
several times within this time, then only the last modification of this measured value is transmitted.
18
The parameter is only relevant if measured values transmission = cyclic or measured values transmission = cyclic and station
interrogation is selected.
19
The parameter is only relevant if measured values transmission = cyclic or measured values transmission = cyclic and station
interrogation is selected.

Glossary
SICAM, Fault Collector Gateway, Manual
327
E50417-H1040-C584-B7, Edition 04.2024


The server sends KeepAlive messages (TCP packets without data) to the client in regular intervals (KeepAlive
time) while the network is inactive, and the client responds to these messages.
If the client does not respond to a KeepAlive message, the server assumes that the link is down or the client is
inactive and closes the TCP link.

the IP addresses to be exchanged. These stored associations are usually addressed by the combination of IP
address and UDP or TCP port numbers.
NAT Traversal
NAT Traversal is a feature of IKE and IPSec which recognizes NAT devices in the communication path between
the IPSec peers and takes the required measures to handle this situation. So, UDP headers with wellknown
port numbers are inserted into IKE and IPSec packets. Keep-alive messages are exchanged for preventing NAT
association expiry within NAT devices.
