Inputting Expressions and Values 
Basic Input Rules
When you press  the priority sequence of the input calculation will be
evaluated automatically and the result will appear on the display.
4 × sin 30 × (30 + 10 × 3) = 120
*1 Input of the closing parenthesis is required for sin and other functions
that include parentheses.
*2 These multiplication symbols (×) can be omitted.
*3 The closing parenthesis immediately before the  operation can be
omitted.
Note
• The cursor will change shape to  when there are 10 bytes or less of
allowed input remaining. If this happens, end calculation input and then
press .
• If you execute a calculation that includes both division and multiplication
operations in which a multiplication sign has been omitted, parentheses
will be inserted automatically as shown in the examples below.
- When a multiplication sign is omitted immediately before an open
parenthesis or after a closed parenthesis.
Example: 6 ÷  2 1 +  2
 6 ÷ 2 1 +  2
- When a multiplication sign is omitted immediately before a variable, a
constant, etc.
Example: 2 ÷ 2 2 
 2 ÷ 2 2
Calculation Priority Sequence
The priority sequence of input calculations is evaluated in accordance with
the rules below. When the priority of two expressions is the same, the
calculation is performed from left to right.
1
Parenthetical expressions
2
Functions that have parentheses (sin(, log(, etc., functions that take
an argument to the right, functions that require a closing parenthesis
after the argument)
3
Functions that come after the input value (𝑥2, 𝑥3, 𝑥-1, 𝑥!,  °’ ”, °, r, g, %,
𝑡), engineering symbols (m, μ, n, p, f, k, M, G, T, P, E), powers (),
roots ()
4
Fractions
5
Negative sign ((-)), base-n symbols (d, h, b, o)
6
Metric conversion commands (cmin, etc.), Statistics Mode
estimated values (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑥1, 𝑥2)
7
Multiplication where the multiplication sign is omitted
8
Permutation (nPr), combination (nCr), complex number polar
coordinate symbol (∠)

9
Dot product (•)
10
Multiplication (×), division (÷)
11
Addition (+), subtraction (−)
12
and (logical operator)
13
or, xor, xnor (logical operators)
Note: When squaring a negative value (such as -2), the value being
squared must be enclosed in parentheses (2). Since x2 has
a higher priority than the negative sign, inputting 2 would result in
the squaring of 2 and then appending a negative sign to the result. Always
keep the priority sequence in mind, and enclose negative values in
parentheses when required.
Inputting an Expression Using Natural Textbook
Format (MathI/MathO or MathI/DecimalO Only)
Formulas and expressions that include fractions and/or special functions
such as √ can be input in natural textbook format by using templates that
appear when certain keys are pressed.
Example: 31
2 + 53
2
1. Press ().
• This inputs a mixed fraction template.
2. Input values into the integer, numerator, and denominator areas of the
template.
312
3. Do the same to input the remainder of the expression.
() 532
Tip: While the input cursor is located within the input area of a template
(mixed fractions, integration (∫), and sum (Σ)), pressing  jumps to the
position immediately following (to the right) of the template, while pressing
 jumps to the position immediate before (to the left of) it.
Note
• When you press  and obtain a calculation result, part of the
expression you input may be cut off. If you need to view the entire input
expression again, press  and then use  and  to scroll the input
expression.
• Nesting of functions and parentheses is allowed. Further input will
become impossible if you nest too many functions and/or parentheses.
To undo operations (MathI/MathO or MathI/DecimalO only): To undo the
last key operation, press (UNDO). To redo a key operation you have
just undone, press (UNDO) again.

Using Values and Expressions as Arguments (MathI/
MathO or MathI/DecimalO only)
Example: To input 1 + 7
6 and then change it to 1 +
7

176(INS)

Pressing (INS) in the above example causes 7
6 to be the argument
of the function input by the next key operation (√).
Overwrite Input Mode (LineI/LineO or LineI/DecimalO
only)
In the overwrite mode, text you input replaces the text at the current cursor
location. You can toggle between the insert and overwrite modes by
performing the operations: (INS). The cursor appears as “” in the
insert mode and as “” in the overwrite mode.
Toggling Calculation Results 
While MathI/MathO or MathI/DecimalO is selected for Input/Output on the
setup menu, each press of  will toggle the currently displayed
calculation result between its fraction form and decimal form, its √ form
and decimal form, or its π form and decimal form.

Regardless of what is selected for Input/Output on the setup menu, each
press of  will toggle the currently displayed calculation result between its
decimal form and fraction form.
Important
• With certain calculation results, pressing the  key will not convert the
displayed value.
• You cannot switch from decimal form to mixed fraction form if the total
number of digits used in the mixed fraction (including integer, numerator,
denominator, and separator symbol) is greater than 10.

Integration and Differential Calculation Precautions
• When using a trigonometric function in f(x), specify “Radian” as the angle
unit.
• A smaller tol value increases precision, but it also increases calculation
time. When specifying tol, use value that is 1 × 10-14 or greater.
• Integration normally requires considerable time to perform.
• Depending on the content of f(x), positive and negative values within the
region of integration, or the region of integration, calculation error that
exceeds the allowable range may be generated, causing the calculator
to display an error message.
• With derivative calculations, non-consecutive points, abrupt ﬂuctuation,
extremely large or small points, inﬂection points, and the inclusion of
points that cannot be differentiated, or a differential point or a differential
calculation result that approaches zero can cause poor precision or
error.

Using CALC 
CALC lets you input calculation expressions that include one or more
variable, assign values to the variables, and calculate the result. CALC can
be used in the Calculate Mode and Complex Mode.
You can use CALC to save the types of expressions below.
• 2x + 3y, 2Ax + 3By + C, A + Bi, etc.
• x + y : x (x + y), etc.
• y = x2 + x + 3, etc.
Note: During the time from when you press  until you exit CALC by
pressing , you should use Linear input procedures for input.

Using SOLVE 
SOLVE uses Newton’s method to approximate the solution of equations.
Note that SOLVE can be used in the Calculate Mode only. SOLVE supports
input of equations of the following formats.
Examples: y = x + 5, x = sin(M), xy + C (Treated as xy + C = 0)
Note
• If an equation contains input functions that include an open parenthesis
(such as sin and log), do not omit the closing parenthesis.
• During the time from when you press (SOLVE) until you exit
SOLVE by pressing , you should use Linear input procedures for

• Solutions are always displayed in decimal form.
• The closer the (Left Side) − (Right Side) result is to zero, the higher the
accuracy of the solution.
Important
• SOLVE performs convergence a preset number of times. If it cannot ﬁnd
a solution, it displays a conﬁrmation screen that shows “Continue:[=]”,
asking if you want to continue. Press  to continue or  to cancel the
SOLVE operation.
• Depending on what you input for the initial value for x (solution variable),
SOLVE may not be able to obtain solutions. If this happens, try changing
the initial value so they are closer to the solution.
• SOLVE may not be able to determine the correct solution, even when one
exists.
19


• SOLVE uses Newton’s method, so even if there are multiple solutions,
only one of them will be returned.
• Due to limitations in Newton’s method, solutions tend to be difﬁcult to
obtain for equations like the following: y = sin x,  𝑦= 𝑒𝑥,  𝑦=
𝑥.

6. Press  to generate the number table.
• Press  to return to the screen in
step 3.
Tip
• In the number table shown in step 6, you can change the value in the
currently highlighted x cell. Changing the x value causes the f(x) and g(x)
values in the same line to be updated accordingly.
• If there is value in the x cell above the currently highlighted x cell,
pressing  or  automatically inputs into the highlighted cell the
value equal to the value of the cell above it plus the step value. So also,
27


pressing  automatically inputs the value equal to the value of the cell
above less the step value. The f(x) and g(x) values in the same line are
also updated accordingly.
Note
• After pressing  in step 4 above, proceeding from step 5 onwards
without inputting anything for g(x) will generate a number table for f(x)
only.
• The maximum number of rows in the generated number table depends
on the setup menu table setting. Up to 45 rows are supported for the
“f(x)” setting, while 30 rows are supported for the “f(x),g(x)” setting.
• The number table generation operation causes the contents of variable x
to be changed.
Important: Functions input in this mode are deleted whenever the Input/
Output settings are changed in the Table Mode.

formula (such as 7+3, sin30, A1×2, etc.) that does not have an equal sign
(=) in front of it.
Formula: A formula that starts out with an equal sign (=), such as =A1×2, is
executed as it is written.
Note: Up to 10 bytes can be input into each cell in the case of a constant.
In the case of a formula, you can input up to 49 bytes into each cell.
Inputting a formula into a cell requires 11 bytes in addition to the number of
bytes for the actual formula data.
To display the remaining input capacity: Press (Free Space).

edit them as required.
3. To ﬁnalize and apply your edits, press .
To input a cell reference name using the Grab command
The Grab command can be used in place of manual reference name (such
as A1) input using a key operation to select and input a cell you want to
reference.
Ex 2: Continuing from Ex 1, input the following formula into cell B2: =A2+7.
1. Move the cell cursor to cell B2.
2. Perform the key operation below.

7
Cell Relative and Absolute References
There are two types of cell reference: relative and absolute.
Relative cell reference: The cell reference (A1) in a formula like =A1+7 is a
relative reference, which means that it changes depending on the cell
where the formula is located. If the formula =A1+7 is originally located in
cell B1, for example, copying and then pasting to cell C3 will result in
=B3+7 being input into cell C3. Since the copy and paste operation moves
the formula one column (B to C) and two rows (1 to 3) causes the A1
relative cell reference in the formula to change to B3. If the result of a copy
and paste operation causes a relative cell reference name to change to
something that is outside the range of the spreadsheet cells, the applicable
column letter and/or row number will be replaced by a question mark (?),
and “ERROR” will be displayed as the cell’s data.
Absolute cell reference: If you want the row or the column, or both the row
and the column parts of a cell reference name to remain the same no matter
where you paste them, you need to create an absolute cell reference name.
To create an absolute cell reference put a dollar sign () in front of the
column name and/or row number. You can use one of three different
absolute cell references: absolute column with relative row (A1), relative
column with absolute row (A1), or absolute row and column (A1).
To input the absolute cell reference symbol ()
While inputting a formula into a cell, press ().

2. Move the cursor to the cell into which you want to paste the data you
just cut, and then press .
34


• Pasting data simultaneously deletes the data from the cell where you
performed the cut operation, and automatically cancels paste
standby.
Note: In the case of a cut and paste operation, cell references do not
change when pasted, regardless of whether they are relative or absolute.
To copy and paste spreadsheet data
1. Move the cursor to the cell whose data you want to copy and then press
(Copy & Paste).
• This enters paste standby. To cancel paste standby, press .
2. Move the cursor to the cell into which you want to paste the data you
just copied, and then press .
• Paste standby remains enabled until you press , so you can paste
the copied data to other cells, if you want.
Note: When you copy the contents of a cell that contains a formula with a
relative reference, the relative reference will change in accordance with the
location of the cell where the contents are pasted.

Error Messages
Math ERROR
• The intermediate or ﬁnal result of the calculation you are performing
exceeds the allowable calculation range.
• Your input exceeds the allowable input range (particularly when using
functions).
• The calculation you are performing contains an illegal mathematical
operation (such as division by zero).
→Check the input values, reduce the number of digits, and try again.
→When using independent memory or a variable as the argument of a
function, make sure that the memory or variable value is within the
allowable range for the function.
Stack ERROR
• The calculation you are performing has caused the capacity of the
numeric stack or the command stack to be exceeded.
• The calculation you are performing has caused the capacity of the matrix
or vector stack to be exceeded.
→Simplify the calculation expression so it does not exceed the capacity
of the stack.
→Try splitting the calculation into two or more parts.
Syntax ERROR
• There is a problem with the format of the calculation you are performing.
Argument ERROR
• There is a problem with the argument of the calculation you are
performing.
Dimension ERROR (Matrix and Vector Modes only)
• The matrix or vector you are trying to use in a calculation was input
without specifying its dimension.
• You are trying to perform a calculation with matrices or vectors whose
dimensions do not allow that type of calculation.
→Specify the dimension of the matrix or vector and then perform the
calculation again.
→Check the dimensions speciﬁed for the matrices or vectors to see if
they are compatible with the calculation.
Variable ERROR (SOLVE feature only)
• An attempt to execute SOLVE for an expression input without any
variable included.
→Input an expression that includes a variable.
Cannot Solve (SOLVE feature only)
• The calculator could not obtain a solution.
→Check for errors in the equation that you input.
→Input a value for the solution variable that is close to the expected
solution and try again.
Range ERROR
• An attempt to generate a number table in the Table Mode whose
conditions cause it to exceed the maximum number of allowable rows.
• During batch input in the Spreadsheet Mode, input for Range is outside
the allowable range or is a cell name that does not exist.
→Narrow the table calculation range by changing the Start, End, and
Step values, and try again.
→For Range, input a cell name within the range of A1 through E45, using
the syntax: “A1:A1”.
Time Out
38


• The current differential or integration calculation ends without the ending
condition being fulﬁlled.
→Try increasing the tol value. Note that this also decreases solution
precision.
Circular ERROR (Spreadsheet Mode only)
• There is a circular reference (such as “=A1” in cell A1) in the
spreadsheet.
→Change cell contents to remove the circular references.
Memory ERROR (Spreadsheet Mode only)
• You are attempting to input data that exceeds the allowable input
capacity (1,700 bytes).
• You are attempting to input data that results in a chain of consecutive cell
references (such as cell A2 referenced from cell A1, cell A3 referenced
from cell A2…, etc.) This type of input always causes this error to be
generated, even if memory capacity (1,700 bytes) is not exceeded.
• Memory capacity was exceeded because a formula that includes a
relative cell reference was copied, or because of batch input of formulas
that use relative cell references.
→Delete unneeded data and input data again.
→Minimize input that results in a chain of consecutive cell references.
→Shorten the formula being copied or the formulas being batch input.
Before Assuming Malfunction of the
Calculator... 
Note that you should make separate copies of important data before
performing these steps.
1. Check the calculation expression to make sure that it does not contain
any errors.
2. Make sure that you are using the correct mode for the type of
calculation you are trying to perform.
3. If the above steps do not correct your problem, press the  key.
• This will cause the calculator to perform a routine that checks
whether calculation functions are operating correctly. If the calculator
discovers any abnormality, it automatically initializes the calculation
mode and clears memory contents.
4. Return the calculation mode and setup (except for the Contrast setting)
to their initial default settings by performing the following operation:
(RESET)(Setup Data)(Yes).
Replacing the Battery 
A low battery is indicated by a dim display, even if contrast is adjusted, or
by failure of ﬁgures to appear on the display immediately after you turn on
the calculator. If this happens, replace the battery with a new one.
Important: Removing the battery will cause all of the calculator’s memory
contents to be deleted.

, x!, nPr, nCr type functions require consecutive internal
calculation, which can cause accumulation of errors that occur with each
calculation.
• Error is cumulative and tends to be large in the vicinity of a function’s
singular point and inﬂection point.
• The range for calculation results that can be displayed in π form when
MathI/MathO is selected for Input/Output on the setup menu is |x| < 106.
Note, however, that internal calculation error can make it impossible to
display some calculation results in π form. It also can cause calculation
results that should be in decimal form to appear in π form.

■■ Frequently Asked Questions ■■ 
How can I change a fraction form result produced by a division
operation to decimal form?
→While a fraction calculation result is displayed, press . To have
calculation results initially appear as decimal values, change the setup
menu Input/Output setting to MathI/DecimalO.
What is the difference between Ans memory, independent memory, and
variable memory?
→Each of these types of memory acts like “containers” for temporary
storage of a single value.
Ans Memory: Stores the result of the last calculation performed. Use
this memory to carry the result of one calculation on to the next.
Independent Memory: Use this memory to totalize the results of
multiple calculations.
Variables: This memory is helpful when you need to uses the same
value multiple times in one or more calculations.
What is the key operation to take me from the Statistics Mode or Table
Mode to a mode where I can perform arithmetic calculations?
→Press (Calculate).
How can I return the calculator to its initial default settings?
→Perform the following operation to initialize calculator settings (except
the Contrast setting): (RESET)(Setup Data)(Yes).

When I execute a function calculation, why do I get a calculation result
that is completely different from older CASIO calculator models?
→With a Natural Textbook Display model, the argument of a function that
uses parentheses must be followed by a closing parenthesis. Failing to
press  after the argument to close the parentheses may cause
unwanted values or expressions to be included as part of the
argument.
Example: (sin 30) + 15  (Angle Unit: Degree)
