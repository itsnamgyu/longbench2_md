# Question

Suppose my PDE is discretized on a grid that consists of multiple blocks where each block can be represented by a Cartesian indexing, and the corresponding linear system needs to be solved as efficiently as possible, which conceptual interfaces should I use? Furthermore, which kind of preconditioner under this interface would you recommend for me considering both efficiency and scalability?

# Choices

- A: The Structured-Grid System Interface, and its SMG would be suitable.
- B: The Structured-Grid System Interface, and its  PFMG would be suitable.
- C: The Linear-Algebraic System Interface, and its BoomerAMG would be suitable.
- D: The Semi-Structured-Grid System Interface, and its SplitSolve would be suitable.

# Answer

C
