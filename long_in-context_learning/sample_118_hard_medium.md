# Question

Which of the following is incorrect according to the handbook?

# Choices

- A: When the contactor opens and the device stops working, I should check the ER LED for error messages. Such thing may happen when the current is below a set lower limit.
- B: Whether I want to mount the load feeder of size S0 for direct or reversing starting, I should lock the 3RC7 ILM on the contactor by pulling the locking slide downwards.
- C: A DIN rail adapter is a must if I mount size S0 load feeders for reversing starting. The DIN adapter is mounted in the same way as the motor starter protector.
- D: If I only have 3RC7 ILM Power Cable, I must install the 3RA8 ILF device group side by side with a maximum distance of 4.5 centimeters.

A
