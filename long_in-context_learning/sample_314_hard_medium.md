# Question

What is true about the Sony Digital Camera according to the help guide?

# Choices

- A: If I attach a mount adaptor to my camera with SAM lens and autofocus is not available, then I'm probably using LA-EA3 Mount Adaptor.
- B: When the camera's software version is 3.00 or later, I can use XAVC card for still-image shooting and movie recording with the maximum recordable bit rate of 600bps.
- C: Touch operations allow me to focus on the monitor. When I'm wearing gloves, I may set Touch Sensitivity to "Sensitive" instead of "Standard" for better responsivity.
- D: When using remote shooting, I can choose whether to save the still image on camera or the destination. I cannot record still images when no memory card is inserted after I release the shutter.
