Functional Limitations
After handset upgrade, subscription cancellation or long periods of handset disuse, the following become unavailable:
･TV
･Camera
If the functions mentioned above are activated more than a set number of times while out-of-range, they become unavailable.


xxix
General Notes
Activate the Camera and TV again after moving to a location with signal reception.
Caution
Do not use handset if it has been altered. Using an altered device is a violation of the Radio Law. This handset is certified to conform 
to the technical standards for specific radio equipment based on the Radio Law, and Technical Conformity Mark 
 is printed on the 
model name seal as certification. If you remove screws and make alterations inside of handset, the technical standards conformity 
certification becomes invalid. Do not use handset with the certification invalid, as it is a violation of the Radio Law.
SAR Certification Information 
930CA meet the technical standards set by Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) regarding radio wave absorption by a 
human body. 
These technical standards have been established on a scientific basis to prevent radio waves emitted from wireless devices such as mobile 
phones that are used close to a human head from affecting human health. These standards require that the SAR (Specific Absorption 
Rate), an indicator of the amount of average radio frequency energy absorbed in the side of a human head, must not exceed the permissive 
value of 2 W/kg*. This value includes a substantial safety margin to assure the safety of all persons, regardless of age and physical size. 
The value is equal to the international guideline recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection 
(ICNIRP) that has a cooperative relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO).
* The technical standards are stipulated in the Radio Law (Article 14-2 of Ordinance Regulating Radio Equipment).
The highest SAR value is 0.351W/kg for 930CA. This value was obtained in accordance with the MIC testing procedure with handset 
transmitting at its highest permitted power level. While there may be differences in SAR levels among individual products, they all meet 
the MIC’s permissible value. Because mobile phones are designed to operate at their minimum power level required to communicate 
with base stations, the actual SAR of handset during a call is usually below the highest value.
For further information about SAR, see the following websites:
･Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC)
http://www.tele.soumu.go.jp/e/ele/index.htm
･Association of Radio Industries and Businesses (ARIB)
http://www.arib-emf.org/index02.html (Japanese)

General Notes
SoftBank’s Body SAR Policy
* Body SAR: The SAR value at the maximum transmission power when continuously talking with handset placed on the body and using 
earphone-microphone.
**Specific Absorption Rate (SAR): The value measured when having talked continuously for 6 minutes.
***Placement on the body: Measurements are taken with the rear of handset facing the body at a distance of 1.5 cm as the ordinary 
handset position. In order to comply with radio frequency exposure requirements, use an accessory (e.g. belt clip, holster) that does 
not contain metallic parts to maintain a 1.5 cm separation between the body and handset.
For more information, see SOFTBANK MOBILE Corp. Website:
http://www.softbankmobile.co.jp/corporate/legal/emf/emf03.html
European RF Exposure Information
This handset 930CA is a radio transmitter and receiver. This product has been confirmed not to exceed the limits recommended by 
international guidelines for radio frequency.
These guidelines were developed by the independent scientific organization International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation 
Protection (ICNIRP) and include a substantial safety margin to assure the safety of all persons, regardless of age and health.
The influence on the human body of radio waves emitted from mobile phones is measured employing a unit known as the Specific 
Absorption Rate (SAR). The SAR limit for mobile devices is 2 W/kg. The maximum SAR value for this model handset, when placed on the 
ear, is 2W/kg for 930CA*. As mobile devices offer a range of functions, they can be used in other positions, such as on the body as 
described in SoftBank’s Body SAR Policy. In this case, the maximum SAR value is 0.375W/kg for 930CA.
Since the SAR is measured at the highest transmitting power level, the actual SAR during a call is usually much smaller. This is because 
mobile phones are designed to operate at their minimum power levels necessary to communicate with base stations.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that present scientific information about mobile phone use does not indicate any adverse 
effects on the human body. They recommend limiting the talking time or using a handsfree device to keep the mobile phone away from 
the head and body to reduce influence of exposure to radio waves.
Additional information can be found at the WHO website:
http://www.who.int/emf
* Measurements with handset placed on the body are carried out in accordance with the FCC standards. The values are based on 
European requirements.

Notes on Battery Charging
●Charge battery at least once every six months. If battery is left 
uncharged for a long period, it may become unusable or its 
operation time may decrease.
●Avoid connecting too many things to one AC outlet. Doing so 
may cause the AC outlet to overheat and cause a fire.
●Battery and AC Charger may become warm during charging, 
but this is not a malfunction. If they become too hot, however, 
stop charging and contact SoftBank Customer Center, 
Customer Assistance (P. 15-52).
●If Charging Indicator flashes during charging, battery may be 
faulty. Contact SoftBank Customer Center, Customer 
Assistance (P. 15-52).
●Depending on the conditions of usage, the battery may expand 
as it nears the end of its life. However, this presents no safety 
problems.

One Seg is a digital TV broadcasting 
service for mobile devices. It uses 
one segment of the terrestrial digital 
band for TV and data broadcasts 
that you enjoy at home, on your 
handset.
Handset supports One Seg Digital TV for cellular phones and other information 
terminals.
●One Seg is available only in Japan. Because other countries use different broadcast 
systems and frequencies, watching One Seg Digital TV is not possible outside of Japan.
Precautions
●Never watch TV while riding a bicycle, 
motorcycle, or driving a car. You may 
not hear the sounds around you clearly, 
or TV image/sound may distract you 
creating the risk of accident. Even while 
walking, pay attention to the traffic 
around you. Be especially careful at 
railway crossings and pedestrian 
crosswalks.
●TV image/sound may be affected if a call 
or message is received while watching TV.
●TV information (TV links or data you 
entered in Data Broadcast Mode) saved 
on handset cannot be transferred to 
another handset when you change your 
handset to another model or when it is 
repaired. Keep a memo of necessary 
information.
●TV is available when USIM Card is 
inserted and with a valid SoftBank 
contract.
● If TV is activated over a set number of 
times while out-of-range, TV becomes 
unavailable. Activate TV again after 
moving to a location with signal 
reception.
Enjoy data broadcasts while 
watching TV. Access 
program-related information and 
even participate in the program 
(P. 8-8).
Record a program on memory 
card while viewing it and enjoy it 
again at a later time (P. 8-10).
Book programs you want to 
view/record. Program Guide can be 
used for booking programs (P. 8-13).
Sender and subject information 
appears for new message while TV 
is active (P. 14-6).

About Memory Card
Save files to memory cards. Still images 
and videos shot with handset camera 
can be saved directly to memory card. 
Data can be copied and moved 
between handset and memory card. 
Data on memory card can also be 
accessed from Data Folder.
●Handset supports microSD™ and 
microSDHC™ memory cards of up to 
8 GB (as of February 2009).
●Be sure handset power is off when 
inserting/removing memory cards.
●Insert memory cards properly. Otherwise, 
they cannot be used on handset.
●Do not affix stickers or labels to memory 
cards. As memory cards are very thin 
and precise mechanisms, even a thin 
sticker or label on a memory card may 
cause contact failure or destruction of 
data.
●Keep memory cards out of reach of 
infants who may accidentally swallow 
them or be injured.
●Use only memory cards recommended 
by SoftBank. Other memory cards may 
not work properly and cannot be used 
on handset.
●Do not remove a memory card or power 
off handset while writing and reading 
data with that memory card. It may 
cause data loss or malfunction.
●Access to memory cards may be 
unavailable when the battery level is 
low.

Getting Started
Wirelessly exchange files with infrared 
compatible devices.
The following data can be transferred 
via infrared:
･Still images
･Melodies
･Videos
･My Pictograms
･Songs
･Books
･Phone Book entries, Account Details
･Schedule events
･To Do List tasks
･Received messages, sent messages
･Draft messages
･Text memos
･Common Phrases (Templates)
･Own Dictionary data
･Bookmarks (Yahoo! Keitai and PC Site

Precautions
●Data may not be sent depending on the 
status of the receiving device. Folder 
settings of received messages or 
bookmarks, etc., or contents of Graphic 
Mails may be lost or incorrectly 
transferred depending on the receiving 
handset model.
●Handset is out of range during infrared 
transmission, so such functions as voice 
and video calls, the Internet access and 
sending/receiving S! Mails are 
unavailable. This may continue even 
after infrared transmission is finished.
●Transferring data may take a while 
depending on the amount of data. 
Some data may not be received by 
handset.
●During transmission, progress bar 
shows approximate number of files 
transferred. Note that actual progress 
may be faster.
●Some pictographs and symbols in 
messages and Phone Book entries may 
not be received by handset correctly.
●All the still images on handset are 
overwritten, even those set as Phone 
Book entry images, if handset receives 
all still images at once.
●Align Infrared Ports of both sending and 
receiving devices, as shown below.
●Do not move either device until a 
message appears indicating completion 
of data transmission. Do not place any 
objects between the devices. Do not 
obstruct Infrared Ports.
●Infrared transmission may be disrupted 
by direct sunlight, directly under 
fluorescent lighting or near other 
infrared devices.
Note
･Handset cannot send all still images, 
melodies, videos, My Pictograms, songs 
or books at one time.
