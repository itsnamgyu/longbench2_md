Precautions
Refer also to “Notes on use” in the Startup Guide (supplied) for this product.
On the data specifications described in this manual
The data on performance and specifications in this manual are based on an ordinary ambient temperature of 25ºC
(77°F), except where otherwise indicated.
For the battery pack, the data are based on a battery pack that was fully charged until the charge lamp turned off.
On operating temperatures
Shooting in extremely cold or hot environments that exceed the operating temperature range is not recommended.
Under high ambient temperatures, the temperature of the camera rises quickly.
When the temperature of the camera rises, the image quality may deteriorate. It is recommended that you wait until
the temperature of the camera drops before continuing to shoot.
Depending on the camera and battery temperature, the camera may become unable to record movies or the power
may turn off automatically to protect the camera. A message will be displayed on the screen before the power turns
off or you can no longer record movies. In this case, leave the power off and wait until the camera and battery
temperature goes down. If you turn on the power without letting the camera and battery cool sufficiently, the power
may turn off again, or you may still be unable to record movies.
Notes on recording for long periods of time or recording 4K movies
Especially during 4K shooting, the recording time may be shorter under low temperature conditions. Warm up the battery
pack or replace it with a new battery.
Notes on playing movies on other devices
XAVC HS and XAVC S movies can only be played back on compatible devices.
Notes on recording/playback
Before you start recording, make a trial recording to make sure that the camera is working correctly.
Playback of images recorded with your product on other equipment and playback of images recorded or edited with
other equipment on your product are not guaranteed.
Sony can provide no guarantees in the event of failure to record, or loss of or damage to recorded images or audio
data, due to a malfunction of the camera or recording media, etc. We recommend backing up important data.
Once you format the memory card, all the data recorded on the memory card will be deleted and cannot be restored.
Before formatting, copy the data to a computer or other device.
Backing up memory cards
Data may be corrupted in the following cases. Be sure to back up the data for protection.
When the memory card is removed, the USB cable is disconnected, or the product is turned off in the middle of a
read or write operation.
When the memory card is used in locations subject to static electricity or electrical noise.
Database file error
25


If you insert a memory card that does not contain an image database file into the product and turn on the power, the
product automatically creates an image database file using some of the memory card’s capacity. The process may
take a long time and you cannot operate the product until the process is completed.
If a database file error occurs, export all images to your computer, and then format the memory card using this
product.
Do not use/store the product in the following places
In an extremely hot, cold or humid place
In places such as in a car parked in the sun, the camera body may become deformed and this may cause a
malfunction.
Storing under direct sunlight or near a heater
The camera body may become discolored or deformed, and this may cause a malfunction.
In a location subject to rocking vibration
It may cause malfunctions and an inability to record data. In addition, the recording media may become unusable,
and recorded data may be corrupted.
Near strong magnetic place
In sandy or dusty places
Be careful not to let sand or dust get into the product. This may cause the product to malfunction, and in some cases
this malfunction cannot be repaired.
In places with high humidity
This may cause the lens to mold.
In areas where strong radio waves or radiation are being emitted
Recording and playback may not function correctly.
On moisture condensation
If the product is brought directly from a cold to a warm location, moisture may condense inside or outside the product.
This moisture condensation may cause a malfunction of the product.
To prevent moisture condensation when you bring the product directly from a cold to a warm location, first put it in a
plastic bag and seal it to prevent air from entering. Wait for about an hour until the temperature of the product has
reached the ambient temperature.
If moisture condensation occurs, turn off the product and wait about an hour for the moisture to evaporate. Note that if
you attempt to shoot with moisture remaining inside the lens, you will be unable to record clear images.
Precaution on carrying
Do not hold, hit, or apply excessive force to the following parts, if your camera is equipped with them:
The lens part
The movable monitor part
The movable flash part
The movable viewfinder part
Do not carry the camera with the tripod attached. This may cause the tripod socket hole to break.
Do not sit down in a chair or other place with the camera in the back pocket of your trousers or skirt, as this may
cause malfunction or damage the camera.
Notes on handling the product
Before you connect the cable to the terminal, be sure to check the orientation of the terminal. Then, insert the cable
straight. Do not insert or remove the cable forcefully. This may cause the terminal part to break.
The camera uses magnetic parts including magnets. Do not bring objects affected by magnetism, including credit
cards and floppy disks, close to the camera.
The recorded image may be different from the image you monitored before recording.
On storing
26


For lens-integrated cameras
Always attach the lens cap when you are not using the camera. (Only for models supplied with a lens cap)
For interchangeable-lens cameras
Always attach the lens front cap or body cap when you are not using the camera. To prevent dust or debris from
getting inside the camera, remove dust from the body cap before attaching it to the camera.
If the camera is dirty after use, clean it. Water, sand, dust, salt, etc. left in the camera may cause a malfunction.
Notes on using lenses
When using the power zoom lens, be careful not to get your fingers or any other objects caught in the lens. (Only for
models with a power zoom feature or interchangeable lens cameras)
If you must place the camera under a light source such as sunlight, attach the lens cap to the camera. (Only for
models supplied with a lens cap or interchangeable lens cameras)
If sunlight or a strong light source enters the camera through the lens, it may focus inside the camera and cause
smoke or fire. Attach the lens cap to the lens when storing the camera. When you shoot with backlighting, keep the
sun sufficiently far away from the angle of view. Note that smoke or fire may occur even if the light source is slightly
away from the angle of view.
Do not directly expose the lens to beams such as laser beams. These may damage the image sensor and cause the
camera to malfunction.
If the subject is too close, the image may show any dust or fingerprints on the lens. Wipe the lens with a soft cloth,
etc.
Notes on the flash (Only for models with a flash)
Keep your fingers away from the flash. The light-emitting part may get hot.
Remove any dirt from the surface of the flash. Dirt on the surface of the flash may emit smoke or burn due to heat
generated by the emission of light. If there is dirt/dust, clean it off with a soft cloth.
Restore the flash to its original position after using it. Make sure that the flash portion is not sticking up. (Only for
models with a movable flash)
Notes on the Multi Interface Shoe (Only for models with a Multi Interface Shoe)
When attaching or detaching accessories such as an external flash to the Multi Interface Shoe, first turn the power to
OFF. When attaching the accessory, confirm that it is firmly fastened to the camera.
Do not use the Multi Interface Shoe with a commercially available flash that applies voltages of 250 V or more or has
the opposite polarity of the camera. It may cause a malfunction.
Notes on the viewfinder and flash (Only for models with a viewfinder or a flash)
Take care that your finger is not in the way when pushing the viewfinder or flash down. (Only for models with a
movable viewfinder or a movable flash)
If water, dust or sand adheres to the viewfinder or flash unit, it may cause a malfunction. (Only for models with a
movable viewfinder or a movable flash)
Notes on the viewfinder (Only for models with a viewfinder)
When shooting with the viewfinder, you may experience symptoms such as eyestrain, fatigue, travel sickness, or
nausea. We recommend that you take a break at regular intervals when you are shooting with the viewfinder.
In case you may feel uncomfortable, refrain from using the viewfinder until your condition recovers, and consult your
doctor if necessary.
Do not forcibly push down the viewfinder when the eyepiece is pulled out. It may cause a malfunction. (Only for
models with a movable viewfinder and an eyepiece that can be pulled out)
If you pan the camera while looking into the viewfinder or move your eyes around, the image in the viewfinder may be
distorted or the color of the image may change. This is a characteristic of the lens or display device and is not a
malfunction. When you shoot an image, we recommend that you look at the center area of the viewfinder.
The image may be slightly distorted near the corners of the viewfinder. This is not a malfunction. When you want to
see the full composition with all its details, you can also use the monitor.
If you use the camera in a cold location, the image may have a trailing appearance. This is not a malfunction.
27


Do not directly expose the viewfinder to beams such as laser beams. These may damage the inside of the viewfinder
and cause the camera to malfunction.
Notes on the monitor
Do not press against the monitor. The monitor may be discolored and that may cause a malfunction.
If the monitor has drops of water or other liquids on it, wipe it with a soft cloth. If the monitor stays wet, the surface of
the monitor may change or deteriorate. This may cause a malfunction.
If you use the camera in a cold location, the image may have a trailing appearance. This is not a malfunction.
When you connect cables to the terminals on the camera, the rotating range of the monitor may become limited.
Notes on the image sensor
If you point the camera at an extremely strong light source while shooting images with a low ISO sensitivity, highlighted
areas in the images may be recorded as black areas.
Notes on the cooling fan
Do not cover the air vent.
The air vent may get hot.
Do not use the camera in areas where there are dust or sand particles in the air.
If the cooling fan emits abnormal noises, stop using the camera and contact a service facility.
On image data compatibility
This product conforms with DCF (Design rule for Camera File system) universal standard established by JEITA (Japan

Notes on the battery pack and charging the battery
Notes on using the battery pack
Be sure to use only genuine Sony branded battery packs.
The correct remaining battery indicator may not be displayed under some operating or environmental conditions.
Do not expose the battery pack to water. The battery pack is not water-resistant.
Do not leave the battery pack in extremely hot places, such as in a car or under direct sunlight.
Notes on charging the battery pack
Charge the battery pack (supplied) before using the product for the first time.
The charged battery pack will discharge little by little even if you do not use it. Charge the battery pack each time
before you use the product so that you do not miss any opportunities to shoot images.
Do not charge battery packs except battery packs specified for this product. Doing so can result in leaks, overheating,
explosions, electric shocks, burns, or injuries.
When you use a completely new battery pack or a battery pack that has not been used for a long time, the charge
lamp (CHARGE) may flash quickly when the battery is charged. If this happens, remove the battery pack and then re-
insert it to recharge.
We recommend charging the battery pack in an ambient temperature of between 10 °C and 30 °C (50 °F and 86 °F).
The battery pack may not be correctly charged in temperatures outside this range.
Operation cannot be guaranteed with all external power supplies.
After charging is finished, disconnect the charger from the wall outlet (wall socket) if charging with a charger, or
disconnect the USB cable from the camera if charging the battery pack while it is inserted into the camera. Not doing
so may result in a shorter battery life.
Do not continuously or repeatedly charge the battery pack without using it if it is already fully charged or close to fully
charged. Doing so may cause a deterioration in battery performance.
If the product's charge lamp flashes while charging, remove the battery pack being charged, and then insert the same
battery pack firmly back into the product. If the charge lamp flashes again, this may indicate a faulty battery or that a
battery pack other than the specified type has been inserted. Check that the battery pack is the specified type.
If the battery pack is the specified type, remove the battery pack, replace it with a new or different one and check that
the newly inserted battery is charging correctly. If the newly inserted battery is charging correctly, the previously
inserted battery may be faulty.
Remaining battery indicator
The remaining battery indicator appears on the screen. It takes about one minute for the correct remaining battery
indicator to appear.
The correct remaining battery indicator may not be displayed under some operating or environmental conditions.
If the remaining battery indicator does not appear on the screen, press the DISP (Display Setting) button to display it.
Effective use of the battery pack
Battery performance decreases in low temperature environments. So in cold places, the operational time of the
battery pack is shorter. To ensure longer battery pack use, we recommend putting the battery pack in your pocket
close to your body to warm it up, and insert it in the product immediately before you start shooting. If there are any
metal objects such as keys in your pocket, be careful of causing a short-circuit.
The battery pack will run down quickly if you use the flash or continuous shooting function frequently, turn the power
on/off frequently, or set the monitor very bright.
We recommend preparing spare battery packs and taking trial shots before taking the actual shots.
32


If the battery terminal is dirty, you may not be able to turn on the product or the battery pack may not be properly
charged. In that case, clean the battery by lightly wiping off any dust using a soft cloth or a cotton swab.
How to store the battery pack
To maintain the battery pack’s function, charge the battery pack and then fully discharge it in the camera at least once a
year before storing it. Store the battery in a cool, dry place after removing it from the camera.
On battery life
The battery life is limited. If you use the same battery repeatedly, or use the same battery for a long period, the
battery capacity decreases gradually. If the available time of the battery is shortened significantly, it is probably time to
replace the battery pack with a new one.
The battery life varies according to how the battery pack is stored and the operating conditions and environment in
which each battery pack is used.

Notes on memory card
If 
 (overheating warning icon) is displayed on the monitor, do not remove the memory card from the camera right
away. Instead, wait for a while after turning off the camera, and then remove the memory card. If you touch the
memory card while it is hot, you may drop it and the memory card may be damaged. Be careful when removing the
memory card.
If you repeatedly shoot and delete images for a long time, fragmentation of data in a file in the memory card may
occur, and movie recording may be interrupted in the middle of shooting. If this happens, save your images to a
computer or other storage location, then execute [Format] using this camera.
Do not remove the battery pack or the memory card, disconnect the USB cable, or turn the camera off while the
access lamp is lit up. This may cause the data on the memory card to become damaged.
Be sure to back up the data for protection.
Not all memory cards are guaranteed to operate correctly.
Images recorded on an SDXC/CFexpress Type A memory card cannot be imported to or played on computers or AV
devices not compatible with exFAT when connected using a USB cable. Make sure that the device is compatible with
exFAT before connecting it to the camera. If you connect your camera to an incompatible device, you may be
prompted to format the card. Never format the card in response to this prompt, as doing so will erase all data on the
card.
(exFAT is the file system used on SDXC memory cards or CFexpress Type A memory cards.)
Do not expose the memory card to water.
Do not strike, bend or drop the memory card.
Do not use or store the memory card under the following conditions:
High temperature locations such as in a car parked under the sun
Locations exposed to direct sunlight
Humid locations or locations with corrosive substances present
If the memory card is used near areas with strong magnetization, or used in locations subject to static electricity or
electrical noise, the data on the memory card may become damaged.
Do not touch the terminal section of the memory card with your hand or a metal object.
Do not leave the memory card within the reach of small children. They might accidentally swallow it.
Do not disassemble or modify the memory card.
The memory card may be hot just after it has been used for a long time. Be careful when you handle it.
Memory card formatted with a computer is not guaranteed to operate with the product. Be sure to format the memory
card using this product.
Data read/write speeds differ depending on the combination of the memory card and the equipment used.
Do not press down hard when writing in the memo space on the memory card.
Do not attach a label on the memory card itself nor on a memory card adaptor. You may not be able to remove the
memory card.
If the write-protect switch or delete-protect switch of an SD memory card is set to the LOCK position, you cannot
record or delete images. In this case, set the switch to the record position.
To use a microSD memory card with this product:
Be sure to insert the memory card into a dedicated adaptor. If you insert a memory card into the product without a
memory card adaptor, you might not be able to remove it from the product.
When inserting a memory card into a memory card adaptor, be sure that the memory card is inserted in the
correct direction and then insert it as far as it will go. If the card is not inserted properly, it may result in a
malfunction.

Charging the battery with a commercially available AC adaptor or mobile battery
You can use a USB cable to charge from an external power source, such as a commercially available USB AC adaptor or
mobile battery.
When a device compatible with USB-PD (USB Power Delivery) is connected to the camera, fast charging is possible.
Note
USB charging is not possible from the Multi/Micro USB terminal. Use the USB Type-C terminal to charge the battery pack.
If the product is connected to a laptop computer that is not connected to a power source, the laptop battery level decreases. Do
not leave the product connected to a laptop computer for an extended period of time.
Do not turn on/off or restart the computer, or wake the computer from sleep mode when a USB connection has been established
between the computer and the camera. Doing so may cause a malfunction. Before turning on/off or restarting the computer, or
waking the computer from sleep mode, disconnect the camera from the computer.
Charging cannot be guaranteed with a custom-built computer, modified computer, or a computer connected through a USB hub.
The camera may not operate correctly when other USB devices are used at the same time.
We recommend using a USB-PD device that is compatible with an output of 9V/3A or 9V/2A.
Before charging, be sure to also read “Notes on the battery pack and charging the battery.”

Lens hood
We recommend that you use the lens hood to prevent light outside the shooting frame from affecting the image. Attach
the lens hood so that the indexes on the lens and lens hood are aligned.
(There may be no lens hood index on some lenses.)
Note
When attaching/removing the lens, work quickly in a dust-free location.
Do not press the lens release button when attaching a lens.
Do not use force when attaching a lens.
A Mount Adaptor (sold separately) is required to use an A-mount lens (sold separately). When using the Mount Adaptor, refer to
the operating manual supplied with the Mount Adaptor.
If you want to shoot full-frame images, use a full-frame size compatible lens.
When you use a lens with a tripod socket, attach a tripod to the tripod socket of the lens to help balance the weight of the lens.
When carrying the camera with a lens attached, hold both the camera and the lens firmly.
Do not hold the part of the lens that is extended for zoom or focus adjustment.
Attach the lens hood properly. Otherwise, the lens hood may not have any effect or may be partially reflected in the image.

Shooting movies
You can set the recording format and exposure and record movies by using the dedicated menu items for movies.
To select the recording format ( 
File Format)
The resolution and degree of compatibility vary depending on the recording format (XAVC HS 4K/XAVC S 4K/XAVC S
HD/XAVC S-I 4K/XAVC S-I HD/XAVC S-I DCI 4K*). Select the format in accordance with the purpose of the movie to be
shot.
Press the MODE (Mode) button, use the control wheel to select [Movie], and then press the center.
1
Press the REC (Recording) button to start recording.
2
Press the REC button again to stop recording.
3
When the camera’s system software (firmware) version is Ver.3.00 or later
*
94


To select the frame rate or image quality ( 
Movie Settings)
The frame rate determines the smoothness of motion in movies. ([
Movie Settings] → [Rec Frame Rate])
The image quality changes with the bit rate. ([
Movie Settings] → [Record Setting])
If the bit rate is high, the amount of information will increase and you can shoot high-quality movies. However, this will
result in a larger volume of data.
Select the frame rate and bit rate according to your preference and purpose.
To adjust the exposure (Exposure Ctrl Type/Exposure mode)
When [Exposure Ctrl Type] is set to [P/A/S/M Mode], select the exposure mode using the shutter speed and aperture
value combination in the same way as when shooting a still image.
When [Exposure Ctrl Type] is set to [Flexible Exp. Mode], you can set the shutter speed, aperture value, and ISO
sensitivity automatically or manually.
To select the focusing method ( 
Focus Mode/ 
Focus Area)
Select 
 (Continuous AF) or 
 (Manual Focus) for [
Focus Mode]. You can specify the focus area by setting
[
Focus Area].
Even during shooting with manual focus, you can temporarily switch to auto focus in the following ways.
Press the custom key to which [AF On] is assigned, or press the shutter button halfway.
Press the custom key to which [Eye AF] is assigned.
Touch the subject on the monitor.
To record movie audio in 4 channels
Attach the XLR handle unit (supplied) or a genuine Sony accessory that supports 4-channel and 24-bit audio recording to
the Multi Interface Shoe of the camera.
Hint
You can also assign the start/stop movie recording function to a preferred key.
You can focus quickly while shooting movies by pressing the shutter button halfway down. (The sound of auto focus operation
may be recorded in some cases.)
You can change the settings for ISO sensitivity, exposure compensation, and focus area while shooting movies.
The sounds of the camera and lens in operation may be recorded during movie shooting. To prevent sounds from being recorded,
set [Audio Recording] to [Off].
To prevent the operating sound of the zoom ring from being recorded when a power zoom lens is used, we recommend recording
movies using the zoom lever of the lens. When moving the zoom lever of the lens, be careful not to flip the lever.
Note
An icon indicating that data is being written is displayed after shooting. Do not remove the memory card while the icon is
displayed.
You cannot start recording a movie while writing data. Wait until data writing is completed and “STBY” is displayed before
recording a movie.
When playing back an XAVC S-I DCI 4K movie recorded with this camera on another camera of the same model, check the
system software (firmware) version of the camera. If the system software version is earlier than Ver.3.00, XAVC S-I DCI 4K
movies cannot be played back.
If the 
 (Overheating warning) icon appears, the temperature of the camera has risen. Turn the power off and cool the camera
and wait until the camera is ready to shoot again.
The temperature of the camera tends to rise when shooting movies continuously, and you may feel that the camera is warm. This
is not a malfunction. Also, [Internal temp. high. Allow it to cool.] may appear. In such cases, turn the power off and cool the
camera and wait until the camera is ready to shoot again.
95


For the continuous shooting time of a movie recording, refer to “Recordable movie times.” When movie recording is finished, you
can record another movie by pressing the REC button again. Recording may stop to protect the product, depending on the
temperature of the product or the battery.

Shooting still images (Intelligent Auto)
This section describes how to shoot still images in the [Intelligent Auto] mode. In the [Intelligent Auto] mode, the camera
automatically focuses and automatically determines the exposure based on the shooting conditions.
To select the focus mode yourself ( 
Focus Mode / 
Focus Area)
Specifying a focus mode, such as selecting 
 (Single-shot AF) for landscapes or still subjects and selecting 
(Continuous AF) for moving subjects, makes it easier to focus on the desired subject. You can also specify the focus
position and range using [
Focus Area].
Shooting while focusing on human eyes
Press the MODE (Mode) button, use the control wheel to select [Intelligent Auto], and press the center of
the control wheel.
The shooting mode will be set to 
 (Intelligent Auto).
1
Adjust the monitor angle, and hold the camera.
2
When a zoom lens is mounted, enlarge images by using the zoom lever or the zoom ring.
3
Press the shutter button halfway down to focus.
When the image is in focus, a beep sounds and the indicator (
, etc.) lights up.
4
Press the shutter button fully down.
5
97


The [
Face/Eye Prior. in AF] function under [Face/Eye AF] is enabled in the default settings, so you can use the Eye
AF function immediately.
To shoot images with the focus locked on the desired subject (Focus-lock)
When you focus on the subject, the focus is locked while the shutter button is pressed halfway down. Switch to the
desired composition and press the shutter button all the way down to take the picture.
You can lock the focus on non-moving subjects. Set [
Focus Mode] to 
 (Single-shot AF).
Setting [
Focus Area] to [Center Fix] makes it easier to focus on subjects located in the center of the screen.
Hint
When the product cannot focus automatically, the focus indicator flashes and the beep does not sound. Either recompose the
shot or change the focus mode or focus area settings. In [Continuous AF] mode, 
 (focus indicator) lights up and the beep
indicating that the focus has been achieved does not sound.
Note
An icon indicating that data is being written is displayed after shooting. Do not remove the memory card while the icon is
displayed. Doing so will prevent images from being recorded normally.

Bulb shooting
You can shoot a trailing image of the movement of a subject with long exposure.
Bulb shooting is suitable for shooting trails from stars or fireworks, etc.
Hint
When shooting fireworks, etc., focus at infinity in manual focus mode. If you use a lens whose infinity point is unclear, adjust the
focus on the fireworks in the area you want to focus on in advance.
In order to perform bulb shooting without causing the image quality to deteriorate, we recommend that you start shooting while
the camera is cool.

separately) or a remote commander equipped with a lock function (sold separately). When using the Bluetooth remote
commander, you can start bulb shooting by pressing the shutter button on the remote commander. To stop bulb shooting, press
the shutter button on the remote commander again. To use the other remote commander, use the model which can be connected
via the Multi/Micro USB terminal.

area” and “When focusing on a smaller area” depending on the subject or situation.
When you attach an A-mount lens with a Mount Adaptor (LA-EA3 or LA-EA5) (sold separately), the focusing frame for
“When focusing on a smaller area” may be displayed.
When focus is achieved automatically based on the whole range of the monitor
When you use a zoom function other than the optical zoom, the [
Focus Area] setting is disabled and the focusing
frame is shown by the dotted line. The AF operates with priority on and around the center area.
To move the focus area
You can move the focus area by operating the multi-selector when [

Capturing a standard white color to set the white balance (custom white balance)
In a scene where the ambient light consists of multiple types of light sources, it is recommended to use the custom white
balance in order to accurately reproduce the whiteness. You can register 3 settings.
Note
The message [Capturing of the custom WB failed.] indicates that the value is in the unexpected range, for example when the
subject is too vivid. You can register the setting at this point, but it is recommended that you set the white balance again. When an
error value is set, the indicator 
 (custom white balance) turns orange on the recording information display. The indicator will
be displayed in white when the set value is in the expected range.
If you use a flash when capturing a basic white color, the custom white balance will be registered with the lighting from the flash.
Be sure to use a flash whenever you shoot with recalled settings that were registered with a flash.

Shutter AWB Lock
You can set whether or not to lock the white balance while the shutter button is pressed when [
White Balance] is set
to [Auto] or [Underwater Auto].
This function prevents unintentional changes to the white balance during continuous shooting or when shooting with the
shutter button pressed halfway down.
Menu item details
Shutter Half Press:
Locks the white balance while the shutter button is pressed halfway down, even in the auto white balance mode. The
white balance is also locked during continuous shooting.

About [AWB Lock Hold] and [AWB Lock Toggle]
You can also lock the white balance in the auto white balance mode by assigning [AWB Lock Hold] or [AWB Lock Toggle]
to the custom key. If you press the assigned key during shooting, the white balance will be locked.
The [AWB Lock Hold] function locks the white balance by stopping the automatic white balance adjustment while the
button is pressed.
The [AWB Lock Toggle] function locks the white balance by stopping the automatic white balance adjustment after the
button is pressed once. When you press the button again, the AWB lock is released.
If you want to lock the white balance while recording a movie in the auto white-balance mode, also assign [AWB Lock
Hold] or [AWB Lock Toggle] to the custom key.
Hint
When you shoot with the flash while the automatic white balance is locked, the resulting color tones may be unnatural because
the white balance was locked before the flash was emitted. In this case, set [Shutter AWB Lock] to [Off] or [Cont. Shooting], and
do not use the [AWB Lock Hold] function or [AWB Lock Toggle] function when shooting. Alternatively, set [

Setting procedure:
HDR movie recording
The camera can record HDR movies when a gamma from [HLG], [HLG1] to [HLG3] is selected in the picture profile.
Picture profile preset [PP10] provides an example setting for HDR recording. Movies recorded using [PP10] can be
viewed with a wider range of brightness than usual when played back on a TV supporting Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG).
This way, even scenes with a wide range of brightness can be recorded and displayed faithfully, without looking under or
over-exposed. HLG is used in HDR TV program production, as defined in the international standard Recommendation
ITU-R BT.2100.
Items of the picture profile
Black Level
Sets the black level. (–15 to +15)
Gamma
Selects a gamma curve.
Movie: Standard gamma curve for movies
Still: Standard gamma curve for still images
S-Cinetone: Gamma curve designed to achieve cinematic gradations and color expressions. This setting enables
shooting with softer color reproduction ideal for portrait shooting.
Cine1: Softens the contrast in dark parts and emphasizes gradation in bright parts to produce a relaxed color movie.
(equivalent to HG4609G33)
Cine2: Similar to [Cine1] but optimized for editing with up to 100% video signal. (equivalent to HG4600G30)
Cine3: Intensifies the contrast in light and shade more than [Cine1] and strengthens gradation in black.
Cine4: Strengthens the contrast in dark parts more than [Cine3].
ITU709: Gamma curve that corresponds to ITU709.
S-Log3: Gamma curve for [S-Log3] with more similar features to film. This setting is based on the assumption that the
picture will be processed after shooting.
HLG: Gamma curve for HDR recording. Equivalent to the HDR standard Hybrid Log-Gamma, ITU-R BT.2100.
HLG1: Gamma curve for HDR recording. Emphasizes noise reduction. However, shooting is restricted to a narrower
dynamic range than with [HLG2] or [HLG3].
HLG2: Gamma curve for HDR recording. Provides a balance of dynamic range and noise reduction.
HLG3: Gamma curve for HDR recording. Wider dynamic range than [HLG2]. However, noise may increase.
[HLG1], [HLG2], and [HLG3] all apply a gamma curve with the same characteristics, but each offers a different
balance between dynamic range and noise reduction. Each has a different maximum video output level, as follows:
[HLG1]: approx. 87%, [HLG2]: approx. 95%, [HLG3]: approx. 100%.

There may be more noise in dark parts depending on the gamma settings. It may improve by setting the lens compensation to
[Off].
When using the S-Log3 gamma, noise becomes more noticeable compared to when using other gammas. If the noise is still
considerable even after processing the images, it may be improved by shooting with a brighter setting. However, the dynamic
range becomes narrower accordingly when you shoot with a brighter setting. We recommend checking the picture in advance by
test shooting when using S-Log3.
Setting [S-Log3] may cause an error in the white balance custom setup. In this case, perform custom setup with a gamma other
than [S-Log3] first, and then reselect the [S-Log3] gamma.

Setting PPLUT1–PPLUT4 may cause an error in the white balance custom setup. In this case, first perform the custom setup with

HLG Still Image
By using gamma characteristics equivalent to HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma: standard for HDR images), you can shoot still
images with a wide dynamic range and a wide color gamut compatible with BT.2020.
[HLG Still Image] can only be set when shooting in the HEIF format. Set [JPEG/HEIF Switch] to [HEIF(4:2:0)] or
[HEIF(4:2:2)], and [
File Format] under [Image Quality Settings] to [HEIF] beforehand.
Menu item details
On:
Shoots HLG still images.
Off:
Shoots normal still images.
Hint
You can reproduce a wider range of brightness by playing back HLG still images on an HLG-compatible TV or monitor.
You can display HLG still images on the camera’s monitor in almost the same quality as when they are displayed on an HLG-
(BT.2020-) compatible monitor by setting as follows.
[Gamma Display Assist]: [On]
[Gamma Disp. Assist Typ.]: [Auto] or [HLG(BT.2020)]
Note
In the following situations, [HLG Still Image] is fixed to [Off]:
[JPEG/HEIF Switch] is set to [JPEG]
[
File Format] under [Image Quality Settings] is set to [RAW] or [RAW & HEIF]
When a shooting mode other than P / A / S / M is set during still image shooting
When the ISO sensitivity is temporarily activated by the [Reg. Custom Shoot Set] function
When the [DRO Bracket] function under [Drive Mode] is temporarily activated by the [Reg. Custom Shoot Set] function

Color Space
The way colors are represented using combinations of numbers or the range of color reproduction is called “color space.”
You can change the color space depending on the purpose of the image.
Menu item details
sRGB:
This is the standard color space of the digital camera. Use [sRGB] in normal shooting, such as when you intend to print
out the images without any modification.
AdobeRGB:
This color space has a wide range of color reproduction. When a large part of the subject is vivid green or red, Adobe
RGB is effective. The file name of the recorded image starts with “_.”
Note
The [Color Space] setting is invalid when shooting images in the HEIF format. If [HLG Still Image] is set to [Off], images will be
recorded with the sRGB color space. When [HLG Still Image] is set to [On], it is recorded in the BT.2100 color space (BT.2020
color gamut).
[AdobeRGB] is for applications or printers that support color management and DCF2.0 option color space. Images may not be
printed or viewed in the correct colors if you use applications or printers that do not support Adobe RGB.
When displaying images that were recorded with [AdobeRGB] on non-Adobe RGB-compliant devices, the images will be
displayed with low saturation.

Intra/Long GOP is a movie compression format. Intra compresses the movie by frame, and Long GOP compresses
multiple frames. Intra compression has better response and flexibility when editing, but Long GOP compression has
better compression efficiency.
Note

Example of setting values
(A): Bit rate
(B): Color sampling
(C): Bit depth
The higher the bit rate, the higher the image quality.
Color sampling (4:2:2, 4:2:0) is the recording ratio of color information. The more uniform this ratio is, the better
the color reproducibility, and it is possible to remove colors neatly even when compositing using a green screen.
Bit depth represents the gradation of luminance information. When the bit depth is 8 bits, 256 levels of gradation
can be obtained. When the bit depth is 10 bits, 1024 levels of gradation can be obtained. A larger value enables
smoother expression from dark to bright areas.
[4:2:2 10 bit] is a setting that assumes that the recorded movie will be edited on a computer. The playback
environment for [4:2:2 10 bit] is limited.

The color tone of the shot result may vary when you shoot the same scene using a different shutter speed. If that happens, we
recommend that you shoot in [Shutter Priority] or [Manual Exposure] mode with a fixed shutter speed.
You can perform anti-flicker shooting by pressing the shutter button halfway down even when in manual focus mode.
When [Anti-flicker Shoot Sel.] is assigned to the desired key using [

shooting speed may slow down or the interval between shots may become irregular.
The camera detects flickering when the frequency of the light source is 100 Hz or 120 Hz only.
The camera cannot detect flickering depending on the light source and shooting conditions, such as a dark background.
Even if the camera detects flickering, the influences caused by flickering may not be reduced enough depending on the light

Recording audio using the XLR adaptor of the supplied handle
The handle (supplied) is equipped with an XLR adaptor. By attaching the handle, you can connect multiple external audio
devices to record sound.
The camera is compatible with the digital audio interface of the Multi Interface Shoe. This allows the camera and the XLR
adaptor to communicate with each other through digital signals and provide audio recording with minimum noise
interference.
Switching the audio input to the handle
By switching the audio input from the built-in microphone of the camera to the handle, you can record with the
microphone connected to the handle.
Connecting an external audio device
You can use a microphone (sold separately) or an external audio device, such as an audio mixer, for recording.
Set the HANDLE AUDIO switch to ON.
The built-in microphone of the camera is activated when the HANDLE AUDIO switch is set to OFF.
1.
Connect your desired device to the INPUT1, INPUT2, or INPUT3 jack.
When using either the INPUT1 or INPUT2 jack, connect the device to the INPUT1 jack.
When connecting the device to the INPUT3 jack, proceed to Step 3.
1.
Select an audio source to input.
Depending on the device connected to the INPUT1 or INPUT2 jack, set the INPUT1 (LINE/MIC/MIC+48V) or
INPUT2 (LINE/MIC/MIC+48V) switch as follows:
LINE (standard input level of +4 dBu (0 dBu = 0.775 Vrms)): for an external audio device (e.g. an audio mixer)
MIC: for a dynamic microphone or a microphone with the built-in battery
MIC+48V: for a microphone compatible with +48V power (phantom power)
2.
With the INPUT SELECT switch, select the audio input for recording audio to the channels on the camera.
Select the audio input jack on the XLR adaptor (INPUT1, INPUT2, or INPUT3) through which audio is recorded to
the channels on the camera.
3.
When the device is connected to the INPUT1 or INPUT2 jack, set the standard input level of the microphone.
When the INPUT1 (LINE/MIC/MIC+48V) or INPUT2 (LINE/MIC/MIC+48V) switch is set to either “MIC” or
“MIC+48V,” you can set the standard input level with the ATT (INPUT1) or ATT (INPUT2) switch. Select the level
suitable for the sensitivity of the connected microphone or for the volume level of the input audio.
0dB: Standard input level of -60 dBu
This is suitable for recording with a low-sensitivity microphone while amplifying sounds.
10dB: Standard input level of -50 dBu
This is the recommended input level for an ordinary microphone.
20dB: Standard input level of -40 dBu
This is suitable for recording with a high-sensitivity microphone while keeping the sound volume low.
4.
Adjust the recording volume level.
5.

Minimizing noise with the low-cut function
Minimize unwanted noises, such as wind noise, air-conditioning noise, and vibration noise, by attenuating low-frequency
components of the audio input from the INPUT1 or INPUT2 jack.
Adjusting the recording volume level
You can adjust the recording volume level of the audio input from the INPUT1, INPUT2, or INPUT3 jack.
Hint
To automatically adjust the recording volume level, set the AUTO/MAN(/LINK) switch to “AUTO.” If the input audio is loud, the
recording volume level will be lowered automatically to avoid audio distortion.
To automatically synchronize the adjustment of the recording volume level of the audio input from the INPUT2 jack to the INPUT1
jack, set the AUTO/MAN/LINK (INPUT2) switch to “LINK.” This synchronization comes in handy for receiving audio through the
INPUT1 and INPUT2 jacks and recording the audio in stereo. Setting the AUTO/MAN (INPUT1) switch to “MAN” and the
AUTO/MAN/LINK (INPUT2) switch to “LINK” disables the AUDIO LEVEL dial for the INPUT2 jack. This allows you to adjust the
recording volume levels of the audio input from both the INPUT1 and INPUT2 jacks simultaneously with the AUDIO LEVEL dial
for the INPUT1 jack.
Selecting the audio input for recording audio to the channels on the camera
With the INPUT SELECT switch, select the audio input jack on the XLR adaptor (INPUT1, INPUT2, or INPUT3) through
which audio is recorded to the channels on the camera.
When only the INPUT1 jack has an external device connected:
Set the switch to “IN1.” Audio input from the INPUT1 jack will be recorded to both the CH1 and CH2 channels on the
camera.
When both the INPUT1 and INPUT2 jacks have an external device connected:
Set the switch to “IN1·IN2.” Audio input from the INPUT1 jack will be recorded to the CH1 channel on the camera, while
audio input from the INPUT2 jack will be recorded to the CH2 channel.
Hint
Change the LOW CUT (INPUT1) or LOW CUT (INPUT2) switch setting.
Select either “300Hz” or “100Hz” depending on the noise to minimize.
1.
Set the AUTO/MAN(/LINK) switch for the audio input jack (INPUT1/INPUT2/INPUT3) to “MAN.”
1.
Rotate the AUDIO LEVEL dial to adjust the volume to the appropriate level.
Make sure that the volume is at the appropriate level by monitoring the audio recording volume with the
connected headphones or the volume level meter on the camera.

When using a stereo microphone with two XLR (3-pin, female-type) plugs, connect the left-channel plug to the INPUT1 jack and
the right-channel plug to the INPUT2 jack, and then set the INPUT SELECT switch to “IN1·IN2.”
In addition, setting the AUTO/MAN/LINK (INPUT2) switch to “LINK” comes in handy during stereo recording, as you can
simultaneously adjust the recording volume levels of the audio input from both the INPUT1 and INPUT2 jacks.
When the INPUT3 jack has an external device connected:
Set the switch to “IN3.” Stereo audio will be received through the INPUT3 jack, and left-channel audio will be recorded to
the CH1 channel on the camera, while right-channel audio will be recorded to the CH2 channel.
When the INPUT1, INPUT2, and INPUT3 jacks all have an external device connected for simultaneous recording
to 4 channels
To record audio input from the INPUT1 jack to the CH1 channel, audio input from the INPUT2 jack to the CH2 channel,
and audio input from the INPUT3 jack to the CH3 and CH4 channels on the camera, set the switch to “IN1·IN2.”
To record audio input from the INPUT3 jack to the CH1 and CH2 channels, audio input from the INPUT1 jack to the CH3
channel, and audio input from the INPUT2 jack to the CH4 channel on the camera, set the switch to “IN3.”
Note
If dust or water droplets are present on the surface of the microphone, successful recording may not be possible. Be sure to clean
the microphone surface before using the handle.
While recording is in progress, operating and handling noises from the camera or lens may be recorded. Touching the handle
while recording is in progress will cause noise to the recording.
If the microphone on the handle is in proximity to a speaker, acoustic feedback may occur. In this case, move the handle away
from the speaker to allow the maximum distance between the microphone and the speaker, or lower the speaker volume.
When a micro USB cable is connected to the handle, using the XLR adaptor may affect its performance.
Use of the XLR adaptor in the vicinity of a radio tower may cause static noise in recordings. Before camera shooting, make sure
that there is no radio tower nearby.

When connecting the adapter cable to the camera, be careful not to apply excessive force to the Multi Terminal of the adapter
cable.
When you set the camera to the external lock status, the time code is instantly locked to the external time code, and the same
value as the external time code appears on the time data display. However, do not start recording for a few seconds until the time
code generator stabilizes.
If the frequency of the reference time code and the frame frequency of the camera are not the same, the time code cannot be
locked correctly and the camera will not operate normally. In this case, the time code also cannot be properly locked to the
external time code.
When you match the time code of the camera with that of another device, movies may be off by one frame. If you use the camera
for a long time, the deviation from the reference time code may increase.

Format
When you use a memory card with this camera for the first time, we recommend that you format the card using the
camera for stable performance of the memory card. Note that formatting permanently erases all data on the memory
card, and is unrecoverable. Save valuable data on a computer, etc.
The difference between quick formatting and full formatting
Perform full formatting when you feel like the speed of recording to the memory card or read-out from the memory card
has become slow, or when you want to erase data completely, etc.
Full formatting takes longer than quick formatting, because all areas of the memory card are initialized.
Hint
You can also display the screen for formatting the memory card by pressing and holding the MENU button and then the 
(Delete) button on the shooting screen for approximately two seconds.
You can cancel full formatting before it is completed. Even if you cancel full formatting in the middle of the process, the data will
be erased, so you can use the memory card as is.
Note
Formatting permanently erases all data including protected images and registered settings (from M1 to M4).
The access lamp lights up during formatting. Do not remove the memory card while the access lamp is lit up.
Format the memory card on this camera. If you format the memory card on the computer, the memory card may not be usable
depending on the format type.
It may take a few minutes to complete formatting, depending on the memory card.
You cannot format the memory card if the remaining battery charge is less than 1%.

Number of recordable images
When you insert a memory card into the camera and turn the camera on, the number of images that can be recorded
(should you continue to shoot using the current settings) is displayed on the screen.
Note
A maximum of 40 000 still images can be recorded to each memory card. If the number of recorded images reaches the upper
limit, replace the memory card.
When “0” (the number of recordable images) flashes in orange, the memory card is full or the number of recorded images
exceeds the number that can be managed using the database file. Replace the memory card with another one, or delete images
from the current memory card. When you transfer images on a memory card to a computer, etc., the number of recordable
images may be displayed as “0”. In this case, you may be able to record images by executing [
Recover Image DB].
When “NO CARD” flashes in orange, it means no memory card has been inserted. Insert a memory card.
If the 
 (Warning) icon or the 
 (Malfunction) icon is displayed, there is something wrong with the memory card. Replace
the memory card with another one.

The times shown are recordable times using a Sony memory card.
The duration of time available for movie recording varies depending on the file format/recording settings for movies,
memory card, ambient temperature, Wi-Fi network environment, condition of the camera before you start recording,
and condition of the charging of the battery.
The maximum continuous recording time for a single movie shooting session is approximately 13 hours (a product
specification limit).
Note
The recordable time of movies varies because the camera is equipped with VBR (Variable Bit-Rate), which automatically adjusts
image quality depending on the shooting scene. When you record a fast-moving subject, the image is clearer but the recordable
time is shorter because more memory is required for recording. The recordable time also varies depending on the shooting
conditions, the subject or the image quality/size settings.
Notes on continuous movie recording
High-quality movie recording and high-speed continuous shooting require large amounts of power. Therefore, if you
continue to shoot, the temperature inside the camera will rise, especially that of the image sensor. In such cases, the
camera will turn off automatically because the surface of the camera is heated to a high temperature or the high
temperature affects the quality of the images or the internal mechanism of the camera.
The duration of time available for continuous movie recording when the camera records with the default settings after
the power has been turned off for a while is as follows. The values indicate the continuous time from when the
camera starts recording until the camera stops recording.
When [Auto Power OFF Temp.] is set to [Standard]
When [Auto Power OFF Temp.] is set to [High]
XAVC S HD: 59.94p 50M/50p 50M 4:2:0 8bit; when the camera is not connected via Wi-Fi; when using a CFexpress
Type A memory card; when the monitor is open
XAVC S 4K: 59.94p 150M/50p 150M 4:2:0 8bit; when the camera is not connected via Wi-Fi; when using a
CFexpress Type A memory card; when the monitor is open
The duration of time available for movie recording varies with the temperature, file format/record setting for movies,
Wi-Fi network environment, or condition of the camera before you start recording. If you frequently recompose or
shoot images after the power is turned on, the temperature inside the camera will rise and the recording time
available will be shorter.
If the 
 (Overheating warning) icon appears, the temperature of the camera has risen.
If the camera stops movie recording due to a high temperature, leave it for some time with the power turned off. Start
recording after the temperature inside the camera drops fully.
If you observe the following points, you will be able to record movies for longer periods of time.
Keep the camera out of direct sunlight.
