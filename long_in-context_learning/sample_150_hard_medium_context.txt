Things of Note
•
Fertilizer remains in the soil all season. It can continue into the next season 
if planting with a multi-season crop.
•
Speed-Gro increases growth rate by at least 10%. Deluxe Speed-Gro 
increases growth rate by at least 25%. Hyper Speed-Gro increases growth 
rate by at least 33%. No Speed-Gro will reduce time between harvests for 
multi-harvest crops.
•
Tree fertilizer is only effective on wild trees; it does not change the growth 
of fruit trees.

Things of Note
•
The Artifact Trove can be purchased from the Desert Trader for 5 Omni 
Geodes, is dropped by haunted skulls after the Vault Bundle is complete, is 
found in tier 3 supply crates, or is dug up in artifact spots on Ginger Island. 
It has a 3.7% chance of containing an artifact, Golden Pumpkin, Pearl, or 
Treasure Chest.
•
Items found in Fishing Chests or by tilling soil in the mines may not mark 
as found in the Collections tab – this may be corrected by dragging the 
artifact outside the inventory window and taking it back.

Things of Note
•
Swords are well rounded, with quick attacks & low swing delay. Secondary 
attack blocks.
•
Daggers have a short range and are directional (only target area in front of 
player). Secondary attack causes player to quickly stab multiple times.
•
Clubs are are slower than swords and daggers but have a wide swing. 
Secondary attack slams the ground in front of the player, causing area-of-
effect damage.
•
Slingshot damage depends mainly on weapons used. With the best 
ammunition (Iridium Cores), a slingshot can deal between 25 and 101 
damage and a master slingshot can deal between 50 and 202 damage.
